PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND**\n----------------------------\n\n1.\n\nBy **Notice of Arbitration** dated 19 July 2016, the Claimant initiated this arbitration pursuant to the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules and Article 8 of the Agreement between the Government of the United Kingdom of England and Northern Ireland and the Government of the Republic of Bolivia for the Promotion and Protection of Investments, signed on 24 May 1988 (the \"**Treaty**\").\n\n2.\n\nOn 18 August 2016, the Respondent submitted its **Response to the Notice of Arbitration**, which included a request for bifurcation of the proceedings.\n\n3.\n\nBy letter dated 8 March 2017, the PCA circulated on behalf of the Tribunal Draft Terms of Appointment and Draft Procedural Order No. 1, and invited the Parties to submit their comments thereon.\n\n4.\n\nBy e-mail of 24 March 2017, the Claimant submitted the Parties' comments on the Draft Terms of Appointment and Draft Procedural Order No. 1, as confirmed by the Respondent's e-mail of the same date. The Respondent included a request for bifurcation of the proceedings in its comments on the procedural calendar.\n\n5.\n\nBy letter dated 29 March 2017, the Tribunal issued the Terms of Appointment and invited the Parties to set out in more detail their positions regarding, *inter alia*, the question of the bifurcation of the proceedings.\n\n6.\n\nOn 3 and 14 April 2017, the Parties provided their further comments on the bifurcation of the proceedings. The Respondent argued that the Tribunal should already decide on its request for bifurcation, while the Claimant contended that only after the submissions of the Statement of Claim would the Tribunal be able to properly assess whether to bifurcate the proceedings.\n\n7.\n\nOn 15 May 2017, a **First Procedural Meeting** was held by conference-call, during which the Parties provided further comments on Draft Procedural Order No. 1.\n\n8.\n\nOn 31 May 2017, the Tribunal issued **Procedural Order No. 1**, including a timetable for the arbitration. In particular, the Tribunal decided that it would only rule on the Respondent's request for bifurcation after the receipt of the Statements of Claim and Defence and, potentially, a hearing on bifurcation.\n\n9.\n\nOn 15 August 2017, the Claimant filed its **Statement of Claim** including the **Claimant's Response to the Respondent's Request for Bifurcation**.\n\n10.\n\nBy letter dated 11 December 2017, the PCA informed the Parties that the Tribunal had decided not to hold a hearing on bifurcation.\n\n11.\n\nOn 18 December 2017, the Respondent filed its **Statement of Defence** including all objections to the Tribunal's jurisdiction, as well as the **Respondent's Reply on Bifurcation**. In the covering letter to its submission, the Respondent requested that the Tribunal reconsider its decision not to hold a hearing on bifurcation.\n\n12.\n\nBy letter dated 27 December 2017, the Claimant opposed the Respondent's request to hold a hearing on bifurcation.\n\n**II. RESPONDENT'S OBJECTIONS TO JURISDICTION AND ADMISSIBILITY**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**A. CLAIMANT'S POSITION**\n--------------------------\n\n**1. Consent to arbitration**\n-----------------------------\n\n13.\n\nThe Claimant asserts that Bolivia has expressly and unequivocally consented to resolve investment disputes with UK investors through international arbitration by way of Article 8 of the Treaty, which provides in relevant part as follows:\n\nIf after a period of six months from written notification of the claim there is no agreement to an alternative procedure, the parties to the dispute shall be bound to submit it to arbitration under the Arbitration Rules of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law as then in force.1\n\nStatement of Claim \u00b6 133; **C-1**, Treaty, Article 8.\n\n14.\n\nThe Claimant contends that all requirements in terms of jurisdiction and admissibility set out by Article 8 are met: (i) a dispute exists between Glencore Bermuda (a national of one Contracting Party) and Bolivia (the other Contracting Party) concerning the obligations of the latter under the Treaty in relation to investments made by Glencore Bermuda in Bolivia; (ii) in its written notices dated 11 December 2007, 14 May 2010, and 27 June 2012 Glencore Bermuda formally notified Bolivia of the existence of the dispute pursuant to Article 8 of the Treaty; (iii) Glencore Bermuda repeatedly sought to resolve the dispute amicably but no satisfactory response was ever received from the Bolivian Government; and (iv) more than six months have elapsed since Glencore Bermuda notified Bolivia of the existence of the dispute in relation to each of the nationalizations and the dispute remains.2\n\nStatement of Claim \u00b6\u00b6 134-137.\n\n**2. Jurisdiction** ***ratione temporis***\n------------------------------------------\n\n15.\n\nThe Claimant notes that the Treaty was signed on 24 May 1988, entered into force on 16 February 1990, and was extended to the United Kingdom overseas territory of Bermuda on 9 December 1992 pursuant to an exchange of notes.3 While the Respondent denounced the Treaty with effect from May 2014, the Claimant asserts that all of its investments were made in prior to Bolivia's denunciation and therefore continue to benefit from its protection according to Article 13 of the Treaty.4\n\nStatement of Claim \u00b6 125; Exchange of Notes, December 3, 1992, and December 9, 1992, pursuant to which the Treaty was extended to Bermuda and other territories, **C-2**.\n\nStatement of Claim \u00b6\u00b6 125-126.\n\n**3. The Claimant's investments and their legality**\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n16.\n\nThe Claimant argues that its indirect shareholding in Vinto and Colquiri and stake in the Colquiri Lease, the Smelters, and the Tin Stock constitute protected investments under Articles 1(a)(i) and 1(a)(ii) of the Treaty.5 The Claimant disputes that its investment must meet any additional requirements such as contribution to the host State's development, but argues that it meets such additional requirements in any event.6\n\nStatement of Claim \u00b6\u00b6 129-132, 311.\n\nStatement of Claim \u00b6 311.\n\n17.\n\nThe Claimant further argues that the Respondent's allegations that Glencore Bermuda's investments were \"unlawfully\" acquired is inconsistent with contemporaneous evidence.7 The Claimant also notes that there was no further investigation, formal accusation, or judicial proceeding ever brought against Glencore regarding the alleged illegality of the investments.8\n\nStatement of Claim \u00b6\u00b6 322-324.\n\nStatement of Claim \u00b6 323.\n\n**4. Abuse of process**\n-----------------------\n\n18.\n\nIn response to the Respondent's abuse of process objection, the Claimant affirms that the investments were acquired through a competitive international bidding process organized by a reputable firm specializing in the mining sector; the assets were held by Panamanian Companies and CDC (a development finance institution entirely owned by the UK government); and the transaction also involved assets located in Argentina.9 Furthermore, even if the transaction were considered a \"restructuring\" with the aim of obtaining treaty protection, the Claimant argues that Glencore Bermuda's acquisitions took place in March 2005, before any of the challenged measures had occurred or were even foreseeable.10\n\nStatement of Claim \u00b6\u00b6 316-317.\n\nStatement of Claim \u00b6\u00b6 318-320.\n\n**5. The Claimant's Swiss ownership**\n-------------------------------------\n\n19.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, in order to qualify as a protected investor, the Treaty requires only that a company be \"incorporated or constituted\" in the territory of one of the State parties, and it has shown that Glencore Bermuda is a company incorporated under the laws of Bermuda.11 The Claimant maintains that arbitral tribunals \"have universally rejected similar jurisdictional objections based on allegations that the claimant was a 'shell company' where the applicable BIT merely required the claimant to be 'incorporated' or 'constituted' in a territory to be considered a protected investor.\"12\n\nStatement of Claim \u00b6\u00b6 127-128, 310-312.\n\nStatement of Claim \u00b6 313.\n\n20.\n\nThe Claimant further argues that, even if it were relevant, Glencore Bermuda\u2014which \"has historically been the holding company for the vast majority of Glencore's international investments, including those in Latin America\"\u2014is not a shell company.13 Furthermore, the Claimant asserts that Glencore International would have enjoyed protection under the Switzerland-Bolivia BIT, such that its restructuring was immaterial.14\n\nStatement of Claim \u00b6 314.\n\nStatement of Claim \u00b6 314.\n\n**B. RESPONDENT'S POSITION**\n----------------------------\n\n**1. The Claimant's alleged investments**\n-----------------------------------------\n\n21.\n\nThe Respondent argues that an investor is entitled to protection under the Treaty only if it \"actively invests\" in the territory of a contracting party, and that Glencore Bermuda made no investment in Bolivia, but \"merely held legal title to assets for which it made no payment and to which it made no further contribution.\"15\n\nBolivia's Preliminary Objections, Statement of Defence and Reply on Bifurcation \u00b6\u00b6 258-292.\n\n**2. The legality of the Claimant's alleged investments**\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n22.\n\nThe Respondent argues that it is a generally accepted principle of investment arbitration that a tribunal cannot hear claims regarding an investment tainted by illegality.16 The Respondent argues that the privatization process was riddled with illegalities as the legal framework for the privatization of the Colquiri Mine Lease and the Antimony Smelter was established by former President S\u00e1nchez de Lozada to benefit his own economic interests in breach of the Bolivian constitution.17 In particular, the Respondent argues that the prices paid for the Smelters and the Colquiri Lease are inexplicably low.18 According to the Respondent, the Claimant could not have been unaware of these facts when it acquired the Smelters and the Colquiri Lease.\n\nBolivia's Preliminary Objections, Statement of Defence and Reply on Bifurcation \u00b6\u00b6 325, 338-345.\n\nSee Bolivia's Preliminary Objections, Statement of Defence and Reply on Bifurcation \u00b6\u00b6 326-329.\n\nBolivia's Preliminary Objections, Statement of Defence and Reply on Bifurcation \u00b6\u00b6 330-337.\n\n**3. Abuse of Process**\n-----------------------\n\n23.\n\nThe Respondent claims that \"a change of ownership structure when there is a reasonable prospect of a dispute constitutes an abuse of process, requiring that claims be dismissed, whenever the change had a purpose of obtaining investment treaty protection\".19\n\nBolivia's Preliminary Objections, Statement of Defence and Reply on Bifurcation \u00b6\u00b6 293-304.\n\n24.\n\nThe Respondent affirms that the disputes were \"clearly foreseeable, and in fact foreseen\" in 2005 when Glencore International transferred the assets to Glencore Bermuda.20 The Respondent recalls that Glencore International took out political risk insurance for the Smelters and Colquiri Lease to guard against exactly the sort of expropriation that it now claims to have suffered.21 Moreover, the Respondent notes that, at the time of the acquisition in 2005, Evo Morales was posed to assume presidency and it was clearly foreseeable that he \"would be less indulgent of private mining interests and would ensure complete respect for the law and the diverse social interests affected by the mining industry.\"22 The Respondent also submits that the Claimant was aware that various actors had been publicly questioning the legality of the Tin Smelter privatization since 2002, that the failure to put the Antimony Smelter into operation in accordance with the contractual terms would give rise to a dispute, and that the Respondent would likely have to intervene in the growing dispute with *cooperativistas* at the Colquiri mine.23\n\nBolivia's Preliminary Objections, Statement of Defence and Reply on Bifurcation \u00b6 306.\n\nBolivia's Preliminary Objections, Statement of Defence and Reply on Bifurcation \u00b6 307.\n\nBolivia's Preliminary Objections, Statement of Defence and Reply on Bifurcation \u00b6\u00b6 308-310.\n\nBolivia's Preliminary Objections, Statement of Defence and Reply on Bifurcation \u00b6\u00b6 312-319.\n\n25.\n\nThe Respondent adds that the Claimant has not provided any other justification for such transfer than to obtain Treaty protection, and that it is not true that Glencore International would benefit from protection under the Switzerland-Bolivia BIT given that treaty's requirement of \"a substantial Swiss interest\".24 The Respondent argues that there is no substantial Swiss interest in the Glencore group, which has widely dispersed shareholding by a range of global funds.25\n\nBolivia's Preliminary Objections, Statement of Defence and Reply on Bifurcation \u00b6\u00b6 320-324; Agreement between the Swiss Confederation and the Republic of Bolivia on the reciprocal promotion and protection of investments, English translation, Article 1(b)(aa), **RLA-19**.\n\nBolivia's Preliminary Objections, Statement of Defence and Reply on Bifurcation \u00b6 323; Morningstar, Glencore PLC Major Shareholders, **R-236**.\n\n**4. The Claimant's Swiss ownership**\n-------------------------------------\n\n26.\n\nThe Respondent denies that formal incorporation in Bermuda suffices to establish jurisdiction, given that the investors \"are purely Swiss in substantive reality\".26 The Respondent refers to the released \"Paradise Papers\" which show that \"Glencore Bermuda exists only in a nearly empty room that \"held a filing cabinet, a computer, a telephone, a fax machine and a checkbook\" at the Glencore Group's Bermudan law firm.27\n\nBolivia's Preliminary Objections, Statement of Defence and Reply on Bifurcation \u00b6\u00b6 348-359.\n\nBolivia's Preliminary Objections, Statement of Defence and Reply on Bifurcation \u00b6\u00b6 360-369, quoting International Consortium of Investigative Journalists, Room of Secrets Reveals Glencore's Mysteries, press article of 5 November 2017, **R-243**, pp. 1-7.\n\n27.\n\nOn the other hand, if the Claimant's corporate veil cannot be pierced, the Respondent then argues that the Claimant should not be allowed to submit claims based on the indirectly held rights of its subsidiaries.28 The Respondent argues that, in contrast to other contemporaneous investment treaties (such as the Switzerland-Bolivia BIT) which extend jurisdiction to indirect investments, the UK-Bolivia Treaty does not make an exception to the otherwise applicable customary rule pursuant to which a shareholder may not substitute itself for the company in which it holds shares.29\n\nBolivia's Preliminary Objections, Statement of Defence and Reply on Bifurcation \u00b6\u00b6 351, 370-371.\n\nBolivia's Preliminary Objections, Statement of Defence and Reply on Bifurcation \u00b6\u00b6 372-384.\n\n**5. The conflicting ICC arbitration clauses and waiver of diplomatic claims**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n28.\n\nThe Respondent argues that Claimant's claims ultimately concern the Tin Smelter, Antinomy Smelter, and Colquiri Lease contracts (the \"**Contracts**\"), and are therefore subject to the mandatory ICC arbitration clauses and waivers of diplomatic remedies contained in those Contracts.30 The Respondent points out that the Claimant itself invokes the Contracts in support of its claims.31\n\nBolivia's Preliminary Objections, Statement of Defence and Reply on Bifurcation \u00b6\u00b6 385-392.\n\nBolivia's Preliminary Objections, Statement of Defence and Reply on Bifurcation \u00b6\u00b6 393-399.\n\n**6. The Tin Stock claims were never notified to Bolivia**\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n29.\n\nThe Respondent asserts that the Claimant never notified Bolivia about the existence of potential claims concerning the Tin Stock as required under Article 8(1) of the Treaty.32 The Respondent considers that the claims regarding the Tin Stock are distinct from the Claimant's other claims and that the absence of prior notification deprives the Tribunal of jurisdiction over these claims.33\n\nBolivia's Preliminary Objections, Statement of Defence and Reply on Bifurcation \u00b6\u00b6 400-404.\n\nBolivia's Preliminary Objections, Statement of Defence and Reply on Bifurcation \u00b6\u00b6 405-411.\n\n**III. RESPONDENT'S REQUEST FOR BIFURCATION**\n---------------------------------------------\n\n**A. CLAIMANT'S POSITION**\n--------------------------\n\n30.\n\nThe Claimant contends that, contrary to the Respondent's allegations, bifurcation is not favoured under the UNCITRAL Rules, nor it is the general practice of international tribunals.34 Rather, according to the Claimant, efficiency is the overarching basis for deciding on bifurcation requests.35 In particular, the Claimant relies on *Glamis Gold* to argue that the relevant criteria are the likelihood of success of the jurisdictional objections and whether they can be decided without examining the merits of the case.36\n\nStatement of Claim \u00b6\u00b6 300-305.\n\nStatement of Claim \u00b6\u00b6 299, 306.\n\nStatement of Claim \u00b6\u00b6 306-307; *Glamis Gold Ltd v United States* (UNCITRAL) Procedural Order No. 2, 31 May 2005, **CLA-58**, para 12(c).\n\n31.\n\nAs regards the first criterion, the Claimant argues that the chances of the Respondent's objections prevailing are minimal, such that bifurcation will only lead to unwarranted delay and expense.37 The Claimant adds that bifurcation may give rise to costly and time-consuming parallel proceedings if either party challenges a decision on jurisdiction before the Paris courts.38\n\nStatement of Claim \u00b6\u00b6 309, 325-328.\n\nStatement of Claim \u00b6 327.\n\n32.\n\nAs for the second criterion, the Claimant asserts that the Respondent's jurisdictional objections are \"inherently factual and cannot be divided from the merits of the dispute\".39 According to the Claimant, in order to decide the Respondent's objections, the Tribunal will have to investigate many of the same facts and legal arguments from the same witnesses that the Parties will develop when discussing their substantive claims and defenses.40 In particular, the Claimant argues that bifurcation of the Respondent's objection will require duplicative testimony from Mr. Eskdale on various issues.41\n\nStatement of Claim \u00b6 325.\n\nStatement of Claim \u00b6 325.\n\nStatement of Claim \u00b6\u00b6 315, 321, 324.\n\n33.\n\nAccordingly, the Claimant requests that the Respondent's bifurcation request be dismissed.42\n\nStatement of Claim \u00b6 326.\n\n**B. RESPONDENT'S POSITION**\n----------------------------\n\n34.\n\nThe Respondent submits that it is a well-established rule in international arbitration that, when jurisdictional objections are well-founded and may be separated from the merits of the dispute, the Tribunal should proceed to decide such objections as a preliminary matter.43 The Respondent argues that \"it is fundamentally unjust, and even contrary to fundamental legal principles, to demand that a state defend itself against the merits of a claim before a tribunal without jurisdiction or where that jurisdiction is in dispute.\"44 According to the Respondent, efficiency is but an additional consideration that militates in favour of bifurcation.45 The Respondent therefore argues that the Tribunal should apply the three criteria set out in *Philip Morris v. Australia*, namely (i) whether the objections are *prima facie* serious and substantial, (ii) whether the objection can be examined without prejudging or entering the merits, and (iii) whether the objection, if successful, would dispose of all or an essential part of the claims raised.46\n\nResponse to the Notice of Arbitration \u00b6 51.\n\nBolivia's Preliminary Objections, Statement of Defence and Reply on Bifurcation \u00b6\u00b6 416-420.\n\nBolivia's Preliminary Objections, Statement of Defence and Reply on Bifurcation \u00b6\u00b6 421-428.\n\nBolivia's Preliminary Objections, Statement of Defence and Reply on Bifurcation \u00b6 429 quoting **CLA-121**, *Philip Morris Asia Limited v Commonwealth of Australia* (UNCITRAL) Procedural Order No 8 of 14 April 2014 \u00b6 109.\n\n35.\n\nThe Respondent argues that its preliminary objections clearly meet the *Philip Morris* criteria since, if any of them were granted (with the exception of the failure to notify the dispute over the Tin Stock), it would bring an immediate end to the entire arbitration proceeding.47 They are also serious and substantial as they are backed by extensive legal authorities and factual exhibits, and they are entirely separable from the merits of the dispute: \"the core facts for the objections extend only through when Glencore Bermuda received the Assets in 2005, while the core merits facts are from events in 2007, 2010, 2012, and beyond\".48\n\nBolivia's Preliminary Objections, Statement of Defence and Reply on Bifurcation \u00b6 431\n\nBolivia's Preliminary Objections, Statement of Defence and Reply on Bifurcation \u00b6\u00b6 431-436.\n\n36.\n\nThe Respondent further contends that the Claimant does not explain why the Respondent's preliminary objections are said to be interlinked with the merits, and that the fact that Mr. Eskdale would testify both as to facts relevant to jurisdiction and facts relevant to the merits does not create such a linkage.49\n\nBolivia's Preliminary Objections, Statement of Defence and Reply on Bifurcation \u00b6 438.\n\n37.\n\nAccordingly, the Respondent requests that its preliminary objections be decided in a bifurcated preliminary phase.50\n\nBolivia's Preliminary Objections, Statement of Defence and Reply on Bifurcation \u00b6 440.\n\n**IV. ANALYSIS OF THE TRIBUNAL**\n--------------------------------\n\n**A. APPLICABLE STANDARD**\n--------------------------\n\n38.\n\nThe Tribunal begins its analysis by setting out the applicable standard in relation to the issue of application as raised in this case. Articles 17.1 and 23.3 of the UNCITRAL Rules give discretion to the Tribunal to decide jurisdictional objections. Neither of those provisions imposes a presumption in favor or against bifurcation. Thus, in accordance with Article 17.1, the overarching principle that shall guide the Tribunal's decision is procedural fairness and efficiency, having regard to the totality of circumstances.\n\n39.\n\nWith this principle in mind, the Parties appear to agree that the proper factors or criteria to be taken into account are the ones used by the tribunals in *Philip Morris Asia Limited v Commonwealth of Australia*51*and Glamis Gold Ltd v United States*52. Although framed somewhat differently, both Tribunals seemed to consider the same factors or criteria, *i.e.* :\n\na) *Whether the request is substantial* or *is the objection prima facie serious and substantial* ?\n\nb) *Whether the request, if granted, would lead to a material reduction in the proceedings at the next stage* or *could the objection, if successful, dispose of all or an essential part of the claims raised* ?;\n\nc) *Whether bifurcation is impractical in the sense that the issues are too intertwined with the merit that it is very unlikely that there will be any savings in time* or *cost or can the objection be examined without prejudging or entering the merits* ?\n\n*Philip Morris Asia Limited v Commonwealth of Australia* (UNCITRAL) Procedural Order No 8, 14 April 2014.\n\n*Glamis Gold Ltd v. United States of America,* (UNCITRAL) (Procedural Order No.2 (Revised), May, 31, 2005.\n\n40.\n\nWith these criteria in mind, the Tribunal will now address each of the objections raised by the Respondent:\n\n**B. QUALIFICATION AS INVESTOR**\n--------------------------------\n\n41.\n\nThe first allegation is that the Claimant made no investment in Bolivia. Bolivia is arguing that the scope of the treaty extends only to companies which \"actively\" invested in Bolivia. According to Respondent, given that Glencore Bermuda made no investment in Bolivia, the investor does not have a claim under the applicable BIT. On the other hand, Claimant argues that the treaty only \"requires a company to be 'incorporated or constituted' in the territory of one of the State parties\" and that it does not require any requirement of \"seat or material business presence in the State\"53.\n\nStatement of Claim \u00b6 311.\n\n42.\n\nBefore addressing the issue of whether the objection is serious and substantial, the Tribunal confirms that, at this stage of the proceedings, its task is not to decide on the merits. Turning to the objection, however, the Tribunal finds, on the basis of the material before it at this stage, no clear textual support in the applicable BIT for the proposition that this agreement requires material or active presence for a company to qualify as investor. Thus, although the Tribunal recognizes that the objection is not frivolous, and the contextual arguments posed by the Respondent in this regard are capable of being argued and worth exploring in depth, it is not convinced that this objection is sufficiently serious and substantial as to justify bifurcation. In light of this view, the Tribunal will not address the other two criteria.\n\n**C. ABUSE OF PROCESS**\n-----------------------\n\n43.\n\nThe second allegation is that the Claimant committed abuse of process in bringing this arbitration. Respondent alleges that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction because Glencore Bermuda committed an abuse of process by structuring an investment in order to obtain standing. Respondent argues that Glencore International \"rerouted\" its investment through Bermuda when a dispute with Bolivia was foreseeable. On the other hand, Claimant argues that Glencore Bermuda's \"acquisition of its investments in Bolivia was not a 'restructuring' with the purpose of providing treaty protection\"54. Moreover even if that was the purpose, the Claimant argues that there could only be abuse of process \"in very exceptional circumstances\", that is when \"the purpose of the restructuring was exclusively obtaining treaty protection\"55.\n\nStatement of Claim \u00b6 317.\n\nStatement of Claim \u00b6 318.\n\n44.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that it is not disputed that Glencore International was the company that acquired/leased the disputed assets and that Glencore Bermuda acquisition started in March 2005. It is also not disputed that the first alleged breach occurred in February 2007 (Vinto's nationalization). Notwithstanding the time gap between the acquisition of the investment and the first alleged breach, valid questions arise as to the purpose of restructuring the investment as well as whether the investor could foresee that a dispute was going to arise. Based on this, the Tribunal finds that this exception is serious and substantial. As to the second element, it is clear that, if successful, these proceeding would be brought to an end. As to the third element, almost all the facts relevant for this claim predated February 2007, which is the date when the dispute presumably arose. Thus, it seems that the objection can be addressed without prejudging the merits.\n\n**D. CLEAN HANDS**\n------------------\n\n45.\n\nThe third objection deals with the allegation that the privatization of the assets underlying the claim was illegal under Bolivian law. The Respondent alleges that the acquisition of the Colquiri Mine Lease and the Antimony Smelter were contrary to the Bolivian Constitution. Bolivia also argues that the \"circumstances surrounding the privatization of the Assets were contrary to basic requirement of transparency and good faith.\"56 Based on this, Bolivia claims that, in accordance with the \"clean hands\" principle, \"Claimant cannot present for adjudication before this Tribunal claims tainted by the illegality which Claimant was aware of when it received the Assets\"57. Claimant argues that \"the assets were lawfully awarded to private investors through public tender processes.\"58\n\nBolivia's Preliminary Objections, Statement of Defence and Reply on Bifurcation \u00b6 337.\n\nBolivia's Preliminary Objections, Statement of Defence and Reply on Bifurcation \u00b6 338.\n\nStatement of Claim \u00b6 323.\n\n46.\n\nRegarding the \"clean hands\" principle, the Tribunal agrees with the tribunal in *Churchill Mining* who rightly pointed out that:\n\nThe common law doctrine of unclean hands barring claims based on illegal conduct has also found expression at the international level, although its status and exact contours are subject to debate and have been approached differently by international tribunals.59\n\n*Churchill Mining PLC and Planet Mining Pty Ltd v. Republic of Indonesia,* ICSID Case No. ARB/12/14 and 12/40, Award of 6 December 2016, \u00b6 493.\n\n47.\n\nIn reaching a decision on this objection, the Tribunal will not only have to accept this principle and determine its status, but also lay out its contours. Thus, it is difficult to come to a definitive view without a clear standard against which the substantiality and seriousness of this objection could be assessed. In this regard, the Tribunal has doubts as to whether a mere assertion of unlawful conduct could be enough to raise this objection above the required threshold. However, even accepting that the objection is serious and substantial, *quod non*, it is conceivable that the alleged illegalities would be part of the defense of the Respondent against breaches of the BIT. Thus, it seems that this objection cannot be addressed without touching on the merits of this dispute.\n\n**E. PIERCING THE CORPORATE VEIL AND INDIRECT INVESTMENT**\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n48.\n\nThe fourth jurisdiction objection relates to the claim that, in reality, the Claimant is a Swiss company and, therefore, not subject to the protection of the BIT. Respondent claims that the BIT excludes jurisdiction asserted based on corporate formalities when the real party in interest is not protected. Respondent requests to pierce the corporate veil because Glencore Bermuda is an \"empty shell\". In the alternative, the Respondent claims that, even if the corporate veil protects Glencore Bermuda, international law does not allow it to bring claims for its indirect investment. Conversely, the Claimant argues that Bolivia's argument has no foundation in the facts or in the text of the Treaty and that Glencore Bermuda has submitted sufficient evidence that it is a company incorporated under the laws of Bermuda (one of the United Kingdom overseas territories to which the Treaty was expressly extended) with \"investments\" protected under the Treaty.\n\n49.\n\nTurning to the first objection, the Tribunal finds also no clear textual support in the applicable BIT for the proposition that this agreement requires material or active presence for a company to qualify as investor. In addition, the Tribunal is not sure that the case quoted by the Respondent is applicable in this context since that case was dealing with the interpretation of \"foreign control\" set forth in Article 25(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention.60 In fact, another of the cases cited by Respondent takes the opposing view:\n\n*As the matter of nationality is settled unambiguously by the Convention and the BIT, there is no scope for consideration of customary law principles of nationality, as reflected in Barcelona Traction, which in any event are no different. In either case inquiry stops upon establishment of the State of incorporation, and considerations of whence comes the company's capital and whose nationals, if not Cypriot, control it are irrelevant*.61\n\n*TSA Spectrum de Argentina S.A. v. Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/05/5, Award of 19 December 2008.\n\n*ADC Affiliate Limited and ADC & ADMC Management Limited v Republic of Hungary* (ICSID Case No ARB/03/16) Award of the Tribunal of 2 October 2006, \u00b6 357.\n\n50.\n\nThus, although the Tribunal recognizes that the objection is not frivolous, and the arguments posed by the Respondent in this regard are capable of being argued and worth exploring in depth, it is not convinced that this objection is sufficiently serious and substantial as to justify bifurcation.\n\n51.\n\nTurning to the alternative objection, the Respondent argues that the ownership in the relevant assets is \"indirect\",62 and therefore, since the BIT does not include indirect investment, Glencore Bermuda is precluded from bringing this case. Although the Respondent makes a valid argument that some investment treaties have traditionally distinguished between direct or indirect investment and in this case the applicable BIT does not include indirect investment, no textual basis or precedent is cited as to an investment tribunal who has made this distinction and dismissed a case on this ground. Thus, the Tribunal is not convinced that these objections are sufficiently serious and substantial as to justify bifurcation. Considering this view, the Tribunal does not consider necessary to address the other two factors.\n\nGlencore Bermuda holds shares in Kempsey, Iris, and Shattuck, three Panamanian companies, which in turn own Colquiri through Sinchi Wayra. Colquiri directly owns the Assets (or Vinto, owned by Colquiri, in the case of the Tin Smelter).\n\n**F. ICC ARBITRATION**\n----------------------\n\n52.\n\nThe fifth objection relates to the claim that the Tribunal does not have jurisdiction over the contract claim. The Respondent argues that the Claimant ignored the arbitration clauses in the relevant contracts which required ICC arbitration adjudication. The Claimant responds that this dispute \"concerns the propriety of actions taken by the State in its sovereign capacity\u2014it does not, as Bolivia attempts to argue, concern contractual breaches.\"63\n\nLetter in response to concerns expressed by the Bolivia with respect to the Tribunal's decision to cancel the hearing on bifurcation. December 27, 2017. At page 4.\n\n53.\n\nThe Tribunal has difficulty understanding how the alleged breaches by Respondent are entirely contractual in nature. Moreover, even accepting that the objection is serious and substantial, the Tribunal believes that the facts related to this objection are too intertwined with the merits of the case and addressing this claim could touch on and prejudge the merits of the dispute.\n\n**G. TIN STOCK**\n----------------\n\n54.\n\nFinally, the Respondent argues that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction over the Tin Stock claims because they were never notified to Bolivia. The Respondent alleges that \"Claimant never provided Bolivia with written notification of its Tin Stock claims, depriving Bolivia of the opportunity to reach an amicable resolution of those claims\"64. The Claimant argues that since 2010 Bolivia took the position that \"Tin Stock formed part of the nationalized Antimony Smelter's inventory and its return would be addressed in the context of the negotiations to be held in relation to the nationalization\"65\n\nBolivia's Preliminary Objections, Statement of Defence and Reply on Bifurcation \u00b6 404.\n\nLetter in response to concerns expressed by the Bolivia with respect to the Tribunal's decision to cancel the hearing on bifurcation. December 27, 2017. At page 8.\n\n55.\n\nThe Tribunal finds that this is an ancillary claim that cannot, of itself, justify bifurcation. Even Respondent concedes that, if successful, it would not bring the dispute to an end, nor dispose of an essential part of the claims raised, nor even lead to a material reduction in the proceedings at the next stage.66 Therefore, the Tribunal dismisses this ground for bifurcation.\n\nBolivia's Preliminary Objections, Statement of Defence and Reply on Bifurcation \u00b6 431.\n\n**H. CONCLUSION**\n-----------------\n\n56.\n\nAfter reviewing each of the preliminary objections, the Tribunal's analysis reveals that the abuse of process objection, but only that objection, could justify the bifurcation of the proceedings. Nevertheless, the Tribunal recalls that the overarching principle is the fairness and efficiency of this process as a whole. With this principle in mind, the Tribunal considers that it would be more efficient to deal with all preliminary objections together with liability in a first phase, and leave issues of damages, if any, for determination in a second phase. This approach seems to the Tribunal more efficient in terms of time and costs than the alternative, which is to bifurcate just one issue but leave all other objections to a merits phase. Finally, the Tribunal wishes to stress that the ultimate outcome of the objections will be a factor that the Tribunal may take into account when awarding costs in this arbitration.\n\n57.\n\nThe Tribunal has considered the positions and preferences of the Parties with regards to the procedural timetable to follow in these proceedings. After deliberation, the Tribunal has adopted the procedural calendar attached to this order as **Annex 1**.\n\n58.\n\nPursuant to Procedural Order No. 1, document production requests submitted to the Tribunal for decision, together with objections and responses, must be in tabular form pursuant to the model appended to this Procedural Order as **Annex 2** (modified Redfern schedule). The Parties shall use the model format throughout their exchange of requests, objections, and responses.\n\n**V. DECISION**\n---------------\n\n59.\n\nFor these reasons, the Tribunal, decides to hear the Parties' submissions regarding jurisdiction and admissibility together with their submissions on the merits, while bifurcating the proceedings with regards to quantum to a later phase of proceedings, if the need for such a later phase arises.\n\n60.\n\nThe Tribunal establishes the procedural calendar

Overview of the Dispute**\n------------------------------\n\n3.\n\nThe present dispute arises out of the reversion decrees enacted by the government of Bolivia in 2007, 2010 and 2012 whereby the investments made by the Claimant were reverted to the State's domain. The dispute concerns the Tin Smelter, the Antimony Smelter, the Tin Stock and the Colquiri Mine Lease, as described below.1\n\nSee Sections III.2 to III.6.B below.\n\n4.\n\nThe Claimant contends that the measures taken by Bolivia breach certain obligations under the Agreement between the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the Government of the Republic of Bolivia for the Promotion and Protection of Investments (the \"**UK-Bolivia Treaty**\" or \"**Treaty**\").\n\n**II. PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND**\n-----------------------------\n\n**1. Commencement of the Arbitration**\n--------------------------------------\n\n5.\n\nBy **Notice of Arbitration** dated 19 July 2016, the Claimant initiated this arbitration pursuant to the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law Arbitration Rules as revised in 2010 (the \"**UNCITRAL Rules**\"), and Article 8 of the Treaty, which provides as follows:\n\nARTICLE 8\n\n**Settlement of Disputes between an Investor and a Host State**\n\n(1) Disputes between a national or company of one Contracting Party and the other Contracting Party concerning an obligation of the latter under this Agreement in relation to an investment of the former which have not been legally and amicably settled shall after a period of six months from written notification of a claim be submitted to international arbitration if either party to the dispute so wishes.\n\n(2) Where the dispute is referred to international arbitration, the investor and the Contracting Party concerned in the dispute may agree to refer the dispute either to:\n\n(a) the International Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes (having regard to the provisions, where applicable, of the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of other States, opened for signature at Washington DC on 18 March 1965 and the Additional Facility for the Administration of Conciliation, Arbitration and Fact-Finding Proceedings); or\n\n(b) the Court of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce\n\n(c) an international arbitrator or *ad hoc* arbitration tribunal to be appointed by a special agreement or established under the Arbitration Rules of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law.\n\nIf after a period of six months from written notification of the claim there is no agreement to an alternative procedure, the parties to the dispute shall be bound to submit it to arbitration under the Arbitration Rules of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law as then in force. The parties to the dispute may agree in writing to modify these Rules.2\n\nUK-Bolivia Treaty, 24 May 1988, Article 8 (footnotes omitted), **C-1**.\n\n6.\n\nIn its Notice of Arbitration, the Claimant proposed that the Secretary-General of the Permanent Court of Arbitration (the \"**PCA**\") act as appointing authority in this arbitration.\n\n7.\n\nOn 18 August 2016, the Respondent submitted its **Response to the Notice of Arbitration**, which included a request for bifurcation of the proceedings. The Respondent accepted the designation of the Secretary-General of the PCA as appointing authority.\n\n**2. Constitution of the Tribunal**\n-----------------------------------\n\n8.\n\nOn 15 September 2016, the Claimant appointed Prof. John Y. Gotanda as its party-appointed arbitrator.\n\n9.\n\nOn 24 October 2016, the Respondent appointed Prof. Philippe Sands as its party-appointed arbitrator.\n\n10.\n\nThe Parties agreed on a procedure to select the presiding arbitrator. Despite the Parties' efforts, they were unable to agree on a presiding arbitrator.\n\n11.\n\nOn 28 February 2017, the Secretary-General of the PCA appointed Prof. Ricardo Ram\u00edrez Hern\u00e1ndez as presiding arbitrator.\n\n**3. Initial Procedural Steps**\n-------------------------------\n\n12.\n\nOn 8 March 2017, the PCA circulated on behalf of the Tribunal draft Terms of Appointment and a draft Procedural Order No. 1, and invited the Parties to submit their comments thereon.\n\n13.\n\nThe **Terms of Appointment**, dated 29 March 2017, were signed by each member of the Tribunal and by the Parties. In them, the Parties agreed that the members of the Tribunal had been validly appointed in accordance with the Treaty and the UNCITRAL Rules, and that the PCA would act as registry and administering institution for the arbitration.\n\n14.\n\nOn 15 May 2017, a **First Procedural Meeting** was held by conference-call between the Tribunal and the Parties.\n\n15.\n\nOn 31 May 2017, the Tribunal issued **Procedural Order No. 1**, in which it fixed the languages of this arbitration as English and Spanish and the place of arbitration at Paris, France.\n\n16.\n\nIn Procedural Order No. 1, the Tribunal also decided that it would only rule on the Respondent's request for bifurcation after the receipt of the Claimant's Statement of Claim and the Respondent's Statement of Defence, and holding, potentially, a hearing on bifurcation.\n\n**4. Written Submissions**\n--------------------------\n\n17.\n\nOn 15 August 2017, the Claimant filed its Statement of Claim including the Claimant's response to the Respondent's request for bifurcation (\"**Statement of Claim**\").\n\n18.\n\nBy letter dated 11 December 2017, the PCA informed the Parties that the Tribunal had decided not to hold a hearing on bifurcation.\n\n19.\n\nBy letter dated 18 December 2017, the Claimant informed the Tribunal of the Respondent's filing of an application for discovery pursuant to section 1782 of the United States Code before a United States District Court seeking testimony and documents from [REDACTED] third party to this arbitrati [REDACTED] the \"**Section 1782 Application**\"). The Claimant requested that the Tribunal issue an order requiring the Respondent to withdraw or alternatively stay its Section 1782 Application until after it exhausted the document production process agreed by the Parties and ordered by the Tribunal in this arbitration, and declaring inadmissible any evidence obtained outside of these proceedings without the Tribunal's prior authorization.\n\n20.\n\nOn 18 December 2017, the Respondent filed its Statement of Defence including all objections to the Tribunal's jurisdiction (\"**Bolivia's Statement of Defence**\").\n\n21.\n\nOn 18 January 2018, the Tribunal informed the Parties that it had decided to hear the Parties' submissions regarding jurisdiction and admissibility together with their submissions on the merits, while bifurcating the proceedings with regard to quantum to a later phase of the proceedings, if any. The Tribunal also informed the Parties that it had decided to dismiss the Claimant's request regarding the Section 1782 Application, and advised the Parties that the reasoning for these decisions would follow in procedural orders to be issued in the following days.\n\n22.\n\nOn 31 January 2018, the Tribunal issued **Procedural Order No. 2**, containing its decision on bifurcation, and **Procedural Order No. 3,** regarding the Claimant's request on the Section 1782 Application.\n\n23.\n\nOn 16 March 2018, the Parties submitted their respective requests for document production.\n\n24.\n\nOn 27 March 2018, the Tribunal issued **Procedural Order No. 4**, ruling on the Parties' document production requests.\n\n25.\n\nOn 22 June 2018, the Claimant submitted its Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction and Reply on Merits (\"**Claimant's Reply**\").\n\n26.\n\nOn 24 October 2018, the Respondent submitted its Reply on Jurisdiction and Rejoinder on Merits (\"**Bolivia's Rejoinder**\").\n\n27.\n\nOn 2 January 2019, the Parties were provided with a draft version of Procedural Order No. 5, regarding the hearing on jurisdiction and merits, and were invited to consult and attempt to agree on the matters addressed therein.\n\n28.\n\nOn 22 January 2019, the Claimant submitted its Rejoinder on Jurisdiction (\"**Claimant's Rejoinder**\").\n\n29.\n\nOn 5 February 2019, the Parties simultaneously submitted their notifications of the witnesses which they intended to cross-examine at the hearing on jurisdiction and merits.\n\n30.\n\nOn 6 March 2019, the Parties and the Tribunal held a pre-hearing conference call.\n\n31.\n\nOn 19 March 2019, the Tribunal issued **Procedural Order No. 5**, convening the hearing on jurisdiction and merits and addressing certain logistical and other hearing arrangements.\n\n**5.

FACTUAL BACKGROUND OF THE DISPUTE**\n------------------------------------------\n\n**1. Legal Framework**\n----------------------\n\n70.\n\nOn 16 February 1990, the UK-Bolivia Treaty entered into force.3 On 9 December 1992, it was extended to Bermuda and entered into force the same day.4\n\nUK-Bolivia Treaty, 24 May 1988, **C-1**.\n\nExchange of Notes, 3 December 1992 and 9 December 1992, pursuant to which the Treaty was extended to Bermuda and other territories, **C-2**.\n\n71.\n\nIn September 1990, Bolivia enacted Law No 1,182 (the \"**Investment Law**\"),5 with the purpose of \"stimulat[ing]\" and \"guarantee[ing]\" domestic and foreign investments in Bolivia.6\n\nInvestment Law, *Gaceta Oficial* No. 1662, 17 September 1990, Art. 1, **C-4**.\n\nInvestment Law, *Gaceta Oficial* No. 1662, 17 September 1990, Art. 1, **C-4** (unofficial translation).\n\n72.\n\nIn April 1992, Bolivia enacted Law No. 1,330 (the \"**Privatization Law**\"). Under that law, public entities, institutions, and companies were authorized to transfer their assets, shares and property rights to natural individuals or collective entities, whether domestic or foreign, or to participate with them in new \"mixed\" entities.7\n\nPrivatization Law, *Gaceta Oficial* No. 1,735, 24 April 1992, Art. 1, **C-58**. One of the ways in which Art. 4 of the same law provided that such transfers would be made was through public tender.\n\n73.\n\nLaw No. 1,544 of 21 March 1994 (the \"**Capitalization Law**\"), allowed an increase in the participation of private investment, domestic or foreign, in public-private partnerships. Pursuant to Article 2, Empresa Metal\u00fargica Vinto (\"**EMV**\"), among other entities, was to be converted into a public-private partnership.8\n\nCapitalization Law, 21 March 1994, Arts. 1-4, **R-8**. The Tribunal maintains the unofficial translation of the term \"*sociedades de econom\u00eda mixta*\" as provided by Respondent.\n\n74.\n\nThrough Law No. 1,615 Bolivia approved in February 1995 a reformed text of its Constitution. Article 138 indicated that nationalized mining groups belonged to the national patrimony and could not \"*be transferred or adjudicated to the property of private companies by any TITLE. The superior management and administration of the State mining industry will be the responsibility of an autarchic entity the attributions of which shall be determined by law*\".9\n\nConstitution of Bolivia, 1967 (emphasis added), **R-3** (unofficial translation).\n\n75.\n\nSupreme Decree No. 23,991 of 10 April 1995 provided for all public companies and entities to undergo \"reorganization processes\".10 Reorganization was for the purpose of \"increasing the competitivity and efficiency of the national economy by: a) The transfer to the private sector, for a price and in a transparent manner, of production activities that may be carried out in a more efficient way by the latter [\u2026]\".11\n\nSupreme Decree No. 23,991, 10 April 1995, Art. 1, **R-100** (unofficial translation): \"[a]*ll companies and other public entities, owners of economic units, assets, property, shares and rights, shall submit themselves as of the enactment of the present supreme decree, to reorganization processes [\u2026]*\" emphasis added).\n\nSupreme Decree No. 23,991, 10 April 1995, Art. 2, **R-100**.\n\n76.\n\nIn May 1997, Bolivia enacted Law No 1,777 (the \"**Mining Code**\").12 Under that statute, the State could grant mining concessions to national or foreign individuals or collective entities.13 The mining rights were given status of real property rights and could be freely transferred and mortgaged.14 In accordance with Article 138 of the Constitution, an independent entity was created: Corporaci\u00f3n Minera de Bolivia (\"**COMIBOL**\").15 Under Article 94, COMIBOL was required to transfer by way of international public tender the mining concessions which were not subject to risk-sharing or leasing contracts.16\n\nMining Code, 17 March 1997, **R-4.**\n\nMining Code, 17 March 1997, Art. 2, **R-4.**\n\nMining Code, 17 March 1997, Art. 4, **R-4.**\n\n\"[COMIBOL] is a public company, self-governed and dependent on the National Secretary of Mining, it is in charge of the high management and administration of State mining. This entity manages and administers, without directly carrying out any mining activities, only through shared risk, services, or lease agreements\". Mining Code, 17 March 1997, Art. 91, **R-4** (unofficial translation).\n\nResolution No. 139/99, 24 June 1999, p. 1, **C-59**; and Resolution No. 1753/99, 25 June 1999, p. 1, **C-60**, providing for the publishing of the calls for tender and approval of terms relating to the assets of EMV (Tin and Antimony) as well as for the transfer of \"Centro Minero de Colquiri\" by way of leasing contract.\n\n77.\n\nIn 1999 and in accordance with this framework, Bolivia issued the public terms for the sale of: 1) the Tin Smelter,17 2) the Antimony Smelter,18 and 3) the rights to operate and exploit the Colquiri Mine.19\n\nThe Tin Smelter has a surface area of approximately 61 Ha. It is located in Bolivia, 7.5 km east of the city of Oruro and approximately 230 km southeast of La Paz. Paribas, Privatisation of Bolivian mining assets, Confidential Information Memorandum, 16 September 1999, p. 25, **RPA-04**. \"The smelting process consists of roasting tin concentrate (raw material produced from mineral ore) at temperatures of 1,300-1,400 degrees Celsius, while injecting coal to act as a reducing agent to remove impurities. The resulting product, a tin ingot, is a semi-finished product with a variety of applications, including but not limited to, electronics, food products, and home appliances.\" Statement of Claim, \u00b6 41.\n\nThe Antimony Smelter has a surface area of approximately 9 Ha. It is located in Bolivia, 7.5 km northeast of the city of Oruro and approximately 230 km southeast of La Paz. Paribas, Privatisation of Bolivian mining assets, Confidential Information Memorandum, 16 September 1999, p. 59, **RPA-04**.\n\nThe Colquiri Mine has exploited silver (Ag) and Lead (Pb) since Spanish Colonial times (before 1825). The exploitation of Tin (Sn) and Zinc (Zn), on a small scale, dates from the mid twentieth century. In 1952, Empresa Minera Colquiri became part of COMIBOL, turning into the second most important producer in the country of tin and zinc. SRK Consulting, Inc.

Brief Description of the Assets**\n--------------------------------------\n\n78.\n\nThe Tin Smelter, the Antimony Smelter (together with the Tin Stock), and the Colquiri Mine (\"**Assets**\") which the Claimant contends constitute a covered investment under the Treaty can be briefly described as follows.\n\n**A. The Tin Smelter**\n----------------------\n\n79.\n\nThe Tin Smelter (\"**Tin Smelter**\") was built between 1968 and 1970 near the city of Oruro by the State company *Empresa Nacional de Fundiciones* (\"**ENAF**\").20 It began operations in 1971 and produces primarily \"high-grade metallic tin\".21 It is the largest smelter in Bolivia and \"processes minerals from various mining operations, including the Colquiri Mine and Huanuni mine.\"22\n\nBolivia's Statement of Defence, \u00b6 40.\n\nStatement of Claim, \u00b6 40; Roscoe Postle Associates Inc (\"**RPA**\") First Expert Report, 15 August 2017, \u00b6 42.\n\nStatement of Claim, \u00b6 27; RPA First Expert Report, \u00b6 42.\n\n**B. The Antimony Smelter**\n---------------------------\n\n80.\n\n\"The Antimony Smelter was located adjacent to the Tin Smelter\" and was built to produce metallic antimony ingots from materials originating in the Tupiza region of Bolivia (\"**Antimony Smelter**\").23 It was inaugurated in 1976 and was operative during the late 1970s and the end of 1980s, until its closure in 1985. Operations began again in 1990 pursuant to a toll contract held by the private United States (\"**US**\" or \"**U.S.**\") company Laurel Industries Inc. Upon expiration of the toll contract in August 1998 it ceased operations.24 The Antimony Smelter was used \"occasionally\" as a storage facility for the Colquiri Mine.25\n\nStatement of Claim, \u00b6\u00b6 59, 27.\n\nPrivatisation of Bolivian mining assets, Confidential Information Memorandum, 16 September 1999, p. 60, **RPA-04**; Claimant's Reply, \u00b6 27.\n\nStatement of Claim, \u00b6 59. Respondent also indicates as \"undisputed\" that the Antimony Smelter was used \"occasionally\" as a storage facility. Bolivia's Statement of Defence, \u00b6 884.\n\n**C. The Colquiri Mine**\n------------------------\n\n81.\n\nLocated in the Province of Inquisivi\u2014Department of La Paz\u2014226 km from La Paz and 70 km from Oruro, the Colquiri Mine has been active since the 1850s26 and it is the second largest tin/zinc producer in Bolivia (the \"**Colquiri Mine**\").27\n\n*Statement of Claim,* \u00b6 46.\n\n*Bolivia's Statement of Defence*, \u00b6 31.\n\nBolivia's Statement of Defence, \u00b6 30.\n\nStatement of Claim, \u00b6\u00b6 46-47.\n\n82.\n\nThe Colquiri Mine \"is an integrated operation consisting of a high-altitude underground mine, a mill and concentrator, as well as ancillary facilities such as maintenance shops, warehouses and offices. The Colquiri Mine deposit consists of four veins: Blanca, Rosario, San Antonio and San Carlos.\"28 A vein \"is a distinct sheet-like body of crystallized minerals within a rock\".29\n\nStatement of Claim, \u00b6 47. RPA First Expert Report, \u00b6 82, referring to the principal veins.\n\nStatement of Claim, fn. 73.\n\n83.\n\nThe Colquiri Mine adopted the underground mining method known as sub-level stoping.30 The extracted ore at the Colquiri Mine consisted of a mixture of zinc and tin, small quantities of other elements and additional minerals that were not commercially viable.31 The ore was processed in the mill and concentrator plant, where the various minerals were separated from each other and from the sterile rock through a series of processes.32 The concentrator plant separated tin from other minerals to produce tin concentrate (\"**Concentrator Plant**\").33 The valuable minerals that resulted from the separation process \u2014 mainly tin and zinc, were subsequently sold in concentrate form to either Glencore International AG (\"**Glencore International**\"), Complejo Metal\u00fargico Vinto S.A**. (**\"**Vinto**\"), or third parties.34\n\n*Glencore's operations chain.*35\n\nStatement of Claim, \u00b6 48; RPA First Expert Report, \u00b6\u00b6 97-98. This \"involves digging large-scale horizontal tunnels which follow a vein at different levels of elevation, as well as a vertical tunnel connecting the different sub-levels. Once this basic structure is in place, a number of holes are drilled into the roof of a low-elevation drift and then filled with explosives. When the explosives detonate, loose rocks fall down the ore pass to a lower level of the mine, a \"gallery,\" where they are gathered and transported to an underground crusher. The crushed ore is then transported to the surface through a vertical shaft. This process is repeated until the roof of the drift is so high that it cannot be reached by the drills anymore. At this point in time, a drill located in the next-highest drift will be used to intersect the underground excavation area. Once the entire relevant area has been excavated, the excavation area is filled back up with a mixture of cement and backfill materials such as tailings or sand and rocks\".

The Economic Situation in Bolivia Between 1970 and 1990**\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n84.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, the Bolivian economy was mainly based on mining until the beginning of the 20th century.36 The Claimant asserts that, at the beginning of the 1980s, \"Bolivia was severely hit by the decrease in international commodity prices, a lack of access to international financing and the high interest rates applicable to its debts.\"37 This crisis was aggravated in 1985 due to the steep fall in tin prices following the International Tin Council's collapse.38\n\nStatement of Claim, \u00b6 19; referring to \"Country Profile: Bolivia 1987-88,\" Economist Intelligence Unit, September 1987, p. 7, **C-54**; JA Morales and JD Sachs, \"Bolivia's Economic Crisis\" in: JD Sachs (ed), *Developing Country Debt and the World Economy*, 1989, pp 5-6, **C-56**.\n\nStatement of Claim, \u00b6 20; referring to \"Country Profile: Bolivia 1987-88,\" Economist Intelligence Unit, September 1987, pp. 5, 10, **C-54**.

The stated reasons were as follows:\n\n\u2022 the low value paid for the Tin Smelter \u2013 it was valued at US$140 million but sold for US$14 million;\n\n\u2022 the sale price did not consider an inventory worth US$16 million;\n\n\u2022 Allied Deals breached the obligation in clause 7.2 of the sales contract which stipulated that it could not transfer the asset to third parties before three years;\n\n\u2022 the sale contravened Article 59 of the Bolivian Constitution since the transfer of the asset was not approved by Congress.\n\nSupreme Decree No. 29,026 (the \"**Tin Smelter Reversion Decree**\"), *Gaceta Oficial* No. 2,969 on 9 February 2007, **C-20** (unofficial translation).\n\n105.\n\nOn 11 December 2007, Glencore Bermuda notified Bolivia of the existence of a dispute under the Treaty.92\n\nLetter from Glencore Bermuda (Mr. Kalmin and Mr. Hubmann) to Ministry of the Presidency (Mr. Quintana), 11 December 2007, **C-25**.\n\n106.\n\nIn February 2009, a new Constitution came into effect.93 Clause 8 of the transition provisions specified that the mining concessions granted to national and foreign companies before the entry into force of the Constitution would have to be adjusted, within a year, through mining contracts.

[\u2026] in recent years, the productive inactivity of the Metallurgic Smelter Vinto Antimonio has become evident, as well as its dismantling, notwithstanding that the terms of reference provided for the obligation to invest in and strengthen Empresa Metal\u00fargica Vinto Antimonio with economic, financial and technical capacity, that would allow the inflow of capital, technology, commercial practices and private management, allowing the Smelter to continue production, becoming a source of employment, taxes and externalities, in support of the mining activity of exploitation and concentration of antimony in the country.\n\nSupreme Decree No. 499 (the \"**Antimony Smelter Reversion Decree**\"), *Gaceta Oficial* No 127NEC, 1 May 2010, **C-26** (unofficial translation).\n\n109.\n\nThe decree also mentioned that the Vinto Tin Smelter \"was transferred in violation of various legal statutes and regulations\" (unofficial translation) and referred to the 2007 decree which reverted the Tin Smelter.\n\n110.\n\nOn 3 May 2010, Colquiri informed the Ministry of Mining and Metallurgy (\"**Ministry of Mining**\") that the 161 tonnes of tin concentrates stored in the smelter (the \"**Tin Stock**\") were not assets of the Vinto Antimonio Smelter, and requested for them to be returned.97 On 14 May 2010, Glencore notified the existence of a dispute and requested amicable consultations.

However, \"criminal activity of unprecedented intensity\" had taken place on 1 April 2012, such as the \"massive entry of hundreds of people\", most of whom had been identified into \"working areas of the company\". According to the letter, these people did not only commit theft of material, but also \"verbally assaulted\" the workers and \"expelled them from their working areas\", indicating their intention to take control of the mine. That very morning on 3 April ,a new contingent of people had been caught by a supervisor, who had received \"death threats\". Mr. Capriles also stated that, although the disturbances had been attended, to a large extent, by the company, \"the current situation previously set out ha[d] become unsustainable, to the point where the Colquiri Workers' Union ha[d] expressed [\u2026] its concern about the physical integrity of its members.\" In light of this, he requested COMIBOL to \"take the measures necessary to preserve peaceful possession and public order in the Colquiri mining district, as required by clause 12.2.1 of the lease agreement.\"100\n\nLetter from Colquiri (Mr. Capriles) to Comibol (Mr. C\u00f3rdova), 3 April 2012, **C-30** (unofficial translation).\n\n113.\n\nOn 26 April 2012, the Vice Minister of Mining Policy requested information about the thefts in order to \"measure the degree of economic damage caused\" as well as information on the operation and production of the mine.101\n\nLetter from the Ministry of Mining (Mr. Villca) to Sinchi Wayra (Mr. Capriles), 26 April 2012, **C-254**.

The main agreements were that the Ministry of Mining, the Ministry of Labor, Employment and Social Security and COMIBOL, pursuant to Article 369 paragraph IV of the Political Constitution of Bolivia, \"shall have all mining contracts with pre-existing rights in the mining district of Colquiri enforced, as well as all mining operations within the national territory\".

COMIBOL would also \"directly carry out the mining activities\" and lease the Rosario vein (except its southern part) to the Cooperativa 26 de Febrero. Additionally, \"machinery, equipment and supplies\" were also nationalized.124 The preamble of the decree starts by mentioning Article 369 of the Bolivian Constitution which provides that: \"the State is responsible for the mineral wealth\"; \"the natural resources [\u2026] which are strategic for the country\"; \"the State is in charge of the mining and metallurgy policy\"; and \"the State controls and audits all the mining production chain and the activities developed by holders of mining rights, mining agreements or pre-constituted rights.\" The preamble concludes by indicating that the function of the State is \"to administer and control strategic economic sectors [\u2026] in order to achieve economic and social development\", thus, \"it is necessary for the Government of the Plurinational State to issue the Supreme Decree in order to boost the development of the mining activity for the benefit of the Bolivian people.\"125\n\nSupreme Decree No 1,264, *Gaceta Oficial* No 384NEC, 20 June 2012, **C-39**. The decree instructed COMIBOL to pay for the machinery, equipment and supplies in accordance with a valuation process that would be performed by an independent company retained by COMIBOL in a maximum period of 120 working days from the publication of the decree. See Articles 1 and 2. The decree also provided for the creation of \"Empresa Minera Colquiri\" as a production company under the direction of COMIBOL, guaranteed continuity and the rights of Colquiri's workers that would now continue with COMIBOL and subsequently with the newly created company, and finally, indicated that COMIBOL would hire cooperativistas from Cooperativa 26 de Febrero that had voluntarily decided to join by 19 June 2012. See Supreme Decree No 1,264, *Gaceta Oficial* No 384NEC, 20 June 2012, Arts. 1-3, **C-39**.\n\nSupreme Decree No 1,264, *Gaceta Oficial* No 384NEC, 20 June 2012, **C-39** (Unofficial translation).\n\n127.\n\nAfter the decree was signed, *cooperativistas* and workers were still not satisfied, new confrontations broke out and massive demonstrations in La Paz were announced.126 Thus, on 3 October 2012, a new decree was issued with a new delimitation of the Rosario vein.127\n\nBolivia's Statement of Defence, \u00b6\u00b6 223-227.\n\nSupreme Decree No. 1,368, 3 October 2012, **R-32**.\n\n128.\n\nBolivia denounced the Treaty with effect from May 2014.128\n\nStatement of Claim, \u00b6 125.\n\n**IV. APPLICABLE LAW TO THE DISPUTE**\n-------------------------------------\n\n129.\n\nThe Parties have presented differing views as to what should be the applicable law in the dispute. The Claimant argues that the Treaty \"as lex specialis\" is \"the primary source of law governing the dispute\" and that the Treaty is to be supplemented by customary international law to the extent required.129 In the Claimant's view, Bolivian law \"informs the content of Glencore Bermuda's rights and obligations within the domestic legal and regulatory framework and Bolivia's commitments under that [] framework\";130 however, its role \"is limited\", it \"is relevant as evidence of Glencore Bermuda's investments\" but \"it is international law that applies to the substance of the dispute\".131\n\nStatement of Claim, \u00b6\u00b6 119, 121; Claimant's Reply, \u00b6 178.\n\nStatement of Claim, \u00b6 123; Claimant's Reply, \u00b6 178.\n\nClaimant's Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 182-183.\n\n130.\n\nOn the other hand, the Respondent indicates that \"[t]he appropriate law to apply includes the Treaty, but also international human rights treaties and Bolivian law.\"132 According to the Respondent, \"the Treaty provides the legal basis for Claimant's claims, nothing more [\u2026] it does not address any substantive legal issues except the general legal protections to which an investor is entitled\"133 and \"the Treaty provisions cannot displace, and are limited by, Bolivia's obligations to respect and protect human rights under, *inter alia*, the International Covenant for Civil and Political Rights [(\"**ICCPR**\")] and the American Convention on Human Rights.\"134 As to its domestic law, in the Respondent's view, it \"also applies to the dispute because that law defines the legal rights to the Assets that were held in Bolivia.\"135\n\nBolivia's Statement of Defence, \u00b6 247; Bolivia's Rejoinder, \u00b6 377.\n\nBolivia's Statement of Defence, \u00b6 250. \"[T]he Treaty is nothing more than a part of the substantive law applicable in the dispute. The text of the Treaty's dispute resolution clause, although it indeed establishes that the Treaty is part of the applicable law, does not say that the Treaty is the only applicable law.\" Bolivia's Rejoinder, \u00b6 363. See also, \u00b6 364.\n\nBolivia's Statement of Defence, \u00b6 252. \"[I]nternational human rights law is part of the law applicable to the present dispute.\" Bolivia's Rejoinder, \u00b6 369.\n\nBolivia's Statement of Defence, \u00b6 253. See also Bolivia's Rejoinder, \u00b6 376.\n\n131.\n\nAlthough the Treaty does not contain a specific provision designating the applicable law, Articles 8 and 9 leave no doubt on the applicability of the Treaty to the *substance* of the dispute at hand. Those provisions are the cornerstone to enforce the investment protections granted by this agreement. In particular, Article 8 refers the dispute to arbitration under the UNCITRAL Rules. Article 35(1) of the said rules provide:\n\nThe arbitral tribunal shall apply the rules of law designated by the parties as applicable to the substance of the dispute. Failing such designation by the parties, the arbitral tribunal *shall apply the law which it determines to be appropriate*. (emphasis added).\n\n132.\n\nIn the present case, there has been no designation by the Parties. While there is no contention on the applicability of the Treaty, the main disagreement between the Parties seems to be as to the role of other international rules and Bolivian law. Respondent has indicated that \"the Treaty provisions cannot displace, and are limited by, Bolivia's obligations\" under other agreements. More specifically, Respondent has argued that \"[t]he appropriate law to apply *includes the Treaty*, *but also* international human rights treaties and Bolivian law\"136 (emphasis added).\n\nBolivia's Statement of Defence, \u00b6 247.\n\n133.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees with Respondent that the Treaty is not the only applicable law to the dispute. In this regard and pursuant to Article 35(1) of the UNCITRAL Rules, we consider the appropriate applicable law to be the Treaty, as well as Bolivian Law. The Tribunal does not disregard the possibility that there may be other relevant provisions of international law that may shed light on the interpretation of the Treaty's substantive provisions. However, the Tribunal is not convinced by Bolivia's general argument that the Treaty provisions are restricted by its obligations to respect and protect human rights. To the extent relevant, such obligations may be considered by the Tribunal when analyzing if there has been a breach of Bolivia's commitments under the Treaty; however, it does not follow that the substantive provisions of the Treaty are limited in any specific way. The text does not indicate such an intention by the Parties. Moreover, both sets of obligations are applicable in their respective spheres to Bolivia and are not necessarily mutually exclusive.\n\n**V. OBJECTIONS TO JURISDICTION**\n---------------------------------\n\n**1. Whether The Claimant Qualifies as an Investor Under the Treaty**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n134.\n\nThe Respondent contends that the scope of the treaty extends jurisdiction only to companies which \"actively\" invested in Bolivia,137 that is: \"by directing the contribution of resources.\"138 According to the Respondent, Glencore Bermuda never actively participated or was involved in: 1) the process leading up to Glencore International's acquisition of the relevant Assets;139 2) the stock purchase of the companies controlling the relevant Assets;140 and 3) in the development, management or operation of the relevant Assets.141\n\nBolivia's Statement of Defence, \u00b6\u00b6 265-292; Bolivia's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 430-460.\n\nBolivia's Rejoinder, \u00b6 449.\n\nBolivia's Rejoinder, \u00b6 454; Bolivia's Statement of Defence, \u00b6\u00b6 280-281.\n\nBolivia's Rejoinder, \u00b6 455; Bolivia's Statement of Defence, \u00b6 282.\n\nBolivia's Rejoinder, \u00b6 456; Bolivia's Statement of Defence, \u00b6\u00b6 283-288.\n\n135.\n\nThe Claimant argues that the Treaty does not impose an active investment requirement, that it only \"requires a company to be 'incorporated or constituted' in the territory of one of the State parties\" and that it does not prescribe any other \"requirement, such as having [\u2026] 'seat' or material business presence in the State.\"142\n\nStatement of Claim, \u00b6 311. See also on whether there is an active investment requirement: Claimant's Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 248-264 and Claimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 136-148.\n\n**A. Analysis by the Tribunal**\n-------------------------------\n\n136.\n\nWe begin our analysis with the text of the Treaty, bearing in mind the general rule of interpretation provided in Article 31 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (\"**VCLT**\" or \"**Vienna Convention**\"),143 *i.e.*, \"in accordance with the *ordinary meaning* to be given to the *terms* of the treaty in their context and in the light of its object and purpose\" (emphasis added). Article 1 of the Treaty provides the definition, as agreed by the Parties, of two elements that are central to the current dispute: \"*investment*\" and \"*company*\"*.*\n\nFor the purposes of this Agreement;\n\n(a) \"investment\" means *every kind of asset* which is *capable of producing returns* and in particular, though not exclusively, includes:\n\n[\u2026]\n\n(ii) *shares in* and stock and debentures of *a company* and *any other form participation in a company*;\n\n[\u2026]\n\n*A change in the form* in which assets are invested *does not affect their characters* as investments. Investments made before the date of entry into force as well as those after entry into force shall benefit from the provisions of this Agreement;\n\n[\u2026]\n\n(emphasis added)\n\nVienna Convention, United Nations Treaty Series, Vol. 1155, p. 331, May 23, 1969, **CLA-6**.\n\n137.\n\nOn the other hand, the term \"companies\" is defined as:\n\n(i) in respect of the United Kingdom: corporations, firms and associations *incorporated or constituted* under the law in force in any part of the United Kingdom or in any territory to which this Agreement is extended in accordance with the provisions of Article 11;\n\n(ii) in respect of the Republic of Bolivia: corporations, firms and associations *incorporated or constituted* under the law in force in any part of the Republic of Bolivia.\n\n(emphasis added)\n\n138.\n\nWe first note that the definition of \"investment\" in Article 1 is expansive. The precise phrase refers to \"every kind of asset.\" Clearly, this statement broadens the definition of an investment \u2013 the definition is satisfied so long as one criterion is met, namely that the asset is \"capable of providing returns.\" In addition, Article 1 specifies that the listed assets are not exhaustive. Therefore, if an asset is capable of satisfying this condition, it will fall under the definition. Particularly with regard to shares and stocks, the addition of \"any other form of participation in a corporation\" confirms the expansive nature of the concept.\n\n139.\n\nThe Respondent has pointed to other articles in the Treaty in support of its contention that an active investment is required, in particular: Articles 8(1) and 13 which use the language \"investment of\" and \"investments made\" respectively.144 Article 8 provides for dispute settlement regarding \"an investment of [a national or company of one Contracting Party]\" and Article 13 governs the duration and termination \"of investments made whilst the Agreement is in force\". Bolivia also refers to other articles in support of the argument that \"across multiple provisions\" the Treaty \"presume[s] that an active relationship must exist between a protected investor and its investment\".145 The preamble refers to the desire to \"create favourable conditions for greater investment by [\u2026] companies\"; Article 1 refers to \"investments made before\" and \"those made after entry into force\"; and Article 2(1) refers to \"create favourable conditions for [\u2026] companies [\u2026] to invest capital in its territory\".146\n\nBolivia's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 432-451 and Bolivia's Statement of Defence, \u00b6\u00b6 265-278.\n\nBolivia's Statement of Defence, \u00b6 273.\n\nUK-Bolivia Treaty, 24 May 1988, **C-1**.\n\n140.\n\nAlthough Bolivia considers that such a requirement \"follows straightforwardly\" from an interpretation in accordance with Article 31(1) of the Vienna Convention,147 the Tribunal is not convinced this is the case. Article 31(1) of the Vienna Convention provides for an interpretation \"in accordance with the *ordinary meaning to be given to the terms* of the treaty *in their context* and *in the light* of its object and purpose\" (emphasis added). To the Tribunal, the word \"made\" cannot be read in isolation without the term \"investment\" (and its definition included in the Treaty).148 This word can convey the meaning of something that is \"artificially produced\" or \"put together\".149 Its use in Article 1 would seem to indicate that protection under the Treaty extends to an \"asset capable of producing returns\" that must exist or that was \"produced\" before or after the date of entry into force.\n\nBolivia's Statement of Defence, \u00b6 265.\n\nIn the same vein, the terms \"invest or invested\" used across several provisions can't be detached either from the Treaty definition of investment.\n\n\"[M]ade\". *Merriam-Webster.com*. 2023. https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/made 14 January 2023.\n\n141.\n\nOn the other hand, the preposition \"of\" can have several meanings depending on how it is used \u2013 it can indicate \"a point of reckoning\", \"origin or derivation\", \"cause, motive or reason\" as well as \"belonging or a possessive relationship.\"150 The Tribunal considers that the manner in which this preposition is used more likely indicates possession and thus agrees with the Claimant \"that this merely suggests that the investment must belong to the investor\u2014such investor may be passive or active [\u2026].\"151\n\n\"[O]f\". *Merriam-Webster.com*. 2023. https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/of 14 January 2023.\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6 137.\n\n142.\n\nWe likewise do not interpret the plain language of the preamble or the word \"by\" employed therein as implying or presuming anything about the type of involvement required by the investor in order to have standing under the Treaty. The Tribunal notes that, while context and object assist in determining the ordinary meaning of a specific term, the Tribunal is not persuaded that the articles cited by Bolivia effectively supersede the plain language used by the Parties in defining \"investment,\" nor do they impose additional requirements on such definition relating to the mode of acquisition, the degree of involvement in the purchase, or the management and operation of the assets. In this regard, the Tribunal cannot read an \"active investment\" requirement into the text of Article 1.152\n\nIt is worth noting that the tribunal in *Rurelec* was tasked with interpreting Article 1 of this Treaty. In its decision, that tribunal also considered the provision to contain \"a very broad definition of 'investment'\". *Guaracachi America, Inc and Rurelec Plc v.

Bolivia also argues that Glencore Bermuda is \"nothing more than a shell company [\u2026] with no activity in Bermuda [\u2026] no employees or staff of its own\".159 Based on the \"Paradise Papers,\"160 the Respondent contends that \"investments routed through Glencore Bermuda have been implicated in illegal activities throughout the world\"161 and this company's \"investment structure was [\u2026] a tax dodge.\"162 According to the Respondent, the Claimant \"must demonstrate that the use of the Glencore Bermuda entity was legitimate in light of Bolivia's evidence to the contrary.\"163\n\nBolivia's Statement of Defence, \u00b6 349.

Analysis by the Tribunal**\n-------------------------------\n\n148.\n\nThe Tribunal starts by noting that Article 1 of the Treaty does not include any additional requirement for a company, aside from the requirement of incorporation in accordance with the laws of the Contracting Parties, nor does it grant power to tribunals to look beyond a company's corporate structure. According to the Respondent, such power derives from \"a basic rule of international law that a company cannot misuse corporate formalities to establish international jurisdiction over its claims.\"169\n\nBolivia's Rejoinder, \u00b6 464.\n\n149.\n\nThe Tribunal finds no support for looking beyond the express requirement of the Treaty to determine whether an entity qualifies as a company under the Treaty.170 In the present case, it is uncontested that Glencore Bermuda is a UK company, under the terms of the Treaty. Even if the Tribunal could find a basis under customary international law, the tribunals that have previously examined this issue have characterized this recourse as \"exceptional\"171 and \"cautiously applied.\"172 Furthermore, this exception has been deemed applicable \"to prevent the misuse of privileges of legal personality, as in certain cases of *fraud or malfeasance* [\u2026] or to prevent the evasion of legal requirements or of obligations\"173 (emphasis added). For instance, the tribunal in *Pac Rim* stated clearly that \"there must be specific factors or compelling reasons that call for an inquiry into the company's actual ownership and control\".174 Thus, in order to even entertain a request to pierce the corporate veil this Tribunal would have to find specific factors or compelling reasons that would justify a finding of fraud, malfeasance or evasion.\n\n\"*As the matter of nationality is settled unambiguously by the Convention and the BIT, there is no scope for consideration of customary law principles of nationality, as reflected in Barcelona Traction, which in any event are no different. In either case inquiry stops upon establishment of the State of incorporation, and considerations of whence comes the company's capital and whose nationals, if not Cypriot, control it are irrelevant*\" (emphasis added). *ADC Affiliate Limited and ADC & ADMC Management Limited v. Republic of Hungary,* ICSID Case No ARB/03/16, Award, 2 October 2006, \u00b6 357, **CLA-64**.\n\n*Barcelona Traction, Light and Power Company, Limited* (Belgium/Spain), 1970, ICJ Reports 3, \u00b6\u00b6 57-58, **CLA-7**. In a similar sense: \"it might *in some circumstances* be permissible for a tribunal to look behind the corporate structures\" (emphasis added). *Saluka Investments BV v. Czech Republic,* UNCITRAL, Partial Award, 17 March 2006, \u00b6 230, **CLA-62**.\n\n\"[T]his principle only applies to situations where the real beneficiary of the business misused corporate formalities in order to disguise its true identity and therefore to avoid liability.\" *ADC Affiliate Limited and ADC & ADMC Management Limited v. Republic of Hungary,* ICSID Case No ARB/03/16, Award, 2 October 2006, \u00b6 358, **CLA-64**. The Tribunal fails to understand the basis for Respondent's statement that the \"bar is low for the misuse of corporate form to justify piercing the corporate veil\". Bolivia's Rejoinder, \u00b6 472. This statement comes after discussing the *Loewen* tribunal's decision in \u00b6 471 of Bolivia's Rejoinder, where Respondent indicates: \"[i]n fact, the *Loewen* tribunal did pierce the corporate veil, on facts that were much less egregious than those surrounding Glencore Bermuda.\" However, the issue of piercing the corporate veil was not addressed by the tribunal in that case, rather the tribunal expressed it saw \"no need to enter into that thicket. The question is whether there is any remaining Canadian entity capable of pursuing the NAFTA claim.\" *Loewen Group, Inc. and Raymond L. Loewen v. United States of America*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)98/3, Award, 26 June 2003, \u00b6 237, **RLA-28**. The main contention among the parties in that case was whether there was a *continuous nationality* requirement under the NAFTA.\n\n*Barcelona Traction, Light and Power Company, Limited* (Belgium/Spain), 1970, ICJ Reports 3, \u00b6 56, **CLA- 7***.*\n\n*Pac Rim Cayman LLC v.

First, as indicated by the Claimant, there is no evidence that \"Glencore Bermuda abused its corporate form and committed fraud and/or malfeasance by invoking the advantages of its corporate nationality in this arbitration.\"175 The Tribunal cannot find Glencore Bermuda at fault of fraud or malfeasance based solely on a journalistic investigation, especially since none of the allegations pertain to the Assets at issue in this arbitration. Insofar as any of these allegations have any connection or relevance to the Respondent's claim of abuse of process, the Tribunal addresses this in the following section.\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6 34.\n\n151.\n\nAs its an alternative claim, the Respondent asserts that there is a \"customary international law rule against bringing claims based on the rights of subsidiary companies\", but acknowledges that \"a treaty, such as an investment treaty or a friendship, commerce, and navigation treaty, can vary the basic rule.\"176 Before expressing an opinion or discussing the existence or limits of such a rule, the Tribunal will determine whether the Treaty permits claims based on \"indirect investments.\"\n\nBolivia's Statement of Defence, \u00b6 376.\n\n152.\n\nAs stated previously, the definition of investment is so broad that it encompasses \"every kind of asset [\u2026] capable of producing returns\" and is non-exhaustive, allowing for other types of investments not specifically listed. In the case of shares and stock, the text specifies \"and any other form of company participation.\" The Tribunal finds no distinction between \"direct and indirect\" investments in the language of the Treaty. Accordingly, it would appear that the text of the Treaty permits any type of investment so long as it complies with this language. Regarding the intent and purpose of the BIT, we concur with the *Rurelec* tribunal that:\n\n[G]iven that the purpose of the BIT is to promote and protect foreign investment, the Tribunal considers that the BIT would require clear language in order to exclude coverage of indirect investments\u2014language that the BIT does not contain. [\u2026]\n\nThe mere absence of an explicit mention of the different categories of investment (direct and indirect) cannot be interpreted as narrowing the definition of investment under the BIT to only direct investment.\n\nThe Tribunal therefore agrees with the Claimants and concludes that terms employed in the UK-Bolivia BIT are broad enough on their own to include indirect investments, even without employing further qualifications that would only reinforce what is already clear from the text of the BIT.177\n\n*Guaracachi America, Inc and Rurelec Plc v. Plurinational State of Bolivia*, UNCITRAL, Award, 31 January 2014, \u00b6\u00b6 353-355, **CLA-120**.\n\n153.\n\nThus, nothing can be read into the fact that the Treaty \"does not include in the category of investments rights that are indirectly held.\"178 For all these reasons, the Tribunal finds that the language of the UK-Bolivia Treaty permits bringing \"indirect investment\" claims and sees no need to determine whether there is a rule of customary international law which precludes claims brought \"based on the rights of subsidiary companies.\"179\n\nBolivia's Statement of Defence, \u00b6 380; Bolivia's Rejoinder, \u00b6 494. See *Guaracachi America, Inc and Rurelec Plc v.

Whether the Claimant Abused the Process**\n----------------------------------------------\n\n155.\n\nThe Respondent claims that \"[a] change of ownership structure when there is a reasonable prospect of a dispute constitutes an abuse of process, requiring that claims be dismissed, whenever the change had a purpose of obtaining investment treaty protection\".180 The Respondent contends that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction because Glencore Bermuda committed an abuse of process by structuring an investment in order to obtain standing. Bolivia argues that Glencore International \"rerouted\" its investment through Bermuda when a dispute with Bolivia was foreseeable.181 Conversely, the Claimant argues that Glencore Bermuda's \"acquisition of its investments in Bolivia was not a 'restructuring' with the purpose of providing treaty protection.\"182 Moreover, even if that was the purpose, the Claimant argues that \"it is a perfectly legitimate practice to restructure an investment to obtain treaty protection for future disputes\",183 evidence of abuse has been found \"in very exceptional circumstances\", taking into account \"all the circumstances of the case\" and when \"the purpose of the restructuring was exclusively obtaining treaty protection.\"184\n\nBolivia's Statement of Defence, \u00b6 294.

Analysis by the Tribunal**\n-------------------------------\n\n*i. Determination of the Applicable Standard*\n---------------------------------------------\n\n156.\n\nAbuse of process occurs when an investment is structured in order to obtain standing. Both Parties have alluded to the *Philip Morris* award when elaborating on the applicable standard.185 As a starting point, that tribunal considered to be clearly established by prior decisions that \"the mere fact of restructuring an investment to obtain BIT benefits is not *per se* illegitimate,\"186 that the threshold for a finding of abuse of process is \"high\", that such a finding involves an objective analysis (based on the circumstances of the case), and that it does not require a \"showing of bad faith\".187\n\nBolivia's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 395-397; Claimant's Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 225 and 228; Claimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 68, 74, 81-82.\n\n*Philip Morris Asia Limited v. Commonwealth of Australia*, UNCITRAL, Award on Jurisdiction and Admissibility, 17 December 2015, \u00b6 540, **CLA-129**.\n\n*Philip Morris Asia Limited v. Commonwealth of Australia*, UNCITRAL, Award on Jurisdiction and Admissibility, 17 December 2015, \u00b6\u00b6 539, 550 and 552, **CLA-129**.\n\n157.\n\nFurthermore, the Tribunal agrees that the legal test revolves \"around the concept of foreseeability\" and that this core concept means \"when there is a reasonable prospect [\u2026] that a measure which may give rise to a treaty claim will materialise.\"188 We do not see any reason for deviating from this standard. Thus, our task is to determine whether Glencore International \"changed its corporate structure [by assigning the rights on the relevant assets to its subsidiary Glencore Bermuda] to gain the protection of [the Treaty] at a point in time when a specific dispute was foreseeable.\"189\n\n*Philip Morris Asia Limited v. Commonwealth of Australia*, UNCITRAL, Award on Jurisdiction and Admissibility, 17 December 2015, \u00b6 554, **CLA-129**. The Parties disagree as to whether a tribunal should focus on the \"specific dispute which is subject to the arbitration\" or on \"a reasonable prospect of the dispute arising\", which according to Respondent \"may be one of several\". See Claimant's Reply, \u00b6 225; Claimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6 72; and Bolivia's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 401 and 408. The Tribunal observes that both decisions in *Philip Morris* and *Pac Rim* referred to *specific* disputes. We do not consider this argument would affect the analysis of foreseeability in the present case, particularly since, as the Tribunal understands it, the current dispute that ultimately both Parties refer to is in connection to the same relevant assets and the facts that led to those assets being \"reverted\" by Bolivia.\n\n*Philip Morris Asia Limited v. Commonwealth of Australia*, UNCITRAL, Award on Jurisdiction and Admissibility, 17 December 2015, \u00b6 554, **CLA-129**.\n\n*ii. Whether the Dispute was Foreseeable*\n-----------------------------------------\n\n158.\n\nThe *Philip Morris* tribunal considered that \"it would not normally be an abuse of right to bring a BIT claim in the wake of a corporate restructuring, if the restructuring was justified independently of the possibility of bringing such a claim.\"190 It followed a two-pronged analysis, first determining whether the dispute was foreseeable and then evaluating the evidence regarding the alternative reasons for restructuring.\n\n*Philip Morris Asia Limited v. Commonwealth of Australia*, UNCITRAL, Award on Jurisdiction and Admissibility, 17 December 2015, \u00b6 570, **CLA-129**.\n\n159.\n\nThe Respondent's first argument is that the investor should have foreseen the \"wave of political change\" in Bolivia that made the dispute \"likely to arise\".191 Bolivia puts forward statements by former President Carlos Mesa,192 as well as the political agenda of the MAS party which made calls to \"*end poverty [through] the recovery of strategic companies and natural resources*\".193 These statements were made two or three years before Glencore International's acquisition and assignment to Glencore Bermuda. In the Tribunal's view, they are too remote to be considered as a circumstance which triggered the alleged restructuring; moreover, the disagreement or dispute between the Parties must concern \"rights, not merely about policy\".194 The Respondent alleges that by 2005 it was foreseeable that \"Bolivia would be less indulgent of private mining interests\"195 since Evo Morales was posed to assume the presidency. The Claimant argues that at the time of the acquisition the MAS party was not in power and Mr. Morales was not a candidate to the presidency.196 The Tribunal observes that Bolivia does not dispute these facts.197 In any event, it cannot be reasonably expected that a change of governmental policy would, in and of itself and absent a palpable measure to point to, result in a violation of a foreign investor's rights.198\n\nBolivia's Rejoinder, \u00b6 414. See also Bolivia's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 410-414.\n\nSpeech of Mr Carlos Mesa Gibert before the Bolivian Congress, 17 October 2003, p. 3, **R-162**.\n\nFundaci\u00f3n Boliviana para la Capacitaci\u00f3n Democr\u00e1tica y la Investigaci\u00f3n, \"*Opiniones y an\u00e1lisis sobre las elecciones presidenciales de 2002*,\" 2002, p. 57, **R-163** (unofficial translation, emphasis added).\n\n*Philip Morris Asia Limited v. Commonwealth of Australia*, UNCITRAL, Award on Jurisdiction and Admissibility, 17 December 2015, \u00b6 566, **CLA-129**.\n\nBolivia's Statement of Defence, \u00b6 308.\n\nClaimant's Reply, \u00b6 232; Eskdale Second Witness Statement, \u00b6 65.\n\nRather, Respondent characterizes this argument as \"simplistic\" and responds that \"the MAS' political platform was not contingent on Mr. Morales' specific political programme for the 2005 elections\". See Bolivia's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 155, 148-157.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the Political Program of MAS also referred in section \"1.3.3 Foreign Companies\" that \"Legal security is guaranteed to foreign companies that submit to the Political Constitution of the State and Bolivian laws\". Section \"Mining\" references a \"new taxing regime\" and section 1.9 \"International Economic Relations, Integration and Foreign Trade\" indicates that \"international economic relations will be maintained under mutual respect and national sovereignty.\" (Unofficial translation). Political Program of *Movimiento Al Socialismo*, November 2005, pp. 13, 19, 36, **R-166**. Therefore, it is not evident for the Tribunal that the possible change of policy would indicate a dispute affecting the relevant assets.\n\n160.\n\nThe Respondent further contends that the circumstances in which Glencore International acquired the Assets should have indicated the prospect of a dispute. According to Bolivia, the sale of the Assets \"was prompted by the events of October 2003, and the ensuing investigations and legal action against [former President S\u00e1nchez de Lozada] personally.\"199 The Tribunal notes that the Respondent places special emphasis on the fact that this transaction was \"covered by very strict confidentiality rules\" and \"concluded in an expeditious manner.\"200 [REDACTED]\n\nBolivia's Rejoinder, \u00b6 415.\n\nBolivia's Rejoinder, \u00b6 415.\n\n161.\n\nRegarding the circumstances surrounding the sale of the Assets, the Tribunal is unable to draw any conclusions merely based on the fact that a transaction was concluded swiftly or with great secrecy. Particularly, the record does not indicate that such transaction had been challenged domestically; in fact, a few days prior to the acquisition by Glencore International, the Government of Bolivia, through its Vice Minister of Mining, stated in a letter to the company that the Bolivian government \"was favorable to new investments being made in the mining sector.\"202 [REDACTED]\n\n\"[\u2026] and in the spirit of adequately configuring the mining policy context that the Bolivian Government is currently carrying out, I must inform you that one of the issues that is being analyzed and that will surely lead to adjustments is the mining tax regime\" (unofficial translation). Letter from the Vice Minister of Mining to Glencore, 17 January 2005, p. 1, **C-63**. According to the record, the acquisition process took place between January and March 2005.

The Tin Smelter\n------------------\n\n162.\n\nWith respect to the Tin Smelter, the Respondent argues that the Claimant should have reasonably foreseen that the privatization of the Tin Smelter would be challenged, since the asset \"was privatized in a process fraught with irregularities.\"204 The Respondent contends that such irregularities were raised by civic organizations205 and, afterwards, in the bankruptcy process of the company which originally acquired the assets.206\n\nBolivia's Statement of Defence, \u00b6 71; Bolivia's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 417-419.\n\nLetter from the President of the Oruro Civic Committee to the *Contralor General de la Rep\u00fablica,* 21 February 2001, **R-123**; Letter from Representative Pedro Rub\u00edn de Celis to the *Contralor General de la Rep\u00fablica,* 10 May 2001, **R-124**; Letter from the Oruro Central Obrera to President Banzer Su\u00e1rez, 23 May 2001, **R-126**.\n\nLa Raz\u00f3n Digital, *El MAS pide la renuncia del Canciller Saavedra*, 8 November 2002, **R-134**; El Diario, *MAS pide la renuncia del Canciller de la Rep\u00fablica*, 4 December 2002, **R-135**; El Mundo, *MAS present\u00f3 las pruebas de corrupci\u00f3n contra Canciller*, 4 December 2002, **R-136**; Bolivia's Statement of Defence, \u00b6 85.\n\n163.\n\nThe Tribunal begins by noting that neither Glencore Bermuda nor Glencore International participated in the privatization process of the Tin Smelter. In addition, the Tribunal believes that none of these allegations constitute sufficient evidence that such process was fraught with irregularities, especially given that no formal administrative or judicial proceeding was brought against the Tin Smelter privatization procedure. The concerns were raised by a civic organization in 2001 and the press clippings detailing the corruption allegation were published in 2002, two years before Glencore International acquired the Assets. Bolivia argues that the \"Claimant cannot seriously assert that, at the time of the acquisition, it required a formal pronouncement of illegality of the privatization of the Tin Smelter in order to foresee that the State would take action against it.\"207 However, the Tribunal finds it difficult to comprehend how the Claimant could have viewed these events as reasonable prospects of a future dispute given the absence of a statement of illegality of any prior act (to which the Claimant was not a party and which at the time appeared to have been carried out in accordance with the applicable legal framework). Such a statement could have only been made by Bolivian governmental authorities.\n\nBolivia's Rejoinder, \u00b6 420.\n\nb. The Antimony Smelter\n-----------------------\n\n164.\n\nWith respect to the Antimony Smelter, Bolivia contends that the Claimant should have reasonably foreseen that the Antimony Smelter could have been reverted \"for lack of production.\"208 According to the Claimant, although the terms of reference for the public tender indicated the transfer to a company \"with certain capacities that would permit the smelter to continue production,\" there was no contractual obligation in the purchase agreement, and Bolivia's technical advisers had indicated that the operation of the Antimony Smelter had not been commercially viable since 1999.209\n\nBolivia's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 421-423. See also Terms of Reference for the Second Public Tender for the Antimony Smelter, 31 July 2000, p. 9, **R-109**.\n\nClaimant's Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 237 and 238; Antimony Smelter Purchase Agreement, 11 January 2002, Clause 4, \"Object,\" **C-9**; Paribas, Privatisation of Bolivian mining assets, Confidential Information Memorandum, 16 August 1999, p. 60, **RPA-4**.\n\n165.\n\nAt the outset, the Tribunal again notes that neither Glencore International nor Glencore Bermuda participated in the process of privatization of the Antimony Smelter. When Glencore International acquired the Antimony Smelter it was already inactive.210 The Respondent only raised this issue in the reversion decree of 2010.211 Thus, it could not have been reasonably foreseeable that a dispute would arise on that basis. Moreover, the issue of whether the Claimant had a contractual obligation to put the smelter into production is something disputed among the Parties;212 this relates to a purely contractual dispute which could, in any case, have been addressed pursuant to the dispute settlement provisions provided for in the purchase agreement,213 which are also the dispute settlement provisions invoked as grounds for dismissal in the present case.\n\n*See* Villavicencio First Witness Statement, \u00b6 94, indicating \"[e]xcept for three months in 2002 [\u2026] the plant was out of operations (as the low price of antimony generated a shortage of raw material necessary for the smelting) .\"\n\nSupreme Decree No. 499, *Gaceta Oficial* No 127NEC, 1 May 2010, p. 2, **C-26**. The Tribunal notes that besides lack of production, another reason stated for reversion was that the privatization process of the Tin Smelter had breached several legal provisions.\n\nOn one hand, Claimant argues that \"the Antimony Smelter Purchase Agreement provided for the unconditional transfer of property in exchange for consideration; thus, all obligations were extinguished upon closing.\" Claimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6 115. On the other hand, Bolivia argues that \"the Contract, read together with the Terms of Reference incorporated therein, clearly specified that the purpose and object of the privatization was to ensure that the Antimony Smelter would be put into production for the economic benefit of the country.\" Bolivia's Rejoinder, \u00b6 422.\n\nAntimony Smelter Purchase Agreement, 11 January 2002, Clause 15, **C-9**. See Bolivia's Statement of Defence, \u00b6\u00b6 385-388.\n\nc. The Colquiri Mine\n--------------------\n\n166.\n\nAs to the Colquiri Mine Lease, the Respondent contends that Glencore International was \"aware that there was a reasonable prospect Bolivia would have to intervene in the growing dispute with *cooperativistas* at the Colquiri [M]ine.\"214 According to the Respondent, \"the magnitude and the violence of the 2012 social conflicts that led to the reversion of the [Colquiri] Mine Lease were a by-product of Sinchi Wayra's and Comsur's defective management of the relations with the *cooperativistas.*\"215 The Respondent attributes the problems to two primary causes, the layoff of mine workers when the company was privatized and the fact that the Claimant \"had an unfortunate policy of giving in to all of the *cooperativas*' demands for working areas, and a poor record of ensuring the security of the [Colquiri] Mine.\"216 We recall that our inquiry is limited to the events occurring on or before March 2005. As a result of the privatization of COMIBOL in 2000,217 COMIBOL laid off its employees. The lease agreement did not require Comsur, the private company, to rehire former employees. No contemporaneous document reveals or identifies a problem with the number of employees at the mine when Glencore International acquired it in 2005.\n\nBolivia's Statement of Defence, \u00b6 317.\n\nBolivia's Rejoinder, \u00b6 425.\n\nBolivia's Rejoinder, \u00b6 425.\n\nBolivia's Rejoinder, \u00b6 139; Paribas, Privatisation of Bolivian mining assets, Confidential Information Memorandum, 16 August 1999, p. 118, **RPA-4**.\n\n167.\n\nIn addition, for the purposes of this claim, it is difficult to draw any conclusions from any policy adopted by Glencore International, which had just taken control of the mine, *i.e*., early 2005, or in March 2005, when the restructuring occurred. Concerning whether the problems with *cooperativistas* could have been anticipated, as the Respondent stated \"[i]ndependent mining workers, such as the *subsidiarios*\u2014who, in other regions of Bolivia, were organized in mining cooperatives or *cooperativas mineras\u2014*are a common fixture in the Bolivian mining sector.\"218 Thus, problems with *cooperativistas* were common, and Glencore International specifically identified them during its own due diligence.219 The Claimant indicates that it considered itself to have the \"tools and expertise to continue productive dialogue\" as had been previously done.220 Moreover, the working areas and matters related to *cooperativistas* were not issues that only the company had to deal with; they had to be dealt with also by the government, in particular COMIBOL.221 Since the company was privatized in 2000, areas of the mine have been assigned to *cooperativistas*, and all of these assignments have been authorized by the Government.222 Thus, at least until Glencore Bermuda acquired the Colquiri Mine Lease, the company and the Bolivian government appeared to have handled *cooperativistas* issues satisfactorily.\n\nBolivia's Statement of Defence, \u00b6 33.\n\n\"They have a big issue with 'cooperativistas' who are working in the same veins but in the upper part of the mine. At any time the cooperativistas can be take over [sic] the mine and stop activities. It's very important maintain [sic] a good relationship with them to work without any difficulty. In the last twelve month [sic] they have caused labour strikes totaling [sic] 30 days in which the mine is closed down\", Glencore Internal Memo, 2004, p. 6, **R-302**. Bolivia's Rejoinder, \u00b6 137.\n\n\"We have known the current management of Minera for many years and believe them to be highly competent. Operating costs of the mines are some of the lowest our technicians have encountered at similar size operations in South America. There is no history of labour relations problems within the company. Relations with the surrounding communities and cooperative miners continue to be a delicate issue throughout the region, but are handled extremely well by management.\" Glencore inter office correspondence from Mr. Eskdale to Mr. Strothotte and Mr. Glasenberg, 20 October 2004, p. 4, **C-196**.

According to the standard established by the *Philip Morris* tribunal, if a dispute could have been anticipated at the time of restructuring, an investigation into the reasons for restructuring is required. While such an investigation is not needed here, the Tribunal believes that two particular aspects of the reorganization demonstrate the absence of an abuse of process.\n\n169.\n\n*First,* the Parties disagree as to whether Glencore International could have also invoked the bilateral investment treaty between Bolivia and Switzerland.223 The Respondent asserts that Glencore International lacks standing under this bilateral investment treaty because the interests of \"Glencore International are not substantially Swiss, but instead a range of global funds primarily from the United States.\"224 In contrast, the Claimant alleges that \"at the time of acquisition, Glencore International was not only incorporated in Switzerland, but was held in its entirety by two other Swiss companies (Glencore Holding AG and Glencore LTE AG). Glencore International therefore had a substantial Swiss interest, making it a qualified investor under Article 1(b) [*sic*] the Swiss-Bolivia BIT.\"225 It is not within our mandate to determine whether Glencore International would have had standing under the Switzerland-Bolivia bilateral investment treaty. In fact, in this case, the Respondent is also arguing that the Claimant can't bring claims under the Treaty.226 Notwithstanding this, the fact that the Switzerland-Bolivia bilateral investment treaty may have been an option for Glencore International to challenge the underlying measures undermines the Respondent's claim that the restructuring was performed to gain protection under the Treaty.\n\nBolivia's Rejoinder, \u00b6 390; Claimant's Reply, \u00b6 212 and Claimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6 61.\n\nBolivia's Rejoinder, \u00b6 390.\n\nClaimant's Reply, fn. 561.\n\nWe note as well that this would seem to contradict the first statements made by Bolivia as to the investors being: \"purely swiss in substantive reality\" under the \"[p]iercing the veil\" claim. Bolivia's Statement of Defence, \u00b6 349.\n\n170.\n\n*Second*, as to the reasons for restructuring, the Claimant argues that it was done in order \"to maximize cash-flows while taking advantage of significant financing benefits received by companies incorporated in Bermuda\", that Glencore Bermuda \"has historically been the holding company for the vast majority of Glencore International's investments, including those in Latin America\"227 and that it \"was the designated vehicle used by the Glencore group at the time for issuing senior notes to US institutional investors.\"228 On the contrary, the Respondent argues that Glencore Bermuda was used \"as a vehicle for the transfer of the purchase price to Glencore International's legal counsel in the transaction.\"229\n\nEskdale Second Witness Statement, \u00b6 17; Claimant's Reply, \u00b6 62.\n\nEskdale Second Witness Statement, \u00b6 17; 2007-2008 Glencore Bermuda Financial Statements, 31 December 2008, **C-94**; Glencore Bermuda's Financial Statements for the years ending December 31, 2011 and 2010, 31 December 2011, **C-246**.\n\nBolivia's Rejoinder, \u00b6 428.\n\n171.\n\nIt is uncontested that the restructuring involved a corporate decision by Glencore International. What is not clear from the record is that obtaining standing was one of the underlying motives for the restructuring. Further, the creation of Glencore Bermuda was not contemporaneous with the relevant date (*i.e.*, March 2005) and the relevant Assets are not the only ones held by Glencore Bermuda.230 These facts also undermine the Respondent's argument.\n\n\"[S]ince its incorporation in 1993, Glencore Bermuda was and continues to be an entity that manages a diverse, multi-billion dollar portfolio of operations and investments around the world for the entire Glencore group and secures financing for that portfolio. In fact, Glencore Bermuda continues to hold mining investments in Bolivia (which are not part of this arbitration) for these very same reasons.\" Eskdale Second Witness Statement, \u00b6 18. By way of example, Claimant refers to its Financial Statements for 2007, indicating investments worth approximately US$3.28 billion and total assets held worth US$9.72 billion. 2007-2008 Glencore Bermuda Financial Statements, 31 December 2008, **C-94**. See also Glencore Bermuda's Financial Statements for the years ending 31 December 2011 and 2010, 31 December 2011, **C-246.**\n\n172.\n\nIn light of the above, the Tribunal rejects the Respondent's objections on abuse of process.\n\n**4. Whether the Tribunal is Precluded From Hearing the Case on Account of the Illegality of the Privatizations and the Unclean Hands Principle**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n173.\n\nThe Respondent alleges that \"[t]he privatization process for the Assets was riddled with illegalities\"231 and the \"circumstances surrounding the privatization [\u2026] were contrary to basic requirements of transparency and good faith.\"232 Particularly, Bolivia alleges that \"[t]he legal framework for the privatizations of the Colquiri Mine Lease and the Antimony Smelter was established by former Bolivian President S\u00e1nchez De Lozada to benefit his own economic interests, in violation of the constitutional requirement of impartiality\" and \"the prices received in the privatizations were inexplicably low.\"233 On this basis, Bolivia claims that, pursuant to the \"clean hands\" principle, the \"Claimant cannot present for adjudication before this Tribunal claims tainted by an illegality which Claimant was aware of when it received the Assets.\"234\n\nBolivia's Statement of Defence, \u00b6 326.\n\nBolivia's Statement of Defence, \u00b6 337; Bolivia's Rejoinder, \u00b6 504. Bolivia indicates this was done disregarding the \"principle that public patrimony must be protected\". See also Bolivia's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 99, 330.\n\nBolivia's Statement of Defence, \u00b6 326. In the case of the Colquiri Mine Lease, Respondent indicates that it was awarded \"for free, and only in exchange for a small investment commitment during the first two years of operations.\" See Bolivia's Statement of Defence, \u00b6 335.\n\nBolivia's Statement of Defence, \u00b6 338.\n\n174.\n\nOn the other hand, the Claimant counters that it \"did not commit any illegal act in making its investment\", that \"privatization was carried out in a transparent process that required good faith participation by each bidder, and prices were determined in accordance with the legal framework then in place\", and that \"the unclean hands doctrine does not exist as a general principle of international law.\"235\n\nClaimant's Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 273, 280, 287.\n\n**A. Analysis by the Tribunal**\n-------------------------------\n\n175.\n\nWe begin by observing that the Treaty contains no \"illegality clause\". The Tribunal is also aware that different tribunals have characterized this \"principle\" as \"unclean hands,\"236 \"good faith,\"237 \"*Nemo Auditur Propiam Turpitudinem Allegans*\"238 or \"ex turpi causa non.\"239 Tribunals have also made clear that it only applies in \"particularly serious cases\"240 or where there is a \"serious violation of the legal order\"241 and when it is \"evident that its act had a fraudulent origin.\"242 As stated in our bifurcation decision, the Tribunal would not only have to accept this principle and determine its status (absent an express provision in the Treaty243), but also lay out its contours. Before doing so, the Tribunal must determine whether the investment was made through illegal, fraudulent, or corrupt means, which could render the investment illegal.\n\n*Churchill Mining PLC and Planet Mining Pty Ltd v.

The Relevant Time for Assessment of Illegality*\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n176.\n\nThe Claimant contends that the relevant time for assessment is when the investment was made, namely March 2005.244 The Respondent, on the other hand, alleges that examination \"is not limited to the time of the acquisition of the Assets by Glencore International\".245 The Respondent alleges \"that Glencore International knew\u2014or, at the very least, should have known\u2014at the time it acquired the Assets that they had previously been State-owned and had passed into private property through highly irregular and publicly contested privatization processes.\"246 The Tribunal considers it useful to adopt the Respondent's approach to determine whether the \"Claimant's claims are tainted with illegality and thus fall outside the scope of the Tribunal's jurisdiction.\"247 Regarding the analysis of the facts, we consider the approach of the *Churchill Mining* tribunal to be helpful and will therefore examine first \"the *seriousness* of the fraud [illegality], next the *role* of the disputing parties or third parties in relation to the fraud, then the *nexus* between the fraud and the claims, and finally, the *time* when the fraud was committed.\"248\n\nClaimant's Reply, \u00b6 277.\n\nBolivia's Rejoinder, \u00b6 514.

Republic of Indonesia*, ICSID Case No. ARB/12/14 and 12/40, Award, 6 December 2016, \u00b6 494, **RLA-25**.\n\n*ii. Seriousness of the Illegality*\n-----------------------------------\n\n177.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, former President S\u00e1nchez de Lozada, acted with bias and partially \"by taking advantage of his position in order to implement the policies that would later on allow him to expand his mining operations, in complete disregard of the public interest.\"249 The Respondent basically argues that there is an ethical violation by the former President when he allegedly established a framework from which he would later gain a benefit. Bolivia does not contend that such behavior constituted an *illegal conduct* but rather that it was \"highly inappropriate\"250 and disregarded \"*the collective interest*\".251\n\nBolivia's Statement of Defence, \u00b6 328. See also Bolivia's Rejoinder, \u00b6 527.\n\nBolivia's Rejoinder, \u00b6 70.\n\nConstitution of Bolivia of 1967, Art. 43, **R-3** (unofficial translation). See Bolivia's Statement of Defence, \u00b6 327.\n\n178.\n\nIn this regard, even if a \"highly inappropriate\" and unethical behavior could rise to a level of illegality, the evidence on the record does not support a finding of such type of conduct. The Assets were privatized through a general legal framework applicable to all industries,252 which also involved the legislative branch, as the Claimant correctly notes. In fact, it is uncontested that former President S\u00e1nchez de Lozada was neither in office when the Assets were privatized,253 nor was he involved in the Assets acquisition [REDACTED].254 In addition, the Bolivian Public Servants Liability Regulation stipulates a comprehensive investigation procedure when allegations of violation are made, such as requiring an opinion from the *Contralor General de la Rep\u00fablica* in the case of civil responsibility and an accusation from government officials with knowledge of the illegal acts in the case of criminal responsibility.255 There is neither an allegation nor a proceeding brought pursuant to this statute against ex-president S\u00e1nchez de Lozada.\n\nClaimant's Reply, \u00b6 279.\n\nClaimant's Reply, \u00b6 279 and Claimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6 192.\n\n[REDACTED]\n\nSupreme Decree No. 2.3318-A, 3 November 1992, Art. 50-62, **R-237**.\n\n179.\n\nWith respect to the Assets, according to the Respondent those \"were also privatized contrary to the basic requirements of transparency and good faith, without regard to the protection of the public patrimony, and disregarding the basic principle of administrative law according to which the administration acts in the best interest of the State.\"256 The Respondent contests the terms and conditions of the Colquiri Mine Lease, as well as the amounts paid for the Tin and Antimony Smelters. Lastly, it alleges that \"the Assets were privatized without seeking congressional approval pursuant to Article 59(5) of the 1967 Constitution.\"257\n\nBolivia's Rejoinder, \u00b6 528.\n\nBolivia's Rejoinder, \u00b6 530.\n\n180.\n\nThe Tribunal has difficulty grappling with Bolivia's claims because it is being asked to make a finding on \"principles\" of \"transparency and good faith\", \"protection of the public patrimony of the State\" or \"efficiency\"258 that are not attached to any concrete legal obligation. Moreover, in this instance, all legal steps and formalities were observed in the bidding processes and there is no evidence of an administrative or judicial determination by Bolivian authorities that such procedures were in fact illegal.\n\nBolivia's Statement of Defence, \u00b6\u00b6 330 and 332.\n\n181.\n\nThe Tribunal faces the same problem when trying to address the allegations that the acquisition of the mine lease was \"irregular\" and \"under very favourable conditions\"259 or that the Smelters were sold at an \"inexplicably low price\".260 Since the allegations relate directly to the terms or conditions under which the Assets were awarded, the fact that the bidding processes complied with the applicable legal framework (including the fact that the sale contracts were sanctioned by Bolivian State agencies) and the fact that no aspect related to or in connection with these processes has been challenged before any court or tribunal mean that the allegations that these processes were irregular or awarded under very questionable terms and conditions are without merit. The same holds true for the allegation of a violation of Article 59(5) of the Bolivian Constitution for failing to seek approval from the legislature. The Tribunal recognizes that this point is debatable from a legal standpoint, but even if it were true, we do not see how this would amount to a finding of illegality for all bidding processes, especially since this issue was not raised until this arbitration.261 It is important to note that the purchase agreements and the Colquiri Mine Lease expressly indicated that: \"all measures and formalities required in the Republic of Bolivia have been adopted and fulfilled\" and \"[t]he [seller] has obtained the contractually and legally required authorizations to transfer to the [purchaser] the [assets and rights].\"262 For all of the above reasons, we fail to see any basis that would support an irregularity finding in the bidding processes of the Assets.\n\nBolivia's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 74 and 78.\n\nBolivia's Statement of Defence, \u00b6 326 and Bolivia's Rejoinder, \u00b6 659.\n\n\"*[A]uthorize and approve [\u2026] contracts concerning the exploitation of national resources*\" (unofficial translation). 1967 Constitution, Art. 59(5), **R-3**.

The Tribunal is once again puzzled by the fact that the Respondent places the burden on the Claimant to \"demonstrate that Bolivia gave it any assurances regarding the validity or legality of the privatizations.\"265 Nevertheless, given that the bidding processes were conducted in accordance with the applicable law, that no challenge to such processes was filed for at least 3 years after the privatization of the Assets, and that it was Bolivian Government officials who allegedly committed the irregular acts, it was for the Respondent to produce some evidence indicating that the Claimant should have been aware of these irregularities regarding the privatization of the Assets.\n\nBolivia's Statement of Defence, \u00b6 346.\n\nBolivia's Statement of Defence, \u00b6 346.

In *Anderson v. Costa Rica*, for instance, the courts of Costa Rica found \"after a lengthy and extensive legal process\" that the third party involved \"committed aggravated fraud and illegal financial intermediation\"266 or in *Churchill Mining* the third party and the investor \"were closely associated and [] they liaised regularly during the relevant time.\"267 On the basis of the record, the Tribunal is unable to agree with the Respondent that the Claimant knew or \"should have known\" of any alleged irregularity in the bidding processes.\n\n*Alsadair Ross Anderson v. Republic of Costa Rica*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/07/3, Award, 19 May 2010, \u00b6 55, **RLA-147**.\n\n*Churchill Mining PLC and Planet Mining Pty Ltd v. Republic of Indonesia,* ICSID Case No ARB/12/14 and 12/40, Award, 6 December 2016, \u00b6 474, **RLA-25**.\n\n184.\n\nIn light of these findings, we do not believe it necessary to discuss whether and on what basis the principle of illegality would apply to the Treaty. Even if, for completion's sake, this Tribunal were to address the rest of the elements under the analysis set out by the *Churchill Mining* tribunal, the Tribunal is not convinced that any of the other elements would be able to compensate this elemental flaw, considering in particular the participation of Bolivian government officials in the bidding processes, the non-participation of the Claimant and the timing of the bidding processes, all of which have already been discussed.\n\n**5. Whether the Tribunal Lacks Jurisdiction Due to the ICC Arbitration Clause**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n185.\n\nThe Respondent argues that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction to hear the claims since they \"ultimately arise out of and concern the validity, compliance with, and fulfilment of the contracts [concerning the Assets],\"268 and these contracts contain specific provisions ensuring that \"any dispute\" related \"directly or indirectly\" to the contracts will be submitted to arbitration administered by the ICC while precluding recourse to other kinds of dispute resolution.269 The Respondent also claims that the provisions \"displace\" the Treaty's dispute resolution provisions.\n\nBolivia's Statement of Defence, \u00b6 385.\n\nBolivia's Statement of Defence, \u00b6\u00b6 386, 387; Bolivia's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 568 and 569.\n\n186.\n\nIn general terms, the Respondent considers that the reversion of the Tin Smelter was based on the fact that the contract was affected by illegalities, that the reversion of the Antimony Smelter was based on a contractual breach by the Claimant's inactivity and that the issue concerning the Colquiri Mine Lease is whether Bolivia complied with its contractual obligations.270 The Claimant on the other hand contends that it has not raised \"claims of contractual breach\", that \"Bolivia cannot seek to avoid its international obligations under the Treaty by labelling this dispute as contractual\" and that \"[i]f Bolivia truly believed that the instant disputes were governed by mandatory ICC arbitration clauses it should have challenged any purported acts or omissions of Glencore Bermuda's subsidiaries in accordance to the [c]ontracts\".271\n\nBolivia's Statement of Defence, \u00b6\u00b6 396-399; Bolivia's Rejoinder, \u00b6 567.\n\nClaimant's Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 320, 329-330. See also Claimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6 249.\n\n**A. Analysis by the Tribunal**\n-------------------------------\n\n187.\n\nWe begin our analysis by recalling the text of Article 8 of the Treaty on dispute settlement, which establishes the following:\n\nDisputes between a national or company of one Contracting Party and the other Contracting Party concerning an obligation of the latter under this Agreement in relation to an investment of the former which have not been legally and amicably settled shall after a period of six months from written notification of a claim be submitted to international arbitration if either party to the dispute so wishes. [\u2026]\n\n188.\n\nThe Tribunal is satisfied that this provision forms the basis of our mandate. Moreover, we believe that the allegations raised by the Claimant since the Notice of Arbitration pertain to \"obligations\" under this Treaty, in particular, under Articles 2(2) and 5. In this sense, while there may have been disagreements between Glencore Bermuda and Bolivia regarding the terms of the contracts governing the Assets, this is not a concern of ours;272 *this* arbitration concerns specific obligations regarding an *investment* in respect of a treaty claim. Whether the investment was made pursuant to a contract or not has no bearing on the dispute's status as a treaty dispute, regardless of whether the contract stipulated another forum for dispute resolution or renounced a specific forum.\n\nIn this regard, we agree with the opinions expressed in *SGS v. Pakistan* and *Impregi/o v. Pakistan* that: \"[a]s a matter of general principle, the same set of facts can give rise to different claims grounded on differing legal orders: the municipal and the international legal orders\". *SGS Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9ra/e de Survei//ance SA v. Is/amic Repub/ic of Pakistan,* ICSID Case No ARB/01/13. Decision of the Tribunal on Objections to Jurisdiction, 6 August 2003, \u00b6 147, **CLA-151**; and \"[C]ontrary to Pakistan's approach in this case, the fact that a breach may give rise to a contract claim does not mean that it cannot also - and separately - give rise2 to a treaty claim. Even if the two perfectly coincide, they remain analytically distinct, and necessarily require different enquiries.\" *Impregi/o SpA v. Is/amic Repub/ic of Pakistan,* ICSID Case No ARB/03/3, Decision on Jurisdiction, 22 April 2005, \u00b6 258, **CLA-159**.\n\n189.\n\nIn addition, it is well established in investment case law that a contractual provision on forum selection cannot as such deprive a tribunal of jurisdiction over a treaty claim.273 For these reasons, we reject Respondent's argument that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction due to the ICC arbitration clause.\n\n*SGS Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9ra/e de Survei//ance SA v.

Whether the Tribunal Lacks Jurisdiction Over the Tin Stock Claims**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n190.\n\nThe Respondent argues that the Claimant did not notify it as to the potential claims over the Tin Stock pursuant to Article 8(1) of the Treaty, making it impossible for the State to \"seek amicable resolution or to provide redress\".274 According to the Respondent, none of the notices \"make even a single reference to the Tin Stock, much less to Claimant's intention to bring claims regarding the reversion of the Tin Stock\".275 On the other hand, the Claimant alleges that Bolivia was \"fully on notice of the Tin Stock claims six years prior to the filing of the Notice of Arbitration\", that it \"has had ample opportunity to settle all of these claims\" and that \"forcing Glencore Bermuda back into amicable settlement talks would be an absurd outcome\".276\n\nBolivia's Statement of Defence, \u00b6\u00b6 400 and 402.\n\nBolivia's Statement of Defence, 408. See generally Bolivia's Statement of Defence, \u00b6\u00b6 400-411.\n\nClaimant's Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 312, 319.\n\n**A. Analysis by the Tribunal**\n-------------------------------\n\n191.\n\nArticle 8(1) of the Treaty provides: \"[d]isputes between a national or company of one Contracting Party and the other Contracting Party [\u2026] which have not been legally and amicably settled shall after a period of six months *from written notification of a claim* be submitted to international arbitration [\u2026]\" (emphasis added). The Treaty contains no further obligation or indication as to the notification except stipulating the form (written) and the need for communication of a *claim.*\n\n192.\n\nThe purpose of this provision and notice requirements in investment treaties in general \"is to allow negotiations between the parties which may lead to a settlement.\"277 In the present case, the Antimony Smelter Reversion Decree was published on 1 May 2010 ordering the reversion of the Antimony Smelter and \"all of its assets\".278 The record indicates that on 3 May 2010, Colquiri informed the Ministry of Mining that the Tin Stock stored in the Antimony Smelter was not included in the assets and requested its delivery.279 Two days later, the Ministry of Mining recognized the stock was not part of the \"assets\" and requested to EMV to return it.280\n\n*Bayindir Insaat Turizm Ticaret Ve Sanayi A\u015e v. Islamic Republic of Pakistan*, ICSID Case No ARB/03/29, Decision on Jurisdiction, 14 November 2005, \u00b6 98, **CLA-60**.\n\nSupreme Decree No 499, *Gaceta Oficial* No 127NEC, 1 May 2010, **C-26**.\n\nLetter from Colquiri SA (Mr. Capriles) to Minister of Mining (Mr. Pimentel), 3 May 2010, **C-28.**\n\nLetter from Ministry of Mining (Mr. Pimentel) to EMV (Mr. Villavicencio), 5 May 2010, **C-29**. The record contains another letter from Colquiri to the Ministry of Mining indicating that EMV had not complied with the instruction to return the Tin Stock. Letter from Colquiri (Mr. Capriles) to the Minister of Mining (Mr. Pimentel), 10 May 2010, **C-99.**\n\n193.\n\nOn 19 May 2010, Colquiri once again requested EMV to return the Tin Stock and indicated that \"any act of disposition or use not consented by our company of the tin concentrates [\u2026] may give rise to additional legal responsibilities. Such concentrates were not affected by the nationalization\".281 On 7 June 2010, Colquiri sent a letter to the Ministry of Mining requesting once more restitution of the Tin Stock and indicated the following:\n\nOur intention has been [...] to mitigate or avoid damages to [Colquiri], that would subsequently have to be repaired by the Bolivian State. [\u2026] We want to inform you that we have also brought the case to the attention of our lawyers, local and foreign, so that they can advise us on the best legal measures to follow.282\n\nLetter from Colquiri (Mr. Capriles) to EMV (Mr. Villavicencio), 19 May 2010, **C-100** (unofficial translation).\n\nLetter from Colquiri (Mr. Capriles) to the Minister of Mining (Mr. Pimentel), 7 June 2010, **C-101** (unofficial translation). The Tribunal notes this letter expresses \"willingness to discuss in the meetings\" (Unofficial translation) that the Minister would arrange between the Parties.\n\n194.\n\nFinally, on 8 June 2010, the State company EMV informed Colquiri that the Tin Stock was:\n\n[C]onsidered as an asset of the antimony smelter as it was located on its premises at the time of nationalization. Concentrates that will surely not be disposed of in any way until the negotiations that must be carried out between the State and the Company you represent are concluded.283\n\nLetter from EMV (Mr. Villavicencio) to Colquiri (Mr. Capriles), 8 June 2010, p. 2, **C-102**.\n\n195.\n\nThe Tribunal is not able to agree with the Respondent that it was not notified of a dispute involving the Tin Stock. Even though the letters were from Colquiri, the Tribunal finds it hard to believe that Bolivia was unaware of the corporate structure including Colquiri and Glencore Bermuda, especially in light of the Assets' reversions made by the State. After nine years of negotiations, we find it even more difficult to believe that the Respondent is oblivious of the scope of the potential dispute.284 Furthermore, this Tribunal cannot disregard the fact that EMV considered the Tin Stock to be an asset of the Antimony Smelter and included it within the scope of \"negotiations\".\n\nWe disagree with Respondent's assertion that: \"Claimant had some five years to submit a notice of a dispute concerning *an entirely different asset* from those of its other claims, but elected not to do so\" (emphasis added). Bolivia's Rejoinder, \u00b6 620.\n\n196.\n\nIn light of the above, we reject the Respondent's objection that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction over the Tin Stock claims.\n\n**VI. MERITS OF THE DISPUTE**\n-----------------------------\n\n**1. Expropriation Claim**\n--------------------------\n\n197.\n\nWe turn now to the merits of the dispute. The Claimant argues that \"Bolivia deprived Glencore Bermuda of title, ownership and control over the Tin Smelter, the Antimony Smelter, the Tin Stock and the Colquiri [Mine] Lease\" and therefore, \"completely destroyed the value of Glencore Bermuda's shares in Vinto and Colquiri [\u2026] depriving Glencore Bermuda of the value of its investments\". The Claimant contends that \"through its measures Bolivia effected a direct and an indirect expropriation of [its] investments\".285 According to the Claimant, Bolivia breached Article 5 of the Treaty by: (i) not paying just and effective compensation, promptly and without delay and (ii) expropriating without due process of law.286\n\nClaimant's Reply, \u00b6 344. See also Statement of Claim, \u00b6 148.\n\nStatement of Claim, \u00b6\u00b6 150-176.\n\n198.\n\nThe Respondent on the other hand, contends that \"[t]he reversions were not expropriations but legitimate exercises of police powers in the public interest,\"287 \"taken to enforce law, public order, and safety within its territory\".288 As to the Assets which are the object of this dispute, Bolivia alleges the following: (i) the Tin Smelter \"was reverted because it was *illegally privatized*\", (ii) the Antimony Smelter was reverted \"because of a breach of the basic *contractual commitment* to put the Smelter into production\", and (iii) the Colquiri Mine Lease was reverted \"in order to restore *public order and safety* following a massive conflict\".289 Finally, the Respondent argues that even if its reversions were to be considered expropriations, they are lawful, as \"the provision is breached only for failure to pay upon conclusion of negotiations and this arbitration\".290It is clear from the Parties' submissions that they disagree not only on the nature of the act but on whether such act breached the Treaty. We will address both issues below.\n\nBolivia's Rejoinder, \u00b6 634.\n\nBolivia's Statement of Defence, \u00b6 444.\n\nBolivia's Statement of Defence, \u00b6 444 (emphasis added).\n\nBolivia's Statement of Defence, \u00b6 481.\n\n**A. The Expropriation Standard Under Article 5 of the Treaty**\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\n199.\n\nWe begin our analysis with the text of the provision at issue. Article 5 of the Treaty contains two paragraphs which provide as follows:\n\n(1) Investments of nationals or companies of either Contracting Party *shall not* be nationalised, expropriated or subjected to measures having effect equivalent to nationalisation or expropriation (hereinafter referred to as \"expropriation\") in the territory of the other Contracting Party *except for a public purpose and for a social benefit related to the internal needs of that Party and against just and effective compensation.* Such compensation shall amount to the market value of the investment expropriated immediately before the expropriation or before the impending expropriation became public knowledge, whichever is the earlier, shall include interest at a normal commercial or legal rate, whichever is applicable in the territory of the expropriating Contracting Party, until the date of payment, *shall be made without delay*, be *effectively realizable* and be *freely transferable*. The national or company affected *shall have the right* to establish promptly by due process of law in the territory of the Contracting Party making the expropriation the legality of the expropriation and the amount of the compensation in accordance with the principle set out in this paragraph.\n\n(2) Where a Contracting Party expropriates the assets of a company which is incorporated or constituted under the law in force in any part of its own territory, and in which nationals or companies of the other Contracting Party own shares, *it shall ensure* that the *provisions of paragraph (1) of this Article are applied* to the extent necessary to *guarantee prompt, adequate and effective compensation* in respect of their investment to such nationals or companies of the other Contracting Party who are owners of those shares.\n\n(emphasis added)\n\n200.\n\nFrom the outset, the language \"*shall not*\" imposes a clear obligation not to expropriate investments. Moreover, the text clearly seeks to encompass different measures that a State may take such as nationalizations, expropriations or measures having an *effect equivalent* to those categories, *i.e.*, indirect expropriations. Therefore, regardless of how a measure is labeled, it is covered by this provision and equated to \"expropriation\". Unlike other treaties, the Treaty in this case does not contain language referring to the State's right to exercise its police powers. Nevertheless, the existence of the police powers doctrine in customary international law is now widely accepted and plays an important role to ensure that possible findings of indirect deprivations of property do not prevent host States from adopting legitimate and general regulatory measures. Measures which fall within the scope of the police powers doctrine are therefore understood not to be expropriatory in nature, with the result that there is no need to consider the conditions of legality.291\n\nAs explained in *Philip Morris Brand S\u00e0rl, Philip Morris Products S.A. and Abal Hermanos S.A. v. Oriental Republic of Uruguay*, ICSID Case No. ARB/10/7, Award, \u00b6 295, **RLA-43**. This position has also been accepted by a number of other tribunals *e.g*. *Methanex Corporation v. USA*, NAFTA/UNCITRAL, Final Award on Jurisdiction and Merits, 3 August 2005, Part IV, Chapter D, \u00b6 7, **RLA-45**.\n\n201.\n\nArticle 5 also includes criteria which must be met in order for any expropriation to be legal: the expropriation is taken for a \"*public purpose*\" and for a \"*social benefit*\" related to the internal needs of the State,292 and is accompanied by \"just and effective compensation\". Only if these legality requirements are not met is there a breach of Article 5. We do not consider it necessary to address the right to establish promptly by due process of law the legality of the expropriation or the amount of the compensation.293 There is a clear overlap between the police powers doctrine and the \"public purpose\" condition of legality in Article 5 of the Treaty, but the two are not identical. For instance, a measure that is specific rather than general in nature may fall outside of the police powers doctrine, but still meet the \"public purpose and social benefit\" requirement of legality in Article 5. Further, the two issues fall to be considered at different stages of the analysis. Whereas the police powers doctrine is relevant when determining whether an expropriation has taken place, the \"public purpose\" criterion in Article 5 is relevant at the later stage of assessing the legality of any identified expropriation.\n\nAs to the compensation, Article 5 imposes other obligations that must be observed. [It] \"shall *amount* to the *market value* of the investment expropriated\", it \"shall include *interest* at a normal commercial or legal rate\", [it] \"shall be made *without delay*\", \"be *effectively realizable* and be *freely transferable*\". UK-Bolivia Treaty, 24 May 1988 (emphasis added), **C-1**.\n\nWhile we do not take further our analysis, the Tribunal does point out that the text of Article 5(1) does not mention whether the process should be prior. It only establishes as conditions to expropriate that the measure is for: *(i) a public purpose* and *social benefit* and, *(ii)* against *just and effective compensation*. While Claimant relies on *ADC v. Hungary*, we note that in that case, Article 4 of the BIT precisely provided that \"the measures are taken in the public interest *and under due process of law*\" (emphasis added). The tribunal in *Rurelec*, also indicated that the UK-Bolivia BIT (unlike the US-Bolivia BIT which contains a similar provision to the one in *ADC v. Hungary*) \"does not explicitly establish due process as a precondition for the expropriation of an investment.\" *Guaracachi America, Inc and Rurelec Plc v. Plurinational State of Bolivia*, UNCITRAL, Award, 31 January 2014, \u00b6 439, **CLA-120**.\n\n202.\n\nIn light of this, the Tribunal agrees with the argument advanced by the Respondent that a finding that the relevant measures fell within the scope of the police powers doctrine would lead to the conclusion that the Respondent's actions are not contrary to Article 5 of the Treaty and do not give rise to an obligation to pay compensation. In other words, if the measures do fall within the scope of the doctrine, no expropriation has occurred and so no issue of compensation arises.\n\n203.\n\nThe Tribunal will first consider whether an expropriation has occurred. The analysis depends on two distinct issues. *First,* the Tribunal will assess whether the Respondent has deprived the Claimant of its rights relating to the investment. *Second*, the Tribunal will determine whether the relevant act or measure falls within the scope of the police powers doctrine. If any measure falls outside the scope of the doctrine, the Tribunal will then consider the requirements of legality in Article 5 of the Treaty, namely (i) whether the expropriation was carried out \"for a public purpose and for a social benefit related to the internal needs\" of Bolivia, and (ii) whether Bolivia paid \"just and effective compensation\", defined in the Treaty as \"the market value of the investment expropriated immediately before the expropriation or before the impeding expropriation became public knowledge, whichever is the earlier\".\n\n**B. Whether Bolivia's Reversions Breach Article 5 of the Treaty**\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n204.\n\nIn order to analyze Bolivia's reversions, we must examine the specific documents they stem from and determine whether they comply with the legal standard aforementioned. These decrees are the source and main foundation of the acts (*i.e.,* the reversions).\n\n*i. Supreme Decree No. 29,026 (The Tin Smelter Reversion Decree)*294\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSupreme Decree No. 29,026 (the \"**Tin Smelter Reversion Decree**\"), 7 February 2007, published in the *Gaceta Oficial* No. 2,969 on 9 February 2007, **C-20**.\n\na. Whether the Nature of the Measure is an Expropriation\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n205.\n\nAs a starting point, we observe that the Tin Smelter Reversion Decree does not define \"reversion\", nor does it provide a specific legal basis for it.295 The preamble begins by affirming the right of self-determination and the right to freely dispose of natural resources, and continues to explain that the neoliberal model imposed in Bolivia resulted in the liquidation of State-owned companies. Later on, it indicates that the smelter is the result of a long \"struggle for the economic independence of the country\" and that the government, while exercising a popular mandate on the recovery of natural resources, is \"under the obligation to revert [the smelter] to the State's domain\".296\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the Bolivian Constitution applicable at that time makes no reference to that term. *See* Constitution of Bolivia, 1967, **R-3**. Additionally, while the Bolivian Mining Code refers to \"reversion\", such concept seems to be related to mining concessions and specific situations that produce that effect. Article 65 indicates: \"*Caducidad* [\u2026] produces the *reversion* of the mining concession to the original domain of the State\". Article 67: \"[i]f the concession was declared void ex officio or at the request of a third party, it will *revert* to the original domain of the State.\" Article 86: \"The responsibilities of the concessionaire or mining operator for damage to the environment subsist even after the *reversion* of the mining concession to the original domain of the State.\" Article 95: \"[\u2026] the mining concessions subject of the bidding will *revert* by rule of law to the original domain of the State\" (unofficial translation, emphasis added). Bolivian Mining Code, Law 1,777, 17 March 1997, Arts 65, 67, 95, 155, **R-4**.\n\nSupreme Decree No. 29,026, 7 February 2007, published in the *Gaceta Oficial* No. 2,969 on 9 February 2007, **C-20** (unofficial translation).\n\n206.\n\nThe decree contains only one Article that mandates: \"Complejo Metal\u00fargico Vinto *is reverted* to the *domain* of the Bolivian State, with *all its current assets*, providing that [the State company EMV] *immediately takes* administrative, technical, legal and financial *control* [\u2026]\"297 (emphasis added). The text of the decree leaves no doubt as to the effects of the measure. There was an *effective taking* of Complejo Metal\u00fargico Vinto and its assets that left the Claimant without any type of control or right to dispose of it. As explained in *AES v. Hungary*, \"[f]or an expropriation to occur, it is necessary for the investor to be *deprived*, in whole or significant part, *of the property* in *or effective control* of its investment [\u2026]\"298 (emphasis added). We consider the decree to be an outright seizure, a \"formal deprivation\" of the legal title, \"possession or access to the benefit and economic use of [the] property\".299\n\nSupreme Decree No. 29,026, 7 February 2007, published in the *Gaceta Oficial* No. 2,969 on 9 February 2007, **C-20** (unofficial translation).\n\n*AES Summit Generation Limited and AES-Tisza Er\u00f6m\u00fc Kft v. Republic of Hungary,* ICSID Case No ARB/07/22, Award, 23 September 2010, \u00b6 14.3.1, **CLA-100**.\n\n\"While assumption of control over property by a government does not automatically and immediately justify a conclusion that the *property has been taken by the government*, thus requiring compensation under international law, *such a conclusion is warranted whenever events demonstrate that the owner was deprived of fundamental rights of ownership and it appears that this deprivation is not merely ephemeral*\" (emphasis added). *Tippetts, Abbett, McCarthy, and Stratton v. TAMS-AFFA Consulting Engineers of Iran and others,* Award, 1984, Vol. 6, Iran-US Claims Tribunal Report, 22 June 1984, p. 4, **CLA-9**: \"[a]s is well known, there is a wide spectrum of measures that a state may take in asserting control over property, extending from limited regulation of its use *to a complete and formal deprivation of the owner's legal title*.\" [\u2026] \"There is ample authority for the proposition that *a property has been expropriated* when the *effect* of the measures taken by the state has been to *deprive the owner of title, possession or access to the benefit and economic use of his property*\" (emphasis added). *Compa\u00f1\u00eda del Desarrollo de Santa Elena SA v. Republic of Costa Rica,* ICSID Case No ARB/96/1, Final Award, 17 February 2000, \u00b6\u00b6 76 and 77, **CLA-25**.\n\n207.\n\nMoreover, the Tribunal cannot be blind to the fact that the day the government took physical possession of Vinto, a banner reading \"nationalized\" was affixed on the entrance300 and that former President Morales stated publicly that the decree would \"nationalize Vinto\".301 We concur with Bolivia that \"the fact that a non-lawyer would confuse legal terminology is hardly surprising.\"302 Nonetheless, the opinion of a head of State or a high-ranking government official should carry some weight. In any event, we recall that Article 5 encompasses nationalizations, expropriations and measures with equivalent effect; thus, regardless of the appellation used by the Respondent, the act should be characterized as an expropriation.\n\nPhotos of the Tin Smelter Nationalization, 9 February 2017, pp. 8-9, **C-70**.\n\nEl Pa\u00eds*, Anuncian la nacionalizaci\u00f3n de la fundici\u00f3n de Vinto*, 9 February 2007, **C-226**.\n\nBolivia's Rejoinder, \u00b6 653.\n\n208.\n\nThe Tribunal takes the view that the Tin Smelter Reversion Decree is not a legitimate exercise of the Respondent's police powers. Most obviously, the Tin Smelter Reversion Decree is not characterized as a general regulatory measure, or part of a broader regulatory regime; it affects only the Tin Smelter owned by the Claimant.\n\n209.\n\nIn any case, the Respondent has not furnished the Tribunal with sufficient evidence to conclude that the decree was carried out in pursuit of a legitimate public policy interest. The decree states that the privatization process had violated different rules and legal provisions, that Allied Deals transferred the asset with \"clear fraudulent intent against public interest\" and later on, that there was a popular mandate to recover natural resources.303 The decree also mentions the price at which the asset was transferred was low in comparison with its previous value.\n\nSupreme Decree No. 29,026, 7 February 2007, published in the *Gaceta Oficial* No. 2,969 on 9 February 2007, **C-20** (unofficial translation). See also Bolivia's Statement of Defence, \u00b6\u00b6 444 and 458.\n\n210.\n\nMere assertion alone, however, cannot be sufficient. There is no indication beyond the word \"reverted\" of precisely what power Bolivia was exercising. As previously stated, the decree contains neither a legal basis for the act nor a stated purpose that could be associated with the exercise of police powers. We only have Bolivia's contention in this proceeding that it was something other than an expropriation. No contemporaneous material has been put before us to point to a different purpose. In addition, the justification for the decree is the illegal privatization of the asset, in spite of the lack of a formal declaration of illegality from any Bolivian administrative or judicial authority to date. We recall that the privatization procedure was carried out in accordance with Bolivian law and with the participation of numerous Bolivian officials, such as a Qualifying Commission. In addition, the government was free to accept or reject the minimum price recommendation of its advisor Paribas.304\n\nParibas, Privatisation of Bolivian mining assets, Confidential Information Memorandum, 16 August 1999, pp. 15 and 54, **RPA-04**. \"The Bolivian Government will remain free to follow Paribas' Recommendation or not\"; See also pp. 11 and 51, **RPA-04**.\n\n211.\n\nRegarding this, the Tribunal is not persuaded by the Respondent's contention that \"court proceedings were unnecessary because the matter was resolved by the reversion and [because of] the collapse of Allied Deals.\"305 A claim of illegality, whether made by a government or an investor, must be supported by evidence and not mere allegations. In this instance, the evidence before the Tribunal does not support the conclusion that the decree was intended to be, or was, a valid exercise of police powers.\n\nBolivia's Rejoinder, \u00b6 657.\n\n212.\n\nIt follows that the Tin Smelter Reversion Decree is expropriatory in nature. The Tribunal will therefore proceed to determine whether the requirement of legality set out in Article 5 of the Treaty has been met.\n\nb. The Legality of the Expropriation\n------------------------------------\n\n213.\n\nThe first issue for the Tribunal here is to assess whether the expropriation was carried out for \"a public purpose and for a social benefit\". The Respondent has advanced the same argument here as it did in relation to the police powers doctrine, namely that the decree was necessary to remedy illegalities in the initial privatization process. The considerations outlined above in paragraphs 208-212 therefore apply with equal force here. In the absence of substantive evidence that the initial privatization process was illegal, the Respondent's argument that the Tin Smelter Reversion Decree pursues a public purpose and social benefit will be difficult to sustain.\n\n214.\n\nThis alone is enough for the Tribunal to conclude that the Tin Smelter Reversion Decree breaches Article 5 of the Treaty. However, for the sake of completeness, it should be recognized that, to date, the Respondent has paid no compensation in respect of the Tin Smelter Reversion Decree.\n\n215.\n\nThe Tribunal therefore concludes that the Tin Smelter Reversion Decree is an unlawful expropriation which breaches Article 5 of the Treaty.\n\n*ii. Supreme Decree No. 499 (The Antimony Smelter Reversion Decree)306*\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSupreme Decree No. 499, *Gaceta Oficial* No 127NEC, 1 May 2010, **C-26** (unofficial translation).\n\na. Whether the Nature of the Measure is an Expropriation\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n216.\n\nAs with the Tin Smelter Reversion Decree, the Antimony Smelter Reversion Decree neither defines nor provides a specific legal basis for \"reversion\". The preamble begins by quoting Article 369, paragraph IV of the Bolivian Constitution, which states that \"[t]he State shall exert control and oversight over the entire mining production chain and over the activities performed by the holders of mining rights, mining contracts, or pre-existing rights\".307 It then proceeds to indicate that, in accordance with a \"policy for the recovery of natural resources [\u2026] as well as the restitution of the metallurgic mining industry [\u2026] as one of the fundamental pillars for economic and social development\",308 EMV is a Strategic Nacional Public Company. The decree concludes by discussing the Tin Smelter's production inactivity and the illegality of its privatization.\n\nConstitution of Bolivia, 7 February 2009, Art 369, IV, **C-95** (unofficial Translation). The Tribunal notes that Articles 358 and 401 mention \"reversion\" regarding the use and exploitation of natural resources and social economic function, however, these Articles do not form a basis for the decree and Bolivia has not put forward these provisions as basis for the decree either.\n\nSupreme Decree No. 499, *Gaceta Oficial* No 127NEC, 1 May 2010, **C-26** (unofficial translation).\n\n217.\n\nThe decree contains only one Article pursuant to which the Vinto Antimony Smelter \"*is reverted* to the *domain* of the Plurinational State of Bolivia, with *all its current assets*, providing that [the State company EMV] *immediately takes* administrative, technical, legal and financial *control*\"*.* In the same way as the Tin Smelter Reversion Decree, the text of the Antimony Smelter Reversion Decree constitutes an *effective taking* of the smelter that left the Claimant without any type of control or right to dispose of it. We thus consider both decrees to share the same nature.309\n\nSee *Tippetts, Abbett, McCarthy, and Stratton v. TAMS-AFFA Consulting Engineers of Iran and others,* Award, 1984, Vol. 6, Iran-US Claims Tribunal Report, 22 June 1984, p. 4, **CLA-9**; *Compa\u00f1\u00eda del Desarrollo de Santa Elena SA v. Republic of Costa Rica,* ICSID Case No ARB/96/1, Final Award, 17 February 2000, \u00b6\u00b6 76 and 77, **CLA-25**; *AES Summit Generation Limited and AES-Tisza Er\u00f6m\u00fc Kft v. Republic of Hungary,* ICSID Case No ARB/07/22, Award, 23 September 2010, \u00b6 14.3.1, **CLA-100**.\n\n218.\n\nIn addition, we also note that in a letter from the State company EMV to the Executive President of Colquiri dated 8 June 2010 regarding the tin concentrates stored in the Antimony Smelter, there are multiple references to \"before the nationalization\", \"as consequence of the nationalization\", \"at the time of the nationalization\", and \"regarding the nationalization\" of the Antimony Smelter.310 This confirms, in our view, that even though the measure is termed \"reversion,\" it is in fact an expropriation as defined by Article 5 of the Treaty.\n\nLetter from EMV (Mr. Villavicencio) to Colquiri (Mr. Capriles), 8 June 2010, **C-102** (unofficial Translation).\n\n219.\n\nRegarding the tin concentrates stored in the Antimony Smelter at the time of the reversion, we recall that these concentrates were initially ordered to be returned. In the same letter from the State company EMV to the Executive President of Colquiri, the position taken was that the tin concentrates were \"considered as an asset of the [A]ntimony [S]melter\" because they were \"located on its premises at the time of nationalization.\" Such concentrates would not be disposed of prior to the conclusion of negotiations between the State and the investor.311 As a result, for the purposes of this claim and with regard to the effects of the decree on the Antimony Smelter and the Tin Stock stored there, the tin concentrates must be considered \"assets\" of the smelter which were taken from the Claimant.\n\nLetter from EMV (Mr. Villavicencio) to Colquiri (Mr. Capriles), 8 June 2010, **C-102** (unofficial translation).\n\n220.\n\nSimilar to its argument regarding the Tin Smelter, the Respondent seeks to argue that the Antimony Smelter Reversion Decree falls within the scope of its police powers, and that it was adopted to address the alleged illegalities in the privatization process. However, the Respondent has again failed to provide sufficient evidence of such illegalities, such as complaints raised and brought before a domestic court for judgment.\n\n221.\n\nThe Tribunal also fails to see how the Respondent could claim that it was exercising police powers when the main justification given in the decree itself was the inactivity of the smelter.312 The Respondent argues, regarding the Tin Smelter, that \"the plain text of the Tin Smelter Reversion Decree setting forth the purpose for the reversion, as an official document, is entitled to a presumption of veracity.\"313 While the Tribunal makes no pronouncement on the effect of such a presumption, we do note that the privatization of the Tin Smelter is mentioned in the Antimony Smelter Reversion Decree, meaning that it was also considered a basis for the decision to revert the Antimony Smelter, there otherwise being no discernible reason for its inclusion in the preamble of another decree regarding a different asset.\n\nSupreme Decree No. 499, *Gaceta Oficial* No 127NEC, 1 May 2010, **C-26** (unofficial translation).\n\nBolivia's Rejoinder, \u00b6 656.\n\n222.\n\nConsequently, the Antimony Smelter Reversion Decree is expropriatory in nature.\n\nb. The Legality of the Expropriation\n------------------------------------\n\n223.\n\nAs the Respondent's argument in relation to the \"public purpose\" criterion of legality is identical to its argument on police powers, the same considerations apply here. Without any substantive evidence of a public purpose or social benefit objective, the Tribunal can only conclude that this criterion has not been met. Nor is there any suggestion that compensation has been paid. The decree was published in 2010. It contains only one article, which does not provide for any compensation, and it is uncontested that, to date (13 years later), no compensation has been provided for the taking of *Planta de Vinto Antimonio* and its assets.\n\n224.\n\nWe also recall that 161 tonnes of tin concentrates stored in the smelter were seized. Colquiri informed the Minister of Mining314 of the situation on multiple occasions and requested the return of the stock. According to the record, although the Minister of Mining initially instructed the State company EMV to return the concentrates,315 the stock was not returned and was ultimately considered part of the Antimony Smelter's assets.316 It is not contested that no compensation has been provided for the Tin Stock.\n\nLetter from Colquiri (Mr. Capriles) to Ministry of Mining (Mr. Pimentel), 3 May 2010, **C-28**; Letter from Colquiri (Mr. Hartmann) to the Minister of Mining (Mr. Pimentel), 5 May 2010, **C-98**; Letter from Colquiri (Mr. Capriles) to the Minister of Mining (Mr. Pimentel), 10 May 2010, **C-99**; Letter from Colquiri (Mr. Capriles) to EMV (Mr. Villavicencio), 19 May 2010, **C-100**; Letter from Colquiri (Mr. Capriles) to the Minister of Mining (Mr. Pimentel), 7 June 2010, **C-101**.\n\nLetter from Ministry of Mining (Mr. Pimentel) to EMV (Mr. Villavicencio), 5 May 2010, **C-29**.\n\nLetter from EMV (Mr. Villavicencio) to Colquiri (Mr. Capriles), 8 June 2010, **C-102**.\n\n225.\n\nIn light of this, the Tribunal concludes that the Antimony Smelter Reversion Decree was also an unlawful expropriation which breached Article 5 of the Treaty.\n\n*iii. Supreme Decree No. 1,264 (The Colquiri Mine Reversion Decree)*317\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSupreme Decree No 1,264, *Gaceta Oficial* No 384NEC, 20 June 2012, **C-39**.\n\na. Whether the Measure is in Nature an Expropriation\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n226.\n\nUnlike the other two decrees, the Colquiri Mine Reversion Decree does not mention the word \"reversion\". However, similar to the two other decrees, no specific legal basis is identified. The preamble references three constitutional provisions. The first one is Article 369, which is similarly referenced in the Antimony Smelter Reversion Decree. In the Colquiri Mine Reversion Decree, it mentions all four paragraphs of the Article which, generally speaking, provide that \"[t]he State will be responsible for the mineralogic wealth,\" that \"non-metallic natural resources [\u2026] are of a strategic nature for the country\", that \"[t]he State will be responsible for the direction of the mining and metallurgical policy, as well as for the encouragement, promotion and control of the mining activity\", and that \"[t]he State shall exert control and oversight over the entire mining production chain and over the activities performed by the holders of mining rights, mining contracts, or pre-existing rights\".318 The second provision referred to is paragraph I of Article 349, which establishes that \"[n]atural resources are property of and within the direct, indivisible and imprescriptible domain of the Bolivian people, and their administration will correspond to the State [\u2026]\".319 The last provision, Article 380, concerns to the economic social function of mining contracts.320\n\nConstitution of Bolivia, 7 February 2009, Art 369, **C-95** (unofficial Translation).\n\nConstitution of Bolivia, 7 February 2009, Art 349, **C-95** (unofficial Translation).\n\nConstitution of Bolivia, 7 February 2009, Art 370, **C-95** (unofficial Translation).\n\n227.\n\nThe decree contains 4 Articles. Articles 1 and 2 provide respectively: \"[a]s of the publication of this Supreme Decree [\u2026] COMIBOL [\u2026] *assumes control* over Centro Minero Colquiri, as well as *management and direct administration* of the deposits granted by lease agreement\", and \"COMIBOL will *directly carry out the mining activities* in the deposits granted by lease contract to [Colquiri]\".321 Paragraph III of Article 1 expressly provides that machinery, equipment and supplies of Colquiri are \"*nationalized*\" in favor of COMIBOL. According to Articles 3 and 4, human resources and workers would form part of COMIBOL and the newly created company under its direction. We observe that in the meetings on 8 June 2012 between the Ministry of Mining, the Ministry of Presidency, COMIBOL, Colquiri Workers Union and sections of Cooperative 26 de Febrero, amongst others, an agreement was reached to \"nationalize\" Colquiri.322 As in the other instances, the term \"nationalize\" was used within this context by government officials, which does not seem consistent with Bolivia's argument about reversions.\n\nSupreme Decree No 1,264, *Gaceta Oficial* No 384NEC, 20 June 2012, **C-39** (unofficial translation).\n\nMinutes of Agreement between COMIBOL, FSTMB, Central Obrera Boliviana, Cooperativa 26 de Febrero and authorities of Colquiri, 8 June 2012, **R-345**.\n\n228.\n\nThe Tribunal is of the view that by virtue of this decree, the Respondent deprived the Claimant of the \"effective control of its investment\" in favor of COMIBOL in the sense described by the *AES v. Hungary* tribunal.323 We recall that the tribunal in *Middle East Cement v. Egypt* indicated that \"[w]hen measures are taken by a State the effect of which is to deprive the investor of the use and benefit of his investment [\u2026] the measures are often referred to as [\u2026] 'indirect' expropriation [\u2026] As a matter of fact, the investor is deprived by such measures of parts of the value of his investment.\"324 In *Santa Elena v. Costa Rica*, in the context of determining the relevant date of expropriation, the tribunal expressed that:\n\nWhat has to be identified is the extent to which the measures taken have *deprived* the owner of the *normal control* of his property. A decree which heralds a process of administrative and judicial consideration of the issue in a manner that effectively *freezes or blights the possibility* for the owner reasonably *to exploit the economic potential* of the property, can, if the process thus triggered is not carried out within a reasonable time, properly be identified as the actual act of taking. [\u2026] The expropriated property is to be evaluated as of the date on which the governmental \"interference\" has *deprived the owner of his rights* or *has made those rights practically useless*.325\n\n(emphasis added)\n\n*AES Summit Generation Limited and AES-Tisza Er\u00f6m\u00fc Kft v. Republic of Hungary,* ICSID Case No ARB/07/22, Award, 23 September 2010, \u00b6 14.3.1, **CLA-100**.\n\n*Middle East Cement Shipping and Handling Co SA v. Arab Republic of Egypt,* ICSID Case No ARB/99/6, Award, 12 April 2002, \u00b6 107, **CLA-34**. \"[T]he effect of the measure on the investor, not the state's intent, is the critical factor\". *Compa\u00f1\u00eda de Aguas del Aconquija SA and Vivendi Universal SA v. Argentine Republic,* ICSID Case No ARB/97/3, Award, 20 August 2007, \u00b6 7.5.20, **CLA-70**.\n\n*Compa\u00f1\u00eda del Desarrollo de Santa Elena SA v. Republic of Costa Rica,* ICSID Case No ARB/96/1, Final Award, 17 February 2000, \u00b6\u00b6 76 and 78, **CLA-25**.\n\n229.\n\nThe tribunal in *Pope & Talbot v. Canada* also considered that \"whether a particular interference with business activities amounts to an expropriation, the test is whether that interference is sufficiently restrictive to support a conclusion that the property *has been 'taken' from the owner*.\"326 In this case, the decree deprived the Claimant of the rights granted by Clauses 4 and 8 of the lease agreement, *i.e.*, the rights of use and possession of the assets and the activities of prospecting, exploration, exploitation and commercialization of products, which were the very *object* of the agreement.327 In the words of the tribunal in *Compa\u00f1\u00eda de Aguas del Aconquija SA and Vivendi v. Argentina*, this \"struck at the economic heart of, and crippled, Claimants' investment\".328\n\n*Pope & Talbot Inc v. Government of Canada,* UNCITRAL, Interim Award, 26 June 2000, \u00b6 102, **CLA-26**.\n\nColquiri Mine Lease, 27 April 2000, Clauses 4 and 8, **C-11**.\n\n*Compa\u00f1\u00eda de Aguas del Aconquija SA and Vivendi Universal SA v. Argentine Republic,* ICSID Case No ARB/97/3, Award, 20 August 2007, \u00b6 7.5.25, **CLA-70**.\n\n230.\n\nThe Respondent has argued that the Colquiri Mine Reversion Decree was necessary in order to \"restore public order and safety following a massive conflict\"329 and that it was a \"response to a public safety crisis\".330 Those might be perfectly sound objectives if there was evidence to support them, but there is none before us to suggest that this was done as part of such a program. Further, the decree makes no mention whatsoever of a public safety crisis nor the need to restore public order. In the Tribunal's view, any other motive or rationale for this measure provided by Bolivia after the issuance of the decree would be an *ex post facto* rationalization of the object and purpose of the decree.\n\nBolivia's Statement of Defence, \u00b6\u00b6 444 and 471.\n\nBolivia's Statement of Defence, \u00b6 472.\n\n231.\n\nIn addition, the decree makes references to the responsibility the State bears for mineralogy wealth, the control it exerts on the mining production chain, and the activities of the holders of mining rights. It also highlights the State's function in the administration and control of strategic sectors for the economy. In other words, the preamble does not suggest at all that the measure is an exercise of police powers for the maintenance of public order; rather, it points in another direction. Even more so, the decree mentions that the State's administration of those sectors has the \"purpose of achieving the economic and social development of the country, within the framework of public interest and social benefit\". Thus, it seems that the decree's objective was to take control of the mine for a purely economic purpose. Finally, in the case of Colquiri's machinery, equipment and supplies, the decree indicates outright their \"nationalization\" for \"public interest and social benefit\", although it does not precisely indicate which public purpose.\n\n232.\n\nConsequently, the Tribunal finds the Colquiri Mine Reversion Decree is in its nature an expropriation.\n\nb. The Legality of the Expropriation\n------------------------------------\n\n233.\n\nThe Respondent's arguments relating to the criterion of \"public purpose and social benefit\" are identical to its arguments on the police powers doctrine. The Tribunal's conclusion that the Respondent failed to present sufficient evidence of a public order crisis applies with equal force here.\n\n234.\n\nFor the sake of completeness, the Tribunal will also consider whether the Colquiri Mine Reversion Decree was made \"against just and effective compensation\". The decree was published in 2012. It contains four articles and one final provision. None of these provide for compensation on the taking of the rights derived from the Colquiri Mine Lease agreement and its immediate assumption by COMIBOL. It is not contested that no compensation has been provided to date (after 11 years). Paragraph IV of Article 1 provides compensation for the nationalization of Colquiri's machinery, equipment and supplies. According to this paragraph, \"Comibol is instructed to pay the amount [\u2026] whose value will be established as result of a valuation process to be carried out by an independent company hired by COMIBOL within a maximum period of [120] working days\".331 Notwithstanding the above, it is also not contested that no such payment was made.\n\nSupreme Decree No 1,264 *Gaceta Oficial* No 384NEC, 20 June 2012, **C-39** (unofficial translation).\n\n235.\n\nAccordingly, the Tribunal concludes that Bolivia failed to provide any just and effective compensation for the expropriation of the Colquiri Mine Lease.\n\n*iv. Conclusion on Bolivia's Reversions*\n----------------------------------------\n\n236.\n\nIn light of the foregoing, the Tribunal concludes that the Tin Smelter Reversion Decree, the Antimony Smelter Reversion Decree (including the Tin Stock seizure), and the Colquiri Mine Reversion Decree were expropriatory acts that did not fall within the scope of the Respondent's police powers. The Tribunal also finds that these expropriations were not carried out for a public purpose or a social benefit, and were not accompanied by just and effective compensation. Each decree therefore constitutes a breach of Article 5 of the Treaty.\n\n**2. Full Protection and Security**\n-----------------------------------\n\n237.\n\nAs to the second claim on merits, the overall position of the Parties is summarized as follows. The Claimant argues that \"Bolivia failed to grant full protection and security [\"**FPS**\"] to Glencore Bermuda's investments\" and additionally, that it \"also breached its obligation under the Colquiri [Mine] Lease to protect the Colquiri Mine against usurpations by third parties, in breach of the Treaty's umbrella clause\".332 According to the Claimant, despite informing COMIBOL, the Ministry of Mining and the Ministry of Government of the situation and requesting official intervention, the government did not intervene.333 The Respondent, on the other hand, argues that \"Bolivia took all legal actions available to it under the circumstances\"334 and that \"any forcible police action at Colquiri would have risked violating Bolivia's human rights obligations under the ICCPR and the American Convention\".335\n\nStatement of Claim, \u00b6 183.\n\nStatement of Claim, \u00b6 184.\n\nBolivia's Statement of Defence, \u00b6 538.\n\nBolivia's Statement of Defence, \u00b6 542.\n\n**A. The Full Protection and Security Standard Under Article 2(2) of the Treaty**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n238.\n\nWe begin our analysis with the text of the provision at issue. Article 2(2) of the Treaty contains two obligations, both of which form part of Glencore Bermuda's claim. We focus now on the second obligation and will address the first one later. According to Article 2(2):\n\n*[i]nvestments* of nationals or companies of each Contracting Party shall at all times be accorded fair and equitable treatment and *shall* enjoy *full protection and security* in the territory of the other Contracting Party. Neither Contracting Party shall, in any way, impair by unreasonable or discriminatory measures the management, maintenance, use, enjoyment or disposal of investments in its territory of nationals or companies of the other Contracting Party. Each Contracting Party *shall observe any obligation* it may have entered into *with regard to investments* of nationals or companies of the other Contracting Party.\n\n(emphasis added)\n\n239.\n\nAt first sight, we observe that Article 2 does not define \"protection and security\". However, it does describe the kind of measures that are prohibited, *i.e.*, those that are unreasonable or discriminatory. The verb form of the word \"protection\" \u2013 \"protect\" \u2013 means \"to cover or shield from exposure, injury, damage, or destruction\"; \"to maintain the status or integrity of especially through financial or legal guarantees\".336 The word \"security\" references \"the quality or state of being secure\", which in turn means \"free from danger\", \"affording safety\", and \"free from risk of loss\".337\n\n\"[P]rotect\". *Merriam-Webster.com*. 2023. https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/protect 31 January 2023.\n\n\"[S]ecurity\". *Merriam-Webster.com*. 2023. https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/security; \"secure\" https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/secure 31 January 2023.\n\n240.\n\nArticle 2, on the other hand, is entitled \"Promotion and Protection of Investment\" and its first paragraph reveals the intention of the parties to encourage \"favourable conditions\" for companies to invest capital in the territory of the other Contracting Party. The intention is to bring about an environment that fosters investment. Moreover, there is no textual support for restricting the applicability of this provision to physical protection and security. It would be difficult to encourage investment in a setting where investors' assets are not protected and secured both physically and legally. We find support in the opinion of the tribunal in *Frontier Petroleum Services v.

Whether Bolivia Breached Article 2(2) of the Treaty**\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n244.\n\nThe protection and security claim of the Claimant pertains to the Colquiri Mine and, more specifically, the violent incidents that occurred in April and May of 2012 prior to the reversion of the lease agreement. We recall that, on 3 April 2012, Colquiri informed COMIBOL in a letter that there had been \"serious disturbances\" to the peaceful use of the mining rights in the Colquiri Mine for some time and that \"criminal activity of unprecedented intensity\" had taken place on 1 April 2012, such as the \"massive entry of hundreds of people\". According to the letter, these individuals did not stop at material theft; they also \"verbally assaulted\" the employees and \"expelled them from their working areas.\" That very morning (3 April 2012), a new contingent of people had been caught by a supervisor, who had received \"death threats\". Colquiri's Executive President also mentioned that, although the disturbances had been attended to, to a large extent, by the company, \"the current situation previously set out ha[d] become unsustainable, to the point where the Colquiri Workers' Union ha[d] expressed [\u2026] its concern about the physical integrity of its members\", and requested COMIBOL to \"take the measures necessary to preserve peaceful possession and public order [\u2026] as required by clause 12.2.1 of the lease agreement.\"346 On 30 May, the Colquiri Mine was \"violently taken over by more than one thousand members of a local cooperative known as Cooperativa 26 de Febrero.\"347 The same day, Colquiri informed COMIBOL, the Ministry of Mining, the Ministry of Presidency and the Ministry of Government of the situation, demanding \"immediate official action.\" The Colquiri Workers' Union also wrote to the President of Bolivia, the Ministry of Mining and COMIBOL.348\n\nLetter from Colquiri (Mr. Capriles) to Comibol (Mr. C\u00f3rdova), 3 April 2012, **C-30** (unofficial translation).

From the evidence presented by Bolivia, the Tribunal can deduce the following: the takeover was described as \"unanticipated\" or \"sudden\";353 police were dispatched to the site; government officials were also sent; the government called for dialogue;354 and measures were taken to cut electricity in the mine and halt the sale of minerals from the Colquiri Mine.355 Additionally, there were negotiation attempts between the parties.356\n\n\"[I]ntempestivamente\" (Unofficial translation).

Albania* that the standard of due diligence is \"that of a host state in the circumstances and with the resources of the state in question\"359 as well as the view expressed in *ELSI* that \"'constant protection and security' cannot be construed as the giving of a warranty that property shall never in any circumstances be occupied or disturbed\".360\n\nClaimant's Reply, \u00b6 441.\n\nBolivia's Statement of Defence, \u00b6 538.\n\nAdopting the conclusion of Newcombe and Paradell referred in *Pantechniki S.A.

According to the evidence, the government was not inactive; rather, it took the measures it deemed appropriate for the circumstances, in particular, the prevention of the commercialization of the mineral and negotiations with the parties involved.\n\nBolivia's Statement of Defence, \u00b6 544.\n\nBolivia's Rejoinder, \u00b6 777.\n\n250.\n\nThe Tribunal does not consider such measures to be inappropriate, and it does not find unreasonable the specific circumstances expressed by the former President of COMIBOL, that \"the *cooperativistas* were inside the [Colquiri] Mine and were part of its operation and of the community [\u2026] were armed with dynamite and could hide in the air ducts and other access ways to the [Colquiri] Mine. As is well known in Bolivia, for the police it is practically impossible to enter inside a mine, guaranteeing the safety of the operation [\u2026] A police operation in Colquiri [Mine], like those carried out in Sayaquira, could have ended in a human and social catastrophe\".363\n\nC\u00f3rdova Witness Statement, \u00b6 86.

Nor could Bolivia have responded differently to the specific circumstances surrounding the takeover of the Colquiri Mine such that its chosen response would constitute a violation of Article 2(2) of the Treaty. The Tribunal does not deem it necessary to address Glencore Bermuda's claim under the lease agreement and the umbrella clause in light of this conclusion, the evidence presented, and the similarity in the obligations to protect against usurpations by third parties under the lease agreement.\n\n**3. Fair and Equitable Treatment Standard**\n--------------------------------------------\n\n252.\n\nIn general, the Claimant argues that the Respondent breached the fair and equitable treatment (\"**FET**\") standard when nationalizing its investments \"without compensation\",364 that Glencore Bermuda \"had a legitimate expectation that, should Bolivia wish to take over its investments, it would provide Glencore Bermuda with just compensation\", and that the Respondent would \"comply with all other requirements under domestic law and basic principles of due process.\"365 The Claimant also contends that it had a legitimate expectation under the Colquiri Mine Lease agreement that its investment would be protected by COMIBOL \"against usurpations by third parties\".366\n\nStatement of Claim, \u00b6 213.\n\nStatement of Claim, \u00b6\u00b6 214-215 and 222.\n\nStatement of Claim, \u00b6 216.\n\n253.\n\nIn a further submission, the Claimant clarifies that Bolivia: (i) \"failed to provide a transparent legal framework by conducting arbitrary and pretextual nationalizations, unsupported by fact or law and implemented in bad faith\"; (ii) \"violated Glencore Bermuda's legitimate expectations by taking the Assets without complying with due process and without providing any compensation, in breach of its international and domestic legal obligations, as well as its commitments under the Colquiri [Mine] Lease\"; and (iii) \"did not engage in good faith negotiations\".367\n\nClaimant's Reply, \u00b6 461.\n\n254.\n\nOn the other hand, Bolivia alleges that there is no evidence that the Claimant \"held any expectations\",368 that \"[a] breach of due process requires a complete lack of any opportunity to present evidence\", that the Claimant \"does not develop the legal standard applicable to allegations of arbitrariness\", and that \"Bolivia engaged in good faith negotiations to resolve the dispute amicably.\"369\n\nBolivia's Statement of Defence, \u00b6 562.\n\nBolivia's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 804, 806, 854.\n\n**A. The Fair and Equitable Treatment Standard Under Article 2(2) of the Treaty**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n255.\n\nNow we turn to the other obligation established in Article 2(2) of the Treaty, *i.e.*, that \"*[i]nvestments* of nationals or companies of each Contracting Party *shall at all times* be accorded *fair and equitable treatment.*\"370 In a similar way to FPS, the Treaty does not define \"fair\" and \"equitable\". Ordinarily, \"fair\" refers to: \"impartiality and honesty: free from self-interest, prejudice, or favoritism; conforming with the established rules: allowed\"371, \"equitable\" means \"having or exhibiting equity: dealing fairly and equally with all concerned,\"372 and \"equity\" means: \"justice according to natural law or right; specifically: freedom from bias or favoritism\".373\n\nUK-Bolivia Treaty, 24 May 1988, **C-1** (emphasis added).\n\n\"[F]air.\" *Merriam-Webster.com*. 2023. https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/fair, 03 February 2023.\n\n\"[E]quitable.\" *Merriam-Webster.com*. 2023. https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/equitable, 03 February 2023.\n\n\"[E]quity.\" *Merriam-Webster.com*. 2023. https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/equity, 03 February 2023.\n\n256.\n\nThese dictionary definitions are in line with the ordinary meaning attributed to the term \"fair and equitable\" by other tribunals: \"'just', 'even-handed', 'unbiased', 'legitimate'.\"374 Additionally, we note that both paragraph 1 of Article 2 and the preamble of the Treaty refer to creating \"*favourable conditions*\" for investment. The preamble also recognizes that \"encouragement and reciprocal protection [\u2026] will be conducive to the stimulation\" of business and will \"increase prosperity\". Thus, the intent of the States expressed in the objective, as well as the context, confirms that investments are expected to be subject to an environment that is just, conforming to the rules, even-handed, unbiased, free from prejudice. The Tribunal also observes that the obligation is qualified by the words \"*at all times*\". This, in our opinion, highlights the significance of the treatment that contracting States must accord to investors.\n\n*Azurix Corp. v. Argentine Republic,* ICSID Case No ARB/01/12, Award, 14 July 2006, \u00b6 360, **CLA-63**. See also *MTD v. Chile*, *Crystallex International Corporation v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela*, ICSID Case No ARB(AF)/11/2, Award, 4 April 2016, \u00b6 538, **CLA-130**.\n\n257.\n\nAlthough there is no one-size-fits-all definition, several tribunals have outlined the behavior that would breach this obligation and have generally understood that \"[a]ny measure that might involve arbitrariness or discrimination is in itself contrary to fair and equitable treatment.\"375 We concur with the tribunal in *Rumeli v. Kazakhstan* that according to this standard:\n\n[T]he State's conduct cannot be arbitrary, grossly unfair, unjust, idiosyncratic, discriminatory, or lacking in due process; - the State must respect procedural propriety and due process. The case law also confirms that to comply with the standard, the State must respect the investor's reasonable and legitimate expectations.376\n\n*CMS Gas Transmission Company v.

In this sense, it is not enough to allege that the State erroneously applied the national regulatory framework or that its authorities made questionable decisions in accordance with local law, it must be established that there has been a deliberate repudiation of the goals and objectives of a State policy. This is what differentiates arbitrary conduct from merely *illegal conduct*\" (unofficial translation, emphasis added). *Cervin Investissements S.A. and Rhone Investissements S.A. v.

Whether Bolivia Breached Article 2(2) of the Treaty**\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n259.\n\nThe Tribunal begins by noting that several of the Claimant's arguments are quite general and do not specify how the standard has been violated, merely repeating that the Respondent's conduct was not \"fair and equitable\". Its arguments are not elaborated upon. The Claimant's first concrete allegation is that the Tin and Antimony Smelters were nationalized. The Claimant appears to be focusing on the breach caused by the absence of prior notice and, consequently, due process. It argued that Glencore Bermuda was unable to object, and that no compensation was provided. Even though the Claimant is making this argument in the context of the FET provision, and while a single measure can certainly violate multiple provisions, the argument is closely related to Bolivia's Article 5 obligations.\n\n260.\n\nArticle 5 of the Treaty, unlike provisions in other BITs, does not condition expropriation on due process. Rather, the provision specifies that the investor \"shall have the right to promptly establish by due process\" the legality of the expropriation and the amount of compensation. There is no indication that such a procedure must be provided prior to the act, such that the Tribunal cannot infer this requirement from the text. In addition, the Tribunal is not persuaded by the Claimant's arguments that it was unable to object to the measure; as far as the Tribunal is aware, the Claimant could have utilized domestic channels but chose not to do so. Regarding the lack of compensation, the Claimant fails to explain how this omission constitutes an FET violation.\n\n261.\n\nThe Claimant asserts, within its claim regarding due process, that the nationalizations of the Tin and Antimony Smelters were conducted in an \"arbitrary\" and \"non-transparent\" fashion.379 The Claimant contends that the nationalizations were made \"under the pretext of unsubstantiated illegalities\" in the privatization process in which Glencore Bermuda was not involved, that the decrees were not \"founded in law or fact\",380 \"that no preliminary diligence was carried out to investigate or substantiate the basis for the 'reversions'\",381 and that \"[w]ith respect to the allegations of illegalities or contractual breaches, Bolivia's own claims confirm that, to this day, no Government authority has made any official determination of any wrongdoing or contractual breach\".382\n\nClaimant's Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 482-483; Statement of Claim, \u00b6 217.\n\nClaimant's Reply, \u00b6 476.\n\nClaimant's Reply, \u00b6 479.\n\nClaimant's Reply, \u00b6 482.\n\n262.\n\nThe Tribunal understands arbitrariness to be a ground embedded in the FET standard. We recall that the Tin Smelter Reversion Decree does not define \"reversion\" and does not provide a specific legal basis for it. The preamble indicates that the neoliberal model resulted in the privatization of strategic state-owned companies, such as Empresa Metal\u00fargica Vinto. It goes on to state that \"from the analysis\" of the privatization process, it is \"evident\" that the transfer was made in violation of different rules and legal provisions; it identifies as an issue the price of the transfer, the \"illegal handover\" of tin concentrates and other materials, a breach of contract by Allied Deals, and the fact that Congress did not approve the transfer; finally, it states the decision to \"revert\" the smelter.383\n\nSupreme Decree No. 29,026, 7 February 2007, published in the *Gaceta Oficial* No. 2,969 on 9 February 2007, **C-20** (unofficial translation).\n\n263.\n\nThe Tribunal recognizes an element of arbitrariness in the nationalization of the Tin Smelter. Not only does there seem to be no legal basis justifying the \"reversion\", but also and more specifically, the underlying and fundamental reason for reverting the asset\u2014*i.e.*, the \"illegality\" of the privatization process\u2014is not supported by evidence. To date, such illegality remains a mere assertion, since, as the Claimant asserts and the Respondent has not demonstrated otherwise, no government authority has officially determined the legality or illegality of the procedure. The tribunal in *Crystallex v. Venezuela* understood an arbitrary measure as one \"not based on legal standards but on excess of discretion, prejudice or personal preference\".384 In *Lauder v. Czech Republic* a measure was deemed arbitrary \"because it was not founded on reason or fact\".385 In this case, the Tribunal finds it difficult to grapple with the absence of evidence to support the alleged illegality. Thus, in our view, that is an element of arbitrariness.\n\n*Crystallex International Corporation v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela,* ICSID Case No ARB(AF)/11/2, Award, 4 April 2016, \u00b6 578, **CLA-130**.\n\n*Ronald S Lauder v. Czech Republic,* UNCITRAL, Final Award, 3 September 2001, \u00b6 232, **CLA-147**.\n\n264.\n\nRegarding the Colquiri Mine, the Claimant contends that Bolivia acted in a non-transparent manner by abandoning efforts to reach a negotiated solution that would preserve its rights \"only six days after the [\u2026] invasion\" and by negotiating the nationalization \"behind Glencore Bermuda's back\".386 We do not see how Bolivia's actions constitute an act of bad faith or lack of transparency. The Claimant also contends that it had a legitimate expectation that its investments would not be taken: (i) contrary to due process, (ii) without just and effective compensation, (iii) against Bolivia's domestic law, and (iv) consequent upon a breach of Bolivia's duty to protect the Colquiri Mine as provided in the lease agreement.387 When developing this argument, the Claimant briefly refers to the framework it relied on when acquiring the assets, such as the Investment Law, the Treaty, Bolivia's internal law and the dispute resolution clauses in the agreements, all of which provide guarantees.388 Nevertheless, the Claimant has not identified which specific representation made by Bolivia was frustrated. The Tribunal finds the Claimant's argument general and circular, premised on an expectation that Bolivia will comply with its obligations, but without establishing how Bolivia's actions violate the FET standard. Arguing a breach of other obligations is insufficient to establish a breach of this standard.\n\nClaimant's Reply, \u00b6 487.\n\nClaimant's Reply, \u00b6 493.\n\nClaimant's Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 494-495.\n\n265.\n\nThe Claimant's final argument is that Bolivia did not negotiate in good faith. According to the Claimant, \"Bolivia repeatedly failed to offer Glencore Bermuda just and effective compensation, despite Glencore Bermuda's many attempts to initiate and engage in good faith negotiations over the last ten years.\" The Claimant also contends that \"the Government delayed and cancelled meetings, continued 'reverting' the Assets\" and even offered a negative valuation.389 The Tribunal is aware that, in *PSEG v.

However, the Claimant mainly relies on a witness statement for its claim, and there is no additional evidence regarding whether Bolivia consistently canceled the meetings, how long it took to reschedule, or anything else that would confirm Bolivia's systematic disregard for its obligations.

The *Crystallex v.

However, it also indicates that \"Bolivia bears the burden of proving all facts underlying its defenses to Glencore Bermuda's claim for compensation\", and that \"[a]s a commentary on which Bolivia itself relies states, 'the burden of proof will rest with the respondent if the latter asserts facts (or, in procedural terms, raises a defense) implying full or partial rejection of the claim for compensation'.\"392 The Tribunal considers that the allocation of the burden of proof has been clearly addressed in investment case law, \"it is the Claimant that bears the *burden* of proof in relation to the fact and the amount of loss.\"393 Additionally, it is established that the respondent bears the burden of proving any allegation or defense it raises.394\n\nClaimant's Reply on Quantum, \u00b6 24.\n\n*Crystallex International Corporation v.

It is for the Claimants, as claimants alleging an entitlement to such compensation, to establish the amount of that compensation: the principle *actori incumbit probatio* is '*the broad basic rule to the allocation of the burden of proof in international procedure*'.

It is with respect to the standard of proof that they present opposing views. According to the Claimant, \"[t]he standard of proof is not seriously disputed in this case. The Parties agree that the standard of proof does not entail 'establishing with 100% certainty the *exact amount* of damages claimed'.\"395 The Claimant submits that \"the standard of proof is a 'balance of probabilities'. In the damages context, this standard has been defined to mean that the evidence of damages 'is enough for the judge to be able to admit with *sufficient probability* the existence and extent of the damage'.\" The Claimant indicates that \"[p]roving the amount of damages 'is not therefore an exercise in certainty, as such, but [\u2026] an exercise in 'sufficient certainty'.' As a result, a respondent State cannot 'invoke the burden of proof as to the amount of compensation for such loss to the extent that it would compound the respondent's wrongs and unfairly defeat the claimant's claim for compensation'.\"396\n\nClaimant's Reply on Quantum, \u00b6 25. Respondent contests that the standard is not disputed, since it alleges that Claimant conflates two standards, one being higher than the other. See Bolivia's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6\u00b6 118-120.\n\nClaimant's Reply on Quantum, \u00b6 26.\n\n270.\n\nFurthermore, the Claimant rejects Bolivia's view that the \"standard of proof rules out compensation for future projects that have no record of profits.\" As an example of such a project, Bolivia refers to Colquiri's planned Tailings Plant. According to the Claimant, Bolivia's position that such projects cannot give rise to damages for lost profits is wrong. In the Claimant's view, the only requirement is that \"*future profitability* can be established *(the fact of profitability* as opposed to the *amount*) with some level of certainty.\" The Claimant contends that it has provided \"more than ample evidence of the future profits of the Tailings Plant and Colquiri as a whole\u2014 profits that Glencore Bermuda lost as a result of Bolivia's breaches of the Treaty\".397\n\nClaimant's Reply on Quantum, \u00b6 27.\n\n271.\n\nThe Respondent argues that the alleged damages must be proven with \"certainty\". In this respect, it relies on the International Law Commission (\"**ILC**\") Articles on State Responsibility, which establish that compensation for losses must be proven with \"*sufficient certainty to be compensable.*\"398 It contends that the Claimant's \"entire damages case rests on a series of *assumptions* about future operations that are highly speculative and unrealistic, thus resulting in damages that are arbitrary and uncertain\".399\n\nBolivia's Statement of Defence, \u00b6\u00b6 617 and 620. \"Bolivia is not suggesting that Claimant's burden includes establishing with a 100% certainty the *exact amount* of damages claimed.

It submits that the former \"is both distinct from and higher than the one for proving [the] amount. A showing of 'sufficient probability' may be enough to establish the amount of damages sought, but before that, the very existence of damages must be proven with certainty.\"400 According to the Respondent, Claimant's own authority, *Crystallex v. Venezuela*, confirms this and disproves the Claimant's position. The tribunal in that case clarified that:\n\nFirst, the fact (*i.e.*, the existence) of the damage needs to be proven with certainty. [\u2026] Second, once the fact of damage has been established, a claimant should not be required to prove its exact quantification with the same degree of certainty.401\n\nBolivia's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6\u00b6 117 and 121.\n\nBolivia's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6 121, quoting *Crystallex International Corporation v.

It explains that this point is \"particularly relevant in relation to [the] Claimant's speculative compensation request for the [Tailings Plant] \u2013 a project not even approved or financed, let alone built, by [the] Claimant but which nonetheless represents almost 25% of the damages [\u2026] in relation to Colquiri.\"402\n\nBolivia's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6 127.\n\n274.\n\nFinally, the Respondent concludes that \"the 'balance of probabilities' standard may apply to the quantification of damages, but not to establish their existence. It is not sufficient that the existence of damages is more likely than not \u2013 it must be certain\" and the \"Claimant's valuations come nowhere near this necessary threshold of certainty\".403\n\nBolivia's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6 128.\n\n*i. Analysis by the Tribunal*\n-----------------------------\n\n275.\n\nAt the outset, the Tribunal recalls the distinction between the allocation of the burden of proof and the standard of proof. The differing views of the Parties lie within the latter. Regarding the standard of proof, the tribunal in *Crystallex v. Venezuela* stated: \"[t]he issue of the *standard* of proof, by contrast, relates to the degree of proof required for the Claimant to discharge its burden of proof.\"404 Regarding the burden of proof for the *existence of damages* (including future profits) *vis-\u00e0-vis* the quantification of damages, the Tribunal finds the award in *Crystallex v. Venezuela* to be instructive. In that case, the tribunal considered:\n\nFirst, the *fact* (*i.e.*, the existence) of the damage needs to be proven with certainty. In that sense, there is no reason to apply any different standard of proof than that which is applied to any other issue of merits (e.g., liability).\n\nSecond, once the fact of damage has been established, a claimant should not be required to prove its exact *quantification* with the same degree of certainty. This is because any future damage is inherently difficult to prove.405 [\u2026]\n\nArbitral tribunals have been prepared to award compensation on the basis of a reasonable approximation of the loss, where they felt confident about the fact of the loss itself.406\n\n(emphasis added)\n\n*Crystallex International Corporation v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela,* ICSID Case No ARB(AF)/11/2, Award, 4 April 2016, \u00b6 865, **CLA-130**.\n\n*Crystallex International Corporation v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela,* ICSID Case No ARB(AF)/11/2, Award, 4 April 2016, \u00b6\u00b6 867-868, **CLA-130**.\n\n*Crystallex International Corporation v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela,* ICSID Case No ARB(AF)/11/2, Award, 4 April 2016, \u00b6 871, **CLA-130**.\n\n276.\n\nFuture profits have a characteristic nature; regarding loss of profits the tribunal in *Crystallex v. Venezuela* also considered that:\n\nThese principles should also be applied with regard to the proof of loss of profits, which is the crucial issue in this case as far as the determination of quantum is concerned. [\u2026]\n\nFurthermore, according to an oft-cited authority, 'in order to be allowable, prospective profits must not be too speculative, contingent, uncertain*,* and the like. There must be proof that they were reasonably anticipated; and that the profits anticipated were probable and not merely possible'. The same idea was expressed by the tribunal in *ADM v. Mexico* which held that 'lost profits are allowable insofar as the Claimants prove that the alleged damage is not speculative or uncertain \u2013 *i.e.*, that the profits anticipated were probable or reasonably anticipated and not merely possible'. Furthermore, the *Vivendi v. Argentina* tribunal noted that 'compensation for lost profits is generally awarded only where future profitability can be established (the fact of profitability as opposed to the amount) with some level of certainty'.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, all these authorities show that, once the *fact* of future profitability is established and is not essentially of speculative nature, the amount of such profits need not be proven with the same degree of certainty. In other words, the Claimant must prove that it has been deprived of profits that would have actually been earned. This requires proving that there is sufficient certainty that it had engaged or *would have engaged* in a profitmaking activity but for the Respondent's wrongful act, and that such activity would have indeed been profitable.407\n\n(emphasis added)\n\n*Crystallex International Corporation v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela,* ICSID Case No ARB(AF)/11/2, Award, 4 April 2016, \u00b6\u00b6 872, 874, 875, **CLA-130**.\n\n277.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees that the existence of damages must be demonstrated with a reasonable degree of certainty; it cannot be speculative. This, however, does not seem to require a higher standard than for proving liability.408 Future profits, on the other hand, would not entail the same degree of certainty by definition; however, their existence must also be sufficiently established by demonstrating they were \"reasonably anticipated\", not \"too speculative or uncertain\", and \"probable\" rather than \"possible\".409 Quantification in either circumstance would not necessitate the same level of certainty as establishing the existence of damage or profitability respectively.410 In the words of the tribunal in *Lemire v. Ukraine*:\n\nWhile the existence of damage is certain, calculating the precise amount of the compensation is fraught with much more difficulty, inherent in the very nature of the \"but for\" hypothesis. Valuation is not an exact science. The Tribunal has no crystal ball and cannot claim to know what would have happened under a hypothesis of no breach; the best any tribunal can do is to make an informed and conscientious evaluation, taking into account all the relevant circumstances of the case, not unlike that made by anyone who assesses the value of a business on the basis of its likely future earnings.411\n\n(emphasis added)\n\n\"The Tribunal finds no support for the conclusion that the standard of proof for damages should be higher than for proving merits, and therefore is satisfied that the appropriate standard of proof is the balance of probabilities. This, of course, means that damages cannot be speculative or merely \"possible\", as both Parties acknowledge. In the Tribunal's view, all of the authorities cited by the Parties \u2013 including by Respondent in relation to its claim that a degree of certainty is required \u2013 accord with the principle that the balance of probabilities applies, even if some tribunals phrase the standard slightly differently. In particular, those cases that discuss the requirement for \"certainty\" do so in the context of distinguishing \"proven\" damages from speculative damages, rather than suggesting that a higher degree of proof is applied to damages than to liability\" (emphasis added). *Gold Reserve Inc v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela,* ICSID Case No ARB(AF)/09/1, Award, 22 September 2014, \u00b6 685, **CLA-123**.\n\nSee also *South American Silver Limited (Bermuda) v.

Argentine Republic,* ICSID Case No ARB/97/3, Award, 20 August 2007, \u00b6\u00b6 8.3.3-8.3.4, **CLA-70**.\n\n\"The Tribunal agrees that it is a commonly accepted standard for awarding forward looking compensation that damages must not be speculative or uncertain, but proved with reasonable certainty; the level of certainty is unlikely, however, to be the same with respect to the conclusion that damages have been caused, and the precise quantification of such damages. Once causation has been established, and it has been proven that the *in bonis* party has indeed suffered a loss, less certainty is required in proof of the actual amount of damages; for this latter determination Claimant only needs to provide a basis upon which the Tribunal can, with reasonable confidence, estimate the extent of the loss\" (emphasis added). *Joseph Charles Lemire v. Ukraine*, ICSID Case No ARB/06/18, Award, 28 March 2011, \u00b6 246, **CLA-104**.\n\n*Joseph Charles Lemire v. Ukraine,* ICSID Case No ARB/06/18, Award of 28 March 2011, \u00b6 248, **CLA-104**. \"[T]he assessment of damages is often a difficult exercise and it is seldom that damages in an investment situation will be able to be established with scientific certainty. This is because such assessments will usually involve some degree of estimation and the weighing of competing (but equally legitimate) facts, valuation methods and opinions, which does not of itself mean that the burden of proof has not been satisfied. Because of this element of imprecision, it is accepted that tribunals retain a certain amount of discretion or a \"margin of appreciation\" when assessing damages, which will necessarily involve some approximation\". *Gold Reserve Inc v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela*, ICSID Case No ARB(AF)/09/1, Award, 22 September 2014, \u00b6 686, **CLA-123**.\n\n278.\n\nHaving addressed this, the Tribunal is not convinced that the Respondent's arguments that the Claimant has not established the existence of damages with sufficient certainty412 are appropriate for the standard of proof regarding the existence of damages; rather, these arguments seem to be appropriate when analyzing the amount of damages that should be awarded, based on the \"but-for scenario\".

Standard of Compensation**\n-------------------------------\n\n279.\n\nThe Claimant alleges that it is entitled to \"full reparation\" under customary international law.413 On the other hand, the Respondent considers that the \"Claimant's expropriation claims must be assessed per the standard that the Contracting Parties established as applicable to expropriation claims under the Treaty\",414 *i.e.,* under Article 5 of the BIT. Additionally, the Respondent states that \"regarding [the] Claimant's FET and FPS claims, it is undisputed that the customary 'full reparation' standard applies to the determination of any compensation allegedly due. The debate here is not whether the full reparation standard applies but the fact that Claimant has not actually applied [the] said standard to its FET and FPS claims\".415\n\nClaimant's Reply on Quantum, \u00b6\u00b6 14-23.\n\nBolivia's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6 24.\n\nBolivia's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6 36.\n\n280.\n\nThe Respondent is not challenging the application of the customary reparation standard to the Claimant's FET and FPS claims. We therefore proceed to analyze whether the standard for compensation under the expropriation claim should be in accordance with Article 5 of the Treaty or under customary international law.

Expropriation Claim*\n------------------------\n\n281.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, \"in the absence of an applicable *lex specialis*, the relevant standard for the determination of the compensation owed to Glencore Bermuda must be assessed by the Tribunal with reference to applicable principles of customary international law.\"417 The Claimant points to *Chorz\u00f3w Factory*, where the Permanent Court of International Justice (\"**PCIJ**\") indicated that:\n\nThe *essential principle contained in the actual notion of an illegal act*\u2014a principle which seems to be established by international practice and in particular by the decisions of arbitral tribunals\u2014is that *reparation must, as far as possible, wipe out all the consequences of the illegal act and reestablish the situation which would, in all probability, have existed if that act had not been committed.*418\n\n(emphasis added)\n\nStatement of Claim, \u00b6 230.\n\n*Case Concerning the Factory at Chorz\u00f3w* (*Germany v.

Claimant asks as well that the Tribunal \"exercise[s] its discretion to calculate the FMVs of the Investments as of dates other than the dates on which Bolivia's unlawful conduct permanently deprived Glencore Bermuda of the Investments if\u2014as is the case with the Antimony Smelter\u2014a valuation as of another date would result in a higher FMV for the [i]nvestment. [\u2026] The Tribunal should also allow for annually compounded pre-and post-award interest.\"\n\n283.\n\nThe Respondent rejects the Claimant's position. For the Respondent, \"the Treaty explicitly establishes that the compensation to be paid is equivalent to the FMV of the investment immediately prior to the date when the expropriation occurred or became public knowledge.\"422 According to the Respondent, \"the very essence of FMV [\u2026] is the objective approach of a hypothetical transaction between a willing buyer and a willing seller, not [the] Claimant's subjective valuation.\" Bolivia indicates that, \"*the reference to a 'hypothetical buyer' makes it clear that the value of the property is not to be determined from a subjective perspective, be it that of the former owner or that of the expropriating State, but from the perspective of a third person who is not directly involved in the transaction*.\"423\n\nBolivia's Statement of Defence, \u00b6 691.\n\nBolivia's Statement of Defence, \u00b6 697, quoting I.

Analysis by the Tribunal*\n------------------------------\n\n285.\n\nArticle 5(1) of the Treaty provides the following:\n\nInvestments of nationals or companies of either Contracting Party shall not be nationalised, expropriated or subjected to measures having effect equivalent to nationalisation or expropriation (hereinafter referred to as \"expropriation\") in the territory of the other Contracting Party except for a public purpose and for a social benefit related to the internal needs of that Party and against just and effective compensation. Such compensation shall amount to the market value of the investment expropriated immediately before the expropriation or before the impending expropriation became public knowledge, whichever is the earlier, shall include interest at a normal commercial or legal rate, whichever is applicable in the territory of the expropriating Contracting Party, until the date of payment, shall be made without delay, be effectively realizable and be freely transferable.\n\n286.\n\nOn the other hand, Article 31(1) of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility states:\n\nThe responsible State is under an obligation to make *full reparation* for the injury caused by the internationally wrongful act.\n\n(emphasis added)\n\n287.\n\nArticle 34 of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility states:\n\nFull reparation for the injury caused by the *internationally wrongful act* shall take the form of restitution, compensation and satisfaction, either singly or in combination, in accordance with the provisions of this chapter.\n\n(emphasis added)\n\n288.\n\nArticle 36 of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility states:\n\n1. The State responsible for an internationally wrongful act is under an obligation to *compensate for the damage* caused thereby, insofar as such damage is *not made good by restitution.*\n\n2. The compensation shall cover *any financially assessable damage including loss of profits* insofar as it is established.\n\n(emphasis added)\n\n289.\n\nUnder the BIT standard, compensation shall amount to the \"market value\". Article 36 of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility mandates that compensation shall cover \"any financially assessable damage\"; however, according to commentary (22) of said provision, \"[c]ompensation reflecting the *capital value* of property taken or destroyed as the result of an internationally wrongful act *is generally assessed on the basis of the 'fair market value' of the property lost*\" (emphasis added).\n\n290.\n\nAt the outset, the Tribunal observes that ultimately both Parties refer to the FMV428 for the valuation of the damages. The disagreement appears to be on whether the Tribunal should value the damages at the date of dispossession or at a different date. We address the dates of valuation separately.\n\n\"[F]ull reparation must include the FMV of the claimant's entire investment [\u2026]\" Claimant's Reply on Quantum, \u00b6 15. \"[T]he practical results of applying the Treaty's compensation standards or the customary international law standard of full reparation to the valuation of the expropriations alleged in the present case should be the same: the awarding of the Assets' fair market value at the date of dispossession.\" \"[F]or Claimant's expropriation claims, the valuation result should be the same, as if the Tribunal had applied the Treaty's standard\". Bolivia's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6\u00b6 47and 48.\n\n291.\n\nAs to the compensation standard, the Tribunal does not deem it necessary to discuss whether Article 5 of the Treaty provides a compensation standard applicable to both lawful and unlawful expropriations and whether the Treaty standard would be more appropriate than the customary international law standard. In this case, we have found that Article 5 has been breached and thus compensation must follow. Since both Parties refer to the FMV, we agree with the Respondent's argument that in practical terms, the result of applying one standard or the other should be the same. The Tribunal notes that other investment cases have followed a similar approach. For example, in *Santa Elena v. Costa Rica*, the tribunal stated that it would not enter into a doctrinal discussion of the standard of compensation since \"there [was] no dispute between the parties as to the applicability of the principle of *full compensation for the* [FMV] *of the Property, i.e., what a willing buyer would pay to a willing seller*\".429 In *Flughafen v. Venezuela,* the tribunal also considered:\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, both Treaties require compensation to be effective and adequate; and for compensation to meet these requirements, its amount will necessarily be equivalent to the *market value of the expropriated property*, calculated on the date immediately prior to the date on which the expropriation was carried out (or was made public knowledge). In practical terms, the compensation regulation contained in both Treaties leads to the same results.

Causation and Contributory Fault**\n---------------------------------------\n\n293.\n\nBolivia alleges that the \"Claimant has never identified which specific damages allegedly arise out of the distinct actions of Bolivia that form the basis for its supplementary FPS claim for Colquiri [Mine] or its alternative FET claims for all three reverted Assets, and that [the] Claimant has not even addressed causation between any of these alleged breaches and the separate heads of damages that they supposedly resulted in\".431 In this regard, the Respondent contends that damages should not be awarded since there is no causal link or, in the alternative, damages should be reduced, because Bolivia's actions resulted from the Claimant's own conduct.432\n\nBolivia's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6 37. See also Bolivia's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6\u00b6 220 and 223.\n\nBolivia's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6\u00b6 209-216.\n\n294.\n\nThe Respondent also submits that \"[i]n the present case, where [the] Claimant's prior conduct and Bolivia's response thereto are the cumulative causes leading to each head of damages, the causal analysis cannot only post-date the alleged breach. The chain of causation must be traced back to include [the] Claimant's prior conduct which, as a matter of '*ant\u00e9riorit\u00e9 causale,*' triggered Bolivia's response and thus, also the damages allegedly resulting therefrom.\"433\n\nBolivia's Rejoinder on Quantum, *\u00b6* 226.\n\n295.\n\nThe Respondent finds support in the analysis by the *Burlington* tribunal on causation and contributory fault. In that case, the tribunal assessed \"whether the investor's conduct was *'the triggering [\u2026], []or the decisive factor'* in *'the chain of events that eventually culminated'* in the State's unlawful act, in order to decide if it had *'sever[ed] the chain of causation between the wrongful conduct and the injury,'* or if it had *'contribute[d] to the magnitude of the loss'* suffered by the investor.\"434 According to the Respondent, \"[c]ausation and contributory fault are interrelated concepts\", and under this integrated approach, *i.e.*, addressing causation and contributory fault, tribunals have considered whether the causal chain leading to the harm suffered by the investor can be traced back to the investor's conduct, which triggered the State's response. Depending on the conduct's intensity, \"*a claimant's conduct may justify an exclusion or reduction of damages if it has contributed to the injury.*\"435\n\nRespondent clarifies that \"[w]hile the majority in *Burlington* found for neither proposition based on the specific facts of that case, its legal analysis supports Bolivia's position that the investor's prior conduct can be the triggering factor of the State's response and may thus severe the chain of causation\".

Causation*\n--------------\n\n296.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, the \"Claimant has only advanced a single valuation and causation analysis based on an expropriation scenario, which assumes the entire loss of Colquiri's value. [The] Claimant has never specified which part of its claimed damages was specifically caused by Bolivia's alleged FPS or FET breaches\".436 Regarding the Claimant's FET claim, it alleges that the FET allegations \"have no temporal connection with [the] Claimant's 29 May 2012 valuation date\".437 The Respondent also submits that \"there currently exists no causation analysis, nor a workable valuation model to support [the] Claimant's FET or FPS claims to begin with \u2013 let alone one justifying a 29 May 2012 valuation date for Colquiri.\"438\n\nBolivia's Rejoinder on Quantum, *\u00b6* 70.\n\nBolivia's Rejoinder on Quantum, *\u00b6* 73.\n\nBolivia's Rejoinder on Quantum, *\u00b6* 74.\n\n297.\n\nIn the Claimant's view, Bolivia has not denied \"that its Treaty breaches were the proximate cause of Glencore Bermuda's losses with respect to three of the four [i]nvestments\u2014the Vinto Tin Smelter, the Antimony Smelter and the Tin Stock.\"439 As to Colquiri, the Claimant submits that in order to establish proximate cause, it only needs to show that \"its loss of Colquiri was the objectively foreseeable outcome of Bolivia's expropriation of the Colquiri [Mine] Lease\" and that this is the case since \"the *complete* loss of Claimant's investment is the objectively foreseeable result of the *complete* taking of the investment by the State.\"440\n\nClaimant's Reply on Quantum, \u00b6 28. This assertion is contested by Respondent. See Bolivia's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6 219.\n\nClaimant's Reply on Quantum, \u00b6 29.\n\n*ii. Contributory Fault*\n------------------------\n\n298.\n\nAs to the threshold for finding contributory fault, the Claimant submits it is high and that in the rare instances where tribunals have reduced the amount of damages on the grounds of contributory fault, the investor has typically committed \"serious wrongdoing, such as breaching the laws of the host state\", whereas \"when the investor engages in common business practices and the respondent's measures are the primary cause of the investor's injury, damages should not be reduced\".441\n\nClaimant's Reply on Quantum, \u00b6\u00b6 197 and 199.\n\n299.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, \"as long as any conduct of the investor has a sufficient causal link to the damages, said conduct is capable of reducing the amount of damages, and is, as such, material to the examination of contributory fault. The significance of this material contribution is then reflected [in] the percentage of reduction to the damages that the tribunal considers justified, based on the conduct's degree of contribution to the damages and the case's factual context\".442 In the Respondent's view, there is no high threshold for contributory negligence, and \"as long as the investor's conduct is causally linked to the ensuing damages, it is both material and significant to the tribunal's assessment of contributory fault.\" In this case, the Respondent maintains that the Claimant's prior conduct provoked the acts that are allegedly unlawful; therefore, \"the chain of causation clearly connects [the] Claimant's conduct, the [r]eversions, and the compensation claimed\".443 Finally, the Respondent contends that the reduction of compensation is not rare or restricted to cases of illegal conduct by investors.444\n\na.

In the alternative, the Respondent submits that if the Tribunal were to find that Bolivia was partially responsible for the damages, it must also find that the \"Claimant's own conduct was the predominant factor causing Bolivia's response to the social conflict at the Colquiri Mine\". Therefore, the damages suffered should be reduced by at least 75% to reflect the Claimant's contributory fault.445\n\nBolivia's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6 287. See also Bolivia's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6\u00b6 258-286.\n\n301.\n\nThe Claimant, on the other hand, maintains that \"Bolivia's taking of Colquiri in its entirety was the sole cause of Glencore Bermuda's losses in relation to Colquiri\" and that \"Bolivia's allegation that Glencore Bermuda caused its own losses in part by 'forcing' Bolivia to take Colquiri has no merit and should be rejected\".446\n\nb. The Tin Smelter447\n\nClaimant's Reply on Quantum, \u00b6\u00b6 30 and 31.\n\nAs to the Tin Smelter, the Antimony Smelter and the Tin Stock, Claimant alleges that \"Bolivia does not deny that its Treaty breaches were the proximate cause of Glencore Bermuda's losses with respect to three of the four Investments\u2014the Vinto Tin Smelter, the Antimony Smelter and the Tin Stock.\" Claimant's Reply on Quantum, \u00b6 28.\n\n302.\n\nThe Respondent alleges that the \"Claimant's own bad business decision to acquire an asset whose privatisation was tainted by irregularities was the very factor that caused [the] Claimant's damages following the Tin Smelter's reversion, or that, at the very least, materially and significantly contributed to said damages\". In the Respondent's view, the Tribunal must find either that the causal chain has been fatally severed and not award any compensation for Vinto, or reduce any compensation by 50%, to reflect the Claimant's contributory fault.448\n\nc. The Antimony Smelter\n\nBolivia's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6 299. See also Bolivia's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6\u00b6 288-298.\n\n303.\n\nThe Respondent contends that the Claimant was aware of the contractual obligation to keep the plant in production but chose not to do so, that it was unwilling to invest in the Assets \u2013 much less in the Antimony Smelter and, in consequence, the \"Claimant's own conduct \u2013 its decision not to activate the plant \u2013 was the triggering and decisive factor for the Antimony Smelter's reversion, or, at least, it was the predominant triggering factor for the reversion, materially and significantly contributing to the damages sought\". In the Respondent's view, damages should be reduced by 75% to reflect the Claimant's contributory fault.449\n\nBolivia's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6 307. See also Bolivia's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6\u00b6 300-306.\n\n*iii. Analysis by the Tribunal*\n-------------------------------\n\n304.\n\nThe Tribunal begin our analysis by addressing causation. In the words of the tribunal in *Biwater v. Tanzania*, \"[c]ompensation for any violation of the BIT, whether in the context of unlawful expropriation or the breach of any other treaty standard, will only be due if there is a sufficient causal link between the actual breach of the BIT and the loss sustained\".450 The tribunal in that case considered that \"[t]he requirement of causation comprises a number of different elements, including (inter alia) (a) a *sufficient link between the wrongful act and the damage* in question, and (b) a threshold beyond which damage, albeit linked to the wrongful act, is considered *too indirect or remote*.\"451\n\n*Biwater Gauff (Tanzania) Ltd v. United Republic of Tanzania,* ICSID Case No ARB/05/22, Award, 24 July 2008*,* \u00b6 779, **CLA-78**.\n\n*Biwater Gauff (Tanzania) Ltd v. United Republic of Tanzania,* ICSID Case No ARB/05/22, Award, 24 July 2008*,* \u00b6 785, **CLA-78**.\n\n305.\n\nThe Tribunal recalls that the Claimant's claims in relation to FPS were dismissed. Turning to the arguments on causation regarding the FET claims, the Tribunal also recalls its finding that there was an element of arbitrariness in the nationalization of the Tin Smelter, in particular the fact that there appeared to be no legal basis justifying the \"reversion\" and that the fundamental reason for \"reverting\" the asset was an illegality that, to date, has not been established by any Bolivian authority. Therefore, the Tribunal found a breach of the FET standard contained in Article 2(2).452 As indicated above, the Tin Smelter Reversion Decree expressly provided for the taking of the smelter: it \"reverted [the smelter] to the domain of the Bolivian State, with all its current assets, providing that [the State Company EMV] immediately takes administrative, technical, legal and financial control\".453 The enactment of this decree is what changed the situation for the Tin Smelter, unlike other cases where there may be other causes acting together, in this case, the record shows that the decree alone is what resulted in the Claimant's loss of the Tin Smelter. In consequence, the Tribunal does see a causal link between the Tin Smelter Reversion Decree and the damage resulting from the loss of the Tin Smelter.\n\nSee Section VI.3.B above.\n\nSupreme Decree No. 29,026, 7 February 2007, published in the *Gaceta Oficial* No. 2,969 on 9 February 2007, **C-20** (unofficial translation).\n\n306.\n\nRegarding the Colquiri Mine, we also recall our finding that the Respondent's reversion constituted an expropriation within the meaning of Article 5 and that the Respondent violated this provision of the Treaty because it was neither for a public purpose nor in exchange for just and effective compensation.454 The Tribunal concludes that there is a causal link between the Colquiri Mine Reversion Decree and the damage resulting from the expropriation, given that the Claimant lost use and possession rights granted under the lease agreement, which were transferred to COMIBOL and the newly formed company as a result of the decree.\n\nSee Section VI.1.B.iv above.\n\n307.\n\nNotwithstanding this finding, the Respondent has advanced arguments on contributory fault in respect of the Colquiri Mine, as well as the Tin and Antimony Smelters. We turn to analyze whether the Claimant's actions contributed to the damages sought and whether compensation should be reduced or eliminated on this ground.455\n\n\"It is undisputed that a claimant's conduct may justify an exclusion or reduction of damages if it has contributed to the injury.\" *Burlington Resources, Inc v. Republic of Ecuador,* ICSID Case No ARB/08/5, Decision on Reconsideration and Award, 7 February 2017, \u00b6 572, **CLA-134**.\n\n308.\n\nArticle 39 of the ILC Draft Articles on State Responsibility states:\n\nIn the determination of reparation, account shall be taken of the *contribution to the injury* by *wilful or negligent action or omission* of the injured State or any person or entity in relation to whom reparation is sought.456\n\n(emphasis added)\n\nSee also commentary 13 to Article 31: \"It is true that cases can occur where an identifiable element of injury can properly be allocated to one of several concurrently operating causes alone. But unless some part of the injury can be shown to be severable in causal terms from that attributed to the responsible State, the latter is held responsible for all the consequences, not being too remote, of its wrongful conduct.\" ILC, \"Draft articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts, with commentary\" [2001-II(2)], Yearbook of the International Law Commission, **CLA-30.**\n\n309.\n\nCommentary 1 to this Article indicates that it deals with situations \"where the injured State, or the individual victim of the breach, has *materially* contributed to the damage by some wilful or negligent act or omission\" (emphasis added). As to the type of actions or omissions, Commentary 5 states:\n\nNot every action or omission which contributes to the damage suffered is relevant for this purpose. Rather, article 39 allows to be taken into account only those actions or omissions which can be considered as wilful or negligent, i.e. which manifest a lack of due care on the part of the victim of the breach for his or her own property or rights. While the notion of a negligent action or omission is not qualified, e.g. by a requirement that the negligence should have reached the level of being \"serious\" or \"gross\", the relevance of any negligence to reparation will depend upon the degree to which it has contributed to the damage as well as the other circumstances of the case. The phrase \"account shall be taken\" indicates that the article deals with factors that are capable of affecting the form or reducing the amount of reparation in an appropriate case.\n\n310.\n\nAccordingly, our task is to determine if the Claimant's actions \"manifest a lack of due care\" and if it \"materially contributed to the damage\". The tribunal in *Occidental v. Ecuador* also expressed this view: \"[t]he Tribunal notes that it is not any contribution by the injured party to the damage which it has suffered which will trigger a finding of contributory negligence. The contribution must be material and significant. In this regard, the Tribunal has a wide margin of discretion in apportioning fault.\"457\n\n*Occidental Petroleum Corporation and Occidental Exploration and Production Company v. Republic of Ecuador,* ICSID Case No ARB/06/11, Award, \u00b6 670, **CLA-254**.\n\n311.\n\nRegarding the Colquiri Mine Lease, Bolivia attributes its response to the social conflict to the Claimant's mismanagement of relations with *cooperativistas*, its failure to involve Bolivia in a timely manner in resolving conflicts, the failure to protect its workers and the promotion of inconsistent agreements (the Rosario Agreement). The Tribunal considers that the record before it does not support these allegations. Regarding the Claimant's alleged mismanagement of relations and the failure to involve Bolivia, the Tribunal notes that, as recognized by Bolivia, *cooperativistas* \"are a common fixture in the Bolivian mining sector\"458 and the management of relations was shared with Bolivia. For example, it was COMIBOL who sanctioned the assignment of mining areas and COMIBOL formed part of negotiations with *cooperativistas* as is shown by the negotiations carried out prior to the Colquiri Mine's expropriation. Whether the involvement was timely or not, we recall that the Claimant notified Bolivia prior to the events to request support and during that time the President of COMIBOL was in regular contact with Sinchi Wayra, the trade union and the cooperative leaders. This would suggest that matters related to *cooperativistas* required a joint effort between the government and the Claimant's company, and what the record shows is that the government was not seeking out a solution but rather administrating the conflict.459 Regarding the Rosario Agreement, a government representative was part of that negotiation.460 Moreover, it seems that what the workers really wanted was job security, regardless of who had control of the Colquiri Mine.461 In the Tribunal's view, this does not reflect a manifest lack of due care on the Claimant's part.\n\nBolivia's Statement of Defence, \u00b6 33.\n\nTranscript, Hearing on Jurisdiction and Merits, Day 2, p. 520, line 12-p. 524, line 10 (Mr. C\u00f3rdoba).\n\nLetter from the Minister of Mining (Mr. Virreira) to Cooperativa 26 de Febrero (Mr. Lima), 30 May 2012, **C-259**.\n\n\"What we demanded was a definitive solution [\u2026] So, in 2012, the situation was very serious. So we wanted Sinchi Wayra, or the Government, we wanted to solve this problem in a definitive manner. What the workers had was not only a labor conflict; this impacted society also, and the community. So we wanted to provide a definitive solution.\" Transcript, Hearing on Jurisdiction and Merits, Day 3, p. 745, lines 1-2 and p. 746, lines 20-25 (Mr. Mamani).\n\n312.\n\nRegarding the Tin Smelter, the Respondent attributes the damage to the Claimant's \"bad business decision to acquire an asset whose privatisation was tainted by irregularities\".462 However, as mentioned above, such \"irregularity\", at that moment and to date, remains a mere assertion by Bolivia: there has been no legal determination to that effect by any Bolivian authority and there is insufficient evidence to support that claim. In this regard, the Tribunal has difficulty understanding how this demonstrates the Claimant's lack of care.\n\nBolivia's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6 299.\n\n313.\n\nLastly, the Respondent asserts that by failing to engage in operation at the Antimony Smelter, it contributed to the reversion and, by extension, the claimed damages. We observe that the Parties disagree as to whether there was an actual contractual obligation to put the Antimony Smelter into operation. In this regard, we once again recall that, to date, no Bolivian court or administrative body has been asked to determine whether or not there was a breach of contract. Similar to the Tin Smelter case, this allegation remains an assertion that is not supported by adequate evidence.463\n\nBolivia's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6 300.\n\n314.\n\nFor these reasons, the Tribunal dismisses the Respondent's allegations on causation and contributory fault.\n\n**2. The Colquiri Mine**\n------------------------\n\n**A. Valuation Date**\n---------------------\n\n315.\n\nOriginally, the Claimant proposed 29 May 2012 as the valuation date, *i.e.*, \"the day prior to the moment in which Glencore Bermuda finally and irrevocably lost control of its investment due to Bolivia's breach of its obligations to afford full protection and security and fair and equitable treatment.\" According to the Claimant, Bolivia's internationally wrongful conduct, including its threats of nationalization and the exclusion of Colquiri from the negotiations regarding the shared-risk contracts and the subsequent lack of protection of the mine, allowed the cooperatives to invade and remain in the mine, Colquiri's only remaining productive asset. As consequence of this breach, from 30 May 2012 the Colquiri Mine remained entirely inaccessible to Glencore Bermuda, thus requiring a valuation on the previous day, 29 May 2012.464 In the alternative, the Claimant contends that the appropriate valuation date for Colquiri is, at the very latest, 4 June 2012 (the day before Bolivia publicly announced the impending nationalization of the Colquiri Mine, which is the latest possible valuation date under the Treaty).465\n\nStatement of Claim, \u00b6 255.\n\nClaimant's Reply on Quantum, \u00b6 57.\n\n316.\n\nThe Respondent's position is that Colquiri shall be valued as of 19 June 2012, the date before the alleged expropriation took place466 and alleges that Glencore Bermuda was able to temporarily restore operations until 20 June 2012.467 In response, the Claimant argues that the evidence at the Hearing on Jurisdiction and Merits established that Glencore Bermuda never regained operations (including production) at the Colquiri Mine after 30 May 2012. It submits that Bolivia's own witness, Eng. Moreira, a manager at the Colquiri Mine in 2012, testified that \"after 30 May 2012, he did not return to his job at the Mine, because there were no operations left to supervise after that date.\" Furthermore, \"the fact that Glencore Bermuda had the legal authority to enter into the Rosario Agreement on 8 June 2012 does not mean that Glencore Bermuda could operate the [Colquiri] Mine on that date [\u2026] [a]ll it shows is that Glencore Bermuda behaved *as though it still had legal rights under the Colquiri Lease* even though it had lost operational control of the [Colquiri] Mine on 30 May 2012\"468 (emphasis added).\n\nBolivia's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6 61.\n\nBolivia's Statement of Defence, \u00b6\u00b6 705-707. In the Respondent's view, the Claimant acknowledges that it entered into the Rosario Agreement on 7 June 2012 with the *cooperativistas,* whereby it agreed to turn over the Rosario vein of the [Colquiri] Mine, therefore, this action \"conclusively demonstrates that Claimant remained in control of the [Colquiri] Mine\", \u00b6 705.\n\nClaimant's Reply on Quantum, \u00b6 59.\n\n317.\n\nThe Respondent rejects this assertion and posits that the \"Claimant could simply not have been negotiating over something already lost. Neither would the *cooperativistas* have accepted to negotiate with [the] Claimant, nor would the Rosario Agreement have resulted in a *'workable solution'* and a *'truce'* that lifted the blockade, if [the] Claimant had indeed *'irretrievably lost'* the Mine a week earlier, to the very party that it negotiated and concluded the Rosario Agreement with.\"469\n\nBolivia's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6 67.\n\n318.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the Claimant's one-size-fits-all approach is at odds with contemporary arbitral practice. In this regard, it points out that, \"in cases such as this, where no allegations of creeping expropriation have been made, a 'layered' approach has been adopted by other tribunals to separately value each treaty breach at the time of its occurrence.\"470 This holds, according to the Respondent, all the more true in the present case, where the Claimant has not argued a creeping expropriation of Colquiri but is now seeking similar valuation results by \"improperly merging together its expropriation, FPS and FET claims\".471 Additionally, it contends that the Claimant's information provided to the market in 2012 confirms as well that Glencore did not consider that it had suffered an \"*irretrievable loss*\" of its rights and control over the Colquiri Mine before 20 June 2012.472 Thus, based on its own actions at the time, the Claimant retained in full its legal rights over Colquiri after 30 May 2012 and until 20 June 2012, when its rights over the Mine were \"*irretrievably lost*\" and reverted to Bolivia.473\n\nBolivia's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6 57.\n\nBolivia's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6 58.\n\nBolivia's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6 67; Glencore International's response to the nationalization of the Colquiri Mine in Bolivia, 22 June 2012, **R-258**; Glencore Annual Report 2012, pp. 53 and 71, **R-257**.\n\nBolivia's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6 68.\n\n319.\n\nFinally, the Respondent indicates that \"the alleged facts that the Claimant takes issue with are unrelated to the Claimant's valuation date of 29 May 2012 in terms of timing. The Claimant's FET allegations target acts that Bolivia supposedly took either at the beginning of May 2012 or after the reversion of Colquiri. Thus, even if they were well-founded (*quod non*) they simply have no temporal connection with the Claimant's 29 May 2012 valuation date.\"474\n\nBolivia's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6 73.\n\n320.\n\nIn relation to the Claimant's proposed 4 June 2012 date of valuation, the Respondent contends that at that time, the Bolivian Government was only \"exploring the possibility of reverting the [Colquiri] Mine as one among various alternatives, and only as the 'last solution' in an 'extreme scenario,' were it to become necessary so as to prevent further violence. But as of 5 June 2012, nothing was yet finally decided \u2013 let alone publicly announced \u2013 by Bolivia.\"475 It also takes the view that \"[h]ad Glencore really known that Colquiri's Reversion was already decided, it would not have entered into the negotiations that led to the Rosario Agreement. Nor would its counter-party, the *cooperativistas*, have any reason to negotiate with Glencore, since, per [the] Claimant's position, by 5 June 2012, it would have been public knowledge that the [Colquiri] Mine would be reverted to the State. However, the Rosario Agreement was nonetheless negotiated and concluded on 7 June 2012, *i.e.*, two days after the alleged news of Colquiri's reversion \u2013 showing that [the] Claimant's new position is logically incoherent.\"476\n\nBolivia's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6 79.\n\nBolivia's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6 86.\n\n*i. Analysis by the Tribunal*\n-----------------------------\n\n321.\n\nThe decree reverting the Colquiri Mine to the government was published on 20 June 2012. Thus, the Claimant bears the burden of demonstrating that a different date is more appropriate for valuation purposes. The Tribunal finds it difficult to accept either of the dates proposed by the Claimant. Whilst it is true that on 30 May 2012 Glencore Bermuda lost possession of the Colquiri Mine, the Claimant continued to make decisions \"as if it had rights and control of the [Colquiri] Mine\" and acted accordingly in front of workers, *cooperativistas*, and its own shareholders.477 We interpret the Rosario Agreement as an effort to bring an end to the conflict and maintain the mine's normal operations. We conclude that the appropriate valuation date is 19 June 2012.\n\n\"The Colquiri [M]ine was nationalised on 22 June 2012 and is no longer reported in Sinchi Wayra's reserves and resources\". Glencore Annual Report 2012, p. 71, **R-257**. As Mr. Eskdale stated in his First Witness Statement, referring to the status of the Rosario Agreement negotiations as of 7 June 2012: \"*[w]e were relieved that the conflict was over. We had done our best to engage with the various stakeholders in order to reach a compromise that would have allowed us to resume production, protect the safety of our workers, and still be able to market the minerals extracted from the mine. For the first time in days we breathed and slept.*\" Eskdale First Witness Statement, \u00b6 94 (emphasis added). See also, Glencore International's response to the nationalization of the Colquiri Mine in Bolivia, 22 June 2012, **R-258.**\n\n322.\n\nRelatedly, with respect to the claims presented, aside from the expropriation claim, the Tribunal does see a disconnection between the dates proposed by the Claimant and the claims. However, considering our findings in Sections VI.3.B and VII.1.C.iii, we do not consider that this impacts our damages calculation in any material way.\n\n**B. Valuation Basis**\n----------------------\n\n323.\n\nThe Claimant puts forward its valuation based on two expansion plans: (i) the Triennial Plan (\"**Triennial Plan**\") and (ii) the March 2012 Investment Plan (\"**March 2012 Investment Plan**\"). First, a description of these plans is in order.\n\n*i. Triennial Plan478*\n----------------------\n\nColquiri Mine Three Year Plan 2012-2014, July 2011, **C-108**.\n\n324.\n\nThe Claimant's Colquiri valuation is hinged on the Triennial Plan, \"a three-year business plan that Glencore Bermuda approved in 2011.\"479 The Claimant argues that \"but-for Bolivia's wrongful conduct, Colquiri would have completed the expansion plans that were underway at that time\", increased the amount of ore that the Colquiri Mine and the Concentrator Plant would have extracted and processed, and begun operating the Tailings Plant.480 The latter was a planned project to build a plant to recover the tin and zinc from the old tailings left during approximately 60 years of operations of the Colquiri Mine (the \"**Tailings Plant**\").481 In support, the Claimant presents its expert's projections based on the Triennial Plan, and as to the Tailings Plant, it relied on a 2004 Feasibility Study \"that Glencore Bermuda adopted in 2005\".482 Colquiri maintains that \"the Colquiri expansion plans were not technically complex by the standards of the mining industry\", that \"[t]o increase the rate at which ore could be extracted from the Colquiri Mine, Glencore Bermuda was simply building a new ramp within the mine\" (a low-tech solution that would have doubled the rate at which ore could be extracted), and that \"after taking over the [Colquiri] Mine in 2012, [COMIBOL] decided to complete the construction of the same ramp in order to expand the output of the Mine (just as Glencore Bermuda planned)\".483 As to the Concentrator Plant, the Claimant alleges that it had \"planned to replace the Concentrator Plant's mill (for grinding the ore)[,] [\u2026] already purchased new 'flotation cells' for separating tin and zinc from the ore, and had budgeted to purchase 'thickening tanks' to manage the water used in the concentrating process\".484\n\nClaimant's Reply on Quantum, \u00b6 67.\n\nClaimant's Reply on Quantum, \u00b6 61.

See Claimant's Reply on Quantum, \u00b6 100.\n\n325.\n\nOn the other hand, the Respondent contests the use of the Triennial Plan as a basis for damages calculation for the following reasons: it is simply aspirational (*i.e.*, it is an internal document that was never seriously assessed (much less approved) by Colquiri's management); it does not include any economic,485 social or environmental analyses (all of which are fundamental to assess the viability of a plan of this nature), and that the investments, purchases, etc., that, per the Triennial Plan, were supposed to be undertaken between July 2011 (the Triennial Plan's date) and 20 June 2012 (the day on which the Colquiri Mine Lease was reverted) were not carried out.486 The Respondent also raises some inconsistencies between the Triennial Plan and contemporaneous documents such as *Colquiri's 2012 Production Budget*,487 *Sinchi Wayra's 2012 Production Budget*,488 and *Capital Expenditure* (\"**CAPEX**\") *and Projects Statement.*489\n\n\"As SRK noted in its first expert report, \"*[t]he Triennial Expansion Plan allegedly prepared by Colquiri in 2011 was a sort of \"Vision\", but the document does not have an economics section (to justify the high capital investment required) nor any analysis of investment returns.*\" Bolivia's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6 137 quoting SRK First Expert Report, \u00b6 58.\n\nBolivia's Statement of Defence, \u00b6 777.\n\n*Compa\u00f1\u00eda Minera Colquiri* Annual Budget for 2012, **R-33**, tab \"Planta\", cells O24, O26.

Analysis by the Tribunal\n---------------------------\n\n326.\n\nThe Tribunal cannot accept the Triennial Plan as a basis for the damages valuation. Given the Triennial Plan's projections for substantial expansion in terms of exploitation and production, substantial interactions within the company and consistency or alignment among budgets and projects were expected to be required to achieve the Triennial Plan's objectives. Moreover, one would expect supporting documents elaborating on the plan,490 but information on the plan is not in any material way made available as part of the evidentiary record. In addition, the plan was neither formally sanctioned by the company491 nor are clear intentions to implement its objectives before the mine was expropriated confirmed by contemporaneous evidence. For instance, the contemporaneous evidence shows no clear economic plan to achieve its objectives but instead the inconsistency between the plan and concurrent budgets or plans.492 Although some works for the expansion of the Colquiri Mine, such as the main ramp, were performed, it would be highly speculative to extrapolate or use that fact as a basis to accept all the goals or projections mentioned in the Triennial Plan, especially since there is no clear causal linkage between the contents of the Triennial Plan and the works performed.493\n\nDocuments produced by Claimant for Request 1, **R-423**; Documents produced by Claimant for Request 3, **R-420**; Documents produced by Claimant for Request 4, **R-424**. Several documents were provided, some were part of the Triennial Plan, others contained information on the expansion, alternatives envisioned, technical aspects, costs, a consultant's report, management reports, a contract for the excavation towards the ramp, a contract as project manager; however, while documents show prospecting work on these plans, we cannot find a basis of how those documents were elaborated and the analysis or evaluations that were made in order to form a solid evidentiary foundation of such project.\n\nSee Documents produced by Claimant for Request 3, **R-420**; Documents produced by Claimant for Request 4, **R-424**. Claimant presented several documents but among them, the Tribunal does not find a formal approval or documents reflecting an effective implementation of the Triennial Plan. Claimant indicates: \"[l]ater in 2011, the Triennial Plan was approved by Sinchi Wayra management in La Paz, and then presented the corresponding investment plan to Mr. Eskdale in his then role as Glencore's Senior Asset Manager for Global Operations. Mr. Eskdale approved the Triennial Plan and necessary capital expenditures in 2011\" (Claimant's Reply on Quantum, \u00b6 73). However, these assertions find support on two witness statements rather than on specific documents of internal management, budget planning or capital expenses that would be expected for such a project. The Tribunal is not fully convinced that a \"partial approval\" would suffice to render all of the Triennial Plan and the projections based on it as a solid basis for damages calculation.\n\nSee Bolivia's Reply Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, \u00b6\u00b6 23-26, 35-38.

March 2012 Investment Plan494*\n-----------------------------------\n\nMarch 2012 Investment Plan, 4 April 2012, **EO-07.**\n\n328.\n\nIn March 2012 (8 months after the Triennial Plan), Sinchi Wayra submitted to COMIBOL a new plan (the \"**March 2012 Investment Plan**\") which, in comparison to the Triennial Plan, was \"less ambitious\".495 In its post-hearing briefs, the Claimant indicated that the valuation should, \"at the very minimum,\" be based on this plan.496 In this regard, it seemed to depart from its previous view that the March 2012 Investment Plan would not be appropriate. According to the Claimant's expert, \"even if more recent to the date of valuation, the March 2012 [Investment] Plan does not appear to be a plan that Colquiri or Sinchi Wayra would have implemented if operating under a purely private-company model\".497 On the other hand, although the Respondent's expert considered it a \"good starting point\", he made it clear that further adjustments were warranted.498\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 12.\n\n\"In the alternative\". Claimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 30. \"Bolivia cannot assert that Colquiri was not expanding by May 2012 at least pursuant to the March 2012 Plan.

Analysis by the Tribunal\n---------------------------\n\n329.\n\nAs a basis for the valuation, the March 2012 Investment Plan is also problematic in the Tribunal's view. *First,* there are almost no supporting documents for the 7-page document.499 *Second*, there is no evidence that the Triennial Plan was ever approved or seriously considered as a basis for future plans by Glencore in the Colquiri Mine.500 It seems more like a working document that was updated regularly; for example, an updated version of this plan was produced in April. *Lastly*, the Claimant's last-minute support for this plan appears inconsistent with its own expert's opinion that the plan was not a valid valuation reference. Consequently, the Tribunal concludes that the March 2012 Investment Plan cannot serve as a suitable basis for Colquiri's valuation.\n\nMarch 2012 Investment Plan, 4 April 2012, **EO-07**; Sinchi Wayra S.A., Investments, March 2012, GB013973, **R-454**.\n\nClaimant indicates that: \"although Bolivia's experts prefer the March 2012 Investment Plan, Glencore Bermuda did not develop that plan until March 2012 (as the name implies), and though Glencore Bermuda had presented the plan to Bolivia in the context of negotiations, there is no evidence that the March 2012 Plan had been approved by Glencore Bermuda as a replacement for the Triennial Plan which it was already implementing in early 2012 around the same time that the March 2012 [Investment] Plan was completed.\" Claimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 22. \"I have reviewed this document and can confirm that it is an investment plan that Sinchi Wayra prepared in March 2012 at the request of Comibol in the context of the forced renegotiations of the mining contracts\". Eskdale Third Witness Statement, \u00b6 49.\n\n*iii. Non-Expansion Scenario*\n-----------------------------\n\n330.\n\nAfter the Hearing on Quantum, the Tribunal requested the Parties' experts to agree, and in the alternative, each to present an estimate of mineable material (including replenishment) based on the historical performance and the operating expenditures (\"**OPEX**\") without regard to the Triennial Plan. Additionally, the Tribunal requested a joint valuation model that included several variables, such as resources, reserves, production, head grades, recovery, concentrate grades, the Tailings Plant (production and CAPEX), OPEX, General & Administrative expenses (\"**G&A**\"), the Rosario Vein, Working Capital, First Year Apportionment and Life of the Mine (\"**LOM**\"). The model would include each Party's projection, estimates in accordance with certain variables of the March 2012 Investment Plan, as well as the Tribunal's requested estimates, *i.e.*, the non-expansion scenario.501\n\nLetter to the Parties, 22 September 2021, Annex.\n\n331.\n\nHaving rejected both plans, the Tribunal finds that this is the most likely scenario that a willing buyer would consider, and for this reason, it shall serve as the primary basis for the Tribunal's damages evaluation. On the basis of this joint model, the Tribunal will evaluate each variable and the areas of disagreement among the experts.\n\na. Mineral Reserves and Resources\n---------------------------------\n\n332.\n\nA mineral reserve is \"the economically mineable part of a Measured and/or Indicated Mineral Resource502 [\u2026].\"503 Additionally, \"[r]eserves represent the quantity of ore that can be economically extracted over the life of the mine with a reasonable level of certainty based on the known and expected technical parameters and economic environment at the time of the estimate. Resources include the ore making up the reserves estimate, but include additional ore for which the level of confidence for economic extraction is less than that of the ore making up the reserves estimate.\"504 The \"mine and replenish practice\", according to the Claimant, \"is customary practice in the mining industry, in the case of mines with large mineral deposits and a high degree of success in discovering new Mineral Resources and in converting Mineral Resources to Ore Reserves to carry only a portion of the mineralization as Ore Reserves. This is normally done in cases where the deposit has been demonstrated to be large and the conversion rate has been demonstrated to be consistent over time\".505\n\n\"A Mineral Resource is a concentration or occurrence of solid material of economic interest in or on the Earth's crust in such form, grade or quality and quantity that there are reasonable prospects for eventual economic extraction.\" *\"Mineral Resources are sub-divided, in order of increasing geological confidence, into Inferred, Indicated and Measured categories.

The Claimant submits that the values could be achieved based on the \"mine and replenish\" method.507 On the other hand, the Respondent contends that the mineable material should be 4.16 Mt after applying the discounts, subtracting the reserves depleted during 2012 (which results in 3.785 Mt of mineable material) and adding a 10% due to \"dilution at zero grade\".508 We will address both projections.\n\nRPA Second Expert Report, \u00b6 30.\n\nClaimant's Reply on Quantum, \u00b6\u00b6 81, 85 and 86.\n\nBolivia's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 34-43.\n\nb. The Mine and Replenish Method\n--------------------------------\n\n334.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, the mine and replenish method \"is customary practice in the mining industry, in the case of mines with large mineral deposits and a high degree of success in discovering new Mineral Resources and in converting Mineral Resources to Ore Reserves to carry only a portion of the mineralization as Ore Reserves. This is normally done in cases where the deposit has been demonstrated to be large and the conversion rate has been demonstrated to be consistent over time\".509 The Claimant posits that \"[o]ver the fourteen-year period from 2005 to 2018, Ore Reserves were replaced annually and it is reasonable to assume that this system of 'mine and replenish' would continue.\"510\n\nRPA First Expert Report, \u00b6 90.\n\nRPA Second Expert Report, \u00b6 34.\n\n335.\n\nGlencore Bermuda's witness, Mr. Lazcano, confirms that \"Colquiri's geological characteristics (large, continuous veins of minerals) and long track record of identifying new ore pursuant to the \"mine and replenish\" method made Sinchi Wayra confident that the [Colquiri] Mine had more than sufficient amounts of ore to sustain the extraction levels projected in the Triennial Plan through the expiration of the Colquiri [Mine] Lease in 2030\".511 Claimant's expert also contends that \"the practice of willing buyers paying for un-delineated minerals 'represents both the previous practice and the current reality' in the mining industry.\"512\n\nClaimant's Reply on Quantum, \u00b6 86.\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 28.\n\n336.\n\nThe Claimant further submits that \"[i]n 2014, [COMIBOL] published a document stating that [the] total Reserves and Resources at that time was 5,141,000 tonnes, providing a potential mine life of approximately 17 years at the production rate at that time of approximately 300,000 tonnes per year. This is an increase to the MROR estimate at the Mine Valuation Date [29 May 2012] of approximately 960,000 tonnes, despite the extraction that was carried out in the intervening period in the order of 900,000 tonnes of ore. The replacement during the period 2011 to 2014 was therefore approximately two million tonnes\".513 Moreover, the Claimant points to a statement made after the valuation date by Bolivia's witness, then General Manager of Empresa Minera Colquiri, \"confirm[ing] that the [Colquiri] Mine had sufficient ore to operate for another 15 years (*i.e.*, until 2030), and that [the then General Manager] expected that time horizon to increase to 40 years based on exploration studies then underway.\"514\n\nRPA First Expert Report, \u00b6 93.\n\nClaimant's Reply on Quantum, \u00b6 88.

Analysis by the Tribunal\n---------------------------\n\n338.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that historically there has been replenishment of the mineable material. The Tribunal understands that, considering the replenishment history of the mine, the issue at hand is one of how much mineable material would likely be available for extraction over time. The Claimant contends that Colquiri would have continued to replenish after May 2012 the reserves and resources that had been identified at the Colquiri Mine,521 and thus, replenishment would have allowed for the expansion plans provided by the Triennial Plan or the March 2012 Investment Plan. However, based on the lack of supporting evidence, it would be highly speculative to anticipate that the replenishment would be of such magnitude as to reach the amount of mineable material needed to meet the ore production targets set by the Triennial Plan.\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 24; Claimant's Post-Hearing Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 4 and 20.\n\n339.\n\nOn the other hand, the Respondent alleges that replenishment has already been taken into account in its calculation. We will now address this issue.\n\n340.\n\nBased on the testimony of Eng. Moreira, the Respondent's experts applied a 10% discount to reserves. According to Eng. Moreira, \"'*not everything that qualifies as a reserve reaches production*' (only 90% reaches production) because 10% of the reserves are left inside the mine as pillars for stability and safety reasons.\"522 Dr. Rigby explained at the Hearing on Quantum that this is consistent with Colquiri's practice of reporting reserves without applying a mining recovery factor and only applying such factor when planning production, as noted by Glencore in its due diligence. He stated that he \"*applied a 10 percent deduction for sill and collection drive pillars because [\u2026] at the Reserve estimation stage those pillars are not accounted for. They're only accounted for by mine planning*\".523 The Claimant's due diligence report for the Colquiri Mine stated that \"*[t]he reserve has not factored in a mine recovery; however, a [mining] recovery of 85% is used by the planning department*\". That is, Glencore applied a mining recovery discount of 15% to Colquiri's reserves when it acquired the Colquiri Mine Lease (higher than the 10% discount proposed by Dr. Rigby).524 The Claimant contends that under the Australian Joint Ore Reserves Committee Code [the JORC Code], the reductions that the Respondent's expert proposes for ore reserves are already accounted for in the calculation of ore reserves, and therefore, further reductions would result in double reductions and be improper pursuant to that code.525\n\nSRK First Expert Report, \u00b6 52.\n\nBolivia's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 41 and Transcript, Hearing on Quantum, Day 4, p. 549, lines 12-15 (Dr. Rigby).

See also Claimant's Reply on Quantum, \u00b6 83.\n\n341.\n\nWith respect to resources, the Respondent's expert in its first report, based on the advice of Eng. Moreira, indicated that \"[r]esources must be factored by 60% as experienced by Colquiri operating history.\"526 In its second report, the Respondent's expert alleged that the basis for this 40% discount \"is the operating experience at Colquiri Mine over many years. According to Colquiri's resource and reserve statements in 2012, approximately 70% of the delineated mineral resources is in the [i]nferred category, implying a low level of geological certainty\".527 The Respondent also contends that \"if anything, [its expert] SRK's analysis is conservative\"528 and \"neither Claimant nor its experts have rebutted Eng. Moreira's technical explanation that, historically, only 60% of the Colquiri resources become reserves.\"529 During the Hearing on Quantum, the Respondent's expert put forward another explanation for the 40% discount. Dr. Rigby explained that he took into account a \"*15% discount that accounts for the geological uncertainty of resources*\"530 and a \"*25% mining recovery discount to resources resulting from (i) a 15% deduction for 'inter stope rib pillars left in place to ensure stope stability*' (*i.e.*, vertical pillars), and (ii) a 10% deduction for '*sill and collection drive pillars left in place*' (*i.e.*, horizontal pillars)\"531 (emphasis added). Conversely, the Claimant argues that \"while some mineral resources may not be converted to ore reserves, SRK (the Respondent's expert) provides no support for the low conversion rate that would result from a 40% reduction in mineral resources, and that [the] high rate of reduction is contrary to Colquiri's long history of replenishing MROR.\"532\n\nSRK First Expert Report, \u00b6 53.\n\nSRK Second Expert Report, \u00b6 33.\n\nBolivia's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6 395.\n\nBolivia's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6 391.\n\nBolivia's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 36.\n\nBolivia's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 38.

Both discounts were based on the testimony of Eng. Moreira. He did not attend the Hearing on Quantum and, consequently, could not be cross-examined on this issue. Moreover, in the case of reserves and resources, the Respondent's expert provides no solid basis for the 10% and 40% discounts.533 Finally with respect to resources, the new argument put forward by the Respondent's expert also lacks evidentiary support.534\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 21 and 22. SRK Second Expert Report, \u00b6\u00b6 32 and 33.\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Reply, \u00b6 22.\n\n343.\n\nFor all the above reasons, the Tribunal finds that it is reasonable to take the 1,555 tonnes of reserves and 4,181 tonnes of resources as the starting point of the valuation. In addition, given the replenishment history of the Colquiri Mine, the Tribunal also finds that the mineable material would be sufficient to maintain historic extraction levels (*i.e.*, 307,000 tonnes per year).\n\n**C. Production**\n-----------------\n\n344.\n\nFor its Discounted Cash Flow (\"**DCF**\") model, the Claimant's expert used the latest Triennial Plan as a basis along with other inputs. According to the Claimant, \"[i]n the Colquiri Triennial Plan prepared on July 2011, Colquiri envisioned an increase in ore production to 550,579 tonnes per year by 2014.\"535 The plan also envisioned doubling the ore processing. \"The existing capacity of the Colquiri Mine Concentrator as of the Mine Valuation Date [29 May 2012] was 1,000 tpd of ore processed\". The Claimant submits that one of the key objectives of the Triennial Plan was to increase the processing rates of the Colquiri Mine to approximately 2,000 tpd (550 ktpa) of ore extracted and 2,000 tpd of ore processed by the end of 2014.536 According to the Claimant, the expansion was intended to allow Glencore Bermuda to take advantage of then high mineral prices and to commercialize the large quantity of minerals present in the Colquiri Mine and the old tailings. Glencore Bermuda's expansion plans were four-fold:537\n\n\u2022 Expanding Colquiri's *capacity* to extract ore from the Colquiri Mine;\n\n\u2022 Expanding the capacity of the existing Concentrator Plant to process *additional* ore;\n\n\u2022 Building a *new concentrator plant to reprocess* the minerals retained in the Colquiri Mine's old tailings; and\n\n\u2022 Expanding its tailings *storage facilities*.\n\nCompass Lexecon First Expert Report, 15 August 2017, \u00b6 51.\n\nRPA Second Expert Report, \u00b6 52.\n\nClaimant's Reply on Quantum, \u00b6 38.\n\n345.\n\nThe Claimant also points to the fact that COMIBOL recently announced \"it[s] plans to construct a new concentrator to process the old tailings, just as Glencore Bermuda planned to do, confirming that, contrary to SRK's assertions, Bolivia itself believes that it makes sense economically to reprocess Colquiri's old tailings.\"538\n\nClaimant's Reply on Quantum, \u00b6 89.\n\n346.\n\nConversely, the Respondent takes issue with the expansion of extraction and ore processing. Bolivia contends that \"despite all the investments made *ex post* by State-owned Colquiri to increase the [p]lant's ore processing levels (with an investment of US $ 2 M approx.), between 2013 and 2019 the [p]lant has only processed an annual average of 369,960 MT [\u2026] *i.e.*, 30% less than the annual average of 527,686 MT assumed by [the] Claimant during this same period\".539\n\nBolivia's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6 444.\n\n*i. Expanding Extraction Capacity: Main Ramp*\n---------------------------------------------\n\n347.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, to expand the Colquiri Mine, \"Colquiri had dug deeper into the Colquiri deposit, creating work areas at different depths and expanding the width of those work areas\". In order to extract 550,500 tonnes of ore per year as forecasted in the Triennial Plan, Colquiri planned to build a \"new ramp within the [Colquiri] Mine by which trucks would transport ore out of lower levels of the [Colquiri] Mine\". By May 2012, Colquiri had begun constructing the new ramp, as confirmed by Bolivia's own witness Eng. Moreira. The contract to build the ramp provided that it would be completed by July 2013\u2014*i.e.*, five months before the Colquiri Mine was projected to have begun to extract 550,500 tonnes of ore per year.540 According to the Claimant's witness, Mr. Lazcano, the construction of the main ramp would have taken 15 months.541 To the Respondent this is \"unrealistic\".542 It contends that Glencore's own contemporaneous documents show longer timeframes543 and that the construction of the main ramp took, in reality, several years.544 The main ramp was built in 2017 at a cost of US$11.6 million, as opposed to the US$4.2 million considered in the Claimant's valuation.545\n\nClaimant's Reply on Quantum, \u00b6 75(b).\n\nLazcano Third Witness Statement, fn. 56; Construction contract between Colquiri and Arcal Mineros, 14 March 2012, p. 1, **C-325**.\n\nBolivia's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6 437 and Bolivia's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 60.\n\n\"The time determined by the Company is 20 months.\" (Unofficial translation).

Capacity\n-----------\n\n348.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, until the ramp was completed in 2014, \"the Colquiri Mine's existing infrastructure would have been sufficient to support the extraction levels projected in the Triennial Plan\".546 According to the Respondent, \"[i]f, as Mr. Lazcano now says, there was no need for the Main Ramp to increase production and tin prices reached a record high in 2011, why did Glencore never produce[] more than 356,178 MT before reversion? Simply because the [Colquiri] Mine could not produce more. In the 2005-2011 period, Colquiri's actual extraction levels have always been below [the] Claimant's forecasts (and Glencore was even forecasting a decrease in extraction levels since 2009)\".547\n\nClaimant's Reply on Quantum, \u00b6 95.\n\nBolivia's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6 411.\n\nb. Bottle Necks\n---------------\n\n*Claimant's Reply on Quantum*, p. 58; SRK Second Expert Report, p. 19.\n\n349.\n\nThe Respondent posits that the main ramp *would not solve* the problems posed by the Colquiri Mine's bottlenecks. It points out that, \"given that the main ramp only connects level -405 to the surface, the capacity constraints to the transportation of ore from levels below -405 to level -405 (through the San Jos\u00e9 winze) remain, which in turn, limits the amount of ore that reaches the Concentrator Plant, affecting its processing levels and making it impossible to achieve the Claimant's production forecasts\".548 In this vein, Bolivia alleges that the Claimant ignores that the San Jos\u00e9 and Victoria winzes \"are bottlenecks that make it impossible to transport the 550,579 MT of mineralized material per year that its valuation assumes\",549 and \"[a]ny increase in extraction levels was subject to the capacity and limitations of these winzes\", which are bottlenecks that make it physically impossible to reach the Claimant's projected extraction levels and, in consequence, its projected production levels.550\n\nBolivia's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6 176.\n\nBolivia's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6 175.\n\nBolivia's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6 410.\n\nc. Victoria Winze\n-----------------\n\n350.\n\nThe Victoria winze \"is a main ore hoisting facility as well as the service and man entry for the lower mine levels\".551 According to the Respondent, Glencore argues that (i) the Victoria winze could transport more than 390,000 MT per year, thus it would have been able to sustain the extraction levels assumed by the Claimant's valuation for 2012 (360,000 TM) and 2013 (390,000 TM), and (ii) that, by 2014, the main ramp connecting level -405 to the Colquiri Mine surface would have been built, allowing the increase of transport capacity to 550,500 MT per year.552\n\nRPA First Expert Report, \u00b6 101.\n\nBolivia's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6 427.\n\n351.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, the alleged capacity of the Victoria winze is unsupported,553 for the following reasons: Glencore's contemporaneous documents confirm that, before the reversion, the Victoria winze was already working at full capacity. A Sinchi Wayra report prepared in 2010, when Colquiri's annual extraction levels averaged 278,678 MT (*i.e.*, 77% of the extraction level assumed by the Claimant in 2012, 71% compared to 2013 and 50% compared to 2014), states that: \"*[t]he mine is ready to increase its production, the main problem why these goals cannot be accomplished is because the infrastructure of the Victoria winze does not allow it, it is currently at its maximum capacity*\"*.*554 In the Respondent's view, the Claimant cannot seriously contend that the Victoria winze could support by itself \u2013 *i.e.*, without the main ramp \u2013 \"an annual extraction rate of 390,000 MT; a new shaft would be needed to increase extraction levels\". It alleges that \"Compass Lexecon's valuation ignores the need for this new shaft; the valuation does not consider the cost of building the shaft or the time that this would have taken\".555\n\nBolivia's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6 428.\n\nColquiri S.A.

See also Bolivia's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6 431.\n\nBolivia's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6 432.\n\n352.\n\nFinally, Mr. Lazcano's analysis assumes that the Victoria winze works seamlessly and uninterruptedly at full nominal capacity \"*at least 14 hours per day*\".556 This is false. Historically, the bearings, skips, etc. of the Victoria winze have experienced, and continue to experience, recurrent mechanical and electrical failures, which limit the winze's working hours and the amount of material it can transport.557\n\nLazcano Third Witness Statement, fn. 46.\n\nBolivia's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6 434.\n\nd. San Jos\u00e9 Winze\n-----------------\n\n353.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, it is undisputed that, under the Claimant's expansion plans, most of the additional mineralized material would come from levels below -405. Any production from these levels would have to be transported to the surface first through the San Jos\u00e9 winze (which connects levels below -405 to level -405) and, thereafter, through the Victoria winze (which connects levels -405 to the surface).558 The Respondent indicates that \"[t]he [Colquiri] Mine's extraction rate would have been effectively capped by the San Jose winze's extraction capacity, as happens in reality\"559 and that the due diligence report prepared by Glencore in 2004 describes the San Jos\u00e9 winze as a \"*possible bottle neck*.\"560\n\nBolivia's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6 174.\n\nBolivia's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6 439.

Glencore Internal Memo, 2004, p. 6, **R-302**.\n\n354.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, the San Jos\u00e9 winze would not have been a bottleneck because it had the capacity to transport, at least, 900 tpd.561 In this regard, Bolivia contends that the exhibit referenced only shows certain characteristics of the winze. As explained by Eng. Moreira, the winze's maximum capacity was around 300 tpd.562 The Claimant also alleges that the San Jos\u00e9 winze capacity could be expanded by: replacing the existent winze by another one with more power, and adding another *skip* to it.563 According to the Respondent, even if this was accurate, it still does not address or explain how the San Jos\u00e9 winze could have extracted the 2,000 tpd assumed by the Claimant's valuation (*i.e.*, more than double the 900 tpd calculated by Mr. Lazcano).564\n\nLazcano Third Witness Statement, \u00b6 37; Technical characteristics of the San Jose and Victoria winches, 11 December 2017, pp. 1-2, **R-37**.\n\nBolivia's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6 417.\n\nBolivia's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6 415.\n\nBolivia's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6 416.\n\n355.\n\nThe Claimant also contends that \"Colquiri had approved a US$1.2 million investment to increase its extraction capacity during the ramp-up period.\"565 The Respondent replies that this is just \"a '*stay in business*' investment in the winze of US $1.2 M (as opposed to an '*expansion investment*')\". In its view, exhibit **R-34** confirms that \"*[w]hile it was planned to make an investment in that winch, it was only to replace the engine and improve its reliability. Not to increase production*\",566 and this is consistent with contemporaneous Colquiri reports showing that the winze's engine was old and was experiencing technical problems on a regular basis.567 Finally, the Respondent alleges that historically, the San Jos\u00e9 winze has experienced, and continues to experience, mechanical problems, which limit the winze's working hours and the amount of material it can car568\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Reply, \u00b6 29.\n\nMoreira First Witness Statement, \u00b6 47.\n\nBolivia's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6 418.\n\nBolivia's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6 421.\n\ne. Concentrator Plant\n---------------------\n\n356.\n\n\"[T]he Triennial Plan provided for the expansion of the processing capacity of the Concentrator Plant from 1,000 to 2,000 tonnes of ore per day to be able to process the 550,500 tonnes of ore that would be extracted from the Colquiri Mine each year beginning in 2014. A Colquiri report from the first quarter of 2012 stated that these expansion plans for the Plant were on 'average' 20.7% complete\". \"In its report dated August 2011, Holland & Holland concluded that the expansion plan was feasible, observed that the Concentrator Plant was already being improved, and provided recommendations for the expansion\".569\n\nClaimant's Reply on Quantum, \u00b6 75(c); Colquiri first quarter analysis, April 2012, pp. 28-33, **C-326**; Report on the expansion of Colquiri and Bolivar Concentrator Operations of Sinchi Wayra SA, Holland and Holland Consultants, August 2011, pp. 12-15, **C-323**.\n\n357.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, \"the Claimant's assumption that, but for the reversion, the Plant would have been processing 2.000 tpd already by 2014 is disproved by other documents submitted by the Claimant in this arbitration. For instance, a report prepared, at the Claimant's request, by consultants from Holland and Holland in September 2011 shows that an expansion of the Plant would have taken, at least, \"*a nominal 3-4 year period [\u2026]*.\" Therefore, in the Respondent's view, \"even assuming *arguendo* that the Plant's expansion works started in 2012, these works could only have been completed by 2015-2016 (and this is a nominal period, so most likely to be extended)\".570 The report states that \"[t]he [P]lant expansion from 1000 tpd to 2,000 tpd will take place over a nominal 3-4 year period and will be based upon a staged approach of 1200, 1500, and ultimately 2,000 tpd. [\u2026] It is known that the present equipment is not capable of the ultimate 2,000 tpd plant. However as and when the limit of the present equipment is achieved, the expansion to 2000 tpd will be reviewed.

The \"*Formulario de Nivel de Categorizaci\u00f3n Ambiental*\" for the new concentrator plant shows that the \"the current [plant will] paralyze its functioning when the new one starts operating,\" which would render the Claimant's argument inaccurate.574\n\nClaimant's Reply on Quantum, \u00b6 89.\n\nBolivia's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6 535 (unofficial Translation).

New Tailings Storage Facility\n--------------------------------\n\n360.\n\nTo store the tailings that would have been produced by the Tailings Plant and the expanded Concentrator Plant, Colquiri had prepared engineering plans to expand the storage capacity of an existing tailings storage facility and purchased an easement over land where it planned to build a new tailings storage facility (the \"**TSF**\").575\n\nClaimant's Reply on Quantum, \u00b675(d).\n\n361.\n\nThe Respondent contests RPA's statement that the creation of storage capacity would be required until 2024, when the old tailings facility will be mined out and can be filled with new tailings.576 According to the Respondent's expert, \"even if this project was implemented and the old tailings mined out, it would only provide a possible site for the disposal of new tailings.\" The Respondent's expert points out that the old tailings dam is over 60 years old and was constructed at a time when design criteria and engineering standards were different from what they are today, indicating that this site \"would still have to undergo extensive site preparation and engineering works and would likely require the placement of a geomembrane liner in view of the pyrite content and sulfidic nature of the future new tailings\".577\n\nRPA Second Expert Report, \u00b6 172.\n\nSRK Second Expert Report, \u00b6 69.\n\n*ii.

Water\n--------\n\n363.\n\nThe Claimant alleges that it did consider the water and electricity needed for the expansion. It explains that the Triennial Plan and 2004 Feasibility Study accounted for the water that would be consumed by the expanded Concentrator Plant and the Tailings Plant. In this regard, \"the water was to be sourced from Colquiri's tailings storage facilities (as was the practice as of May 2012), and the installation of [\u2026] thickening tanks would have recycled water used in the concentrating process\".579\n\nClaimant's Reply on Quantum, \u00b6 99.\n\n364.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, the Claimant and its experts fail to consider the vast amounts of energy and water supply that would be needed to sustain production levels almost twice as high as the ones in 2011. The Respondent points out that this is all the more so under the Claimant's assumption that the Tailings Plant would have been developed, as processing levels would increase to a staggering 5,000 tpd.580 Finally, in the Respondent's view, the Claimant ignores the water shortage problems that also affect Colquiri's operations on a regular basis, and which are described in several Colquiri reports:581\n\n\u2022 \"[t]he quality of the tin and zinc concentrates were below budget due to lack of water for process [\u2026]\";\n\n\u2022 \"[\u2026] The lack of water for the process is affecting the metallurgical performance\";\n\n\u2022 \"The activities of mine production were not normal, because of [\u2026] lack of water and air during the month\".582\n\nBolivia's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6 177.\n\nBolivia's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6 462.\n\nSinchi Wayra S.A.

Electricity\n--------------\n\n365.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, the Triennial Plan provided for the installation of an additional 2.3 megawatts of power generating capacity, which would have increased Colquiri's aggregate power and would have been sufficient to process over 5,300 tonnes of ore and tailings a day (at least 300 tonnes more material than the amount that would have been processed by the expanded Concentrator Plant and the Tailings Plant combined). The Claimant also submits that its expert reviewed these plans and agreed there would have been enough water and electricity, and that it would have been technically feasible to operate the expanded Colquiri Mine, the Concentrator Plant and the Tailings Plant.583\n\nClaimant's Reply on Quantum, \u00b6100 and RPA Second Expert Report, \u00b6 171.\n\n366.\n\nFor its part, the Respondent alleges \"that the Claimant ignores the electrical shortages and power cuts that affect the Colquiri Mine and plant operations on a regular basis, as recounted in several Colquiri reports prepared both before and after the reversion\":584\n\n\u2022 \"plant treated [\u2026] below budget due to lost hours for electrical shortages [\u2026]\";\n\n\u2022 \"During the month of May, the plant treated 19,870 tonnes of ore, 24% below budget due to lost hours for electrical shortages [\u2026], which created almost one week lost of operations\";\n\n\u2022 \"Mine production was below budget because of [\u2026] external power cuts due to bad weather (winds and snowfall)\";\n\n\u2022 \"[\u2026] due to the constant and sudden energy cuts coming from the National Integrated System (SIN) affecting the metallurgic process and the horizontal and vertical extraction systems\".585\n\nBolivia's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6 461.\n\nSinchi Wayra S.A.

Analysis by the Tribunal*\n-------------------------------\n\n367.\n\nThe Claimant asserts that, in accordance with the Triennial Plan, ore extraction and processing would need to be doubled in three years. The Tribunal has already determined that we do not consider the Triennial Plan to be a realistic basis for the mine valuation and that it would be speculative to assume that the replenishment would be sufficient to meet the Triennial Plan's extraction target. Nonetheless, the Tribunal will revisit the expansion plans to determine whether a willing buyer would have valued the Colquiri Mine based on the projections for ore extraction and processing contained in the Triennial Plan.\n\n368.\n\nWith respect to the main ramp, both Parties concur that this is a project that will increase extraction capacity. However, the rate and scale at which this would have occurred are unknown. The estimated cost and duration for this project's construction in the Triennial Plan were unrealistic. Regarding the Claimant's assertion that the existing Colquiri Mine infrastructure would suffice to achieve the Triennial Plan levels until the ramp was completed, we believe there is insufficient evidence to support such a substantial increase compared to historic extraction levels. In addition, there is no evidence as to how the \"bottlenecks\" (Victoria and San Jos\u00e9 winzes) would allow the substantial increase in capacity from historical levels and, in particular, how problems with their operation identified by the Respondent would be resolved.\n\n369.\n\nIn the case of the Concentrator Plant, contemporaneous documents indicating that it would require considerable change in equipment586 and that the desired increase in capacity is more modest cast doubt on the plant's capacity and increase in capacity (1,300 TMS as opposed to 2,000 TMS). Regarding the TSF, the Tribunal is not persuaded that the Claimant has addressed the viability of this project using the same site and how this project aligns with the Triennial Plan projections. According to Mr. Lazcano, \"[b]oth projects were relatively simple tasks that are carried out regularly as part of any ordinary mining operation [extending the existing tailings dam and constructing the new tailings dam]\"587.\n\nLazcano Third Witness Statement, \u00b6 18; Colquiri Mine Three Year Plan 2012-2014, July 2011, **C-108;** Colquiri Tailings Project, 2008, **C-91**.\n\nLazcano Third Witness Statement, \u00b6 55. \"[A]t the time of nationalization we had already identified the land where the New Tailings Dam would be built, and we had agreed with its owner the terms under which we would obtain the relevant mining easement\" [\u2026] \"The Triennial Plan established that, after having secured access to the necessary land, the design of the New Tailings Dam would be produced in 2012, which is why we had not yet created it by the time of nationalization\". Lazcano Third Witness Statement, \u00b6\u00b6 57 and 58.\n\n370.\n\nThe Claimant's expert indicated that \"[i]ncreasing tailings storage capacity is a continuous practice in mining operations and is something that mining companies do in their ordinary course of business and it only depends on land and funds, both of which were available at Colquiri\", and that \"a new TSF (TSF #4) was planned to receive tailings from the expanded [m]ine Concentrator [Plant] and the Tailings [Plant] [c]oncentrator. [\u2026] In relation to the construction of TSF #4, we have assumed that the additional 2.0 million tonnes of storage capacity would cost approximately US$2.0 million, based on prorating the construction costs used in the Triennial Plan\".588 However, for the Tribunal, concerns pointed out by the Respondent's expert that \"the Triennial Plan's construction costs relate to the expansion of an existing tailings dam by simply extending the height of the wall [\u2026] [and] [r]aising the embankment height of an existing dam is very different to constructing the initial embankment for a new dam [with the] construction [of the latter being] much more expensive as it involves much more engineering and foundation placement and site preparation\"589 remain unanswered. The viability and simplicity of the Triennial Plan remains unclear for the Tribunal.\n\nRPA Second Expert Report, \u00b6\u00b6 177, 178 and 179. \"RPA has added this capital expenditure of US$5.9 million (US$3.9 million for raise to 4,000 masl and US$2.0 million for TSF #4) to its revised cash flow model.\" \u00b6 180.\n\nSRK Second Expert Report, \u00b6 85.\n\n371.\n\nFinally, the Respondent has identified current and future problems with water and electricity that would result from the expansion. The Triennial Plan in fact addresses both issues. However, it is unclear how these issues would be tackled considering not only the substantial increase of extraction and production, but also the current water and electricity problems identified by the Respondent.\n\n372.\n\nIn light of the above, the Tribunal is not able to proceed on the basis that extraction and ore processing at the Colquiri Mine would be performed at the pace and scale provided for in the Triennial Plan.\n\n**D. Grade or Mineral Concentration**\n-------------------------------------\n\n373.\n\n\"The grade is the concentration of metal in a ton of mineralized material\" and is consequently fundamental to determine the revenue from mineralized material.590 Although metal may be present in ore, \"[t]here is a certain grade below which it is not economically viable to mine and process\".591 The head grade is \"the quantity of a given metal, in this case expressed as a percent, in a given quantity of material.\"592\n\nBolivia's Statement of Defence, \u00b6 748.\n\nSRK First Expert Report, \u00b6 45.\n\nRPA Second Expert Report, \u00b6 66.\n\n374.\n\nThe Claimant argues that \"RPA reviewed the head grades for the Colquiri Mine that are projected in the Triennial Plan (1.29% tin and 7.52% zinc) and confirmed that they are reasonable because, among other reasons, they are consistent with the actual head grades of the ore that the Concentrator Plant processed from 2006 to 2012.\" In its view, the Respondent's expert assertion that \"projected head grades should be reduced to bring them in line with the historical difference between the Colquiri Mine's reserve grades and actual mined head grades\" is misplaced. While the Claimant agrees that Colquiri's actual mined head grades were approximately 7% lower than its reserve grades, it indicates that the head grades estimated in the Triennial Plan already include this 7% discount, so no additional discount should be applied.593\n\nClaimant's Reply on Quantum, \u00b6 90.\n\n375.\n\nThe Respondent disputes that Claimant's valuation on the basis that it assumes \"unreasonably high and constant head grades\". Particularly, it indicates that \"the head grades for both tin (1.29%) and zinc (7.52%) projected by RPA (which would allegedly remain constant from 2014 until 2030) fail to account for dilution and are, thus, too elevated.\"594 According to the Respondent, the head grades estimated by the Claimant's expert RPA do not account for the substantial waste dilution that is incurred during the mining process.595 Moreover, the \"Claimant's experts have not undertaken any deep exploration that would allow them to predict grade continuity through the mineral deposit and this assumption is inconsistent with the reality of Colquiri.\" As explained by the Respondent's expert, \"future mining [\u2026] will negatively impact grades\".596\n\nBolivia's Statement of Defence, \u00b6 751.\n\nBolivia's Statement of Defence, \u00b6 803.\n\nBolivia's Statement of Defence, \u00b6 804.\n\n376.\n\nConversely, the Claimant contends that \"SRK's assertion that RPA's projections should be reduced because of an alleged downward trend in Colquiri head grades over time, based solely on 'a personal discussion with [Bolivia's witness] Engineer Moreira,' misconstrues the facts. The Colquiri Mine's head grades have varied over time, but are not trending downward. From 2005 to May 2012, the Colquiri Mine's average tin grade has remained consistent and average zinc grade has increased slightly. Further, ore grade has been demonstrated to increase with depth at Colquiri, and, as a result, it is reasonably likely that average head grades would have increased over the life of the Colquiri Lease as the Mine expanded to new depths.\"597\n\nClaimant's Reply on Quantum, \u00b6 91.\n\n*i. Analysis by the Tribunal*\n-----------------------------\n\n377.\n\nDespite being drawn from the Triennial Plan, the grades proposed by the Claimant are based on a methodology grounded on the difference between the historic mined and reserved grades. The Respondent contends that these grades do not account for dilution and are not based on deep exploration. However, the Respondent fails to explain the basis for its figures when the historical trend had not shown: (i) a substantial decrease in head grades;598 and (ii) that there is a correlation between depth and grade decrease.599 Furthermore, some of the figures seem to be based on Eng. Moreira's testimony, which could not be subject to cross-examination.600 For these reasons, the Tribunal finds that the grades proposed by the Claimant are more appropriate for valuation purposes.601\n\nRPA Second Expert Report, \u00b6 76; Claimant's Post-Hearing Reply, \u00b6 31.\n\nRPA Second Expert Report, \u00b6 77; Claimant's Post-Hearing Reply, \u00b6 32.\n\nSRK First Expert Report, \u00b6 62.\n\nExperts' letter to the Tribunal, 18 November 2021, p. 5.\n\n**E. Metallurgical Recovery Rates**\n-----------------------------------\n\n378.\n\nThe metallurgical recovery rate refers to \"the valuable metal recovered from a ton of mineral through metallurgical treatment\".602 The metallurgical recovery \"is the percentage of metal that is contained in the final saleable product (the mineral concentrate) after the mined material has been treated in the concentrator, and prior to smelting. For example, a head grade of 1.29% tin in one tonne of ore would contain 12.9 kg of tin. If the metallurgical recovery is 72%, the overall metal recovery will be 9.3 kg of tin.\"603\n\nBolivia's Statement of Defence, \u00b6 752.\n\nRPA Second Expert Report, \u00b6 79.\n\n379.\n\nBased on the projections for the Triennial Plan, the Claimant's expert \"projected average metallurgical recoveries of 72% for tin and 76% for zinc for the LOM (*i.e.*, until 2031), which would result in producing 24,224 tonnes of tin concentrate and 252,735 tonnes of zinc concentrate with grades of 50% for tin and 47% zinc\".604 According to the Respondent, average metallurgical recoveries between 2007 and 2012 were 68.21% for zinc and 63.62% for tin, which would confirm that the metallurgical recoveries in the Claimant's expert report are overstated.605 Bolivia also indicates that \"[h]istorical recovery rates for tin and zinc averaged 64.07% and 69.24%, respectively, between 2007 and 2011, but [the] Claimant assumes \u2013 relying solely on the Triennial Plan \u2013 that they would have reached historical maximums '*of 72% for tin and 76% for zinc*' in 2012, and would have remained constant ever after\". It is Bolivia's contention that this runs contrary to common sense.606\n\nRPA Second Expert Report, \u00b6 80.\n\nSRK First Expert Report, \u00b6 66.\n\nBolivia's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6\u00b6 477 and 476.\n\n*i. Analysis by the Tribunal*\n-----------------------------\n\n380.\n\nBased on the non-expansion scenario, the Parties' experts agreed that the recovery rate would be 69% for zinc and 65.8% for tin.607 The numbers are based on the actual average for 2005-2012. Consequently, the Tribunal deems this rate appropriate for the valuation.\n\nExperts' letter to the Tribunal, 18 November 2021, p. 3; Bolivia's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 77.\n\n**F. Operating Expenses (OPEX)**\n--------------------------------\n\n381.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, \"[t]he operating costs of Colquiri are driven by the mine site cash costs, which include mine, concentrator, maintenance, and indirect expenses. Operating costs per tonne of ore mined and processed averaged US$ 48.5 per tonne between 2006 and 2011 and were at US$ 61.5 per tonne for the first months of 2012.\" As for the Triennial Plan, operating costs per unit of ore processed are estimated to stabilize at US$47.7 per tonne in 2014. The Claimant indicates that \"the increase in production drives the reduction in unitary costs due to economies of scale\".608\n\nCompass Lexecon First Expert Report, \u00b6 54.\n\n382.\n\nOn the other hand, the Respondent proposes US$71.09 per MT for OPEX. For this, its expert report \"relies on the 2011 forecast of operating costs included in the Triennial Plan, US$ 57.63 per MT, subject to a 23% mark-up that is the average difference between budgeted operating costs and actual operating costs during the period from 2005 to 2010. This results in operating costs of US$ 71.09 per MT.\" The report indicates that replacing the operating cost estimates from the Triennial Plan with US$ 71.09 per MT reduces [the] Claimant's valuation by US$ 51.8 million, or 13.4%.609\n\nFlores First Expert Report, \u00b6 75.\n\n383.\n\nAccording to the Respondent's expert, the 2012 data is covers only up until May (five months) and may have to include catch-up costs for the full year. The 2011 operating costs of US$70 are flatlined, which is appropriate, since the DCF model is a real terms model with no future escalation. The Claimant's expert also flatlined the operating cost projections but at a much lower level of US$47.67/t, which the Respondent's expert considers \"far too optimistic and [\u2026] unrealistic\".610 The Respondent points as well to a due diligence report prepared by Glencore in 2004 (before acquiring the Assets), which \"acknowledges that '*as the mine gets deeper it will be difficult to maintain the same costs for the next 5 years, we estimated an increase value each 2 years of 5% in mine cost and 2% in maintenance by deeper exploration*'\", *i.e.*, an expectation of OPEX to increase as mining went deeper. In light of this, Bolivia argues that \"[t]here is no explanation for why this trend would not have continued after the reversion of the [Colquiri] Mine Lease\".611\n\nSRK Second Expert Report, \u00b6 63.\n\nBolivia's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6 501.\n\n*i. Analysis by the Tribunal*\n-----------------------------\n\n384.\n\nThe Claimant's expert proposes US$61.5 per tonne under the non-expansion scenario, based on actual costs from January to May 2012, adjusted annually for inflation. On the other hand, the Respondent's expert proposes US$69.9 per tonne, which is based on the actual costs from January to December 2011, as well as annual inflation adjustments. The Tribunal believes it is more appropriate to utilize the most recent figure, as it would be the most pertinent for a willing buyer. Thus, it deems US$61.5 per tonne, as proposed by the Claimant's expert, to be more appropriate.612\n\nExperts' letter to the Tribunal, 18 November 2021, p. 5; Claimant's Post-Hearing Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 35 and 36.\n\n**G. Capital Expenditures (CAPEX)**\n-----------------------------------\n\n385.\n\nThe Claimant projects that Colquiri would have had CAPEX of US$181.7 million between 2012 and the end of the Colquiri Mine Lease in 2030 (US$43.8 millions in expansion capital and US$137.9 million in sustaining capital through May 2030).613 Instead of relying on the Triennial Plan, the Respondent's expert made its own estimates for the CAPEX required to run the Colquiri Mine. It includes US$5 million as the annual sustaining CAPEX, as well as an extra US$25 million of CAPEX needed to make up for under investment, spread over five years. The Respondent notes that the implementation of both the Triennial Plan and the Tailings Plant would have required a new tailings dam, which the Claimant's experts do not consider.614\n\nClaimant's Reply on Quantum, \u00b6 104.\n\nFlores First Expert Report, \u00b6 44.\n\n386.\n\nAccording to the Claimant's expert, it is not clear what Bolivia means by \"catch up\" capital. It opines that \"as of 2012, the mine concentrator was operating at the design capacity of 1,000 tpd of ore processed; consequently, there was no reason for additional capital expenditures except for those made to expand the capacity\". The Claimant's expert argues as well that the purpose of this capital is not identified, and that the Respondent simply chooses an arbitrary number without providing any supporting information. The Claimant contends that its expert has reviewed the detailed capital cost allocations in the Triennial Plan and has forecast capital expenditures based on these estimates. Since the Respondent ignores the expansion plans, it does not assign any expansion capital. However, it does not dispute the Claimant's capital expenditure forecasts for the Colquiri Mine expansion. The Respondent's total capital estimate over the 20-year mine life is US$133.0 million.615\n\nRPA Second Expert Report, \u00b6 103.\n\n*i. Analysis by the Tribunal*\n-----------------------------\n\n387.\n\nIn the non-expansion scenario, the Parties' experts agreed on a sustaining CAPEX of US$4.84 million per year.616 However, disagreement remains on what the Respondent characterizes as \"catch up\"617 capital.618 In this regard, the Tribunal finds that there is no sufficient evidentiary foundation to take into account such capital, and it would be speculative to include it for valuation purposes.\n\nBolivia's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 88.\n\n\"[A]n increase in production rate from the 5-year average 277,309 tpy to 307,000 tpy would require some catch-up investment, at least of US$ 25 million during 2012-2017\". Bolivia's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 86. See also Bolivia's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 87.\n\nAt the Hearing on Quantum, Respondent's expert did not explain how the 25 million figure was calculated, why it would have been necessary for Colquiri's operation or how it would have been spent: \"Q. Dr. Flores, what counsel wants and we also want clarifications is we try to understand where the 25 million come from. A. Yeah. Q. And the question was more of whether you verify where the 25,000--25 million came up from. That is the thrust of what you have been asked. A. Yes, correct. And the short answer is no, I did not verify that because I just took that as an input from Dr. Rigby. [\u2026] A. Again, I cannot be--I'm not in a position to answer because I do not know the extent where the $25 million came from. Dr. Rigby is the one that could be able to help you with that.\" Transcript, Hearing on Quantum, Day 5, p. 830, lines 5-15, 21-24 (Dr. Flores). In his direct presentation, Dr. Rigby addressed the costs as follows: \"What I did include was basically 5 million per annum sustaining capital, and 5 million per annum of catch-up capital in the first five years [\u2026] And what I thought was, well, what feels like a right number? And I thought, I'm talking to 70, I'll apply $20 a ton for all-in sustaining costs that. That works out at the production rate of I'm projecting of about 4.3 million. I simply rounded that up to 5 million, and that explains my 5 million per annum sustaining capital in my life of mine. [\u2026] I then felt, because I was conscious reading the Sinchi Wayra reports, Annual Reports and everything, where consistently capital was significantly or substantially below budget. So, what we say in the industry, this Asset wasn't loved if it was starved of capital, and I thought that it was appropriate to apply maybe five years of captured capital to redress the undercapitalization that mine had experienced basically under Glencore ownership, so hopefully that explains my Capital Cost assumptions.\" Transcript, Hearing on Quantum, Day 4, p. 558, lines 16-18, p. 559, lines 2-8 and 12-20 (Dr. Rigby).\n\n**H. General & Administrative Costs**\n-------------------------------------\n\n388.\n\nIn its valuation the Claimant also includes US$2.0 million of G&A costs per year, based on the historical costs of Colquiri adjusted by annual inflation. The Claimant's expert calculates these costs based on Colquiri's financial statements and Sinchi Wayra's monthly reports.619 Conversely, the Respondent calculates that the G&A costs would be over US$19 million a year.620 The Claimant contends that the Respondent's expert's 11.2% assumption \"significantly deviates from the historical G&A costs; it involves double counting of royalties, which are accounted for under a separate category of costs; and it artificially inflates G&A costs by linking them to revenues (*i.e.*, variable costs), when G&A expenses involve mainly fixed costs.\" The Claimant's expert maintains that US$2.0 million per year for G&A expenses is in line with both the G&A expenses reported in Colquiri's financial statements (averaging US$1.4 million between 2007 and 2011) and Sinchi Wayra Monthly Reports (averaging US$1.7 million between 2007 and 2011).621\n\nCompass Lexecon First Expert Report, \u00b6 55; Claimant's Reply on Quantum, \u00b6 119; Compass Lexecon Second Expert Report, \u00b6 45.\n\nClaimant's Reply on Quantum, \u00b6 119; Flores First Expert Report, \u00b6 77, fn. 131; Flores Second Expert Report, \u00b6\u00b6 61-65.\n\nCompass Lexecon Second Expert Report, \u00b6 47.\n\n389.\n\nOn the other hand, the Respondent's expert contends that the Claimant did not explain how it arrived at the US$2.0 million figure. Based on the equivalent line item from the management reports that Compass Lexecon used for Vinto to estimate G&A expenses for Colquiri, it \"conclude[s] that future G&A expenses for Colquiri should be estimated as 11.2% of forecasted annual revenues\", that \"[i]n order for the ratio of G&A expenses to net revenues observed in the [m]anagement [r]eports to be comparable to the ratio applied to Compass Lexecon's model, the historical ratio should also include selling costs in the calculation of net revenues\" and that the Claimant \"fails to consider the implications of its own model, which expects to implement two different expansion projects, increasing the amount of ore mined by 99% and ramping up processing of ore from tailings from zero to 1,000,000 MT\". The Respondent indicates as well that it is \"unreasonable to assume that G&A expenses would remain constant at the historical levels under this scenario, as [the Claimant's expert] does.\"622\n\nFlores Second Expert Report, \u00b6\u00b6 61-64.\n\n*i. Analysis by the Tribunal*\n-----------------------------\n\n390.\n\nOn the basis of the non-expansion scenario, the Parties' experts agreed on an annual G&A budget of $2,310,000 (adjusted for inflation).623 Therefore, the Tribunal will apply this amount to the valuation.\n\nExperts' letter to the Tribunal, 18 November 2021, p. 3.\n\n**I. First Year Apportionment of Cash Flows**\n---------------------------------------------\n\n391.\n\nThe Claimant's second expert valuation adjusts 2012 cash flows to exclude cash flows generated between January and May 2012. According to the Claimant: \"[i]n our [f]irst [r]eport, we made the simplifying assumption of including full-year 2012 cash flows in our valuation given that cash was not removed from Colquiri in 2012 and the limited information we had on the working capital as of the valuation date\".624 The Respondent's second expert report takes issue with this since, even though it suggested excluding cash flows prior to the valuation date, the Claimant updated its model by \"removing the actual January through June 2012 data from projected annual estimates.\"625\n\nCompass Lexecon Second Expert Report, \u00b6 133 a).\n\nFlores Second Expert Report, \u00b6 80.\n\n392.\n\nAccording to the Respondent's expert, \"[t]his is an incorrect way to apportion the 2012 cash flows, because the cash flows in the model are a projection for the entire year, from January through December. [The] Claimant's performance during the first five to six months of 2012 was not factored into the projection of 2012 cash flows and, therefore, Compass Lexecon is mixing *ex ante* projections with historical results.\" The Respondent's expert indicates that \"the proper approach is to prorate the annual estimated cash flows based on the portion of the year remaining as of the Colquiri valuation date\".626\n\nFlores Second Expert Report, \u00b6 80.\n\n*i. Analysis by the Tribunal*\n-----------------------------\n\n393.\n\nThe Tribunal believes that dividing the estimated annual cash flows by the portion of the year remaining from the date of valuation is an appropriate method to avoid mixing projections with historical data.\n\n**J. The Rosario Agreement**\n----------------------------\n\n394.\n\nWe recall that the Rosario Agreement was signed on 7 June 2012 by Colquiri, whereby the Rosario vein was willingly assigned to certain cooperatives.627\n\nAgreement between Colquiri, FEDECOMIN, FENCOMIN, Central Local de Cooperativas Mineras de Colquiri, Cooperativa Minera Collpa Cota, Cooperativa Minera Socav\u00f3n Inca, Cooperativa 26 de Febrero and the Ministry of Mining, 7 June 2012, **C-35**.\n\n395.\n\nTo assess the \"market price\" of the unprocessed ore sold by the *cooperativa* to Colquiri, the Claimant's experts recommend a price based on Colquiri's mining cost plus a premium. In addition, they state that a percentage of profits from concentrate sales could be included to incentivize the *cooperativa* to mine higher-grade material, and that 2% of profits would be reasonable.628 On the other hand, the Respondent contends that \"[a]ny realistic compensation scheme has to reflect that the Colquiri Mine would have to provide compensation to the cooperatives recognizing their bargaining power. Not meeting compensation levels required by the cooperatives could provoke disruptions and compromise the stable operation of the mine. This economic reality cannot be ignored in an analysis of the impact of the Rosario Agreement on the valuation of the Colquiri Lease.\"629\n\nCompass Lexecon Second Expert Report*,* \u00b6 152.\n\nFlores Second Expert Report, \u00b6 84.\n\n*i. Analysis by the Tribunal*\n-----------------------------\n\n396.\n\nRegarding the impact of the Rosario Agreement on valuation, there are two issues. The first question is whether it should be considered at all for valuation purposes. In such a case, both experts offer alternative approaches to such an evaluation. Initially, the Tribunal is of the opinion that the Claimant was willing to renounce the Rosario vein in order to resolve the cooperatives issue and end the conflict at the Colquri Mine. We have determined that the valuation date is 19 June 2012. Consequently, prior to the expropriation, any willing buyer pretending to acquire the Colquri Mine Lease would have been required to account for the impact of the Rosario Agreement. In this regard, we believe that the Rosario Agreement should be considered for purposes of valuation.\n\n397.\n\nThe second concern is the impact of the Rosario Agreement on the valuation. Both sides' experts offer alternative approaches to this valuation. Regarding the Respondent's alternative, the Tribunal is of the opinion that the cooperatives' \"bargaining power\" brings a subjective element to the valuation. Thus, since the alternative proposed by the Claimant is directly based on the impact of price and profits, the Tribunal deems this alternative to be more appropriate.\n\n**K. Colquiri's Tailings Plant**\n--------------------------------\n\n398.\n\n\"The Colquiri Tailings [Plant] is situated in the immediate vicinity of the active Colquiri operation,\" and its purpose is to recover \"zinc and tin from old tailings left by [COMIBOL] and other past operators\".630 The plan was to recover approximately 10 million tonnes of old tailings, at a grade of 0.51% tin and 4.21% zinc.631 The Claimant's valuation expert, Compass Lexecon, explains that a non-operating asset may be valued pursuant to the DCF method when, as is the case for the Tailings Plant, there is \"sufficient information regarding the asset to forecast lost profits\".632\n\n\"The Colquiri tailings were nationalized along with the [Colquri] Mine.\" RPA First Expert Report, \u00b6 127.\n\nCompass Lexecon First Expert Report, \u00b6 56.\n\nClaimant's Reply on Quantum*,* \u00b6 53; Compass Lexecon Second Expert Report, fn. 5.\n\n399.\n\nThe Respondent replies that the Claimant's valuation of the Tailings Plant (representing more than US$100 million of the damages claimed for Colquiri) is \"inherently speculative\" and that \"[a]lthough no one has ever operated this [p]roject, [the] Claimant's experts' value\" is based on the DCF method, \"assuming it is a going concern with a proven record of profitability\", which \"results in an arbitrary and highly speculative valuation.\"633\n\nBolivia's Statement of Defence, \u00b6 827.\n\n400.\n\nThe Respondent also posits that \"any willing buyer would have placed significant weight in the fact that Sinchi Wayra never developed this project. Under [the] Claimant's account, it purportedly acquired control of the Colquiri Mine in March 2005, thus having 7 \u00bd years (*i.e.*, between March 2005 and June 2012, when the [Colquiri] Mine Lease was reverted) to develop this project. It did not do so, and neither RPA nor Compass Lexecon explain why. The only reasonable assumption a willing buyer would have made in 2012 is that the [p]roject's economic viability was not enough to meet [the] Claimant's hurdle rate. Indeed, this [p]roject was the subject of several feasibility studies in the 1980s and early 2000s (studies prepared by Minproc in 1988 and by PAH in 2004) and, still, to date, no mine operator has invested [in] it.\"634\n\nBolivia's Statement of Defence, \u00b6 829.\n\n401.\n\nMoreover, according to the Respondent, \"neither the Triennial Plan nor the March 2012 Investment Plan\" (prepared 9 and 2 months prior to Colquiri's reversion, respectively) mention the Tailings Plant.635 It places emphasis as well on the fact that, during the document production phase, \"Bolivia requested (and the Tribunal ordered) [the] Claimant to produce '*[d]ocuments and [c]ommunications prepared and/or reviewed by Colquiri and/or Sinchi Wayra and/or the Glencore Group during the period 2004-2012 that refer to the assessment and/or feasibility of the [Tailings Plant] [\u2026]*'\", but the \"Claimant failed to produce any documents showing that it had taken steps to approve or implement the [Tailings Plant]\". On the contrary, [the] Claimant produced one contemporary document (the February 2012 Capital Expenditures and Projects Statement) which shows that capital expenses were neither budgeted nor approved for this project in 2010, 2011 or 2012, thus confirming that [the] Claimant had not approved this project nor had any plans of implementing it\".636\n\nBolivia's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6 512.

However, as the Respondent's expert explains, \"[COMIBOL] had sampled only the centre of the old tailings dam, but not the periphery.\" The Pincock report reached the same conclusion.642 In Bolivia's view, \"[h]ad [the] Claimant seriously considered the [p]roject, it would have completed the preliminary sampling conducted by [COMIBOL] between 1978 and 1990 to determine with a reasonable degree of certainty the quantity of available mineral and its head grade\" but it did not.643\n\nBolivia's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6 528.\n\nBolivia's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6 529.\n\n405.\n\nConversely, the Claimant contends that \"in 2006 and 2007, [it] invested approximately US$1.2 million building the platform on which the Tailings Plant was to be constructed and purchasing related materials.\"644 The Claimant also alleges that in the period between 2011 and May 2012 it advanced its plans to construct the Tailings Plant as well as the expansion of the Colquiri Mine and the Concentrator Plant. In particular, it argues that it \"[c]onducted a new study to confirm the stability of the platform (constructed in 2007) where the Tailings Plant was to be built and reached an agreement with the Cooperativa 21 de Diciembre*,* which had been mining an area in Colquiri's old tailings storage facility (equal to approximately 5% of the facility's surface area), to abandon the tailings so that Colquiri could mine them.\"645\n\nClaimant's Reply on Quantum, \u00b6 70; Claimant's Post-Hearing Reply, \u00b6 40.\n\nClaimant's Reply on Quantum, \u00b6 75 (a).\n\n406.\n\nIn its Post-Hearing Reply, whilst the Respondent indicates that \"Dr. Rigby acknowledged that a document prepared [...] states that Sinchi Wayra had spent US$ 1.2 million on the [p]roject in '*preparatory works and drilling'*\", it mentions that \"Dr. Rigby also noted that the amount spent '*was a tiny fraction of the Capital Costs to implement the [p]roject*\" [...], which the same document puts at US$ 26 million\".646 The Respondent also alleges that \"Sinchi Wayra's January 2007 monthly report notes that the US$ 1.2 million '*includes all costs which occurred from October 2004 until [\u2026] February 2007*' [\u2026] (that is, it includes investments by Sinchi Wayra *before* being acquired by Glencore in March 2005). For what we know, it may even include the costs of the 2004 Feasibility Study\".647 Finally, the Respondent posits that the \"Claimant has not produced any evidence showing that it invested any more capital in the [p]roject after January 2007 (*i.e*., 5 years prior to the date of valuation), which a willing buyer would see as a red flag\".648\n\nTranscript, Hearing on Quantum, Day 4, p. 629, lines 8-19 (Dr. Rigby).

Glencore Bermuda paid US$31.8 million in 2005 for the rights to build and operate the Tailings Plant, and it had invested over one million dollars in the development of the Plant prior to its taking in May 2012\".649 In light of this, it requested \"[a]t a minimum, [to be] awarded the price that it paid in March 2005 for the right to the Tailings Plant (US$31.8 million) indexed for inflation to the date of taking in May 2012 for a total of US$38.3 million.\"650 The Respondent replies that this request \"constitutes a belated new claim (which is inadmissible at this late stage of the proceedings) and for which, in any event, [the] Claimant has provided no legal basis. As a result, it must be dismissed outright by the Tribunal\".651\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 33.\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 35.\n\nBolivia's Post-Hearing Reply, \u00b6 84.\n\n408.\n\nFinally, the Respondent argues that \"if purchase price were of any relevance to a willing buyer (*quod non*), it is not surprising that [the] Claimant did not refer in its [post-hearing brief] to the price it allegedly paid for the [Colquiri] Mine Lease. [The] Claimant states that it paid US$ 61.7 million for the [Colquiri] Mine Lease in 2005. Yet, as of the valuation date (with 8 less years remaining in the [Colquiri] Mine Lease, after exploiting the [Colquiri] Mine for 8 years and having assigned the Rosario [v]ein to the *cooperativistas*, and after Bolivia passed in 2007 a new income (of 12.5%) for the mining industry), [the] Claimant disingenuously pretends that the [Colquiri] Mine Lease would be worth 3.5 times more than what it allegedly paid [\u2026].\"652\n\nBolivia's Post-Hearing Reply, \u00b6 89.\n\n*i.Analysis by the Tribunal*\n----------------------------\n\n409.\n\nThe Tribunal has difficulty accepting that a willing buyer would use the Claimant's valuation as the basis for valuing the Tailings Plant. *First,* from the evidence presented it is not possible to say with any degree of certainty that the project, as detailed by the Claimant, would ever have been brought to fruition. *Second*, even if we accept the Claimant's feasibility studies at face value, it is highly speculative that a willing buyer would consider a project that was \"dormant\" for at least five years. *Thirdly*, neither the Triennial Plan nor the March 2012 Investment Plan indicate an intent to approve or implement this project, and no such documentation was produced during document production. *Fourth*, the 2011 IPO makes no definitive decision regarding the realization of the project when it states that \"[t]he plan is currently being considered further by management.\"653 *Fifth*, it is difficult to acknowledge the realization of a project for which only US$1.2 million dollars were invested between 2004 and 2007 (when the Claimant argues that the value of the project is more than US$100 million). For these reasons, we reject the Claimant's valuation of the Tailings Plant.\n\nProspectus of Glencore International plc, 3 May 2011, p. 87, **R-193**.\n\n410.\n\nIn its final submission, the Claimant puts forward an alternative method for calculating the value of the plant based on the price of acquisition. However, the Tribunal agrees with the Respondent that this is a new claim that has not been fully briefed or substantiated and, for that reason, we must reject it.\n\n**3. The Tin Smelter**\n----------------------\n\n411.\n\nThe Tin Smelter is located in Vinto, Bolivia, in the Oruro Department. It started operations in 1971 and is the largest smelter in Bolivia. The tin concentrate treated by the Tin Smelter is sourced largely from Bolivian mine sources. The Tin Smelter is primarily engaged in the production of high-grade metallic tin ingots, also known as bullion; it processes concentrates produced from various mining operations in Bolivia, including the Colquiri Mine and Huanuni Mine (Bolivia's two largest tin mines).654 A particular attribute of the Tin Smelter is that \"it produces high-quality tin ingots with a purity of 99.95% tin. It enjoys the quality seal of ENAF on the London Metal Exchange (\"**LME**\"). Upon privatization, it was acquired on November 2000 by Allied Deals and subsequently, Glencore International gained full indirect ownership by March 2005.655 The Tin Smelter was reverted to the State in February 2007. According to Vinto management, Allied Deals acquired the Tin Smelter for US$14.7 million but the Respondent contests that this included tin inventory, consumables and supplies, producing essentially a negative acquisition cost.656\n\nRPA First Expert Report, \u00b6 42.\n\nSRK First Expert Report, \u00b6\u00b6 19, 96; Statement of Claim, \u00b6 36.\n\nSRK First Expert Report, \u00b6 96.\n\n412.\n\nBefore moving to our analysis, the Tribunal recalls our previous finding that the Tin Smelter Reversion Decree constituted an expropriation within the meaning of Article 5 of Treaty and that the Respondent breached this provision since the reversion was neither made for a public purpose nor against just and effective compensation.657\n\nSee Section VI.1.B.iv above.\n\n**A. Valuation Date**\n---------------------\n\n413.\n\nBoth parties agree that the proper valuation date is 8 February 2007 (the day before Bolivia issued the Tin Smelter Reversion Decree).658\n\nStatement of Claim, \u00b6 255(i); Bolivia's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6 49.\n\n**B. DCF Methodology**\n----------------------\n\n414.\n\nThe Parties also agree that the DCF methodology is an appropriate method by which to calculate Vinto's FMV. The Parties further agree that the Claimant's expert has identified the correct variables in its DCF model.659 However, the Parties disagree as to the value of each variable and the resulting FMV. The Parties' key differences concern: (i) production forecasts of tin ingots and concentrate grades, (ii) revenue forecasts and price estimates, (iii) operating and capital expenses, and (iv) the discount rate.660\n\nClaimant's Reply on Quantum, \u00b6 122; Bolivia's Statement of Defence, \u00b6 736; Econ One, \u00b6 96.\n\nClaimant's Reply on Quantum, \u00b6 122; Bolivia's Statement of Defence, \u00b6 847; Bolivia's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6 606.\n\n415.\n\nThe Claimant projects that, but for the expropriation, Vinto's Tin Smelter would have processed 30,000 tonnes of tin concentrate annually from 2008, with a tin recovered yield of 46.6 percent.661 Conversely, Bolivia projects a production rate of 11,720 tonnes of tin ingots per year,662 which it alleges is consistent with the smelter's historical tin ingot production (assuming no significant investments and that the productive units remained as they were in February 2007).663\n\nStatement of Claim, \u00b6 259.\n\nBolivia's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6 641.\n\nBolivia's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6 642.\n\n416.\n\nThe Claimant's expert calculates the FMV of Vinto to be US$56 million as of 8 February 2007 using the DCF method. Since Glencore Bermuda held 100% of the equity in Vinto and, in turn, Vinto did not have any outstanding debt, the Claimant argues that the FMV of Vinto represents the value that Glencore Bermuda lost when Bolivia seized the smelter.664\n\nClaimant's Reply on Quantum, \u00b6 121.\n\n417.\n\nOn the other hand, the Respondent contends that the Claimant's valuation is inflated. In particular, it argues that the Claimant relies on: (i) extremely high tin ingot production forecasts; (ii) unduly high and implausibly constant average concentrate grades; (iii) unduly high and implausibly constant recovery rates; (iv) unsupported high tin ingot sale price estimates and (v) implausibly low operating and capital expenditures.665\n\nBolivia's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6 606.\n\n*i. Tin Smelter Output*\n-----------------------\n\na. Tin Concentrates\n-------------------\n\n418.\n\nThe Claimant projects that, but for the expropriation, \"Vinto would have modestly increased the Tin Smelter's processing rate from 25,161 tonnes of tin concentrate in 2006 to 27,500 tonnes in 2007, and from 2008 onwards the Tin Smelter would have processed 30,000 tonnes of tin concentrate a year\".666 Furthermore, \"[s]melting these volumes of tin concentrate would have resulted in the production of 12,800 tonnes of tin metal in 2007 (from 11,720 tonnes in 2006), and 14,000 tonnes of tin metal a year thereafter, pursuant to the Claimant's expert's projections that, on average, the tin concentrates that Vinto would have acquired for processing would have had a grade of 48.75% ([*i.e.*], percentage of tin in the concentrate acquired), and the smelting process would have had a recovery rate of 95.6% ([*i.e.*], percentage of the tin in the concentrate converted into tin metal)\".667 The Respondent contends that the processing rate would not go beyond historic levels, that is, at most, 25,161 tonnes of tin concentrate.668\n\nClaimant's Reply on Quantum, \u00b6 123.\n\nClaimant's Reply on Quantum, \u00b6 123.\n\nBolivia's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 114.\n\n419.\n\nAs the Respondent puts it, \"the key value driver for the Tin Smelter's revenues is the tin ingot production rate (*i.e*., the final result of the smelting process measured in metric tonnes of fine metal in the form of ingots for sale), which should not be confused with the [s]melter's processing capacity (*i.e.*, the amount of tin concentrates fed into the furnaces along with additives for smelting, measured both in dry metric tonnes and net metric tonnes). While both the processing capacity and the production rate are considered in the analysis of the Tin Smelter's performance, only the production rate is a key variable for the Tin Smelter's DCF model (as [the] Claimant itself recognizes)\".669 In other words, to achieve the desired amount of tin metal, the Claimant would need to process at least 30,000 tonnes of concentrates. The Respondent contends that \"[s]uch a large supply of high-grade tin concentrates per year is no longer available in Bolivia\".670\n\nRespondent Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6 608; Bolivia's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 105.\n\nBolivia's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6 640.\n\n420.\n\nThe Respondent also mentions that \"Colquiri's tin concentrate production between 2007 and 2012 [\u2026] was neither large enough to provide sufficient concentrates to achieve the production rates projected by [the] Claimant for the Tin Smelter nor of sufficient purity (*i.e*., high-grade) to support [the] Claimant's projected high average grade.\"671 According to the Claimant, Vinto was and continues to be \"the only commercial scale tin smelter in Bolivia and the natural buyer for all tin concentrate produced\" therein. Therefore, as of February 2007, there was no reason for a willing buyer to believe that Vinto would experience a shortage of supply, as Bolivia argues. The Claimant also contends that as of 2007, the production of tin concentrates in Bolivia was increasing steadily and forecasted to sustain this upward trend. Furthermore, Glencore Bermuda controlled and intended to increase output at the Colquiri Mine (the second largest tin mine in Bolivia).672\n\nBolivia's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6\u00b6 648; 649. Bolivia's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 104 and 110, 122.\n\nClaimant's Reply on Quantum, \u00b6 129.\n\n421.\n\nBolivia refutes the Claimant's expert report and points to the fact that it does not consider that \"after 2011, the Tin Smelter had to begin processing larger quantities of lower-grade concentrates because of the lack of high-grade concentrates in the country \u2013 and this only to maintain production (until 2015, when production increased due to the commissioning of the Ausmelt furnace)\".673 According to the Respondent, the Claimant could have only provided 19% of the concentrates needed to reach its projected production of 14,000 tonnes of tin ingots, since in 2007 (its year of largest production) Colquiri produced only 5,278 DMT of concentrates and in 2012 (its year of lowest production) it produced 2,352 DMT, which are respectively 5.6 and 12.7 times less than the Claimant's estimated 30,000 DMT of concentrates needed.674\n\n\"The processing of lower-grade concentrates explains the lower recovery rates in 2010-2017.\" Bolivia's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6 666.\n\nBolivia's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6 650.\n\n422.\n\nMoreover, Bolivia contests that even though the Claimant's expert maintains that Colquiri's tin concentrates are \"*higher grade tin concentrates*,\" \"the average grade of the concentrates produced at Colquiri between 2007 and 2012 (when the [Colquiri] Mine was still being operated by [the] Claimant) was 48.2%, *i.e.*, below [the] Claimant's estimated average grade of 48.75%.\" Therefore, \"even if all tin concentrates produced by Colquiri had been sold to the Tin Smelter, they could not [] have elevated the average grade of the concentrates processed to 48.75%\" and \"there would not have been enough high grade concentrates to achieve [the] Claimant's expected production rate.\"675\n\nBolivia's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6 651.\n\nb. Tin Ingot Production\n-----------------------\n\n423.\n\nThe tin ingot production rate is \"the final result of the smelting process measured in metric tonnes of fine metal in the form of ingots for sale\" and is different from the smelter's processing capacity. It is \"the amount of tin concentrates fed into the furnaces along with additives for smelting, measured both in dry metric tonnes and net metric tonnes\".676\n\nBolivia's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6 608.\n\n424.\n\nRegarding the Tin Smelter's capacity, the Claimant notes that the three smelting furnaces that Vinto was operating as of February 2007 each had the capacity to process 40 to 50 tonnes of tin concentrates a day or approximately 10,200 to 12,750 tonnes of tin concentrate a year. On that basis, the Claimant argues that the Tin Smelter's three furnaces would have had an aggregate processing capacity of 30,600 to 38,250 tonnes of tin concentrate a year (28% more than what the Claimant's expert projected).677\n\nClaimant's Reply on Quantum, \u00b6 126.\n\n425.\n\nThe Respondent's expert argues that documents relied on by the Claimant's experts, Compass Lexecon and RPA, do not support its projections. In particular, the CRU Monitor report indicates that from 2003 to 2006, Vinto was producing less than 12,000 MT of tin ingots (15% less than the 14,000 MT estimate Compass Lexecon uses for its DCF model). In its view, this report implies that normal tin concentrate processing levels were closer to 25,000 MT, as opposed to the 30,000 MT anticipated by Compass Lexecon.678\n\nFlores First Expert Report, \u00b6 105. See also Bolivia's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 112-117 and Bolivia's Post-Hearing Reply, \u00b6 114.\n\n426.\n\nThe Respondent alleges that during the Claimant's operation of the Tin Smelter, the available furnaces were working at maximum capacity. It points out that the 2006 and January 2007 *Balances Metal\u00fargicos* show that \"although [the] Claimant purchased large quantities of high-grade concentrates, production remained steady (around 11,400 tonnes of ingots per year). In fact, the (poor) condition of the furnaces was such that [the] Claimant was not able to even process all the purchased concentrates and excess material consistently remained in the pipeline (referred to as \"*circuito*\").\" In this regard, it mentions that \"in May 2006, Sinchi Wayra processed 3,159 DMT of concentrates of a very high grade (50.53%, which means that the tin processed corresponds to 1,596 tonnes of fine metal). Yet, the Tin Smelter only produced 1,157 tonnes of tin ingots that month, despite a reported recovery rate of 95%, thus, leaving 366 tonnes of fine metal in the pipeline.\"679 Furthermore, the Respondent's expert contests Compass Lexecon's analysis of *ex post* data indicating that for the 19 years from 1998 through 2016, including those during which Vinto purchased more than 30,000 MT, actual tin ingot production was below Compass Lexecon's forecast.680\n\nBolivia's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6 620.\n\nFlores Second Expert Report, \u00b6 101.\n\nc. Investment in the Tin Smelter\n--------------------------------\n\n427.\n\nThe Claimant alleges that from 2002 to 2006, several projects and works were executed at the Vinto Metallurgical Complex to optimize the process.681 Bolivia contests that those optimization processes served to mitigate production losses and to improve safety and environmental conditions, which are different from increasing production.

Respondent replies that \"Claimant has only submitted a single document entitled \"*Proyectos y trabajos ejecutados en Complejo Metalurgico de Vinto periodo 2002-2006*\" describing the processes undertaken between 2002 and 2006 with no indication of when these processes were exactly implemented in the 4-year period.\" See also Bolivia's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6 634.\n\n428.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, contemporaneous evidence demonstrates that 10 out of the 16 Tin Smelter's original furnaces had been decommissioned or dismantled as of the reversion date and that, of the 6 remaining furnaces, only 3 were \"actual ingot producing units\".

Villavicencio).\n\nBolivia's Post-Hearing Reply, \u00b6 115, referring to Glencore, undated, *Proyectos y Trabajos Ejecutados en Complejo Metalurgico de Vinto Periodo 2002-2006*, **RPA-53**; Transcript, Hearing on Quantum, Day 4, p. 518, lines 15-19 (Mr. Lambert).\n\n429.\n\nIn support of its projections, the Claimant alleges that even after Bolivia's nationalization of Vinto, \"the Tin Smelter's operations have demonstrated that there would have been sufficient tin concentrates available to Vinto to meet RPA's projections\". Specifically, it points out that \"since 2015, Vinto has consistently processed over 29,000 tonnes of tin concentrates a year, including more than 30,000 tonnes of tin concentrates in 2016\".686 In the Claimant's view, there is no reason to claim that RPA's capacity estimates are not achievable since Bolivia's own data shows that from 2012 through 2014, EMV reached processing levels similar to those forecasted by Glencore Bermuda.687 To this particular argument, the Respondent replies that the Claimant is mistaken for the following reasons:\n\na. *First,* the Claimant does not refer to the Tin Smelter's tin ingot production rates after the reversion, it focuses on the quantity of concentrates processed, ignoring their average grade and the ensuing production. \"While the Tin Smelter did process over 28,000 DMT of concentrate per year between 2012 and 2014, this increased feed did not generate an equivalent increase in the amount of produced ingots. During these three years, the Tin Smelter produced an average of 11,521 tonnes of ingots (that is, a production rate comparable to [the] Claimant's 2005-2006 production).\"688\n\nb. *Second,* while the new Ausmelt furnace (an investment of US$39 million) was under construction, Bolivia invested approximately US$1 million in 2011 to repurpose the furnaces of the Antimony Smelter to process tin concentrates in order to increase the quantities of low-grade tin concentrates that could be processed by EMV. \"Even with this investment to expand existing infrastructure, the Tin Smelter was only able to maintain its production levels [\u2026], the operation without the Ausmelt was not sustainable in the long run, as the costs of processing low grade concentrates were too high.\"689\n\nc. *Third,* \"[a]t the time of the reversion, the production units remained in sufferable condition due to [the] Claimant's lack of investment and had to undergo intensive overhauls post-reversion to process larger quantities of (low-grade) concentrates. By 2012, Bolivia had already completed the necessary overhauls, and the operating conditions were very different from the ones prevailing during [the] Claimant's operation.\"690\n\nClaimant's Reply on Quantum, \u00b6 130.\n\n\"[P]rocessing on average 29,500 tonnes of concentrate per year during this period without expanding the existing infrastructure and using the same smelting furnaces that were operational as of February 2007\". Claimant's Reply on Quantum, \u00b6 126.\n\nBolivia's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6 621. In relation to the increased feed, Bolivia explains that to \"compensate for the lower grade of concentrates since 2008\", \"the Tin Smelter had to increase the quantity of processed concentrate only to maintain production levels.\"\n\nBolivia's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6 621. See also of Villavicencio Third Witness Statement, \u00b6 59.\n\nBolivia's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6 621.\n\nd. Analysis by the Tribunal\n---------------------------\n\n430.\n\nThe Tribunal is not convinced that the evidence presented by the Claimant supports the increase in production of tin ingots from 11,400 to 14,000 tonnes per year.691 As mentioned before, to reach such levels, there would need to be not only enough concentrates but the concentrates need to be of adequate grade. In addition, the Tin Smelter must be able to increase its historical output of tin ingots.\n\nRPA I, Table 10; Compass Lexecon Second Expert Report, \u00b6 62.\n\n431.\n\nThe Tribunal cannot find sufficient evidence in the record to support an increase in concentrates levels. Moreover, even if we were to accept the Claimant's contention that there would be a significant increase in tin concentrates, we would have to agree that such concentrates (whether from Bolivian mines or imported) would be of sufficient quality throughout the Tin Smelter's production life (*i.e*., until 2026) in order to reach the quantity of tin ingots proposed by the Claimant. This seems highly speculative to us.\n\n432.\n\nFinally, even if the Tribunal were to find that there were sufficient concentrates with the appropriate grade to feed into the Tin Smelter, we are not convinced that the Tin Smelter's output would reach the amount of tin ingots anticipated by the Claimant. Since 2000, and particularly during the Claimant's operation of the Tin Smelter, the projected level of tin ingots has not been met, despite the fact that the Tin Smelter has been in operation for more than 30 years.692 While the Claimant has advanced arguments on so called \"optimization processes\", the evidence provided to the Tribunal does not demonstrate an impact to increase production capacity; rather, it shows that the Tin Smelter has undergone regular maintenance and preservation works. It is also unclear whether such projects would merely mitigate production losses, as claimed by the Respondent, or whether an actual production increase would be realized.693\n\nSee Bolivia's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6\u00b6 613 and 615; Bolivia's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 110 and 111.\n\nWhen discussing this issue at the Hearing on Quantum, it was clear that there was no straight link between these projects and an increase in production: \"Q. [a]re you saying that these projects 2002 or 2000 to 2006 would collectively lead to increases in production? \"Yes\" or \"no.\" A. I don't believe that's what we said. [\u2026] A. The key part here is the more efficient use of the existing capacity, so what we're trying to do is get the production, maintain the production at the existing capacity. [\u2026] Q. Okay. So, your testimony, therefore, is these projects, in and of themselves, would not lead to more production. You need to have more feed coming in the Plant in order to have more production; correct? A. And I clarify that because it's not just more feed. It's more feed at the right grade. Q. Exactly. Exactly. You need to have appropriate grade, and I'm not going to qualify that so that we don't enter into a debate. Good. A. Yes. Q. Now, assuming there was enough feed of appropriate grade by 2006, and that these projects were in place by 2006, would you agree with me that we would see those effects in 2006? A. I believe so, yes.\" (Transcript, Hearing on Quantum, Day 4, p. 515, line 25, p. 516, lines 1-4, 14-17 and p. 518, lines 5-19) (Mr. Lambert).\n\n433.\n\nThus, we find that the evidence presented falls short of demonstrating that the Tin Smelter could achieve the Claimant's proposed increase in production. Additionally, it is not apparent either whether capital was invested on improving the performance of the smelter in 2005-2006 or whether there were projected investments in 2007 for that purpose.694 For all these reasons, we find that the Tin Smelter would be unable to increase its tin ingot production levels above historical production levels.695\n\n\"Q. But all of these projects are just maintenance investments or operating expenses; correct? That's your testimony? A. Yes.\" Transcript, Hearing on Quantum, Day 3, p. 417, lines 19-22 (Eng. Villavicencio).\n\nWith respect to grade concentrates, Claimant assumes that the average grade of the tin concentrates would remain constant at a high-grade of 48.75%. Respondent also assumes the same figure for valuation purposes. With respect to metallurgical recovery rates, \"the recovery rate is dependent on the grade of the processed concentrates. The higher the quality/purity of the concentrate, the better the recovery rate, and vice versa\". Bolivia's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6\u00b6 660, 662 and 663; Villavicencio I, \u00b6 70. Claimant proposes that the metallurgical recovery rates at the Tin Smelter will remain constant at 95.6%. RPA Second Expert Report, \u00b6 209. Bolivia's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 106.\n\n*ii. Price Premium*\n-------------------\n\n434.\n\nThe Claimant includes in its valuation a *premium*. Vinto charged a premium over the tin ingot price, which is often \"a fixed dollar amount added to the final LME price or a percentage premium over the tin ingots price.\"696 The latest ingot sale contracts signed by Vinto prior to the expropriation were undertaken on 13 September 2005 and 20 February 2006. These contracts included premiums of US$280 per tonne and 3% of the ingot price. Additionally, the Claimant argues that CRU shows that large scale suppliers (such as Vinto) reached price premiums over US$400 per tonne for shipments to the U.S., to which many of the Tin Smelter's tin ingots were shipped in early 2007. Thus, the Claimant projects a 3% premium.697\n\nCompass Lexecon First Expert Report, \u00b6 84. As indicated by Claimant's expert, this premium usually increases when prices rise and there are also geographic variations between the premiums that are added to the final price. \"*This premium applies on top of the average LME tin ingot price over the quotation period, which is often a period of approximately one week near the date of sale, although this period can vary depending on the contract.*\" See also Compass Lexecon I, fn, 96.\n\nCompass Lexecon First Expert Report, \u00b6 84.\n\n435.\n\nOn the other hand, Bolivia's expert adopts Compass Lexecon's use of analyst projections as the baseline for ingot sale prices and agrees that a premium must be added. However, it advocates for the use of a premium of 1.68%, rather than the 3% premium proposed by the Claimant taking into account 18 contracts for ingot with quality of 99.9% tin instead of one contract.698 In contrast, in the Claimant's view, this premium should not be applied since it is based \"on the average premiums of 18 short-term sales contracts signed by Vinto dating from 2002 through 2005\" (and are thus not representative of sale price premiums for tin ingots in 2007), whereas its proposed premium is based on the last sales contract signed by Vinto prior to the 2007 nationalization.699\n\nFlores First Expert Report, \u00b6\u00b6 117-119. Bolivia's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 124-125.\n\nClaimant's Reply on Quantum, \u00b6\u00b6 139 and 140.\n\n436.\n\nThe Respondent further replies that, according to the dynamics of tin market prices and premiums \u2013 \"*[a]s tin prices increase or decrease, so do the premiums*\"700 \u2013 the historically observed contract premiums were positively correlated with tin prices, and that Compass Lexecon recognized that tin prices were expected to fall. Therefore, it argues that it is reasonable to expect a premium lower than the 3%.701\n\nBolivia's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6 677.\n\nFlores Second Expert Report, \u00b6\u00b6 114-116. Bolivia's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6 678.\n\na. Analysis by the Tribunal\n---------------------------\n\n437.\n\nWhile the Tribunal recognizes the Claimant's argument as to the proximity of the dates in the contracts, it is not persuaded that one contract of 2007 can be used as a proxy for the premium. Of the contracts presented by the Respondent, some do not contemplate a premium and, as to the others, there is a range that varies between 1% to 3%. In consequence, the Tribunal is inclined towards the Respondent's proposed premium which reflects an average premium.\n\n*iii. OPEX*\n-----------\n\n438.\n\nTo produce at its forecasted levels, the Claimant projects that, beginning in 2008, Vinto would have incurred OPEX of US$316 per tonne of concentrate processed. This projection is based on Vinto's actual operating costs for 2006 (US$368.79 per tonne of concentrate processed). The Claimant indicates that, to be conservative, Compass Lexecon elected to use the 2006 OPEX rather than the average OPEX for 2005 and 2006. Therefore, \"[t]o calculate OPEX of US$316 per tonne of concentrate processed, Compass Lexecon adjusts Vinto's 2006 OPEX amount to account for the economies of scale that Vinto would have gained as production increased between 2006 and 2008\".702 The Claimant thus calculates OPEX to be US$368.8 per tonne of concentrate processed, which would decrease to US$315.3 per tonne of concentrate starting in 2008 due to economies of scale, adjusted yearly for inflation.703\n\nClaimant's Reply on Quantum, \u00b6 137; Compass Lexecon Second Expert Report, \u00b6 66.\n\nAccording to Claimant's expert, \"operating costs are based on 2006 actuals with adjustments made for economies of scale. These were applied to the fixed costs. The operating costs at the Tin Smelter consist of the following categories: concentrate purchases, smelting, quality control, maintenance, and indirect costs. The production costs, or total smelter site costs, consist of smelting, quality control, maintenance, and indirect costs.\" Claimant's expert also indicates that \"[a]pproximately 90% of the production costs are fixed and would benefit from economies of scale\". RPA Second Expert Report, \u00b6 225.\n\n439.\n\nThe Respondent also calculates the operating costs per MT of concentrate processed, based on the data provided in the 2006 management report, adjusted for inflation.704 However, it takes issue with the fact that, as a result of the Tin Smelter's increased production, it would automatically \"benefit from economies of scale and thus would have lower operating costs per tonne in 2007-2013 than in 2006\".705 Expanding on this, the Respondent's expert shows, on the basis of the 2006 operating data submitted by RPA, that OPEX actually increased due to the surge in the quantities of concentrates processed.706 Bolivia points out that, even if the Claimant's assumption was correct, it ignores other factors that would increase OPEX costs, such as the lower average concentrate grade that increases the cost per unit of recovered tin, the environmental costs, and impurity levels.707\n\nFlores Second Expert Report, \u00b6 104.\n\nBolivia's Statement of Defence, \u00b6 874; Bolivia's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 128-133.\n\nBolivia's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6 694.\n\nBolivia's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6 696.\n\na. Analysis by the Tribunal\n---------------------------\n\n440.\n\nThe OPEX calculations made by both Parties are based on 2006 data. On the argument whether the calculation should be adjusted for economies of scale, we note that it is closely related to the Claimant's expected increase in production. As mentioned above, the Tribunal found that the Claimant's evidence does not support its case for an increase to 14,000 tonnes and historical data also does not indicate that the smelter's production has reached levels near those projected. We do not see how economies of scale would apply under the circumstances. Accordingly, the Tribunal agrees with the Respondent that the calculation of operating costs per MT of concentrate processed should be based on the data provided in the 2006 management report, adjusted for inflation.\n\n*iv. G&A Expenses*\n------------------\n\n441.\n\nThe Parties' experts have agreed that the Tin Smelter's general and administrative costs will amount to US$481,500 per year, adjusted yearly for inflation.708\n\nBolivia's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 137; Letter to the Tribunal, 18 November 2021, p. 6.\n\n*v. Remediation and Closure Costs*\n----------------------------------\n\n442.\n\nThe Respondent estimates that remediation and closure costs at Vinto would be at least US$23.2 million as of 2026.709 According to the Respondent, the Claimant has failed to account for remediation and closure costs for the Tin Smelter, even though it does so for its valuation of the Colquiri Mine Lease. It argues that the Claimant recognized in its due diligence, prior to the acquisition of the asset, a \"significant soil pollution\"710 and such factor should be taken into account in the valuation.711 Furthermore, it indicates that Vinto's 2007 audited financial statements mention \"that the 'provision for restoration and closure costs [\u2026] is composed of all the costs estimated that will be incurred for environmental remediation'.\"712 Based on those statements, the Claimant estimated the remediation and closure costs at US$5.5 million.713 Bolivia's expert, SRK, considered this amount to be \"insufficient to cover all costs associated with demolition, removal and disposal of all plant and equipment, removal and disposal of substantial quantities of slag and the remediation of soil pollution over a substantial area.\"714\n\nBolivia's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 135. \"SRK has estimated that remediation costs for Vinto would exceed US$20 million\". See Bolivia's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6 709.\n\nGlencore interoffice report from Mr. Vix to Mr. Eskdale, 21 November 2004, p. 6, **C-310**.\n\nBolivia's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 134-136; Bolivia's Post-Hearing Reply, \u00b6 118.\n\nFlores Second Expert Report, \u00b6 121; Vinto Financial Statements, 2007, pp. 6, 11 (notes 2.3 and 2.8) and 16 of the pdf, **CLEX-16**.\n\n\"Claimant instructed its experts shortly before the Hearing [on Quantum] to include US$ 5.5 million as of 2007 in remediation and closure costs based on Vinto's 2007 Financial Statements, without regard to the actual condition of the smelter that Claimant's experts did not visit [\u2026]\".

Analysis by the Tribunal\n---------------------------\n\n443.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that the estimate proposed by the Respondent lacks an evidentiary basis. At the Hearing on Quantum, the Respondent's number seemed to be based on the opinion of the Respondent's expert rather than on any specific foundation:\n\nAnd remediating smelters is not a cheap matter. We've got it under Antimony, but we researched, we looked at case histories. I discussed it with colleagues, and look, *there is nothing definitive*, there is no contract that says we will pay a contractor $10 per-square meter to basically undertake the remediation of this land. This was just a number that *I felt was reasonable* given what's happening elsewhere with smelter closure and remediation. [\u2026] And *I felt* the 5.5 million, given what's going on elsewhere with smelters was pitifully light. [\u2026] Q. You keep referencing elsewhere, what's going on elsewhere. Where are you referring to? A. No, I have been involved, and we've researched it, I have actually been involved with smelters in different parts of the world being closed, and we've researches costs, estimates, I think we used--gave a couple of examples in either Canada or the U.S. These are difficult sites to remediate, and they are expensive sites to remediate, but I felt it was important to give an opinion on what a potential closure, restoration, rehabilitation, restoration cost might be, but I was shocked to find that the impact on the value or valuation in 2007 was so small [\u2026].715\n\n(emphasis added)\n\nTranscript, Hearing on Quantum, Day 4, p. 640, lines 5-12, p. 641, lines 9-11, and p. 642, lines 1-2 (Dr. Rigby).\n\n444.\n\nAs a consequence, the Tribunal considers it appropriate to apply the estimated cost based on Vinto's audited financial statements for 2007.\n\n*vi. Working Capital*\n---------------------\n\n445.\n\nThe Parties' experts agreed on 113 days of revenues for accounts receivables and inventories, 39 days of costs for accounts payable and 28 days of concentrate purchases plus smelter site costs for VAT.716 The Tribunal will apply those figures to the valuation.\n\nBolivia's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 138.\n\n*vii. Other Arguments*\n----------------------\n\n446.\n\nThe Claimant has presented additional arguments regarding the reasonability of its valuation based on the price it paid for the Tin Smelter in 2005,717 the increase in metal prices718 and the profitability of the Tin Smelter during the Claimant's operation.719 The relevance of these arguments have been contested by the Respondent.720 However, since the Parties agreed on the DCF method of valuation for this asset, the Tribunal's focus will only be on addressing the arguments and data pertinent for this method of valuation.\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n\"Glencore Bermuda paid US$51.6 million for the Tin Smelter in March 2005. This figure is closely aligned with the Compass Lexecon experts' proposed valuation of US$53.3 million as of February 2007.\" Claimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 37 a).\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 37 b). \"[\u2026] tin prices increased from US$9,190 per tonne on 1 October 2004 to US$12,270 per tonne on 8 February 2007\". See also Claimant's Post-Hearing Brief, fn. 56.\n\n\"Vinto generated profits of approximately US$18 million.\" [\u2026] \"Bolivia was unable to provide any credible reasons that would justify reducing Vinto's value between 2005 and 2007, much less reducing it to US$17.2 million\" [\u2026] \"it is not credible that in February 2007, a willing seller would have sold Vinto for only US$17.2 million as Bolivia asserts\". Claimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 37 b), c) and d).\n\n\"Claimant bears the burden of proving the price it paid (and has all the information to do so). Yet, Claimant has withheld such evidence\"; \"[\u2026] no diligent and informed willing buyer would take the 2005 purchase price at face value to determine its offer price in 2007 (that is, 2 years later, during which Vinto was operated with the same equipment and without any capital investment, exhausting the equipment to the point it could not even process all the acquired concentrates, and under very different economic and political conditions)\"; \"[t]he fluctuation of tin prices is a *non sequitur* for valuing a smelter, because tin is both an output and an input to the smelting business (unlike for a tin mine)\"; \"[\u2026] it is undisputed that the FMV using a DCF model is based on future cash-flow projections and not on the accounting principles that guide an isolated past financial statement.\" Bolivia's Post-Hearing Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 100-113.\n\ni.

Discount Rates**\n---------------------\n\n471.\n\nThe Parties agree that the DCF methodology is the appropriate method to calculate Colquiri's FMV (except with regard to the future profits of the Tailings Plant). The Parties also agree that Compass Lexecon identified the correct variables in its DCF model.747 While the Claimant proposes discount rates of 12.3% and 15.7% for Colquiri and Vinto, the Respondent proposes 22.1% and 28.5% respectively. The main differences are discussed in the following sections.\n\nClaimant's Reply on Quantum, \u00b6 50; Bolivia's Statement of Defence, \u00b6 736.\n\n*i. Risk Free Rate*\n-------------------\n\n472.\n\nBoth experts agreed to use the rates proposed by the Respondent which are based on a 10-year U.S. governmental bond. The only area of difference is that the Claimant uses a one-year average and the Respondent the spot rate. According to Bolivia, the \"Claimant's experts' opportunistic decision to use Dr. Flores' rates, absent agreement on other variables, actually increases its valuation for Colquiri, driving the valuations of the experts further apart (as Dr. Flores' risk free rate was lower than Compass Lexecon's). [...] [The] Claimant's proposal for the risk-free rates is thus disingenuous as it creates no more than a veneer of cooperation, when in fact [the] Claimant is simply cherry picking the rate that maximizes its claims\".748 The Claimant replies that \"Bolivia fails to mention that the experts' compromise reduces Vinto's valuation. Further, the Compass Lexecon experts' compromise achieves the desired goal of reducing the number of differences between the parties' valuations\".749\n\nBolivia's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 150.\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Reply, \u00b6 51.\n\n473.\n\nSince the rate proposed by the Respondent is more aligned with the valuation date, we find this rate to be more appropriate for our valuation.\n\n*ii. Country Risk Premium (CRP)*\n--------------------------------\n\n474.\n\nThe Claimant's expert indicates that \"[t]he purpose of the country-risk premium is to account for the incremental political, regulatory, and macroeconomic risks that the assets might be exposed to due to its location being in Bolivia as opposed to a more developed and more stable jurisdiction like the US\".750 The Parties agree on the \"first step\" (country default spread) to determine the applicable CRP. The Claimant's expert calculates general exposure to Bolivia's country risk using the method of applying Bolivia's sovereign default risk.751 Using the EMBI proxy methodology, the Claimant obtains a country risk premium of 5.21% as of the February 2007 valuation date for Vinto and 3.7% as of the May 2012 valuation date for Colquiri.752\n\nCompass Lexecon Second Expert Report, \u00b6 85.\n\nClaimant's Reply on Quantum, \u00b6 144. \"The sovereign debt approach is calculated as the difference between the yield of the U.S. government bond and the yield of the government bond (denominated in U.S. dollars) of the target country (Bolivia in this case). The sovereign debt for developing countries such as Bolivia is usually measured through emerging market bond indices, such as the Emerging Market Bond Index (\"**EMBI**\") [\u2026] [t]hose indices are not available for Bolivia, so Compass Lexecon calculates the country risk premium in Bolivia with: an EMBI proxy [\u2026].\" Flores First Expert Report, \u00b6 164.\n\nFlores First Expert Report, \u00b6 165.\n\n475.\n\nIn its first report, Bolivia's expert indicated that \"the calculation of the country default spread is only *the first step in the calculation of the country risk premium*, since it only measures the risk of default on sovereign debt. The second step is to apply an *adjustment* to take into account the additional risks inherent in the equity market of a particular country that are not captured in the yield spread\" (emphasis added).753 Bolivia initially referred to that second step as an \"equity risk premium\"754 although in subsequent submissions it referred to it as a \"corrective application\" and a \"corrective factor.\"755 Its adjustment entails averaging two approaches: (i) applying a 1.5 multiplier to Bolivia's sovereign debt spread and (ii) the Ibbotson/Morningstar's Country Risk Rating Model. By doing so, it obtains premiums of 13.13% and 10.52% for the valuation dates of February 2007 and June 2012, for Vinto and Colquiri respectively.756\n\nFlores First Expert Report, \u00b6 167.\n\nBolivia's Statement of Defence, \u00b6 880.\n\nBolivia's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6 831; Bolivia's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 153.\n\nFlores First Expert Report, \u00b6\u00b6 167-169. See also Flores Second Expert Report, Figures 19 and 20.\n\na. 1.5 Multiplier\n-----------------\n\n476.\n\nWith respect to the 1.5 volatility multiplier, the Claimant alleges that this multiplier is only appropriate for valuations of short-term investments (*i.e.,* for investments in stock that an investor expects to hold only for a few days, weeks or months), which is not the case for the valuation of Colquiri and Vinto.757 The Claimant also points out that the Respondent's position was rejected by the tribunal in *Rurelec v. Bolivia*, which applied the same Treaty.758 On the other hand, the Respondent replies that Prof. Damodaran never rejected the application of a multiplier for long-term investments. To the contrary, he uses the 1.5 multiplier when computing discount rates for long-term equity investments and in the spreadsheet that Compass Lexecon cited, the 1.5 multiplier was applied to the CRP estimate for Bolivia, and all other developing countries.759 Moreover, the Respondent alleges that the use of the 1.5 multiplier is justified and is a necessary correction to the Claimant's estimate, so that the sovereign default spread can be adjusted to capture the risk of an equity investment in Bolivia, and thus be used for calculating a discount rate on equity investments.760\n\nClaimant's Reply on Quantum, \u00b6 145. See also Claimant's Post-Hearing Reply, \u00b6 56.\n\nClaimant's Reply on Quantum, \u00b6 145.\n\nBolivia's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6 834.\n\nBolivia's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6 835.\n\n477.\n\nFinally, in its Post-Hearing Brief, the Respondent indicated that the \"1.5 multiplier is *not* a size/illiquidity premium or an additional premium: it is a correcting factor applied to Compass Lexecon's proxy EMBI to adjust a measure of sovereign debt risk to a measure applicable to equity risks such as those facing Glencore's business operations in Bolivia.\"761\n\nBolivia's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 153.\n\nb. Ibbotson/Morningstar's Country Risk Rating Model\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n478.\n\nWith respect to the country-risk premium based on the Ibbotson/Morningstar Country-Risk Model, the Claimant also contends that this model is not reliable and results in an \"overestimation\" of the country-risk premium. According to the Claimant's expert, the model is not transparent in its sources and applies data from developed countries to emerging markets. Furthermore, \"the fact that Bolivia may default on its debt does not mean that a company located in Bolivia will necessarily default on its debt\u2014particularly when most of that company's revenues are dependent on exports and US dollars, like Colquiri's and Vinto's were\". The Claimant's expert also indicates that if it had accounted in its but-for scenario for Colquiri's and Vinto's international customer base, the country-risk rate would have been lower than the general exposure measured by the sovereign debt approach, and since it did not account for this, \"[its] country-risk premium is conservative.\"762\n\nClaimant's Reply on Quantum, \u00b6 146.\n\n479.\n\nConversely, the Respondent contends that the Ibbotson/Morningstar Country Risk Model is a \"widely-employed and thorough study based on country credit risk rating, which presents notable advantages compared to other models, including that it (i) covers many countries, (ii) consistently produces reasonable results, and (iii) produces stable results over time\". The Respondent's expert considers the allegations as to \"lack of transparency of this model or a bias toward specific world regions as unfounded\".763\n\nBolivia's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6 836.\n\n480.\n\nFinally, in response to the allegation that the Respondent's expert took the average of two \"unconnected methodologies that yield highly dissonant estimates,\" the Respondent explains that the methodologies it employed are widely-recognized for generating reasonable and stable results, and that it is common practice to employ multiple methodologies to gauge a general consensus, especially when performing valuations where the hypothetical willing buyer and its preferred method of estimating country risk are unknown. It also points out that Compass Lexecon has done the same when forecasting commodity prices.764\n\nBolivia's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6 830; Bolivia's Post Hearing Brief, \u00b6 154.\n\nc. Illiquidity\n--------------\n\n481.\n\nBolivia's expert adds an \"illiquidity/size premium\" of 3.95% and 3.89% for Vinto and Colquiri respectively.765 According to the Respondent, when calculating the Weighted Average Cost of Capital (\"**WACC**\") (based on the *Capital Asset Pricing Model* \u2013 CAPM) of smaller firms, as in the present case, an illiquidity/size premium must be applied to better reflect their cost of capital. The Respondent's expert explains that most of the inputs used to calculate CAPM refer to large companies (much larger than Colquiri) and since an investment in a smaller firm is more volatile than an investment in a larger firm, calculating the CAPM without considering the size of the company would underestimate its true cost of capital. Furthermore, it argues that the CAPM measures the cost of capital for large publicly-traded companies which are considered to be very liquid assets, which is not the case of Colquiri (an illiquid physical asset).766 The Claimant's expert has not considered an illiquidity/size premium in its calculations.\n\nFlores Second Expert Report, \u00b6 146.\n\nBolivia's Statement of Defence, \u00b6 841.\n\n482.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, there is no justification for an illiquidity or size premium. It argues that the use of such a premium is not \"standard practice in international finance\", because it is incorrect to apply the US-based size premium proposed by the Respondent's expert to companies in an emerging market like Bolivia. It also points out that the tribunal in *Rurelec* rejected the same arguments brought by Bolivia's same expert. The Claimant also alleges that it is duplicative to assert that Colquiri and Vinto bear additional risk because they are small relative to the US market (through the size premium), and that they bear additional risk because they are located in Bolivia and not in the US (through the country-risk premium). In its view, even if this \"size premium\" were to apply in emerging markets, Colquiri and Vinto are classified as large companies in Bolivia, thus, there is no reason to reduce their value to account for their size.767\n\nClaimant's Reply on Quantum, \u00b6 150.\n\n483.\n\nThe Respondent replies that it is wrong to conflate the CRP and the additional illiquidity/size premium and to assume an overlap between them since they perform entirely different functions. It explains that the CRP does not account for a company's individual characteristics, which is what the additional risk premium does.768 The Respondent also contends that, despite often labelled a \"size premium\", the rationale behind it \"*is broader than this label suggests*,\" as it also makes up for other \"*[c]onsiderations such as measurement limitations with the CAPM, illiquidity, diversification, and indirect costs*,\" which the CAPM fails to properly account for.769 As to *Rurelec*, the Respondent argues that in that case the tribunal also found that \"there [were] compelling reasons to add an additional risk premium of 4.5% to EGSA's required cost of equity, which, while similar in its effects to [Dr. Flores'] 'size premium', might be more appropriately called an 'illiquidity premium', or better yet an 'additional risk premium', as it also encompasses some aspects that the Tribunal considers relevant among those discussed by the Parties when addressing the multiplier issue.\"770 In that case, the Tribunal's task was to estimate the FMV of the largest private energy generation company in Bolivia.771\n\n\"The inclusion of the CRP simply does not account for the company-specific characteristics of Vinto and Colquiri that make them different from the large publicly-traded companies targeted by the CAPM.\" Bolivia's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6 855.\n\nBolivia's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6 851.\n\n*Guaracachi America, Inc and Rurelec Plc v.

This is akin to another very common adjustment made to discount rates in practice, which is the small stock premium. The costs of equity for smaller companies are often augmented by 3-3.5% reflecting the excess returns earned by smaller cap companies over very long periods. [\u2026] Practitioners attribute all or a significant portion of the small stock premium reported by Ibbotson Associates to illiquidity and add it on as an illiquidity premium\". Bolivia's Rejoinder, \u00b6 853, referring to *Guaracachi America, Inc and Rurelec Plc v. Plurinational State of Bolivia,* UNCITRAL, Award, 31 January 2014, \u00b6\u00b6 599-600, **CLA-120**; Aswath Damodaran, \"Comatose Markets: What If Liquidity Is Not The Norm?\", Stern School of Business, December 2010, p. 55, **R-526**.\n\n484.\n\nThe Claimant has also argued that the application of an illiquidity premium is contrary to the calculation of the investments' FMVs. According to the Respondent's expert, Colquiri's and Vinto's cash flows should be discounted more heavily using an \"illiquidity premium\" since it would be difficult to find potential buyers for Colquiri and Vinto, given that these companies are not publicly-traded. It also claims that Glencore Bermuda would have been compelled to divest these assets and to accept higher exit transaction costs. The Claimant's expert takes issue with this, indicating that the use of an \"illiquidity premium\" runs contrary to the FMV principle because under this principle the value should be measured pursuant to the standard of a willing buyer and a willing seller *with no compulsion to sell*.772\n\nClaimant's Reply on Quantum, \u00b6 151. See also Claimant's Post-Hearing Reply, \u00b6 68.\n\n485.\n\nConversely, the Respondent contends that the Claimant's position conflates the impact of illiquidity on value with that of a distressed sale. It explains that \"[t]he illiquidity premium does not measure the value lost in a rushed sale, but the additional risks inherent with the sale of a privately-held Bolivian smelter or mine compared to the sale of a hypothetical identical publicly-traded Bolivian smelter or mine. Thus, applying an illiquidity premium to Vinto and Colquiri would not assume a distressed sale of the Assets, but would only capture the illiquidity risks inherent in these two physical and non-publicly traded Assets, which the CAPM fails to account for\".773\n\nBolivia's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6 858; Bolivia's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 156.\n\n486.\n\nFinally, according to the Claimant, the Respondent's assumption that it would be difficult to find potential buyers for Colquiri and Vinto is also disproven by the evidence on the record, given that in five years\u2014from 2000 to 2005\u2014the Colquiri Lease and Tin Smelter changed hands two and three times respectively.774 In reply, the Respondent alleges that these transactions \"were far from the FMV benchmark of 'an arm's length transaction between a willing and informed buyer and a willing seller with no compulsion to sell'.\"775\n\nClaimant's Reply on Quantum, \u00b6 151.\n\nBolivia's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6 859. See also: \"[t]he first of the three transactions that Claimant counts for Vinto was its privatization and sale to Allied Deals in 1999-2000. [\u2026] Allied Deals only paid US$ 14 million and ended up also receiving items not calculated in Vinto's purchase price, which, on their own, were worth more than US$ 16 million \u2013 meaning that Allied Deals ended up being paid to acquire Vinto.\" \"The second transaction counted by Claimant for Vinto is its 2002 sale from Allied Deals to S\u00e1nchez de Lozada's COMSUR for US$ 6 million. However, in Mr. Eskdale's own words at the Hearing, the sale of '*the Asset, the 6 million number, was in the context of a forced liquidation of the Company [Allied Deals] that we talked about earlier, so that brings with it distressed Seller connotations [\u2026]*,' and thus is nowhere close to an FMV sale proving Vinto's liquidity\". \"The third transaction that Claimant counts for Vinto, and the second for Colquiri, is Glencore's 2005 acquisition of the two Assets from S\u00e1nchez de Lozada. This transaction was also conducted under irregular, highly secretive and non-transparent circumstances, while S\u00e1nchez de Lozada had by then fled Bolivia. This sale of the Assets to Glencore does not serve as proof that it would not '*be difficult to find potential buyers for Colquiri and Vinto*,' as Claimant now posits\".

Further Questions Posed by the Tribunal to the Parties\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n487.\n\nWith respect to the CRP, the Tribunal requested a precedent where \"*a tribunal has calculated a country risk premium in the same way as the Respondent proposes for this case*\". Bolivia's response was that \"there is none because one of the methods used in the average was created by [the] Claimant exclusively for this case and cannot be found in any published source. The Tribunal should rather ask itself whether a tribunal has calculated a CRP in the same way as the Claimant's experts propose for this case. We are aware of none. Had Dr. Flores relied solely on the Country Risk Rating Model by Ibbotson/Morningstar (which would have led to a higher CRP of 18.45% for 2007 and 15.51% for 2012), then the Tribunal's question would be answered in the positive: it is the same publication relied on by the *Tidewater* tribunal to account for the risk of doing business in Venezuela.\"776\n\nBolivia's Post Hearing Brief, \u00b6 155.\n\n488.\n\nRegarding its method to calculate the CRP, the Claimant replies that \"[t]he *Rurelec* tribunal used this approach for calculating Bolivia's sovereign default risk, and Dr Flores accepts that this EMBI proxy methodology is appropriate for developing Bolivia's sovereign default risk. Therefore, Bolivia's assertion in its Post-Hearing Brief that there is no precedent of a tribunal accepting a country risk premium calculated pursuant to the EMBI proxy methodology is false. The EMBI proxy methodology also is consistent with Professor Damodaran's recommendations for calculating country risk premia for countries like Bolivia on the Valuation Dates that lack direct EMBI data.\"777\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Reply, \u00b6 55.\n\n489.\n\nWith respect to Bolivia's CRP, the Claimant recalls that Bolivia admitted that \"there is no[] [precedent for such calculation]\" and submits that \"[t]his is because Dr Flores's proposed 1.5 multiplier is only appropriate for valuations of short-term investments. In fact, to try to justify this multiple, Bolivia relied at the Hearing on Quantum on examples proposed by Professor Damodaran for a five-year valuation. The Compass Lexecon experts objected to Bolivia's characterizations of these examples, and testified that they are inapplicable here because the parties are valuing Colquiri and Vinto as long-term (20-year), not short-term investments. Dr Flores also proposed the 1.5 multiplier in the *Rurelec* arbitration, and that tribunal rejected Quadrant's argument because 'Professor Damodaran is on the record favouring [the] multiplier \u2026 *only for short term valuations.*'\"778 Finally regarding the use of the Ibbotson indicator the Claimant stated that \"Bolivia's reliance on *Tidewater* is misplaced\".779 According to the Claimant, \"[t]he tribunal in *Tidewater* relied on Ibbotson as the country risk premium. It did that because the tribunal (*i*) rejected the claimants' unreasonably low country risk premium of 1.5%, which it called unrealistic; and (*ii*) the tribunal found the Ibbotson risk premium to be consistent with the country risk premia for Venezuela adopted by other tribunals. Here, Dr Flores did not demonstrate that Bolivia's Ibbotson country risk premium is consistent with any other source. On the contrary, Dr Flores's two calculations of country risk lead to widely divergent results: 18.45% for 2007 and 15.51% for 2012 under Ibbotson, and 7.81% for 2007 and 5.54% for 2012 under the EMBI proxy with the 1.5 multiplier. [Dr. Flores] then averages them in a transparent attempt to increase the country risk premium\".780\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Reply, \u00b6 59.\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Reply, \u00b6 62.\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Reply, \u00b6 63.\n\n490.\n\nThe Tribunal also posed a question regarding whether there is an example where \"[a] tribunal has used [Ibbotson] as a basis to determine a [CRP].\" According to the Claimant \"there is no precedent of a tribunal that has relied on Ibbotson in the manner that Dr Flores recommends here.\"781 The Claimant further contends that \"Ibbotson is not a market-based measure of country risk. It is a subjective assessment based on the opinions of a limited number of bankers. This methodology has flaws and drawbacks that have been thoroughly identified in the financial literature. Other tribunals that have had to consider Dr Flores's proposed methodology have rejected doing so. In *Quiborax*, the tribunal noted that both valuation experts agreed on the starting point for calculating sovereign debt risk\u2014there, Professor Damodaran's estimate; here, the EMBI proxy\u2014and it decided to rely on the agreed starting point and did not adopt Dr Flores's recommendation to average Professor Damodaran's estimate with Ibbotson's country risk premium\".782\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Reply, \u00b6 60.\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Reply, \u00b6 61.\n\n491.\n\nAccording to Bolivia, \"[t]he size/illiquidity premium should not be confused with the 1.5 multiplier that corrects [the] Claimant's synthetic reconstructed EMBI proxy. Accordingly, in response to the Tribunal's Question No. 3(c), there is no need for Bolivia to provide a precedent where '*a tribunal has included in a DCF model both a size/illiquidity premium together with an additional size premium*,' as Dr Flores has not included in his DCF model a size/illiquidity premium together with an additional size premium.\"783\n\nBolivia's Post Hearing Brief, \u00b6 158.\n\n492.\n\nThe Claimant replied that \"Bolivia did not respond to this question because the answer, which is no, demonstrates that its proposed application of those two factors is unprecedented, unsound and should be denied\".784 According to the Claimant, \"[t]he evidence presented at the Hearing, proved that the use of a *size premium* is not standard practice in international finance. Other tribunals have also rejected the application of additional premia for size or illiquidity. As Dr Abdala testified, it is incorrect to apply a US-based size premium to a company in an emerging market (like Colquiri and Vinto)\".785 The Claimant adds that according to its experts \"it is inappropriate to include an illiquidity premium in the discount rates for the valuations of Colquiri and Vinto because selling all of the shares of a company has the same prospective selling time ([*i.e.*], illiquidity) whether the company is publicly traded or not.\"786\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Reply, \u00b6 65.\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Reply, \u00b6 66.\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Reply, \u00b6 67.\n\ne. Analysis by the Tribunal\n---------------------------\n\n493.\n\nAs a starting point, the Claimant proposes the use of an EMBI proxy to calculate the CRP through the sovereign debt approach.787 This indicator was also used in *Rurelec*, another case involving Bolivia.788 Bolivia contends that there needs to be \"a correcting factor applied to Compass Lexecon's proxy EMBI to adjust a measure of sovereign debt risk to a measure applicable to equity risks such as those facing Glencore's business operations in Bolivia\".789 Such correcting factor is the result of averaging Bolivia's sovereign debt spread scaled up using Prof. Damodaran's 1.5 global average equity multiplier with the Ibbotson/Morningstar's Country Risk Rating Model.\n\nCompass Lexecon Second Expert Report, \u00b6\u00b6 117-120.\n\n*Guaracachi America, Inc and Rurelec Plc v.

There is no clear justification or foundation for the use of these two specific indicators and, more importantly, for averaging them. The Respondent has failed to articulate why these two methodologies are connected or why they are appropriate for this particular valuation. Since the Tribunal is not able to discern the rationale for the methodology or the relationship between the variables, it is also difficult to accept each of them separately. Finally, the Tribunal notes that this particular methodology has not been used in any other valuation. For all these reasons, the Tribunal rejects this correction.\n\n495.\n\nWith respect to the illiquidity/size premium, once more the Tribunal finds it difficult to accept this premium. The rationale for applying a U.S.-based indicator to an emerging market is not clear. Even if the indicator was applicable in this case, the Tribunal struggles with how this indicator is applicable to companies of the size of Vinto in the Bolivian market and also how this adjustment is pertinent to addressing other indicators such as measurement limitations of the CAPM, diversification, and indirect costs of this particular company on the Bolivian market. For all these reasons, the Tribunal also rejects the inclusion of this premium in the DCF Model.\n\n**4. The Antimony Smelter**\n---------------------------\n\n496.\n\nThe Claimant has indicated that the Antimony Smelter was only operational for a short period of time and by the time it was privatized, it had been inoperative for a few years. The Claimant explains that \"[a] combination of limited domestic supply and low international antimony prices meant that the Antimony Smelter remained out of service after it was acquired by Glencore Bermuda in 2006\".790 The Claimant's expert indicates that \"as a non-operating asset at the time of its expropriation (and with no plans to make it operational), the most appropriate valuation methodology to establish the FMV of the Antimony Smelter is the asset-based approach. Under this approach, the FMV of the Antimony Smelter is equivalent to the sum of the value of its individual components.\"791\n\nStatement of Claim, \u00b6 251.\n\nStatement of Claim, \u00b6 251.\n\n497.\n\nThe Parties agree that an asset-based methodology is appropriate; however, they disagree on the date of valuation and the value of the Antimony Smelter's assets.792\n\nClaimant's Reply on Quantum, \u00b6 157.

Valuation Date**\n---------------------\n\n498.\n\nThe Claimant argues that \"[\u2026] the valuation date must reflect the situation that would have existed *but-for* the State's wrongful conduct\"793 and that \"where the value of an investment has increased following expropriation, 'full reparation may require [\u2026] the valuation date to be fixed at the date of the award'.\"794 According to the Claimant, the valuation should be made as of the date of the award. As a proxy, the Claimant's expert presents a valuation as of 22 January 2020, the date of the Reply on Quantum.795 Based on Article 5 of the Treaty, the Respondent contends that the appropriate date for valuation is the date immediately before it was reverted to the State, *i.e.,* 30 April 2010.796\n\nStatement of Claim, \u00b6 253.\n\nStatement of Claim, \u00b6 254.\n\nClaimant's Reply on Quantum, \u00b6 156.\n\nBolivia's Statement of Defence, \u00b6 701. \"[T]he State parties to the Treaty clearly and explicitly accepted a compensation provision that is general in scope and that admits of no limitation to cases of lawful expropriation [\u2026] the Treaty establishes that, if the Antimony Smelter reversion were an expropriation (*quod non*), compensation must be assessed on the date the Antimony Smelter reversion occurred or became public knowledge, whichever is earlier.\" \u00b6\u00b6 719 and 721.\n\n499.\n\nThe Claimant argues that the Antimony Smelter has \"appreciated in value\" since its nationalization, \"at least in part because it is located outside of a city (named Oruro) that has grown over the last decade causing land values in the city and surrounding areas to increase\" and that calculating the FMV as of April 2010 \"would allow Bolivia, rather than [the] Claimant, to retain the increase in the [s]melter's value, thereby rewarding Bolivia for breaching the Treaty\".797 In contrast, Bolivia argues that Article 5 of the Treaty provides for the standard of \"full compensation\", which is satisfied by valuating the loss immediately prior to the expropriation or when it became public, that the date of the award has no connection to the breach and loss suffered since the date of the award is arbitrary, that using that day would \"allow investors to time litigation strategically and abusively in order to maximize compensation,\" and that \"[t]here was official and reliable contemporaneous information (as of 2010) about the Antimony Smelter's land and buildings\".798\n\nClaimant's Reply on Quantum, \u00b6\u00b6 159 and 160.\n\nBolivia's Statement of Defence, \u00b6\u00b6 723-726. See also Bolivia's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6\u00b6 89-116.\n\n*i. Analysis by the Tribunal*\n-----------------------------\n\n500.\n\nThe Tribunal has determined that the Respondent breached Article 5 of the Treaty by expropriating the Antimony Smelter. Such expropriation was not made for a public purpose nor against just and effective compensation.799 Article 5 of the Treaty indicates that: \"[\u2026] compensation *shall amount* to the market value of the investment expropriated *immediately before the expropriation* or before the impending expropriation became public knowledge, whichever is earlier\".\n\nSee Section VI.1.B.iv above.\n\n501.\n\nThe text of this provision establishes the parameters for compensation and effectively mandates, through the use of the word \"shall\", what the FMV in cases of expropriation must be. While the Tribunal is aware of the investment case law cited by the Claimant, we do not consider in this case it would be appropriate to calculate the FMV of the Antimony Smelter by reference to the date of the award. The purpose of Article 5 is to ensure that compensation is given when an expropriation takes place, and such compensation entails calculating what the FMV would be if the investor had sold to a willing buyer the investment \"but-for\" the Respondent's breach, which is, in this case, what the FMV of the Antimony Smelter had been if not for the Reversion Decree that effectively took away the property and control of the Antimony Smelter in 2010.\n\n502.\n\nWe consider that the time that has passed from the taking until now, *i.e.*, 13 years, must be taken into account. The Tribunal considers it necessary to balance on one hand the Claimant's entitlement to compensation without necessarily punishing the Respondent for the lapsed time. In consequence, we consider that the appropriate date of valuation would be 30 April 2010.\n\n**B. Valuation of the Antimony Smelter**\n----------------------------------------\n\n503.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, \"the value of the Antimony Smelter consists of the value of the land on which it is located, and the replacement value of the buildings and improvements to the land.\"800 The Claimant's expert adopted the value for the buildings proposed by Bolivia's expert for her second report and updated it for inflation up to 22 January 2020. As to the value of the land, the Claimant's expert applied \"a two-step market-based approach that resulted in the updated value of approximately US$3 million as of 22 January 2020.\"801\n\nClaimant's Reply on Quantum, \u00b6 161.\n\nClaimant's Reply on Quantum, \u00b6 162. \"To calculate this amount, Ms. Russo first determined the current average value of land (per square meter) comparable to the land where the Antimony Smelter is located, and then adjusted that average value downward to reflect the specific characteristics of the land on which the Antimony Smelter is located\u2014[*i.e*.], road access, the relative flatness of the land, availability of utilities such as water and electricity, and the size and industrial use of the land.\"\n\n504.\n\nThe Claimant contends that the fiscal value used by Bolivia's expert is inappropriate since it \"grossly undervalues the land\". In this regard, it indicates that the fiscal value is \"calculated by the State for taxation purposes and is not intended to represent the FMV of the land\".802 It submits as well that the market-based approach is precisely designed to value distinct properties, that \"the growth of the city of Oruro over the last decade has increased the demand for land around the city\", that the Claimant's expert valued the land as industrial land, and that since \"Bolivia does not have an official registry of real estate transactions, property appraisers in Bolivia typically rely [\u2026] on realtors, land valuation experts and real estate publications as sources for land prices.\"803 In order to adjust the land value, the Claimant's expert accounted for the specific characteristics of the land, such as access to roads, utilities, topography and size.804\n\nClaimant's Reply on Quantum, \u00b6 165.\n\nClaimant's Reply on Quantum, \u00b6\u00b6 166-168.\n\nClaimant's expert does not apply a discount for utilities since \"the land title includes easements for access to water, sewage and electricity services through the property of the neighboring Vinto Tin Smelter\". Claimant's Reply on Quantum, \u00b6 169.\n\n505.\n\nAs to pollution, the Claimant alleges that the Respondent has not proved that pollution was caused by Glencore Bermuda or that any pollution has prevented the industrial use of the land or the land of the neighboring Vinto Smelter; therefore, the Claimant considers that any pollution would not affect the continued industrial use. Finally, the Claimant considers that the purchase price of the smelter corroborates its valuation: updating the purchase price (US$1.1 million) for inflation to the date of the Claimant's Reply on Quantum would produce a value of US$2.6 million, and this value did not even account for the rise in land values.805\n\nClaimant's Reply on Quantum, \u00b6 172.\n\n506.\n\nOn the other hand, the Respondent opposes the Claimant's valuation arguing that it \"does not submit any evidence of what the [l]and's value would have been in 2010 or even the slightest indication of what the rate of appreciation would have been for industrial land with similar characteristics\", that \"the [l]and could not have appreciated as it is earmarked for industrial use in an area where the development of new industrial activity is (i) opposed by residents; and (ii) prohibited by regulation\", that the smelter is a liability, that the Claimant's valuation \"ignores the real condition of the [l]and and the remediation and clean-up costs that it requires, which would be higher than the price of the [l]and itself\", and that \"given that the buildings are abandoned and in a state of ruins [\u2026] they would have to be demolished and dismantled\".806 In the Respondent's view, the Claimant is unable to establish that it suffered damages due to the reversion of the \"abandoned, deteriorated and significantly polluted Antimony Smelter\".807\n\nBolivia's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6\u00b6 201-207. Bolivia's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6141.\n\nBolivia's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6 208.\n\n*i. Analysis by the Tribunal*\n-----------------------------\n\n507.\n\nAt the request of the Tribunal, the Parties presented a joint valuation model. The difference between them is the Claimant's expert valuation (US$1.9 million) and the Respondent's expert valuation (US$0 million).808 At the outset, the Tribunal is not convinced by the Respondent's argument that \"no willing buyer would assign any value to the Antimony Smelter\".809 The Tribunal understands that the Respondent assigns zero value since it considers that remediation costs would be greater than any value of the land. However, even though the Respondent's expert referred to the estimated cost of Asarco Everett Smelter's cleanup, it is not clear why this cost would be an appropriate parameter. The Tribunal does not have further information with which to estimate the remediation costs for the Antimony Smelter and as far as we understand, no estimation can be based on any subsequent remediation since Bolivia has also not incurred those expenses; therefore, taking into account such costs would be speculative.\n\nRespondent's expert indicates that \"[r]egarding the [l]and, as of 30 April 2010, it would have had a maximum market value of US$ 293,987.90. However, a potential buyer of the Antimony Smelter would take into account the costs of environmental remediation. I estimate that, in the circumstances, these costs would exceed the value of the [l]and. Therefore, I confirm that the [l]and does not have a positive commercial value\". Diego Mirones, Second Expert Report, 5 June 2020, \u00b6 126.\n\nBolivia's Post-Hearing Reply, \u00b6 120.\n\n508.\n\nFor the Tribunal, it is somewhat confusing as well that the Antimony Smelter is labeled as \"abandoned, deteriorated and significantly polluted\" by the Respondent, since this somehow highlights the Claimant's argument of why it was occasionally used as storage and not put into production *vis-\u00e0-vis* Bolivia's justification for reverting the asset. Regardless of its characterization, the Tribunal considers that even if it was considered a deteriorated asset, the land still holds value.\n\n509.\n\nFor its valuation, the Claimant's expert determined first the \"initial value of the land\".810 According to its second expert report, the market-based approach used \"value comparables or benchmarks as of the date of [the] Updated Valuation Report\" and then those values were adjusted to account for specific characteristics. The Claimant's expert used information from publications dated August 2019.811 However, as the Tribunal determined, the relevant date of valuation is 2010. The Claimant's valuation does not provide information as to what would have been the value of the land in 2010 nor does it adjust the calculations based on current information to bring the value to that date. The Respondent's expert takes as a starting point the cadastral value and also adjusts the value using some factors applied as well by the Claimant's expert, such as road access, relative flatness of the land and availability of utilities. The information used by the Respondent's expert is from 2010.812\n\nGina Russo First Expert Report, \u00b6 70.\n\nGina Russo Second Expert Report, 22 January 2020, \u00b6\u00b6 4.1, 4.2; Claimant's Reply on Quantum, \u00b6 162.\n\nMirones Second Expert Report, \u00b6 105; Claimant's Reply on Quantum, \u00b6 163.\n\n510.\n\nSince the Respondent's expert valuation is based on information and indicators that allow us to establish the Antimony Smelter's value as of 30 April 2010, the Tribunal considers that this would be the most appropriate valuation.813\n\nMirones Second Expert Report, \u00b6 107.\n\n511.\n\nRegarding the value of the buildings, the Claimant's expert initially calculated the FMV applying a methodology based on their replacement cost in new condition and then discounted the value of different categories of buildings and improvements.814 The Tribunal notes that the valuation of the buildings and improvements was also based on current values.815 On the other hand, the Respondent's expert indicated that \"a well-informed buyer will not pay more for an asset than the amount of money needed to rebuild or manufacture a new one that is equal to that which is being valued\" and that in 2010 the buildings were (and continue to be) abandoned and deteriorated. As a starting point for its valuation, the Respondent's expert used 2010 average market values calculated based on the price paid by Bolivia for the construction of the plant and applied coefficients to obtain a residual value, which as of 30 April 2010, amounted to US$370,405.69.816\n\nStatement of Claim, \u00b6 283; Gina Russo First Expert Report, \u00b6\u00b6 6.1-7.1.\n\nStatement of Claim, \u00b6 281. \"To determine the value of the Antimony Smelter's buildings and improvements, I considered their description and presumed state of repair as of the date of this Valuation\".

See also Gina Russo First Expert Report, \u00b6 6.2.\n\nMirones Second Expert Report, \u00b6\u00b6 108-112.\n\n512.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the Claimant's expert adopted in its second report the values proposed by the Respondent's expert and adjusted them for inflation up to 2020.817 As in the case of the valuation of the land, the Tribunal considers that it is not appropriate to calculate the valuation of the assets based on information that does not correspond to the value of the assets as of the valuation date, *i.e*., April 2010 and neither its update to 2020. In consequence, we consider that the appropriate valuation for the buildings is the one proposed by the Respondent's expert.\n\nGina Russo Second Expert Report, \u00b6 1.4 b).\n\n**C. The 3% Transaction Tax**\n-----------------------------\n\n513.\n\nThe Respondent originally argued that the valuation by the Claimant's expert was inflated since it did not take into account a 3% municipal tax applicable to real estate transactions.818 In its Post-Hearing Brief, the Claimant submitted that this tax was inapplicable to the valuation of the Antimony Smelter since it applied to individuals and not corporations. However, it indicated that it \"acknowledges that the sale of the Antimony Smelter could be subject to a 3% tax on transactions ('*impuesto a las transacciones*')\".819 Moreover, in its Post-Hearing Reply, the Claimant further clarified that \"[t]he parties agreed to include the 3% tax in the Joint Model for the Antimony Smelter, and Glencore Bermuda has already explained that the disagreement with respect to the 3% tax no longer exists. The parties therefore have agreed on all applicable existing Bolivian taxes, and the valuations in the Joint Models are net of all existing Bolivian taxes.\"820\n\n*i. Analysis by the Tribunal*\n\nBolivia's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6 796.\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, fn. 87.\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Reply, \u00b6 80.\n\n514.\n\nThe Tribunal observes that according to the relevant provision, \"[t]he Tax on Transactions [\u2026] is levied on the sale of real estate and motor vehicles made within its business by commercial houses, importers and manufacturers [\u2026]\".821 This provision distinguishes between this tax and the municipal tax. In accordance with the text of the provision and by the Claimant's admission on the applicability of the tax on transactions, the Tribunal considers it appropriate to include this tax in the valuation as agreed in the joint model.\n\nLaw No. 843 and Regulatory Decrees, Art. 107, **R-525** (unofficial translation). Spanish original: \"*Art\u00edculo 107: Se establece que el Impuesto a las Transacciones que grava las transferencias eventuales de inmuebles y veh\u00edculos automotores es de Dominio Tributario Municipal, pasando a denominarse Impuesto Municipal a las Transferencias de Inmuebles y Veh\u00edculos Automotores, que se aplicar\u00e1 bajo las mismas normas establecidas en el T\u00edtulo VI de la Ley N\u00b0 843 (Texto Ordenado Vigente) y sus reglamentos. No pertenecen al Dominio Tributario Municipal el Impuesto a las Transacciones que grava la venta de inmuebles y veh\u00edculos automotores efectuada dentro de su giro por casas comerciales, importadoras y fabricantes*.\"\n\n**5. The Tin Stock**\n--------------------\n\n515.\n\nThe Tribunal recalls *first* that when the Antimony Smelter was nationalized, there were tin concentrates stored that were not returned to the Claimant despite its requests to Bolivia. Such concentrates were considered afterwards as part of the Antimony Smelter's assets, and *second*, we recall our finding that the Antimony Smelter Reversion Decree (including the tin stock seizure) constituted an expropriation not made for a public purpose nor against just and effective compensation.822 The Parties do not disagree on the valuation date or the method for the valuation of the Tin Stock.823 However, there is disagreement as to the number of tonnes. While the Claimant considers the Tin Stock to be comprised of 161 tonnes, the Respondent considers it to be comprised of 157.6 tonnes.\n\nSee Section VI.1.B.iv above.\n\nClaimant's Reply on Quantum, \u00b6 173; Bolivia's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6 811.\n\n**A. Analysis by the Tribunal**\n-------------------------------\n\n516.\n\nThe Claimant bases its position on communications between Colquiri, the Ministry of Mining and EMV. Those communications are from 2010, specifically between 3 May 2010 (two days after the Antimony Smelter Reversion Decree) and 8 June 2010. The first letter indicates the number of tin concentrates, *i.e.*, 161 tonnes.824 Through this letter, the Executive President of Colquiri requested the return of the stock. On 5 May 2010, the Minister of Mining requested EMV to return the concentrates and informed EMV that \"[a]ttached you will find a copy of the letter that [Colquiri] has sent us claiming 161 tonnes of tin concentrates\".825 On 8 June 2010, EMV, who was in possession of the concentrates, replied that the concentrates were \"considered as an asset of the [A]ntimony [S]melter as they were located on its premises at the time of nationalization\" and they would \"surely not be disposed of in any way until the *negotiations* that must be carried out *between the State and the Company* you represent are concluded\" (emphasis added).826 On the other hand, the Respondent presents a notarized report of 23 September 2010 indicating that the concentrates verified were 157,638.00 kg.827\n\nLetter from Colquiri (Mr. Capriles Tejada) to Ministry of Mining (Mr. Pimentel Castillo), 3 May 2010, **C- 28**.\n\nLetter from Ministry of Mining (Mr. Pimentel Castillo) to EMV (Mr. Ramiro Villavicencio), 5 May 2010, **C-29** (unofficial translation).\n\nLetter from EMV (Mr. Villavicencio) to Colquiri (Mr. Capriles), 8 June 2010, p. 2, **C-102** (unofficial translation).\n\nCertificate of Verification of Tin Concentrates Deposited in the Warehouse of the Plant of the Vinto Metallurgical Company, **EO-17**.\n\n517.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that the Respondent's report accurately reflects the amount of concentrates found in the Tin Smelter as of September 2010, *i.e*., 4 months *after* the Tin Smelter Reversion Decree. While the Respondent's witness testified that the Respondent \"*did not use the Tin Stock [\u2026and] the September 2010 notarized audit of the concentrates reflects the existing stock at the time of the reversion*\" (emphasis added)828 and the Tribunal certainly does not doubt that statement, the Tribunal has also no reason to doubt the contemporaneous documents presented by the Claimant. In this regard, the document that more accurately reflects the amount of concentrates as of the reversion date is the letter from Colquiri to the Ministry of Mining of 3 May 2010. Moreover, while the Minister of Mining could have merely referred to the amount of concentrates claimed by Colquiri, we observe that the company that was in possession of the concentrates did not object to the quantity claimed by Glencore Bermuda. In consequence, the Tribunal determines that the Tin Stock is comprised of 161 tonnes for the purposes of the present valuation.\n\nVillavicencio Third Witness Statement, \u00b6 88.\n\n**6. Claims on Interest**\n-------------------------\n\n518.\n\nThree issues arise regarding the applicable interest in this dispute. The *first* is the applicable rate of interest, the *second* is whether that interest rate should be fixed or variable and finally, the *third* is whether the interest should be simple or compound. We address these issues below.\n\n**A. Applicable Rate**\n----------------------\n\n519.\n\nThe Respondent has indicated that the \"applicability of Article V of the Treaty to [the] Claimant's interest claim is not in dispute between the Parties.\"829 However, the Parties disagree on the interest rate that should be applied by the Tribunal and that is consistent with the Treaty provision. According to the Claimant, \"the interest rates published by the Central Bank of Bolivia for commercial loans denominated in US dollars are indicative of 'normal commercial rates' in Bolivia as mandated by the Treaty.\"830 In support of its argument, the Claimant points to *South American Silver v. Bolivia* and *Rurelec v. Bolivia*, where Article V of the Treaty was applied and where the rates published by the Central Bank of Bolivia were relied on by the tribunal.831 The Claimant argues that those rates are based on data collected by the Central Bank regarding the actual rates of commercial loans in Bolivia and therefore measure \"normal\" commercial interest rates in Bolivia as required by the Treaty.832 The relevant rates published by the Central Bank of Bolivia, as provided by Compass Lexecon and relied on by the Claimant, are (*i*) 8.6% as of February 2007 (for Vinto), (*ii*) 6.1% as of April 2010 (for the Tin Stock), (*iii*) 6.4% as of May 2012 (for Colquiri), and (*iv)* 6.7% as of 2019 (as a proxy for the date of the award, which is the valuation date for the Antimony Smelter).833\n\nBolivia's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6 879.\n\nClaimant's Reply on Quantum, \u00b6 180.\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Reply, \u00b6 73.\n\nClaimant's Reply on Quantum, \u00b6 180.\n\nStatement of Claim, \u00b6 290; Claimant's Reply on Quantum, \u00b6 178.\n\n520.\n\nBolivia contends that the Claimant was relieved of its investment risk in the Assets from the very moment they were reverted to the State, therefore, any interest covering the period of time thereafter should be at the risk-free rate. Otherwise, the Claimant would be rewarded for an operating risk it did not bear and would be overcompensated.834 The Respondent dismisses the interest rates proposed by the Claimant on account that the Treaty mandates the application of interest at a \"commercially reasonable rate\", which would be the six-month or the one-year U.S. Treasury bill rate.835 It argues that \"[f]rom an economic perspective, the term commercial interest rate includes the rates that are regularly available to investors\"836 and that since \"the amount to be granted by an arbitral award is not exposed to risk, the applicable interest rate should compensate the Claimant exclusively for the time value of money\" through a risk-free interest rate. According to the Respondent, Compass Lexecon's proposed rates are unduly high because they reflect \"the interest rates applicable to *average* loans to *average* businesses in Bolivia\" and the Claimant: (i) does not request average loans (rather, it requests for multi-billion dollar loans), and (ii) is not an average business in Bolivia but a multinational corporation with high credit ratings, leverage and access to international financing which allows it to obtain financing at very low cost.837\n\nBolivia's Statement of Defence, \u00b6 918.\n\nBolivia's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 164.\n\nBolivia's Statement of Defence, \u00b6 928. As Dr. Flores explains, each specific rate \"*will depend on the risk profile of the financial product generating the interest payments.*\" Flores First Expert Report, \u00b6 196.\n\nBolivia's Statement of Defence, \u00b6\u00b6 928 and 937.\n\n521.\n\nAs to the arbitration cases put forward by the Claimant, the Respondent argues that the Tribunal is not bound by the decisions and that \"[i]t does not suffice that other tribunals may have decided to apply the interest rate on commercial loans in Bolivia to different claimants for this Tribunal's decision on interest to go in the same direction.\" The Respondent alleges that the Claimant bears the burden of analyzing the text of Article V and demonstrating that such Article \"prescribes the application of [\u2026] 'rates published by the Central Bank of Bolivia for commercial loans denominated in US dollars granted by banks to corporations in Bolivia'\", a burden that has not been discharged.838 Furthermore, the Respondent also posits that it would be inappropriate to follow the *South American Silver* and *Rurelec* decisions since in those cases the arbitration commenced months after the relevant facts took place and the pre-award interest claims spanned 3.5 and 6 years respectively, whereas in this case the Parties engaged in good faith negotiations for ten years before the arbitration commenced and the pre-award interest claim spans over 14 years. In Bolivia's view, it would be deeply unfair to be penalized for engaging in good faith negotiations by applying an unjustifiably high interest rate.839\n\nBolivia's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6 885.\n\nBolivia's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6 892.\n\n522.\n\nThe Claimant replies that its proposed are rates mandated by the Treaty and that the interest rates published by the Central Bank are lower than the rates at which Bolivia could have borrowed funds if it had promptly compensated Glencore Bermuda.840 Furthermore, on Bolivia's assertion that a risk-free or US LIBOR-based interest rate are not indicative of \"normal commercial\" rates in Bolivia, it argues that the risk-free rate relies on US Treasury bill rates and the US LIBOR rate relies on the borrowing rate of the Claimant's Swiss parent company, Glencore International. The Claimant also argues that the risk-free rate is inappropriate since it is based on rates for short-term debt (the six-month or one-year US Treasury bill rates) (which garners lower interest rates than long-term debt), highlighting the fact that Bolivia has owed Glencore Bermuda compensation for over a decade and that Bolivia's similar proposed interest rates were rejected in *South American Silver* and *Rurelec*.841 This is contradicted by Bolivia, which states that \"whether a rate reflects short or long-term debt is irrelevant for pre-award interest. The only relevant factor to determine pre-award interest rate is risk, and the U.S. Treasury bills rates are applicable because they are risk-free.\"842\n\nClaimant's Reply on Quantum, \u00b6 181. See also, Claimant's Post-Hearing Reply, \u00b6 72.\n\nClaimant's Reply on Quantum, \u00b6 184.\n\nBolivia's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6 912.\n\n523.\n\nWith respect to Bolivia's alternative proposal that the Tribunal peg the interest rate to US LIBOR plus 1%, the Claimant argues that it \"ignores the reality that businesses typically invest in opportunities that have a significantly greater amount of risk than [\u2026] LIBOR rates\", and that \"[t]he interest rate mandated by the Treaty does not hinge on whether Bolivia will pay an award; the Treaty rate is a proxy for an investor's expected return on its investment in Bolivia, and those returns are not risk free.\" The Claimant relies on Profs. S\u00e9n\u00e9chal and Gotanda's explanation that \"above all, businesses do exist to generate shareholder value and positive net present values (NPVs) for investors. Therefore, it is not correct to assume that the claimant is not compensated for the returns generated in a consistent manner over the years. As such, interest should not be awarded at the risk-free interest rate. As a result, an investor is right in asking for a rate above the risk-free rate\".843 In the Claimant's view, a LIBOR-based rate \"would not reflect Glencore Bermuda's true loss\", additionally, Glencore International's borrowing rate has no bearing on the interest rate that should be applied under the Treaty since \"the Treaty rate is a proxy for *Glencore Bermuda's* expected return on *its investments* in Bolivia\" (emphasis added).844\n\nClaimant's Reply on Quantum, \u00b6 185.\n\nClaimant's Reply on Quantum, \u00b6 186.\n\n524.\n\nAs to these arguments, the Respondent replies that the Claimant has provided no evidence to support the notion that the Treaty rate would be a proxy for an investor's return on its investment845 and that the Treaty establishes \"the rate at which interest should accrue on compensation for expropriation, so that the owner of the expropriated property may be adequately compensated for any delay in the payment of such compensation\". Bolivia contends that interest \"compensates for the time value of money, and nothing else\".846 The Respondent also argues that the \"Claimant fails to comment on the extensive case law cited by Bolivia, demonstrating the application by numerous international tribunals of the LIBOR rate plus a small margin as a normal commercial interest rate\" and on the fact that Profs. Gotanda and S\u00e9n\u00e9chal \"also recognize that the approach taken by investment tribunals is to award interest at a market rate such as the U.S. Treasury bills or LIBOR rates\".847\n\nAccording to Bolivia, \"[t]his assertion suggests that either (i) all foreign investors in Bolivia would have the same expected rate of return on their investments, irrespective of the sector and industry in which they operate and of the specific risk profiles of each investor or (ii) different rates of interest apply under the Treaty, to different investors, depending on their specific circumstances. Neither proposition is tenable, the former because it is incorrect from an economic standpoint, and the latter because it would run counter the function of interest (compensating the investor for the time value of money)\".

For instance, [the] Claimant's experts did not know (i) if the loans were denominated in US dollars or in other foreign currencies, such as Euro[];848 (ii) the number of loans reflected in the statistics[],849 which is relevant since a small number of loans means that the interest rate of a single loan could skew the data set; and (iii) the delinquency ratio of the borrowers.\"850 In reply, the Claimant alleges that its expert \"testified at the Hearing that '[a] normal commercial rate is a rate at which regular business can obtain financing, and we relied on the [i]nterest [r]ate for loans granted from banks to corporations in Bolivia [\u2026] as published by the Central Bank of Bolivia',\" and that \"the Central Bank rates represent an average of all commercial rates that Bolivian banks report to the Central Bank. For its part, Bolivia has failed to offer any evidence that the interest rates published by the Bolivian Central Bank are not representative of a 'normal commercial [\u2026] rate' in Bolivia.\"851\n\nTranscript, Hearing on Quantum, Day 5, p. 749, line 21-p. 750, line 14 (Ms. Chavich).\n\nTranscript, Hearing on Quantum, Day 5, p. 750, lines 15-25 (Ms. Chavich).\n\nBolivia's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 163.\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Reply, \u00b6 71.\n\n526.\n\nFinally, the Tribunal posed a question on this issue to Bolivia as to the consistency of applying a risk-free interest rate with an interpretation of the text of Article 5 of the Treaty based on the Vienna Convention. Bolivia's response was that \"[i]nterpreting Article V of the Treaty as demanding rates only available to Bolivian companies running business in Bolivia, as [the] Claimant suggests (despite the shortcomings of its proposed rate, discussed *supra*), would lead to '*manifestly absurd or unreasonable results*,' which would call for '*recourse to supplementary means of interpretation*', in the terms of Article 32 of the VCLT. In [the] Claimant's interpretation, the Treaty would authorize the application of a rate that is wholly unrelated to [the] Claimant (which borrows at a much lower rate and does not seek funding from Bolivian banks) and the risks it bore, going beyond compensating [the] Claimant for the time value of money.\"852 In reply, the Claimant contends that \"there is no evidence to support that a risk-free interest rate is a 'normal commercial' rate in Bolivia as Article 5 requires.\"853 Regarding the fact that accepting rates only available for Bolivian companies in Bolivia would lead to \"manifestly absurd or unreasonable results\" which would require \"recourse to supplementary means of interpretation\" under Article 32 of the VCLT, the Claimant responds that \"Bolivia does not [\u2026] identify what these 'supplementary means' would be, but it further argues that these unidentified means justify an interest rate of US LIBOR +1%\".854 Finally, the Claimant contends that \"there is no evidence to suggest that US LIBOR-based interest rate is consistent with 'normal commercial' rates in Bolivia as Article 5 requires\" because according to its expert the rates proposed by the Respondent's expert \"do [] not reflect the cost of financing of companies in Bolivia [\u2026] and [they do not] represent the cost of financing of Latin America[n] corporations.\"855\n\nBolivia's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 165.\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Reply, \u00b6 74.\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Reply, \u00b6 75.\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Reply, \u00b6 76.\n\n*i. Analysis by the Tribunal*\n-----------------------------\n\n527.\n\nWe begin with the text of Article 5 of the Treaty, which states:\n\n(1) [\u2026] Such compensation [\u2026] shall include *interest* at a *normal commercial* or *legal rate*, whichever is applicable in the territory of the expropriating Contracting Party, until the date of payment, [\u2026]\n\n(emphasis added)\n\n528.\n\nThis provision clearly states that not only must the interest be at a \"normal commercial rate\", it has to be *applicable* in the territory of the expropriating Party, *i.e.*, in the territory of Bolivia. However, it does not define the term at issue. Interpreting the term in accordance with Article 31(1) of the Vienna Convention, the ordinary meaning of the word \"normal\" is \"conforming to a type, standard, or regular pattern: characterized by that which is considered usual, typical, or routine; according with, constituting, or not deviating from a norm, rule, procedure, or principle; occurring naturally; approximating the statistical average or norm\".856 For the Tribunal, this word conveys a meaning of something that is \"usual\". On the other hand, while the word \"commercial\" may have several connotations, ordinarily it describes something that is related to commerce, profit and business activities.857 As employed in Article 5, it would indicate that the applicable interest rate is that which is \"usually or regularly\" employed commercially in Bolivia.\n\n\"[N]ormal\". *Merriam-Webster.com*. 2023. https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/normal 24 April 2023.\n\n\"[O]ccupied with or engaged in commerce or work intended for commerce; of or relating to commerce; characteristic of commerce; viewed with regard to profit; designed for a large market; emphasizing skills and subjects useful in business\". \"[C]ommercial\". *Merriam-Webster.com*. 2023. https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/commercial 24 April 2023.\n\n529.\n\nThe Respondent has failed to engage with the core legal interpretation at issue: it failed to answer why a rate provided for by the Central Bank of Bolivia would not be a \"normal commercial rate\" in the expropriating country.858 To the Tribunal, the value of the rate *vis-\u00e1-vis* other rates or whether the rate would have a larger impact because of the passage of time is not relevant to the correct interpretation of the relevant provision.\n\nThe tribunal in *South American Silver v. Bolivia*, a dispute under the UK-Bolivia Treaty, indicated that this rate is not established by the bank, but rather it is certified or published by the bank \"taking into account various interest rates used by various financial players\" and considered that \"given that these are the rates for commercial and financial operations in Bolivia, they are a normal commercial rate in the territory of the Respondent.\" *South American Silver Limited (Bermuda) v. The Plurinational State of Bolivia,* PCA Case No 2013-15, Award, 22 November 2018, \u00b6 891, **CLA-252**. See also *Guaracachi America, Inc and Rurelec Plc v. Plurinational State of Bolivia,* UNCITRAL, Award, 31 January 2014, \u00b6 615, **CLA-120**.\n\n530.\n\nThe interest rate mandated by the Treaty is an interest rate that is a normal commercial rate in the expropriating country and the Respondent has failed to articulate why a rate available to \"Bolivian companies running business in Bolivia\" would not qualify as a normal commercial rate and why it would require resorting to supplementary means of interpretation under the VCLT. In its Post Hearing Brief, the Respondent attempts to challenge the Claimant's position that the Bolivian Central Bank rate is \"representative of the rate the Tribunal should apply\", but as the Claimant correctly points out, it was for Bolivia to submit evidence that the rates established by its Central Bank are not \"normal commercial rates\" in the Bolivian market. In consequence, the Tribunal cannot agree with the Respondent's allegations.\n\n**B. Fixed or Variable Interest**\n---------------------------------\n\n531.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, \"[i]nternational investment tribunals regularly apply fixed interest rates for the entire period during which interest accrues even when variable rates are available\".859 According to the Claimant, \"it is more appropriate to award a fixed rate of interest as of the Valuation Dates for the Assets for three reasons. *First*, the interest rates as of the Valuation Dates are the best indicator of commercial rates available as of those Dates, consistent with the *ex-ante* approach used in the valuation of the Assets.\"860 *Second*, \"it is consistent with economic reality as Bolivia generally borrows money in the international capital markets at a fixed rate and usually for a period of ten years or more\",861 and *third,* \"as the differences in the rates show, averaging the rates from the Valuation Dates with the lower interest rates applicable in more recent years rewards Bolivia for its decade-long delay in compensating Glencore Bermuda and disincentivizes Bolivia to pay the Tribunal's award.\"862\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 47.\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 49.\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 49.\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 49.\n\n532.\n\nReplying to the first two reasons put forth by the Claimant, the Respondent argues that \"the financial product generating any interest payments in this case would be the Tribunal's award. Accordingly, the interest rate is necessarily applied *ex post* to bring a past value to the award payment's date\".863 The Respondent further argues that the Claimant's position \"is inconsistent with the principle that, under international law, compensation should repair the harm actually suffered by *the victim*, which is unrelated to the perpetrator of the allegedly wrongful act [\u2026] compensatory interest should not be equated to a State's borrowing rate\", and that the \"Claimant's proposed comparison would lead to the award on interest being totally dissociated from [the] Claimant's alleged loss.\"864\n\nBolivia's Post-Hearing Reply, \u00b6 131.\n\nBolivia's Post-Hearing Reply, \u00b6 132. See also, Bolivia's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6 905.\n\n533.\n\nAs to the third reason put forward by the Claimant, Bolivia indicates this \"consequential argument is disingenuous as it fails to consider that both Parties engaged in good faith negotiations for ten years before this [a]rbitration commenced []. [The] Claimant's interest claim, in fact, asks the Tribunal to penalize Bolivia for engaging in these negotiations through the application of unjustifiably high interest rates.\"865\n\nBolivia's Post-Hearing Reply, \u00b6 133. See also, Bolivia's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6 892.\n\n*i. Analysis by the Tribunal*\n-----------------------------\n\n534.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the Treaty does not explicitly provide for a fixed or variable rate of interest. We consider it more appropriate under the circumstances to award interest at fixed rates from the valuation dates for the Assets, as the interest rates as of the valuation dates are the best indicator of the normal commercial rates available as of those dates.866 We agree with the Claimant that under the circumstances a party would have obtained long-term loans at fixed interest rates, when it was deprived of the use of its assets, as opposed to taking out yearly loans.\n\nSee *Guaracachi America, Inc. and Rurelec Plc v. Plurinational State of Bolivia,* UNCITRAL, Award, 31 January 2014, \u00b6 615, **CLA-120**; *South American Silver Limited (Bermuda) v. Plurinational State of Bolivia*, PCA Case No 2013-15, Award, 22 November 2018, \u00b6\u00b6 897, 938(h), **CLA-252**.\n\n**C. Simple or Compound**\n-------------------------\n\n535.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, the only way to fully compensate Glencore Bermuda is \"to compound the pre-award interest rate on an annual basis\". The Claimant argues that tribunals have frequently noted that compound interest best gives effect to the rule of full reparation, that compound interest ensures that a respondent State is not given a windfall as a result of its breach since it recognizes the time value of a claimant's losses, and that it also \"reflects economic reality in modern times\" where \"[t]he time value of money in free market economies is measured in compound interest.\"867\n\nStatement of Claim, \u00b6 291.\n\n536.\n\nConversely, the Respondent contests that although some tribunals have awarded compound interest recently, other tribunals have refused to do the same, favoring simple interest. Bolivia indicates that tribunals are not unanimous in awarding compound interest and such interest should only be granted in specific circumstances.868 On this point, it alleges that the Claimant has not made any specific allegations regarding any circumstances that would support its claim for compound interest. The Respondent submits that if interest were to be awarded, it should be simple.869 Bolivia claims that the only circumstance that the Claimant could invoke is its own financial betterment since the claims relate to events that took place between 5 and 10 years ago and that \"[t]he self-serving nature of [the] Claimant's compound interest claim is evidenced by the substantial difference between the value of such claim and the amount of interest that would accrue using simple interest.\"870\n\nBolivia's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6\u00b6 925 and 926.\n\nBolivia's Statement of Defence, \u00b6 934.\n\nUS$ 338.6 million (as of 22 January 2020). Bolivia's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6 927.\n\n537.\n\nAdditionally, Bolivia contends that compound interests are prohibited by Articles 412 and 413 of its Civil Code.871 It indicates that international law allows the Tribunal to refer to domestic law regarding interests and in this regard, it relies on *Desert Line v. Yemen, Aucoven v. Venezuela* and *Duke Energy v. Ecuador* where local prohibitions of compound interest were enforced and simple interest was applied.872 On this point, the Claimant replies that \"[t]his is an international dispute in which Glencore Bermuda seeks compensation for the violations of its rights under international law. The law governing damages is customary international law, not Bolivian law\".873 The Claimant draws attention to the fact that Bolivia has made this argument under other disputes and such argument was rejected by those tribunals.874 It also mentions that two of those tribunals held that Bolivian law would allow the award of compound interest in commercial matters according to Article 800875 of the Bolivian Commercial Code.876\n\nBolivia's Statement of Defence, \u00b6 945; Bolivia's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 170.\n\nBolivia's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6 928.\n\nClaimant's Reply on Quantum, \u00b6 190.\n\nClaimant's Reply on Quantum, \u00b6 191, referring to *Quiborax v. Bolivia* ICSID Case No ARB/06/2, Award, 16 September 2015, **CLA-127**; *South American Silver Limited (Bermuda) v. Bolivia,* PCA Case No 2013-15, Award, 22 November 2018, **CLA-252** and *Guaracachi America, Inc. and Rurelec Plc v. Plurinational State of Bolivia,* UNCITRAL, Award, 31 January 2014, **CLA-120***.*\n\n\"*Art. 800.- (COMPOUND INTEREST). Accrued and unpaid interest cannot be compounded, unless this has been agreed after the execution of the contract or when the creditor judicially demands its payment. However, in any of these cases, the following circumstances must be met: 1) The interest is due for more than one year; and 2) The delay in the payment of principal and interest is not attributable to the creditor. The agreement is void against the provisions of this article.*\" (unofficial translation, emphasis added). See Bolivia's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6 929, fn. 1376.\n\nClaimant's Reply on Quantum, \u00b6 192.\n\n538.\n\nAs to this last argument, the Respondent replies that the Bolivian Commercial Code is only applicable to legal relationships related to commercial activity and the hypothesis of compensation for expropriation is not contemplated in the definition of commercial activity established by Article 6 of the Commercial Code.877 It alleges that even if the State was acting as a private entity, Article 800 would still not be applicable to this case, as the conditions for its application are not satisfied. In Bolivia's view, the choice made by the Claimant not to commence this arbitration for almost ten years contributed to the amount of time that will elapse between the reversions and any payment pursuant to this Tribunal's final award.878\n\nBolivia's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6 931.\n\n\"Under Article 800, compound interest can be applied exceptionally, provided that (i) interest has accrued for over a year; and (ii) the delay in the payment of the principal and corresponding interest is not attributable to the creditor.\" Bolivia's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6 932. See also Bolivia's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00b6 933.\n\n539.\n\nThe Claimant further relies on *Autopista Concesionada de Venezuela v. Venezuela* to indicate that \"[t]he purpose of post-award interest is 'to compensate the additional loss incurred from the date of the award to the date of final payment'.\" It thus takes the view that any delays in the payment of a damages award should be reflected and accounted for through the determination of post-award interest.879\n\nStatement of Claim, \u00b6 292.\n\n*i. Analysis by the Tribunal*\n-----------------------------\n\n540.\n\nThe first source to determine whether a simple or compound interest is applicable, according to the Vienna Convention, is the text of the relevant Treaty. Therefore, we shall focus on the specific provision at issue, which states:\n\n(1) [\u2026] Such compensation [\u2026] shall include interest at a *normal commercial or legal rate*, *whichever is applicable* in the *territory of the expropriating Contracting Party*, until the date of payment, [\u2026]\n\n(emphasis added)\n\n541.\n\nArticle 5 mandates that the interest at a normal commercial rate \"is *applicable in the territory* of the expropriating Contracting Party,\" in this case, in the territory of Bolivia. The Tribunal notes that the Claimant has not argued that the rate provided by the Central Bank of Bolivia regarding loans granted in foreign currency is a compound interest rate. The Tribunal further observes that the application of compound interests is forbidden in certain instances and applied exceptionally in others. Articles 412 and 413 of the Bolivian Civil Code provides:\n\nArticle 412 - Anatocism and all other forms of capitalization of interests are prohibited. Agreements to the contrary are void.\n\nArticle 413 - Charging conventional interests at a higher rate than the maximum legally permitted, as well as of capitalized interests, constitutes usury and is subject to restitution, regardless of criminal sanctions.880\n\nCivil Code of the Plurinational State of Bolivia, Arts. 412 and 413, **RLA-118** (unofficial translation).\n\n542.\n\nArticle 800 of the Bolivian Commercial Code also prohibits compound interest, with an exception:\n\nArt. 800.- COMPOUND INTEREST. Accrued and unpaid interest *cannot be com*pounded, *unless* this has been *agreed after the execution of the contract* or when the *creditor judicially demands its payment.* However, *in any of these cases*, the following circumstances must be met: 1) The interest is *due for more than one year*; and 2) The delay in the payment of principal and interest *is not attributable to the creditor*. The agreement is void against the provisions of this article.881\n\n(emphasis added)\n\nBolivian Commerce Code, 25 February 1977, **C-307** (unofficial translation).\n\n543.\n\nThus, under the law of the expropriating contracting Party, compound interest are generally prohibited and only applicable in exceptional circumstances.\n\n544.\n\nWhile compound interest has become the norm in recent years, tribunals have recognized that where the applicable treaty provides for a rate under domestic law that prohibits the payment of compound interest, tribunals have given effect to such provision and declined to award compound interest. In this regard, we note that in *Duke Energy v. Ecuador*, a prohibition in Ecuadorian law of compound interests was taken into account by the tribunal and simple interest was awarded.882 Similarly, in *Autopista Concesionada de Venezuela*, the tribunal, \"[h]aving concluded that the applicable Venezuelan law combined with the pertinent contract provision does not allow compound interest and that international law does not require it\", held that it \"can dispense with making a determination on whether the specific circumstances of the case prevent an award of compound interest in the present arbitration.\"883\n\n\"The Tribunal must further decide whether simple or compound interest should be awarded. It agrees with the Respondent's argument in favor of simple interest. Indeed, Ecuadorian law prohibits compound interest in the present case. Specifically, Article 244 of the Ecuadorian Constitution prohibits compound interest in the context of credits. Similarly, Article 2140 of the Civil Code provides that \"*it is prohibited to stipulate interest on interest*\" (Spanish original, Tribunal's translation). The same prohibition is contained in the Code of Commerce [\u2026].\" *Duke Energy Electroquil Partners & Electroquil S.A. v. Republic of Ecuador*, ICSID Case No. ARB/04/19, Award, 18 August 2008, \u00b6 457, **RLA-120**. We recognize that the tribunals in *Rurelec* and *South American Silver* decided to award compound interest on the ground that the issue was not governed by the UK-Bolivia BIT and that Bolivian law did not prohibit compound interest in the cases of commercial loans. We disagree. In our view, the language of the Treaty is clear on the application of Bolivian law to the payment of interest: \"Such compensation [\u2026] shall include interest at a normal commercial or legal rate, whichever is applicable in the territory of the expropriating Contracting Party [\u2026].\" In addition, as explained above, the evidence presented in this case shows that Bolivian law does not permit the payment of compound interest except in certain circumstances that do not apply here.\n\n*Autopista Concesionada de Venezuela, CA v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela,* ICSID Case No ARB/00/5, Award, 23 September 2003, \u00b6 396, **CLA-44**.\n\n545.\n\nAs noted, the Treaty clearly provides that interest shall be awarded at \"a normal commercial or legal rate, whichever is applicable in the territory of the expropriating Contracting Party\". Here, Bolivian law does not permit the payment of compound interest except in certain circumstances. The Claimant has not provided evidence that the Central Bank of Bolivia rate for loans granted in foreign currency is a compound interest rate. Having not done so and in light of Bolivian law's prohibition on compound interest (except in certain circumstances that do not exist in this case), the Tribunal must conclude that the Central Bank interest rate for loans granted in foreign currency does not carry compound interest. To be sure, commercial loans in Bolivia may call for the payment of compound interest, but the circumstances under which such interest may be paid are limited and the Claimant has not provided sufficient evidence that any of the exceptions apply; thus, the simple interest default rule under Bolivian law should govern.\n\n**D. Overall Conclusion on Interest**\n-------------------------------------\n\n546.\n\nIn light of the above, the Tribunal finds that simple interest shall be paid on damages awarded for the Colquiri Mine, the Tin Smelter, the Antimony Smelter and the Tin Stock at fixed rates established by the Central Bank of Bolivia for commercial loans denominated in US dollars as of the valuation dates for the Assets and up to the date of payment.884\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n**7. Claims on Taxes**\n----------------------\n\n547.\n\nIn its Statement of Claim, the Claimant requested \"that the Tribunal declare that: (i) its Award is made net of all applicable Bolivian taxes; and (ii) Bolivia may not tax or attempt to tax the Award.\"885 The Respondent on the other hand opposes the request. Bolivia alleges that the Claimant \"has failed to establish that Bolivian taxes would be expropriatory or in breach of international law\".886\n\nStatement of Claim, \u00b6 294.\n\nBolivia's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 172.\n\n548.\n\nAmong the questions posed by the Tribunal to the Parties, the Claimant was requested to provide its comment on Bolivia's statement as to the request for tax exemption. The Claimant was also required to comment on the following statement by the *Crystallex v. Venezuela* tribunal:\n\nWith regard to the Claimant's request that the Tribunal declare that any award be made net of all applicable Venezuelan taxes and Venezuela may not tax or attempt to tax the award, the Tribunal takes note that the Claimant's experts have indicated that their quantum calculations have been prepared net of Venezuelan tax. Faced with a similar request, the tribunal in *Occidental v. Ecuador* deemed such request \"speculative and premature\". This Tribunal likewise considers such request to be premature and thus denies the Claimant's request.887\n\n*Crystallex International Corporation v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela,* ICSID Case No ARB(AF)/11/2, Award, 4 April 2016, \u00b6 946, **CLA-130**.\n\n549.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, \"[t]he parties and their respective experts have agreed on *all* of the taxes that would have been applicable to the income that Glencore Bermuda would have generated from the Assets had Bolivia not taken them, and had Glencore Bermuda sold the Assets to a third party, and deducted all of those taxes from the [j]oint [m]odels, reducing the valuation of the Assets by tens of millions of dollars\".888 The Respondent contends that \"while [the] Claimant's DCF models for Colquiri and Vinto considered the effects of *some* Bolivian taxes (such as taxes on revenues, royalties, and remittance taxes), [the] Claimant's valuations have not accounted for *all* taxes. For instance, [the] Claimant avoided accounting for a 3% tax applicable to real estate transactions, which would be due in the event [the] Claimant receives compensation for the Antimony Smelter (*quod non*)\".889 The Respondent also clarifies that \"the fact that the Parties have agreed on the impact of the taxes included in the DCF calculations for Colquiri and Vinto only emphasizes the speculative character of [the] Claimant's request. [The] Claimant is seeking compensation for future hypothetical damages that may not materialize, and such claim is barred by international law\".890\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 51.\n\nBolivia's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 173.\n\nBolivia's Post-Hearing Reply, \u00b6 135.\n\n550.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, \"[t]ribunals have regularly found that, having taken into account all applicable taxes in their assessment of damages, the imposition of any additional taxes by the host State would run against the full reparation principle.\"891 The Respondent contends that these precedents are \"comprised of awards issued against Venezuela in circumstances that are particular to the Venezuelan political context\", lack \"reasoning regarding the tax exemption\", or are \"disingenuously misquoted by [the] Claimant\".892 For its part, Bolivia also refers to awards \"which have rejected requests similar to [the] Claimant's due to their speculative and premature character\".893\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 55.\n\nBolivia's Post-Hearing Reply, \u00b6 136.\n\nBolivia's Post-Hearing Reply, \u00b6 138.\n\n551.\n\nFinally, the Claimant requests \"that it be exempted from any attempt by Bolivia to use the guise of 'taxation' to collaterally attack the Tribunal's award and the damages that the Tribunal determines Glencore Bermuda is owed\".894 In the Claimant's view, this is not a \"speculative\" request but a protection in case \"Bolivia were to seek to deduct taxes from the award in addition to the existing taxes already deducted from damages\".895 Thus, \"Glencore Bermuda requests that the award be net of taxes to reflect the fact that the [j]oint [v]aluations are net of taxes, and to protect the finality and efficacy of the award because any further taxation would disallow the full reparations to which it is entitled under international law. This is Glencore Bermuda's only opportunity to request that the Tribunal ensure the integrity of its award by declaring it net of taxes.\"896 Alternatively, \"Glencore Bermuda requests that the Tribunal order Bolivia to gross-up the amount of compensation paid so that the net compensation received by Glencore Bermuda corresponds to the damages awarded by this Tribunal.\"897\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 60.\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 61.\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Reply, \u00b6 81.\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 63.\n\n552.\n\nIn the Respondent's view, the fact that the request by the Claimant \"to gross up the amount of compensation paid so that the net compensation received by Glencore Bermuda corresponds to the damages awarded by this Tribunal\" was presented to the Tribunal for the first time in its Post- Hearing Brief demonstrates that the \"Claimant has developed this specific claim only at the end of these proceedings\".898 Bolivia points out as well \"that taxation is an essential attribute of sovereignty, and that the Tribunal cannot prevent the State from levying lawful taxes over amounts awarded to [the] Claimant consistent with its own laws of general application. For instance, an award exempt of all taxes could facilitate tax evasion, considering that it would prevent Bolivia from collecting any taxes, including those that may be currently owed by [the] Claimant (and its group of companies) to the State and which have not been considered in the Parties' submissions nor in the joint models.\"899\n\nBolivia's Post-Hearing Reply, \u00b6 139\n\nBolivia's Post-Hearing Reply, \u00b6 140.\n\n**A. Analysis by the Tribunal**\n-------------------------------\n\n553.\n\nHaving considered the position of the Parties, the Tribunal finds that the amounts obtained in this Award are net of taxes, and, accordingly, Bolivia may not impose or attempt to impose these taxes on the Award. Notwithstanding, the Tribunal is of the view that a general instruction or order that \"Bolivia may not tax or attempt to tax the Award\" would be out of its jurisdiction.\n\n**VIII. COSTS**\n---------------\n\n**A. Claimant's Submission on Costs**\n-------------------------------------\n\n554.\n\nThe Claimant requests that the Tribunal order Bolivia to bear the Claimant's costs in its entirety. As indicated in its Statement of Costs, the Claimant seeks reimbursement of the costs incurred for: (i) advances paid for the fees and expenses of the members of the Tribunal and the administrative fees of the PCA; (ii) fees and costs of legal representation, independent experts, fact witnesses and service providers, and (iii) travel costs and expenses of party representatives.\n\n555.\n\nThe Claimant states that it has incurred a total of US$33,310,256.11, comprised of: (i) US$32,394,017.55 for legal representation and experts; (ii) US$602,139.00 for Tribunal and PCA costs; and (iii) US$314,099.57 for other costs.900\n\nAmended Statement of Costs, pp. 1-3.\n\n**B. Respondent's Submission on Costs**\n---------------------------------------\n\n556.\n\nThe Respondent requests the Tribunal to order reimbursement by the Claimant of all fees, costs and expenses incurred in the arbitration by Bolivia, in the amount of US$7,882,794.49 and to order such amounts carry interest at a normal commercial rate, due and payable from the date those costs and expenses were incurred until the date of full payment.\n\n557.\n\nThe Respondent states that its total costs are comprised of: (i) US$6,808,096.74 for legal and expert fees; (ii) US$600,000.00 for administrative costs; and (iii) US$474,697.75 for other costs.901\n\nBolivia's Cost Certificate, pp. 2-4.\n\n**C. Fixing the Costs of the Arbitration**\n------------------------------------------\n\n558.\n\nPursuant to Article 40(1) of the UNCITRAL Rules, the Tribunal proceeds now to \"fix the costs of arbitration in the final award\". In addition to the Parties' own costs set forth above, these costs include (i) the fees of the arbitral tribunal; (ii) the reasonable travel and other expenses incurred by the arbitrators; and (iii) the fees and expenses of the PCA for the administration of the arbitration and serving as appointing authority. The Parties each made deposits of US$600,000.00 to cover the abovementioned costs of the arbitration, for a total amount of US$1,200,000.00. The costs of arbitration covered from such deposits, taking into account the Terms of Appointment agreed upon by the Parties, the Tribunal, and the PCA, are as follows:\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **TRIBUNAL** | **US$607,079.35** |\n| **PCA** | **US$119,415.87** |\n| **OTHER EXPENSES** (including court reporting, catering, Courier expenses, IT/AV support, hearing facilities, interpretation, translation, travel, VAT, etc.) | **US$332,925.49** |\n| **TOTAL** | **US$1,059,420.71** |\n\n559.\n\nFollowing the issuance of this Award, the PCA shall issue a statement of account for the costs covered from the deposit and return the unexpended balance to the Parties in equal shares in accordance with Article 43(5) of the UNCITRAL Rules.\n\n**D. Apportionment of the Costs of the Arbitration**\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n560.\n\nArticle 42(1) of the UNCITRAL Rules provides that: \"[t]he costs of the arbitration shall in principle be borne by the unsuccessful party or parties. However, the arbitral tribunal may apportion each of such costs between the parties if it determines that apportionment is reasonable, taking into account the circumstances of the case\".\n\n561.\n\nIn this case, all of the Respondent's objections to jurisdiction have been dismissed and the Claimant has prevailed on the expropriation claim in respect of all of the Assets as well as in the FET claim over the Tin Smelter. The Claimant's other claims have been dismissed. While the Claimant did prevail on two claims, in the Tribunal's view, both Parties were to some extent unsuccessful.\n\n562.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that both Parties have conducted themselves with the decorum and professionalism required in a procedure of this type and that, even though there is no Party that prevailed in all of its claims or defenses, the arguments presented on both ends of this very complicated matter were meritorious. In the Tribunal's view, the circumstances of this case made it complex due to the nature of the allegations, the time elapsed, the volume of the record, the number of allegations involved, as well as the differing views on the calculation of damages.\n\n563.\n\nIn light of the above and pursuant to the discretion granted by Article 42(1) on the apportionment of costs, the Tribunal finds reasonable that each Party bears its own legal costs and expenses and that the common costs of the arbitration are borne in equal shares.\n\n**IX.

BACKGROUND**\n-----------------\n\n1.\n\nOn 8 September 2023, the Tribunal issued its Award in these proceedings, by which the Tribunal ruled on all the issues in dispute between the Parties, including jurisdiction, liability, and quantum, as well as the costs of the arbitration (the \"**Award**\"), as follows:\n\n564. For the reasons stated in this Award, the Tribunal decides as follows:\n\nObjections to Jurisdiction\n\na) The Respondent's objections to jurisdiction on the basis of the Claimant's qualification as an investor, piercing of the corporate veil, indirect investment, abuse of process, the unclean hands principle, and the ICC arbitration clause are dismissed.\n\nb) The Tribunal has jurisdiction over the Tin Stock claims.\n\nMerits of the Dispute\n\nc) The Respondent breached Article 5 of the Treaty when expropriating the Tin Smelter, the Antimony Smelter (including the Tin Stock) and the Colquiri Mine without a public purpose and without just and effective compensation.\n\nd) The Respondent's actions in response to the Colquiri events do not constitute a breach to Article 2(2) of the Treaty.\n\ne) The Respondent breached Article 2(2) of the Treaty as to the Tin Smelter Reversion Decree.\n\nf) As a result of the Respondent's breaches, Bolivia shall pay to the Claimant damages amounting to US$ 253,591,796, consisting of the following elements:\n\n1. Colquiri Mine: US$ 235,800,000;\n\n2. Tin Smelter: US$ 15,970,000;\n\n3. Antimony Smelter: US$ 694,960; and\n\n4.

The common costs of the arbitration shall be borne in equal shares by both Parties.\n\n2.\n\nOn 6 October 2023, the Claimant submitted a Request for Interpretation of the Award under Article 37 of the UNCITRAL Rules in relation to the compensation awarded for the Tin Smelter (\"**Request for Interpretation**\"). On the same date, the Respondent submitted a Request for Correction of the Award under Article 38 of the UNCITRAL Rules in relation to the computation of damages in the Award (\"**Request for Correction**\").\n\n3.\n\nOn 9 October 2023, the Tribunal invited the Claimant to submit any comments it may have on the Respondent's Request for Correction and the Respondent to submit any comments it may have on the Claimant's Request for Interpretation.\n\n4.\n\nOn 13 October 2023, the Parties submitted their respective comments on each other's requests (\"**Claimant's Response**\" and the \"**Respondent's Response**\"). The Claimant partially accepted the Respondent's Request for Correction, and the Respondent opposed the Claimant's Request for Interpretation.\n\n**II. REQUEST FOR INTERPRETATION**\n----------------------------------\n\n**A. The Claimant's Position**\n------------------------------\n\n5.\n\nThe Claimant requests \"that the Tribunal provide an interpretation of the Award confirming (i) whether the [Respondent's] payment of US$ 13,500,000 of the compensation due in relation to the Vinto Tin Smelter is conditioned on [the Claimant] providing Bolivia with the written confirmations specified in paragraph 470 of the Award [\u2026]; (ii) if the response to point (i) is in the affirmative, whether the letter attached as Appendix A to this Request satisfies that condition [\u2026]; and (iii) the Tribunal's method for calculating interest on the compensation awarded for the Vinto Tin Smelter\".1\n\nRequest for Interpretation, \u00b6 2.\n\n6.\n\nIn paragraph 470 of the Award, the Tribunal wrote:\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n7.\n\nHowever, no express condition was condition on the Respondent's payment of compensation was included in paragraph 564(f)(2) of the dispositive part of the Award. The Claimant therefore requests clarification of \"whether [the Claimant] is required to provide to Bolivia the written confirmations described in paragraph 470 [REDACTED] in order to trigger Bolivia's obligation to pay to Glencore Bermuda the compensation ordered in paragraph 564(f)(2).\"2\n\nRequest for Interpretation, \u00b6 5.\n\n8.\n\nIn the affirmative, the Claimant requests that the Tribunal confirm that the letter e [REDACTED] submitted as Appendix A to its Request for Interpretation satisfies the condition stipulated in paragraph 470 of the Award.3 Otherwise, the Claimant requests that the Tribunal specify what edits to the letter would be necessary to satisfy that condition.4\n\nRequest for Interpretation, \u00b6\u00b6 6-7.\n\nRequest for Interpretation, \u00b6 8.\n\n9.\n\nLastly, the Claimant requests that the Tribunal confirm the method of calculation of interest applied to the compensation for the Tin Smelter set forth in footnote 884 of the Award, where the Tribunal stated as follows:\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n10.\n\nSpecifically, the Claimant requests that the Tribunal \"clarify that the Tribunal calculated (i) interest on the fair market value of the Vinto Tin Smelter (US$ 33,750,192) from the date of valuation (8 February 2007) to [REDACTED] (2 July 2008), and (ii) interest on [REDACTED] US$ 5,150,192 [REDACTED] from 3 July 2008 to the date of the Award.\"6\n\nRequest for Interpretation, \u00b6 10.\n\n**B. The Respondent's Position**\n--------------------------------\n\n11.\n\nThe Respondent requests that the Tribunal dismiss the Claimant's Request for Interpretation \"insofar as it refers to the interest payable on the compensation awarded for the Vinto Tin Smelter.\"7 According to the Respondent, the request is not a \"proper request for interpretation in accordance with the UNCITRAL Rules but rather a belated attempt to introduce a new claim that [the Claimant] did not previously make in the arbitration.\"8\n\nRespondent's Response, p. 1.\n\nRespondent's Response, p. 1.\n\n12.\n\nThe Respondent argues that the Claimant's request constitutes a new claim \"disguise[d]\" as a request for interpretation, and consequently, the request should be dismissed.9 The Respondent explains that the Tribunal recognized that the damages for Bolivia's breaches relating to the Tin Smelter amounted to US$ 5.15 million (excluding interest), but that the Claimant \"seeks to inflate this figure by adding to its pre-award interest calculated in a manner that Glencore never proposed during the arbitration.\"10 Neither party, says the Respondent, requested that interest be calculated as described by the Claimant in its Request for Interpretation.11\n\nRespondent's Response, p. 2.\n\nRespondent's Response, pp. 2-3. [REDACTED]\n\nRespondent's Response, p. 3.\n\n13.\n\nAlternatively, the Respondent considers the Request for Interpretation \"at odds with the Tribunal's reasoning once the proper facts are considered.\"12 According to the Respondent, the Claimant \"has not 'suffered a loss of the use of money' that would require interest to be payable on the compensation awarded for the Vinto Tin Smelter in the manner it now claims.\"13 [REDACTED]\n\nRespondent's Response, p. 3.\n\nRespondent's Response, p. 4.\n\n**III. REQUEST FOR CORRECTION**\n-------------------------------\n\n**A. The Respondent's Position**\n--------------------------------\n\n14.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, the Award contains two errors in paragraph 564(f)-(g) regarding the computation of damages.15 First, the Respondent requests that paragraph 564(f) of the Award \"be corrected to indicate that the amounts [the Respondent] is ordered to pay thereunder are inclusive of pre-award interest, up to and including 8 September 2023\"16 and that paragraph 564(g) of the Award \"be corrected to indicate that [the Respondent] shall pay simple interest at the rate retained by the Tribunal on the amounts indicated in the prior paragraph, from the date of the Award.\"17 Second, the Respondent requests that paragraph 564(f) \"be corrected to indicate that damages to Claimant pertaining to the Tin Smelter (including pre-award interest) amount to US$ 5.15 million, instead of US$ 15.97 million\" and that the total amount of damages \"be corrected to US$ 242,771,796 [instead of US$ 253,591,796] to reflect the corrected value of damages pertaining to the Tin Smelter.\"18\n\nRequest for Correction, \u00b6 6.\n\nRequest for Correction, \u00b6 19.\n\nRequest for Correction, \u00b6 19.\n\nRequest for Correction, \u00b6\u00b6 6, 22-23.\n\n15.\n\nIn particular, with respect to the amount of compensation for the Tin Smelter, the Respondent states that it \"has been unable to replicate the Tribunal's conclusions as to the drivers of valuation of the Tin Smelter and its holding that Bolivia shall pay to Claimant US$ 15.97 million\".19 [REDACTED] On this basis, the Respondent asserts that the Joint Model for the Tin Smelter produces an amount of US$ 5.15 million instead of US$ 15.97 million.21 The Respondent notes that such an amount remains subject to the Tribunal's decision in paragraph 470 of the Award.22\n\nRequest for Correction, \u00b6 18.\n\nRequest for Correction, \u00b6 22.\n\nRequest for Correction, \u00b6\u00b6 21-23.\n\n**B. The Claimant's Position**\n------------------------------\n\n16.\n\nThe Claimant \"does not oppose Bolivia's Request that the Tribunal clarify that the compensation granted in paragraph 564(f) of the Award is inclusive of pre-award interest, and that the interest granted in paragraph 564(g) of the Award should be calculated from the date of the Award\".23 However, the Claimant \"requests that the Tribunal dismiss [the Respondent's] Request to reduce the compensation granted for the Vinto Tin Smelter from US$15.97 million to US$5.15 million as (i) an impermissible request that the Tribunal reconsider the merits of the compensation awarded or, in the alternative, (ii) unfounded because the Tribunal correctly calculated the compensation for the Vinto Tin Smelter\".24\n\nClaimant's Response, \u00b6\u00b6 2, 13.\n\nClaimant's Response, \u00b6 2.\n\n17.\n\nThe Claimant argues that the Respondent, in its request for correction of the amount of compensation for the Tin Smelter, is trying to \"reargue the merits of the Tribunal's Award\" against the rule provided in Article 38 of the UNCITRAL Rules, which only allows corrections of clerical or typographical errors and errors in the computation of damages.25 The Claimant submits that the Respondent's request \"is incompatible with the Tribunal's clear decision to include pre-award interest in the compensation for the Tin Smelter as stated in footnote 884 of the Award.\"26\n\nClaimant's Response, \u00b6\u00b6 2, 4-5.\n\nClaimant's Response, \u00b6\u00b6 2, 4-5.\n\n18.\n\nEven if the Respondent's request was admissible under Article 38 of the UNCITRAL Rules, the Claimant considers that the Tribunal correctly calculated the compensation for the Tin Smelter.27 According to the Claimant, the Tribunal explained in footnote 884 of the Award how it calculated interest on the amount for the Tin Smelter.28 The Claimant argues that it replicated the Tribunal's calculation method and reached the same result as the Tribunal (*i.e.*, US$ 15.97 million).29 The Respondent's request [REDACTED] says the Claimant, is in direct contradiction to the Tribunal's decision in footnote 884 of the Award and the Tribunal's instruction in paragraph 470 of the Award, [REDACTED]\n\nClaimant's Response, \u00b6\u00b6 2, 8.\n\nClaimant's Response, \u00b6 9.\n\nClaimant's Response, \u00b6 10.\n\n**IV. TRIBUNAL'S ANALYSIS**\n---------------------------\n\n19.\n\nThe Tribunal confirms that the Claimant's Request for Interpretation properly reflects the Tribunal's calculation of interest on compensation for the Tin Smelter in accordance with paragraph 470 and footnote 884 of the Award, leading to a final amount of compensation for the Tin Smelter of US$ 15.97 million. Thus, the Respondent's Request for Correction of the amount of compensation for the Tin Smelter is dismissed.\n\n20.\n\nWith respect to the Claimant's requests for interpretation regarding Respondent's obligation to pay the compensation pertaining to the Tin Smelter ordered in paragraph 564(f)(2) is subject to the condition stipulated in paragraph 470 of the Award [REDACTED] the Tribunal first notes that the Respondent did not submit any comments on the Claimant's further requests on this issue. The Tribunal accordingly confirms that the Respondent's obligation to pay the compensation pertaining to the Tin Smelter ordered in paragraph 564(f)(2) is subject to the condition stipulated in paragraph 470 of the Award. The Tribunal further confirms that the letter submitted by the Claimant as Appendix A to its Request for Interpretation (and annexed to this decision) has satisfied this requirement.33\n\nRequest for Interpretation, Appendix A.\n\n21.\n\nThe Tribunal also notes that there is agreement between the Parties as regards the corrections requested by the Respondent in order to clarify that the total amount of damages granted in paragraph 564(f) of the Award includes pre-award interest and that the interest granted in paragraph 564(g) of the Award should be calculated from the date of the Award. Thus, these requests are also accepted by the Tribunal.\n\n**V. DECISION**\n---------------\n\n22.\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, the Tribunal decides as follows:\n\na. The letter submitted by the Claimant as Appendix A to its Request for Interpretation (and annexed to this decision) has satisfied the condition stipulated in paragraph 470 of the Award.\n\nb. The following corrections are made to the Award:\n\n1. In paragraph 564(f), add \"(including pre-award interest up to and including 8 September 2023)\", such that this paragraph shall read as follows:\n\nf) As a result of the Respondent's breaches, Bolivia shall pay to the Claimant damages amounting to US$ 253,591,796 (including pre-award interest up to and including 8 September 2023), consisting of the following elements: [...].\"\n\n2. In paragraph 564(g), add \"from the date of the award\" in place of \"as of the respective valuation dates for the Assets\", such that this paragraph shall read as follows:\n\ng) The Respondent shall also pay simple interest on the damages awarded for the Colquiri Mine, the Tin Smelter, the Antimony Smelter and the Tin Stock at fixed rates established by the Central Bank of Bolivia for commercial loans denominated in US dollars from the date of the award and up to the date of payment.\n\nc.
