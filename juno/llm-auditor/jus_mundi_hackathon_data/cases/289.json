INTRODUCTION AND PARTIES**\n-------------------------------\n\n1.\n\nThis case concerns a dispute submitted to the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (\"ICSID\" or the \"Centre\") on the basis of the Agreement between the Government of the Hellenic Republic and the Government of the Czech and Slovak Federal Republic for the Promotion and Reciprocal Protection of Investments dated June 3, 1991 (the \"Slovakia-Greece BIT\"), the Agreement between the Government of the Hellenic Republic and the Government of the Republic of Cyprus on the Mutual Promotion and Protection of Investments dated March 30, 1992 (the \"Cyprus-Greece BIT\") and the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States, which entered into force on October 14, 1966 (the \"ICSID Convention\" or \" Washington Convention\").\n\n2.\n\nThe Claimants are Po\u0161tov\u00e1 banka, a.s. (\"Po\u0161tov\u00e1 banka\"), a Slovak bank, and Istrokapital SE (\"Istrokapital\"), a European Public Limited Liability Company, organized under the laws of Cyprus (collectively \"Claimants\"). Istrokapital holds shares in Po\u0161tov\u00e1 banka.1\n\nIn their Memorial on the Merits and Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, Claimants explained that in late 2011, Istrokapital and J&T Finance began discussing the possibility of Istrokapital selling its majority stake in Po\u0161tov\u00e1 banka to J&T Finance. These discussions culminated in the transfer of interest in Po\u0161tov\u00e1 banka from Istrokapital to J&T Finance effective from July 1, 2013. C-Mem., \u00b6 77; Tarda Witness Statement, \u00b6 3.\n\n3.\n\nClaimants are represented by Mr. David W. Rivkin and Ms. Samantha Rowe of the law firm of Debevoise & Plimpton LLP, New York, NY, USA and Mr. Marek Voj\u00e1cek, Mr. Dusan Sedl\u00e1cek, Mr. Petr Briza of the law firm of Havel, Hol\u00e1sek & Partners s.r.o., Prague, Czech Republic.\n\n4.\n\nRespondent is the Hellenic Republic (the \"Respondent\" or \"Greece\").\n\n5.\n\nRespondent is represented by Ms. Styliani Charitaki and Ms. Emmanuela Panopoulou, Members of the Legal Council of the State, Athens, Greece, and Dr. Claudia Annacker and Mr. Christopher Moore of the law firm of Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton LLP, Paris, France and London, U.K.\n\n6.\n\nClaimants and the Respondent are hereinafter collectively referred to as the \"Parties.\"\n\n**II. PROCEDURAL HISTORY**\n--------------------------\n\n7.\n\nOn May 3, 2013, ICSID received a Request for Arbitration dated May 2, 2013 from Claimants (the \"Request\"). Following an enquiry by the ICSID Secretariat, Claimants supplemented the Request with a letter dated May 17, 2013.\n\n8.\n\nOn May 20, 2013, the Secretary-General of ICSID registered the Request in accordance with Article 36(3) of the ICSID Convention and notified the Parties of the registration. In the Notice of Registration, the Secretary-General invited the Parties to proceed to constitute an arbitral tribunal as soon as possible in accordance with Rule 7(d) of the Centre's Rules of Procedure for the Institution of Conciliation and Arbitration Proceedings.\n\n9.\n\nOn June 6, 2013, Respondent notified the Centre that it accepted Claimants' proposal in the Request concerning the number of arbitrators and method of constituting the Tribunal. The Parties thus agreed to constitute the arbitral tribunal in accordance with Article 37(2)(a) of the ICSID Convention. Under their agreement, the Tribunal would consist of three members: one arbitrator to be appointed by each party and the third arbitrator, the President of the Tribunal, to be appointed by agreement of the Parties. Failing such agreement, the President would be appointed by the Secretary-General of ICSID.\n\n10.\n\nOn June 20, 2013, Claimants appointed as arbitrator Mr. John M. Townsend, a national of the United States, who accepted his appointment on June 26, 2013.\n\n11.\n\nOn July 29, 2013, Respondent appointed Professor Brigitte Stern, a national of France, as arbitrator. She accepted her appointment on July 31, 2013.\n\n12.\n\nOn September 6, 2013, the Parties informed the Secretary-General of ICSID that they were unable to reach an agreement on the appointment of the President of the Tribunal. In accordance with their agreement, the Parties requested that the Secretary-General appoint the presiding arbitrator in consultation with the Parties.\n\n13.\n\nOn September 9, 2013, the Secretary-General invited the Parties to submit their views on the qualifications, experience and profile of potential candidates. By the same letter, the Secretary-General proposed the following list-ranking procedure for appointing the President:\n\ni. The Secretary-General will send a list of seven to ten candidates and requests that the Parties rank these candidates in order of preference [e.g. first choice, second choice, third choice, etc.] with the first choice being the most-preferred candidate. Each rank can only be used once. The Parties may veto the appointment of one candidate on the list.\n\nii. Each party will complete its ranking within seven business days and return it to ICSID by email without copying the opposing party.\n\niii. ICSID will appoint the candidate with the least number of points to act as the President of the Tribunal. If any candidates are tied with the lowest number of points, ICSID will select the President from one of those candidates.\n\n14.\n\nBy letters of September 11, 13 and 16, 2013, the Parties agreed to the list-ranking procedure proposed by the Secretary-General and submitted their views on the qualifications, experience and profile of potential candidates.\n\n15.\n\nOn September 26, 2013, the Secretary-General proposed ten candidates to the Parties. The Parties submitted their rankings on October 7, 2013.\n\n16.\n\nOn October 7, 2013, the Secretary-General informed the Parties that ICSID would proceed with the appointment of Mr. Eduardo Zuleta, the candidate with the least number of points, to act as President of the Tribunal. Mr. Zuleta accepted his appointment on October 21, 2013.\n\n17.\n\nOn October 21, 2013, the Secretary-General, in accordance with Rule 6(1) of the ICSID Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings (\"Arbitration Rules\") notified the Parties that all three arbitrators had accepted their appointments and that the Tribunal was therefore deemed to have been constituted on that date. Ms. Martina Polasek, Team Leader/Legal Counsel, ICSID, was designated to serve as Secretary of the Tribunal.\n\n18.\n\nOn December 17, 2013, the Tribunal held a first session with the Parties by telephone conference. The Parties' agreements and the Tribunal's determinations on the procedural matters discussed at the first session were recorded in Procedural Order No. 1 of December 20, 2013.\n\n19.\n\nAmong other things, it was agreed that the applicable Arbitration Rules would be those in effect from April 10, 2006, that the procedural language would be English, that the place of proceeding would be Washington, D.C. and that any ruling issued in the proceeding would be published. The Parties further agreed that production of documents would be governed by Article 3 of the *International Bar Association Rules on the Taking of Evidence in International Arbitration (2010)*, except where inconsistent with Procedural Order No. 1 or any later order of the Tribunal, in which case, the orders of this Tribunal would prevail. Following the Parties' agreement to bifurcate jurisdiction from the merits, a procedural schedule on jurisdiction was established.\n\n20.\n\nAfter the issuance of Procedural Order No. 1, the Parties filed proposals for a proceeding on the merits following a potential Decision on Jurisdiction. On January 9, 2014, considering the Parties' proposals, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 2 adopting a procedural calendar for a possible proceeding on the merits.\n\n21.\n\nOn January 17, 2014, in accordance with Procedural Order No. 1, Respondent filed a request for the Tribunal to decide on its request for production of documents. Respondent's Redfern Schedule contained Claimants' objections to production and Respondent's response to the objections. On January 21, 2014, following a request granted by the Tribunal, Claimants filed further comments on the Respondent's requests for production.\n\n22.\n\nOn January 22, 2014, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 3 ordering Claimants to produce certain documents requested in Respondent's Redfern Schedule. On January 23, 2014, Claimants confirmed that they would produce certain documents but that they would not be able to produce the remaining documents within the set time frame given the broad scope of the documents ordered for production.\n\n23.\n\nOn March 5, 2014, the Parties submitted a joint proposal for an amended procedural calendar, which was adopted by the Tribunal in Procedural Order No. 4 of March 6, 2014.\n\n24.\n\nOn April 30, 2014, Claimants requested the Tribunal's assistance in resolving an urgent document production dispute between the Parties. They also requested that Respondent be ordered to destroy or return a confidential document that had been produced inadvertently.\n\n25.\n\nOn May 1, 2014, Respondent filed its Memorial on Jurisdiction. On the same day, Respondent notified the Tribunal that it would refrain from submitting or relying on the disputed or related documents identified by the Claimants in their letter of April 30, 2014, pending resolution of the matter by the Tribunal.\n\n26.\n\nThe Parties exchanged further correspondence concerning the documents at issue. On May 23, 2014, the Centre informed the Parties that the Tribunal had received sufficient information on the matter and did not require any further submissions.\n\n27.\n\nOn May 27, 2014, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 5, deferring the decision on the relevant documents until after the filing of Claimants' Memorial on the Merits and Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction. It ordered that Respondent return the main document to Claimants no later than May 30, 2014, without prejudice to the possibility of Respondent requesting the disclosure of the document and related documents in another document production phase, due to start on July 1, 2014.\n\n28.\n\nOn June 17, 2014, Claimants filed their Memorial on the Merits and Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, together with the witness statements of Messrs. Marek Tarda and Ladislav Timiul'ak and an expert opinion by Professor Ren\u00e9 M. Stulz.\n\n29.\n\nOn July 1, 2014, Respondent renewed its request for the Tribunal to order the production of the previously disputed documents. On July 8, 2014, Claimants objected to Respondent's second request, arguing that the documents were confidential and protected by attorney-client privilege. The Parties exchanged further communications on these matters by letters of July 11 and 17, 2014.\n\n30.\n\nOn July 20, 2014, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 6 concerning Respondent's second request for production of documents. It granted some of the requests for production and denied others, as detailed in a Redfern Schedule attached to the Order.\n\n31.\n\nOn July 21, 2014, Respondent requested clarifications from the Tribunal with respect to Procedural Order No. 6, which the Tribunal provided in a decision of July 23, 2014 entitled \"Clarification to Procedural Order No. 6.\"\n\n32.\n\nOn August 15, 2014, Respondent filed its Reply on Jurisdiction, together with expert reports of Professor R. Glen Hubbard and Professor Ray Ball.\n\n33.\n\nOn August 20, 2014, Claimants requested leave to submit a reply expert report of Professor Ren\u00e9 M. Stultz, a reply witness statement of Mr. Marek Tarda as well as a number of new exhibits. Claimants argued that Respondent had delayed the submission of its expert evidence until its Reply on Jurisdiction in order to deny Claimants an opportunity to respond.\n\n34.\n\nOn August 21, 2014, the Tribunal held a pre-hearing organizational meeting with the Parties and, on August 22, 2014, issued Procedural Order No. 7 concerning the outstanding procedural, administrative and logistical matters in preparation for the Hearing on jurisdiction. By the same order, the Tribunal decided on Claimants' request of August 20, 2014, rejecting Claimants' request to file a supplemental witness statement and expert report.\n\n35.\n\nA Hearing on jurisdiction took place in Washington, D.C. on September 8 and 9, 2014. In addition to the Members of the Tribunal and the Secretary of the Tribunal, present at the Hearing were:\n\nFor the Claimants:\n\nMr. David Rivkin Debevoise & Plimpton LLP\n\nMs. Samantha Rowe Debevoise & Plimpton LLP\n\nMr. Clay Kaminsky Debevoise & Plimpton LLP\n\nMs. Nwamaka Ejebe Debevoise & Plimpton LLP\n\nMs. JoAnna Tsoumpas Debevoise & Plimpton LLP\n\nMs. Jennifer Lim Debevoise & Plimpton LLP\n\nMr. Dusan Sedl\u00e1cek Havel, Hol\u00e1sek & Partners s.r.o.\n\nMr. Jan Nosko Po\u0161tov\u00e1 banka\n\nFor the Respondent:\n\nDr. Claudia Annacker Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton LLP\n\nMr. Christopher Moore Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton LLP\n\nMs. Styliani Charitaki Legal Council of the State, Hellenic\n\nRepublic\n\nMs. Emmanuela Panopoulou Legal Council of the State, Hellenic\n\nRepublic\n\nMr. David Sabel Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton LLP\n\nDr. Enik\u00f3 Horv\u00e1th Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton LLP\n\nMs. Laurie Achtouk-Spivak Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton LLP\n\nMr. Konrad Rodgers Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton LLP\n\nMr. Paul Barker Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton LLP\n\nMs. Mayar Dahabieh Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton LLP\n\nMr. Jacob Turner Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton LLP\n\n36.\n\nThe following persons were examined:\n\nOn behalf of the Claimants:\n\nMr. Marek Tarda Po\u0161tov\u00e1 banka\n\nProfessor Ren\u00e9 M. Stulz Ohio State University\n\nOn behalf of the Respondent:\n\nProfessor R. Glenn Hubbard Dean, Columbia Business School\n\nProfessor Raymond Ball Sidney Davidson Distinguished Service\n\nProfessor of Accounting, Chicago Booth School of Business\n\n37.\n\nBy letters of October 24 and 26, 2014, the Parties disputed the translations of exhibits R-149 and R-150 and the redactions to Procedural Orders Nos. 5 and 6 and Clarification to Procedural Order No. 6, which were requested by one of the Parties before the publication of those orders.\n\n38.\n\nOn October 31 and November 6, 2014, Claimants and the Respondent filed their respective Statements on Costs.\n\n39.\n\nOn November 4 and 10, 2014, the Parties filed additional submissions on the translation and redaction issues. On November 12, 2014, the Tribunal decided to allow the Claimants to submit their own translations of exhibits R-149 and R-150. Additionally, the Tribunal ordered the publication on the ICSID website of redacted versions of Procedural Orders No. 5 and 6 and Clarification to Procedural Order No. 6.\n\n40.\n\nOn November 18, 2014, in accordance with the Tribunal's directions of November 12, 2014, Claimants submitted exhibits C-210 and C-211, as their translations of exhibits R-149 and R-150.\n\n41.\n\nOn December 1, 2014, the Tribunal informed the Parties that it continued to engage in deliberations.\n\n42.\n\nOn April 9, 2015, the Tribunal informed the Parties that the proceeding was closed and that the Award would be rendered on that date.\n\n43.\n\nThe Tribunal has conducted its deliberations in person and by various modes of communication among its Members and in issuing this Award has taken into account all written submissions and oral arguments of the Parties. The fact that a particular reasoning, document or legal authority is not referred to in the following sections does not mean that it has not been considered by the Tribunal.\n\n**III. FACTUAL BACKGROUND**\n---------------------------\n\n44.\n\nThe following section recalls the factual background of this dispute. As a preliminary matter, the Tribunal notes that in this arbitration Claimants asserted that their rights derive from the ownership by Po\u0161tov\u00e1 banka of Greek Government Bonds (\"GGBs\"),2 whereas Respondent referred to such purchases by Po\u0161tov\u00e1 banka as \"interests in GGBs.\"3 In light of the Tribunal's decision, this distinction is not determinative. The Tribunal will thus refer to GGBs and interests in GGBs (or GGB interests) indistinctly in this decision.\n\nC-Mem., \u00b6 3.\n\nRep., \u00b6 188.\n\n***The Greek Financial Crisis***\n--------------------------------\n\n45.\n\nThe Hellenic Republic has been a Member State of the European Union (\"EU\") and the Euro Area since 2001.\n\n46.\n\nDue to the global financial crisis of 2008, Greece experienced a significant economic downturn.4 In 2009, rating agencies downgraded Greek debt, given, among other factors, the country's public debt burden.5 Among the obligations of the Greek Government that were downgraded were five series of Greek Government Bonds, held at various times by Po\u0161tov\u00e1 banka, as described below.\n\nMem., \u00b6\u00b6 23-27.\n\nMem., \u00b6 26; R-4; R-5; Rep. \u00b6 27.\n\n47.\n\nOn January 15, 2010, Greece submitted to the European Commission a three-year stability program to reduce its fiscal deficit within the EU limit, which was adopted by the European Commission on February 3, 2010 and was supported by the Heads of State and Government of the EU. This program was followed by the adoption of austerity measures by Greece on March 3, 2010.6\n\nMem., \u00b6\u00b6 28-29.\n\n48.\n\nOn April 11, 2010, the Euro Area Member States agreed on financial support for the Hellenic Republic and the International Monetary Fund (\"IMF\") contributed additional funds in order to secure the financial stability of the Euro Area. The activation of this mechanism was formally requested on April 23, 2010.\n\n49.\n\nOn April 27, 2010, Standard & Poor's lowered Greece's long-term credit rating from BBB+ to BB+.7 European Union and Greek leaders affirmed that restructuring was not on the table.8\n\nC-Mem., \u00b6 48; C-95.\n\nC-93; C-96.\n\n50.\n\nLater, on May 2, 2010, an adjustment program was launched to increase financial support to Greece, conditioned upon the implementation of fiscal, financial and structural measures, set out in a Memorandum of Economic and Fiscal Policies of May 3, 2010, agreed with the IMF, the Eurogroup, the European Commission and the European Central Bank.9\n\nMem., \u00b6\u00b6 31-34.\n\n***Po\u0161tov\u00e1 Banka\u2019s Interests in GGBs***\n---------------------------------------\n\n51.\n\nWhile these events were unfolding, Po\u0161tov\u00e1 banka purchased in early 2010 a number of GGBs issued by the Hellenic Republic between 2007 and 2010. The bonds purchased by Po\u0161tov\u00e1 banka belonged to five series of GGBs, all of which were governed by Greek law:\n\n\u2022 **ISIN GR0114020457,** issued on March 2, 2007 pursuant to Ministerial Decision 2/13482/0023A of February 27, 2007, with an interest rate of 4.1% and maturing on 20 August 2012.10\n\n\u2022 **ISIN GR0114021463**, issued on March 26, 2008 pursuant to Ministerial Decision 2/20947/0023A of March 18, 2008, with an interest rate of 4% and maturing on 20 August 2013.11\n\n\u2022 **ISIN GR0110021236**, issued on February 17, 2009 pursuant to Ministerial Decision 2/11184/0023A of February 13, 2009, with an interest rate of 4.3% and maturing on 20 March 2012.12\n\n\u2022 **ISIN GR0114023485**, issued on February 2, 2010 pursuant to Ministerial Decision 2/6276/0023A of January 29, 2010, with an interest rate of 6.1% and maturing on 20 August 2015.13\n\n\u2022 **ISIN GR0124032666**, issued on March 11, 2010 pursuant to Ministerial Decision 2/14140/0023A of March 9, 2010, with an interest rate of 6.25% and maturing on 19 June 2020.14\n\nR-98 Ministerial Decision.\n\nR-99 Ministerial Decision.\n\nR-97 Ministerial Decision; R-111 Offering Circular.\n\nR-100 Ministerial Decision; R-112 Offering Circular.\n\nR-101 Ministerial Decision; R-110 Offering Circular.\n\n52.\n\nThese GGBs were issued by the Hellenic Republic by syndication or auction to 22 \"primary dealers\"; that is, financial institutions appointed on a yearly basis by joint decision of the Minister of Economy and Finance and the Governor of the Bank of Greece in order to provide specialized services in the government securities market.15 GGBs were dematerialized securities.16\n\nR-103, Article 1.\n\n*See* R-108, Articles 5 and 6.\n\n53.\n\nLaw 2198 of 1994 created the System for Monitoring Transactions in a Book-entry Securities (\"System\"), administered by the Bank of Greece in order to monitor the loans on behalf of the Government of Greece.17 In accordance with Article 6 of Law 2198 of 1994, aside from the Greek Government and the Bank of Greece, \"(...) *legal* *or natural persons (Participants) defined either by category or by name are eligible for* *membership in the System, subject to approval by the a Bank of Greece Governor's Act (sic).* \"18 Participants in the System are the only ones who can hold titles to GGBs, yet securities acquired by Participants may be transferred to third parties (defined in the Law as \"investors\").19 A Participant is required to have two types of accounts, one for its customer portfolio and the other for its own account. Payments made to Greece on account of GGBs were only made by Participants as the system was envisioned as one of \"delivery versus payment.\"20\n\nR-108, Article 5.\n\nR-108, Article 6.1.\n\nR-108, Article 6.2.\n\nR-109, Section 1, p. 8.\n\n54.\n\nThe GGBs were issued by the Greek Government through the Bank of Greece System to the Participants in the System. Participants deliver the bonds to the Primary Dealers, which ultimately provide the funds for the acquisition by Participants, and in turn, sell the GGBs on the secondary market. The distribution of bonds occurred electronically through universal depositories, such as Clearstream.21\n\nHubbard Report, \u00b6 44 and Cross Examination of Professor Stulz at Hearing, Tr., 369:6-371:4. *See also* : R-103; R-108 and R-109.\n\n55.\n\nThe initial distribution process is completed once the Primary Dealers distributed the interests in the GGBs into the secondary market, which usually happened within one or two days of their issuance.22\n\nHearing, Tr., 13:14-18; Hubbard Report, \u00b6 52.\n\n56.\n\nPo\u0161tov\u00e1 banka used capital from consumer deposits to acquire \u20ac504,000,000 aggregate face principal amount of GGBs interests through a series of transactions between January 8, 2010 and April 23, 2010.23\n\nMem., \u00b6 69; C-Mem., \u00b6 38; Tarda Witness Statement, \u00b6 8.\n\n57.\n\nThe series of GGBs in which Po\u0161tov\u00e1 banka acquired interests were governed by Greek law and matured at various dates between March 20, 2012 and June 19, 2020.

Therefore we welcome the current discussion between Greece and its private investors to find a solution for a deeper PSI. Together with an ambitious reform programme for the Greek economy, the PSI should secure the decline of the Greek debt to GDP ratio with an objective of reaching 120% by 2020. To this end we invite Greece, private investors and all parties concerned to develop a voluntary bond exchange with a nominal discount of 50% on national Greek debt held by private investors. The Euro zone Member States would contribute to the PSI package up to 30 bn euro. On that basis, the official sector stands ready to provide additional programme financing of up to 100 bn euro until 2014, including required recapitalisation of Greek banks. The new programme should be agreed by the end of 2011 and the exchange of bonds should be implemented at the beginning of 2012.

Bonds classified as HFT are acquired principally for resale in the near term; they are carried in a bank's books at market prices and reflected in the bank's profit and loss statement. HTM bonds reflect the intent of the owner to hold them until maturity; they are carried at amortized costs so that market fluctuations do not affect their value. Except in limited circumstances, if bonds classified as HMT are sold or reclassified, all other assets in the HMT portfolio would have to be reclassified as AFS and remain in the AFS portfolio for the next two years.52 Bonds classified as AFS are carried at their market price and can be sold prior to their maturity.53\n\nC-107, \u00b6 9 and \u00b6 32; Tarda Witness Statement, \u00b6 10.\n\nTarda Witness Statement, \u00b6 9.\n\n78.\n\nInitially, most of these interests in GGBs were classified in Po\u0161tov\u00e1 banka's AFS portfolio.54 The vast majority of these interests were reclassified on April 1, 2010 from AFS to HTM.55\n\nC-Mem., \u00b6 44.\n\nMem., \u00b6\u00b6 69-70.\n\n79.\n\nUnder the international accounting rules applicable to debt and equity investments, GGBs could have also been classified in the HFT portfolio, where they are held for short-term trading.

Later on, Po\u0161tov\u00e1 banka purchased GGB interests of the same series and in the same principal amounts, though for different prices.58\n\nMem., \u00b6\u00b6 73-75.\n\n***The Agreements Concerning Po\u0161tov\u00e1 Banka\u2019s Interests in GGBs***\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n82.\n\nIn October 2011, the National Bank of Slovakia (\"NBS\"), in its capacity as regulator of Slovak banks, requested a meeting with Po\u0161tov\u00e1 banka to discuss the \" *development of the financial situation of Po\u0161tov\u00e1 Banka in 2011 as regards the Bank's exposure to Greek government bonds.* \" One of the alternatives presented by Po\u0161tov\u00e1 banka was to transfer the risk from part of the GGBs portfolio to a shareholder of Po\u0161tov\u00e1 banka or to another person.59\n\nR-146, p. 2.\n\n83.\n\nOn December 22, 2011, Istrokapital (Po\u0161tov\u00e1 banka's majority shareholder) and J&T Finance, a.s., (\"J&T Finance\"), a company incorporated under the laws of the Czech Republic, signed a Framework Share Purchase Agreement (\"FSPA\") specifying the terms for the acquisition by J&T Finance of Istrokapital's shares in Po\u0161tov\u00e1 banka. J&T Finance and Istrokapital agreed that, notwithstanding the sale of shares, the risk associated with the GGBs would be ultimately borne by Istrokapital.60 Under the FSPA, Istrokapital remained responsible for ensuring Po\u0161tov\u00e1 banka's capital adequacy in case it were affected by a situation with the GGBs and Istrokapital assumed also the obligation to compensate J&T Finance if the return on the value of the GGBs did not reach the acquisition cost.61\n\nC-Mem., \u00b6 78.\n\nC-Mem., \u00b6 79; R-80, FSPA, Articles 6.3 and 6.4.\n\n84.\n\nOn December 23, 2011, Po\u0161tov\u00e1 banka and J&T Finance entered into two assignment agreements, whereby Po\u0161tov\u00e1 banka assigned \"Part of the Receivable\" to J&T Finance (the \"Assignment Agreements\"). The \"Receivable\" was an amount of the principal and interest of GGBs that Po\u0161tov\u00e1 banka then held, to be determined according to Greece's level of payment of the interests in GGBs to Po\u0161tov\u00e1 banka, either on the effective due date of the GGBs or on any earlier date on which they were paid.62\n\nThe subject of the Assignment Agreements is the obligation of the Assignor to assign to the Assignee \"Part of Receivable\" and the obligation of the Assignee to pay the Assignor recompense for assigning Part of the Receivable. \"Part of the Receivable\" is defined in the corresponding agreement on the basis of payment received by Postova banka on the due date of the receivable. Three events were envisioned by the parties: (a) If on the Due Date, the Hellenic Republic does not pay the Receivable even partially, then Part of the Receivable means the right to be paid part of the Principal in the amount of 50% together with the right to be paid part of the Interest in the amount of 50%; (b) If on the Due Date, the Hellenic Republic pays the Receivable partially, but the payment is lower than or equal to 50% of the value of the Receivable, then Part of the Receivable means the right to be paid the unpaid part of the Principal in the amount of 50% together with the right to be paid part of the Interest in the amount of 50%; (c) If, on the Due Date, the Hellenic Republic pays the Receivable partially and the payment is higher than 50% of the value of the Receivable, then Part of the Receivable means the right to be paid the entire unpaid part of the Principal and the unpaid Interest. *See* R-149 and R-150, Articles I and II.\n\n85.\n\nIn turn, J&T Finance would compensate Po\u0161tov\u00e1 banka for assigning such receivables in the amount of their nominal value. In addition, J&T Finance would deposit funds in Po\u0161tov\u00e1 banka under related deposit agreements dated December 23, 2011 (the \"Deposit Agreements\"). These funds were not to be used by J&T Finance during the term of the commitment (i.e, from the date of deposit until August 27, 2012), and would be paid to J&T Finance upon the expiry of the term.63 On the day of expiry of the term of commitment, Po\u0161tov\u00e1 banka would pay the Deposit and interest thereon in the amount of 7.5% to J&T Finance.\n\n*See* R-153, Article II, 1, b and Article III, 1, b; R-154, Article II, 1, b and Article III.\n\n86.\n\nOn December 23, 2011, J&T Finance and Istrokapital entered into two assignment agreements pursuant to which J&T Finance would assign to Istrokapital Part of the Receivable previously assigned by Po\u0161tov\u00e1 banka to J&T Finance. Once they were assigned to J&T Finance, Istrokapital would in turn pay compensation in the amount of the nominal value of the Part of the Receivable that was assigned to it. Istrokapital's obligation to recompense is set off by J&T's obligation to credit Istrokapital, pursuant to the credit agreement previously entered into between these two parties. These agreements would become effective on the effective date of the Assignment Agreements.64\n\n*See* R-155, Article X.2 and R-156 Article X.2.\n\n87.\n\nThe Assignment Agreements were later amended by an agreement of the Parties in mid February 2012 in order to replace the definition of \"Part of the Receivable.\"65 The amended assignment agreements increased the amounts of the \"Part of the Receivable\" to be paid pursuant to the Assignment Agreements. Po\u0161tov\u00e1 banka and J&T Finance entered into further deposit agreements on account of the amendments to the Assignment Agreements.\n\n*See* R-151, Article I, II and R-152, Article I, II.\n\n88.\n\nOn March 8, 2012, Istrokapital, J&T Finance and Po\u0161tov\u00e1 banka entered into an \"Agreement on a Deposit into Other Equity Accounts and on Settlement of Obligations\" (the \"Settlement Agreement\").66 The Settlement Agreement provides that it cancels and extinguishes all obligations of Po\u0161tov\u00e1 banka and J&T Finance under the Assignment Agreements as of the entry into effect of the Settlement Agreement.67 The four Deposit Agreements entered into between Po\u0161tov\u00e1 banka and J&T Finance were terminated early and Po\u0161tov\u00e1 banka would not reimburse J&T Finance the deposits and accessions. Also, J&T Finance assigned the right to receive repayment of the deposits made with Po\u0161tov\u00e1 banka to Istrokapital and Istrokapital would make an equity deposit corresponding to the repayment of the deposit to Po\u0161tov\u00e1 banka and set off this contribution against receivables assigned by J&T Finance.\n\n*See* R-171.\n\nR-171, Article I.\n\n89.\n\nThe Settlement Agreement required three conditions to enter into effect: (i) the delivery of a notification by Clearstream stating that new issues of Greek bonds had been credited to Po\u0161tov\u00e1 banka's account; (ii) a decision by Po\u0161tov\u00e1 banka's Board of Directors, and (iii) prior consent of Po\u0161tov\u00e1 banka's Supervisory Board.68\n\nR-171, Article V.2.\n\n90.\n\nOn the same date, J&T Finance and Istrokapital also entered into a Settlement Agreement pursuant to which J&T Finance assigned the receivables it had against Po\u0161tov\u00e1 banka to Istrokapital, which in turn agreed to pay compensation to J&T Finance for the amounts deposited in Po\u0161tov\u00e1 banka.\n\n**IV. OBJECTIONS TO JURISDICTION**\n----------------------------------\n\n91.\n\nRespondent submitted the following jurisdictional objections:\n\ni. The Tribunal lacks jurisdiction *ratione materiae* because (a) Po\u0161tov\u00e1 banka's interests in GGBs are not protected investments under the Slovakia-Greece BIT and the ICSID Convention; and (b) Istrokapital never made an investment protected under the Cyprus-Greece BIT or the ICSID Convention.69\n\nii. The Tribunal lacks jurisdiction *ratione temporis* and/or the claims should be dismissed on grounds of abuse of process.70\n\niii. The Tribunal lacks jurisdiction *ratione personae* over Istrokapital because (a) Istrokapital is not a \"National of Another Contracting State\" under Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention; and (b) Istrokapital is not a protected investor under the Cyprus-Greece BIT.71\n\niv. The Tribunal lacks jurisdiction over Claimants' umbrella clause claims and/or Claimants have failed to establish *prima facie* those claims.72\n\nMem., \u00b6\u00b6 103-173; Rep., \u00b6\u00b6 152-281.\n\nMem., \u00b6\u00b6 174-194; Rep., \u00b6\u00b6 282-322.\n\nMem., \u00b6\u00b6 195-231; Rep., \u00b6\u00b6 323-357.\n\nMem., \u00b6\u00b6 232-239; Rep., \u00b6\u00b6 358-397.\n\n92.\n\nIn their Memorial on Merits and Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, Claimants submitted both their responses to Respondent's jurisdictional objections and their arguments on the merits. Since this decision will solely address the Tribunal's jurisdiction, Claimants' arguments on the merits will not be summarized below.\n\n93.\n\nThe Parties extensively discussed the jurisdictional objections in their written submissions and during the Hearing. Following is a summary of the position of the Parties with respect to each such jurisdictional objection.\n\n**V. POSITION OF THE PARTIES**\n------------------------------\n\n**1. The Tribunal Lacks Jurisdiction** ***Ratione Materiae***\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**a. Respondent's Position**\n----------------------------\n\n***Po\u0161tov\u00e1 Banka Does Not Have a Protected Investment***\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n94.\n\nPo\u0161tov\u00e1 banka's GGB interests are not protected investments under the Slovakia-Greece BIT and the ICSID Convention.\n\n95.\n\nAccording to Respondent, Po\u0161tov\u00e1 banka's interests in GGBs are not protected investments under Article 1(1) of the Slovakia-Greece BIT and do not qualify as investments under Article 25 of the ICSID Convention. Claimants conflate GGBs with interests in GGBs73: Po\u0161tov\u00e1 banka never held GGBs and it was never a Participant in the System; instead it acquired a stake in a pool of freely negotiable, fungible interests by Clearstream in secondary market transactions.74 As a holder of GGB interests, Po\u0161tov\u00e1 banka was in contractual privity with Clearstream and not with the Hellenic Republic.75\n\nIn its Reply on Jurisdiction, Greece points to the differences between GGBs and GGB interests: GGBs are issued by the Hellenic Republic and purchased by Participants in the System, where they are held. Participants are the only holders of GGBs and they are in contractual privity with the Hellenic Republic. The price of GGBs is determined solely at the time of the bond issuance. GGB interests, in turn, are created by Participants and purchased by Primary Dealers who sell them in the secondary market. Holders of GGB interests do not participate in the BoG system and they are in contractual privity with the International Clearing System accounts where interests are deposited. The price of GGB interests and its inherent risks may change fundamentally as they are traded. *See* Rep., \u00b6 188.\n\nMem., \u00b6\u00b6 103-104; Rep., \u00b6\u00b6 187-190.\n\nRep., \u00b6 188\n\n96.\n\nRespondent holds that in order for the Tribunal to have jurisdiction *ratione materiae*, Claimants must establish the existence of an investment both under the Slovakia-Greece BIT and the ICSID Convention for, as stated in *Phoenix v. Czech Republic*, \"ICSID's tribunal's jurisdiction *ratione materiae* \u2018rests on the intersection of the two definitions.'\"76\n\nMem., \u00b6 110. Citing to *Phoenix Action, LTD. v. Czech Republic,* ICSID Case No. ARB/06/5, Award of April 15, 2009 (\" *Phoenix v. Czech Republic* \").\n\n97.\n\nGreece considers that the term \u2018investment' in Article 25 (1) of the ICSID Convention has an objective meaning that cannot be expanded or derogated by agreement between the Parties.77 A long line of ICSID cases, subject to minor variations, has established four cumulative criteria to determine whether an investment was made for the purposes of Article 25 (1) of the Convention78: *\"(i) a contribution in money or other assets, (ii) a significant duration, (iii) an element of risk, and (iv) a contribution to the economic development of the host State or an operation made in order to develop an economic* *activity in the host State.\"*79 The last requirement has been considered implicit in the other three elements by certain tribunals.80\n\nMem., \u00b6 111; Rep., \u00b6 173.\n\nRep., \u00b6 178.\n\nMem., \u00b6 112.\n\nMem., \u00b6 112 and \u00b6 120.\n\n98.\n\nGreece considers that contrary to Claimants' assertions, debt instruments do not automatically meet these criteria.81 This assessment shall be made on a case-by-case basis.82 Further, Respondent states that in none of the cases cited by Claimants for the proposition that investment should be understood in a broad manner, the tribunals dispensed with the analysis of whether the alleged investment met certain criteria pertaining to the objective definition of investment.83 Particularly, Respondent highlights that in *Fedax v. Venezuela,*84 the tribunal stressed that the promissory notes at issue were not volatile capital and that the decisions in *Abaclat v. Argentina*85 and *Ambiente Ufficio v.

Uzbekistan*90 and *Alps Finance v. Slovak Republic,*91 Respondent asserts that assets listed under Article 1 (1) of the Slovakia-Greece BIT cannot be deemed as investments if they do not satisfy the objective requirements mentioned above.92 Further, Respondent distinguishes a bond from a loan in so far as loans imply contractual privity and are usually tied to a specific operation or to an underlying investment in the host State.93\n\nMem., \u00b6 113.\n\nMem., \u00b6\u00b6 113-114.\n\n*Romak S.A.

Claimants bear the burden of proving that the State parties to the BIT ascribed a special meaning to the term investment that deviates from the ordinary meaning of the term in its context, as indicated by Article 31(1) of the VCLT, and they have failed to demonstrate it.94 Respondent, in turn, has derived the requirements of the term \"investment\" from its ordinary meaning, interpreted in context and in light of the treaty's object and purpose, which cannot be limited to the protection of foreign investments for it also includes the stimulus of foreign investment and the accompanying flow of capital in order to develop the Contracting States' economies.95 Under this interpretation, the equation of the term investment with \"every kind of asset\" is not consistent with the object and purpose of the Slovakia-Greece BIT.96 Further, Claimants' proposition that falling into one of the categories of assets of Article 1(1) of the Slovakia-Greece BIT suffices for an investment, would lead to unreasonable results and to the inclusion of one-off transactions as investments.97\n\nRep., \u00b6\u00b6 158-159.\n\nRep., \u00b6\u00b6 160-167.\n\nRep., \u00b6\u00b6 165-169.\n\nRep., \u00b6 162.\n\n101.\n\nResponding to arguments advanced by Claimants, Greece conveys that contrary to the Italy-Argentina BIT that was applied in the *Abaclat v. Argentina* and *Ambiente Ufficio* *v. Argentina* cases, neither the Slovakia-Greece BIT nor the Cyprus-Greece BIT expressly include sovereign debt instruments in the definition of investment.98 The Slovakia-Greece BIT and other Greek BITs that do expressly include bonds, only refer to corporate bonds, whose nature is distinct from that of sovereign bonds.99 Thus, the fact that the Slovakia-Greece BIT and the Cyprus-Greece BIT include corporate bonds and not sovereign bonds indicates that the Parties did not intend to extend investment treaty protection to the latter kind of assets.100\n\nHearing, Tr., 440:13-21.\n\nHearing, Tr., 440:22-442:4.\n\nHearing, Tr., 442:13-20.\n\n102.\n\nHence, Respondent posits that Po\u0161tov\u00e1 banka's purchases of GGB interests do not meet the necessary requirements to qualify as an investment under Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention and Article 1(1) of the Slovakia-Greece BIT.\n\n103.\n\nFirst, Respondent argues that Po\u0161tov\u00e1 banka's purchases of GGB interests did not result in a contribution to the Hellenic Republic's economy. Greece argues that contribution of an investment to the host State's economy is necessary for an investment to benefit from protection under the ICSID Convention and an investment treaty, as this is the *quid pro quo* of the investor's right to resort to international arbitration.101 This proposition is supported in the preambles of the Slovakia-Greece BIT and the ICSID Convention, which evidence that the State parties aimed to encourage and protect international investment made for the purpose of contributing to the economy of the host State, in academic writings, as well as in the decisions in *Caratube v. Kazakhstan,*102*Phoenix v. Czech Republic* and *Nations Energy v. Panama.*103\n\nMem., \u00b6 120.\n\n*Caratube International Oil Company LLP v.

Panama* \"); Mem., \u00b6\u00b6 120124.\n\n104.\n\nSecond, Respondent argues that Po\u0161tov\u00e1 banka's purchases of GGB interests were secondary market transactions which did not involve flow of funds to the Hellenic Republic. The only flow of funds to Greece occurred when the bonds were issued and were paid by the Primary Dealers. Therefore, any payment made by Po\u0161tov\u00e1 banka did not involve a contribution to or a relevant economic activity within the Hellenic Republic.104\n\nMem., \u00b6\u00b6 125-126.\n\n105.\n\nThird, Respondent argues that Po\u0161tov\u00e1 banka's purchases of GGBs were speculative commercial transactions that did not involve any investment risk or any term commitment of resources. According to Respondent, \"Po\u0161tov\u00e1 Banka's GGB interests were freely negotiable, high risk, short-term financial instruments, which did not involve any investment risk or any term commitment of financial resources on the part of Po\u0161tov\u00e1 Banka.\"105\n\nRep., \u00b6 220.\n\n106.\n\nIn fact, Respondent says, interests in GGBs do not imply a different risk from that of ordinary commercial transactions;106 they did not involve any risk sharing of operational risk.107 Greece points to *Romak v. Uzbekistan*, where the tribunal established that an investment risk was distinct from the pure commercial risk of nonperformance of a contract, to establish that investment risk entails uncertainty as to returns and expenditures, even if all parties fulfill their contractual obligations.108 The fact that default risk has a special quality due to the sovereign character of the issuer does not make this an investment risk.109 Respondent also argues that sovereign bonds do not involve an element of risk sharing required for assets to be protected as an investment under Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention.110\n\nMem., \u00b6 128.\n\nRep., \u00b6\u00b6 222-223.\n\nMem., \u00b6\u00b6 129-130.\n\nRep., \u00b6 221.\n\nMem., \u00b6 132.\n\n107.\n\nIn addition, Greece holds that Po\u0161tov\u00e1 banka made no term commitment of financial resources. Certain duration of the investment is required for its protection under the Slovakia-Greece BIT.111 Po\u0161tov\u00e1 banka acquired interests in GGBs that could be sold at any moment in the secondary market112 so that by their very nature they do not meet the duration requirement.113\n\nMem., \u00b6 134.\n\nMem., \u00b6 136.\n\nMem., \u00b6 140.\n\n108.\n\nRespondent argues that the intended duration of the commitment should be considered.114 Po\u0161tov\u00e1 banka acquired these interests with the intention of reselling them in the near future, but then reclassified them from its AFS to its HTM portfolio in order to achieve higher cash flows as a result of the 2010 bail-out by the EU and the IMF and to protect Po\u0161tov\u00e1 banka's balance sheet.115 This sole reclassification, which was based on speculation and on a change of intent by the bank,116 does not suffice to convert interests in GGBs into investments of a certain duration.117 Respondent cites the decision in *KT Asia v. Kazakhstan*118 where the tribunal found that acquisition of shares with the intention to sell them in the short term did not meet the duration requirement because it did not involve a long-term contribution of resources.119\n\nRep., \u00b6\u00b6 225-227.\n\nRep., \u00b6 233.\n\nRep., \u00b6 229.\n\nMem., \u00b6\u00b6 137-138; Hearing, Tr., 421:18-19.\n\n*KT Asia Investment Group B.V. v. Republic of Kazakhstan*, ICSID Case No. ARB/09/8, Award of October 17, 2013 (\" *KT Asia v. Kazakhstan* \").\n\nMem., \u00b6 139.\n\n109.\n\nPo\u0161tov\u00e1 banka's intention to exploit the price volatility of the GGB interests due to Greece's financial situation is further evidenced by its decision to sell and then repurchase GGB interests in the exact same series during 2011.120 These transactions underscore the speculative nature of the operation and the lack of economic activity in the host country.121\n\nMem., \u00b6\u00b6 141-143; Rep., \u00b6\u00b6 236-239.\n\nMem., \u00b6 144.\n\n110.\n\nFinally, Respondent claims that the territorial *nexus* required for investments to be protected under the Slovakia-Greece BIT and the ICSID Convention is absent in Postova banka's GGB interests. The preamble and several provisions of the Slovakia-Greece BIT are premised on the making of investments in the territory of the host State.122 Therefore, this BIT does not cover investments made outside the territory of the Hellenic Republic. Similarly, the Hellenic Republic's consent to ICSID arbitration is limited to investments made in its territory. Notwithstanding an express limitation in Article 10 of the BIT, this provision is limited to the same subject matter as the rest of the treaty.123\n\nMem., \u00b6\u00b6 146-147.\n\nMem., \u00b6 148.\n\n111.\n\nIn this same sense, the object and purpose of the ICSID Convention signals that for investments to be within the scope of Article 25(1), they must be made in the territory of the respondent State.124\n\nMem., \u00b6\u00b6 149-150.\n\n112.\n\nSecondary market purchases of interests in sovereign bonds lack territorial connection with the host State. This transaction did not involve inflow of funds into Greece and were not linked to any business undertaking in the Hellenic Republic.125 Postova banka's interests were held in accounts in Clearstream, maintained in Luxembourg and governed by Luxembourg law.126\n\nMem., \u00b6\u00b6 152-153.\n\nMem., \u00b6 154.\n\n113.\n\nMoreover, Claimants have not established that the purchase of GGB interests in the secondary market involved a flow of funds into the Hellenic Republic, because \" *the* *sums paid to the Hellenic Republic by the underwriters cannot possibly be* *characterized as \u2018advance payments' of the purchase price paid by Po\u0161tov\u00e1 Banka in the course of the GGB interests' ordinary trading, long after completion of the bond issuance and distribution process*.\"127 These purchases could not have benefited Greece since, at the time they were made, Respondent had no primary market for GGBs.128 Holders of GGBs are not parties to any \u2018loans' in the terms of Article 1(1)(c) of the Slovakia-Greece BIT for *\"[i]f the subscription of GGBs themselves could be compared with a \u2018loan,' the subscription agreements in relation to the bond issuances would have* *been concluded by the Primary Dealers, not Po\u0161tov\u00e1 Banka.* \"129 The *situs* of interests in immobilized securities is the place where the clearer is established, thus Po\u0161tov\u00e1 banka only had a right to payment against Clearstream, and these claims were situated in Luxembourg and not in Greece.130\n\nRep., \u00b6 246.\n\nRep., \u00b6 247.\n\nRep., \u00b6 249.\n\nRep., \u00b6\u00b6 250-252.\n\n114.\n\nIn its Reply on Jurisdiction, Greece responded to assertions by Claimants concerning the nature of their investment. In the first place, Greece stated that the Invitation Memorandum cannot change the fact that only Participants in the System are considered the legal owners of the GGBs; only Participants were allowed to submit Participation Instructions.131\n\nRep., \u00b6 187.\n\n115.\n\nIn addition, Respondent contests the application of the \"unity of investment\" theory to establish jurisdiction over transactions conducted in the secondary market for the purchase of GGB interests. Po\u0161tov\u00e1 banka's purchases were not ancillary to or an implementation of an overall investment made by Claimants in Greece.132 Instead, Claimants \" *seek to piggy back on the alleged original contributions made by unrelated third parties in the original bond issuance process*.\"133 Po\u0161tov\u00e1 banka's purchases did not form an integral part of the original bond issuances, because the bank purchased interests in the secondary market long after the distribution process was complete.\n\nRep., \u00b6\u00b6 192-201.\n\nRep., \u00b6 201; *See* Rep., \u00b6\u00b6 192-201.\n\n116.\n\nGreece distinguishes the situation of claimants in *Abaclat v. Argentina* and *Ambiente Uffizio v. Argentina,* where the tribunals found that the purchase of security entitlements constitutes a protected investment because these purchases resulted indirectly in economic benefit or flow of funds to the State.134 The Hellenic Republic did not receive any of the purchase price paid by Po\u0161tov\u00e1 banka for its GGB interests, either directly or as an \"advance payment.\" Based on Professor Hubbard's report, Respondent assert that from an economic perspective, the interests acquired by Po\u0161tov\u00e1 banka, long after the end of the distribution period, were fundamentally different from the instruments involved in the distribution process.135\n\nRep., \u00b6 205.\n\nRep., \u00b6\u00b6 207-208.\n\n117.\n\nRespondent then suggests that, in any case, Claimants' purchases of GGB interests are too remote from the GGBs issuance process to be considered to give rise to a dispute arising directly out of an investment. Claimants' purchases of the interests in GGBs were structured in a way that had no effect on the price for the issuer.136 At the time of purchase by Claimants, Greece no longer had access to the primary market; transfers in the secondary market had no effect on the primary market since the pricing of GGBs was dependent on potential bail-outs to Greece.137 This remote and disconnected secondary market did not provide any benefit to the Hellenic Republic.138 Based on *Enron v. Argentina*139 and *PSEG v. Turkey,*140 Respondent argues that even if interests in GGBs and GGBs were not to be considered separate financial instruments, claims based on Po\u0161tov\u00e1 banka's trades in the secondary market are beyond the cut-off point at which claims are permissible, because they are too distant from the underlying investment.141\n\nRep., \u00b6 215.\n\nRep., \u00b6 214, \u00b6\u00b6 216-219.\n\nHearing, Tr., 452:19-22.\n\n*Enron Creditors Recovery Corporation (formerly Enron Corporation) & Ponderosa Assets, L.P. v.

Mexico,*145*BG Group v. Argentina*,146*El Paso v. Argentina*147 and *ST-AD v.

Bulgaria* \").\n\nMem., \u00b6\u00b6 161-164.\n\n122.\n\nConsequently, in order to enforce its claim, Istrokapital would have to prove that its shareholding in Po\u0161tov\u00e1 banka is protected under the Cyprus-Greece BIT and that the measures allegedly taken against the Greek Bonds in contravention of the Cyprus-Greece BIT impaired the value of Istrokapital's shares.150 According to Respondent, Istrokapital cannot claim that its shareholding in a Slovak company, such as Po\u0161tov\u00e1 banka, qualifies as a protected investment under the Cyprus-Greece BIT, as it has no property right or activity whatsoever in Greek territory.151\n\nMem., \u00b6 165.\n\nMem., \u00b6 166.\n\n123.\n\nIn its Reply on Jurisdiction, Respondent notes that the cases invoked by Claimants actually support Respondent's contention that a tribunal may only exercise jurisdiction on the basis of claimants' shareholding in a local company - even if such shareholding is indirect - but not on account of the local company's assets.152\n\nRep., \u00b6\u00b6 254-260.\n\n124.\n\nMoreover, in explaining the differences between the circumstances addressed in the *Siemens v. Argentina*153 and *Azurix v. Argentina*154 cases cited by Claimants, Respondent indicates that, in order to claim protection of an investment under the relevant treaty, the claimant must show an active involvement in the act of investing.155 Since, by Claimants' own admission, Istrokapital had no part in the acquisition and management of Po\u0161tov\u00e1 banka's GGB interests, it cannot claim to have indirectly invested in the bonds.156\n\n*Siemens A.G. v.

In this regard, Respondent explains that, while the shareholding confers rights to participation in certain decisions affecting the company, it is the company itself that owns and manages its assets.157 Therefore, investment treaty protection is generally conferred to the claimant's participation in a domestic company for derivative or reflective losses in the value of its shares, but not for losses to the domestic company and its assets in themselves.158\n\nRep., \u00b6 261.\n\nRep., \u00b6 261.\n\n126.\n\nIn regard to the Tribunal's jurisdiction over Istrokapital, Respondent further refers to its arguments that Po\u0161tov\u00e1 banka's GGB interests are not protected under the Cyprus-Greece BIT or the ICSID Convention.159 On this subject, Respondent stresses that (i) the GGB interests do not display the elements of contribution to the host State, risk sharing and duration that belong to the \"inherent\" meaning of the term \"investment\" in the context of investment treaty arbitration,160 and (ii) that the GGB interests cannot be considered an investment made \"in the territory\" of Greece as required by the Cyprus-Greece BIT.161\n\nMem., \u00b6 167; Rep., \u00b6 278.\n\nMem., \u00b6\u00b6 168-170; Rep., \u00b6\u00b6 280-281.\n\nMem., \u00b6\u00b6 171-173.\n\n**b. Claimants' Position**\n--------------------------\n\n***Po\u0161tov\u00e1 Banka Has a Protected Investment***\n----------------------------------------------\n\n127.\n\nClaimants assert that the Tribunal has jurisdiction *ratione materiae* under the broad definitions of investment in the Slovakia-Greece BIT and in the Cyprus-Greece BIT because GGBs are assets comprising a loan to the Greek Government, a claim to money, and the right to performance under a contract having financial value under Article 1.1(c) of the Slovakia-Greece BIT and are assets, comprising monetary claims and contractual claims with economic value under Article 1.1(c) of the Cyprus-Greece BIT.162 According to Claimants, this language \" *clearly encompasses a sovereign bond, and the rights to that bond that were taken away by Greece's forced surrender of our client's bonds. Certainly a bond is a monetary claim. It's a monetary claim to coupon payments and to payment of the principal on maturity.* \"163 Claimants submit that, contrary to Respondent's suggestion, there is no relevant difference between a bond and a loan.164\n\nC-Mem., \u00b6 88.\n\nHearing, Tr., 481:3-8.\n\nHearing, Tr., 562:7-563:1.\n\n128.\n\nClaimants consider that Greece's interpretation of the term \"investment\" is inconsistent with the language and the object and purpose of the BITs. Article 31 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of the Treaties governs the Tribunal's interpretation of the BITs165 and Greece overlooks that Article 31(4) VCLT provides that a special meaning shall be given to a term if it is established that the parties so intended. Thus, instead of resorting to a restrictive dictionary definition,166 Respondent should have consulted the definition of \u2018investment' in each treaty.167\n\nC-Mem., \u00b6 90; Hearing, Tr., 69:21-70:1.\n\nC-Mem., \u00b6 95.\n\nC-Mem., \u00b6 91.\n\n129.\n\nIn fact, \"[d]efinitional sections in treaties obviously may provide express elaborations of particular meanings that Parties intended to give certain terms.\"168 Where a treaty defines a given term, this definition overrides any other meaning that could be given to such term.169\n\nHearing, Tr., 62:14-16.\n\nHearing, Tr., 70:16-18.\n\n130.\n\nThe definitions of \"investment\" in the treaties do not contain the limitations advanced by Greece. In both cases, the State parties defined the term carefully, providing a broad general definition as every kind of asset and a list of examples of what would constitute an investment for the purpose of the treaty. The cap of the definition includes language that shows that investment means every kind of asset without limitations, and there was no need to define sovereign bonds specifically because they are included in monetary and contractual claims.170 Claimants rebut the notion proposed by Greece of some concept of \"investment\" under international law that is different from treaty definitions. If such a concept were to exist, \"it would no doubt account for the fact that most contemporary treaties refer in broad terms to every kind of asset, including those to which Greece is a party.\"171\n\nHearing, Tr., 484:18-485:13.\n\nHearing, Tr., 75:17-20.\n\n131.\n\nThese general definitions are consistent with the object and purpose of the treaties, as elucidated in their preambles,172 specifically in the reference to the creation of favorable conditions for investments of investors.173 In any case, a treaty's object and purpose cannot be used to read out an express definition in its text.174 Claimants argue that \" *[i]n so doing, the parties to each BIT clearly intended to give a special meaning* *to the term \u2018investment' and to ensure that, at a minimum, any kind of asset that they enumerated would fall within that meaning*.\"175\n\nC-Mem., \u00b6 93.\n\nHearing, Tr., 72:11-73:4.\n\nHearing, Tr., 72:11-19.\n\nC-Mem., \u00b6 92.\n\n132.\n\nGGBs fall squarely in some of these categories and Respondent fails to ascribe ordinary meaning to those categories that would exclude them from the BITs' scope.176 Greece cannot get around the fact that it explicitly agreed to include financial instruments in both BITs.177\n\nC-Mem., \u00b6 92.\n\nHearing, Tr., 61:15-18.\n\n133.\n\nIn addition, Claimants argue that Greece's attempt to import definitions from *Romak v. Uzbekistan* and *Alps Finance v. Slovakia* is inapposite.178\n\nC-Mem., \u00b6 96.\n\n134.\n\nIn any case, Claimants assert that the GGB interests purchased on the secondary market constitute protected \"investments.\" The distinction drawn by Respondent between GGBs and interests in GGBs and the fact that Postova banka was not a registered Participant in the System make no difference for jurisdictional purposes.179 This distinction also ignores recent decisions by tribunals in *Abaclat v. Argentina* and *Ambiente Ufficio v. Argentina.*\n\nC-Mem., \u00b6\u00b6 98-99.\n\n135.\n\nPurchases by investors like Po\u0161tov\u00e1 banka imply a contribution to the Hellenic Republic because the flow of funds to Greece depends entirely on the sale of GGBs on the secondary market. Claimants state that the issuance of GGBs was necessarily premised on the existence of a robust secondary market and that Greece knew and understood this and therefore required the Primary Dealers to make a market in its bonds.180 Claimants base this proposition on several sections of the documents underlying issuance of the bonds.181\n\nC-Mem., \u00b6 101.\n\nC-Mem., \u00b6 102.\n\n136.\n\nDuring the Hearing, Claimants responded to the distinction raised by Respondent between the issuance of the bonds and their purchase in the secondary market in order to question the existence of an economic contribution. Claimants stated that foreign portfolio investment provides access to funds that the State did not have and that the increased liquidity generated by secondary market GGBs facilitated Greece's debt financing.182 Furthermore, Greece treated the relevant investors in GGBs as if they were the first purchaser in the secondary market.183 In fact, as further evidence of a unified market between the primary and secondary markets, Claimants stated that holders in the secondary market were the ones that voted the Consent Solicitation.184\n\nHearing, Tr., 92:11-93:2.\n\nHearing, Tr., 93:3-14.\n\nHearing, Tr., 96:17-97:8.\n\n137.\n\nIn addition, Claimants hold that the tribunals in *Abaclat v. Argentina and Ambiente Ufficio v. Argentina* found that there is no distinction between government bonds and security entitlements held in a book-and-entry form in a universal depository such as Clearstream, since they are part and parcel of the same investment operation.185 These tribunals also rejected attempts to separate the primary and secondary markets and found that investors in the secondary market had provided a contribution to the State.186 Referring to the \"unity of an investment operation\" as explained by the *CSOB v. Slovakia* tribunal, Claimants conclude that: \" *[t]he bonds and the interests in the bonds are part of one single act of investment in which Po\u0161tov\u00e1 Bank and Greece participated*.\"187\n\nC-Mem., \u00b6\u00b6 103-104.\n\nHearing, Tr., 98:11-99:10.\n\nC-Mem., \u00b6 106; *Ceskoslovenska Obchodn\u00ed Banka, A.S. v. Slovak Republic,* ICSID Case No. ARB/97/4, Decision on Jurisdiction of May 24, 1999 (\" *CSOB v. Slovakia* \").\n\n138.\n\nMoreover, Claimants submit that Greece's conduct during the time of the restructuring, whereby it treated Po\u0161tov\u00e1 banka as a bondholder and included holders of Designated Securities in the Invitation Memorandum to participate in the exchange, cannot be squared with its current litigation position. These facts were significant for the *Abaclat v. Argentina* tribunal, which concluded that a sovereign that included secondary market purchasers in the exchange offer admitted their importance in the bond issuance and distribution process.188\n\nC-Mem., \u00b6\u00b6 107-109.\n\n139.\n\nFor these reasons, Claimants assert that secondary market purchases of GGBs constitute protected investments.\n\n140.\n\nAs to the territorial nexus, Claimants first signal that neither the Slovakia-Greece BIT nor the Cyprus-Greece BIT require the funds to be linked to a specific project in Greece and that tribunals, such as the tribunal in *Ambiente Ufficio v. Argentina*, have refused to insert such a requirement into treaties.189 For territoriality purposes, it is sufficient that funds were put at the disposal of Greece to foster its economic development.190\n\nC-Mem., \u00b6 112.\n\nC-Mem., \u00b6 112.\n\n141.\n\nIn this regard, Claimants explain that the GGBs are located in the Bank of Greece191 and that their issuance and their sale in the secondary market constitute a single investment in Greece.192 Territorial nexus should be assessed differently in events of financial investments, for, as established in *Fedax v. Venezuela* and in *CSOB v. Slovakia*, in such events the funds are not physically transferred to the territory of the beneficiary, but put at its disposal elsewhere.193 Hence, in this case, the relevant question is whether Po\u0161tov\u00e1 banka ultimately made funds available to Greece to support its economic development. It is clear that Claimants' investment involved a flow of funds into Greece and thus the territorial *nexus* is satisfied.194\n\nHearing, Tr., 111:7-17.\n\nC-Mem., \u00b6 113.\n\nC-Mem., \u00b6\u00b6 114-115.\n\nHearing, Tr., 110:22-111:6.\n\n142.\n\nSince the bond issuance process incorporated both the primary and secondary markets as a means to provide Greece with funds for government spending, and since the GGBs would not have been successfully sold on the primary market without the secondary market, the territorial *nexus* is satisfied.195 This conclusion was also reached by the *Abaclat v. Argentina* and *Ambiente Ufficio v. Argentina* tribunals.196 The existence of a minor time interval between the flow of funds from the bond issuance to the sale of bonds in the secondary market and the fact that Clearstream accounts were located in Luxembourg and governed by Luxembourg law do not bear consequences on this territoriality *nexus*.197\n\nC-Mem., \u00b6 116.\n\nC-Mem., \u00b6 116.\n\nC-Mem., \u00b6\u00b6 117-118.\n\n143.\n\nIn addition, since GGBs are \"investments\" within the meaning of the BITs, they qualify as investments under Article 25 (1) of the ICSID Convention. According to Claimants, the ICSID Convention does not pose a bar due to a more restrictive definition of investment than in each BIT. Greece's consent to ICSID jurisdiction in each BIT creates a strong presumption that the parties considered the bonds an investment under both treaties to be an investment under the Convention.198 Furthermore, since the drafters of the Convention chose not to define \"investment,\" \" *the clear trend is for* *tribunals to hold that assets that fall within the definition of \u2018investment' under an applicable bilateral investment treaty also constitute an \u2018investment' under the ICSID Convention absent compelling reasons to disregard the Parties' mutually agreed definition.* \"199\n\nC-Mem., \u00b6 120.\n\nC-Mem., \u00b6 122.\n\n144.\n\nNonetheless, Claimants submit that even under the \"double-barreled test,\" GGBs qualify as a protected investment within the context of a broad \"objective\" definition of the term investment under Article 25 of the ICSID Convention.200 The purchase of sovereign debt is not a marginal economic activity that can be compared to transactions that have been determined to fall outside of the ICSID Convention.201 In this sense and referring to the decisions in *Fedax v. Venezuela, Abaclat v. Argentina* and *Ambiente Ufficio v. Argentina,* Claimants state that every ICSID tribunal that has considered the issue has held that government debt instruments purchased in the secondary market constitute an \"investment\" under the ICSID Convention.202\n\nC-Mem., \u00b6 124.\n\nC-Mem., \u00b6 124.\n\nC-Mem., \u00b6 125.\n\n145.\n\nClaimants rebut Greece's reference to the set of cumulative criteria to determine whether an investment was made under Article 25 of the ICSID Convention - the \"so-called \u2018 *Salini* criteria.'\" Neither the BITs nor the ICSID Convention contain these criteria, and Greece derives their authority from cases that post-date these treaties and therefore cannot reflect the intention of the States that are parties to those treaties.203 Claimants refer to writings by scholars and decisions of prior tribunals that have criticized this position and viewed it as contrary to the ICSID Convention. Particularly, Claimants signal to the decisions in *Biwater Gauff v. Tanzania*,204 where the tribunal deemed that this approach might exclude transactions that have been internationally recognized as protected investments, and to the decision in *Abaclat v. Argentina* where the tribunal considered that imposing limitations that the parties did not create would be contrary to the Convention's aim of encouraging investments.205\n\nHearing, Tr., 83:10-84:5.\n\n*Biwater Gauff (Tanzania) Ltd. v. United Republic of Tanzania*, ICSID Case No. ARB/05/22, Award of July 24, 2008 (\" *Biwater Gauff v. Tanzania* \").\n\nC-Mem., \u00b6 127.\n\n146.\n\nIn any event, GGBs satisfy the criteria of the *Salini* approach. First, Po\u0161tov\u00e1 banka made a contribution of approximately \u20ac500 million to purchase bonds and Greece made regular payments for these bonds.206 Second, Claimants bore a risk beyond an ordinary commercial risk, evidenced by the existence of a dispute and by the possibility of the host State's intervention in relation to the sovereign bonds.207 The need for \"operational risk sharing\" to establish the existence of an investment is not inserted in the language of the BITs.208 Third, Po\u0161tov\u00e1 banka made a contribution to the Greek economy because through the issuance of bonds the host country raised funds for government spending.209 Claimants further explained that no distinction could be drawn between the economic contribution generated by a general funding sovereign bond and a bond issued for a specific project.210\n\nC-Mem., \u00b6 129.\n\nC-Mem., \u00b6 130.\n\nHearing, Tr., 102:15-20.\n\nC-Mem., \u00b6 131.\n\nHearing, Tr., 505:16-506:16.\n\n147.\n\nLastly, GGBs are of sufficient duration. This element is determined by the relevant duration period in the term specified in the contract, as established in *Deutsche Bank v. Sri Lanka*,211 and not by how long Claimants held the bonds.212 Claimants dispute Respondent's assertions that Po\u0161tov\u00e1 banka bought the bonds with the intent of reselling them, by stating that a party's intent is irrelevant in regards to the duration requirement. In any case, Po\u0161tov\u00e1 banka did not speculate in GGBs, for by holding them in its HTM portfolio, its long-term commitment to the bonds is evidenced. Moreover, the 2011 tradings do not undermine the status of GGBs as investments, since resale of bonds does not negate the benefit Greece received from the credit, regardless of who the investor was at a given point in time.213 Claimants' investments remained despite the 2011 tradings and they would remain until maturity.214 These transactions were motivated by an effort to address the bank's losses due to the declining value of GGBs.215\n\n*Deutsche Bank AG v. Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka*, ICSID Case No. ARB/09/02, Award of October 31, 2012 (\" *Deutsche Bank v.

Placing the bonds in the AFS portfolio is consistent with the strategy of holding them until maturity, but simply gives the bank more flexibility.218 Once Po\u0161tov\u00e1 banka purchased all of the bonds it intended to purchase, it allocated 80% of them in the HTM portfolio and left 18% of the bonds in the AFS portfolio.219 Bonds in the HTM portfolio were not sold between the first months of 2010 and their forcible exchange.220 The 2011 tradings are not evidence of speculative intent, but means to deal with the bank's capital adequacy.221\n\nHearing, Tr., 51:20-52:2.\n\nHearing, Tr., 52:2-4.\n\nHearing, Tr., 53:8-21.\n\nHearing, Tr., 105:4-18.\n\nHearing, Tr., 106:17-107:1.\n\nHearing, Tr., 107:21-108:18.\n\n***Istrokapital Has a Protected Investment***\n---------------------------------------------\n\n149.\n\nClaimants argue that Istrokapital's indirect investment in the Greek Bonds is no barrier to its claim.\n\n150.\n\nIstrokapital claims that, as a shareholder in Po\u0161tov\u00e1 banka, it made an indirect investment in the assets of Po\u0161tov\u00e1 banka222 - the GGBs - and that such investment is protected under Article 1(1)(c) of the Cyprus-Greece BIT.223 More precisely, Claimants hold that \" *Istrokapital indirectly invested in the Greek Bonds through its Slovak subsidiary Po\u0161tov\u00e1 Bank.* \"224 According to Claimants, such investment schemes have been recognized by arbitral tribunals which have \" *consistently assumed jurisdiction over claims regarding shareholders' indirect investments through intermediary companies in third-party States*.\"225\n\nHearing, Tr., 120:11-12.\n\nRequest, \u00b6 20; C-Mem., \u00b6 88 and \u00b6 137.\n\nC-Mem., \u00b6 141.\n\nC-Mem., \u00b6 141.\n\n151.\n\nClaimants argue that shareholders may assert treaty claims independently of the corporations in which they hold shares, even if there are intermediary companies separating the shareholder claimants from their investment in the respondent State.226 Moreover, Claimants state that such intermediary companies may be incorporated in a State different from the Contracting States parties to the BIT in question.227\n\nC-Mem., \u00b6 139.\n\nC-Mem., \u00b6 140.\n\n152.\n\nFinally, Claimants refute Respondent's contention that there is a difference between an indirect investment in shares and an indirect investment in assets and argue that what matters is that the BIT's definition encompasses indirect economic interests as the Cyprus-Greece BIT does.228 According to Claimants, the tribunals in *BG Group v. Argentina* and *El Paso v. Argentina*, among others, recognized that the claimant's shareholding in the local company entitled it to bring claims before the tribunal based on the host State's treatment of such company's contracts and assets.229 Thus, there is no reason why Istrokapital should be denied protection under the Cyprus-Greece BIT of its \" *indirect investment in the Greek Bonds.* \"230\n\nC-Mem., \u00b6 143.\n\nC-Mem., \u00b6 144.\n\n*See* C-Mem., \u00b6 138.\n\n**2. The Tribunal Lacks Jurisdiction** ***Ratione Temporis*** **and/or the Claims Should Be Dismissed on the Grounds of Abuse of Process**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**a. Respondent's Position**\n----------------------------\n\n153.\n\nRespondent claims that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction *ratione temporis* over claims based on the GGB interests held in Po\u0161tov\u00e1 banka's HTM portfolio because Claimants did not possess a protected investment at the time when the measures that allegedly violated the relevant BITs were taken.231 According to Respondent, Po\u0161tov\u00e1 banka had transferred all risk associated with these interests and only assumed the losses claimed in the present arbitration *ex post facto*.232 Such *post hoc* assumption of losses also constitutes an abuse of process as it was made with the view of claiming them in this arbitration.233\n\nRep., \u00b6 286.\n\nRep., \u00b6 286.\n\nMem., \u00b6 176.\n\n154.\n\nRespondent argues that in order to establish jurisdiction *ratione temporis*, a claimant must show that it held a protected investment under the ICSID Convention and the relevant BIT at the time when the alleged treaty violation occurred.234 In this vein, Respondent maintains that risk is an inherent element of a protected investment under both the ICSID Convention and the two relevant BITs and, citing to *KT Asia v.* *Kazakhstan*, contends that such element is missing when a claimant is somehow shielded from any risk.235\n\nMem., \u00b6 181; Rep., \u00b6\u00b6 294-298.\n\nMem., \u00b6 178.\n\n155.\n\nAccording to Respondent, Po\u0161tov\u00e1 banka entered into a series of agreements with J&T Finance in response to the pressure from its regulator (the NBS) to limit its exposure to GGBs in order to protect capital adequacy.236 Respondent argues that this purpose was achieved through the Assignment Agreements, which fully shielded Po\u0161tov\u00e1 banka from any risk associated with the GGB interests in its HTM portfolio, including that of debt exchange.237 Thus, as of December 23, 2011, Po\u0161tov\u00e1 banka's investment in the GGB interests held in its HTM portfolio lost the element of risk inherent to the definition of a protected investment.238\n\nMem., \u00b6 80; Rep., \u00b6 282; Hearing, Tr., 31:1-9.\n\nMem., \u00b6\u00b6 179-180; Rep., \u00b6 283.\n\nHearing, Tr., 37:4-10.\n\n156.\n\nUnder the Assignment Agreements, Po\u0161tov\u00e1 banka was protected from any losses on the GGBs so that it would not have been entitled to claim any damages in arbitration.239 Respondent asserts that Po\u0161tov\u00e1 banka only assumed the losses purportedly derived from the Bondholder Act, the Consent Solicitation and the implementation of the debt exchange after they had occurred.240 Indeed, Respondent claims that although backdated to March 8, 2012, the Settlement Agreement that intended to cancel the Assignment Agreements only became effective on March 13, 2012, i.e., after the aforementioned measures had come into effect.241 In this regard, Respondent explains that a notification from Clearstream informing that the new securities had been credited to Po\u0161tov\u00e1 banka's account was set in the Settlement Agreement as a condition for the cancellation of the Assignment Agreements and such notification was made on March 13, 2012.242\n\nHearing, Tr., 433:1-434:7.\n\nMem., \u00b6 175 and \u00b6 179; Rep., \u00b6 288.\n\nMem., \u00b6 179; Rep., \u00b6 289.\n\nMem., \u00b6 96 and \u00b6 98.\n\n157.\n\nAccording to Respondent, the fact that the Settlement Agreement was conveniently backdated to exactly the day before the results of the Consent Solicitation were announced and four days before the debt exchange was implemented,243 is evidenced by the fact that Claimants were still exchanging drafts of the Settlement Agreement in late March 2012 and accordingly did not disclose the existence of that agreement in the annual reports filed in the first semester of 2012.244 Respondent also suggests that the minutes provided by Claimants as evidence that a settlement agreement was discussed and approved on March 8, 2012 are not only unreliable but actually refer to another agreement.245\n\nRep., \u00b6 308; Hearing, Tr., 10:22-11:3.\n\nRep., \u00b6 288.\n\nHearing, Tr., 438:4-22.\n\n158.\n\nIn this regard, Respondent also claims that Claimants' theory that an original settlement agreement was effectively signed on March 8, 2012 and later amended is untenable as Claimants have failed to produce the signed \"original\" agreement and to provide a witness statement from the purported signatory (Mr. Hoffmann).246 Since Claimants have failed to deliver a consistent explanation of why the Settlement Agreement was backdated to March 8, 2012, it must be inferred that Po\u0161tov\u00e1 banka assumed the losses related to its HTM portfolio *ex post facto* with the sole purpose of claiming compensation for the face value of the securities in this arbitration.247\n\nRep., \u00b6 288.\n\nHearing, Tr., 44:8-18.\n\n159.\n\nIn response to Claimants' contention that the Assignment Agreements never entered into effect because the condition precedent of a \"haircut\" never occurred, Respondent notes that such assertion is inconsistent with the information provided by Po\u0161tov\u00e1 banka in its annual reports, the representations it made to its auditor and to its regulator and with internal documents that suggest that Po\u0161tov\u00e1 banka would receive payment from J&T Finance even in the event of a compulsory debt exchange.248 Moreover, Respondent points out that the text of the Assignment Agreements itself contemplated a debt exchange.249 Also, Respondent argues that the correct interpretation of the Assignment Agreements is that they were effective on signature, but J&T Finance was not obliged to make payments until the Due Date or the Early Due Date.250\n\nRep., \u00b6 290; Hearing, Tr., 39:7-40:14. The internal document specifically referred to by Respondent is C-155, Po\u0161tov\u00e1 Bank Finance Department Analysis of March 7, 2012, at PBI-00001494.\n\nRep., \u00b6 292.\n\nHearing, Tr., 430:5-22.\n\n160.\n\nFinally, and in response to Claimants' argument that Article 10(3) of the Slovakia-Greece BIT explicitly acknowledges that a claimant may shield itself from risk without losing protection under the BIT, Respondent argues that such provision refers to insurance contracts which are different from the transactions under discussion. According to Respondent, the J&T Finance Assignment Agreements are best paralleled to a forward sale of receivables that effectively transfers the entire risk and not to an insurance contract where payment of a premium is required.251\n\nRep., \u00b6 304.\n\n161.\n\nIn sum, Respondent claims that since Po\u0161tov\u00e1 banka was shielded from the risk associated with its HTM portfolio at the time when the disputed measures were taken and only assumed the losses *ex post facto*, the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction *ratione temporis* over claims based on such interests.252\n\nMem., \u00b6 176 and \u00b6 182; Rep., \u00b6 284.\n\n162.\n\nFurthermore, Respondent argues that, in any event, Po\u0161tov\u00e1 banka's decision to assume the losses *ex post facto* constitutes an abuse of process, because it was made in view of the upcoming dispute and with the intention of claiming such losses in international arbitration.253 According to Respondent, the foregoing is particularly evidenced in correspondence from Po\u0161tov\u00e1 banka and Istrokapital to international law firms \" *regarding proposal for legal representation in dispute with Greece* \" dated February 23, 2012.254 It is also evidenced by a memorandum sent by the General Manager of J&T Finance to Mario Hoffman and Po\u0161tov\u00e1 banka's CEO, among others, which, in exploring Po\u0161tov\u00e1 banka's alternatives regarding the Consent Solicitation, suggested that the best option was \"not to \u2018swap'\" because it opened the door for international arbitration against Greece.255\n\nMem., \u00b6 176 and \u00b6 183.\n\nMem., \u00b6 184.\n\nMem., \u00b6\u00b6 186-187.\n\n163.\n\nIn its Reply, Respondent contests the alleged contradictions adverted by Claimants in regard to its understanding of the transactions involving the Assignment Agreements and the backdated Settlement Agreement. First, Respondent explains that these transactions were motivated by the positions adopted by the NBS and Po\u0161tov\u00e1 banka's auditor KMPG regarding the bank's dealing with its exposure to Greek debt.256 Second, Respondent asserts that J&T Finance is not part of the Istrokapital group and the question of whether it could have brought a claim against Greece itself is irrelevant for the purposes of this arbitration.257 Lastly, Respondent argues that Claimants can hardly complain that Respondent disregarded the agreements between J&T Finance and Istrokapital, when Claimants themselves concealed those agreements from Po\u0161tov\u00e1 banka's auditor and regulator.258 Besides, Respondent claims that, in any event, evidence in the record supports the conclusion that J&T Finance was the one bearing the risk of losses pursuant to the Assignment Agreements.259\n\nRep., \u00b6 308.\n\nRep., \u00b6 309.\n\nRep., \u00b6\u00b6 311-312.\n\nRep., \u00b6\u00b6 312-313.\n\n164.\n\nAs for the GGB interests held in Po\u0161tov\u00e1 banka's AFS portfolio, Respondent claims that these were purchased in late 2011 with a view to initiating investment treaty arbitration at a time when the present dispute was highly probable and, as a result, claims based on such GGBs should also be dismissed on grounds of abuse of process.260\n\nMem., \u00b6\u00b6 189-193; Rep., \u00b6 316.\n\n165.\n\nIn this regard, Respondent recalls that in the course of 2011, Po\u0161tov\u00e1 banka sold the GGB interests in its AFS portfolio and then repurchased the same amount and same series in December 2011.261 According to Respondent, by this time the present dispute was \"clearly foreseeable\" as the upcoming debt exchange had already been announced in the October 26, 2011 Euro Summit.262 Additionally, consultations between Greece, Euro Area authorities and private creditors on the debt exchange had been amply publicized since July 2011.263\n\nMem., \u00b6 189.\n\nMem., \u00b6 191; Rep., \u00b6 316.\n\nMem., \u00b6 191.\n\n166.\n\nMoreover, Respondent explains that while Po\u0161tov\u00e1 banka's selling of the GGB interests in its AFS portfolio could achieve the stated purpose of improving the bank's capital adequacy and also result in some tax benefits, the same rationale cannot be applied to the repurchase of the same interests as no such benefits would derive therefrom.264 Hence, Respondent concludes that the repurchase of the GGB interests in late 2011 can only be explained as an attempt to buy claims against Greece in view of an imminent dispute.265\n\nRep., \u00b6\u00b6 317-319.\n\nRep., \u00b6 319; Hearing, Tr., 32:20-33:1 and 33:12-18.\n\n167.\n\nFinally, Respondent asserts that the transactions carried out by Po\u0161tov\u00e1 banka in connection with the GGB interests held in its HTM portfolio and those held in its AFS portfolio are not inconsistent.266 On the contrary, they are easily explained as Claimants' attempt to \"double down on its bet\" by buying further interests at a great discount with a view of bringing a claim against Greece for the full face value of such instruments.267\n\nRep., \u00b6 320.\n\nRep., \u00b6 320.\n\n168.\n\nAccordingly, Respondent requests that all claims based on the GGB interests held in Po\u0161tov\u00e1 banka's AFS portfolio be dismissed on grounds of abuse of process, as these were bought at a time when the present dispute was clearly foreseeable and with the sole intention of claiming compensation for their face value in this arbitration.268\n\nRep., \u00b6 321; Hearing, Tr., 33:12-18.\n\n**b. Claimants' Position**\n--------------------------\n\n169.\n\nAccording to Claimants, Respondent's *ratione temporis* and abuse of process objections fail on both legal and factual grounds. As regards the legal justification, Claimants argue that Respondent's risk theory is an \"improper distortion\" of the *Salini* test, irrelevant for the purposes of a *ratione temporis* objection. As to the factual grounds, Claimants assert that Respondent has failed to fully and correctly explain the context and effects of the Assignment Agreements and related transactions.269\n\nC-Mem., \u00b6 151.\n\n170.\n\nFirst, Claimants argue that Respondent's \"unprecedented\" theory that Po\u0161tov\u00e1 banka did not hold a protected investment at the time when the treaty breaches occurred because it was allegedly shielded from risk is not a question of jurisdiction *ratione temporis*.270 According to Claimants, the *ratione temporis* doctrine \" *is entirely about* *timing of investments and nationality at the time the investment was made and the time that the treaty claim arose.* \"271 Since Respondent has not made any allegations that touch upon these questions, the *ratione temporis* doctrine is simply inapplicable.272\n\nHearing Tr., 124:15-22; C-Mem., \u00b6\u00b6 152-153.\n\nHearing, Tr., 124:3-6.\n\nHearing, Tr., 124:7-15; C-Mem., \u00b6 152.\n\n171.\n\nSecond, Claimants assert that Respondent's reliance on the *Salini* test is misplaced because the proper standard for determining whether a given investment is protected is found in the language of the BIT. According to Claimants, the bonds in question are comprised within the definition of investment of the Slovakia-Greece BIT and such status did not change upon Claimants' entrance into the Assignment Agreements.273\n\nC-Mem., \u00b6 154.\n\n172.\n\nThird, Claimants argue that even if the *Salini* test were applied, Respondent's contentions are unsupported by case-law. On the one hand, tribunals that have applied the *Salini* test have found that the fact that a claimant has mitigated the risk of its investment does not necessarily mean that such investment is no longer protected.274 In this regard, the decision in *KT Asia v. Kazakhstan* relied upon by Respondent is inapposite as it does not address a case where an investor made an investment and then mitigated against part of its risk.275 Moreover, Claimants indicate that the two relevant BITs allow investors to mitigate against the risk of their investment through insurance or otherwise276 and accordingly prohibit raising a defense to the effect that an investor has received compensation for damages under an insurance contract.277\n\nC-Mem., \u00b6 155.\n\nC-Mem., \u00b6 155.\n\nC-Mem., \u00b6 155.\n\nHearing, Tr., 125:12-126:1.\n\n173.\n\nOn the other hand, even the tribunals that apply the *Salini* test convey that the elements of an investment must be globally assessed and that the fact that one of them is not present does not necessarily imply a lack of jurisdiction.278 Thus, Respondent's theory that a temporary disappearance of one *Salini* factor renders an otherwise protected investment no longer protected, is also unsupported.279\n\nC-Mem., \u00b6 156.\n\nC-Mem., \u00b6 157.\n\n174.\n\nIn addition to the legal flaws in Respondent's allegations, Claimants argue that Respondent's *ratione temporis* argument according to which Po\u0161tov\u00e1 banka was shielded from risk through the Assignment Agreements is not supported by the facts on the record.\n\n175.\n\nFirst, Claimants explain that under the J&T Finance agreements, Istrokapital - and not J&T Finance - would absorb the losses eventually suffered by Po\u0161tov\u00e1 banka in connection with the GGBs.280 Claimants insist that these transactions must be examined in conjunction with the share purchase agreement between Istrokapital and J&T Finance whereby Istrokapital endeavored to reimburse J&T Finance for any losses resulting from the bond restructuring.281 Accordingly, if a \"haircut\" was imposed on the GGBs and, as a result, the Assignment Agreements came into effect, J&T Finance would - pursuant to another set of assignment agreements between Istrokapital and J&T Finance - assign to Istrokapital the claims previously assigned by Po\u0161tov\u00e1 banka under the Assignment Agreements.282 In any event, Claimants point out that regardless of who bore the losses, the risk factor remained inherent to the investment.283\n\nC-Mem., \u00b6 159.\n\nHearing, Tr., 130:16-131:22.\n\nC-Mem., \u00b6 160.\n\nHearing, Tr., 142:14-19.\n\n176.\n\nClaimants complain that Respondent has conveniently overlooked the agreements between J&T Finance and Istrokapital, hiding behind the fact that these were allegedly concealed from KPMG and the NBS. In response to this allegation, Claimants explain that those authorities have no jurisdiction over Istrokapital and thus Claimants were only obliged to disclose what was reflected in the agreements between J&T Finance and Po\u0161tov\u00e1 banka.284\n\nHearing, Tr., 135:18-136:10.\n\n177.\n\nSecond, Claimants argue that, in any event, the Assignment Agreements were cancelled on March 8, 2012 by means of the Settlement Agreement. According to Claimants, the cancellation of the Assignment Agreements was a result of the need for an alternative structure to protect J&T Finance from losses associated with the GGBs in view of the fact that a \"seizure of the Greek Bonds\" rather than a \"haircut\" was going to take place.285\n\nC-Mem., \u00b6 161.\n\n178.\n\nThird, even if the Settlement Agreement only entered into force on March 13, 2012, as Respondent claims, Po\u0161tov\u00e1 banka had not assigned the \"bonds\" at the time of the alleged treaty breaches because the condition precedent for the assignment envisaged in the Assignment Agreements, namely a \"haircut,\" had not taken place at that time.286\n\nC-Mem., \u00b6 162.\n\n179.\n\nAs regards the abuse of process allegations, Claimants note that Respondent has failed to comply with the high burden of proof that falls on the party raising such a claim.287 According to Claimants, none of the facts and evidence presented by Respondent support the abuse of process claims.288 First, Claimants argue that Respondent's theory in regard to the cancellation of the Assignment Agreements as a means for Po\u0161tov\u00e1 banka to assume the losses *ex post facto* and thereby gain standing in this arbitration is illogical.289 In this regard, Claimants point out that under Respondent's theory, there would be no reason for Po\u0161tov\u00e1 banka to struggle with the cancellation of the Assignment Agreements in order to get jurisdiction, because the Czech J&T Finance, as alleged \"true\" holder of the Bonds, could have brought the claim itself under an identical BIT.290\n\nC-Mem., \u00b6 165.\n\nC-Mem., \u00b6 166.\n\nC-Mem., \u00b6 167.\n\nC-Mem., \u00b6 168.\n\n180.\n\nSecond, Claimants assert that the standard of review of an abuse of process claim is whether a claimant took actions to manufacture jurisdiction where there was none.291 According to Claimants, Respondent's theory is flawed as its fails to explain why Po\u0161tov\u00e1 banka decided to enter into the Assignment Agreements, which supposedly endangered the claim, precisely at the time where a possible lawsuit was foreseeable, but then hurriedly cancelled those agreements to obtain the same jurisdiction it would have had three months before, when the Assignment Agreements had not been signed, and then waited six months to exercise jurisdiction by initiating this arbitration.292\n\nC-Mem., \u00b6 169.\n\nC-Mem., \u00b6 170.\n\n181.\n\nAs regards the allegedly backdated Settlement Agreement, Claimants argue that Respondent did not meet the burden of proof of an abuse of process claim as it failed to demonstrate that Claimants acted in bad faith.293 Claimants explain that an original settlement agreement was effectively signed on March 8, 2012, but since it had to be drafted quickly in light of the pace of the events, the parties then negotiated a more detailed Settlement Agreement replacing the original version. Given that the Settlement Agreement provided the exact same protections as the original one, the parties found it appropriate to date the former as of the same date as the latter.294 Claimants stress that this explanation is consistent with Mr. Tarda's testimony.295 Moreover, Claimants contradict Respondent's contention that the Settlement Agreement did not exist until late March 2012 by pointing out that it was discussed and approved in extraordinary meetings of Po\u0161tov\u00e1 banka held on March 7 and 8, 2012, as evidenced in the corresponding minutes.296\n\nC-Mem., \u00b6\u00b6 171-172.\n\nHearing, Tr., 127:21-129:13.\n\nHearing, Tr., 128:14-129:1.\n\nHearing, Tr., 140:5-12.\n\n182.\n\nFinally, Claimants assert that the evidence invoked by Respondent as proof of Po\u0161tov\u00e1 banka's intention of manufacturing jurisdiction is clearly insufficient.297 According to Claimants, bad faith cannot be derived from the fact that Claimants sought legal advice in a situation (passing of the Bondholder Act) where legal representation was obviously needed.298 As regards the memorandum discussing alternatives to respond to the Consent Solicitation, Claimants point out that the document simply offers different scenarios, including that of international arbitration, but says nothing about an effort to manufacture jurisdiction.299\n\nC-Mem., \u00b6 174.\n\nC-Mem., \u00b6 174.\n\nC-Mem., \u00b6 175.\n\n183.\n\nOn the contrary, Claimants argue that Respondent conveniently ignored the presentations made by officials of Po\u0161tov\u00e1 banka in connection with the decision to accept or reject the Exchange Offer. According to Claimants, these documents show that Po\u0161tov\u00e1 banka's main concern in this regard was whether the new securities would be transferable to third parties in case liquidity was needed, but do not support Respondent's contention that Po\u0161tov\u00e1 banka reassumed the losses in order to gain standing to later claim those losses in international arbitration.300\n\nC-Mem., \u00b6 176.\n\n184.\n\nFurther, Claimants claim that the structure of the transactions envisaged in the Settlement Agreement show that Claimants' underlying intention was to ensure that Po\u0161tov\u00e1 banka stayed capitalized if the bonds were \"forcibly taken\" and that J&T Finance would persist in its investment in Po\u0161tov\u00e1 banka without assuming the losses derived from the bonds.301\n\nC-Mem., \u00b6 177.\n\n185.\n\nAlso, Claimants explain that the Assignment Agreements were cancelled in view of the fact that the debt restructuring would consist of a swap instead of a \"haircut\" as envisaged by the Assignment Agreements.302 Contrary to Respondent's contentions, the Assignment Agreements could not possibly apply to a bond swap because they were premised on transactions to be carried out with the existing bonds. If these ceased to exist as the result of a bond exchange, the structure would no longer work.303\n\nC-Mem., \u00b6 178.\n\nHearing, Tr., 135:1-17.\n\n186.\n\nAs regards the abuse of process claim in connection with the GGBs held in Po\u0161tov\u00e1 banka's AFS portfolio, Claimants point to the contradictions in Respondent's theory that such bonds were sold and repurchased in late 2011 in an effort to create jurisdiction in view of an upcoming dispute.304\n\nC-Mem., \u00b6 179.\n\n187.\n\nFirst, Claimants point out that if Po\u0161tov\u00e1 banka's intention was to acquire claims, it would make no sense that it would sell the bonds it already held.305 According to Claimants, Po\u0161tov\u00e1 banka was entitled to invoke the Tribunal's jurisdiction both before and after those trades were made and it simply bought back the same bonds at a loss in order to ensure the bank's capital adequacy.306 Moreover, Claimants argue that the repurchase of the bonds only evidences the bank's intention to hold the bonds to maturity.307 Claimants add that there is no difference in the investment before and after the sale and repurchase transactions, but even if treated as separate investments, there is no basis to decline jurisdiction.308\n\nC-Mem., \u00b6 179.\n\nHearing, Tr., 145:22-146:9; C-Mem., \u00b6 180 and \u00b6 181.\n\nHearing, Tr., 55:19-56:1.\n\nHearing, Tr., 527:17-528:5.\n\n188.\n\nSecond, Claimants assert that it is contradictory to argue that Po\u0161tov\u00e1 banka was at the same time trying to shield itself from risk in relation to the GGBs held in its HTM portfolio, while trying to purchase new bonds and gain risk to access international arbitration in respect to the AFS portfolio.309\n\nC-Mem., \u00b6 181.\n\n189.\n\nAccordingly, Claimants conclude that contrary to Respondent's \"imagined theories,\" which are not supported by the record, the only consistent and logical explanation is that Claimants' actions \" *had nothing to do with future treaty claims against Greece and everything to do with ensuring the capital adequacy of the bank*.\"310\n\nHearing, Tr., 147:14-19.\n\n**3. The Tribunal Lacks Jurisdiction** ***Ratione Personae*** **Over Istrokapital**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**a. Respondent's Position**\n----------------------------\n\n190.\n\nRespondent claims that Istrokapital is neither a \"national of another Contracting State\" for the purposes of Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention, nor a legal person organized under Cypriot law with its seat in Cyprus as required by Article 1(3)(b) of the Cyprus-Greece BIT.311 Hence, the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction *ratione personae* over Istrokapital.\n\nMem., \u00b6 195; Rep., \u00b6 323.\n\n191.\n\nRespondent argues that in order to qualify as an investor under Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention, a claimant must meet a twofold requirement: it must be a national of a Contracting State of the ICSID Convention and it must not have the nationality of the respondent State.312 According to Respondent, as a supranational company established under EU law, Istrokapital is incapable of fulfilling this twofold condition.313\n\nMem., \u00b6 196.\n\nRep., \u00b6 323.\n\n192.\n\nFirst, Respondent argues that as a *societas europeas* (\"SE\"), Istrokapital is formed and existing under the law of the EU and not under Cypriot law.314 In view of the fact that the EU is not a Contracting State of the ICSID Convention, Istrokapital does not qualify as an investor under Article 25(1) of the Convention.315\n\nMem., \u00b6\u00b6 198-200.\n\nMem., \u00b6 200; Rep., \u00b6 333.\n\n193.\n\nAccording to Respondent, Recital 6 and Article 1(1) of SE Regulation confirm that a SE derives its existence and legal personality from EU law. Respondent claims that Claimants have mischaracterized SE Regulation, in particular its Articles 3 and 10, as none of these provisions obliges Greece to treat Istrokapital as a Cypriot investor for the purposes of Article 25 of the ICSID Convention.316\n\nRep., \u00b6\u00b6 334-335.\n\n194.\n\nSecond, Respondent contends that if, due to its SE nature, Istrokapital were considered to have been incorporated in Cyprus, as Claimants claim, it had to be equally considered as incorporated in any of the other EU Member States, including Greece, and would therefore bear Greek nationality as well.317 Since Article 25 of the ICSID Convention implicitly precludes juridical persons who have the \"nationality\" of the respondent State from resorting to ICSID arbitration,318 Istrokapital is outside the Centre's jurisdiction.319\n\nMem., \u00b6 201; Rep., \u00b6 340.\n\nMem., \u00b6\u00b6 204-205.\n\nMem., \u00b6 206.\n\n195.\n\nIn this regard, Respondent claims that Claimants' analogy between an SE and an EU citizen fails to disprove Respondent's contention that Istrokapital does not comply with the diversity of nationality requirement. According to Respondent, the status of an SE is neither accessory nor complementary as is the EU citizenship and the proposed analogy is therefore inapposite.320\n\nRep., \u00b6\u00b6 324-343.\n\n196.\n\nFurther, Respondent asserts that Istrokapital is not a protected investor under the Cyprus-Greece BIT as it does not comply with the two cumulative conditions required by Article 1(3)(b) of that BIT, namely those of (i) being constituted under Cypriot law and (ii) having its seat *(\"e\u00f3pa\")* within Cypriot territory.321 In other words, Istrokapital lacks a genuine connection with Cyprus, which is required by the relevant BIT in the form of incorporation and seat.322\n\nMem., \u00b6\u00b6 207-208; Rep., \u00b6 345.\n\nMem., \u00b6 210; Rep., \u00b6 323.\n\n197.\n\nFirst, Respondent insists that Istrokapital is constituted under EU law and not under Cypriot law.323 Second, Respondent claims that since the SE nature allows Istrokapital to transfer its seat from one EU Member State to another without dissolution or reincorporation, Istrokapital lacks a genuine connection with Cyprus.324\n\nMem., \u00b6 209.\n\nMem., \u00b6\u00b6 211-212.\n\n198.\n\nRespondent asserts that Claimants' translation of the term *\"\"\u00eb\u00f4pa\"* as \"registered office\" without requiring an \"effective center of business administration\" is incorrect. First, the equation of \" *\u00e9\u00bfpa* \" with \"registered office\" would render the two cumulative conditions of Article 1(3)(b) of the Cyprus-Greece BIT ineffectual because the maintenance of a registered office is practically a requirement of incorporation.325 Second, Respondent claims that the legal authorities invoked by Claimants as evidence that \" *\u00e9\u00bfpa* \" means \"registered office\" actually support Respondent's contention that the term's correct translation is \"seat.\"326\n\nRep., \u00b6 349.\n\nRep., \u00b6\u00b6 350-352.\n\n199.\n\nMoreover, Respondent claims that Istrokapital cannot be deemed to have its seat within Cypriot territory as required by Article 1(3)(b) of the Cyprus-Greece BIT, because the company is not effectively managed from Cyprus.327\n\nMem., \u00b6\u00b6 221-223.\n\n200.\n\nAccording to Respondent, the foregoing is evidenced by the fact that all of Istrokapital's current employees and directors are Slovak nationals who reside in the Slovak Republic;328 the costs associated with Istrokapital's registered office from 2010 to 2013 are primarily related to travel, supposed corporate events and telephone and post expenses and the office itself does not seem to be used by the company;329 and most of the company's operating expenses between 2010 and 2012 were incurred for activities outside of Cyprus.330 According to Respondent, Claimants' contention to the contrary is incorrect or at least misleading.331\n\nMem., \u00b6\u00b6 224-226.\n\nMem., \u00b6 227.\n\nMem., \u00b6 228.\n\nRep., \u00b6\u00b6 355-356.\n\n201.\n\nRespondent contends that it is unlikely that a conglomerate the size of Istrokapital could be effectively managed by only two non-resident employees and directors who only meet four times a year for short periods of time outside of Istrokapital's office.332 Instead, the more plausible inference from these facts is that Istrokapital is effectively managed in the Slovak Republic where its ultimate beneficial owner (the Slovak Mr. Hoffmann) resides.333\n\nMem., \u00b6 229; Rep., \u00b6 354.\n\nMem., \u00b6\u00b6 229-230.\n\n202.\n\nIn sum, Respondent claims that Istrokapital lacks the genuine connection requirement derived from the conjunctive conditions of incorporation and seat established under the Cyprus-Greece BIT and therefore cannot be considered a protected investor under the said treaty.334\n\nMem., \u00b6 231.\n\n203.\n\nFinally, Respondent argues that Istrokapital may not resort to investment treaty arbitration by means of an intra-EU BIT in order to resolve a dispute that involves key issues of EU law and touches upon the involvement of the EU and its Member States in the Greek financial crisis.335\n\nMem., \u00b6\u00b6 219-220; Rep., \u00b6\u00b6 338-339.\n\n204.\n\nAccording to Respondent, by allowing that cases involving matters of EU law - such as the present dispute - may be resolved by an investor-State arbitration tribunal, Article 9 of the Cyprus-Greece BIT disproves the CJEU's role as final and sole authoritative interpreter of EU law and is therefore incompatible with EU law.336 Respondent claims that under both Article 30(3) of the VCLT and EU law, EU law prevails over conflicting provisions of intra-EU BITs that were entered into before the States parties to the relevant BIT acceded to the European Union.337 Accordingly, Respondent concludes that Istrokapital may not rely on the Cyprus-Greece BIT in order to have the present dispute resolved by this Tribunal.338 In its Reply, Respondent stresses that Claimants failed to address the incompatibility of the present arbitration with EU law.339\n\nMem., \u00b6\u00b6 218-219; Rep., \u00b6\u00b6 338-339.\n\nMem., \u00b6\u00b6 214-217; Rep., \u00b6 337.\n\nMem., \u00b6 220; Rep., \u00b6 339.\n\nRep., \u00b6 336.\n\n**b. Claimants' Position**\n--------------------------\n\n205.\n\nContrary to Respondent's contentions, Claimants assert that Istrokapital is indeed a protected investor under both Article 25 of the ICSID Convention and Article 1(3)(b) of the Cyprus-Greece BIT.340\n\nC-Mem., \u00b6 182.\n\n206.\n\nClaimants argue that the nationality of a juridical person under Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention is determined by its place of incorporation or registered office.341 Istrokapital's constitutive documents evidence that Istrokapital was incorporated in Cyprus under Cypriot law, with its registered office in Cyprus, and Respondent's arguments to the effect that Istrokapital may not be deemed a \" *national of another Contracting State* \" under Article 25 of the ICSID Convention mischaracterize and disregard applicable EU law.342\n\nC-Mem., \u00b6 184.\n\nC-Mem., \u00b6\u00b6 184-186.\n\n207.\n\nClaimants assert that pursuant to the European Company Regulation, SEs must be treated as public limited-liability companies of the Member State in which they have their registered office.343 Similarly, other provisions of the same Regulation evidence that SEs are subject in many key aspects to the national law of the country in which they have their registered office.344\n\nC-Mem., \u00b6 185.\n\nHearing, Tr., 150:14-21.\n\n208.\n\nMoreover, Claimants sustain that, per the European Company Regulation, SEs are domiciled in one single State and the fact that they can transfer their registered office within the EU does not mean that they have multiple nationalities or no nationality because such transfer is subject to registration in a Member State at a time.345 Claimants also compare an SE with a natural person holding the nationality of an EU Member State who automatically becomes an EU citizen, but is not therefore rendered a national of every or no Member State.346\n\nC-Mem., \u00b6\u00b6 187-188.\n\nC-Mem., \u00b6 188.\n\n209.\n\nClaimants further argue that Istrokapital is a protected investor under the Cyprus-Greece BIT. First, Claimants claim that the Cyprus-Greece BIT does not require that Istrokapital have its \"effective center of administration\" in Cyprus.347 Following the principles of treaty interpretation found in the VCLT, Claimants argue that (i) the ordinary meaning of the word \" *\u00e9spa* \" in the context of corporate nationality has the same interchangeable meaning whether translated as \"seat\" or as \"registered office,\"348 (ii) there is no reason for interpreting this term restrictively because the BIT does not direct the interpreter to do so;349 and (iii) the use of \" *\u00e9spa* \" in other of Greece's BITs confirms that the term is not intended to impose additional requirements on investors other than having a \"registered office\" in the home State.350\n\nC-Mem., \u00b6 183 and \u00b6 195.\n\nC-Mem., \u00b6 197; Hearing, Tr., 151:13-18.\n\nC-Mem., \u00b6 198.\n\nC-Mem., \u00b6 200.\n\n210.\n\nIn any event, Claimants assert that Istrokapital meets the standard for its \"effective center of administration\" to be located in Cyprus, as (i) all of its board meetings and shareholders' meetings are held in Cyprus;351 (ii) contrary to Respondent's contention its two managing directors reside, work and pay income taxes in Cyprus;352 the company is registered in Cyprus for tax purposes and pays value-added tax there;353 (iii) most of Istrokapital's operating expenses (audit services; taxes and local fees; rent and utilities for its office; employees' salaries, among others) relate to its operations in Cyprus;354 and (iv) Istrokapital has its head office in the same place as its registered office in compliance with applicable EU law.355 Accordingly, even under the expansive interpretation of Article 1(3)(b) of the Cyprus-Greece BIT proposed by Respondent, Istrokapital is a Cypriot investor.356\n\nC-Mem., \u00b6 206.\n\nC-Mem., \u00b6\u00b6 206-207.\n\nC-Mem., \u00b6 208.\n\nC-Mem., \u00b6 209.\n\nC-Mem., \u00b6 210.\n\nC-Mem., \u00b6 201 and \u00b6 211; Hearing, Tr., 151:18-152:10.\n\n211.\n\nClaimants refute the theory that intra-EU BITs have become invalid or have otherwise terminated as a result of the States' accession to the EU.357 Claimants point out that, as recognized by various arbitral tribunals, intra-EU BITs remain valid because they have not been terminated pursuant to their own terms or the VCLT.358 Specifically, neither of the States parties to the Cyprus-Greece and the Slovakia-Greece BITs have provided notice of termination of either treaty pursuant to the respective BIT's terms.359\n\nC-Mem., \u00b6\u00b6 212-213.\n\nC-Mem., \u00b6 212.\n\nC-Mem., \u00b6\u00b6 215-217.\n\n212.\n\nMoreover, Article 59 of the VCLT, which is often invoked as basis of the proposition that intra-EU BITs are no longer valid, does not apply to the Slovakia-Greece and Cyprus-Greece BITs because (i) EU treaties and the two relevant BITs do not relate to the same subject matter;360 (ii) neither of the States parties to the Slovakia-Greece and Cyprus-Greece BITs have indicated that they intended for their BITs to be superseded by Slovakia's or Cyprus' accessions to the EU;361 and (iii) EU treaties and the two relevant BITs are not in such conflict that they cannot apply simultaneously.362 In any event, Article 59 of the VCLT is inapplicable because neither Greece nor Slovakia or Cyprus have initiated the notification procedure required by the VCLT in order to invoke termination of the respective BITs.363 In conclusion, Claimants assert that both the Slovakia-Greece and the Cyprus-Greece BITs remain in full force and effect and Claimants are entitled to rely on them in order to submit their investment disputes against Greece to international arbitration.364\n\nC-Mem., \u00b6 218\n\nC-Mem., \u00b6\u00b6 219-220.\n\nC-Mem., \u00b6 221.\n\nC-Mem., \u00b6 222.\n\nC-Mem., \u00b6 221 and \u00b6 223.\n\n**4.

Respondent's Position**\n----------------------------\n\n213.\n\nRelying on the 2013 Resolution of the Institute of International Law, Respondent argues that umbrella clauses cannot be imported, as Claimants claim.365 In this regard, Respondent first argues that the MFN clauses in the Slovakia-Greece and Cyprus-Greece BITs do not apply to umbrella clauses because the said treaties do not contain an umbrella clause themselves.366 Moreover, the extension of the protection of the Slovakia-Greece and Cyprus-Greece BITs to obligations incurred by Greece under its domestic law would violate the *ejusdem generis* rule.367\n\nRep., \u00b6 359; Hearing, Tr., 461:2-7.\n\nRep., \u00b6\u00b6 358-360.\n\nRep., \u00b6 361.\n\n214.\n\nSecond, Respondent claims that the umbrella clauses, in general, and the ones that Claimants seek to invoke, in particular, require contractual privity.368 Respondent argues that since neither Po\u0161tov\u00e1 banka nor Istrokapital has entered into any contractual relationship with Greece, they may not invoke any umbrella clauses.369\n\nMem., \u00b6 234; Rep., \u00b6 365.\n\nMem., \u00b6 239.\n\n215.\n\nMore specifically, Respondent argues that the umbrella clauses invoked by Claimants only apply to \" *obligations entered into by the host State under investment contracts* *and may only be invoked by the party to whom the contractual obligation is owed under applicable domestic law*.\"370 Respondent argues that the only contracts entered into by Po\u0161tov\u00e1 banka in connection with the GGBs are ordinary commercial agreements to which Greece is not a party.371 Thus, Claimants have failed to demonstrate that Greece has entered into an obligation with regard to their purported investment for purposes of the invoked umbrella clauses.372\n\nRep., \u00b6 368.\n\nRep., \u00b6 369.\n\nRep., \u00b6 369.\n\n216.\n\nThird, Respondent argues that even accepting Claimants' proposed standard, Claimants have failed to establish that (i) there is an \"obligor-obligee relationship\" between Claimants and Greece that (ii) gives rise to obligations \"specific in relation to an investment.\"373 Regarding the first requirement, Respondent claims that the parties' obligations arising from the GGBs must be examined under Greek law.374 In this regard, Respondent first notes that since Claimants do not qualify as bondholders under the terms of the GGBs, they cannot invoke any rights under the GGBs' terms or under the offering circulars.375 Second, Respondent argues that under Law 2198/1994, Po\u0161tov\u00e1 banka only has a claim to payment against Greece if the latter fails to pay \"due interest and principal\" to the Bank of Greece, which never occurred in the instant case.376 Otherwise, Po\u0161tov\u00e1 banka only has a claim to payment against Clearstream.377 Therefore, Respondent concludes that Law 2198/1994 does not create an obligor-obligee relationship between Greece and Po\u0161tov\u00e1 banka.378 Finally, Respondent asserts that Claimants have failed to demonstrate that the GGBs terms and conditions conferred on them a right to payment that could not be lawfully amended under the applicable Greek law.379\n\nRep., \u00b6 370.\n\nRep., \u00b6\u00b6 374-377.\n\nRep., \u00b6\u00b6 378-379.\n\nHearing, Tr., 458:17-459:9.\n\nRep., \u00b6\u00b6 381-382.\n\nRep., \u00b6 380.\n\nRep., \u00b6\u00b6 383-385.\n\n217.\n\nFourth, Respondent asserts that, by voting the Consent Solicitation, Po\u0161tov\u00e1 banka (i) waived any rights it may have had under Greek law in connection with GGBs and (ii) agreed to submit to the jurisdiction of Greek courts any dispute arising under the Consent Solicitation and the Exchange Offer.380 Accordingly, Claimants may not raise umbrella clause claims asserting that Greece violated its obligations under the aforementioned documents.381\n\nRep., \u00b6 387 and \u00b6 397.\n\nRep., \u00b6 397.\n\n**b. Claimants' Position**\n--------------------------\n\n218.\n\nClaimants argue that by virtue of the MFN clauses contained in the Slovakia-Greece and Cyprus-Greece BITs, they are entitled to import the umbrella clauses found in other treaties entered into by Greece and, specifically, those found in the Jordan-Greece and Croatia-Greece BITs.382\n\nC-Mem., \u00b6 224.\n\n219.\n\nAccording to Claimants, the authorities cited by Respondent to argue that investors cannot rely on the clauses to import umbrella clauses actually undermine this position.383\n\nHearing, Tr., 148:4-7.\n\n220.\n\nClaimants argue that Respondent's position that umbrella clause claims require contractual privity ignores the absence of any such limitation in the relevant BITs384 and has little support in decisions of other investor-State tribunals.385 Moreover, the idea that umbrella clause claims cannot be based on general commitments made by States is also undermined in previous decisions of other tribunals.386\n\nHearing, Tr., 67:5-8.\n\nHearing, Tr., 148:8-19.\n\nHearing, Tr., 149:5-17.\n\n221.\n\nClaimants submit that the umbrella clause refers to the existence of an obligor-obligee relationship between the host State and claimant in relation to an investment.387 Accordingly, Claimants argue that the question for determining whether the umbrella clause applies is whether the host State has assumed international obligations with respect to the claimant and its investment.388\n\nC-Mem., \u00b6\u00b6 226-228.\n\nC-Mem., \u00b6 229\n\n222.\n\nAccording to Claimants, such an obligor-obligee relationship clearly exists between Respondent and Claimants \" *with respect to payments of interest and principal\"* deriving from the terms of the GGBs.389 Also, in Law 2198/1994, Greece recognizes that payment obligations are specifically owed to investors.390 Therefore, Claimants insist that the Tribunal has jurisdiction over its umbrella clause claims.391\n\nC-Mem., \u00b6 230.\n\nC-Mem., \u00b6 231.\n\nC-Mem., \u00b6 232.\n\n223.\n\nMoreover, Claimants assert that the fact that the Invitation Memorandum was also directed to holders who had bought bonds in the secondary market without regard to when and how their purchases were made, and, as a result, that holders in the secondary market voted and fully participated in the process, shows that there was an obligation on the part of Greece and a sufficient relationship between Greece and the secondary purchasers to create an umbrella-clause claim.392\n\nHearing, Tr., 95:16-97:13.\n\n224.\n\nFinally, Claimants argue that the validity and meaning of the waiver contained in the Invitation Memorandum is a question to be discussed in the merits phase, if necessary.393\n\nHearing, Tr., 150:5-9.\n\n**VI. ANALYSIS OF THE TRIBUNAL**\n--------------------------------\n\n225.\n\nRespondent has submitted objections to the jurisdiction *ratione materiae*, *ratione personae* and *ratione temporis* of the Tribunal - together with an allegation of abuse of process - and an objection to jurisdiction related to the umbrella clause.\n\n226.\n\nThe objections to jurisdiction *ratione materiae* are twofold: First, Respondent claims that Istrokapital never made an investment under the Cyprus-Greece BIT and that Istrokapital may not base jurisdiction on assets of Po\u0161tov\u00e1 banka. Second, Respondent considers that Po\u0161tov\u00e1 banka's GGB interests are not protected investments under the Slovakia-Greece and Cyprus-Greece BITs.\n\n227.\n\nFor purposes of its analysis, the Tribunal will initially address objections to jurisdiction *ratione materiae* as follows:\n\nFirst, as to claimant Istrokapital:\n\na. By determining whether Istrokapital may establish jurisdiction on the basis that its investment under the Cyprus-Greece BIT are the GGBs held by Po\u0161tov\u00e1 banka.\n\nb. If so, by analyzing the term \"investment\" as described in Article 1 of the Cyprus -Greece BIT and determining whether the GGBs and any rights of Istrokapital thereunder fall within the scope of such definition.\n\nc. If so, the Tribunal may have to determine whether the term \"investment\" under Article 25 of the ICSID Convention has an inherent meaning or a meaning under international law that has to be analyzed together with the definition of \"investment\" under Article 1 of the Cyprus -Greece BIT, as claimed by Respondent, or whether the term \"investment\" for purposes of Article 25 of the ICSID Convention must be given the meaning of Article 1 of the Cyprus -Greece BIT, as claimed by Claimants.\n\nSecond, as to claimant Po\u0161tov\u00e1 banka:\n\nd. By analyzing the term \"investment\" as described in Article 1 of the Slovakia-Greece BIT and establishing whether the GGBs and the rights of Po\u0161tov\u00e1 banka thereunder fall within the scope of such definition.\n\ne. If so, the Tribunal may have to determine whether the term \"investment\" under Article 25 of the ICSID Convention has an inherent meaning or a meaning under international law that has to be analyzed together with the definition of \"investment\" under Article 1 of the Slovakia-Greece BIT, as claimed by Respondent, or whether the term \"investment\" for purposes of Article 25 of the ICSID Convention must be given the meaning of Article 1 of the Slovakia-Greece BIT, as claimed by Claimants.\n\n**1. Analysis of the Objections to the Tribunal's Jurisdiction** ***Ratione Materiae***\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**a. Whether Istrokapital Has an Investment Protected Under the Cyprus-Greece BIT**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n228.\n\nIstrokapital claims that, as a shareholder in Po\u0161tov\u00e1 banka, it made an indirect investment in the GGBs through Po\u0161tov\u00e1 banka and that such investment is protected under article 1.1. (c) the Cyprus-Greece BIT as assets comprising monetary claims and contractual claims with an economic value394. In this regard, Istrokapital has clearly stated that its claim rests solely on the GGB interests held by Po\u0161tov\u00e1 banka - that is, on the bank's assets - and not on its shareholding in the company.395 Respondent challenges this position by asserting that Istrokapital has no legal right to the assets of Po\u0161tov\u00e1 banka, including the GGB interests. Hence, those interests are not protected under the Cyprus-Greece BIT and Istrokapital may not pursue a claim on such basis.396\n\nC-Mem., \u00b6 88\n\nRequest, \u00b6 20; C-Mem., \u00b6\u00b6 137-138.\n\nRep., \u00b6 264.\n\n229.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees with the Respondent: there is nothing in the record that supports Claimants' contention that a shareholder in the position of Istrokapital has standing to assert claims for an alleged impairment of the assets of a company (in the place of Po\u0161tov\u00e1 banka) in which it holds shares. Claimants have failed to establish that the Cyprus-Greece BIT enables Istrokapital to submit claims for any alleged rights or claims that Po\u0161tov\u00e1 banka might have against Greece. Moreover, prior case law, discussed by the Parties, supports the opposite proposition, that is, that shareholders do not have claims arising from or rights in the assets of the companies in which they hold shares.\n\n230.\n\nFirst, as the *HICEE B.V. v. Slovak Republic*397 tribunal rightly points out, the \"default position\" in international law is that a company is legally distinct from its shareholders.398 The foregoing implies that as an independent legal entity, a company is granted rights over its *own* assets, which it alone is capable of protecting.399 Claimants have not even attempted to establish whether there is a deviation of the \"default position\" in the applicable domestic law. In other words, Claimants have failed to prove that, under the applicable law, Istrokapital has any legal or contractual right to the GGB interests held by Po\u0161tov\u00e1 banka that would allow it to bring a treaty claim against Greece on the basis of an alleged impairment of such security entitlements.\n\n*HICEE B.V. v. Slovak Republic*, UNCITRAL, PCA Case No. 2009-11, Partial Award of May 23, 2011 (\" *HICEE B.V. v. Slovak Republic* \").\n\nRL-28, \u00b6 147, cited by Respondent in Mem., footnote 234 to \u00b6 160.\n\n*Ahmadou Sadio Diallo* (Republic of Guinea v. Democratic Republic of the Congo), I.C.J., Preliminary Objections, Judgment of May 24, 2007, I.C.J. Reports 2007, p. 582 at p. 605 \u00b6 61, cited by Respondent in Mem., footnote 234 to \u00b6 160.\n\n231.\n\nClaimants' contention does not find any support in previous decisions of investment arbitration tribunals either. On the contrary, tribunals - such as the one in *ST-AD GmbH v. Republic of Bulgaria* - have consistently held that \" *an investor has no enforceable right in arbitration over the assets and contracts belonging to the company in which it owns shares.* \"400\n\n*ST-AD v. Bulgaria*, \u00b6 278.\n\n232.\n\nReferring to the decisions in *El Paso v. Argentina, BG v. Argentina,* and *ST-AD v. Bulgaria*, among others, Claimants argue that investment arbitration tribunals have recognized that \" *the claimant's interest in a local company in the host State entitled it* *to assert claims based in the host State's treatment of that local company's contracts* *and assets*.\"401 The foregoing is true, but - in accordance with the same decisions referred to by Claimants - only to the extent that those claims are related to the effects that the measures taken against the company's assets have on the value of the claimant's shares in such company.\n\nC-Mem., \u00b6 144.\n\n233.\n\nIn *El Paso v. Argentina*, the question before the tribunal was whether the rights protected by the US-Argentina BIT were limited to those pertaining to the shares held by the claimant in various Argentinian companies, or whether they included other items such as legal and contractual rights belonging to said companies.402 In other words, the tribunal had to examine whether certain assets of the companies in which the claimant had a shareholding qualified as protected investments under the treaty.\n\n*El Paso v. Argentina*, \u00b6 144 and \u00b6 148.\n\n234.\n\nThe answer provided by the *El Paso v. Argentina* tribunal was straightforward: while the shares held by the claimant in the Argentinian companies were a protected investment under the US-Argentina BIT, the licenses and other contracts granted to the Argentinian companies were not protected investments.403\n\n*El Paso v. Argentina*, \u00b6 177 and \u00b6 214.\n\n235.\n\nIn its analysis, the *El Paso v. Argentina* tribunal first verified whether the Argentinian companies qualified as protected investors under the relevant treaty and concluded that they did not.404 Consequently, the tribunal reasoned that if the domestic companies were not protected investors, their assets could not be considered protected investments.405 In the words of the tribunal:\n\n\"[...] *El Paso owns no contractual rights to be protected, as it has signed no contract with Argentina.* [\u2026] *It is thus the conclusion of the Tribunal that none of the contracts the interference with which is complained of by the Claimant are protected investments under the ICSID Convention and the BIT.* \"406\n\n*El Paso v. Argentina*, \u00b6\u00b6 178-187.\n\n*El Paso v. Argentina*, \u00b6 188.\n\n*El Paso v. Argentina*, \u00b6 189.\n\n236.\n\nIn summarizing its conclusion regarding the definition of the protected investment for the purpose of the tribunal's jurisdiction, the *El Paso v. Argentina* tribunal stated that\n\n\" *what is protected are \u2018the shares, all the shares, but only the shares.'* \"407\n\n*El Paso v. Argentina*, \u00b6 214.\n\n237.\n\nThe tribunal in *BG v. Argentina* reached the same conclusion. In that case, the claimant contended that its investment in Argentina consisted, *inter alia*, of certain \" *rights over the economic value* \"408 of a license for the distribution of natural gas held by one of the domestic companies in which BG Group Plc (\"BG\") owned an interest. Specifically, BG claimed that Argentina had breached the investment treaty, causing damage to BG's \"claims to money\" and \"claims to performance\" under the said license.409\n\n*BG Group v. Argentina*, \u00b6 112.\n\n*BG Group v. Argentina*, \u00b6 208.\n\n238.\n\nIn examining BG's claim, the tribunal noted that BG was not a party to the license and that it had not proved that it could directly assert any claims thereunder.410 Furthermore, the tribunal noted that the UK-Argentina BIT did not provide a mechanism that would allow BG to bring claims before the tribunal derived from the license on behalf of the domestic company.411 Finally, the tribunal concluded that \" *BG* *does not have standing to seize this Tribunal with \u2018claims to money' and \u2018claims to performance', or to assert other rights, which it is not entitled to exercise directly.* \"412\n\n*BG Group v. Argentina*, \u00b6 210.\n\n*BG Group v. Argentina*, \u00b6 214.\n\n*BG Group v. Argentina*, \u00b6 214.\n\n239.\n\nUltimately, the tribunal upheld jurisdiction over BG's claims, but only in so far as they related to its shareholding in the Argentine companies. While the tribunal found that BG's indirect participation in the domestic companies was an investment for the purposes of Article 1(a)(ii) of the UK-Argentina BIT,413 it made very clear that such protection did not extend to the license held by one of the companies in which BG owned an interest.\n\n*BG Group v. Argentina*, \u00b6 138; \u00b6 203; \u00b6 216.\n\n240.\n\nIn *Urbaser v. Argentina* - another decision invoked by Claimants - the tribunal accepted jurisdiction over the claims raised by the claimants under the relevant treaty \" *for damage suffered by them arising from their investment in the form of shares in* *AGBA,* \"414 an Argentine company that operated a concession for the provision of public services in Buenos Aires. In its decision, the tribunal emphatically noted that, pursuant to claimants' own case, their investment was bound to claimants' shares in the domestic company and their claims were limited to the protection of rights arising from said shares.415 In the words of the tribunal:\n\n*'\"Claimants repeatedly have stated that their claim is not based on* [...] *a hypothetical legal title that would allow a shareholder to raise in its own name a claim that is based on a relationship to which the company alone is party, and not the shareholders*.\"416\n\n*Urbaser S.A. & Consorcio de Aguas Bilbao Bizkaia, Bilbao Biskaia Ur Partzuergoa v. Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/07/26, Decision on Jurisdiction of December 19, 2012 (\" *Urbaser v. Argentina*,\"), \u00b6 254.\n\n*Urbaser v. Argentina*, \u00b6 204.\n\n*Urbaser v. Argentina,* \u00b6 237.\n\n241.\n\nAnother decision endorsing a similar approach to the issue at hand was delivered by the tribunal in *CMS v. Argentina*.417 This case concerned the treatment received by a foreign investor holding a minority shareholding in an Argentine company, which, in turn had been granted a license for the transportation of natural gas by the Argentinean Government. The *CMS v. Argentina* tribunal accepted jurisdiction on the basis of the claimant's shareholding in the domestic company and not on the account of any rights pertaining to such domestic company or relating to such company's assets.418\n\n*CMS Gas Transmission Company v. Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/01/8, Decision of the Tribunal on Objections to Jurisdiction of July 17, 2003 (\" *CMS v. Argentina* \").\n\n*CMS v. Argentina*, \u00b6\u00b6 66-68.\n\n242.\n\nThe *ST-AD v. Bulgaria* tribunal clearly established that its jurisdiction was limited to the claimant's shareholding in the domestic company - which was in fact a protected investment under the treaty - as opposed to the assets belonging to the local company in which claimant owned shares.419\n\n*ST-AD v. Bulgaria*, \u00b6 276; \u00b6 278; \u00b6 284.\n\n243.\n\nWhile the *ST-AD* tribunal conclusively held that \" *an investor whose investment consists of shares cannot claim, for example, that the assets of the company are its property and ask for compensation for interference with these assets,* \"420 it also clarified that \" *such an investor can, however, claim for any loss of value of its shares resulting from an interference with the assets or contracts of the company in which it owns the shares.* \"421\n\n*ST-AD v. Bulgaria*, \u00b6 282.\n\n*ST-AD v. Bulgaria*, \u00b6 282.\n\n244.\n\nThe same approach was confirmed by the *Paushok v. Mongolia* tribunal, which recognized that a shareholder is entitled to bring claims concerning alleged treaty breaches resulting from actions taken against the assets of the company in which it holds shares, but only to the extent that the shareholder's claims relate to the effect that such actions have on the value of its shares. In the words of the *Paushok v. Mongolia* tribunal:\n\n\" *In the present instance, Claimants' investment are the shares of GEM, a* *company incorporated under Mongolian law as required by that country in* *order to engage into the mining business and, through ownership of those shares, Claimants are entitled to make claims concerning alleged Treaty breaches resulting from*  *actions affecting the assets of GEM,* *including its rights to mine gold deposits or its contractual rights*  *and thereby affecting the value of their shares* *. It is therefore important to note that Claimants must prove that their claims arise out of the Treaty itself and not merely be an attempt to exercise contractual rights belonging to GEM. To argue that Claimants could not make such Treaty claims would render it practically meaningless in many instances; a large number of countries require foreign investors to incorporate a local company in order to engage into activities in sectors which are considered of strategic importance (mining, oil and gas, communications etc.). In such situations, a BIT would be rendered practically without effect if it were right to argue that any action taken by a State against such local companies or their assets would be not be subject to Treaty claims by a foreign investor because its investment is merely constituted of shares in that local company.* \"422 (Emphasis added).\n\n*Sergei Paushok & Ors. v. Government of Mongolia, UNCITRAL,* Award on Jurisdiction and Liability of April 28, 2011 *(\"Paushok v. Mongolia\"), \u00b6* 202 *.*\n\n245.\n\nAs clearly and consistently established by the above referenced decisions - all of which were invoked or discussed by Claimants in their Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction - a shareholder of a company incorporated in the host State may assert claims based on measures taken against such company's assets that impair the value of the claimant's shares. However, such claimant has no standing to pursue claims directly over the assets of the local company, as it has no legal right to such assets.\n\n246.\n\nIn the present case, Istrokapital has not relied on its shareholding in Po\u0161tov\u00e1 banka as the basis of its claim: indeed, as stated in Claimants' Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, \" *[t* *]* *o be clear, Istrokapital's protected investment is its indirect investment in the Greek Bonds, not its shareholding in Po\u0161tov\u00e1 Bank\"423* Istrokapital thus has expressly sought to base the Tribunal's jurisdiction on its alleged \"indirect investment\" in the GGBs held by Po\u0161tov\u00e1 banka. However, Istrokapital has failed to establish that it has any right to the assets of Po\u0161tov\u00e1 banka that qualifies for protection under the Cyprus-Greece BIT. Therefore, this Tribunal has no jurisdiction over Istrokapital's claims in the present arbitration.\n\nC-Mem., \u00b6 138.\n\n247.\n\nConsidering that the Tribunal does not have jurisdiction over Istrokapital's claims in this arbitration for the reasons expressed above, there is no need to undertake a detailed analysis of whether the GGBs qualify or not as an investment under the Cyprus-Greece BIT, or to analyze the interplay between the Cyprus-Greece BIT and the ICSID Convention, or the objections *ratione personae* or other objections to jurisdiction related exclusively to Istrokapital.424\n\nHowever, even if the Tribunal had found that Istrokapital had standing to claim for the alleged injury to Po\u0161tov\u00e1 banka's interest in the GGBs, Istrokapital's claims would still fail under the Cyprus-Greece BIT for substantially the same reasons contained in the following section of this Award. For the Tribunal, it is clear that there are some differences between the chapeau of the Cyprus-Greece BIT and the chapeau of the Slovakia-Greece BIT, and that the list of examples of what may constitute an investment differ in some cases between both treaties. But it is also clear that, first, the list of examples of the Cyprus-Greece BIT expressly refers to bonds, but only in respect of bonds issued by companies; second, there is no reference to financial instruments (not even, as in the case of the Slovakia-Greece BIT, a reference to loans); third, there is no language that suggests that the State parties intended to include public debt or public obligations, and last but not least, a general reference to \"monetary claims\" cannot be expanded to include instruments such as the GGBs, for the reasons explained in the analysis contained in the following paragraphs of this Award.\n\n**b. Whether Po\u0161tov\u00e1 Banka's GGB Interests Are Protected Investments Under the Slovakia-Greece BIT**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n248.\n\nThe Parties do not dispute that under Article 25 of the ICSID Convention, in order for the Tribunal to have jurisdiction *ratione materiae* over the dispute submitted to this Tribunal, it is necessary that the dispute relate to an investment. The Parties, however, disagree as to how the term \"investment\" should be construed under Article 25 of the ICSID Convention and Article 1(1) of the Slovakia-Greece BIT, and as to whether, in the light of the aforesaid provisions, the rights that Po\u0161tov\u00e1 banka claims to have under the GGBs are to be considered an investment.\n\n249.\n\nThe Parties do not contest that the VCLT contains the relevant provisions for the interpretation of the Slovakia-Greece BIT and the ICSID Convention. The Parties are in dispute, however, concerning the interplay between the aforementioned treaties and the VCLT and the results of the application of the VCLT to the aforementioned BIT and ICSID Convention.\n\n250.\n\nIn order to determine whether the rights of Po\u0161tov\u00e1 banka under the relevant GGBs qualify as an investment under the Slovakia-Greece BIT, the Tribunal will first refer to the relevant facts relating to the issuance of the GGBs and the acquisition thereof by Po\u0161tov\u00e1 banka (1). The Tribunal will then undertake the analysis of the relevant provisions of the Slovakia-Greece BIT (2). Finally, the Tribunal will consider how the ICSID Convention applies to such facts (3).\n\n*1. The Issuance of the GGBs and the Acquisition by Po\u0161tov\u00e1 Banka*\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n251.\n\nIn this section, the Tribunal will refer to the process of issuance of the GGBs by Greece, the actors that intervened in the process, the acquisition of the GGBs by Po\u0161tov\u00e1 banka and the relevant provisions of the norms, contracts and documents that apply to such issuance and acquisition.\n\n*1.1. The Issuance of the GGBs*\n-------------------------------\n\n252.\n\nIt is undisputed that the GGBs on which Po\u0161tov\u00e1 banka bases its claims were issued by Greece between 2007 and 2010 and that they comprise five different series, as follows:\n\n\u2022 **ISIN GR0114020457,** issued on March 2, 2007 pursuant to Ministerial Decision 2/13482/0023A of February 27, 2007, with an interest rate of 4.1% and maturing on 20 August 2012.425\n\n\u2022 **ISIN GR0114021463**, issued on March 26, 2008 pursuant to Ministerial Decision 2/20947/0023A of March 18, 2008, with an interest rate of 4% and maturing on 20 August 2013.426\n\n\u2022 **ISIN GR0110021236**, issued on February 17, 2009 pursuant to Ministerial Decision 2/11184/0023A of February 13, 2009, with an interest rate of 4.3% and maturing on 20 March 2012.427\n\n\u2022 **ISIN GR0114023485**, issued on February 2, 2010 pursuant to Ministerial Decision 2/6276/0023A of January 29, 2010, with an interest rate of 6.1% and maturing on 20 August 2015.428\n\n\u2022 **ISIN GR0124032666**, issued on March 11, 2010 pursuant to Ministerial Decision 2/14140/0023A of March 9, 2010, with an interest rate of 6.25% and maturing on 19 June 2020.429\n\nR-98, Ministerial Decision.\n\nR-99, Ministerial Decision.\n\nR-97, Ministerial Decision; R-111, Offering Circular.\n\nR-100, Ministerial Decision; R-112, Offering Circular.\n\nR-101, Ministerial Decision; R-110, Offering Circular.\n\n253.\n\nIt is also undisputed that the GGBs were subject to Greek law and to the jurisdiction of Greek courts.430\n\nR-110; R-111; R-112; R-113; R-114; R-115.\n\n254.\n\nChapter B, Articles 5-12, of Greek Law 2198 of 1994, governs the issuance of dematerialized titles, such as the GGBs, by the Greek Government.431\n\nR-108.\n\n255.\n\nLaw 2198 of 1994 created the System for Monitoring Transactions in Book-entry Securities (the \"System\"), administered by the Bank of Greece.432 In accordance with Article 6 of Law 2198 of 1994, aside from the Greek Government and the Bank of Greece, \"(\u2026) *legal or natural persons (Participants) defined either by category or by name are eligible for membership in the System, subject to approval by a Bank of Greece Governor's Act.* \"433\n\nR-108, Article 5.\n\nR-108, Article 6.1.\n\n256.\n\nParticipants in the System are the only ones who can hold titles to GGBs, yet securities acquired by Participants may be transferred to third parties.434 Such transfer \" *is valid between the parties and does not bring about legal consequences in favor or against the Greek Government or the Bank of Greece.* \"435\n\nR-108, Article 6.2.\n\nR-108, Article 6.2.\n\n257.\n\nThe Participants keep an account in the System and must keep a separate account for third parties who acquire the securities.436\n\nR-108, Articles 6.5, 6.6 and 6.7.\n\n258.\n\nPursuant to Article 8.2 of Law 2198 of 1994, the third party who acquires a security \"has a claim on his Security only against the Participant keeping his investor account. If the Greek Government has not fulfilled its obligations under paragraph 6 of the present Article, the investor has claim arising from the Security only against the Greek Government.\"437 Paragraph 6 of Article 8, in turn, provides that \"payment of due interest and principal on Securities by the Greek Government to the Bank of Greece discharges the Greek Government's obligations.\"438\n\nR-108, Article 8.2.\n\nR-108, Article 8.6.\n\n259.\n\nIn addition to the Participants, the Greek regulations provide for the participation of the \"Primary Dealers,\" in the syndications and auctions of Greek government securities in the primary market as well as in trading such securities in the secondary market.439 Primary Dealers are financial institutions appointed on a yearly basis by joint decision of the Minister of Economy and Finance and the Governor of the Bank of Greece in order to provide specialized services in the government securities market.440\n\nR-103, Article 1.1.\n\nR-103, Article 1.1 and Article 1.2.\n\n260.\n\nThe Primary Dealers assume obligations in the following areas: (A) the primary market, (B) the secondary market, (C) the yield curve and (D) further contribution to the Greek Government bond market.441\n\nR-103, Article 4.1, *Primary Dealers Obligations*.\n\n261.\n\nIn connection with the primary market, Primary Dealers \" *are required during the whole calendar year for which they have been granted the Primary Dealer status to participate actively in the auctions with competitive and non-competitive bids for an amount not less than 2% per year (duration weighted) of the total amount of successful bids at Government bond and Treasury-bill auctions. In addition, Primary Dealers participate in syndications of Greek Government securities...* \"442\n\nR-103, Article 4.\n\n262.\n\nIn the secondary market, Primary Dealers have the right to carry out transactions in GGBs on every approved regulated market, but are required during the whole calendar year for which they have been granted the Primary Dealer status to achieve a minimum turnover of not less than 2% of the total annual turnover (duration weighted) on the approved regulated markets.443 The transactions can be settled in the Bank of Greece Securities Settlement System or in any other Clearing and Settlement System approved by the Bank of Greece.444\n\nR-103, Article 4.\n\nR-103, Article 4.\n\n263.\n\nIn addition to the above, Primary Dealers are required, *inter alia*, as a further contribution to the Greek Government bond market, to facilitate a broad distribution of Greek Government securities domestically as well as internationally; to provide the Greek Government with advice, information on and assessment of market conditions, and other information pertaining to their status as Primary Dealers; and to submit certain reports on the activity on the primary and the secondary market.445\n\nR-103, Article 4.1.D.\n\n264.\n\nThe GGBs in question were issued by syndication or auction to 22 Primary Dealers.446\n\n*See* R-103; R-104; R-105; R-106; R-107.\n\n265.\n\nThe operation of the issuance of the GGBs may be summarized as follows: the Greek Government issued the GGBs through the Bank of Greece System to the Participants in the System and the Participants paid the consideration due to Greece. Participants in turn delivered the GGBs to the Primary Dealers, who provided the funds for the acquisition. Primary Dealers, in turn, sold the GGBs in the secondary market.447\n\n*See* Hubbard Report, \u00b6 44: \" *The issuance and distribution of GGBs on the primary and secondary market can be briefly summarized. Upon issuance of a GGB to a Participant, that Participant transfers funds via the Bank of Greece to the Hellenic Republic. All payments made by the Hellenic Republic, such as payments of coupons for GGBs are made exclusively to Participants via the Bank of Greece system, and all payments received by Greece for GGBs are likewise made only by Participants at the time of issuance. The primary dealers act as underwriters and intermediaries between Participants and the secondary market. Once the primary dealers have sold their GGBs into the secondary market the GGB distribution process is complete.* \" Professor Hubbard cites to R-108, Article 6 and R-109. This understanding is confirmed by Professor Stulz in his Cross Examination. *See* Hearing, Tr., 369:6-371:4.\n\n*1.2. Purchase of the GGBs by Po\u0161tov\u00e1 Banka*\n--------------------------------------------\n\n266.\n\nThe Parties do not dispute that Po\u0161tov\u00e1 banka was neither a Participant nor a Primary Dealer and therefore, Po\u0161tov\u00e1 banka did not intervene in the process of issuance of the GGBs and the initial distribution thereof to the secondary market. Even though Po\u0161tov\u00e1 banka claims that the \" *[p]articipants, who are registered in the BoG System, purchased* *the Greek Bonds and then immediately sold them to investors, like Po\u0161tov\u00e1 Bank, on the secondary market,* \u2019448 there is no evidence that Po\u0161tov\u00e1 banka acquired GGBs in the initial distribution made by Participants and Primary Dealers. On the contrary, the evidence in the record indicates that Po\u0161tov\u00e1 banka acquired the vast majority of its interests in the GGBs well after the initial distribution process had been completed, as follows:\n\n|  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| **ISIN** | **Date of Issuance** | **Purchase Dates**449 |\n| GR0114020457 | 2 March 2007450 | 20 January 2010 - 23 April 2010 |\n| GR0114021463 | 26 March 2008451 | 8 January 2010 - 20 January 2010 |\n| GR0110021236 | 17 February 20O9452 | 10 February 2010 |\n| GR0114023485 | 2 February 2010453 | 19 March 2010 - 22 March 2010 |\n| GR0124032666 | 11 March 2010454 | 19 March 2010 - 23 March 2010 |\n\nC-Mem., \u00b6 100.\n\nC-Mem., \u00b6 40.\n\nR-98, Ministerial Decision.\n\nR-99, Ministerial Decision.\n\nR-97, Ministerial Decision; R-111, Offering Circular.\n\nR-100, Ministerial Decision; R-112, Offering Circular.\n\nR-101, Ministerial Decision; R-110, Offering Circular.\n\n267.\n\nIt is also undisputed that Po\u0161tov\u00e1 banka acquired its interests in the GGBs on the secondary market and that these interests were held in Po\u0161tov\u00e1 banka's account with Clearstream, a universal depository.455\n\nMem., \u00b6 56; C-Mem., \u00b6 38. *See also* R-92; R-93; R-94; R-95 and R-96.\n\n268.\n\nUnder its general terms and conditions, applicable to the purchases made by Po\u0161tov\u00e1 banka, Clearstream opens an account for the deposit of securities of each of its customers.456 The securities received by Clearstream are treated as fungible457 and \" *[n]o Customer shall have any right to specific securities but, each Customer will instead be entitled, subject to these General Terms and Conditions, to require CBL* [Clearstream Banking, Luxembourg] *to deliver to the Customer or a third party an amount of securities of an issue equivalent to the amount credited to any securities account in the Customer's name, without regard to the certificate numbers of any securities certificates.* \"458\n\nR-116 Article 4.\n\nR-116 Article 7.\n\nR-116, Article 11.\n\n269.\n\nCleastream's general terms and conditions provide further for the obligation of Clearstream to \" *promptly transmit to the appropriate agent of the issuer any order received from a Customer constituting the exercise of a right, option or warrant held for the account of such Customer.* \"459\n\nR-116, Article 21.\n\n270.\n\nThe Parties debate whether, as a result of the aforesaid purchases, Po\u0161tov\u00e1 banka held GGBs, or \"interests\" in GGBs, or rights in a pool of fungible assets, and on whether GGBs and \"interests\" on GGBs are different securities subject to different treatment.\n\n271.\n\nPo\u0161tov\u00e1 banka initially classified in its accounting books and records the interests that it acquired in the GGBs as HTM and as AFS, and later on reclassified some GGBs from AFS to HTM.460 The Parties debate as to the whether such initial classification and further reclassification reflects an intent of having a long-term investment.\n\n*See* \u00b6 78 above.\n\n272.\n\nIt is uncontested that at the time of the purchases of the GGBs by Po\u0161tov\u00e1 banka, the Slovak regulator, NBS, had designated Eurozone bonds, including GGBs, as \"zero risk,\" so Po\u0161tov\u00e1 banka did not need to hold capital against them. However, in the market the GGBs had already been downgraded to BB+ by rating agencies.461\n\n*See* C-95.\n\n*1.3. The Sales and Assignments by Po\u0161tov\u00e1 Banka of Its Interests in the GGBs*\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n273.\n\nDuring 2011, Po\u0161tov\u00e1 banka sold all of its interests in the GGBs in its AFS portfolio. The sale comprised three of the five series of GGB interests it had bought (ISIN GR0124032666, ISIN GR0114023485 and ISIN GR0114020457), accounting for about 18% of the value of Po\u0161tov\u00e1 banka's GGBs holdings.462 Immediately after the sale, Po\u0161tov\u00e1 banka purchased GGB interests of the same series and in the same principal amounts, but for a different price.463 Po\u0161tov\u00e1 banka states that it made these trades to ensure that the bank met its statutory capital adequacy and capital exposure limits,464 as well as a way to book its losses related to GGBs in its profit and loss account.465\n\n*See* Tarda Witness Statement, \u00b6 17, C-Mem., \u00b6 46.\n\nMem., \u00b6\u00b6 73-75.\n\nTarda Witness Statement, \u00b6\u00b6 15-18.\n\nC-Mem., \u00b6 47.\n\n274.\n\nAlso, in 2011, through the Assignment Agreements, which involved J&T Finance and Istrokapital, Po\u0161tov\u00e1 banka assigned part of its interests in the GGBs to J&T Finance. The Assignment Agreements terminated or lost effect at a date that is the subject matter of debate between the Parties.\n\n275.\n\nClaimants assert, and Respondent does not dispute, that from the different dates of acquisition of the interests in the GGBs by Po\u0161tov\u00e1 banka up to the date in which the exchange became effective, Po\u0161tov\u00e1 banka received payments of capital and interest corresponding to the interests it held in the GGBs.466\n\nC-Mem., \u00b6 52; Tarda Witness Statement, \u00b6 13.\n\n*2. Article 1 of the Slovakia-Greece BIT*\n-----------------------------------------\n\n276.\n\nThe Tribunal will first determine whether, in light of the facts summarized above and the evidence in the record, the interests held by Po\u0161tov\u00e1 banka in the GGBs qualify as an investment under Article 1(1) of the Slovakia-Greece BIT.\n\n277.\n\nIf there is no protected investment under the Slovakia-Greece BIT, the dispute subject matter of this arbitration will not be a dispute related to an investment, as required in Article 10(1) of the Slovakia-Greece BIT which contains the consent of the parties to arbitration, and therefore such dispute will not fall under the jurisdiction of ICSID and the competence of this Tribunal under the aforementioned Article 25.\n\n278.\n\nArticle 1 (\" *Definitions* \") of the Slovakia-Greece BIT provides:\n\n*For the purposes of this Agreement:*\n\n*1. \"Investment\" means every kind of asset and in particular, though not exclusively includes:*\n\n*a) movable and immovable property and any other property rights such as mortgages, liens or pledges,*\n\n*b) shares in and stock and debentures of a company and any other form of participation in a company,*\n\n*c) loans, claims to money or to any performance under contract having a financial value,*\n\n*d) intellectual property rights, goodwill, technical processes and know-how, business concessions conferred by law or under contract, including concessions to search for, cultivate, extract or exploit natural resources.*\n\n*2. \"Returns\" means the amounts yielded by an investment and in particular, though not exclusively, includes profit, interest, capital gains, dividends, royalties and other fees.*\n\n*3. \"Investor\" shall comprise with regard to either Contracting Party:*\n\n*a) natural persons having the nationality of that Contracting Party in accordance with its law*\n\n*b) legal persons constituted in accordance with the law of that Contracting Party.*\n\n*4. \"Territory\" means in respect of either Contracting Party, the territory under its sovereignty as well as the territorial sea and submarine areas, over which* *that Contracting Party exercises, in conformity with international law, sovereign rights or jurisdiction.\"*\n\n279.\n\nAs summarized under paragraphs 127 to 132 above, Claimants claim that their interests in GGBs are included in what they consider a broad definition of \"investment\" contained in the chapeau of Article 1 of the Slovakia-Greece BIT, and under section (c) of the same article, because Claimants' interests in the GGBs are either \"loans\" or \"claims to money\" or both. In reading the Slovakia-Greece BIT, Claimants consider that there is no inherent meaning of investment under international law and that the Tribunal, pursuant to Article 31(4) of the VCLT must simply apply the special meaning ascribed to the term \"investment\" by the State parties to the Slovakia-Greece BIT.\n\n280.\n\nRespondent, in turn, considers that the term \"investment\" contained in the aforesaid chapeau of Article 1 has an inherent meaning under international law and that a correct interpretation of Article 31(4) of the VCLT leads to the conclusion that there is no special definition of the term \"investment\" under the treaty.\n\n281.\n\nArticles 31(1) and 31(2) of the VCLT require interpretation of a treaty:\n\n*\"(1)...in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in the light of its object and purpose.*\n\n*(2) The context for the purposes of the interpretation of a treaty shall comprise, in addition to the text, including its preamble and annexes: (a) any agreement related to the treaty which was made between all the parties in connection with the conclusion of the treaty; (b) any instrument which was made by one or more parties in connection with the conclusion of the treaty and accepted by the other parties as an instrument related to the treaty*.\"467\n\nVCLT, Articles 31(1) and 31(2).\n\n282.\n\nThe heading of Article 31 of the VCLT calls that article a \"general rule of interpretation\" meaning that the elements contained in Article 31(1) form a single rule of interpretation and may not be taken separately or in isolation. As indicated by the tribunal in *Aguas del Tunari v. Bolivia:*\n\n*\"Interpretation under Article 31 of the Vienna Convention is a process of progressive encirclement where the interpreter starts under the general rule with (1) the ordinary meaning of the terms of the treaty, (2) in their context and* *(3) in light of the treaty's object and purpose, and by cycling through this three step inquiry iteratively closes in upon the proper interpretation. In approaching this task, it is critical to observe two things about the general rule* (...). *First, the Vienna Convention does not privilege anyone of these three aspects of the interpretation method. The meaning of a word or phrase is not solely a matter of dictionary and linguistics*. (\u2026)\"468\n\n*Aguas del Tunari, S.A. v. Republic of Bolivia*, ICSID Case No. ARB/02/3, Decision on Respondent's Objections to Jurisdiction of October 21, 2005 (\" *Aguas del Tunari v. Bolivia* \"), \u00b6 91.\n\n283.\n\nIn other words, \" *the application of the means of interpretation in the article would be a single combined operation. All the various elements, as they were present in any given case, would be thrown in to the crucible, and their interaction would give the legally relevant interpretation.* \"469\n\nRL-80, Report of the International Law Commission on the work of its eighteenth session, [1966] Yearbook of the ILC, vol. II, part II, p. 219, \u00b6 8.\n\n284.\n\nIn the view of this Tribunal, an interpretation in good faith is not simply interpretation *bona fides,* as opposed to the absence of *mala fides,* or a principle providing for the rejection of an interpretation that is abusive or that may result in the abuse of rights. It also means that the interpretation requires elements of reasonableness that go beyond the mere verbal or purely literal analysis.\n\n285.\n\nThe chapeau of Article 1 of the Slovakia-Greece BIT provides that for the purposes of the treaty \" *[i]nvestment means every kind of asset and in particular, though not exclusively includes* : (\u2026).\" In turn section (c) of Article 1 refers to \" *loans, claims to money or to any performance under contract having a financial value.* \"\n\n286.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees with Claimants that the concept of \"investment\" as contained in Article 1 of the Slovakia-Greece BIT is a broad one. The BIT contains a broad asset-based concept of investment - as opposed to a closed or limitative concept - and considers that an investment includes \" *every kind of asset* \" comprising the examples of investments listed in Article 1.\n\n287.\n\nHowever, the Tribunal is not persuaded that a broad definition necessarily means that any and all categories, of any nature whatsoever, may qualify as an \"investment,\" nor that the only manner in which a category may be excluded as an investment, under a broad-asset based concept, is by express exclusion in the given treaty. The rule of interpretation of Article 31 of the VCLT must be applied to each treaty in particular, and not seeking to create general categories or classifications of treaties, depending on whether the definition is broad or closed.\n\n288.\n\nIt is true that when a treaty includes examples of categories that may constitute an investment, such as the ones contained in Article 1 of the Slovakia-Greece BIT, the structure of the treaty, as regards protected investments, is not that of a closed list or an exhaustive description of what may constitute an investment. But this does not mean that investor-State tribunals are authorized to expand the scope of the investments that the State parties intended to protect merely because the list of protected investments in the treaty is not a closed list. The rule of interpretation of Article 31 of the VCLT requires that the terms of the treaty be interpreted in good faith, and not only referring to the text but to the context, as well as considering the object and purpose of the treaty.\n\n289.\n\nSeveral treaties, including the Slovakia-Greece BIT, contain similar - and even identical - concepts of \"investment\" in the chapeau of the article that refers to protected investments. In fact, the same chapeau contained in Article 1 of the Slovakia-Greece BIT, with a broad asset-based concept, is repeated not only in a significant number of Greek BITs but also in a number of other treaties referred to in decisions repeatedly cited by the Parties to this arbitration.\n\n290.\n\nAs to Greek treaties, the same or similar chapeau is used, *inter alia*, in the BITs with Albania (1991),470 Romania (1991),471 Cyprus (1992), and Romania (1997).472\n\nRL-120, Agreement between the Government of the Hellenic Republic and the Government of the Republic of Albania for the Encouragement and Reciprocal Protection of Investment of August 1, 1991.\n\nCL-128, Agreement between the Government of the Hellenic Republic and the Government of Romania for the Promotion and Reciprocal Protection of Investments of September 16, 1991.\n\nRL-119, Agreement between the Government of the Hellenic Republic and the Government of the Republic of Romania on the Promotion and Reciprocal Protection of Investments of May 23, 1997.\n\n291.\n\nWith respect to decisions invoked by the Parties in this arbitration:\n\n\u2022 In *Fedax v.

In the above cited cases of Greek treaties, while some include, for example, the term \"loans,\" others refer to \"long term loans,\" others to loans \"connected to an investment\" and others - which is the case of the Cyprus-Greece BIT - exclude the term \"loan\" altogether. As for the treaties that served as bases for the decisions mentioned in 291 above, the examples vary significantly from one treaty to the other.\n\n293.\n\nInterpretation of a treaty in good faith, considering not only the text but also the context, requires that the interpreter provide some meaning to the examples and to the content of such examples as part of the context of the treaty. The interpretation in good faith, be it considered alone or in conjunction with the object and purpose of the treaty, embodies the principle of effectiveness (*ut res magis valeat quem pererat*). Preference should be given to an interpretation that provides meaning to all the terms of the treaty as opposed to one that does not. As indicated by the Appellate Body of the WTO:\n\n\" *We have also recognized, on several occasions, the principle of effectiveness in the interpretation of treaties (* ut res magis valeat quem pererat *) which requires that a treaty interpreter: \u2018...must give meaning and effect to all the terms of the treaty. An interpreter is not free to adopt a reading that would result in reducing whole clauses or paragraphs of a treaty to redundancy or inutility'. In light of the interpretative principle of effectiveness, it is the duty of any treaty interpreter to \u2018read all applicable provisions of a treaty in a way that gives meaning to all of them, harmoniously'. An important corollary of this principle is that a treaty should be interpreted as a whole, and, in particular, its sections and parts should be read as a whole.* \"480\n\nWorld Trade Organization, Report of the Appellate Body, *Korea - Definitive Safeguard Measure on* *Imports of Certain Dairy Products*, AB-1999-8, WT/DS98/AB/R, December 14, 1999, \u00b6\u00b6 80-81. (Emphasis and footnotes omitted), referenced in Isabelle Van Damme, TREATY INTERPRETATION BY THE WTO APPELLATE BODY (2009), at p. 286 (partially included as RL-82).\n\n294.\n\nThe list of examples provided by the Slovakia-Greece BIT must, thus, be considered in the context of the treaty and be given some meaning together. Otherwise, if the interpretation stops by simply indicating that any asset is an investment, the examples will be unnecessary, redundant or useless. Treaties are carefully drafted and negotiated, and the differences in the examples used in the treaties that contain a broad-based definition of assets are not fortuitous. States include categories of investments as examples for some purpose. Otherwise, it would be sufficient to define investment as any kind of assets of any nature without including examples of what may constitute an investment.\n\n295.\n\nThis does not mean that the list of examples becomes a closed or exhaustive list. Based on the understanding that the concept of asset is a broad one and the examples are such and not limitative lists, the examples altogether must be considered and given meaning to arrive at the proper interpretation of the treaty.\n\n296.\n\nThe reasoning of the tribunal in the decision of *Fedax v. Venezuela,* repeatedly invoked in this arbitration, assigned substantial weight to the wording of the list of examples contained in Article 1(1) of the BIT between Venezuela and the Netherlands. In the words of that tribunal:\n\n\" *It follows that, as contemplated by the Convention, the definition of* *\u2018investment' is controlled by consent of the Contracting Parties, and the* *particular definition set forth in Article 1 (a) of the Agreement is the one that governs the jurisdiction of ICSID:*\n\n*\u2018[T]he term Investments' shall comprise every kind of asset and more* *particularly though not exclusively:*\n\n*(ii) rights derived from shares, bonds, and other kinds of interests in companies and joint ventures;*\n\n*(iii) titles to money, to other assets or to any performance having an* *economic value...'*\n\n*This definition evidences that the Contracting Parties to the Agreement intended a very broad meaning for the term \u2018investment.'*  *The Tribunal notes in particular that titles to money in this definition are not in any way restricted to* *forms of direct foreign investment or portfolio investment,* *as argued by the Republic of Venezuela.*  *Some such restrictions may perhaps apply to other types of investment listed in such definition,* *such as rights derived from shares or other similar types of investment,*  *but they do not apply to the credit transactions of different categories that are embodied in the meaning of \u2018titles to money '* *as referred to in subparagraph (iii) of the definition set out above. It should be noted, moreover, that titles to money are not necessarily excluded from the concept of direct foreign investment.\"*481\n\n*Fedax v. Venezuela*, \u00b6\u00b6 31-32. (Emphasis added).\n\n297.\n\nThe *Fedax v. Venezuela* tribunal was not only persuaded by the broad context of the chapeau of the relevant provision, but by the inclusion in the list of assets that may constitute an investment of the term \"titles to money.\"\n\n298.\n\nIn the decision on jurisdiction and admissibility in *Abaclat v. Argentina*, cited by the Parties in this arbitration and invoked by Claimants to support the allegation that there is no inherent meaning for the term \"investment,\" the tribunal devotes several pages of reasoning to whether or not the term \" *obligaciones* \" (in the Spanish version) and \" *obligazioni\"* (in the Italian version) should be translated as \"obligations\" or as \"bonds\" and as to whether or not bonds, considering the wording in the examples provided under Article 1 of the Argentina-Italy BIT, qualified as an investment.\n\n299.\n\nIn its analysis of Article 1(1) of the Argentina-Italy BIT, and specifically in its review of the examples contained in the aforesaid Article, the *Abaclat* tribunal reasoned as follows:\n\n\" *According to the Tribunal\u2018s own English translation of Article 1(1) BIT, the term \u2018investment includes, without limitation':*\n\n*- lit. (a): \u2018movable and immovable goods, as well as any other right in rem, including - to the extent usable as investment - security rights on property of third parties;'*\n\n*- lit. (b): \u2018shares, company participations and any other form of participation, even if representing a minority or indirectly held, in companies established in the territory of a Contracting State;'*\n\n*- lit. (c): \u2018obligations, private or public titles or any other right to performances or services having economic value, including capitalized revenues;'*\n\n*- lit. (d): \u2018credits which are directly linked to an investment, which is constituted and documented in accordance with the provisions in force in the State where the investment is made;'*\n\n*- lit. (e): \u2018copyrights, intellectual or industrial property rights - such as invention patents, licenses, registered trademarks, secrets, industrial models and designs - as well as technical processes, transfer of technology, registered trade names and goodwill;'*\n\n*- lit. (f): \u2018any right of economic nature conferred under law or contract, as well as any license and concession granted in compliance with the applicable provisions applicable to the concerned economic activities, including the prospection, cultivation, extraction and exploitation of natural resources'.* \"\n\n(\u2026)\n\n*\"Firstly, this list covers an extremely wide range of investments, using a broad wording and referring to formulas such as \u2018independent of the legal form adopted,' or \u2018any other' kind of similar investment. It even contains a residual clause in lit. (f), encompassing \u2018any right of economic nature conferred under law or contract.' In other words, the definition provided for in Article 1(1) is not drafted in a restrictive way. Based on its wording, as well as on the broader aim of the BIT as described in the Preamble, Article 1(1) cannot be seen to have intended to adopt a restrictive approach with regard to what kind of activity or dealing was meant to qualify as an investment.*\n\n*\"Secondly, lit.(c) specifically addresses financial instruments. It is true that the term \u2018obligations' is a broad term and can refer to any kind of contractual obligation, i.e., debt, and it is also true that the term \u2018title' is also very broad. However, put in the context of the further terms listed in lit. (c) such as \u2018economic value' or \u2018capitalized revenue,' as well as considering that lit. (f) already deals with the more general concept of \u2018any right of economic nature,' lit. (c) is to be read as referring to the financial meaning of these terms. Thus, the term \u2018obligation' may be understood as referring to an economic value incorporated into a credit title representing a loan. This kind of obligations would in the English language more commonly be called \u2018bond,' rather than \u2018obligation.' Similarly, the term \u2018title' in Spanish and Italian would be more accurately translated into the English term of \u2018security,' which means nothing more than a fungible, negotiable instrument representing financial value.*\n\n\" *Thus, the Tribunal finds that the bonds, as defined above in \u00a7 11, constitute \u2018obligations' and/or at least \u2018public securities' in the sense of Article 1(1) lit. (c) of the BIT.*\n\n\" *With regard to the security entitlements that Claimants hold in these bonds, they also represent \u2018securities' in the sense of Article 1(1) lit. (c), since they constitute an instrument representing a financial value held by the holder of the security entitlement in the bond issued by Argentina.* \"482\n\n*Abaclat v. Argentina*, \u00b6 352 and \u00b6\u00b6 354-357.\n\n300.\n\nThe tribunal in *Abaclat v. Argentina,* thus, paid due regard to the list of examples contained in Article 1(1) of the Argentina-Italy BIT and was persuaded by the fact that the list, interpreted in context with the preamble and the chapeau of Article 1, (i) covered \" *an extremely wide range of investments, using a broad wording and referring to formulas such as \u2018independent of the legal form adopted.' or \u2018any other' kind of similar investment;* \"483 (ii) contained \" *a residual clause in lit. (f), encompassing \u2018any right of economic nature conferred under law or contract'* \";484 (iii) specifically addressed financial instruments because \" *the term \u2018obligation' may be understood as referring to an economic value incorporated into a credit title representing a loan*(...).\"485\n\n*Abaclat v. Argentina*, \u00b6 354.\n\n*Abaclat v. Argentina*, \u00b6 354.\n\n*Abaclat v. Argentina*, \u00b6 355.\n\n301.\n\nThe conclusion of the *Abaclat* tribunal was that the terms \"obligations\" and \"public securities\" were wide enough to encompass the bonds that were the subject of the dispute in that arbitration.\n\n302.\n\nThe *Ambiente Ufficio* tribunal also considered in detail the list of examples in Article 1(1) of the Argentina-Italy BIT as a key element to its conclusion that bonds are covered either because the word \" *obligaciones* \" or \" *obligatzioni* \" should be translated as bonds, or because what the tribunal calls a \"catch-all clause\" covers rights derived from law or contract.486\n\n*Ambiente Ufficio v. Argentina*, \u00b6\u00b6 488-495.\n\n303.\n\nIn sum, the decisions that have specifically analysed issues related to financial products similar to those at issue in this case have consistently considered the text of the list of categories that may constitute an investment as a definitive element to determine whether the activity or operation at stake may be considered an investment.\n\n304.\n\nThe language in the Slovakia-Greece BIT, as will be analysed below, is significantly different from the one that led the *Abaclat* and *Ambiente Ufficio* tribunals to conclude that government bonds were investments under the Argentina-Italy BIT.\n\n305.\n\nFirst, as opposed to the wide language quoted by the *Abaclat* tribunal from the Argentina-Italy BIT, that includes general formulas such as \" *independent of the legal form adopted,* \" the language used in the chapeau of Article 1(1) of the Slovakia-Greece BIT simply provides that \" *[i]nvestment means any type of asset and in particular, though not exclusively, includes* :.\"\n\n306.\n\nSecond, the list of examples of Article 1(1) of the Slovakia-Greece BIT, and particularly the sections invoked by Claimants in support of their interpretation of the relevant BIT, are substantially different from the ones invoked by the *Abaclat* and *Ambiente Ufficio* tribunals under the Argentina-Italy BIT. Article 1(c) of the Argentina-Italy BIT, invoked by the *Abaclat* and *Ambiente Ufficio* tribunals as the basis for their conclusion, includes amongst the illustrative list of what may constitute an investment *\"obligations, private*  *or public* *titles or any other right to performances or services having economic value, including capitalized revenues.* \" (Emphasis added) In contrast, Article 1.1(c) of the Slovakia-Greece BIT refers to \" *loans, claims to money or to any performance under contract having a financial value.* \" There is no reference in the Slovakia-Greece BIT to a general concept such as \"obligations,\" much less to \"public titles.\"\n\n307.\n\nThird, the Slovakia-Greece BIT does not contain the wide language that the *Abaclat* tribunal considered as language that would comprise bonds, i.e., \" *any right of economic nature conferred under law or contract.* \" \"Any right of an economic nature\" is a wider concept than claims to money under contract.\n\n308.\n\nA wide term like \" *obligations* \" - particularly in the context in which it must be understood in civil law systems - and a reference to \" *private or public titles\"* may well lead, as it seems to have led the *Abaclat* and *Ambiente Ufficio* tribunals, to the conclusion that a Government bond is generally an obligation and specifically a public title. However, the same conclusion may not be reached when a treaty, interpreted in accordance with the rules of interpretation of the VCLT, includes less encompassing language.\n\n309.\n\nThe preamble of the Slovakia-Greece BIT indicates that the State parties entered into the BIT\n\n\" *DESIRING to intensify their economic cooperation to the mutual benefit of both countries on a long term basis;*\n\n\" *HAVING as their objective to create favorable conditions for investments by investors of either Party in the territory of the other Party;*\n\n\" *RECOGNIZING that the promotion and protection of investment, on the basis of the present Agreement, will stimulate the initiative in this field.* \"\n\n310.\n\nThe objective of the Slovakia-Greece BIT, as pleaded by Claimants, is for the State parties to the treaty to create favorable conditions for investments by investors. But this does not mean that, in case of doubt, the treaty must be interpreted in favor of the investor, or that protecting investments is the sole purpose of the treaty. The State parties, in addition to expressing their desire to intensify their mutual cooperation (first section of the Preamble), agree that it is necessary to create favorable conditions to investors (second section of the Preamble) and then recognize that the promotion and protection of investment \" *on the basis of the present Agreement, will stimulate the initiative in this field* \" (third section of the Preamble). The conclusion seems obvious: the promotion and protection of the investments made by the investor of one State party in the territory of the other State party is \" *on the basis* \" of the Slovakia-Greece BIT, i.e., subject to the terms of the BIT.\n\n311.\n\nThe terms of the BIT are contained in its 13 articles, which start with the chapeau of Article 1(1) which, as already mentioned, provides that \"[i] *nvestment means every kind of asset and in particular, but not exclusively, includes:* \" The chapeau is followed by a list of what, \"in particular, but not exclusively,\" the parties to the treaty deem included as an \"investment.\"\n\n312.\n\nIf the chapeau of Article 1(1) is interpreted in isolation, in a mere literal manner or solely in conjunction with Article 1(1)(c), it would mean that: (i) any asset of any nature whatsoever would qualify as an investment under the Slovakia-Greece BIT; but (ii) that the list contained in Article 1(1) of the BIT would be useless or meaningless. An interpretation of the chapeau, considering its text and context within Article 1(1) of the BIT, and the object and purpose of the treaty, as required by the VCLT, leads to a different result.\n\n313.\n\nArticle 1(1) of the Slovakia-Greece BIT initially provides for a broad concept by indicating that investment \" *means any kind of asset.* \" But then uses the words \" *and in particular* \" (which means, specifically or especially distinguished from others; a term used to show that a statement applies to one person or thing more than any other),487 followed by the words \" *but not exclusively, includes,* \" and a list of what is included. Article 1(1) of the BIT provides, thus, for a broad concept of investment, that it then qualifies to indicate that the term applies especially to a specific group or category (the list contained in sections (a) to (d)), which group or category is not closed, or limited or restrictive.\n\n*See, e.g*.: \"particular.\" Merriam Webster Dictionary (online version) http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/particular?show=0&t=1423065666 (retrieved January 30, 2015); \"in particular.\" Oxford Dictionary (online version) http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/es/definicion/ingles/in-particular?q=in+particular (retrieved January 30, 2015).\n\n314.\n\nIn other words, an interpretation of the text and context of Article 1(1) leads the Tribunal to consider that the State parties to the treaty wanted an ample definition of what could constitute an investment, but within certain categories that are also broad, but not unlimited. Otherwise, the examples could be expanded to include any asset whatsoever, and would become useless or meaningless.\n\n315.\n\nThe categories selected by the State parties must be considered in determining if an asset, that may constitute an investment, is included in the categories of investments selected by the States. In such consideration, the Tribunal must balance the broadness of the categories with the limits that result from their inclusion in the treaty.\n\n316.\n\nBased on the above, an interpretation of Article 1 (1) of the Slovakia-Greece BIT requires a determination of whether Po\u0161tov\u00e1 banka's interests in the GGBs fit within the specific, but wide, category or group of investments listed in sections (a) to (f), and specifically a determination as to whether, in the words of Claimants, the GGBs \" *fall* *squarely within Article 1.1 (c) of the Slovakia-Greece BIT (\"loans, claims to money or to any performance under contract having a financial value\")* (\u2026).\"488\n\nC-Mem., \u00b6 92.\n\n317.\n\nThe Tribunal has no doubt and the Parties do not seem to dispute that, on the one hand, the GGBs constitute sovereign debt, and on the other, that they are securities.489\n\nMem., \u00b6 60; Hearing, Tr., 95:5-9.\n\n318.\n\nSovereign debt, as indebtedness of a sovereign State, has special features and characteristics. First, it is clearly a method of financing government operations, from investments in infrastructure to ordinary government expenditures.\n\n319.\n\nSecond, it is a key instrument of monetary and economic policy (e.g., indebtedness may be incurred to avoid either the issuance of fresh money - that may create hyperinflation - or an increase in taxes; or, as in the case at hand, for political reasons, regulators may decide to rate sovereign debt at zero risk despite the rating of the debt in the market).\n\n320.\n\nThird, sovereign debt is subject to a high degree of political influence and risk. A sovereign State engages in much more complex decisions, both in negotiating and structuring the debt and in payment thereof, and repayment is subject not only to the normal credit risk of any credit operation, but also to political decisions that are extremely sensitive for the inhabitants of the given State, such as a tax increase or a reduction in public expenditure or investment to repay the sovereign debt. Moreover, given the above considerations, it has been hotly debated whether sovereign indebtedness is an act of the sovereign or a commercial operation.490\n\n*See, e.g*.: *Republic of Argentina v. Weltover, Inc.,* 504 U.S. 607 (1992), *Borri v. Argentina*, Cass., sez. un., 27 May 2005 **,** n. 11225, 88 RIVISTA DI DIRITTO INTERNAZIONALE 856 (2005) cited in: Michael Waibel, *Opening Pandora's Box: Sovereign Bonds In International Arbitration*, American Journal of International Law (2007), Vol. 101, p. 711, at fn 113.\n\n321.\n\nFourth, while ordinary credits generally embody the interest of the main parties to the credit agreement - debtor and creditor - and the influence of third parties is limited, sovereign debt is highly influenced to different degrees by both internal and external factors.\n\n322.\n\nFifth, the only security for the creditors of sovereign debt is normally the full faith and credit of the given State. Moreover, as a general rule there is no strict seniority in sovereign debt issues and therefore, existing creditors may see their debt \"diluted\" by subsequent new bond issuances.\n\n323.\n\nLast, but not least, creditors have much more limited legal resources if a sovereign debtor fails to make a contracted payment considering issues of immunity that only apply to sovereigns.\n\n324.\n\nIn sum, sovereign debt is an instrument of government monetary and economic policy and its impact at the local and international levels makes it an important tool for the handling of social and economic policies of a State. It cannot, thus, be equated to private indebtedness or corporate debt.\n\n325.\n\nAs regards government bonds, the facts presented and documented by the Parties in this case confirm that they are securities and as such are subject to specific and strict regulations.\n\n326.\n\nAn issuance of bonds in the European context requires that an offer of securities to the public within the territory of an EU Member State must be preceded by the publication of a prospectus and that the publication of the prospectus is made subject to the approval of the competent authority of the home Member State, in this case the Respondent.491 Approval of the prospectus is subject to specific requirements under the law of the issuing State and must consider the applicable laws of the State or States where the bonds will be traded. Moreover, the bonds may need to include or exclude certain provisions or disclaimers so as to prevent the application of strict legislation of States where the bonds will be traded.492\n\nR-110; R-111; R-112; R-113; R-114.\n\nThe Offering Circular for the GGBs (*see e.g.*, R-110) provides: \" *The distribution of this Offering Circular and the offer or sale of Bonds may be restricted by law in certain jurisdictions. The Republic and the Managers do not represent that this document may be lawfully distributed or that the Bonds may be lawfully offered, in compliance with any applicable registration or other requirements in any such jurisdiction, or pursuant to an exemption available thereunder, or assume any responsibility for facilitating any such distribution or offering.

See \u2018Subscription and Sale* '.\" R-110, p. 2.\n\n327.\n\nThe evidence submitted by the Parties, including the expert reports, describes in detail the operation of bonds in the primary and secondary markets and the fact that bonds are easily tradable on the secondary market, with clearing houses acting as intermediaries or as administrators, but under contract with the bondholders.493 As a result, creditors change many times during the life of the bond, and there is no requirement to notify or inform the issuing State about the changes of holders in the secondary market.\n\nMem., \u00b6 56; Stulz Report, \u00b6\u00b6 22-25; Hubbard Report, \u00b6\u00b6 43-45.\n\n328.\n\nBonds issued by a Sovereign are subject to ratings by rating agencies and to a continuous monitoring of the State's credit rating (which in turn varies depending on a number of factors, including changes in the government, the adoption of economic measures, including tax measures, and variation in the international prices of commodities produced by the given State).\n\n329.\n\nThe requirements, characteristics and tradability of the GGBs are amply documented in the record. The Tribunal has no doubt that GGBs are sovereign debt, in the form of securities, in general, and bonds, in particular, that are subject to strict requirements in their issuance. These securities are heavily regulated not only by the issuing State, but in the markets where they are traded, including measures adopted by the banking regulators and rules on to how they should be accounted for and rated for purposes of the balance sheet of the bondholders subject to special regulations, such as the case of Po\u0161tov\u00e1 banka.\n\n330.\n\nThe question that the Tribunal must address is, therefore, whether the wide list of investments provided for under Article 1(1) of the Slovakia-Greece BIT includes sovereign debt in general and, if so, the GGBs in particular.\n\n331.\n\nIt is clear to the Tribunal that the list of investments contained in Article 1(1) of the Slovakia-Greece BIT does not include the language of the Italy-Argentina BIT from which the *Abaclat* tribunal derived its conclusions on admissibility and jurisdiction, and specifically, does not contain any reference to \"obligations\" or to \"securities,\" much less to *public* titles or obligations.\n\n332.\n\nNeither Article 1(1) of the Slovakia-Greece BIT nor other provisions of the treaty refer, in any way, to sovereign debt, public titles, public securities, public obligations or the like. The Slovakia-Greece BIT does not contain language that may suggest that the State parties considered, in the wide category of investments of the list of Article 1(1) of the BIT, public debt or public obligations, much less sovereign debt, as an investment under the treaty.\n\n333.\n\nThe only reference to bonds in the Slovakia-Greece BIT is in Article 1(1)(b) which refers to *\"shares in and stock and*  *debentures of a company* *and any other form of participation in a company\"* (emphasis added). The text leaves no doubt that the bonds referred to under Article 1(1)(b) are only bonds issued by a company - debentures of a company - not sovereign debt in general, or bonds issued by either State party to the treaty, in particular. Respondent argues, and the Tribunal agrees, that sovereign bonds are different from forms of participation in corporations, and therefore their exclusion from the definition of investment in a given treaty indicates that the contracting parties did not intend to cover these types of assets.494\n\n*See* Hearing, Tr., 441:9-442:4: \" *There is a fundamental difference between shares, corporate bonds and other forms of participation in a company on the one hand and sovereign bonds on the other hand. Shares and corporate bonds are associated with a commercial undertaking in the host State. Now, a Shareholder owns part of the company, and a corporate bond is a claim to a portion of the company's profit. Now, sovereign bonds, by contrast, are not associated with the commercial undertaking in the host State. They typically serve general budgetary purposes. Well, there are important differences between corporate bonds on the one hand and sovereign bonds even at the time of the issuance of the sovereign bonds, and this is particularly so with respect to sovereign bonds that are not linked with specific economic activity in the host State such as the Greek Government Bonds at issue in this arbitration.* \"\n\n334.\n\nIt is indeed telling that the State parties have specifically referred under section (b) to \"any form of participation in a company,\" which includes bonds, but is clearly limited to bonds issued by companies, and have not included bonds in general under section (c) or in any other provision of the treaty. The provisions of treaties are, as both Parties recognize,495 carefully and extensively negotiated. The express inclusion of debentures issued by companies and the omission of any other reference to bonds or to public obligations in the treaty must be given some meaning for purposes of the interpretation of the text and context of the treaty.\n\nC-Mem., \u00b6 92; Hearing, Tr., 440:13-443:8.\n\n335.\n\nIt is therefore clear that in the context of the Slovakia-Greece BIT, and particularly in Article 1(1)(b) the State parties considered some types of bonds as investments, but the reference to bonds is limited to bonds issued by a company.\n\n336.\n\nIn Article 1(1)(c) of the Slovakia-Greece BIT, the State parties to the treaty included \"loans\" as an example of an investment and Claimants consider that such term includes the GGBs. The wide interpretation of the text of Article 1(1)(c) proposed by Claimants considers that the GGBs, which are securities, bonds, clearly fit into the category of investments described in the words \" *loans, claims to money or to any performance under contract having a financial value.\"* The Tribunal disagrees.\n\n337.\n\nLoans and bonds are distinct financial products. The creditor in a loan is generally a bank or group of banks, normally identified in the pertinent agreement. Bonds are generally held by a large group of creditors, generally anonymous. Moreover, unlike creditors in a loan, the creditors of bonds may change several times in a matter of days or even hours, as bonds are traded. The tradability of loans or syndicated loans is generally limited, and precisely because loans are generally not tradable, they are not subject to the restrictions or regulations that apply to securities.\n\n338.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees with Respondent that loans involve contractual privity between the lender and the debtor, while bonds do not involve contractual privity. The lender has a direct relationship with the debtor - in the case of public debt, the State - as party to the same contract - the loan agreement - while in the issuance of bonds the contractual relationship of the State is with the intermediaries - in the case at hand with the Participants and the Primary Dealers. The holders of the bonds - the ultimate creditors, holders of the bonds - have a contractual relationship with the intermediary or the clearing house where the bonds are acquired or both.\n\n339.\n\nThe facts of this case and particularly the various operations undertaken by Po\u0161tov\u00e1 banka with the GGBs confirm the above. Po\u0161tov\u00e1 banka acquired the GGBs under a contract with Clearstream, sold the GGBs back through Clearstream under the same contract. Thereafter, Po\u0161tov\u00e1 banka assigned rights to the GGBs to third parties under the Assignment Agreements and then terminated such agreements pursuant to a Settlement Agreement. It treated the GGBs as bonds in its financial statements for the purposes that have been amply debated in this arbitration. If Po\u0161tov\u00e1 banka had granted a loan to Greece, as opposed to having acquired bonds in the secondary market, it would have had a direct contractual relationship with Greece, and the fast tradability of the bonds - without involving Greece - which allowed Po\u0161tov\u00e1 banka to sell, repurchase, assign and reverse the assignment, in some cases in matter of hours, without even informing the State debtor in any step of the operation, would not have been possible.\n\n340.\n\nAgain, the specific use of the term \"debentures\" only for debt issued by companies in Article 1(1)(b) of the Slovakia-Greece BIT and the specific use of the term \"loans\" in another section of the Slovakia-Greece BIT, Article 1(1)(c), together with the lack of reference to any sort of public indebtedness, leads the Tribunal to consider that the Parties to the treaty did not intend to treat government securities, such as the GGBs, as investments for purposes of the BIT.\n\n341.\n\nIn connection with \" *claims to money*,\" the other category of investments in Article 1(1)(c) of the BIT which Claimants deem to include GGBs, the Tribunal again disagrees with the interpretation of Claimants for several reasons.\n\n342.\n\nFirst, a Tribunal should not lightly expand the language of a treaty so as to conclude that a general reference to \" *claims to money* \" includes bonds or other securities issued by a State, where there is no indication that the State parties intended to do so.\n\n343.\n\nSecond, the text of Article 1(1)(c) of the Slovakia-Greece BIT considers as an investment *\"claims to money or to any performance*  *under contract having a financial value* \" (emphasis added). Therefore the investment consists of a claim to money, or a claim to performance, under a contract having a financial value. In other words, the claim to money must arise under a contractual relationship.\n\n344.\n\nThe contractual relationships in the issuance by Greece in the primary market and the purchase by Po\u0161tov\u00e1 banka in the secondary market have been widely discussed. Greece had a contractual relationship with the Participants and the Primary Dealers for the issuance and distribution of the GGBs. It is undisputed that Po\u0161tov\u00e1 banka was not a Participant or a Primary Dealer, and that it therefore had no contractual relationship with Respondent in connection with such issuance and distribution. Po\u0161tov\u00e1 banka acquired its interests in the GGBs through a transaction with Clearstream, governed by the laws of Luxembourg, which governed, inter alia, the opening of the corresponding account for the purchase and sale of the GGBs.\n\n345.\n\nUnder Greek Law 2198 of 1994 and the documents governing the issuance and trade of the GGBs, the rights of Po\u0161tov\u00e1 banka - like the rights of other bondholders - were rights against the Participants. There is nothing in the record that even suggests that there was a contractual relationship between Respondent and Po\u0161tov\u00e1 banka. Po\u0161tov\u00e1 banka had certain rights against the Greek Government under the terms of the GGBs, as discussed below, but such rights would only become exercisable against Respondent in one specific circumstance: the Greek Government's failure to pay due interest and principal on securities to the Bank of Greece.496\n\nR-108, Article 8.2.\n\n346.\n\nEven if, as suggested by Claimants, the issuance of the GGBs and the sales in the secondary market constitute one single economic operation, the Tribunal is not convinced that even the fact of considering such unified operation would result in Po\u0161tov\u00e1 banka having a claim to money under contract against Respondent.\n\n347.\n\nThe record indicates that Po\u0161tov\u00e1 banka never entered into a contract with Respondent and its contractual relationship under the GGBs was exclusively with the Participants through Clearstream. In other words, the \" *claim to money* \" would not result from a contract between Po\u0161tov\u00e1 banka and Respondent.\n\n348.\n\nPo\u0161tov\u00e1 banka holds a right in a title - *a right in rem* - against the Participants, and would have rights against Greece, not arising from a contract with Respondent, but from the title and the consequences provided therein in case the Greek Government fails to pay principal and interest to the Bank of Greece pursuant to the terms of Law 2198 of 1994.\n\n349.\n\nSince Po\u0161tov\u00e1 banka does not have a claim to money under contract having a financial value, it does not have an investment for purposes of Article 1(1) of the BIT.\n\n350.\n\nThe Tribunal accordingly concludes that neither of the Claimants is an investor with an investment as defined in Article 1(1) (c) of the Slovakia-Greece BIT and in Article 1(1) (c) of the Cyprus-Greece BIT. Based on the above analysis, the Tribunal concludes that it lacks jurisdiction *ratione materiae* to entertain this dispute. In light of this conclusion, the Tribunal does not deem it necessary to examine the remaining objections to jurisdiction advanced by Respondent, concerning absence of jurisdiction *ratione personae* and *ratione temporis,* nor the allegations concerning abuse of process and the umbrella clause.\n\n**2. Analysis of the Tribunal's Jurisdiction Under the Washington Convention**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**a. The Tribunal Need Not Determine Whether It Would Have Jurisdiction Under the Washington Convention in the Circumstances of the Case**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n351.\n\nThe Tribunal's conclusion concerning the definition of \"investment\" under the Slovakia-Greece BIT in Section VI.1 above makes it unnecessary for the Tribunal to resolve the dispute between the Parties concerning whether Po\u0161tov\u00e1 banka's GGBs would be considered investments as that term is used in the Washington (ICSID) Convention. Because the Parties have devoted significant attention to that issue, however, the Tribunal feels it appropriate to refer to such disagreement.497\n\nThe Tribunal here takes a similar approach as in *Plama Consortium Limited v. Bulgaria* where the tribunal explained that:  \n \" *The Parties have extensively documented their allegations; numerous exhibits, witness statements and expert reports have been submitted by both Parties. The factual and legal arguments have been discussed in detail during the Final Hearing, in which a number of witnesses and experts were also examined by the Parties and the arbitrators. The Tribunal has therefore decided that, in acknowledgement of the Parties' efforts, it will consider their further allegations on the merits.* \" *Plama Consortium Limited v. Bulgaria*, ICSID Case No. ARB/03/24, Award of August 27, 2008, \u00b6 147.\n\n352.\n\nAccording to Article 25(1) of the Washington Convention:\n\n*\"The jurisdiction of the Centre shall extend to any legal dispute arising directly out of an investment, between a Contracting State (or any constituent subdivision or agency of a Contracting State designated to the Centre by that State) and a national of another Contracting State, which the parties to the dispute consent in writing to submit to the Centre. When the parties have given their consent, no party may withdraw its consent unilaterally.* \"\n\nIt is well known that the drafters of the Washington Convention intentionally chose not to include a definition of investment within that convention.498\n\n*See MHS Annulment*, \u00b6\u00b6 65-71.\n\n353.\n\nIn a number of well-known cases, tribunals have attempted to deal with this omission of a definition by articulating what they have called \"objective criteria\" for the definition of the term \"investment\" that are said to flow from the object and purpose of the ICSID Convention. Those tribunals have concluded that such criteria cannot be set aside by a consent that may have been given in another legal instrument, such as a BIT. An example of such an approach is the one taken by the *ad hoc* Committee in the Patrick *Mitchell v. Congo* annulment proceeding, which expressed its understanding of the limits of the notion of investment in the following terms:\n\n\"[*T*]*he parties to an agreement and the States which conclude an investment treaty cannot open the jurisdiction of the Centre to any operation they might arbitrarily qualify as an investment. It is thus repeated that, before ICSID arbitral tribunals,* *the Washington Convention has supremacy over an agreement between the parties or a BIT.* \"499\n\n*Patrick Mitchell v. Democratic Republic of Congo*, ICSID Case No. ARB/99/7, Decision on the Application for Annulment of the Award of November 1, 2006, \u00b6 31.\n\n354.\n\nThe same position was articulated in *Phoenix* :\n\n\" *At the outset, it should be noted that BITs, which are bilateral arrangements between two States parties, cannot contradict the definition of the ICSID Convention. In other words, they can confirm the ICSID notion or restrict it, but they cannot expand it in order to have access to ICSID. A definition included in a BIT being based on a test agreed between two States cannot set aside the definition of the ICSID Convention, which is a multilateral agreement. As long as it fits within the ICSID notion, the BIT definition is acceptable, it is not if it falls outside of such definition. For example, if a BIT would provide that ICSID arbitration is available for sales contracts which do not imply any investment, such a provision could not be enforced by an ICSID tribunal.* \"500\n\n*Phoenix v. Czech Republic*, \u00b6 96. (Footnotes omitted). *See also* \u00b6 82.\n\n355.\n\nOther tribunals have taken the position that it is not so much the term \"investment\" in the ICSID Convention as the term \"investment\" *per se* that should be considered as having an objective meaning in itself, whether it is mentioned in the ICSID Convention or in a BIT. For example, the tribunal in *Romak S.A. v. Uzbekistan*, conducting its proceedings on the basis of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules, observed as follows:\n\n\" *The term \u2018investment' has a meaning in itself that cannot be ignored when considering the list contained in Article 1(2) of the BIT.*\n\n*[...] The Arbitral Tribunal therefore considers that the term \u2018investments' under the BIT has an inherent meaning (irrespective of whether the investor resorts to ICSID or UNCITRAL arbitral proceedings) entailing a*  *contribution* *that extends over a*  *certain, period of time* *and that involves some*  *risk* *[...]. By their nature, asset types enumerated in the BIT's non-exhaustive list may exhibit these hallmarks. But if an asset does not correspond to the inherent definition of \"investment,\" the fact that it falls within one of the categories listed in Article 1 does not transform it into an \u2018investment.' In the general formulation of the tribunal in* Azinian, \u2018labeling... is no substitute for analysis.'\"501\n\n*Romak S.A. v. The Republic of Uzbekistan* (PCA Case No. AA280), Award of November 26, 2009, \u00b6 180 and \u00b6 207. (Emphasis in the original). *See also KT Asia v. Kazakhstan*.\n\n356.\n\nIn sum, the aforementioned tribunals seem to have developed an understanding to the effect that some core elements characterize an investment, whether these are considered as a general framework or as jurisdictional requirements. According to such test, an investment requires a contribution of money or assets, duration and risk, which elements form part of the objective definition of the term \"investment.\"\n\n357.\n\nOn the other hand, insofar as BIT arbitration under the ICSID Convention is concerned, it has also been held in a number of well-known cases that, because the ICSID Convention provides no definition of the term \"investment,\" the limits of this concept are susceptible to agreement between the State parties to a BIT, and that the definition of investment in a BIT providing for arbitration under the auspices of ICSID supplies the definition missing from the Washington Convention. Such definitions have been described as following a \"subjective\" approach adopted by such States in the instruments (whether BITs or national legislation) which embody their consent to ICSID jurisdiction. As stated by the tribunal in the *CSOB* case, under this approach, the consent of the State parties as to what constitutes an investment is of primary importance:\n\n*\"[I]nvestment as a concept should be interpreted broadly because the drafters of the Convention did not impose any restrictions on its meaning. Support for a liberal interpretation of the question whether a particular transaction constitutes an investment is also found in the first paragraph of the Preamble to the Convention, which declares that \u2018the Contracting States [are] considering the need for international cooperation for economic development, and the role of private international investment therein.'*\n\n*[...]*\n\n*It follows that an important element in determining whether a dispute qualifies as an investment under the Convention in any given case is the specific consent given* *by the Parties. The Parties' acceptance of the Centre's jurisdiction with respect to* *the rights and obligations arising out of their agreement therefore creates a strong presumption that they considered their transaction to be an investment within the meaning of the ICSID Convention.* \"502\n\n*CSOB v. Slovakia*, \u00b6\u00b6 64-66.\n\n358.\n\nOthers have been more blunt. In *Malaysian Historical Salvors v. Malaysia*, the *ad hoc* Committee observed that:\n\n\"*It is those bilateral and multilateral treaties which today are the engine of ICSID's effective jurisdiction. To ignore or depreciate the importance of the jurisdiction they bestow upon ICSID, and rather to embroider upon questionable interpretations of the term \"investment\" as found in Article 25(1) of the Convention, risks crippling the institution.* \"503\n\n*MHS Annulment*, \u00b6 73.\n\n359.\n\nGiven the Tribunal's conclusion that the definition of investment in the BIT at issue in this case does not extend to Po\u0161tov\u00e1 banka's GGBs, this is a controversy that this Tribunal does not need to resolve. The Tribunal has considered both approaches, but does not need to choose between the \"objective\" approach, which would give the term \"investment\" an inherent meaning, and a \"subjective\" approach based on the will of State parties, as expressed in the BIT.\n\n**b. If an Objective Approach were applied, a Majority of the Tribunal Would Find That Claimants Do Not Have an Investment Under the Washington Convention504**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nArbitrator Townsend does not agree with the reasoning or the conclusions stated in this section and therefore does not join in this portion (Section VI.2.b) of the Award.\n\n360.\n\nThe Tribunal, by majority, believes that an analysis applying the \"objective\" test, as pleaded by the Parties, would lead to the same conclusion with respect to Po\u0161tov\u00e1 banka GGBs as the Tribunal reached in its analysis of the \"subjective\" test under the BIT. The members of the Tribunal who conclude that, if the Tribunal were to analyse the GGB interests in light of the \"objective\" test - contribution, duration, risk - the Claimants would not have an investment under the ICSID Convention, would place particular emphasis on the following circumstances.\n\n361.\n\nIf an \"objective\" test is applied, in the absence of a contribution to an economic venture, there could be no investment. An investment, in the economic sense, is linked with a process of creation of value,505 which distinguishes it clearly from a sale,506 which is a process of exchange of values or a subscription to sovereign bonds which is also a process of exchange of values *i.e.* a process of providing money for a given amount of money in return. If the idea that the contribution, as an element of investment, has to be involved in an economic operation creating value is accepted, would this be the situation considering the concrete facts of the case?\n\nTo be entirely accurate, it should be said \"a process of purported creation of value,\" in order to take into account failed investments which must still be considered investments.\n\nIn a sale there is also a contribution of goods or services by the seller and a contribution of money by the buyer, but this is different from the contribution to an economic venture required in order to find an investment.\n\n362.\n\nA State is not primarily an economic actor engaged in economic ventures in the sense just developed. The State enters into numerous sales contracts to run its different administrations, it pays its civil servants, it ensures the functioning of its embassies, refinances part of its foreign debt (which could imply that the sums raised are not used in the territory of Greece, and possibly do not even pass through Greece's territory, but are sent to the different financial places where Greece had debts, possibly through compensation schemes) and so on.\n\n363.\n\nThe Claimants have not argued that the money Po\u0161tov\u00e1 banka paid for the GGB interests, even if considered as ultimately benefitting Greece, was used in economically productive activities. Rather, it appears that the funds were used for Greece's budgetary needs, and particularly for repaying its debts, as acknowledged both in the written submissions and at the Hearing:\n\n\" *Greece's ability to raise these funds from investors was critical to its funding of its* *government budget, particularly as it was discovered years after the fact that Greek officials had underreported the country 's budget deficit when applying for entry into the Eurozone in 2001.\"507*\n\n*\"Greece heavily relied on the capital raised by its bond offerings*  *to fund its government budget.\"* *508*\n\n*Greece took the funds raised through its issuance and it used it*  *to fund more debt*  *and it used it*  *to fund its other budgetary obligations* *.*509\n\nC-Mem., \u00b6 4. (Emphasis added).\n\nC-Mem., \u00b6 30. (Emphasis added).\n\nHearing, Tr., 116:6-8. (Emphasis added).\n\n364.\n\nFor the purposes of ascertaining jurisdiction, prior decisions have distinguished between sovereign bonds that are used for general funding purposes and those used for public works or services. Michael Waibel referred to two mixed commission cases in the following terms:\n\n*\"(\u2026) Two mixed-commission cases dealing with sovereign bonds do suggest, however, a distinction between physical and intangible assets; jurisdiction was found only for those sovereign bonds used for public works or services rendered to the government, as opposed to those issued for general budgetary purposes of the issuing country. In* Companie G\u00e9n\u00e9rale des Eaux de Caracas *, the commission accepted jurisdiction over Venezuelan bearer bonds, issued to the Belgian claimant CGE, to finance public works. The direct link between bonds issued as payment for property transferred and services rendered to the government overcame the presumption of no jurisdiction. In* Boccardo *, the commission accepted jurisdiction where the claimant had received bonds in exchange for merchandise furnished*.\"510\n\nRL-27: Michael Waibel, *Opening Pandora's Box: Sovereign Bonds In International Arbitration*, American Journal of International Law (2007), Vol. 101, p. 711, pp.743-744.\n\n365.\n\nThe same approach has been adopted by ICSID tribunals, in *Fedax v. Venezuela,* where promissory notes were considered as investments because they were issued by the Republic of Venezuela in connection with a contract for the provision of services, in *CSOB v. Slovakia*, where a loan was considered as an investment, only because it was part of an overall economic operation of restructuring of CSOB and development of the bank. And in cases where the financial instruments were not linked with an economic venture, ICSID tribunals have not considered them as investments on their own, like for example in *Joy Mining v. Egypt,* where a bank guarantee which was not linked with a contract that could qualify as an investment was not considered as an investment, or in *Alps Finance v. Slovak Republic,* where the tribunal decided that, because the underlying contract having given rise to some receivables was not an investment, the receivables themselves could not be considered as investments.\n\n366.\n\nAs far as the element of duration is concerned, the Tribunal has been convinced by the evidence in the proceedings that such element is present in the GGBs acquired by Po\u0161tov\u00e1 banka.\n\n367.\n\nUnder an \"objective\" test, the element of risk is essential and cannot be analysed in isolation. Indeed any economic transaction - it could even be said any human activity - entails some element of risk. Risk is inherent in life and cannot *per se* qualify what is an investment.\n\n368.\n\nThe investment risk, for purposes of the application of an \"objective\" test, was defined by the *Romak* tribunal as follows:\n\n*\"All economic activity entails a certain degree of risk. As such, all contracts -including contracts that do not constitute an investment - carry the risk of nonperformance. However, this kind of risk is pure commercial, counterparty risk, or, otherwise stated, the risk of doing business generally. It is therefore not an element that is useful for the purpose of distinguishing between an investment and a commercial transaction.*\n\n*An \u2018investment risk' entails a different kind of alea, a situation in which the investor cannot be sure of a return on his investment, and may not know the amount he will end up spending, even if all relevant counterparties discharge their contractual obligations. Where there is \u2018risk' of this sort, the investor simply cannot predict the outcome of the transaction.* \"511\n\n*Romak v. Uzbekistan*, \u00b6\u00b6 229-230.\n\n369.\n\nIn other words, under an \"objective\" approach, an investment risk would be an operational risk and not a commercial risk or a sovereign risk. A commercial risk covers, *inter alia*, the risk that one of the parties might default on its obligation, which risk exists in any economic relationship. A sovereign risk includes the risk of interference of the Government in a contract or any other relationship, which risk is not specific to public bonds.\n\n370.\n\nUnder the objective approach, commercial and sovereign risks are distinct from operational risk. The distinction here would be between a risk inherent in the investment operation in its surrounding - meaning that the profits are not ascertained but depend on the success or failure of the economic venture concerned - and all the other commercial and sovereign risks. This distinction has been underscored by Emmanuel Gaillard:\n\n\" *Trois \u00e9l\u00e9ments sont donc requis: l'apport, la dur\u00e9e et le fait que l'investisseur supporte, au moins en partie, les al\u00e9as de l'entreprise [...] Dans une telle* *conception, un simple pr\u00eat dont la r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration ne d\u00e9pend en rien du succ\u00e8s de l'entreprise ne peut \u00eatre qualifi\u00e9 d'investissement.* \"512\n\nEmmanuel Gaillard, La jurisprudence du CIRDI (ICSID Case Law), Pedone Paris 2004, p. 479.\n\n371.\n\nIn sum, if \"objective\" criteria were to be applied, while it could be accepted that there was an intended duration of the possession by Po\u0161tov\u00e1 banka of the GGB interests, the element of contribution to an economic venture and the existence of the specific operational risk that characterizes an investment under the objective approach are not present here. In other words, under the objective approach of the definition of what constitutes an investment, *i.e.* a contribution to an economic venture of a certain duration implying an operational risk, the acquisition by Po\u0161tov\u00e1 banka of the interests in GGBs would not constitute an investment, and as a consequence, if that criteria were applied, the Tribunal could not assert jurisdiction.\n\n**VII. COSTS**\n--------------\n\n372.\n\nBoth Parties request an award of costs in respect of their legal fees and expenses and the costs of arbitration incurred in connection with this proceeding.\n\n373.\n\nClaimants' legal fees and expenses amount to US$5,517,010.09 as of September 30, 2014.513 Claimants have advanced US $300,000 on account of the fees and expenses of the Members of the Tribunal and the ICSID administrative fees and expenses, as well as a lodging fee of US$25,000.\n\nClaimants' Submission on Costs of 31 October 2014.\n\n374.\n\nRespondent's legal fees and expenses amount to \u20ac4,650,232.73 as of September 30, 2014.514 Respondent has advanced US$300,000 to ICSID to cover costs of the arbitration.\n\nRespondent's Submission on Costs of November 6, 2014.\n\n375.\n\nThe fees and expenses of the Tribunal and ICSID's administrative fees and expenses (the costs of arbitration), including expenses relating to the Hearing, amount to approximately US$600,600.00.515 These costs are paid out of the advances made by the Parties.516\n\nThe ICSID Secretariat will provide the Parties with a detailed financial statement of the case account as soon as all invoices are received and the account is final.\n\nAny remaining balance will be reimbursed to the Parties in proportion to the payments that they advanced to ICSID.\n\n376.\n\nRule 47(1) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules provides that the Tribunal's Award \" *shall contain [\u2026] (j) any decision of the Tribunal regarding the cost of the proceeding.* \" Article 61 of the ICSID Convention gives the Tribunal discretion to allocate costs of the arbitration, including attorney's fees and other costs, between the Parties as it deems appropriate.\n\n377.\n\nAlthough the Tribunal has concluded that it lacks jurisdiction *ratione materiae* and ruled in favor of Respondent, the jurisdictional issue was not clear-cut and involved a complex factual and legal background. Each side presented valid arguments in support of its respective case and acted fairly and professionally.\n\n378.\n\nIn light of these circumstances, the Tribunal decides that both sides shall bear the costs of arbitration equally, and that each side shall bear its own legal and other costs.\n\n**VIII. DECISION**\n------------------\n\n379.\n\nFor the reasons set forth above, the Tribunal unanimously decides as follows:\n\ni. The Tribunal has no jurisdiction over the dispute;\n\nii. The Parties shall bear the costs of the arbitration in equal shares;\n\niii. Each Party shall bear its own legal fees and expenses;\n\niv.

(\" **Po\u0161tov\u00e1 banka** \", \" **Po\u0161tov\u00e1** \" or \" **Applicant** \"), a bank incorporated under the laws of the Slovak Republic, which was one of two Claimants in the arbitration proceeding. The Applicant has been represented in this annulment proceeding by David Rivkin, Samantha J. Rowe and Z.J. Jennifer Lim of Debevoise & Plimpton, and by Filip Luk\u00e1c and Jan Nosko of Po\u0161tov\u00e1 banka.\n\n2.\n\nThe Respondent is the Hellenic Republic (\" **Hellenic Republic** \", \" **Greece** \" or \" **Respondent** \"). The Respondent has been represented in this annulment proceeding by Claudia Annacker and Christopher Moore of Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton, and by Styliani Charitaki, Emmanouela Panopoulou and Maria Vlassi of the Legal Council of the State.\n\n3.\n\nISTROKAPITAL SE (\" **Istrokapital** \"), a European Public Limited Liability Company holding shares in Po\u0161tov\u00e1 banka and incorporated under the laws of Cyprus, was the other Claimant in the arbitration, and is not a party to the annulment proceeding.\n\n**II. PROCEDURAL HISTORY**\n--------------------------\n\n4.\n\nOn July 31, 2015, the Applicant filed with the Secretary-General of the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (\" **ICSID** \" or the \" **Centre** \") an application requesting the partial annulment of the award rendered on April 9, 2015 (\" **Award** \") in the case between the Applicant and Istrokapital (\" **Claimants** \" in the original proceedings) and the Hellenic Republic. The application (\" **Application** \") was filed in accordance with Article 52 of the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States (\" **ICSID Convention** \" or \" **Washington Convention** \") and Rule 50 of the ICSID Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings (\" **Arbitration Rules** \"). The Applicant sought partial annulment of the Award on the basis that the Award has failed to state the reasons on which it is based pursuant to Article 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention.\n\n5.\n\nOn August 5, 2015, the Secretary-General informed the Parties that the Application had been registered on that date and that the Chairman of the Administrative Council of ICSID would proceed to appoint an *ad hoc* Committee pursuant to Article 52(3) of the ICSID Convention.\n\n6.\n\nBy letter of September 2, 2015, in accordance with Rule 52(2) of the Arbitration Rules, the Secretary-General notified the Parties that an *ad hoc* Committee (\" **Committee** \") had been constituted - composed of Professor Azzedine Kettani (Moroccan) as President, and Sir David Edward KCMG QC (British) and Professor Hi-Taek Shin (Korean) as Members - and that the annulment proceeding was deemed to have begun on that date. The Parties were also informed that Ms. Martina Polasek, Team Leader/Legal Counsel, ICSID, would serve as Secretary of the *ad hoc* Committee, assisted by Ms. Celeste Mowatt, Legal Associate, ICSID.\n\n7.\n\nThe first session of the Committee was held by teleconference on October 29, 2015. In addition to the Committee, its Secretary and Ms. Mowatt, participating in the conference were:\n\nOn behalf of the Applicant\n\nMr. Filip Luk\u00e1c Po\u0161tov\u00e1 banka, a.s.\n\nMr. David W.

At the end of the Hearing, it was agreed that the Parties would file statements on costs by June 30, 2016. The Parties filed their statements on costs as scheduled.\n\n15.\n\nIn accordance with Arbitration Rules 38(1) and 53, the proceedings were declared closed on August 23, 2016.\n\n16.\n\nThe Committee has deliberated by various means of communication and, in rendering this decision, have taken into consideration the Parties' written and oral arguments and submissions on Po\u0161tov\u00e1's application for partial annulment of the Award.\n\n**III. THE AWARD**\n------------------\n\n17.\n\nBelow, the Committee provides a brief summary of the Award rendered on April 9, 2015 by a tribunal composed of Mr. Eduardo Zuleta, (President, appointed by the Secretary-General), Mr. John M. Townsend (appointed by the Claimants) and Prof. Brigitte Stern (appointed by the Respondent) (the \" **Tribunal** \"), including the relevant facts that gave rise to the dispute.1 The claims were submitted to ICSID on the basis of the Agreement between the Government of the Hellenic Republic and the Government of the Czech and Slovak Federal Republic for the Promotion and Reciprocal Protection of Investments dated June 3, 1991 (the \" **Slovakia-Greece BIT** \"), the Agreement between the Government of the Hellenic Republic and the Government of the Republic of Cyprus on the Mutual Promotion of Investments dated March 30, 1992 (the \" **Cyprus-Greece BIT** \") and the ICSID Convention.\n\nThis factual summary is based on the facts described in the Award and is not intended to be an exhaustive and detailed narrative of all such facts. Rather, its purpose is simply to provide the general context of this Decision.\n\n**A. Summary of Facts**\n-----------------------\n\n18.\n\nSections I and II of the Award introduce the parties to the arbitration proceeding and describe the procedural history of the arbitration. Section III of the Award outlines the factual background of the dispute, which is briefly summarized below.\n\nThe Greek Financial Crisis and Po\u0161tov\u00e1 Banka's Interests in Greek Government Bonds\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n19.\n\nGreece experienced a significant economic downturn due to the global financial crisis of 2008. In 2009, Greek public debt was downgraded by rating agencies. In January 2010, Greece submitted to the European Commission a three-year stability program to reduce its fiscal deficit, which was followed by the adoption of austerity measures.\n\n20.\n\nThrough a series of transactions completed between January and April 2010, Po\u0161tov\u00e1 used capital from consumer deposits to acquire \u20ac 504,000,000.00 aggregate face principal amount of Greek Government Bonds (hereinafter referred to as \" **GGBs** \" or \"interests in **GGBs** \").2 The GGBs acquired by Po\u0161tov\u00e1 belonged to five series of GGBs, governed by Greek law, which had been issued by the Hellenic Republic between 2007 and 2010 and matured at various dates between 2012 and 2020.3 These five series of GGBs were among the obligations of the Greek Government that were downgraded by rating agencies. Po\u0161tov\u00e1's GGBs were held in a book-entry form in an account with Clearstream Banking (\" **Clearstream** \").\n\nIn para. 44 of the Award, at the outset of the factual summary, the Tribunal notes that \" *in this arbitration Claimants* *asserted that their rights derive from the ownership by Po\u0161tov\u00e1 banka of Greek Government Bonds (\u2018GGBs \u2019), whereas Respondent referred to such purchases by Po\u0161tov\u00e1 banka as \u2018interests in GGBs. \u2019 In light of the Tribunal\u2019s decision, this distinction is not determinative. The Tribunal will thus refer to GGBs and interests in GGBs (or GGB interests) indistinctly in this decision.* \" (Footnotes omitted).\n\nThe five series of bonds acquired by the Applicant are described at para. 51 of the Award.\n\n21.\n\nThe process for the issuance of the GGBs was as follows: the Greek Government issued the GGBs through the Bank of Greece administered system to Participants, which, under Greek law, are legal or natural persons approved by the Bank of Greece. The Participants paid the consideration due to Greece for the GGBs and held title to the GGBs. The Participants in turn delivered interests in the GGBs to the Primary Dealers, financial institutions appointed on a yearly basis by competent Greek authorities, who provided the funds for the acquisition. Primary Dealers, in turn, sold the GGBs on the secondary market.\n\n22.\n\nNone of the GGBs acquired by Po\u0161tov\u00e1 contained a collective action clause, allowing a supermajority of bondholders to agree to a debt restructuring that would be legally binding on all holders of the bond, including those who voted against the restructuring.\n\nDevelopments after Po\u0161tov\u00e1 Banka's purchases of GGBs\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n23.\n\nDuring 2010 and 2011, Greece paid the interest due on its bonds. From July 2011, as Greece's situation continued to deteriorate, the International Monetary Fund together with Greek and Euro authorities determined that \"Private Sector Involvement\" (\" **PSI** \") was necessary to close a significant funding gap, meaning that private holders of government debt would be required to accept some reduction in the amount due on that debt.\n\n24.\n\nIn the following months, Greek authorities engaged in consultations concerning PSI and formed a Steering Committee to conduct negotiations. Po\u0161tov\u00e1 was not involved in this process, whereby a nominal \"haircut\" of 53% of the face value of the Greek debt was agreed.\n\n25.\n\nA Greek Bondholder Act was approved by the Greek Parliament on February 23, 2012 in order to implement the PSI. The sovereign debt restructuring was to be implemented through an exchange of outstanding GGBs for new titles. The restructuring of the new titles, which is outlined in paragraph 69 of the Award, was subject to the approval by the holders of the specified majority of eligible GGBs in the Bondholder Act.\n\n26.\n\nThe Consent Solicitation was launched through an Invitation Memorandum, addressed to \"Bondholders or holders of Designated Securities,\" which included \" *each beneficial owner of the Designated Securities holding Designated Securities, directly or indirectly, in an account in the name of Direct Participant acting on such beneficial owner's behalf* \". Only Participants were authorized to submit participation instructions in accordance with the Invitation Memorandum.\n\n27.\n\nPo\u0161tov\u00e1 voted not to accept the exchange proposed in the Consent Solicitation, however, a vast majority of the participating GGB holders (94.23%) voted in favour of it. Thus, new securities were delivered on 12 March 2012. Po\u0161tov\u00e1 received the new securities in its account with Clearstream and the GGBs previously held in that account were removed. On April 2, 2012, Po\u0161tov\u00e1 sold the European Financial Stability Facility notes that it received in the exchange.\n\nPo\u0161tov\u00e1 Banka's accounting for the GGBs\n---------------------------------------\n\n28.\n\nInternational accounting standards required Po\u0161tov\u00e1 to classify bonds or other investments securities for accounting purposes as \"held for trading\" (\" **HFT** \"), \"held to maturity\" (\" **HTM** \") and \"available for sale\" (\" **AFS** \"). Initially, most of Po\u0161tov\u00e1's interests in GGBs were classified in its AFS portfolio. The vast majority of these interests were reclassified on April 1, 2010 from AFS to HTM. Po\u0161tov\u00e1 never classified any of its GGBs as HFT.\n\n29.\n\nDuring 2011, Po\u0161tov\u00e1 sold the entirety of its GGB interests in its AFS portfolio, comprising three of the five series of GGB interests it had bought. Later on, Po\u0161tov\u00e1 purchased GGB interests of the same series and in the same principal amounts, though for different prices.\n\n30.\n\nOn December 23, 2011, Po\u0161tov\u00e1 and J&T Finance, a.s. (\" **J&T Finance** \") entered into two assignment agreements, whereby Po\u0161tov\u00e1 assigned \"Part of the Receivable\" to J&T Finance (the \" **Assignment Agreements** \"). The \"Receivable\" was an amount of the principal and interest of GGBs that Po\u0161tov\u00e1 then held, to be determined according to Greece's level of payment of the interests in GGBs to Po\u0161tov\u00e1, either on the effective due date of the GGBs or on any earlier date on which they were paid.\n\n31.\n\nOn December 23, 2011, J&T Finance and Istrokapital also entered into two assignment agreements pursuant to which J&T Finance would assign to Istrokapital part of the Receivable previously assigned by Po\u0161tov\u00e1 to J&T Finance.\n\n32.\n\nOn March 8, 2012, Istrokapital, J&T Finance and Po\u0161tov\u00e1 entered into an \"Agreement on a Deposit into Other Equity Accounts and on Settlement of Obligations\" (the \" **Settlement Agreement** \"). The Settlement Agreement provided that it would cancel and extinguish all obligations of Po\u0161tov\u00e1 and J&T Finance under the Assignment Agreements as of the entry into effect of the Settlement Agreement.\n\n33.\n\nThe Settlement Agreement required three conditions to enter into effect: (i) the delivery of a notification by Clearstream stating that new issues of Greek bonds had been credited to Po\u0161tov\u00e1's account; (ii) a decision by Po\u0161tov\u00e1's Board of Directors, and (iii) prior consent of Po\u0161tov\u00e1's Supervisory Board.\n\n**B. The Parties' Arguments on Jurisdiction**\n---------------------------------------------\n\n34.\n\nAs the Parties agreed to bifurcate the jurisdictional objections from the merits of the dispute, the Award dealt with the following jurisdictional objections raised by the Respondent, as stated in Section IV of the Award:\n\ni. *The Tribunal lacks jurisdiction* ratione materiae *because (a) Po\u0161tov\u00e1 banka\u2019s interests in GGBs are not protected investments under the Slovakia- Greece BIT and the ICSID Convention; and (b) Istrokapital never made an investment protected under the Cyprus-Greece BIT or the ICSID Convention.*\n\nii. *The Tribunal lacks jurisdiction* ratione temporis *and/or the claims should be dismissed on grounds of abuse of process.*\n\niii. *The Tribunal lacks jurisdiction* ratione personae *over Istrokapital because (a) Istrokapital is not a \"National of Another Contracting State\" under Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention; and (b) Istrokapital is not a protected investor under the Cyprus-Greece BIT.*\n\niv. *The Tribunal lacks jurisdiction over Claimants\u2019 umbrella clause claims and/or Claimants have failed to establish* prima facie *those claims.*4\n\nAward, para. 91.\n\n35.\n\nSection V of the Award summarizes the Parties' arguments on these jurisdictional objections. An overview of the arguments concerning item (i) is set out below. As Istrokapital has not requested annulment in this case and the Applicant has not requested annulment with respect to items (ii) or (iv), there is no need to discuss these items.\n\n*(i)*  *The Respondent\u2019s Position*\n----------------------------------\n\n36.\n\nThe Respondent argued that neither Claimant had a protected investment under either of the applicable BITs, or under Article 25 of the ICSID Convention.\n\n37.\n\nAs noted in footnote 2, Greece emphasized the difference between GGBs and GGB interests. GGBs, on the one hand, are issued by Greece and purchased by Participants in the system. Participants are the only holders of GGBs and are in contractual privity with Greece; the price of GGBs is determined at the time of the bond issuance. GGB interests, on the other hand, are created by Participants and purchased by Primary Dealers who sell them on the secondary market. Holders of GGB interests do not participate in the System and are in contractual privity with the International Clearing System accounts where interests are deposited.\n\n38.\n\nGreece argued that a line of ICSID cases established four cumulative criteria to be applied in order to determine whether there is an investment within the meaning of Article 25(1) of the Convention (the *Salini* test), which it argued also applied to the definition of investment under Article 1(1) of the Slovakia-Greece BIT: \" *(i) a contribution in money or other assets, (ii) a significant duration, (iii) an element of risk, and (iv) a contribution to the economic development of the host State or an operation made in order to develop an economic activity in the host State*.\"5 The Respondent argued that debt instruments do not automatically meet these criteria.\n\nAward, para. 97, quoting para. 112 of the Respondent's Memorial on Jurisdiction dated May 1, 2014.\n\n39.\n\nThe Respondent claimed that the territorial *nexus* required for investments to be protected under the BIT and the ICSID Convention was absent because secondary market purchases of interests in sovereign bonds lacked territorial connection with the host State, noting that Po\u0161tov\u00e1's GGB interests were held in accounts in Clearstream, maintained in Luxembourg and governed by Luxembourg Law.\n\n40.\n\nThe Respondent emphasized that the nature of the investments did not change, neither by the fact that Po\u0161tov\u00e1 banka received an \"Invitation Memorandum\" in order to participate into the Consent Solicitation above mentioned, nor by the application of the \"unity of investment\" theory advanced by the Claimants to establish jurisdiction over transactions conducted in the secondary market.\n\n41.\n\nGreece also argued that the purchase of GGB interests resulted only indirectly in economic benefit to the State, asserting that, from an economic perspective, the interests acquired by Po\u0161tov\u00e1 banka long after the end of the distribution period were fundamentally different from the instruments involved in the distribution process.\n\n42.\n\nGreece additionally argued that the Claimants' purchases were too remote from the GGB issuance process to be considered to give rise to a dispute \" *arising directly out of an investment*.\"\n\n*(ii)*  *The Claimants' Position*\n---------------------------------\n\n43.\n\nThe Claimants asserted that the Tribunal had jurisdiction *ratione materiae* because GGBs are assets comprising a \"loan\" to the Greek Government, a \"claim to money\" and the \"right to performance under a contract\" pursuant to Article 1(1) of the Slovakia-Greece BIT and are assets, comprising monetary claims and contractual claims with economic value pursuant to Article 1(1) the Cyprus-Greece BIT. The Claimants also stressed that there is no relevant difference between a bond and a loan.\n\n44.\n\nThe Claimants stated that the definitions of \"investment\" in the BITs did not contain the limitations advanced by Greece as the BITs provided, on the contrary, a broad general definition. The Claimants asserted that, as defined in the BITs, investment meant every kind of asset and that there was no need to define sovereign bonds specifically because they were included in monetary and contractual claims.\n\n45.\n\nFurther, the Claimants argued that purchases by investors like Po\u0161tov\u00e1 implied a contribution to the State because the flow of funds to Greece depended entirely on the sale of GGBs on the secondary market.\n\n46.\n\nThe Claimants also responded to the distinction raised by the Respondent between the issuance of the bonds to the Participants and their purchase in the secondary market in order to question the existence of an economic contribution. As further evidence of a unified market between the primary and the secondary markets, the Claimants stated that bond holders in the secondary market were the ones that voted the Consent Solicitation. In addition, the Claimants argued that tribunals have previously found that there is no distinction between government bonds and security entitlements held in a book-and-entry form in a universal depository such as Clearstream, since they are part of the same investment operation.6\n\nAward, para. 137, citing *Abaclat & others. v. Argentine Republic,* ICSID Case No. ARB/07/5, Decision on Jurisdiction and Admissibility, August 4, 2011 (\" *Abaclat v. Argentina* \") and *Ambiente Ufficio S.p.A & Others. v. Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/08/9, Decision on Jurisdiction and Admissibility, February 8, 2013 (\" *Ambiente Ufficio v. Argentina* \").\n\n47.\n\nThe Claimants, moreover, considered that Greece treated Po\u0161tov\u00e1 as a bondholder and included holders of Designated Securities in the Invitation Memorandum to participate in the exchange. They added that these facts had been significant for a previous tribunal, which concluded that a sovereign that included secondary market purchasers in the exchange offer admitted their importance in the bond issuance and distribution process.7\n\nAward, para. 138, citing *Abaclat v. Argentina*.\n\n48.\n\nRegarding the territorial *nexus*, the Claimants asserted that neither of the applicable BITs required the funds to be linked to a specific project in Greece and that it was sufficient that funds were put at the disposal of Greece to foster its economic development.\n\n49.\n\nThe Claimants argued Greece's consent to ICSID jurisdiction in each of the applicable BITs created a strong presumption that the Parties considered the bonds as an investment under both BITs to be an investment under the Convention.\n\n50.\n\nThe Claimants added that the purchase of sovereign debt was not a marginal economic activity that can be compared to transactions that have been determined to fall outside of the ICSID Convention.\n\n51.\n\nThe Claimants rebutted Greece's reference to the *Salini* test to determine whether an investment was made under Article 25 of the ICSID. They argued that the BITs and the Convention did not contain these criteria and noted that tribunals have previously ruled that this approach might exclude transactions that have been internationally recognized as protected investments.\n\n52.\n\nThe Claimants stated that, in any event, their GGBs satisfied the four criteria of the *Salini* test. With regard to the duration of the investment, the Claimants asserted that the party's intent was irrelevant and that placing the bonds in the AFS portfolio was consistent with the strategy of holding them until maturity, but simply gave the bank more flexibility.\n\n**C. Analysis of the Tribunal**\n-------------------------------\n\n53.\n\nSection VI of the Award sets out the Tribunal's analysis on the jurisdictional objections. The Tribunal unanimously dismissed Po\u0161tov\u00e1's and Istrokapital's claims for lack of jurisdiction *ratione materiae*. The Tribunal held that (i) Istrokapital's indirect relationship to the GGBs through its shareholding in Po\u0161tov\u00e1 did not qualify as a protected \"investment\" under the Cyprus-Greece BIT and that (ii) it did not have jurisdiction over Po\u0161tov\u00e1's claims because government bonds did not qualify as protected \"investments\" under the Slovakia-Greece BIT. The Tribunal also discussed the Parties' arguments concerning its jurisdiction under Article 25 of the ICISD Convention. Greece's other jurisdictional objections were not analyzed in the Award. The following provides a brief summary of the Tribunal's analysis of whether or not Po\u0161tov\u00e1's GGB interests were protected investments under the Slovakia-Greece BIT and the ICSID Convention.\n\n*(i)*  *Whether Po\u0161tov\u00e1 banka\u2019s GGB interests are protected investments under the Slovakia-Greece BIT*\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n54.\n\nThe Tribunal recalled that the Parties disagreed as to how the term \"investment\" should be construed under Article 25 of the ICSID Convention and Article 1(1) of the Slovakia-Greece BIT and concerning the interplay between the aforementioned treaties and the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (\" **VCLT** \").\n\n55.\n\nThe Claimants claimed that their interests in GGBs were included in what they consider a broad definition and special meaning of \"investment\" contained in the *chapeau* of Article 1(1) and under its section (c), because the interests would be either \"loans\" or \"claims to money\" or both. The Respondent, in turn, argued that \"investment\" has an inherent meaning that requires that certain objective criteria must be satisfied in order for an asset listed under Article 1(1) to qualify as an investment.\n\n56.\n\nThe Tribunal quoted Articles 31(1) and 31(2) of the VCLT, outlining a general rule of interpretation of a treaty and provided an analysis of Article 1(1) of the Slovakia-Greece BIT with regards to this rule.\n\n57.\n\nAccording to the Tribunal, Article 31 of the VCLT requires that the terms of the treaty be interpreted in good faith, not only referring to the text but to the context, as well considering the object and purpose of the treaty.\n\n58.\n\nIn that respect, the Tribunal agreed with the Claimants that the concept of \"investment\" as contained in Article 1(1) of the Slovakia-Greece BIT is a broad one, however, the Tribunal was not persuaded that a broad definition necessarily meant that any and all categories, of any nature whatsoever, may qualify as an \"investment\", nor that the only manner in which a category may be excluded as an investment, under a broad-asset based concept, is by express exclusion in the given treaty.\n\n59.\n\nFor the Tribunal, the fact that the list of protected investments in the treaty is not a closed list did not mean that investor-State tribunals are authorized to expand the scope of the investments that the State parties intended to protect.\n\n60.\n\nThe Tribunal noted that several treaties, including the Slovakia-Greece BIT, contain a similar, or identical, general definition of investment. However, the list of examples that follows the introductory phrase, which illustrates what may constitute an investment, varies from one treaty to another.\n\n61.\n\nThe Tribunal stated that an interpretation in good faith should embody the principle of effectiveness,8 meaning that, according to the Tribunal, preference should be given to an interpretation that provides meaning to all the terms of the treaty as opposed to one that does not. The list of examples provided by the Slovakia-Greece BIT must thus be considered in the context of the treaty and be given some meaning together as in previous cases.9\n\nAward, para. 293 (\" *Ut res magis valeat quem pererat* \").\n\nAward, paras. 294-303, citing *Fedax N.V. v. Republic of Venezuela*, ICSID Case No. ARB/96/3, Decision of the Tribunal on Objections to Jurisdiction, July 11, 1997; *Abaclat v. Argentina* ; and *Ambiente Ufficio v. Argentina*.\n\n62.\n\nThe Tribunal noted that the decisions that have specifically analyzed issues related to financial products similar to those at issue in this case have consistently considered the text of the list of categories that may constitute an investment as a definitive element to determine whether the activity or operation at stake may be considered an investment.\n\n63.\n\nComparing these previous decisions with the present arbitration, the Tribunal stated that, first, the Slovakia-Greece BIT differed from the wide language included in the general definition of investment in the Argentina-Italy BIT which was relied on in *Abaclat*. Second, the list of examples of Article 1(1) of the Slovakia-Greece BIT, and particularly the sections invoked by the Claimants in support of their interpretation of the relevant BIT, were also substantially different from the Argentina-Italy BIT. The Argentina-Italy BIT listed *\"obligations, private or*  *public* *titles or any other right to performances or services having economic value, including capitalized revenues* \"10, whereas the Slovakia-Greece BIT in contrast referred to \" *loans, claims to money or to any performance under contract having a financial value* \". Third, the Slovakia-Greece BIT did not contain the wide language that the *Abaclat* tribunal considered would include bonds, i.e. \" *any right of economic nature conferred under law or contract* \".11\n\nAward, para. 306 (emphasis in original).\n\nAward, para. 307.\n\n64.\n\nAs pleaded by the Claimants, the objective of the Slovakia-Greece BIT is for the State parties to the treaty to create favorable conditions for investments by investors, but this does not mean for the Tribunal that, in case of doubt, the treaty must be interpreted in favor of the investor, or that protecting investments is the sole purpose of the treaty.\n\n65.\n\nArticle 1(1) of the Slovakia-Greece BIT initially provided for a broad concept by indicating that investment \" *means any kind of asset* \" in the *chapeau*, but then used the words \" *and in particular* \", a term used to show that a statement applies to one person or thing more than any other.\n\n66.\n\nTherefore, the interpretation of the text and context of Article 1(1) led the Tribunal to consider that the State parties to the treaty preferred an ample definition of what could constitute an investment, within certain categories that are also broad, but not unlimited.\n\n67.\n\nBased on the above, the Tribunal had to determine whether Po\u0161tov\u00e1 banka's interests in the GGBs fit within the specific but wide category or group of investments listed in sections (a) to (f) of Article 1(1).\n\n68.\n\nSovereign debt is an instrument of government monetary and economic policy and its impact at the local and international levels makes it an important tool for the handling of social and economic policies of a State. It cannot, thus, be equated to private indebtedness or corporate debt.\n\n69.\n\nThe Tribunal had no doubt that the GGBs constituted sovereign debt, in the form of securities, in general, and bonds, in particular, that are subject to strict requirements in their issuance. The question that the Tribunal had to address was, therefore, whether the wide list of investments provided for under Article 1(1) of the Slovakia-Greece BIT included sovereign debt in general and, if so, the GGBs in particular.\n\n70.\n\nFor the Tribunal, the Slovakia-Greece BIT did not contain any language that suggests that the State parties considered, in the wide category of investments of the list of Article 1(1) of the BIT, public debt or public obligation, nor sovereign debt, as an investment under the treaty. The only reference to bonds in Article 1(1)(b) left no doubt to the Tribunal that the bonds referred to were only bonds issued by a company, not sovereign debt in general, or bonds issued by either State party to the treaty in particular. The Tribunal agreed with the Respondent that sovereign bonds were different from forms of participation in corporations and therefore their exclusion from the definition of investment in a given treaty indicated that the contracting parties did not intend to cover these types of assets.\n\n71.\n\nThe Tribunal disagreed with the wide interpretation of the text of Article 1(1)(c) proposed by the Claimants, that the GGBs clearly fit into the category of investments described in the words \" *loans, claims to money or to any performance under contract having a financial value* \" and further detailed how loans and bonds are distinct financial products.\n\n72.\n\nThe Tribunal first agreed with the Respondent that loans involved contractual privity between the lender and the debtor while bonds do not involve contractual privity. The Tribunal then considered that the various operations undertaken by Po\u0161tov\u00e1 banka with the GGBs confirmed lack of privity and that if Po\u0161tov\u00e1 had granted a loan to Greece, as opposed to having acquired bonds in the secondary market, it would then have had a direct contractual relationship with Greece.\n\n73.\n\nAs for claims to money, the Tribunal again disagreed with the interpretation of the Claimants for several reasons. First, there was no indication that the State parties intended to expand the language of the treaty so as to include bonds under the general reference of \"claims to money\". Second, claim to money must arise under a contractual relationship and, as the Tribunal discussed, it was undisputed that Po\u0161tov\u00e1 banka was not a Participant or a Primary Dealer, and that it therefore had no contractual relationship with the Respondent in connection with the issuance and distribution of the bonds.\n\n74.\n\nConsequently, and under Greek Law 2198 of 1994, the rights of Po\u0161tov\u00e1 banka - like the rights of other bondholders - were rights against the Participants. Po\u0161tov\u00e1 banka had certain rights against the Greek Government, but such rights would only become exercisable against the Respondent in one specific circumstance, which is the failure of the Greek Government to pay due interest and principal on securities to the Bank of Greece.\n\n75.\n\nIn addition, even if the issuance of the GGBs and the sales in the secondary market constituted one single economic operation, as suggested by the Claimants, the Tribunal was not convinced that it would result in Po\u0161tov\u00e1 banka having a claim to money against the Respondent. The Tribunal deducted that Po\u0161tov\u00e1 banka did not have an investment for purposes of Article 1(1) of the BIT.\n\n76.\n\nThe Tribunal concluded that neither of the Claimants had an investment as defined in Article 1(1) of the Slovakia-Greece BIT and in Article 1(1) of the Cyprus-Greece BIT and that the Tribunal therefore lacked jurisdiction *ratione materiae* to entertain the dispute.12\n\nBased on this conclusion, the Tribunal did not deem it necessary to examine the Respondent's remaining objections concerning the absence of jurisdiction *ratione personae* and *ratione temporis*, nor the allegations concerning abuse of process and the umbrella clause.\n\n*(ii)*  *Analysis of the Tribunal's jurisdiction under the ICSID Convention*\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n77.\n\nThe Tribunal's conclusion concerning the definition of \"investment\" under the Slovakia-Greece BIT above made it unnecessary for it to resolve the dispute between the Parties as to whether Po\u0161tov\u00e1 banka's GGBs would be considered investments as that term was used in the ICSID Convention. However, the Tribunal felt appropriate to refer to such disagreement.\n\n78.\n\nThe Tribunal stated that it was well known that the drafters of the ICSID Convention intentionally chose not to include a definition of investment. The Tribunal noted that a number of cases attempted to deal with this omission by articulating a set of \"objective criteria\", which cannot be set aside by consent that may have been given in another legal instrument, such as a BIT. According to such test, an investment requires a contribution of money or assets, duration and risk (more or less the *Salini* test argued by the Respondent).\n\n79.\n\nOn the other hand, the Tribunal recognized that other ICSID tribunals have held that, because the ICSID Convention provided no definition of the term \"investment\", the limits of this concept were susceptible to agreement between the State parties to a BIT. This approach has been described as a \"subjective\" approach.\n\n80.\n\nIn the present case, the Tribunal, after considering both approaches did not feel the need to choose between the \"objective\" approach, which would give the term \"investment\" an inherent meaning, and a \"subjective\" approach.\n\n81.\n\nIn any event, the Tribunal, by majority, believed that an analysis applying the \"objective\" test as pleaded by the Parties would have led to the same conclusion with respect to Po\u0161tov\u00e1's GGB interests as the Tribunal reached in its analysis under the BIT. Mr. Townsend did not join in this conclusion.\n\n82.\n\nIn setting out the majority's position in that regard, the Award considered three criteria of the objective test: contribution, duration and risk. The majority was of the view that the element of contribution to an economic venture and the existence of the specific operational risk were not present. Therefore, \" *under the objective approach of the definition of what constitutes an investment, i.e. a contribution to an economic venture of a certain duration implying an operational risk, the acquisition by Po\u0161tov\u00e1 banka of the interests in GGBs would not constitute an investment, and as a consequence, if that criteria were applied, the Tribunal could not assert jurisdiction.* \"13\n\nAward, para. 371.\n\n83.\n\nSection VII of the Award contained the Tribunal's decision on the allocation of the Parties' legal fees and expenses, and the costs of arbitration. The Tribunal decided that both sides would bear the costs of the arbitration equally, and that each side would bear its own legal and other costs.\n\n84.\n\nSection VIII of the Award contained the *dispositif* :\n\n*For the reasons set forth above, the Tribunal unanimously decides as follows:*\n\n*i. The Tribunal has no jurisdiction over the dispute;*\n\n*ii. The Parties shall bear the costs of the arbitration in equal shares;*\n\n*iii. Each Party shall bear its own legal fees and expenses;*\n\n*iv. All other claims are dismissed.*\n\n**IV. THE PARTIES' POSITIONS**\n------------------------------\n\n85.\n\nThe Parties' positions in respect of the Application for Partial Annulment are summarized below, taking into consideration the written and oral submissions.14\n\nThis summary is not intended as an exhaustive and detailed narrative of all arguments of the Parties. Rather, its purpose is to simply provide the general context of this Decision.\n\n**A. The Applicant's Position**\n-------------------------------\n\n86.\n\nThe Applicant requests the partial annulment of the Award on the basis that the Award \" *failed to state the reasons on which it is based* \", relying on Articles 48(3) and 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention.\n\n87.\n\nThe Applicant argues that the Award should be partially annulled because the Tribunal failed to state reasons for its conclusion that Po\u0161tov\u00e1 banka had no qualifying \"investments\" under the Slovakia-Greece BIT:\n\n...*the Tribunal found that Po\u0161tov\u00e1's bond holdings gave rise to certain contractual and property rights against both the Greek Government and certain financial institutions located in Greece. The Tribunal* also *found that the Treaty included contractual and property rights in its definition of \u2018investments.' However, the Tribunal ignored the obvious conclusion that results from these two findings: that it has jurisdiction over claims concerning Po\u0161tov\u00e1's contractual and property rights. Instead, in denying jurisdiction, the Tribunal never explained why Po\u0161tov\u00e1's contractual and property rights, which it had specifically found to exist, did not fall within the Treaty's admittedly wide definition of \u2018investments,' with its broadly-worded chapeau (referencing \u2018every kind of asset') and its list offive nonexclusive categories of assets that constitute \u2018investments.'*\n\n*The Tribunal thus failed to ensure that the Parties, or anyone else, can understand its reasoning, and left its decision on the key jurisdictional issue\u2014that the Greek sovereign bonds do not constitute an \u2018investment' under Article 1 of the Treaty\u2014essentially lacking in any expressed rationale. Moreover, the Tribunal's findings that Po\u0161tov\u00e1 (i) held contractual and property rights that fall within the Treaty's express definition of \u2018investments' but (ii) nonetheless did not have an investment under the Treaty, are \u2018genuinely contradictory;' indeed, they are mutually exclusive. For both of these reasons, the Award \u2018failed to state the reasons on which it is based' under Article 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention.*15\n\nMemorial, paras. 4-5 (emphasis in original).\n\n88.\n\nThree main arguments were advanced by the Applicant: (i) that the Tribunal failed to provide reasons that enable the reader to follow how the Tribunal proceeded from Point A to Point B; (ii) that the reasoning provided by the Tribunal was so contradictory so as to amount to no reasons at all; and (iii) that the Tribunal's errors were outcome-determinative.\n\n89.\n\nThe Applicant argues that because the Tribunal has failed to state reasons for its decision that it lacked a qualifying investment under the Slovakia-Greece BIT, \" *the dismissal of Postova\u2019s claims for lack of jurisdiction must be annulled*.\"16\n\nMemorial, para. 77 *.*\n\n*(i)*  *The Tribunal failed to provide reasons that enable the reader to follow how the Tribunal proceeded from Point A to Point B*\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n90.\n\nAccording to the Applicant, the standard to be applied under Article 52(1)(e) of the Convention is the \" *often quoted* \" test applied by the *ad hoc* Committee in *MINE v. Guinea* : \" *the requirement to state reasons is satisfied as long as the award enables one to follow how the Tribunal proceeded from point A to point B and eventually to its conclusion, even if it made an error of fact or of law* \" (the \"*MINE* test\").17\n\nHearing, Tr. 20:12-18, citing *Maritime International Nominees Establishment v. Republic of Guinea*, ICSID Case No. ARB/84/4, Decision on the Application by Guinea for Partial Annulment, December 14, 1989, (CL-0150) (\" *MINE v. Guinea* \").\n\n91.\n\nPo\u0161tov\u00e1 argued that partial annulment of the Award is justified because the *MINE* test is not satisfied by the reasoning included in the Award: the Tribunal recognized that Po\u0161tov\u00e1 banka had certain contractual and non-contractual rights against other Participants and non-contractual rights against Greece that fall explicitly within the list of \"investments\" of the Treaty (Point A), yet denied jurisdiction *ratione materiae* over Po\u0161tov\u00e1's claims on the basis that it did not have an \"investment\" under the Treaty (Point B), without any expressed rationale or explanation as to how it proceeded from Point A to Point B.18\n\nReply, para. 1.\n\n92.\n\nThe Applicant states that the Award explicitly recognized that Po\u0161tov\u00e1 has the following contractual and property rights in connection with its GGBs, and that these \"*key factual findings* should *have served as the basis for its interpretation of Article 1(1) of the Treaty\"* :19\n\n\u2022 *Under Greek Law 2198 of 1994 and the documents governing the issuance and trade of the GGBs, Po\u0161tov\u00e1 enjoyed rights against the Participants*.20\n\n\u2022 *These rights arose out of: (a) Po\u0161tov\u00e1\u2019s \"* contractual relationship under the GGBs... exclusively with the Participants through Clearstream; *\" and (b) Po\u0161tov\u00e1\u2019s ownership of the GGBs, which gave it a \"* right in a title - a right in rem - against the Participants *.\"*21\n\n\u2022 *The Participants included Greek entities22*\n\n*\u2022*  *Even though Po\u0161tov\u00e1 had no contractual relationship with Greece, it \"* had certain rights against the Greek Government *,\" which did not arise \"* from a contract with Respondent, but from the title and the consequences provided therein in case the Greek Government fails to pay principal and interest to the Bank of Greece pursuant to the terms of Law 2198 of 1994. \"23\n\nMemorial, para. 32 (emphasis in original).\n\nMemorial, para. 32, citing para. 345 of the Award.\n\nMemorial, para. 32, quoting paras. 347-348 of the Award.\n\nMemorial, para. 32, citing Tr. Day 2, (C-0213), 537:18-21 (Dr. Annacker) *(\"[The Participants] are both international and Greek financial institutions, and the number changes slightly every year. It's about 20 Participants, both domestic and international.* \").\n\nMemorial, para. 32, quoting paras. 345, 348 of the Award and citing Law 2198 of 1994 (R-0108), Art. 8.2.\n\n93.\n\nThe Applicant notes that the Award states that the Tribunal's task was to determine \" *whether Po\u0161tov\u00e1 banka's interests in the GGBs fit within the specific, but wide, category or group of interests listed in sections (a) to [(e)] of the Treaty*.\"24 The Applicant asserts that the Tribunal did not assess, much less explain, why Po\u0161tov\u00e1's rights against Greece and against the Participants, listed above, did not fit within the definition contained in Article 1(1) of the BIT, which defines the term \"investment\" explicitly to include both property and contractual rights.25 Article 1(1) states:\n\n*For the purposes of this Agreement: \"Investment\" means every kind of asset and in particular, though not exclusively includes:*\n\n*a) movable and immovable property and any other property rights such as mortgages, liens or pledges,*\n\n*b) shares in and stock and debentures of a company and any other form of participation in a company,*\n\n*c) loans, claims to money or to any performance under contract having a financial value,*\n\n*d) intellectual property rights, goodwill, technical processes and know-how,*\n\n*e) business concessions conferred by law or under contract, including concessions to search for, cultivate, extract or exploit natural resources*.\n\nMemorial, para. 37, quoting para. 316 of the Award\n\nMemorial, para. 67.\n\n94.\n\nThe Applicant considers that the Tribunal's finding that sovereign bonds were not within the scope of Article 1(1) did not address the question whether the rights that Po\u0161tov\u00e1 banka does hold against the Greek Government and Greek Participants, listed above, might fit within the categories included in Article 1(1). In particular, the Applicant argues that the Tribunal did not address why the rights *in rem* against Greece and against the Participants did not fall under subparagraph (a) (i.e. \". *other property rights*.\") and why the contractual rights against the Participants did not fall under subparagraph (c) (i.e. \" *loans, claims to money or to any performance under contract having a financial value* \").26\n\nReply, para. 13.\n\n95.\n\nThe Applicant argues that the reasons that are included in the Award to support the Tribunal's decision that the GGBs as sovereign debt do not constitute an \"investment\" under the Treaty \" *do not remedy the lacuna in its reasoning* \" with regard to the rights acknowledged against Greece and the Participants.27 While the finding that Po\u0161tov\u00e1 had no contractual relationship with Greece might have explained why Po\u0161tov\u00e1's rights against Greece did not fall within Article 1(1)(c) of the Treaty, it did not explain, according to the Applicant, why Po\u0161tov\u00e1's property rights against Greece did not fall within Article 1(1)(a) of the Treaty, or why the contractual and property rights against the Greek Participants did not fall under Article 1(1)(a) and Article 1(1)(c).28\n\nMemorial, para. 68.\n\nReply, para. 13.\n\n96.\n\nThe Applicant argues that the lack of reasoning in between these two points constituted an annullable error under Article 52(1)(e) of the Convention because it is impossible for any informed reader to understand how the Tribunal reached its conclusion that the Applicant's property and contractual rights were not \"investments\".29\n\nReply, para. 14\n\n97.\n\nPo\u0161tov\u00e1 argues that the Respondent's submissions on annulment (i) apply the wrong legal test under Article 52(1)(e); (ii) conflate the question whether sovereign bonds fall within the Treaty's definition of \"investment\" with the question of whether Po\u0161tov\u00e1's contractual and property rights arising from its sovereign bond interests satisfy the definition; and (iii) mischaracterize the Tribunal's factual findings in the Award with regard to the Applicant's property and contractual rights.30 These arguments are summarized briefly below.\n\nReply, para. 7.\n\n98.\n\nWith respect to the legal test for annulment for failure to state reasons, the Applicant states that the relevant question is not whether or not there is a total absence of reasoning but rather whether the reader can follow the reasoning of the Tribunal on points of fact and law (and whether the reasons that the Tribunal does provide are contradictory or frivolous).31\n\nSee E.g. Memorial, para. 54, citing *MINE* v. *Guinea*, paras. 5.08-5.09.\n\n99.\n\nThe Applicant also argues that the question whether sovereign bonds satisfy the Treaty's definition of \"investment\" should not be conflated with the question whether Po\u0161tov\u00e1's contractual and property rights arising from its ownership of sovereign bonds satisfy that test.\n\n100.\n\nThe Applicant rejected the existence of implicit reasons in the Award that might explain how the Tribunal proceeded from Point A to Point B, as asserted by the Respondent. The Applicant distinguished *Soufraki v. UAE* and *Wena v. Egyp* t, which were relied upon by Greece to support its argument concerning the existence of implicit reasons in the Award, noting that the *Soufraki* Committee did not rely on implicit reasons in its decision because it found that adequate reasoning had been included in the Award, and that in *Wena* the implicit reasons found by the Committee could be identified in the documentary evidence relied on in the proceeding.32\n\nReply, para. 15 (emphasis omitted).\n\n101.\n\nThe Applicant stresses that its Application is based on the \" *text of the Award itself* \"33 and the Tribunal's \" *failure to follow its own interpretive construct* \";34 the Applicant states that the Committee does \" *not need to look beyond the Award* \",35 noting that the Respondent's position in the annulment proceeding focused on arguments which were advanced by the Parties during the arbitration, rather than the text of the Award.\n\nReply, para. 21 (emphasis omitted).\n\nReply, para. 22.\n\nHearing, Tr. 17:19-20.\n\n102.\n\nIn that vein, the Applicant also argues that the Respondent's submissions on annulment mischaracterize the Tribunal's factual findings in the Award regarding Po\u0161tov\u00e1 banka's contractual and property rights. In particular, the Applicant notes that the text of the Award states that the Applicant has rights against Participants, and does not indicate that Clearstream was the only Participant against whom Po\u0161tov\u00e1 had contractual and property rights, emphasizing the Tribunal's statement in the Award that Po\u0161tov\u00e1 had a \" *contractual relationship under the GGBs... with the Participants through Clearstream* \".36 Further, the Award states that Po\u0161tov\u00e1 had property rights against the Greek Government, not merely \" *statutory rights* \" as claimed by the Respondent.37\n\nReply, para. 24, quoting para. 347 of the Award.\n\nReply, para. 27.\n\n*(ii)*  *The Tribunal's reasons are contradictory*\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n103.\n\nThe Applicant also argues that the two propositions made by the Tribunal are contradictory: on the one hand, the Tribunal decided that Po\u0161tov\u00e1 banka had no investment and therefore no property or contractual rights arising out of its GGB holdings and, on the other hand, the Award states that Po\u0161tov\u00e1 banka had property and contractual rights arising out of its GGB holdings.38 The Applicant asserts that these contradictory propositions are a \" *in direct conflict with each other and cannot be reconciled* \"39 and therefore constitute a failure to state reasons which justifies the partial annulment of the Award under Article 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention.\n\nMemorial, para. 72.\n\nMemorial, para. 73.\n\n104.\n\nAccording to the Applicant, Greece's allegation that the Tribunal expressly held that the rights associated with the Applicant's GGB interest did not qualify as protected investments mischaracterized the conclusions set out in the Award.40\n\nReply, para. 31.\n\n*(iii)*  *The Tribunal\u2019s errors were outcome-determinative*\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n105.\n\nThe Applicant notes that annulment committees have held that an Award's failure to state reasons must be on a point \" *necessary to the tribunal\u2019s decision* \"41 in order for the failure to constitute an annullable error. The Applicant argues that partial annulment of the Award is justified because the Tribunal failed to state reasons on an outcome-determinative issue.42\n\nMemorial, para. 74, citing *Compa\u00f1i\u00e1 de Aguas del Aconquija S.A. and Vivendi Universal S.A. v. Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/97/3, Decision on Annulment, July 3, 2002, (\" *Vivendi I* \") (CL-0141), para. 65.\n\nMemorial, para. 76.\n\n106.\n\nThe Applicant argued that, contrary to Greece's assertion, the only basis for the Tribunal's conclusion that it lacked jurisdiction over Po\u0161tov\u00e1's claims was its analysis under the Treaty, as the Tribunal \" *explicitly refused to decide* \" whether it had jurisdiction under Article 25 of the ICSID Convention.43\n\nReply, para. 4 (emphasis omitted).\n\n107.\n\nThe Applicant states that, \" *[h]ad the Tribunal considered the implications of its own factual findings* \" concerning the rights held against Greece and the Participants and considered whether those rights fell within the categories of investment included in the Treaty, \" *the Tribunal may well have reached an entirely different conclusion in favor of jurisdiction.* \"44 The Applicant states that the Tribunal's failure to undertake an analysis concerning the property and contractual rights arising from the GGBs *\"led to the dismissal of Po\u0161tov\u00e1\u2019s entire claim.\"'45*\n\nMemorial, para. 76.\n\nMemorial, para. 76.\n\n108.\n\nConsequently, the Applicant considered that the dismissal of Po\u0161tov\u00e1 banka's claims for lack of jurisdiction *ratione materiae* must be annulled and that Po\u0161tov\u00e1 banka must be reimbursed of all costs associated with the annulment proceedings.\n\n**B. The Respondent's Position**\n--------------------------------\n\n109.\n\nThe Respondent argued that the Applicant has failed to satisfy its heavy burden of establishing a legitimate basis for annulment under the ICSID Convention. The Respondent emphasized that the standard for annulment for failure to state reasons is subject to a high threshold.\n\n*(i)*  *The Applicant has not met the high burden of showing that the Award failed to state the reasons on which it is based*\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n110.\n\nThe Respondent asserted that an award is not to be annulled for a failure to state reasons as long as the tribunal fulfilled the \"minimum requirement\" that enables the reader to follow the factual and legal reasoning of the tribunal.46 The Respondent considered that this standard is fulfilled by the Award at issue.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 61, quoting *MINE v. Guinea*, para. 5.09.\n\n111.\n\nThe Respondent also argued that a failure to articulate certain reasons in support of an award is not a ground for annulment under Article 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention where those reasons are implicit.47\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 63, quoting *Hussein Nuaman Soufraki v. United Arab Emirates*, ICSID Case No. ARB/02/7, Decision of the *ad hoc* Committee on the Application for Annulment of Mr. Soufraki, June 5, 2007, (\" *Soufraki v.

Hungary*, ICSID Case No. ARB/07/22, Decision of the *ad hoc* Committee on the Application for Annulment, June 29, 2012, (\" *AES v. Hungary* \") (CL-0137), para. 17.\n\nRejoinder, para. 16, quoting C.H. Schreuer, The ICSID Convention: A Commentary (2009), Article 52 (CL-0155), p. 1003 (\" *Once an* ad hoc *committee starts looking into whether the tribunal\u2019s explanation is sufficient to constitute a statement of reasons, it has already embarked upon a quality control of the award. The formal test of the presence of a statement of reasons blends into a substantive test of adequacy and correctness and the distinction between annulment and appeal becomes blurred* \") *.*\n\n114.\n\nThe Respondent argued that the Tribunal did not make the factual findings which the Applicant alleges concerning rights held by Po\u0161tov\u00e1 banka against the Participants and Greece for the following reasons:\n\n(1) With regard to the Applicant's alleged property rights against Greece, the Respondent argued that the Award states that those rights would only arise \" *in one specific circumstance: the Greek Government\u2019s failure to pay due interest and principal on securities to the Bank of Greece* \". *51* The Award states that the Applicant \" *would have rights against Greece....in case the Greek Government fails to pay... pursuant to the terms of Law 2198 of 1994* \" however the Applicant never argued that such a default had occurred.52\n\n(2) With regard to the alleged property and contractual rights against Participants located in Greece, the Respondent argued that the Applicant never claimed before the Tribunal to have rights against Greek Participants, nor could it, because it never suggested that it held an investor account with a Participant located in Greece or instructed such a Participant to vote against the debt exchange.53 Po\u0161tov\u00e1 banka held its account with Clearstream, a Luxembourg company.54\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 93, quoting para. 345 of the Award.\n\nRejoinder, para. 23, quoting para. 348 of the Award.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 95.\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras. 95, 100.\n\n115.\n\nThe Respondent further argued that, in any event, the Applicant never argued before the Tribunal that its rights against a Participant (i.e. Clearstream in Luxembourg according to the Respondent) are investments made in the Hellenic Republic protected under Article 1(1) of the Slovakia-Greece BIT, as Po\u0161tov\u00e1's only theory in the arbitration was that GGB interests are loans to the Greek Government or give rise to a claim to money against the Hellenic Republic (i.e. that the investment fit within Article 1(1)(c)).55\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 15.\n\n116.\n\nRelying on previous annulment decisions,56 the Respondent argued that the Applicant may not have the *ad hoc* Committee second-guess the Tribunal's interpretation of Article 1(1) of the Slovakia-Greece BIT under the guise of an annulment review. Annulment proceedings do not provide the losing party with an opportunity to reposition or reargue its case.57\n\nRejoinder, para. 29, citing *Total S.A. v. Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/04/01, Decision on Annulment, February 1, 2016, (RL-0155), paras. 284-285; and *Fraport AG Frankfurt Airport Services Worldwide v. Republic of the Philippines*, ICSID Case No. ARB/03/25, Decision on the Application for Annulment of Fraport AG Frankfurt Airport Services Worldwide, December 23, 2010, (RL-0143), para. 112.\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras. 53, 67.\n\n117.\n\nThe Respondent argued that the Tribunal's conclusion that the Applicant's GGB interests were not investments under Article 1(1) of the BIT also encompassed rights arising from ownership of GGB interests: if sovereign debt is not protected, rights arising out of sovereign debt are also not protected.58\n\nRejoinder, paras. 34-35.\n\n118.\n\nQuoting paragraph 332 of the Award, the Respondent concluded that the Applicant cannot avoid the Tribunal's conclusion that sovereign bonds or interests therein, and any right arising from them, are not protected under the Slovakia-Greece BIT, nor can the Applicant avoid its own failure to invoke Article 1(1)(a) of the Treaty before the Tribunal.59\n\nRejoinder, paras. 39-41.\n\n*(ii)*  *The Tribunal's reasons are not contradictory*\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n119.\n\nThe Respondent also stressed that it is well-established that contradictory reasons are not sufficient for annulment under Article 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention. The Respondent quotes paragraph 60 of the Applicant's Memorial, which states that an award can only be annulled for containing contradictory reasons if these reasons \" *are so contradictory that they effectively amount to no reasons at all* \"60 and that \" *reasons must be* \u2018genuinely contradictory,' *such that they are incapable of standing together on any reasonable reading of the Award.* \"61 According to the Respondent, this standard is not met in the present case.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 64, quoting para. 60 of the Memorial, which cites *AES v. Hungary*, para. 53.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 64, quoting para. 60 of the Memorial, which cites *Continental Casualty Company v.

Argentina*) (CL-0142), para. 103 and *Vivendi I*, para. 53.\n\n120.\n\nThe Respondent states that the Tribunal's holding that the Applicant lacked an investment protected under the BIT did not imply that the Applicant had \" *no property or contractual rights arising out of its GGB holdings* \".62 The exclusion of the application of the BIT rested on the findings that rights associated with Po\u0161tov\u00e1 banka's GGB interests are not investments for purpose of the BIT.63\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 98, quoting para. 73 of the Memorial.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 99.\n\n121.\n\nThe Respondent contended that the Applicant had not shown that the Tribunal's reasoning is contradictory.\n\n122.\n\nThe Respondent argues that the Applicant's argument in this regard is based on a *non-sequitur*, that the Applicant cannot conclude that every right qualifies as a protected investment and that the Tribunal's finding that the Applicant lacked a protected investment was not based on, and did not imply, a finding that the Applicant had no rights arising out of its GGB interests, but simply meant that any such rights are not protected.64\n\nRejoinder, para. 48.\n\n*(iii)*  *The error alleged by the Applicant is not outcome-determinative*\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n123.\n\nThe Respondent stated that the Applicant bears the burden to show that the alleged failure to state reasons concerns an outcome-determinative point for the Tribunal's decision that it lacked jurisdiction *ratione materiae* and that the Applicant did not show this outcome- determinative point in its submissions.65\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras. 102-103.\n\n124.\n\nThe Respondent stated that the Applicant had not established any alleged failure to state reasons concerning a point that is outcome-determinative, pursuant to Article 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention. There is no indication that the Tribunal would have come to a different conclusion, had it included in the Award an express analysis of the Applicant's rights under each of the five categories of assets listed in Article 1(1) of the Treaty or had it concluded that the Applicant's GGB interests are protected under Article 1(1) of the Treaty.66\n\nRejoinder, paras. 54-55.\n\n125.\n\nThe Respondent noted that, even if the Tribunal had found that there was jurisdiction *ratione materiae* under the Treaty, the Tribunal would still have decided by majority that it lacked jurisdiction under Article 25 of the ICSID Convention.67\n\nRejoinder, paras. 55-57.\n\n**V. THE COMMITTEE'S ANALYSIS**\n-------------------------------\n\n**A. General Observations**\n---------------------------\n\n126.\n\nThe Committee is bound to apply the provisions of Article 52 of the ICSID Convention and the ICSID Arbitration Rules. The Committee considers that the application of these provisions may be guided, if justified under the circumstances, by paragraphs 41 to 43 of the Report of the Executive Directors on the Washington Convention. The Committee notes that decisions of ICSID tribunals are not binding on the Parties or the Committee. Previous decisions by *ad hoc* committees may have an illustrative value on how different cases, under similar factual circumstances and considerations, were resolved.\n\n127.\n\nThe Parties in this annulment proceeding agree that annulment is an extraordinary remedy with a high threshold, as has been repeatedly emphasized by *ad hoc* committees in applying Article 52 of the ICSID Convention.68\n\nUpdated Background Paper on Annulment for the Administrative Council of ICSID, May 5, 2016, (\"Background Paper on Annulment\") (CL-0164), pages 35-38 (The background paper identifies a number annulment decisions which have accepted as a general principle that \" *annulment is an exceptional and narrowly circumscribed remedy and the role of an* ad hoc *Committee is limited*.\")\n\n128.\n\nIt is evident from the drafting history of that provision, and its subsequent and consistent application, that the function and purpose of an annulment proceeding is distinct from an appeal.69 As stated by the *Soufraki* Committee, \" *the annulment review, although obviously important, is a limited exercise, and does not provide for an appeal of the initial award*.\"70\n\nSee Background Paper on Annulment, pages 38 to 47. (The background paper identified a line of annulment decisions which confirm that \"ad hoc *Committees are not courts of appeal, annulment is not a remedy against an incorrect decision, and an* ad hoc *Committee cannot substitute the Tribunal\u2019s determination on the merits for its* *own*.\")\n\n*Soufraki v. UAE*, para. 20.\n\n129.\n\nThe Committee in *Mitchell v. DRC* stated that *\"[n]o one has the slightest doubt - all the* ad hoc *Committees have so stated, and all authors specializing in the ICSID arbitration system agree - that an annulment proceeding is different from an appeal procedure and that it does not entail the carrying out of a substantive review of an award[...]Nor is there any doubt that the grounds for annulment set out in Article 52 must be examined in a neutral and reasonable manner, that is, neither narrowly nor extensively. An* ad hoc *Committee should not decide to annul an award unless it is convinced that there has been a substantial violation of a rule protected by Article 52.\"*71\n\n*Patrick Mitchell v. Democratic Republic of the Congo*, ICSID Case No. ARB/99/7, Decision on the Application for Annulment of the Award, November 1 2006, (\" *Mitchell v. DRC* \") (RL-0005), para. 19.\n\n130.\n\nIn the same vein, the *ad hoc* Committee in *Kl\u00f6ckner I* stated that annulment cannot \" *be used by one party to complete or develop an argument which it could and should have made during the arbitral proceeding or help that party retrospectively to fill gaps in its arguments*.\"72\n\n*Kl\u00f6ckner Industrie-Anlagen GmbH and others v. United Republic of Cameroon and Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Camerounaise des* *Engrais*, ICSID Case No. ARB/81/2, Decision on the Application for Annulment Submitted by Kl\u00f6ckner, May 3, 1985, (\" *Kl\u00f6ckner I\"*) (CL-0148), para. 83.\n\n131.\n\nMindful of these general principles, the Committee now turns to an analysis of the legal standard for an annulment under Article 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention.\n\n**B. The Legal Standard - Failure to State Reasons**\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n132.\n\nIn this proceeding, the Applicant's request for partial annulment is based on one ground - that the Award issued by the Tribunal failed to state the reasons on which it was based pursuant to Article 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention.\n\n133.\n\nThe Committee notes that the corollary of that provision is the requirement, contained in Article 48(3) of the ICSID Convention, that an Award \" *shall state the reasons upon which it is based*.\"73 The Applicant has described this requirement as a \" *fundamental obligation* \".74\n\nThis requirement is restated in ICSID Arbitration Rule 47(1)(i).\n\nHearing, Tr. 9:1-3.\n\n134.\n\nThe *ad hoc* Committee in *Tulip v. Turkey* commented on the purpose of a statement of reasons in an arbitral award:\n\n*The purpose of a statement of reasons is to explain to the reader of the award, especially to the parties, how and why the tribunal reached its decision. Since the parties are the award's primary addressees, it is not necessary for a tribunal to restate all their arguments and evidence. The parties will be familiar with the main issues before the tribunal, with the evidence that was before it and with the main legal arguments presented to it. Moreover, Article 48(3) does not require discussion of arguments without impact on the award.75*\n\n*Tulip Real Estate and Development Netherlands B.V. v. Republic of Turkey*, ICSID Case No. ARB/11/28, Decision on Annulment, December 30, 2015, (\" *Tulip v. Turkey* \"), para. 98, referencing *Standard Chartered Bank v. United Republic of Tanzania*, ICSID Case No. ARB/10/12, Award, November 2, 2012, paras. 273-275.\n\n135.\n\nBoth Parties accept that the relevant test for failure to state reasons under Article 52(1)(e) is the formula set out in the *MINE v. Guinea* decision:\n\n*5.08. The Committee is of the opinion that the requirement that an award has to be motivated implies that it must enable the reader to follow the reasoning of the Tribunal on points offact and law. It implies that, and only that. The adequacy of the reasoning is not an appropriate standard of review under paragraph (1)(e), because it almost inevitably draws an ad hoc Committee into an examination of the substance of the tribunal's decision, in disregard of the exclusion of the remedy of appeal by Article 53 of the Convention. A Committee might be tempted to annul an award because that examination disclosed a manifestly incorrect application of the law, which, however, is not a ground for annulment.*\n\n*5.09. In the Committee's view, the requirement to state reasons is satisfied as long as the award enables one to follow how the tribunal proceeded from Point A. to Point B. and eventually to its conclusion, even if it made an error of fact or of law. This minimum requirement is in particular not satisfied by either contradictory or frivolous reasons.*76\n\n*MINE v. Guinea*, paras. 5.08-5.09.\n\n136.\n\nThe Parties further agree that, applying this standard, a committee's role is not to consider the quality or persuasiveness of a tribunal's reasons, but is limited to a consideration of whether the reasons are sufficient to allow a reader to understand how the tribunal's conclusion was reached. In other words, the standard relates to the existence of reasons and not the validity of the reasons. The exception, recognized in *MINE* and by subsequent committees, are reasons which are contradictory or frivolous, such that the reasoning provided is so flawed that it amounts to no reasons at all.\n\n137.\n\nWith regard to contradictory reasons, the Parties have both accepted the standard articulated by the committee in *Continental Casualty* :\n\n*[F]or genuinely contradictory reasons to cancel each other out, they must be such as to be incapable of standing together on any reasonable reading of the decision. An example might be where the basis for a tribunal\u2019s decision on one question is the existence of fact A, when the basis for its decision on another question is the* non-existence *of fact A. In cases where it is merely arguable whether there is a contradiction of inconsistency in the tribunal\u2019s reasoning, it is not for an annulment committee to resolve that argument.77*\n\nHowever, the Parties do not agree whether the Award in this case includes reasoning that is contradictory.\n\n*Continental Casualty v. Argentina*, para. 103.\n\n138.\n\nThe *MINE* Committee's position concerning the standard under Article 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention was endorsed by the Committee in *Wena v. Egypt*, which stated:\n\n*The ground for annulment of Article 52(1)(e) does not allow any review of the challenged Award which would lead the* ad hoc *Committee to reconsider whether the reasons underlying the Tribunal\u2019s decisions were appropriate or not, convincing or not. As stated by the* ad hoc *Committee in* MINE *, this ground for annulment refers to a \u2018minimum requirement\u2019 only. This requirement is based on the Tribunal\u2019s duty to identify, and to let the parties know, the factual and legal premises leading the Tribunal to its decision. If such sequence of reasons has been given by the Tribunal, there is no room left for a request for annulment under Article 52(1)(e).*78\n\n*Wena v. Egypt*, para. 79.\n\n139.\n\nBoth Parties have also accepted the test articulated by the *Vivendi I* Committee:\n\n*[I]t is well accepted both in the cases and the literature that Article 52(1)(e) concerns a failure to state* any *reasons with respect to all or part of an award, not the failure to state correct or convincing reasons. It bears reiterating that an* ad hoc *committee is not a court of appeal. Provided that the reasons given by a tribunal can be followed and relate to the issues that were before the Tribunal, their correctness is beside the point in terms of Article 52(1)(e).79*\n\n*Vivendi I*, para. 64.\n\n140.\n\nFinally, both Parties have also accepted the standard articulated in the Decision on Annulment in *El Paso v. Argentina*, which states that an award should only be annulled if \" *a well-informed reader can[not] understand the facts and the law by which the Tribunal reached its conclusions*.\"80\n\n*El Paso Energy International Company v. Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/03/15, Decision of the *ad hoc* Committee on the Application for Annulment of the Argentine Republic, September 22, 2014, (\" *El Paso v. Argentina\"*) (CL-0143), para. 220.\n\n141.\n\nSome committees have held that implicit reasons may be read into the award provided they can be reasonably inferred by a reader. The Committee in *Soufraki v. UAE* stated that \" *if the* ad hoc *Committee can \u2018explain' the Award by clarifying reasons that seemed absent because they were only implicit, it should do so*.\"81 As stated by the Committee in *Vivendi II*, it is \" *understood that in the matter of adequate reasoning, upon a hearing, an ICSID* ad hoc *Committee may, if it deems it necessary, further explain, clarify, or supplement the reasoning given by the Tribunal rather than annul the decision.* \"82\n\n*Soufraki v. UAE*, para. 24.\n\n*Vivendi II*, para. 248.\n\n142.\n\nThis approach is consistent with the standards that have been endorsed by the Parties in this proceeding with regard to Article 52(1)(e); if the reasoning of a tribunal on a particular point can be inferred without difficulty and without substantial speculation by the reader, then the reader is in a position to understand how the Tribunal reached its conclusion and the so-called *MINE* Test is satisfied and, furthermore, the function of a statement of reasons is served. However the Committee is mindful of the caveat expressed by the Committee in *Rumeli* that if alleged implicit reasons \" *do not necessarily follow or flow from the award's reasoning, an* ad hoc *committee should not construct reasons in order to justify the decision of the tribunal*.\"83\n\n*Rumeli Telekom A.S. and Telsim Mobil Telekomunikasyon Hizmetleri A.S. v. Republic of Kazakhstan*, ICSID Case No. ARB/05/16, Decision of the *ad hoc* Committee, March 25, 2010, (\" *Rumeli v. Kazakhstan* \") (CL-0152), para. 83.\n\n143.\n\nFinally, the Committee notes that, even where an absence of reasons is found, in order for a failure to state reasons to justify an annulment, the error must relate to an issue that was outcome-determinative.84 This has been accepted by the Parties and confirmed by a number of *ad hoc* committees.\n\nSee E.g. *Alapli Elektrik B.V. v. Republic of Turkey*, ICSID Case No. ARB/08/13, Decision on Annulment (July 10, 2014) (CL-0138), para. 202; *Vivendi I*, para. 65; *El Paso v. Argentina*, para. 169; *Rumeli v. Kazakhstan*, para. 81; *Wena v. Egypt*, para. 58.\n\n**C. The Committee's Findings**\n-------------------------------\n\n*(i)*  *The alleged absence of reasons*\n---------------------------------------\n\n144.\n\nThe question presented by the Applicant in this annulment proceeding is whether the Award includes sufficient reasons to enable the reader to understand how the Tribunal got from Point A (the Tribunal's finding that the Applicant possessed property and contractual rights associated with Po\u0161tov\u00e1's GGB interests) to Point B (the conclusion that the Tribunal lacked jurisdiction because there was no \u2018investment' under the Slovakia-Greece BIT).\n\n145.\n\nIn respect of \"Point A\", the Applicant considers that there are three \"Point As\" contained in the Award: (i) the Tribunal's acknowledgement in the Award of the Applicant's contractual rights against the Participants;85 (ii) the Tribunal's acknowledgement of the Applicant's property rights against the Participants;86 and (iii) the Tribunal's acknowledgement of the Applicant's property rights against the Greek government.87 As discussed above, the Respondent does not agree with the Applicant's characterization of the Tribunal's findings.\n\nMemorial, para. 32, quoting para. 347 of the Award.\n\nMemorial, para. 32, quoting para. 348 of the Award.\n\nMemorial, para. 32, quoting Award paras. 345 and 348 and citing Law 2198 of 1994, (R-0108), Art. 8.2.\n\n146.\n\nThe Applicant has argued that, although the Award explicitly recognizes certain rights arising from the GGBs, there is an absence of reasoning to explain why these rights did not constitute an investment under the Treaty. Furthermore, the Applicant argues that the findings included in the Award are contradictory.\n\n147.\n\nIn considering the Parties' arguments, the Committee has carefully reviewed the Tribunal's analysis in the Award, which leads to the conclusion that there was no \u2018investment' within the meaning of Article 1(1) of the Treaty. The Tribunal's reasoning in respect of its decision that Po\u0161tov\u00e1 did not have an investment within the meaning of the Treaty is described in detail in paragraphs 248 to 350 of the Award, and is summarized in Section II of this Award.\n\n148.\n\nAt the outset of its analysis concerning Article 1(1) of the Slovakia-Greece BIT, the Tribunal described its approach to Treaty interpretation in accordance with Articles 31(1) and 31(2) of the VCLT. The Tribunal notes that the elements contained in Article 31(1) (i.e. the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty, in their context, in light of the treaty's object and purpose) \" *form a single rule of interpretation and may not be taken separately or in isolation* \".88 The Tribunal further states its view that \" *an interpretation in goodfaith. requires elements of reasonableness that go beyond the mere verbal or purely literal analysis*.\"89\n\nAward, para. 282.\n\nAward, para. 284.\n\n149.\n\nThe Tribunal then applied this interpretive approach to Article 1(1) of the Slovakia-Greece BIT. Although the Tribunal confirmed its agreement with the Claimants that the concept of \"investment\" articulated in the *chapeau* of Article 1(1) is broad, it expressed its view that it is not persuaded that the definition is unlimited.\n\n150.\n\nThe Tribunal stated that *\"[i]f the chapeau of Article 1(1) is interpreted in isolation, in a mere literal manner or solely in conjunction with Article 1(1)(c), it would mean that: (i) any asset of any nature whatsoever would qualify as an investment under the Slovakia-Greece BIT; but (ii) that the list contained in Article 1(1) of the BIT would be useless or meaningless.* \"90\n\nAward, para. 312.\n\n151.\n\nThe Tribunal concluded that an interpretation of Article 1(1) of the BIT, considering its wording, and the object and purpose of the treaty, as required by the VCLT, lead it to the result that the definition was not unlimited:\n\n*...an interpretation of the text and context of Article 1(1) leads the Tribunal to consider that the State parties to the treaty wanted an ample definition of what could constitute an investment, but within certain categories that are also broad, but not unlimited. Otherwise, the examples could be expanded to include any asset whatsoever, and would become useless or meaningless.*\n\n*The categories selected by the State parties must be considered in determining if an asset, that may constitute an investment, is included in the categories of investments selected by the States. In such consideration, the Tribunal must balance the broadness of the categories with the limits that result from their inclusion in the treaty.91*\n\nAward, paras. 314-315.\n\n152.\n\nAs has been emphasized by the Applicant in the annulment proceeding, the question which the Tribunal addressed in the Award to reach the determination that the Applicant did not have a qualifying investment under the BIT was the following, set out in paragraph 316 of the Award:\n\n*[A]n interpretation of Article 1(1) of the Slovakia-Greece BIT requires a determination of whether Po\u0161tov\u00e1 banka\u2019s interests in the GGBs fit within the specific, but wide, category or group of investments listed in sections (a) to (f), and specifically a determination as to whether, in the words of Claimants, the GGBs* \"fall squarely within Article 1.1 (c) of the Slovakia-Greece BIT\" (\" *loans, claims to money or to any performance under contract having a financial value\")* (...).\n\n153.\n\nThe Committee does not find any difficulty in following the reasoning set out by the Tribunal in answering this question. The Tribunal recognized that the definition of investment contained in Article 1(1) of the Slovakia-Greece BIT is broad. But the Tribunal found that the definition is not limitless and does not include sovereign debt. In reaching this conclusion, the Tribunal provided a detailed description of the characteristics of sovereign debt and securities, which, in its view, place Po\u0161tov\u00e1's GGB interests outside the definition of investment.\n\n154.\n\nThe Tribunal emphasized that neither Article 1(1) nor any other provisions of the Treaty refer to \" *to sovereign debt, public titles, public securities, public obligations or the like\"* stating that the *\"BIT does not contain language that may suggest that the State parties considered, in the wide category of investments of the list of Article 1(1) of the BIT, public debt or public obligations, much less sovereign debt, as an investment under the treaty.* \"92\n\nAward, para. 332.\n\n155.\n\nGreece has stated that Po\u0161tov\u00e1 did not argue during the arbitration proceeding that the ancillary rights associated with its GGB interests were investments, separate from the GGB rights. The Applicant argues that its application for partial annulment is based on the text of the Award, and that the Tribunal made explicit findings as to the rights associated with the GGBs in its analysis based on the arguments presented by the Parties.\n\n156.\n\nThe Committee understands from the text of the Award, and from the arguments presented during the annulment proceeding, that no argument was advanced during the arbitration proceeding that rights associated with the GGBs independently constituted an investment under the Treaty. From the Award, the Committee understands that the Claimant's argument in the arbitration was that Po\u0161tov\u00e1's investment fell \" *squarely within* \" Article 1(1)(c) (i.e. \" *loans, claims to money or to any performance under contract having a financial value* \"). It is therefore not surprising that the Tribunal did not address, as a separate question, whether the ancillary rights associated with the sovereign debt constituted an investment under the Treaty.\n\n*(ii)*  *The alleged contradictory reasons*\n-------------------------------------------\n\n157.\n\nThe Committee now turns to the Applicant's supplemental argument that certain reasons included in the Award are contradictory. As discussed above, contradictory reasons can justify an annulment of an Award only if the reasons are so fundamentally contradictory, that they amount to no reasons at all.\n\n158.\n\nThe Committee does not consider that the analysis included in the Award is contradictory. As described above, the Award explains the view of the Tribunal that sovereign bonds, as compared to participation in a company, were not within the intended scope of the Treaty. There is no inconsistency between the Tribunal's finding that, as a matter of interpretation, sovereign bonds were not intended to fall within the broad definition of investment included in the Treaty and the finding that, in this case, certain specific rights related to sovereign bonds fell outside the intended scope of that definition. The Committee therefore does not consider that there are contradictory reasons in the Award which would justify partial annulment.\n\n*(iii)*  *Whether the alleged errors were outcome-determinative*\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n159.\n\nThe Parties have made a number of arguments concerning the legal significance of the section of the Award that addresses the Tribunal's jurisdiction under Article 25 of the ICSID Convention (paragraphs 351 to 371 of the Award). As the Committee has not found an absence in reasoning which could potentially justify an annulment, it is not necessary for the Committee to consider the Parties' arguments in respect of this element.\n\n160.\n\nHaving considered the Parties' arguments in respect of the Application for partial annulment, the Committee decides that the high threshold required for annulment under Article 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention is not satisfied and the Applicant's request for partial annulment is therefore not granted.\n\n**VI. COSTS**\n-------------\n\n161.\n\nIn their respective pleadings, each of the Parties has sought to recover their costs and expenses in this annulment proceeding. As noted above, the Parties submitted their claims for costs on June 30, 2016. The Parties' positions are briefly summarized below.\n\n**A. The Applicant's Position**\n-------------------------------\n\n162.\n\nAccording to its June 30, 2016 cost submission, the Applicant's legal fees total USD 499,055.50 and its costs total USD 361,822.71. The Applicant's costs include its advance payments to ICSID in the amount of USD 300,000.00 and USD 25,000.00 lodging fee. The advances to ICSID for the annulment proceeding were covered solely by the Applicant in accordance with Regulation 14(3)(e) of the Administrative and Financial Regulations.\n\n163.\n\nThe Applicant argued that it is entitled to a partial annulment of the Award and, in those circumstances, requested that the Committee direct the Respondent to bear the costs of the proceeding in full, in line with the *ad hoc* Committees in *Sempra v. Argentina*93 and *MHS v.* *Malaysia94* The Applicant also argues that Greece falls \" *far short of its own standardfor a costs award that the annulment application must be \u2018clearly meritless\u2019* \" in order for a respondent to recover its expenses.95\n\n*Sempra Energy International v. Argentine Republic*, (ICSID Case No. ARB/02/16), Decision on Annulment, June 29, 2010, (CL-0162), paras. 227-228.\n\n*Malaysian Historical Salvors SDN BHD v. Government of Malaysia* (ICSID Case No. ARB/05/10), Decision on the Application for Annulment, April 16, 2009, (CL-0161), paras. 82-83.\n\nReply, para. 43.\n\n164.\n\nThe Applicant has also taken the position that Greece has unnecessarily increased the costs of the annulment proceeding by raising irrelevant arguments and attempting to re-litigate its case on the facts and relied on *EURAM v. The Slovak Republic*96 and *LETCO v. Liberia*97 for their claim that such behavior merits an adverse finding of costs.98\n\n*European American Investment Bank AG v. The Slovak Republic*, UNCITRAL, Award on Costs, August 20, 2014, (CL-0158), para. 43 (stating that procedural misconduct is a \" *material consideration, particularly where it has led to costs being unnecessarily incurred*.\").\n\n*Liberian Eastern Timber Corporation (LETCO) v. The Government of the Republic of Liberia*, ICSID Case No. ARB/83/2, Award, March 31, 1986, (CL-0160), para. 675 (awarding costs against Liberia based \" *largely on Liberia\u2019s procedural bad faith* \").\n\nReply, para. 44.\n\n**B. The Respondent's Position**\n--------------------------------\n\n165.\n\nIn its submission of June 30, 2016, the Respondent claimed that it incurred legal fees and expenses to the amount of \u20ac 928,174.06 in this annulment proceeding. The Respondent requests that the Committee order the Applicant to pay the Respondent's legal fees and expenses.\n\n166.\n\nThe Respondent noted that several *ad hoc* committees have held that in circumstances where an application was \" *clearly without merit* \" the losing applicant should bear all costs and expenses.99 The Respondent argues that it should recover its costs incurred in the annulment proceeding because the application for partial annulment \" *fundamentally lacks merit*.\"100 In particular, the Respondent argues that the Applicant has sought to \" *re-litigate its case* \"101 by raising arguments that were not presented to the Tribunal in the arbitration proceeding, and that the Applicant has mischaracterized the Tribunal's findings.\n\nRejoinder, para. 58, with reference to *AES v. Hungary*, para. 181.\n\nRejoinder, para. 58.\n\nRejoinder, para. 58.\n\n**C. The Committee's Analysis**\n-------------------------------\n\n167.\n\nThe Committee notes that Article 61(2) of the ICSID Convention, which is contained in its Chapter VI titled \"Cost of Proceedings,\" states that:\n\n*[T]he Tribunal shall, except as the parties otherwise agree, assess the expenses incurred by the parties in connection with the proceedings, and shall decide how and by whom those* *expenses, the fees and expenses of the members of the Tribunal and the charges for the use of the facilities of the Centre shall be paid. Such decision shall form part of the Award.*\n\n168.\n\nIn addition, Rule 47(1)(j) of the Arbitration Rules states that the award shall contain \" *any decision of the Tribunal regarding the cost of the proceeding*.\" In accordance with Article 52(4) of the ICSID Convention, Article 61(2) \" *shall apply* mutatis mutandis *to proceedings before the Committee*.\" Rule 53 of the Arbitration Rules specifies that the Arbitration Rules shall apply to any procedure relating to the annulment of an award and to the decision of the Committee.\n\n169.\n\nIn accordance with Regulation 14(3)(e), the Applicant has made two advance payments to ICSID to cover the costs of this annulment proceeding, including the costs and expenses of the Centre and fees and expenses of the Members of the *ad hoc* Committee (\"Costs of the Proceeding\"). The fees and expenses of the Committee and ICSID's administrative fees and expenses have been paid out of the advances made by the Applicant and amount to USD 205,159.99, divided as follows (in USD):102\n\nCommittee's fees and expenses 125,284.62\n\nProfessor Azzedine Kettani 50,455.97\n\nSir David Edward 29,962.28\n\nProfessor Hi-Taek Shin 44,866.37\n\nICSID's administrative fee 64,000.00\n\nOther disbursements (estimated)103 15,875.37\n\nTotal 205,159.99\n\nThe ICSID Secretariat will provide the Parties with a detailed Financial Statement of the case account as soon as all invoices are received and the account is final.\n\nThe amount includes estimated charges (courier, printing and copying) in respect of the dispatch of this Decision on Annulment,\n\n170.\n\nThe Committee has rejected the Application for Partial Annulment. A number of *ad hoc* committees have in such circumstances allocated the Costs of the Proceeding to the Applicant.104 For example, in *M.C.I. Power v. Ecuador* the Committee stated that a consequence of Regulation 14(3)(e) \" *which imposes on the party who applies for annulment the financial burden of advancing the costs, should normally be that the Applicant, when annulment is refused, remains* *responsible for these costs.* \"105 The Committee therefore decides that the Applicant shall bear the Costs of the Proceeding.\n\nSee E.g. *Antoine Abou Lahoud and Leila Bounafeh-Abou Lahoud v. Democratic Republic of the Congo*, ICSID Case No. ARB/10/4, Decision on the Application for Annulment of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, March 29, 2016, (RL-0154) para. 240; *Ioan Micula, Viorel Micula and others v. Romania*, ICSID Case No. ARB/05/20, Decision on Annulment, February 26, 2016 (RL-0156), para. 349; *Adem Dogan v. Turkmenistan*, ICSID Case No. ARB/09/9, Decision on Annulment, January 15, 2016, (CL-0157), para. 281; *Tulip v. Turkey,* para. 230; *Kili\u00e7 Insaat ithalat ihracat Sanayi ve Ticaret Anonim Sirketi v. Turkmenistan,* ICSID Case No. ARB/10/1, Decision on Annulment, July 14, 2015, (Rl-0153), para. 208.\n\n*M.C.I. Power Group, L.C. and New Turbine, Inc. v. Republic of* Ecuador, ICSID Case No. ARB/03/6, Decision on Annulment, October 19, 2009, (\" *M.C.I. Power v. Ecuador\"*) (RL-0140), para. 89.\n\n171.\n\nThe Committee does not share the Respondent's view, however, that the Application for annulment was \" *clearly without merit* \". In this annulment proceeding, the Applicant has raised good questions, which were narrowly and effectively pleaded.\n\n172.\n\nThe Committee's view is that both of the Parties have acted in an efficient, professional and courteous manner throughout the pendency of the annulment proceeding. In these circumstances, the Committee decides that each party shall bear its own costs for legal representation and expenses incurred in this annulment proceeding.\n\n**VII. DECISION**\n-----------------\n\n173.\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, the *ad hoc* Committee decides that:\n\n(1) Po\u0161tov\u00e1 banka's Application for Partial Annulment of the Award dated April 9, 2015 is dismissed;\n\n(2) Po\u0161tov\u00e1 banka shall bear the full costs and expenses incurred by ICSID in these annulment proceedings, including the fees and expenses of the Members of the Committee; and\n\n(3) Each Party shall bear its own costs for legal representation and expenses in the annulment proceeding."}]}
