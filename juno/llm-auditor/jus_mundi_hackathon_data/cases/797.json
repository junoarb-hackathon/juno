The Proceedings**\n----------------------\n\n1.\n\nThe present arbitration was initiated on July 10, 1998, when Claimant, Wena Hotels Limited (\"Wena\"),1 filed a request for arbitration with the Secretary-General of the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (\"ICSID\"). The request was filed against Respondent, the Arab Republic of Egypt (\"Egypt\"), and asserted that \"[a]s a result of Egypt's expropriation of and failure to protect Wena's investment in Egypt, Wena has suffered enormous losses leading to the almost total collapse of its business.\"2 Wena requested the following relief:\n\n(a) a declaration that Egypt has breached its obligations to Wena by expropriating Wena's investments without providing prompt, adequate and effective compensation, and by failing to accord Wena's investments in Egypt fair and equitable treatment and full protection and security;\n\n(b) an order that Egypt pay Wena damages in respect of the loss it has suffered through Egypt's conduct described above, in an amount to be quantified precisely during this proceeding but, in any event, no less than USD 62,820,000; and\n\n(c) an order that Egypt pay Wena's costs occasioned by this arbitration, including the arbitrators' fees and administrative costs fixed by ICSID, the expenses of the arbitrators, the fees and expenses of any experts, and the legal costs incurred by the parties (including fees of counsel).3\n\nThe Acting Secretary-General registered the request for arbitration on July 31, 1998.\n\nWena Hotels Limited is a British company incorporated in 1982 under the laws of England and Wales. *See* Certificate of Incorporation on Change of Name of Wena Hotels Limited (April 22, 1982) [Annexes W1 & E-J2]. Note, in referencing the documentary annexes submitted by the parties, the notation \"W\" indicates a document submitted by Claimant, Wena Hotels Limited. The notation \"E-J\" indicates a document submitted by Respondent, the Arab Republic of Egypt as part of its briefing on jurisdiction; a notation of \"E-M\" indicates a document submitted by Egypt as part of its briefing on the merits.\n\nClaimant's Request for Arbitration, at 1 (submitted on July 10, 1998).\n\nId., at l8.\n\n2.\n\nIn accordance with Article 37(2)(a) of the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and nationals of Other States (\"the ICSID Convention\"), the parties agreed that the Tribunal was to consist of three arbitrators, one appointed by each party and the third, presiding, arbitrator, appointed by agreement of the parties or, in the absence of such agreement, by agreement of the two party-appointed arbitrators. Wena appointed Professor Ibrahim Fadlallah, a national of Lebanon, as an arbitrator. Egypt then appointed Hamzeh Ahmed Haddad, a national of Jordan, as an arbitrator. In accordance with Article 38 of the ICSID Convention, the Chairman of ICSID's Administrative Council was requested by Wena to appoint the third, presiding, arbitrator. The Center informed the parties that the Secretary-General of ICSID was planning to recommend Mr. Monroe Leigh, a United States national, for the Chairman's appointment. Having received no objection from either party, the Center informed the parties that the Chairman of the ICSID's Administrative Council had appointed Mr. Leigh as the arbitrator to be the President of the Arbitral Tribunal. Having received from each arbitrator the acceptance of his appointment, the Center informed the parties that the Tribunal was deemed to be constituted and the proceedings to have begun on December 18.1998. The parties subsequently agreed that the Tribunal had been properly constituted under the provisions of the ICSID Convention.\n\n3.\n\nThe Tribunal held its first session, at the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague, on February 11, 1999. During this first session, Egypt objected to the request for arbitration filed by Wena and expressed reservations as to the Tribunal's jurisdiction to hear the request.\n\n4.\n\nThe Tribunal, pursuant to Article 41(2) of the ICSID Convention, granted the parties an opportunity to brief the jurisdictional objections. The parties filed four sets of papers (including accompanying documentary annexes) with the Tribunal:\n\n(1) Respondent's Memorial on its Objections to Jurisdiction (submitted on March 4, 1999);\n\n(2) Claimant's Response to Respondent's Objections on Jurisdiction (submitted on March 25, 1999);\n\n(3) Respondent's Reply on Jurisdiction (submitted on April 8.1999); and\n\n(4) Claimant's Rejoinder on Jurisdiction (submitted on April 22, 1999).\n\nIn its briefing, Egypt raised four objections to jurisdiction. First, Egypt asserted that it had \"not agreed to arbitrate with the Claimant as it is, by virtue of ownership, to be treated as an Egyptian company.\"4 Second, Egypt argued that\" [t]he Claimant has made no investment in Egypt.\"5 Third, Egypt claimed that \"[t]here is no legal dispute between the Claimant and the Respondent.\"6 Finally, Egypt contended that\" [t]he Claimant's consent to arbitration in the Request for Arbitration is insufficient and its Request premature.\"7\n\nRespondent's Memorial on its Objections to Jurisdiction, at 1 (submitted on March 4, 1999) (\"Respondent's Memorial on Jurisdiction\").\n\n*Id.*\n\n*Id, at 2.*\n\n*Id*\n\n5.\n\nThe Tribunal heard oral argument on Respondent's objections to jurisdiction during a second session, at the offices of the World Bank in Paris, on May 25, 1999. During the session, Egypt withdrew two of its four objections. First, it noted that the \"the papers that we have now been supplied as part of [Wena's briefing] do indicate at least a *prima facie* case that the Claimant has made an investment, that money was spent in the development and renovation of the hotels and that the money was paid for by the Claimant, rather than any other party.\"8 Thus, \"for the purpose of establishing jurisdiction only, the Respondent is willing to accept that an investment has been made.\"9\n\nTribunal's Decision on Jurisdiction, at 8-9 (released on June 29.1999) (quoting Recordings from Tribunal's Session on Jurisdiction, Offices of the World Bank, Paris (on May 25, 1999)).\n\n*Id.,* at 9.\n\n6.\n\nSecond, Respondent also withdrew its procedural objections to Claimant's request for arbitration. As Egypt appropriately observed, even if the Tribunal had endorsed its objections, the alleged defects could have been easily rectified. Noting that \"it is not our wish to raise argument simply for the purpose of being difficult or to delay,\" Egypt advised \"that as far as that particular objection is concerned, we are prepared to forgo it.\"10\n\n*Id.*\n\n7.\n\nIn its Decision on Jurisdiction dated June 29.1999, the Tribunal concluded that Respondent's two remaining jurisdictional objections should be denied and that jurisdiction should be exercised over the dispute. Specifically, the Tribunal: (1) declined to adopt Egypt's contention that Wena should be treated as an Egyptian company for purposes of the Agreement for the Promotion and Protection of Investments between Egypt and the United Kingdom (\"IPPA\"),11 and (2) found, without prejudice to the merits of the case, that Wena had at least alleged a *prima facie* legal dispute with Egypt.12 The Tribunal proceeded to set a briefing schedule on the merits and proposed dates for oral argument.\n\n*Id.,* at 10-19.\n\n*Id.,* at 21-23.\n\n8.\n\nOn August 14, 1999, Professor Hamzeh Ahmed Haddad resigned from the Tribunal \u2014 apologizing that, as a result of his new duties as Minister of Justice for Jordan, he would no longer be able to continue as a member of the Tribunal. The Tribunal was reconstituted on September 14, 1999 with the appointment by Egypt of Mr. Michael F. Hoellering as the replacement for Professor Haddad.\n\n9.\n\nThe parties filed four sets of papers (each including voluminous accompanying documentary annexes) with the Tribunal addressing the merits of the case:\n\n(1) Claimant's Memorial on the Merits (submitted on July 26, 1999);\n\n(2) Respondent's Memorial on the Merits (submitted on September 6, 1999);\n\n(3) Claimant's Reply on the Merits (submitted on September 27, 1999); and\n\n(4) Respondent's Rejoinder on the Merits (submitted on October 18, 1999).\n\n10.\n\nRegrettably, the session on the merits \u2014 which had been scheduled for November 15-18, 1999 \u2014 had to be postponed by the sudden hospitalization of Mr. Hoeliering for a medical emergency. On November 15, 1999, Mr. Hoeliering resigned from the Tribunal \u2014 apologizing for the inconvenience \"this unexpected turn of events\" had caused.\n\n11.\n\nThe Tribunal was reconstituted on December 9, 1999, with the appointment by Egypt of Professor Don Wallace, Jr. as the replacement for Mr. Hoellering. The Tribunal subsequently fixed a new schedule for oral argument on the merits.\n\n12.\n\nThe Tribunal heard witnesses and oral argument on the merits during its third session, at the offices of the World Bank in Paris, on April 25-29, 2000.13 In lieu of closing argument, the Tribunal permitted the parties to file post-hearing briefs. The Tribunal also requested that the parties submit proposed findings of fact, chronologies of events and statements of their attorney's fees and costs. In accordance with this schedule, the parties filed a final round of papers with the Tribunal:\n\n(1) Claimant's Post-Hearing Brief (submitted on May 30, 2000);\n\n(2) Respondent's Post-Hearing Memorial (submitted on May 30, 2000);\n\n(3) Claimant's Post-Hearing Reply (submitted on June 15, 2000); and\n\n(4) Respondent's Post-Hearing Rebuttal Memorial (submitted on June 15, 2000).\n\nFull, verbatim transcripts were made of the session and distributed to the parties and the Tribunal following each day of the hearing.\n\n13.\n\nOn July 13, 2000, the Tribunal issued a Procedural Order concerning the introduction of certain documents into the proceeding subsequent to the hearing. As part of this Order, the Tribunal admitted into the record, without prejudice to their probative value, nine documents submitted by Wena with its Post-Hearing Reply brief14 and a memorandum dated January 19.1997 on the El-Nile Hotel prepared by Arthur Andersen & Co., which the Tribunal had received from the U.S. Agency for International Development.15\n\nAnnexes W179& 187-194.\n\nAnnex W183. Wena had sought the Arthur Anderson report (which was prepared for the benefit of Egypt under a Contract with the U.S. Agency for International Development) from Egypt as early as August 30, 1999. Notwithstanding this request and the Tribunal's subsequent directions to search for this document, Egypt never produced a copy of the report. At the Tribunal's April 25, 2000 session on the merits (and, again, in the Respondent's Post-Hearing Memorial), Egypt's counsel explained what efforts the Egyptian State Lawsuit Authority had taken to obtain a copy of the report, without success. *See* Transcript of Tribunal's Session on the Merits (\"TR\") Day 1, at 80:27-81:21; Respondent's Post-Hearing Memorial, Appendix E (submitted on May 30, 2000). Shortly after the session, however, the ICSID Secretariat obtained a copy of the report form the U.S. Agency for International Development.\n\n14.\n\nOn November 1, 2000, the Secretary of the Tribunal issued a letter, advising the parties of the closure of the proceedings, pursuant to Arbitration Rule 38(1).\n\n**II. The Facts**\n-----------------\n\n15.\n\nThis dispute arose out of long-term agreements to lease and develop two hotels located in Luxor and Cairo, Egypt. Having received voluminous submissions from the two parties and heard five days of oral testimony, the Tribunal hereby makes the following findings of fact:\n\n**A. U.K.-Egypt Agreement for the Promotion and Protection of Investments**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n16.\n\nOn June 11, 1975, the United Kingdom and the Arab Republic of Egypt entered into an Agreement for the Promotion and Protection of Investments (\"IPPA\").16 Under Article 2(1) of the IPPA, Egypt and the United Kingdom promised to\" encourage and create favorable conditions for nationals or companies of other Contracting Party to invest capital in its territory.\" They also guaranteed that\" [investments of nationals or companies of either Contracting Party shall at all times be accorded fair and equitable treatment and shall enjoy full protection and security in the territory of the other Contracting Party.\"17 Finally, Egypt and the United Kingdom agreed that \"[i]nvestments of nationals or companies of either Contracting Party shall not be nationalised, expropriated or subjected to measures having effect equivalent to nationalisation or expropriation... in the territory of the other Contracting Party except for a public purpose related to the internal needs of the Party and against prompt, adequate and effective compensation.\"18 As discussed in the Tribunal's previous Decision on Jurisdiction, Wena is a British company for purposes of the IPPA.19\n\nAgreement for the Promotion and Protection of Investments, June 11, 1975, U.K.-Egypt (\"IPPA\") [Annexes W2 & E-J22].\n\n*Id.,* art 2(2).\n\n*Id.,* art. 5(1).\n\n**See** Certificate of Incorporation on Change of Name of Wena Hotels Limited (April 22, 1982) [Annexes W1 & E-J2]. As discussed above, although Egypt never challenged the fact that Wena Hotels Limited was incorporated as a British company, it asserted as part of its objections to jurisdiction that Wena \"by virtue of Mr. El-Farargy's ownership and his Egyptian nationality, [should] be treated as an Egyptian company pursuant to Article 8(1)\" of the IPPA. Respondent's Reply on Jurisdiction, at 2 (submitted on April 8.1999). The Tribunal, however, rejected Egypt's proposed construction of Article 8(1) of the IPPA and, thus, determined that Wena was an English company for purposes of the IPPA. **See** Decision on Jurisdiction, at 10-19.\n\n**B. Luxor and Nile Hotel Agreements**\n--------------------------------------\n\n17.\n\nOn August 8, 1989, Wena and the Egyptian Hotels Company (\"EHC\"), \"a company of the Egyptian Public Sector affiliated to the General Public Sector Authority for Tourism\"20 entered into a 21 year, 6 month \"Lease and Development Agreement\" for the Luxor Hotel in Luxor, Egypt.21 Pursuant to the agreement, Wena was to \"operate and manage the 'Hotel' exclusively for [its] account through the original or extended period of the 'Lease,' to develop and raise the operating efficiency and standard of the 'Hotel' to an upgraded four star hotel according to the specification of the Egyptian Ministry of Tourism or upgratly [sic] it to a five star hotel if [Wena] so elects...,\"22 The agreement provided that EHC would not interfere \"in the management and or/operation of the 'Hotel' or interfere with the enjoyment of the lease\" by Wena and that disputes between the parties would be resolved through arbitration.23 The lease was awarded to Wena in a competitive bid, after Wena agreed to pay a higher rent than another potential investor.24\n\n*See* section II.G, *infra,* concerning the relationship between EHC and Egypt.\n\nLuxor Hotel Lease and Development Agreement (August 8, 1989) [Annex W5]\n\n*Id.,* art. in.\n\n*Id.,* arts. I, XIII & XV(3).\n\nDirect Examination of Mr. Yusseri Mahmud Hamid Hajjaj, TR Day 5, at 4:3-11 (\"Yusseri Direct Ex.\").\n\n18.\n\nOn January 28, 1990, Wena and EHC entered into an almost identical, 25-year agreement for the El Nile Hotel in Cairo, Egypt.25 Wena also entered into an October 1, 1989 Training Agreement with EHC and Egyptian Ministry of Tourism \"to train in the United Kingdom... Egyptian nationals in the skills of hotel management...,\"26\n\nEl Nile Hotel Lease and Development Agreement (January 28, 1990) [Annex W4].\n\nAn Agreement between His Excellency Fouad Sultan, Minster of Tourism for the Egyptian Government, jointly with Mr. Kamal Kandil of the Egyptian Hotels Company and Wena Hotels Limited (October 1, 1989) [Annex W6],\n\n**C. Events Leading up to the April 1,1991 Seizures**\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n19.\n\nShortly after entering into the agreements, disputes arose between EHC and Wena concerning their respective obligations. Wena claims that it \"found the condition of the Hotels to be far below that stipulated in the lease [and] withheld part of the rent, as the lease permitted.\"27 In turn, Egypt claims that Wena \"failed to pay rent due to EHC... and EHC in turn liquidated the performance security posted by Claimant.\"28 In the view which the Tribunal takes of this case it is not necessary at this time to determine the truth of these conflicting allegations. It is sufficient for this proceeding simply to acknowledge, as both parties agree, that there were serious disagreements between Wena and EHC about their respective obligations under the leases.\n\nClaimant's Request for Arbitration, at 8.\n\nRespondent's Memorial on Jurisdiction, at 4.\n\n20.\n\nOn May 3.1990, Wena instituted arbitration proceedings in Egypt against EHC concerning their disputes over the Luxor Hotel. In an award dated November 14.1990, the *ad hoc* arbitral tribunal ordered EHC to make repairs to the Luxor Hotel and ordered Wena to pay its outstanding rental obligations.29 Wena subsequently brought an action in the South Cairo Court to have the arbitration set aside.30\n\nFinal Award in *Wena Hotels Ltd. v. Egyptian Hotel Company* (November 14, 1990) [Annex E-M17],\n\nDeclaration of Mr. Nael El-Farargy, \u00b6 14, attached to Claimant's Memorial on the Merits (submitted on July 26, 1999) (\"Farargy Declaration\"). The Respondent's Memorial on Jurisdiction also reports that Wena brought \"a nullity action (No. 18644 of 1990), which was refused by South Cairo Court on February 27, 1994.\" Respondent's Memorial on Jurisdiction, at 4. However, a copy of the South Cairo Court's decision was not provided to the Tribunal.\n\n21.\n\nAt about the same time, \"toward the end of 1990,\" according to Wena's parliamentary consultant, Mr. Humfrey Malins, M.P., \"rumour, I think, must have reached Mr. Faragy because he told me that there were rumours that there would be violence and the hotels would be violently seized back.\"31 As a result, in December 1990, Mr. Malins traveled to Egypt to meet with the Egyptian Minister of Tourism, Minister Fouad Sultan, and the Egyptian Minister of the Interior, Minister Halim Moussa.32 Mr. Malins recounted that\" [b]oth Ministers gave me their separate, absolute assurances... that no violence could or would take place.\"33\n\nDirect Examination of Mr. Humfrey Malins, M.P., TR Day 4, at 174:26-29 (\"Malins Direct Ex.\"). The Tribunal generally found Mr. Malins to be a reliable and convincing witness, with no apparent financial or personal stake in the outcome of the arbitration. *See also* Farargy Declaration, \u00b6\u00b6 17-19.\n\nMalins Direct Ex., TR Day 4, at 175:1-4.\n\n*Id.,* at 175:25-29. *See also* Declaration of Mr. Humfrey Malins, M.P., \u00b6 4, attached to Claimant's Memorial on the Merits (\"Malins Declaration\").\n\n22.\n\nNevertheless, disagreements between Wena and EHC continued. On February 11.1991,Mr.Nael El-Farargy, Wena's founder, wrote to Minister Sultan, seeking his intervention to resolve these on-going disputes as well as to offset financial difficulties caused by the Gulf War.34 In his letter, Mr Farargy mentions that EHC had threatened to repossess the hotels through force:\n\n*officials from the Egyptian Hotels Company threatened to storm the hotels and expel us,* and this was after our Company had spent the sums previously outlined. The matter reached a point were [sic] the Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Egyptian Hotels Company issued a decision for his company to take possession of the Luxor Hotel without a legal ruling or any other measure [to support his decision].35\n\nLetter from Mr. Nael El-Farargy (Wena Hotels Ltd.) to Minister Fouad Sultan (Minister of Tourism) (February 11, 1991) [Witness Statement of Minister Fouad Sultan, Attachment A, attached to Respondent's Memorial on the Merits (submitted on September 6, 1999) (\"Sultan Statement\"); also Annexes E-M21 & W127], At the time of the events that are the subject of this dispute, Minister Sultan was the Minister for Tourism and Civil Aviation of Egypt. Minister Sultan held this position from 1985 to 1993. Sultan Statement, \u00b6 3.

During the meeting, Minister Sultan declared that\" [t]he Ministry took no pleasure from any misunderstandings with investors; however, at the same time it could not accept any excesses in respect of any of the Government's rights.\"37 The Minister proposed a series of compromises between the parties. Wena, however, subsequently did not accept the Minister's proposals.38\n\nMinutes of Meeting between Representatives of the Ministry of Tourism, EHC and Wena (February 26.1991) [Sultan Statement, Attachment B; also Annexes E-M22 & W124].\n\n*Id*\n\nDirect Examination of Mr. Nael El-Farargy, TR Day 1, at 147:17-25 (\"Farargy Direct Ex.\"). *See also* Letter from Mr. Kamal Kandil (Chairman, EHC) to Mr. Ahmad Al-Khawaga (Attorney for Wena) (March 3, 1991) [Annexes W125 & E-M23]; Witness Statement of Mr. Munir Abdul Al-Aziz Gaballah Shalabi, \u00b613, attached to Respondent's Rejoinder on the Merits (submitted on October 18, 1999) (\"Munir Statement\"). The Witness Statement of Mr. Munir should not be confused with the Summary of Evidence to be given by Mr. Munir Abdul Al-Aziz Gaballah Shalabi, attached to Respondent's Memorial on the Merits, because counsel for Egypt were unable to obtain a signed witness statement from Mr. Munir before submitting their Memorial on the Merits, counsel submitted a short Summary of Evidence instead \u2014 providing the witness statement when it subsequently became available.\n\n24.\n\nOn March 21, 1991, Mr. Kandil wrote to Minister Sultan, noting that Wena had refused to accept the Minister's proposals.39 Mr. Kandil proposed to Minister Sultan:\n\nthat the following steps be taken:\n\n(One) the Letter of Guarantee for the Nile Hotel be seized and the sum deducted from their debt;\n\n(Two) the contractual relationship for the two hotels be terminated;\n\n(Three) *the two hotels be taken and the license withdrawn-,*\n\n(Four) list all development work at the two hotels and deduct it from their debt; and,\n\n(Five) in the even that the company is still in debt following these measures, proceedings should be taken to seize [the outstanding money] in the United Kingdom.40\n\nAlternatively, Mr. Kandil suggested that Minister Sultan establish a 10-day grace period for Wena to \"pay its debts,\" with the understanding, however, that \"[i]n the event that the payment is not made, the license for the two hotels would be withdrawn and the Egyptian Hotels Company would take the measures that it view appropriate to preserve its rights.\"41 Mr. Kandil closed the letter by advising Minister Sultan: *\"We leave the matter to you.\"42*\n\nLetter from Mr. Kamal Kandil (Chairman, EHC) to Minister Fouad Sultan (Minister of Tourism) (March 21, 1991) [Sultan Statement, Attachment D; also Annex W126].\n\n*Id.* (emphasis added; brackets in original English translation).\n\n*Id.*\n\n*Id.* (emphasis added).\n\n25.\n\nMarginalia on this March 21, 1991 letter (in Minister Sultan's handwriting), indicate that Minister Sultan telephoned the British Ambassador to Egypt, asking the Ambassador to ascertain Wena's response to the proposed compromises from the February 26, 1991 meeting.43\n\n*Id.* (Arabic original). *See also* Cross examination of Minister Fouad Sultan, TR Day 3, at 235:23-237:27 (\"Sultan Cross-Ex.\"); Sultan Statement, \u00b6 17.\n\n26.\n\nContemporaneously, on March 25.1991, Mr. Malins wrote to Minister Sultan asking for another meeting in mid-April or May to discuss the continued disputes between Wena and EHC.44 Mr. Malins concluded his letter by requesting an understanding from the Minister that no actions would be taken until that meeting could occur: \"please confirm what must surely be [sic] right, mainly that all matters be 'absolutely frozen,' with no detrimental action of whatever nature being taken pending our meeting...,\"45\n\nLetter from Mr. Humfrey Malins, M.P. (Parliamentary Consultant, Wena) to Minister Fouad Sultan (Minister of Tourism) (March 25, 1991) [Annex W 128],\n\n*Id.*\n\n27.\n\nMinister Sultan personally did not reply to Mr. Malins' letter. Instead, although the letter had been sent to Minister Sultan and not EHC, on March 31, 1991, Mr. Kandil responded to Mr. Malins, referencing \"your fax dated 25th March 1991, concerning your request for a meeting, \u2014 in your capacity as the parliament advisor for Wena Ltd.....\"46 Mr. Kandil mentioned the February 26, 1991 meeting and Wena's refusal to accept the proposed compromises. Mr. Kandil ended his letter by threatening that \"the owning company will take all necessary measures to protect its rights which is considered a state ownership.\"47\n\nLetter from Mr. Kamal Kandil (Chairman, EHC) to Mr. Humfrey Malins, M.P. (Parliamentary Consultant, Wena) (March 31, 1991) [Annexes W81 & W129]. During the session on the merits, Minister Sultan suggested that perhaps Mr. Malins' March 25, 1991 letter had been faxed to EHC, not the Minister of Tourism (thus, potentially explaining why Mr. Kandil, and not Minister Sultan, responded to the letter). ***See*** Sultan Cross-Ex., TR Day 4, at 47:9-10 & 48:29-49:1. However, both the attached fax cover sheet and confirmation sheet for Mr. Malins' letter show that the letter was faxed to number 2829771 in Egypt. ***See*** Annex W128. Subsequent inquiry by counsel for Wena \"on May 29, 2000 to France Telecom's International Yellow Pages service\" determined that the \"same number (2829771) was given as the fax number listed for the Egyptian Ministry of Tourism.\" Claimant's Post-Hearing Brief, at 16 & n. 5 (submitted on May 30, 2000).

I have been surprised by violent knocking on the door and its breaking, shouting in the hall of the hotel and I saw three persons bursting into my office. They attacked me, slapping my face and breaking my eye-glasses. They took possession of my office by force and everything inside it.... I was prevented from getting in touch with anybody outside the hotel and they told me that all the telephones were cut.... I was entrusted to three persons holding rods and cudgels who took me out of the hotel by force and while I was going out I saw more than one hundred men inside the hotel, holding rods and cudgels, some of them were taking out a number of cartons, belongings and implements of the hotel to vehicles parking in front of the door of the hotel. I waited outside the hotel until arrival of the police when I was taken inside for inspection under guard of the police.69\n\nPolice Statement of Mr. Tamim Foda, at 5-6 (July 5, 1991) [Annex W134],\n\n36.\n\nMr. Mostafa Ahmed Osman, Financial Manager for Wena, who was \"taking my fast breaking meal at the restaurant on the ninth floor,\" reported being \"surprised by strange and suspicious persons [who] took me downstairs by force holding my arms to the administrative offices on the mezzanine...,\"70 According to Mr. Osman, one of the EHC employees \"threatened me, saying that he holds a licensed weapon and that he is ready to use it if I resist.

These vehicles were bearing the badge of the Egyptian Hotels Co.\"74 Afraid of \"being attacked[.] I rushed out of the hotel with my wife.\"75\n\nPolice Statement of Mr. Sherif Ibrahim Mohamed Khalifa, at 8 (July 6, 1991) [Annex W134],\n\n*Id.*\n\n*Id.,* at 9.\n\n*Id.*\n\n38.\n\nAnother guest of the restaurant, Mr. Mohamed Sabry Ismail Emam, stated that he \"heard shoutings and sounds of breaking coming from the side of the kitchen and somebody announcing in a loud voice that all the employees of the WENA HOTELS LTD have to go downstairs.\"76 When he \"tried to go downstairs escaping from this situation, one of the a/m took me downstairs and told me to go out quietly as the hotel had been seized by the Egyptian Hotels Co.\" and he noted several people \"carrying carton cases and taking them to buses parking in front of the hotel, bearing the badge of the Egyptian Hotels Co.\"77\n\nPolice Statement of Mr. Mohamed Sabry Ismail Emam, at 10 (July 6, 1991) [Annex W134] (capital letters in original).\n\n*Id.*\n\n39.\n\nA *Daily Telegraph* article describing the seizure reported that \" [o]ne British tourist said he was punched and gouged by 'semi-military types' who ordered him out of bed at 2 a.m.\"78 The article also quoted a \"British visitor\" as saying:\n\nThe new managers said we could stay, but I did not feel safe. They told me they were repossessing the hotel on government orders because of an argument between Wena managers and the authorities.79\n\n\"British Tourists are Beaten and Thrown Out of Egypt Hotels,\" *Daily Telegraph* (April 4, 1991) [Annex W7],\n\n*Id.*\n\n40.\n\nMr. Hany Mohamed Hassan Mohamed Wahba, a security guard at the Nile Hotel, also stated in a subsequent deposition to the police:\n\nWhile I was at the main entrance of the hotel, I saw a bus bearing the badge of the Egyptian Hotels Co. and numerous persons going into the hotel. They caught me and I was subject to personal searching. They were holding rods and cudgels and requested the key of the main door of the hotel. When I told them that I do not keep it and tried to inquire about the matter, as they were numerous, they tried to attack me and my colleagues.80\n\nMr. Wahba stated that he was taken \"to the rear gate by force threatening me with the rods and cudgels.\"81 As he was taken, Mr. Wahba \"saw the guests of the hotel rushing out in a state of fear and terror caused by their bursting into the hotel in this savage way.\"82 Mr. Wahba also reported seeing \"a group of the a/m persons going upstairs and another group cutting the telephone wires, a third group burst into the reception and broke the cupboards containing the guests' registers.\"83 Eventually, when he was released, Mr. Wahba \"proceeded with a number of the employees of the WENA HOTELS LTD who were thrown out with me, to the Tourist Police where we informed verbally about the event. Then the Policeman came to the hotel.\"84\n\nPolice Statement of Mr. Hany Mohamed Hassan Mohamed Wahba, at 11-12 (July 6, 1991).\n\n*Id.,* at 12.\n\n*Id.*\n\n*Id.*\n\n*Id.* (capital letters in original).\n\n41.\n\nAt approximately 8:45 p.m., Ms. Jelcic returned to the Nile hotel. She testified that she had just returned to her room when a group of men broke in, grabbed her and removed her from the hotel.85 According to Ms. Jelcic, the men \"had like Navy blue pants, dark pants, which is kind of unusual because they do not normally, you know, dress alike, so that gave me the illusion as if they were some sort of organization...,\"86 Ms. Jelcic testified that she and other Wena employees (including Mr. Webster) then stood outside the hotel, looking into the lobby where she says she noticed \"about four gentlemen or so that were standing in the lobby, towards the back of the lobby, and they were radically different from the other people that were in the lobby.... [t]hey were very well groomed, very well dressed....\"87 According to Ms. Jelcic, some of the Egyptian Wena staff \"told me that they were Ministry of Tourism officials.\"88 However, Ms. Jelcic admitted that she \"personally did not recognize them, no, but my staff, obviously the staff that were there saw the people come into the hotel on previous occasions, so I had no reason to doubt them.\"89 Mr. Webster also testified that, although he did not personally recognize any officials from the Ministry of Tourism, two of his Egyptian staff \"said to me that there were officials from the Ministry of Tourism in the lobby at the time.\"90\n\nJelcic Direct Ex., TR Day 3, at 92:17-93:24. *See also* Declaration of Ms. Angela Jelcic, 13, attached to Claimant's Memorial on the Merits (\"Jelcic Declaration\").\n\nJelcic Direct Ex., TR Day 3, at 94:11-16.\n\nJelcic Direct Ex., TR Day 3, at 97:1-5.\n\nJelcic Direct Ex., TR Day 3, at 97:7-8. *See also* Jelcic Declaration, \u00b613 (\"I recognized certain EHC executives and personnel, some of whom were standing with some other well-groomed men in suits.

Ms. Jelcic's statement, for example, begins \"I would like to make a complaint, charge and case against the Egyptian Hotels Company and the Ministry of Tourism of Egypt.\"91 Similarly, Mr. Webster's statement, which is titled \"Against the Egyptian Hotels Company/Ministry of Tourism,\" concludes \"[w]e therefore place and hold the Egyptian Hotel Company and Ministry of Tourism responsible for items as listed below and not returned immediately.\"92\n\nStatement of Ms. Angela Jelcic to Kasr El-Nile Police (April 2, 1991) [Annex W82]\n\nStatement of Mr. Simon Webster to Kasr El-Nile Police (April 2.1991) [Annex W83]. Similar contemporaneous evidence of Wena's impression that the Egyptian government was involved in the seizures is reflected in several of the newspaper articles describing the events. For example, an article in the *Caterer and Hotelkeeper* reported that \"Mr. Farargy believed the attack... was organised either by government elements or people who are fiercely opposed to foreign ownership in Egypt.\" \"Wena Hotels Attacked by Crowds,\" *Caterer & Hotelkeeper* (April 18.1991) [Annex W85]. Similarly, an article in the *Crawley Observer* quoted \"Wena Managing Director Bernard Dihrberg\" as saying \" [t]his is a legal dispute with the Egyptian government. We owe money to them and they owe money to us.\" \"Mob Turn on Hotel Workers,\" *The Crawley Observer* (April 24, 1991) [Annex W86].\n\n43.\n\nHowever, in his testimony, Minster Sultan adamantly rejected the suggestion that Ministry officials might have been present during the seizure: \"I am sure that none of them have been there. I am sure of that, and, please, those who are accusing the Ministry should have come up with physical evidence showing representatives of the Ministry were there.\"93 Mr. Munir also testified that \"[t]here was no official of the Ministry of Tourism\" present during the seizure.94\n\nSultan Cross-Ex., TR Day 4, at 52:19-22.\n\nDirect Examination of Mr. Munir Abdul Al-Aziz Gaballah Shalabi, TR Day 5, at 12:29 (\"Munir Direct Ex.\").\n\n44.\n\nAccording to Ms. Jelcic and Mr. Webster, Wena staff went to both the nearby Kasr El-Nile police station and the Tourist police station seeking assistance.95 Although both Ms. Jelcic and Mr. Webster testified that \u2014 with the exception of one, lone policeman who arrived two to three hours later \u2014 both police forces refused to assist Wena,96 there is evidence that officers from Kasr El-Nile police did begin an investigation at around 11:00 p.m.97\n\nJelcic Direct Ex., TR Day 3, at 97:23-98:13; Webster Direct Ex., TR Day 3, at 16:17-17:12 & 19:8-15; Jelcic Declaration, \u00b6 14; Declaration of Mr. Simon Webster, \u00b6\u00b630-31, attached to Claimant's Memorial on the Merits (\"Webster Declaration\").\n\n*Id.*\n\nSee Kasr El-Nile Police Report (April 1, 1991) [Annex E-M25]; Munir Cross-Ex., TR Day 5, at 101:11-12.\n\n45.\n\nThe report by the Kasr El-Nile Police records that they were \"informed by the Director of the Security Department in the El-Nile Hotel,\" perhaps Mr. Wahba, \"that the Management of the Egyptian Hotels Corporation had previously sent a number of its employees to seize the hotel in full....\"98 According to the report, four officers from the Kasr El-Nile police station went to investigate. When they arrived, they met with officials from EHC, who \"presented to us a photocopy of the administrative order number 216 dated 31/3/1991 stamped and signed by Mr. Muhammad Kamal Qindeel, Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Egyptian Hotels Corporation.\"99 During their investigation that evening, the Kasr El-Nile Police reported that \"damage was noticed which resulted from the use of force to locks in the rooms of the secretaries, the resident manager and the administrative business and the room for [reception?] customers and the buffet and the room of the lawyer to the Wena Company who is resident in the hotel.\"100\n\nKasr El-Nile Police Report, at 1 (April 1, 1991) [Annex E-M25].\n\n*Id.*\n\nKasr El-Nile Police Reports, at 9 (April 1, 1991) [Annex E-M25] (brackets in original English translation).\n\n46.\n\nAs previously indicated, at approximately 1:00 a.m., Ms. Jelcic, Mr. Webster, and several other Wena employees went to the nearby Kasr El-Nile police station to file a complaint.101 According to Ms. Jelcic and Mr. Webster, the police at first refused to let them make a statement, and then only would allow them to submit statements dealing with the loss of personal items, not the illegality of EHC's seizure.102 Several other employees also prepared statements, reporting the loss of money, jewelry, watches, and other personal items.103\n\n*See* Jelcic Direct Ex., TR Day 3, at 100:22-101:4; Webster Direct Ex., TR Day 3, at 20:2-8.\n\n*See* Jelcic Direct Ex., TR Day 3, at 100:26-101:15; Webster Direct Ex., TR Day 3, at 21:20-22:1; Statement of Ms. Angela Jelcic to Kasr El-Nile Police (April 2, 1991) [Annex W82]; Statement of Mr. Simon Webster to Kasr El-Nile Police (April 2, 1991) [Annex W83],\n\n*See* Kasr El-Nile Police Reports (April 2.1991) [Annex E-M25], The Tribunal also heard testimony from Mr. Tahir Al-Misiri Qasim (TR Day 4 at 223:8 *et seq.)* and Mr. Sameer Muhammad Khatir (TR Day 4 at 231:23 ef *seq.)* to the effect that there was no violence at the time of the takeover. This testimony is inconsistent with the testimony of Webster and Jelcic and the other witnesses who testified consistently with Webster and Jelcic. Since the testimony of Mr. Qasim and Mr. Khatir has also been found inconsistent with the decision of the Southern Cairo Court of Appeal, which characterized the situation at the Nile Hotel on April 1, 1991 as including many acts of violence, the Tribunal has chosen not to rely on the testimony of these two witnesses.\n\n3. *Seizure of the Luxor Hotel*\n-------------------------------\n\n47.\n\nAlso on 1 April 1991, at approximately 7:00 p.m., several EHC employees, led by Mr. Yusseri, took possession of the Luxor Hotel.104\n\nYusseri Statement, \u00b6\u00b6 9-11.\n\n48.\n\nAccording to a subsequent statement to the Luxor police by Mr. Bahia El Din Abdel Hadi El Wakeel, a security guard at the Luxor Hotel, \"more than 100 people from the EHC seized the Wena Hotel by force in spite myself and others responsible for the security and guards in the hotel presence at the time.\"105 Mr. Wakeel also stated that \"EHC forced their entry through by force... which caused panic, fear, and hysteria for the guests and employees.\"106 Two other guards, Messrs. Ismael Ahmed Hefni and Ahmed Hamza Mostafa, made short statements, agreeing with Mr. Wakeel's description of events.107\n\nPolice Statement Number 984, at 1 (April 2, 1991) [Annex W132].\n\n*Id.*\n\nId., at 3.\n\n49.\n\nMr. Muhammad Nagib Al-Sayyid, Wena's General manager of the Luxor Hotel, also filed a police statement, asserting that, at approximately 7:00 p.m., EHC personnel entered his office, seized the hotel's papers and ordered him to leave the hotel.108 Mr. Nagib reported the incident to the Luxor Tourist Police, who accompanied Mr. Nagib back to the hotel and subsequently opened an investigation into the seizure.109\n\nPolice Statement Number 959, at 1 (April 1, 1991) [Annex E-J 18].\n\n*Id.*\n\n50.\n\nThese contemporaneous descriptions comport with the subsequent report by the Advocate General at the Office of the Assistant Attorney General for Upper Egypt, which concluded that EHC \"broke into the Hotel... entered by force into the management office, broke open the doors and Offices of the Hotels Ltd.

The Luxor Hotel remained in EHC's control until April 21, 1992. During this time, Wena made several efforts to recover possession of the hotels \u2014 including seeking the assistance of officials in the United States and United Kingdom.119 For example, on July 9, 1991, Mr. Farargy wrote to the Egyptian Ambassador to the United Kingdom, complaining about the apparent collapse of negotiations between Wena and a representative of the Egyptian government.120 Apparently, also during this time, the Civil Defense Authority (which is responsible for fire safety) issued at least two reports \u2014 on May 22, 1991 and November 12, 1991 \u2014 about unsafe conditions at the Nile Hotel.121\n\n*See, e.g.,* Malins Declarations, \u00b66.\n\n*See* Letter from Mr. Nael El-Farargy (Wena Hotels Ltd.) to His Excellency, Ambassador Shaker (Egyptian Ambassador to the United Kingdom) (July 9, 1991) [Annex W50].\n\n*See* Letter from the Director General of the Civil Defense Authority (January 4, 1992) [Annex E-M43].\n\n54.\n\nOn January 16, 1992, the Chief Prosecutor of Egypt ruled that the seizure of the Nile Hotel was illegal and that Wena was entitled to repossess the hotel.122 However, the Nile Hotel was not immediately returned to Wena. On February 21, 1992, Mr. Webster wrote to the British Embassy in Cairo, complaining of Minister Sultan\u2019s \"uncooperative stance\" and the delays that Wena was experiencing in recovering the hotels: \"if he [Minister Sultan] wishes to press settlement of account, then we too will press for settlement of monies outstanding to Wena.\"123 Mr. Webster concluded his letter by saying that\" [w]e are of the impression that the Minister is either poorly informed or part of the entire scheme.\"124\n\n*See* Munir Direct Ex., TR Day 5, at 31:6-7; Munir Statement, \u00b622.\n\nLetter from Mr. Webster (Wena Hotels Ltd.) to Mr. Ceurvost (British Embassy, Egypt) (February 21, 1991) [Annex W130].\n\n*Id.

Kandil and Munir \u2014 under Article 369/1 of the Egyptian Criminal Code (dispossession by violence), holding that unlawful force was used to expel Wena from the Nile Hotel.138 These convictions were subsequently upheld by the Southern Cairo Court of Appeal, on January 16.1994.139 According to Mr. Munir, the decision is currently under appeal to the Court of Cassation.140 Neither Mr. Kandil nor Mr. Munir was sentenced to serve any jail time; both were fined only 200 Egyptian pounds, which Mr. Munir stated that he had not paid.141 Since then, Mr. Munir has been promoted to become the Head of the Legal Affairs division at EHC and is expecting a further promotion.142 According to Ms. Jelcic, Mr. Kandil is currently an advisor to a senior member of the Egyptian parliament.143\n\n*See* decision of the Southern Cairo Court of Appeal (January 16, 1994) [Annex W135].\n\n*Id.*\n\n*See* Munir Direct Ex., TR Day 5, at 32:11-17; Munir Cross-Ex., TR Day 5, at 91:11-92:12.\n\nDecision of the Southern Cairo Court of Appeal (January 16, 1994) [Annex W135]; Munir Cross-Ex., TR Day 5, at 94:23.\n\nMunir Cross-Ex., TR Day 5, at 93:20-94:26.\n\nRedirect Examination of Ms. Angela Jelcic, TR Day 3, at 155:22-156:22 (\"Jelcic Redirect Ex.\").\n\n60.\n\nOn December 2.1993, Wena initiated arbitration in Egypt against EHC for breaching the Nile Hotel lease.144 Similar arbitration was initiated by Wena against EHC for breaching the Luxor Hotel lease on January 12, 1994.145\n\nNile Hotel Arbitration Award, at 1 (April 10, 1994) [Annex E-M19].\n\nLuxor Hotel Arbitration Award, at 1 (September 29, 1994) [Annex E-J31],\n\n61.\n\nOn April 10.1994, an arbitration award of EGP 1.5 million for damages from the invasion of the Nile Hotel was issued in favor of Wena.

Harassment**\n-----------------\n\n63.\n\nWena has also alleged \"a campaign of continual harassment\" by Egypt since the seizure of the two hotels, including the following allegations: \"in 1991 the Minister of Tourism made defamatory statement about Wena that were reproduced in the media; in 1992 Egypt revoked the Nile Hotel's operating license without reason; in 1995 Egypt imposed an enormous, but fictitious, tax demand on Wena; in 1996 Egypt removed the Luxor Hotel's police book, effectively rendering it unable.to accept guests; and, last but not least, in 1997 Egypt imposed a three-year prison sentence and a LE 200,000 bail bond on the Managing Director of Wena based on trumped-up charges.\"152\n\nClaimant's Request for Arbitration, at 16.\n\n64.\n\nThe Tribunal has received some limited testimony and other evidence on these various allegations. However, because it finds, as discussed in section III, *infra,* that Egypt's actions concerning the April 1.1991 seizures of the two hotels are sufficient to determine liability, the Tribunal does not find it necessary to make a finding on the veracity of these additional allegations.\n\n**G. Relationship between EHC and Egypt**\n-----------------------------------------\n\n65.\n\nFrom 1983 through September 1991, EHC was a \"public sector\" company, wholly owned by the Egyptian Government, and'operating in accordance with law Number 97 of 1983 governing Public Sector Companies and Organizations.153 In September 1991, Egypt enacted the Public Business Sector Companies Law, which reorganized the \"314 State owned economic companies,\" pooling them into \"16 (reduced later to 12) State owned holding companies supervised by the Minster for [the] public Sector.\"154 However, at the time of the seizures of the Nile and Luxor Hotels, EHC was governed by Law Number 97 of 1983.\n\n*See* Munir Statement, \u00b63; Egyptian Law Number 97 of 1983 governing Public Sector Authorities and Affiliated Companies (\"Law Number 97 of 1983\") [Annex W65],\n\nSultan Statement, \u00b64.\n\n66.\n\nAs explained by Minster Sultan during his testimony, under Law Number 97 of 1983, the sole shareholder of EHC was Egypt.155 EHC's shareholder assembly was chaired by the Minister of Tourism and would be attended by several other government officials.156 The Minister of Tourism also was responsible for the appointment of at least one half of the Board of Directors of EHC, and furthermore nominated EHC's Chairman.157 Indeed, in May 1989, Mr. Kamal Kandil was appointed, at the nomination of Minister Sultan, Chairman and CEO of EHC by Egyptian Prime Minister's Decree Number 539 of 1989.158 According to Mr. Munir's statement \"EHC's Directors were also appointed by the Ministry of Tourism and Civil Aviation.\"159\n\nSultan Cross-Ex., TR Day 3, at 227:26-28.\n\n*Id.,* at 228:2-8\n\n*See* Sultan Statement., \u00b68; Sultan Cross-Ex., TR Day 3, at 211:26-212:2; Law Number 97 of 1983, art. 30 [Annex W65],\n\n**See** Prime Minister's Decree No. 539 of 1989 [Annex E-M27]; Sultan Statement, \u00b68; Sultan Cross-Ex., TR Day 3, at 211:17-23.

Consultancy Agreement between Wena Hotels Ltd. and Mr. Kamal Kandil**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n70.\n\nEgypt has contended that the \"claimant improperly sought to influence the Chairman of EHC with respect to the award of the leases.\"168 Both parties agree that, on or about August 20, 1989, Wena Hotels Ltd. entered into a consultancy agreement with Mr. Kamal Kandil.169 The second paragraph of the agreement provides that Mr. Kandil's duties \"shall be to give advice and assistance to the company as to the opportunities available to the company for developing its hotel business in Egypt.\"170\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Memorial at 15.\n\n*See* Consultancy Agreement between Mr. Kamal Kandil and Wena Hotels Limited [Annex W149].\n\n*Id.*\n\n71.\n\nOn March 26, 1991, Wena (through its attorneys, Tuck & Mann) issued a Writ of Summons in England against Mr. Kandil, alleging that, under the agreement, Wena had made five payments to Mr. Kandil between August 18, 1989 and January 30, 1990.171 The total of these payments, which Wena sought to reclaim, was GB\u00a3 52,000.\n\nWrit of Summons issued by Wena Hotels Limited against Mr. Mohamed Kamal Ali Mohamed Kandil (March 26, 1991) [Annex E-M7],\n\n72.\n\nOn August 19, 1991, Mr. Kandil responded to this Writ in a letter written to the Senior Master of the Royal Court of Justice.172 In his letter, Mr. Kandil objected to Wena's writ, claiming that \"there was no Contract between the Claimant Company and myself,\" that there was only \"a Draft Contract which is not a Contract because it was neither signed nor sealed between the Parties,\" and that \"the signature which appears is not mine.\"173 Mr. Kandil asserted that the \"subject of the above-mentioned Draft Contract was to develop new hotels in Egypt, these hotels being the Ramses Village project in Abou Simbal and a Conference Center in Aswan City....\"174 Mr. Kandil also stated that\" [i]n the Draft Contract I did not act in my quality of Chairman of the Egyptian Hotels Company nor did the Draft Contract concern either the Nile Hotel or the Luxor Hotel, instead I acted as Tourist Consultant for the Aswan Government and Chairman of the Board of Directors of Misr Aswan Tourist Co.\"175\n\nLetter from Mr. Kamal Kandil to the Senior Master of the Royal Court of Justice (August 19, 1991) [Annex W150].\n\n*Id.,* at 1.\n\n*Id.*\n\n*Id.*\n\n73.\n\nAs corroborating evidence of Mr. Kandil's statements, Wena has submitted two letters it sent to the Governor of Aswan in December 1989 and January 1990 (including one letter on which Mr. Kandil was copied), concerning the Abou Simbal and Aswan City developments.176\n\n*See* Facsimile from Mr. Dimopolous (Wena Hotels Ltd.) to Mr. Kamal Kandil (Chairman, EHC) (December 13, 1989), enclosing letter from Mr. Nael El-Farargy (Wena Hotels Ltd.) to His Excellency, the Governor of As wan (December 11.1989) [Annex W188]; letter from Mr. Nael El-Farargy (Wena Hotels Ltd.) to His Excellency, the Governor of Aswan (January 15, 1990) [Annex W189).\n\n74.\n\nMr.. Farargy testified that the Egyptian government was aware of the consultancy agreement and that Mr. Kandil \"offered his help and assistance officially above board with their knowledge.\"177 According to Minister Sultan, however, he was not personally aware that \"Mr. Kandil was an agent to Farargy\" and that when he did learn about it, \"I passed that to the prosecutor requesting a full fledged investigation....\"178 Both parties agree, however, that \"the investigation appears... to have bene closed\"179 and that \"Mr. Kandil was never prosecuted in Egypt in connection with the Consultancy Agreement.\"180 Unfortunately, other than this consensus that Mr. Kandil was never prosecuted, the Tribunal has been presented with no evidence of any investigation the Egyptian government might have undertaken in this matter.\n\nFarargy Direct Ex., TR Day 1, at 142:27-28. *See also* Farargy Direct Ex., TR Day 1, at 142:26-143:6.\n\nSultan Direct Ex., TR Day 3, at 188:11-14.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Memorial, at 14.\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Reply, at 16 (submitted on June 15, 2000).\n\n**III. Liability**\n------------------\n\n75.\n\nIn its Memorial on the Merits, Wena claims that \"Egypt violated the IPPA, Egyptian law and international law by expropriating Wena's investments without compensation.\"181 Wena also argues that \"Egypt violated the IPPA and other international norms by failing to protect and secure Wena's investments.\"182\n\nClaimant's Memorial on the Merits, at 43-51.\n\n*Id.,* at 51-54.\n\n76.\n\nEgypt denies Wena's claims, asserting that it has neither \"violated the IPPA's prohibition on expropriation without compensation\"183 nor \"breached any obligation under international law to protect and secure the claimant's investment.\"184 In addition to its objections to the substance of Wena's claims, Egypt has also raised two affirmative defenses. First, Egypt asserts that \"Claimant's claims in respect of the seizure of the hotels and acts of vandalism are time barred.\"185 Second, Egypt contends that \"Claimant improperly sought to influence the Chairman of EHC [Mr. Kamal Kandil] with respect to the award of the leases that are the subject of this arbitration\" and, therefore, as a result of this alleged corruption, \"Claimant cannot now properly appear before an international tribunal, constituted in accordance with the IPPA, and claim compensation for the alleged loss of leasehold interests that were improperly obtained in the first place.\"186 The Tribunal has carefully considered all of these claims. The Tribunal devoted particular attention to the allegations of corruption raised by Egypt.\n\nRespondent's Memorial on the Merits, at 8-40.\n\n*Id.,* at 40-42.\n\n*Id.,* at 42-44.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Memorial, at 15.\n\n77.\n\nDespite the able representation of Egypt's counsel, the Tribunal concludes that Egypt did violate its obligations under the IPPA by failing to provide Wena's investments in Egypt \"fair and equitable treatment\" and \"full protection and security\"187 and by. failing to provide Wena with \"prompt, adequate and effective compensation\" following the expropriation of its investments.188 The Tribunal also finds that Wena's claims are not time barred. Finally, although Egypt has raised serious allegations of misconduct and corruption, the Tribunal finds that Egypt (which bears the burden of proving such an affirmative defense) has failed to prove its allegations. The Tribunal's rationale is discussed in more detail below.\n\nIPPA, art. 2(2) [Annexes W2 & E-J22],\n\nIPPA, art 5(1) [Annexes W2 & E-J22],\n\n**A. Law Applicable to this Arbitration**\n-----------------------------------------\n\n78.\n\nBefore Disposing of the merits of this, case, the Tribunal must consider the applicable law governing its deliberations. As both parties agree, \"this case all turns on an alleged violation by the Arab Republic of Egypt of the agreement for the promotion and protection of investments that was entered into in 1976 between the United Kingdom and the Arab Republic of Egypt.\"189 Thus, the Tribunal, like the parties (in both their submissions and oral advocacy), considers the IPPA to be the primary source of applicable law for this arbitration.\n\nRespondent's Opening Statement, TR Day 1, at 29:24-28. *See also* Claimant's Opening Statement, TR Day 1, at 15:24-25 (\"the basis of this action is the breach of [the] Bilateral Treaty by Egypt\").\n\n79.\n\nHowever, the IPPA is a fairly terse agreement of only seven pages containing thirteen articles. The parties in their arguments have not treated it as containing all the rules of law applicable to their dispute, and this is also the view of the Tribunal. In particular, Egypt has relied on Egyptian law, namely, the Egyptian Civil Code to raise its first defense \u2014 that Wena's claims are time barred. In its response to that defense, Wena has taken the position that both Egyptian law and international law are applicable to the dispute.190 Under Article 42(1) of the ICSID Convention:\n\nThe Tribunal shall decide a dispute in accordance with such rules of law as may be agreed upon by the parties. In the absence of such agreement, the Tribunal shall apply the law of the Contracting State party to the dispute (including its rules on the conflicts of laws) and such rules of international law as may be applicable.\n\nThe Tribunal finds that, beyond the provisions of the IPPA, there is no special agreement between the parties on the rules of law applicable to the dispute. Rather, the pleadings of both parties indicate that, aside from the provisions of the IPPA, the Tribunal should apply both Egyptian law *(i.e.,* \"the law of the Contracting State party to the dispute\") and \"such rules of international law as may be applicable.\" The Tribuna notes that the provisions of the IPPA would in any event be the first rules of law to be applied by the Tribunal, both on the basis of the agreement of the parties and as mandated by Egyptian law as well as international law.\n\n*See, e.g.,* Claimant's Reply on the Merits, at 48-50. *See also* Claimant's Memorial on the Merits, at 42; Respondent's Memorial on the Merits, at 7-8 (referring, in regard to Respondent's second defense, to \"practices condemned by both Egyptian and international law.\").\n\n**B. The Issue of Egypt's Substantive Liability**\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n1. *Summary of Wena's Claims*\n-----------------------------\n\n80.\n\nAs noted already, Wena raises two claims against Egypt. First, it contends that Egypt's actions constitute an unlawful expropriation without \"prompt, adequate and effective\" compensation in violation of Article 5 of the IPPA, as well as Egyptian law and other international law.191 Second, Wena argues that Egypt violated Article 2(2) of the IPPA, and other international norms, by failing to accord Wena's investments \"fair and equitable treatment\" and \"full protection and security.\"192\n\n*See, e.g.,* Claimant's Memorial on the Merits, at 43-51; Claimant's Reply on the Merits, at 29-38 (submitted oh September 27, 1999); Claimant's Post-Hearing Brief, at 41-44.\n\nClaimant's Memorial on the Merits, at 51 -54; Claimant's Reply on the Merits, at 39-44; Claimant's Post-Hearing Brief, at 44-46.\n\n81.\n\nEgypt disputes both allegations, contending, *inter alia,* \" that the Claimant has no legitimate grievance against the Respondent, who neither authorized nor participated in the repossession of the Luxor and Nile Hotels on April 1, 1991 or most of the subsequent events of which the Claimant complains.\"193\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Rebuttal Memorial, at 8 (submitted on June 15, 2000).\n\n82.\n\nThe Tribunal disagrees. There is substantial evidence that, even if Egyptian officials other than officials of EHC did not participate in the seizures of the hotels on April 1.1991,1) Egypt was aware of EHC's intentions to seize the hotels and did nothing to prevent those seizures, 2) the police, although responding to the seizures, did nothing to protect Wena's investments; 3) for almost one year, Egypt (despite its control over EHC both before and after April 1, 1991) did nothing to restore the hotels to Wena; 4) Egypt failed to prevent damage to the hotels before their return to Wena; 5) Egypt failed to impose any substantial sanctions on EHC (or its senior officials responsible for the seizures), suggesting its approval of EHC's actions; and 6) Egypt refused to compensate Wena for the losses it suffered.\n\n83.\n\nThe Tribunal shall consider each of Wena's claims, beginning with its assertion that Egypt violated its obligations under Article 2(2) of the IPPA to provide \"full protection and security\" to Wena's investments.\n\n2. *Article 2(2) of the IPPA: \"Fair and Equitable Treatment\" and \"Full Protection and Security\"*\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n84.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees with Wena that Egypt violated its obligation under Article 2(2) of the IPPA to accord Wena's investment \"fair and equitable treatment\" and \"full protection and security.\" Although it is not clear that Egyptian officials other than officials of EHC directly participated in the April 1, 1991 seizures, there is substantial evidence that Egypt was aware of EHC's intentions to seize the hotels and took no actions to prevent EHC from doing so. Moreover, once the seizures occurred, both the police and the Ministry of Tourism took no immediate action to restore the hotels promptly to Wena's control. Finally, Egypt never imposed substantial sanctions on EHC or its senior officials, suggesting Egypt's approval of EHC's actions.\n\nArticle 2(2) of the IPPA provides:\n\nInvestments of nationals or companies of either Contracting Party shall at all time be accorded fair and equitable treatment and shall enjoy full protection and security in the territory of the other Contracting Party. Each Contracting Party shall ensure that the management, maintenance, use, enjoyment or disposal of investments in its territory of nationals or companies of the other Contracting Party is not in any way impaired by unreasonable or discriminatory measures. Each Contracting Party shall observe any obligation it may have entered into with regard to investments of nationals or companies of the other Contracting party.194\n\nIn interpreting a similar provision from the bilateral investment treaty between Zaire and the United States, another ICSID panel has recently held that \"the obligation incumbent on [the host state] is an obligation of vigilance, in the sense that [the host state] shall take all measures necessary to ensure the full enjoyment of protection and security of its [sic] investments and should not be permitted to invoke its own legislation to detract from any such obligation.\"195 Of course, as still another ICSID panel has observed, a host state's promise to accord foreign investment such protection is not an \"absolute obligation which guarantees that no damages will be suffered, in the sense that any violation thereof creates automatically a 'strict liability' on behalf of the host State.\"196 A host state \"is not an insurer or guarantor.... [i]t does not, and could hardly be asked to, accept an absolute responsibility for all injuries to foreigners.\"197 Here, however, there is no question that Egypt violated its obligation to accord Wena's investments \"fair and equitable treatment\" and \"full protection and security.\"\n\nIPPA, art. 2(2) [Annex W2 & E-J22],\n\n*American Manufacturing and Trading, Inc.* v. *Republic of Zaire,* ICSID Case No. ARB/93/1, at 28 (1997) [Annex W115]. Article 11(4) of the Zaire-United States bilateral investment treaty, much like Article 2(2) of the IPPA, provides that \"[i]nvestment of nationals and companies of either Party shall at all times be accorded fair and equitable treatment and shall enjoy protection and security in the territory of the other party.\" *Id.,* at 28 [Annex W115].\n\n*AAPL* v. *Sri Lanka,* ICSID Case No. ARB/87/3, at 545 (1990) [Annex W117; a digested version of the decision has also been provided at Annex E-M35] The wording of Article 2(2) of the bilateral investment treaty in that case (between Sri Lanka and the United Kingdom) is almost identical to that in the same article in the IPPA: \"Investment of nationals and companies of either Party shall at all times be accorded fair and equitable treatment and shall enjoy protection and security in the territory of the other Party.\" Agreement for the Promotion and Protection of Investments, February 13, 1980, U.K.-Sri Lanka [Annex W41].\n\n*AAPL* v. *Sri Lanka,* at 546 (quoting Al wyn V. Freeman, *Responsibility of States for Unlawful Acts of Their Armed Forces,* 14(1957)) [Annex W117; also Annex E-M35],\n\n85.\n\nEven if Egypt did not instigate or participate in the seizure of the two hotels, as Wena claims,198 there is sufficient evidence to find tat Egypt was aware of EHC's intentions and took no actions to prevent the seizures or to immediately restore Wena's control over the hotels. As discussed in section II.C, *supra,* in December 1990, Wena's parliamentary consultant, Mr. Malins, traveled to Egypt expressly to meet with minister Sultan and the Egyptian Minister of the Interior to express Wena's concerns about such a seizure.199 Mr. Malins recounted that\" [b]oth Minsters gave me their separate, absolute assurances... that no violence could or would take place.\"200 In February 1991, Wena wrote to Minister Sultan, mentioning that EHC was again threatening to repossess the hotels through force:\n\n*officials from the Egyptian Hotels Company threatened to storm the hotels and expel us,* and this was after our Company had spent the sums previously outlined. The Matter reached a point where the Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Egyptian Hotels Company issued a decision for his company to take possession of the Luxor Hotel without a legal ruling or any other measure [to support his decision].201\n\nThe evidence submitted by the parties does suggest a unity of interest between EHC and Egypt such that it is possible that Egypt might have authorized and participated in the seizures of the hotels. The repeated reference in contemporaneous documents to EHC as a \"government company,\" to its money as \"public money\" and to its rights as \"the Government's rights\" or \"state ownership\" is particularly compelling in this regard. **See, e.g.,** Luxor Police State Report No. 959 of 1991, at 8, 12 & 26 (April 1, 1991) [Annex E-M 18]; Kasr El-Nile Police Report, at 6 (April 1, 1991) [Annex E-M25]; Letter from Mr. Kamal Kandil (Chairman, EHC) to Mr. Nael El-Farargy (Wena Hotels Ltd.) (March 30, 1991) [Annex W80]; Letter from Mr. Kamal Kandil (Chairman, EHC) to Mr. Humfrey Malins, M.P.

For example, although both Ms. Jelcic and Mr. Webster believe that Ministry of Tourism officials were present at the Nile Hotel, they both admit that they were, personally, unable to identify any such officials. **See, e.g.,** Jelcic Direct Ex., TR Day 3, at 97:10-13; Webster Direct Ex., TR Day 3, at 14:6-12.\n\nMalins Direct Ex., TR Day 4, at 175:1-4.\n\n*Id.,* at 175:26-29. *See also* Malins Declaration, \u00b64.\n\nLetter from Mr. Nael El-Farargy (Wena Hotels Ltd.) to Minister Fouad Sultan (Minister of Tourism) (February 11, 1991) (emphasis added; brackets in original English translation) [Sultan Statement, Attachment A; also Annexes E-M21 & W127].\n\n86.\n\nThen, on March 21, 1991 (only eleven days before the seizures), Mr. Kandil wrote to Minister Sultan, proposing that, among other things, \"the two hotels be taken and the license withdrawn.\"202 Mr. Kandil closed the letter by advising Minister Sultan: \"We leave the matter to you.\"203 Marginalia, in Minister Sultan's handwriting, confirm that the Minister received and reviewed the letter.204\n\nLetter from Mr. Kamal Kandil (Chairman, EHC) to Minister Fouad Sultan (Minister of Tourism) (March 21, 1991) [Sultan Statement, Attachment D; also Annex W126].\n\n*Id.*\n\n*Id.* (Arabic original). *See also* Sultan Cross-Ex., TR Day 3, at 235:23-237:27; Sultan Statement,\u00b617.\n\n87.\n\nFinally, on March 25, 1991 (only six days before the seizure), Mr. Malins wrote to Minister Sultan asking for another meeting and requesting an understanding from the Minister that no actions would be taken until that meeting could occur: \"please confirm what must surely be [sic] right, mainly that all matters be 'absolutely frozen,' with no detrimental action of whatever nature being taken pending our meeting....\"205 As evidence of the close coordination between the Ministry of Tourism and EHC, Mr. Kandil (and not Minister Sultan) responded to this letter on March 31, 1991 (the day immediately before the seizures).206 Mr. Kandil ended his letter by threatening that \"the owning company will take all necessary measures to protect its rights which is considered a state ownership.\"207\n\nLetter from Mr. Humfrey Malins, M.P. (Parliamentary Consultant, Wena) to Minister Fouad Sultan (Minister of Tourism) (March 25, 1991) [Annex W128].\n\nLetter from Mr. Kamal Kandil (Chairman, EHC) to Mr. Humfrey Malins, M.P. (Parliamentary Consultant, Wena) (March 31, 1991) [Annex W128],\n\n*Id.*\n\n88.\n\nDespite all these warnings, Egypt took no action to protect Wena's investment. Minister Sultan sought to defend Egypt's failure to prevent the seizure by explaining he was not aware that EHC planned to illegally seize the hotels,208 and that\" [i]f I had the slightest idea about that incident, I would have immediately stopped it...,\"209 Even if the Tribunal were to accept this explanation for Egypt's failure to act *before* the seizures, it does not justify the fact that neither the police nor the Ministry of Tourism took any immediate action to protect Wena's investments *after* EHC had illegally seized the hotels.\n\nSultan Cross-Ex., TR Day 3, at 233:2-5.\n\nSultan Cross-Ex., TR Day 3, at 175:9-10.\n\n89.\n\nFor example, despite the convincing evidence that a large number of people forcibly seized the Nile Hotel at approximately 7:00 p.m.,210 it is undisputed that the Kasr El-Nile police (located only a few minutes away) did not begin an investigation until four hours later and it is not evident that the Ministry of Tourism police (also located nearby) ever responded to Wena's request for assistance.211 Moreover, even after the Kasr El-Nile police began their investigation, they took no steps to remove EHC and restore Wena to control of the hotel. The Luxor police, although more prompt in their response, also declined to expel EHC and restore the Luxor hotel to Wena.212\n\nSee, e.g., Kasr El-Nile Police Reports (April 1-2.1991) [Annex E-M25]; Police Statement ofMr. Tamim Foda (July 6, 1991)[Annex W134]; Police Statement of Mr. Mostafa Ahmed Osman (July 6, 1991) [Annex W134]; Police Statement of Mr. Sherif Ibrahim Mohamed Khalifa (July 6, 1991) [Annex W134]; Police Statement of Mr. Mohamed Sabry Ismail Emam (July 6, 1991) [Annex W134]; \"British Tourists are Beaten and Thrown Out of Egypt Hotels,\" *Daily Telegraph* (April 4, 1991) [Annex W7],\n\n*See* Jelcic Direct Ex., TR Day 3, at 97:23-98:13; Webster Direct Ex., TR Day 3, at 16:17-17:12 & 19:8-15; Jelcic Declaration, \u00b614; Webster Declaration, \u00b6\u00b630-31; Kasr El-Nile Police Report (April 1, 1991) [Annex E-M25]; Munir Cross-Ex., TR Day 5, at 101:11-12.\n\n*See* Police Statement Number 984 (April 2, 1991) [Annex W132]; Police Statement Number 959 (April 1, 1991) [Annex E-J18],\n\n90.\n\nThe Ministry of Tourism also failed to take any immediate action to protect Wena's investments. Although he testified that he \"was furious\"213 at EHC's decision to seize the hotels and that EHC's actions were \"wrong,\"214 Minister Sultan also acknowledged that he did not take any action to return the hotels to Wena, to punish EHC or its officials, or to withdraw the hotel's licenses so that EHC could not operate the hotels.215 Under Law Number 97 of 1983 governing Public Sector Companies and Organizations, Minister Sultan was empowered to dismiss the Chairman and the members of the Board of EHC if \"it appears that the continued presence of these persons would affect the proper functioning of the company.\"216 Also, given its power as the sole shareholder in EHC,217 with several of its senior officials participating in and one of them chairing EHC's shareholder assembly,218 and with \"EHC operating] within broad policy guidelines laid down by the Egyptian Government,\"219 Egypt could have directed EHC to return the hotels to Wena's control and make reparations.\n\n*See, e.g.,* Sultan Direct Ex.

(February 20, 1992) [Annex W66].\n\n91.\n\nInstead, neither hotel was restored to Wena until nearly a year later, after decisions by the Chief Prosecutor of Egypt,220 which Wena asserts were only obtained as a result of diplomatic pressure on Egypt.221 Even after the Chief Prosecutor's first decision (concerning the Nile Hotel) was issued on January 16.1992, in which he found the seizures \"illegal,\" the Ministry of Tourism delayed returning control of the Nile Hotel to Wena. For example, on February 21, 1992, Mr. Webster wrote to the British Embassy in Cairo, complaining of Minister Sultan's \"uncooperative stance\" and the delays that Wena was experiencing in recovering the hotels: \"if he [Minister Sultan] wishes to press settlement of account, then we too will press for settlement of monies outstanding to Wena.\"222 Mr. Webster concluded his letter by saying that\" [w]e are of the impression that the Minister is either poorly informed or part of the entire scheme.\"223\n\n*See* Munir Direct Ex., TR Day 5, at 31:6-7; Munir Statement, \u00b622; Yusseri Statement, \u00b613.\n\n*See, e.g.,* Farargy Declaration, \u00b626.\n\nLetter from Mr. Webster (Wena Hotels Ltd.) to Mr. Ceurvost (British Embassy, Egypt) (February 21, 1991) [Annex W130].\n\n*Id. See also* Webster Direct Ex., TR Day 3, at 26:6-16.\n\n92.\n\nMoreover, neither hotel was returned to Wena in the same operating condition that it had been in before the seizures. According to Wena's witnesses, both hotels had been vandalized.224 Although Mr. Munir denied that any such vandalism occurred, he confirmed that EHC had removed and auctioned much of the Nile Hotel's fixtures and furniture.225 Furthermore, neither hotel had a permanent operating license. In fact, just two days before the Nile Hotel was returned to Wena, the Ministry of Tourism withdrew that hotel's operating license because of alleged fire safety violations.226 Although, as Mr. Munir noted, these safety violations had pre-dated EHC's seizure of the hotel in April 1991,227 it is noteworthy that the Ministry of Tourism allowed EHC to operate the Nile Hotel from April 1991 through February 1992, despite these violations, and revoked the license only on February 23, 1992, just prior to restoring the hotel to Wena's control.\n\n*See, e.g.,* Malins Direct Ex., TR Day 4, at 179:1-20; Webster Direct Ex., TR Day 3, at 26:20-24; Jelcic Direct Ex., TR Day 3, at 109:3-8 & 110:13-22.\n\n*See* Munir Cross-Ex., TR Day 5, at 89:3-11; Munir Statement, \u00b624.\n\n*See* Munir Direct Ex., TR Day 5, at 30:10-28; Munir Statement, \u00b6 22-23; Police Report on Hand-over of the Nile Hotel (February 25, 1992) [Annex W137],\n\nMunir Direct Ex., TR Day 5, at 30:10-28.\n\n93.\n\nEgypt also refused to compensate Wena for the losses it had experienced.228 On November 11, 1992, Mr. Malins wrote to the Honorable Lee Hamilton, a senior member of the U.S. House of Representatives, complaining that \"the Minister of Tourism, Dr. Fouad Sultan, will not consider our requests\" and that \"it is clear that subsequent to any perceived movement, Dr. Sultan personally intervenes to obstruct a solution.\"229\n\n*See, e.g.,* Malins Direct Ex., TR Day 4, at 180:23-181:23.\n\nLetter from Mr. Humfrey Malins, M.P. (Parliamentary Consultant, Wena) to the Honorable Lee H. Hamilton (Chairman, Subcommittee on Europe & the Middle East, U.S. House of Representatives) (November 11, 1992) [Annex W131].\n\n94.\n\nFinally, neither EHC nor its senior officials were seriously punished for their actions in forcibly expelling Wena and illegally possessing the hotels for approximately a year. Although several representatives of EHC \u2014 including Messrs. Kandil and Munir \u2014 were convicted for their actions, neither Mr. Kandil nor Mr. Munir was sentenced to serve any jail time. Instead, both were fined only EGP 200, which Mr. Munir stated that he has never paid.230 Also, neither official appears to have suffered any repercussions in their careers. As noted above, the Ministry of Tourism chose not to exercise its authority to remove Mr. Kandil as Chairman of ECH and, according to Ms. Jelcic, he currently is serving as an advisor to a senior member of the Egyptian parliament.231 Since the seizures, Mr. Munir has been promoted to become the Head of the Legal Affairs Division at EHC and is expecting a further promotion in the near future.232 This absence of any punishment of EHC and its officials suggest that Egypt condoned EHC's actions.\n\n*See* Decision of the Southern Cairo Court of Appeal (January 16, 1994) [Annex W134]; Munir Cross-Ex., TR Day 5, at 94:23.\n\nJelcic Redirect Ex., TR Day 3, at 155:22-156:22.\n\nMunir Cross-Ex., TR Day 5, at 93:20-94:26.\n\n95.\n\nFor all of these reasons, the Tribunal concludes that Egypt violated its obligation under Article 2(2) of the IPPA, by failing to accord Wena's investments \"fair and equitable treatment\" and \"full protection and security.\"\n\n*3. Article 5 of the IPPA: Expropriation Without \"Prompt, Adequate and Effective\" Compensation*\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n96.\n\nThe Tribunal also agrees with Wena that Egypt's actions constitute an expropriation and one without \"prompt, adequate and effective compensation,\" in violation of Article 5 of the IPPA. That article provides in relevant part that:\n\n(1) Investments of nationals or companies of either Contracting Party shall not be nationalised, expropriated or subjected to measures having effect equivalent to nationalisation or expropriation (hereinafter referred to as 'expropriation') in the territory of the other Contracting Party except for a public purpose related to the internal needs of the Party and against prompt, adequate and effective compensation. Such compensation shall amount to the market value of the investment expropriated immediately before the expropriation itself or before there was an official Government announcement that expropriation would be effected in the future, whichever is the earlier, shall be made without delay, be effectively realizable and be freely transferable. The national or company affected shall have a right under the law of the Contracting Party making the expropriation, to prompt review, by a judicial or other independent authority of that Party, of whether the expropriation is in conformity with domestic law and of the valuation of his or its investment in accordance with the principles set out in this paragraph.233\n\nIPPA, art 5(1) [Annex W2&E-J22],\n\n97.\n\nAlthough, as Professor Ian Brownlie has commented, \"the terminology of the subject is by no means settled\",234 the fundamental principles of what constitutes an expropriation are well established under international law. For example, as the ICSID tribunal in *Amco Asia v. Indonesia* noted, \"it is generally accepted in International Law, that a case of expropriation exists not only when a state takes over private property, but also when the expropriating state transfers ownership to another legal or natural person.235 The tribunal continued by observing that an expropriation \"also exists merely by the state withdrawing the protection of its courts form the owner expropriated, and tacitly allowing a *de facto* possessor to remain in possession of the thing seized....\"236\n\nIan Brownlie, *Principles of International Law,* 537 (4lh Ed. 1990) [Annex W104], Professor Brownlie also accurately observes that \"in any case form should not take precedence over substance.\" *Id.*\n\n*Amco Asia Corporation, et al.* v. *Republic of Indonesia,* Award on the Merits, ICSID Case No. ARB/81/1, at 62 (1984) [Annex W94].\n\n*Id.*\n\n98.\n\nIt is also well established that an expropriation is not limited to tangible property rights. As the panel in *SPP* v. *Egypt* explained, \"there is considerable authority for the proposition that Contract rights are entitled to the protection of international law and that the taking of such rights involves an obligation to make compensation therefore.\"237 Similarly, Chamber Two of the Iran-U.S. Claims Tribunal observed in the *Tippets* case that \"[a] deprivation or taking of property may occur under international law through interference by a state in the use of that property or with the enjoyment of its benefits, even where legal title to the property is not affected.\"238 The chamber continued by noting:\n\n[w]hile assumption of control over property by a government does not automatically and immediately justify a conclusion that the property has been taken by the government, thus requiring compensation under international law, such a conclusion is warranted whenever events demonstrate that the owner has been deprived of fundamental rights of ownership and it appears that this deprivation is not merely ephemeral.239\n\n*Southern Pacific Properties (Middle East) Limited* v. *Arab Republic of Egypt,* ICSID Case No. ARB/84/3, 8 ICSID Review 328, 375 (1993) [Annex W61], *See also* G.C. Christie \"What Constitutes a Taking of Property Under International Law,\" 38 Brit. Y.B. Int'l L. 308, 310-311 (1962) (citing *German Interests in Polish Upper Silesia,* Judgement No. 7, PCIJ, Series A (1926)) [Annex E-Mll].\n\n*Tippets, Abbett, McCarthy, Stratton* v. *TAMS-AFFA Consenting Engineers of Iran et al.,* Iran-U.S. Claims Tribunal, Award No. 141-7-2, at 225 (June 22, 1984) [Annex E-M12]. In some legal systems, a lease of land or a building is deemed real property.\n\n*Id.*\n\n99.\n\nHere, the Tribunal has no difficulty finding that the actions previously described constitute such an expropriation. Whether or not it authorized or participated in the actual seizures of the hotels, Egypt deprived Wena of its \"fundamental rights of ownership\" by allowing EHC forcibly to seize the hotels, to possess them illegally for nearly a year, and to return the hotels stripped of much of their furniture and fixtures.240 Egypt has suggested that this deprivation was merely \"ephemeral\" and therefore did not constitute an expropriation.241 The Tribunal disagrees. Putting aside various other improper actions, allowing an entity (over which Egypt could exert effective control) to seize and illegally possess the hotels for nearly a year is more than an ephemeral interference \"in the use of that property or with the enjoyment of its benefits.\"242\n\n*See generally* discussion in section III.B. 1, *supra.*\n\n*See, e.g.,* Respondent's Memorial on the Merits, at 10-11; Respondent's Rejoinder on the Merits, at 6-8.\n\n*Tippets,* at 225 [Annex E-M 12]. Such a deprivation easily qualifies as an expropriation within the meaning of Article 3(a) of the Harvard Draft Convention on the International Responsibility of States for Injuries to Aliens, 55 *Amer. J. Inf IL.* 545 (1961) (\"A 'taking of property' includes not only an outright taking of property but also any such unreasonable interference with the use, enjoyment, or disposal of property as to justify an inference that the owner will not be able to use, enjoy or dispose of the property within a reasonable period of time after the inception of such interference.\" (\"as quoted in G.C. Christie \"What Constitutes a Taking of Property Under International Law,\" 38 Brit. Y.B. Int'l L. 308, 330 (1962) [Annex E-Mll]).\n\n100.\n\nMoreover, even after the hotels were returned to Wena, Egypt failed to satisfy its obligation under the IPPA, and international norms generally, by refusing to offer Wena \"prompt, adequate and effective compensation\" for the losses it had suffered as result of Egypt's failure to act.243 For example, as already noted, on November 11, 1992, Mr. Malins wrote to U.S. Congressman Lee Hamilton, complaining that \"the Minister of Tourism, Dr. Fouad Sultan, will not consider our requests\" and that \"it is clear that subsequent to any perceived movement, Dr. Sultan personally intervenes to obstruct a solution.\"244\n\nIPPA, art 5(1) [Annex W2 & E-J22]. *See also* Ian Brownlie, *Principles of International Law,* 537 (4,h ed. 1990) (\"Expropriation of particular items of property is unlawful unless there is provision for payment of effective compensation.\" [Annex W104].\n\nLetter from Mr. Humfrey Malins, M.P.

Whether Wena's Claims are Time Barred**\n--------------------------------------------\n\n102.\n\nIn its Memorial on the Merits, Egypt argues that Wena's claims are time barred under Article 172(i) of the Egyptian Civil Code.245 This article provides that:\n\nA case filed for damages claimed for an illegal act, shall fall by prescription by lapse of three years from the day the wronged person learns of the damage taking place and of the person who is responsible for it, in all events the case shall fall with the lapse of 15 years from the day the illegal act takes place.246\n\nEgypt also observes that \"[e]ven if, contrary to the above, the Tribunal were to refuse to apply Article 172(i), it nevertheless would clearly still have the discretion to determine whether there has been unreasonable delay in the submission of the Claimant's claims to ICSID.\"247 Finally, Egypt contends that \"if Egyptian law is not applied, it would be reasonable... to have regard to the principles of prescription that are common to both of the Contracting Parties to the IPPA, *i.e.,* in this case, the United Kingdom,\" noting that the statute of limitation, under the English Limitation Act 1980, for breach of Contract or tortious behavior is six years.248\n\nRespondent's Memorial on the Merits, at 42-44.\n\nTranslation of Article 172(1) of the Egyptian Civil Code (Annex E-M36].\n\nRespondent's Memorial on the Merits, at 43.\n\n*Id*.,at 44.\n\n103.\n\nIronically, as Wena notes, Respondent did not previously raise this \"time bar\" claim in its objections to jurisdiction.249 To the contrary, Respondent asserted, as part of its objections, that Wena's Request for Arbitration was \"premature.\"250\n\nClaimant's Reply on the Merits, at 49.\n\n*See, e.g.,* Respondent's Memorial on Jurisdiction, at 2.\n\n104.\n\nSetting aside this apparent inconsistency, however, the Tribunal sees no legal or equitable reason to bar Wena's claim. First, contrary to Respondent's claim that \"Claimant severely compromised the ability of the Respondent to defend itself in these proceedings,\"251 the Tribunal agrees with Wena that, given the voluminous evidence produced by the parties as well as the extensive testimony provided by several witnesses (in particular, EHC's counsel, Mr. Munir, who showed a remarkable recollection of the case), neither party seems to have been disadvantaged \u2014 which, of course, is one of the equitable reasons for disallowing an untimely claim.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Memorial, at 25.\n\n105.\n\nAnother equitable principle is the notion of \"repose\" \u2014 that a respondent who reasonably believes that a dispute has been abandoned or laid to rest long ago should not be surprised by its subsequent resurrection.252 Here, however, the Tribunal finds that Wena has continued to be aggressive in prosecuting its claims and that Egypt has had ample notice of this on-going dispute.253\n\n*See, e.g., Gentini Case,* Italy-Venezuela Mixed Claims Commission, X R.S.A. 551, 560-561, (1903) [Annex W147].\n\n*See, e.g.,* Letter from Mr. Nael Farargy (Wena Hotels Ltd.) to His Excellency Dr. Kamal El Ganzouri (Prime Minister of Egypt) (February 23, 1998) (complaining of Wena's \"long and bitter disputes with the Egyptian State over direct foreign investment in Egypt \") [Annex W15].\n\n106.\n\nSecond, as Wena notes, municipal statutes of limitation do not necessarily bind a claim for a violation of an international treaty before an international tribunal. In *Alan Craig* v. *Ministry of Energy of Iran,* Chamber Three of the Iran-U.S. Claims Tribunal declined to apply an Iranian statute of limitation, despite the applicability of Iranian law.254 The tribunal noted:\n\nMunicipal statutes of limitation have not been considered as binding on claims before an international tribunal, although such periods may be taken into account by such a tribunal when determining the effect of an unreasonable delay in pursuing a claim.255\n\nThis general principle was recognized as long ago as 1903 by the Italy-Venezuela Mixed Claims Commission, which held in the **Gentini** case that, although local statutes of limitation cannot be invoked to defeat an international claim, international tribunals may consider equitable principles of prescription to reject untimely claims.256 Indeed, in the **Gentini** case, the American Umpire dismissed a thirty-year old claim. As discussed above, however, the Tribunal sees no reason to exercise such discretion in this case, where Egypt has had ample notice of Wena's continued claims and where neither party appears to have been substantially harmed in its ability to bring its case.\n\n*Alan Craig* v. *Ministry of Energy of Iran,* 3 Iran-U.S. Claims Tribunal 280 (1984) [Annex W155], *See also* George Aldrich, *The Jurisprudence of the Iran-United States Claims Tribunal* 480-482 (1996) [Annex E-M47].\n\n*Id*.,at 287.\n\n*Gentini Case,* Italy-Venezuela Claims Commission, X R.S.A. 551 (1903) [Annex W147]\n\n107.\n\nEgypt contends that Article 42(1) of the ICSID Convention mandates that the Tribunal must apply Article 172(i)'s three-year statute of limitation. The Tribunal does not agree. Article 42(1) of the ICSID Convention provides that a Tribunal shall apply domestic law \"and such rules of international law as may be applicable.\" As Wena notes, the decision in the *Amco Asia* case advised that one situation where a tribunal should apply rules of international law is \"to ensure the precedence of international law norms where the rules of the applicable domestic law are in collision with such norms.\"257 Here, strict application of Article 172(i)'s three-year limit, even if applicable, would collide with the general, well-established international principle recognized since before the *Gentini* case: that municipal statutes of limitation do not bind claims before an international tribunal (although tribunals are entitled to consider such statutes as well as equitable principles of prescription when handling untimely claims).\n\n*Amco Asia Corporation, etal.* v. *Republic of Indonesia,* ICSID Case No. ARB/81/1, International Arbitration Report 649,654(1986) [Annex W102],\n\n108.\n\nMoreover, as discussed in Section III. A, *supra,* the principal source of substantive law in this case is the IPPA itself. The Tribunal notes that although the IPPA's concise provisions do not contain detailed procedures for bringing an arbitration, Article 8(1) does expressly provide that if a dispute \"should arise and agreement cannot be reached within three months between the parties to this dispute through pursuit of local remedies, through conciliation or otherwise, then,\" and only then, may a party institute ICSID proceedings.258 This provision suggests a greater concern that the parties not rush into arbitration than that the parties will delay the initiation of proceedings.\n\nIPPA, art 8(1) [Annexes W2 & E-J22],\n\n109.\n\nFinally, although not necessary to the Tribunal's decision, the Tribunal is not convinced by the interpretation of Egyptian law presented by Respondent. As Respondent's expert noted, normally \"[a]ctions for liability for administrative acts are time-barred after fifteen years.\"259 Article 172(i), to the contrary, is viewed as an \"exception to the general principle concerning the statute of limitation [because] it relates to... unlawful acts.\"260 Dr. Elehwany reached the conclusion that the normal 15-year prescription did not apply and that the exceptional three-year period of Article 172(i) did, because \"what was being attributed to Egypt is liability for the physical acts *the police* are alleged to have committed on 1 April 1991 \u2014 namely the storming Nile and Luxor Hotels, the forcible eviction of the hotel guests and staff, the theft of cash, the detention of employees, the wrecking of everything....\"261\n\nLegal opinion of Dr. Hossain A\u00cd din Kamil Elehwany, at 23 (September 1999) [Annex E-M8].\n\n*Id.*\n\n*Id.,* at 25 (emphasis added).\n\n110.\n\nOf course, as Egypt argued on the merits, and the Tribunal agrees, it has not been demonstrated that the police physically participated in the seizure of the hotels. As discussed in section III.B., *supra,* Egypt's liability does not arise form physical acts by the police, but from Egypt's failure to accord Wena's investments as required by IPPA, \"full protection and security\" \u2014 by failing to prevent or immediately reverse EHC's physical acts. Such failure to provide legal protection would appear to constitute the typical administrative act for which the normal, fifteen-year prescription period applies. Thus, Egypt's response to the contention that it failed to provide \"full protection and security\" is inadequate.\n\n**D. Consultancy Agreement with Mr. Kandil**\n--------------------------------------------\n\n111.\n\nFinally, the Tribunal considers Egypt's contention that \"Claimant improperly sought to influence the Chairman of EHC with respect to the award of the leases\" for the Luxor and Nile hotels.262 If true, these allegations are disturbing and ground for dismissal of this claim. As Egypt properly notes, international tribunals have often held that corruption of the type alleged by Egypt are contrary to international *bones mores.263* However, as Professor Lalive notes, \"the delicate problems remains\" for an arbitral tribunal \"to determine precisely where the line should be drawn between legal and illegal contracts, between illegal bribery and legal 'commissions.'\"264\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Memorial, at 15.\n\n*See, e.g.,* Professor Ibrahim Fadlallah, *L'ordre public dans les sentences arbitrales,* Acad\u00e9mie de Droit International, Recueil des Cours, 377 (1994-V); Professor Pierre Lalive, \"Transnational (or Truly International) Public Policy and International Arbitration,\" *1CCA Congress Series,* No. 3, 276-277 (1987) [Annex E-M10],\n\nLalive, at 277 [Annex E-M10],\n\n112.\n\nAs noted above in section II.H (paragraphs 70-74), it is undisputed that Wena and Mr. Kandil entered into an agreement in August 1989, that the purpose of the agreement was for Mr. Kandil \"to give advice and assistance to the company as to opportunities available to the company for developing its hotel business in Egypt,\"265 that between August 18, 1989 and January 30, 1990 Wena made a total of GB\u00a3 52,000 in payments to Mr. Kandil, and that on March 26, 1991, Wena initiated a lawsuit against Mr. Kandil for allegedly breaching the agreement.266\n\nConsultancy Agreement between Mr. Kamal Kandil and Wena Hotels Limited [Annex W149],\n\nWrit of Summons issued by Wena Hotels Limited against Mr. Mohamed Kamal Ali Mohamed Kandil (March 26, 1991) [Annex E-M7],\n\n113.\n\nEgypt notes that, coincidentally, the first payment (on August 18, 1989) was ten days after the execution of the Luxor Hotel lease and that the last payment (on January 30.1990) was two days after the signing of the Nile Hotel lease. It also observes that the amount paid to Mr. Kandil exceeds that which would have been authorized under the consultancy agreement.\n\n114.\n\nWena, however, contends that the agreement did not concern the Nile and Luxor hotels, but was to help Wena pursue development opportunities in Misr Aswan, where Mr. Kandil was a tourist consultant. This assertion is supported by both Mr. Kandil's response to Wena's March 1991 lawsuit,267 as well as the letters Wena has submitted from December 1989 and January 1990, evincing its interest in the Abou Simbal and Aswan City developments in Misr Aswan.268\n\nLetter from Mr. Kamal Kandil to the Senior Master of the Royal Court of Justice (August 19, 1991) [Annex W150] (the \"subject of the above-mentioned Draft Contract was to develop new hotels in Egypt, these hotels being the Ramses Village project in Abou Simbal and a Conference Center in Aswan city.... I did not act in my quality of Chairman of the Egyptian Hotels Company nor did the Draft Contract concern either the Nile Hotel or the Luxor Hotel, instead I acted as Tourist Consultant for the Aswan Government and Chairman of the Board of Directors of Misr Aswan Tourist Co.\").\n\nFacsimile from Mr. Dimopolous (Wena Hotels Ltd.) to Mr. Kamal Kandil (Chairman, EHC) (December 13, 1989), enclosing letter from Mr. Nael El-Farargy (Wena Hotels Ltd.) to his Excellency, the Govemon of Aswan (December 11, 1989) [Annex W188]; letter from Mr. Nael El-Farargy (Wena Hotels Ltd.) to his Excellency, the Governor of Aswan (January 15, 1990) [Annex W189].\n\n115.\n\nWena also noted that according to Mr. Yusseri, the Luxor lease was awarded to Wena in a competitive bid with another investor, with Wena winning the lease because it agreed to pay a higher rent.269 Finally, Mr. Farargy testified that the Egyptian government was aware of the agreement that Mr. Kandil \"offered his help and assistance officially above board with their knowledge.\"270\n\nYusseri Direct Ex., at 4:3-11.\n\nFarargy Direct Ex., TR Day 1, at 142:27-28. *See also* Farargy Direct Ex., TR Day 1, at 142:26-143:6.\n\n116.\n\nAlthough the Tribunal believes Minister Sultan's testimony that he was not personally aware that \"Mr. Kandil was an agent to Farargy\" and that when he did learn about it, \"I passed that to the prosecutor requesting a full fledged investigation,\"271 it is undisputed that Mr. Kandil was never prosecuted in Egypt in connection with this agreement.272 Regrettably, because Egypt has failed to present the Tribunal with any information about the investigation requested by Minister Sultan, the Tribunal does not know whether an investigation was conducted and, if so, whether the investigation was closed because the prosecutor determined that Mr. Kandil was-innocent, because of lack evidence, or because of complicity by other government officials. Nevertheless, given the fact that the Egyptian government was made aware of this agreement by Minister Sultan but decided (for whatever reasons) not to prosecute Mr. Kandil, the Tribunal is reluctant to immunize Egypt from liability in this arbitration because it now alleges that the agreement with Mr. Kandil was illegal under Egyptian law.\n\nSultan Direct Ex., TR Day 3, at 188:11-14.\n\n*See, e.g.,* Claimant's Post-Hearing Reply, at 16; Respondent's Post-Hearing Memorial, at 14.\n\n117.\n\nMoreover, with the exception of the coincidence in the timing of the payments and the signing of the Luxor and Nile hotels (and the apparent over-payment of Mr. Kandil), the Tribunal notes that Egypt \u2014 which bears the burden of proving such an affirmative defense \u2014 has failed to present any evidence that would refute Wena's evidence that the Contract was a legitimate agreement to help pursue development opportunities in Misr Aswan. Nor did either party offer to present live testimony from Mr. Kandil.\n\n**IV. Damages**\n---------------\n\n118.\n\nArticle 5 of the IPPA between Egypt and the United Kingdom provides that in the event of an expropriation, the private investor shall be entitled to \"prompt, adequate, and effective compensation\" and \"such compensation shall amount to the market value of the investment immediately before the expropriation.\"273 The Tribunal shall apply this standard to the determination of damages.\n\nIPPA, art. 5 [Annexes W2 & E-J22].\n\n119.\n\nAltogether Wena claims damages of GB\u00a3 20.4 million for lost profits, GB\u00a3 22.8 million for lost opportunities and GB\u00a3 2.5 million for reinstatement costs, making a total of GB\u00a3 45.7 million.274 In addition, it seek interest on the previous sum and makes a claim of US$ 1,251,541 for counsel fees and costs of experts and witnesses incurred in pursuing its claim.275\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, at 67.\n\n*Id.,* at 68; Claimant's Statement of Fees and Expenses [Annex W194],\n\n120.\n\nIn the alternative, Wena claims US$8,819,466.93 as the amount of its investment in the Egyptian hotel venture.276\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, at 67 & n. 64; Claimant's Post-Hearing Reply, at 36.\n\n121.\n\nThe Respondent disputes these requests, contending that the claims summarized in paragraphs 119-120 are inappropriate and greatly overstated.277 In the alternative, the Respondent suggest that if anything were awarded for damages it should be the amount of Wena's investment in the Egyptian hotel venture, which, according to Respondent's expert, could not be more than GB\u00a3 750,000.278\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Memorial, at 25-42; Respondent's Post-Hearing Rebuttal Memorial, at 22-34.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Memorial, at 43; Respondent's Post-Hearing Rebuttal Memorial, at 34; *Provisional Evaluation of Lost Investment* and *Review of Financial Information* prepared by Pannell Kerr Forster, attached to Respondent's Rejoinder on the Merits; Direct Examination of Mr. Hugh Matthew Jones, TR Day 4, at 135:12-15.\n\n122.\n\nAlthough experts presented by each party adopted variations of the well-known discounted cash flow (\"DCF\") method of calculating the amount of the damages sustained by Wena, the experts reached widely varying results from their calculations.279 Since, however, the Tribunal is not persuaded that the DCF method is appropriate in this case, it deems it unnecessary to enter into a detailed discussion of the differences that the experts' calculations disclosed.\n\n*See Expert Report* prepared by BDO Hospitality Consulting, attached to Claimant's Memorial on the Merits (calculating a profit of GB\u00a3 4 million for the Luxor Hotel and a profit of GB\u00a3 21.3 million for the Nile Hotel); *Reports for El-Nile and Luxor Hotels* prepared by Pannell Kerr Forster, attached to Respondent's Post-Hearing Memorial (calculating a profit of less than GB\u00a3 10,000 for the Luxor Hotel and an actual loss for the Nile Hotel).\n\n123.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees with Egypt that, in this case, Wena's claims for lost profits (using a discounted cash flow analysis), lost opportunities and reinstatement costs are inappropriate\u2014because an award based on such claims would be too speculative. As another ICSID panel recently noted in the *Metalclad* decision:\n\nNormally, the fair market value of a going concern which has a history of profitable operation may be based on an estimate of future profits subject to a discounted cash flow analysis. However, where the enterprise has not operated for a sufficiently long time to establish a performance record or where it has failed to make a profit, future profits cannot be used to determine going concern or fair market value.280\n\nSimilarly, the ICC panel in the *SPP (Middle East) v. Egypt* arbitration case declined to accept a discounted cash flow projection because, *inter alia,* \"by the date of cancellation the great majority of the work had still to be done,\" and \"the calculation put forward by the Claimants produces a disparity between the amount of the investment made by the Claimants\" and the \"supposed value\" of the investment as calculated by the DCF analysis.281\n\n*Metalclad Corporation* v. *United Mexican States,* \u00b6\u00b6 119-120, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/97/l (2000) (internal citation omitted). The *Metalclad* award is publicly available from the U.S Securities Exchange Commission, Washington, D.C. 20549, and electronically at http://www.edgar-online.com, as an attachment to an 8-K filing of September 5, 2000 by Metalclad Corporation. *See also Southern Pacific Properties (Middle East) Limited* v. *Arab Republic of Egypt,* ICSID Case No. ARB/84/3, 8 ICSID Review 328, 381 (1993) [Annex W61] (\"In the Tribunal's view, the DCF method is not appropriate for determining the fair compensation in this case because the project was not in existence for a sufficient period of time to generate the data necessary for a meaningful DCF calculation.\").\n\n*SPP (Middle East) Ltd. (Hong Kong), etal. v Arab Republic of Egypt,\u00b665,* Appendix IV of ICC Arbitration (1983) [Annex E-M38].\n\n124.\n\nLike the *Metalclad* and *SPP* disputes, here, there is insufficiently \" solid base on which to found any profit... or for predicting growth or expansion of the investment made\" by Wena.282 Wena had operated the Luxor Hotel for less than eighteen months, and had not even completed its renovations on the Nile Hotel, before they were seized on April 1, 1991. In addition, there is some question whether Wena had sufficient finances to fund its renovation and operation of the hotels.283 Finally, the Tribunal is disinclined to grant Wena's request for lost profits and lost opportunities given the large disparity between the requested amount (GB\u00a3 45.7 million) and Wena's stated investment in the two hotels (US$8,819,466.93).284\n\n*American Manufacturing & Trading, Inc.* v *Republic of Zaire,* ICSID Case No. ARB/93/1, at 28 (1997) [Annex W115],\n\n*See, e.g., Review of Financial Information* prepared by Pannell Kerr Forster, attached to Respondent's Rejoinder on the Merits.\n\nApproximately GB\u00a3 6 million at current exchange rates.\n\n125.\n\nRather, the Tribunal agrees with the parties that the proper calculation of \"the market value of the investment expropriated immediately before the expropriation\"285 is best arrived at, in this case, by reference to Wena's actual investments in the two hotels. As noted above, Wena pleads in the alternative for award of at least the amount of Wena's proven investment in the Egyptian hotel venture. Similarly, Respondent pleads in the alternative that if any award were made it should not be more than the amount of Wena's proven investment.\n\nIPPA, art. 5 [Annexes W2 & E-J22].\n\n126.\n\nThe Tribunal is not persuaded by the relevance of the Respondent's contention that much of the Egyptian investment came from affiliates of Wena rather than from Wena. Instead the panel takes the view that whether the investments were made by Wena or by one of its affiliates, as long as those investments went into the Egyptian hotel venture, they should be recognized as appropriate investments. The panel was persuaded from the testimony it received that it is a widely established practice for hotel enterprises to adopt allocation measures, which spread the profits form the group operations into various jurisdictions where there are tax advantages to the group as a whole.\n\n127.\n\nOn the basis of investment, Claimant states its loss as US$8,819,466.93. However, the panel in pursuing an objection raised by the Respondent that there were certain elements of double counting,286 decided that the gross figure should be diminished by US$322,000.00 to eliminate probably double counting in certain instances. Beyond that, however, the panel was not persuaded by Respondent's evidence that there were significant other instances of double counting. Thus, the figure of US$8,819,466.93 should be diminished by US$322,000.00, leaving a total of US$8,497,466.93, which the Tribunal judges to be the approximate total for Wena's investment. From this, the Tribunal agreed that $435,570.38 should be deducted for the amount received already by Claimant as a result of the Egyptian arbitration award (the equivalent of EGP 1,477,498.30 at the'exchange rate of $1 = EGP 3.3921 on June 9, 1997, the date of payment of the Egyptian award).287\n\n*See* Provisional Evaluation of Lost Investment, \u00b6\u00b6.2-2.3 & 2.8, attached to Respondent's Rejoinder on the Merits.\n\nCheck drawn in Wena' favor by the Egyptian Ministry of Justice [Annex W93].\n\n128.\n\nTo this should be added an appropriate sum for interest. Claimant has claimed interest but neither specified a rate nor whether interest should be compounded.288 Moreover, the IPPA, the lease agreements, and the ICSID Convention and Rules are all silent on the subject of interest. The Panel is of the view that in this case interest should be awarded and that it would be appropriate,to adopt a rate of 9%, to be compounded quarterly.289\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, at 68.\n\n*Report for El-Nile Hotel* prepared by Pannell Kerr Forster, at 18, attached to Respondent's Post-Hearing Memorial (\"Long-term government bonds in Egypt are currently yielding 10%....\").\n\n129.\n\nLike the distinguished panel in the recently-issued **Metalclad** decision, this Tribunal also has determined that compounded interest will best \"restore the Claimant to a reasonable approximation of the position in which it would have been if the wrongful act had not taken place.\"290 Although the **Metalclad** tribunal awarded compound interest without comment, this panel feels that a brief explanation of its decision is warranted.291 This Tribunal believes that an award of compound (as opposed to simple) interest is generally appropriate in most modem, commercial arbitrations. As Professor Gotanda has observed \"almost all financing and investment vehicles involve compound interest.... If the claimant could have received compound interest merely by placing its money in a readily available and commonly used investment vehicle, it is neither logical nor equitable to award the claimant only simple interest.\"292 For similar reasons, Professor Mann has \"submitted that... compound interest may be and, in absence of special circumstances, should be awarded to the claimant as damages by international tribunals.\"293\n\n*Metalclad Corporation* v. *United Mexican States,* \u00b6 128, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/97/l (2000).\n\nAs several authorities have noted, \"virtually all monetary judgements... contain rulings on interest,\" and yet, this decision to award interest is often made without any discussion. *See, e.g.,* J. Gillis Wetter, *Interest as an Element of Damages in Arbitral Process,* 5 Int'l Fin. L. Rev. 20 (1986); F.A. Mann, *Compound Interest as an Item of Damage in International Law,* 21 Univ. of California, Davis L. J. 577, 578(1988).\n\nJohn Y. Gotanda, *Awarding Interest in International Arbitration,* 90 Amer. J. Int'l L. 40, 61 (1996).\n\nF.A. Mann, *Compound Interest as an Item of Damage in International Law,* 21 Univ. of California, Davis L. J. 577, 586 (1988). *See also id.,* at 585 (\"In this spirit it is necessary first to take account of modem economic conditions. It is a fact of universal experience that those who have a surplus of funds normally invest them to earn compound interest. On the other hand, many are compelled to borrow from banks and therefore must pay compound interest. This applies, in particular, to business people whose own funds are frequently invested in brick and mortar, machinery and equipment, and whose working capital is obtained by way of loans or overdrafts from banks.\"); *Starrett Housing Corp.* v. *Iran,* 16 Iran-U.S. Claims Tribunal 112,251-254 (1987) (Holtzmann, concurring).\n\n130.\n\nThus, the total, with interest through December 1, 2000 (US$11,431,386.88) is US$19,493,283.43. To this figure there should be added an appropriate sum to reimburse Claimant for attorney's fees and related costs, as reparation for losses sufficiently related to its central claims and in keeping with common practice in international arbitration. It will be recalled that the Tribunal, in its *Decision on Jurisdiction,* rejected Wena's claims for costs incurred in rebutting Egypt's objections to jurisdiction.294 Accordingly, the Tribunal shall only reimburse Claimant for that portion of its attorney's fees and costs incurred in presenting the merits of this arbitration. Wena has claimed US$1,107,703 for these expenses.295 Thus, including the Claimant's attorney's fees and costs, the grand total to be awarded Claimant is US$20,600,986.43. This award will be payable within 30 days from the date hereof. Thereafter, it will accumulate additional interest at 9% compounded quarterly until paid.\n\nTribunal's Decision on Jurisdiction, at 9 (released on June 29, 1999).\n\nClaimant's Statement of Fees and Expenses as of June 13, 2000 (Annex W194); letter from Mr. John Savage (Counsel for Wena) to Mr. Alejandro Escobar (Secretary to the Tribunal) (November 21, 2000).\n\n**V. Conclusion**\n-----------------\n\n131.\n\nIn sum, the Tribunal concludes that Egypt breached its obligations under Article 2(2) of the IPPA by failing to accord Wena's investments in Egypt \"fair and equitable treatment\" and \"full protection and security.\" Even if the Egyptian Government did not authorize or participate in the attacks, its failure to prevent the seizures and subsequent failure to protect Wena's investments give rise to liability. The Tribunal also finds that Egypt's actions amounted to an expropriation \u2014 transferring control of the hotels from Wena to EHC without \"prompt, adequate and effective compensation\" in violation of Article 5 of the IPPA.\n\n132.\n\nThe Tribunal also dismisses the two affirmative defenses raised by Egypt. First, the Tribunal does not agree with Egypt's contention that Wena's claims are time barred. Second, although Egypt has raised some disturbing allegations regarding payments made to Mr. Kandil, the Tribunal finds that Egypt has failed to meet its evidentiary burden of proving that these payments were illegitimate.\n\n**VI. The Operative Part**\n--------------------------\n\n133.\n\nFor these reasons\n\nTHE TRIBUNAL, unanimously,\n\n134.\n\nFINDS that Egypt breached its obligations to Wena by failing to accord Wena's investments in Egypt fair and equitable treatment and full protection and security in violation of Article 2(2) of the IPPA;\n\n135.\n\nFINDS that Egypt's actions amounted to an expropriation without prompt, adequate and effective compensation in violation of Article 5 of the IPPA;\n\nand\n\n136.\n\nAWARDS to Wena US$20,600,986.43 in damages, interest, attorneys fees and expenses.

The Proceeding**\n---------------------\n\n1.\n\nOn January 19, 2001, the Arab Republic of Egypt (hereinafter also \"Egypt\" or \"the Applicant\") filed with the Secretariat of the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (hereinafter \"ICSID\" or \"the Centre\") an application for annulment, under Article 52 of the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States (hereinafter \"the ICSID Convention\" or \"the Convention\"), of an arbitral Award rendered on December 8.2000 (hereinafter \"the Award\") in the arbitration proceeding between Wena Hotels Limited and the Arab Republic of Egypt, ICSID Case No. ARB/98/4.\n\n2.\n\nWena Hotels Limited (hereinafter \"Wena\" or \"the Respondent\"), a company established under the laws of the United Kingdom, had instituted that arbitration proceedings against Egypt by submitting to the Centre a request for arbitration dated July 10, 1998, which was supplemented by Wena's letters to the Centre of July 16, 1998 and July 17, 1998, and was registered by the Secretary-General of ICSID on July 31, 1998. The request for arbitration invoked the provisions of the Agreement between the United Kingdom and the Arab Republic of Egypt for the Promotion and Protection of Investments, which was concluded on February 24, 1976, and entered into force on February 24, 1976.\n\n3.\n\nThe Arbitral Tribunal that handed down the Award (hereinafter \"the Tribunal\") was composed of Professor Ibrahim Fadlallah, a national of Lebanon, appointed by Wena; Professor Don Wallace, Jr., a United States national, appointed by Egypt; and by Mr. Monroe Leigh, a United States national, appointed by the Chairman of ICSID's Administrative Council, who served as President of the Tribunal.\n\n4.\n\nThe Arab Republic of Egypt's Request for annulment was registered by the Secretary-General of ICSID on January 24, 2001. In due course, the Chairman of ICSID's Administrative Council appointed Professor Andreas Bucher, a national of Switzerland, Professor Konstantinos D. Kerameus, a national of Greece, and Professor Francisco Orrego Vicu\u00f1a, a national of Chile, as members of the *ad hoc* Committee to consider the application (hereinafter \"the Committee\"), in accordance with Article 52(3) of the ICSID Convention. By letter of March 6, 2001, the Deputy Secretary-General of ICSID notified the parties that all the members of the Committee had accepted their appointment and that the Committee was therefore deemed to have been constituted, and the proceedings to have begun, on that date. The members of the Committee elected Professor Konstantinos D. Kerameus as its President. Mr. Alejandro Escobar, Senior Counsel, ICSID, served as Secretary of the Committee.\n\n5.\n\nThe application for annulment was accompanied by a request for stay of enforcement of the Award (hereinafter also \"the stay\"). In accordance with Article 52(5) of the ICSID Convention, together with the notice of registration of the application, the Secretary-General of ICSID informed both parties of the provisional stay of enforcement of the Award. By letter of January 25, 2001, Wena requested the Committee, upon its constitution, to decided whether the provisional stay of enforcement of the Award should be continued. Wena sought the termination of the stay; in the alternative, it sought for the Committee to modify the stay by requiring the posting of security by Egypt as a condition for continuation of the stay. In accordance with Rule 54 of the Arbitration Rules of the Centre (\"hereinafter \"Arbitration Rules\"), the Committee immediately proceeded to consider the question of continuation of the stay of enforcement of the Award.\n\n6.\n\nHaving invited and received in due course the written observation of the parties on the question of continuation of the stay, the Committee issued its Procedural Order No. 1 on April 5, 2001, by which it granted the continuation of the stay, conditional upon the posting by Egypt of an unconditional and irrevocable letter of guarantee for the total amount of the Award, plus interest accrued through April 7, 2001. Procedural Order No. 1 set forth the following further proviso concerning such letter of guarantee:\n\nThe letter of guarantee may be entirely drawn down upon by Wena Hotels Limited in the event that the application is denied in its entirety. In the event the application is accepted only in part, the letter of guarantee may be drawn down upon Wena Hotels Limited to the extent of the unannulled part of the Award, subject to any further stay granted by the Committee under Arbitration Rule 54(3) or by a new Arbitral Tribunal under Arbitration Rule 55(3).\n\nThe Arab Republic of Egypt posted such letter of guarantee in due course, with an original validity through October 31, 2001. By letter of September 27, 2001, Egypt informed the Committee that the validity of such letter of guarantee had been extended to February 28, 2002.\n\n7.\n\nWith agreement of the Parties, the Committee held its first session with the parties in Paris on May 7, 2001. Each member of the Committee having signed the declaration required by Arbitration Rule 6, it was agreed at the first session that the Committee had been properly constituted in accordance with the Convention and the Arbitration Rules. The following representation of the parties was also noted at the first session:\n\nThe Applicant, the Arab Republic of Egypt, is represented in this proceeding by\n\nEgyptian State La Suits Authority  \nc/o Counselor Osama Ahmed Mahmoud, Vice-President, and Counselor Hussein Mostafa Fathi   \nEl Tahreer Building, 10th Floor   \nCairo, Egypt\n\nand by\n\nFreshfields Bruckhaus Deringer   \nc/o Mr. Eric A. Schwartz   \n69 boulevard Haussmann 75008   \nParis, France\n\nThe Respondent, Wena Hotels Limited, is represented in this proceeding by\n\nShearman & Sterling  \nc/o Mr. Emmanuel Gaillard  \nand Mr. John Savage  \n114, avenue des Champs-Elys\u00e9es  \n75008 Paris, France\n\nMr. Peter Griffin, Shearman & Sterling, also acted as counsel for Wena in the proceeding. Certified copies of the minutes of that first session were distributed to the parties and the members of the Committee by the Secretariat's letter ofMay31.2001.\n\n8.\n\nAs agreed at the first session, the parties filed in due course their written pleadings on the application for annulment. The Arab Republic of Egypt filed its memorial on annulment, with accompanying documentation, on June 29, 2001. Wena filed its counter-memorial opposing annulment, with accompanying documentation, on August 28, 2001. Egypt filed its reply, with accompanying documentation, on September 10, 2001. Wena filed its rejoinder, with accompanying documentation, on September 26, 2001. Complete copies of each filing were duly delivered by each party to the Paris-based counsel of the other party, and distributed to the members of the Committee by the Secretariat.\n\n9.\n\nAs further agreed at the first session, the Committee held a hearing with the Parties in Paris on October 22 and 23.2001. At the hearing, Mr. Eric A. Schwartz addressed the Committee on behalf of Egypt, and Professor Emmanuel Gaillard, Mr. Peter Griffin and Mr. John Savage addressed the Committee on behalf of Wena. In addition the Committee heard the testimony at the hearing of Professor W. Michael Reisman as the expert proposed by Egypt. Wena and Egypt proceeded respectively to the cross- and re-direct examination of Professor Reisman at the hearing. The Committee put questions to the Parties, which were answered by their respective counsel at the hearing. A full verbatim transcript was made of the hearing, under arrangements undertaken by the Parties, and copies of such transcript were distributed to the members of the Committee by the Secretariat..\n\n10.\n\nAt the first session of May 7, 2001, Egypt submitted documentation concerning a garnishee order on payment of the Award by Egypt, as security for the satisfaction of a claim by a third party against Wena for approximately US$45,000 (hereinafter \"the garnishee order\"). Counsel for Egypt indicated that, under Egyptian law, the entire amount of the Award is garnished or frozen until that claim is settled, and that payment of the Award in any part, for example by drawing down on the letter of guarantee posted by Egypt, could result in Egypt's liability and thus double jeopardy as regards the amount of that claim. The Committee at the first session reserved its opinion and further directions on this matter.\n\n11.\n\nOn May 25, 2001, counsel for Egypt addressed a letter to counsel for Wena, with a copy to the Centre, concerning the garnishee order. By letter of September 27, 2001, Egypt informed the Committee that it had not received a response from Wena to its letter of May 25, and requested the Committee to provide the parties with further directions on this matter. By letters of October 2 and 16, 2001, Wena submitted its observations on the garnishee order, offering to assist Egypt in contesting such order before the Egyptian courts. Further observations on the garnishee order were made by both parties at the conclusion of the hearing on October 23, 2001.\n\n12.\n\nAt the hearing, Egypt reserved its right to make further written comments in response to Wena's letter of October 2 and 16.2001, and Wena submitted that it would be premature for the Committee to provide any directions on the matter, arguing that more information was needed from Egypt on the status of the garnishee order. The President of the Committee then informed the parties that the Committee would refrain from making any ruling on the question of the garnishee order until such a time as the Parties submitted further observations. The President outlined certain aspects that the Parties should address in that event. However, neither Party submitted such further observations following the hearing. Accordingly, no determination on this issue by the Committee was required.\n\n13.\n\nThe Committee began its deliberation following the hearing and held a working session in Paris on January 28, 2002.\n\n14.\n\nOn January 25.2002, the President of the Committee requested ICSID to inform the Parties that the proceeding was closed.\n\n**B. Background of the dispute and Award**\n------------------------------------------\n\n15.\n\nThe Award subject of this proceeding for annulment concerns a dispute relating to two hotels located in Luxor and Cairo, Egypt, that were leased to Wena in 1989 and 1990 respectively on a long-term basis by the Egyptian Hotel Company, a State-owned Egyptian company with its own legal personality (hereinafter \"EHC\"). After certain disputes arose between EHC and Wena related to their respective obligations under the lease agreements, the two hotels were seized by EHC on April 1, 1991. Egypt did recognize that the latter event was an act of self-help that was wrongful. It caused the hotels to be returned to Wena in 1992. Wena was ultimately evicted from the Nile Hotel in 1995, while the Luxor Hotel was placed injudicial receivership in 1997. Egypt asserts that Wena failed to pay rent or to fulfill its development obligations to the hotels. It refers to an arbitral award finding that Wena's failure to pay rent for the Nile Hotel entitled EHC to terminate the lease.\n\n16.\n\nAfter the return of the hotels, Wena sought compensation from Egypt, based on rights of nationals of the United Kingdom in respect of their investments in Egypt and arising out of the Agreement for the Promotion and Protection of Investments entered into by the United Kingdom and Egypt on June 11, 1975 (hereinafter \"IPPA\"). In its Award, the Tribunal concluded that Egypt did violate its obligation under the IPPA by failing to provide Wena's investments in Egypt \"fair and equitable treatment\" and \"full protection and security\" (Art. 2[2] IPPA) and by failing to provide Wena with \"prompt, adequate and effective compensation\" following the expropriation of the investments (Art. 5[1 ] IPPA). For the reasons stated in the Award, the Tribunal\n\n\"134. FINDS that Egypt breached its obligations to Wena by failing to accord Wena's investments in Egypt fair and equitable treatment and full protection and security in violation of Article 2(2) of the IPPA;\n\n135. FIND that Egypt's actions amounted to an expropriation without prompt, adequate and effective compensation in violation of Article 5 of the IPPA;\n\nand\n\n136. AWARDS to Wena US$20,600,986.43 in damages, interest, attorneys fees and expenses. This award will be payable by Egypt within 30 days from the date of this Award. Thereafter, it will accumulate additional interest at 9% compounded quarterly until paid.\"\n\n**C. The Request for Annulment**\n--------------------------------\n\n17.\n\nUnder Article 52(1) of the ICSID Convention,\n\n\"(1) Either party may request annulment of the award by an application in writing addressed to the Secretary-General on one or more of the following grounds:\n\n(a) that the Tribunal was not properly constituted;\n\n(b) that the Tribunal has manifestly exceeded its powers;\n\n(c) that there was corruption on the part of a member of the Tribunal;\n\n(d) that there has been a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure;\n\nor\n\n(e) that the award has failed to state the reasons on which it is based.\"\n\nThese grounds for annulment are enumerated exhaustively. The Request for annulment is based on three of these grounds. The Applicant contends that the Tribunal has manifestly exceeded its powers (l.b), that there has been a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure (l.d), and that the Award has failed to state the reasons on which it is based (l.e).\n\n18.\n\nAs has been stated in earlier published decisions made on requests for annulment of ICSID awards, the remedy of Article 52 is in no sense an appeal.1 The power for review is limited to the grounds of annulment as defined in this provision. These grounds are to be interpreted neither narrowly nor extensively.2\n\n*See Klockner* v. *Cameroun,* Decision on Annulment, 3 May 1985 (hereinafter *\"Klockner I\"),* 2 *ICSID Reports* 95, at 97, 126 (paras. 3.83); *Amco Asia Corporation and others* v. *Republic of Indonesia,* Decision on Annulment, 16 May 1986 *(\"Amco I\"),* 1 *ICSID Reports* 509, at 515/516 (para. 23); *Maritime International Nominees Establishment* v. *Republic of Guinea,* Decision on Annulment, 22 December 1989 (*\"MINE\"),* 4 *ICSID Reports* 79, at 85 (para. 4.04).\n\n*See Klockner 1.2 ICSID Reports,* at 97, 120, 138 (paras 3, 62, 119); *MINE,* 4 *ICSID Reports,* at 85 (para. 4.05).\n\n19.\n\nArticle 52(2) provides, in relevant part, that the application shall be made within 120 days after the date on which the Award was rendered. The Applicant's Request for Annulment has been deposited within such time limit and it invoked expressly the grounds stated in Article 52(1), letters b), d) and e). It was argued by Wena, however, that several grounds for annulment were time-barred, by the fact that they had not been argued in the initial Request, but only later in the Applicant's Memorial requesting annulment. It is admitted by Wena that these arguments do not exceed the scope of the grounds for annulment initially invoked. Arbitration Rule 50(1)(c) requires indeed that the grounds for annulment be stated \"in detail\" in the application for annulment. On the other hand, the ICSID Convention does not state any requirement of completeness of the Application, except to the extent that the Application must invoke one or more of the grounds listed in Article 52(1) on which it is based. The ICSID Convention thus does not preclude raising new arguments which are related to a ground of annulment invoked within the time limit fixed in the Convention. This is of no harm to the opposing party, which is not requested to answer the Request, but later only the first memorial of the Applicant. The Committee therefore does not retain Wena's objection.\n\n20.\n\nThe Committee notes that the Applicant has withdrawn the argument that the Tribunal exceeded its powers under Article 42(1) in refusing to apply Egyptian law to Egypt's defense that Wena's claims were time-barred.\n\n**II.** Did the Tribunal manifestly exceed its powers?\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n21.\n\nIn respect of the first ground for annulment it invoked, the Applicant argues that the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers in the terms of Article 52(1)(b) of the ICSID Convention. In the Applicant's view this occurred in two ways. First, the Tribunal failed to apply Egyptian law in contravention of Article 42(1) of the Convention. Second, the Tribunal allowed Wena to assert claims on behalf of investors that are not entitled to protection under the IPPA.\n\n22.\n\nThe Committee is mindful of the views expressed *Klockner I,3 Amco I4* and *MINE5* to the effect that the failure to apply the proper law may constitute a manifest excess of power and a ground for annulment. It is also mindful of the distinction between failure to apply the proper law and the *error in judicando* drawn in *Klockner I,* and the consequential need to avoid the reopening of the merits in proceedings that would turn annulment into appeal.6\n\n*Klockner I,* 2 *ICSID Reports,* at 118 (para 58.).\n\n*Amco I,* 1 *ICSID Reports,* at 515 (para. 23).\n\n*MINE,* 4 *ICSID Reports,* at 87 (para. 5.03).\n\n*Klockner I,* 2 *ICSID Reports,* at 119 (para. 61).\n\n23.\n\nThe question is then whether in the instant case the Tribunal, although having referred to the law of the host State, has in fact failed to apply Egyptian law because of having turned to the application of the provisions of the IPPA as the primary source. In the Applicant's opinion in all cases it is the law of the host State that is intended to be the primary source, not international law. The Respondent is of the view that the Tribunal correctly applied the IPPA as the law relevant to this dispute.\n\n24.\n\nThe Applicant has moreover made the argument that the application of Egyptian law touches upon a fundamental question, that of the \"legitimate principle that a country that attracts foreign investment is entitled to insist that investors comply with the laws of that country.\" There can be no disagreement with such proposition. The quest, however, is whether the resort to international law in any way contradicts the principle stated.\n\n25.\n\nIn the context of determinations on excess of power, it is further to be considered that for it to be a ground of annulment, the Tribunal must have \"manifestly exceeded its powers,\" as stated in Article 52(1)(b) of the ICSID Convention. The classic example of manifest excess of power under international law is that of a tribunal having been asked to adjudicate on one of two possible boundary lines submitted by the parties chooses a third line.7 The excess of power must be self-evident rather than the product of elaborate interpretations one way or the other. When the latter happens the excess of power is no longer manifest. This is, among others, the reason why earlier decisions reached by *ad hoc* committees have been so extensively debated.\n\n*North-Eastern Boundary* case, Untied States-Canada, 1831, Moore, *Arbitrations,* Vol. I, 119, at 133-134, as cited in J.L. Simpson and Hazel Fox, *International Arbitration, Law and Practice,* 1959, at 250.\n\n**A. Did the Tribunal manifestly fail to apply the applicable law?**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n26.\n\nArticle 42(1) of the ICSID Convention provides that:\n\n\"The Tribunal shall decide a dispute in accordance with such rules of law as may be agreed by the parties. In the absence of such agreement, the Tribunal shall apply the law of Contracting State party to the dispute (including its rules on the conflict of laws) and such rules of international law as may be applicable.\"\n\n27.\n\nThe first aspect the Committee must establish is whether the Parties agreed to the rules of law to be applied by the Tribunal in the light of the first sentence of the Article. In fact, the question touches upon a prior determination of the proper subject of the dispute brought before the Tribunal and the parties concerned by it.\n\n*(i) The dispute brought before the Tribunal*\n---------------------------------------------\n\n28.\n\nIt is undisputed that the lease contracts were concluded between Wena and EHC. It is also undisputed that the two leases were subject to Egyptian law. However, there is disagreement about the meaning of this submission to Egyptian law. In the Applicant's view this was the choice of law required by the first sentence of Article 42(1). Accordingly, the Tribunal was under the obligation to apply such law.\n\n29.\n\nThe Respondent believes otherwise. Egyptian law was indeed applicable, but only in the context of the disputes concerning those parties and for the commercial aspects specifically arising from the contracts. The dispute before the Tribunal involved different parties, namely the investor and the Egyptian State, and concerned a subject matter entirely different from the commercial aspects under the leases. The dispute before the Tribunal is, in the Respondent's view, about the role of the State in the light of its obligations under the IPPA. Accordingly, the Respondent is of the view that the parties to the instant case made no choice of law under Article 42(1).\n\n30.\n\nIt is not disputed that EHC is a State-owned company with its own legal personality. Neither is it disputed that its functions are essentially commercial and not governmental in nature. In fact, none of the Parties has claimed that the acts of EHC could be attributed to the State. Therefore, EHC is to be dealt with as an entity different from the Egyptian State, with a legal personality of its own, the functions of which cannot be confused with those of the State.\n\n31.\n\nThe leases deal with questions that are by definition of a commercial nature. The IPPA deals with questions that are essentially of a governmental nature, namely the standards of treatment accorded by the State to foreign investors. It is therefore apparent that Wena and EHC agreed to a particular contract, the applicable law and the dispute settlement arrangement in respect of one kind of subject, that relating to commercial problems under the leases. It is also apparent that Wena as a national of a Contracting State could invoke the IPPA for the purpose of a different kind of dispute, that concerning the treatment of foreign investors by Egypt. This other mechanism has a different and separate dispute settlement arrangement and might include a different choice of law provision or make no choice at all.\n\n32.\n\nThe issue was also raised during the jurisdictional phase of the case before the Tribunal. In fact, Egypt objected to the jurisdiction of the Tribunal on the basis that there was no legal dispute between Wena and Egypt. This objection was denied by the Tribunal.\n\n33.\n\nThe Parties appear to be in agreement that the acts of self-help undertaken by EHC in respect of the hotels were wrongful and that the initiative to undertake those acts is not to be attributed to the State. Indeed, this case involves a claim not against the acts of EHC but against those acts or omissions of the State that the investor considers to be in violation of the IPPA. It is the latter acts that were considered by the Tribunal on the merits as amounting to measures having effects equivalent to expropriation of the investment.\n\n34.\n\nHowever, the Parties again here differ as to the consequences of such dual relationship, existing between Wena and EHC on one hand, and between Wena and Egypt on the other hand. For the Applicant the resolution of the dispute brought before the Tribunal cannot be separated from the leases and the rights of the parties to those contracts. The Applicant has in fact argued that the relationship between Wena and Egypt under the IPPA is entirely dependent upon and a function of the relationship between Wena and EHC under the leases. The Respondent believes that the failure of the State to adopt measures in protection of the investor is a violation of the IPPA independently of any questions arising under the leases.\n\n35.\n\nThe Committee cannot ignore of course that there is a connection between the leases and the IPPA since the former were designed to operate under the protection of the IPPA as the materialization of the investment. But this is simply a condition precedent to the operation of the IPPA. It does not involve an amalgamation of different legal instruments and dispute settlement arrangements. Just as EHC does not represent the State nor can its acts be attributed to it because of its commercial and private function, the acts or failures to act of the State cannot be considered as a question connected to the performance of the parties under the leases. The private and public functions of these various instruments are thus kept separate and distinct.\n\n36.\n\nThis Committee accordingly concludes that the subject matter of the lease agreements submitted to Egyptian law was different from the subject matter brought before ICSID arbitration under the IPPA. It follows that it cannot be held that the Parties to the instant case have made a choice of law under the first sentence of Article 42(1) of the ICSID Convention.\n\n*(ii) The role of International Law*\n------------------------------------\n\n37.\n\nThe second sentence of Article 42(1) of the ICSID Convention provides that, in the absence of an agreement on the applicable rules of law, the Tribunal shall apply the law of the host State, including its rules on the conflict of laws, and such rules of international law as may be applicable. It is therefore necessary for the Committee to examine the meaning of this second sentence and the question of the interrelation between domestic and international law in this context.\n\n38.\n\nThis discussion brings into light the various views expressed as to the role of international law in the context of Article 42(1). Scholarly opinion, authoritative writings and some ICSID decisions have dealt with this matter. Some views have argued for a broad role of international law, including not only the rules embodied in treaties but also the rather large definition of sources contained in Article 38(1) of the Statute of the International Court of Justice.8 Other views have expressed that international law is called in to supplement the applicable domestic law in case of the existence of *lacunae.9* In *Klockner I* the *ad hoc* Committee introduced the concept of international law as *complementary* to the applicable law in case of *lacunae* and as *corrective* in case that the applicable domestic law would not conform on all points to the principles of international law.10 There is also the view that international law has a controlling function of domestic applicable law to the extent that there is a collision between such law and fundamental norms of international law embodied in the concept of *jus cogens.11*\n\nWorld Bank, *Report of the Executive Directors on the ICSID Convention,* Documents Concerning the Origin and the Formulation of the Convention, 1968, 962, at 1029 (para. 40).\n\n*Amco I,* 1 *ICSID Reports,* at 515 (para. 20); *Southern Pacific Properties (Middle East) Limited* v. *Arab Republic of Egypt,* Award, 20 May 1992 *(SPP v. Egypt),* 3 *ICSID Reports* 189, at 207 (para. 80).\n\n*Klockner I,* 2 *ICSID Reports,* at 122 (para. 69).\n\nW. Michael Reisman: \"The Regime for *Lacunae* in the ICSID Choice of Law Provision and the Question of Its Threshold,\" 15 *ICSID* *Review \u2014 Foreign Investment Law Journal* 362-381 (2000). Professor Reisman also prepared a legal opinion on the matter submitted by the Applicant in the proceeding before the Committee, whereas Wena submitted a legal opinion prepared by Professor Christoph Schreuer.\n\n39.\n\nSome of these views have in common the fact that they are aimed at restricting the role of international law and highlighting that of the law of the host State. Conversely, the view that calls for a broad application of international law aims at restricting the role of the law of the host State. There seems not to be a single answer as to which of these approaches is the correct one. The circumstances of each case may justify one or another solution. However, this Committee's task is not to elaborate precise conclusions on this matter, but only to decide whether the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers with respect to Article 42(1) of the ICSID Convention. Further, the use of the word \"may\" in the second sentence of this provision indicates that the Convention does not draw a sharp line for the distinction of the respective scope of international and of domestic law and, correspondingly, that this has the effect to confer on to the Tribunal a certain margin and power for interpretation.\n\n40.\n\nWhat is clear is that the sense and meaning of the negotiations leading to the second sentence of Article 42(1) allowed for both legal orders to have a role. The law of the host State can indeed be applied in conjunction with international law if this is justified. So too international law can be applied by itself if the appropriate rule is found in this other ambit.\n\n41.\n\nIn particular, the rules of international law that directly or indirectly relate to the State's consent prevail over domestic rules that might be incompatible with them. In this context it cannot be concluded that the resort to the rules of international law under the Convention, or under particular treaties related to its operation, is antagonistic to that State's national interest.\n\n42.\n\nParticular emphasis is put on this view when the rules in question have been expressly accepted by the host State. Indeed, under the Egyptian Constitution treaties that have been ratified and published \"have the force of law.\"12 Most commentators interpret this provision as equating treaties with domestic legislation.13 On occasions the courts have decided that treaty rules prevail not only over prior legislation but also over subsequent legislation.14 It has also been held that *lex specialis* such as treaty law prevails over *lex generalis* embodied in domestic law.15 A number of important domestic laws, including the Civil Code and Code of Civil Procedure of Egypt, provide in certain matters for a \"without prejudice clause\" in favor of the relevant treaty provisions.16 This amounts to a kind of *renvoi* to international law by the very law of the host State.\n\nIbrahim Shihata: \"Egypt\" *hr.* Elihu Lauterpacht and John G. Collier (eds.): *Individual Rights and the State in Foreign Affairs,* 1977, 204-242, at 235, with particular reference to Article 151 of the Egyptian Constitution.\n\n*Ibid.,* at 235-236\n\n*Ibid.,* footnotes 126-129.\n\nRuling on the application for cassation No. 1885 for the 50lh judicial year. Hearing No. 50, December 1983 excerpt as translated for the record.\n\nShihata, *loc. cit.,* at 236, note 125.\n\n43.\n\nMost prominent among this treaty law is that embodied in investment treaties.17 As from 1953 Egypt has been a leader in the field. Examples of this leadership are the Convention on Payments on Current Transactions and the Facilitation of Transfer of Capital among the States of the Arab League of 1953, the Convention on the Investment and Transfer of Arab Capital of 1971, the Convention Establishing the Arab Investment Guarantee Corporation, the ICSID Convention and numerous bilateral investment treaties.\n\n*Ibid..,* at 237 and discussion of the investment treaties made by Egypt.\n\n44.\n\nThis treaty law and practice evidences that when a tribunal applies the law embodied in a treaty to which Egypt is a party it is not applying rules alien to the domestic legal system of this country. This might also be true of other sources of international law, such as those listed in Article 38(1) of the Statute of the International Court of Justice mentioned above.\n\n45.\n\nTherefore, the reliance of the Tribunal on the IPPA as the primary source of law is not in derogation or contradiction to the Egyptian law and policy in this matter. In fact, Egyptian law and investment policies are fully supportive of the rights of investors in that country. The ICSID Convention and the related bilateral investment treaties are specifically mentioned in Egypt's foreign investment policy statements.18\n\nEgyptian State Information Service, Foreign Investment, www.sis.gov.eg/inv2000/html (Chapter 2); and www.sis.gov.eg/inv99/html/entl.htm.\n\n46.\n\nIn the light of the above this Committee concludes that in applying the rules of the IPPA in the instant case the Tribunal did not exceed its powers.\n\n*(iii) Specific Complaints*\n---------------------------\n\n47.\n\nThe Applicant invokes three specific areas in which the Tribunal exceeded its powers as a consequence of not applying Egyptian law. The first concerns the validity of the leases in connection with an alleged incident of corruption or conflict of interest in the person of Mr. Kandil who was consulting Wena while he acted also as Chairman of EHC. While such improper influence can invalidate the lease agreements under Egyptian law, or for the matter of corruption also under international law, such unlawful act has to be proved. The Tribunal did not consider that there was sufficient evidence to prove such a claim. It is therefore not a question of the applicable law but of evidence, the evaluation of which relates to the merits of the case and is not a matter for the ground for annulment related to a purported excess of power by the Tribunal.\n\n48.\n\nThe second area the Applicant argues should have been considered under Egyptian law is the investor's rights under the leases. There is no doubt that there was a dispute between Wena and EHC in respect of the obligations under the leases, each accusing the other of failure to comply with the agreed terms of the contract. This is precisely the kind of dispute governed by Egyptian law that was, at least in respect of one hotel, submitted to arbitration under the lease agreements. This is not the dispute brought to arbitration under the ICSID Convention and the IPPA.\n\n49.\n\nIt is here where the relationship between one dispute and the other becomes relevant. The ultimate purpose of the relief sought by Wena is to have its losses compensated. To the extent this relief was partially obtained in the domestic arbitration, the Tribunal in awarding damages under the IPPA did take into account such partial indemnification so as to prevent a kind of double dipping in favor of the investor. The two disputes are still separate but the ultimate result is the compensation of the investor for the wrongdoings that have affect its business.\n\n50.\n\nThe third area where the Applicant argues the Tribunal should have applied Egyptian law is the determination of interest. It is quite true, as argued by the Applicant, that Article 226 of the Egyptian Civil Code provides for various limits to the determination of interest. But it is also true that various was have been used to increase those limits, particularly by means of the award of supplemental damages.19 Some of these alternatives were utilized in *SPP v. Egypt,* including the adjustment for devaluation.20\n\nJohn **Y.** Gotanda: \"Awarding interest in international arbitration,\" 90 *American Journal of International Law* 40-63, at 48 (1996).\n\n*SPP* v. *Egypt* cited supra note 9, 3 *ICSID Reports* at 242, 244 (paras. 222, 237), and discussion in W. Laurence Craig: \"The Final Chapter in the Pyramids Case: Discounting an ICSID Award for Annulment Risk,\" 8 *ICSID Review \u2014Foreign Investment Law Journal* 264-293, at 278-279 (1993).\n\n51.\n\nThe issue before this Committee, however, is a different one. Once the Tribunal decided to apply the IPPA to the dispute brought to it, and given the fact that this agreement does not contain provisions on the determination of interest as such, should the Tribunal have reverted to Egyptian law to this end or should it have resorted, as it did, to international law and related ICSID practice?\n\n52.\n\nWhen operating under the rules of the IPPA in a matter of expropriation or measures of equivalent effect, the Tribunal could not ignore the fact that Article 5 of this Agreement provides for two criteria in respect of compensation. Article 5 of the IPPA reads as follows:\n\n\" Investments of nationals or companies of either Contracting Party shall not be nationalised, expropriated or subjected to measures having effect equivalent to nationalisation or expropriation (hereinafter referred to as \"expropriation\") in the territory of the other Contracting Party except for a public purpose related to the internal needs of that Party and against prompt, adequate and effective compensation. Such compensation shall amount to the market value of the investment expropriated immediately before the expropriation itself or before there was an official Government announcement that expropriation would be effected in the future, whichever is the earlier, shall be made without delay, be effectively realizable and be freely transferable. The national or company affect shall have a right, under the law of the Contracting Party making the expropriation, to prompt review, by a judicial or other independent authority of that Party, of whether the expropriation is in conformity with domestic law and of the valuation of his or its investment in accordance with the principles set out in this paragraph.\"\n\nCompensation must be, first, \"prompt, adequate and effective\" and, second \"compensation shall amount to the market value of the investment expropriated immediately before the expropriation itself.\" Although not referring to interest, the provision must be read as including a determination of interest that is compatible with those two principles. In particular, the compensation must not be eroded by the passage of time or by the diminution in the market value. The award of interest that reflects such international business practices meets these two objectives.\n\n53.\n\nThe option the Tribunal took was in the view of this Committee within the Tribunal's power. International law and ICSID practice, unlike the Egyptian Civil Code, offer a variety of alternatives that are compatible with those objectives. These alternatives include the compounding of interest in some cases.21 Whether among the many alternatives available under such practice the Tribunal chose the most appropriate in the circumstances of the case is not for this Committee to say as such matter belongs to the merits of the decision. Moreover, this is a discretionary decision of the Tribunal. Even if it were established that the Tribunal did not rely on the appropriate criteria this in itself would not amount to a manifest excess of power leading to annulment.\n\n*Atlantic Triton* v. *Guinea,* Award of 21 April 1986, 3 *ICSID Reports* 17, at 33, 43; *Compania del Desarrollo de Santa Elena S. A. v. Republic of Costa Rica,* Award of 17 February 2000, 15 *ICSID Review \u2014 Foreign Investment Law Journal* 169, at 200-202 (2000) (paras. 96-107); *Emilio Augustin Majfezini* v. *The Kingdom of Spain,* Award, 13 November 2000, 16 *ICSID Review \u2014 Foreign Investment Law Journal* 248, at 277 (2001) (para. 96).\n\n**B. Did the Tribunal exceed its powers in permitting Wena to assert claims on behalf of other investors?**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n54.\n\nBesides the invocation of excess of power on the ground of the Tribunal failing to apply the proper law, the Applicant has also raised the question that investors other than Wena and not entitled to claim under IPPA were allowed to do so. It is a matter of act and evidence on the origin of the sums invested and the ultimate beneficiary of the sums awarded. In any event, only Wena was found by the Tribunal to be entitled to damages. Moreover, ICSID practice has also been quite flexible on claims that include the interests of subsidiaries and affiliates, including on occasions entities that are nationals of States that are not contracting parties to the Convention.22\n\n*SOABI v. Senegal,* Decision on Jurisdiction, 1 August 1984, 2 *ICSID Reports* 164, at 182-183 (paras. 33-38).\n\n**C. No finding of excess of power**\n------------------------------------\n\n55.\n\nThe Committee must reach the conclusion that excess of power, as a ground for annulment, cannot prevail in the instant case. The request to this effect is therefore dismissed.\n\n**III.** Did the Tribunal seriously depart from a fundamental rule of procedure?\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n56.\n\nThe second ground for annulment, which is based on Article 52(1l)(d) of the ICSID Convention, requires from the Applicant to demonstrate \"that there has been a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure.\" The Applicant has to identify the fundamental rule of procedure from which the Tribunal departed and it has to show that such departure has been serious.\n\n57.\n\nThe said provision refers to a set of minimal standards of procedure to be respected as a matter of international law. It is fundamental, as a matter of procedure, that each party is given the right to be heard before an independent and impartial tribunal. This includes the right to state its claim or its defense and to produce all arguments and evidence in support of it. This fundamental right has to be ensured on an equal level, in a way that allows each party to respond adequately to the arguments and evidence presented by the other. Both Parties accept these basic principles. The Applicant makes an additional reference to \"the application of the burden of proof which it further explains in respect of the specific complaints raised in connection with the ground for annulment of Article 52(1)(d) of the Convention.\n\n58.\n\nIn order to be a\" serious\" departure from a fundamental rule of procedure, the violation of such a rule must have caused the Tribunal to reach a result substantially different from what it would have awarded had such a rule been observed. In the words of the *ad hoc* Committee's Decision in the matter of *MINE,* \"the departure must be substantial and be such as to deprive a party of the benefit or protection which the rule was intended to provide.\"23\n\n4 *ICSID Reports,* at 87 (para. 5.05).\n\n**A. The proof of the consultancy agreement with Mr. Kandil**\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n59.\n\nThe Applicant contends that the Tribunal stated wrongly that the existence of a consultancy agreement between Wena and Mr. Kandil as \"undisputed.\" It recalls that it did dispute that a document containing such agreement was ever signed by Mr. Kandil. In the Applicant's view, the Tribunal, in so doing, committed an erroneous reversal of the burden of proof, because the burden of proving the existence of such an agreement should have shifted to Wena.\n\n60.\n\nThe Applicant does not identify the rule on burden of proof on which it is relying upon. It is not disputed that payments were made by Wena to Mr. Kandil in return for services to be provided by Mr. Kandil to Wena. The Applicant's objection is therefore limited to the question whether such agreement was confirmed in writing. This is a purely factual issue which is irrelevant as a matter of minimal standard of procedure.\n\n61.\n\nMoreover, the Applicant does not show the impact that this issue may have had on the Award nor does it demonstrate why, and in respect of which fundamental rule of procedure, the burden of proof would have shifted from Egypt to Wena, although Wena admitted the existence of a consultancy agreement with Mr. Kandil. To the extent the Applicant's objection refers to the content of such agreement and to the alleged improper influence exercised by Wena on Mr. Kandil, the Tribunal stated in its Award that the burden of proving corruption was on Egypt and that Egypt had failed to prove its allegations in this respect (paras. 77, 117). The Applicant's disagreement with this conclusion does not show any departure from a fundamental rule of procedure.\n\n**B. The assessment of damages**\n--------------------------------\n\n62.\n\nThe Applicant argues that Wena at no time supplied any evidence of the sums it claimed it had invested in the hotels nor gave any evidence as to the losses it claimed to have suffered. The Application does not identify the fundamental rules of procedure it claims were violated with any more precision than merely requiring Wena to discharge its burden of proof.\n\n63.\n\nThe Award shows that the Tribunal considered Wena to be in charge of proving its losses. When determining the damages owed to Wena, the Award refers to the Claimant's statement on its actual investment in the two hotels (paras. 120, 124,125,127). It indicates that the Tribunal accepted, in part, objections raised by Egypt that there were certain elements of double counting, leaving as a total an amount \"which the Tribunal judges to be the approximate total for Wena's investment\" (para. 127), from which it further deducted the amount already received by Wena as a result of the arbitration award rendered in respect of the Nile Hotel.\n\n64.\n\nIn fact, the Applicant's criticism is directed to the Tribunal's judgment on the pertinence of factual statements presented by Wena in order to prove the losses it claimed to have suffered. The question could be raised whether this objection is not a matter of substance, rather than a procedural issue, as referred to in Article 52(1)(d) of the Convention. The law applicable to the allocation of damages, as designated pursuant to Article 42(1) of the Convention, may indeed contain rules about the method to be applied to the assessment of damages.\n\n65.\n\nHowever, irrespective whether the matter is one of substance or procedure, it is in the Tribunal's discretion to make its opinion about the relevance and evaluation of the elements of proof presented by each Party. Arbitration Rule 34(1) recalls that the Tribunal is the judge of the probative value of the evidence produced. The record also shows that account had to be taken of the loss of part of Wena's financial documentation as a result of the events of April 1, 1991. The Applicant does not show in what respect the Tribunal would have manifestly exceeded its discretion in assessing damages. Its complaint in this respect has therefore to be rejected by this Committee.\n\n**C. The assessment of interest**\n---------------------------------\n\n66.\n\nThe Applicant submits that it was not offered the opportunity to address the issue of the appropriate rule of interest and thus it was deprived of its right to be heard.\n\n67.\n\nThe record shows, however, that Wena requested on various occasions, and in particular in the relief claimed in its memorials, an award of interest at an appropriate rate, from April 1, 1991 until the date of effective payment. The record also shows that the Applicant was invited to reply to Wena's claims and arguments, thus including the matter of interest.\n\n68.\n\nThe question raised appears to be rather whether the Applicant's objection is pertinent in respect of the award of compound interest, which was not specifically claimed by Wena nor addressed by the Applicant and, to the Committee's knowledge, not discussed at the hearings before the Tribunal.\n\n69.\n\nBoth Parties took very broad and undetermined positions in respect of the fixing of interest, basically calling for the fixing of \"appropriate\" interest. Both Parties admit that the allocation of compound interest is, albeit not dominant, at least one of the methods followed by international tribunals. Therefore, both parties must have been aware of the possibility that the Tribunal, referring to international practice, might consider compound interest as \"appropriate\" in the particular case.24\n\n*See also* in this respect the remarks of *Klockner I,* 2 *ICSID Reports,* at 129 (para. 91): \"Within the dispute's 'legal framework,' arbitrators must be free to rely on arguments which strike them as the best ones, even if those arguments were not developed by the parties (although they could have been). Even if it is generally desirable for arbitrators to avoid basing their decision on an argument that has not been discussed by the parties, it obviously does not follow that they therefore commit a 'serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure.' Any other solution would expose arbitrators to having to do the work of the parties' counsel for them and would risk slowing down or even paralyzing the arbitral solution to disputes.\"\n\n70.\n\nIn the light of this, the Committee cannot accept the complaint that the Tribunal fixed interest by reference to a method not included in Wena's claim and on which the Applicant would have no opportunity to express its views.\n\n**D. The absence of Mr. Kandil as a witness**\n---------------------------------------------\n\n71.\n\nThe Application further contends that the Tribunal breached a fundamental rule of procedure when not requesting further evidence concerning Mr. Kandil, whom neither Party offered as a witness in the arbitration, and then concluded the issue relating to Mr. Kandil against the Respondent. The Applicant notes that the Tribunal had the power to order further evidence under Arbitration Rules 34(2). In its view, the Tribunal was wrong in not exercising its discretion to call for further evidence, and to decide nevertheless the issue against one of the Parties on the basis of the absence of the evidence it had, in its discretion, decided not to ask for.\n\n72.\n\nIt is true that pursuant to Article 43 of the ICSID Convention and Arbitration Rule 34(2), the Tribunal has the discretionary power to call upon the parties to produce further evidence. The principle underlying this possibility is, however, that it is incumbent to the parties to produce the evidence they wish to present or they intend to request the Tribunal to call for. Under the heading \"Marshalling of Evidence,\" this principle is embodied in Arbitration Rule 33.\n\n73.\n\nThe Applicant tries to turn the discretionary nature of the rules on evidence to their contrary when it asserts the existence of an obligation of the Tribunal to call for evidence on any item critical for the outcome of the dispute. Neither the Convention nor the Arbitration Rules contain any such provision. The Applicant fails to demonstrate the existence of a fundamental rule of procedure which would have put the Tribunal under an obligation to call for further evidence concerning Mr. Kandil. Therefore, the Applicant's complaint must fail also in this respect.\n\n**E. No finding of a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n74.\n\nThe Committee therefore comes to the conclusion that the ground for annulment relating to a serious departure of the Tribunal from a fundamental rule of procedure cannot prevail in the instant case. The request to this effect is therefore dismissed.\n\n**IV.** Does the Award state the reasons on which it is based?\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**A. Preliminary observations**\n-------------------------------\n\n75.\n\nThe third ground for annulment invoked by the Applicant is based on Article 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention. Under this rule, a party may request annulment of the award on the ground \"that the award has failed to state the reasons on which it is based.\" This provision is related to Article 48(3) of the Convention, which states that\"[t]he award shall deal with every question submitted to the Tribunal, and shall state the reasons upon which it is based.\"\n\n76.\n\nThe Applicant identified three distinct matters on which it contends that the Award does not state the reasons on which it based (hereinafter B to D). It further argues that the Tribunal did not deal with some questions submitted for its decision. In this respect, it is argued that the failure to comply with the first part of Article 48(3) of the ICSID Convention amounts to a failure to state reasons within the meaning of Article 52(1)(e). The latter question will be dealt with separately (under E).\n\n77.\n\nBoth Parties, when explaining the meaning and scope of Article 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention, reply on the standard of reasoning laid down by the *ad hoc* Committee in *MINE* as follows:\n\n\".... the requirement to state reasons is satisfied as long as the award enables one to follow how the tribunal proceeded from Point A to Point B, and eventually to its conclusion, even if it made an error of fact or law. The minimum requirement is in particular not satisfied by either contradictory or frivolous reasons.\"25\n\nThe same *ad hoc* Committee also stated that:\n\n\"... the requirement that an award has to be motivated implies that it must enable the reader to follow the reasoning of the Tribunal on points of fact and law. It implies that, and only that. The adequacy of the reasoning is not an appropriate standard of review under paragraph 1(e), because it almost inevitably draws an *ad hoc* Committee into an examination of the substance of the tribunal's decision, in disregard of the exclusion of the remedy of appeal by Article 53 of the Convention.\"26\n\n*MINE,* 4 *ICSID Reports,* at 88 (para. 5.09)\n\n*MINE,* 4 *ICSID Reports,* at 88 (para. 5.08).\n\n78.\n\nOther *ad hoc* Committees have used similar language, referring to reasons that are \"sufficiently relevant,\" that is, \"reasonably sustainable and capable of providing a basis for the decision,\"27 or demonstrating a \"reasonable connection between the basis invoked by the tribunal and the conclusions reached by it.\"28\n\n*Klockner I,* 2 *ICSID Reports,* at 139 (para. 120).\n\n*Amco I,* 1 *ICSID Reports,* at 520 (para. 43).\n\n79.\n\nThe ground for annulment of Article 52(1)(e) does not allow any review of the challenged Award which would lead the **ad hoc** Committee to reconsider whether the reasons underlying the Tribunal's decisions were appropriate or not, convincing or not. As stated by the **ad hoc** Committee in *MINE,* this ground for annulment refers to a \"minimum requirement\" only. This requirement is based on the Tribunal's duty to identify, and to let the parties know, the factual and legal premises leading the Tribunal to its decision. If such sequence of reasons has been given by the Tribunal, there is no room left for a request for annulment under Article 52(1)(e).\n\n80.\n\nAny other than a limited scope given to this ground for annulment would cause some confusion with other remedies provided by the Convention. Indeed, when the reasons stated in the award give rise to doubts about its meaning, either party may request interpretation of the award under Article 50. In the case where the Tribunal omitted to decide on a question or where the award contains an error, either party may request the award be rectified, according Article 49(2). These remedies confirm the understanding that any challenge as to the substance of reasons given in the award cannot be retained as a ground for annulment under Article 52(1)(e).\n\n81.\n\nNeither Article 48(3) nor Article 52(1)(e) specify the manner in which the Tribunal's reasons are to be stated. The object of both provisions is to ensure that the Parties will be able to understand the Tribunal's reasoning. This goal does not require that each reason be stated expressly. The Tribunal's reasons may be implicit in the considerations and conclusions contained in the award, provided they can be reasonably inferred from the terms used in the decision.\n\n82.\n\nThe Tribunal's duty to state the reasons supporting its conclusions has as its basis the statements on facts and law, together with all the evidence adduced, that were before the Tribunal at the latest at the time it declared the proceeding closed pursuant to Arbitration Rule 38. The award cannot be challenged under Article 52(1)(e) for a lack of reasons in respect of allegations and arguments, or parts thereof, that have not been presented during the proceeding before the Tribunal.\n\n83.\n\nIt is in the nature of this ground of annulment that in case the award suffers from a lack of reasons which can be challenged within the meaning and scope of Article 52(1)(e), the remedy need not be the annulment of the award. The purpose of this particular ground for annulment is not to have the award reversed on its merits. It is to allow the parties to understand the Tribunal's decision. If the award does not meet the minimal requirement as to the reasons given by the Tribunal, it does not necessarily need to be resubmitted to a new Tribunal. If the ad *hoc* Committee so concludes, on the basis of the knowledge it has received upon the dispute, the reasons supporting the Tribunal's conclusions can be explained by the *ad hoc* Committee itself.\n\n**B. The Tribunal's determination that it was not necessary to consider EHC's and Wena's respective obligations under the leases**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n84.\n\nIn the first place, the Applicant recalls that it had argued during the arbitral proceedings that Wena had suffered no deprivation as a result of the events of April 1, 1991, as its various defaults under the leases entitled EHC, as of that date, to request the termination of the leases for default. Such termination had subsequently been pronounced by an arbitral tribunal constituted under the Nile Hotel lease. In the Applicant's view, this item is fundamental as Egypt cannot be held liable for having expropriated rights claimed to be attributed to Wena which no longer existed as of the date of April 1, 1991.\n\n85.\n\nThe Applicant states that the Tribunal, while it acknowledged that disputes had arisen between EHC and Wena concerning their respective obligations under the leases, merely noted, in the statement of facts of the Award, that \"in the view which the Tribunal takes of this case it is not necessary at this time to determined the truth of these conflicting allegations. It is sufficient for this proceedings simply to acknowledge, as both parties agree, that there were serious disagreements between Wena and EHC about their respective obligations under the leases\" (para. 19). The Applicant complains in this respect that the Tribunal failed to explain the reasons why it was taking such view, which makes the Award subject to the ground for annulment of Article 52(1)(e).\n\n86.\n\nThe Award states expressly that it is based on Article 2 and 5 of the IPPA and that its object is to resolve a dispute which opposes Wena to Egypt *(see,* in particular, paras. 78, 108, 118). It follows from this position that the Tribunal declared irrelevant to consider the rights and obligations of the parties to the leases for the purpose of reaching a decision on the dispute submitted to it. The Award confirms that Wena had been expropriated and lost its investment, and this irrespective of the particular contractual relationship between Wena and EHC. The explanation thus given for not determining the respective obligations of Wena and EHC under the leases is sufficient to understand the premises on which the Tribunal's decision is based in this respect.\n\n**C. The Tribunal's determination of the amount awarded to Wena**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n87.\n\nSecondly, the Applicant complains that, on the face of the Award, it cannot understand the legal basis on which Wena's claim for payment of damages has been made and how it has been quantified.\n\n88.\n\nWith respect to the first item, the Award states that the allocation of damages is based on the standard set forth in Article 5(1) of the IPPA (para. 118), which is declared to be the primary source of applicable law (para. 78). Article 5(1) of the IPPA sets out the legal basis for damages to be paid to the investor in case of expropriation, and it identifies such damages by using the fundamental notion of \"prompt, adequate and effective compensation.\" Therefore, this Committee cannot accept the Applicant's objection that the Award, when referring explicitly to Article 5 of the IPPA, did not state the legal basis on which Wena's claim for payment of damages has been awarded.\n\n89.\n\nThe same holds true in respect of the Applicant's various statements about the Tribunal's finding on expropriation not conforming to Egyptian law or other standards. The finding of the Tribunal on this matter is based on Article 5 of the IPPA which, as discussed further above, applies international law standards. It follows that both the meaning of expropriation and the compensation for damages in the event of it happening are determined by the same source of law. The reasoning for it all becomes clear in the Award when invoking this Article.\n\n90.\n\nThe Applicant further contends that the Award does not explain the way in which the Tribunal has quantified the damages awarded to Wena.\n\n91.\n\nWith respect to determination of the quantum of damages awarded, it may be recalled that the notion of \"prompt, adequate and effective compensation\" confers to the Tribunal a certain margin of discretion, within which, by its nature, few reasons more than a reference to the Tribunal's estimation can be given, together with statements on the relevance and the evaluation of the supporting evidence.\n\n92.\n\nIn this regard, the Tribunal declared in its Award at the outset that Wena's claims for lost profits, lost opportunities and reinstatement costs were inappropriate because they were too speculative (paras. 122-124). It decided therefore to calculate \"the market value of the investment expropriated immediately before the expropriation\" under Article 5 of the IPPA by reference to Wena's actual investments in the two hotels (para. 125). The Award further explains that the panel accepted the amount stated by Claimant as its loss as gross figure, from which it deducted an amount corresponding to probable double counting (para. 127). The Award also states that the Tribunal was not persuaded by Respondent's evidence that there were significant other instances of double counting (para. 127). In respect of the alleged investment by Wena's affiliates, the tribunal declared not to be persuaded by Egypt's contention that much of the investment came from affiliates of Wena rather than from Wena and that as long as those investments went into the Nile and Luxor hotels venture, they should be recognized as appropriate investments (para. 126). The reasons given thus allow to understand that the Tribunal accepted Wena's evidence on the losses it claimed to have suffered, to the exception of a correction related to possible double counting.\n\n93.\n\nWith respect to any further reasons supporting the Tribunal's determination of the amount awarded to Wena, the appropriate information is contained in Wena's documentary evidence. The reasons relevant for the Tribunal's findings are thus stated implicitly by reference to such documentation. The ground for annulment of Article 52(1)(e) does not allow to argue further that the Tribunal evaluated erroneously the evidence submitted by Claimant and thus decided without stating sufficient reasons. This Committee therefore concludes that the quantification of the damages awarded to Wena cannot be challenged for a failure to state reasons in the Award.\n\n**D. The Tribunal's determination of the interest awarded**\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n94.\n\nIn the third place, the Applicant complains that the Tribunal failed to give reasons for its decision to adopt a rate of interest at 9% and for its determination of the date from which interest accrues.\n\n95.\n\nWhen fixing the rate of interest at 9%, the Award specifies that this rate was 1% below long term government bonds in Egypt (para. 128, note 289). The Applicant's view is that such reasoning is not sufficient and does not meet the requirement of \"reasons stated\" under Article 52(1)(e).\n\n96.\n\nAs an extended practice shows, international tribunals and arbitration panels usually dispose of a large margin of discretion when fixing interest. It is normal, therefore, that very limited reasons are given for a decision which is left almost entirely to the discretion of the tribunal. When fixing a rate of interest 1% below long term government bonds in Egypt, the Tribunal concluded that Wena should be granted interest close to but still below such bonds. It must be assumed that it took such decision in order to award damages corresponding to an \"adequate and effective compensation\" as provided for in Article 5 of the IPPA. The reasons underlying the Tribunal's decision in this respect are thus stated sufficiently.\n\n97.\n\nThe requirement to state the reasons supporting the allocation of interests appears particularly weak when, like in these proceedings, as mentioned in paragraph 69 above, both Parties were not more determinative than referring to the allocation of appropriate interest, thus conferring to the Tribunal a wide discretionary power to assess interest. Under such circumstances, the Tribunal need not be more explicit than the Parties were in their respective positions taken on this particular matter. In addition, this Committee does not have to entertain arguments and submissions a party has not developed before the Tribunal.\n\n98.\n\nThe Applicant further objects that the Award does not allow to know the date from which interest accrues (the *\"dies a quo\").* It is true that no such date is specified expressly in the Tribunal's decision. The Applicant accepts that such date might be determined by an appropriate mathematical calculation, based on the total amount of accrued interest and the interest rate awarded. The Applicant did not undertake any such calculation, nor did it demonstrate that the Tribunal had chosen a wrong **\"dies a quo.\"** In the light of such a lack of support given to the Applicant's own contention, this Committee need not inquire on its own initiative whether the Tribunal's calculation is based on April 1.1991 as the *\"dies a quo,\"* as this appears implicitly from the Tribunal's statement with respect to the day when the expropriation of Wena's rights occurred. Although this is outside the scope of examination as required in a proceeding under Article 52(1), the Committee has anyhow made its own calculation. In this respect, the Committee concludes that, when taking into account the payment of the amount awarded in the Nile Hotel arbitration on June 14, 1997 and the amounts respectively owed to Wena, before and after this date, together with the respective amounts of interest accrued as stated in the Award, the resulting amount is very close to the total amount as set forth in the Award. The Committee is satisfied that April 1, 1991 is discernible from the Award as the **\"dies a quo.\"**\n\n99.\n\nThe Applicant further argues that if the relevant date would appear to be April 1, 1991, it would be wrong, because a substantial portion of Wena's investment had been invested long after that date. This argument cannot be heard as a ground for annulment based on Article 52(1)(e) because it invites this Committee to proceed to a reexamination of the merits of the Award.\n\n**E. Did the Tribunal not deal with questions submitted for its decision?**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n100.\n\nArticle 48(3) of the Convention, quoted above, makes a distinction between the Tribunal's duty to deal with every question submitted to it, and the requirement that the award shall state the reasons upon which it is based. The ground for annulment of Article 52(1)(e) only refers to the latter element. In case a Tribunal had omitted to decide a question in the award, a party may request the Tribunal to decide such question, in an additional proceeding pursuant to Article 49(2) which is distinct from an annulment proceeding under Article 52.\n\n101.\n\nHowever, the remedy provided for in Article 49(2) is not always sufficient in such a case, as other *ad hoc* Committees have pointed out.29 Indeed, the answer to the question the Tribunal omitted to decide may have direct or collateral effects upon the arguments which are at the basis of the Tribunal's conclusions. A proceeding under Article 49(2) would not allow the Tribunal to go further than to decide upon the question it had omitted to deal with. It is not a sufficient remedy when such a decision may affect the sequence of arguments contained in the Award and require that it be reconsidered in the light of the Tribunal's decision on the omitted question. The ground for annulment under Article 52(1)(e) includes therefore the case where the Tribunal omitted to decide upon a question submitted to it to the extent such supplemental decision may affect the reasoning supporting the Award.\n\n*See MINE,* 4 **ICSID Reports,** at 88/89 (paras. 5.11-5.13), 107 (para. 6,101); *Amco I,* 1 **ICSID Reports,** at 517-519 (paras. 32-36).\n\n102.\n\nThe Applicant argues in this respect that the relationship between Wena and Mr. Kandil rendered the lease agreements null and void, irrespective of the purpose of the alleged consultancy agreement between Wena and Mr. Kandil. In the Applicant's view, the Tribunal failed to deal with this argument.\n\n103.\n\nThe Tribunal explained in its Award that in the light of the fact that Mr. Kandil had not been prosecuted and, on the basis of the evidence before the tribunal, had not been subject to investigation by the Egyptian authorities, it could not share Egypt's view that the agreement with Mr. Kandil was illegal under Egyptian law (para. 116) and that Egypt failed to present any evidence that would refute Wena's evidence that the contract was a legitimate agreement (para. 117). The Applicant's object is directed, therefore, not to any failure to state reasons, but to the merits of the reasons given by the Tribunal. As has been explained, such argument cannot be heard by this Committee in respect of the ground for annulment stated in Article 52(1)(e).\n\n104.\n\nThe Applicant further argues that the Award deals exclusively with the issue raised as to an alleged case of corruption, but that the Tribunal failed to consider that the lease agreements were null and void for another reason. This reason is, according to the Applicant, a conflict of interest in the person of Mr. Kandil who was a consultant to Wena while he acted also as Chairman of EHC, and which Mr. Kandil allegedly did not declare to EHC's board of directors as required by Article 97 of the Egyptian Companies Law No. 159/1981.\n\n105.\n\nThe Applicant has not demonstrated to this Committee that the alleged failure of the Tribunal to consider the argument of nullity of the lease agreements based on a conflict of interest in the person of Mr. Kandil, as an argument separate from alleged nullity based on corruption, would have resulted in affecting Wena's right to protection of its investment under the IPPA. Hence, the Applicant did not show that the lack of a decision on the question it has raised would have any effect on the result of the Award, which is a prerequisite to entertain a request based on Article 52(1)(e) complaining that the Tribunal omitted to deal with a question submitted to it.\n\n106.\n\nWhen leaving the latter consideration aside, this Committee observes that the Tribunal did not address in as much express terms the argument based on an alleged conflict of interest than it dealt with the question whether improper influence had been exercised on Mr. Kandil. The said argument is, however, rejected implicitly in the Award, where it is noted that Egypt failed to present \"any evidence\" which would have led to think that the agreement was not legitimate, and that neither party offered to present live testimony from Mr. Kandil (para. 117). The Award also accepts Wena's contention that \"the agreement did not concern the Nile and Luxor hotels, but was to help Wena to pursue development opportunities in Misr Aswan, where Mr. Kandil was a tourist consultant (para. 114). Thus, the Award denies the existence of a factual situation which might have implied that Mr. Kandil's interests in the tourist development in Misr Aswan would conflict with the interests of EHC in the conclusion of the lease agreements in respect of the Nile and Luxor hotels. Therefore, the Applicant's complaint must fail.\n\n107.\n\nThe Applicant further contends that the Tribunal failed to consider and give effect to the Nile arbitral award which definitively settled the rights and obligations of Wena in respect of the Nile Hotel and thus had an immediate effect on Wena's purported rights which the Award declared to have been subject of an expropriation. The Applicant believes that its contentions in this regard, irrespective whether they were right or wrong, still need to be addressed, because they concerned the very nature and extent of the rights that Wena claimed had been expropriated.\n\n108.\n\nAs has been mentioned before, the Tribunal took another view. It concluded that the rights and obligations between Wena and EHC under the lease agreements were not relevant to determine the relationship between Wena and Egypt under the IPPA. The Award did however take account of the damages awarded to Wena in the Nile Hotel award, the respect amount being deducted from the damages claimed by Wena (para. 127). Therefore, reasons were given in the Award to dispose of the Applicant's submission in this respect.\n\n109.\n\nThe Applicant moreover objects that the Tribunal did not address the fact that Wena still owned, possessed and operated the Luxor Hotel for over five years after the hotel had been returned to it in 1992 and that, in fact, Wena still remained the lessee of that property. The Applicant states that, as a matter of Egyptian law, the receivership ordered in 1997 was in the nature of a conservatory measure, which did not affect Wena's continuing rights under the Luxor lease.\n\n110.\n\nThe Award states as a matter of fact (para. 62) that on 14 August 1997, Wena was evicted from the Luxor Hotel and, according to a witness, the hotel was turned over to a court-appointed receiver requested by EHC. The Tribunal further stated that Egypt took no immediate action to restore the hotels to Wena (paras. 84 and 85) and to protect Wena's investments after EHC had illegally seized the hotels (para. 88), that neither hotel was restored to Wena until nearly a year after the events of April 1.1991 (para. 91), nor was it returned to Wena in the same operating conditions that it had been in before the seizures (para. 92). This is amble explanation for the Tribunal's conclusion that the fact of the lease concerning the Luxor Hotel remaining in force, had not the effect of removing Egypt's liability as a consequence of the violation of its obligation to ensure Wena's investment \"fair and equitable treatment\" and \"full protection and security\" under Article 2(2) of the IPPA. Hence, the respective part of the Award cannot be challenged for any lack of reasons given by the Tribunal.\n\n**F. No finding of lack of reasons**\n------------------------------------\n\n111.\n\nThis Committee therefore concludes that the objections raised by the Applicant under Article 52(1)(e) of the Convention, to the extent that they are admissible for the Committee's consideration, are not founded and must be rejected.\n\n**V.** Costs\n------------\n\n112.\n\nIn the light of the importance of the arguments advanced by the Parties in connection with this case, the Committee considers it appropriate that each Party bear its own litigation costs with respect to this annulment proceeding, and that the Parties bear equally all expenses incurred by the Centre in connection with such proceeding.\n\n**VI. DECISION**\n----------------\n\n113.\n\nBased on the foregoing, the Committee rejects in its entirety the Application for annulment of the Arbitral Award rendered on December 8, 2000.\n\n114.\n\nIndependently of the above decision on the Application for annulment the Committee decides as follows the question of the allocation of costs in this proceeding:\n\n(a) Each Party shall bear its own expenses, including legal fees, incurred in connection with this annulment proceeding.\n\n(b) Each Party shall bear one half of the costs incurred by the Centre in connection with this proceeding, including the fees and expenses of the members of the Committee; and,\n\n(c) Accordingly, Wena Hotels Limited shall reimburse the Arab Republic of Egypt one half of the total costs incurred by the Centre in connection with this annulment proceeding once the amount has been determined by the Secretariat of the Centre."}, {"Title": "Decision on the Application by Wena Hotels Ltd. for Interpretation of the Arbitral Award", "Type": "Interpretation", "Date": "2005-10-31T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Decision on the Application by Wena Hotels Ltd. for Interpretation of the Arbitral Award\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**I. THE PROCEEDINGS**\n----------------------\n\n**A. Introduction**\n-------------------\n\n1.\n\nThe present interpretation proceedings were initiated on June 29, 2004, when Wena Hotels Limited (\"**Wena**\")1 filed with the Secretary-General of the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (\"**ICSID**\") an application for interpretation (the \"**Application**\") under Article 50 of the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States (the \"**Convention**\" or the \"**ICSID Convention**\") of an arbitral award2 rendered on December 8, 2000 (the \"**Award**\") in the arbitration proceedings between Wena and the Arab Republic of Egypt (\"**Egypt**\"), ICSID Case No. ARB/98/4.\n\nWena Hotels Limited is a British company incorporated in 1982 under the laws of England and Wales. Note, in referencing the documentary annexes submitted by the parties, the notation \"W\" indicates a document submitted by Claimant, Wena Hotels Limited. The notation \"E\" indicates a document submitted by Respondent, the Arab Republic of Egypt.\n\nApplication, Annex 1.\n\n2.\n\nThe Award was the result of an ICSID arbitration proceeding initiated by Wena on July 10, 1998 against Egypt (the \"**Original Arbitration**\"). The dispute related to the seizure by Egyptian officials of the Nile Hotel in Cairo and the Luxor Hotel (collectively, the \"**Hotels**\") in Luxor on April 1, 1991. The Hotels were operated by Wena under two lease and development agreements that it had entered into in 1989 and 1990, respectively, with the Hotels\u2019 owner, the Egyptian Hotels Company (\"**EHC**\"). EHC was a \"public\" sector company wholly owned by the Egyptian government.3\n\nAward, Section 65.\n\n3.\n\nIn said proceedings, Wena sought damages for Egypt\u2019s alleged violation of the Agreement for the Promotion and Protection of Investments between the United Kingdom and Egypt dated June 11, 1975 (the \"**IPPA**\").\n\n4.\n\nOn December 8, 2000, the Secretary-General dispatched to the parties certified copies of the Award by the original Tribunal composed of Prof. Ibrahim Fadlallah and Prof. Don Wallace as Arbitrators and Mr. Monroe Leigh as President of the Tribunal (the \"**Original Tribunal**\"). The operative section of the Award reads as follows:\n\n*\"The TRIBUNAL, unanimously,*\n\n*134. FINDS that Egypt breached its obligations to Wena by failing to accord Wena\u2019s investments in Egypt fair and equitable treatment and full protection and security in violation of Article 2(2) of the IPPA;*\n\n*135. FINDS that Egypt\u2019s actions amounted to an expropriation without prompt, adequate and effective compensation in violation of Article 5 of the IPPA;*\n\n*and*\n\n*136. AWARDS to Wena US$20,600,986.43 in damages, interest, attorneys fees and expenses. This award will be payable by Egypt within 30 days from the date of this Award. Thereafter, it will accumulate additional interest at 9% compounded quarterly until paid.\"*\n\n5.\n\nOn January 19, 2001, Egypt filed an Application for Annulment of the Award (the \"**Application for Annulment\"**) under Article 52 of the ICSID Convention. The *ad hoc* committee (\"**Committee**\") appointed by the Chairman of the ICSID Administrative Council to consider Egypt\u2019s Application for Annulment rejected this Application for Annulment \"*in its entirety*\" in its Decision of February 5, 2002 (the \"**Annulment Decision**\").4\n\n*See* copy of the Decision of the *ad hoc* committee dated February 5, 2002, attached to the Application as Annex 2.\n\n**B. The Application for Interpretation**\n-----------------------------------------\n\n6.\n\nThe Application was filed by Wena against Egypt, stating that a dispute has arisen between Wena and Egypt concerning the meaning of the Award. Wena asserts that despite the Award\u2019s conclusion that Egypt expropriated Wena from the Nile and Luxor Hotel lease and development agreements (the \"**Nile Lease**\" and the \"**Luxor Lease**\", respectively; collectively, the \"**Hotel Leases\"**) in 1991, recent legal actions of Egypt and its constituent entities against Wena raise important questions about the Award\u2019s finding that Egypt expropriated Wena\u2019s interests in the Luxor Lease (*see* in detail Section 18 *et seq*. below).\n\n7.\n\nWena thus seeks an interpretation of the meaning of this ruling.5 The Acting Secretary-General registered the Application on 15 July 2004.\n\nFor the relief sought, *see* Section 33 below.\n\n**C. The Constitution of the Arbitral Tribunal**\n------------------------------------------------\n\n8.\n\nAs the Arbitral Tribunal could not be reconstituted in accordance with Article 51(2) of the ICSID Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings (the \"**ICSID Arbitration Rules**\"), the Secretary-General, in accordance with Article 51(3) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules, notified the parties thereof and invited them to proceed, as soon as possible, to constitute a new Tribunal (the \"**Tribunal**\"), including the same number of arbitrators, and appointed by the same method, as the original one. Thus, in accordance with Article 37(2)(a) of the ICSID Convention, Wena appointed Prof. Ibrahim Fadlallah, a national of Lebanon, as an Arbitrator. Egypt then appointed Mr. Carl F. Salans, a United States national, as an Arbitrator. After consultation with the parties, the two party-appointed arbitrators appointed Dr. Klaus Sachs, a national of Germany, to be the President of the Tribunal.\n\n9.\n\nHaving received from each arbitrator the acceptance of his appointment, the ICSID informed the parties that the Tribunal was deemed to be constituted and the proceedings were deemed to have begun on November 11, 2004. The parties subsequently agreed that the Tribunal has been properly constituted under the provisions of the ICSID Convention.\n\n**D. The Proceedings before the Tribunal**\n------------------------------------------\n\n10.\n\nThe Tribunal held its first session, at the offices of the World Bank in Paris, on January 12, 2005. During this first session, the parties and the Tribunal agreed, *inter alia,* on the filing dates of the respective submissions, as set out below, and on the hearing date for oral arguments of the case to be held on June 14, 2005.\n\n11.\n\nOn February 28, 2005, Egypt submitted its Response to Wena\u2019s Application for Interpretation and requested that the Tribunal reject the Application.6\n\nThe reasons for Egypt\u2019s request to reject the Application will be explained in Section 35 *et seq*. below.\n\n12.\n\nOn March 31, 2005, Wena submitted its Reply.\n\n13.\n\nOn April 29, 2005, Egypt submitted its Rejoinder.\n\n14.\n\nThe Tribunal heard the parties\u2019 oral arguments at the hearing of June 14, 2005, at the offices of the World Bank in Paris. Upon question by the Tribunal, the parties declared that they did not wish to file post-hearing briefs.7\n\n*See* Transcript, p. 108, lines 20 *et seq*.\n\n15.\n\nAs instructed by the Tribunal, on June 30, 2005, the parties submitted their respective statements of legal costs. In its brief, counsel for Wena stated that the costs incurred by Wena in connection with these proceedings amount to a total of US$ 335,180.70 (US$ 57,000.00 for fees and expenses of the arbitrators and ICSID; US$ 253,761.70 for outside legal advisory costs and US$ 24,419.00 for internal expenses of Wena). According to counsel for Egypt, the costs incurred by Egypt in these proceedings amount to a total of US$ 97,916.42 plus EGP 47,314 (US$ 50,000.00 for fees and expenses of the arbitrators and ICSID; US$ 40,916.42 for legal and other costs and US$ 7,000.00 plus EGP 47,314 for out-of-pocket expenses).\n\n16.\n\nOn July 11, 2005, the Secretary of the Tribunal issued a letter, advising the parties of the closure of the proceedings as of July 1, 2005, pursuant to Article 38(1) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules.\n\n**II. THE PARTIES\u2019 POSITIONS**\n------------------------------\n\n**A. Wena\u2019s Position as Set Out in the Application**\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n**1. Introduction**\n-------------------\n\n17.\n\nIn the Application Wena asserts that a dispute has arisen between Wena and Egypt concerning the meaning of the Award. Wena alleges that despite the Award\u2019s findings that Egypt expropriated Wena\u2019s interests in the Hotel Leases in 1991 - and notwithstanding Egypt\u2019s failed attempt to annul the Award - Egypt and its constituent entities have commenced and continued a variety of actions, including legal actions, against Wena that are based on the notion that Wena maintained an interest in the Luxor Lease after its interests in that Lease were expropriated by Egypt.\n\n**2. Egypt\u2019s Actions against Wena**\n-----------------------------------\n\n18.\n\nWena maintains that Egypt, after the rejection of its Application for Annulment, embarked upon a campaign to further discredit Wena in the marketplace.\n\n19.\n\nWena alleges that, as a part of this campaign, various official websites of the Egyptian Government appear to be promoting the Luxor Hotel under the brand name \"Luxor Wena Hotel\" that was used prior to its expropriation by Egypt. According to Wena, these sites seem to indicate that Egypt considers that Wena\u2019s rights in the Luxor Lease have not been expropriated. Furthermore, Wena contends that one of the sites misleadingly states that \"Wena Hotel Ltd.\" remains the Luxor Hotel\u2019s operator.8\n\n*See* Application, Annex 3.\n\n20.\n\nWena also states that shortly after the Annulment Decision, the Egyptian General Company for Tourism and Hotels (\"**EGOTH**\", which is the successor to the EHC), a company wholly owned and controlled by the Egyptian State, filed suit against Wena in the Cairo Southern Court for Urgent Matters to collect over US$ 7.1 million from Wena. EGOTH alleged in these proceedings that Wena owed the sum of US$ 7.1 million as rent under the Luxor Lease for the period from November 15, 1990, through March 31, 2003. Wena states that after this suit was dismissed on March 28, 2002, EGOTH, on April 7, 2002, filed a second identical action with the same court, which was dismissed on procedural grounds on April 24, 2003.9 Wena asserts that in seeking rent from November 1990 through March 2003, EGOTH overlooked the Original Tribunal\u2019s determination that Egypt had expropriated Wena\u2019s interests in the Luxor Hotel on April 1, 1991.\n\n*See* copy of the second decision and its translation attached to the Application as Annex 5.\n\n21.\n\nFurthermore, according to Wena, on September 17, 2002, EGOTH served Wena with a request for arbitration under Article XVIII of the Luxor Lease (the \"**Request for Arbitration**\"), in which EGOTH claims the sum of US$ 3,532,791.67 for rent allegedly due by Wena under the Luxor Lease for the period from November 15, 1990 through August 14, 1997,10 as well as the amount of EGP 1,057,789.10 for costs allegedly due to EGOTH as a result of a domestic arbitration between EHC and Wena conducted in 1990 under the Luxor Lease.\n\n*See* copy of the Request for Arbitration and its translation attached to the Application as Annex 8.\n\n22.\n\nWena maintains that in substance, the Request for Arbitration only differs from the lawsuits referred to above (*see* Section 21 above) in that it seeks to recover rent for a shorter period of time (through August 1997, rather than through March 2003). Wena takes the view that since the Award determined that Wena\u2019s rights in the Luxor Hotel were unlawfully expropriated by Egypt on April 1, 1991, EGOTH is once again primarily seeking rent for a period of time after the date on which, according to the Original Tribunal, Egypt expropriated the Luxor Hotel.\n\n23.\n\nWena states that its counsel addressed letters, dated September 27, 2002, to EGOTH and the Egyptian State Lawsuits Authority, stating that EGOTH cannot claim rent allegedly due for a hotel that had been expropriated by the Egyptian State.11 In a fax dated September 30, 2002,12 Counsellor Osama A. Mahmoud, Vice President of the Egyptian State Lawsuits Authority, stated that EGOTH\u2019s arbitration was based on the Luxor Lease and the 1990 domestic arbitral award. According to Wena, Counsellor Osama A. Mahmoud did not provide any response to the argument that Wena cannot owe rent for property that was expropriated.\n\n*See* copies of the letters dated September 27, 2002, attached to the Application as Annexes 9 and 10.\n\n*See* copy of this letter attached to the Application as Annex 11.\n\n24.\n\nWena states that after it had filed an Answer to the Request for Arbitration and appointed an arbitrator, no further actions were taken in these arbitration proceedings. It contends that the proceedings are intentionally being left to languish by EGOTH, since this state of affairs allegedly enables Egyptian officials to characterize Wena as a company with ongoing legal problems in Egypt.\n\n25.\n\nWena furthermore relies on the ongoing sequestration of the Luxor Hotel, which, at the request of EHC, was taken over on August 14, 1997, by a court-appointed sequestrator. According to Wena, the sequestration has been kept in place until now, notwithstanding the Award\u2019s subsequent determination that Egypt had expropriated Wena\u2019s rights in the Luxor Lease in 1991 and an Egyptian appellate court order that the sequestration be stayed.13 Wena maintains that the only purpose of this ongoing sequestration is to provide Egypt with an additional basis to assert that Wena is a company with \"*unresolved legal issues*.\" According to Wena, it has no remaining liabilities with respect to the Luxor Lease, because its property rights in the Lease were expropriated in 1991, while Egypt\u2019s continuation of the sequestration suggests that Wena retains some outstanding, overdue debt on the Luxor Lease, for which a sequestrator is needed to collect rent on behalf of the property owner. In addition to stating that the sequestration suggests that Wena is a lessee or debtor that cannot be trusted, Wena alleges that the manner in which the sequestrator, Ms. Galila Amin Mohamed Al Shorbagi, is carrying out her mission has made it impossible for Wena to properly defend itself in the court and arbitration proceedings instigated by EGOTH.14\n\n*See* Application, Section 33 and its footnote 7.\n\n*Id.,* Section 35 and its footnote 8.\n\n**3. The Impact of Egypt\u2019s Actions on Wena**\n--------------------------------------------\n\n26.\n\nWena submits that Egypt\u2019s actions through its constituent entities have enabled Egypt to portray Wena as a company with \"*ongoing legal problems*\" in Egypt, and that this has a very real and serious impact upon Wena. Wena maintains that over the past two years, it has had a number of prospective projects in other countries fail once investors realised that Wena has \"*outstanding legal disputes*\" with Egypt.15 Wena contends that in a number of these cases, the investors did not merely come upon such information of their own accord, but rather that Egyptian officials directly informed them of Wena\u2019s \"*ongoing legal problems*\" in Egypt. As an example of \"*Egypt\u2019s sinister conduct*\", Wena refers to an article published on November 4, 2002, a few weeks before EGOTH\u2019s second law suit was dismissed, in the state-run *Al-Ahram* newspaper under the headline *\"Egyptian General Hotels Sues \u2018English Wena\u2019 for 72 Million Dollars.\"*\n\n*Id*., Sections 37 to 39 and the attached Annexes 15 to 18.\n\n**4. Wena\u2019s Legal Position**\n----------------------------\n\n27.\n\nWena claims that under Article 50(1) of the ICSID Convention, it is entitled to seek an interpretation of the Award\u2019s ruling that Egypt expropriated Wena\u2019s interests in the Hotel Leases. According to Wena, the \"precise points in dispute\" between the parties, within the meaning of Article 50(1)(c)(i) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules, with respect to the Award, are the following:\n\n28.\n\nWena states that, in its Award of December 8, 2000, the Original Tribunal found that officials of EHC had seized the Nile and Luxor Hotels by force on the evening of April 1, 1991.16 Wena further submits that the Original Tribunal also found that EHC, today succeeded by EGOTH, was wholly owned and controlled by the Egyptian government, in particular, its Ministry of Tourism, and that Egypt was aware of EHC\u2019s intention to seize the Hotels, yet took no action to prevent the seizures. Furthermore, the Original Tribunal found that Egypt failed to immediately return the Hotels to Wena or to punish EHC for its actions.17 Wena states that the Original Tribunal further noted that the Luxor Hotel was eventually returned to Wena over a year later, on April 28, 1992, but it had been vandalized and was not returned to Wena in the same operating condition as it had been in before the seizure. Wena points out that the Original Tribunal also found that the Ministry of Tourism subsequently denied Wena a permanent operating license for the Luxor Hotel, and that Wena was permanently evicted from the Luxor Hotel on August 14, 1997, when the Luxor Hotel was turned over to the court-appointed receiver requested by EHC.18\n\n*Id*., Section 42.\n\n*Id.,* Section 43.\n\n*Id.,* Section 44.\n\n29.\n\nWena points out that, as a result, the Original Tribunal found Egypt liable for violating both Article 2 and Article 5 of the IPPA and that the Original Tribunal ruled as follows in this regard:\n\n*\"96. The Tribunal also agrees with Wena that Egypt\u2019s actions constitute an**expropriation and one without \"prompt, adequate and effective**compensation\", in violation of Article 5 of the IPPA...*\n\n*99. Here, the Tribunal has no difficulty finding that the actions previously described constitute such an expropriation. Whether or not it authorized or participated in the actual seizures of the Hotels, Egypt deprived Wena of its \u2018fundamental rights of ownership\u2019 by allowing EHC forcibly to seize the Hotels, to possess them illegally for nearly a year, and to return the Hotels stripped of much of their furniture and fixtures...\"19*\n\n*Id.,* Section 45.\n\n30.\n\nWena takes the view that in initiating subsequent actions against Wena on the basis of the monies allegedly owed to Egypt under the Luxor Lease, Egypt overlooks that Wena has been expropriated and deprived of its \"*fundamental rights of ownership*\" in that Lease. Wena points out that the law suits and the domestic arbitration proceeding brought by EGOTH seek to collect rent from Wena under the Luxor Lease for periods of time that almost entirely fall after April 1, 1991, the date the expropriation occurred, and that it is by disregarding the fact that Wena has been expropriated that Egypt can maintain a sequestration whereby Wena is presented as the lessee or the operator of the Luxor Hotel.\n\n31.\n\nWena\u2019s position is that it cannot have any liabilities with respect to property that was expropriated. It further states that the Original Tribunal\u2019s determination that Egypt \"*expropriated*\" Wena\u2019s rights and deprived it of its \"*fundamental rights of ownership*\" entails the necessary consequence that Wena was totally and permanently deprived of its interests in the Luxor Lease as of the time the expropriation occurred.\n\n32.\n\nWena points out that the Award does not expressly state that a party expropriated from a given right cannot incur liability associated with that right. It simply decides that Wena\u2019s interests under the Luxor Lease were expropriated and determines the compensation due to Wena on that basis.20 As a result, Wena claims there is a dispute between the parties as regards the necessary consequences of the Original Tribunal\u2019s determination that Egypt expropriated Wena\u2019s rights in the Luxor Lease.21\n\n*Id.,* Section 48.\n\n*Id.,* Section 49.\n\n**5. The Relief Sought by Wena**\n--------------------------------\n\n33.\n\nIn conclusion, Wena:\n\n*\"(a) respectfully requests an interpretation of the Tribunal\u2019s determination that Egypt expropriated Wena\u2019s rights in the Luxor Lease and deprived Wena of its \"fundamental rights of ownership\". In particular, Wena requests that the interpretation address whether the expropriation constituted a total, permanent deprivation of Wena\u2019s rights in the Luxor Lease, such as to preclude subsequent legal actions by Egypt that presume the contrary.*\n\n*(b) seeks reimbursement of all costs incurred in these proceedings, including but not limited to the fees and expenses of the arbitrators, ICSID, legal counsel and experts.*\n\n*(c) reserves its right to amend this Request for interpretation.\"22*\n\n*Id.,* Sections 50 to 52.\n\n34.\n\nAt the oral hearing, counsel for Wena referred to Section 47 of the Application and stated that Wena also requested the Tribunal to confirm that the expropriation, as determined by the Original Tribunal, occurred as of April 1, 1991.23\n\n*See* Transcript, p. 95, lines 19 to 24.\n\n**B. Egypt\u2019s Position as Set Out in its Response to the Application**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**1. Introduction**\n-------------------\n\n35.\n\nEgypt states that it believed until July 2004, when served with Wena\u2019s Application, that it had put its differences with Wena behind it, since it had fully complied with the Award, and that it was surprised that, according to Wena, \"*a dispute has arisen**between Wena and the Arab Republic of Egypt...concerning the meaning of the Award\"* requiring its interpretation under Article 50(1) of the ICSID Convention.\n\n36.\n\nEgypt contends that following the Annulment Decision of the Committee upholding the Award, Wena drew down on the unconditional standby letter of credit, equivalent to the amount of the Award, which had been posted by Egypt in accordance with the Committee\u2019s procedural directions. Egypt further points out that in June 2002, it paid Wena the additional interest that had accrued on the Award during the annulment proceedings, so that the total sum paid by Egypt amounted to US$ 22,970,955.88.24\n\n*See* Response, Section 2.\n\n37.\n\nEgypt submits that - contrary to Wena\u2019s assertion - it is not aware of any such dispute and cannot conceive how a dispute may legitimately be said to exist in respect of an Award that was fully performed by Egypt three years ago. According to Egypt, it is moreover obvious from the Application that the purported disputes with which it is concerned (i) all arose after the issuance of the Award, (ii) concern Wena\u2019s relationship with persons and entities who were not parties to the ICSID arbitration between Wena and Egypt and (iii) relate to matters the Original Tribunal in that case was not asked to decide upon.25\n\n*Id.,* Sections 4 and 5.\n\n**2. The Factual Background of the Application**\n------------------------------------------------\n\n38.\n\nEgypt takes the view that the Application is devoid of any merit.\n\n39.\n\nIt agrees that disputes arose between Wena and EHC concerning their respective obligations under the Hotel Leases soon after these leases were entered into and states that after Wena had stopped paying rent to EHC for both Hotels in the fall of 1990, EHC evicted Wena from the two properties in April 1991. According to Egypt, this set in motion a chain of events that ultimately led to the Original Arbitration. Egypt states that according to the findings of the Award, between April 1991 and the initiation of the Original Arbitration in July 1998, Wena was reinstated in the Hotels and commercial arbitration proceedings were initiated by Wena against EHC to obtain damages relating to the evictions. In the commercial arbitration relating to the Luxor Hotel, as the hotel to which Wena\u2019s Application primarily relates, Wena, according to Egypt, was awarded compensation, but said award was set aside by the Cairo Court of Appeal.26\n\n*Id.,* Section 8\n\n40.\n\nAccording to Egypt, in the Original Arbitration, Wena was careful to distinguish between the disputes arising between it and EHC under the Hotel Leases and the separate disputes arising between it and Egypt in relation to Egypt\u2019s purported breach of obligations under the IPPA. Egypt reports that, indeed, the difference between the two categories of disputes was, in part, the subject of the jurisdictional phase of the Original Arbitration, during which Wena made clear that it did not wish the Original Tribunal to decide any disputes between it and EHC. Therefore, the Original Tribunal noted in its Decision on Jurisdiction, dated June 29, 1999:\n\n*\"Wena\u2019s counsel argued that Claimant actually has two separate disputes. One dispute, Wena acknowledges, is with EHC for violating its agreements with Wena.. However, Wena also contends that it has a separate dispute with Respondent for \u2018expropriating Wena\u2019s investments without providing prompt, adequate and effective compensation, and by failing to accord Wena\u2019s investments in Egypt fair and equitable treatment and full protection and security\u2019.\"27*\n\n*Id.,* Section 9, and copy of *Wena Hotels Limited v. Arab Republic of Egypt*, Decision on Jurisdiction, dated June 29, 1999, 41 ILM 881 (2002), p. 890, attached to the Response as Exhibit E1.\n\n41.\n\nEgypt submits that, accordingly, only the dispute between Wena and Egypt under the IPPA was the subject of the Award, whereas the separate disputes between EHC and Wena in respect of the Hotel Leases were \"*left to another day and another forum.*\"\n\n42.\n\nAccording to Egypt, this position was also acknowledged and endorsed by the Committee formed to review Egypt\u2019s Application for Annulment, which in its Annulment Decision stated the following:28\n\n*\"This Committee cannot ignore of course that there is a connection between the leases and the IPPA since the former were designed to operate under the protection of the IPPA as the materialization of the investment. But this is simply a condition precedent to the operation of the IPPA. It does not involve an amalgamation of different legal instruments and dispute**settlement arrangements. Just as EHC does not represent the State nor can its acts be attributed to it because of its commercial and private function, the acts or failures to act of the State cannot be considered as a question connected to the performance of the parties under the leases. The private and public function of these various instruments are thus kept separate and distinct.*\n\n*This Committee accordingly concludes that the subject matter of the lease agreements submitted to Egyptian law was different from the subject matter brought before ICSID arbitration under the IPPA.\"*\n\n*Id.,* Section 12, and the copy of the Annulment Decision, paragraphs 35 and 36, attached to the Application as Annex 2.\n\n43.\n\nEgypt submits that it is not responsible for and exercises no control whatsoever over EGOTH or the judicial receiver in respect of the actions alleged by Wena.29 Egypt rather contends that EGOTH has acted in an entirely autonomous capacity, which allegedly is evident from Annex 5 to the Application, showing that EGOTH brought a legal action before the South Cairo Court of First Instance against the Egyptian Prime Minister and Minister of Finance with regard to this matter, which according to Egypt apparently was dismissed by the court.30\n\n*Id.,* Section 15 and its footnote 7.\n\n*Id.,* Sections 14 and 15.\n\n44.\n\nAccording to Egypt, Wena\u2019s allegations that EGOTH\u2019s assertion of its commercial rights against Wena is part of \"*Egypt\u2019s campaign of harassment*\" are unsupported by fact and law and contradict the findings of the Original Tribunal and the Committee.\n\n**3. Egypt\u2019s Legal Position**\n-----------------------------\n\n45.\n\nEgypt therefore contends that Wena is seeking to subvert the interpretation process envisaged in Article 50(1) of the ICSID Convention in order to resolve the commercial dispute between it and EGOTH under the Luxor Lease that was excluded from the Original Arbitration.\n\n46.\n\nEgypt maintains that Wena\u2019s Application has no basis under Article 50(1) of the ICSID Convention, since there is no dispute between the parties concerning the meaning or scope of the Award within the purview of this provision.\n\n47.\n\nAccording to Egypt, the Application falls outside the domain of what is permissible in \"interpreting\" an arbitration award. It takes the view that interpretation is permitted solely for the purpose of clarifying ambiguous phrasing in the operative section of an award and \"*does not entail a review of the merits of the award*.\"31 In Egypt\u2019s view, adding to and revising an ICSID award are the subjects of Articles 49 and 51 of the ICSID Convention, under both of which Wena has not and could not have brought its Application since the time limits for an additional award or a petition to revise have already expired.32\n\n*Id.,* Section 19.\n\n*Id.,* Sections 19 to 21.\n\n48.\n\nEgypt states that interpretation is generally only permitted in the case of ambiguity in the operative part of the award and that, moreover, a valid request for interpretation may not seek to expand or alter an award\u2019s operative section. It must therefore be limited to the facts and issues as they were presented during the original proceedings with the consequence that consideration of facts that arose after the award was issued is not permitted under Article 50 of the ICSID Convention.33\n\n*Id.,* Sections 22 *et seq.* with examples of decisions of the Permanent Court of Arbitration and the International Court of Justice.\n\n49.\n\nAccording to Egypt, Wena seeks an \"interpretation\" that would add legal consequences to the Original Tribunal\u2019s operative holding, namely, that Wena cannot incur any liability to any party in connection with a right that has been expropriated, and that the Application therefore falls outside of the scope of the Award. Egypt maintains that in the Original Arbitration, Wena never sought determination of this issue and was satisfied to request a declaration that its leasehold rights had been expropriated and that Wena was awarded compensation for such expropriation.34\n\n*Id.,* Section 28.\n\n50.\n\nFurthermore, Egypt asserts that Wena\u2019s Application is entirely based on circumstances that arose after the Award was issued. Egypt states that Wena itself admits in its Application that the actions which Egypt allegedly took with regard to the Luxor Lease took place \"*over the past two years.*\"35\n\n*Id.,* Section 31.\n\n51.\n\nFinally, Egypt alleges that the Application is invalid because there is no dispute between Egypt and Wena about the operative section of the Award. According to Egypt, there can be no such dispute because the Award contains no ambiguity preventing its execution, a fact which is shown by Egypt\u2019s full compliance with the Award three years ago.\n\n**4. The Relief Sought by Egypt**\n---------------------------------\n\n52.\n\nTherefore, Egypt requests the Tribunal to\n\n*\"(i) reject the Application in its entirety; and*\n\n*(ii) order Wena to reimburse all costs Egypt has incurred in these proceedings.\"36*\n\n*Id.,* Section 35.\n\n**C. Wena\u2019s Further Arguments as Set Out in its Reply Memorial**\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n53.\n\nIn its Reply, Wena states that the actions referred to in the Application allegedly brought about by Egypt, either directly or through its instrumentalities, disregard the Award\u2019s ruling that Egypt expropriated Wena\u2019s rights in the Luxor Lease. In Wena\u2019s view, these actions also attest to existing opposite views between Wena and Egypt in that respect.\n\n**1. Existence of a Dispute between Wena and Egypt as to the Meaning of the Award**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n54.\n\nWena disagrees with Egypt\u2019s allegation that Wena\u2019s dispute is not a dispute with Egypt with respect to the interpretation of the Award, but a \"*commercial dispute*\" against EGOTH under the Luxor Lease. In support of its contention that there is a dispute with Egypt regarding the meaning of \"expropriation\", Wena points out that the Award determined that Egypt\u2019s actions \"*amounted to an expropriation*\" of Wena\u2019s rights under the Hotel Leases. On this basis, Wena maintains that it was decided by the Original Tribunal that as a result of Egypt\u2019s expropriation no contractual rights and obligations binding Wena under the Luxor Lease exist. In Wena\u2019s view, the consequence of this finding is that there can be no dispute between Wena and EHC (or EGOTH) *\"in relation to their respective obligations under the [Luxor] Lease,\"* because there can be no dispute today in relation to a contractual right that was expropriated.37\n\n*See* Reply Memorial, Section 13.\n\n55.\n\nFurthermore, Wena submits that Egypt\u2019s liability was decided by the Original Tribunal under the IPPA, regardless of the relationship between Wena and EHC under the Hotel Leases. Thus, what the Original Tribunal found relevant to Egypt\u2019s liability under the IPPA were Egypt\u2019s own acts and omissions with respect to its obligations to protect Wena\u2019s investments, rather than the status of EHC under Egyptian law.38 Wena contends that, for the same reasons, the status of EGOTH as successor of EHC or issues of attribution of EGOTH\u2019s actions to Egypt are irrelevant to the interpretation dispute before the Tribunal. Wena maintains that it therefore is of little bearing, for the purposes of the interpretation of the word \"expropriation\" by the Tribunal, that Egypt claims that it is not responsible for and exercises no control whatsoever over EGOTH or the judicial receiver in respect of any such actions.39\n\n*Id.,* Section 18.\n\n*Id.,* Section 21.\n\n56.\n\nFurthermore, Wena states that Egypt could hardly be surprised by Wena\u2019s Application given that Wena addressed a letter to Egypt through the Egyptian State Lawsuits Authority on September 27, 2002, with respect to the precise point in dispute. Nor can Egypt maintain that it is not aware of the actions taken by EGOTH, which is a \"state-owned company\", or the Ministry of Tourism. In this context, Wena points out that various official websites of the Egyptian government continue to promote the hotel under the brand name \"Luxor Wena Hotel\".40\n\n*Id.,* Section 22.\n\n57.\n\nAs to Egypt\u2019s argument that the purported disputes all arose after the issuance of the Award, Wena first submits that any dispute concerning the interpretation of an award arises, by definition, after the award is rendered. Wena further states that, when giving an interpretation of the Award in order to establish the meaning of the word \"expropriation\", this Tribunal should not, and is not requested by Wena to refer to the factual background provided by Wena. Rather, this Tribunal should only provide an interpretation of the word \"expropriation\", in light of the facts that were decided by the Original Tribunal in the Award.41\n\n*Id.,* Sections 24 *et seq.*\n\n58.\n\nAs to Egypt\u2019s further argument that an application for interpretation made under Article 50 of the ICSID Convention must only concern the enforcement of the award, Wena finds this argument baseless. Egypt had cited Legal Committee Chairman Aaron Broches\u2019 explanation, during the negotiation of the Convention, that \"no time limit was imposed upon interpretation applications because \u2018there would be cases where the award might require a course of conduct which could extend over a long period of time, and in that case a party should not be precluded from seeking an interpretation on the *execution* of the award\u2019 (emphasis added).\"42 Wena submits that Egypt\u2019s quotation from the drafting history of the provision only concerns the issue of whether time limits should be required for an application for interpretation to the extent that the enforcement of an award may extend over a period of time. But nowhere in the quote is there - according to Wena - any indication as to a requirement that a dispute as to the meaning or scope of the award be restricted to issues of enforcement.\n\n*See* Response, Annex 3, p. 845 and Response, Section 20.\n\n59.\n\nWena agrees with Egypt that an application for interpretation must relate to a dispute as to the meaning or scope of \"*what the court has decided with binding force.*\" However, Wena maintains that it does not follow from this notion that the grounds for a judgment are irrelevant to the interpretation of that judgment. Specifically, Wena relies on the *Delimitation of the Continental Shelf Case,43* in support of its view that the Tribunal may very well refer to the grounds of the Award when deciding - in the light of the facts as decided in the Award - the meaning of the word \"expropriation.\"44\n\n*Delimitation of the Continental Shelf (U.K. v. France): Interpretation of the Decision of June 30, 1977*, Decision, dated March 14, 1978, 54 ILR 139 (1978).\n\n*See* Reply Memorial, Section 37.\n\n60.\n\nWena further submits that the operative section of the Award expressly determined and used the term \"expropriation\" and that therefore the request for interpretation relates to an issue actually decided by the Original Tribunal. Furthermore, Wena submits that the Application cannot be considered to be held inadmissible on the ground that it had not sought an explicit determination of the meaning of the term \"expropriation\" since it could hardly anticipate that it could face rent demands for the property from which it was expropriated.45\n\n*Id.,* Section 42.\n\n**2. The Interpretation Sought by Wena is Within the Scope of the Award**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n61.\n\nIn support of its view that the interpretation sought is within the scope of the Award, Wena submits that the meaning of expropriation was touched upon by the Award, although it does not expressly state that a party expropriated from a right, including a contractual right, cannot incur any liability associated with that right. In support of its position, Wena relies on the holdings of the Original Tribunal in the Award (Sections 97 through 99, 131, 135) and on the Original Tribunal\u2019s findings regarding the award of interest. According to Wena, these findings demonstrate that the meaning upheld by the Original Tribunal with respect to Wena\u2019s \"expropriation\" was that Wena had been totally and permanently deprived of its rights in the Luxor Lease.\n\n62.\n\nAccording to Wena, the fact that there is a dispute between Wena and Egypt on the question of the meaning of \"expropriation\" is illustrated by Egypt\u2019s response, which, as Wena submits, confirms the divergence of views between the parties as to the consequences of an \"expropriation.\" Wena concludes that an interpretation as to the meaning of the Award on this point is needed.46\n\n*Id.,* Sections 49 *et seq.*\n\n**D. Egypt\u2019s Further Arguments as Set Out in its Rejoinder**\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n63.\n\nEgypt submits that Wena is unable to provide any coherent basis for its Application and that it is obvious from Wena\u2019s Reply that the supposed dispute with which the Application is concerned is entirely different from the dispute that was the subject of the Original Arbitration and the ensuing Award. In Egypt\u2019s view, Wena is improperly seeking, under the guise of an application for interpretation, to obtain a new decision concerning the legal consequences of the Award for third parties who were not parties to the original arbitration. Such entirely new ruling, concerning Wena\u2019s possible liabilities towards a third party (EGOTH), falls far outside the scope of the Award, as Egypt submits.\n\n64.\n\nEgypt denies Wena\u2019s allegation that the Original Tribunal found that there are no contractual rights and obligations binding Wena under the Luxor Lease as a result of Egypt\u2019s expropriation, and Wena\u2019s conclusion that there can therefore be no dispute between Wena and EGOTH. Egypt maintains that the Original Tribunal, to the contrary, expressly refrained from making any determinations concerning Wena\u2019s rights and obligations under the Luxor Lease. The dispute that was the subject of the original Arbitration was whether Egypt had violated its obligation towards Wena under the IPPA and not whether Wena had any further liability under the Luxor Lease. According to Egypt, the Original Tribunal did not find that Wena was permanently deprived of all of its rights in respect of the Luxor Lease after the Luxor Hotel was returned to it in 1992, nor did it seek to determine the consequences of the Luxor Hotel\u2019s continuing occupation and operation by Wena from April 1992 until August 1997 for the parties to the Luxor Lease.47 Egypt maintains that it is far from evident that the Tribunal\u2019s findings of expropriation must necessarily, as argued by Wena, lead to the conclusion that Wena has no outstanding liability to EHC or EGOTH under the Luxor Lease.\n\n*See* Rejoinder, Sections 11 and 14.\n\n65.\n\nEgypt maintains that Wena\u2019s Application not only falls outside the scope of the Award, but also outside the scope of the Original Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction, since the Original Tribunal had no authority to make any decisions concerning Wena\u2019s rights and obligations under the Luxor Lease binding on the Egyptian party (EGOTH or its predecessor in interest, EHC) to that lease.48\n\n*Id.,* Section 7.\n\n66.\n\nAs to Wena\u2019s view that interpretation proceedings are not as restricted as set out in Egypt\u2019s Response, Egypt maintains that Wena is unable to cite any authorities in support of its contention. While agreeing that the wording of Article 50(1) of the ICSID Convention does not expressly limit applications for interpretation to those instances where the parties are in disagreement as to the enforcement of the award, Egypt maintains that Wena nevertheless mischaracterizes the Convention\u2019s negotiating history. According to Egypt, it was the drafters\u2019 intention, when not providing for a time limit for a request for interpretation, not to preclude a party \"*from seeking an interpretation on the execution of the award*\". But they did not intend, through Article 50(1) of the ICSID Convention, to encourage post-award proceedings for the purpose of obtaining abstract declarations that are unnecessary in order to permit, and have no bearing on, the award\u2019s implementation.49\n\n*Id.,* Sections 18 *et seq.*\n\n67.\n\nFurthermore, Egypt submits that Wena in its Reply neither disputed nor satisfied the conditions for an admissible request for interpretation as identified by the International Court of Justice (**\"ICJ\"**) in its judgment in the *Asylum Case*.50\n\n*Request for Interpretation of the Judgment of November 20, 1950 in the Asylum Case (Colombia v. Peru),* Judgment of November 27, 1950, 1950 ICJ Rep. 395.\n\n68.\n\nAs to Wena\u2019s argument that its application is admissible since it could hardly anticipate that it could face rent demands for the property that was expropriated and therefore initially saw no need to seek explicit determination that it cannot incur any liability with regard to that property, Egypt submits that this argument is without merit. It points out that while, at the time of the Original Arbitration, there had been no finding of expropriation, Wena\u2019s failure to pay rent for the Luxor Hotel since 1990 was noted by Egypt in the arbitration as an explanation for EHC\u2019s decision to evict Wena from the Luxor Hotel in 1991 as well as Wena\u2019s subsequent eviction in September 1997. Furthermore, Egypt states that it at no time assumed ownership of the Luxor Hotel, which at all relevant times was the property of EHC and EGOTH. Therefore, Egypt maintains that Wena\u2019s contention that its possible liability under the Luxor Lease could only be to Egypt, since Egypt expropriated Wena for its own benefit, is erroneous.51\n\nRejoinder, Section 22.\n\n69.\n\nFinally, Egypt submits that since its full compliance with the Award, it has taken no actions against Wena, apart from the apparent reference to the \"Luxor Wena Hotel\" in official tourism websites. But this reference, Egypt claims, evidences nothing more than the negligence of Egyptian tourism authorities to update their websites. Egypt further submits that even Wena\u2019s own website continues to refer to the Luxor Hotel as the \"Luxor Wena Hotel\", including a description of the facilities offered by the hotel together with the relevant contact details for making reservations.52\n\n*Id.,* Sections 24 *et seq.* and Exhibit E15.\n\n**III. DISCUSSION**\n-------------------\n\n**A. Introduction**\n-------------------\n\n70.\n\nWena requests an interpretation of the Original Tribunal\u2019s determination that Egypt expropriated Wena\u2019s rights under the Luxor Lease and deprived Wena of its \"*fundamental rights of ownership.*\" In particular, Wena requests that the interpretation address whether the expropriation constituted a total and permanent deprivation of Wena\u2019s rights under the Luxor Lease, such as to preclude subsequent legal actions by Egypt that presume the contrary. Wena further requests a confirmation that such expropriation took place on April 1, 1991. Egypt requests that the Tribunal reject the Application in its entirety.\n\n71.\n\nThe Tribunal has carefully considered the positions of the parties. For the reasons explained in detail below, the Tribunal by unanimous decision partly approves, and partly rejects, the Application for Interpretation of the Arbitral Award rendered on December 8, 2000.\n\n72.\n\nWena\u2019s Application for Interpretation is the first request of its kind ever received by ICSID.53 Accordingly, no previous decisions by ICSID arbitral tribunals exist that deal with the purpose, scope and limits of the interpretation procedure. However, in making its decision, the Tribunal was able to rely not only on the relevant provisions of the ICSID Convention and the ICSID Arbitration Rules and their interpretation by well-known scholars, but also on decisions by other tribunals, in particular, the Permanent Court of International Justice (\"**PCIJ**\") and its successor, the ICJ.\n\nIndeed, there was an application for interpretation in the case *Marvin Roy Feldman Karpa v. United Mexican States,* ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/99/1), Decision on Correction and Interpretation of the Award, dated June 13, 2003, 18 ICSID Rev. - F.I.L.J. 595 (2003). Said application was governed by the Additional Facility Rules and was mainly a request for corrections. Therefore, it is different from the case at hand which is governed by the ICSID Convention and Arbitration Rules.\n\n**B. The Relevant Provisions regarding the Requested Interpretation of the Award**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n73.\n\nThe Application for Interpretation now before the Tribunal is based on Article 50(1) of the ICSID Convention, which reads as follows:\n\n*\"(1) If any dispute shall arise between the parties as to the meaning or scope of an award, either party may request interpretation of the award by an application in writing addressed to the Secretary-General.\"*\n\n74.\n\nThe requirements for an admissible application for interpretation are set forth in Article 50(1) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules as follows:\n\n*\"(1) An application for the interpretation, revision or annulment of an award shall be addressed in writing to the Secretary-General and shall:*\n\n*(a) identify the award to which it relates;*\n\n*(b) indicate the date of the application;*\n\n*(c) state in detail:*\n\n*(i) in an application for interpretation, the precise points in dispute;*\n\n*(ii) in an application for revision,.*\n\n*(iii) in an application for annulment,.*\n\n*(d) be accompanied by the payment of a fee for lodging the application.\"*\n\n75.\n\nFurther, Article 53 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules provides:\n\n*\"The provisions of these Rules shall apply mutatis mutandis to any procedure relating to the interpretation, revision or annulment of an award and to the decision of the Tribunal or Committee.\"*\n\n76.\n\nTaken together, the relevant provisions of the ICSID Convention and the ICSID Arbitration Rules thus establish two main conditions for the admissibility of an application for interpretation: first, there has to be a dispute between the original parties as to the meaning or scope of the award; second, the purpose of the application must be to obtain an interpretation of the award.\n\n77.\n\nThese conditions concur with the requirements for the admissibility of interpretation proceedings established by the PCIJ in the *Chorz\u00f3w Factory Case54* In this decision, the PCIJ relied on Article 60 of its Statute, which reads as follows:\n\n*\"The judgment is final and without appeal. In the event of dispute as to the meaning or scope of the judgment, the Court shall construe it upon the request of any Party.\"55*\n\n*Interpretation of Judgments Nos. 7 and 8 (the Chorz\u00f3w Factory),* Judgment of December 16, 1927, PCIJ Series A, No. 13.\n\n*Id.*, p. 10.\n\n78.\n\nIn its judgment, the PCIJ stated:\n\n*\"From the article* [60] *it appears that these conditions are the following:*\n\n*(1) there must be a dispute as to the meaning and scope of a judgment of the Court;*\n\n*(2) the request should have for its object an interpretation of the judgment.\"* 56\n\n*Id.*\n\n79.\n\nThese requirements were also confirmed by the ICJ in the *Asylum Case*57 and in the *Continental Shelf Case (Tunisia v. Libyan Arab Jamahiriya)58* with regard to Article 60 of the Statute of the ICJ. In the *Asylum Case*, the ICJ established the following:\n\n*\"Thus it* [Article 60] *lays down two conditions for the admissibility of such a request:*\n\n*(1) The real purpose of the request must be to obtain an interpretation of the**judgment. [...]*\n\n*(2) In addition, it is necessary, that there should exist a dispute as to the**meaning or scope of the judgment.*\" *59*\n\n*See Colombia v. Peru, supra* footnote 50 *.*\n\n*Application for Revision and Interpretation of the Judgment of February 24, 1982 in the Case Concerning the Continental Shelf (Tunisia v. Libya),* Judgment of December 10, 1985, 1985 ICJ Rep.192, p. 223.\n\n*Colombia v. Peru, supra* footnote 50, p. 402.\n\n**C. The Existence of a Dispute as to the Meaning or Scope of the Award**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**1. The Legal Principles Regarding the Notion of a Dispute as to the Meaning or Scope of the Award**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n80.\n\nAs stated above, the first condition for the admissibility of an application for interpretation is the existence of a dispute between the parties as to the meaning or scope of the award.\n\n81.\n\nThe existence of a dispute as to the meaning or scope of an award requires that the dispute is sufficiently concrete to be susceptible of a specific request for interpretation.60 Whereas it is not necessary to show the existence of a dispute in a specific manner, such as in formal communications between the parties, it is sufficient if - but also mandatory that - the two parties have actually exposed their divergence of views on definite points in relation to the award\u2019s meaning or scope.61 In contrast, general complaints about the award\u2019s lack of clarity do not suffice.62\n\nSchreuer, *The ICSID Convention: A Commentary* (2001), p. 857.\n\n*Chroz\u00f3w Factory, supra* footnote 54, pp. 10 *et seq.*\n\nSchreuer, *supra* footnote 60, p. 858.\n\n82.\n\nFurthermore, the dispute must relate to the meaning or scope of what has been decided with binding force, thus in principle to the award\u2019s operative section, a condition well adhered to by international practice and confirmed by opinions of scholars, as will be shown below. Thus, in the *Chorz\u00f3w Factory Case,* the PCIJ stated that the request must relate to the operative part:\n\n\"*In order that a difference of opinion should become the subject of a request for interpretation under Article 60 of the Statute, there must therefore exist a**difference of opinion between the Parties as to those points in the judgment in question which have been decided with binding force.\"*63\n\nThe Court further explained:\n\n*\"A difference of opinion as to whether a particular point has or has not been**decided with binding force also constitutes a case which comes within the**terms of the provision in question, [...]. \"64*\n\n*Chroz\u00f3w Factory, supra* footnote 54, p. 11.\n\n*Id.*, p. 12.\n\n83.\n\nThese principles were confirmed by the ICJ in the *Continental Shelf Case (Tunisia v.

Libya, supra* footnote 58, p. 218.\n\n84.\n\nHowever, in the *Delimitation of the Continental Shelf Case*, the Court of Arbitration in that dispute clarified that although the application for interpretation must be directed towards clarifying an ambiguity in the operative section, a tribunal is not constrained from referring to the grounds of the award, stating the following:\n\n*\"The Court of Arbitration considers it to be well settled that in international proceedings the authority of res judicata, that is the binding force of the decision, attaches in principle only to the provisions of its dispositif and not to its reasoning. In the opinion of the Court it is equally clear that, having regard to the close links that exist between the reasoning of a decision and the provisions of its dispositif, recourse may in principle be had to the reasoning in order to elucidate the meaning and scope of the dispositif. From this it follows that under certain conditions and within certain limits, the reasoning in a decision may properly be invoked as a ground for requesting an interpretation of provisions of its dispositif [\u2026]. But the subject of a request of interpretation must genuinely be directed to the question of what it is that has been settled with binding force in the decision, that is in the dispositif; the reasoning cannot therefore be invoked for the purpose of obtaining a ruling on a point not so settled in the dispositif [\u2026].\"* *66*\n\n*U.K. v. France, supra* footnote 43, p. 170. As to the exigency of an ambiguity in the *operative* section, *see* also *Panacaviar S.A v. Iran, see* Exhibit E 7.\n\n85.\n\nCommentators on international arbitration also share this approach to determine the existence of a dispute as to the meaning or scope of an award.67 It is stated:\n\n*\"The interpretation of an arbitral award is only really helpful where the ruling, which is generally presented in the form of an order, is so ambiguous that the parties could legitimately disagree as to its meaning. By contrast, any obscurity or ambiguity in the grounds for the decision does not warrant a request for interpretation of the award.\"68*\n\nCraig, Park and Paulsson, *International Chamber of Commerce Arbitration* (3rd ed. 2002) [hereinafter cited as \"Craig, Park\"], p. 408; Fouchard, Gaillard and Goldmann, *On International Commercial Arbitration* (1999), p. 776 [hereinafter cited as \"Fouchard\"]; Poudret and Besson, *Droit compar\u00e9 de l\u2019arbitrage international* (2002), margin note no. 760.\n\nFouchard, *supra*, p. 776.\n\n86.\n\nFurthermore, some scholars take the view that a request for interpretation is only admissible on condition that the enforcement of the award is concerned. For instance, prior to the adoption of the 1998 Arbitration Rules of the International Chamber of Commerce (\"**ICC Rules**\") - and therefore the possibility of an application for interpretation as set forth in Article 29(2) of the ICC Rules - the Court of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce (the \"**ICC Court**\") allowed interpretation only as to assure that its awards were enforceable at law.69 Under the ICC Rules, a request for interpretation is only deemed admissible \"*when the terms of an award are so vague or confusing that a party has a genuine doubt about how the award should be executed*.\"70\n\nDaly, \"Correction and Interpretation of Arbitral Awards under the ICC Rules of Arbitration\" (2002) 13:1 ICC Bulletin 61, p. 62; Craig, Park and Paulsson, *Annoted Guide to the 1998 ICC Arbitration Rules* (1998), p. 160.\n\n*Daly*, *supra*, (63 *et seq.*); *see also* on this issue Craig, Park, *supra* footnote 67, p. 408.\n\n87.\n\nIt is true that interpretation proceedings are particularly relevant if a dispute about the exact meaning of the award is likely to prevent its execution. However, neither Article 50(1) of the ICSID Convention nor the ICSID Arbitration Rules establish such a requirement for the admissibility of an application for interpretation, and it seems possible that there are situations where a party may have a valid interest to obtain an interpretation of an award, even though its enforcement is not (directly) concerned. However, the Tribunal agrees with the view taken by a commentator to the ICSID Convention that the dispute must at least have some practical relevance to the award\u2019s implementation; mere theoretical discussions about the award\u2019s meaning or scope are not sufficient.71\n\nSchreuer, *supra* footnote 60, p. 858; in this sense also Fouchard, *supra* footnote 67, p. 776.\n\n88.\n\nIn the oral hearing it became clear that the parties largely agree on the aforementioned legal authorities.72 In particular, counsel for Wena declared as undisputed between the parties that a dispute within the meaning of Article 50 of the ICSID Convention must have some practical relevance to the award\u2019s implementation,73 and that the subject matter for a request for interpretation must be directed to the operative part of the award in question.74 In this regard, counsel for Wena pointed out that there is a slight nuance in the parties\u2019 understanding. He stated that from Wena\u2019s point of view the Tribunal may obviously look at the reasons to interpret the operative part of an award.75 He further added that the requirement that a request for interpretation must be directed to the operative part of the award is already satisfied if the object of interpretation is the operative part of a decision and not the reasons.76\n\nFor Wena *see* Transcript, p. 5 line 23 and for Egypt *see* Transcript, p. 47, lines 19 *et seq*.\n\n*See* Transcript, p. 6, lines 13 to 15.\n\n*Id.,* p. 8, lines 4 *et seq*.\n\n*Id.*, p. 9, lines 1 *et seq*. and lines 6 *et seq*.\n\n*Id.*, p. 9 lines 4 *et seq*.\n\n89.\n\nIn the Tribunal\u2019s view, even this nuance is not disputed between the parties, since Egypt in its Rejoinder declared:\n\n*\"[...] the parties agree that although the application for interpretation must be directed towards clarifying an ambiguity in the dispositive section, a tribunal is not constrained from referring to the grounds for the award.\"77*\n\nIn the oral hearing, counsel for Egypt again confirmed that it agrees with Wena that the Tribunal may invoke the award\u2019s reasoning to elucidate the meaning of the award in question.78\n\nRejoinder, p. 7, footnote 14.\n\n*See* Transcript, p. 75, lines 4 to 7.\n\n90.\n\nFurthermore, as to the existence of a dispute, counsel for Wena indicated that they disagree with the conclusion drawn by Egypt from the *Chorz\u00f3w Factory Case* that all facts subsequent to that judgment are irrelevant.79 Wena in this regard points out that the precise quote is the following:80\n\n*\"Moreover, the Court,* ***when giving an interpretation****, refrains from any examination of facts other than those which it has considered in the**judgment under interpretation, and consequently all facts subsequent to that judgment.\"*81*[Emphasis added by the Tribunal]*\n\n*See* Response, Section 26.\n\n*See* Transcript, p. 11, lines 15 *et seq*.\n\n*Chorzow Factory, supra* footnote 54, p. 21.\n\n91.\n\nTherefore, Wena insists that for the purpose of establishing the existence of a dispute one must have a look at what happened after the judgment since the award\u2019s implementation is necessarily afterwards.82 But Wena agrees that for the purpose of giving an interpretation one must only look at the award and at its reasons, without dealing with anything outside the scope of the award.83\n\n*See* Transcript, p. 11, lines 21 *et seq*. and p. 12, lines 8 *et seq*.\n\n*Id.,* p. 11 line 23 to p. 12, line 3 and p. 12, lines 19 to 24.\n\n92.\n\nThe Tribunal therefore notes that the parties largely agree on the legal principles and authorities which the Tribunal will have to apply to the case at hand and that their disagreement relates to the application of those principles.\n\n**2. The Application of the Aforementioned Legal Principles to the Case at Hand**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**a. The Existence of a Dispute**\n---------------------------------\n\n93.\n\nOn the basis of the principles established above, the Tribunal shall first assess whether there is a dispute between the parties within the meaning of Article 50(1) of the ICSID Convention, *i.e*., a dispute as to the meaning or scope of the operative part of the Award.\n\n94.\n\nIn doing so, the Tribunal shall first analyze the precise scope of Wena\u2019s requested relief, which - as stated above (*see* Section 33) - reads as follows:\n\n*\"Wena respectfully requests an interpretation of the Tribunal\u2019s determination that Egypt expropriated Wena\u2019s rights in the Luxor Lease and deprived Wena of its \"fundamental rights of ownership\". In particular, Wena requests that the interpretation address whether the expropriation constituted a total, permanent deprivation of Wena\u2019s rights in the Luxor Lease, such as to preclude subsequent legal actions by Egypt that presume the contrary.\"84*\n\n*See* Application, Section 50.\n\n95.\n\nIn the oral hearing, counsel for Wena clarified that Wena also requests an interpretation that the expropriation took place as of April 1, 1991.85\n\n*See* Transcript, p. 13, line 21 to p. 14, line 1; p. 14, lines 11 to 14; p. 17, lines 15 to 17; p. 18, line 23 to p. 19, line 1. Upon further question of the Tribunal, counsel for Wena clarified that its Relief sought should be read as per Section 50 of Wena\u2019s Application in combination with Section 47 of its Application, which would technically mean that the Tribunal has to add the words \"as of April 1, 1991\" to Section 50 of the Application; *see* Transcript, p. 95, lines 19 to 24.\n\n96.\n\nFurther, in the course of the interpretation proceedings, Claimant made clear that its interpretation request regarding the consequences of the expropriation indeed has two branches: On the one hand, Wena is seeking a clarification that the result of the expropriation is \"such as to preclude subsequent legal actions by Egypt that presume the contrary;\" on the other hand, Wena also requests the Tribunal to address the consequences of the expropriation regarding Wena\u2019s legal relationships with third parties, such as EHC, respectively, EGOTH and, more specifically, whether or not Wena, as the party expropriated from a given right, can incur any liability associated with that right.86 Even though this second branch of Wena\u2019s relief has not been formally presented, it has clearly evolved in the interpretation proceedings, and has been addressed by both parties.87 The Tribunal, therefore, feels obliged to also address this second branch of Claimant\u2019s relief, and it will do so separately below (see Sections 127 *et seq.*).\n\nIn its Application (Section 48) and its Reply Memorial (Section 42), Wena has described the resulting effects of the expropriation more generally as meaning that \"*a party expropriated from a given right cannot incur any liability associated with that right*\".\n\nApplication, Sections 47 and 48; Reply Memorial, Sections 2, 5, 13, 42 and 46; Rejoinder, Sections 4, 5 and 9.\n\n97.\n\nHaving thus analyzed the precise scope of Wena\u2019s request for interpretation, the Tribunal has to examine whether the different points covered by the interpretation request are in dispute between the parties. According to Wena, all parts of the relief indeed are in dispute because Egypt allegedly disregards the Original Tribunal\u2019s findings that the transfer of control to EHC amounted to an expropriation. Egypt, in contrast, takes the view that there can be no dispute whatsoever between Wena and Egypt since, by paying compensation to Wena, it fully complied with the Award three years ago.\n\n98.\n\nOne could indeed take the view that since Egypt paid the full amount it had been ordered to pay to Wena, there is no room for any further dispute between the parties that could have some practical relevance as to the Award\u2019s implementation. However, Wena correctly points out that the Award, in its operative section, not only ordered Egypt to pay compensation, including damages and interest (*see* Section 136 of the Award), but also found that Egypt\u2019s actions, as determined by the Original Tribunal, amounted to an expropriation (*see* Section 135 of the Award). Wena submits that the meaning of the term \"expropriation\" used in Section 135 was touched upon in the reasoning of the Award, although the Original Tribunal did not expressly state what Wena alleges to be the necessary consequences of Section 135 of the Award, *i.e*., that the expropriation was total and permanent; it took place as of April 1, 1991; and as a consequence, subsequent legal actions by Egypt that presume the contrary are precluded; and Wena as the expropriated party cannot incur any liability associated with the expropriated rights.\n\n99.\n\nThrough its submissions and oral argument, it became clear that Egypt disputes that the expropriation as decided by the Original Tribunal had any of these consequences. Specifically, Egypt denies that the expropriation had a total and permanent effect.88 Further, Egypt denies that the Original Tribunal made any ruling regarding the contractual rights and obligations of Wena under the Luxor Lease.89 In addition, upon question by the Tribunal, Egypt did not unequivocally declare the date of April 1, 1991, as undisputed.90\n\n*See* Rejoinder, Section 14.\n\n*Id.,* p. 53, lines 19 *et seq*.; p. 57, lines 1 *et seq*.; p. 58, lines 2 *et seq*.\n\n*See* Transcript, p. 94, line 24 to p. 95, line 6.\n\n100.\n\nConsidering the foregoing, the Tribunal is of the opinion that there does actually exist a dispute between Wena and Egypt, within the meaning of Article 50(1) of the ICSID Convention, regarding the meaning of the term \"expropriation\" as used in the operative section of the Award.\n\n101.\n\nThe Tribunal also is of the opinion that this dispute is indeed a dispute between the parties to the Original Arbitration, *i.e.,* Wena and Egypt. It is true that most of the actions by which Wena claims to be adversely affected concern relations which Wena has with EGOTH, as the purported successor of EHC under the Luxor Lease. On the other hand, the Original Tribunal ascertained Egypt\u2019s liability under the IPPA based on Egypt\u2019s own actions and omissions, rather than investigating EHC\u2019s actions and EHC\u2019s status under Egyptian law. Hence, for the purposes of these interpretation proceedings, the Tribunal likewise finds it irrelevant whether EGOTH is the successor of EHC and whether Egypt is responsible for EGOTH\u2019s alleged actions.91 Rather, it is decisive that the dispute as to the meaning of the term \"expropriation\" is a genuine dispute between the parties of the original and the present proceedings, *i.e.,* Wena and Egypt.\n\n*See* Reply Memorial, Section 21.\n\n102.\n\nConsequently, the Tribunal considers that the first condition of the admissibility of the Application provided for in Article 50(1) of the ICSID Convention is met, *i*. *e*., the existence of a dispute between the parties relating to the meaning of the Award.\n\n**b. The Purpose of Interpretation**\n------------------------------------\n\n103.\n\nAs already mentioned in Section 76 above, the second condition for the admissibility of a request for interpretation is that the purpose of the request must be to obtain an \"interpretation\" of the award. The Tribunal is mindful that the admissibility of an application for interpretation has to be balanced against the principle that an ICSID award is final and binding on the parties to the dispute. This, again, is in line with the findings of the ICJ in the *Asylum Case,*92 where the Court stated the following in connection with the purpose of an interpretation:\n\n*\"The real purpose of the request must be to obtain an interpretation of the judgment. This signifies that its object must be solely to obtain clarification of the meaning and the scope of what the Court has decided with binding force, and not to obtain an answer to questions not so decided. Any other construction of Article 60 of the Statute would nullify the provision of the article that the judgment is final and without appeal.*\"\n\n*Colombia v. Peru, supra* footnote 50, p. 402.\n\n104.\n\nAccordingly, the purpose of an interpretation is to obtain a clarification of the meaning or scope of an award. It cannot be invoked for the purpose of obtaining an answer or ruling regarding points which were not settled with binding force in the underlying decision. In this connection, the Court of Arbitration, in the *Delimitation of the Continental Shelf Case*, held:\n\n*\"At the same time, account has to be taken of the nature and limits of the right to request from a Court an interpretation of its decision. \u2018Interpretation\u2019 is a process that is merely auxiliary, and may serve to explain but may not change what the Court has already settled with binding force as res judicata. It poses the question, what was it that the Court has already settled with binding force in its decision, not the question what ought the Court now decide in the light of fresh facts or fresh arguments. A request for interpretation must, therefore, genuinely relate to the determination of the meaning and scope of the decision, and cannot be used as a means for its \u2018revision\u2019 or \u2018annulment\u2019 processes of a different kind to which different considerations apply.\"93*\n\n*U.K. v. France, supra* footnote 43, pp. 170 *et seq*.\n\n105.\n\nIn the *Chorzow Factory Case*, the PCIJ stated that interpretation must be understood as meaning to give a precise definition of the meaning or scope which the Court intended to give to the judgment in question. It added:\n\n*\"The interpretation adds nothing to the decision, which has acquired the force of res judicata and can only have binding force within the limits of what was decided in the judgment construed.\"94*\n\n*Chorz\u00f3w Factory, supra* footnote 54, p. 21.\n\n106.\n\nThus, the purpose of interpretation is to enable the Tribunal to clarify points which had been settled with binding force in the award, without deciding new points which go beyond the limits of the award.95\n\nSchreuer, *supra* footnote 60, p. 858.\n\n107.\n\nAlso in this regard, it became clear during the oral hearing that the parties agree on these legal principles.96\n\nExcept for the differences mentioned above in Sections 88 *et seq*., the parties declared that there is agreement as to the legal principles and authorities, *see* footnote 72 above.\n\n**3. The Interpretation Issues**\n--------------------------------\n\n**a. Introduction**\n-------------------\n\n108.\n\nWena\u2019s Application for Interpretation concerns the Original Tribunal\u2019s finding in the operative section of the Award that:\n\n*\"\u2026 Egypt breached its obligations to Wena by failing to accord Wena\u2019s investments in Egypt fair and equitable treatment and full protection and security in violation of Article 2(2) of the IPPA,*\n\n*...Egypt\u2019s actions amounted to an expropriation without prompt, adequate and effective compensation in violation of Article 5 of the IPPA.\"*97\n\n*See* Award, Sections 134 and 135.\n\n109.\n\nAs pointed out above, Wena - in the first branch of its Application - requests an interpretation of the Tribunal\u2019s determination that Egypt expropriated Wena\u2019s rights in the Luxor Lease and deprived Wena of its \"fundamental rights of ownership\" addressing, in particular, whether the expropriation constituted a total, permanent deprivation of Wena\u2019s rights in the Luxor Lease as well as a confirmation that the expropriation took place as of April 1, 1991, and that the result of the expropriation is such as to preclude subsequent legal actions by Egypt that presume the contrary.\n\n110.\n\nThe Tribunal is of the opinion that the issues addressed in the first part of Wena\u2019s Application are within the purpose of interpretation.\n\n**b. The First Branch of Wena\u2019s Request for Interpretation: The Total and Permanent Character of the Expropriation of Wena\u2019s Rights; the Date of such Expropriation; and the Consequences of the Expropriation for Egypt\u2019s Actions**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n111.\n\nThe first branch of Wena\u2019s request for an interpretation of the Tribunal\u2019s determination that Egypt expropriated Wena\u2019s rights in the Luxor Lease and deprived Wena of its \"fundamental rights of ownership\" contains three points: (i) whether the expropriation constituted a total and permanent deprivation of Wena\u2019s rights in the Luxor Lease; (ii) whether the expropriation took place as of April 1, 1991; and (iii) clarification that the result of the expropriation is such as to preclude subsequent legal actions by Egypt that presume the contrary.\n\n112.\n\nTurning to the first point, the Tribunal observes that the Award nowhere states that Egypt expropriated Wena\u2019s \"rights in the Luxor Lease.\" Rather, the Award consistently refers to Wena\u2019s \"investments\" and states that Egypt\u2019s actions amounted to the expropriation of Wena\u2019s \"investments.\"98\n\n*See*, for example, Section 77 of the Award; here the Tribunal considered the IPPA to be the primary source of applicable law for the arbitration (Section 78 of the Award). Under Article 2(1) of the IPPA, Egypt and the United Kingdom promised to \"encourage and create favourable conditions for nationals or companies of the other Contracting Party to invest capital in its territory (Section 16 of the Award). Indeed, the Tribunal established jurisdiction over Wena on the fact that Claimant has made an investment, that money was spent in the development and renovation of the Hotels and that money was paid by the Claimant, rather than any other party (Section 5 of the Award).\n\n113.\n\nThe Award makes clear that Wena\u2019s investments in question are the capital investments made by Wena in the development and renovation of the Hotels in order to operate the Hotels and to enjoy the benefits thereof in accordance with the Hotel Leases entered into with EHC.\n\n114.\n\nThus, the provisions of the Luxor Lease are summarized at Section 17 of the Award as follows:\n\n*\"Pursuant to the agreement, Wena was to \u2019operate and manage the \u2019Hotel\u2019 exclusively for [its] account through the original or extended period of the \u2019Lease,\u2019 to develop and raise the operating efficiency and standard of the \u2019Hotel\u2019 to an upgraded four star hotel according to the specifications of the Egyptian Ministry of Tourism or upgratly [sic] it to a five star hotel if [Wena] so elects...\u2019. The agreement provided that EHC would not interfere \u2019in the management and/or operation of the \u2019Hotel\u2019 or interfere with the enjoyment of the lease\u2019 by Wena [\u2026].\"99*\n\nIn Section 18 of the Award, the Tribunal noted that the Nile Lease was almost identical to the Luxor Lease.\n\n115.\n\nIn the Original Arbitration, Wena had claimed that \"*Egypt violated the IPPA,**Egyptian law and international law by expropriating Wena\u2019s investment without**compensation.\"*100\n\n*See* Award, Section 75.\n\n116.\n\nEgypt had responded that Wena \"*cannot [\u2026] claim compensation for the alleged loss of leasehold interests [\u2026].\"*101\n\n*Id.,* Section 76.\n\n117.\n\nThe Original Tribunal disagreed. It reviewed the legal theory of expropriation, as follows:\n\n*\"It is also well established that an expropriation is not limited to tangible property rights. As the panel in SPP v. Egypt explained, \u2019there is considerable authority for the proposition that contract rights are entitled to the protection of international law and that the taking of such rights involves an obligation to make compensation therefore.\u2019 Similarly, Chamber Two of the Iran* - *U.S. Claims Tribunal observed in the Tippets case that \u2018[a] deprivation or taking of property may occur under international law through interference by a state in the use of that property or with the enjoyment of its benefits, even where legal title to the property is not affected.\u2019 The chamber continued by noting: \u2019while assumption of control over property by a government does not automatically and immediately justify a conclusion that the property has been taken by the government, thus requiring compensation under international law, such a conclusion is warranted whenever events demonstrate that the owner has been deprived of fundamental rights of ownership and it appears that this deprivation is not merely ephemeral.\"*102\n\n*Id.*, Section 98.\n\n118.\n\nIn its reasoning, the Original Tribunal therefore concluded that:\n\n*\"[it] had no difficulty in finding that the actions. described constitute such an expropriation. Whether or not it authorized or participated in the actual seizures of the Hotels, Egypt deprived Wena of its \u2018fundamental rights of**ownership\u2019 by allowing EHC forcibly to seize the Hotels, to possess them illegally for nearly a year, and to return the Hotels stripped of much of their furniture and fixtures. Egypt has suggested that this deprivation was merely \u2018ephemeral\u2019 and therefore did not constitute an expropriation. The Tribunal disagrees. Putting aside various other improper action, allowing an entity (over which Egypt could exert effective control) to seize and illegally possess the Hotels for nearly a year is more than an ephemeral interference \u2019in the use of that property or with the enjoyment of its benefits\u2019.\"*103\n\n*Id.*, Section 99.\n\n119.\n\nThus, taking into account (i) the fact that Egypt allowed EHC to forcibly seize the Hotels on April 1, 1991 (which were not restored to Wena until nearly a year later), (ii) the vandalization of the Hotels and the removal and auction of much of the Nile Hotel\u2019s fixtures and furniture and (iii) the denial of a permanent operating license for the Luxor Hotel and withdrawal of the operating license for the Nile Hotel by the Ministry of Tourism,104 the Original Tribunal concluded that Egypt had deprived Wena of its \"fundamental rights of ownership\",105*i.e.,* in the given case where, as the Tribunal has stated, no tangible property rights but rather leasehold rights are at stake, Wena\u2019s rights to make use of its investments made under the Hotel Leases and to enjoy the benefits thereof in accordance with the Leases.\n\n*Id*., Sections 53, 56, 57 and 92.\n\n*Id.,* Section 99.\n\n120.\n\nIt is true that the Original Tribunal did not explicitly state that such expropriation totally and permanently deprived Wena of its fundamental rights of ownership. However, in assessing the weight of the actions described above, there was no doubt in the Tribunal\u2019s mind that the deprivation of Wena\u2019s fundamental rights of ownership was so profound that the expropriation was indeed a total and permanent one.\n\n121.\n\nIn making its decision, the Original Tribunal knew that on April 28, 1992, Wena had re-entered the Luxor Hotel (*see* section 57 of the Original Award) and operated it from that date until its final eviction on August 14, 1997 (*see* section 62 of the Original Award).106\n\nBy contrast Wena\u2019s management never operated the Nile Hotel again (*see* Award, Section 56).\n\n122.\n\nHowever, this fact had no bearing on the decision since the Tribunal found, as set forth above, that the condition in which the Luxor Hotel was returned to Wena was so poor and the conditions under which it could be operated during these years were so unsatisfactory, as compared to the situation prior to the seizure, that the temporary re-entry and continued operation of the Luxor Hotel by Wena from 1992 to 1997 did not counter the finding that Egypt\u2019s actions amounted to an expropriation.\n\n123.\n\nThat the expropriation was meant to constitute a total and permanent deprivation of Wena\u2019s investments is also reflected by the method the Tribunal used to calculate the compensation awarded. The Tribunal based its compensation award on Wena\u2019s actual investments in the two Hotels, in essence returning to Wena its total investment, and adding interest at the rate of 9 % compounded quarterly from the date of expropriation to the date of the award. This interest rate was deemed appropriate by reference to long-term investments, *i.e.,* government bonds, in Egypt. In granting this compensation, the Tribunal disregarded Wena\u2019s re-entry and temporary operation of the Hotels subsequent to April 1, 1991. It considered the expropriation of Wena\u2019s rights to be total and permanent.\n\n124.\n\nRegarding the second point, even though the Original Tribunal did not state so expressly in the Award, it is also clear that such expropriation occurred as of April 1, 1991. The Original Tribunal calculated the compensation pursuant to Article 5 of the IPPA, *i.e.,* by awarding compensation amounting to the market value of the investments expropriated immediately before the expropriation.107 The \"*dies a quo*\" on which the Original Tribunal based its calculation was indeed April 1, 1991.108 Hence, the date Wena\u2019s investments were expropriated is April 1, 1991.\n\n*See* Award, Sections 118 and 125.\n\nAlso the Committee held that April 1, 1991 appeared implicitly as the \"*dies a quo*\" from the Tribunal\u2019s statement with respect to the day when the expropriation of Wena\u2019s rights occurred; *see* Section 98 of the copy of the Decision of the *ad hoc* committee dated February 5, 2002, attached to the Application as Annex 2.\n\n125.\n\nFinally, as to the consequences of the expropriation on Egypt\u2019s alleged actions towards Wena following the Award, even though this had not been expressed in the Award, it is clear that Egypt, as a party to the original proceedings and the present interpretation proceedings, is indeed precluded from legal actions that would presume the contrary of the Tribunal\u2019s determinations in the Award.\n\n126.\n\nTo conclude, the first branch of Wena\u2019s Application for Interpretation shall be granted.\n\n**c. The Second Branch of Wena\u2019s Request for Interpretation: No Further Liabilities as a Consequence of the Expropriation**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n127.\n\nAs to the second branch of Wena\u2019s request for interpretation as it has evolved during the interpretation proceedings, *i.e.,* that a party expropriated from a given right cannot incur any liability associated with that right,109 the Tribunal finds that this Application is outside the scope of the Original Award. Indeed, this issue was not raised at any time during the proceedings between Wena and Egypt leading up to the Award. In those proceedings, the Original Tribunal was only asked to make findings on Wena\u2019s claims that \"*Egypt violated Article 2(2) of the IPPA, and other international norms, by failing to accord Wena\u2019s investments \"fair and equitable treatment\" and \"full protection and security\"* and \"*Egypt\u2019s actions constitute an unlawful expropriation without \u2018prompt, adequate and effective\u2019 compensation in violation of Article 5 of the IPPA, as well as Egyptian law and other international law.*\"110 In order to decide these claims, the Original Tribunal investigated Egypt\u2019s conduct towards Wena relating to the seizures of the Hotels and found Egypt liable under Articles 2(2) and 5 of the IPPA. Therefore, it ordered Egypt to pay compensation to Wena.\n\nApplication, Section 48.\n\n*See* Award, Section 75.\n\n128.\n\nBut besides stating that Egypt\u2019s actions amounted to an expropriation under the IPPA and fixing the compensation to be paid, the Original Tribunal did not decide on any further consequences of the expropriation. In particular, the Original Tribunal did not decide on the consequences of the expropriation on the legal relationships between Wena and third parties.\n\n129.\n\nAs to Wena\u2019s argument that it could not \"*anticipate that it could face rent demands for the very property that it was expropriated from,*\"111 the Tribunal again refers to the purpose of interpretation, namely, to give a clarification of what has been decided with binding force without adding new facts and arguments. It is for the parties in the initial proceedings to present their case and to establish the limits of the Award.\n\n*See* Reply Memorial, Section 42.\n\n130.\n\nThis point of view is in line with international jurisprudence. The Court of Arbitration stated in the *Delimitation of the Continental Shelf Case* that interpretation:\n\n*\"...poses the question, what was it that the Court decided with binding force in its decision, not the question what ought the Court now to decide in the light of fresh facts or fresh arguments.*\"112\n\nand the ICJ stated in the *Asylum Case:*\n\n*... this question was completely left outside the submissions of the Parties. The Judgment in no way decided it, nor could it do so. It was for the Parties to present their respective claims on this point. [\u2026] Interpretation can in no way go beyond the limits of the Judgment, fixed in advance by the Parties themselves in their submissions*.\"113\n\n*U.K. v. France, supra* footnote 43, p. 171.\n\n*Colombia v. Peru, supra* footnote 50, p. 403.\n\n131.\n\nIn the light of the foregoing, the Tribunal finds that the second branch of Wena\u2019s Application for Interpretation falls outside the scope of the interpretation proceedings under Article 50(1) of the ICSID Convention.\n\n**IV. CONCLUSION**\n------------------\n\n132.\n\nThe Tribunal concludes that Wena\u2019s Application for Interpretation is justified regarding the questions whether the expropriation was total and permanent; whether it took effect on April 1, 1991; and whether Egypt is precluded from taking legal actions that presume the contrary. By way of interpretation, the Tribunal finds that the expropriation was a total and permanent deprivation of Wena\u2019s fundamental rights of ownership, *i.e.*, its rights to make use of its investments made under the Luxor Lease and to enjoy the benefits of such investments in accordance with such Lease. The Tribunal finds further that such expropriation was effective as of April 1, 1991 and was such that Egypt, as a party to the proceedings, is precluded from taking legal actions that presume the contrary.\n\n133.\n\nWith regard to the consequences of such expropriation for Wena\u2019s legal relationships with third parties and more generally on the requested interpretation that Wena cannot incur liability to any party in connection with the expropriated rights, the Tribunal finds that this part of the Application is outside the scope of an interpretation proceeding since Wena is seeking to obtain a new ruling on issues not decided with binding force in the Award. Therefore, this branch of Wena\u2019s Application is dismissed.\n\n**V. COSTS AND FEES**\n---------------------\n\n134.\n\nUnder Article 61 (2) of the ICSID Convention, in the absence of agreement by the parties, it is the responsibility of the Tribunal to apportion the charges. As the Tribunal was satisfied that the Application for Interpretation related to certain precise points of dispute between the parties and was filed for interpretation purposes, the Tribunal considers it to be reasonable and fair that Wena bears 50 % and Egypt bears 50 % of the expenses and charges of the ICSID, including the arbitrators\u2019 fees and expenses. As to the parties\u2019 legal costs and fees, the Tribunal deems it to be appropriate that each party takes in charge its own fees and expenses.\n\n**VI. THE OPERATIVE PART**\n--------------------------\n\n135.\n\nFor these reasons,\n\nTHE ARBITRAL TRIBUNAL, unanimously,\n\n136.\n\nDECLARES the Application for Interpretation of the Award by Wena to be admissible as far as it relates to the question whether the expropriation constituted a total and permanent deprivation of Wena\u2019s fundamental rights of ownership as of April 1, 1991, and whether Egypt is precluded from taking legal actions that presume the contrary;\n\n137.\n\nDECLARES, by way of interpretation of the Award, that (i) the term \"expropriation\" used in Section 135 of the Award in connection with the awarding of damages and interest to Wena in Section 136 of the Award is to be understood to mean that the expropriation constituted a total and permanent deprivation of Wena\u2019s fundamental rights of ownership, *i.e.*, its rights to make use of its investments made under the Luxor Lease and to enjoy the benefits of such investments in accordance with such Lease; (ii) said expropriation occurred as of April 1, 1991; and (iii) subsequent legal actions by Egypt, as a party to the arbitration, that presume the contrary are precluded.\n\n138.\n\nDECLARES the Application for Interpretation of the Award by Wena to be inadmissible as far as it relates to the consequences of the expropriation on Wena\u2019s legal relationships with third parties.\n\n139.\n\nDECLARES that Wena and Egypt shall each bear 50 % of the arbitration costs; and that each party shall take in charge its own legal fees and expenses."}]}
