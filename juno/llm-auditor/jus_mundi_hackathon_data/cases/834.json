INTRODUCTION**\n-------------------\n\n**A. Request for Arbitration and Constitution of the Tribunal**\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1.\n\nOn May 28, 2010, OPIC Karimum Corporation (Panama) (\"OPIC\" or \"Claimant\") filed a Request for Arbitration under the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States (\"Convention\") against the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela.\n\n2.\n\nOn June 16, 2010, the Secretary-General of ICSID registered the Request for Arbitration pursuant to Article 36(3) of the Convention.\n\n3.\n\nIn its Request for Arbitration, Claimant proposed that the Tribunal be composed of three arbitrators pursuant to Article 37(2)(b) of the Convention, one appointed by Claimant, one appointed by Respondent, and the president of the tribunal appointed by the agreement of the parties.\n\n4.\n\nAbsent an agreement between the Parties with respect to a method of appointment, Claimant, by letter of August 17, 2010, informed the Centre that, under Rule 2(3) of the ICSID Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings (\"Arbitration Rules\"), it elected the formula provided for in Article 37(2)(b) of the Convention. In its letter, Claimant appointed Professor Guido Santiago Tawil, an Argentine national, as arbitrator.\n\n5.\n\nOn August 18, 2010, the Secretariat informed the Parties that Professor Guido Tawil had accepted his appointment and circulated a copy of his signed Arbitration Rule 6(2) declaration dated August 17, 2010.\n\n6.\n\nOn September 14, 2010, Respondent appointed Professor Philippe Sands, a national of the United Kingdom and France, as arbitrator. On September 23, 2010, the Secretariat informed the Parties that Professor Sands had accepted his appointment and circulated a copy of his signed Arbitration Rule 6(2) declaration and attached statement.\n\n7.\n\nBy letter of October 4, 2010, Claimant sought clarification of two points contained in Professor Sands\u2019 Arbitration Rule 6(2) declaration regarding: (i) his appointments by Respondent\u2019s counsel, Curtis Mallet-Prevost, Colt & Mosle LLP; and (ii) his appointments by Respondent, Venezuela. On October 5, 2010, Professor Sands responded to Claimant\u2019s queries.\n\n8.\n\nIn the absence of an agreement between the parties about the president of the tribunal, on November 30, 2010, the Secretary-General informed the parties that she intended to propose to the Chairman that he appoint Professor Doug Jones, a national of Australia and a member of the ICSID Panel of Arbitrators designated by Australia, as the president of the tribunal. Neither party having indicated that it had a compelling objection to the appointment of Professor Jones, on December 29, 2010, the Secretary-General confirmed that the Chairman would proceed with his appointment.\n\n9.\n\nThe parties were informed on 5 January 2011, that the three arbitrators had accepted their appointments as arbitrators and that, therefore, pursuant to Arbitration Rule 6, as of that date, the Tribunal was deemed constituted and the proceeding to have begun. A copy of Professor Jones\u2019 Arbitration Rule 6,2) declaration was circulated to the Parties.\n\n**B. Professor Sands\u2019 Arbitration Rule 6(2) Declaration**\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n10.\n\nProfessor Sands attached a statement to his Arbitration Rule 6(2) declaration of September 21, 2010. In that statement, Professor Sands disclosed the following:\n\n\"To the best of my knowledge I am not aware of any past or present professional, business or other relationship with the Claimant or Respondent.\n\nWithin the past three years I have been appointed to serve as arbitrator in two other ICSID cases by a party that is represented by the law firm Curtis Mallet-Prevost, Colt & Mosle LLP. Both cases are pending.\n\nWithin the past three years I have been appointed to serve as arbitrator by the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela in two related cases, neither of which is currently pending: in the first case (under the arbitration rules of Nova Scotia) the tribunal has not been fully constituted and appears to be dormant, in the other (under the UNCITRAL Rules) the tribunal ruled by unanimous decision that it did not have jurisdiction.\n\nSince first accepting appointment as arbitrator in an ICSID case, in 2007, I have declined to accept any new instructions to act as counsel in any new investment treaty arbitration brought under the ICSID Convention.\n\nI am not aware of any circumstance that might cause my reliability for independent judgment to be questioned by a party.\"\n\n**C. Request to Disqualify Professor Sands**\n--------------------------------------------\n\n11.\n\nOn October 18, 2010, prior to the constitution of the Tribunal, Claimant requested the disqualification of Professor Sands pursuant to Arbitration Rule 9(1), on grounds that Professor Sands\u2019 appointments by Curtis, Mallet-Prevost, Colt & Mosle LLP and Venezuela \"taint his independence in this matter and indicate a manifest lack of Professor Sands\u2019 ability to be relied on for independent judgement as required under Articles 14(1) and 57 of the ICSID Convention.\"1\n\nClaimant\u2019s Proposal to Disqualify Professor Sands dated October 18 (\"Original PTD\"), p. 1.\n\n12.\n\nBy letter of January 5, 2011, following the constitution of the Tribunal, the Secretary-General invited Claimant to confirm whether it intended to pursue its proposal to disqualify Professor Sands. On January 17, 2011, Claimant confirmed its intention to pursue its proposal to disqualify Professor Sands and submitted an amended copy of its October 18, 2010 letter that was revised to reflect: (1) that information in the earlier letter \"concerning the proposed unification of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela and the Republic of Bolivia was incorrect;\" and (2) \"to reflect additional information that has come to OPIC\u2019s attention in the interim concerning the connection and affiliation between Bolivia and Venezuela.\"\n\n13.\n\nOn January 20, 2011, the President of the Tribunal, having consulted with Professor Tawil, set a timetable for the parties to submit observations and Professor Sands to furnish an explanation as provided for under Arbitration Rule 9, as follows:\n\n\u2022 February 4, 2011\u2014Respondent to submit a reply to Claimant\u2019s disqualification proposal;\n\n\u2022 February 18, 2011\u2014Professor Sands to furnish any explanation; and\n\n\u2022 March 2, 2011\u2014The Parties to submit any further observations, including comments arising from Professor Sands\u2019 explanation.\n\n14.\n\nUpon request by the Claimant, Professors Jones and Tawil extended the time for the filing of Claimant\u2019s final observations to 9 March 2011. Subject to this extension, each of the Parties filed submissions regarding the proposal to disqualify and Professor Sands furnished an explanation within the time limits established in the letter of January 20, 2011.\n\n**II. THE PARTIES\u2019 SUBMISSIONS AND PROFESSOR SANDS\u2019 EXPLANATION**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**A. Claimant\u2019s Submissions**\n-----------------------------\n\n15.\n\nClaimant asserts that the standards under Articles 14 and 57 of the Convention require that arbitrators be both impartial and independent.2 In Claimant\u2019s view, the requirement of impartiality implies the \u2018\"absence of a bias or predisposition toward one of the parties.\u2019\"3\n\nClaimant\u2019s Amended Proposal to Disqualify Professor Sands dated 17 Jan. 2011 (\"Amended PTD\"), p. 3. Claimant\u2019s Further Observations Concerning Its Proposal to Disqualify Professor Sands dated Mar. 9, 2011 (\"Claimant\u2019s Further Observations\"), p. 3.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Further Observations, pp. 3-4.\n\n16.\n\nClaimant alleges that it is not necessary to prove an actual bias or conflict of interest; rather, in Claimant\u2019s view, \"[w]hat matters is that the *appearance* of bias or of a conflict is sufficient in the eyes of a reasonable, informed third person that is in the position of the party challenging the arbitrator.\"4 Claimant further asserts that [r]easonable doubt\u2019 regarding the arbitrator\u2019s independence or impartiality is therefore sufficient to meet the manifest standard...\",5\n\n*Id.,* p. 4. *See also* Amended PTD, p. 3; Claimant\u2019s Further Observations, p. 12.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Further Observations, p. 5.\n\n17.\n\nClaimant references the standards set forth in the International Bar Association Guidelines on Conflicts of Interest in International Arbitration dated May 22, 2004 (\"IBA Guidelines\").6 Claimant acknowledges that the IBA Guidelines do not have binding status, but submits that they provide persuasive authority, including in ICSID arbitrations.7 Claimant relies, in particular, on Sections 3.1.3 and 3.3.7 of the IBA Guidelines\u2019 \"Orange List.\"8 Section 3.1.3 provides that justifiable doubts about an arbitrator\u2019s impartiality or independence may arise where an arbitrator has been appointed by a party in two or more instances within the last three years. Section 3.3.7 provides that such doubts may also arise when an arbitrator has received more than three appointments by the same counsel within the past three years.\n\nAmended PTD, p. 4; Claimant\u2019s Further Observations, pp. 5-7.\n\nAmended PTD, pp. 3-5; Claimant\u2019s Further Observations, pp. 5-7.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Further Observations, p. 6.\n\n**1. Professor Sands\u2019 Alleged Relationship with Respondent and Respondent\u2019s Counsel**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n18.\n\nClaimant alleges that Professor Sands:\n\n\u2022 \"currently is sitting in **six (6)** pending ICSID cases, of which he has received **three (3)** of his appointments from the Curtis Mallet law firm;\n\n\u2022 has sat in **eight (8)** treaty arbitrations as a whole in the last three years, of which **five (5)** appointments have come from the Respondent or the Curtis Mallet firm;\n\n\u2022 discloses publicly only **nine (9)** total arbitrations in which he has sat, of which **five (5)** appointments have come from the Respondent or the Curtis Mallet firm.\"9\n\n*Id.,* pp. 1-2. *See also* Amended PTD, p. 3.\n\n19.\n\nClaimant argues that Professor Sands\u2019 appointment in this case \"would be on the threshold of exceeding the \u2018Orange List\u2019 guidelines on an individual basis and,10 when viewed in combination, as is appropriate under the circumstances in light of the many points of connection between Professor Sands and the Respondent and its counsel, the proposed appointment in effect exceeds the \u2018Orange List\u2019 threshold, giving rise to justifiable doubts that would lead an informed, reasonable person to conclude that the appointment is inappropriate under the circumstances.\"11\n\nClaimant acknowledges that a situation falling within Section 3.3.7 is not in issue because Professor Sands has not been appointed more than three times in three years by Curtis, Mallet-Prevost, Colt & Mosle LLP. *See* Claimant\u2019s Further Observations, p. 6.\n\nAmended PTD, p. 4. *See also* Claimant\u2019s Further Observations, pp. 6-7.\n\n20.\n\nSpecifically Claimant claims that \"\"[i]f Professor Sands is permitted to continue to sit as an arbitrator in this proceeding, he will have been appointed in five (5) arbitration proceedings within the last three years by either the Curtis Mallet firm or by Respondent, which represents more than half of his publicly disclosed appointments. Moreover, this represents six (6) instances of appointments of Professor Sands by either Respondent or the Curtis Mallet firm.\"12\n\nClaimant\u2019s Further Observations, p. 7.\n\n21.\n\nClaimant argues that \"Respondent would like the Tribunal to ignore the mathematics involved because they are not in its favour, the fact remains that multiple appointments by the same party or counsel create a potential for undue influence and for an unfair advantage for the appointing party or counsel.\"13 Claimant alleges that \"[t]hese appointments suggest that there is, at a minimum, an ongoing professional and business relationship between Professor Sands and the Curtis Mallet firm as well as a prior relationship between Professor Sands and the Respondent. In particular, Professor Sands cannot be relied upon to exercise independent judgment because he is beholden to the Respondent and the Respondent\u2019s law firm for a significant number of his arbitration appointments (and therefore presumably his compensation)...\".14\n\n*See also* Claimant\u2019s Further Observations, p. 7. Claimant distinguishes the cases cited by Respondent to support its case that Claimant\u2019s challenge should fail because allegedly the arbitrator challenged in those cases had fewer relevant appointments. *See* Claimant\u2019s Further Observations, pp. 8-9. In particular, Claimant distinguishes the proposal to disqualify Professor Sands in *Tidewater Inc. v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela,* ICSID Case No. ARB/10/5, Decision to Disqualify Professor Brigitte Stem, Arbitrator dated Dec. 23, 2010 *(\"Tidewater\")* (alleging that *Tidewater* (i) involved fewer appointments by Venezuela and the relevant law firm, (ii) those appointments were made over a longer period, and (iii) that Professor Stem has \"nearly **four** times as many investment treaty arbitration appointments as Professor Sands.\") *See* Claimant\u2019s Further Observations, pp. 8-9.\n\nAmended PTD, p. 2. *See also* Claimant\u2019s Further Observations, p. 2.\n\n22.\n\nIn particular, Claimant relies on four criteria used in *Suez,* which it alleges show that the alleged connections between Professor Sands and Respondent give rise to a manifest lack of independence and impartiality, as follows:15\n\n(1) *The proximity of the connection.*\n\nClaimant asserts that, by virtue of his appointments, \"the connection between Professor Sands and the Respondent and its counsel is direct.\"16\n\n(2) *The intensity or frequency of any interactions.*\n\nClaimant asserts that \"the alleged connection demonstrates a frequency of interaction and contact between Professor Sands and the Respondent or its counsel...\".17 \"Professor Sands appears to rely on the Respondent or its counsel for a substantial amount of his arbitration appointments.\"18 The \"proximity and intensity/frequency criteria therefore suggest that Professor Sands would have a compelling reason to be partial towards Respondent\u2019s positions in this arbitration.\"19\n\n(3) *The degree of dependence of an arbitrator upon a party for any benefits.*\n\nClaimant acknowledges that the two cases in which Professor Sands was appointed by Venezuela have concluded or are inactive.20 Notwithstanding, Claimant alleges that, by virtue of his appointments by Respondent or its counsel, \"Professor Sands derives a direct and financial benefit or advantage from, and appears to be dependent on the Respondent or its counsel as a result of the alleged connections.\"21 Further, Claimant argues that \"it stands to reason that his financial compensation as an ICSID arbitrator is sufficiently impacted by the repeated appointments by the Respondent and the Curtis Mallet firm.\"22 Claimant asserts that this \"creates the appearance of dependence as well as creates a financial incentive - and thus a concern that he cannot be *\u2018relied upon to exercise independent judgment\"23*\n\nClaimant alleges that \"these facts suggest the possibility of a dependence or conflict... inasmuch as the possibility exists that Professor Sands has a financial incentive to continue to make decisions that benefit clients of the Curtis Mallet firm, including Respondent, to ensure that he will be selected by that firm and its clients as an arbitrator in future matters.\"24 Claimant asserts that the \"cluster of appointments by Respondents and the Curtis Mallet firm and the accompanying financial and other incentives\" \"give[s] rise to justifiable doubts with respect to his ability to reach a free and independent judgment, threatening the Claimant\u2019s right to legal security.\"25\n\nClaimant acknowledges Professor Sands\u2019 statement that he acts as an arbitrator in non-ICSID cases that cannot be disclosed. However, Claimant argues that \"OPIC cannot be expected to meaningfully evaluate, speculate or guess how many arbitral appointments have not been disclosed.... OPIC\u2019s assertion that Professor Sands lacks independence or impartiality is therefore based on and restricted to Professor Sands\u2019 disclosed or public appointments.\"26\n\n(4) *The materiality or significance of any such benefits.*\n\nClaimant argues that \"the connections are material to and significantly affect the compensation that Professor Sands earns as an arbitrator, particularly given his statement concerning his withdrawal as counsel in ICSID arbitrations...\".27\n\nClaimant contends that in evaluating the materiality of the income received from appointments by Respondent or Curtis, Mallet-Prevost, Colt & Mosle LLP, \"[a]ny undisclosed cases and assertions as to the income derived from them, must remain outside the consideration of the unchallenged arbitrators.\"28\n\nAmended PTD, p. 5.\n\nId., p. 5.\n\nAmended PTD, p. 5.\n\n*Id.*\n\n*Id.*\n\nAmended PTD, p. 6.\n\n*Id.,* p. 5.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Further Observations, p. 2.\n\nAmended PTD, p. 6.\n\n*Id.*\n\nClaimant\u2019s Further Observations, p. 3. Claimant also alleges that the appointments at issue are \"particularly problematic because Professor Sands identifies that he no longer acts as counsel in ICSID arbitrations, given the financial implications of that decision. Where an arbitrator also accepts appointments as counsel in ICSID proceedings, the majority of that individual\u2019s compensation can be expected to be derived from acting as counsel. Such professionals, therefore, are independent from any fees received from serving as arbitrators. On the other hand, where an ICSID arbitrator\u2019s career is focused on serving as an arbitrator, given the financial (and other) implications, clusters of appointment by a particular law firm or party must be viewed with great caution and skepticism and may lead to the appearance of a lack of independence and impartiality.\" *See* Amended PTD p. 2. Relatedly, Claimant alleges that \"Professor Sands appears to derive a substantial amount of his income from his ICSID arbitration appointments.\" *See* Amended PTD, p. 9.\n\n*See* Claimant\u2019s Further Observations, pp. 8-9.\n\nAmended PTD, p. 6.\n\n*See* Claimant\u2019s Further Observations, p. 10.\n\n**2. Venezuela\u2019s Relationship With Bolivia**\n--------------------------------------------\n\n23.\n\nClaimant asserts that \"the substantial financial support provided by Venezuela to Bolivia and the considerable influence of the Venezuelan government on Bolivia... creates the appearance of a very close connection and affiliation between Bolivia and Venezuela.\" Claimant acknowledges that \"the information about financial support is based on insufficiently detailed information,\"29 but relies on the following assertions in support of its contention:\n\n\u2022 \"Venezuela is financing and supporting the Republic of Bolivia in its nationalization plans, especially with regard to the oil industry...,\" as well as financing other projects.30\n\n\u2022 According to cables obtained by Wikileaks, \"Venezuela generally was interfering with Bolivia\u2019s internal affairs.\"31\n\n\u2022 Venezuela and Bolivia are among a group of nations that agreed to implement a single regional currency called the \"Sucre.\"32\n\nAmended PTD, p. 8.\n\nId., pp. 6-7.\n\n*Id., p.* 7.\n\n*Id.*\n\n24.\n\nClaimant asserts that this affiliation between Venezuela and Bolivia \"means that another ICSID case in which Professor Sands was appointed by Bolivia within the last three years should count as an additional connection point between him and the Respondent.\"33\n\n*Id.* p. 8.\n\n25.\n\nIn conclusion, Claimant asserts that \"[i]n a situation such as this one where 50% (or even 2/3rds when one considers the connection between Bolivia and Venezuela) of an arbitrator\u2019s appointments stem from one law firm and one state,\"34 there is a substantial appearance of dependence on Respondent and its counsel.\" This allegedly \"indicates a manifest lack of the qualities required by paragraph (1) of Article 14...\".35\n\n*Id.*\n\n*Id.*\n\n**B. Respondent\u2019s Submissions**\n-------------------------------\n\n26.\n\nRespondent contends that under Articles 14 and 57 of the Convention, the standard applicable to proposals for disqualification in ICSID proceedings is the \"manifest\" lack of independence or impartiality. Respondent further asserts that \"[a] proposal for disqualification must be based on objective facts which, from the point of view of a reasonable and informed third person, evidently and clearly show a manifest lack of the qualities described above.\"36\n\nRespondent\u2019s Answer to Claimant\u2019s Proposal to Disqualify Professor Sands dated Feb. 4, 2011 (\"Answer to PTD\"), pp. 2-3, 6-7.\n\n27.\n\nRespondent contends that the IBA Guidelines \"are only a guide, and are not mandatory in ICSID proceedings.\"37 Respondent also contends that, even if a situation falls within the Orange List, disqualification is not automatic.38 It is also necessary for other objective elements to exist \"which, in the eyes of a reasonable and informed third party, evidently show that the arbitrator in question lacks independence or impartiality.\"39\n\n*Id., p.* 3.\n\nId., pp. 3,7\n\n*Id., p.* 4.\n\n**1. Professor Sands\u2019 Alleged Relationship with Respondent and Respondent\u2019s Counsel**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n28.\n\nIn Respondent\u2019s view, \"[i]t is clear that there is no objective evidence whatsoever that can lead an independent and informed third party to conclude that it is clear, evident and obvious that Professor Sands\u2019 independence and impartiality should be questioned by virtue of the[] appointments.\"40\n\n*Id., p.* 11.\n\n29.\n\nAs an initial matter, Respondent asserts that Claimant inflates the percentage of Professor Sands\u2019 appointments by Respondent and Curtis, Mallet-Prevost, Colt & Mosle LLP \"to its convenience.\"41 Respondent notes that of the seven ICSID cases in which Professor Sands was designated, \"he was appointed by Respondent or by Curtis\u2019 clients on only three occasions (in two by Curtis\u2019 clients and in one, *OPIC,* by Respondent) - and not four.\"42 Accordingly, \"if the purpose is to determine the real percentage of ICSID cases in which Respondent or Curtis\u2019 clients have appointed Professor Sands as arbitrator, that percentage would be 42%,\"43 and not 50% or nearly 50%. Respondent also asserts that Claimant, when taking into account the number of appointments disclosed by Professor Sands, \"exaggerates its arguments by counting a single appointment twice.\"44\n\n*Id., p.* 4.\n\n*Id., p.* 6.\n\nId., pp. 4-5.\n\nAnswer to PTD, p. 6.\n\n30.\n\nRespondent argues that, in any event, \"[t]he artificial use of percentages does not constitute objective evidence for determining whether a person enjoys the qualities required to serve as arbitrator in an ICSID proceeding...\".45\n\n*Id., p.* 5.\n\n31.\n\nRespondent argues that Claimant creates a new situation that is not contained in the IBA Guidelines and \"confuses the origin of the appointments by adding the cases in which Respondent and Curtis\u2019 clients have appointed Professor Sands in arbitral proceedings in general.\"46 Respondent also contends that \"[t]o support this argument, Claimant speculates - without any real knowledge - that Professor Sands is not participating in any other arbitral proceedings that are not public or that have not been disclosed by Professor Sands in his declaration...\".47\n\n*Id..*\n\n*Id.*\n\n32.\n\nRespondent states that, even if the situation at hand falls within Section 3.1.3 of the IBA Guidelines\u2019 Orange List\u2014through the appointment of Professor Sands by Venezuela in the Nova Scotia commercial arbitration and in the related UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules case\u2014\"this does not prove anything beyond the fact that a situation triggering disclosure exists.\"48 Respondent contends that Claimant \"offers no other objective fact or evidence that may lead a reasonable and informed third party to conclude that it is clear, obvious and evident that, as a result of Professor Sands\u2019 appointments by Respondent and Curtis\u2019 clients in prior proceedings, one must doubt his impartiality or independence in the present case. On the other hand, objective facts prove that Professor Sands\u2019 actions in those cases, and in others where he has participated, have been totally independent and impartial.\"49\n\n*Id., p.* 7.\n\n*Id.*\n\n33.\n\nRespondent alleges that Claimant makes \"injurious speculations,\"50 but fails to offer any objective evidence that Professor Sands has a financial incentive to continue to make decisions that benefit clients of the Curtis Mallet firm, including Respondent, to ensure that he will be selected by that firm and its clients as an arbitrator in future matters.51 Respondent contends that \"ICSID tribunals have previously dismissed similar speculations in proposals for disqualification.\"52\n\n*Id., p.* 8.\n\nAnswer to PTD, pp. 8, 10-11.\n\n*Id., p.* 8.\n\n34.\n\nRespondent contends that \"it is entirely inappropriate to make accusations pointing to the existence of \u2018financial incentives\u2019 without any objective evidence.\"53 Respondent claims that, in any event, \"[t]here is clear evidence to conclude that Professor Sands does not depend economically on Respondent\u2019s and/or Curtis\u2019 appointments.\"54 In particular, Respondent notes Professor Sands\u2019 other professional activities referred to in his *curriculum vitae* and asserts that \"[w]e cannot but assume that Professor Sands receives economic remuneration for activities other than his participation as an arbitrator in ICSID cases.\"\n\n*Id., p.* 9.\n\n*Id.*\n\n35.\n\nRespondent states that Section 3.3.7 of the IBA Guidelines\u2019 Orange List is not applicable because clients of Curtis, Mallet-Prevost, Colt & Mosle LLP have not appointed Professor Sands as an arbitrator in more than three cases;55 Respondent states that, in fact, Claimant acknowledges this to be the case.56\n\n*Id.,* p. 10 (noting that Professor Sands has been appointed by clients represented by Curtis, Mallet-Prevost, Colt & Mosle LLP in three cases).\n\n*Id.* (\"[A]lthough Claimant resorts to Section 3.3.7 of the Orange List as a basis for its Proposal, it acknowledges that such scenario has not materialized, forcing it to create a new scenario which is not contemplated in the Guidelines - nor in any other source of law - to support its groundless Proposal.\")\n\n36.\n\nRespondent disputes Claimant\u2019s contention that the four criteria used in *Suez* are met here. Specifically:\n\n(1) *The proximity of the connection.*\n\nRespondent asserts that any connection between Professor Sands and Respondent or Curtis \"is limited to his appointment to act as a judge in disputes against third parties.\" Respondent contends that \"[a]s was recently established in an ICSID decision, \u2018... multiple appointments as arbitrator by the same party in unrelated cases are neutral, since in each case the arbitrator exercises the same independent arbitral function\u2019.\"57\n\n(2) *The intensity or frequency of any interactions.*\n\nRespondent states that \"it is untenable to say that the relationship between Respondent and/or Curtis and Professor Sands is \u2018intense\u2019.\"58 The connections with respect to each of Respondent and Curtis are limited to appointments in two cases, in which there was \"an inquiry regarding his availability to serve as arbitrator, and in one of the cases, to the participation via conference call in the tribunal\u2019s first session.\"59\n\n(3) *The degree of dependence of an arbitrator upon a party for any benefits.*\n\nRespondent asserts that \"Claimant has provided absolutely no objective evidence that would lead a reasonable and informed third party to conclude that Professor Sands is financially dependent on Respondent and/or Curtis.\"60\n\n(4) *The materiality or significance of any such benefits.*\n\nRespondent asserts that, \"if all of Professor Sands activities are taken in to account, his participation in two active cases (or three, counting *OPIC)* cannot be considered material.\"61\n\nAnswer to PTD, p. 11 (citing *Tidewater* \u00b6 60).\n\n*Id., p.* 12.\n\n*Id.* (noting that the one of the two cases in which Professor Sands was appointed by Respondent concluded in the jurisdictional phase and the other is inactive; the appointments by clients of Curtis, Mallet-Prevost, Colt & Mosle LLP are in recently initiated cases).\n\n*Id.*\n\n*Id.*\n\n**2. Venezuela\u2019s Relationship With Bolivia**\n--------------------------------------------\n\n37.\n\nRespondent asserts that \"Claimant\u2019s Proposal is based on pure speculations of economic dependence and arguments, without any factual or legal support, that the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela and the Plurinational State of Bolivia are not sovereign and independent States.\"62 According to Respondent, \"the speculations of economic dependence have been completely disproved by Professor Sands in the Comments, and the factual basis used by Claimant to sustain its argument of unification is no more than a bad internet joke made on April Fools\u2019 Day in the Unites [sic] States of America.\"63\n\nRespondent\u2019s Final Observations to Claimant\u2019s Proposal to Disqualify Professor Philippe Sands dated Mar. 9, 2011 (\"Respondent\u2019s Final Observations\") at \u00b6 2.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Final Observations at \u00b6 2. Respondent contends that Claimant\u2019s assertions in Claimant\u2019s Initial PTD that Venezuela and Bolivia had allegedly announced a unification plan\u2014 such that the one appointment of Professor Sands by Bolivia should also be counted for purposes of this proposal to disqualify\u2014were based on \"a spurious and insulting joke\" contained in an article published in the United States on April Fool\u2019s Day. *See* Answer PTD, p. 13.\n\n**C. Professor Sands\u2019 Explanation**\n-----------------------------------\n\n38.\n\nIn his explanation of February 17, 2011, Professor Sands refutes Claimant's factual allegation that he \"cannot be relied upon to exercise independent judgment because he is beholden to the Respondent and the Respondent\u2019s law firm for a significant number of his arbitration appointments (and therefore presumably his compensation).\"64\n\nSands Explanation of Feb. 17, 2011.\n\n39.\n\nSpecifically, Professor Sands confirms that: (i) he is a tenured professor of law at University College, London and in that role receives a salary and pension; (ii) he receives additional income from academic and other writings; (iii) is a practising barrister, in which capacity he acts as counsel in eight of the sixteen cases at the International Court of Justice, as well as in a number of inter-State arbitrations before the Permanent Court of Arbitration and other arbitral institutions, and acts for more than twenty different clients and law firms; (iv) he sits as arbitrator in non-ICSID arbitrations that are not disclosable; (v) he has never been instructed on any matter by the Respondent, or by the law firm that represents it in these proceedings; and (vi) he declines instructions and arbitral appointments in significantly more cases that he accepts.\n\n40.\n\nProfessor Sands also explains that during the calendar year 2010 \"the proportion of [his] total income that was obtained from sitting as an arbitrator was less than 5.89%.\" Accordingly, \"[t]he assertion of being \u2018beholden to the Respondent and the Respondent\u2019s law firm for... compensation\u2019 is not supported by the facts.\"65\n\n*Id.*\n\n41.\n\nAs concerns his two appointments by Respondent, Professor Sands remarks that these appointments relate to the same facts and effectively are the same case as the arbitral tribunal in the case under the arbitration rules of Nova Scotia was never constituted, he never claimed any fee, and it was superseded by the UNCITRAL case in which jurisdiction was rejected unanimously on the basis that the proper forum was ICSID.\n\n42.\n\nProfessor Sands further states that \"the suggestion that Bolivia and Venezuela are not sovereign, independent States is wrong as a matter of law and fact.\"66\n\nSands Explanation of Feb. 17, 2011.\n\n43.\n\nFinally, Professor Sands states that having carefully reviewed the observations of both parties, and having regard to the facts and applicable standards, \"I had no doubts as to my independence or impartiality when accepting appointment..., and I continue to have no doubt today.\"67\n\n*Id.*\n\n**III. ANALYSIS OF THE TWO MEMBERS**\n------------------------------------\n\n44.\n\nIn order for Claimant\u2019s proposal to disqualify Professor Sands to succeed it must establish a manifest lack of ability on his part to exercise independent judgment in this matter.68 As is helpfully pointed out by the learned Tribunal members in *Suez,69* a reading of both the English and Spanish versions of Article 14(1) of the Convention requires that the two standards of independence and impartiality be applied when determining whether Professor Sands manifestly lacks the characteristics of someone who may be relied upon to exercise independent judgment for purposes of the proposal to disqualify him.70\n\nSee Convention, Articles article 14(1) and 57.\n\n*Suez, Sociedad General de Aguas de Barcelona S.A., and InterAguas Servicios Integrales del Agua SA. v. The Argentine Republic,* ICSID Cases No. ARB/03/17 and ARB/03/19, Decision on the Proposal for the Disqualification of a Member of the Arbitral Tribunal, Oct. 22, 2007.\n\n*See Suez* \u00b6 28.\n\n45.\n\nThere thus exists a relatively high burden for those seeking to challenge ICSID arbitrators. The Convention\u2019s requirement that the lack of independence be \"manifest\" necessitates that this lack be clearly and objectively established. Accordingly, it is not sufficient to show an appearance of a lack of impartiality or independence.\n\n46.\n\nDecisions on challenges to ICSID arbitrators based upon multiple appointments of an arbitrator by a party or counsel represent a smaller number of the publicly available challenge decisions, compared to other bases for challenge.\n\n47.\n\nWe have reviewed with interest the decision of the remaining arbitrators on the proposal to disqualify an arbitrator in *Tidewater.71* It is suggested by the arbitrators in that decision that multiple appointments as arbitrator by the same party in unrelated cases are a neutral factor in considerations relevant to a challenge.72 We do not agree. In our opinion, multiple appointments of an arbitrator by a party or its counsel constitute a consideration that must be carefully considered in the context of a challenge. In an environment where parties have the capacity to choose arbitrators, damage to the confidence that investors and States have in the institution of investor-State dispute resolution may be adversely affected by a perception that multiple appointments of the same arbitrator by a party or its counsel arise from a relationship of familiarity and confidence inimical to the requirement of independence established by the Convention. The suggestion by the arbitrators in *Tidewater* that multiple appointments are likely to be explicable on the basis of a party\u2019s perception of the independence and competence of the oft appointed arbitrator is in our view unpersuasive. In a dispute resolution environment, a party\u2019s choice of arbitrator involves a forensic decision that is clearly related to a judgment by the appointing party and its counsel of its prospects of success in the dispute. In our view, multiple appointments of an arbitrator are an objective indication of the view of parties and their counsel that the outcome of the dispute is more likely to be successful with the multiple appointee as a member of the tribunal than would otherwise be the case.\n\n*Tidewater v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela,* ICSID Case No. ARB/10/5, Decision on Claimant\u2019s Proposal to Disqualify Professor Brigitte Stern, Arbitrator, dated Dec. 23, 2010 \u00b6 60.\n\n*Id.*\n\n48.\n\nThat the issue of multiple appointments raises a concern in the context of independence and impartiality was reflected in the IBA Guidelines on Conflicts of Interest in International Arbitration by the Council of the International Bar Association.73 The Orange List of the IBA Guidelines provides a non-exhaustive enumeration of specific situations which\u2014depending upon the facts of a particular case\u2014may give rise to justifiable doubts as to the arbitrator\u2019s impartiality or independence. Disclosure of circumstances falling within the Orange List is required. The Orange List includes circumstances where an arbitrator has within the past three years been appointed as arbitrator on two or more occasions by one of the parties,74 or where the arbitrator has within the past three years received more than three appointments by the same counsel or the same law firm.75 We accept that the IBA Guidelines are not conclusive for the purposes of the decision that we are required to make on this challenge, and that the examples contained in the IBA Guidelines are both non-exhaustive and not in themselves decisive of whether or not the standards set out in the guidelines for impartiality and independence of arbitrators have been met. The IBA Guidelines do, however, indicate that multiple appointments represent an issue relevant to impartiality and independence and, in our opinion, are correct in so doing.76\n\nInternational Bar Association Guidelines on Conflicts of Interest in International Arbitration dated May 22, 2004\n\n*Id.,* section 3.1.3.\n\n*Id.,* section 3.3.7.\n\nIn our view, absent exceptional circumstances, multiple appointments by counsel and parties should be considered separately, not cumulatively.\n\n49.\n\nThat this is the case in international commercial arbitration, in our view, suggests that this requirement of impartiality and independence also applies in investor-State disputes, where the need for independence is at least as great.\n\n50.\n\nWe have, therefore, approached our consideration of Claimant\u2019s proposal to disqualify Professor Sands on the basis that multiple appointments of an arbitrator by a party or its counsel is a factor which\u2014contrary to the view expressed in *Tidewater\u2014* may lead to the conclusion that it is manifest that the arbitrator cannot be relied upon to exercise independent judgment as required by the Convention.\n\n51.\n\nProfessor Sands has had two previous appointments by Respondent but those appointments relate to the same facts and were made in what is effectively the same case. As he explains, the arbitral tribunal in the case under the arbitration rules of Nova Scotia was never constituted and it was superseded by the case under the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules, in which jurisdiction was unanimously rejected on the basis that the proper forum was ICSID. We are, therefore, of the view that the multiple appointments by Respondent of Professor Sands do not present an issue with respect to his independence in this case.\n\n52.\n\nAs we have noted, the examples contained in the IBA Guidelines regarding multiple appointments, and the periods of time within which they are made, are neither binding upon us nor decisive of themselves in determining impartiality or independence under those guidelines. In any event, we do not believe that, in this situation, there is a basis for regarding Respondent\u2019s multiple appointments of Professor Sands alone as sufficient to demonstrate the manifest lack of qualities necessary for Claimant\u2019s proposal to disqualify to succeed.\n\n53.\n\nThis leaves the question of Professor Sands\u2019 appointments by Respondent\u2019s counsel, Curtis, Mallet-Prevost, Colt & Mosle LLP. Here the position is that Professor Sands has been appointed in two unrelated cases involving Turkmenistan. Again, these two appointments by Respondent\u2019s counsel do not in our view reach the level of multiple appointments that would by themselves demonstrate the manifest lack of independence required to be established for a successful proposal to disqualify under the Convention.\n\n54.\n\nThe parties\u2019 submissions in relation to the four criteria set out in the *Suez* case have been considered by us carefully. These are helpful criteria but are of necessity applicable in a variety of circumstances and the utility of their application to a challenge solely based upon multiple appointments is in our view limited.\n\n55.\n\nFurther, we are unpersuaded by Claimant\u2019s submissions regarding the alleged financial dependence of Professor Sands upon either Respondent or Respondent\u2019s counsel. It is clear that Professor Sands has extensive independent income sources unrelated to fees derived from his appointments as arbitrator in investment arbitrations. Even assuming that this criterion could be helpful in making a judgment regarding his independence, the material provided does not establish any significant dependence by him upon income derived from those appointments.\n\n56.\n\nFurther, we are not persuaded that the material provided by Claimant regarding the relationship between Bolivia and Venezuela establishes Claimant\u2019s proposition that appointments of Professor Sands by Bolivia must be considered when assessing his independence or impartiality in this case. Accordingly, we do not regard as relevant any appointment of Professor Sands by Bolivia in unrelated proceedings.\n\n57.\n\nTherefore, we find that Claimant has failed to establish the requisite manifest lack of independence by Professor Sands and conclude that the proposal for disqualification submitted by Claimant must be dismissed.\n\n**IV. DECISION ON THE PROPOSAL TO DISQUALIFY**\n----------------------------------------------\n\n58.\n\nFor the foregoing reasons Claimant\u2019s proposal to disqualify Professor Sands dated January 17, 2011 is dismissed.\n\n59.\n\nThe determination and attribution of costs in connection with this Decision is reserved for decision by the Tribunal at a later stage of the proceedings.\n\n60.\n\nAs from the date hereof, the suspension of the proceeding pursuant to Arbitration Rule 9(6) is hereby terminated."}, {"Title": "Award", "Type": "Award (Final)", "Date": "2013-05-28T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [{"Title": "Dissenting Opinion of Professor Dr. Guido Santiago Tawil", "Type": "Dissenting Opinion", "Date": null, "Content": "Dissenting Opinion of Professor Dr. Guido Santiago Tawil\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n1.\n\nI concur with my distinguished colleagues in several issues discussed in the Award. I join the majority on the general approach adopted on the applicable law and the standard of interpretation. Unfortunately, I am unable to join their conclusions on the interpretation of the evidence produced in this case regarding Venezuela\u2019s consent to ICSID arbitration under Article 22 of the Investment Law.\n\n2.\n\nI agree with my fellow arbitrators that the text of Article 22 allows more than one interpretation and that, by itself, it is insufficient to determine whether the Respondent provided its consent to ICSID arbitration with the Claimant.\n\n3.\n\nI do not share the finding of other tribunals that \"consent should be expressed in a manner that leaves no doubt\".1 Such a requirement would in practical terms limit evidence of consent exclusively to the wording of the text and appears in principle inconsistent with the views of many other tribunals, including those acting in *Mobil* and *Cemex* and related to the interpretation of the very same Article 22 of the Investment Law.2\n\n*Brandes Investment Partners LP* v. *Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela* (ICSID Case No. ARB/08/3) Award (2 August 2011), [113].\n\n*Cemex Caracas Investments B.V. and Cemex Caracas II Investments B.V. v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela* (ICSID Case No. ARB/08/15) Decision on Jurisdiction (30 December 2010), *(\"Cemex\")* [87]; *Mobil Corporation, Venezuela Holdings, B. V, Mobil Cerro Negro Holding, Ltd., Mobil Venezolana de Petr\u00f3leos, Inc. v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela* (ICSID Case No. ARB/07/27) Decision on Jurisdiction (10 June 2010), *(\"Mobil\")* [94].\n\n4.\n\nI am of the view that an offer of consent as the one provided in Article 22 of the Investment Law must be interpreted neither restrictively nor expansively, but rather objectively and in good faith, as stated by the tribunal in *SPP.3* Where the words of the text may be ambiguous in order to determine the intention of the depositing State, the Tribunal may look beyond into the context and the circumstances in which they were formulated.\n\n*Southern Pacific Properties Ltd. v. Arab Republic of Egypt* (ICSID Case No, ARB/84/3) (14 April 1988) [63]. This approach has been also followed by other ICSID tribunals, such as the one acting in Amco v. *Indonesia.* In that case, the tribunal stated: \"In the first place, like any other conventions, a convention to arbitrate is not to be construed restrictively, nor, as a matter of fact, broadly or liberally. It is to be construed in a way which leads to find out and to respect the common will of the parties... Moreover\u2014and this is again a general principle of law\u2014any convention, including conventions to arbitrate, should be construed in good faith, that is to say by taking into account the consequences of their commitments the parties may be considered as having reasonably and legitimately envisaged\". *Amco Asia et al.* v. *Indonesia,* ICSID Case No. ARB/81/1, Decision on Jurisdiction (25 September 1983) (1984) 23 ILM 351, [24].\n\n5.\n\nICSID practice shows that tribunals very rarely limit themselves to only analyze the wording of the provision by means of which the State has provided its consent, even if it raised no doubts. Although wording will ordinarily be the primary source of interpretation in order to determine whether the consent to arbitrate is present or not, tribunals have consistently analyzed the wording of the text together with the State\u2019s intention and purposes and all the circumstances surrounding it.4 This has been the approach adopted by both tribunals in *Mobil5* and *Cemex6,* among many others.\n\nIn the words of the International Court of Justice in the Fisheries Jurisdiction Case (Spain v Canada - ICJ Reports 1998, p. 454), a certain emphasis must be placed on the intention of the depositing State. Thus, the relevant words of a declaration are to be interpreted: \"in a natural and reasonable way, having due regard to the intention of the State concerned... [which] may be deduced not only from the text of the relevant clause, but also from the context in which the clause is to be read, and an examination of evidence regarding the circumstances of its preparation and the purposes intended to be served\". In line with this reasoning, the Pac Rim Tribunal explained that: \"...declarations must be interpreted as they stand, having regard to the words actually used and taking into consideration the intention of the government at the time it made the declaration. Such intention can be inferred from the text, but also from the context, the circumstances of its preparation and the purposes intended to be served by the declaration. In doing so, the relevant words should be interpreted in a natural and reasonable way\". See: *Pac Rim Cayman LCC* v. *The Republic of El Salvador* (ICSID Case No. ARB/09/12), Decision on Jurisdiction (1 June 2012), (\"*Pac Rim\")* para. 5.35.\n\n*Mobil* [94]: \"...Intention can be deduced from the text, but also from the context, the circumstances of its preparation and the purposes intended to be served\".\n\n*Cemex.[87]:* \"The intention of the declaring State must prevail\".\n\n6.\n\nIf such exercise is regularly performed even when the intention is clear7, much more necessary it appears when the wording of the clause is not enough to determine by itself the intent, as happens in the present case. Therefore, I agree with my distinguished colleagues that, in order to decide whether Article 22 of the Investment Law constitutes consent to arbitrate, it is necessary to look beyond the wording of the provision in order to determine Venezuela\u2019s intention when enacting the Investment Law.8\n\n*Pac Rim* [5.37] - [5.39].\n\nAward [107]\n\n7.\n\nI concur with my fellow arbitrators that Mr. Corrales -who did not provide testimony before the *Mobil, Cemex, Brandes* and *Tidewater9* tribunals- was a credible and reliable witness.10 While the Respondent had questioned the absence of Mr. Corrales\u2019 testimony to support the claim for jurisdiction in *Conoco* and *Mobil11,* it did not submit any rebuttal evidence in the present case.\n\n*Tidewater Inc. et al.* v. *The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela* (ICSID Case No. ARB/10/5), Decision on Jurisdiction (8 February 2013) [16]. In the Arbitral Tribunal own words: \"...Concurrently with the filing of their Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, on 29 July 2011, the Claimants made a Request that the Tribunal invite two individuals alleged to have been involved with the drafting of the Investment Law, Ambassador Werner Corrales Leal and Mr Gonzalo Capriles, to appear and testify at the oral phase of the proceedings. Following an exchange of submissions, on 22 September 2011, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 3. It declined the Claimants\u2019 request on the ground that, within the framework of the ICSID Convention, the preparation and presentation of evidence is the responsibility of the parties and not that of the Tribunal\".\n\nAward [112].\n\nExhibit R-53, Transcript of the Hearing on Jurisdiction in *Conoco Philips Company and Others v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela* (ICSID Case No. ARB/07/30) (Case Pending) (*\"Conoco*\") and Exhibit R-54, Transcript of the Hearing on Jurisdiction in *Mobil.*\n\n8.\n\nFurther, the Claimant filed documentary evidence with regards to the context surrounding the Investment Law (Exhibits WCL-2, WCL-3 and AB-64), which is consistent with the testimony provided by Mr. Corrales regarding the intention to provide consent to arbitration through Article 22 of the Investment Law. Exhibits WCL-212 and WCL-313 appeared months before the enactment of the Investment Law and Exhibit AB-6414 was published immediately after such enactment took place and many years before any dispute on the matter arose, which evidences \"the context and purpose\" of Article 22. On the contrary, Venezuela failed to submit any contemporary documentary or witness evidence to the contrary, even when requested to do so.\n\nExhibit WCL-2, *Algunas ideas relativas a un nuevo r\u00e9gimen legal de promoci\u00f3n y protecci\u00f3n de Inversiones en Venezuela,* Geneva, 8 May 1999, section 4.6. at page 11.\n\nExhibit WCL-3 *Comments on the Draft of a Decree-Law on the Promotion and Protection of Investments (Comentarios a un proyecto de Decreto-Ley sobre promoci\u00f3n y protecci\u00f3n de inversiones),* Caracas, 30 June 1999, section 2.4. at page 10.\n\nExhibit AB-64, *Algunas ideas sobre el nuevo r\u00e9gimen de promoci\u00f3n y protecci\u00f3n de inversiones en Venezuela,* in \"La OMC como espacio normativo. Un reto para Venezuela\", Asociaci\u00f3n Venezolana de Derecho y Econom\u00eda, Caracas, 2000, pages 185-186.\n\n9.\n\nThe Tribunal has explained in paragraphs 109-124 of the Award the relevance of Mr. Corrales testimony and how the Respondent decided not to present evidence contradicting such testimony regarding its intention with respect to Article 22. It has also explained in paragraphs 134-145 of the Award how, differing from *Conoco* or *Mobil,* specific document requests were made by Claimant in this case15, how the Tribunal directed Respondent to produce those documents in its possession, custody or control,16 that although such documents must have existed they were not produced and how the Tribunal considered itself entitled to infer that contemporaneous documents of the Respondents relating to the preparation of the Investment Law would not assist the Respondent to support its contention in this matter.\n\n*See* Claimant\u2019s First Request for the Respondent to Produce Documents dated 22 August 2011 (in particular, Requests No. 7, 8, 9 and 10) and Claimant\u2019s Response to Respondent\u2019s Reply to Claimant Request for Document Production dated 5 September 2011.\n\nProcedural Order No. 1 - Decision on Claimant\u2019s Request for Document Production dated 19 September 2011.\n\n10.\n\nNotwithstanding so, my fellow arbitrators have concluded that, absent direct evidence of Respondent\u2019s intention to consent to ICSID jurisdiction, such negative inference is not enough to determine on its own that Article 22 was intended by Venezuela to be the consent to jurisdiction required by Article 25 of the ICSID Convention.17\n\nAward, paras. 125 and 146.\n\n11.\n\nI am unable to agree with such conclusion. The record evidences that while the Claimant has made substantial efforts to prove that Article 22 of the Investment Law provides consent to arbitrate, the Respondent provided no assistance in determining the purpose and intention of such provision, notwithstanding its duty to \"cooperate with the Tribunal in the production of the evidence\" under Rule 34(3) of the Arbitration Rules.\n\n12.\n\nAbsent in the case of the Investment Law (enacted by Presidential decree)18 a formal Congressional debate19, \"direct evidence\" of the intention of the legislator would have normally appeared in the form of documents existing in the official administrative files, the minutes of the Economic Cabinet or the minutes of the Council of Ministers. Such evidence could have only been produced by Respondent, who did not disclose them, notwithstanding the multiple requests made to this respect.20\n\nExhibit LA C-21, Publication of Decree-Law No. 356 of 3 October 1999 on Protection and Promotion of Investments in ICSID\u2019s Investment Laws of the World (March 2000) ICSID\u2019s Investment Laws of the World (March 2000).; Exhibit EU-1, Decree with Rank and Force of Law on the Promotion and Protection of Investments, Decree No. 356, published in the Official Gazette No. 5,390 (Extraordinary), on October 22,1999.\n\n*See,* Legal Expert Opinion of Professor Enrique Urdaneta Fontiveros dated 29 July 2011, para. 3. *See,* also, Respondent\u2019s letter dated 14 October 2011.\n\n*See,* Claimant\u2019s First Request, *supra note* 15.\n\n13.\n\nHaving the Tribunal come to the conclusion that Messrs. Corrales and Capriles contributed to the drafting of the Investment Law, and that their intention was that Article 22 of the Investment Law would constitute consent of Venezuela to ICSID jurisdiction in respect of disputes brought by investors against the Respondent under the Investment Law -which is consistent with the documentary evidence available in the record-, denial of jurisdiction for lack of consent based in the absence of \"direct evidence\" that could only take the form of documents in possession, custody or control of the Respondent, duly requested and not produced, appears in my view as a threshold too high for the Claimant to comply with and with which I am, respectfully, unable to agree."}], "Content": "Award\n-----\n\n**I.

Following the Hearing, but prior to Tribunal closing the proceedings, the Respondent requested permission, by letter dated 8 February 2013, to include the decision of *Tidewater Inc. et al.* v. *The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela* (ICSID Case No. ARB/10/5), Decision on Jurisdiction (8 February 2013) (\"*Tidewater\"),* in the record of this case. The tribunal in *Tidewater* found that Article 22 does not operate so as to give the consent in writing of Venezuela to submit all investment disputes with nationals of other ICSID contracting states to the jurisdiction of the Centre. The Claimant (by letter dated 14 February 2013) and the Respondent (by letter dated 15 February 2013) each made brief written submissions in respect of *Tidewater.* The Tribunal has taken these submissions into consideration.\n\n16.\n\nThe Tribunal deliberated in London on 18 September, 2012, and again on 19 December, 2012.\n\n17.\n\nThe Tribunal has taken into account all of the pleadings, documents and testimony submitted in this case.\n\n18.\n\nThe issuance of this Award constitutes the closure of this proceeding pursuant to Rule 38(a) of the Arbitration Rules.\n\n**II. PARTIES\u2019 SUBMISSIONS**\n----------------------------\n\n**A. THE RESPONDENT\u2019S MEMORIAL ON OBJECTIONS TO JURISDICTION**\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**1. Background**\n-----------------\n\n19.\n\nOn 1 August, 2011, the Respondent submitted a Memorial containing its objections to jurisdiction.\n\n20.\n\nThe Respondent first outlines the background to the dispute. It explains that the dispute relates to two petroleum projects in Venezuela, commenced in 1996 and structured as \"associations\" between a subsidiary of Petr\u00f3leos de Venezuela S.A. (the Venezuelan State-owned oil company) and certain foreign oil companies with which the Claimant subsequently partnered. The projects were amongst several affected by the nationalisation of the Venezuelan oil industry in 2007, following which the State took control of the projects. The Parties were unable to reach agreement as to the amount of any compensation payable by Venezuela for the loss of the Claimant\u2019s interest in the Projects and this issue forms the basis of the dispute in this proceeding.2\n\nMemorial of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela on Objections to Jurisdiction (\"Respondent\u2019s Memorial\")[2]-[5].\n\n21.\n\nThe Respondent then notes that the only alleged basis of jurisdiction of ICSID advanced by the Claimant is Article 22 of the Venezuelan Law on the Promotion and Protection of Investments (the \"Investment Law\").3\n\nRespondent\u2019s Memorial [6].\n\n**2. Objections to Jurisdiction**\n---------------------------------\n\n22.\n\nThe Respondent contends that Article 22 of the Investment Law does not provide consent to arbitration of this dispute as required by Article 25 of the ICSID Convention. The Respondent bases this contention on: (a) the text of Article 22 of the Investment Law; (b) Venezuelan legal principles; (c) the historical background of the Investment Law; (d) a comparison of the language of Article 22 of the Investment Law with ICSID model clauses; (e) a comparison of Article 22 of the Investment Law with other national investment laws; (f) a comparison of Article 22 of the Investment Law with the language of consent in Venezuelan bilateral investment treaties; and (g) decisions by other ICSID tribunals on Article 22 of the Investment Law.\n\n**(a) Text of Article 22 of the Investment Law**\n------------------------------------------------\n\n23.\n\nThe Respondent places an emphasis on the words *\"if it so provides\"* in the text of Article 22 and states that this is an express condition on any reference to arbitration by the means set out in Article 22.4\n\nRespondent\u2019s Memorial [17].\n\n24.\n\nThe Respondent submits:\n\n\"[16] According to Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention, for a dispute to be submitted to ICSID arbitration... the Parties to the dispute must have committed in writing to resolve the dispute in accordance with the mechanism set forth in the ICSID Convention. This... requirement may be met through a separate instrument containing a consent to ICSID jurisdiction, but it is not satisfied by a statute that only recognizes international arbitration where the treaty or agreement itself contains an obligatory submission to arbitration. While the ICSID Convention provides a mechanism for international arbitration, it does not itself provide for the arbitration of any dispute without the separate instrument of consent, even in investment disputes where the nationality test is met.\n\n[17] In other words, the plain language of Article 22 of the Investment Law negates any notion of consent in this case. The reference to international arbitration is subject to an express condition - \"if it so provides\" - and it is indisputable that such condition is not met in this case. [...]\".5 (footnotes omitted)\n\nRespondent\u2019s Memorial [16]-[17],\n\n**(b) Venezuelan legal principles**\n-----------------------------------\n\n25.\n\nThe Respondent submits that it is well settled under Venezuelan law, being consistent with principles of international law, that consent to arbitration must be clear and unequivocal.6 In support of its submission, the Respondent cites several judgements of the Supreme Tribunal of Venezuela7 and the writings of a legal commentator.8\n\nRespondent\u2019s Memorial [18]-[19].\n\nExhibit EU-8,\"[I]t is required that there be \u2018manifest, express and indisputable\u2019 consent to arbitration\": Tribunal Supremo de Justicia, *Hoteles Doral C.A. v.

In this case the Supreme Tribunal said:\n\n\"[T]he law on the Promotion and Protection of Investments does not contain in itself a general unilateral manifestation of submission to international arbitration governed by the Convention Establishing the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (OMGI-MIGA) or the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States (ICSID), but refers instead to their content to determine whether arbitration may be resorted to... a situation that does not exist in the case of Article 25 of the ICSID Convention..,\"10\n\nExhibit EU-29, Tribunal Supremo de Justicia, *Decision on interpretation request filed by Hildegard Rond\u00f3n de Sans\u00f3, Alvaro Silva Calder\u00f3n, Beatrice Sans\u00f3 de Ramirez and Others, acting in representation of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, in relation to the last part of Article 258 of the Constitution of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela,* Case No. 2008-0763 (October 17, 2008) at 47.\n\n**(c) Historical background of Investment Law**\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n28.\n\nThe Respondent refers to a series of decrees and statements made by various political figures, both before and after the enactment of the Investment Law indicating what the Respondent refers to as a \"cautious and restrictive attitude\" towards international arbitration, particularly with respect to State contracts.11 The Respondent submits that it is impossible to reconcile such attitudes with the notion that Article 22 of the Investment Law was intended to constitute a standing and general consent on the part of Venezuela to arbitrate all investment disputes before ICSID.12\n\nRespondent\u2019s Memorial [25]-[32].\n\nRespondent\u2019s Memorial [32].\n\n**(d) Comparison of the language of Article 22 of the Investment Law with ICSID model clauses**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n29.\n\nThe Respondent contrasts the wording of the 1968 and 1993 ICSID Model Clauses with that of Article 22 of the Investment Law. It submits that, unlike Article 22, the model clauses are straightforward, do not contain the expression \"if it so provides\", and leave no room for debate as to whether consent to ICSID arbitration has been granted.13\n\nRespondent\u2019s Memorial [33]-[37].\n\n**(e) Comparison of Article 22 of the Investment Law with other national investment laws**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n30.\n\nThe Respondent contrasts Article 22 of the Investment Law with the investment laws of other states including Albania, the Central African Republic and C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, which it submits contain clear and unequivocal consent to ICSID arbitration, unlike Article 22.14\n\nRespondent\u2019s Memorial [38]-[42].\n\n**(f) Comparison of Article 22 of the Investment Law with the language of consent in Venezuelan bilateral investment treaties**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n31.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the text of Venezuela\u2019s bilateral investment treaties in effect at the time of the Investment Law, which differ from that of Article 22 of the Investment Law, show that in 1999 the Respondent knew how to draft an obligatory consent to international arbitration when it was its intention to do so.15\n\nRespondent\u2019s Memorial [43].\n\n**(g) Decisions by ICSID tribunals on Article 22 of the Investment Law**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n32.\n\nThe Respondent relies on two recent decisions of ICSID tribunals,16 both relating to the nationalization of the Claimant\u2019s interests in oil ventures in Venezuela, which have found that Article 22 does not provide a basis for ICSID jurisdiction.\n\nA third ICSID award, *Brandes,* was rendered following the Respondent\u2019s filing of its Memorial and is referred to below at [51].\n\n33.\n\nThe first is *Mobil.* In its Decision on jurisdiction, the tribunal interpreted Article 22 of the Investment Law in accordance with rules of international law. In considering the text of Article 22 and the intention of Venezuela in enacting Article 22, it arrived at the conclusion that Venezuela did not, by Article 22, consent in advance to ICSID arbitration for all disputes covered by the ICSID Convention and that jurisdiction was not established on that basis in the circumstances of the case.17\n\n*Mobil Corporation, Venezuela Holdings, B.V., Mobil Cerro Negro Holding, Ltd., Mobil Venezolana de Petr\u00f3leos, Inc.* v. *Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela* (ICSID Case No. ARB/07/27) Decision on Jurisdiction (10 June 2010) (\"*Mobil*\") [139]-[140].\n\n34.\n\nThe second is *Cemex.* In its Decision on jurisdiction, the tribunal similarly found that \"it cannot conclude from the obscure and ambiguous text of Article 22 that Venezuela, in adopting the 1999 Investment Law, consented unilaterally to ICSID arbitration for all disputes covered by the ICSID Convention in a general manner\".18\n\n*Cemex Caracas Investments B.V. and Cemex Caracas II Investments B.V.* v. *Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela (ICSID Case No. ARB/08/15)* Decision on Jurisdiction (30 December 2010) (\"Cemex\") [138].\n\n**B. Claimant\u2019s Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction**\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n35.\n\nOn 1 November, 2011, the Claimant submitted a Counter-Memorial in response to Venezuela\u2019s objections to jurisdiction.\n\n**1. Background**\n-----------------\n\n36.\n\nThe Claimant first states that its claims relate to \"Venezuela\u2019s unilateral decision to expropriate OPIC\u2019s [Gulf of Paria West] and [Gulf of Paria East] investments without compensation in 2007\", as a result of the enactment of a \"Migration Law\" that is itself \"in violation of the Venezuelan Constitution, Venezuela\u2019s Investment Law... and other Venezuelan Laws\".19\n\nCounter-Memorial in response to the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela\u2019s Objections to Jurisdiction **(\"Claimant\u2019s Counter-Memorial\")** [4]-[5].\n\n**2. Basis for Jurisdiction of the Tribunal**\n---------------------------------------------\n\n37.\n\nThe Claimant then submits that Article 22 of the Investment Law contains in and of itself the written expression of consent by Venezuela to submit any dispute with an international investor to the jurisdiction of ICSID. The Claimant bases its submission on: (a) the requirements of Article 25 of the ICSID Convention; (b) the purpose of the Investment Law; (c) the language of the Investment Law; (d) an objective and good faith interpretation of Article 22; and (e) the absence of any binding authority.\n\n**(a) Requirements of Article 25 of the ICSID Convention**\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n38.\n\nThe Claimant submits that Article 25 of the ICSID Convention merely requires that consent to arbitration be in writing. It does not require that such consent be \"clear\", \"express\" or \"unequivocal\". The Claimant submits that Article 22 of the Investment Law provides that requisite written consent.20\n\nClaimant\u2019s Counter-Memorial [36]-[38].\n\n**(b) Purpose of the Investment Law**\n-------------------------------------\n\n39.\n\nThe Claimant notes that the purpose of the Investment Law is to promote and protect foreign investments and argues that this purpose must inform the interpretation of Article 22. It submits that the Investment Law sought to broaden the scope of protection for foreign investors21. In particular it was aimed at attracting and retaining investments from United States companies following the breakdown of bilateral investment treaty negotiations with the United States.22 The Claimant states that \"[t]he ambiguous way the law is crafted gives an appearance of unilateral consent on which foreign investors relied... Good faith therefore should prevent Venezuela from using any ambiguity - which resulted from its own confusing drafting of the Law - against foreign investors\".23\n\nClaimant\u2019s Counter-Memorial [40].\n\nClaimant\u2019s Counter-Memorial [44].\n\nClaimant\u2019s Counter-Memorial [27].\n\n40.\n\nIn support of its contention, the Claimant refers to the decision of the tribunal in *SPP,* in which it held that ambiguous offers in a State\u2019s investment law must be interpreted neither restrictively nor expansively, but rather objectively and in good faith.24 The Claimant argues that this case is of particular relevance given the similarity in wording and structure between the Egyptian law and the Venezuelan law at issue.25\n\n*Southern Pacific Properties Ltd.* v. *Arab Republic of Egypt* (ICSID Case No. ARB/84/3) Decision on Jurisdiction (14 April 1988) (\"SPP\").\n\nClaimant\u2019s Counter-Memorial [76].\n\n41.\n\nThe Claimant also refers the Tribunal to the court file of the Supreme Tribunal of Venezuela in the case of *Ferm\u00edn Toro Jim\u00e9nez,* Expediente 00-1438 *(\"Ferm\u00edn Toro\"),* which it says was not considered in full by previous ICSID tribunals and reveals that the Attorney General\u2019s Office argued that the Investment Law provides consent to arbitration.26\n\nClaimant\u2019s Counter-Memorial [70] and [71.2].\n\n**(c) Language of the Investment Law**\n--------------------------------------\n\n42.\n\nThe Claimant refers to the mandatory language used in the Investment Law: \"disputes... *shall* be submitted to international arbitration\" (emphasis added). It submits that such language constitutes consent to arbitration.27 The Claimant relies on *SPP,* in which it says the Tribunal, \"in the face of strikingly similar language to that at issue here,\" found that there was consent to ICSID arbitration and that provisions such as the Egyptian investment law must be interpreted in good faith.28\n\nClaimant\u2019s Counter-Memorial [102]-[l05].\n\nClaimant\u2019s Counter-Memorial [88].\n\n43.\n\nThe Claimant further submits that a comparison of the Investment Law against model clauses and other investment laws is irrelevant to the question in issue because there is no specific formula that must be used to provide for a standing consent to arbitration. It notes that the lack of uniformity among national legislations concerning the acceptance of ICSID jurisdiction is well documented.29\n\nClaimant\u2019s Counter-Memorial [111]-[113].\n\n**(d) Objective and good faith interpretation of Article 22**\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n44.\n\nThe Claimant submits that, while the Tribunal ought to consider Venezuelan legal principles, it must ultimately apply an \"objective and good faith interpretation\" to Article 22 of the Investment Law. The Claimant relies on the Opinion of Judge Stephen M. Schwebel, dated 24 October, 2011 (\"Opinion of Judge Schwebel\"), and submits that a good faith interpretation requires the Tribunal to interpret Article 22 in such a way as to not render it \"meaningless\".30\n\nClaimant\u2019s Counter-Memorial [124]-[128].\n\n45.\n\nThe Claimant submits that to allow the Venezuelan judiciary\u2019s interpretation of Article 22 to inform the Tribunal\u2019s interpretation would be to give the Respondent power to unilaterally decide whether or not it has given its consent to arbitration, which cannot be correct.31\n\nClaimant\u2019s Counter-Memorial [29].\n\n**(e) Absence of any binding authority**\n----------------------------------------\n\n46.\n\nThe Claimant notes that the Tribunal is not bound by the decisions of other ICSID tribunals, nor the Venezuelan Supreme Tribunal, with respect to its interpretation of Article 22 of the Investment Law.32 It submits that the present case can be distinguished from prior ICSID decisions that considered the meaning of Article 22 on several bases, including the introduction of new evidence by the Claimant that was not before the other tribunals.33\n\nClaimant\u2019s Counter-Memorial [30].\n\nClaimant\u2019s Counter-Memorial [167].\n\n47.\n\nThe Claimant relies, particularly, on the evidence of Mr. Corrales, one of two drafters of the Investment Law who has not testified in previous ICSID proceedings with respect to the meaning of Article 22. It submits that the Witness Statement of Mr. Werner Corrales, dated 1 November, 2011 (\"First Witness Statement of Mr. Corrales\"), \"demonstrates conclusively that the government intended to provide consent to ICSID arbitration in Article 22\".34 The Claimant also relies on the court file of the Supreme Tribunal of Venezuela in the case of *Ferm\u00edn Toro* (referred to above at paragraph 41).35\n\nClaimant\u2019s Counter-Memorial [169]-[170].\n\nClaimant\u2019s Counter-Memorial [171].\n\n48.\n\nThe Claimant submits that the tribunals in prior ICSID decisions on the meaning of Article 22 allowed for the possibility that additional evidence might contradict their conclusions and that the evidence of Mr. Corrales and the Supreme Tribunal court file must be afforded considerable weight and deference. It submits that this is particularly so in the absence of any evidence to the contrary put forward by the Respondent.36\n\nClaimant\u2019s Counter-Memorial [174]-[176].\n\n**C. Respondent\u2019s Reply Memorial on Jurisdiction**\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n49.\n\nOn 31 January, 2012, the Respondent submitted a Reply Memorial on objections to jurisdiction.\n\n50.\n\nThe Respondent submits that this case is essentially no different to the three previous ICSID cases in which tribunals have, when considering whether Article 22 of the Investment Law constitutes a standing general consent to ICSID arbitration, unanimously ruled that it does not. It states that virtually every argument made by the Claimant has been made at length before previous tribunals and has been unsuccessful.37\n\nReply Memorial of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela on Objections to Jurisdiction **(\"Respondent\u2019s Reply Memorial\")** [2]-[3],\n\n51.\n\nThe Respondent refers the Tribunal, in addition to *Mobil* and *Cemex,* to *Brandes.* In its Award (rendered following the Respondent\u2019s submission of its Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction), the tribunal reached a similar conclusion to that of the *Mobil* and *Cemex* tribunals in finding that \"it is obvious that Article 22 of the Law on Promotion and Protection of investments does not contain the consent of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela to ICSID jurisdiction\".38\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply Memorial [17], *Brandes Investment Partners LP* v. *Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela* (ICSID Case No. ARB/08/3) Award (2 August 2011) *((\"Brandes\")* [118].\n\n52.\n\nThe Respondent further submits that the comparisons drawn by the Claimant between the present case and the tribunal\u2019s decision in *SPP* are inapposite. It states: \"[i]t makes no sense to argue that the decision of a divided tribunal involving the interpretation of an Egyptian law, written in Arabic and with a completely different formulation, is more relevant to this case than the three unanimous decisions relating to Article 22 of the Investment Law\".39\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply Memorial [216].\n\n53.\n\nThe Respondent addresses the First Witness Statement of Mr. Corrales and submits that it provides no additional information to the paper co-authored by Mr. Corrales in 1999.40 The Respondent further submits that, in any event, as a matter of Venezuelan law, the intention of the legislature must be derived from the text of the law itself and not from an individual\u2019s opinion.41\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply Memorial [43]-[45].\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply Memorial [57].\n\n54.\n\nThe Respondent goes on to reaffirm the arguments put forward in its Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction.\n\n**D. Claimant\u2019s Rejoinder on Respondent\u2019s Objections to Jurisdiction**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n55.\n\nOn 30 April, 2012, the Claimant submitted a Rejoinder on the Respondent\u2019s objections to jurisdiction.\n\n56.\n\nThe Claimant maintains that the present case differs from previous decisions of ICSID tribunals on the meaning of Article 22 of the Investment Law. It states that the principle difference is that \"the tribunals in those cases found significant that Mr. Corrales was not offered to testify, despite the fact that his role in drafting the Investment Law and his knowledge concerning the intent and purpose of the government were subjects of great debate in those proceedings\".42\n\nClaimant\u2019s Rejoinder on Respondent\u2019s Objections to Jurisdiction **(\"Claimant\u2019s Rejoinder\")** [6].\n\n57.\n\nThe Claimant reiterates its submission that the Respondent has, by Article 22 of the Investment Law, consented to international arbitration and that this is demonstrated by the purpose of the Investment Law, the plain language of Article 22, interpretation of Article 22 in accordance with principles of international law and Venezuelan law, the absence of any requirement for \"clear and unequivocal\" consent, the historical background of the Investment Law and the opinions of commentators on the Investment Law.\n\n58.\n\nThe Claimant further submits that the Respondent\u2019s interpretation of Article 22 is inconsistent with the principle of *effet utile.* The Claimant says that:\n\n\"\"if it so provides\" would amount to an impossible condition if it was construed to mean \"if it [the ICSID Convention] provides consent\", because the ICSID Convention itself provides that consent must be set forth in a separate document. Thus the condition that the ICSID Convention provides consent could never be met.\"43\n\nClaimant\u2019s Rejoinder [212].\n\n59.\n\nThe Claimant submits that, similarly, the phrase \"without prejudice\" is ineffective in Article 22 if consent needs to be given separately in the case of the ICSID Convention because, if there were no possibility for an investor to resort to international arbitration, there would be no need for the disclaimer.44\n\nClaimant\u2019s Rejoinder [227]-[230].\n\n60.\n\nThe Claimant also emphasises the importance of Mr. Corrales\u2019 evidence, being a primary source of testimony on the legislative background to the Investment Law, and draws the Tribunal\u2019s attention to the absence of witness testimony of a similar nature put forward by the Respondent.45 It submits that the only relevant evidence of the legislative history of the Investment Law is that which has been produced by the Claimant.46\n\nClaimant\u2019s Rejoinder [242]-[247].\n\nClaimant\u2019s Rejoinder [252]-[262].\n\n**E. Hearing on Jurisdiction**\n------------------------------\n\n61.\n\nDuring the hearing held on 18, 19 and 20 June, 2012, the Parties developed their respective arguments as set out in their written submissions. The Respondent maintained that this case was no different to the three previous ICSID decisions that considered Article 22 - *Mobil, Cemex* and *Brandes -* and each found it incapable of establishing the consent of the Venezuela to ICSID arbitration. The Claimant placed significant emphasis on what it claimed was \"new\" evidence before this Tribunal. In particular, considerable emphasis was placed on the testimony of Mr. Corrales, who had not appeared in any previous ICSID hearing concerning Article 22 of the Investment Law.\n\n**III. ANALYSIS OF THE TRIBUNAL**\n---------------------------------\n\n62.\n\nPursuant to Article 25 of the ICSID Convention, the Centre\u2019s jurisdiction extends to \"any legal dispute arising out of an investment between a Contracting State... and a national of another Contracting State which the parties to the dispute consent in writing to submit to the Centre\" (emphasis supplied).\n\n63.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that under Article 41(1) of the ICSID Convention, it is for the Tribunal, as the judge of its own competence, and not for State authorities or national courts to determine the basis of that competence,47 whether it be derived from a treaty or a unilateral offer made in legislation and subsequently accepted in writing by the investor.48\n\n*Mobil* [75]; *Cemex* [70]; *Pac Rim Cayman LCC* v *The Republic of El Salvador* (ICSID Case No. ARB/09/12) Decision on the Respondent\u2019s Jurisdictional Objections (1 June 2012) *(\"Pac Rim\")* [5.30].\n\nSee the Report of the Executive Directors on the Convention at [24]: \"Thus, a host State might in its investment promotion legislation offer to submit disputes...to the jurisdiction of the Centre, and the investor might give his consent by accepting the offer in writing\"; *Mobil* [74]; *Cemex* [69]; *SPP* [60]; *Inceysa Vallisoletana S.L.* v. *Republic of El Salvador,* ICSID Case No. ARB/03/26, Award, 2 August 2006, [212]-[213]; *Zhinvali Development Ltd.* v. *Republic of Georgia,* ICSID Case No. ARB/00/1, Award (24 January 2003) [339]; *Pac Rim* [5.30]; amongst many others.\n\n64.\n\nThe sole basis upon which the Claimant asserts that this Tribunal has jurisdiction over the dispute between the Parties is Article 22 of the Investment Law, which reads:\n\n\"Las controversias que surjan entre un inversionista internacional, cuyo pa\u00eds de origen tenga vigente con Venezuela un tratado o acuerdo sobre promoci\u00f3n y protecci\u00f3n de inversiones, o las controversias respecto de las cuales sean aplicables las disposiciones del Convenio Constitutivo del Organismo Multilateral de Garant\u00eda de Inversiones (OMGI-MIGA) o del Convenio sobre Arreglo de Diferencias Relativas a Inversiones entre Estados y Nacionales de Otros Estados (CIADI), ser\u00e1n sometidas al arbitraje internacional en los t\u00e9rminos del respectivo tratado o acuerdo, si as\u00ed \u00e9ste lo establece, sin perjuicio de la posibilidad de hacer uso, cuando proceda, de las v\u00edas contenciosas contempladas en la legislaci\u00f3n venezolana vigente\".\n\n65.\n\nThe Article is translated by the Claimant as follows:\n\n\"Any disputes arising between an international investor whose country of origin has a treaty or agreement for promotion and protection of investments in force with Venezuela, or any disputes to which the provisions of the Articles of Association of the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) or the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States (ICSID) are applicable, shall be submitted to international arbitration under the terms provided for in the respective treaty or agreement, should it so provide, without prejudice to the possibility using the systems of litigation provided for in the Venezuelan laws in force, when applicable.\"49\n\nRequest for Arbitration [28].\n\n66.\n\nThe Article is translated by the Respondent as follows:\n\n\"Disputes arising between an international investor whose country of origin has in effect with Venezuela a treaty or agreement on the promotion and protection of investments, or disputes to which are applicable the provisions of the Convention Establishing the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (OMIGI-MIGA) or the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States (ICSID), shall be submitted to international arbitration according to the terms of the respective treaty or agreement, if it so provides, without prejudice to the possibility of making use, when appropriate, of the dispute resolution means provided for under the Venezuelan legislation in effect.\"50\n\nRespondent\u2019s Memorial [14].\n\n67.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that there is no material difference between the two texts. For the purposes of this Award the Tribunal adopts the translation provided by the Respondent.\n\n68.\n\nAs summarized above, the Parties disagree on the interpretation of Article 22 of the Investment Law. The Respondent argues that Article 22 does not provide consent under Article 25 of the ICSID Convention, whereas the Claimant submits that it does.\n\n69.\n\nIn order to determine whether Article 22 constitutes the Respondent\u2019s consent to ICSID jurisdiction, the Tribunal will first identify the standard of interpretation that it considers to be applicable, and will then apply that standard to the terms of Article 22.\n\n**A. Approach to Interpretation**\n---------------------------------\n\n**1. Determination of the Standard of Interpretation**\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n70.\n\nThe first issue that arises is whether Article 22 is to be interpreted according to international law or by reference to Venezuelan principles of interpretation.\n\n71.\n\nIn its Memorial, the Respondent proceeds to interpret Article 22 by reference to Venezuelan legal principles, which it says requires \u2018\"clear, express and unequivocal consent to arbitrate\".51 The Respondent submits that this approach to interpretation is consistent with principles of international law,52 and relies on the Legal Expert Opinion of Professor Enrique Urdaneta Fontiveros, dated 29 July, 2011, in this respect.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Memorial [20].\n\nRespondent\u2019s Memorial [19].\n\n72.\n\nThe Claimant, in its Counter-Memorial, agrees that the Investment Law should be interpreted under both principles of interpretation of international law as well as those of domestic law, and that those principles are consistent with one another.53 However, the Claimant disputes the Respondent\u2019s interpretation of the relevant principles. The Claimant submits that neither Venezuelan law, nor international principles, require that consent to arbitrate be \"clear and unequivocal\".54\n\nClaimant\u2019s Counter-Memorial [129]-[130].\n\nClaimant\u2019s Counter-Memorial [134]-[ 140].\n\n73.\n\nICSID case law on this point is limited. In some ICSID cases, the terms of the national investment legislation has been so clear and unambiguous that the tribunal has found it unnecessary to determine the approach to interpretation to be applied. This was the case, for example, in *Tradex,55* where Article 8(2) of the relevant investment law stated that \"[t]he Republic of Albania hereby consents to the submission thereof to the ICSID\" and the tribunal found this to be an unambiguous consent to ICSID jurisdiction, thereby making further inquiry unwarranted.56 A similar approach was taken in *Inceysa* v. *El Salvador,57 Rumeli Telekom* v. *Kazakhstan58* and *Biwater Gauff* v. *Tanzania.59*\n\n*Tradex Hellas S.A. (Greece) v Republic of Albania* (ICSID Case No. ARB/94/2) Decision on Jurisdiction (24 December, 1996) *('Tradex\u2019).*\n\n*Tradex* p. 187.\n\n*Inceysa Vallisoletana S.L.* v. *Republic of El Salvador* (ICSID Case No. ARB/03/26 Award (2 August 2006).\n\n*Rumeli Telekom AS and Telsim Mobil Telekomunikasyon Hizmetleri AS* v *Republic of Kazakhstan* (ICSID Case No. ARB/05/16) Award (29 July 2008).\n\n*Biwater Gauff (Tanzania) Ltd* v. *United Republic of Tanzania* (ICSID Case No. ARB/05/22) Award (24 July 2008).\n\n74.\n\nIn three other ICSID cases, tribunals dealt explicitly with the question of the standard of interpretation to be applied to unilateral offers made by States. In *SPP* the tribunal applied \"general principles of statutory interpretation\" and considered \"relevant rules of treaty interpretation and principles of international law applicable to unilateral declarations\".60 In *CSOB* the tribunal found that a question of consent to ICSID jurisdiction \"is not to be answered by reference to national law\" but \"is governed by international law as set out by Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention\".61 In *Zhinvali* v. *Georgia*\u00a0the tribunal considered that, if the national law of the State addresses the question of consent, then \"the Tribunal must follow that national law guidance, but always subject to ultimate governance by international law\".62\n\n*SPP* [61].\n\n*Ceskoslovensk\u00e1 Obchodni Banka, A.S.* v. *The Slovak Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/97/4) Decision on Objections to Jurisdiction (24 May 1999) *(\"CSOB\")* [35].\n\n*Zhinvali Development Ltd.* v. *Republic of Georgia* (ICSID Case No. ARB/00/1) Award (24 January 2003).\n\n75.\n\nThree other ICSID cases *- Mobil, Cemex* and *Brandes \u2014* have dealt specifically with the interpretation of Article 22 of the Investment Law, in circumstances that are strikingly similar to the present case. Each of these tribunals found that, while regard may be had State laws when considering the State\u2019s intention in enacting a legislation that contains a unilateral declaration, a unilateral act must be interpreted according to the ICSID Convention itself and to the rules of international law governing unilateral declarations of States.63\n\n*Mobil* [84]-[85] and [96]; *Cemex* [78]-[79] and [89]; *Brandes* [81]-[82].\n\n76.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees with that approach. It concludes that the correct approach to interpretation of Article 22 of the Investment Law is to apply the rules of international law governing the interpretation of treaties and of unilateral acts formulated within the framework and on the basis of a treaty, namely the ICSID Convention, having regard to the ICSID jurisprudence where relevant.64\n\n*Mobil* [86]-[96]; *Cemex* [80]-[89]; *Pac Rim* [5.34]-[5.35], *Brandes* [81]-[82].\n\n**2. Content of the Standard of Interpretation**\n------------------------------------------------\n\n77.\n\nArticle 25 of the ICSID Convention requires that consent to arbitration be in writing, but gives no further indication as to the form or timing of that written consent, nor any guidance on interpretation.\n\n78.\n\nThe principles of international law governing the interpretation of unilateral declarations formulated on the basis of a treaty have been articulated by the International Court of Justice. The content of the relevant rules is usefully set out in the *Fisheries Jurisdiction Case,65* where the Court found that since statutes are unilaterally drafted instruments, a certain emphasis is properly to be placed on the intention of the depositing state.66 Thus, the relevant words of a declaration including a reservation contained therein are to be interpreted:\n\n\"[I]n a natural and reasonable way, having due regard to the intention of the State concerned... [which] may be deduced not only from the text of the relevant clause, but also from the context in which the clause is to be read, and an examination of evidence regarding the circumstances of its preparation and the purposes intended to be served.\"67\n\n*Fisheries Jurisdiction Case (Spain* v *Canada),* Jurisdiction of the Court, Judgment, ICJ Reports 1998 *(\"Fisheries Jurisdiction Case\")* p 454.\n\n*Fisheries Jurisdiction Case* p 454 at [48].\n\n*Fisheries Jurisdiction Case* p 454 [49].\n\n79.\n\nThis approach to interpretation is consistent with that taken by the tribunals in *Mobil68* and *Cemex.69* It was also adopted by the tribunals in *SPP70* and *Pac Rim.71*\n\n*Mobil* [86]-[95].\n\n*Cemex* [80]-[88].\n\n*SPP* [61],\n\n*Pac Rim* [5.34]-[5.35].\n\n80.\n\nThe Tribunal will adopt this approach and commence with a consideration of the plain meaning of Article 22.\n\n**B. INTERPRETATION OF ARTICLE 22**\n-----------------------------------\n\n**1. Plain Meaning of Article 22**\n----------------------------------\n\n**(a) The Text of Article 22 of the Investment Law**\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n81.\n\nAccording to Article 22, disputes arising between a foreign investor and Venezuela under a relevant bilateral investment treaty, or to which the MIGA or ICSID Convention are applicable, \"shall be submitted to international arbitration, according to the terms of the respective treaty or agreement, if it so provides\". The Parties agree that this provision creates an obligation to refer certain disputes to international arbitration subject to conditions contained within the relevant treaty or agreement; they disagree, however, on the conditions that come into play.\n\n82.\n\nThe Respondent claims that, while the ICSID Convention provides a mechanism for international arbitration, it does not itself provide for consent to arbitration by reference to those mechanisms, and that the necessary expression of consent must be found in a separate instrument of consent. In the absence of any such separate instrument providing for consent - which is the situation in the present case, since Article 22 does not as such provide for such consent - the express condition that is set out in Article 22 - \"if it so provides\" - is not satisfied.72\n\nRespondent\u2019s Memorial [ 16]-[ 17].\n\n83.\n\nThe Claimant, on the other hand, interprets the words \"if it so provides\" in Article 22 to mean \"if the \u2018applicable\u2019 treaty or agreement \u2018provides\u2019 for international arbitration for the settlement of potential disputes\".73 The Claimant notes that the ICSID Convention \"undoubtedly \u2018provides\u2019 for arbitration before ICSID\" and submits that \"an objective assessment based on the \u2018natural and reasonable\u2019 meaning of the terms used by Venezuela in Article 22 of the Investment Law leads to the conclusion that Venezuela has in this Article \u2018consent[ed] in writing to submit to the Centre\u2019\".74\n\nClaimant\u2019s Counter-Memorial [103],\n\nClaimant\u2019s Counter-Memorial [104].\n\n84.\n\nIn support of this argument the Claimant relies on the Opinion of Judge Schwebel. In that opinion Judge Schwebel expresses the view that, while the terms of Article 22 are ambiguous, an ordinary and reasonable construction of the terms leads to the conclusion that Article 22 constitutes Venezuela\u2019s consent to ICSID arbitration.75 He bases this opinion, in part, on the principle of *effet utile.* Judge Schwebel notes that it is well known that consent is an essential element of ICSID jurisdiction. He says, therefore, that to interpret \"if it so provides\", as Venezuela does, to mean \"if the ICSID Convention itself provides consent to arbitration\" is to render Article 22 meaningless because it is not possible to interpret the ICSID Convention as constituting a state\u2019s consent to ICSID arbitration.76 The Claimant further submits that the disclaimer that Article 22 is \"without prejudice to the possibility of using the systems of litigation provided for in the Venezuelan laws in force, where applicable\" would also be meaningless if Venezuela\u2019s interpretation is accepted, because the purpose of the disclaimer is to provide an alternative method of dispute resolution to investors.77\n\nOpinion of Judge Stephen M. Schwebel on October 24, 2011 **(\"Opinion** of Judge Schwebel\") [22]-[23].\n\nOpinion of Judge Schwebel [26].\n\nClaimant\u2019s Counter-Memorial [ 182]-[l83].\n\n85.\n\nThe Respondent asserts that the purpose and effect of Article 22, when construed in accordance with its interpretation of the text, is to do nothing more than confirm Venezuela\u2019s intention to abide by its existing obligations under its bilateral investment treaties, the MIGA Convention and the ICSID Convention. In the view of the Respondent, Article 22 does not create new obligations or add to Venezuela\u2019s existing international obligations as suggested by the Claimant.78 The Respondent refers the Tribunal to the decision in *Cemex* and the writings of several commentators to support its contention that the principle of *effet utile* \"does not provide a license to give effect to any conceivable conception of effectiveness that an interpreter may entertain with regard to the provision under interpretation\" but rather excludes \"wholly ineffective results\".79 The Respondent submits that the principle of *effet utile* is therefore not applicable to Article 22 as it already has a recognised purpose.80 As to the Claimant\u2019s submission in relation to the words \"without prejudice\", the Respondent says that its purpose is \"to make clear that where international arbitration is mandated and has actually commenced - whether under bilateral investment treaties, the MIGA Convention or the ICSID Convention - resort to the national courts may still remain as an option for the investor\".81\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply Memorial [146]-[147].\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply Memorial [155]-[160].\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply Memorial [145]-[161].\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply Memorial [163].\n\n**(b) Bilateral Investment Treaties**\n-------------------------------------\n\n86.\n\nIn its written submissions, the Respondent refers to the 29 bilateral investment treaties that it has entered into, of which 17 had been signed and were in force prior to the enactment of the Investment Law in 1999.82 The Respondent argues that the text of the bilateral investment treaties in force \"shows that in 1999 the Republic knew how to draft an obligatory consent to international arbitration when that was its intention\".83 The Respondent refers the Tribunal to the text of Article 8 of the bilateral investment treaty with Barbados,84 by way of example, and submits that \"[t]he language of consent contained in other Venezuelan bilateral investment treaties also stands in stark contrast to Article 22 of the Investment Law\".85\n\nRespondent\u2019s Memorial [43]; and Exhibit EU-6, which sets out consents to arbitration in Venezuelan bilateral investment treaties in force as of October 1999. See also Respondent\u2019s Reply Memorial [73].\n\nRespondent\u2019s Memorial [43].\n\nExhibit RL-30, Agreement Between the Government of the Republic of Venezuela and the Government of Barbados for the Promotion and Protection of Investments, signed at Bridgetown on July 15, 1994, entered into force on October 31, 1995, 1984 U.N.T.S. 169, Article 8: \"Disputes between one Contracting Party and a national or company of the other Contracting Party concerning an obligation of the former under this Agreement in relation to the investment of the latter, shall at the request of the national or company concerned be submitted to the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes, for settlement by arbitration or conciliation under the Convention on Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of other States opened for signature at Washington on March 18 1965.\" Respondent\u2019s Memorial [44],\n\nRespondent\u2019s Memorial [44],\n\n87.\n\nThe Claimant submits that \"the structure of the Investment Law is similar to that of the Venezuelan BITs\", noting that there is \"no requirement that consent to international arbitration always be expressed in the exact same way\".86 The Claimant further argues that the drafting differences between the Investment Law and Venezuela\u2019s bilateral investment treaties do not mean that the Investment Law does not provide consent because a bilateral investment treaty and an investment law are two different legal instruments, such that \"[w]hat may be said in the former instrument has little bearing on the latter\".87\n\nClaimant\u2019s Counter-Memorial [85].\n\nClaimant\u2019s Counter-Memorial [95].\n\n88.\n\nThe Claimant suggests that Venezuela\u2019s reasons for departing from the structure of consent to arbitration in its bilateral investment treaties in drafting Article 22 of the Investment Law is unclear and is a question best answered by reference to the *travaux pr\u00e9paratoires* or by the drafters. It submits that the language of the bilateral investment treaties was considered but ultimately rejected, and refers the Tribunal to paragraph 31 of the Second Witness Statement of Mr. Werner Corrales, dated 25 April, 2012 (\"Second Witness Statement of Mr. Corrales\"):\n\n\"As Mr. Corrales\u2019 witness statement confirms, the differences in language between Article 22 and Venezuela\u2019s BITs can be explained by the drafter\u2019s effort to simplify and shorten the intricate language of the BIT clauses.\"88\n\nClaimant\u2019s Rejoinder [79].\n\n89.\n\nThe existence and contextual effect of bilateral investment treaties was addressed at some length in the course of the hearing. During cross-examination, Mr. Corrales re-stated his view \"that when considering longer texts that we considered during the preparation of the draft, we made an effort to shorten those texts\".89 He added: \"I remember one of the texts that was perhaps half page long, and that we discussed how to put the ideas in a simple form, in a more simple form\".90 When asked whether he thought that the bilateral investment treaties \"were too complicated\", he responded that: \"I couldn\u2019t say that BITs are or were considered at that moment too complicated. What I say is that at a certain moment the draft was too long and we considered that it was necessary to shorten it.\"91 Mr. Corrales was then asked if he looked at any bilateral investment treaties when he was preparing the draft. He responded:\n\n\"I cannot affirm or deny perfectly that we considered one or two or three or none of the BITs, but let me-this part, from now on, is my opinion that it sounds logic that Gonzalo, being an experienced lawyer, may have consulted BITs. But that is different from having rejected the language of BITs because they were complicated. What I said is we had\u2014not only in Article 22\u2014also in a section which is more dedicated to instruments for policy for industrial development and so on, we found them too complicated\u2014too long, and we wanted to shorten them. \"92\n\nHearing on Jurisdiction Transcript Day 1, 156:4 -6.\n\nHearing on Jurisdiction Transcript Day 1, 156:9-11.\n\nHearing on Jurisdiction Transcript Day 1,156:14 -17.\n\nHearing on Jurisdiction Transcript Day 1, 159:18-160-6.\n\n90.\n\nThe language of Venezuela\u2019s bilateral investment treaties was also raised during the cross examination of Judge Schwebel. In response to a question from the Tribunal, Judge Schwebel agreed that based on his general knowledge of BITs, the structure and text of Article 22 did not track the consent provision of any BIT with which he was familiar.93\n\nHearing on Jurisdiction Transcript Day 2, 402:20-403-2.\n\n**(c) SPP**\n-----------\n\n91.\n\nThe Claimant places reliance on *SPP* and the similarities that Claimant says can be drawn between the wording and approach of the relevant Egyptian and Venezuelan investment laws.\n\n92.\n\n*SPP* concerned the interpretation of the Article 8 of Law No. 43, concerning the Investment of Arab and Foreign Funds and the Free Zones (\"Egyptian Investment Law\"), to determine whether it provided for Egypt\u2019s consent to ICSID arbitration. The Egyptian Investment Law has been translated as follows:\n\n\"Investment disputes in respect of the implementation provisions of this Law **shall** be **settled** in a manner to be agreed upon with the investor, or within the framework of the agreements in force between the Arab Republic of Egypt and in the investor\u2019s home country, **or within the framework of the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between the State and the nationals of other countries** to which Egypt has adhered by virtue of Law No. 90 of 1971, **where such Convention applies\"** (emphasis added).\n\n93.\n\nEgypt argued that:\n\n\"Article 8 of the Egyptian Investment Law contains no language expressly consenting to the jurisdiction of the Centre and that on its face the first paragraph of Article 8 is nothing more than a nonlimitative list of possible methods of dispute settlement which may be negotiated by the investor and the Egyptian Government on a case-by-case basis. Consequently... a separate ad hoc expression of consent is required to establish the jurisdiction of the Centre\".94\n\n*SPP* [73].\n\n94.\n\nEgypt contended that the requirement for a separate *ad hoc* agreement was implicit in the phrases \"within the framework of the Convention\" and \"where [the Convention] applies\".95 It maintained that the \"framework\" of the ICSID Convention included the requirement of a separate written consent to jurisdiction and that the phrase \"where it applies\" reserved the conditions of the applicability of the ICSID Convention, including the requirements of a special written agreement to submit to the jurisdiction of ICSID.96\n\n*SPP* [91].\n\n*Id.*\n\n95.\n\nAgainst this view, SPP argued that Article 8 established a mandatory, hierarchic sequence of dispute resolution procedures and that if the parties had not agreed a method of dispute resolution, and there was no applicable bilateral investment treaty in force, legal disputes arising directly out of investments were to be settled by the procedures specified in the ICSID Convention if the investor\u2019s state was a party to the ICSID Convention.97\n\n*SPP* [72].\n\n96.\n\nThe tribunal in *SPP* identified a number of considerations that made it unable to accept Egypt\u2019s argument. Amongst those considerations was the following:\n\n\"To interpret the phrases \u2018within the framework of the Convention\u2019 and \u2018where it applies\u2019 to mean that the Parties to an investment dispute must execute a separate agreement to establish consent to the Centre\u2019s jurisdiction would also destroy the internal logic of Article 8 and render much of that provision superfluous... No valid method of legal interpretation would warrant the conclusion that the express reference to the Convention in Article 8 is meaningless or pleonastic...\".98\n\n*SPP* [94].\n\n97.\n\nThe Claimant in this case submits that *SPP* is relevant to the present proceedings because the language used in the Egyptian Investment Law is \"strikingly similar language to that at issue here\".99 During cross examination, Judge Schwebel said that he had not seen any consent provision in an investment law that has the compound structure of the Venezuelan Investment Law dealing with bilateral investment treaties, MIGA and ICSID, noting that \"I think that\u2019s quite original. But, of course, if you look, for example, at the Egyptian Investment Law, which was in point in the SPP case, there is phraseology which is strikingly similar to Article 22.\"100\n\nClaimant\u2019s Counter-Memorial [88].\n\nHearing on Jurisdiction Transcript Day 2, 403:19-404-5.\n\n98.\n\nThe Respondent argues in response that the text of Article 8 of the Egyptian Investment Law \"differs markedly from Article 22\".101 The Respondent says that unlike Article 22 of the Investment Law, Article 8 of the Egyptian Investment Law provided for a hierarchy of remedies culminating in ICSID arbitration as the most general and that it was principally on this basis that the tribunal determined Article 8 constituted consent on the part of Egypt to ICSID arbitration.102\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply Memorial [212].\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply Memorial [213].\n\n99.\n\nThe previous ICSID decisions concerning Article 22 of the Investment Law - *Mobil, Cemex* and *Brandes -* all make reference to *SPP.* However, they all did so primarily in the context of determining the standard of interpretation to be applied to Article 22.103 This Tribunal has not found any indication in the respective decisions and awards to suggest that the *Mobil, Cemex* or *Brandes* tribunals considered or made any determination in relation to the similarities and distinctions to be drawn between Article 8 of the Egyptian Investment Law and Article 22 of the Investment Law, nor did they consider the relevant of the findings of the tribunal in *SPP* in so far as it relates to those similarities and differences.\n\n*Brandes* [82]; *Cemex* [73], [86]; *Mobil* [79].\n\n**(d) Tribunal\u2019s Conclusion on the Plain Meaning of Article 22**\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n100.\n\nAs can readily be observed from the Parties\u2019 submissions, the question as to whether Article 22 constitutes consent to ICSID jurisdiction permits different views. The Claimant interprets the words \"if it so provides\" to mean \"if the \u2018applicable\u2019 treaty or agreement \u2018provides\u2019 for international arbitration for the settlement of potential disputes\" and notes that the ICSID Convention \"undoubtedly \u2018provides\u2019 for arbitration before ICSID\".104 The Respondent, on the other hand, interprets the words \"if it so provides\" to mean \"if the respective treaty or agreement provides, according with its terms, that the dispute shall be submitted to international arbitration, not if the respective treaty or agreement provides facilities for international arbitration of disputes\".105\n\nClaimant\u2019s Counter-Memorial [103]-[104].\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply Memorial [91] (footnotes omitted).\n\n101.\n\nThe words \"shall be submitted\" are to be contrasted with the potential invocation by \"should it so provide\" of the requirement for written consent \"to arbitrate the dispute\" under Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention, which is additional to mere adoption by a state of the ICSID Convention. Of course the question of whether any such additional written consent is required itself begs the question of whether the words \"shall be submitted\" can themselves constitute such consent, as the Claimant argues, on the grounds that the proviso is satisfied by the ICSID Convention providing for international arbitration between investors and States.\n\n102.\n\nIf wording such as that used in bilateral investment treaties for acceptance of ICSID jurisdiction had been adopted, instead of that appearing in Article 22, little difficulty would be presented in determining whether the Investment Law constituted a consent. The adoption of the particular wording of Article 22, as opposed to that used in Venezuela\u2019s bilateral investment treaties, a matter that was the subject of Mr. Corrales\u2019 evidence and is addressed below, will be relevant to evaluation of the evidence of intention before the Tribunal. However it falls to this Tribunal to express a view on the plain meaning of the provision as it was drafted.\n\n103.\n\nThat such a means of consent to ICSID jurisdiction by way of an Investment Law is possible is exemplified by the *SPP* decision where the wording of the relevant provision is similar but not identical to that of Article 22. Both Article 8 of the Egyptian Investment Law and Article 22 contain a positive statement: \"shall be settled\" and \"shall be submitted\" (respectively). Both contain a similar qualification - namely \"where such Convention applies\" (in Article 8 of the Egyptian Investment Law) and \"to which [is] applicable the provisions of the... Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States (ICSID)\" (in Article 22 of the Venezuelan Investment Law) \u2014 although Article 22 also contains additional words in relation to the ICSID Convention (\"should it so provide\") that are not found in Article 8. Article 22 refers to treaties or agreements for promotion and enforcement investments, MIGA and ICSID, whereas the Egyptian Investment Law only refers to ICSID. There is therefore more potential application of the qualification in Article 22 than in Article 8.\n\n104.\n\nAlthough the decisions in *Mobil, Cemex* and *Brandes* did not deal with the argument advanced by the Claimant regarding the applicability of *SPP* to the interpretation of Article 22, when considered together these decisions clearly demonstrate that different approaches may be taken to the question of whether provisions such as Article 22 of the Investment Law and Article 8 of the Egyptian Investment Law, being similar (but not identical) in their structure and content, are capable of providing the consent required by Article 25 of the ICSID Convention.\n\n105.\n\nThe Tribunal is of the view that the text of Article 22 is ambiguous. As there is more than one possible interpretation of Article 22, the principle of *effet utile* is not of itself capable of altering this conclusion or providing a clearer view one way or the other.\n\n106.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that its assessment of the plain meaning of Article 22 is in accordance with that of the tribunals in *Mobil, Cemex* and *Brandes,* which found the text of Article 22 to be \"confusing and imprecise\",106 \"ambiguous and obscure\",107 with \"no natural meaning\".108\n\n*Brandes* [86].\n\n*Mobil* [111].\n\n*Cemex* [103].\n\n107.\n\nThe Tribunal concludes that the plain meaning of Article 22 does not point to the conclusion that Venezuela intended to give its consent to arbitrate at ICSID. In order to determine Venezuela\u2019s intention in enacting the Investment Law, it is therefore necessary to look beyond the words of Article 22, in order to determine whether, as the Claimant asserts, that provision establishes the intention of Venezuela to provide its consent to ICSID arbitration.\n\n**2. Venezuela\u2019s Intention**\n----------------------------\n\n108.\n\nThe Claimant relies on evidence that it has put before the Tribunal relating to Venezuela\u2019s intention in enacting the Investment Law. Such evidence can be divided into two categories: (1) evidence that the Claimant submits is materially different to that before the *Mobil, Cemex* and *Brandes* tribunals; and (2) evidence that appears, on the face of the *Mobil, Cemex* and *Brandes* decisions, to be have been considered by the tribunals in those three cases. The Tribunal proceeds on the basis that the decisions of those tribunals - which it notes are unanimous in finding that Article 22 does not provide for jurisdiction - are not binding on this Tribunal. Nevertheless, the Tribunal is of the view that it is important to carefully consider and give due weight to the substance of those decisions. If this Tribunal was to depart from the conclusion that was reached by each of the three earlier tribunals - and done so on each occasion by unanimous decision of the three arbitrators - it would need to distinguish this case, for example by reference to new arguments and evidence that was not available to the other tribunals.109\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the new evidence in these proceedings similarly does not appear to have been before the tribunal in *Tidewater* and the relevance of that decision has been considered in this context.\n\n**(a) Category One - New Evidence**\n-----------------------------------\n\n*(i) The Evidence of Mr. Corrales*\n----------------------------------\n\n109.\n\nIn these proceedings Mr. Corrales provided two witness statements and presented himself for evidence to the Tribunal. He was cross-examined by the Respondent and questioned by the Tribunal.\n\n110.\n\nHe was not prepared to give evidence before the *Mobil, Cemex* and *Brandes* tribunals for reasons which he explained to the Tribunal.110\n\nSecond Witness Statement of Mr. Corrales [34]; Hearing on Jurisdiction Transcript Day 1, 268:1-3.\n\n111.\n\nThus the evidence of Mr. Corrales to this Tribunal represents additional material to that available to the other three Tribunals. It is appropriate to set out details of Mr. Corrales\u2019 evidence before later considering the effect of that evidence.\n\n112.\n\nBefore doing so, however, the Tribunal wishes to record that Mr. Corrales appeared to be a credible and reliable witness, notwithstanding his involvement in initiatives that are inconsistent with the policies of the present Government of the Respondent.111 He was subject to extensive skilful cross-examination by counsel for the Respondent. His answers, in the Tribunal\u2019s view, were careful and measured, and there was nothing to indicate that he was untruthful in any of the matters he addressed. The issue, as will be addressed below, is not the truthfulness of what he had to say but whether his evidence is such as to establish the intention of Venezuela, in adopting Article 22, to grant its consent to ICSID jurisdiction, or limited to establishing his own belief as to what Article 22 was intended to achieve and did achieve.\n\nHearing on Jurisdiction Transcript Day 1, 268:12- 269:3.\n\n113.\n\nFrom 1996 to 2002, Mr. Corrales was Ambassador and Permanent Representative of Venezuela to the United Nations office and the World Trade Organisation in Geneva. Prior to that he held the positions of Minister of Development and President of the Foreign Trade Institute of Venezuela from 1995 to 1996 and Minister of Planning from 1994 to 1995.112\n\nFirst Witness Statement of Mr. Corrales [1].\n\n114.\n\nWithin the First Witness Statement of Mr. Corrales, he sets out his involvement in the drafting of the Investment Law as follows:\n\n\"II. The Drafting of the Investment Law\n\n6. To understand the origin and purpose of the investment law, I must first explain the opposition that I mounted to certain terms of the proposed bilateral investment treaty between the United States of America and the Republic of Venezuela (the \"USA-Venezuela BIT\") in 1998.\n\n7. In 1998 the United States and the Republic of Venezuela were very close to finalising a bilateral investment treaty. At that time, I was the Venezuelan permanent representative to the WTO, and as such, I strongly opposed some of the terms that the United States intended to impose on the treaty. In particular, I found unacceptable the United States\u2019 demand that the Republic of Venezuela refrain from imposing technology transfer-related performance requirements to investments of American investors. As a specialist in international development, I believed that an obligation of that kind would have severely restricted the Republic of Venezuela\u2019s ability to develop policies to encourage the transfer of technology from American investors to Venezuelan companies. My opposition to these terms of the US-Venezuelan BIT was widely covered by the press,\n\n8. In December 1998 Hugo Ch\u00e1vez was elected President of Venezuela. In early January 1999, President-elect Ch\u00e1vez invited me to discuss my position on the USA-Venezuela BIT, the progress of which had been disrupted by the controversy that followed to my opposition to that treaty. Dr Jorge Giordani, who later was designated member of his Cabinet, participated in that meeting. President Ch\u00e1vez and Dr Giordani manifested their interest in attracting foreign investment to Venezuela and requested suggestions to overcome the impasse on the negotiations of the USA-Venezuela BIT. All participants in the meeting including President-elect Ch\u00e1vez coincided that any foreign-investment regime, including a bilateral investment treaty, should achieve both goals of contributing to the development of Venezuela and providing effective protection to foreign investors.\n\n9. I advised President-elect Ch\u00e1vez that the best way to proceed was through the enactment of a law that would aim to achieve both goals simultaneously (a fact that was later reflected in which became Article 1 of the Investment Law) and would serve as both the framework for the promotion and protection of foreign investment and a reference for investment treaties to be negotiated.\n\n10. In the first quarter of 1999, Minister Jorge Giordani, who was in charge of the Central Office of Coordination and Planning of the Presidency of the Republic (Oficina Central de Coordinaci\u00f3n y Planificaci\u00f3n de la Presidencia de la Rep\u00fablica, also known as CORDIPLAN), asked me to coordinate the preparation of the draft of what later became the Investment Law.\n\n11. I am an expert in international trade, investment and development matters but not a lawyer. For that reason I suggested Minister Giordani to include a legal expert in the drafting team. I recommended Gonzalo Capriles, a specialist in international economic law, who had been the legal counsel of the Foreign Trade Institute (Instituto de Comercio Exterior), the institution in charge of international trade negotiations of Venezuela, over which I had presided as a Minister between 1995 and 1996.\n\n12. In response to Minister Giordani\u2019s request, I prepared the Terms of Reference for the work of Mr. Capriles as a consultant, which defined the aims and principles of the draft law. Based on these terms of reference, under my coordination, Mr. Capriles and I prepared the draft of the Investment Law that was presented to President Ch\u00e1vez.\n\nIII. The Intent of the drafters of the Investment Law regarding resort to international arbitration\n\n13. In the draft version of the Investment Law that we prepared, Mr. Capriles and I included an option for international investors to resort to international arbitration under three different circumstances. First, international arbitration was to be available where there is an agreement or a treaty between the investor\u2019s country of origin and Venezuela. Second, international arbitration also was to be available where the provisions of the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency applies. Third, international arbitration was also to be available where the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States applies.\n\n14. To my knowledge, the draft investment law was subject to one review by the Economic Cabinet, and the final review by the lull Council of Ministers. I participated in the two mentioned meetings in which I made presentations of the draft Investment Law and responded to questions posed by the Ministers. I particularly remember that in the review by the Economic Cabinet, we discussed the issue of international arbitration, and only one of the persons in the meeting opposed the proposal made by the drafters that the Investment Law should provide foreign investors with a right to pursue international arbitration as a means to resolve disputes with the Republic. The deputy minister of Energy and Mines, Mr. Alvaro Silva-Calder\u00f3n, opposed that initiative invoking the Calvo doctrine, but the meeting concluded with no objection by the Economic Cabinet to the proposal made by the drafters on the resort to international arbitration.\n\n15. I do not have the required juridical background to legally analyze Article 22 of the Investment Law. But I do know that in preparing the draft of that law, my intent and that of Mr. Capriles was to include in it an open offer to foreign investors to arbitrate disputes with the Republic of Venezuela if they so deemed it convenient, under the circumstances already cited in paragraph 13 above.\n\n16. To the best of my knowledge, the Council of Ministers adopted the version of Article 22 of the Investment Law that had been proposed by the drafters, and that version is included in the text of the Investment Law that was ultimately published in the Gaceta Oficial in October 1999\".\n\n115.\n\nIn the Second Witness Statement of Mr. Corrales, he says:\n\n\"19. Based on my participation in the drafting and discussion of the Investment Law at the time, I confirm that the Investment Law was intended to include consent for international investors to resort to international arbitration even where there is no bilateral investment treaty in place.\n\n20. I also confirm that I understood that I was authorized to include such consent in the Investment Law in order to provide appropriate protection to foreign investors in Venezuela, with the intention to attract them and to maintain them in the country. Moreover, I confirm that both the economic cabinet and the council of ministers agreed with that intention, which was made clear in the presentations I made to the two bodies and their discussions in which I participated.\"\n\n116.\n\nDuring the hearing Mr. Corrales was cross-examined by the Respondent and asked questions by the Tribunal.\n\n117.\n\nDuring cross-examination, Mr. Corrales was asked why he selected Mr. Capriles to assist with the drafting of the Investment Law and how they approached the task. Mr. Corrales responded that the main reason for selecting Mr. Capriles was that Mr. Corrales had worked with Mr. Capriles at the Instituto de Comercio\u2014Institute for International Trade and in his capacity as Minister of Trade and Minister of Development of Venezuela, and had made the assessment that he was \"a very experienced and very knowledgeable person\".113 With respect to the drafting process, Mr. Corrales stated that Mr. Capriles prepared the first draft, but that \"subsequent drafts were always discussed by the two of us, and when we ended in agreement, and not only regarding Article 22, but any other Article, we considered it is complete\".114\n\nHearing on Jurisdiction Transcript Day 1, 135:17-18.\n\nHearing on Jurisdiction Transcript Day 1, 129:19-22.\n\n118.\n\nMr. Corrales was asked by the Tribunal to describe the difference between the composition of the Economic Cabinet and the Council of Ministers. He explained:\n\n\"The members of the Economic Cabinet are the Ministers of areas related to the economy. What was\u2014at the moment one has the name of CORDIPLAN, which was the Ministry for Coordination and Economic Planning; minister for Finance; the Minister of Foreign Affairs attends some meetings when discussions include or issues to be discussed include economic\u2014international and economic relations, the Minister for Oil and Mines or for hydrocarbons; the Minister for Trade and Industry at the moment. Also the Minister of Labor attends when labor issues are discussed. Those are the members of the Economic Cabinet that I remember.\n\nThe Council of Ministers is integrated by all Ministers, of the social area, the economic areas, the political\u2014for instance, the Minister of Government or the Minister of Interior or the Minister of Defense. That is the difference, sir.\"115\n\nHearing on Jurisdiction Transcript Day 1, 220:8 -221:3.\n\n119.\n\nMr. Corrales was then questioned by the Tribunal as to the nature and extent of his discussions with members of the Economic Cabinet and the Council of Ministers regarding his view that Article 22 was to be treated as an expression of consent by Venezuela to jurisdiction of ICSID arbitration. He responded:\n\n\"I explained, because of the President of the meeting\u2014of the Economic Cabinet, I explained in detail that, based on the provision of the law, international investors were given the right to decide by themselves if they occur or they recurred to international arbitration or national tribunals. I didn\u2019t go to details like saying one is ICSID or the other is WTO, et cetera, but it was clear because what I consider politically important was what had been discussed in the Economic Cabinet.\n\n\u2026\n\nWhich was access, unilateral access. I mean, the investor had the right to choose between going to international\u2014to international arbitration or making use of national courts.\"116\n\n\"In the discussions in the Economic Cabinet, I explained in more detail because Ministers in the Economic Cabinet are more knowledgeable about these things, and particularly some of them have relations with PdVSA and so on. I went more in detail, and I explained the three cases. In the explanation I made before the Council of Ministers, I didn\u2019t go to technical details\".117\n\n\"Regarding Article 22, in the Economic Cabinet.  \n What happened there was that a discussion was opened on the fact that Venezuela was trying to reform the institutions and trying to open its economy and trying to be more attractive to investments, and the general view, I must say, was that international arbitration is a positive step that Venezuela offering international arbitration, et cetera, is a positive step from Venezuela to become a country or an economy which is attractive to foreign investments.\"118\n\nHearing on Jurisdiction Transcript Day 1, 226:16-227:8.\n\nHearing on Jurisdiction Transcript Day 1, 228:22-229:7.\n\nHearing on Jurisdiction Transcript Day 1, 252:4-14.\n\n120.\n\nThe Tribunal further questioned whether any individual Ministers expressly agreed with Mr. Corrales and confirmed that it was their intention for Article 22 of the Investment Law to contain a unilateral consent to ICSID jurisdiction, to which Mr. Corrales responded:\n\n\"Sir, what happened was that at the end, the only person that had raised that position was the Vice Minister of Oil and Hydrocarbons, and the rest participated on the contrary, saying that Venezuela should open\u2014should be open to that.\n\nThe arguments that had been used by Vice Minister Silva Calder\u00f3n that, by the way, had been discussed in the Congress of Venezuela since 1989, I would say they were overruled by the opinion of the rest of the Ministers participating in that meeting, although I said before decisions in the meetings of the Economic Cabinet are not taken by voting. There is a minute that is taken, but there was no objection. At the end, there was no objection after the discussion ended or came to an end.\"119\n\nHearing on Jurisdiction Transcript Day 1, 252:22 -253:14.\n\n121.\n\nThe Tribunal also explored Mr. Corrales\u2019 understanding of the ICSID Convention. Mr. Corrales stated that it was clear to him that a party to the ICSID Convention does not consent to the jurisdiction of ICSID by virtue only of being a party to that Convention and that something more was required.120 He believed that Article 22 satisfied the ICSID Convention\u2019s requirements for something more:\n\n\"...I have read that several times in Spanish, perhaps I don\u2019t have, perhaps - no. I don\u2019t have the legal expertise, but in plain Spanish, there it is said that if investors are in situation A, B, or C, they can decide by themselves if they come to local tribunals or to international arbitration.\"121\n\nHearing on Jurisdiction Transcript Day 1, 249:5-13.\n\nHearing on Jurisdiction Transcript Day 1, 250:4-10.\n\n122.\n\nOther subjects addressed during cross-examination and questioning by the Tribunal included: the absence of contemporaneous statements by the Respondent or by Mr. Corrales following the adoption of the Investment Law that supported the view Mr. Corrales now expressed; his silence during the passage of time between the adoption of the Investment Law, his participation at a seminar in April, 2009, and his reasons for providing witness statements in these proceedings; and the inconsistency between the wording of Article 22 and the terms of consent to ICSID jurisdiction contained in bilateral investment treaties between Venezuela and other countries.\n\n123.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the Respondent has chosen not to present any evidence to contradict the views expressed by Mr. Corrales regarding his role in the preparation of the Investment Law, including the meetings he attended at the Economic Cabinet and the Council of Ministers, and the Respondent\u2019s intentions with respect to Article 22. No evidence has been put before the Tribunal, for example, to suggest the unavailability of Ministers who were present at the meeting of the Economic Cabinet and the Council of Ministers at which the decision of the Government was made regarding the adoption of the Investment Law. Rather, the Respondent argues that the evidence of Mr. Corrales is irrelevant for the purpose of ascertaining whether the Respondent consented to ICSID arbitration, and cites the award in *Brandes* in support of this contention. The Respondent adopted this approach no doubt being aware that the Tribunal may not accept that view, and may look to extrinsic evidence of intention, including by reference to the circumstances of the preparation and enactment of the Law.\n\n124.\n\nSome evidence was put before us - in the form of exhibits R-53122 and R-54123 - on which Venezuela relied to raise questions about the absence of Mr. Corrales\u2019 testimony to support the claims for jurisdiction in the *Conoco* and *Mobil* cases. The Tribunal notes that the absence of testimony by Mr. Corrales (as well as the absence of that of Mr. Capriles) in those cases was criticised by Venezuela; the Tribunal was therefore struck by the failure of the Respondent to provide any rebuttal evidence to the witness statements of Mr. Corrales in this case, and its reliance on the decisions in *Cemex, Mobil* and *Brandes.* Further, the Tribunal notes that the Respondent was requested, on several occasions, to produce evidence that might have been in its possession and custody in relation to these matters, but failed to do so.\n\nExhibit R-53B, Transcript of the Hearing on Jurisdiction in *Conoco Philips Company and Others* v. *Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela* (ICSID Case No. ARB/07/30) (Case Pending) *(\"Conoco\"),* Question of Venezuela to Mr. Brewer-Carias, at 2404:20-21.\n\nExhibit R-54, Transcript of the Hearing on Jurisdiction in *Mobil,* at 197.\n\n125.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that it might be entitled to infer from the absence of such rebuttal evidence tendered by the Respondent that the version of events offered by Mr. Corrales with regard to events at certain meetings of the Economic Cabinet and the Council of Ministers - and the decisions that Mr. Corrales claims were there taken was not contradicted by witness evidence available to it. However, for the reasons set out below at paragraph 146, the Respondent\u2019s failure to provide such evidence, and the inference that might be drawn, is not of itself sufficient to establish an intention on the part of Venezuela of its acceptance of ICSID jurisdiction. Rather, the Tribunal considers that, in the face of ambiguities in the meaning and effect of Article 22, what is required is direct evidence of intent on the part of Venezuela to consent to ICSID jurisdiction. This has not been made available to the satisfaction of the Tribunal.\n\n*(ii) Exhibits WCL-1 and WCL-3*\n-------------------------------\n\n126.\n\nThese exhibits are documents said to have been discovered by Mr. Corrales upon his return to Geneva in late 2011, during the Claimant\u2019s preparation for the hearing on jurisdiction, some 12 years after the Investment Law was adopted. These documents were not available as evidence to the other three ICSID tribunals that considered Article 22 of the Investment Law.\n\n127.\n\nExhibit WCL-1124 is a document setting out the terms of reference prepared by Mr. Corrales for the engagement of a consultant to assist in the preparation of the draft Investment Law. The terms of reference described the functions to be fulfilled by the proposed Law, its general objectives, and its contents. Paragraph 10 is entitled \"Content of the Law\" and states:\n\n\"10. Dispute resolution in the case of foreign investments:\n\nThe law should cover aspects relating to the mechanisms for the resolution of disputes that may arise, between the Venezuelan State and the State of which the investor is a national, as well as between the Venezuelan State and the investor. In both cases the Consultant should analyse the options and present the arguments for the advantages and disadvantages of such [options]. In particular, those [options] should be studies which relate to the disputes between States [the different mechanisms set forth for this purpose in the United Nations Charter] and to the disputes between the foreign investor and the Venezuelan State (quite often would be to offer the former the possibility of resorting to the Venezuelan Tribunals or to an international tribunal mechanism, with the understanding that upon opting for one of those procedures the case could no longer be filed under the other procedure, in order to avoid contradictory decisions)\".\n\nExhibit WCL-1, Terms of Reference for the Formulation of the Draft Law on Investments\n\n128.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that paragraph 10 provides only for \"options\" to be studied, and makes no direct reference to ICSID.\n\n129.\n\nExhibit WCL-3125 is a document, dated 30 June, 1999, that contains comments by Mr. Corrales on a draft investment law. These comments criticise \"the Draft of a Decree-Law on the Promotion and Protection of Investments\". Section 2.4 of the document states:\n\n\"2.4 Access to dispute resolution mechanisms\n\nArticle 20 of the Draft contemplates that the State and the investors may refer their disputes in relation to an investment to the Courts of the Republic or to arbitration tribunals constitution in accordance with international treaties.\n\nThis wording does not grant any greater safeguards to investors, because it is clear that they will always be able to resort to Venezuelan Courts, to which our State is obviously subject. What could convert this into a \"asset\" of the Draft would be the submission of the State to the jurisdiction of an international arbitral tribunal. Indeed, it says that \"the State and investors may submit a dispute (...) to arbitral tribunals but this would seem to imply that the choice of that jurisdiction is by agreement between the State and the investor, and does not offer the latter the possibility of unilaterally resorting to arbitration as the bilateral treaties for the protection of investments already do.\"\n\nExhibit WCL-3, Comments on the Draft of a Decree-Law on the Promotion and Protection of Investments\n\n130.\n\nAs with the previous document, this one makes no direct reference to ICSID.\n\n131.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that these documents alone are insufficient to establish that Venezuela intended the Investment Law to provide consent to ICSID arbitration. Whilst they may not be inconsistent with Mr. Corrales\u2019 own belief that, irrespective of the views of the Government, he intended Article 22 of the Investment Law to contain a unilateral consent to ICSID arbitration, but they fall short of establishing explicit intent on the part of the Venezuela to consent to ICSID jurisdiction.\n\n*(iii) The Ferm\u00edn Toro Case*\n----------------------------\n\n132.\n\nThe Claimant has also put before the Tribunal new material in the form of Exhibit LAC-16126, an English translation of excerpts from the Court file of the constitutional chamber of Venezuela\u2019s Supreme Court of Justice for the *Ferm\u00edn Toro* case, including written submissions by the Attorney General of Venezuela. As far as the Tribunal is aware, these extracts from the Court file, and the submissions of the Attorney General of the State of Venezuela were not available to the *Mobil, Cemex* or *Brandes* tribunals. The Court was asked by petitioners to declare as unconstitutional the Investment Law, and in particular its Article 22, on the basis that it allowed individuals to submit to foreign arbitral organs disputes which were essentially matters of public order. In a submission to the Supreme Court, the Attorney General of Venezuela made the following assertion:\n\n\"From the concatenated interpretation of the partially transcribed constitutional articles, it is evident that arbitration is admitted into our national legislation as an alternative means of justice, and by providing for national or international arbitration as a means of resolving disputes arising from the application of treaties of promotion and reciprocal protection of investments or from the Decree Law [the Investment Law], this Decree does not contradict our Constitution, since the aforementioned article supports arbitration as a method of dispute resolution.\n\nThis legislation also does not violate Section 301 of the Constitution, because although Article 22 of the contested decree refers to the admissibility to arbitration of \"disputes arising between an international investor\", it subsequently refers all dispute that fall within the provisions of international conventions signed by the Republic, which obviously are part of the existing law in our country, and provide for arbitration for domestic investments abroad, if so provided in the relevant treaties. Furthermore, in the final part of that article the possibility of using contentious routes provided for in current Venezuelan legislation is established\".\n\nExhibit LAC-16, Court file of Expediente 00-1348 at p. 193 - 194.\n\n133.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the submissions of the Respondent\u2019s Attorney General in the *Ferm\u00edn Toro* case are expressed in terms that broadly repeat the text of Article 22. For this reason, the Tribunal considers that this material leaves open the meaning and effect of Article 22 as regards ICSID, and cannot assist the Claimant in reaching a conclusion that the Respondent considered Article 22 to contain its consent to ICSID arbitration in respect of disputes arising under the Investment Law. Moreover, this was a case in which the petitioners failed for want of standing, and did not result in any finding of the Supreme Court as to what Article 22 did or did not mean. Accordingly, the Tribunal concludes that this material cannot be regarded as being of any material weight or effect as to the intentions of Venezuela with regard to ICSID consent.\n\n*(iv) Recordkeeping Evidence*\n-----------------------------\n\n134.\n\nIn the course of these proceedings the Claimant has made specific document requests. In particular, the Claimant requested that the Respondent produce a number of documents, including: the contract between Gonzalo Capriles and the Venezuelan Government concerning his work relating to the Investment Law; correspondence or memoranda between Gonzalo Capriles and the Venezuelan Government concerning the draft Investment Law; files of the Council of Ministers including Cabinet documents; Cabinet meeting minutes and reports to and from the cabinet reflecting discussions of the Investment Law or drafts of the Investment Law in the meetings of the \"Economic Cabinet\" held in the last week of August 1999; and files of the Council of Ministers relating to similar matters.127\n\nClaimant\u2019s first request for the Respondent to produce documents (22 August 2011).\n\n135.\n\nThe Respondent opposed these requests, which became the subject of the Tribunal\u2019s Procedural Order No. 1 dated 19 September 2011. By this Order the Tribunal noted that the Respondent asserted that it did not have the requested documents in its possession custody or control, and directed the Respondent to produce them or provide a statement in writing to confirm that, after a thorough and careful search for the documents, it had ascertained that they were not in its possession, custody or control. The Tribunal also offered the Respondent an opportunity to make submissions on privilege, to the extent necessary. In its response to Procedural Order No. 1, the Respondent advised that, after a thorough and careful search, the documents requested had not been found and that any question of privilege was moot.128 The Claimant has subsequently asserted that the Respondent\u2019s failure to produce the requested documents should lead the Tribunal to draw adverse inferences against the Respondent, in relation to the matters that would be addressed in the requested documents.\n\nRespondent\u2019s answer to Procedural Order No. 1 concerning the production of documents (27 September 2011).\n\n136.\n\nIn May 2012, eight months after the Claimant first filed a request for document production, the Respondent produced Exhibit R-51 and Exhibit R-52. These exhibits contain exchanges of correspondence between Gladys Maria Guti\u00e9rrez Alvarado (the then Attorney General of Venezuela) and Mr. Capriles during August 2009. They also refer to other documents that the Tribunal considers were likely to have been in the Respondent\u2019s possession and which were the subject of Procedural Order No. 1, including Mr. Capriles\u2019 agreement to provide advice, as well as early drafts of the Investment Law.\n\n137.\n\nIn the course of the hearing further evidence was provided as to the existence of the requested documents that the Respondent had failed to produce.\n\n138.\n\nThe Tribunal asked Mr. Corrales whether there was an administrative dossier concerning the Investment Law held by the Venezuelan Government, to which he responded: \"I didn\u2019t see it, but I know that the practice is that, before final approval, after being considered by the Council of Ministers, even before being considered by the Council of Ministers, but anyway, before it is published in Gaceta Oficial, any decision has to go to the Procuradur\u00eda General de la Republica\".129 When asked by the Tribunal whether Mr. Capriles\u2019 terms of reference and employment contract were part of an administrative dossier, Mr. Corrales said:\n\n\"Yes. And there must be a contract, and CORDIPLAN must have--if practices that were in place when I was a Minister of CORDIPLAN continued, and I think it is normal, there must be a contract containing the Terms of Reference, a contract for Gonzalo Capriles in CORDIPLAN, there must be copy of that contract with the Terms of Reference at the Procuradur\u00eda General de la Republica. That I am sure.\"130\n\nHearing on Jurisdiction Transcript Day 1, 255:19-256:3.\n\nHearing on Jurisdiction Transcript Day 1, 256:15-22.\n\n139.\n\nThe Tribunal questioned the Claimant\u2019s witness, Mr. Brewer-Carias, a professor of administrative law, about the administrative practices of the Venezuelan Government and its use of dossiers. Mr. Brewer-Carias stated:\n\n\"The general principle in Venezuela establishing the administrative procedure law and in the public administration law is providing for a written administrative procedure.\n\nSo, the compulsory formation of a file, an expediente is necessary for each sort of cases not only petition from individuals before public administration but also for initiatives of the public officials. So an expediente must be always open, and this is to be kept during the whole procedure up to the end of the procedure; and, in that expediente or file, must be filed all the documents. So, this is the general principle. You have to have everything together in writing and normally numbered. That\u2019s the general principle, as it is in all our Latin American administrative law all over our countries.\n\nRegarding specifically the process of enacting a law to a Decree-Law, as is the case of the Investment Law, in the Cabinet, in the Council of Ministers, the initiative of a proposal is normally given to the Minister of this sector. This is the normal way. So the Minister must prepare a writing document. This writing document with the exposici\u00f3n de motivos, with the motives of the proposal, and the text of the law must be submitted to the President in order to be presented into the consideration of the Council of Ministers or the Economic Cabinet.\n\nSo, since the beginning, it is a writing document; and, in this process, that person responsible of the Project must kept all the dossiers, not only the proposal but all the other written elements regarding that law or that decree or regulation. It applies to all these normative procedures, beginning with the law enabling the executive to enact that law.\n\nAnd this is normally in the hands of the public official responsible of that Minister of the sector in charge of the Project or another public official in charge, and this goes to the Council of Ministers, the whole bunches of paper, and it goes to all the Ministers, so all have those documents. And when the law is approved, it is approved in a document that is written before all of them.\"131\n\nHearing on Jurisdiction Transcript Day 2, 365:7-367:6.\n\n140.\n\nThe Tribunal then questioned Mr. Brewer-Carias in relation to the likely whereabouts of the dossier concerning the Investment Law and the employment of Mr. Capriles:\n\n\"...you will have two dossiers. Because one is the contracting of a person in order to render a service. The administrative aspect of the Contract will be one dossier. But the content of his work will go to the main dossier of the project of the law.\n\n\u2026\n\nAll the draft reports on all the documents, and that in the end, in a case like the\u2014a law approved by the Council of Ministers will remain in the Council of Ministers. The Secretariat of the Council of Ministers is the final point in which, in a case of a law approved by the President in the Council of Ministers the file will be kept.\"132\n\nHearing on Jurisdiction Transcript Day 2, 367:20-368:12.\n\n141.\n\nMr. Brewer-Carias was asked what occurs if a dossier is lost and needs to be reconstructed:\n\n\"It\u2019s possible to reconstruct it because all those documents have an origin, or in the Ministry of CORDIPLAN or in the Procuradur\u00eda General de la Republica, in the Attorney General\u2019s Office, or in the Office of the Minister of Governors, and then you can reconstruct because all those documents are all over.\n\n...if the dossier is lost, somebody has to ask, and the Minister and the public official has the authority to obtain all the documents from all over the administration.\"133\n\nHearing on Jurisdiction Transcript Day 2, 368:16-369:8.\n\n142.\n\nThe Tribunal went on to question counsel for the Respondent in relation to the Respondent\u2019s efforts to locate documents requested by the Claimant. The Tribunal\u2019s exchange with counsel for the Respondent is as follows:\n\n\"ARBITRATOR TAWIL: Mr. Kahale, I would like to take you to your Exhibit R-51.  \n MR. KAHALE: Yes.  \n ARBITRATOR TAWIL: It\u2019s the exchanges with Mr. Capriles. The last letter I find from is a letter from Mr. Capriles from September 8, 2009. I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s anything after that.  \n MR. KAHALE: Not that I\u2019ve seen.  \n ARBITRATOR TAWIL: Okay. He says at the end, \"In any event, pursuant to the provisions established in Article 3 of the Organic Law of the office of the Attorney General, I have ordered a thorough revision of the documents that I keep from those times both in hard copies or electronic, and I will inform you of the results of this revision as soon as possible\".  \n Was there any follow-up? That was in 2009.  \n MR. KAHALE: Yes. Not to my knowledge, and there has been no further search or correspondence that I know of with Mr. Capriles since we did this for the Mobil Case. Obviously, we didn\u2019t do that for this case.  \n ARBITRATOR TAWIL: And what about the calls?  \n MR. KAHALE: The what?  \n ARBITRATOR TAWIL: You said that you had phone calls with them.  \n MR. KAHALE: That was at the time.  \n ARBITRATOR TAWIL: Oh, for the 2009?  \n MR. KAHALE: Yes. That was at the\u2014actually right at the time of those letters, of course. He was first contacted to get a feeling.  \n ARBITRATOR TAWIL: And having here Mr. Corrales, Venezuela did not try to approach him again?  \n MR. KAHALE: Who?  \n ARBITRATOR TAWIL: Mr. Capriles.  \n MR. KAHALE: He told us he had a conflict, and Mr. Corrales apparently-  \n ARBITRATOR TAWIL: But in order to get the documents?  \n MR. KAHALE: We did that, and he didn\u2019t provide the documents.  \n ARBITRATOR TAWIL: You did that in 2009, not after having Mr.--  \n MR. KAHALE: Yes, we did not go back to him for this case to ask again for the documents.  \n ARBITRATOR TAWIL: Thanks.  \n MR. KAHALE: Yes. And apparently Mr. Corrales did also, and he couldn\u2019t even contact him. At least that\u2019s what I thought he said or I don\u2019t know whether it was Mr. Corrales who said that or Professor Brewer. I forget. Yes?  \n PRESIDENT JONES: Can I ask whether you can help us with the position regarding the entitlement in Venezuela of a client to access of files kept by a lawyer engaged by that client.  \n MR. KAHALE: I\u2019m not an expert on that subject, Mr. President, but it\u2019s my understanding that we had a right to get those files. We\u2019re not pleased with the fact that we got that response, but, you know, what are we going to do? The politics in Venezuela, as you can imagine, are not that easy, and the last thing the Government wants to do is to do anything. You saw what Mr. Corrales\u2019s attitude was. The last thing we want to do is do anything which gives the appearance of being heavy-handed in any way.  \n PRESIDENT JONES: I should share with you my personal experiences of acting for Governments, and they are that governments are quite astute to ensure and insist upon the provision to Governments of files built by those that act for to them, and that to insist upon the provision of documents held by lawyers and consultants employed by Government would not, in my own view, be in any way unusual or heavy-handed.  \n MR. KAHALE: Yes, I understand that, Mr. President. I think the choice here was to bring the legal proceeding against Mr. Capriles, and I believe that undoubtedly that would have been misunderstood by Exxon, used by Exxon in the case against us, and the decision was made not to pursue legal proceedings, I think, for those reasons.  \n But I\u2019m not privy to those discussions. This is my speculation; and, you know, it is my understanding that we do, as a former client, have a right to have those documents, and we don\u2019t.  \n ARBITRATOR TAWIL: I\u2019m sorry, I don\u2019t understand. Is that your speculation, or is that something that you know, that they were thinking of bringing legal proceedings against Mr. Capriles?  \n MR. KAHALE: No, I didn\u2019t say they were thinking of bringing a legal proceeding. I said I think the choice would have been to bring the legal proceeding.  \n ARBITRATOR TAWIL: Okay, okay. My apologies.  \n MR. KAHALE: And obviously that has happened.  \n PRESIDENT JONES: Can I just say again, from my own experience, that the production by a lawyer of the files held for a client, including particularly a government client, would not normally require the commencement of legal proceedings, but merely a demand?  \n MR. KAHALE: That demand was made several times, Mr. President.  \n PRESIDENT JONES: Do we have material establishing that?  \n MR. KAHALE: It\u2019s those formal letters from the Attorney General to Mr. Capriles.  \n PRESIDENT JONES: I think my colleague has pointed out that there is silence following an undertaking by Mr. Capriles to investigate and look for the documents. There is not a refusal to provide the documents in the material we have before us.  \n MR. KAHALE: My understanding, Mr. President, is I don\u2019t have any response, any further correspondence, and my understanding is we were led to believe that there was no way we were going to get any cooperation from Mr. Capriles, given his firm\u2019s conflict. That\u2019s all I can tell you\".134\n\nHearing on Jurisdiction Transcript Day 3, 561:19-567:4.\n\n143.\n\nIn the course of the hearing, counsel for the Respondent confirmed that no document requests were made by the Claimants in the *Conoco* or *Mobil* cases.135\n\nHearing on Jurisdiction Transcript Day 3, 686:18-22.\n\n144.\n\nThe Tribunal has taken note of the fact that the Respondent has not produced contemporaneous documents that were responsive to the requests made by the Claimant. On the basis of the evidence that was put before the Tribunal regarding the process for administrative decision-making in Venezuela, the Tribunal concludes that it would be most surprising if files and documents of the kind requested by the Claimant had not existed at the time of enactment of the Investment Law. In the absence of more detailed explanation than that provided by the Respondent, the Tribunal considers it likely that such files and documents are still in existence today, in a form allowing for their discovery and production, or alternatively to be the subject of claims for privilege (which the Tribunal would then have been in a position to address).\n\n145.\n\nThe Respondent has tendered some correspondence relating to Mr. Capriles\u2019 files, but this merely leaves open the question of why these files could not be obtained by the Respondent, or why the material that was likely to have been provided by Mr. Capriles to the Attorney General\u2019s office (in the course of the preparation of the Investment Law) was not produced. The Tribunal considers that the explanations offered by counsel for the Respondent as to Venezuela\u2019s failure to follow up the production of Mr. Capriles\u2019 files are less than fully convincing. In these circumstances, the Tribunal considers that it might draw certain inferences from the failure to produce requested documents (as well as the failure to claim any privilege in respect of these documents), namely that the requested contemporaneous documents that relate to the preparation of the investment law (and likely to be in the possession of the Respondent) do not assist the Respondent in support of its arguments in these proceedings.\n\n146.\n\nThe Tribunal by majority considers, however, that such inferences fall well short of the direct evidence that would be needed to establish intent in the face of the ambiguities of the Investment Law. The majority of the Tribunal are of the view that inferences alone, absent direct evidence, are not sufficient to establish - that Article 22 reflects an intention on the part of Venezuela to consent to ICSID jurisdiction, as required by Article 25 of the ICSID Convention.\n\n**(b) Category Two - Common Evidence**\n--------------------------------------\n\n*(i) Evidence Relating to the Preparation and Enactment of the Investment Law*\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n147.\n\nMr. Corrales provided evidence as to the process of preparation of the Investment Law. Although his witness testimony was not available to the tribunals in the *Mobil, Cemex* or *Brandes* cases, a limited number of contemporaneous documents were available to those tribunals. These documents comprised two articles, one that was prepared during the drafting of the Investment Law, and a second that was prepared a few months after the Investment Law was enacted, expressing Mr Corrales\u2019 comments on the principles upon which the Investment Law is based.136\n\nFirst Witness Statement of Mr. Corrales [18]-[20].\n\n148.\n\nThe *Mobil* and *Cemex* tribunals concluded that these documents do not expressly state that the drafters of Article 22 intended to provide consent to ICSID arbitration in the absence of any bilateral investment treaty.137 In the *Brandes* case, the tribunal concluded that it was not necessary to determine the relevance of these publications, because \"Mr. Corrales\u2019 opinion cannot provide the basis for finding that Article 22 of the [Investment Law] contains the consent of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela to submit to ICSID arbitration\".138\n\n*Mobil* [136] and *Cemex* [132].\n\n*Brandes* [103].\n\n149.\n\nNothing in these documents is necessarily inconsistent with an intention of the Respondent to provide for disputes arising between investors and the Respondent under the Investment Law to be the subject of ICSID arbitration. The Tribunal believes that although these documents taken together do not themselves establish that intention, they are consistent with and supportive of the evidence given by Mr. Corrales regarding his explanation to the Economic Cabinet and the Council of Ministers regarding the intention of the drafters of the Investment Law for it to provide an option to investors to have disputes under the Investment Law between the investors and the State be the subject of arbitration.\n\n150.\n\nAs noted above at paragraph 102, the other contemporaneous documents relevant to the intention of Venezuela at the time of the enactment of the Investment Law were the numerous bilateral investment treaties that had been entered into by Venezuela and other States. Each of these contained an express consent by the Respondent to submit disputes arising under those treaties to ICSID arbitration.139\n\nSee also [86]-[90] above.\n\n151.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the terms of Article 22 of the Investment Law are quite different to those terms by which Venezuela agrees to ICSID arbitration in these bilateral investment treaties. The *Mobil* and *Cemex* tribunals concluded that if Venezuela had intended to provide consent to ICSID arbitration in Article 22, it \"would have been easy for the drafters of Article 22 to express that intention clearly by using any of those well-known formulas\".140 A similar conclusion is implied by the *Brandes* tribunal, which \"notes that each of [the] treaties contains a submission to ICSID jurisdiction expressed in a similar manner, and in clear and precise language\".141\n\n*Mobil* [139]. A similar finding was made in *Cemex* [137].\n\n*Brandes* [94].\n\n152.\n\nIn the course of the hearing Mr. Corrales was asked about Venezuela\u2019s bilateral investment treaties and the laws of other countries that provided for ICSID jurisdiction in clear terms. His evidence does not establish unequivocally that Mr. Capriles had the terms of these bilateral investment treaties available to him (for example, amongst the materials which Mr. Corrales had sight of during his meetings with Mr. Capriles), or that he had examples of the national laws of other states that provided for ICSID jurisdiction in clear terms. Mr. Corrales\u2019 evidence was that initial drafts of Article 22 were too long and needed to be simplified. In his view, Article 22 dealt collectively with international arbitration under bilateral investment treaties, international arbitration under MIGA,142 and ICSID arbitration. That is the reason why Mr. Corrales says Article 22 was prepared to deal with dispute settlement arising in three distinct circumstances, but did not follow the clear wording in favour of ICSID arbitration as contained in the Respondent\u2019s bilateral investment treaties.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that Chapter IX Settlement of Disputes (Articles 56-58) of the Convention establishing the MIGA does not provide for arbitration at the instance of an investor (or equivalent private party) against a State. Its inclusion in the Investment Law appears to be based on a misapprehension of a kind that indicates that the drafters of the law may not have been fully familiar with the requirements of the MIGA Convention.\n\n153.\n\nThe Tribunal has noted this explanation, which may well explain why Mr. Corrales was satisfied with the approach taken in Article 22. Notwithstanding this explanation, however, the Tribunal is bound to take into account the existence of these bilateral investment treaties, which were available at the time of the drafting work carried out by Messrs Corrales and Capriles and which provided examples of language that provided consent for ICSID arbitration in clear terms. Mr. Corrales confirmed that Mr. Capriles was an expert in international economic law, including international investment law.143 As such, the Tribunal considers that he must be assumed to be familiar with the provisions of Venezuela\u2019s bilateral investment treaties - and in particular those provisions providing for consent.\n\nFirst Witness Statement of Mr. Corrales [11].\n\n154.\n\nMr. Corrales admitted that if he knew then what he knows now, the wording of Article would have been different:\n\n\"I think\u2014what I would say, I will repeat is, If I had knew what has happened to my county in the last six to seven years, I would have been clearer, but I was in 1999, sir.\"144\n\nHearing on jurisdiction Transcript Day 1, 250:20-251:1.\n\n155.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that the plain inconsistency between the agreement to ICSID arbitration in Venezuela\u2019s existing bilateral investment treaties, on the one hand, and the wording of Article 22, on the other, is significant. Even if the Tribunal accepts the evidence of Mr. Corrales that he intended Article 22 to provide for an express consent to ICSID arbitration for disputes arising under the Investment Law, the majority of the Tribunal recognises that there is a distinction to be drawn between the intention of Mr. Corrales (and possibly Mr. Capriles) and that of Venezuela. The material difference in the wording of Article 22 and of the bilateral investment treaties is a significant factor to be taken into account by the Tribunal in assessing the evidence as to the intention of Venezuela.\n\n156.\n\nFor its part, the Respondent argues that there has been a \"traditional hostility towards arbitration\" on the part of Venezuela and its legal community, that this is even more strongly held in relation to disputes involving the State, and that this is irreconcilable with the Claimant\u2019s interpretation of Article 22.145 The Respondent refers the Tribunal to a number of political statements which, in its view, demonstrate Venezuela\u2019s \"cautious and restrictive attitude\" towards arbitration.146 These statements include an official opinion issued by Venezuela\u2019s Attorney General in December 1999, in which the Attorney General concludes that \"the inclusion of an express clause by the Venezuelan State waiving the privilege of jurisdictional immunity in contracts of public debt is contrary to the Constitution of the Republic\".147\n\nRespondent\u2019s Memorial [24]-[25].\n\nRespondent\u2019s Memorial [26].\n\nExhibit EU-21, Opinion of Jes\u00fas Petit Da Costa, Attorney General, to Luis Ra\u00fal Matos Azocar, Finance Minister, dated 19 December 1996, p. 11 (English translation).\n\n157.\n\nThe Claimant, on the other hand, argues that there has been a \"pro-arbitration trend\" in the Venezuelan legal system.148 It says that Article 258 of the Venezuelan Constitution guarantees arbitration as a fundamental right and imposes a duty upon State organs to promote arbitration as a method of dispute resolution.149 The Claimant argues that the statements relied upon by the Respondent have been taken out of context and, when taken in their lull context, demonstrate an evolution on the part of Venezuela and its law in favour of arbitration.150\n\nClaimant\u2019s Counter-Memorial [141]-[154].\n\nClaimant\u2019s Counter-Memorial [142]-[143].\n\nClaimant\u2019s Counter-Memorial [145]-[149].\n\n158.\n\nThe Tribunal has carefully considered the evidence submitted by each party. It is apparent from this material that Venezuela has displayed reluctance towards international arbitration as a method of dispute resolution in the past. This much is clear from the statement of Prof. Morles, a Venezuelan jurist, at a seminar convened by the Academy of Political and Social Sciences in Caracas in 2005, relied on by both Parties. Prof. Morles\u2019 explains, however, that this attitude has evolved, and that the \"hostile culture towards arbitration in general [has] gradually given way to a new situation, internationally favoured by the equal treatment among nations and by the actions of international organizations such as UNCITRAL\".151 The Tribunal does not consider that the Respondent\u2019s arguments with respect to the Attorney General\u2019s comments can be dispositive in relation to Venezuela\u2019s attitude to international arbitration and the implications of that attitude for the interpretation of Article 22. The Tribunal notes too that the *Mobil* and *Cemex* tribunals considered that traditional hostility towards arbitration had receded in Venezuela during the 1990s, in favour of a more positive attitude. Those tribunals did find, however, that they could not draw from this general evolution a conclusion that Venezuela had intended by the terns of Article 22 to consent to ICSID arbitration, in the absence of a bilateral investment treaty.152\n\nExhibit EU-19, Alfredo Morles Hern\u00e1dez, *Presentation,* in Internal and International Commercial Arbitration: Theoretical Reflections and Practical Experiences (1. de Valera ed., Academia de Ciencias Politicas y Sociales 2005), p 12 (English translation).\n\n*Mobil* [131] and *Cemex* [126].\n\n159.\n\nThe Tribunal concludes that the evidence submitted by the Parties in relation to this evidence cannot be dispositive either way. The evidence does not point to a conclusion that President Ch\u00e1vez and the Council of Ministers would not have accepted Mr. Corrales\u2019 advice that the Investment Law should include a general and unilateral consent to ICSID arbitration. Equally, however, it does not assist the Claimant in establishing that Venezuela had an intention to consent to ICSID arbitration.\n\n*(ii) Evidence following the Enactment of the Investment Law*\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n160.\n\nThis material falls into 2 categories. The first is material emanating from the Respondent, and the second comprises speeches and addresses given by Mr. Corrales and others many years after the enactment of the Investment Law.\n\n161.\n\nSo far as the first category is concerned, material emanating from the Government of Venezuela, the relevance of this material is to establish *ex post facto* whether it is likely that the Respondent did intend by Article 22 to consent to ICSID jurisdiction. This material consists of what the Claimant alleges to be \"promotional material\"153 issued by Venezuela around the time the Investment Law was enacted, including:\n\n\u2022 a newsletter issued by the National Council of Promotion of Investments, which noted that the Investment Law provides for \"resort to international arbitration \"without Venezuela having to waive its sovereignty\"\";154\n\n\u2022 a statement by Cordiplan\u2019s General Director, Fernando Hern\u00e1ndez, international arbitration is maintained in the Investment Law as an option for foreign investors;155\n\n\u2022 publication of the Investment Law in the 2000 edition of Investment Laws of the World;156 and\n\n\u2022 a press release issued by the Venezuela\u2019s Embassy in the United States in 2001 titled \"Venezuela Best Country for International Arbitration\".157\n\nClaimant\u2019s Counter-Memorial [63].\n\nExhibit C-18, \"Investment Promotion Law Approved by Cabinet\", in CONARPI, Invest Venezuela TIPS No. 12 (20 September 1999) p 2.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Counter-Memorial [66].\n\nExhibit LAC-21, Publication of Decree-Law No. 356 of 3 October 1999 on Protection and Promotion of Investments in ICSID\u2019s Investment Laws of the World (March 2000) ICSID\u2019s Investment Laws of the World (March 2000).\n\nClaimant\u2019s Counter-Memorial [67].\n\n162.\n\nThe Tribunal does not consider this level of \"promotion\" of the Investment Law to be significant, and notes that nothing in this material refers expressly to Venezuela\u2019s consent to ICSID arbitration. This is consistent with the finding of the tribunal in *Brandes.158* The Tribunal is unable to conclude from the material submitted by the Claimant that Venezuela was publicising the Investment Law and seeking to attract foreign investors on the basis that the Law contained a general consent to ICSID arbitration.\n\n*Brandes* [100].\n\n163.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees with the Respondent\u2019s submissions to the effect that the absence of significant promotion by the Government of Venezuela of the Investment Law indicates that no great weight was put by the Government on the provisions of Article 22. The failure of such promotional material to publicize any general grant of consent to ICSID jurisdiction does not assist the Claimant\u2019s argument that there was an intention to consent to such ICSID jurisdiction.\n\n164.\n\nAs concerns the second category of material - subsequent speeches and statements by Mr. Corrales - the Tribunal believes that, given its view of Mr. Corrales\u2019 evidence referred to at paragraph 112 above and its acceptance of that evidence, the relevance of what was said at seminars ten years after the event is marginal. Material in relation to Mr. Corrales\u2019 silence prior to the speeches he gave and the context of his speeches, were presented by the Respondent to challenge Mr. Corrales\u2019 credibility. The Tribunal considers that whilst the passage of time may not have that effect, the fact that his views were only expressed long after the Investment law had been adopted, and only in the context of litigation, would tend to diminish its weight. While the *Mobil* and *Cemex* tribunals considered that this evidence was not supported by contemporaneous written documents, they also found it relevant that the Claimants in each case did not ask Mr. Corrales to appear as a witness.159 This is a significant point of difference in the present case, although the Tribunal notes that there is not a great deal of substantive difference between the statements Mr. Corrales made at the seminar - - which were before earlier tribunals - and those he has now expressed in these proceedings. The fact that his evidence has been tested is of course significant, but cannot be dispositive in circumstances in which the Tribunal has drawn a distinction between Mr. Corrales\u2019 intention and that of Venezuela.\n\n*Mobil* [137]-[138] and *Cemex* [131]-[135].\n\n**C. The Tribunal\u2019s Conclusions**\n---------------------------------\n\n165.\n\nIn paragraph 107 above, the Tribunal has concluded that it is not possible to conclude that the words of Article 22 of the Investment Law indicate an intent on the part of Venezuela to give its consent to ICSID arbitration for investment disputes that are governed by the Investment Law. The plain meaning of Article 22 is ambiguous. In view of this finding, the Tribunal has had regard to the evidence presented by the Parties in order to determine whether or not that evidence establishes, with sufficient clarity, that Venezuela intended to consent to ICSID arbitration when it enacted Article 22.\n\n166.\n\nThe Tribunal is satisfied on the evidence before it that Messrs Corrales and Capriles contributed to the preparation of the Investment Law. It is also satisfied that Article 22, as it appears in the Investment Law, appeared in the draft which they prepared and presented for consideration to the Economic Cabinet and the Council of Ministers of the State of Venezuela. On the evidence provided to the Tribunal, it concludes that the intention of Mr. Corrales was that Article 22 of the Investment Law should constitute a consent by the State of Venezuela to ICSID jurisdiction in respect of disputes brought by investors against Venezuela and which are subject to the Investment Law.\n\n167.\n\nThese conclusions are not, however, the end of the matter. There are two further key matters to be considered. The first is whether the relevant intention of the legislator has been established as a matter of fact and, if so, the second is whether that intention may be said to express consent on the part of Venezuela to ICSID arbitration in respect of disputes arising under the Investment Law.\n\n168.\n\nIn the Tribunal\u2019s view, a key element in the inquiry as to the intention of Venezuela in enacting Article 22 of the Investment Law, so far as consent to ICSID jurisdiction is concerned, is the intention of the legislator. For the purposes of determining consent, the Tribunal regards evidence of the intention of the Council of Ministers and of the Economic Cabinet as relevant to the intention of Venezuela.160 The intention of the drafters of the Investment Law, and in particular Article 22, is relevant in so far as they made known to the Economic Cabinet and the Council of Ministers the effect which they intended that Article 22 would have, namely to constitute the consent to ICSID jurisdiction required by Article 25 of the ICSID Convention.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the Respondent submits that the legislator was President Ch\u00e1vez (Hearing on Jurisdiction Transcript Day 3, 556:18-20), but accepts the submission of the Claimant that President Ch\u00e1vez acted through the Council of Ministers (Hearing on Jurisdiction Transcript Day 3, 596:5-20).\n\n169.\n\nCritical to the Tribunal\u2019s determination of whether such an intention was conveyed to and agreed upon by the Economic Cabinet and the Council of Ministers is the evidence of what occurred at the meetings of both bodies at which the Investment Law was considered and approved. As set out above, the Tribunal accepts the evidence of Mr. Corrales. The issue with which the Tribunal has had to grapple is whether that evidence satisfactorily establishes that the intention of Mr. Corrales (and also Mr. Capriles) for Article 22 to constitute a consent to ICSID jurisdiction was conveyed to the Economic Cabinet and the Council of Ministers, that it was accepted by these bodies, and then acted upon.\n\n170.\n\nThe Tribunal by majority does not consider that the direct evidence before it establishes with sufficient certainty that the intention of Messrs Corrales and Capriles for Article 22 to be a specific consent to ICSID jurisdiction under Article 25 of the ICSID Convention was conveyed to, and then accepted and acted upon, by either the Economic Cabinet or the Council of Ministers.\n\n171.\n\nIn the view of the majority of the Tribunal, given the uncertainty of the drafting adopted in Article 22 which discloses no plain meaning, and its clear difference from the consent to jurisdiction contained in the bilateral investment treaties already then entered into by Venezuela, the evidence must show that Article 22 reflected an intention on the part of the Economic Cabinet and the Council of Ministers to effect consent to ICSID jurisdiction.\n\n172.\n\nThe evidence before the Tribunal in relation to this critical question is addressed in the following paragraphs.\n\n173.\n\nIn paragraph 14 of the Witness Statement of Mr. Corrales he says:\n\n\"I particularly remember that in the review by the Economic Cabinet, we discussed the issue of international arbitration, and only one of the persons in the meeting opposed the proposal made by the drafters that the investment law should provide foreign investors with the right to pursue international arbitration as a means to resolve disputes with the Republic\".161\n\nSet out at [114] above.\n\n174.\n\nThis falls short of evidence that Article 22 was intended itself to be the consent to jurisdiction required by Article 25 of the ICSID Convention. It is merely a general reference to international arbitration.\n\n175.\n\nIn paragraph 20 of the Second Witness Statement of Mr. Corrales, he says:\n\n\"I also confirm that I understood that I was authorised to include such consent in the investment law in order to provide appropriate protection to foreign investors in Venezuela, with the intention to attract them and to maintain them in the country. Moreover, I confirm that both the Economic Cabinet and the Council of Ministers agreed with that intention which was made clear in the presentations I made to the two bodies and their discussion in which I participated\".162\n\nSet out at [115] above.\n\n176.\n\nAgain, this evidence falls short of establishing that the Economic Cabinet and the Council of Ministers was told that Article 22 of the Investment Law was intended to be the consent required by Article 25 of ICSID Convention.\n\n177.\n\nThe Tribunal has also carefully considered Mr. Corrales\u2019 oral testimony, in particular his answers to questions from the Tribunal about meetings he had with the Economic Cabinet and the Council of Ministers.163 Mr. Corrales\u2019 evidence was that there was no mention of ICSID arbitration at the meeting of the Economic Cabinet or at the meeting of the Council of Ministers. Mr. Corrales\u2019 evidence in response to further questions from the Tribunal, does not establish that any intention on the part of Mr. Corrales (or Mr Capriles) to the effect that Article 22 of the Investment Law established the consent required by Article 25 of the ICSID Convention, was conveyed to the meeting of the Economic Cabinet or the Council of Ministers.164 Nor does the evidence of Mr. Corrales indicate that a provision with the intended effect of establishing consent to ICSID jurisdiction (the importance of which Mr. Corrales was aware) was agreed to by those who were present at either meeting.\n\nHearing on Jurisdiction Transcript Day 1, 207:17- 208:10,,258:10-11.\n\nHearing on Jurisdiction Transcript Day 1,181:13-182:1.\n\n178.\n\nThe Tribunal considers by a majority that there is no direct evidence before it that establishes the intention of the legislator (in this instance, the Economic Cabinet and the Council of Ministers chaired by the President of Venezuela) to grant consent to ICSID jurisdiction by the terms of Article 22 of the Investment Law. In this regard, inferences that the Tribunal might be able to draw from the lack of evidence put forward by Venezuela, and the failure of Venezuela to produce documents requested by the Claimant, cannot be sufficient to establish the requisite intention. Other evidence referred to in this decision (including the oral testimony of Mr. Corrales, documents prepared by Mr. Corrales at the time of the preparation and enactment of the Investment Law (including Exhibits WCL-1 and WCL-3) and the Attorney General\u2019s submissions in *Ferm\u00edn Toro),* though not inconsistent with an intention of the Respondent to provide consent to ICSID jurisdiction, is nevertheless also incapable of establishing that intention.\n\n179.\n\nAccordingly, the Tribunal is not able to conclude on the evidence that Article 22 of the Investment Law was enacted by Venezuela with the intention of granting consent to ICSID jurisdiction, as required by Article 25 of the ICSID Convention. It follows that the Claimant is not able to establish that the Respondent has given its consent to ICSID arbitration in respect of its claims in the present case.\n\n**IV. COSTS**\n-------------\n\n180.\n\nEach party seeks an order for costs in its favour.165 The Tribunal does not, however, consider it is appropriate or necessary to make any order for costs that would require one party to make payment to the other. The Claimant advanced well-presented and reasonable arguments which were not ventilated in the previous three ICSID cases that considered Article 22 of the Investment Law. Further, the Claimant provided evidence not available to the tribunals in these previous ICSID cases. In these circumstances the Tribunal concludes that each party shall bear its own costs, and that the costs payable to ICSID shall be borne in equal shares by the Parties.\n\nRequest for Arbitration [92]; Respondent\u2019s Memorial [51]; Claimant\u2019s Counter-Memorial [205]; Claimant\u2019s Rejoinder [297]; Respondent\u2019s Reply Memorial [225]-[226]\n\n**V. DECISION**\n---------------\n\n181.\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, the Tribunal decides that:\n\n(a) The International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes has no jurisdiction under Article 22 of the Venezuelan Decree with rank and force of law No. 356 on the Protection and Promotion of Investments of 3 October 1999 to hear this matter and this Tribunal has no competence to decide the merits of the case.\n\n(b) The Parties shall bear on an equal basis the fees and expenses of the members of this Tribunal and or the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes.\n\n(c) Each party shall bear the fees and expenses incurred by it in relation to this proceeding."}]}
