The overall scope of my dissent**\n--------------------------------------\n\n1.\n\nI regret to dissent from the majority's decision entirely, the reason being that I uphold most of the preliminary objections submitted by the Respondent in the present case, except the second part of objection (b) because it has not been proved to my satisfaction that Claimants consciously committed a bad faith abuse of right by instituting the present proceeding through the filing with ICSID of the Request for Arbitration of 23 June 2008. Moreover, the relationship between NASAM and Claimants in the present case is not as stringent as the relationship between TFA and Claimants in the *Abaclat and others v. Argentine Republic* case.\n\n2.\n\nI part ways therefore with my co-arbitrators for a series of outstanding reasons which, in my opinion, prevent the present Tribunal - an ICSID international tribunal - from taking jurisdiction in the case. These reasons, grounded on public international law considerations and the submitted argument and evidence, may be summarized as follows:\n\n(1) The Argentine sovereign debt instruments at the basis of the Claimants' claims (\"security entitlements\" in Argentine sovereign bonds) do not constitute a \"protected investment\" under the ICSID Convention because the alleged \"investments\" were made without any intent to perform any economic activity in the host country or in connection with any particular project related to an activity of that kind in that country, as confirmed by the fact that none of the alleged \"investments\" were done \"in the territory of the Argentine Republic\" in the sense of Article 1(1) and (4) of the 1990 Argentina-Italy BIT;\n\n(2) Consequently, the Italian holders of the said \"security entitlements\" as defined in Article 1(2), of the Argentina-Italy BIT are not *prima facie* \"protected investors\" either because they are not physical or juridical persons of a Contracting Party who have made, are making or have assumed an obligation to make investments in the territory of the other Contracting Party, but in the circumstances of the case the objection does not possess an exclusively preliminary character.\n\n(3) The ICSID Convention and Arbitral Rules, as well the Argentina-Italy BIT, are silent about all kinds of collective proceedings (including \"multi-party arbitrations\") and, therefore, the Respondent cannot be deemed to have submitted itself to multi-party arbitration treatment unless it gave an *additional consent* to that particular type of procedure, consent which is missing in the present case;\n\n(4) In the light of the above conclusions - as well as the fact that under general international law the restructuring of its sovereign debt by a State (or the devaluation of its national currency) in situations of national emergency are not *prima facie* an internationally wrongful act - it is difficult to visualize how the Respondent might have committed a *prima facie* breach of the material provisions of the Argentina-Italy BIT;\n\n(5) As holders of the above \"security entitlements\" the Claimants have however contractual rights for the protection of which they are not without legal remedies to recover from the alleged wrongs because the entitlements in question relate to Argentine sovereign bonds which are held in Italy by the Italian Banks which sold the said entitlements to the Claimants and the bonds issued by Argentina: (i) advise purchasers of the risks involved in the acquisition of that financial product and (ii) provide that bonds are governed by a foreign law and submitted to the jurisdiction of foreign courts. It must also be added that the Claimants purchased their \"security entitlements\" from the Italian Banks in the retail market in Italy, not in Argentina, and that the question of the validity of the corresponding transactions are subject to the Italian law;\n\n(6) By not complying with the pre-arbitral requirements of Article 8 of the Argentina-Italy BIT (amicable consultations followed by prior submission to Argentina courts for a period of 18 months), Claimants disavow the jurisdictional agreement reached between Argentina and Italy in the BIT which on no account provides for direct access to international arbitration of foreign private investors nationals of the other Contracting Party and, consequently, ignore the scope of the Respondent's consent to arbitration defined by the arbitration offer set forth in the BIT. Claimants admit their non-compliance with those mandatory and sequential preconditions of the BIT alleging mainly \"futility\", as well as the MFN clause in Article 3 of the BIT. As explained below in this Opinion, I find these two justifications for noncompliance alleged by the Claimants without merit in the light of the applicable international law, the circumstances of the present case and argument and evidence submitted by the Parties;\n\n(7) Claimants chose, as admitted by the practice, to manifest their consents to ICSID arbitration through the filing with ICSID a Request for Arbitration on 23 June 2008, but the reality of the said consents has not being established because: (i) the filing of the Request was in point of time premature; (ii) the scope of the consent as expressed in the Request went beyond the Respondent's consent manifested in the \"arbitration offer\" contained in the Argentina-Italy BIT; and (iii) the Request is vitiated by incongruity and authenticity defaults which cannot but have also a negative bearing in the determination of validity, formal and essential, of Claimants' consent as manifested in the said Request for Arbitration.\n\n3.\n\nWith respect for my co-arbitrators, I regret to say that I cannot concur in the Majority Decision and enter this Dissenting Opinion. The Decision of the majority taking as a whole does not live up to the above listed items of mine because of an excessive zeal in the protection of the interests of alleged foreign investors (noticeable also in several other investor-host State arbitral decisions). This policy approach does not fit well into the realities of international public law system and disregards the rules governing the interpretation of treaties that, curiously enough, are at the same time affirmed as the rules which should be applied by investor-host State arbitral tribunals to decide jurisdictional issues under the BIT system.\n\n4.\n\nThe following passage of the recent Award in *Daimler Financial Services v. Argentine Republic* of 22 August 2012 describes quite accurately my position on the point above:\n\n\"The general purpose of BITs is of course to protect and promote foreign investments; *but it is to do so within the framework acceptable to both of the State parties.* These two aspects must always be held in tension. They are the *yin* and *yang* of bilateral investment treaties and cannot be separated without doing violence to the will of the states that conclude such treaties. It is in this context that the exact wording of dispute resolution clauses plays a key role, as such clauses are one of the privileged places where the imbalances between the interests of both parties are often precisely defined as a result of the treaty's negotiation process\" (*italics in first and second lines supplied*).1\n\n*Daimler Financial Services AG v. Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/05/1), Award of 22 August 2012 (\"*Daimler*\" or \"*Daimler v. Argentina*\"), para. 161.\n\n5.\n\nBITs are not ordinary contracts but reciprocal bilateral treaties governed by public international law and negotiated between two sovereign States, the very essence of which \"is precisely to protect the respective sovereign policy decisions of the States parties by means of the formality inherent in the legal nature of such instruments\".2 It should not be forgotten either that when an investor makes a treaty claim pursuant to a given BIT, the arbitral tribunal concerned is called \"to adjudicate whether a sovereign state has actually respect or violate the international obligations it accepted with regard to the investments made by nationals of the other sovereign state party to the same treaty\".3\n\n*Ibid*, para. 162.\n\n*Ibid*, para. 163.\n\n6.\n\nThe wording of the BITs reflects the \"balance of interests\" achieved through negotiations by both sovereign States Parties thereto. This should be born in mind by the interpreters of BITs when interpreting its provisions, including in particular its dispute resolution clauses. It is indeed by interpreting those clauses that the interpreter is supposed to ascertain the existence and intended scope of the consent of the States Parties to the BIT to submit investment disputes with investor nationals of the other Contracting Party to a given form or forms of international arbitration.\n\n7.\n\nIt follows that when interpreting BIT-based dispute resolution provisions the only \"balance of interests\" which counts is the one achieved by the two Contracting Parties in the text of these provisions or necessarily implied thereby. It would not make sense to disregard that \"balance of interest\" and invoke in its place a \"balance of interest\" between the parties to dispute because one of the latter parties, namely the private foreign investor, is a third vis-\u00e0-vis the BIT. For a different conclusion which I do not share, see the *Abaclat* majority decision of 4 August 2011.4\n\n*Abaclat and others v. Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/07/5), Decision on Jurisdiction and Admissibility of 4 August 2011 (\"*Abaclat*\" or \"*Abaclat* majority decision\"), paras. 579-91.\n\n8.\n\nI agree indeed with the statements in the *Telenor Mobile Telecommunications v. Hungary* Award of 13 September 2006 that reject other tribunals' reliance on abstract policy considerations in favour of greater investor protection, or on the importance of international arbitration to investor protection, because what has to be ascertained is the intention of the Contracting Parties such as recorded in the wording of the BIT at issue:\n\n\"The importance to investors of independent international arbitration cannot be denied, but in view of this Tribunal its task is to interpret the BIT and for that purpose to apply ordinary canons of interpretation, not to displace, by reference to general policy considerations concerning investor protection, the dispute resolution mechanism specifically negotiated by the parties\".5\n\n*Telenor Mobile Communications AS v. Republic of Hungary* (ICSID Case No. ARB/04/15), Award of 13 September 2006 (\"*Telenor*\"), para. 95.\n\n9.\n\nPractice shows the risks of ignoring the limits within which host States' consent to the sequence and peaceful settlement means given in the BIT-based dispute resolution provisions. Such ignorance may become indeed a cause for instituting annulment procedures before an *ad hoc* ICSID Committee or competent domestic courts of a given State.6 In any case, the interpretation of the BIT is not in public international law a legal operation allowing interpreters to inject therein elements alien either to the BIT object of the interpretation (or to international law rules governing treaty's interpretation), while disregarding the plain text of the provisions of the BIT subject to the interpretation.\n\n*See*, for example the recent judgments of (i) the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in the proceedings to set aside the Final Award of 24 December 2007 in the *BG Group PLC v. Republic of Argentina* case (UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules) *,* where the Court rejected the Tribunal's decision to excuse the Claimant's noncompliance with the 18- month litigation prerequisite on the basis that the requirement would \"produce\" \"an absurd and unreasonable result\" in the circumstances (*Republic of Argentina v. BG Group PLC,* No. 11-7021 (U.S. App. D.C. January 17, 2012); and (ii) the Stockholm District Court's Default Judgment, declaring with respect to the 2007 decision of the arbitral tribunal in the *RosInvestCo UK Ltd. v. The Russian Federation* case (\"*RosInvestCo*\"), that the arbitrators did not have competence to determine whether the measures adopted by the Russian Federation concerning *RosInvestCo* were expropriation measures and directing *RosInvestCo* to reimburse to the Russian Federation the arbitration costs with interests (Default Judgment of 9 November 2011, Case No. T24891-07). Thus, the finding of the *RosInvestCo* arbitral tribunal to the effect that under Article 3(2) of the UK-Soviet BIT (the MFN clause) the investor's \"protection\" included the submission to arbitration in case of interference by the host State with his \"use\" and \"enjoyment\" of the investment was therefore voided by the Stockholm District Court.\n\n10.\n\nIt should also be noted that the question of non-compliance with the preconditions to international arbitration in a BIT-based dispute resolution provision sets up - in public international law - an issue concerning \"jurisdiction\", not \"admissibility\". The jurisprudence of the International Court of Justice (\"ICJ\") and the generality of arbitral decisions and awards on investment disputes confirm that assertion. However, the recent *Abaclat* majority decision deals with such kind of claimants' non-compliance as if they would constitute an eventual cause of \"admissibility\" of the claim.7 This is however one of the few points in which the present Majority Decision departs from *Abaclat* ; an unusual fact deserving to be noted in this Introduction.\n\nFor example, in connection with the non-compliance by the claimants with the pre-condition to international arbitration of Article 8(2) of the Argentina-Italy BIT (*Abaclat* majority decision, *supra* note 4, para. 496).\n\n11.\n\nThe distinction does not operate at the international law level as in domestic contexts as rightly and clearly explained in the following passages the *Daimler* Award:\n\n\"[...] admissibility analyses patterned on domestic court practices have no relevance for BIT- based jurisdictional decisions in the context of investor-State disputes. In domestic context, admissibility requirements are judicially constructed rules designed to preserve the efficiency and integrity of court proceedings. They do not expand the jurisdiction of domestic courts. Rather, they serve to streamline courts dockets by striking out matters which, *though within the jurisdiction of the courts,* are for one reason or another not appropriate for adjudication at the particular time on in the particular manner in question\"8 (*emphasis added*).\n\n*Daimler*, *supra* note 1, para.192.\n\n12.\n\nThe tasks of the interpreters of BITs is certainly not to render symmetric what, under the BIT system, is by definition asymmetric, namely the formation of the contractual relationship established between the private foreign investor and the host State when the former accepts the \"arbitration offer\" made in the BIT by the latter. The private foreign investor has indeed the right by virtue of the BIT to accept or reject that offer *but not the right to alter or modified the terms of the offer which are and remain those defined in the BIT by the States Parties thereto.* In the words of the *Wintershall v. Argentine Republic* Award of 8 December 2008:\n\n\"That an investor could choose at will to omit the second step (the 18-month domestic court requirement) is simply not provided for nor even envisaged by the Argentina-German BIT -because (Argentina's) the Host State's 'consent' (standing offer) is premised on there being first submitted to the courts of competent jurisdiction in the Host State the entire dispute for resolution in the local courts.\"9\n\n*Wintershall Aktiengesellschaft v. Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/04/14), Award of 8 December 2008 (\"*Wintershall*\"), para. 160(2).\n\n13.\n\nWhat is at stake here is *pacta sunt servanda*, namely the rule from which flows directly the requirement of the interpretation in good faith set forth in Article 31 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties.10 In a passage frequently quoted by other arbitral tribunals, the 2009 award in the case of *Quasar de Valors v. Russian Federation* observed in that respect that:\n\n\"To choose one of the contending policy theses as the reason to read a BIT in a particular way may be presumptuous. The stakes are high and the policy decisions appertain to the State-parties to the treaties. Speculations relied upon as the basis of purposive readings of a text run the risk of encroachment upon fundamental policy determinations. The same is true when 'confirmation' of a hypothetical intention is said to be found in considerations external to the text. The duty of the Tribunal is to discover and not to create meaning \"11*(emphasis* *supplied*).\n\nInternational Law Commission (\"ILC\") Commentary on Article 27 of the Draft Articles on the Law of Treaties, *Yearbook of the International Law Commission,* 1966, vol. II, p. 221.\n\n*Quasar de Valors SICAV S.A. et al. (Formerly Renta 4 S.V.S.A et al.) v. Russian Federation*, SCC Case No. 24/2007, Award on Preliminary Objections, 20 March 2009 (\"*Quasar de Valors*\"), para. 93.\n\n14.\n\nFurthermore, to do otherwise would be self-defeating for the aim pursued by the private foreign investor because it would mean that, as happened in the present instance, the undertaking to arbitrate (*convenci\u00f3n de arbitraje*) between the private foreign investor and the host State cannot be considered as having been executed.\n\n15.\n\nThe Award on jurisdiction of 10 February 2012 in *ICS Inspection and Control Services v. the Argentine Republic* explained that legal conclusion in the following crystal clear terms:\n\n\"At the time of commencing dispute resolution under the treaty, the investor can only accept or decline the offer to arbitrate, but cannot vary its terms. The investor, regardless of the particular circumstances affecting the investor or its belief in the utility or fairness of the conditions attached to the offer of the host State, must nonetheless contemporaneously consent to the application of the terms and conditions of the offer made by the host State, or else not agreement to arbitrate may be formed. As opposed to a dispute resolution provision in a concession contract between investor and the host State where subsequent events or circumstances arising may be taken into account to determine the effect to be given to earlier negotiated terms, the investment treaty presents a 'take it or leave it' situation at the time the dispute and the investor's circumstances are already known. This point is equally poignant in the context of jurisdiction grounded on an MFN clause [....]\"12\n\n*ICS Inspection and Control Services Limited (United Kingdom) v. The Republic of Argentina* (PCA-UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules), Award on Jurisdiction of 10 February 2012 (\"*ICS Inspection and Control Services*\"), para. 272.\n\n16.\n\nLikewise, it is worthwhile to note that in the present case the cause of action invoked by the Claimants are alleged breaches by the Respondent of some obligations assumed by it by virtue of the Argentina-Italy BIT and by public international law as well. In this case, Claimants are not invoking wrongs concerning both \"BIT and international law rights\" and \"contractual rights\", but only the former. It is therefore only with respect to the Claimants alleged \"BIT and international law rights\" that the jurisdiction and admissibility issues in the present phase of the case must be determined by the Tribunal.\n\n17.\n\nFurthermore, the task of the Tribunal in the present phase is in fact circumscribed to the determination of jurisdiction and admissibility issues pursuant to the ICSID Convention and the Argentina-Italy BIT. Claimants did not plead jurisdiction and admissibility with respect to Respondent's alleged violations of general international law. Moreover, the elements of fact invoked by them in the Request for Arbitration instituting the case- essentially the 2005 Exchange Public Offer (\"EPO\") and the legislation which follows the Republic Argentina's declaration of default of 24 December 2001 cannot be described as being *prima facie* constitutive of an international wrongful act, without prejudice that it might be so under the Argentina-Italy BIT, question to be decided at the merits phase of the present case. As has been stated by the *Saluka v. Czech Republic* Tribunal:\n\n\"It is now established in international law that states are not liable to pay compensation to a foreign investor when in the normal exercise of their regulatory powers they adopt in a non-discriminatory manner *bona fide* regulations that are aimed at the general welfare\".13\n\n*Saluka Investments BV (The Netherlands) v. The Czech Republic,* (PCA-UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules), Partial Award of 17 March 2006, para. 254. The award of 26 July 2001 in the *Eudoro A. Olgu\u00edn v. Republic of Paraguay* (ICSID Case No. ARB/98/5), mentioned by the Parties in the present proceedings, rejected a claim that loss of an investment arising from a bankruptcy involved conduct tantamount to an expropriation of the investment by the State because it would imply \"a departure from the general principles of law and the rules of substantive law that define and regulate expropriation\" (*see* paras. 83-4).\n\n18.\n\nThe further question of whether the facts invoked by the Claimants in the Request may constitute *prima facie* a violation of the Argentina-Italy BIT is, in my opinion, to be decided at the merits phase because the Respondent's objection at the present phase that there is not *prima facie* such a violation does not possess, in the circumstances of the present case, an exclusively preliminary character. Matters being so, the right procedural solution is to join that objection to the merits as provided for in Rule 41(4) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules. It follows that I reject as unjustified and premature the conclusions on the matter contained in paragraphs 536-37 of the Majority Decision.\n\n19.\n\nFinally, it seems necessary to recall again that, as stated so many times at so many places, that the international arbitration procedures applicable to private foreign investors-host States disputes are not all-embracing compulsory procedures as may be found in domestic legal systems. The ICSID arbitral tribunals established, *as the present Tribunal,* to deal with a given investment dispute are international tribunals of *limited jurisdiction,* the latter being defined by international conventional instruments concluding between States as primary subjects of international law (the ICSID Convention and the corresponding BIT in the instant case).\n\n20.\n\nIt follows that it is quite contradictory to affirm, on one hand, that \"questions of jurisdiction do not follow Article 42 but Article 25 of the ICSID Convention and are *exclusively* governed by international law\"14 (*emphasis supplied*) and, on the other hand, to commit an oversight, or to give a cursory consideration, in reasoning and conclusions to basic principles and rules of public international law, including some which are systemic in nature. This is basically the *raison d'\u00eatre* of my dissent with the Majority Decision of the Tribunal in the present phase of the case.\n\nMajority Decision, para. 132. As to the \"exclusiveness\" argument a frequently made assertion in doctrine and case law, it must be recalled that under Article 25(2) of the ICSID Convention the jurisdiction *ratione personae* of the private investors is defined by reference to the national law of their respective State.\n\n**2. The relief sought by the Claimants and the basis of jurisdiction invoked**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n21.\n\nOn the basis of the facts alleged in a Request for Arbitration dated 23 June 2008 and filed on that date with ICSID, the Claimants alleged to be individual and entities of Italian nationality and holders of debt instruments issued by the Argentine Republic (\"security entitlements\" in different series of Argentine sovereign bonds purchased to the Italian Banks in possession of the bonds). They were amongst the minority holders who refused a Public Offer of Exchange (\"POE\") made in 2005 by the Argentine Government and did not tender then their entitlements in the bonds for exchanges with the new bonds.15\n\nRequest for Arbitration, para. 31.\n\n22.\n\nThe Claimants affirm that the Respondent has violated its obligations under the Argentina-Italy BIT and under international law - in particular the duty to accord fair and equitable treatment and to refrain from expropriating their property and, through the MFN clause of the said BIT, the full protection and security treatment - by the measures adopted by the Legislative and Executive branches of Government of the Argentine Republic in the aftermath of the Argentine economic and financial crisis, leading to the declaration of the moratorium of foreign debt of 24 December 2001.16 Thus, the object of the dispute relates to actions whereby the Argentine Republic would allegedly deprive the Claimants of \"all their rights with respect to the bonds held by them.\"17\n\n*Ibid*, paras. 13-38.\n\n*Ibid*, para. 12.\n\n23.\n\nAmong those actions, the Request for Arbitration singled out: (i) the adoption of the Public Emergency and Foreign Exchange System Reform Law No. 25,561 (the \"Emergency Law\") of 6 January 2002 which abrogated a previous 1991 Convertibility Law abolishing thereby the one-to-one peg of the Argentine peso to the US dollar; (ii) the enactment of the Presidential Decree No. 214 of 3 February 2002 providing for a currency conversion scheme under which all obligations payable in US dollars existing on the date of the enactment of the Emergency Law were converted into pesos at the fixed one-to-one exchange rate (the so-called \"pesificacion\"); (iii) the Public Offer of Exchange (the \"POE\") of 14 January 2005 of the Argentine Government aiming at restructuring the foreign debt by the exchange of all outstanding public debt instruments, including the bonds, with new financial instruments which provide for a huge reduction of the net present value of the outstanding instruments,18 offer stating to expire on 25 February 2005; and (iv) the adoption of the Law No. 26,017 of 9 February 2005 forbidding the Government from presenting any further offers with respect to the bonds not exchanged under the POE (Article 2) and laying down a prohibition to make judicial, extra judicial or private settlements with respect to those bonds (Article 3). The Request for Arbitration also alleged that by virtue of Article 6 of the Law No. 26,017: \"Argentina effectively precluded the 'non-complying' bondholders from bringing any action before its domestic courts.\"19\n\nEstimated by Claimants at approximately 70-75% of that value (*Ibid,* para. 27).\n\n*Ibid*, para. 29.\n\n24.\n\nThe Request for Arbitration provides a list of 119 initial Claimants who, as indicated in the Majority Decision, \"were grouped in 68 segments [\u2026], testifying to the fact that a number of individual Claimants are co-owners of the same entitlements\".20 Subsequently, a number of the original Claimants accepted a new Exchange Offer made in 2010 by Argentina. Following the application of ICSID Arbitration Rule 44, the Tribunal took note that the proceedings were discontinued for 29 original Claimants. Given that fact, a quarter of the initial 119 Claimants have left the case, therefore leaving 90 Claimants in the case.21\n\nMajority Decision, para. 334.\n\n*Ibid*, paras. 336-47.\n\n25.\n\nIn the Request for Arbitration, the Claimants formulate the relief sought as follows:\n\n\"90. The Claimants seek an Arbitral Award:\n\n- declaring that the Respondent has breached its international obligations under the BIT and international law by failing to ensure fair and equitable treatment and full protection and security to their investments and by expropriating such investments without prompt, adequate and immediate compensation;\n\n- ordering the Respondent to refund to each Claimant the entire nominal value of the bonds held by it, plus accrued interest until maturity, plus compounded interest from the date of expiry to the date of the Request for Arbitration, plus all other damages that shall be demonstrated to be a direct consequence of the Respondent's international law violations.\n\n- ordering the Respondent to pay compounded interest on the total amount indicated above from the date of the present Request for Arbitration until the date of actual payment.\n\nThe exact amounts will be determined more precisely during the proceedings.\n\n91. Finally, the Claimants request that the Respondent be ordered to reimburse them for all costs incurred and to be incurred by them in connection with the present arbitration, including legal fees, plus compounded interest at the normal commercial rate applicable from the payment of each bond until the date of effective reimbursement\n\n92. The Claimants reserve the right to refine and expand the foregoing prayers for relief in the course of the proceedings.\"\n\n26.\n\nRegarding jurisdiction of ICSID and the competence of this Arbitral Tribunal the Claimants' Request for Arbitration begins stating that this is a Request made pursuant to (i) Article 36 of the Washington ICSID Convention of 18 March 1965 and (ii) Article 8, para. 5(a) of the Argentina- Italy BIT signed on 22 May 1990 and in force from 14 October 1993 and that it is submitted in accordance with the ICSID Institution Rules.22 But the central question of *whether both parties* *to the dispute have consented in writing to refer it to the ICSID jurisdiction for arbitration* is dealt with much later, namely in section XII of chapter III of the Request.23\n\nThe official versions of the 1990 Argentina-Italy BIT are in Spanish and Italian languages. There is not authenticated English version of the BIT. This fact was a source of considerable confusion at the beginning of the present proceedings because in certain English translations circulated to the Tribunal the Spanish term \"*obligaciones*\" and the Italian term \"obbligazioni\" in Article 1(1)(c) of the Argentina-Italy BIT were rendered in those translations by the term *\"bonds\"*. None of the provisions of the Argentina-Italy BIT uses a term corresponding to the English *\"bonds\"*, term that in Spanish, at the least, is rendered by *\"bonos\"* and currently used. Likewise, the English expression \"security entitlements\" used by the Parties is alien to the Spanish and Italian terminology of the BIT.\n\nRequest for Arbitration, paras. 81-9.\n\n27.\n\nOn the above matter, the Request for Arbitration states the following: (i) that Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention does not require a specific form for the manifestation of the parties' written consent to refer disputes to ICSID, but merely that the consent be given *prior to the filing of the Request for Arbitration;* (ii) that it is commonly admitted a Contracting State's consent to submit a dispute or category of disputes to ICSID arbitration may result from a *unilateral undertaking or a public offer of that State* to submit such disputes to ICSID, as expressed in national law or in an international treaty on the protection of foreign investments; (iii) that in the present case, *Argentina's offer to Italian investors* to refer investment disputes to ICSID is expressed in Article 8 of the BIT; (iv) that is commonly admitted that the *investors' acceptance of the host Sate's offer can be manifested, inter alia,* by filing a request for arbitration to ICSID; (v) that for that purposes, the Claimants *hereby accept* to submit the dispute to ICSID arbitration *by signing and filing this Request for Arbitration* ; and (vi) that pursuant to Article 2(3) of the ICSID Institution Rules *the date of consent* is considered to be the date on which the second party (i.e. the investor) acted that in the present case is the date of the submission of the Request for Arbitration, namely *23 June 2008*.24\n\n*Ibid*, paras. 81-5.\n\n28.\n\nHowever, Claimants did not accept Argentina's arbitration offer as formulated in Article 8 of the Argentina-Italy BIT with its conditions and sequence (but something else) because as stated in the Request for Arbitration itself Claimants self-judged that *\"the conditions set out in Article 8 of the BIT are clearly inapplicable in the present case\"*25 and acted and pleaded accordingly. The alteration of the terms of the offer agreed upon by Argentina and Italy in Article 8, paragraphs 1 to 5(a), of their BIT by the Claimants is obvious. The Request for Arbitration tries to justify it by the following considerations:\n\n\"87. As to the requirement of an attempt at amicable settlement (Article 8(1)), it is apparent from the description of the facts that Argentina has always displayed a hostile and uncooperative attitude towards the Claimants. The possibility of reaching an amicable settlement was also precluded by Law No. 26017 (Exhibit C-4), which prohibited all Governments bodies from taking any kind of action (judicial, extrajudicial or private) with the Claimants. Argentina's behaviour in the present case is similar to the ones held by it since the beginning of 2001, for which Argentina has already been held liable for breaches of international law in the numerous other cases brought against it.\n\n88. As to the condition that the parties must first attempt to settle the dispute before domestic courts of the host State for a period of 18 months prior to resorting to international arbitration (Article 8(2)) the consistent jurisprudence of international arbitral tribunals demonstrates that this provision does not constitute an obstacle to the offer of arbitration contained in the BIT. Furthermore, as noted (par. 29), in the present case the Claimants were effectively inhibited from challenging Argentina's preposterous POE in light of Article 6 of Law No. 26,017.\n\n89. Finally, resort to local courts would have been an entirely futile exercise, since it is clearly impossible for the local courts to decide a case of such magnitude in only 18 months.\"26\n\n*Ibid*, para. 86.\n\nConcerning the alleged \"numerous cases for which Argentina would have already been liable\" (para. 87 of the request for arbitration), the Claimants refer back to the *T\u00e9cnicas Medioambientales Tecmed, S.A. v.

Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/01/3), Award of 22 May 2007 (\"*Enron Creditors Recovery*\"). With respect to the alleged \"consistent jurisprudence of international arbitral tribunals\" (para. 88 of the Request), Claimants mention: the *Siemens A.G. v. Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/02/8), Decision of 3 August 2004 (\"*Siemens*\"); the *Camuzzi International S.A. v.

Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/03/19), Decision on Jurisdiction of 3 August 2006.\n\n29.\n\nIt follows from the above that the first issue to be determined concerning Claimants' consent to the arbitration is whether or not on the critical date, namely on 23 June 2008, the scope of the consent manifested by them by the act of filing their Request for Arbitration was *ad idem* with the consent of Argentina manifested in the arbitration offer to Italian investors embodied in Article 8 of the Argentina-Italy BIT.\n\n**3. The preliminary objections submitted by the Respondent**\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n30.\n\nIn international litigation questions of jurisdiction and competence deserve special attention because they carry with - by operation of public international law - the need to ascertain the existence and scope of the consent of the State or States involved to submit to the peaceful settlement means or procedure concerned. As stated years ago by the Award in the *Mihaly* *International Corporation v. Sri Lanka* case:\n\n\"As a preliminary matter, the question of the existence of jurisdiction based on consent must be examined *propio motu*, i.e. without objection being raised by the Party. *A fortiori,* since the Respondent has raised preliminary objections to the jurisdiction, the existence of consent to the jurisdiction must be closely examined.\n\nIn the case under review, the fact of the registration of this case [\u2026] is naturally without prejudice to the further examination of the arguments of evidence presented by the Parties on issues of jurisdiction. The Tribunal is competent to determine the limits of its own competence.\"27\n\n*Mihaly International Corporation v. Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka* (ICSID Case No. ARB/00/2), Award of 15 March 2002 (\"*Mihaly*\"), paras. 56-7.\n\n31.\n\nIn the first session of the Tribunal on 24 February 2009, Claimants and Respondent agreed that there should first be a preliminary phase in the proceedings covering jurisdiction and admissibility. The preliminary phase would deal with preliminary objections of a general character only, but not with jurisdictional issues that may arise in relation to individual claimants, which would be dealt at a later stage as necessary and appropriate. In the event of disagreement as to whether a given objection is of a \"general character only\" the matter will be decided by the Tribunal.28\n\nMajority Decision, paras. 3 and 5.\n\n32.\n\nIn execution of the agreement above, the Respondent filed with ICSID on 11 June 2009 a Memorial on Jurisdiction and Admissibility making submissions by way of *preliminary*  *objections*.29 These preliminary objections were maintained in the Respondent's Reply of 12 March 201030 as well as in its Post Hearing Brief of 28 March 2011. However, the wording of the preliminary objections as appeared in the Memorial got some drafting corrections in the subsequent written pleadings as indicated with accuracy in paragraph 65 of the Majority Decision. The text of the preliminary objections quoted below is one reproduced in the last relevant document, namely of the Respondent's Post Hearing Brief:\n\n\"[\u2026] the Argentine Republic reiterates the request made in its Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction and Admissibility, its Reply on Jurisdiction and Admissibility and in its closing statement given at the Hearing on Jurisdiction and Admissibility to the effect that the Tribunal issue an award:\n\n(a) Determining that it lacks competence and that the ICSID lacks jurisdiction to entertain collective actions of this nature;\n\n(b) In the alternative, determining that it lacks competence and the ICSID lacks jurisdiction because neither the Argentine Republic nor Claimants gave valid consent to these proceedings, and, further, that Claimants' abuse of right in bringing these proceedings - in the name of a third party - renders any consent they may have given null and void;\n\n(c) In the alternative, determining that there is no *prima facie* violation of the Argentina-Italy BIT;\n\n(d) In the alternative, determining that it lacks jurisdiction *ratione materiae* ;\n\n(e) In the alternative, determining that it lacks jurisdiction *ratione personae* or that Claimants lack legal standing to institute these proceedings;\n\n(f) In the alternative, determining that Claimants have not satisfied the necessary prerequisites to bringing a claim under the Argentina-Italy BIT;\n\n(g) Ordering Claimants to pay all costs, expenses and attorneys' fees incurred by the Argentine Republic (plus interest); and\n\n(h) Granting any further relief against Claimants as may have been requested by the Argentine Republic and deemed to be fit by the Tribunal\".31\n\nRespondent's Memorial, para. 299.\n\nRespondent's Reply, para. 498.\n\nRespondent's Post Hearing Brief, para. 185.\n\n33.\n\nLikewise, it should be recalled that, at the beginning of the third day of the Hearing, the Respondent made a motion to the effect that the Tribunal resolves, at the proper procedural time, a request presented by the Argentine Republic regarding \"the lack of legal representation in these proceedings by the Claimant Parties\".32 Upon request by one member of the Tribunal, the Respondent explained that the Prayer of Relief presented by it at the end of the Hearing was identical with that presented in its previous written submission (the Reply at that time), \"complemented by the procedural issue that was raised at the beginning of the third day of the Hearing\".33 The material aspects of this so-called procedural issue are dealt within point II of the Majority Decision (under the heading \"Consent of the Claimants\") and in Chapter IV of the present Opinion.\n\n*See* Transcript, p. 443/3.\n\n*See* Transcript, p. 13 and Majority Decision, footnote to para. 67.\n\n34.\n\nThe Claimants in their Counter-Memorial request that the Tribunal \"dismiss all the Respondent's objections and decided that it has jurisdiction\"34 and in their Rejoinder that the Tribunal \"dismiss all the Respondent's objections and decided that it has jurisdiction and that the present proceedings are admissible\".35 In their Post Hearing Brief, Claimants' reiterated their Prayers of Relief and requested that the Tribunal \"declare that it has jurisdiction over the present case rejecting all Respondent's objections to jurisdiction and admissibility\".36 Furthermore, in their Rejoinder and Post Hearing Brief the Claimants request that the Respondent be ordered to reimburse the Claimants for the legal fees and the costs of the arbitration.\n\nClaimants' Counter-Memorial, para. 426.\n\nClaimants' Rejoinder, para. 218.\n\nClaimants' Post Hearing Brief, para. 183.\n\n**4. The general economy of the present Opinion**\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n35.\n\nAs stated at the beginning of this Introduction, I dissent from the present Majority Decision entirely. In the light of this, I consider necessary to explain my dissent in this Opinion with some detail on the main items on which my legal conviction differs from the Decision on Jurisdiction and Admissibility of my co-arbitrators.\n\n36.\n\nIn addition to the Introduction, the present Opinion has four Chapters and an overall general conclusion. Chapter I explains my position on a preliminary issue raised by the Majority Decision under the heading \"Relationship of the present Decision to the *Abaclat* case\". Chapter II contains comments and considerations on some hinged conclusions and omissions of the Majority Decision relating to: (i) the distinction between \"multi-party proceedings\" and \"representative proceedings\" and their respective different legal effects from the standpoint of the consent to arbitration rule (chapter I of the Majority Decision); (ii) the mechanism of formation and execution of the Parties' agreement to arbitrate the present dispute (a non-issue in the Majority Decision); and (iii) the question of the definition of protected investors (jurisdiction *ratione personae)* (chapters II and III of the Majority Decision). Chapter III deals with the central question of the definition of protected investments (jurisdiction *ratione materiae)* under both the ICSID Convention and the Argentina-Italy BIT (chapter IV of the Majority Decision). Lastly, Chapter IV of the Opinion is devoted to consider a series of questions arising in connection with the determination of the existence and scope of the consent to arbitrate the present dispute of both the Respondent State and the Claimants (chapter VI of the Majority Decision). My position on the question of the existence of *prima facie* treaty claims is explained in the Introduction to the Opinion (paras. 16-18).\n\n37.\n\nThe Opinion ends with an overall general conclusion, entitled \"Concluding Findings\" summarizing the main conclusions on the basis of which I find the present case to fall outside the jurisdiction of the Centre and, for the matter, of the competence of this Tribunal to decide the dispute submitted to it by the Claimants.\n\n**Chapter I - A preliminary issue raised by the Majority Decision: the so-called \"special relationship\" of the present case with the** ***Abaclat*** **case**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**1. Reaffirmation of the autonomy of the present case as a main case**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n38.\n\nUnder the heading of \"Relationship of the present Decision to the *Abaclat* case\", the Majority in the present case tries to explain somewhat the far reaching and excessive *determinative* effects attributed as a whole to the *Abaclat* majority decision in the adjudication of the Respondent's preliminary objections in the present case. The *Ambiente Ufficio and Others* (formerly *Giordano Alpi and Others*) case (this case) relates to (i) a dispute between different Parties than the *Abaclat* case; (ii) does not involve mass claims processes (namely large-scale litigation) as the *Abaclat* case does; (iii) the factual and legal context is not the same or identical to *Abaclat* ; (iv) the Claimants' representation is not organized as in *Abaclat* ; and (v) the present Tribunal has been established as an ICSID arbitral tribunal equal in rang, independent and with a different composition that the *Abaclat* or any other ICSID arbitral tribunal.37\n\nThe *Abaclat* majority decision, *supra* note 4, was referred to the present Tribunal by Claimants after their PostHearing-Brief, and the dissenting opinion of Professor Abi-Saab in the *Abaclat* case (hereinafter \"Professor Abi-Saab's dissenting opinion in *Abaclat*\"), as well as the award in the case *ICS Inspection and Control Services* case, *supra* note 12, by the Respondent also after its Post-Hearing-Brief. The referral of those three case-law pieces was admitted by the Tribunal. Thus, from the standpoint of the procedure these documents are part and parcel of the whole of the case-law and legal authorities submitted by Parties in the case. Not less, but not more either and, in particular, not exclusively, because the Parties submitted before quite a number of case-law and other legal authorities which are as relevant for the adjudication by the tribunal of the Respondent's preliminary objections as those referred by the Parties after their Post-Hearing-Briefs. Furthermore, the Respondent submitted written and oral experts' reports and views having a bearing on jurisdiction and inadmissibility aspect with respect in particular to the concepts of \"protected\" investment and investors.\n\n39.\n\nThe ICSID arbitration system does not allow the Centre or any one of its arbitral tribunals, to direct that proceedings in two or more cases be joined and, in fact, no such kind of direction occurred with respect to the *Ambiente Ufficio and Others* case. The present case has not been formal joined to the *Abaclat* case or to any other investor-host State dispute case. Neither was there any parties' agreement to the effect of directing common action with respect to one aspect or another of the proceedings in each of the three instituted cases dealing at present with disputes relating to Argentina sovereign default, as happen sometimes in investor-host State cases by agreement or leave of the parties thereto.\n\n40.\n\nNevertheless and from the very beginning, my co-arbitrators insisted in placing in the shade of *Abaclat* case the unfolding of the organization of the proceedings of the present Tribunal. By recalling this past, I would like simply to say that without such an attitude the present phase in the *Ambiente Ufficio and Others* case could have been concluded long before the delivery of the majority decision on jurisdiction and admissibility of 4 August 2011 in the *Abaclat* case.\n\n41.\n\nFor my part, I did not acknowledge as a member of the present ICSID Arbitral Tribunal (and continue not to acknowledge) the existence of any \"sister\" tribunal or tribunals38 or, up to the moment at the least, aspects of the other proceedings in common or in parallel to those of the present Tribunal, either within or outside the ICSID system. It follows that the explanations given in the paragraphs 10-13 of the present Majority Decision are far from currying with my conviction. They appear rather as the result of a firm inclination to follow the *Abaclat* majority decision all the way notwithstanding that such decision raises more question than it answers, prompting thereby a recent Case Comment to say that: \"The Tribunals in the next Argentine bond holders case at ICSID are not to be envied\" (Hans van Houtte and Bridie McAsey, \"Case Comment. Abaclat and others v. Argentine Republic. ICSID, the BIT and Mass Claims\", *ICSID Review,* Vol. 27, No. 2 (2012), at p. 233).\n\nFurthermore, the term \"sister\" is in the context is equivocal because the relationship affirmed in fact by my co-arbitrators between the present Decision and the *Abaclat* case is not a relation between equal tribunals. In family terms, it appears more accurate to describe it as a relation between a mother and her under-age daughter.\n\n**2. The appeal of** ***Abaclat*** **majority decision for the present Majority Decision**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n42.\n\nThe present Majority Decision tries to present the fact that its conclusions on jurisdiction and admissibility  are essentially the *same* as the conclusions of the majority in the *Abaclat* decision as a kind of *natural coincidence,* resulting from the normal application by different arbitrators of the same Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (\"VCLT\") rules on the interpretation and application of treaties to the facts, in the light of alleged \"substantial parallels\" between the two cases and the submission by the Respondent \"to a large degree\" of same preliminary objections in both cases. Hence, it is pointed out that \"no doubt there is a special, particularly close relationship\" between the two cases. And this is followed by the declaration that the present Tribunal - namely the arbitrators who have signed the present Majority Decision - will \"not hesitate to benefit, where applicable and appropriate, from the reasoning of the *Abaclat* Tribunal\", following by the usual formal disclaimer from adhering to any doctrine of *stare decisis*.\n\n43.\n\nThe Majority Decision describes that what has been done by the Majority implied a process of critically engaging not only with the majority decision of *Abaclat*, but also with the counterarguments containing in the dissenting opinion of Professor Abi-Saab. Concluding again that the Majority \"agrees with many, though not all, considerations and views expressed in the *Abaclat* majority decision\", subject to the caveat below:\n\n\"The Tribunal wishes to emphasize, however, that it is well aware that it is called upon to decide the case submitted to it by the Parties on its own needs and merits. The reasoning of the *Abaclat* Decision can thus be of relevance to that of the present Tribunal only if and to the extent that the Parties in the present case have submitted arguments similar to, and compatible with, those marshalled in the *Abaclat* case.\"39\n\nI must add that when the *Abaclat* majority decision is obviously untenable as a proposition of public international law, for example, by sidestepping \"jurisdictional requirements\" or introducing instead \"admissibility\" as a self-made criteria, the present Majority Decision does not spare efforts to reach the same conclusion that *Abaclat* by other ways, including if necessary to what I consider *ultra vires* solutions amounting to a redefinition of the \"law\" applicable to the subject-matter at issue. The treatment by the Majority Decision of the so-called \"futility exception\" is a good example in that respect.\n\nPresent Majority Decision, para. 13.\n\n44.\n\nThus, the majority in the present Decision admits not only that they have reached similar \"conclusions\" as the *Abaclat* majority, but also (i) that they agree with many (though) not all \"considerations\" and \"views\" expressed in the *Abaclat* decision and (ii) that the \"reasoning\" of the *Abaclat* majority decision is relevant to the present Tribunal to the extent that the Parties have submitted arguments similar to, and compatible with, those marshalled in the *Abaclat* case. The use of the word \"marshalled\" is in itself already revealing of a certain unusual attitude of enfeoffment to somebody else. I must say that I cannot but reject altogether the limitations inherent to these conclusions of the Majority for the adjudicative functions of the arbitrators composing the present Tribunal.\n\n45.\n\nThe fact that members of different international arbitral tribunals seated in different cases at different moments of time coincide essentially in conclusions, reasoning, considerations and views to the extent indicated is indeed an extraordinary event, a rare bird in the practice of international arbitration, deserving as such scrutiny. Some observations on the matter seem therefore in order on what may be described *prima facie* as an attempt to establish rules of general application through case-law independently of the ICSID Convention and Rules.\n\n**3. The fallacy of the \"continuity argument\" underlying the present Majority Decision's position**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n46.\n\nFirst of all, it should be underlined that in the face of an arbitration procedure such as the one provided for by the ICSID Convention (arbitral tribunals of limited jurisdiction constituted *ad hoc* for individual cases) to justify findings, decisions or awards on the ground of the *convenience of assuring case-law continuity* amounts to invoke something alien to the system. To expect, ask for or pretend continuity from a system which as structured cannot deliver it does not make sense. It cannot be consequently right to invoked continuity as a ground or explanation for justifying without further ado any given conclusion as a matter of law, propriety or policy.\n\n47.\n\nThe ICSID arbitral tribunals are not permanent international tribunals, and they have also different compositions. To remedy this situation by placing some ICSID arbitral tribunals in the shade other ICSID arbitral tribunals under the pretence of continuity in decisions and awards is a false and unreal pretention, because is it unfitting within the structures and procedures of the arbitration system established by the ICSID Convention. This is confirmed by the fact that the ICSID Convention does not contain any form of appeal jurisdiction and that the admitted annulment procedure is limited to the grounds expressly listed in the Convention to the exclusion of others (Article 52 ICSID Convention and 50 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules).\n\n48.\n\nIf there is an actual need for changing the system as established, the proper ambit to raise the issue is with the Contracting Parties to the 1965 ICSID Convention and, certainly not, within ICSID arbitral tribunals for the purpose of justifying the adoption of a given finding, decision or award by a majority. I deny therefore the pertinence of the main underlying premises on which, according to my understanding, the passages of the present Majority Decision on the question of the relationship between the present case and the *Abaclat* case are based.\n\n49.\n\nI must add that the underlying appeal to \"continuity\" of the present Majority Decision in order to justify its own conclusions is particularly shocking when the *Abaclat* interpretation of Article 8(3) of the Argentina-Italy BIT is not the first interpretation of that very provision by an ICSID arbitral tribunal. The provision was already interpreted differently by at the least another ICSID arbitral tribunal before the adoption of the *Abaclat* decision of 11 August 2011, namely by the *Impregilo v. Argentina* award of 21 June 2011. The following question arises therefore **:** What does \"continuity\" mean for the present Majority Decision? The *Impregilo* award's interpretation of Article 8(3) of the Argentina-Italy BIT cannot be more opposite in all respects to the interpretation of the provision arrived at by the *Abaclat* majority decision and the present Majority Decision.\n\n50.\n\nHowever, the lack of \"continuity\" of the *Abaclat* with *Impregilo* has not been an obstacle for the Majority Decision in the present case for siding with the interpretative conclusions of *Abaclat* and not with the prior *Impregilo* interpretation. For my part, I side with *Impregilo's* unanimously adopted interpretation which is, in my opinion, a VCLT good-faith interpretation in harmony with both (i) the text of Article 8(3) of the BIT in its context in the light of the object and purpose of the Argentina-Italy BIT and (ii) the *rule of State's consent to jurisdiction,* embodied in the public international law principle of peaceful settlement of international disputes, applicable in the relations between Argentina and Italy (VCLT, Article 31(3)(c)).\n\n51.\n\nIt is worthwhile to quote below the interpretation in *Impregilo* of Article 8(3) of the Argentina-Italy BIT:\n\n\"In sum, Article 8(3) (of the Argentina-Italy BIT) contains a jurisdictional requirement that has to be fulfilled before an ICSID tribunal can assert jurisdiction. This decision is in accordance with the decision in *Wintershall*, where it was found for a very similar clause in the Argentina-Germany BIT that 'Article 10(2) contains a time-bound prior-recourse-to-local-courts-clause, which mandates (not merely permits) litigation by the investor (for a definite period) in the domestic forum' *before the right to ICSID can even materialize.* Impregilo not having fulfilled this requirement, the Tribunal cannot find jurisdiction on the basis of Article 8(3) of the Argentina-Italy BIT\"40 (*emphasis supplied*) *.*\n\n*Impregilo S.p.A. v. Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/07/17), Award of 21 June 2011 (\"*Impregilo*\"), para. 94.\n\n52.\n\nContrary to my co-arbitrators, I cannot but side with Professor Abi-Saab's dissenting opinion in the *Abaclat* case on the paramount role played by the State's consent to jurisdiction rule in determining competences, functions and tasks of international courts and tribunals which are judicial or arbitral organs of limited jurisdiction, as well as with the distinction to be made in that respect between \"general jurisdiction\" and \"special jurisdiction\" whose scopes are defined in the instant case by the ICSID Convention and the Argentina-Italy BIT respectively.\n\n53.\n\nI am likewise in agreement with the conclusions of Professor Abi-Saab on the following corollaries of the State's consent to jurisdiction rule in public international law concerning (i) the legal effects of the non-fulfilment by Claimants of the requirements set forth in Article 8(1) to (3) of the Argentina-Italy BIT, effects which are in line with the *Impregilo* finding **;** (ii) the concept of \"investment\" under the ICSID Convention in general and of \"protected investment\" under the Argentina-Italy BIT in particular **;** and (iii) the distinction between a \"State's consent to arbitration\" formulated in general terms and a \"State's consent to 'collective arbitral actions'\" with the ensuing need of \"adaptation\" of ICSID Regulations and Rules revised not a long time ago, namely on 10 April 2006.\n\n54.\n\nThe reason for that was already explained in the 2005 *Plama v. Bulgaria* decision on jurisdiction in the following terms:\n\n\"Nowadays, arbitration is the generally accepted avenue for resolving disputes between investors and states. Yet, that phenomenon does not take away the basic prerequisites for arbitration: an agreement of the parties to arbitrate. It is a well-established principle, both in domestic and international law, that such an agreement should be clear and unambiguous. In the framework of a BIT the agreement to arbitrate is arrived at by the consent to arbitration that the state gives in advance in respect to investments disputes falling under the BIT, and the acceptance thereof by an investor if the latter so desire.\"41\n\n*Plama Consortium Limited v. Republic of Bulgaria* (ICSID Case No. ARB/03/24), Decision on Jurisdiction of 8 February 2005 (\"*Plama*\"), para. 198.\n\n**4. The attitude of the present Majority Decision towards Professor Abi-Saab's dissenting opinion in** ***Abaclat***\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n55.\n\nIn the present Decision the Majority proclaims that it proceeded also to a \"process of critically engaging with the dissenting opinion of Professor Abi-Saab\" and not only with the *Abaclat* majority decision.42 However, that proclaimed critically engaging process ended systematically with the rejection of the conclusions of Professor Abi-Saab. The question on which the Majority in the present proceedings appears the nearest to Abi-Saab's opinion provides a good illustration of that affirmation. It concerns Professor Abi-Saab's statement to the effect that non-compliance with jurisdictional limits or admissibility conditions in treaties begets *by operation of international law* the inevitable legal sanction of dismissing the case, as failing outside the jurisdiction of the tribunal or as inadmissible.43 The endorsement by the majority of that legal conclusion of Professor Abi-Saab is however followed by a usual \"but\" which voids the apparently initial admission of Professor Abi-Saab's conclusions by the Majority in the present proceedings of any practical effect.\n\nPresent Majority Decision, para. 12.\n\n*Ibid*, paras. 594-95.\n\n56.\n\nLet see it. First, the admission was done in the face of an odd proposition in the *Abaclat* majority decision to the effect that \"the wording of the Article 8 of the BIT itself does not suffice to draw specific conclusions with regard to the consequences of non-compliance with the order established in Article 8\" of the Argentina-Italy BIT.44 Secondly, the Majority Decision nullifies right away the effects of that initial endorsement of Professor Abi-Saab's statement by concluding that Claimants were nevertheless not precluded from resorting to direct arbitration, through an application to the interpretation of Article 8(1) to (3) of the Argentina-Italy BIT of a \"futility threshold\" included of *lege ferenda* by the International Law Commission in a set of draft articles on the topic of \"diplomatic protection\"!!! But, the said draft articles are still subject to consideration within Legal Committee of the General Assembly of the United Nations and have not yet been endorsed by the generality of States as reflecting the customary international law governing \"diplomatic protection\". Notwithstanding these facts, the Majority Decision proceeds to apply that so-called threshold without even asking whether it was actually part and parcel of a rule of positive international law *applicable* in the relations between the Contracting Parties to the BIT, namely between Argentina and Italy, as directed by Article 31(3)(c) of the VCLT.45\n\nThis proposition appears also in other recent arbitral decisions or opinions concerning investor-host State arbitrations. I qualify it as nonsensical because admitting such a proposition amounts to ignoring the secondary rules of public international law codified with general approval in the ILC Articles on the International Responsibility of States for International Wrongful Acts (*see* Resolution 56/83 of the United Nations General Assembly of 12 December 2001).\n\nPresent Majority Decision, paras. 597-623.\n\n57.\n\nThe total identification of the Majority in the present proceedings with the *Abaclat* majority decision is expressly admitted in paragraphs 624-28 of the present Majority Decision. The passages concerned, which are unusual in an ICSID arbitral decision, would appear to have a two-fold purpose. Firstly, the Majority in the present proceedings seems eager to excuse itself before *Abaclat* for having come to the same result concerning the interpretation of Article 8(2) and (3) of the Argentina-Italy BIT but on the basis of a different reasoning. Secondly, it would seem that for the said Majority one of the tasks of the so-called \"sister tribunal\", namely of the present Tribunal, would be to strengthen the findings of the *Abaclat* majority decision. The following peculiar passage deserves to be quoted as an illustration of the said two-fold purpose:\n\n\"The Tribunal cannot ignore, however, that on a more general level the \"futility\" reasoning which governs the present Decision and the \"fair opportunity\" approach endorsed by the *Abaclat* Tribunal are not mutually exclusive, but complement each other. In fact, they seem to be based on different perspectives on the same reality of competing interests. Whilst the 'futility' reason rather looks at the problem from *Claimants* ' side, the fair opportunity approach, by asking whether *Respondent* is given a fair opportunity to address the dispute through its local courts, takes the latter's perspective. Similarly, whereas the emphasis of the 'futility' approach is on the existence for Claimants of an *effective* remedy, the fair opportunity approach draws on the idea of *forfeiture* of Respondent's right to preferential dealing with the case due to its inability or unwillingness to provide effective legal means of redress to the investor(s)\"46 (*emphasis in original*).\n\n*Ibid*, para. 627.\n\n58.\n\nIn sum, the majority in the present phase of this case has rejected the law developed in Professor Abi-Saab's dissenting opinion in its entirety, endorsing from the outset to the end the conclusions of the *Abaclat* majority decision independently of its objective law merits, notwithstanding the fact that at the time of the conclusion of the ICSID Convention \"collective action proceedings\" were quasi non-existent and multiparty proceedings (which should be distinguished from \"mass claims processes\") were quite exceptional cases and generally subject to specific consent.\n\n59.\n\nFurthermore, the Majority seems also to consider that Article 8(3) of the Argentina-Italy BIT would be a kind of autonomous residual default provision allowing, under certain circumstances, to affirm jurisdiction and/or admissibility, independently of the Claimants' fulfilment of the legal prerequisites in paragraphs (1) and (2) of the same Article 8. Thus, jurisdiction or admissibility could be declared by an ICSID arbitral tribunal even against the clear text to the contrary in the BIT and irrespective of the rules of public international law governing State's consent to the jurisdiction of international courts and tribunals applicable in the relations between Argentina and Italy as Contracting Parties to the BIT. But, it happens that, the Majority Decision notwithstanding, *the default of jurisdiction is never a source of jurisdiction in public international law.*\n\n60.\n\nAs recent investor-host State arbitral decisions and awards have had the occasion to recall, in public international law there *does not exist a default jurisdiction.* The residual default rule is no jurisdiction. To try to fabricate a different rule through arbitral or judicial decisions by means of a free interpretation approach to compromissory clauses in BITs cannot but weaken the ICSID system whose cornerstone is the consent of the Contracting Parties, and general public international law as well, and will end in a fiasco.47*Pacta sunt servanda* and the law of treaties are among the most direct casualties, but there are others as well.\n\nAs recent as 6 April 2011, the European Parliament adopted a Resolution which in its paragraph 24: \"Expresses its deep concern regarding the level of discretion of international arbitrators to make a broad interpretation of investor protection clauses, thereby leading to the ruling out of legitimate public regulations; calls on the Commission to produce clear definitions of investor protection standards in order to avoid such problems in the new investments agreements\", cited in Andrea Giardina, Report on *\"Legal Aspects of Recourse to Arbitration by an Investor Against the Authorities of the Host State under Inter-State Treaties\", Yearbook of the Institute of International Law,* Session of Rhodes (2011), volume 74, at p. 54 of the Report.\n\n61.\n\nThe majority considers likewise that the international arbitration standing offer in Article 8(3) of the Argentina-Italy BIT entails consent to all kind of arbitral proceedings and actions and, consequently, is not limited by the silence thereon of the applicable arbitral procedures and rules. Here again, I side with the views developed by Professor Abi-Saab in its dissenting opinion by the simply and elementary reason that the ICSID international arbitral tribunals are not organs empowered by the ICSID Convention and/or the BITs with legislative jurisdiction or power. Assumptions or adaptations to the contrary by individual arbitral tribunals are, in my opinion, generally speaking *ultra vires* the applicable conventional instruments and general international law.\n\n**5. Selective referral by the present Majority Decision to the summary factual background of the** ***Abaclat*** **majority decision**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n62.\n\nFinally, I cannot but mentioning the fact that the present Majority Decision is not a \"self-contained\" arbitral decision because it does not contain any global analysis of the facts of the *Ambiente Ufficio and others case.* For the majority a considerable part of the information provided by the parties would only become relevant at the merits stage. Thus, instead of incorporating in its Majority Decision its own *prima facie* global analysis of the facts relevant for the present case taking account of arguments and evidence submitted by the Parties at the present phase, the Majority Decision send the reader back to the *Abaclat* majority decision in the following terms:\n\n\"[...] the Tribunal acknowledges that the *Abaclat* majority decision, in its paras. 11-64, 70-71 and 75-80, contains a summary of the general factual background of that *Abaclat* case (see para. 10 of *Abaclat*), notably containing an explanation of general concepts related to financial markets and bonds, as far as relevant for the case, a general overview on sovereign debt restructuring and of Argentina's financial crisis and default in 2001 as well as Argentina's activities in terms of restructuring its economy and its sovereign debt (particularly including the Exchange Offer of 2005 and the adoption of Law No. 26,017 on 9 February 2005).\n\n*In the eyes of the Tribunal*, this succinct description of the factual background in the *Abaclat* Decision can also be usefully applied regarding the present case. The Tribunal has already stated that it will refer to the *Abaclat* case, whenever appropriate, and it considers this a valuable opportunity to do so for reason of expediency, namely not to reduplicate an effort that has already been made by *the sister Tribunal*\"48 (*emphasis supplied*) *.*\n\nPresent Majority Decision, paras. 60-1.\n\n63.\n\nThus, regarding the *prima facie* global assessment of the elements of fact of the present *Ambiente Ufficio* case, the Majority identified itself once more with the presentation made in the *Abaclat* majority decision. In my opinion, reasons of elementary arbitral prudence would have advised to proceed otherwise because the factual context is not the same in all respects in both cases. So the majority was obliged to proceed by selectively referring the Parties first to paragraphs 11-64, 70-71 and 75-80 of the *Abaclat* majority decision, namely to the following questions: (1) General Concepts relating to Financial Markets and Bonds; (2) General Overview on Sovereign Debt restructuring; and (3) Argentina's Restructuring of its Economy and its Debt in relation to the Bonds.\n\n64.\n\nHowever, with respect to the latter section (3) the majority left outside of the cross-reference the information contained in paragraphs 65-69 and 72-74 and 81-83 of that section of the *Abaclat* majority decision. Then, those paragraphs provide also in several respects relevant information for an assessment of the Parties' conduct in the present case. In particular, for example, with respect to **:** the 2003 discussions which took place between TFA and the Respondent in order to reach a solution for the outstanding debt **;** the further discussions held between creditor groups, such as GCAB and TFA and the Respondent **;** the 2004 Form 18-K/A that Argentina filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission **;** the information and terms of the supplement to the prospectus of 2004 relating to Argentina's launch of the \"Exchange Offer 2005\" on 14 January 2005 **;** the information and text of Argentina Law 26,017 enacted on 9 February 2005 **;** the period for submitting tenders pursuant to the \"Exchange Offer 2005\" which expired on 25 February 2005 **;** and the alleged fact that the original claimants in the *Abaclat* case did not participate in that Exchange Offer, as well as the information provided on a number of court litigation (lawsuits) initiated by creditors unsatisfied with the terms and conditions of the Exchange Offer 2005.\n\n65.\n\nI consider that the above information is *prima facie* quite relevant to the present phase of the *Ambiente Ufficio* case, *inter alia,* because it shows (i) that Argentina's 2005 restructuring of its sovereign debt follows the principles, steps and methods general applied at the relevant time by the international community to this kind of sovereign financial operation with international overtones. It shows also (ii) that discussions and consultations were possible and that TFA participated therein on behalf of its alleged bondholders while in the present case neither NASAM nor the alleged Claimants participate at any time in any discussion or consultation before filing their 2008 Request for Arbitration with ICSID.49 And it shows likewise that the first reaction of unsatisfied creditors was \"litigation\" and not \"international arbitration\" in ICSID as was generally customary before the organization and funding of unsatisfied creditors by TAF in *Abaclat* case and NASAM in the present case.\n\nThe *Abaclat* majority decision, *supra* note 4, found that the exchanges between TFA and respondent fulfilled, in the circumstances of the case, the \"amicable consultation\" requirement of Article 8(1) of the Argentina-Italy BIT.\n\n66.\n\nThe cross-reference to the summary of the facts in *Abaclat* made in the present Majority Decision does not send back either to section 4 (Evolution of the Dispute following Argentina's Exchange Offer 2005) and section 5 (New Exchange Offer 2010). However, these sections provide quite important evidence for the present phase of the proceedings. For example, Section 4 reproduces *the text of a TFA letter, dated 28 February 2006, to the Argentine Ministry of Economy and Production*, *providing thereby to Minister Lic. Felisa Miceli final notice* that in the light of the alleged Argentina's refusal to negotiate a solution the TFA bondholders contemplate under Article 8 of the Argentina-Italy BIT that if Argentina fails to resolve the dispute amicably and pay within sixty days the said bondholders will have no choice but to commence legal proceedings before ICSID. And the letter concludes by stating that hereby TFA on behalf of TFA bondholders \"accepts the offer of consent expressed by Argentina in Article 8\" of the Argentina-Italy BIT to submit the dispute to ICSID for settlement by arbitration pursuant to the ICSID Convention without entering into any reservation or caveat.50\n\nSee *Abaclat* majority decision, *supra* note 4, para. 84.\n\n67.\n\nThis evidence is determinative concerning some aspects of the \"futility approach\" adopted by the Majority Decision in the instant case. The interest for the present case of the section 5 on the Exchange Offer 2010 is likewise evident because a number of the original Claimants accepted that offer and tender their security entitlements in the old bonds, discontinuing thereby their participation in the *Ambiente Ufficio* case as rightly recorded in the Majority Decision.\n\n68.\n\nLast but not least, the present Majority Decisions fails to make a global assessment of the facts alleged by the Respondent in support of some of its preliminary objections such as, for example, the non-existence of a *prima facie* treaty violation of the Argentina-Italy BIT as alleged by the Claimants. The Majority Decision limits itself to refer to some of those factual elements in a rather fragmentary manner, namely under the particular heading of the various questions considered without a global analysis. This is a further shortcoming of the Majority Decision, because some legal arguments of Claimants are global in nature in the sense of going across the board of various submitted preliminary objections. For example, the argument that under the Argentina-Italy BIT a \"protected investment\" is a unity even when it may encompass elements which do not correspond to such a characterization. Moreover, Claimants consider that the Argentine Republic's issuance and selling of sovereign bonds in the first market and the subsequent selling by Italian Banks in the Italian retail market to Italian nationals of \"security entitlements\" in the Argentine sovereign bonds held by the Banks is \"a single same underlying economic transaction\". The Respondent has refuted those arguments also with overall arguments which go also across the board. All this does not come clearly out in the text of the present Majority Decision.\n\n**Chapter II - Comments on some hinged conclusions and omissions of the Majority Decision**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**1. The distinction between \"mass claims\", \"class action\" and \"representative proceeding\" and \"collective claims\", \"multi-party action\" and \"aggregate proceeding\": a distinction without a difference for the Majority Decision which ignores the rule of consent to arbitration of general international law and the general rule of interpretation of treaties codified by the VCLT**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n69.\n\nIn chapter I, entitled *\"Consent of the Respondent\"*, the present Majority Decision deals exclusively with the issue of Respondent's rejection of the kind of action exercised *\"collectively\"* by the Claimants. The basic jurisdictional question *, namely* the Respondent's general consent to ICSID international arbitration, is considered mainly in chapter VI of the Majority Decision, entitled \"*Compliance with Art. 8 of the Argentina-Italy BIT: the prerequisites of amicable consultations and recourse to Argentine courts*\" *.*\n\n70.\n\nThus, the comments on this section of the Opinion relate only to the preliminary objections of the Respondent concerning its rejection of the kind of collective action exercised by Claimants in the present case. This is certainly an unsatisfactory way of dealing with the core of the *jurisdiction* issue because international tribunals are supposed to give priority to the latter from the very outset of the proceeding in question, but to follow this course in the present Opinion is now unavoidable in the light of the general economy of the Majority Decision. I must add however in discharge of the majority that, ultimately, the cause of the economy of its Decision is to be found in the peculiar manner in which the Parties themselves pleaded their respective cases in the present dispute and in the shadow projected by the *Abaclat* majority decision which, for reasons of its own, sidestepped the jurisdictional requirement, and introduced instead \"admissibility\" criteria.\n\n71.\n\nThe present Majority Decision begins its chapter I by focusing on questions of terminology and characterization raised by Claimants' collective action. I concur generally with this methodology in the light of the need for an early clarification of those matters due to omnipresence of *Abaclat* in the present proceeding and the fact that the *Abaclat* majority decision had characterized initially the proceeding in the case as a \"mass claims proceeding\"51 and later on as a \"hybrid\" in the following terms **:** \"In summary, the present proceedings (*Abaclat*) seem to be a sort of a hybrid kind of collective proceedings, in the sense that it starts as aggregate proceedings, but then continues with features similar to representative proceedings due to the high number of Claimants involved\"52. For obvious objective reasons (smaller number of Claimants), those characterizations are not appropriate for the instant proceeding which does not present the \"mass\" or \"hybrid\" features of *Abaclat*.\n\n*Abaclat* majority decision, *supra* note 4, para. 294. This majority decision begins characterizing the proceedings as \"mass claims proceedings\", but none of the thousands of Claimants in *Abaclat* appears to have been acting as representing the whole of the Claimants or a part thereof. Furthermore, as it has been written: \"Even accepting as the Majority would have us do, the TFA (Task Force Argentina) is acting *like* a representative Claimant does not sit well. It is not for the majority to use the way in which the Claimants have organized their representation to characterize the proceeding. The claims within the *Abaclat* proceeding have been pleaded individually and they must be dealt with as such by the majority; this is the defining characteristic of the proceeding\" (Hans van Houtte, and Bridie McAsey, \"*Case Comment. Abaclat and Others v. Argentine Republic, ICSID, the BIT and MASS Claims*\", ICSID Review, Vol. 27 (2012), at p. 235).\n\n*Abaclat* majority decision, *supra* note 4, para. 488. This prompted Professor Abi-Saab to level the conclusion of the *Abaclat* majority of \"legal genetic engineering\" that \"risk producing a monster\" (Professor Abi-Saab's dissenting opinion in *Abaclat*, *supra* note 37, para. 130).\n\n72.\n\nI concur also with the terminology conclusions of the Majority Decision to the effect that :\n\n(i) in the present proceedings the Tribunal is not confronted with a \"class action\" or a \"mass claim\" but with a kind of \"collective action\" which may, for convenience, be called \"*multi-party action*\" *,* and the subsequent proceeding as a \"*multi-party proceeding*\"53**.** Certainly, the instant proceeding is not a \"representative proceeding\" because it involves, as agreed upon by the Parties from the very beginning, individual examination and determination of individual claims in respect to *ratione personae* jurisdictional issues *.* The instant proceeding is therefore an \"aggregate proceeding\" which was instituted through the exercise of a \"multi-party action\" of originally 119 Claimants, reduced by now to 90.54\n\nMajority Decision, para. 122.\n\n*Ibid*, para. 350.\n\n73.\n\nLikewise, I agree with the Majority Decision that the present proceeding is not either a \"joinder of proceedings\" consolidating those prior instituted on different cases, but rather the original submission of claims by a plurality of Claimants in a single ICSID proceeding.55 But, surely, it is a \"joinder of actions\" under the form of an \"aggregate proceeding\". In this respect the example of *Wintershall* referred to in the Majority Decision56 is far from being out of place in the context for the international law rule of consent to international arbitration. Why? Because neither \"joinders of proceedings\" nor \"joinders of actions\" are regulated in the ICSID basic instruments and in such a silence situation, as *Wintershall* demonstrates with respect to the \"joinder of proceedings\", the *consent or acquiescence* of the respondent is necessary by operation of international law, as confirmed by the Final Report on the Geneva Colloquium held on 22 April 2006.57\n\n*Ibid*, para. 123 and footnote no. 30.\n\nG. Kaufmann-Kohler *et al.*, *Consolidation of proceedings in Investment Arbitration: How Can Multiple Proceedings Arising from the Same or Related Situations be Handled Effectively?*, 21 ICSID Review-Foreign Investment Law Journal, 59 (2006). The situation is different in the ICJ precisely because Article 47 of its Rules empowered the Court to direct that proceedings in two or more cases be joined, independently of the parties' consent to the joining.\n\nMajority decision, paras. 81 and 94. The Parties referred also, particularly at the Hearing, to the \"*litis consorcio facultativo*\" (\"*litisconsorzio facoltativo*\") because arguments on the existence of consent became mixed up with the question of whether multi-party proceedings in ICSID arbitration presupposes a certain commonality or relationship of legal and factual elements between the would-be co-claimants, as it is often the case in domestic law (the Majority Decision addressed this latter question in its paras. 152 and ff).\n\n74.\n\nThe clarification on the different types of actions, claims or proceedings made by the Majority Decision appears however, at the end of the day, as *a distinction without a difference* because the majority in the present case reaches on the matter, *mutatis mutandis,* conclusions similar to those reached by *Abaclat* majority decision with respect to its declared \"mass hybrid proceeding\". This means that for the instant Majority Decision whatever the characterization of the \"collective action\" and subsequent \"proceeding\" may be, the foreign private investor would be entitled to institute *directly* an international arbitration proceeding against the host State at the ICSID without further ado, in spite of the silence on the subject-matter of the basic applicable texts.\n\n75.\n\nThe explanation for that commonality in the conclusions of both majority decisions notwithstanding the different characterization of the respective \"collective actions\" and \"proceedings\" is due to the fact that both majority decisions are deficient in the treatment of the subject-matter of jurisdiction, an issue which is governed in international arbitration by the consent of the parties to the dispute. In the case of *Abaclat* the majority decision did it, as indicated, by sidestepping \"jurisdictional\" requirements (introducing \"admissibility\" criteria)\".58 In the instant case, by the Majority Decision's interpretation of the *silence* of the ICSID Convention and Rules in favour of the existence of jurisdiction on multi-party arbitrations using as a pretext the lack of express exclusion of these arbitrations by the pertinent provisions of ICSID law. As it will be indicated below, in this opinion, the invocation of the *\"contracting out\"* argument in matters concerning the consent to international arbitration of the parties to the dispute is a fallacy.\n\nHans van Houtte and Bridie McAsey, *'\"Case Comment. Abaclat and Others v. Argentine Republic...*\", *supra* note 51, at p. 233 (*see also* para. 41 of this Opinion).\n\n76.\n\nIt is my opinion that in public international law the \"silence\" of the objective applicable law in no occasion may be interpreted in favour of the existence of jurisdiction. To remedy the legal effects of that \"silence\" in jurisdictional matters in a given case a manifestation of a specific consent of both parties to the dispute is necessary, in particular of the respondent because claimants' consent manifests itself by the very act of instituting the proceeding. This is the situation in the instant case. Furthermore, in institutional international arbitration systems, such as ICSID, if the basic instrument, the 1965 Washington Convention in the instant case, contains requirements limiting the scope of application of the system, the consent of both parties to the dispute cannot go beyond those limits by virtue of the application of the so-called *doublebarrelled test.* It is on that basis that I consider generally that representative proceedings and proceedings partaking of both aggregate and representative proceedings fall outside the ICSID arbitration system as presently established.\n\n77.\n\nIt would seem that, through the distinctions made, the Majority Decision was looking firstly to be rid of, as from the outset, of the counter-arguments made by the Respondent in the face of what the Claimants originally described as \"*actione di gruppi*\".59 And secondly, to find support for the so-called \"ubiquitous phenomenon\" argument advanced by the Majority to counteract Respondent's invocation of the statement in the *Abaclat* majority decision to the effect that \"at the time of the conclusion of the ICSID Convention collective proceedings were quasi-inexistent\", as was actually the case at that time.60\n\nMajority Decision, para. 118.\n\n*Ibid*, para. 134, and *Abaclat* majority decision, *supra* note 4, para. 519.\n\n78.\n\nIn any case, it is clear that for the Majority Decision the present \"multi-party proceeding\" (as for the *Abaclat* tribunal its \"mass\" or, alternatively, \"hybrid\" proceeding) would not require *the consent or acquiescence of the respondent* even when, as in the instant case, the arbitration agreement between the parties to the dispute (executed by the \"arbitration offer\" of the 1990 Argentina-Italy BIT purportedly accepted by the Claimants) is, in my opinion, as silent as the 1965 ICSID Convention with respect to \"multi-party proceedings\". Concerning the latter Convention the published *travaux pr\u00e9paratoires* (\"*travaux*\") show that a commentary to the definition of \"national\" in an August 1963 draft which referred expressly to \"association of persons\" vanished by 1964.61\n\nICSID, *The History of the ICSID Convention: Documents concerning the origin and the formulation of the* *Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between states and nationals of other states*, Vol. II-1, at pgs. 170 and 610.\n\n79.\n\nParticularly relevant on the point is the fact that the ICSID Institution, Conciliation and Arbitration Rules are also silent on \"multi-party proceedings\", as well as on \"mass\" or \"hybrid\" proceedings. The Tribunal has not been informed either of any Contracting States' attempt or, for the matter, of the World Bank to open an amendment procedure of the ICSID Convention thereon pursuant to the provisions set forth in Chapter IX of the Convention.\n\n80.\n\nHowever, the Majority Decision concludes as follows :\n\n\"In the Tribunal's view, this interpretatory effort clearly points into one direction. Nothing has emerged from the preceding legal analysis that would militate in favour of interpreting the 'silence' of the ICSID Convention as standing in the way of instituting multi-party proceedings. Quite on the contrary, not only are multi-party arbitrations not excluded by the pertinent provisions of ICSID law, but they are perfectible compatible with them. The analysis of the relevant tribunal practice has not suggested any other outcome. In view of this unambiguous result, the Tribunal sees no benefit in engaging in a policy or efficiency reasoning of any kind, but concludes that the ICSID Convention, the Argentina-Italy BIT and other applicable rules in the present dispute are not opposed to a plurality of claimants jointly submitting a claim to the Centre. In particular, these provisions do not require a specific or additional consent by the Respondent beyond the prerequisite of written consent under Art. 25(1) of the ICSID Convention.\"62\n\nMajority Decision, para. 146.\n\n81.\n\nI am in total disagreement with the above conclusion of the Majority's \"interpretatory effort\" which should not be confused with a treaty interpretation made in conformity with Article 31 of the VCLT. I find the conclusion flaw for several reasons. In the first place, I am obliged to call to attention the fact that in public international law logic is never a source of jurisdiction for international arbitral tribunals. Secondly, the conclusion is based upon the false premise that the \"silence\" in the basic applicable international instruments (characterized by the majority of \"nonopposition\") militates in favour of allowing the institution of multi-party arbitration proceedings. Thirdly, the advance written consent giving by the Argentine Republic in Article 8(3) of the 1990 Argentina-Italy BIT under the form of a \"standing arbitration offer\" does not cover \"multi-party arbitrations\". Fourthly, as a matter of positive international law, the rule of general international law, derived from systemic considerations, of *the consent of the parties to the dispute to international arbitration with its corollaries*, stands in the way of the majority's conclusion *.*63 Then, according to this rule, the parties' consent to international arbitration must be a *manifest consent* with regard to both the very existence of the consent and its scope.64\n\nOn the rule of State's consent to jurisdiction see Chapter IV of this Opinion.\n\nSee, for example, *Daimler*, *supra* note 1, para. 175 *.*\n\n82.\n\nAs stated historically by the Permanent Court of International Justice (\"PCIJ\"), the manifestation of the needed consent may result either from an express declaration or be inferred from a number of acts *conclusively establishing it*65 (prorogation of jurisdiction), and, further, the mere fact that certain events and situations, which the terms of given convention in their ordinary meaning are wide enough to cover, were not thought of, *does not justify interpreting those of its provisions which are general in scope otherwise than in accordance with its terms*.66 In other words, the existence and scope of consent to a given international arbitration cannot be said to have been established by invoking mere \"silence\" or \"non-exclusion\" provisions. It must be determined in accordance with the ordinary meaning of the terms of the text of the provision subject to interpretation in their context and in the light of the object and purpose of the treaty concerned (\"general rule of interpretation of treaties\" codified in Article 31 of the VCLT) *.* An expressed declaration of consent may in turn be given either in a single instrument or in various interrelated documents,67*but it must always be manifest and unequivocal*.\n\n*Rights of Minorities in Upper Silesia* (Germ. v. Pol.), 1928 P.C.I.J. (ser. A) No. 15 (Apr. 26), p. 24.\n\n*Interpretation of Convention of 1919 concerning Employment of Women during the Night*, Advisory Opinion, 1932, P.C.I.J. (ser. A) No. 50 (Nov. 15), p. 377.\n\n*See*, for example, the *Antoine Goetz and others v. Republic of Burundi* (ICSID Case No. ARB/01/2), Award of 21 June 2012 (\"*Goetz II*\"), paras. 1 and 139.\n\n83.\n\nIt is obvious that by the fact of participating in the ICSID Convention the Argentine Republic did not manifest any consent to multi-party proceedings in ICSID arbitrations. The present Majority Decision cannot but admit that the text of Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention uses the singular \"*a national of another Contracting State\"*, as well as in the singular *\"a Contracting State\".* But even so, the majority, invoking *inter alia* the *travaux* of the Convention, concludes that the \"discussions were not conclusive as to the intention to either accept or refuse multi-party arbitrations\".68 But, the term \"national of a Contracting State\" in the singular is likewise used in Articles 1 and 2 of the ICSID Institution Rules adopted by the Administrative Council of the Centre pursuant to Article 6(1)(b) of the ICSID Convention, namely after the adoption of the Convention.\n\nMajority Decision, para. 132.\n\n84.\n\nThe Majority Decision proceeds in a similar way, *mutatis mutandis,* in its reading of the provisions set forth in Article 8(1)(3) and (5) of the Argentina-Italy BIT, affirming without any kind of interpretative demonstration, that \"[t]his provision speaks *interchangeably* of 'an investor' (paras. 1 and 5) and 'investors' (heading and para. 3)\" (*emphasis supplied*). At that point and on the basis that in Article 8(3) of the BIT the term \"investors\" appears in the plural, the majority - ignoring the \"general rule of interpretation of treaties\" of Article 31 of the VCLT -reaches the extraordinary conclusion that \"the ordinary meaning of the term \"national\" in Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention, *when view together* with Article 8 of the Argentina-Italy BIT, may well include the situation of a plurality of investors submitting a legal dispute to the Centre\"69 (*emphasis supplied*).\n\n*Ibid*, para. 131.\n\n85.\n\nThus, according to the Majority Decision the authentic expression of the intentions of the Contracting States manifested in the text of Article 25(1) of the multilateral 1965 ICSID Convention will be revealed in reading it together with the text of Article 8(1)(3) and (5) of a BIT concluded in 1990 by Argentina and Italy. The necessary implication of such an extraordinary assertion would be that for the Majority Decision the ordinary meaning of the terms \"a national of a Contracting State\" in Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention and in Articles 1 and 2 of the ICSID Institution Rules would have no ordinary meaning at all or, alternatively, it has fluctuating meanings according to the terms of text of the BIT at issue freely selected for such a purpose by the interpreter. This first attempt by the Majority Decision for voiding of any sense the *double-barrelled test* will be followed by others as indicated below.\n\n86.\n\nThe appeal to the \"interchangeable\" argument is another conceited fallacy. The terms in the different provisions of a BIT are not *a priori* interchangeable for interpretation purposes. The ordinary meaning of each of them is supposed to be ascertained by the interpreter *in their respective contexts* as provided for in Article 31(1) of the VCLT. Then, the most adjoining context of the term \"investors\" of Article 8(3) of the BIT is the whole of Article 8 (in particular of its paragraphs (1), (2), (4), and (5)) which is the Article of the BIT containing the investment dispute resolution settlement procedures between \"*Investors and Contracting Parties\"*. The fact that in the title \"Contracting Parties\" and not only \"Investors\" are in the plural provides already an appropriate answer to the tentative of appealing to the title to determine the ordinary meaning of the term \"investors\" in the text of Article 8(3) of the BIT.\n\n87.\n\nHaving disposed also of the title argument, one should return to the text of Article 8(3). According to Article 8(3) of the BIT: \"*If a dispute still exists* between investors and a Contracting Party, after a period of 18- months has elapsed since notification of the commencement of the proceedings before the national jurisdiction indicated in paragraph 2, *the dispute may be submitted to international arbitration*\" (*emphasis supplied*). The context represented by the words in italics provide the answer to the question of the ordinary meaning to be given to the term \"investors\" (in the plural) in the said provision, and this answer is indeed the opposite to the one given by the Majority Decision, namely that the term does not include the case of a plurality of investors submitting an investment dispute to the ICSID through a \"multiparty action\".\n\n88.\n\nWhy? Firstly, because, on one hand, the opening words \"*If a dispute still exists*\" of the said paragraph are controlled by the provisions in Article 8(1) and (2) and, on the other hand, the words \"the dispute may be submitted to international arbitration\" are controlled by Article 8(5)(a) and (b). \"The dispute\" which \"still exists\" when one reaches the third step (international arbitration) of the dispute resolution mechanism could not be in such a context but *the same dispute* which was not possible to be resolved previously either through the first step (amicable consultation) or by the second step (the competent administrative or judicial jurisdiction of the Contracting Party in whose territory the investment is located). Then, such a dispute is defined in Article 8(1) as being \"any dispute relating to investments that arises between *an investor from one of the Contracting Parties and the other Party\"*.\n\n89.\n\nIf one turns now to the term *\"international arbitration\"* in Article 8(3), its controlling provisions - namely Article 8(5)(a) and (b) - provide for that \"in the event that international arbitration is resorted to\" *the dispute shall* be submitted, at the election of the investor (in the singular) either to ICSID, as in the instant case, or to an *ad hoc* arbitral tribunal which *shall* proceed in accordance with the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules. Then, neither the Argentina-Italy BIT, nor ICSID Convention and Rules nor the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules contain provisions allowing the possibility of instituting, without further ado, multi-party arbitration proceedings as a means of resolving an investment dispute between a plurality of investors and a host State.\n\n90.\n\nAt this point, the principle of *mutuality* should not be forgotten in the light of the statement in paragraph 13 of the Executive Director' Report that *the Convention permits the institution of proceedings by host States as well as by investors*. Thus, for example, if the term \"a national of another Contracting State\" in Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention would incorporates the plural (nationals), then the term \"a Contracting State\" should also incorporate the plural (Contracting States). But, such an interpretation would well be or become manifestly absurd or unreasonable. For example, in the present case could the Argentine Republic together with the other Latin American States members of Mercosur (parties of course to the ICSID Convention) institute a \"multi-party proceeding\" against the 90 unrelated Italian private foreign investors purportedly claimants in the present case, or a group or a single one of them? I do not think so without the consent or acquiescence of the private foreign investors concerned who, then, would be in the position of respondents. For the Majority Decision such a respondent consent or acquiescence would be unnecessary.\n\n91.\n\nIt should also be recalled that consent to international arbitration is a rule of international law applicable in the relations between Argentina and Italy which as such shall be taken into account by the interpreter in the process of interpreting Article 8(3) of the 1990 Argentina-Italy BIT, as provided for by Article 31(3)(c) of the VCLT. The Majority Decision ignores altogether - in the present context - this element of the general rule of interpretation of the VCLT although *in casu* that general rule applies not only as a customary codified rule of public international law but also *qua* a treaty norm, both Argentina and Italy being parties to the VCLT since before the conclusion of their BIT in 1990.\n\n92.\n\nLastly, Article 5(1)(c) of the Argentina-Italy BIT entitled \"Nationalization or Expropriation\" - which is also part and parcel of \"context\" for the interpretation of the term \"investors\" in Article 8(3) - provides for that *if an agreement is not reached between the investor and the Contracting Party that adopted the measure* (once again the singular) the amount of the compensation shall be determined *pursuant to the dispute resolution procedures indicated in Article 8 of this Agreement.*\n\n93.\n\nThe above considerations confirm that in Article 8(3) of the Argentina-Italy BIT the term \"investors\" (in the plural) does not qualify in any respect the term \"dispute\" - already defined in Article 8(1) - but it is used by the Contracting States for the generic purposes of referring to all those investors who did not succeed to settle their respective *dispute* (in the singular) with the host State through amicable consultations or by litigation in local courts. They are also other provisions of the BIT that refer to \"investors\" in the plural in the same generic sense (for example, Articles 2, 7 and 10).\n\n94.\n\nThe contrary interpretation given in the Majority Decision means that that the term \"investors\" (in the plural) of Article 8(3) of the BIT controls the interpretation of all the rest, namely of paragraphs (1), (2), (3) and (5) of Article 8 of the BIT, and that once the BIT so interpreted, would further control, in turn, Article 25(1) of the 1965 Washington Convention or, for the matter, the whole of ICSID law. This is surely an unlikely proposition which would lead to a result manifestly absurd or unreasonable and, therefore, unacceptable. In the same vein, I cannot but reject the underlying thesis - apparently based upon a subjective appreciation of a presumed intention of the authors of the BIT - that when the nature of a investment alleged to be protected by the BIT appears particularly suitable for a high number of potential claimants, it should be admitted that the Contracting Parties have consented to multi-party proceedings. This thesis disavows altogether the rule of consent to international arbitration of general international law and feigns to ignore that there is no default jurisdiction in the international legal order. The arbitration system of ICSID is not an overall general compulsory arbitration system either. It may of course be amended or modified by the Contracting States, but by nobody else. In any case, it is not the task of individual ICSID arbitral tribunals, established to adjudicate a given case, to assume general legislative tasks.\n\n95.\n\nLooking for support for the thesis that, notwithstanding the silence of the applicable basic instruments, the institution of \"multi-party proceedings\" at the ICSID does not require the consent or acquiescence of the Respondent, the Majority Decision leaves soon the ICSID law and Article 8 of the Argentina-Italy BIT and turns instead its attention to the practice of ICSID and NAFTA arbitral tribunals. It reveals, for example, that 38 out of 398 reported ICSID cases (as of 21 August 2012) are \"multi-party cases\" involving a varying number of claimants ranging from 3 to 14 or 137 claimants.70 Out from these 38 multi-party ICSID cases the Majority Decision reviews only 6 ICSID cases (2 of which are cases under the ICSID Arbitration (Additional Facility) Rules), namely: *Kl\u00f6ckner* (1983); *Goetz I & II* (1999 & 2012); *LG&E Energy Corp* (2004); *Bayview* (2007); *Funnekotter* (2009); and *Alasdair* (2010); as well as one NAFTA/UNCITRAL case: *Canadian Cattlemen* (2008) *.* It is on that meagre case-law basis that the majority sees confirmation of its conclusions on the issue of the Respondents' consent to multi-party proceedings.\n\n*Ibid*, para. 135.\n\n96.\n\nThus the first question which arises is: what happens in the other 31 identified ICSID multiparty cases? I assume that all these cases do not provide support for the majority's thesis otherwise they would have been mentioned in the Majority Decision. An additional problem for the majority is that the cases they have reviewed are of no help for them either, the issue being of course whether they are cases in which a \"multi-party proceeding\" was accepted by an ICSID arbitral tribunal in the face of the opposition of the respondent :\n\n1. *Kl\u00f6ckner and others v. Cameroon*. The Respondent initially argued that the use of the singular in Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention would bar multipartite arbitration, but subsequently it dropped the objection as recorded in the Majority Decision itself.71 The 1983 award of the arbitral tribunal in the case was annulled in 1985 by an ICSID *ad hoc* committee.\n\n2. *Goetz and others v. Burundi.* The case concerns joint claims submitted by 6 Belgian natural person shareholders of a Burundian company. There was therefore a link between the claimants. The respondent did not appear, failing to defend its case (*default* case). Acting pursuant to the *default* ICSID Arbitration Rules, the arbitral tribunal declared itself to be satisfied as to the existence of jurisdiction and upheld it.72 An award of 10 February 1999 (\"*Goetz I*\") incorporated a parties' protocol of settlement (*acuerdo de partes*) and the case was discontinued pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule 43. A further dispute arose later on and a second case entitled \"*Antoine Goetz & Consorts et S.A. Affinage des M\u00e9taux c. R\u00e9publique de Burundi*\" was instituted in June 2011 by the Consorts Goetz (main shareholders of some Burundi companies) and the AFFIMET company (this second case is not recorded in the Majority Decision). Thus, another ICSID arbitral tribunal was established. The Republic of Burundi appeared in this second case and filed some preliminary objections. However, the objections were abandoned in the Reply (*\u00ab la Republique du Burundi accepte la comp\u00e9tence du Tribunal pour le besoin du pr\u00e9sent litige et dans les limites d\u00e9finies dans la pr\u00e9sent R\u00e9plique \u00bb*).73 This was confirmed at the hearing. No opposition of Burundi therefore to this \"multi-party proceeding\". In its award of 21 June 2012, the arbitral tribunal upheld its competence on Consorts Goetz's claims on the basis of a special convention forming an integral part of the protocol of settlement embodied in the award of 10 February 1999 (Article 53(1) of the ICSID Convention) only, excluding thereby the AFFIMET claim.74\n\n3. In the *LG&E Energy Corp., and others v. Argentine Republic* case, the applicable Argentina-United States BIT provides that: \"Each Party (i.e. the Argentine Republic and the United States of America) hereby consents *to the submission of any investment dispute* for settlement by binding arbitration in accordance with *the choice specified in the written consent of the national or company under* paragraph 3\" (Article VII (4) of the BIT). The request for arbitration was jointly made by the three *LG&E* claimant corporations. The respondent does not appear to oppose the exercise of the multi-party action as such. Furthermore, in the context it is understandable that an arbitral tribunal may find that the host State has already given its consent by accepting the said BIT formula.75 But the Argentina-Italy BIT does not have the same all-including formula. Moreover, the arbitral tribunal had rejected a respondent's objection to jurisdiction based upon the lack of *jus standi* of the Claimants by finding that: \"the Claimants should be considered foreign investors, even though they did not directly operate the investment in the Argentine Republic but acted through companies constituted for that purpose in its territory\".76 In the present case, Claimants do not have such kind of link between themselves.\n\n4. In *Bayview Irrigation District v. United Mexican States,* an ICSID Arbitration (Additional Facility) Rules case, the number of claimants alleged to be United States nationals was much bigger than in previous cases (46 claimants). Although unrelated with each other, they claimed to have been harmed by the same allegedly unlawful acts of Mexico.77 The applicable law was NAFTA (a free trade agreement). The Respondent filed three main objections to jurisdiction and admissibility and argued that: \"the claim must pertain to an investment within the scope of NAFTA Chapter Eleven (Section A), *and within the scope of Respondent's consent to arbitration*\"78. As stated in the award of 19 June 2007, NAFTA Article 1101 defines the relevant provisions on the scope and coverage of Chapter Eleven Section A as follows: \"1. This Chapter applies to measures adopted or maintained by a Party relating to: (a) *investors* of another party; (b) *investments of investors* of another Party in the territory of the Party\"79 (*emphasis supplied*). According to the arbitral tribunal, this provision would include not only the substantive protections accorded by NAFTA to investors and investments in Section A but also *\"the scope of the rights to submit disputes to arbitration* *under Chapter Eleven Section B*.80 It is also clear that the language of NAFTA Article 1101 does not exclude the institution of multi-party proceedings by protected investors. After recalling the definition of \"investor of a Party\" and \"investment of an investor of a Party\" in NAFTA Article 1139, the arbitral tribunal analyzed the crucial question at stake in the case, namely whether the claimants were seeking to make, were making, or had made an investment *in Mexico,* or whether, as they argued, the undisputed fact that they had made an investment in Texas was sufficient.81 The tribunal concluded that the ordinary meaning of the text of the relevant provisions of Chapter Eleven is that they are concerned with *foreign* investment, not with domestic investments, therefore declining jurisdiction.82 This award has not been the subject of any annulment proceeding.\n\n5. The majority seems to attach considerable weight to the *Bernardus Henricus Funnekotter and others v. Republic of Zimbabwe* instituted by 13 claimants, Dutch nationals (natural persons). The only link between the claimants seems to be the alleged violations of a Zimbabwe-Netherlands BIT by respondent's measures relating to the implementation of the 1992 Land Acquisition Programme. Jurisdictional objections and merits were considered together. In the Counter-Memorial the respondent stated that it was aware of its obligations in terms of the applicable BIT and that, despite *Claimants' misgivings,* it was willing and able to make restitution, requesting only that the claimants furnish \"the strictest proof\" of their Dutch nationality. In the Rejoinder the respondent declared that it \"does not object to the jurisdiction of the Centre\" and this position was confirmed at the hearing.83 The tribunal considered however that:\n\n\"In light of the importance of jurisdiction as a foundation for arbitral decisions and the special competence granted to arbitral tribunals to determine their jurisdiction, the Tribunal considers it important *to address, albeit briefly, the question of jurisdiction despite the current agreement between the parties. It is the Tribunal's judgment that jurisdiction under the BIT and he ICSID Convention has been established: all three requisites for jurisdiction* *have been met*84 (*emphasis supplied*).\n\nWhat were those \"three requisites\" which the tribunal consider important to address notwithstanding \"the current agreement between the parties\"? They were, as explained in the award, the three classic aspects of the general consent to international arbitration only, namely jurisdiction *ratione personae,* jurisdiction *ratione materiae* and jurisdiction *ratione temporis.85* All other eventual issues of jurisdiction or admissibility were not addressed \"briefly\" because doubtless covered by \"the agreement between the parties\" mentioned in the quotation. In fact, this case provides a further example of a respondent's consent or acquiescence to a \"multi-party proceeding\" (in this case as from the filing of the CounterMemorial). Therefore, the conclusion of paragraph 158 of the Majority Decision is, in my opinion, quite unwarranted.\n\n6. In the case *Alasdair Ross Anderson and others v. Republic of Costa Rica* it should be recalled that the original request included a large number of individuals and companies from several nationalities. After significant revisions, the case was registered at the ICSID, as amended and supplemented, by 137 Canadian individual nationals pursuant to the ICSID Arbitration (Additional Facility) Rules. The respondent submitted five preliminary objections to jurisdiction and admissibility, but none regarding the \"multi-party\" character of the proceeding. The respondent acquiesces therefore to that kind of proceeding. The tribunal declined jurisdiction by upholding a respondent's *ratione materiae* objection to the effect that claimants did not own or control the investments *in accordance with the law of Costa Rica,* as required by the Canada-Costa Rica BIT.86\n\n7. In the *Canadian Cattlemen for Fair Trade v. United States of America* case, the proceeding was instituted by 109 Canadian claimants pursuant to a consolidated arbitration under Chapter Eleven of NAFTA and the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules. No preliminary objections based upon the multi-party character of the proceedings were raised. In fact, the respondent was prevented from doing so by procedural order No. 1 (point 3.6) of the tribunal according to which, in a first procedural stage, the tribunal *shall only deal with a 'preliminary issue'* defined by the parties as follows :\n\n\"Does this Tribunal have jurisdiction to consider claims under NAFTA Article 1116 for an alleged breach of NAFTA Article 1102(1) where all of the Claimants' investments at issue are located in the Canadian potion of the North America Free Trade Area and the Claimants do not seek to make, are not making and have not made any investment in the territory of the United States of the America?\n\nThe Parties agree that a negative determination of this question will dispose of all Claimants' claims in their entirety.\n\nThe Parties also agree that any other objections of a potentially jurisdictional nature shall be reserved for a single merits phase should the claims not be dismissed at the preliminary phase.\"87\n\nBut the claims were indeed dismissed at the first stage by reasons similar *mutatis mutandis* to those which prevailed also in the *Bayview* case, namely that the invoked international protection covered foreign investments, not domestic investments. There was therefore no occasion for considering an eventual objection or opposition to the multi-party action as such.\n\n*Ibid*, para. 136, citing to *Kl\u00f6ckner Industrie-Anlagen GmbH and others v.

United States of America* (NAFTA-UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules), Award on Jurisdiction of 28 January 2008 (\"*Canadian Cattlemen*\"), para. 14.\n\n97.\n\nThe review of the 7 cases referred to by the Majority Decision together with the silence on the remaining 31 multi-party cases out of a total of 398 ICSID cases (see paragraph 95 above), do not allowed me to conclude, as affirmed by the majority, that in the ICSID system multi-party arbitration is a generally accepted practice and that a multi-party proceeding does not require any additional specific consent on the part of the respondent State, beyond the general consent to arbitration of Article 25(1) of the Convention.88\n\n*See*, for example, Majority Decision, para. 145.\n\n98.\n\nTo speak of an \"additional\" specific consent of the respondent seems to me a more unequivocal terminology than the term \"second consent\". The reason being that in none of the cases reviewed does the arbitral tribunal appear to consider the need of a respondent's consent to multi-party arbitration as otherwise than derived from the scope of the general consent referred to in Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention and generally in the jurisdictional title relevant in the case (BIT or NAFTA). In any case, no ICSID arbitral tribunal has admitted \"multi-party proceedings\" against the opposition of the respondent with one exception, and this exception is the *Abaclat* tribunal which did so not with respect to a \"multi-party proceeding\" proper as the present one, but with respect to a \"mass\" or \"hybrid\" proceeding according to the characterizations of the tribunal itself.\n\n99.\n\nThe distinction between \"mass claims proceedings\" and \"multi-party proceedings\" referred to above is, within the ICSID arbitration system, not only a distinction of degree (based upon the more or less large-scale litigation) but of nature, entailing *different legal effects as a result of the rule of the consent of the parties to the dispute governing international arbitration*. In effect, in light of the silence of the ICSID basic texts, it cannot be taken for granted that \"mass claims proceedings\" - which are or tend to be *representative* proceedings - fit in the present framework of the ICSID system. These proceedings need special international provisions and rules like in *foro domestico* special legislation. It follows that in order for these proceedings to enter into the ICSID system, in my opinion, additional international common action would be necessary by those concerned and, in the first place, by the ICSID Contracting States.\n\n100.\n\nHowever, for the rule of consent to international arbitration, \"multi-party proceedings\" proper do not present the same incompatibility with the present ICSID arbitration system so long as they adopt the form of an \"aggregate proceeding\", namely of a proceeding allowing due process examination of each individual claim forming part of the \"multi-party action\". Thus, in the case of these proceedings the silence of the ICSID law and of the relevant BIT may be remedied by an *ad hoc* additional manifestation of consent to the \"multi-party proceeding\" concerned on the part of the respondent. The case-law above confirms that proposition and that such a respondent's consent may be manifested even by acquiescence or other forms of conclusive conduct, as well as that the respondents are more ready to do so when there is some kind of link between the claimants.\n\n101.\n\nBut, although flexible in the forms of its manifestation, the said respondent's consent is needed with respect to a \"multi-party proceeding\" when the basic texts are silent - as in ICSID law - on the admissibility of collective forms of action. In the instant case, the silence of the ICSID basic texts has not been remedied by an additional consent of the Argentine Republic as Respondent neither in the \"arbitration offer\" contained in the Argentina-Italy BIT nor in any *ad hoc* manner. In fact, the Respondent manifested its opposition from the very outset to the \"multiparty\" action of the Claimants, namely as from the filing of Claimants' Request for Arbitration, and has maintained that opposition throughout the present proceeding.\n\n102.\n\nThus, I agree with the passages of Schreuer's *Commentary on the ICSID Convention* (first and second editions) in which the Professor states that more than one party on the investor's side in one set of proceeding is perfectly possible,89 but providing, of course, that the nature of the proceeding instituted thereby fits within the present ICSID arbitration system and the respondent's consent to the \"multi-party proceeding\" instituted by the claimants is further duly established, as required by international law which - according to the Majority Decision itself - is the law applicable to decide jurisdiction and admissibility issues in the present case.\n\n*Ibid*, para. 143.\n\n103.\n\nThe Majority Decision's assertion that no requirement of respondent's consent can be derived from the academic literature referred to by the Parties90 is indeed a daring assertion. One example would suffice to prove that such kind of affirmations never go too far. I am referring to the statement of Professor S.I. Strong - quoted by Professor Abi-Saab in his dissenting opinion in the *Abalat* decision referred to the Tribunal - which reads as follows:\n\n\"(T)he first question raised in every arbitration is whether the parties have agreed to arbitrate this particular dispute. This issue [...] can be termed 'primary consent'... Instead, class arbitration focuses for the most part on what can be called 'secondary consent', meaning consent to this particular kind of procedure\"..... *This concept is by no means unique to class* *disputes, since traditional multiparty arbitrations are also required to establish secondary consent in cases where the arbitration agreement are silent or ambiguous as to multiparty treatment\"* (S.I. Strong, \"Does Class Arbitration 'Change the Nature' of Arbitration?, *Stolt Nielsen, AT&T* and Return to First Principles\", 17 *Harvard Negotiation Law Review*).91\n\n*Ibid*.\n\nProfessor Abi-Saab's dissenting opinion, *supra* note 37, in *Abaclat*, para. 173.\n\n104.\n\nI agree with the above statement in so far as to multi-party arbitrations in the ICSID system are concerned but not, for the reasons already mentioned, with respect to mass claim representative proceedings. I consider the features of the latter proceedings incompatible with the present ICSID arbitration system and, consequently, beyond the possibility for the consent of a given respondent State to remedy the situation. In the ICSID system the characterization of the instituted proceeding as \"a mass dispute\" or a \"multi-party dispute\" *stricto senso*, is therefore quite determinative for the continuance of a proceeding instituted by a collective action; a characterization which should be done bearing in mind not only the number of claimants but also the kind and nature of claims submitted to the arbitral tribunal for adjudication.\n\n105.\n\nAs already indicated, I have no doubt that the instant case is an ICSID multi-party aggregate proceeding. Furthermore, with 90 Claimants it is not unmanageable for the Tribunal. However, the proceeding is defective because being instituted unilaterally by a \"multi-party action\" it is in need of the respondent's consent or acquiescence which was not delivered and continues to be missing. Without prejudice to the terminological caveat above (paragraph 98), I will conclude this section of my Opinion quoting the following passage of Professor Abi-Saab on \"multi-party arbitrations\" which confirms my own conclusion on the item considered :\n\n\"Concerning multi-party arbitrations, as the majority award states, the issue was raised during the drafting of the ICSID Convention, but the question was left open. It was debated during the latest revision of the Rules, but again was not expressly addressed in the revised Rules of 2006. But the absence of written regulation does not mean absence of rules. Indeed, the few cases of multi-party arbitrations which took place within the ICSID framework (and also NAFTA), were always either with the clear agreement of the parties or *with no objection from the Respondent*, which amounts to an implied consent. Thus, the rule of \"secondary consent\" was consistently upheld in multi-party arbitration92 (*emphasis supplied*).\n\n*Ibid*, para. 175.\n\n**2. The agreement to arbitrate between the parties to the dispute under the BIT system: the disregard by the Majority Decision of paramount aspects of the formation of that agreement and its execution**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n106.\n\nInternational arbitration is an international law means of settlement of disputes in which the consent of the parties to the dispute plays a paramount role. As indicated in the preamble of the *Model Rules on Arbitral Procedure* adopted in 1958 by the ILC, the *undertaking to arbitrate* is based on the following fundamental rules: (i) the undertaking constitutes a legal obligation which must be carried out in good faith, (ii) the undertaking results from agreement between the parties and may relate to existing disputes or to dispute arising subsequently; (iii) the undertaking must be embodied in a written instrument, whatever the form of the instrument may be; (iv) the procedures suggested to States parties in a dispute by the *Model Rules* shall not be compulsory unless the States concerned have agreed, either in the *compromise* or in some other undertaking, to have recourse thereto, and (v) the parties shall be equal in all proceedings before the arbitral tribunal.\n\n107.\n\nThe jurisprudence of the ICJ and the decisions of arbitral tribunals in inter-state arbitrations have frequently recalled that arbitration is a consensual means of dispute settlement and that the competence of international arbitral tribunals derives from a clear and unqualified consent thereto by both parties to the dispute. For example, in its Judgment of 19 May 1953 in the *Ambatielos* case (merits: obligation to arbitrate) the ICJ stated that:\n\n\"The Court is not departing from the principle, which is well established in international law and accepted by its own jurisdiction as well as that of the Permanent Court of International Justice, to the effect that a State may not be compelled to submit its disputes to arbitration, without its consent\".93\n\n*Ambatielos Case* (Merits: Obligation to Arbitrate), Greece v. United Kingdom, (\"*Ambatielos*\") I.C.J. Reports 1953, p. 19.\n\n108.\n\nThe same applies *mutatis mutandis* to international arbitral procedures applicable nowadays to investment disputes between the host State of the investment and a private foreign investor in the territory of that State. As explained in the Report of the Executive Directors on the 1965 ICSID Convention, consent in writing of the parties to submit to ICSID arbitration is the \"*cornerstone of the jurisdiction of the Centre*\"94 Moreover, Article 25 of the ICSID Convention provides that the jurisdiction of the Centre shall extend to any legal dispute arising directly out of an investment between a Contracting State and a national of another Contracting State, *which the parties to the dispute consent in writing to submit to the Centre*. Furthermore, The Preamble of the ICSID Convention states that no Contracting State shall by the mere fact of its ratification, acceptance or approval of this Convention *and without its consent* be deemed to be under any obligation to submit any particular dispute to ICSID conciliation or arbitration (last paragraph of the Preamble).\n\nReport of the Executive Directors, paras. 22-3. The term \"jurisdiction of the Centre\" is used in the 1965 ICSID Convention as a convenient expression to mean *the limits within which the provisions of the Convention will apply* and the facilities of the Centre will be available for conciliation and arbitration proceedings.\n\n109.\n\nNowadays, the necessary *agreement to arbitrate between the parties to an investment dispute* is most often to be executed, as in the present case, under the form of an \"arbitration offer\" of the host State contained in a bilateral investment treaty concluded with the State of the nationality of the foreign investor (the BIT) following by the acceptance in writing by the foreign investor of the \"arbitration offer\" defined by the host State and the national State of the investor in the BIT concerned. It follows that the agreement to arbitrate a given legal dispute arising directly out of the investment is formed, under the BIT system, by the matching of the consent of the host State and the consent of the foreign investor parties to the dispute, each of them manifested in the form indicated respectively.\n\n110.\n\nThus, the main jurisdictional issue posed by the consent of the foreign investor for an arbitral tribunal seized of an investment dispute is the determination of whether the scope of the foreign private investor's consent embodied in *acceptance in writing* of the \"arbitration offer\" of the host State matches the scope of the latter's consent as embodied in *the dispute-resolution provision of the BIT concluded by that host State and the national State of the investor concerned,* because only when both consents match each other may the necessary agreement or undertaking to arbitrate between the parties to the investment dispute be considered to have been executed. A second main related issue is the need to determine whether at the time of instituting the arbitral proceeding, by filing for example a request for arbitration with ICSID, it may be say that a *legal dispute arising directly out of an investment* already existed between the foreign private investor and the host State, as provided for in Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention.\n\n111.\n\nThe Decision on Jurisdiction and Admissibility adopted by the Majority Decision considers the question of the \"*Consent of the Claimants*\" in its chapter II.95 In this chapter, the Decision analyses a series of issues on the consent of the Claimants pleaded by the Parties, such as: (i) the fact of the lack of Claimants' signature on the Request for Arbitration filed with ICSID on 23 June, 2008, in plain contradiction with what is stated in paragraph 84 of the Request; (ii) the question of defects (purported invalidity and defects in the scope) of the Power of Attorney given by the Claimants to Avv. Parodi and the eventual bearing on the matter of the NASAM mandate; (iii) the fact of the lack of Avv. Parodi's signature from the Request for Arbitration notwithstanding the Request's statement (paragraph 6) about the joint representation of the Claimants by Parodi, di Brozolo and Barra; (iv) the question of the evidentiary value of Avv. Parodi's letter of June 3, 2008 (submitted to the Tribunal on the third day of the Hearing) on Avv. Radicati di Brozolo and Professor Barra's powers to represent the Claimants and to defend them jointly or severally; and finally (v) the question of the role of NASAM and its eventual control of the Claimants in the present proceedings.\n\nParas. 173-278.\n\n112.\n\nI disagree with most of the conclusions of the Majority Decision on these various questions and, in particular, with the way in which the contradictions, errors and omissions of the Request for Arbitration are treated. In the Majority Decision the resulting vices and shortcomings seem to be considered as if all of them were deficiencies of low intensity as to the legal effects. I disagree. In fact some of them, in particular those relating to the Request for Arbitration filed by the Claimants are not of low intensity at all because they concern the instrument containing, as admitted by practice, their written acceptance of the \"arbitration offer\" of the Respondent. Then, the Request is a document *vitiated by incongruity* in many essential respects.96\n\n*See* Chapter IV of the present Opinion.\n\n113.\n\nIn such kind of situation, it is not acceptable the position of some commentators referred to in the present Majority Decision, to the effect that once a request for arbitration is registered by ICSID deficiencies in the request can no longer be raised and cannot operate as a bar to the jurisdiction of the Centre and the competence of the arbitral tribunal. *97* The acceptance of such a nonsensical proposition would amount in practice to leave out of any objective legal control the *foreign private investor's written consent to arbitration* required by Article 25 of the ICSID Convention when (as in the instant case) the consent of the investor is given through the filing of a request for arbitration with the Centre.\n\nMajority Decision, para. 266.\n\n114.\n\nIt would be so, because in the light of recent practice, it appears that the control by the ICSID Secretary-General of the registration of a request for arbitration is not understood as entailing the verification of the essential validity of the request concerned. In such circumstances, to bar arbitral tribunals from carrying out such a control - because the registration is already accomplished when they have the opportunity to intervene - would amount to leaving foreign private investors' purported consent to arbitration the dispute with the host State (when expressed under the form indicated) out of any objective control as to its legal validity, and this is unacceptable as a proposition.\n\n115.\n\nLastly, the main failure of the Majority Decision's consideration of the \"consent of the claimants\" item is the absence of a thoughtful verification of the determinative issue of whether or not in the light of the text and the incongruities of its contents the Request for Arbitration filed with ICSID, it may still be said that by its filing the Claimants have accepted the \"standing arbitration offer\" of the Respondent embodied in Article 8 of the 1990 Argentina-Italy BIT, so as to be able to conclude that the agreement to arbitrate between the Parties to the present dispute, needed for establishing the jurisdiction of the Centre and the competence of the Tribunal, has been duly executed.\n\n116.\n\nThat omission is not a minor question. In the circumstances of the present case, the issue has a direct bearing on the determination of the existence between the Claimants and the Respondent of an agreement to arbitrate the investment dispute referred to the present Tribunal, as well as on the determination of whether it may be said that a legal dispute thereon existed between the Parties to the present proceeding at the time of the Claimants' filing of the Request for Arbitration, namely on 23 June 2008. I will turn my attention to those questions in Chapter IV of the present Opinion guided by the legal and logical considerations which inspired the 2002 *Mihaly* Tribunal.98\n\nSee quotation above in paragraph 30 of this Opinion, *supra* note 27. Other ICSID arbitral tribunals have also acted inspired by the same considerations; for instance, the *Funnekotter* tribunal, *supra* note 83, and the 2012 *Goetz II* tribunal, *supra* note 67, notwithstanding the parties being in agreement as to the existence of jurisdiction.\n\n**3. The definition of the \"protected investors\" (jurisdiction** ***ratione personae)*****: the prejudging and errors of the Majority Decision in the interpretation and application of the relevant provisions of the ICSID Convention and the Argentina-Italy BIT**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n117.\n\nRegarding jurisdiction *ratione personae,* the mandate given by the Parties to the Tribunal in the present phase of the case was to deal with objections of a general character only, not with any jurisdictional issue that may arise in relation to individual claimants.99 Notwithstanding this limited mandate, the Majority Decision \"concludes that no doubts regarding the jurisdiction *ratione personae* of the Centre in relation to the present case have become manifest\".100\n\nMinutes of the First Session of the Tribunal, point 14.\n\nMajority Decision, chapter III, para. 322.\n\n118.\n\nThis conclusion of the majority prejudges, unnecessarily in my opinion, the issue of the jurisdiction *ratione personae* because it is not legally admissibly to conclude in the abstract that such a jurisdiction exists prior to a detailed verification, accompanying if necessary by an expertise, whether or not each individual Claimant meets the *ratione personae* jurisdictional requirements of the ICSID Convention and the 1990 Argentina-Italy BIT. All aspects of the jurisdiction of an international tribunal are supposed to be ascertained *in concreto*, not by more or less founded conjectures. It should not be forgotten that in the present case - as admitted by the Majority Decision - each Claimant is exercising an action of its own, although collectively, namely all together a \"multi-party action\".\n\n119.\n\nFurthermore, the evidence submitted by the Parties concerning the *ratione personae* jurisdiction issues is not in the present case so persuasive or conclusive as to dispose of the matter in the way that the Majority Decision does. On the contrary, all concur, in my opinion, to reach the *prima facie* conclusion that the *ratione personae* jurisdiction issue does not have in the circumstances of the present \"multi-party proceeding\" an exclusively preliminary character and, consequently, should have been joined to the merits in order to be considered at that phase jointly with the always pending individual Claimants *ratione personae* jurisdiction issues, as I suggested during the proceedings to my co-arbitrators.\n\n120.\n\nProbably, the shadow of the characterization of *Abaclat* proceeding as a \"hybrid\" (see above) has obfuscated the minds. In a proceeding with 60,000 Claimants as *Abaclat* where there was a question of applying particular methods, including sampling techniques of verification, the distinction between \"general\" and \"individual\" *ratione personae* jurisdiction issues may make sense, but in the present proceeding the Tribunal is not dealing with a \"mass\" of Claimants. This distinction is unjustified in a proceeding with 90 Claimants as the present one where a detailed examination and verification of the *ratione personae* requirements of each individual Claimant is doubtlessly manageable for the Tribunal.\n\n121.\n\nAs already indicated, the present multi-party proceeding is of a workable magnitude. NASAM is not acting in the instant case like a representative Claimant and Counsel for Claimants is not exercising expansive powers of attorney as TFA and Counsel in *Abaclat*, respectively. In any case, if after the individual examination and verification at the merits phase of the submitted evidence concerning the remaining 90 Claimants none of them fulfils the relevant *ratione personae* requirements the Tribunal would not have *ratione personae* jurisdiction, notwithstanding the present declared general conclusion of the Majority Decision which then would become an empty shell.\n\n122.\n\nAs to the requirements of the *ratione personae* jurisdiction of the Claimants, \"nationality\" and \"domicile\" are not, in the instant case, the only ones requiring verification. There are other elements like \"consent\" and \"being a holder of a protected investment in the territory of the Argentine Republic at the relevant dates\", which are also in need of detailed verification before being in a position allowing the Tribunal to declare the existence of *ratione personae* jurisdiction, either in general or with respect to each individual Claimant.\n\n123.\n\nTo justify its prejudging conclusion on *ratione personae* jurisdiction, the Majority Decision, following closely Claimants' argument, invokes a passage in the reasoning of the *Bayview* award to the effect that \"(i)t is clear that there are at least some Claimants who meet the requirement that they be nationals or enterprises of a Party.\"101 It is on this base that the Majority Decision concludes as follows:\n\n\"Also in the dispute at hand, there can be no doubt that at least some of the Claimants qualify as 'nationals of another Contracting State' in the meaning of Art. 25(2) of the ICSID Convention and as 'investors' in the meaning of Art. 1(2) of the Argentina-Italy BIT. This suffices to establish the jurisdiction *ratione personae* in the present dispute and to allow the case to move forward to the merits stage\".102\n\n*Ibid*, para. 324 (first sentence), citing *Bayview*, *supra* note 77, para. 89.\n\n*Ibid*, para. 324 (second and third sentences).\n\n124.\n\nThis extraordinary conclusion becomes still more surprising when one reads the quoted sentences in the context of the *Bayview* award's relevant paragraph which is drafted as follows:\n\n\"Doubts have been raised as to whether all of the Claimants are qualified investors, in terms of their nationality. For the present, however, the Tribunal sets those doubts to one side, because it is clear that there are at least some Claimants who meet the requirement that they be nationals or enterprises of a Party, in this case the United States. That takes us to the question whether there is a Claimant who 'seeks to make, is making or has made an investment'\".103\n\n*Bayview*, *supra* note 77, para. 89.\n\n125.\n\nIt is crystal clear that in the above paragraph the *Bayview* tribunal was not making any conclusion or decision on *ratione personae* jurisdiction even *prima facie*, or making an *obiter dictum* statement on the issue of the nationality of claimants in general within NAFTA. The paragraph contains a mere logical explanation of the choice made by the *Bayview* arbitral to consider certain relevant aspects concerning the territoriality requirement of the \"investments\" protected under NAFTA (a *ratione materiae* issue) *prior* to the consideration of the *ratione personae* nationality requirement of the \"investors\". In the exercise of competence on its own competence (*Kompetenz-Kompetenz*) *,* an international tribunal enjoys discretional authority to choose the order of consideration of jurisdictional requirements, or of preliminary objections, concerning its jurisdiction. The confusion cultivated by the Majority Decision on the referred sentence of the *Bayview* tribunal must be exposed and dispelled because we are not confronted here by a \"arbitral decision or award\" and still less, obviously, by a \"judicial decision\" in the sense of Article 38(1)(d) of the Statute of the ICJ.\n\n126.\n\nThe *Bayview* award went on to consider whether the farms and facilities in Texas of the *purported* claimants qualify them not simply as holders of an \"investment\" in the general sense but as holders of an \"investment\" in the sense of the definition of Article 1139 of NAFTA, entitling as such an investor to initiate under NAFTA the specific claims of the case against Mexico.104 On the basis of the text of that definition, the *Bayview* tribunal concludes that the claimants were investors in Texas, but not \"foreign investors\" in Mexico, because \"the economic dependence of an enterprise upon supplies of goods - in this case, water - from another State is not sufficient to make dependent enterprise an 'investor' in that other State\".105 NAFTA Article 1101(a) and (b) on the scope and coverage of the Treaty excludes \"domestic investors\" and, consequently, NAFTA protection covers \"foreign investments\" of another NAFTA Contracting Party only.\n\n*Ibid*, para. 91\n\n*Ibid*, para. 104.\n\n127.\n\nThus, for the *Bayview* tribunal the crucial question to be answered was: \"whether the claimants have an investment 'in the territory of (Mexico)'\"106 - namely in the territory of a NAFTA Party other than the Party of whom the investors were *purportedly* nationals107 - finding ultimately that the tribunal lacks jurisdiction over all of the claims of the claimants because:\n\n[\u2026] it has not been demonstrated that any of the Claimants seeks to make, is making or has made an investment *in Mexico*. That being the case, the Tribunal does not have the jurisdiction to hear any of these claims against Mexico because the Claimants have not demonstrated that their claims fall within the scope and coverage of NAFTA Chapter Eleven, as defined by NAFTA Article 1101\"108 (emphasis in original).\n\n*Ibid*, para. 112.\n\n*Ibid*, para. 105.\n\n*Ibid* para. 122.\n\n128.\n\nThe definition of the term \"investor\" in NAFTA (Article 1139) does not explicitly requires the investor to make the investment in the territory of another NAFTA State, but it requires indeed that the investor makes an \"investment\" and the investments covered by NAFTA Chapter Eleven are investments of investors of a Party in the territory of another Party to NAFTA (Article 1101(1)(b)). In the instant case, *the definitions of both \"investment\" and \"investor\" of* *Article 1(1) and (2) of the Argentina-Italy BIT incorporates expressly the territorial requirement to text of the respective definitions of those terms.* The one concerning \"investor\" reads as follows:\n\n\"The term 'investor' means any physical or juridical person of one Contracting Party that has made, is making or has assumed an obligation to make investments in the territory of the other Contracting Party.\"\n\nOne cannot but wonder about what international law rules of treaty interpretation have been applied by the Majority Decision to uphold general *ratione materiae* jurisdiction in the face of the text of the definition of the term \"investor\" in Article 1(2) of the BIT.\n\n129.\n\nThe Majority Decision does not explain in the section of chapter III concerning the nationality requirement how it is possible to declare the existence of *ratione personae* jurisdiction in the case (general or otherwise) while bypassing the territoriality requirement of *the text* of Article 1(2) of the 1990 Argentina-Italy BIT where the term \"investor\" is defined. The territoriality requirement is considered by the Majority Decision in its chapter IV (\"Existence of a Legal Dispute Directly Arising Out Of An Investment\") (paragraphs 496 and ff) but the conclusions on the nationality issue of chapter III (paragraphs 322-326) do not refer at all to the territorial requirement of the definition of \"investor\" and make no cross-reference to the relevant paragraphs of chapter IV.\n\n130.\n\nHowever, it did not prevent the Majority Decision from doing what amounts to a prejudging, namely declaring the existence of jurisdiction *ratione personae,* with the sole caveat of whether a more detailed analysis \"regarding the nationality and domicile requirements\" would raise doubts \"as to whether certain individual Claimants qualify\" *providing the Respondent, in the further course of the proceedings, submit relevant information to the Tribunal.*109\n\nMajority Decision, para. 325.\n\n131.\n\nHaving made *disappear* by a sleight of hand the territoriality requirement of the definition of the term \"investor\" of the BIT within the consideration of the nationality issue, the Majority Decision does *refer* to that requirement in the context of its consideration of the Respondent's claims regarding the lack of standing of the Claimants together with other heteroclite arguments such as **:** the remoteness of the Claimants as holders of security entitlements, the decisions of Italian domestic courts regarding claims brought by the Claimants against banks and financial intermediaries, and NASAM's role in present proceedings. It is in this context that the Majority Decision sends the reader back to the consideration of the territoriality requirement made with respect to the term \"investment\" within chapter IV of the Majority Decision, in the following terms :\n\n\"[...] the Respondent's related argument that the Claimants are not investors within the meaning of Art. 1 para. 2 of the Argentina-Italy BIT because they did not make an investment in the territory of the Respondent, as expressly provided for in that rule [...], will be dealt with in further detail, and disposed of, in the context of discussing the analogous territoriality requirement contained in Art. 1 para. 1 of the Argentina-Italy BIT regarding the concept of 'investment'. Respondent itself concedes in that regard that 'investors do not exist in isolation from investments' so that, in relation of the question at hand, the Tribunal would refer *mutatis mutandis* to the pertinent Chapter in the present Decision\".110\n\n*Ibid*, para. 328.\n\n132.\n\nIn any case, the territoriality requirement of the definition of \"investor\" in the Argentina-Italy BIT raises, unquestionably and mainly, an issue of jurisdiction *ratione personae* (not of Claimants' standing) as confirmed by the fact that in chapter IV(2)(c)(2) of the Majority Decision the territoriality requirement is treated as a jurisdictional requirement, and rightly so. To avoid doing it in the present context is but one example of the Majority Decision tendency to sidestep jurisdictional requirements as much as possible or to keep them in the dark. The caselaw confirms however that the territoriality requirement, whatever its field of application, including in relation to the definition of the term \"investor\", raises a jurisdictional requirement. Reference has already been made above to the *Bayview* award in this regard. In the same vein, the 2008 *Canadian Cattlemen* award is relevant, whose operative part reads as following:\n\n\"This Tribunal does not have *jurisdiction* to consider claims under NAFTA Article 1116 for an alleged breach of NAFTA Article 1102(1) where all of the Claimants' investments at issue are located in the Canadian portion of the North American Free Trade Area and the Claimants do not seek to make, are not making and have not made any investment in the territory of the United States of America\"111 (*emphasis supplied*).\n\n*Canadian Cattlemen*, *supra* note 87, Decision 1 on page 124.\n\n133.\n\nAll this cannot but lead to the conclusion that the Majority Decision has entered into prejudging when in paragraph 322 of chapter III the Tribunal concludes \"no doubts regarding the jurisdiction *ratione personae* of the Centre in relation to the present case have become manifest\". The Majority Decision declares also that \"photocopies of passports or identity documents or certificates of incorporation will suffice to adequately substantiate the Italian nationality requirement for natural and juridical persons, [\u2026] as long as there are no relevant counter-indications and as long as the Tribunal is satisfied that the documents are in order.\"112\n\nMajority Decision, para. 319.\n\n134.\n\nBut, it is a fact that the Tribunal has not yet proceeded to a detailed assessing of the probative value of the said documents, or of any other piece of evidence submitted in this respect, and nevertheless the majority proclaims itself *in the abstract* already satisfied to the point of concluding that *ratione personae* jurisdiction has been established at the least in a general sense.\n\n135.\n\nCertainly, it was not within the present phase for the Tribunal to make the needed detailed examination and verification of that documentation in so far as it relates to individual Claimants. But then, the whole of the *ratione personae* jurisdictional issue (general and individual) should have been joined to the following merits phase, so as to avoid any kind of unwanted prejudging.\n\n136.\n\nWhen the Majority Decision affirms, as indicated, that at least some of the Claimants qualify as \"nationals of another Contracting Sate\" in the meaning of Article 25(2) of the ICSID Convention and of Article 1(2) of the Argentina-Italy BIT, it is making an assumption, no more,113 in order to be in the position of declaring as a general finding that **:** \"[...] the Claimants have, as a matter of principle, successfully substantiated that they have Italian nationality\".114 Such a finding when the examination and verification of the relevant submitted documental evidence is still pending cannot be characterized but as a prejudgment. Why to do such an obvious prejudging? There must be some urgent purpose for the majority to do so. Looking to the economy of chapter III of the Majority Decision, it appears that the answer to the question is that the majority intended to make easier the burden of proof for the Claimants at the expense of burdening the Respondent with a heavier lot.\n\n*Ibid*, para. 324.\n\n*Ibid*, para. 326.\n\n137.\n\nThus, the prejudging is far from being neutral from the standpoint of the equality of the Parties in the proceeding. Through the said so-called general finding, the majority does make a partial reversal of the burden of proof in favour of the Claimants, as expressly reflected in paragraphs 312 and 325 of the Majority Decision. It tries to justify its behave by stating that it was taking as \"guidance\" the finding of the *ad hoc* committee for annulment the 2007 *Soufraki v. United Arab Emirates* award, one of the exceptional cases in which ICSID tribunals have reviewed nationality documentation issue by State officials.115\n\n*Ibid*, para. 318.\n\n138.\n\nHere again the case-law invoked cannot be more negative for the Majority Decision, because the application for annulment of the 2002 award filed by the claimant, Mr. Soufraki, was dismissed by a majority of the *ad hoc* committee. Furthermore, the 2007 *Soufraki* Decision as a whole provides relevant information on case-law and legal authorities116 to the effect that an international tribunal is fully empowered to make its own nationality determinations, even if its decision contradicts official government documents, including :\n\n1. The 1904 *Flutie* case (United States-Venezuela Claims Commission): \"Whatever may be the conclusive force of judgments of nationalizations under the municipal laws of the country in which there are granted, international tribunals, such as this Commission, have claimed and exercised the right to determine for themselves the citizenship of claimants from all the facts present\" (*Soufraki*, para. 68).\n\n2. The 1958 *Flegenheimer* Commission: \"It is thus not sufficient that a certificate of nationality be plausible for it to be recognised by international jurisdictions; the latter have the power of investigating the probative value thereof even if its 'prima facie' content does not appear to be incorrect\" (*Soufraki*, para. 71).\n\n3. The *Champion Trading v. Egypt* (ICSID Case No. ARB/02/9) **:** \"Although the tribunal was presented with conflict and contradictory documents regarding the claimants' nationalities, it did not investigate the accuracy of any of them. Nonetheless, it did make its own independent determination as to the nationality of the claimants by considering the relevant facts and evidence in the light of the applicable law, which was Egyptian law\" (*Soufraki*, para. 72).\n\n4. Aron Broches' statement during the drafting of the ICSID Convention **:** \"There seemed to be a consensus at all four meetings that the certificate of nationality should be regarded merely as *prima facie* evidence rather than 'conclusive proof' and that it should be left to a tribunal, ultimately to decide questions of nationality\" (*Soufraki*, para. 73).\n\n5. R. Jennings and A. Watts, *Oppenheim's International Law*, 9th ed., Harlow, Longman, 1992, pp. 854-55 **:** \"An international tribunal called upon to apply rules of international law based upon the concept of nationality has the power to investigate that state's claim that a person has its nationality\" (*Soufraki*, para. 74).\n\n6. Nathan, K.V.S.K., *The ICSID Convention. The Law of the International Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes*, (Juris Publishing, 2000), pp. 86-7 **:** \"[\u2026] if there is a real challenge from a contracting State as to the nationality of a foreign investor, an ICSID Arbitral Tribunal will be bound to investigate the circumstances of the investor's acquisition of the nationality of a contracting State in order to satisfy itself that the investor is a genuine national of a contracting State and that it has jurisdiction over him\" (*Ibid*) *.*\n\n7. Christoph Schreuer, *The ICSID Convention: A Commentary* (2001) **:** \"A certificate of nationality will be treated as part of the 'documents and other evidence' to be examine by the tribunal in accordance with art. 43. Such a certificate will be given its appropriate weight but does not preclude a decision at variance with its contents\" (*Ibid*) *.*\n\n*Hussein Nuaman Soufraki v. United Arab Emirates* (ICSID Case No. ARB/02/7), Decision on the Aplication for Annulment of 5 June 2007 (\"*Soufraki*\").\n\n139.\n\nThe prejudgment entered by the Majority Decision by declaring as a general finding the existence of *ratione personae* jurisdiction in the present case was a *motu propio* conclusion. It was adopted at the present phase without a procedural need to do so, as well as without due verification of the submitted relevant evidence. Furthermore, as already explained, it is not procedurally a neutral conclusion. By establishing a kind of presumption in favour of Claimants in matters of nationality and domicile it alters the normal allocation of the burden of proof as between the Parties in those matters.\n\n140.\n\nThis is reflecting in the Majority Decision as follows **:** \"The Tribunal concludes that the burden of proof that the Claimants are Italian nationals falls on the Claimants themselves, while the burden to prove the negative elements - i.e. of not being Argentine (or for the matter, dual) nationals and of not having been domiciled in Argentina for more than two years would fall on the Respondent's side\".117 As formulated, this conclusion, in my opinion, makes a departure from a well-settled principle of international law which the ICJ has declared in the following terms, namely:\n\n\"Ultimately, however, it is the litigant seeking to establish the existence of a fact who bears the burden of proving it **;** and in cases where evidence may not be forthcoming, a submission may in the judgment be rejected as unproved, but it is not to be ruled out as inadmissible *in limine* on the basis of an anticipated lack of proof\".118\n\nMajority Decision, para. 312.\n\n*Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua (Nicaragua v. USA)*, Judgment of 26 November 1986, I.C.J. Reports 1984, p. 437, para. 101. See also, *Avena and Other Mexican Nationals (Mexico v. USA)*, Judgment of 31 March 2004 (\"*Avena*\"), I.C.J. Reports 2004 (I), para. 55.\n\n141.\n\nIn the present case, the Claimants are the Party which seeks to establish the fact of being \"protected investors\" and, therefore, by the operation of international law, the burden of proof of all positive and negative relevant elements confirming in the case the nationality and domicile requirements set forth by the applicable law, as well as of the validity of their consent to ICSID arbitration and of being a \"protected investor\" at the time of the filing of the Request for Arbitration at ICSID corresponds to them *in the first place*.\n\n142.\n\nThe non-existence of a \"documentation obligation\" concerning nationality in Rule 2 of the ICSID Institution Rules is irrelevant for the determination of the burden of proof which is a matter regulated by international law. Now, when does the burden of proof correspond to the Respondent? When in the process of rebutting evidence submitting by Claimants, the Respondent asserts affirmatively a fact or facts in defence, as the United States did in the *Avena* case when it contended that particular arrested persons of Mexican nationality were, at the relevant time, also United States nationals.\n\n143.\n\nIn that case, Mexico was not supposed to submit evidence on the fact that the Mexican arrested persons were not United States nationals because the applicable law (Article 36(1) of the 1963 of the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations) did not imposed such an obligation to the \"sending State\" of a consular post, namely to Mexico in the case. The ICJ took, therefore, the right decision when deciding that it was for the United States to demonstrate the United States nationality of the persons concerned and to furnish to the Court with all information on the matter.119\n\n*Avena*, paras. 55-7\n\n144.\n\nIn the instant case, however, the applicable ICSID Convention imposes on a natural person private investor the burden to prove that s/he is a national of a Contracting State on the given dates *and in addition, that on these dates s/he does not have the nationality of the Contracting State party to the dispute* (Article 25(2)(a)); and point 1 of the Additional Protocol to the Argentina-Italy BIT, *inter alia* that *at the time of making* the *investment s/he has not maintained* *domicile for more than two years in the territory of the Contracting Party where the investment was made.*\n\n145.\n\nThus, the Majority Decision erred when in its paragraph 312 it allocated to the Respondent's side the burden of proof **:** \"of (the Claimants) not being Argentine (or, for the matter, dual) nationals and of not having been domiciled in Argentina for more than two years\". I consider further that Rule 34(1) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules does not allow ICSID arbitrators to disregard fundamental rules of procedure of international law when weighing evidence in a given case.\n\n**Chapter III - The \"investment\" requirement of Article 25(1) of the 1965 ICSID Convention and the definition of \"investment\" of Article 1(1) of the 1990 Argentina-Italy BIT: an analysis of the \"protected investments\" (jurisdiction** ***ratione materiae*****)**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n146.\n\nThe Majority Decision devoted its Charter IV to the jurisdiction *ratione materiae,* an outstanding issue in the present case in the light of the novelty of the subject-matter of the Claimants' claims, namely \"security entitlements\" related to sovereigns bonds issued by the Argentine Republic before its sovereign default in December 2001 and the restructuring process of the sovereign debt relating thereto.120 The overall conclusion of the Majority Decision on the issue is formulated in the following terms:\n\n\"Having rejected all preliminary objections of the Respondent as to the purported lack of jurisdiction *ratione materiae* and having assured itself that all requirements of the jurisdiction *ratione materiae* are satisfied with regard to the pertinent bonds and security entitlements, both under Art. 25 of the ICSID Convention and Art. 1(1), of the Argentina-Italy BIT, the Tribunal concludes that there exists jurisdiction [ *ratione materiae* ] of the Centre and, for that matter, competence of the present Tribunal to decide the case at hand.\"121\n\nThe restructuring process was completely voluntary in nature. There is no bankruptcy legislation for sovereign States and, therefore, there is no way to require creditors to accept a proposal for the restructuring of a State's debt, regardless of the percentage of such creditors that are willing to do so. Contrary to the typical \"cram down\" provisions contained in local laws on insolvency, in the Argentine Republic's restructuration each creditor has the right to reject the proposal for the restructuring of sovereign debt and demand the fulfilment of the legal obligations arising under the terms of his debt instrument. It is precisely in order to preserve these unaffected \"contractual rights\" of the holdouts that the underwriters of sovereign debt instruments issued abroad insist that the debt must be governed by the legislation of a jurisdiction other than that of the issuer and that legal remedies before courts other than those of the issuer must be provided for (Argentina's Memorial, para. 46).\n\nMajority Decision, para. 520. The 2011 *Abaclat* decision on jurisdiction and admissibility, *supra* note 4, is the only ICSID arbitral tribunals on sovereign bonds and related security entitlements prior to the present one. concerned; and (iii) that the examples in (a) to (f) of Article 1(1) of the Argentina-Italy BIT are autonomous provisions susceptible of being interpreted and applied independently of the controlling general definition of \"investment for the purpose of the Agreement\" set forth in the *chapeau* of Article 1(1) of the BIT.\n\n147.\n\nI am in full disagreement with the above overall conclusion which is, in turn, based upon a series of particular conclusions all along Chapter IV of the Decision in which the majority takes quite a lot of liberties with respect (i) to the identification and grouping of the underlying economic operations at stake in the present case and (ii) to the interaction and implications of the use of the term \"investment\" in the two conventional instruments referred to in the quotation (the so-called *double-barrelled* test) *.* The first aspect entails essentially the weighing for characterization purposes of a chain of factual transactions, while the second is an operation that is legal in nature involving the interpretation and application of treaty provisions in accordance with the VCLT.\n\n148.\n\nThe Majority Decision - which admits expressly in the instant context to be guided by the 2011 *Abaclat* decision - bases its conclusions on the jurisdiction *ratione materiae* on the three following flawed main propositions: (i) that the economic transactions at stake would constitute a single economic operation which as a whole would qualify as an investment; (ii) that the notion of \"investment\" in Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention would be essentially subjective, being subsumed for all practical purposes under the concept of \"consent\" as defined in the BIT\n\n149.\n\nIt suffices that one of these propositions be wrong for the building so construed by the Majority Decision to fall apart.\n\n**1. The alleged general economic unity of the transactions concerned**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n150.\n\nAccording to the Majority Decision, \"the Tribunal is convinced that the process of issuing bonds and their circulation on the retail, i.e. financial, markets in the form of security entitlements are to be considered an economic unity and must be dealt with as such a unity for the purpose of deciding whether disputes relating to financial instruments of this kind 'aris[e] directly out of an investment' and are therefore covered by Art. 25 of the ICSID Convention and Art. 1 of the Argentina-Italy BIT\".122\n\nMajority Decision, para. 429.\n\n151.\n\nBy the dogmatic characterization of these two kinds of unconnected factual economic transactions (i.e. Argentina's selling of the bonds in the international primary market and Claimants' purchase of the security entitlements in the in the Italian retail market from Italian banks having acquired the bonds apparently in the international secondary market) taken together as a \"single economic operation\" and the artificial extrapolation to the whole of some ICSID case-law constructions for other situations based upon the concept of the \"general unity of an investment operation\" (essentially, decisions on jurisdiction of *Fedax*, *CSOB*, and *Enron Creditors Recovery*). In this way, the Majority Decision denies altogether the distinctions to be made in the real world, on one hand, between \"bonds\" and \"security entitlements\" and, on another hand, between \"primary market\" and \"Italian retail market\", as different economic and financial realities which in the present case are, further, unconnected with each other.\n\n152.\n\nThe Majority Decision rejects as well the Respondent's submission to the effect that the Claimants lack standing in the present case because *inter alia* their purchases from the Italian banks of the security entitlements concerned were alien and too remote transactions with respect to the Argentine Republic's selling of the bonds in the international primary market. In my opinion, the alien and remoteness arguments, as factual circumstances of the case, are *prima facie* quite convincing and, furthermore, the Claimants failed to prove to my satisfaction that their purchasing of the security entitlements were conceived or perceived at that time by them to conform a \"single economic operation\" or, still less, an \"indivisible whole\" with the selling of the pertinent bonds by Argentina in the primary market or vice versa.\n\n153.\n\nThose kinds of transactions, as well as the social actors, purposes, subject-matters, timing and place of the transactions at stake differ from each other in every respect. Moreover, for reasons explained below, I consider that neither of the two individual components of the so-called \"whole\" could on their own be economic transactions susceptible of being characterized as an \"investment operation\" in the sense of the ICSID Convention and the Argentina-Italy BIT.\n\n154.\n\nThe so-called \"single economic operation\" is in fact affirmed by the Majority Decision without any reference to or assessment of the evidence adduced by the Respondent concerning the process of issuing and circulation of the bonds and without taking into consideration the legal framework and structures of the different sequential transactions at issue. For example, the Tribunal had at its disposal several experts' reports and statements on the mechanism for the issuance and placement, as well as for the circulation and holding of the bonds, submitted by Argentina. *123* This information was generally uncontested by the Claimants. *124* However, there is not apparently a single reference to that evidence in the Majority Decision. The same happens with the Respondent's adduced legal authorities' pronouncements relating to the distinction between \"bonds\" and \"security entitlements\". In this respect, for example, the Majority Decision provides not answer to the question of whether when a \"security entitlement\" is acquired by a holder does the latter \"not take it over from some predecessor in interest, (as purchasers in the direct holding system do), [or] instead, (the) security entitlement is a new item of property, minted just for (the said holder). By the same token, when an entitlement holder liquidates a position with the securities intermediary, the security entitlement is simple extinguished, rather than being transferred to some successor in interest.\" *125*\n\nFor example, Argentina submitted with its Memorial: a Witness Statement of William Burke-White; an Expert Report of Barry J. Eichengreen; a Testimonio de Fed\u00e9rico Molina, a Testimonio de Noemi C. La Greca; and a Witness Statement by Ambassador Mr, Guillermo Nielsen.\n\nClaimants' Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, para. 96.\n\nC. Bjerre and S. Rocks, The ABCs of the UCC: Article 8. Investment Securities, 2nd ed., Chicago, Ill. : Section of Business Law, American Bar Association (2004), at p. 36.\n\n155.\n\nThe distinction between \"bonds\" and \"security entitlements\" is presented by the Majority Decision as mere \"technical nuances\" because in its view \"they make only sense together\". I do not see why this circular argument would make sense either. In fact, the pertinent \"bonds\" and \"security entitlements\" are materially and legally different \"financial products\" issued at different moments of time, in different markets and by two different juridical persons, namely the Argentine Republic for the bonds and the Italian banks for the security entitlements respectively. What happens is that the Majority was in need to invoke something in order to be in the position to reject the Respondent's submission to the effect that the dispute was not \"directly\" related to an investment, otherwise Claimants' case would fall altogether, the latter having admitted that their purchases of the security entitlements from the Italian banks standing alone would not qualified as an \"investment\" under the ICSID Convention and the Argentina-Italy BIT.\n\n156.\n\nThis general description of the circumstances of the present case shows already that they are not similar to the factual and legal environment where the ICSID case-law arbitrators referred to above elaborate the invoked doctrine of the \"general unity of an investment operation\". To begin with, for the proclamation of the \"general unity\" of a given series of transactions, it is a must that, at the least, one or some of those involved be undisputable an \"investment operation\". Then, in the instant case, none of the economic transactions at stake qualified as a protected investment under the ICSID Convention and/or the Argentina-Italy BIT. The proclaimed economic unity of the transactions at stake in the present case affirmed by the Majority Decision has in fact no other basis than the conclusions of the 2011 *Abaclat* decision, namely:\n\n- The bonds at stake were always meant to be divided into smaller negotiable economic values, i.e. securities.\n\n- The underwriters would not have subscribed to any of the bonds, without previously ensured that the bonds were re-sellable to the intermediaries and their end customers.\n\n- The security entitlements are the result of the distribution process of the bonds through their division into a multitude of smaller securities representing each a part of the value of the relevant bond.\n\n- The security entitlements have no value per se, i.e. independently of the bond.\n\n- The fact that the distribution process happens electronically, without the physical transfer of any title, does not change anything to the fact that rights effectively passed on to acquirers of security entitlements in the bonds.126\n\nMajority Decision, para. 424, citing *Abaclat*, *supra* note 4, para. 364).\n\n157.\n\nIt is against this background that, according to the Majority Decision, to split bonds and security entitlements \"into different, only loosely and indirectly connected operations would ignore the economic realities and the very function of the bond issuing process\". The bond issuing State would have assumed, and counted on the fact, that \"persons will purchase shares of the bonds in the secondary market, in the form of security entitlements, since otherwise the bond could not have been successfully issued in the first place\".127 It may be, but there is no evidence adduced in the present case supporting the existence of the alleged connection between the issuance of the bonds by Argentina and the issuance of the security entitlements by the Italian Banks or, for the matter, of the alleged Respondent's assumption at the relevant time. No factual and/or legal causality connection between the issuance of the bonds and the issuance of the security entitlements has been proven by Claimants in the instant proceeding.\n\n*Ibid*, para. 425.\n\n158.\n\nI do not see how the Majority can attribute to the Respondent such an assumption in the light of the evidence submitted by the Parties in the present case. In the first place, the proof that the purchase of the pertinent bonds by the placement banks (or underwriters) in the primary market would constitute an investment under the ICSID Convention has not been administered. Then, as indicated, if such an assumption fails the unity of the purported \"investment operation\" plunges headlong. Moreover, mere *portfolio investments* made by the Claimants in the Italian retail market do not amount, as it will be shown below, to the kind of transactions falling under the jurisdiction of the ICSID Convention either.\n\n159.\n\nFurthermore, the logical possibility of maintaining that *contribution, duration* and *risk* requirements (referred to by *Fedax v. Venezuela* as the basic features of an investment)128 were satisfied is excluded by a fact recognized by Claimants, namely that the underwriters or placement agents would only hold those securities for seconds in the current mechanism for the issuance and circulation of financial instruments. They only acquired or agreed to acquire such bonds when they were certain that they could be sold immediately after the issuance.129 In other words, Claimants cannot argue, on one hand, the unity of a purported \"investment operation\" and, on the other hand, the speeded placement and circulation of the bonds in the markets since *duration* is one of the basic distinguishing features of an \"investment\" under the ICSID Convention.\n\nFedax N.V. v. Republic of Venezuela (ICSID Case No. ARB/96/3), Decision on Objections to Jurisdiction of 11 July 1997 (\"*Fedax*\"), para. 43.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing-Brief, para. 127.\n\n160.\n\nThere are precisely those and others capital market realities which makes me to side with Professor Abi-Saab when in the *Abaclat* case he rejects as \"simplistic\" the affirmation of the majority in that case that the bonds and security entitlements are part of one and the same economic operation when, in fact, everything indicates that one is here in the presence of at least two different markets with different actors and different financial products, as explained masterly in the following crystal-clear paragraphs of Professor Abi-Saab's dissenting opinion :\n\n\"70. The award fails clearly to distinguish between purchases on the primary market, involving the issuer (Argentina) and the first buyers of the issue (the underwriters), and the secondary market, where previously issued securities are trade, without any involvement of the sovereign debtor. An ICSID tribunal cannot look only at the economics of a transaction, without taking into consideration its legal framework and structure, in order to determine whether it qualifies as a protected 'investment' or not.\n\n71. Even from a purely economic point of view (not to mention the legal perspective), the passage from the primary to the secondary market is neither automatic nor certain. The underwriters of the bonds bear the risk of not attracting enough demand, which is one of the reasons why they receive an underwriter spread. Moreover, they may want to keep bonds as part of their portfolio. Similarly, and also from an exclusively economic point of view, the position of Argentina in those two markets is totally different. In the primary market, Argentina received the proceeds of the initial issuance of the bonds from the underwriters. By contrast, the flow of fund triggered by transactions in the secondary market is exclusively between the buyer and the seller of the security entitlements, its volume depending of the conditions prevailing in the market, and bearing no visible relation to the lump-sum received by Argentina from the underwriters at issuance.\n\n72. The Tribunal is thus bound to look at the circumstances of the individual purchases of the security entitlements, and their traceability to - i.e. the strength or tenuousness of their legal *nexus* with - Argentina, before it can decide whether the dispute over each of them 'aris[es] directly out of an investment'; in other words whether they satisfy the requirements of a covered or protected 'investment' under the Convention and the BIT, on which hinges its jurisdiction *ratione materiae*.\"\n\n161.\n\nRegarding the alleged pertinent case-law other than *Abaclat* (2011), the Majority Decision invokes in support of the application of the criterion of the general unity of the purported \"investment operation\" the decisions on jurisdiction of *Fedax* (1997), as well as of *CSOB* (1999) and *Enron Creditors Recovery* (2004), described as the \"jurisprudence\" applicable to the facts of the present case.130 However, in none of these decisions such a criterion was invoked or applied in circumstances similar *mutatis mutandis* to those prevailing in the present case. *Fedax* refers to the criterion as emphasized by the *Holiday Inns v. Morocco* tribunal with respect to \"loan contracts that had their origin in agreements separate from the investment\".131 Moreover, the issue of the relationship between the original Venezuelan holder of the promissory notes and *Fedax* is discussed in the decision with reference to the eventual effects of the \"endorsement\" of the notes and not with respect to the applicability of the investment unity doctrine. *132* Lastly, as rightly underlines by other case-law and doctrine, the *Fedax* decision confused the traditional criterion of \"*risk*\" of the concept of \"investment\" of the ICSID Convention with a different risk, namely the risk for non-performance of the agreement or contract in question by the other partner.\n\nMajority Decision, paras. 426, 427 and 429. I do not consider that the guidance provided by the ICSID arbitral case-law is \"a subsidiary means for the determination of rules of law\" in the sense of the \"judicial decisions\" referred to in Article 38(1)(d) of the Statute of the International Court of Justice.\n\n*Fedax*, *supra* note 128, para. 26.\n\n*Ibid*, paras. 39 and 40.\n\n162.\n\nIn *CSOB*, a case related to the partition of Czechoslovakia and the return to market economy, the Slovak Republic's undertaking and the CSOB loan concerned were considered to form an integrated whole within the process defined in a Consolidation Agreement concluded between the Minister of Finance of the Slovak Republic, the Minister of Finance of the Czech Republic and the commercial bank CSOB, the basic feature of that Agreement being the development of the role and activities of CSOB in both new Republics.133 Moreover, the *CSOB* decision misapplied the traditional criterion of *\"contribution\"* by extending it to the sharing of non-performing receivables. Finally, in *Enron Creditors Recovery* the investment concerned was constituted by an original license on gas transport which evolved over the time and was followed by subsequent agreements on tariffs adjustments concluded between government officials and industry representatives, namely between the parties to the dispute.134 Nothing of that kind occurred in the present case.\n\n*Ceskoslovenska obchodn\u00ed banka, a.s. v. Slovak Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/97/4), Decision on Objections to Jurisdiction of 24 May 1999 (\"*CSOB*\"), paras. 82-91.\n\n*Enron Creditors Recovery*, *supra* note 26, Decision of 30 July 2010 on the Application for Annulment, paras. 3746.\n\n163.\n\nThe above case-law does not provide therefore any basis for the extrapolation to the present case of the criterion of the unity of the \"investment operation\". In fact, there is no room to do so in the instant case because it is not possible to qualify the issuing and circulation of the pertinent bonds as an investment under the ICSID law, unless basic elements of an international investment relationship such as the existence of a \"host State of the investment\" and a \"private foreign investor of the other Contracting Party to the BIT\" are misrepresented, as does the Majority Decision.\n\n**2. The characterization of the affirmed general economic unity of the transactions concerned as an \"investment operation\"**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n164.\n\nWhile invoking \"economic realities\" the Majority Decision tries in fact to replace reality by its own \"virtual constructions\", so as to provide some support for its conclusions. For the Majority, if the issuing and circulation of sovereign bonds in international capital markets do not fit well into one or another aspect of the ICSID investment law, the solution would consist in reformulating the latter so as to present the issuing and circulation of the bonds to be in conformity with its subjective representation of the law.\n\n165.\n\nConcerning, for example, the *nature of the transactions* at stake, the Majority Decision considers without further ado that the Claimants have correctly characterized them as *\"overall loans\"* which made funds available to finance the Respondent's budgetary needs, with each Claimant holding a proportional share of that investment, *135* although the Decision admits also that \"the specific question of the Centre's jurisdiction over loans seems to have been left open\"136at the time of the conclusion of the ICSID Convention. In any case, the characterization by the majority of the pertinent \"sovereign bods\" as \"loans\" and, in turn, \"these loans together\" as an \"investment\" under Article 25(1) of the said Convention finds no support in the most conspicuous authors and arbitral decisions.\n\nMajority Decision, para. 425. In their Post Hearing Brief of 29 March 2011, Claimants recalled: \"that the investment at issue is the overall loans whereby Argentina financed its budgetary needs and which are represented by the bonds issue in respect thereof. The bonds are an indebtedness of Argentina. Each Claimant holds a proportionate share of the initial investment corresponding to the face value of the bonds held by it, plus interests\" (para. 91). In some occasions, Counsel for the Claimants argued that a holder of a security entitlement was in a position *mutatis mutandis* similar to the shareholders with respect to the corporation concerned. I do not share those Claimants' views.\n\nMajority Decision, para. 454.\n\n166.\n\nEven those inclined to subsume the question of the *nature* of the transaction or transactions (regarding the meaning and scope of the term \"investment\" in Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention) under the requirement of the *consent* of the parties (questioning thereby the existence of an objective definition of the term \"investment\") admit that not all \"loans\" qualify as an \"investment\". Delaume, for example, stated that: \"[...] it has been assumed from the origin of the Convention that loans, *or more precisely those of a certain duration as opposed to rapidly concluded commercial financial facilities,* were included in the concept of 'investment'\" *137* (*emphasis supplied*). Likewise, the *Fedax* decision underlines that: \"[...] loans qualify as an investment within ICSID jurisdiction, as does, *in given circumstances,* the purchase of bonds. Since promissory notes are evidence of a loan and a rather a typical financial and credit instrument, there is nothing to prevent their purchase from qualifying as an investment under the Convention *in the circumstances of a particular case such as this*\"138 (*emphasis supplied*).\n\nQuoted in *Fedax*, *supra* note 128, para. 23.\n\n*Fedax*, para. 29.\n\n167.\n\nThus, for *Fedax* the pertinent compromissory notes were a form of \"loan\" or \"credit\" qualified as an investment, but, not every loan or credit would fall for *Fedax* under the category of a protected \"investment\" pursuant to the ICSID Convention. In other words, they may well be loans or credits excluded from that category and being, therefore, mere ordinary commercial transaction(s) even if they could involve a public interest as it would be, for example, the general financing of given State, purpose which should not be confused with loans or credits linked to investments undertakings in the territory of a host State and relating to the economic development of the latter.\n\n168.\n\nIn practice, it appears that ICSID arbitral tribunals have no problem to admit loans within the concept of \"investment\" of the ICSID Convention when the pertinent credit transaction is linked to or has, at the least, some relationship with a present or future economic activity or venture undertaking unfolding in the host State in question. For example, in the *Oko Pankki Oyj and others v. Estonia* case, the tribunal considered that a loan for the funding of a new fishprocessing factory in Tallin (on Estonian territory), by itself, might even arguably be an investment for ICSID Convention purposes, but taken together with the Loan Agreement and (if necessary) the Guarantees, the Loan, as principal part of an overall operation, qualified as an investment under Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention. *139*\n\n*OKO Pankki Oyj and others v. Republic of Estonia* (ICSID Case No. ARB/04/6), Award of 19 November 2007, para. 208.\n\n169.\n\nEven in the case of the arbitral decisions more akin to admit certain \"loans\" under the concept of \"investment\" of the ICSID Convention - as the *Fedax* and *CSOB* decisions - the tribunals take care to underline somehow that the overall operation entailed ultimately some kind of economic activity, works or services in the host State. No economic activity or venture is present at all in the instant case in any territory of any host State *in none of the two components* *(selling of bonds and purchases of security entitlements) of the so-called \"investment operation\".*\n\n170.\n\nIn contrast, the *Fedax* decision takes care in underlining that the \"promissory notes\" concerned were issued under the Law on Public Credit of Venezuela whose terms specifically governed public credit operations aiming at raising funds and resources to undertake, *inter alia,* \"productive works\" and \"contracting for works and services\",140 concluding that, \"given the particular facts of the case the transaction meets the basic features of an investment\", because \"the type of investment involved is not merely a short-term, occasional financial arrangements, such as could happen with investments that come in for quick gains and leave immediately thereafter - i.e. \"volatile capital\".141 In the present case, the Majority Decision by its conclusions on the topic considered allows that volatile capital transactions could be characterized or invoked as \"investments\" under Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention, a retrograde involution indeed in my opinion.\n\n*Fedax*, *supra* note 129, para. 42.\n\n*Ibid*, para. 43.\n\n171.\n\nThe statements of some authors (for example, Mortenson) to the effect that all efforts to eliminate the ICSID Convention's application to bonds, loans and capital flow were rejected are, in my opinion, subject to caution because they frequently ignore the time element in the process of negotiating and drafting the Convention. It is true that some textual suggestions of Philippines, Burundi and Austria aiming at excluding bonds, loans or capital flow (particularly public loans or bonds) from the future convention were not incorporated therein, but the same happened with a statement of Australian aiming at considering them as covered by the future convention.142 The fact is that that numerous attempts to define investments were made during the negotiations, but none was adopted with respect to any transaction and, therefore, the qualification of given loan or bond as an \"investment operation\" pursuant to the ICSID Convention must be subject to the same traditional criteria test that any other form of underlying economic transaction.\n\nMajority Decision, p. 149, footnote 190.\n\n172.\n\nLikewise, statements on the matter or related thereto of Broches and Delaume are frequently quoted without reference to the timing and context in which they were made. For example, when quoted as stating that the *current draft* covered loans, information should be provided enabling the reader ascertaining to what draft are they referring to. It appears that the *first draft* of the Convention contained a definition, quoted in *Fedax,* to the effect that: \"(i) 'investment' means any contribution of money or other asset of economic value for an indefinite period or, if the period is defined, for not less than five years\",143 but this definition was not included in the 1965 ICSID Convention.\n\nQuoted in *Fedax, supra* note 128, para. 23.\n\n173.\n\nThe above considerations advise to distinguish \"loans\" falling either within the \"investment\" Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention and \"loans\" falling outside the outer limits of that conventional provision. Silence on this distinction is but one of the shortcomings in legal analysis of the Majority Decision taken as a whole. I do not consider right to subsume without further ado the \"selling of sovereign bonds\" in international capital markets or mere \"portfolio investments\" in security entitlements as an \"ICSID investments\" in the sense of the 1965 Washington Convention, unless convinced by a legal demonstration which is missing in the Majority Decision.\n\n174.\n\nIn any case, the pertinent sovereign bonds and the security entitlements of this case are financial products distinct from each other as well as, in nature and purpose, from \"promissory notes\" or \"loans\" in the sense that these terms have appeared in *Fedax* or *CSOB* decisions, respectively. The selling or purchasing of these mere financial products being, in the instant case without any relation whatsoever to a genuine ICSID investment aimed at promoting an economic activity or venture in a given host State, they cannot be qualified but as *ordinary commercial transactions* simply because, as rightly stated by Michael Waibel *,* those bonds and security entitlements \"do not display the typical features of an investment\".144\n\nMichael Waibel, \"*Opening Pandora's Box: Sovereign Bonds in International Arbitration*\", 101 *AJIL* (2007, No. 4), pg. 722.\n\n175.\n\nThe need for the Majority Decision to endorse Claimants' arguments as to the qualification of the pertinent sovereign bonds and related security entitlements as \"loans\" and to consider the transactions at stake \"as a whole\" a protected ICSID investment explains itself by the very fact that, as admitted by the Claimants, their purchase in Italy of security entitlements from Italian banks are transactions which being transactions between Italian nationals in Italian territory obviously do not qualify as an \"investment\" under Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention. They fall indeed by that sole feature outside the jurisdiction of the Centre, without prejudice that the transactions in question do not display on their own any of the typical *ratione materiae* features characterising traditionally an investment under the ICSID Convention.\n\n176.\n\nIn such a situation the only possibility for the Claimants to pass the *ratione materiae* jurisdictional test was to link somewhat the Italian transactions on the acquisition of \"security entitlements\" in the Italian retail market to the initial purchase by the banks (underwriters) in the primary capital market of the \"sovereign bonds\" sold by the Argentine Republic, and maintain at the same time, as they did, that such an initial purchase was *indisputably* an investment because \"loans\" would be transactions falling necessarily and without any reservation or caveat under the scope of the term \"investment\" in Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention. The Claimants' Rejoinder did so in the following terms:\n\n\"Simply put, the situation is as follows. The initial purchase by the banks and underwriters of the bonds issued by Argentina is indisputably an investment which satisfies *all requirements* of the definition of investment, in terms of duration, risk, substantial commitment and contribution to the development of Argentina, profits and returns. As permitted by the terms (and as in practically all bond issues), the initial purchaser of the bonds sold them to a vast number of investors on the secondary market, who later may have resold them. The subsequent circulation of the bonds on the secondary market evidently did not deprive the initial 'investment' of its quality, nor did it modify its nature\"145 (*emphasis supplied*).\n\nClaimants' Rejoinder, para. 97.\n\n177.\n\nThis statement calls for some observations. The first is the Claimants' admission thereby that in the ICSID system the term \"investment\" has an objective meaning defined by reference to a certain number of requirements generally recognized as constitutive of the notion of \"investment\" within the system which, as such, operate independently of the parties' consent requirement. In other words, as stated in the Report of the Executive Directors **:** \"[...] consent alone will not suffice to bring a dispute within (the jurisdiction of the Centre). In keeping with the purpose of the Convention, the jurisdiction of the Centre is further limited by reference to the *nature of the dispute and the parties thereto*\"146 (*emphasis supplied*).\n\nExecutive Directors' Report, para. 25.\n\n178.\n\nThus, it should be noted that while Claimants and Respondent argued in the present case on the basis of the existence of an objective definition of \"investment\" in ICSID law, the Majority Decision espouses an extremely subjective approach on the meaning of that term in the ICSID Convention by, first, subsuming it for all practical purposes under the paramount requirement of \"consent\" and, thereafter, interpreting freely (and in my opinion wrongly) the provisions of Article 1(1) of the Argentina-Italy BIT defining, for the purpose of the latter Agreement, the term \"investment\" *.*\n\n179.\n\nThe second observation is that the Claimants' argument hinges upon the assertion that the purchase of the pertinent Argentine bonds by placement banks (or underwriters) in the primary market does qualify as an investment under the ICSID Convention. Then, this proposition is legally untenable because *that purchase of the Argentine bonds does not satisfy either the hard* *core of the objective requirements defining traditionally an \"investment\" under the ICSID Convention, described succinctly as contribution/duration/risk.*\n\n180.\n\nSo far as \"*contribution*\", it is not controversial as between the Parties that the placement banks or underwriters put the money collected by the selling of the sovereign bonds in the primary market at the disposal of Argentina, but not necessarily *in* Argentina's economic activities or ventures and/or *for* the particular purpose of the economic development of Argentina *.147* Concerning \"*duration\"*, as it was already said above, the placement banks (or underwriters) operating in the primary market held only the sovereign bonds for seconds. With respect to \"*risk*\", the Majority Decision confuses (as *Fedax* did before) the operational risk of an investment with the risk of non-performance of the treaty or contract by the other contractual partner. As the UNCITRAL tribunal *Romak v. Uzbekistan* stated:\n\n\"All economic activity entails a certain degree of risk. As such, all contracts - including contracts that do not constitute an investment - carry the risk of non-performance. However, this kind of risk is pure commercial, counterparty risk, or, otherwise stated, the risk of doing business generally. It is therefore not an element that is useful for the purpose of distinguishing an investment and a commercial transaction.\n\nAn 'investment risk' entails a different kind of *alea*, a situation in which the investor cannot be sure of a return on his investment, and may not know the amount he will end up spending, even if all relevant counterparties discharge their contractual obligations. Where there is a 'risk' of this sort, the investor simply cannot predict the outcome of the transaction.\" *148*\n\nThe Claimants holders of the security entitlements did not transfer money into Argentina or put money at the disposal of Argentina in any form at any place.\n\n*Romak S.A. v. The Republic of Uzbekistan* (PCA-UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules), Award of 26 November 2009 (\"*Romak*\"), paras. 229-30.\n\n181.\n\nFor the Majority Decision, the fact that Argentina received a given sum of money by selling the pertinent sovereign bonds in international capital markets for budgetary State's reasons (a general public interest or purpose) appears as having had an unduly determinative role in the qualification of the transactions concerned as ICSID investments. Originating in *Fedax's* erroneous *public interest* test, that criterion is unwarranted.149 Otherwise, every ordinary commercial transaction by a government - by the very fact of being \"governmental\" - would be an \"ICSID investment\", a conclusion manifestly absurd or unreasonable.\n\nWaibel, *supra* note 144, p. 721.\n\n182.\n\nIn any case, one does not find in the Majority Decision any legal or economic analysis on the nature of the initial transaction between the Argentine Republic and the placement banks (or underwriters) allowing the majority to conclude as it does. Even the *Fedax* tribunal noted, as already indicated, that \"bonds\" would qualify as investment in \"given circumstances\"150 only and said nothing about \"sovereign bonds\". As to the latter it should be recalled that \"sovereign bonds\" are public bonds indeed, but not all \"public bonds\" are sovereign bonds a confusion which is not always noted as it should be.\n\n*Fedax*, *supra* note 128, para. 29.\n\n183.\n\nBy issuing and selling in accordance with contemporary international practice, the Argentine Republic created and made circulate in effect *\"financial products\"* of her own as a means of getting in the primary market liquidity for funding the State's general budgetary needs. Once issued, Argentina received the money looked for by selling the said \"product\" to placement banks (or underwriters) who, in turn, resell generally the bonds to other banks or institutions (although the underwriters may keep the bonds or some of them in their own portfolio). The instrument embodying that product called \"sovereign bond\" or \"bond\" has a given nominal value to be reimbursed on maturity, earning interests in the interval.\n\n184.\n\nThe sovereign bonds are certainly documents acknowledging indebtedness by the amount of its nominal value and promising repayment of principal at maturity and interests on an earlier advanced of money by the purchasers, but they are not \"promissory notes\", \"debentures\" or \"certificates of indebtedness\" containing an admission of a debt *to a given lender or lenders*. They are therefore financial products of another kind issued by Governments of sovereign States pursuant to given prospectus which contain detailed information for interested purchasers on various matters, including on risk issues, applicable law and jurisdictional matters.\n\n185.\n\nThus, the documents embodying the sovereign bonds adopt the form of unnamed titles containing the promise to pay to the buyers the agreed interests at intervals and the principal at maturity, and providing for the specific manner of amortizing the issue. These unnamed bonds are susceptible to circulation and appropriation, are negotiable in markets at any moment, and have a variable market value in addition to their fixed nominal value *.*\n\n186.\n\nArgentina participated in the transactions concerning the selling of its sovereign bonds to the placement banks (or underwriters) as a commercial actor. One of the characteristics of the pertinent sovereign bonds being that although issued by a sovereign State, the Argentine Republic in the instant case, the sovereign bonds are governed by the municipal law of a given foreign country and are subject to the jurisdiction of foreign domestic courts of the major financial centres.151\n\nSee, for example, *Payment of Various* *Serbian Loans Issued in France* (Fr. v. Yugo.), 1929 *,* P.C.I.J. (ser. A) No. 20 (July 12), p. 41 *.*\n\n187.\n\nIt follows from the considerations above, that the initial purchase of the pertinent Argentine sovereign bonds by the placement banks (or underwriters) in international capital markets was a mere commercial transaction and not, as concluded by the Majority, a transaction qualifying as an \"investment\" in Argentina pursuant to the ICSID Convention, because to begin with a \"host State\" entity is absent from such a transaction. Neither the Argentine Republic acted as the host State of an investment when selling the sovereign bonds nor, for the matter, the placement banks (underwriters) were acting as foreign private investors in the territory of Argentine when purchasing the sovereign bonds in the primary market.\n\n188.\n\nThe Republic of Argentina was \"hosting\" nothing as a result of the transactions considered, but making a commercial dealing of a financial product of its own outside the Republic in international markets as could be the selling of any other eventual kind of Argentine governmental goods, getting a price in return. Then, the security entitlements holding by the Claimants cannot have acquired as concluded by the majority a non-existent \"investment\" quality of those sovereign bonds, because no one could transfer a better title than what he really has (*nemo dat quod non habet*) as declared by the *Mihaly v. Sri Lanka* tribunal152 and advised by common sense. In the secondary market sovereign bonds are likewise exchanged between buyers and sellers (in wholesale or retail markets) as commercial transactions as well, often at substantial discounts from their face value.153\n\n*Mihaly*, *supra* note 27, para. 24.\n\nMichael Waibel pointed out, with respect to the secondary market for sovereign debts, that the said discounts: \"reflect the likelihood of eventual repayment\" and that \"the rise of secondary markets since 1980 has provided incentives to buy (bonds) below par and pursue litigation for full principal and interests\" (\"*Opening the Pandora's Box...\", supra* note 144, p.722, footnote 71)\n\n189.\n\nIn the instant case, the initial selling and purchase in the primary market of the bonds being a pure commercial transaction concluded between partners acting as commercial actors: (i) the sovereign bonds acquired by and deposited in the Italian banks concerned do not partake of quality of an \"investment\" under the ICSID Convention and, consequently, (ii) the security entitlements in those sovereign bonds they sold in the Italian retail market to the Claimants in the present case are not an \"investment\" pursuant to Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention either.\n\n**3. The concept of \"investment\" in Article 25(1) of the 1965 ICSID Convention and its relevancy for establishing the competence of ICSID arbitral tribunals (the \"doublebarrelled\" test)**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n190.\n\nThe Majority Decision begins by acknowledging that the existence of an \"investment\" within the meaning of Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention \"is a mandatory requirement for the jurisdiction of the Centre, with a request for arbitration transcending these limits leading to the dismissal of the case\".154 Article 25(1) set out therefore some *outer limits* to the jurisdiction of ICSID. It would fallow that any objection to the jurisdiction of the Centre and the competence of the arbitral tribunal concerned must obviously be considered in the light of both Article 25(1) of the Convention and the definition of the term \"investment\" in the pertinent BIT, contract or legislation, Article 1(1) of the Argentina-Italy BIT in the present case (\"*double-barrelled*\" test).\n\nMajority Decision, para. 439.\n\n191.\n\nNotwithstanding this initial presentation, the thrust of the relevant reasoning of the Majority Decision is aimed at excluding altogether any normative effect to the expression \"any legal dispute arising directly out of an investment\" of Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention in the interpretative process of determining whether or not the sovereign bonds and security entitlements at stake constitute protected \"investments\" for in the instant case. For the author of the present Opinion, the term \"investment\" in Article 25(1) has an objective ordinary meaning. The Majority Decision however would leave to the parties to a BIT wide discretion for defining therein the term \"investment\" and that definition of the BIT would prevail in their mutual relations over the ordinary meaning of that term in Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention.\n\n192.\n\nAs stated in one of the conclusions of the Majority Decision: \"There is no need here for the Tribunal to decide the question whether one should go as far as including any 'plausibly economic activity or asset' under the umbrella of Art. 25 of the Convention as long as States are prepared to subject it to ICSID jurisdiction. In fact, there are good reasons to leave a single commercial transaction such as the delivery of a single load of cars outside the concept of investment and thus outside the subject-matter jurisdiction of the Centre\".155 The \"delivery of a single load of cars\" (and so long as it would be \"a single commercial transaction\") is the only example given in the Majority Decision of a economic activity which would qualify as a mere commercial transaction falling as such outside the \"outer limits\" of Article 25 of the ICSID Convention.\n\n*Ibid*, para. 470\n\n193.\n\nAs to the \"good reasons\" for the exclusion of the selling of material products as \"cars\" from the scope of the said Article 25 and, in contrast, for the inclusion therein the selling of financial products as \"sovereign bonds\", the circular reasoning of the Majority Decision reads as follows:\n\n\"Sovereign bonds and security entitlements based thereupon are, however, in no way comparable to single commercial transactions. Notwithstanding the peculiarities of the financial instruments [citation omitted], in the light of the broad understanding to be given to Art. 25 of the ICSID Convention, the Tribunal has no doubt that bonds/security entitlements such as those at stake in the present proceedings fall under the term 'investment' as used in Art. 25 of the Convention.\n\nAccordingly, the Tribunal can see no reason why sovereign bonds/security entitlements should be excluded from the jurisdiction of the Centre and, for that matter, from the competence of this Tribunal, *if and to the extent* that there is evidence that the States parties, i.e. Argentina and Italy, considered those to be investments to be protected, in view of which they both gave their 'advance and irrevocable consent that any dispute (on this basis) may be submitted to arbitration' (Art. 8(3) of the Argentina-Italy BIT. Hence, sovereign bonds/security entitlements are covered by the term 'investment' in Art. 25(1) of the ICSID Convention\"156 (*emphasis supplied*).\n\n*Ibid*, paras. 471-72.\n\n194.\n\nThe Majority Decision adopts therefore in the determination of the scope of the term \"investment\" in Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention the subjectivist theory which, as stated by Emmanuel Gaillard: *\"* merely merges the requisite of investment with the condition of consent\".157 As applied by the Majority Decision, such a method reveals itself in one of its most extreme manifestation, namely as purely subjective and as such impossible to be reconciled with the *effet utile* to be given to the rule in Article 25(1) which commands (*\"shall\")* the existence of a legal dispute \"arising directly out of an investment\".158 As stated in the *Saba Fakes v. Republic of Turkey* award of 14 July 2010:\n\n\"First, the Tribunal considers that the notion of investment, which is one of the conditions to be satisfied for the Centre to have jurisdiction, cannot be defined simply through a reference to the parties' consent, which is a distinct condition for the Centre's jurisdiction. The Tribunal believes that an objective definition of the notion of investment was contemplated within the framework of the ICSID Convention, since certain terms of Article 25 would otherwise be devoid of any meaning\".159\n\nEmmanuel Gaillard, *Identify or Define? Reflections on the Evolution of the Concept of Investment in ICSID Practice*, in International Investment Law for the 21st Century: Essays in the Honour of Christoph Schreuer, (Oxford University Press, 2009), p.410.\n\n*Ibid*, at p. 441. Concerning the adoption of this formula, see Professor Abi-Saab's dissenting opinion in *Abaclat*, *supra* note 37, para. 44\n\n*Saba Fakes v. Republic of Turkey* (ICSID Case No. ARB/07/20), Award of 14 July 2010 (\"*Saba Fakes*\"), para. 108.\n\n195.\n\nThe words \"arising directly out of an investment\" in Article 25(1) bear indeed some meaning. These words cannot be meaningless and a good faith interpretation shall take it into account. Being the subject of an amendment, those words reflect objectively the \"outer limits\" beyond which parties' consent would be ineffective to create an ICSID protected investment. Parties are free to agree on what constitutes an investment in their mutual relations but providing that their definitions fall within \"outer limits\" defined by the ordinary meaning of the term \"investment\" of Article 25(1) in the context of the 1965 ICSID Convention and in the light of its object and purpose.\n\n196.\n\nAs Judge Shahabuddeen has recently recalled that position was accurately defined by the Chairman of the Regional Consultative Meeting of Legal Settlement of Investment Disputes when he reported during the negotiation of the future ICSID Convention, on 9 July 1964, as follows :\n\n\"The purpose of Section 1 is not to define the circumstances in which recourse to the facilities of the Centre would in fact occur, but rather to indicate the outer limits within which the Centre would have jurisdiction provided the parties' consent had been attained. Beyond these outer limits no use could be made of the facilities on the Centre even with such consent\".160\n\nJudge Shahabuddeen's dissenting opinion to the *ad hoc* Committee Decision of 16 April 2009 on the Application for Annulment of the *Malaysian Historical Salvors, SDN, BHD v. Malaysia* (ICSID Case No. ARB/05/10), Award of 17 May 2007 (\"*Malaysian Historical Salvors*\"), para.12 of the Opinion (quotation taken from: ICSID, *History of the ICSID Convention*, *supra* note 61, vol. II-1, p.566, 1958). The majority of the *ad hoc* committee who adopted the subjectivist approach as to the meaning of the term \"investment\" in Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention resorted also to the preparatory work of the Convention, as the present Majority Decision does (para. 57 and ff. of the decision).\n\n197.\n\nEarly commentators have also confirmed the existence of objective outer limits embodied in the ICSID Convention derived from the functions of the terms \"arising directly out of an investment\" in any *bona fide* interpretation of the rule set forth in Article 25(1) of the Convention. For example, Aron Broches in his 1972 lecture at The Hague Academy of International Law after referring to the essential requirement of parties' consent adds the following: \"It goes without saying, however - and I have made this remark before in another connection - that this discretion is not unlimited and cannot be exercised to the point of being *clearly inconsistent with the purpose of the Convention*\"161 (*emphasis supplied*). In the same sense, Christoph Schreuer:\n\n\"There is no doubt that the Centre's services would not be available for just any dispute that the 'parties may wish to submit. (I)t was always clear that ordinary commercial transactions would not be covered by the Centre's jurisdiction [...] The conclusion that the term 'investment' has an objective meaning independent of the parties' disposition is confirmed by Rule 2 of the Institution Rules\".162\n\nRecueil des Cours, 1972 (II), tome 136, p. 362.\n\nChristoph H. Schreuer, Loretta Malintoppi, August Reinish, *The ICSID Convention: A Commentary on the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nations of Other States* (Cambridge University Press, 2nd ed., 2009), p. 117.\n\n198.\n\nThis is also generally the position of the ICSID arbitral tribunals' decisions and commentators relying on an objective concept of the term \"investment\" when the ICSID Convention was adopted in 1965. As explained by Emmanuel Gaillard:\n\n\u00ab Traditionnellement, la controverse sur la notion d'investissement au sens de l'article 25 (1) de la Convention de Washington se pr\u00e9sente de la fa\u00e7on suivante. M\u00eame lorsqu'elle se pr\u00e9occupe des nouvelles formes d'investissement, la doctrine classique d\u00e9finit l'investissement comme 'un apport dont la r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration est diff\u00e9r\u00e9e dans le temps et fonction des r\u00e9sultats entrepris' [....] Trois \u00e9l\u00e9ments sont donc requis : l'apport, la dur\u00e9e et le fait que l'investisseur supporte, au moins en partie, les al\u00e9as de l'entreprise [...] Dans une telle conception, un simple pr\u00eat dont la r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration ne d\u00e9pend en rien du succ\u00e8s de l'entreprise ne peut \u00eatre qualifi\u00e9 d'investissement. Certains auteurs ont propos\u00e9 des d\u00e9finitions moins exigeantes de la notion d'investissement \u00bb.163\n\nEmmanuel Gaillard, La jurisprudence du CIRDI (ICSID Case Law), Pedone Paris 2004, p. 479.\n\n199.\n\nMichael Waibel is quite right when in a lapidary manner he stated that: \"Article 25's definition of investment is not infinitively elastic\",164 and more recently: \"The inclusion of the term investment in Article 25 implies that ICSID subject matter jurisdiction is limited. The term investment has a distinct meaning, which can be derived from the ordinary meaning of investment, preparatory works, subsequent practice, arbitral awards and doctrine. The tribunal's jurisdiction cannot be engaged whenever the parties so desire. ICSID jurisdiction has 'outer limits'\".165 I share the views above, as well as the following from Zachary Douglas *:*\n\n*\"* (t)he term 'investment'...is a term of art: its ordinary meaning cannot be extended to bring any rights having an economic value within its scope, for otherwise violence would be done to that ordinary meaning in contradiction to Article 31 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties \".166\n\nWaibel, \"Opening Pandora's Box: Sovereign Bonds in International Arbitration\", *supra* note 144, p. 711 at p. 722.\n\nMichael Waibel, *Sovereign Defaults before International Courts and Tribunals*, (Cambridge University Press, 2011), p. 212.\n\nZachary Douglas, *The International Law of Investment Claims*, (Graduate Institute of International Studies, Geneva, 2009), para. 342.\n\n200.\n\nThose statements find general supported in the ICSID case-law. For instance, the *Joy Mining* tribunal (presided by the same person as *Fedax*) declared in 2004 that the freedom of the parties to define an investment is not unlimited and that: \"The parties to a dispute cannot by contract or treaty define as investment, for the purpose of the ICSID jurisdiction, something which *does not satisfy the objective requirement of Article 25 of the Convention.* Otherwise Article 25 and its reliance on the concept of investment, even if not specifically defined, would be turned in a meaningless provision\"167 (*emphasis supplied*). The unanimously adopted 2009 award in *Phoenix Action v. Czech Republic* summarizes the legal situation with precision *:*\n\n\"There is nothing like a total discretion, even if the definition developed by the ICSID case law is quite broad and encompassing. There are indeed some basic criteria and parties are not free to decide in BITs that anything [...] is an investment\".168\n\n*Joy Mining Machinery Limited v. Arab Republic of Egypt* (ICSID Case No. ARB/03/11), Award of 6 August 2004 (\"*Joy Mining*\"), para. 50.\n\n*Phoenix Action Ltd v. Czech Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/06/5), Award of 15 April 2009 (\"*Phoenix Action*\"), para. 82.\n\n201.\n\nThe objective limits introduced in Article 25(1) by the insertion of the term \"investment\" have also been declared in clear terms by ICSID *ad hoc* committees on applications for annulment. For example, in the following passage of the decision of the *ad hoc* committee in the *Patrick Mitchell v. Democratic Republic of Congo* annulment proceedings:\n\n\"[...] the parties to an agreement and the States which conclude an investment treaty cannot open the jurisdiction of the Centre to any operation they might arbitrarily qualify as an investment. It is thus repeated that before ICSID arbitral tribunals, the Washington Convention has supremacy over an agreement between the parties or a BIT\".169\n\n*Patrick Mitchell v. Democratic Republic of the Congo* (ICSID Case No. ARB/99/7), Decision on the application for annulment of 1 November 2006, para. 31.\n\n202.\n\nIt is true that during the elaboration of the ICSID Convention several definitions of \"investment\" were considered and rejected, but it does not allow to consider such a definitional silence of the Convention as if the term \"investment\" would be meaningless in Article 25(1) or the notion be so elastic as to deprive it of any legal effect, as does in fact the Majority Decision. As rightly put by Michael Waibel *\"the failure to reach consensus* cannot be used to adopt a broad notion by *default*\" (*emphasis in original*) and, further: \"Putting exclusive weight on BIT consent deprives Article 25 of its core purpose\".170\n\nWaibel, \"Opening the Pandora's Box...\", *supra* note 144, p. 730.\n\n203.\n\nIt is evident that reading away Article 25's investment requirement is at odds with the treaty interpretation rules of the VCLT which are based on the principle that the text must be presumed to be the authentic expression of the intention of the parties and which incorporate also the principle of \"effective interpretation\" *(effet utile)* under the control of good faith and the object and purpose of the treaty subject to the interpretation. As explained by Professor Abi-Saab in his dissenting opinion in 2011 *Abaclat* decision, the term \"investment\" in Article 25(1) \"whilst flexible enough is not infinitely elastic\" it has a \"hard-core\" which should be identified looking into the general context of the ICSID Convention and the circumstances surrounding its elaboration as well as to its object and purpose\" (paras. 46 and 47 of the Opinion), and further :\n\n\"48. It is most significant that the ICSID Convention and the Centre established on the initiative and within the framework of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development; an institution which concentrated its activities since the early sixties almost exclusively to the second facet of its mandate to its title, i.e. the \"development\" of the less developed countries.\"\n\n204.\n\nThe considerations and comments above need to be recalled because the Majority Decision's initial reference to the \"double-barrelled\" test vanishes soon. It admits that Article 25(1) \"opens the general scope of the term 'investment' up to the possibility of restriction\".171 But, for the Majority Decision such restriction refers essentially back to the scope of the consent of the parties as expressed in the BIT, not to a sensible objective hard-core of the investment requirement of Article 25(1). The label by the parties to the BIT of the transaction concerned as \"investment\" would be for the Majority Decision the determinative factor.\n\nMajority Decision, para. 454.\n\n205.\n\nThis pure subjective approach of the Majority Decision is difficult to reconcile with the specific language of Article 25(1) (\"any legal dispute arising directly out of an investment\") because as mentioned, for instance, in a no suspected decision for the subjectivists as the 1999 *CSOB v. Slovak Republic* :\n\n\"The Slovak Republic *is correct in pointing out,* however, that an agreement of the parties describing their transaction is not, as such conclusive in resolving the question whether the dispute involves an investment under Article 25(1) of the Convention. The concept of an investment as spelled out in that provision is *objective in nature* in that the parties may agree on more precise or restrictive definition of their acceptance of the Centre's jurisdiction, but they may not choose to submit disputes to the Centre that are not related to an investment. A two-fold test must therefore be applied in determining whether this Tribunal has the competence to consider the merits of the claim **:** whether the dispute arises out of an investment within the meaning of the Convention and, if so, whether the dispute relates to an investment as defined in the Parties' consent to ICSID arbitration, in their reference to the BIT and the pertinent definitions contained in Article 1 of the BIT\"172 (*emphasis supplied*).\n\n*CSOB*, *supra* note 133, para. 68.\n\n206.\n\nI reject the limitless subjectivist Majority Decision's approach regarding the meaning and scope of the investment requirement of Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention as contrary to the text of the provision and a good faith interpretation and application of that conventional rule. Likewise, I reject the particular conclusion of the Majority Decision to the effect that the selling of the sovereign bonds by the Argentine Republic and the purchasing of the security entitlements by the Claimants are transactions which, either individually or together, pass the investment requirement of Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention and, as such, the first component of the \"*double-barrelled*\" test.\n\n207.\n\nThose transactions are not by its very nature ICSID protected investments because they do not meet the objective basic criteria for identifying an investment appurtenant to Article 25(1), as interpreted generally by most of ICSID arbitral decisions and academic commentators.173 The objective elements of \"*investmentness*\" that an activity must have to qualify as an ICSID investment are missed in the transactions at stake in the present case.\n\nSee, for example, R. Dolzer and C. Schreuer, *Principles of International Investment Law* (Oxford University Press, 2nd ed., 2012), at pp. 68 and 69.\n\n208.\n\nMoreover, contrary to the relevant conclusion of the Majority Decision, Argentina and Italy did not decide in their 1990 BIT that the sovereign bonds and security entitlements in question were \"investments\", as the term is defined in Article 1(1) of the BIT (see below). The text of this definition does not provide either support for the Majority Decision's upholding of the present Tribunal's competence to know and adjudicate the instant case, as instituted by the Claimants, because as stated in the 2004 *Joy Mining* award:\n\n\"The parties to a dispute cannot by contract or treaty define as investment, for the purpose of ICSID jurisdiction, something which does not satisfy the objective requirements of Article 25 of the Convention. Otherwise Article 25 *and its reliance on the concept of investment,* even if not specifically defined, would be turned into a meaningless provision\"174 (*emphasis* *supplied*).\n\n*Joy Mining*, *supra* note 167, para. 50.\n\n209.\n\nI will add to conclude on the \"*double-barrelled*\" test by recalling that such a test is not an exceptional feature of the ICSID law. In international law is rather the general rule in institutionalized arbitration and judicial settlement. For example, in the ICJ the determination of the jurisdiction of the Court in a given case entails to pass the test of both the provisions of its Statute on the competence of the Court (Articles 34-38) as well as of the relevant provisions of the title or titles of jurisdiction invoked.\n\n**4. The determination of the ordinary meaning of the term \"investment\" in Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention by application of the rules of international law on interpretation of treaties codified by the VCLT**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**(a) The recourse by the Majority Decision to the supplementary means of interpretation of treaties of Article 32 of the VCLT**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n210.\n\nThe Majority Decision begins the interpretation of Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention by considering the \"background of the adoption\" of that provision, namely by the *travaux* *pr\u00e9paratoires.* The aim of this rather heterodox application of the treaty interpretation system of the Vienna Convention seems: (i) to provide from the outset of the interpretation process support to wide as much as possible the *concept of \"investment\"* of the ICSID Convention (practically without any objective normative limitation); and (ii) to avoid entering into the troublesome *temporal element* question of the prevailing *economic development* sense of the ordinary meaning of the term \"investment\" in the decade of the sixties (over the current meaning in a *financial* sense).\n\n211.\n\nThe Majority Decision's early recourse to the *travaux* comes nevertheless as a surprise because neither the issuance of sovereign bonds nor the sovereign default problems was a subject-matter of consideration within the framework of the negotiations leading to the elaboration of the ICSID Convention. Moreover, *practice* confirms that since the entering into force of the ICSID Convention on 14 October 1966 until the *Abaclat* case instituted on 14 September 2006, namely during forty years, no \"sovereign bonds\" subject to a sovereign debt restructuring consequential from a State's declaration of sovereign default in a situation of economy emergency (or, for the matter, of \"security entitlements\") have been the subject-matter of any instituted ICSID case. Thus, the general messages sent by the *travaux,* as well as by *general ICSID practice,* excludes from the purview of the ICSID Convention of both \"sovereign bonds\" and \"security entitlements\" in sovereign bonds.\n\n212.\n\nIn any case, the Majority Decision's early recourse to a \"supplementary means\" of interpretation as the *travaux* of the ICSID Convention cannot go unnoticed. It obliges to recall in the first place that the term \"supplementary\" emphasizes that Article 32 of the VCLT does not provide, as stated in the commentary of the International Law Commission, \"for alternative, autonomous, means of interpretation but only for means to aid an interpretation governed by the principles contained in Article 31\" of the VCLT.175 And secondly that as explained in the same commentary:\n\n\"The elements of interpretation in Article 31 all relate to the agreement between the parties *at the time when or after it received authentic expression in the text. Ex hypothesi* this is not the case with preparatory work which does not, in consequence, have the same authentic character as an element of interpretation, however valuable it may sometimes be in throwing light on the expression of the agreement in the text. Moreover, it is beyond question that the records of the treaty negotiations are in many cases incomplete or misleading, so that considerable discretion has to be exercised in determining their value as an element of interpretation\".176\n\nReport of the United Nations Conference on the Law of Treaties, First and Second Sessions, Vienna, 26 March-24 May 1968 and 9 April-22 May 1969, Documents of the Conference (United Nations publication, Sales No. E.70.V.5) (\"*UN Publication on the Law of Treaties*\"), p. 43, para. 19.\n\n*Ibid*, p. 40, at para. 10.\n\n213.\n\nFurthermore, as presented by the Majority Decision, namely without any precise referential context or sequence, the *travaux* referred to often appear contradictory with each other or with commentaries thereon. For instance, to mention in isolation that an Australian delegate highlighted in 1964 that at that time a \"draft \" seemed to include \"borrowing of cash by the host country from foreign private investor\" is, without further ado, of no help to interpret Article 25 of the 1965 ICSID Convention. The same may be said of Austria's submission that \"public loans and bonds should not be included\" in the Convention or that Burundi statement that money lent by a foreign company to a State could not be regarded as an investment.177\n\n*See*, Majority Decision, footnote 190; and Waibel, \"*Opening the Pandora's Box...*\", *supra* note 144, at p. 720, footnote 61.\n\n214.\n\nRegarding commentaries on the *travaux,* the Majority Decision quotes two statements by Broches that, out of context, appear contradictory with each other. According to the first statement \"the requirement that the dispute must have arisen out of an 'investment' may be merged into the requirement of consent to jurisdiction\".178 By contrast, in another quoted statement, Broches said that: \"Presumably, the parties' agreement that a dispute is an 'investment dispute' will be given great weight in any determination of the Centre's jurisdiction, *although it*  *would not be controlling*\"179 (*emphasis supplied*).\n\nMajority Decision, p. 148, footnote 185 citing A. Broches, The Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes: Some Observations on Jurisdiction, 5 Columbia Journal of Transnational Law (1966), 261, at 268.\n\n*Ibid*, p. 148, footnote 187.\n\n215.\n\nThe Majority Decision concludes that \"the *consent of the parties* as to the scope of the term 'investment' is to be deemed \"of great relevance when establishing the meaning of Art. 25 of the ICSID Convention *without the concept thus becoming subject to the parties' unfettered*  *discretion*\"180 (*emphasis supplied*). However, no objective legal content is given to the cosmetic caveat of the \"unfettered discretion\" (expression taken from other ICSID arbitral decisions) which would be powerless in face of the parties' mutual consent. In any case, the said \"unfettered discretion\" does not appear to operate as a normative legal limit of any kind on what is for the Majority Decision an all-encompassing meaning of the term \"investment\" in Article 25(1) of the Convention, leading it to conclude that the pertinent sovereign bonds and security entitlements fall within the concept of \"investment\" of the ICSID Convention.\n\n*Ibid*, para. 452.\n\n216.\n\nThe author of the present Opinion is of a different view. For him the term \"investment\" in the Article 25(1) had at the time of elaboration of the ICSID Convention an objective hard-core or intrinsic ordinary meaning intended by the negotiating States whose component elements have been identified by ICSID decisions and commentators, meaning which cannot be waived even by the agreement of given by parties to a BIT or in another form. Then, that hard-core or intrinsic ordinary meaning (as will be seen below) excludes that the pertinent sovereign bonds and security entitlements at stake in the present case may be characterized as an \"investment\" in the sense the Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention.\n\n217.\n\nThe early consideration by the Majority Decision of the *travaux* also has the additional purpose of eroding further any objective concept of the term \"investment\" by insisting that in the course of elaboration of the ICSID Convention the main compromise would have been constituted, on one hand, by a bare use of the term \"investment\" in Article 25(1) with no, or only very weak, limits as to the jurisdiction *ratione materiae* of the Centre (to satisfy the capitalexporting States' position) and, on the other hand, the establishment of a mechanism in Article 25181 by which States could withhold matters from the jurisdiction of the ICSID which they considered inappropriate to be dealt with by this institution (to satisfy capital-importing State' position).182 In other words, the general view of the majority is that the ICSID as an institution would enjoy an all-encompassing *ratione materiae* jurisdiction, unless States contracted-out by notifying the Centre the class or classes of disputes which it would or would not consider submitted to the jurisdiction of the Centre.\n\n*Ibid*, paras. 449-51.\n\n*Ibid*, para. 451.\n\n218.\n\nAs evidence of the so-called \"trade-off\" above, the majority quotes paragraph 27 of the Report of the Executive Directors of the ICSID Convention which expressly links the lack of a definition of \"investment\", first, to the \"essential requirement of consent by the parties\" and, second, to the mechanism of Article 25(4) of the Convention.183 Without denying that passage of the Executive Director's Report or the right to invoke it, I must say that for the general rule of interpretation of treaties of Article 31 of the VCLT the *intention* behind the \"trade-off\" invoked by the Majority Decision would be relevant only to the extent it finds expression in the text of the ICSID Convention, but not beyond or otherwise. Moreover, the published history of the ICSID Convention provides conclusive evidence that contrary to what it is stated in the said paragraph of the Executive Director's Report there were several attempts during the negotiations to define the term \"investment\" in Article 25(1).\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n219.\n\nThen, I have to confess that I do not see such expression reflected, by cross-references or otherwise, in the text of any of the paragraphs of Article 25 or in any other provision of the ICSID Convention, preamble included. Furthermore, they are surely several other trade-offs or understandings reached likewise during the negotiation and drafting process of the ICSID Convention which are not referred to at all in the Majority Decision which once more is quite selective in its references to *travaux*, arguments and evidence. For example, in paragraph 25 of the same Executive Directors' Report one may read the following:\n\n\"While consent of the parties is an essential prerequisite of the jurisdiction of the Centre, consent alone will not suffice to bring a dispute within its jurisdiction. *In keeping with the purpose of the Convention,* the jurisdiction of the Centre is further limited by reference to *the nature of the dispute* and the parties thereto\" (*emphasis supplied*).\n\n220.\n\nThus, Article 25(4) notwithstanding, the *nature of the dispute* remains quite essential for the interpretation of the expression \"any legal dispute arising directly out of an investment\" in Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention. Second, the text of Article 25 as a whole does not provide a contextual basis allowing the interpreter to reasoning as if the addition to Article 25(4) would deprive of its meaning and normative role the term \"investment\" of paragraph 1. Third, the need to interpret the latter term - in the context of the ICSID Convention as a whole and in the light of its object and purpose - cannot be avoided by invoking the possibility for States of making notifications excluding a given \"class or classes of disputes\", because non-excluded class or classes of legal disputes must likewise arise \"directly out of an investment\" to be in conformity with Article 25(1). Fourth, in the present case neither Argentina nor Italy made declarations pursuant to Article 25(4) excluding any class or classes of legal disputes otherwise admitted by the ICSID Convention. In conclusion, Article 25(1) includes some legal disputes and excludes other disputes and Article 25(4) allows Contracting States to exclude a class or classes from the legal disputes included.\n\n221.\n\nFor an interpretation of the term \"investment\" in Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention, the more relevant *travaux* are *,* in my opinion, those relating specifically to the successive formulations proposed for paragraph 1 of that Article and the discussion relating thereto, as recorded in the publication entitled *History of the ICSID Convention*. Then, those *travaux* curiously enough, are missing from the Majority Decision. However, there is some information thereon in the documentation referred to the Tribunal by the Parties revealing a certain interest of those *travaux* for some aspects of the interpretation of Article 25(1) for confirmation purposes.\n\n222.\n\nFor instance, in paragraph 23 of the 1997 *Fedax* decision it is said that in a first draft of the future convention it was provided for the purpose of the chapter concerned that: \"(i) 'investment' means any contribution of money or other asset of economic value for an indefinite period or, if the period be defined, for not less than five years\". A definition of this kind would have included \"loans\" but not every form of loans, only those having a given duration. This provision disappeared in the course of the negotiations, but it is a good example of the eventual interest of the *travaux* for an interpretation of Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention as a supplementary means.\n\n223.\n\nProfessor Abi-Saab's dissenting opinion, referred to the Tribunal, does provide for a number of the most relevant information on the *travaux* leading to the very adoption of the text of Article 25(1). Then, this information reveals *\"the limiting or restricting intent behind the*  *introduction and further qualification of the term 'investment' in the provision\"*.184 As explained by Professor Abi-Saab, this was done in response to concerns about the over-broad jurisdiction *ratione materiae* of certain drafts *.* Initially one working paper simply referred to \"disputes\". Then, a preliminary draft introduced the term \"investment\" as a qualifier before \"disputes\" in defining the ambit of jurisdiction (any existing or future *investment* dispute of a legal nature). This was further narrowed in another draft as follows: \"all legal disputes [...] arising out of or in connection with any investment\". But, this latter formula was still strongly attacked as too wide, particularly the clause \"in connection with\" (which was struck out by a vote of 26 to 8), while adding the qualifier \"directly\" into the second (revised) draft that became the actual formula: \"any legal dispute arising *directly* out of an investment\".185\n\nProfessor Abi-Saab's dissenting opinion in *Abaclat*, *supra* note 37, para. 43.\n\n*Ibid*, para. 44.\n\n224.\n\nThus, as concluded by Professor Abi-Saab: (i) *the purpose of using the term investment in* *Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention was to set objective outer-limits to the types of disputes* *that can be treated within ICSID* ; (ii) the said outer-limits bound a vast ambit; and (iii) but they exist all the same.186 This is frequently reiterated in ICSID case-law and by commentators. For example the 2003 *SGS v. Pakistan* decision acknowledges that the ICSID Convention leaves to the Contracting Parties \"a large measure of freedom to define (the) term (\"investment\") as their specific objectives and circumstances may lead them to do so\", but this is qualified by the following statement:\n\n\"That freedom does not, however, appear to be unlimited, considering that 'investment' may well be regarded as embodying certain core meaning which distinguishes it from an 'ordinary commercial transaction' such as a simple, stand alone, sale of goods or services\".187\n\n*Ibid*, para. 45.\n\n*SGS Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale de Surveillance S.A. v. Islamic Republic of Pakistan* (ICSID Case No. ARB/01/13), Decision on Objections to Jurisdiction of 6 August 2003 (\"*SGS v.Pakistan*\"), para. 133 and footnote 153.\n\n225.\n\nIn sum, the early appeal by the Majority Decision to supplementary means of interpretation as the *travaux* of the ICSID Convention ends finally in the confirmation that the insertion of the term \"investment\" in Article 25(1) of the Convention was intended to distinguish the transactions to be protected by the ICSID system established by the 1965 Convention from other transactions, named \"ordinary commercial transactions\", which will remain under the protection granted by customary international law exclusively. The term \"investment\" was considered flexible enough so as to providing a wide margin for further specification by States, but not as infinitely elastic to the point of confusing an \"investment\" with an \"ordinary commercial transaction\".\n\n226.\n\nThis conclusion is enough to refute the opinion that there is no need for the present claims to be submitted to a \"double-barrelled\" test, namely to the ICSID and the BIT test. For the author of the present Opinion that double test entails in the present case - as it is common ground between the Parties - that the competence of the present Tribunal is contingent upon the fulfilment of the objective jurisdictional requirements of both the ICSID Convention and the Argentina-Italy BIT, the jurisdiction *ratione materiae* of the Tribunal resting - to use the language of the 2009 *Phoenix Action* Award - in the *intersection* of the two definitions.188\n\n*Phoenix Action*, *supra* note 168, para. 74.\n\n**(b) The ordinary meaning of the term \"investment\" in Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention ascertained by the application of the general rule of interpretation of treaties of Article 31 of the VCLT and the so-called \"*****Salini\"*** **test**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n227.\n\nAfter having opening the game with the *travaux,* the Majority Decision in its hesitating reasoning on the meaning of \"investment\" in Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention admits that its previous remarks on the *travaux* and the alleged intentions of the parties \"must not lead to an outcome deviating from the interpretation\" of Article 25 in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in the light of its object and purpose (Article 31 of the VCLT), even if indicated otherwise by the historical background.189\n\nMajority Decision, para. 455.\n\n228.\n\nSo far so good. I cannot but be in agreement with that statement. But then why so much noise on the \"trade-off\" and underlying alleged intentions of the drafters of the 1965 ICSID Convention? In any case, according to the rules of international law codified in Article 31- 33 of the VCLT, a treaty interpretation must proceed from the *ordinary meaning* of the terms, even if the interpreter does not like that meaning, and parties' intention are relevant to the extent that it finds expression in the text of the treaty or necessarily implied therein, but not beyond or otherwise. These rules of international law are duty-bound for international courts and tribunals, including ICSID tribunals, which are not supposed to deviate from them in the course of their application to the cases submitted to their consideration. *Pacta sunt servanda* is here at stake.\n\n229.\n\nAs a consequence of the overall subjectivist view adopted by the Majority Decision, the latter is unable to conclude at any given *ordinary meaning* of the term \"investment\" in Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention, beyond the quite general and flawed affirmation -advanced on the basis of alleged dictionary definitions - that the term \"does certainly not restrict the scope of the notion so as to exclude bonds and security entitlements such as the ones pertinent to this case from its purview, but is rather susceptible to include those financial instruments\".190 And, further, that even endorsing the Professor Amerasinghe's caveat that dictionary definitions may be irrelevant for the purpose of defining \"investment\" in Article 25(1), this argument would not result for the Majority Decision in the opposite conclusion, namely that bonds and security entitlements are *not* covered by the ordinary meaning, but would rather suggest that the term is \"ambiguous\" in the sense of Article 32 of the VCLT or that it has been given \"a special meaning [...] if it is established that the parties so intended\" (Article 31(4) of VCLT).191\n\n*Ibid*, para. 456.\n\n*Ibid*, p. 151, footnote 194.\n\n230.\n\nNo more effort is made by the Majority Decision with a view to ascertaining the \"ordinary meaning\" of the term \"investment\" in Article 25(1) ICSID Convention through the application as relevant of all component interpretative elements of the general rule of interpretation of treaties of Article 31 of the VCLT which - it should be recalled - \"form a single, closely integrated rule\" to be applied in a process of interpretation conceived as \"a unity\".192\n\nUN Publication on the Law of Treaties, *supra* note 175, p. 39, para. 8.\n\n231.\n\nThe relevant passages of the Majority Decision are indeed very poor. For example - after paying lip services to the method of systematic interpretation - the only role given in the interpretation to the *context* consists in sending the reader back to the majority's assessment of the *travaux* of the Convention *,* namely to the alleged \"trade-off\" referred to above.193 But, the *travaux* have no role to play in an application of the general rule of interpretation of treaties. \"Context\" is indeed an element of that general rule, but it relates - as all the other elements constituting the general rule of Article 31 - to the agreement between the parties *at the time when or after it received authentic expression in the text* (not to one or more \"trade-off\" or dealings during the negotiation or drafting phases of the treaty).194 In contrast, several elements of the VCLT \"context\" (Article 31(2)) play no role at all in the reasoning of the Majority Decision.\n\nMajority Decision, para. 457.\n\nUN Publication on the Law of Treaties, *supra* note 175, p. 40, para. 10.\n\n232.\n\nOn the basis of the textual \"context\" defined by Article 31(2) of the VCLT and other elements of Article 31 there is no ground for concluding, as the Majority Decision does, that the very existence of the notification mechanism of Article 25(4) of the ICSID Convention would militate for a \"broad\" interpretation of the concept of investment in Article 25(1) subject to the possibility of subsequent restriction by the parties\".195 Article 25(4) is certainly \"context\" for the interpretation of terms in Article 25(1), but the actual wording of the former does not convey a broad or narrow intent as to the use of the term \"investment\" in the latter. There is no crossreference or any other textual or necessary implied indication to that effect in none of these two paragraphs of Article 25 or, for the matter, in any other provision of that Article or of the ICSID Convention. Paragraphs 1 and 4 of Article 25 of the Convention deal with a different subject-matters and each is formulated in a self-contained way.\n\nMajority Decision, para. 457.\n\n233.\n\nAs to the *object and purpose* of the ICSID Convention, the Majority Decision begins indicating that \"the situation is less clear\" than in the case of the context because the first preamble paragraph of the ICSID Convention \"*may well be understood in different ways*\".196 Why? In fact, the first paragraph of the Preamble is quite clear underlining the \"need for *international cooperation for economic development,* and the role of private international investment therein\"; the second one reminds \"the possibility that from time to time *disputes may arise in connection with such investments* between Contracting States and nationals of other Contracting States; and the third recognizes \"that while *such disputes* would usually be subject to national legal processes, international methods of settlement may be appropriate in certain cases\" (*emphasis supplied*).\n\n*Ibid*, para. 458.\n\n234.\n\nIn the light of the clearness of the Preamble, the explanations of the Executive Directors' Report (paragraphs 9, 11, 12 and 13) and the aggregate of the relevant ICSID case-law and related doctrinal commentaries, there are no objective grounds for the Majority Decision's inconclusive finding on the object and purpose of the ICSID Convention. Once more, the only explanation for the alleged inconclusiveness is the subjectivist unilateral vision of the Majority Decision, and the shadow projected thereon by *Abaclat* majority decision criticised on the point by Professor Abi-Saab in his dissenting opinion as follows:\n\n\"157. [...] the reasoning is also premised on and proceeds from a purely subjective, truncated and partial representation of the object and purpose of the ICSID Convention and the BIT, [...] the object and purpose of these two treaties are described as being exclusively to afford maximum protection to foreign investment and foreign investors; as if these treaties were 'unilateral contracts' creating rights for the benefit of one party only. In consequence, according to this vision, all the provisions of these treaties have to be interpreted exclusively with this aim in mind.\n\n158. Viewed from this perspective, all the limitations to the jurisdiction of ICSID tribunals, whether inherent or patiently and carefully negotiated and stipulated in the treaty to protect the interests of the State party (which are after all, the collective interest of its population) are seen as obstacles in the way of achieving the 'purpose' of the treaties, which have to be overcome at any price and by whatever argument\".\n\n235.\n\nThe unilateral vision of the Majority Decision is indeed in stark contrast to the object and purpose of the ICSID Convention, *as clearly explained in the above mentioned paragraphs of the Report of the Executive Directors* as, for example, in the following one:\n\n\"While the broad objective of the Convention is to encourage a larger flow of private international investment, the provisions of the Convention *maintain a careful balance between the interest of investors and those of host States*. Moreover, the Convention permits the institution of proceedings by host States as well as by investors and the Executive Directors have constantly in mind that the provisions of the Convention should be equally adapted to the requirements of both cases\"197 (*emphasis supplied*).\n\nReport of Executive Directors, para. 13.\n\n236.\n\nNotwithstanding the above consideration, the Majority Decision finds soon *a way* to clear out the object and purpose of the ICSID Convention under the form of the following amazing \"tentative conclusion\":\n\n\"[\u2026] the Tribunal would [...] resist to endorse an overly narrow reading of the term 'investment' in Art. 25(1) of the Convention. In particular, the Tribunal would like to caution against a restrictive reading of the jurisdictional provisions of the ICSID Convention which does not find its base in the Convention itself, but rather draws on concerns regarding the ability, and appropriateness, of arbitral tribunals to tackle difficulties relating to the substantive side of the case. This is a question to be dealt with on the level of the merits, but should not lead tribunals to decline to hear cases in 'anticipatory obedience' to real or imagine constituencies\"198.\n\nMajority Decision, para. 460.\n\n237.\n\nThis \"tentative conclusion\", inserted in the middle of the Majority Decision's consideration on the role of the *object and purpose* element in the interpretation of the term \"investment\" in Article 25(1) of the Convention does not make sense and cannot be allowed either to get lost without a commentary. First, nobody asked in the present case for an \"overly narrow\" reading of the term \"investment\" in Article 25(1), but for the intrinsic ordinary meaning of that term at the time of the conclusion of the ICSID Convention ascertaining through the application of the general rule of interpretation of treaties of Article 31 of the VCLT.\n\n238.\n\nSecond, my refute of the main conclusions of the Majority Decision in the present context have nothing to do with the alleged difficulties of the substantive aspects of the case, but with *pacta sunt servanda* and the customary international law rule of Sate's consent to the jurisdiction of international courts and tribunals (ICSID arbitral tribunals included), as well as with the correct application of the rules of international law codified by the VCLT governing the interpretation of treaties.\n\n239.\n\nLastly, it makes little sense, to say the least, to extrapolate into considerations relating to the object and purpose of the ICSID Convention duly fixed by the Contracting States in 1965, personal doctrinal comments or views (sometimes of *lege ferenda*) in contemporary publications regarding the understanding and/or performance by ICSID arbitral tribunals of their respective tasks.199\n\n*Ibid*, p. 153, footnote 203.\n\n240.\n\nFollowing the above incisory \"tentative conclusion\", the Majority Decision goes on to indicate that the Tribunal \"would concede that a restrictive reading is required *if the consent given by a State* indicates that certain types of investment should be excluded from the protection of the ICSID arbitration mechanism. The key role of the requirement of (specific) consent to arbitration on the part of States is already articulated in the last preambular paragraph and becomes particularly and repeatedly manifest in Art. 25 of the ICSID Convention, notably in the last sentence of its para. 4\".200\n\n*Ibid*, para. 461.\n\n241.\n\nAgain consent as the controlling factor of the meaning of the term \"investment\" in Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention that the Majority Decision stresses through the aggregation of different elements, namely **:** Preamble (last paragraph); Article 25(4) (the \"trade-off\" reached during negotiations); Executive Directors' Report (reference to consent as the \"cornerstone\" of the jurisdiction of the Centre) and Article 1(1) of the BIT (alleged to include in the definition of \"investment\" the transactions at stake). And again the Majority Decision rejects any objective ordinary meaning of the term \"investment in Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention.\n\n242.\n\nThe paramount aim of the 1965 ICSID Convention of promoting international cooperation for *economic development* disappears altogether from the picture overwhelmed by the above avalanche of unilateral or bilateral consents. It is indeed a peculiar way of applying the VCLT rules to the interpretation of Article 25(1) of the Convention to replace the object and purpose of the latter (a component of the general rule of interpretation of treaties) by the majority's own wrong conclusions on the definition of the term \"investment\" in Article 1(1) of the Argentina-Italy BIT (see below).\n\n243.\n\nFor the Majority Decision leaving the pertinent sovereign bonds and security entitlements outside of the scope of Article 25 of the ICSID Convention would \"make no sense in view of Argentina's and Italy's express agreement to protect the value generated by these kinds of contributions\".201 This statement makes sense if one rejects the *double-barrelled* test only. Thus at the end of the day, the Majority Decision ended by a denial of the normative value to the \"*two barrelled*\" test, in line with the 2011 *Abaclat* majority decision. In fact, what makes no sense for the Majority Decision is but one of the always plausible outcomes resulting naturally from the interpretation of the text of an international conventional instrument by an international arbitral tribunal applying the VCLT rules. As explained by Professor Abi-Saab in paragraph 40 of his dissenting opinion in *Abaclat* : \"Without limits, words would be meaningless, because undistinguishable from one another. The intrinsic meaning of a word, *which is its 'ordinary'* *meaning, is further specified by the way it is used and the context in which it is used, and if it figures in a treaty, by the object and purpose of the treaty*\" (*emphasis supplied*).\n\n*Ibid*, para. 463\n\n244.\n\nThe Majority Decision's reasoning on the interpretation of the concept of \"investment\" in Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention has also a grave and unacceptable lacuna. It omits any reference to the first constituting element of the general rule of the interpretation of treaties, namely to *good faith.* As declared by the opening words of Article 31(1) of the VCLT: *\"A treaty shall be interpreted in good faith\".* Moreover, good faith is a general principle of law applicable, on this account also, by international courts and tribunals to *inter alia* the interpretation and application of treaties and States cannot contract out of the system of international law.\n\n245.\n\nThis is to say that international courts and tribunals are expected to bear constantly in mind, as noted by the International Law Commission, that \"the interpretation of treaties in good faith and according to the law is essential if the *pacta sunt servanda* rule is to have any real meaning\".202 In effect, as stated by the Commission's commentary of Article 31(1) of the VCLT contains three separate principles:\n\n\"The first - interpretation in good faith - flows directly from the rule *pacta sunt servanda.* The second principle is the very essence of the textual approach: the parties are to be presumed to have that intention which appears from the ordinary meaning of the terms used by them. The third principle is one of both common sense and good faith; the ordinary meaning of a term is not to be determined in the abstract but in the context of the treaty and in the light of its object and purpose. These principles have repeatedly been affirmed by the Court.\"203\n\nUN Publication on the Law of Treaties, *supra* note 175, p.38, at para. 5.\n\n*Ibid*, p. 40, at para. 12.\n\n246.\n\nThus, an interpretation of the term \"investment\" in Article 25(1) that would oversight that the *primary purpose* of the ICSID Convention is to provide additional inducement and stimulate a larger flow of private international investment into the territories of the host States as a means of strengthening the economy development of these States cannot be considered a good faith interpretation of the provision, because the probative available material (the text of the first three paragraphs of the Preamble of the Convention; paragraph 12 of the Report of the Executive Directors) support the view that such a primary purpose was clearly present in 1965 at the time of the adoption of the ICSID Convention in the minds of the representatives of the negotiating States and their intentions manifested themselves clearly in the very text of the preamble of the Convention. Moreover, the *travaux* confirm that the term \"investment\" was inserted in Article 25(1) precisely to distinguish between those protected by the ICSID system from other operations or activities called, generically, \"ordinary commercial transactions\".\n\n247.\n\nAnother element that a good faith interpretation must ponder is the fact that the term \"investment\" or the expression \"investment dispute\" has not been the subject of any definition in the treaty itself. However, the title confirms that the treaty is a \"Convention on *the settlement of investment disputes* between States and Nationals of other States\", not a general international system of settlement of any kind of disputes. Further, from the wording of the Convention cannot be inferred an intention of the Contracting States to accord to the term \"investment\" of the title and text an unusual, extraordinary or counterintuitive meaning. The \"special meaning\" rule of Article 31(4) of the VCLT appears therefore as no applicable to the interpretation of the term \"investment\" in Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention.\n\n248.\n\nThe provision in Article 25(1) should therefore be interpreted in good faith *in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to its terms,* including of course to the term \"investment\", in their context and in the light of the object and purpose of the Convention. The subject-matter of the interpretative process in the present instance consists, consequently, in ascertaining the ordinary meaning of the term \"investment\" in that Article of the ICSID Convention with the help, as relevant, of the interpretative elements constituting the general rule of interpretation of treaties set out in paragraphs (1) to (3) of Article 31 of the VCLT.\n\n249.\n\nIn this connection, it should be recalled that within the VCLT interpretation system a correct application of the temporal element to the interpretation of a given term or expression in the text is controlled by the principle of good faith specifically incorporated into the \"general rule\" of interpretation of treaties of Article 31 of the VCLT.204 Then, a good faith interpretation of the term \"investment\" in Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention does not allow the interpreter to ignore the eventual incidence in the interpretation of the temporal element. One must therefore ask first: what was the prevailing ordinary meaning of the term \"investment\" when in 1965 it was inserted in Article 25(1)?\n\n*Ibid*, p. 42, at para. 16.\n\n250.\n\nIt is necessary to clear up this question because, at present, the term is sometimes used either generically or in some specific context (for example, in a financial context) with meanings which might not coincide with the ordinary meaning of the term \"investment\" at the time of the negotiation and adoption of the ICSID Convention, without prejudice of course of the penumbra around its exact outer-limits which provides a margin for interpretation. Good faith requires indeed to take duly into account, as appropriate, the temporal element in the interpretation of Article 25(1) of the Convention by distinguishing between any eventual meaning of the term \"investment\" in current financial or other contexts unconnected with any economic activity in the host State, on one hand, and the international \"investment\" that the ICSID Convention seeks in 1965 to protect in order to encourage *economic development,* by providing a neutral international forum for the settlement of investment disputes that counter-balance the host State's regulatory authority over investments in its territory, on the other hand.\n\n251.\n\nIn the light of the probative available materials and publications, the type of \"investment\" of the ICSID Convention presupposes not only a financial contribution, but also a contribution in terms of economic activity, duration and risk in the host State, with the expectation of profits and/or revenue in return.205 The Majority Decision admits expressly that the paramount argument militating against its own extremely wider understanding of the term \"investment\" in Article 25 of the Convention \"would be that this might come as a surprise for States having subscribed to international arbitration\".206\n\nProfessor Abi-Saab's dissenting opinion in *Abaclat*, *supra* note 37, para.50.\n\nMajority Decision, para. 462.\n\n252.\n\nThe good faith interpretation of the VCLT is just the tool at the disposal of the interpreter to avoid conclusions which might well be contrary to the *pacta sunt servanda* rule binding States by contracting in the ICSID Convention. Given the interpretative methods applied by the Majority Decision, I consider in order to seize this opportunity to reproduce below the following passage of *Oppenheim's International Law* edited in 1992 by Sir Robert Jennings, former President of the ICJ, and Sir Arthur Watts:\n\n\"The general rule of interpretation laid down in Article 31 of the Vienna Convention adopts the textual approach...That such a textual approach - on which the International Law Commission was unanimous - is an accepted part of customary international law is suggested by many pronouncements of the International Court of Justice, which has also emphasised that interpretation is not a matter of revising treaties or reading into them what they do not expressly or by necessary implication contain, or of applying a rule of interpretation so as to produce a result contrary to the letter or spirit of the treaty's text\".207\n\nOppenheim's International Law, vol.1 (parts 2 to 4), 9th edition, pp. 1271-72. It is to be noted that in the quoted passage the reference \"to the spirit\" is not to a floating spirit but to the \"spirit of the treaty's text\".\n\n253.\n\nNo evidence has been provided to the Tribunal about any amendment or modification by practice or otherwise of the original *primary purpose* of the ICSID Convention of strengthening the economic development of host States by stimulating a larger flow of private international investment into their territories. Furthermore, neither the Majority Decision nor the Parties have argued, and still less proved, that the Contracting States of the ICSID Convention intended that the meaning of the term \"investment\" inserted in Article 25(1) should be understood as being, for interpretation purpose, an \"evolutionary\" term incorporating as such future eventual developments in the use of the term in law or relations in contexts other than a ICSID context. As explained in the Executive Directors' Report, the opining words of Article 25(1) of the Convention, namely the expression *\"The jurisdiction of the Centre\"* is used in the Convention \"as a convenient expression to mean *the limits* within which the provisions of the Convention will apply and the facilities of the Centre will be available for conciliation and arbitration proceedings\"208 (*emphasis supplied*).\n\nReport of the Executive Directors, para. 22.\n\n254.\n\nCertainly, the Parties to the present case differ as to the interpretation of the facts and the applicable law but they did not controvert the kind or type of \"investment\" to which Article 25(1) of the Convention refers. It is quite significant in this respect that the Claimants themselves describe the purported basis to qualify their holdings as ICSID investments as follows:\n\n\"[...] The initial purchase by the banks and the underwriters of the bonds issued by Argentina *is indisputable an investment which satisfies all the requirements of the definition of investment,* in terms of duration, risk, substantial commitment and contribution to the development of Argentina, profits and returns. As permitted by the terms of the relevant bond issues (and as in practically all bond issues), the initial purchasers of the bonds sold them to a vast number of investors in the secondary market who later may have resold them. *The subsequent circulation of the bonds on the secondary market evidently did not deprive the initial 'investment' of its quality, nor did it modify its nature*\"209 (*emphasis supplied*).\n\nClaimants' Rejoinder, para. 97.\n\n255.\n\nIn its search for the ordinary meaning of the term \"investment\" in Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention, a good faith interpretation of the provision cannot brush aside the criterion that an activity or operation must be present to characterize a given transaction as an \"investment\" as deduced from ICSID decisions and commentators thereon. The criteria generally followed single out some *contribution* in cash or other assets of economic value (i.e. contribution in kind, labor, etc.), a *certain duration* (a minimum of years), an element of *risk in the enterprise* (operational risk) and a contribution to the host State *economic development*, presented sometimes in terms of the magnitude of the investment (a positive and significant contribution to the economic development of the host State). Reference is also made (sometimes under the heading of \"contribution\") to the regularity of the deferred compensation for the investment (profits and return).\n\n256.\n\nThe *Salini v. Morocco* ICSID arbitral tribunal - one of the first to attempt an objective definition of \"investment\" - provides in its decision of jurisdiction of 23 July 2001 the following list of distinctive marks of \"investment\" which must be satisfied cumulatively:\n\n\"The doctrine generally considers that investment infers: contributions, certain duration of performance of the contract and a participation in the risks of the transaction (citations omitted). In reading the Convention's Preamble, one may add the contribution to the economic development of the host State of the investment as an additional condition.\n\nIn reality, these various elements may be interdependent. Thus, the risks of the transaction may depend on the contributions and the duration of the performance of the contract. As a result, these various criteria should be assessed globally even if, for the sake of reasoning, the Tribunal considers them individually\";210\n\n\"Although the total duration for the performance of the contract, in accordance CCAP, was fixed at 32 months, this was extended to 36 months. The transaction therefore, complies with minimal length of time upheld by the doctrine, which is from 2 to 5 years\" (citations omitted).211\n\n*Salini Costruttori S.p.A. and Italstrade S.p.A. v. Kingdom of Morocco* (ICSID Case No. ARB/00/4), Decision on Jurisdiction of 23 July 2001 (\"*Salini v. Morocco*\"), para. 52.\n\n*Ibid*, para. 54.\n\n257.\n\nWith minor variations, the attempts to ascertain the ordinary meaning of the term \"investment\" in the Article 25 of the ICSID Convention turn generally around those criteria or conditions. As stated, among several others, by the *Jan de Nul* arbitral tribunal in its 2006 decision on jurisdiction:\n\n\"The Tribunal concurs with ICSID precedents which, subject to minor variations, have relied on the so-called ' *Salini* test'. Such test identifies the following elements as indicative of an 'investment' for the purpose of the ICSID Convention: (i) a contribution, (ii) a certain duration over which the project is implemented, (iii) a sharing of operational risks, and (iv) a contribution to the host State's development, being understood that these elements may be closely interrelated, should be examined in their totality and will normally depend on the circumstances of the case\" (*Jan de Nul* decision of 16 June 2006, para. 91).\n\n258.\n\nThe fourth additional condition of the *Salini* test, namely the contribution to the host State's economic development of the investment referred to in the Preamble of the ICSID Convention, had been suggested in the eighties by George Delaume as a single condition test *alternative* to the traditional contribution/ duration/ risk test, with a view to enlarging the scope of application of Article 25(1) of the Convention.212 The *Salini* test merges therefore these three constitutive elements of the traditional definition of \"investment\" *plus* the element of the contribution of the international investment to the economic development of the host State of the ICSID Convention Preamble.\n\nGeorge Delaume refers to \"the expected if not always actual, contribution of the investment to the economic development of the country in question\" (Le centre international pour le r\u00e8glement des diff\u00e9rends (CIRDI)\", *Journal de droit international* (1982), at page 801).\n\n259.\n\nMost of the ICSID arbitral tribunals espoused the objective conceptualist approach of *Salini* (with its \"deductive method\") but, as explained in the quotations below, some of them considered *the fourth Salini condition to be a consequence of the investment rather that a constitutive condition of the notion and that, in any case, the fourth condition is covered by the first three* :\n\n\"[...] it seems that, in conformity with the objectives of the Convention, for a contract to be deemed an investment it must fulfil the following three conditions: a) the contracting party has made a contribution in the country in question, b) this contribution must extend over a certain period of time, and c) it must entail some risk for the contracting party.\n\nHowever, it does not seem necessary to establish that the contract addresses the economic development of the country, *a condition that is in any case difficult to establish and is implicitly covered by the three conditions adopted therein\"* (*LESI-Dipenta v. Algeria* (ICSID Case No. ARB/03/8) award of 10 January 2005, para. 13(iv)) (*emphasis supplied*);\n\n\"This Tribunal considers that a definition of investment does exist within the meaning of the ICSID Convention and that it does not suffice to note the existence of certain 'characteristics' which are typical of an investment to satisfy this objective requirement of the Centre's jurisdiction. Such an interpretation would result in depriving certain terms of Article 25 of the ICSID Convention of any meaning, something which would be incompatible with the obligation to interpret the terms of the Convention in accordance with the *effet utile* principle, as rightly stated by the award rendered in the *Joy Mining Machinery Limited v. Arab Republic of Egypt* case on August 6, 2004. According to the Tribunal, this definition, by contrast, only includes three elements. The requirement of a contribution to the development of the host State, which is difficult to establish, appears to allude to the merits of the dispute rather than to the Centre's jurisdiction. An investment may or may not prove to be useful to the host State without losing its status as such. It is true that the preamble of the ICSID convention makes references to the contribution to the economic development of the host State. *This is nevertheless presented as a consequence, and not a condition, of the investment: by protecting investments, the convention foments the development of the host State. That does not mean that the development of the host State is a constitutive element of the notion of investment.* This is why, as has been pointed out by certain arbitral tribunals, this fourth condition is in reality covered by the first three\" (*Pey Casado v. Chile* (ICSID Case No. ARB/98/2), Award of 8 May 2008, para. 232) (*emphasis supplied*); and\n\n\"[...] the present Tribunal considers that the criteria of (i) a contribution, (ii) a certain duration, and (iii) an element of risk, are both necessary and sufficient to define an investment within the framework of the ICSID Convention. In the Tribunal opinion, this approach reflects an objective definition of 'investment' that embodies specific criteria corresponding to the ordinary meaning of the term 'investment', without doing violence either to the text or the object and purpose of the ICSID Convention. *These three criteria derive from the ordinary meaning of the word 'investment',* [...]\" (*Saba Fakes v. Turkey* award of 14 July 2010, para. 110) (*emphasis supplied*).\n\n260.\n\nThe decisions above and others following the same classical objective approach213 diverge therefore sometimes in respect to the number of the constitutive elements to define \"investment\" but all are seeking to define the term by fixed criteria which must be fulfilled for the transaction may be qualified as \"investment\". Moreover, all those decisions listed the three elements of contributions, durability and operational risk which appear as a minimum common denominator, namely as the hard-core or intrinsic *ordinary meaning* of the concept of investment of Article 25(1) of the Convention, as rightly stated by the above *Saba Fakes* decision.214\n\nAs explained by D. Carreau, T. Flory and P. Juillard in a section concerning the search for criteria relating to \"the concept of investment\": \"The criteria are based in three ideas. First, there can be no investment without a contribution -whatever the form of contribution. Second, there can be no investment within a short period of time: an investment transaction is characterized by a 'durability' that can only be satisfied by a mid to long term contribution. Third, there can be no investment without risk, which means that the deferred compensation of the investor must be dependent upon the loss and profit of the venture. These three criteria are to be applied cumulatively\". (*Droit International Economique*, 3rd edition, 1990, para.935) (quoted in Emmanuel Gaillard, *Identify or Define?*, *supra* note 157 *,* at p. 405)\n\nIn addition to decisions already mentioned, see for example: *Bayindir Insaat Turizm Ticaret Ve Sanayi A.S. v. Islamic Republic of Pakistan* (ICSID Case No. ARB/03/29), Decision on Jurisdiction of 14 November 2005 *(\"Bayindir Insaat*\") *;* *LESI, S.p.A. and Astaldi, S.p.A. v. People's Democratic Republic of Algeria* (ICSID Case No. ARB/05/3), Decision on Jurisdiction of 12 July 2006 (\"*LESI-Astaldi*\"); *Saipem S.p.A. v. People's Republic of Bangladesh* (ICSID Case No. ARB/05/7), Decision on Jurisdiction and Recommendation on Provisional Measures of 21 March 2007; *Ioannis Kardassopoulos v. Georgia* (ICSID Case No. ARB/05/18), Decision on Jurisdiction of 6 July 2007; and *Romak v. Uzbekistan*, *supra* note 148.\n\n261.\n\nNevertheless, the \"contribution to the economic development of the host State\" being part and parcel of the object and purpose of the ICSID Convention (independently of being considered implied in the said hard-core, additional condition or a consequence of the investment) has also - by virtue of Article 31(1) of VCLT - a important role to play in ascertaining the ordinary meaning of \"investment\" within the specific context of Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention. In the light of that object and purpose it is obvious that, as rightly stated by the *Phoenix Action* arbitral tribunal, if \"the investor carries out no economic activity, which is the goal of the encouragement of the flow of international investment, the operation, although possibly involving a contribution, a duration and some taking of risk will not qualify as a *protected investment*, as it does not satisfy the purpose of the ICSID Convention\" (award of 15 April 2009, para. 86) (*emphasis supplied*) *.*\n\n262.\n\nThe ordinary meaning of the term \"investment\" in Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention deduced from the above considerations raises indeed the question of whether it may be affirmed that \"portfolio investments\" and other financial negotiable products (traded with high velocity of circulation in capital markets and at places far remote from the State in whose territory the investment is supposed to take place) between persons alien to any economic activity in the host State and which, generally speaking, cover a wide spectrum of financial products ranging from standardized instruments (i.e. shares, bonds, loans) to structured and derivatives products (i.e. hedges of currencies, oil, etc., credit default swaps) may be qualified as \"investment\" in the sense of the ICSID Convention in the light of their intrinsic characteristics and the novelty of several of those products.\n\n263.\n\nIt is the conviction of the author of the present Opinion that the answer of a good faith international law interpretation to that question cannot be but negative because those financial products do not meet the investment requirements derived from the inherent *ordinary meaning* of term \"investment\" of Article 25(1) in its context and in the light of the object and purpose of the 1965 ICSID Convention. Thus, they cannot as a general rule qualify as \"protected investment\" under that Convention.215\n\nSee Professor Abi-Saab's dissenting opinion in *Abaclat*, *supra* note 37, paras. 55-8.\n\n264.\n\nThe Majority Decision's conclusion on the matter, contrary to my own, derives from its assumption of the proposition of *the non-jurisdictional nature of the Salini test* shared generally by the subjectivists (i.e. Delaume, Schreuer, Fadlallah, Mortenson, Manciaux, etc.) who although admit the existence of common features of most \"investments\" (quite similar by the way to those mentioned in the paragraphs above) consider, however, those features should not be understood as \"jurisdictional requirements\", but merely as \"typical characteristics\" of investments under the ICSID Convention.216 The Majority Decision is perfectly clear in this respect **:** \"The preceding analysis has also made clear that the present Tribunal endorses the view that the term 'investment' in Art. 25(1) of the ICSID Convention should not be subject to an unduly restrictive interpretation. Hence, the *Salini* criteria, if useful at all, must not be conceived of as expressing jurisdictional requirements *stricto sensu*\".217\n\nSome of those authors evolved with the passage of time to more radical subjectivist positions. For example, *Delaume* wrote in 1986 that it \"is within the sole discretion of each Contracting State to determine the type of investment disputes that it considers arbitrable in the context of ICSID\" (\"*ICSID and the Transnational Financial Community*\" *,* 1 ICSID Review (1986), at p.242). This statement is not without ambiguity. It may be read *prima facie* as an attempt to interpret the 1965 ordinary meaning of the term \"investment\" in Article 25(1) by reference to Article 25(4), as the Majority Decision tried in the present case. But, it may be also viewed as an attempt to redefine, since 1986 onwards (without amendment of the Convention), the original ordinary meaning of the term \"investment\" in Article 25(1), coinciding with the expanding flow at that time of private capital in the financing of emergent market countries.\n\nMajority Decision, para. 479.\n\n265.\n\nHowever, the Majority Decision feels the need to indicate some limits to an otherwise *unduly liberal interpretation* of Article 25(1), so it adds that **:** \"(the *Salini* test criteria) [...] may still prove useful provided that they are treated as guidelines and that they are applied in conjunction and in a flexible manner. In particular, they may help to identify, and exclude, *extreme phenomena* that must remain outside of even a broad reading of the term 'investment' in Art. 25 of the ICSID Convention\"218 (*emphasis supplied*). However, one cannot but wonder what \"extreme phenomena\" means for the Majority Decision in the light of its specific conclusion that the pertinent \"security entitlements\" held by the Claimants in Argentine \"sovereign bonds\" deposited in Italian banks in Italy \"fulfilled the criteria generally ascribed to the *Salini* test\"219, when in fact they fulfil none of those criteria.\n\n*Ibid*, para. 481.\n\n*Ibid*, para. 482.\n\n266.\n\nIf the majority is unable or unwilling to distinguish between an \"investment\" of Article 25(1) of the ICSID convention and the issuance and selling of sovereign bonds by a State in international capital markets as a means of financing themselves its general needs in cash in accordance with the corresponding contemporary accepted practices and procedures of those markets, the self-proclaimed \"guidelines\" of the *Salini* test are meaningless, mere lip service to objectivity.\n\n267.\n\nIn fact, the Majority Decision not only puts aside the *Salini* test but refuses altogether with obstinacy, and this is the real legal issue on the point with the present Opinion, to attribute to the term \"investment\" in Article 25(1) the ordinary meaning it has in its context and in the light of the object and purpose of the 1965 ICSID Convention. Another casualty is the role of the \"temporal element\" in the interpretation of treaty terms. The total disregarding by the Majority Decision of this element is contrary to the principle of good faith governing the interpretation of treaties. In 1965 the time of the tradable Brady sovereign bonds of the 1990s and later markets was still far away.220\n\nIn the late 1980s and early 1990s the nature of sovereign borrowing changed dramatically in ways that limited the effectiveness of the Paris Club (lending to sovereigns from other States or their Agencies). The flows of official capital to emerging markets countries stagnated and flows of private capital surged most of which \"came from large banks in developed, high-income countries, which sought to take advantage of the higher interest rate available through loans to sovereign in the developing world. \"Emerging market debt' became its own market.\" (*Written Witness Statement of William Burke-White*, para. 15, annexed to Argentina's Memorial). In 1985, under the Baker Plan commercial bank lending became a prerequisite to multilateral lending from the IMF and other international organizations (*Ibid*, para. 17). A process for the renegotiation of sovereign debt to private bank was established within the London Club (*Ibid*, para. 18). A major shift in the ownership of sovereign debt came in 1989 with the Brady Plan thereby bank debts were converted into *tradable* Brady Bonds. The market for developing country bonds expanded: \"For issuing governments, these new bonds provided a relatively easy source of new capital. For capital exporters, these new sovereign bonds promised a high return in capital\" (*Ibid*, para. 22). As a result, the creditors of the 1990 and later \"were largely bondholders -small banks, funds and individual (instead of large commercial banks). These private creditors \"have become increasingly numerous, anonymous and difficult to coordinate\" (*Ibid,* para. 23).\n\n268.\n\nIn any case, the proof that the selling and purchase of sovereign bonds and security entitlements like those at stake in the present case were intended in 1965 by the negotiating States to be covered by the term \"investment\" in Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention has not been administered by the Claimants and it is not explained in the Majority Decision either. What it is obvious is the existence of a broad parallelism in time between the expanding flow of private capital and the increase in the number of doctrinal publications in favour, as a matter of policy, of opening the doors of ICSID international arbitration to eventual disputes arising out of mere financial transaction even if the latter are unconnected with any genuine \"investment\".221 But, as already indicated, the 1965 ICSID Convention remains as concluded, namely without being amended.\n\nFor instance, in 2004 Manciaux suggested taking into account only the \"growth of the host State's estate\" reminiscent of Delaume's former proposition of the \"contribution to the host State's economic development\" (see, Emmanuel Gaillard, *Identify or Define?*, *supra* note 157, at p. 405, footnote 15).\n\n269.\n\nThe Majority Decision has been quite timid in alleging case-law in support of its conclusions, showing thereby that the latter yield mainly to doctrinal constructions quite posterior to the ICSID Convention. Moreover, some of the invoked ICSID arbitral decisions boomerang against the Majority Decision's conclusions. It is for example the case of the *Mihaly* award (2002) which provides that \"without proof of an ' investment ' under Article 25(1), neither Party need to argue further, for without such an ' investment ', there cannot be no dispute, legal or otherwise, arising directly or indirectly out of it, which could be submitted to the jurisdiction of the Centre and the Tribunal\".222 This is exactly the position of the author of the present Opinion. In the same vein, the 2004 *Joy Mining* award which after noting the absence in the case of the elements of risk, duration, regularity of profit and contribution to development concludes that \"it lacks jurisdiction to consider the dispute because the claim falls outside both the Treaty and the Convention\".223\n\n*Mihaly*, *supra* note 27, para. 32.\n\n*Joy Mining*, *supra* note 167, paras. 62 and 63.\n\n270.\n\nThe Majority Decision's conclusions rest heavily on the *Fedax* decision (1997). Then, it should be recalled that while giving certainly a broad reach to the concept, the decision does not reject the proposition that by inserting the term \"investment\" in Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention the Contracting States set out an objective legal requirement which must be complied with for establishing the jurisdiction of the Centre.224 Thus, without engaging in a vast debate on the notion of \"investment\", *Fedax* nevertheless took into account some basic constitutive elements of that objective notion (certain duration, regularity of profit and return, assumption of risk, substantial commitment, significant for the host State's development) when deciding that the purchase of the pertinent promissory notes (an evidence of a \"loan\") qualified in the *particular facts of the case* as an investment under the ICSID Convention.225\n\n*Fedax*, *supra* note 128, para. 28.\n\n*Ibid*, para. 43.\n\n271.\n\nCertainly, *Fedax* admits that a loan *could* constitute an investment, but that this is not necessarily so in all factual circumstances or for every form of loan or credit. It would seem that for *Fedax* the loans which would fall ultimately under the scope of the Convention will generally be those intended to finance somehow a project, work or services (reference to the Venezuelan Public Credit Law is significant in that respect) in the host State having the character of, or be related to, a *\"genuine\"* investment under Article 25(1) of the Convention.226 The decision in *Joy Mining* (2004) and the award in *Sempra v. Argentine* (2007), tribunals presided by the same person, throw some additional light thereon.227\n\n*Ibid*, para. 42.\n\n*Joy Mining*, *supra* note 168, para. 60; *Sempra Energy International v. Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/02/16), Award of 28 September 2007, paras. 211-16 (this award has been annulled by an ICSID *ad hoc* Committee Decision on Application for Annulment of 29 June 2010).\n\n272.\n\nIn contrast with *Fedax*, the *CSOB v. Slovakia* decision did not consider that the basic elements of the objective concept of \"investment\" were jurisdictional prerequisites for the finding that a given transaction constitute an investment, but that the underlying transaction should be designed to promote the economic development of the host State.228 This latter decision is therefore closer to the present Majority Decision than *Fedax.* The *CSOB v. Slovakia* arbitral tribunal underlined that the \"CSOB's claim and the related loan facility made available to the Slovak Collection Company are closely connected to the development of CSOB's banking activity in the Slovak Republic and that they qualify as investments within the meaning of the Convention and the BIT\".229 However, contrary to the general approach of the present Majority Decision to the territoriality aspect of an \"investment\" (see below), *CSOB v. Slovakia* tribunal underlines that the Consolidation Agreement provides basically for the development of CSOB's activities in both the Czech and Slovak Republics, as well as that there were spending or outlays of resources in the Slovak Republic, that the CSOB qualifies as the holder of an \"asset invested or obtained\" in the territory of the Slovak Republic, and that the said activities were designed to produce a benefit and to offer a return in the future, subject to the element of risk that is implicit in most economic activities.230\n\n*CSOB*, *supra* note 133, para. 64.\n\n*Ibid*, para. 91.\n\n*Ibid*, paras. 87-90.\n\n273.\n\nIn the present case, the Majority Decision does not follow in fact the reasoning of either *Fedax* or *CSOB* to reach the conclusion that the sovereign bonds and security entitlements at stake fulfil the criteria general ascribed to the *Salini* test, but a different path based essentially upon the presumption that the Contracting States of the ICSID Convention left largely to the BITs, or other jurisdictional instruments, the definition of the term \"investment\" of Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention as did before, for example, the *MCI v. Ecuador* decision of 31 July 2007,231 the *CMS Gas v. Argentina* decision of the *ad hoc* committee on application for annulment of 25 September 2007232 and the *Biwater v. Tanzania* award of 24 July 2008 which declares, *inter alia,* that \"even if the Republic could demonstrate that any, or all, of the *Salini* criteria are not satisfied in this case, this not necessarily be sufficient - in and of itself - to deny jurisdiction\".233 In the subject-matter considered, the *Abaclat* majority decision was not of much help for the present Majority Decision in view of the sidestepping by the former of jurisdictional requirements.\n\n*M.C.I. Power Group, L.C. and New Turbine, Inc. v. Republic of Ecuador* (ICSID Case No. ARB/03/6), Decision on the Application for Annulment of 19 October 2009) (\"*MCI v. Ecuador*\"), para. 165.\n\n*CMS Gas Transmission Company v. Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/01/8), Decision of the *ad hoc* Committee on the Application for Annulment of the Argentine Republic of 25 September 2007 (\"*CMS Gas v. Argentina*\"), para. 71.\n\n*Biwater Gauff (Tanzania) Limited v. United Republic of Tanzania* (ICSID Case No. ARB/05/22), Award of 24 July 2008, para. 318.\n\n274.\n\nIn sum, the Majority Decision raises the issue of the non-jurisdictional nature of the *Salini* test to avoid the unavoidable conclusion that the purchase by the Claimants of the sovereign bonds and security entitlements at stake in the present case is not a genuine \"investment\" in the sense of Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention. But such issue is rather a fallacy. What counts for a good faith interpretation is not at all *Salini* as such, but the determination of the *ordinary* *meaning* of the term \"investment\" in Article 25(1) in the context of the 1965 ICSID Convention and in the light of the object and purpose of that Convention which is the first point of reference for the interpretation of treaty provisions, as provided for by the rules on interpretation of treaties codified by the VCLT. Then, it is such an ordinary meaning that the majority tries to conceal again and again behind the screen of the reiterative and dogmatic affirmation of the broad meaning to be given to term \"investment\" in Article 25 (in fact a limitless meaning) or, alternatively, that the said term should not be subjected to an unduly restrict interpretation which nobody proposed or is proposing.\n\n275.\n\nA good faith interpretation of Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention has also to ponder the fact that the Centre was not established to become just another institution for the settlement of any kind of disputes through conciliation and arbitration, but only for the settlement of disputes arising directly out of an \"investment\" between a Contracting State (the host State) and a national of other Contracting States (the private foreign investor). To proceed otherwise would be in full contradiction with the plain text of Article 25(1), the purpose of the ICSID Convention as recorded in the Preamble and the Executive Directors' Report, and the very logic and justification of the ICSID special international protection system.234 Further, in the present case, the Claimants are alien to any kind of economic activity in the host State (or related thereto in some significant relevant way) and, therefore, they do not satisfy either the requirement of the cooperation for economic development of host State requirement enounce in the opening paragraph of the Preamble of the ICSID Convention which is, indeed, the *raison d'\u00eatre* of the protection granted thereby to a genuine \"investment\".235\n\nSee Judge Mohamed Shahabuddeen's dissenting opinion in the *Malaysian Historical Salvors* Decision on annulment, *supra* note 160, paras. 62-5.\n\n*Phoenix Action*, *supra* note 168, para. 86.\n\n276.\n\nFor the author of the present Opinion, the term \"investment\" in Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention has an intended inherent *ordinary meaning* rightly described, with reference to the 1993 Switzerland- Uzbekistan BIT, by the award of 26 November 2009 of the *Romak and Uzbekistan* arbitral tribunal (a PCA tribunal) as follows :\n\n\"The Arbitral Tribunal [...] considers that the term 'investment' under the BIT has an inherent meaning (irrespective of whether the investor resorts to ICSID or UNCITRAL arbitral proceedings) entailing a contribution that extends over a certain period of time and that involves some risk. The Arbitral Tribunal is further comforted in its analysis by the reasoning adopted by other arbitral tribunals [...] which consistently incorporates contribution, duration and risk as hallmarks of an \"investment\". By their nature, asset types enumerated in the BIT's non-exhaustive list may exhibit these hallmarks. But if an asset does not correspond to the inherent definition of 'investment,' the fact that it falls within one of the categories listed in Article 1 does not transform it into an 'investment'. In the general formulation of the tribunal in *Azinian* \"*labelling* [...] *is no substitute for analysis*\".236\n\n*Romak*, *supra* note 148, para. 207.\n\n**5. The definition of \"investment\" of Article 1(1) of the 1990 Argentina-Italy BIT**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**(a) Authentic texts and general economy of the definition**\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n277.\n\nThe provision defining the term \"investment\" in the Argentina-Italy BIT, namely Article 1(1), is construed by a *chapeau* containing a *general definition* of the term, followed - *within that general context -* by a non-exhaustive list (a) to (f) of examples of different types of specific investments. Among them, the example in lit. (c) deals with financial instruments. As mentioned in footnote 23 of the Introduction to the present Opinion, the term used in the authentic Spanish (\"*obligaciones*\") and Italian (\"*obbligazioni*\") texts of Article 1(1)(c) were translated in some English versions as *\"bonds\"* creating initially considerable misunderstandings between the Parties, as well as within the Tribunal.\n\n278.\n\nThe Majority Decision reproduces the authentic Spanish and Italian texts and an unofficial English translation of Article 1(1)(c) in its paragraphs 417 and 418. The reproduced unofficial English translation is composed by a translation provided by the Respondent and an alternative translation offered by the Claimants, but that translation has not been authenticated by the Parties (Article 33(2) of the VCLT). It follows that the question of the use or non-use of the term \"bonds\" in some unofficial English translation is legally irrelevant for the interpretation of lit. (c) of Article 1(1) of the BIT. Thus, I will reproduce below in the order the text of lit. (c) in the equally authentic Spanish and Italian texts only:\n\n\"c. obligaciones, t\u00edtulos p\u00fablicos o privados o cualquier otro derecho a prestaciones o servicios que tengan un valor econ\u00f3mico, como tambi\u00e9n las ganancias capitalizadas;\"\n\n\"c. obbligazioni, titoli pubblici o private o qualsiasi altro diritto per prestazioni o servizi che abbiamo un valore economico, come altresi redditi capitializzati\".\n\n279.\n\nAs can be seen, the terms \"bonds\" and/or \"security entitlements\" do not appear in the authentic Spanish or Italian texts of Article 1(1)(c) of the 1990 Argentina-Italy BIT; still less expressions such as \"*sovereign* bonds\" or \"security entitlements in *sovereign* bonds\". This clarification should be the starting point of any interpretative process aimed at determining the ordinary meaning of the term \"investment\" in Article 1(1) of the BIT through the application of the interpretation rules of the VCLT. However, and from the very beginning of its interpretative process, the Majority Decision proclaims dogmatically that \"there can be no doubt that *Art. 1(1) of the Argentina-Italy BIT* covers the bonds/security entitlements at stake in the present proceedings\".237 I must say that such a proclamation does not stand scrutiny, unless the immediate *context* of lit. (c), namely the *chapeau* in Article 1(1), is done away with one fell stroke, as does the Majority Decision's reasoning.\n\nMajority Decision, para. 490.\n\n280.\n\nBut, the Majority Decision cannot ignore, and in fact it admits, that very text of Article 1(1) of the BIT does *subject* the meaning of the non-exhaustive list of specific types of investments therein, and therefore of lit. (c), to *the general definition of the chapeau of Article 1(1)*. Then, as already indicated in this Opinion, Article 31(1) of the VCLT provides that a treaty shall be interpreted in good faith in accordance with *the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context* and in the light of its object and purpose. Thus, it follows that the \"*obligaciones/ obbligazioni*\" of lit. (c) cannot be but those which are in conformity with the definition of the *chapeau* and not further or otherwise. However, notwithstanding this obvious textual and contextual conclusion as to the meaning and scope of the term \"*obligaciones/obbligazioni*\" in lit. (c), the Majority Decision insists that:\n\n\"At most, it might be argued that the Parties opted to use a generic term covering all types of obligations, thus including bonds/security entitlements. Had the Parties sought to actually exclude those instruments from the scope of the application of the BIT, they would have had to say so explicitly\".238\n\n*Ibid*, para. 491.\n\n281.\n\nBut, this is what has been precisely done by Argentina and Italy through the method of placing all the specific examples of the non-exhaustive list within the context of the definition of \"investment\" of the *chapeau* of Article 1(1) (*en este marco general/intale contexto di carattere generale*). Thus, those \"*obligaciones/obbligazioni*\" in lit. (c) which do not fulfil the requirements set out in the general definition of the *chapeau*, or because of its very nature or characteristics are in plain contradiction with such a definition, are to be deemed explicitly excluded by the investment definition of Article 1(1) when that definition is read, as it should, as a whole. This is of course without prejudice that States are not obliged in international law to have recourse to any particular technical method, such as the \"contracting out\" procedure, to avoid assuming any kind of conventional obligations, in particular jurisdictional obligations.\n\n282.\n\nThe conclusion is therefore obvious. Even if a given asset falls within one of the types enumerated in the non-exhaustive list of examples (which is not the case with the pertinent \"sovereign bonds\" and \"security entitlements\") this fact does not transform it into an \"investment\" protected by the BIT, unless the asset in question do correspond to the definition of that term in the *chapeau* of Article 1(1) of the Argentina-Italy BIT. In other words, a given asset, even when falling within one of the types enumerated in lit. (a) to (f), is considered to be an \"investment\" protected by the BIT *provided that the asset concerned falls likewise within the definition of the chapeau.*\n\n**(b) The text of the definition of \"investment\" in the** ***chapeau*** **of Article 1(1) of the BIT and its interpretation**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n283.\n\nThe purchasing transactions of the present case are not a contribution or asset invested or reinvested by the Claimants *in the territory* of the Argentine Republic, *in accordance with the laws and regulations of the latter* and, consequently, are not susceptible of falling within the definition of the term \"investment\" provided for in the *chapeau* of Article 1(1) of the BIT which reads as follows :\n\n\"1. The term 'investment' shall mean, in conformity with the legal system of the host State and independently from the legal form adopted or from any other connected legal system, any contribution or asset invested or reinvested by physical or juridical persons of one Contracting Party in the territory of the other, in accordance with the laws and regulations of the latter.\"\n\n284.\n\nThe ordinary meaning of the terms of definition of the *chapeau* do not allow concluding that the selling of sovereign bonds and the purchase of related security entitlements at stake in the present case qualify as \"investments\", either individually or jointly, in the sense of the definition of Article 1(1) of the Argentina-Italy BIT. This explains in turn why the Majority Decision *avoids conducting a true contextual analysis on the existence in the present case of an investment falling under the BIT's definition taking as a whole,* as well as its silence on the facts that Argentina-Italy BIT defines in Article 1(2) the term \"investor\" by reference likewise to \"investments in the territory of the other Contracting Party\" and that in Article 1(4) defines the term \"territory\" for the purpose of the Agreement as follows:\n\n\"The term 'territory' means, in addition to areas within land and maritime boundaries, maritime zones, meaning marine and submarine zones over which the Contracting Parties have sovereignty, sovereign rights or exercise jurisdiction, in conformity with their respective laws and international law\".\n\n285.\n\nThe Majority Decision errs when it approaches the determination of the meaning and scope of the term \"*obligaciones/obbligazioni*\" of lit. (c) as if this subparagraph would be a self-contained or autonomous provision for interpretation purpose. Subparagraph lit. (c) is part and parcel of a wider provision which states explicitly and unequivocally that the subparagraph is to be understood *within the general context* of the definition of the term \"investment\" giving in the *chapeau* of Article 1(1). An interpretative undertaking ignoring the immediate context of subparagraph lit. (c) represented by the *chapeau* of Article 1(1) of the BIT and the definitions of the terms \"investor\" and \"territory\" in Article 1(2) and (4) of the BIT respectively- as commanded by Article 31 of the VCLT - cannot yield a correct good faith interpretation of the ordinary meaning of the term \"*obligaciones/obbligazioni*\" in Article 1(1) (c).\n\n286.\n\nIt goes without saying that these considerations apply to all and each of the terms and expressions in every specific asset type listed either in Article 1(1) (c) of the BIT or in its subparagraphs lit. (a), (b), (d), (e), and (f). Consequently, the efforts deployed by the Majority Decision to find some support for its misreading of Article 1(1) by invoking the expressions \"any other right to benefits or services with a economic value\" or \"any right of an economic nature granted by law or contract\" (in lit. (c) and (f) respectively) likewise lead nowhere. The ordinary meaning of these expressions must be also determined taking duly into account the same immediate *context,* namely the *chapeau,* as in the case of the term \"*obligaciones*\"/\"*obbligazioni*\" of lit. (c).\n\n287.\n\nFurthermore, an interpreter who applies Article 31 of the VCLT is not supposed either to declare to be \"fully convinced that the bonds/security entitlements pertinent to the present case fall into the scope of application laid down in Art. 1(1)(a)-(f) of the Argentine-Italy BIT\" as the Majority Decision does239*before* ascertaining the ordinary meaning of the terms in the *chapeau* of Article 1(1) not only in their *context* but also *in the light of the object and purpose of the BIT*.\n\n*Ibid*, para. 495.\n\n288.\n\nThen, the Preamble of the 1990 Argentina-Italy BIT states expressly that by concluding the BIT the Contracting Parties **:** (i) desire \"to create favourable conditions for greater *economic cooperation* between the two States and, in particular, *for the making of investments by investors of one Contracting Party in the territory of the other***;** (ii) consider that the only way of establishing and maintaining an adequate flow of capital is to ensure a climate that is conducive *to investments respecting the law of the host State\"* ; and (iii) recognize that they were entering into the BIT, because \"the encouragement and reciprocal protection of investments will help *to stimulate entrepreneurial initiatives* which will contribute to the prosperity of the two Contracting Parties\" (*emphasis supplied*).\n\n289.\n\nThus, the object and purpose intended by Argentina and Italy when concluding their 1990 BIT was essentially the development of economic cooperation *through the stimulation of entrepreneurial initiatives* under the form of investments made by investors of one of the Contracting Party in the territory of the other and in accordance with the laws and regulations of the latter. The object and purpose of the BIT, as well as the context of lit (c), confirm beyond any doubt that the aim of the BIT is the development of investments entailing economic activities of an entrepreneurial character in the territory of the other Contracting Party and not portfolio investments or the acquisition of mere financial products without any rapport whatsoever with a project, enterprise or activity of the private investor national of one Contracting Party in the territory of the host Party of the investment.\n\n290.\n\nThe reasoning leading the Majority Decision to conclude otherwise results apparently from assuming that each of the specific types of investments listed in Article 1(1) of the BIT would have an ordinary meaning of its own independent of the context represented by the definition of the term \"investment\" in the *chapeau* of Article 1(1) and the definitions of the terms \"investor\" and \"territory\" in Article 1(2) and (4), as well as of the object and purpose of the BIT deduced from its Preamble. It is indeed on the basis of that false assumption that the Majority Decision concludes that the sovereign bonds and the security entitlement at stake are investments protected by the Argentina-Italy BIT. But, it cannot be so because that conclusion does not result from an interpretation conducted in conformity with Article 31 the VCLT, good faith principle included. The *very text* of Article 1(1) excludes that the Contracting Parties could have intended that for interpretation purpose the asset type of subparagraph (c) be insulated from its immediate context and the object and purpose of the BIT.\n\n291.\n\nBy making an autonomous and free interpretation on lit. (c), the Majority Decision necessarily errs in its conclusion because proceeding in that manner amounts to disregarding altogether the following paramount comment of the International Law Commission concerning the third basic principle built within Article 31(1) of the VCLT (former 27(1) in the ILC draft articles): \"The third principle is one of both of common sense and good faith **;** the ordinary meaning of a term is not to be determined in the abstract but in the context of the treaty and in the light of its object and purpose\".240\n\nUN Publication on the Law of Treaties, *supra* note 175, p. 40, para. 12.\n\n**(c) Requirements qualifying the expression \"contribution or asset invested or reinvested by physical or juridical persons of one Contracting Party\" of the** ***chapeau*** **of Article 1(1) of the BIT**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**(i) General considerations**\n------------------------------\n\n292.\n\nThe erroneous interpretative approach of the Majority Decision to the determination of the scope of the term of \"investment\" in Article 1(1) of the 1990 Argentina-Italy BIT finds confirmation when, in a second move, the majority deals with the core issue of the interpretation of the *requirements* qualifying in the *chapeau* the *\"contribution or assets invested or reinvested\"* (*aporte o bien invertido o reinvertido; conferimento o bene investito o reinvestito*) by providing for the investment be made by the foreign private investor (i) in the territory of the other State Party to the BIT and (ii) in accordance with the laws and regulations of the latter State.\n\n293.\n\nNone of these two requirements is met by the \"investments\" allegedly made by the Claimants in the present case. However, by means of a coarse reasoning the majority reaches the opposite conclusion on both accounts.241 I am of course of a different opinion. But the point of interest at the moment is not my views, but to inquire how the majority could have reached its conclusions by means of an interpretation supposedly done in conformity with the VCLT rules on interpretation of treaties. The mystery however does not last much, because the present Majority Decision proceeded without concealment, once more, to follow the interpretative methodology of the 2011 *Abaclat* majority decision which places itself in a universe other that the law of treaties of public international law.\n\nMajority Decision, paras. 510 and 519.\n\n294.\n\nTo find in the present Majority Decision's reasoning some traces of the principles and rules adopted by the VCLT to the effect that the text must be presumed to be the authentic expression of the intention of the parties or that the starting point of the interpretation of a treaty is the elucidation of the meaning of the text (not an investigation of any eventual original or posterior floating intentions) would be a vain undertaking. And it is so in spite of the fact that the text of the definition in the *chapeau* of Article 1(1) of the BIT does not have any major ambiguity or obscurity to the point that it seems one of those treaty texts which gives a sense to the maxim *in claris non fit interpretatio.*\n\n295.\n\nIn fact, the Majority Decision decided to rewrite in the present case the requirements qualifying the expression \"contribution or asset invested or reinvested\" in Article 1(1) of the BIT by means of a construction based upon two wrong propositions: (i) the invocation out of context of the term \"*obligaciones/obbligazioni*\" in lit. (c); and (ii) the recourse to elements extrinsic to the general rule of interpretation of treaties of Article 31 of the VCLT. It is indeed difficult to understand otherwise the number of departures from the law of treaties of the Majority Decision in the present context. However, the paramount goal of the majority - namely that \"all requirements of the jurisdiction *ratione materiae* are satisfied with regard to the pertinent bonds and security entitlements\"242 cannot be reached in an ICSID arbitration but through the application of the relevant law, public international law in the instant environment.\n\n*Ibid*, para. 520.\n\n296.\n\nIn this respect, the present Majority Decision is but one example - among others in the field of investment disputes between foreign private investors and host States, of purportedly interpretative decisions of treaty provisions declared to be done in conformity with the VCLT interpretation rules, which in fact are due to policy oriented conclusions adopted with the subjective value aim in mind of extending the maximum protection to foreign private investments, as well as to the greatest number of purported investors, even beyond the texts of the applicable instruments and irrespective of the scope of the host State's consent to jurisdiction as recorded in the standing arbitration offer set out in the corresponding BIT. A good illustration of the described approach is the reasoning underlying the following passage of the present Majority Decision :\n\n\"In regard to the bonds/security entitlements at stake, the only alternative conclusion (to an investment's *situs* in Argentina) to be drawn would be to state that those have their *situs* nowhere, as the Respondent could not point out any other jurisdiction that would have closer links to the investments at issue. This would, however, imply that those investments fall out of the protection of investment law completely. However, as far as the present Tribunal is concerned, such position cannot be reconciled with the obvious intent of the Parties, when concluding the Argentina-Italy BIT, to make Art. 1(1) of the BIT cover various types of obligations, including financial instruments such as bonds/security entitlements, in view of which they must have been aware that those would often have a *situs* not as clearly identifiable as that of a mine or industrial plant\".243\n\n*Ibid*, para. 509.\n\n297.\n\nI must confess that I encounter considerable difficulties to understand the above reasoning in a public international law context. It reflects a tendency observable in some ICSID case-law in which when confronted with a subject-matter of a claim falling outside of the applicable law instead of dismissing the case, arbitrators make all kind of efforts to avoid doing so by creating meaning in the application of the law rather than to discover it through an interpretation of the BIT done in accordance with the general rule of interpretation of treaties of Article 31 of the VCLT.244 The best legal answer to that kind of so-called interpretative conclusions is to quote again from the following self-explanatory commentary of the ILC to its draft articles on the law of treaties :\n\n\"[...] the jurisprudence of the International Court contains many pronouncements from which it is permissible to conclude that the textual approach to treaty interpretation is regarded by it as established law. In particular, the Court has more than once stressed that it is not the function of interpretation to revise treaties or to read into them what they do not, expressly or by implication, contained\".245\n\nM. Koskenniemi, *From Apology to Utopia: The Structure of International Legal Argument,* (University of Helsinki, 1989), p. 415; See also *Wintershall*, *supra* note 9, para. 185.\n\nUN Publication on the Law of Treaties, *supra* note 175, at para. 11.\n\n**(ii) The investment shall be made \"in the territory\" of the other Contracting Party**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n298.\n\nFollowing a reasoning similar to the *Abaclat* tribunal, the Majority Decision in the present case begins its consideration of the territoriality requirement by affirming, dogmatically, that given the character of the investments at stake (namely, its own erroneous conclusion that the pertinent bonds and security entitlements are \"investments\" under Article 1(1) of the Argentina-Italy BIT), the decisive criterion to determine the fulfilment of the territoriality requirement cannot be the *physical location in Argentina* of the purportedly contributions concerned *.*\n\n299.\n\nThus, instead of declaring the obvious - namely that the pertinent sovereign bonds and security entitlements do not fulfil the territorial requirement of the \"investment\" protected by the BIT - the Majority Decision simply decided to look for an alternative criterion susceptible of bypassing the territoriality requirement of the BIT so as to make fitting therein the financial products concerned, notwithstanding the fact that *the term \"territory\" of each Contracting Party for the purpose of the BIT is defined in Article 1(4) in physical/ legal land and maritime terms which excludes virtual construction of the concept of \"territory\" as the one made by the Majority Decision.* For the 1990 Argentina-Italy BIT \"territory\" for the purpose of the Agreement means: (i) areas within land and maritime boundaries of one of the Contracting Parties; and (ii) maritime zones, namely marine and submarine zones, over which one of the Contracting Parties has sovereignty, sovereign rights or exercise jurisdiction, in conformity with their respective laws and international law.\n\n300.\n\nLooking for one alternative to the territoriality requirement as defined in Article 1(1) and (4) of the Argentina-Italy BIT, the Majority Decision finds that *in the case of* the pertinent sovereign bonds and security entitlements it suffices that \"funds were made available to the Respondent that were at its disposal to foster its economic development, and this notably suffices to qualify the investment at stake as one made 'in the territory' of Argentina\", rejecting that the funds in question can be traced to a specific project, enterprise or activity in the host State territory.246 In support of this conclusion, the majority invokes the first paragraph of the Preamble of the ICSID Convention, although in fact it seems to follow *Abaclat's* reasoning that *the relevant question* \"is where the invested funds ultimately made available to the host State and did they support the latter's economic development\".247 All this is reminiscent of the most extremist subjectivist views mentioned in connection with the interpretation of the concept of \"investment\" in Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention, in particular of Delaume and Manciaux *.* As to the substance of the argument, one may find in the case-law pronouncements to the effect that the contribution of an international investment to the *development* of the host State is impossible to ascertain - the more so as there are highly diverging views on what constitutes \"development\" (see *Phoenix Action* award, para. 85).\n\nMajority Decision, paras. 496 and 503-05.\n\n*Abaclat*, *supra* note 4, para. 374. *See* Majority Decision, paras. 499, 502 and 505.\n\n301.\n\nIn whatever hypothesis, this alternative criterion or criteria are imported by the Majority Decision from the general discussion on the concept of \"investment\" in Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention, a discussion alien to the text of the definitions in Article 1(1) and (4) of the Argentina-Italy BIT. As such, it has no role to play in an interpretation of the wording of these definitions. Furthermore, that wording of Article 1(1) is crystal clear (contribution or asset invested or reinvested \"in the territory\" of the other Contracting Party) and, further, it is not in need of an interpretation because as indicated the term \"territory\" is in turn defined also in Article 1(4) of the same BIT. In such a situation, the task of an international arbitrator is to give effect, to applied, the two said definitions of the BIT as formulated in the text of this conventional bilateral instrument and not to do otherwise, namely to revising or amending *motu propio* the text of Article 1(1) and (4) of the Argentina-Italy BIT. I regret indeed to put on record that the Majority Decision has invoked the Argentina-Italy BIT against an objective concept of \"investment\" in Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention and, in the present context, a given subjective concept that Convention's term against the ordinary meaning of the terms \"investment\" and \"territory\" as respectively defined by the text of the Argentina-Italy BIT. A further shortcoming of the position of the Majority Decision in the matter is that it follows that the terms \"in the territory\" would have different meanings depending on the nature of the case or claim. Then, there is nothing in the text of the 1990 Argentina-Italy BIT manifesting such a common intention of the Contracting Parties when concluding the BIT.\n\n302.\n\nIt is a matter of fact that all along the Argentina-Italy BIT the term \"investment\" appears systematically qualified by the words \"in the territory\" of the other Contracting Party understood in the *physical/legal sense* of the definition of \"territory\" in Article 1(4) of the BIT, as illustrated by the following sentences **:** \"for the making of investments by investors of one Contracting Party in the territory of the other\" (first para. of the Preamble of the BIT) **;** \"make investments in the territory of the other Contracting Party\" (Article 1(2)) **;** \"each Contracting Party shall encourage the making of investment in its territory\" (Article 2) **;** \"each Contracting Party, within the ambit of its territory, shall accord to the investments made by investors of the other Contracting Party\" (Article 3) **;** \"the Contracting Party in whose territory the investment was made\" (Article 4) **;** \"risks for investment made by (the) investors (of one Contracting Party's) in the territory of the other Party (Article 7) **;** \"the Contracting Party in whose territory the investment is located\" (Article 8) **;** and \"in whose territory the investment was made\" (Additional Protocol (1)) **.**\n\n303.\n\nThere cannot be any doubt that the protection given by the Argentina-Italy BIT to the \"investment\" of private investors nationals of the other Contracting Party concerns those made *\"in the territory\" (as defined in the BIT itself)* of the host State Party exclusively, and not further or otherwise. The territoriality requirement is indeed one of the most outstanding features of the Argentina-Italy BIT taking as a whole (as in NAFTA and other BITs). Being expressly and clearly manifested in the text of the BIT, the territoriality requirement as defined therein cannot be put aside in an interpretation of the common intention of Argentina and Italy on the issue of the \"protected investments\" when they concluded the BIT.248\n\nIn this respect the 1990 Argentina-Italy BIT is quite similar to the relevant NAFTA provisions.\n\n304.\n\nIn this respect, it should be recalled that in the relations between Argentina and Italy the rules on interpretation of treaties of Articles 31 to 33 of the 1969 VCLT apply not only as codified customary rules of international law but also *qua* conventional rules because both countries are Parties to the VCLT and the BIT was concluded in 1990, namely after the entry into force in 1980 of the VCLT. Thus, even if someone would consider that in customary international law the term \"territory\" might have according to the circumstances of the case various meanings, the definition of Article 1(4) of the BIT would prevail in the relations between Argentina and Italy by virtue of the \"special meaning\" rule of Article 31(4) of the VCLT.\n\n305.\n\nTo the above, the Majority Decision adds a further element extrinsic to the text in its interpretation of the territoriality requirement embodied in the text of Article 1(1) of the Argentina-Italy BIT, namely the alleged \"unified economic operation of the bonds issuing process\" considered at the beginning of Chapter III of this Opinion.249 According to the Majority Decision, the Respondent would have devised the circulation of security entitlements on the secondary market as a means to raise money for the budgetary needs of Argentina when it undertook to issue the bonds in question in the primary market in agreement with the underwriters. Confronted with this kind of explanation, the reader is entitled again to ask himself whether the Majority Decision is actually engaged in an interpretation of the BIT or in something else without rapport with a treaty interpretative operation undertaken in accordance with the VCLT interpretation rules.\n\nMajority Decision, paras. 500-02.\n\n306.\n\nIn support of the above unified economic operation argument, the Majority Decision rejects the need to prove that the funds or contributions in question can be traced to a \"specific project, enterprise or activity\" in the host State's territory frequently referred to in ICSID case-law in connection with the concept of \"investment\" in Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention. For the Majority Decision \"nowhere in the Argentina- Italy BIT\" can such a \"specificity requirement\" be found as complementing the requirement of territoriality.250 This is correct, but it is quite irrelevant because the subject-matter in the present context is the Argentina-Italy BIT, not the ICSID Convention. This shows once more the Majority Decision's difficulties in a sincere admission of the *\"double-barrelled\"* test. The present Tribunal is supposed to interpret and apply two conventional instruments with different parties, not a single one.\n\n*Ibid*, para. 503.\n\n307.\n\nFollowing the Claimants, the Majority Decision refers in relation with the present issue to the 1997 *Fedax* decision. This reference calls also for some clarifications. In the first place, *Fedax* did not mix up the interpretation of the ICSID Convention and the interpretation of the applicable BIT. On the scope of Article 25(1) of the Convention, the *Fedax* tribunal considered that since promissory notes were evidence of a loan and a rather typical financial and credit instrument, there was nothing to prevent their purchase from qualifying as an investment under the Convention *in the particular circumstances of the case* and, further, that this conclusion *had* *to be examined next in the contest of the specific consent of the parties and other provisions which are controlling in the matter*. Later on, the tribunal considered the relevant terms and provisions of the Netherlands-Venezuela BIT which, as stated, was the specific bilateral investment treaty governing the consent to arbitration by the latter Contracting Party. It is at this point, and in reply to Venezuela's argument to the contrary, that the *Fedax* tribunal did declare that \"while it is true that *in some kinds of investments listed under Article 1(a) of the Agreement,* such as the acquisition of interests in immovable property, companies and the like, a transfer of funds or value will be made into the territory of the host State, *this does not necessarily happen* *in a number of other types of investments, particularly those of a financial nature*\"251 (*emphasis supplied*).\n\n*Fedax*, *supra* note 128, paras. 29 and 41.\n\n308.\n\nBut, this declaration of the *Fedax* tribunal related to a BIT, the Netherlands-Venezuela BIT, whose definition of the term \"investment\" in its Article 1(a) did not incorporate the territoriality requirement (\"in the territory of\" the other Contracting Party), as does Article 1(1) of the Argentina-Italy BIT. However, notwithstanding this fact, the *Fedax* tribunal felt the need of concluding the reasoning on the point underlining that the promissory notes in question were issued in Venezuela and were expressly governed by the Venezuelan Law on Public Credit aimed at obtaining domestic and foreign credit for work and services in the Republic of Venezuela and that the type of investment at stake was not volatile capital. It should also be added that Article 1(a) of the Netherlands-Venezuela BIT included between the listed types of investments covered \"titles to money\". None of those circumstances are present in the instant case *.*\n\n309.\n\nThe Respondent has repeatedly explained in its written pleading and at the hearing the mechanism followed by the pertinent bond issuances of the Argentine Republic and submitted also quite a number of expert reports. Claimants, on the other hand, did not reject Argentina's description of the mechanism for the issuance, ownership and circulation of security entitlements. But, the Majority Decision avoids entering into a legal analysis of this valuable information and related documentary evidence on the essential inherent features of typical transactions in contemporary capital or security markets.252\n\nSee Argentine's Reply Memorial, paras. 203 to 209 and its Post-Hearing brief, paras. 125-133.\n\n310.\n\nWithout an appropriate analysis of the legal and factual features underlying the economic operations involved in the present case, the conclusion of the Majority Decision that the very fact of the issuance and circulation process of bonds by Argentina would imply that funds were made available to or at the disposal of the Respondent \"to foster its economic development\" and that this \"notably suffices to qualified the investment at stake as one made 'in the territory' of Argentina\"253 appears as a mere rhetoric declaration without evidentiary support. At no moment, Claimants were able to prove through submitted evidence that the money paid out to Italian banks for the pertinent \"security entitlements\" were destined to \"contribute to Argentina's economic development and *were actually made available to it for that purpose*\" (*emphasis supplied*), as stated by the Majority Decision,254 which would seem to rely in the matter on *Abaclat* majority decision and some commentators' general views.\n\nMajority Decision, para. 504.\n\n*Ibid*, para. 508.\n\n311.\n\nIn any case, the relevant facts are: (i) that a territorial link of the pertinent \"security entitlements\" transactions in the Italian retail market between Italians with Argentina is inexistent; (ii) that the contributions of the Italian Claimant purchasers of those entitlements from Italian banks in Italy is too remote of a transaction to satisfy the element of a positive effect on the economic development of the Argentine Republic; (iii) that it has not been proven that the Claimants made available to the Argentine Republic in its territory or in any other place any kind funds as a result of their purchase of the said \"security entitlements\", (iv) that there was no proof either that the Claimants intended or actually did support the economic development of the Argentine Republic through the purchase of the \"security entitlements\" in Italy; (v) that the selling by the Respondent of \"sovereign bonds\" in the international primary market to underwriter banks as a means of borrowing liquidity for the financing of the general budgetary needs of the Argentine Republic is a financial transaction alien to the Claimants; (vi) that the Argentine Republic got from the buyer underwriter banks an agreed price for the \"sovereign bonds\" issued by it; and (vii) that it has not been proven either by the Claimants that the amounts that they pay out to the Italian banks in Italy when purchasing the \"security entitlements\" were done in any whatsoever connection with an investment undertaking or project in the territory of the Argentine Republic or in the framework of such an undertaking or project. Thus, the statement below of the *LESI-Dipenta v. Algeria* tribunal is not applicable either to the Claimants in the present case:\n\n\"[...] investments are often effected *in the country* concerned, but this is also not an absolute condition, nothing prevents investments from being undertaken at least in part from the country where the investors resides, as long as this is done in the framework of a project to be implemented abroad\".255\n\n*LESI-Dipenta v. Algeria*, para. 14 (original in French; unofficial translation into English); *see also* para. 259 of this Opinion.\n\n312.\n\nIn the process of interpretation of a BIT, international law does not allow interpreters to replace a mutually agreed definition in the text of the BIT reflecting the Contracting Parties' agreement of the activities constituting a \"protected investment\" by something else, namely by definitions *\u00e0 la carte* by the interpreters. In the choice by the Majority Decision of elements to conclude, as it does, that the pertinent transactions were not \"ordinary commercial transactions\", it would seem that the very nature of the \"financial products\" at stake has played a primary role *.* Matters being so, it is in order to underline again that the circumstances of the present case do not provide grounds for concluding the presence of facts allowing the application of the \"overall operation standard\" elaborated by the relevant ICSID case-law. The examples of the application of the notion of an \"integrated economic operation\" reveal two or more components in which the financial one does not qualify alone as an investment under the applicable BIT or contract, but the overall operation does. In the present case there are unconnected financial transactions all of them made outside the territory of the Argentine Republic. The present facts do not pose either an issue of \"indirect investments\" as in the *Fedax* case.\n\n313.\n\nUnder the Argentina-Italy BIT it would seem possible that a mere financial contribution or asset could qualify as a \"protected investment\" if either it is directly invested or reinvested in the territory of the other Contracting Party or when it has a \"legal/material connection\" with a related project, enterprise or entrepreneurial activity unfolding in territory of that Contracting Party. However, in the present case, the Claimants did not invest or reinvest their contributions in the territory of Argentina or outside its territory but in connection with a project, enterprise or entrepreneurial activity in the territory of Argentina. In those circumstances the applicability of the notion of \"integrated economic operation\" to the case is not only arguable, it is inapplicable.\n\n314.\n\nIt should also be noted that when the *Abaclat* majority decision declares (in paragraph 374 of the decision) that the relevant question on the territoriality requirement is whether the invested funds were ultimately made available to the host State and whether they did support the latter's economic development, it was referring to the meaning of the notion of \"investment\" in Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention. But, the present Majority Decision, taking liberties with the Vienna interpretation rules, quoted that *Abaclat* conclusion on the point out of context, namely in connection with the interpretation of the words \"in the territory of the other Contracting Party\" of the definition of the term \"investment\" in Article 1(1) of the Argentina-Italy BIT.256 Context must be respected because, *inter alia*, a change of the \"context\" may modify the ordinary meaning to be attributed to a given term of a conventional instrument.\n\n*Ibid*, paras. 502 and 505.\n\n315.\n\nNo ICSID arbitral tribunal, with the exception of *Abaclat*, has so far made its own definition of the territoriality requirement prevail over the ordinary meaning of the terms \"in the territory\" in the definition of \"investment\" and \"territory\" of a given BIT. In any case, the conclusions to be drawn from the four case-law examples referred to in footnote 247 of the Majority Decision257 do not buttress at all its conclusion on the territorial requirement, but rather the other way around. Regarding *Fedax,* as already indicated, the definition of the applicable BIT did not incorporate the territoriality requirement. The other three cases mentioned by the Majority Decision do not support either its conclusions on the question considered:\n\n- So far as to the 1999 *CSOB v. the Slovak Republic* case, the CSOB invoked as the basis of jurisdiction the 1992 Slovak Republic - Czech Republic BIT and the 1993 Agreement on the Basic Principles of a Financial Consolidation of CSOB A.S. (Consolidation Agreement) that Claimant contends to incorporate by reference in the BIT. Article 1(1) of the BIT sets out that the \"investment\" as defined herein was to be \"in the territory of the other Party\". The Consolidated Agreement establishes Collection Companies in two Republics. The Slovak Collection Company and CSOB concluded a Loan Agreement on 31 December 1993. Claimant alleged that the Slovak Republic had breached the obligation of repayment of a CSOB loan assumed by virtue of that Loan Agreement. The Slovak Republic argued that the CSOB loan did not meet any of the elements of the definition of an investment, including the said territorial requirement. But, the tribunal considers that the basic and ultimate goal of the Consolidate Agreement was *to ensure a continuing and expanding activity of CSOB in both* *Republics. This undertaking taken as a whole involved a significant contribution by CSOB to the economic development of the Slovak Republic including the spending or out-lays of* *resources in the Slovak Republic in response to the need for the development of the Republic's banking infrastructure* (para *.* 88 of the decision). On that basis, the tribunal concluded that *CSOB's activity in the Slovak Republic and its undertaking to ensure a sound banking structure in that country* compel the conclusion that CSOB qualifies as the holder of an asset invested or obtained in the territory of the Slovak Republic within the meaning of Article 1(1) of the applicable BIT (para. 89 of the decision).\n\n- In the 2003 *SGS v. Pakistan* decision, Pakistan objected to jurisdiction *inter alia* because the SGS's activities pursuant to the \"Pre-Shipment Inspection Agreement\" (PSI) did not constitute an investment \"in the territory\" of Pakistan within the meaning of Article 2(1) of the BIT between the Swiss Confederation and the Republic of Pakistan. The tribunal found that the PSI defined the commitments of SGS in such a way as to ensure that SGS, if it was to comply with them, had to make certain expenditures in the territory of Pakistan. While the expenditures may be relative small they did involve the \"injection of funds into the territory of Pakistan for the carrying out of SGS's engagements under the PSI Agreement\" (para. 136 of the decision). The claimant adduced evidence of expenditures it had incurred in Pakistan to establish and operate liaison offices in Pakistan necessary to enable it to perform its obligations under the PSI Agreement. Accordingly, the tribunal concluded that these expenditures made by SGS pursuant to the PSI Agreement constituted an investment within the meaning of the BIT.\n\n- Concerning the 2004 *SGS v. Philippines* decision, Article II of the BIT between the Swiss Confederation and the Republic of Philippines provided that the present Agreement shall apply to investments \"in the territory\" of the other Contracting Party. The territorial requirement was also referred to in other provisions of the BIT. The arbitral tribunal declared that \"*in accordance with normal principles of treaty interpretation, investments made outside* *the territory of the Respondent State, however beneficial to it, would not be covered by the BIT*\" (para. 99 of the decision). The tribunal agreed with the relevant reasoning of the SGS v. Pakistan decision, considering that in its own case such reasoning was ever more justified given the scale and duration of SGS's activities in Philippines and the significance of the Manila Liaison Office. The tribunal concluded on the point that \"there was no distinct or separate investment made elsewhere than in the territory of Philippines but a single integrated process of inspection arranged through the Manila Liaison Office, itself unquestionable an investment 'in the territory of' the Philippines\" (para. 112 of the decision).\n\n*Ibid*, para. 502, footnote 259.\n\n316.\n\nThe selling of the sovereign bonds issued by Argentina to the placing banks or underwriters in the international primary market and the buying in the Italian retail market by the Claimants of security entitlements in Argentina sovereign bonds holding by the Italian banks are transactions perfectly distinguished from each other on both economic and legal accounts and none of them complied with the territoriality requirement of Article 1(1) of the Argentina-Italy BIT. Sovereign bonds are intangible capital flows without physical implantation in a given host country's territory. Their transactions are in fact alien to the very notion of \"host State\" (notion which should not be confused with the determination for other purposes of the *situs* of a sovereign debt).\n\n317.\n\nThe regime of the Argentina-Italy BIT was designed to counterbalance the host State's regulatory authority over investments in its territory.258 But such a counterbalance does not make sense when the transactions concerned are made outside the territory of the Respondent State as is the case with both Argentina's selling of the sovereign bonds to the placing banks or underwriters and the Claimants' purchase of the security entitlements in Italy from the Italian banks holders and depository of the pertinent \"sovereign bonds\". This explains why none of these two kinds of transactions qualifies as a \"protected investment\" under the Argentina-Italy BIT.\n\nMichael Waibel, *Sovereign Defaults before the International Courts and Tribunals, supra* note 165, pp. 238-242.\n\n**(iii) The investment shall be made \"in accordance with the laws and regulations\" of the other Contracting Party**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n318.\n\nA further requirement contained in the *chapeau* of Article 1(1) of the Argentina-Italy BIT provides that a contribution or asset to qualify as an \"investment\" must be made \"in accordance with the laws and regulations\" of the other Contracting Party. The Majority Decision dismissed *in casu* the possibility of non-fulfilment by the Claimants of that requirement because \"no argument has been brought before the Tribunal that the bonds/security entitlements would have violated any provision of Argentine law\".259\n\nMajority Decision, para. 512.\n\n319.\n\nHowever, the Respondent had made some arguments to the contrary. First, that the Tribunal shall make its decision based *inter alia* on the laws of the Contracting Party involved in the dispute - including its rules on conflict of laws -, the provisions of the BIT, and the terms of any particular agreement entered into regarding the investment, as well as applicable principles of international law (Article 8(7) of the BIT). Secondly, the Respondent contends that Argentine law provides that the validity and nature of contracts executed outside Argentina shall be governed by the laws of the place where the contract was executed, i.e. Italy in the instant case. Thus, the non-compliance with Italian law governing the validity and nature of the transactions concerning the purchases in Italy by the Claimants of the \"security entitlements\" at hand would amount to non-compliance with Argentine laws.260\n\n*Ibid*, para. 513.\n\n320.\n\nConcerning the first of those two arguments, the Majority Decision following *Abaclat* concludes: (i) that Article 8(7) of the Argentina-Italy BIT deals *exclusively* with the law applicable to the merits of the dispute, but does not serve as a basis to extend the definition of investment as provided in Article 1(1) of the BIT; and (ii) that the question of jurisdiction is to be dealt *solely* on the basis of Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention, as opposed to Article 42 of the Convention which would be supposed to address the law applicable to the merits of the dispute.261 I admit that there is case-law and doctrine which support this conclusion, although I personally have some doubts. First, in the present context we are interpreting Article 8(7) of the Argentina-Italy BIT, not Articles 25 and/or 42 of the Convention. Secondly, I doubt as to the \"exclusively\" and the \"solely\". In any case, it cannot be questioned that, for example, for assessing the jurisdiction *ratione personae* (i.e. requirements of nationality and domicile), and perhaps in other specific issues, domestic laws play a determinative role in a preliminary jurisdictional phase and in a merits phase as well.\n\n*Ibid*, paras. 514-15.\n\n321.\n\nBy its above conclusion, the Majority Decision tried to give an answer to the second argument of the Respondent by taking out of the picture the purported illegalities committed by some Italian banks and financial intermediaries when they sold *in Italy* the pertinent security entitlements to the Claimants in disregard of the protection provided by the Italian laws and regulations to the buyers of sensible financial products. The Tribunal got from the parties some evidence of Italian courts' decisions terminating or annulling contracts concerning the purchase of \"security entitlements\" like to those of the present case. All this poses in international law as well as in domestic law a *bona fide* issue common to all law systems in relation to the Claimants' purchases of the \"security entitlements\" in Italy.\n\n322.\n\nThe Majority Decision declares however that it cannot see how such eventual violations of the Italian law could negatively affect a qualification of the security entitlements at stake as being purchased in accordance with the laws and regulations of Argentina. I am not so sure because the Italian banks and financial intermediaries might have refrained likewise from duly informing the Italian purchasers of the security entitlements of the information contained in the Argentine \"sovereign bonds\", and \"prospectus\" relating thereto, advising of the high risks involved in the acquisition of that kind of financial products and this could well constitute a sellers *bona fide* breach incompatible with the *ordre public* of the Argentine Republic. In such a hypothesis, the purchases in Italy of the \"security entitlements\" could not have been made in accordance with Argentine laws and regulations.262 Matters might well be so because the Claimants are not holders of the \"sovereign bonds\" with the corresponding information on the risks involved (which remained deposited in the banks) but of the so-called \"security entitlements\" which apparently do not contain therein information on the said risks.\n\n*Ibid*, paras. 516-18.\n\n323.\n\nIn the light of the considerations above, the conclusion of the Majority Decision is, in my opinion, premature because the issues at stake were not fully pleaded, so as to be in a position to reach an informed conclusion. It is also unconvincing as to the reasoning. In the first place because, in accordance with Argentine Law No. 21382, an \"investment of foreign capital\" is defined as \"any capital contribution made by foreign investors *and allocated to activities of an economic nature conducted in the country*\"263 (*emphasis supplied*). Then, Claimants' funds cannot be considered a foreign investment under that Argentina law because Claimants did not demonstrate that such funds were allocated to or use for activities of an economic nature conducted in Argentina, as confirmed by the conclusion of this Opinion on non-compliance with the territorial requirement of Article 1(1) of the Argentina-Italy BIT. Consequently, it cannot be declared as the Majority Decision does that the pertinent \"security entitlements\" (a financial product) have been made \"in accordance with the laws and regulations of Argentina\" as host State. In fact in the present case, the Respondent has not hosted anybody or anything.\n\nArgentine law No. 21382 (A RA 326) (quoted in the Argentine Republic's Reply Memorial, p. 149, footnote 473).\n\n324.\n\nFurthermore, the Majority Decision does not actually answer the good faith and legality arguments of the Respondent.264 The principles of good faith and legality are general principles of law common to international law and to Argentine law and Italian law. It is therefore unacceptable to affirm that eventual violations of those legal principles in the course of transactions on security entitlements in Argentine sovereign bonds which took place in Italy between Italians are irrelevant for Argentine law and/or for an international legal instrument like the Argentina-Italy BIT, both in jurisdictional and merits issues. Particularly so when, as in the present case, Argentine rules on conflicts of laws refer to the provisions of the Italian law and the \"sovereign bonds\" issued by Argentina advise potential buyers of the risks involved in its acquisition.\n\nArgentine Republic's Post-Hearing Brief, paras. 141-44.\n\n325.\n\nThe Argentina-Italy BIT, like all BITs, is supposed to protect *bona fide* investments only, incorporating the legality requirement in the very definition of the term \"investment\". As declared by the 2008 *Plama* award with reference to the Energy Charter Treaty: \"The Arbitral Tribunal concludes that the substantive protections of the ECT cannot apply to investments that are made contrary to the law\".265 Likewise, I agree with the statement in the 2009 *Phoenix Action* award to the effect that: \"The Tribunal has to prevent an abuse of the system of international investment protection under the ICSID Convention, in ensuring that only investments that are made in compliance with the international principle of good faith and do not attempt to misuse the system are protected\".266\n\n*Plama*, *supra* note 41, para. 139.\n\n*Phoenix Action*, *supra* note 168, para. 113. For other relevant decisions see *Inceysa Vallisoletana S.L. v. Republic of El Salvador* (ICSID Case No. ARB/03/26), Award of 2 August 2006.\n\n326.\n\nIf in a given jurisdictional/admissibility phase the *bona fide* and legality principles (as well as *ordre public*) are at issue but the tribunal has not enough arguments and evidence at its disposal to decide the question, the objection should be joined to the merits but not be dismissed *in limine,* as done by the Majority Decision in relation with the laws and regulations of the other Contracting Party requirement of Article 1(1) of the Argentina-Italy BIT.\n\n**6. Conclusion**\n-----------------\n\n327.\n\nAs all requirements concerning the jurisdiction *ratione materiae* under both the 1965 ICSID Convention and the 1990 Argentina-Italy BIT are not satisfied by the Claimants with respect to the sovereign bonds and security entitlements constituting the subject-matter of their claims, I would uphold the preliminary objections of the Respondent as to the lack of jurisdiction *ratione materiae*, and conclude that there is no jurisdiction of the Centre and, for that matter, competence of the present Tribunal to decide the legal dispute at hand.\n\n328.\n\nThe opposite conclusion of the Majority Decision is, generally speaking, the result of the erratic way of approaching the interpretation of the relevant provisions of the two conventional instruments involved. In addition, the methods followed by the Majority Decision for applying the VCLT rules on interpretation of treaties to Article 25(1) of the Convention and to Article 1(1) of the BIT differ from each other. In the case of Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention, the majority privileges elements extrinsic to the text (*travaux;* alleged floating intentions) in detriment to the ordinary meaning of the term \"investment\" of the text within its context and in the light of the object and purpose of the Convention *(subjective method).* But in so far as Article 1(1) of the BIT is concerned, the majority gives in the interpretation the greatest possible weight to one of the possible literal meanings of a single term in a given subparagraph of the Article (namely \"*obligaciones/obbligazioni*\") disregarding the ordinary meaning of that term within the context of the Article as a whole and in the light of the object and purpose of the BIT (*grammatical method*).\n\n329.\n\nThese two methods are alien to the rules of interpretation of treaties of customary international law codified by the 1969 VCLT which in the case of the BIT applies likewise between Argentina and Italy, as explained, *qua* conventional law. It is therefore in order to end the above considerations on the jurisdiction *ratione materiae* by quoting from a recent Case Comment that:\n\n\"[...] it is not to the Majority to adapt the ICSID framework out of concern for access to justice; that is for States to undertake if injustice is perceived.\"267\n\nHans van Houtte and Bridie McAsey, *'\"Case Comment. Abaclat and others v. Argentine Republic...*\", *supra* note 51, at p. 233, footnote 19.\n\n330.\n\nIn this latter respect the progressive development of international law is going on. In the present case, the Tribunal's attention was called to the \"Principles for Stable Capital Flows and Fair Debt Restructuring in Emerging Markets\" noted in 2005 by the Monetary and Financial Committee of the Board of Governors of the IMF.268 Since then, as it is in the public domain, UNCTAD launched in 2009 the initiative to formulate a set of global principles to promote responsible sovereign lending and borrowing practices, an initiative endorsed by the United Nations General Assembly, and in 2012 a consolidated version of the UNCTAD \"Principles on Promoting Responsible Sovereign Lending and Borrowing\" was achieved in Doha on the occasion of UNCTAD XIII, inaugurating the phase of endorsement and implementation of the Principles, whose principle 15 deals with unavoidable \"Restructuring\" of sovereign debts obligations in a state of economic necessity.269\n\nThe text of the Principles is attached to the \"Report on Implementation by the Principles Consultative Group\" (October 2007) (Argentina's Reply, Annex 351). *See also* (i) The Observations regarding the principles from the Argentine Minister of Economy (*Ibid*, Annex 352) and (ii) Anne O. Kueger and Sean Hagan, \"*Sovereign Workouts: An IMF perspective*\" (6 Chi.J.Int'L. 2005, p.203-218) (Argentina's Memorial, Annex 67).\n\n*See* : Carlos Esp\u00f3sito and Juan Pablo Bohoslavsky, *Principles Matter: Legal Status of UNCTAD's Principles on Responsible Sovereign Lending and Borrowing* in Sovereign Financing and International Law.

The text of the UNCTAD's Principles is annexed to the publication.\n\n**Chapter IV- The consent to arbitration of the Parties to the dispute**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n331.\n\nChapter VI of the Majority Decision entitled \"Compliance with Article 8 of the Argentina-Italy BIT- The prerequisites of amicable consultations and recourse to Argentine courts\", deals with preliminary objection (f) whereby the Respondent requested: \"in the alternative, determining that the Claimants have not satisfied the necessary requirements for bringing a claim under the Argentina -Italy BIT\". Under that Chapter the Majority considers together the question of the extent of the Respondent's consent (Article 8 of the BIT) and the extent of the Claimants' consent (Request for Arbitration) with respect to the various topics dealt with therein. In order to better ascertain whether or not both consents match each other to the point that it may be concluded that the \"agreement to arbitrate\" between the Parties to the dispute has been duly executed (see Chapter II (2) of the present Opinion), this Opinion deals separately in the present Chapter IV with each of the two consents in question as done sometimes by the ICJ (see, for example, the 2008 Judgment in the *Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters (Djibouti v. France)* case). Section 1 will be devoted to the extent of the Respondent's consent and Section 2 to the extent of Claimants' consent. The admissibility issues raised by Claimants' Request for Arbitration will be likewise considered in that Section 2 of the Opinion.\n\n**1. The consent of the Respondent State**\n------------------------------------------\n\n**(a) Some questions of public international law**\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n**(i) The international law rule of State's consent to jurisdiction**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n332.\n\nIn public international law, jurisprudence and doctrine are unanimous in considering that the rule of State's consent to jurisdiction applies to the determination of the existence of jurisdiction of any international court or tribunal, as well as to the scope of any jurisdiction accepted by a given State. Already in 1923, the Permanent Court of International Justice declared that: \"It is well established in international law that no State can, without its consent, be compelled to submit its disputes with other States either to mediation or to arbitration, or to any other kind of pacific settlement\".270\n\n*Status of Eastern Carelia*, Advisory Opinion, 1923 P.C.I.J. (ser. B) No. 5 (July 23), p.27.\n\n333.\n\nThe Permanent Court underlined likewise: that its own contentious jurisdiction only exists in so far as the respondent has given its consent;271 that the Court has a limited jurisdiction existing only in so far as States have accepted it;272 and that the contentious jurisdiction of the Court exists only within the limits which it has been accepted.273 The rule is described by this jurisprudence as a corollary of the sovereignty and independence of the States.274\n\n*Mavrommatis Palestine Concessions* (Greece v. U.K.), 1924 P.C.I.J. (ser. A) No. 2 (Aug. 30), p.16 *.*\n\n*Factory at Chorz\u00f3w* (Germany v. Poland), 1927 P.C.I.J. (ser. A) No. 9 (July 26), p.32 *.*\n\n*Phosphates in Morocco* (Italy v. France), 1938 P.C.I.J. (ser. A/B) No. 74 (June 14), p.23.\n\n*S.S. Lotus* (France v. Turkey), 1927 P.C.I.J. (ser. A) No. 10 (Sept. 7), p.18.\n\n334.\n\nOn every relevant occasion, the International Court of Justice has recalled that the rule of State's consent to jurisdiction is well established in international law, as well as that the Court can only exercise jurisdiction over a State with its consent;275 that the Court may not compel a State to appear before it, even by way of intervention;276 and that one of the fundamental principles of its Statute is that the Court cannot decide disputes between States without the consent of those States to its jurisdiction.277\n\n*Case of the Monetary Gold Removed from Rome in 1943 (Preliminary Question)*, (Italy v. France, United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, and United States of America) *,* I.C.J. Reports, 1954, p.32.\n\n*Certain Phosphate Lands in Nauru* (Nauru v. Australia), I.C.J. Reports 1992, p.260, para.53.\n\n*East Timor (Portugal v. Australia), Judgment,* I.C.J. Reports 1995 (\"*East Timor*\"), p.101, para.26.\n\n335.\n\nFor legal doctrine there exists an uncontroverted principle according to which no State is obliged by general public international law to submit any dispute, or to give an account of its own conduct thereon, to any international court or tribunal. It follows that as stated generally by authors like, for example, Rosenne: *\"* The agreement of the parties to the dispute is the prerequisite to adjudication on the merits\".278\n\nShabtai Rosenne, *Law and Practice of the International Court of Justice (1920-1996).* Vol. II (Jurisdiction), Martinus Nijhoff, 1997, p. 565.\n\n336.\n\nThe rule of State's consent to jurisdiction cannot be treated lightly by international judges or arbitrators when interpreting or applying instruments or compromissory clauses providing for dispute-resolution means because the rule has its roots in the very structure of the international legal order. It is a systemic rule forming part of the international legal environment of treaty instruments and clauses. As explained by Mani: \"Contemporary international law is essentially characterized by its decentralized, horizontal process of authoritative decision-making. A large part of its body juridic [sic] has emerged from the consent of States. Consent of States plays a vital role, particularly in the realm of dispute settlement. It remains the main-spring of all dispute settlement devices and even of the body of norms to be applied by them\".279\n\nV.S. Mani, *International Adjudication. Procedural Aspects,* (Martinus Nijhoff, 1980), p.xiii.\n\n337.\n\nThe customary international law principle of State's consent to jurisdiction requires from States that their respective consents be given by a positive and external manifestation of the acceptance of the jurisdiction of the international court or tribunal concerned, namely by a \"contracting in\" act or conduct. This important corollary of the State's consent to jurisdiction rule has to be underlined in the present case because arbitral tribunals on investment disputes, including ICSID arbitral tribunals, have argued, quite often, the other way around. They have considered, for example, that a respondent State gives its consent to the jurisdiction of the arbitral tribunal concerned through a MFN clause of a given BIT unless dispute-resolution has been \"contracted out\" of the MFN clause in question. Such kind of assumption is nonsensical in public international law because this legal order does not impose *per se* on sovereign independent States any \"international jurisdictional obligation\". The reversal of that natural order of things prevailing in the international legal order is doubtless the main legal shortcoming with respect to MFN clauses of *Maffezini* and like arbitral decisions in the investment disputes field.\n\n338.\n\nThe source of every jurisdictional obligation assumed by a State is always in customary or general international law the result of a *pacta* (undertaking, agreement, convention), without *pacta***,** or beyond the scope of the *pacta***,** there are no international jurisdictional obligations for the States. This is precisely why BITs contain generally provisions on dispute-resolution whereby the States Parties to the BIT consented by an explicit agreement in writing to the international jurisdiction of the ICSID and the competence of the arbitral tribunals established pursuant to the ICSID Convention (and/or to another agreed alternative arbitration system) with a view to the resolution of investment disputes between the host State of the investment and an investor national of the other State Party to the BIT. The jurisdiction or competence so accepted may be limited in scope and/or be subjected to prerequisites or conditions as well. As the ICJ has declared:\n\n\"[...] the Court has jurisdiction in respect of States only to the extent that they have consented thereto [....] When a compromissory clause in a treaty provides for the Court's jurisdiction, that jurisdiction exist only in respect to the parties to the treaty who are bound by that clause *and within the limits set out therein*\"280 (*emphasis supplied*).\n\n*Case Concerning Armed Activities on the Territory of the Congo (New Application: 2002), (Democratic Republic of Congo v. Uganda), Judgment*, I.C.J. Reports 2006, p. 32, para. 65.\n\n339.\n\nIn the aftermath of the reversal by *Maffezini* of the principle that the jurisdiction of any international court or tribunal does not exist in the international legal order unless so provided by an undertaking, agreement or convention to the contrary executed between the parties to the dispute, a number of arbitral decisions on investment disputes went still further than *Maffezini* through arguments such as, for example, the so-called \"forum consented\" argument or the invocation of the maxim *expressio unius est exclusio alterious* in connection with the interpretation of exceptions to MFN clauses in BITs, etc., so as to conclude at the existence of jurisdiction and competence in cases of obvious, or even admitted, non-compliance with the prerequisites defining the scope of the consent to international arbitration manifested by the Contracting Parties to the BIT in dispute-resolution provisions of the latter, as actually happened with the Majority Decision in the present case with its acceptance of the Claimants' *futility* argument (a *premi\u00e8re* in the field), under the form, apparently, of an *implied* condition in Article 8 of the Argentina-Italy BIT (defined with reference to the ILC draft articles on diplomatic protection). That argument prevails for the Majority over the *explicit* prerequisites to international arbitration set out by the Contracting States in that article of the BIT.\n\n340.\n\nBut, it is not the only novelty. Recently, the silence of dispute-resolution provisions in BITs on the effects of non-compliance with the prerequisites circumscribing the scope of the host State's consent to international arbitration set forth in the dispute-resolution provisions of a BIT has also been invoked by arbitral ICSID tribunals to uphold jurisdiction or admissibility where it was none of the two. The answer to such an extraordinary argument, within a public international law environment, has been given by Professor Abi-Saab in the following passage of his dissenting opinion in *Abaclat* : \"According to the general rules of law and rules of general international law non-compliance begets the inevitably legal sanction of dismissing the case, as falling outside the jurisdiction of the tribunal or as inadmissibly. Only if the parties want to waive or vary this sanction do they address the effect of non-compliance in the instrument. Otherwise, in case of silence, it is the rules of general international law that apply\".281\n\nProfessor Abi-Saab's dissenting opinion, *supra* note 37, para.28.\n\n341.\n\nThus, \"futility\" and \"silence of the dispute-resolution provisions on the effects of noncompliance\" have been added recently to the arsenal of arguments employed in ICSID arbitral proceedings to sidestep the international law rule of State's consent to jurisdiction. One may understand the recourse of claimants' counsel to such kind of arguments, but the extraordinary phenomenon to be noted is the fact that a number of ICSID arbitrators accept them, declaring jurisdiction irrespective of the existence or scope of State's consent to jurisdiction. The 2011 *Abaclat* majority decision went even further through a double exercise. First, it avoided altogether determinations on jurisdictional requirements and introduced instead admissibility criteria, by alleging (against the established jurisprudence of the ICJ) the existence of a difference between \"conditioning consent\" and \"conditioning the effective implementation of consent\". Secondly, by dismissing the alleged inadmissibility objections by the subjective means of weighting the specific interests at the stake of the host State and the private foreign investors as in the law on contracts of some domestic systems. These kinds of decisions take \"the liberty of striking out a clear conventional requirement, on the basis of purely subjective judgment\" as stated by Professor Abi-Saab's Dissenting Opinion in *Abaclat*.282\n\n*Ibid*, para. 30 and ff.\n\n342.\n\nThe light handling, by some ICSID arbitral tribunals, of the rule of State's consent to jurisdiction and its corollaries is a matter of surprise indeed because those tribunals affirm that the law they apply to dispose of objections on jurisdiction and/or admissibility falling under Article 41 of the ICSID Convention is international law exclusively, and not the provision of Article 42(1) of the Convention. Further, the rule of State's consent is part and parcel of the \"context\" that an interpreter of a given treaty \"shall take into account\" (mandatory language) in the interpretative process (Article 31(3)(c) of the VCLT) because it is a rule of general international law. Furthermore, in the instant phase of the present case it's obviously a \"relevant rule of international law\", as well as a rule \"applicable in the relations between Argentina and Italy\" on both accounts general international law and the VCLT itself applicable also in the relations between both countries *qua* conventional law with respect to their 1990 BIT.\n\n343.\n\nIt is also in order to recall that Article 31(3)(c) of the VCLT is sometimes invoked as providing support for \"evolving interpretations\" of treaty terms or expressions, after verifying the original intention of the parties to the instrument. However, in so far as \"jurisdictional conventional obligations\" evolving interpretation methods are unjustified unless expressly permitted or necessarily implied by the terms used by the text of the treaty or by general practice in its application, the reason being that the State's consent to jurisdiction rule is unfriendly to the validation of alleged \"implied consents\". Furthermore, in the present case it has not been plead, and still less proven, that the rule of State's consent to jurisdiction has evolved since the conclusion of the 1990 Argentina-Italy BIT. On the contrary, the rule has been confirmed in the most recent jurisprudence of the ICJ.283\n\nSee, for example, ICJ Judgment of 1 April 2011 in the *Case concerning Application of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (Georgia v. Russian Federation), Preliminary Objections,* I.C.J. Reports 2011 (\"*Application of the CERD*\") *.*\n\n344.\n\nIn sum, as concluded by the *ICS Inspection and Control Services* award of 10 February 2012 - within its consideration of a MFN clause invoked as a purportedly alternative base of jurisdiction - when, in the international legal order, the respondent State's consent to international arbitration is not sufficiently certain, jurisdiction cannot but be declined:\n\n\"This principle follows from the lack of a default forum for the presentation of claims under international law. Whereas the inherent jurisdiction or hermetic division of competence over claims before general courts is a common feature of municipal judicial systems, *the default* *position under public international law is the absence of forum before which to present claims.* The absence of a forum before which to present valid substantive claims is thus a normal state of affairs in the international sphere. A finding of no jurisdiction should not therefore be treated as a defect in a treaty scheme that runs counter to its object and purpose in providing for substantive investment protection\"284 (*emphasis supplied*).\n\n*ICS Inspection and Control Services*, *supra* note 12, para.281.\n\n345.\n\nLastly, the public international law rule of State's consent to jurisdiction applies *ne varietur* in ICSID international arbitral proceedings on investment disputes with private foreign investors concerning the determination of the existence and scope of the consent of the States participating in those proceedings. As recalled by the *Plama* decision: \"Nowadays, arbitration is the generally accepted avenue for resolving disputes between investors and states. Yet, that phenomenon does not take away the basic prerequisite for arbitration: an agreement of the parties to arbitrate. It is a well-established principle, both in domestic and international law, that such an agreement should be clear and unambiguous.285\n\n*Plama*, *supra* note 41, para.198.\n\n**(ii) State's consent to jurisdiction must be voluntary, certain and unequivocal whatever the form of its manifestation or the title or basis of jurisdiction invoked**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n346.\n\nIt is established jurisprudence of the ICJ and best doctrine that the State's consent to jurisdiction must be voluntary, certain and unequivocal. It is therefore difficult to understand the surprise of some commentators of ICSID arbitral decisions and awards when confronted with this uncontroversial corollary of the rule of State's consent to jurisdiction. To entertain doubts by defective drafting or other means is of no help for upholding jurisdiction in public international law but rather the other way around.\n\n347.\n\nThus, the existence of doubts about the reality or scope of a given State's consent favour generally defeating, not upholding, jurisdiction. Contemporaneous decisions of the ICJ have enriched its jurisprudence on the matter, as in the following passage of the 2006 Judgment of the Court in the *Armed Activities in the Territory of Congo (New Application 2002)* case *:*\n\n\"The Court recalls its jurisprudence, as well as that of its predecessor, the Permanent Court of International Justice, regarding the forms which the parties' expression of their consent to its jurisdiction may take. According to that jurisprudence, 'neither the Statute nor the Rules require that this consent should be expressed in a particular form' and 'there is nothing to prevent the acceptance of jurisdiction from being effected by two separate and successive acts, instead jointly and beforehand by a special agreement'[..] The attitude of the respondent State must, however, be capable of being regarded as 'an unequivocal indication' of the desire of that State to accept the Court's jurisdiction in a 'voluntary and indisputable' manner\".286\n\n*Supra* note 280 *,* p. 18, para. 21.\n\n348.\n\nThe requirement that a State's consent to the jurisdiction must be voluntary, certain and unequivocal applies consequently whatever the particular form adopted by the expression of the State's consent, the timing of its expression, the simultaneous or successive acceptance of the jurisdiction by the parties to the dispute, or the written or unwritten basis of the jurisdiction invoked. For example, in its 2008 Judgment on *Certain Questions of Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters (Djibouti v. France)*, a *forum prorogatum* case, the ICJ - after recalling once more that its jurisdiction is based on the consent of States under the conditions expressed therein - declared the following:\n\n\"The consent allowing the Court to assume jurisdiction must be certain. That is so, no more and no less, for jurisdiction based on *forum prorogatum*. As the Court has recently explained, *whatever the basis of consent*, the attitude of the respondent State must \"be capable of being regarded as 'an unequivocal indication' of the desire of that State to accept the Court's jurisdiction in a 'voluntary and indisputable' manner [...] For the Court to exercise jurisdiction on the basis of *forum prorogatum*, the element of consent must be either explicit or clearly to be deduced from the general conduct of a State\" (emphasis supplied).287\n\n*Judgment,* I.C.J. Reports 2008, p. 204, para. 62.\n\n349.\n\nThe requirement that the State's consent to jurisdiction must be voluntary, certain and unequivocal applies likewise in international arbitration whatever the basis of the jurisdiction invoked or the various written forms of expression of a State's consent to jurisdiction in international arbitration. But, as a general proposition the \"undertaking to arbitrate\" in international law must be embodied in a written instrument excluding thereby the possibility of invoking *forum prorogatum* as a basis of jurisdiction in international arbitration.288\n\nSee Preamble of the *Model Rules on Arbitral Procedure* codified in 1958 by the ILC.\n\n350.\n\nIn the particular ICSID system, Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention provides that *consent of the Parties to the dispute (host State as well as private foreign investor) must be* *submitted in writing to the Centre*, but without prescribing any particular written title or form of doing so. In all cases therefore the State's consent to jurisdiction in writing is needed for the jurisdiction of the Centre and the competence of the ICSID arbitral tribunals to be established and that consent must be voluntary, certain and unequivocal whatever the form or ways of its manifestation. Thus, the voluntary, certain and unequivocal requirement applies whatever may be the title or basis of jurisdiction alleged by a foreign private investor claimant, including of course to the \"*arbitration offers*\" of the Contracting States contained in most of the disputeresolution clauses of BITs. Similarly, the said requirement is to be applied to determine the existence and extent of the host State's consent to jurisdiction when the \"*arbitration offer*\" would allegedly be embodied in the MFN clause of a BIT in *lieu* of the dispute-resolution provision of the BIT concerned.\n\n351.\n\nGenerally, MFN clauses do not operate as a jurisdictional alternative to dispute-resolution provision of the BIT. But, it may be that the Contracting Parties to a BIT intend by \"contracting in\" that the MFN clause would apply to jurisdictional issues. In such a hypothesis, the text of the MFN clause or of the dispute-resolution provision or some other provision of the BIT concerned should provide so explicitly, and in a clear and unambiguous manner.\n\n352.\n\nIn other words, it is not admissible to invoke a MFN clause as an alternative basis of jurisdiction to the one provided for in the dispute-resolution clause of the same BIT as a sort of get-away from the requirement that State's consent to jurisdiction must be certain, unequivocal and voluntary. Thus, in line with the *Salini v. Jordan* award,289 the *Plama* Tribunal made a correct application of the requirement considered when it declared that \"an MFN provision in a basic treaty does not incorporate by reference dispute settlement provisions in whole or in part set forth in another treaty, *unless the MFN provision in the basic treaty leaves no doubt that the Contracting Parties intended to incorporate them*\"290 (*emphasis supplied*) *.*\n\nAs explained by Salini Costruttori S.p.A. and Italstrade S.p.A. v. Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan (ICSID Case No. ARB/02/13), Decision on Jurisdiction of November 29, 2004 (\"*Salini v. Jordan*\"), the question of the applicability of the MFN clause at issue in the case to \"the administration of justice in so far as concerns the protection by the Courts of the rights of persons engaged in trade and navigation\" in the decision of the International Arbitration Commission in the *Ambatielos* case, *supra* note 93, related to the application by British Courts of substantive provisions in treaties between the United Kingdom and several other countries, not to the application of a disputeresolution clause (paras. 106-12 of the decision).\n\n*Plama*, *supra* note 41, para.223.\n\n353.\n\nSeveral subsequent arbitral decisions confirm that conclusion. For example, the following passage of the *Wintershall* award :\n\n\"Ordinarily, an MFN clause would not operate so as to replace one means of dispute settlement with another. This is (presumably) why the drafters of the UK Model BIT had provided (in Article 3(1)) that 'for avoidance of doubt MFN shall apply to certain specified provisions of the BIT including the dispute settlement provision'. Because, ordinarily and without more, the prospect of an investor selecting at will from an assorted variety of options provided in other treaties negotiated with other parties under different circumstances, dislodges the dispute resolution provision in the basic treaty itself - *unless of course the MFN Clause in the basic treaty clearly and unambiguously indicates that it should be so interpreted: which is not so in the present case*\"291 (*emphasis supplied*).\n\n*Wintershall*, *supra* note 9, para. 167. In the same sense: Campbell McLachlan, Laurence Shore and Matthew Weiniger, *\"International Investment Arbitration: Substantive Principles\",* (Oxford University Press 2007), p. 256.\n\n**(iii) The distinction between substantive or material provisions, dispute-resolution provisions and final clauses in treaties**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n354.\n\nA distinction should be made between the substantive provisions of a treaty, its dispute resolution provisions (if any) and the final clauses. The substantive provisions enounce the material rights and obligations of the States parties with respect to the subject-matter of the treaty. The dispute-resolution provisions concern the means or procedures agreed upon by the States parties to settle eventual future disputes concerning those material rights and obligations. The final clauses relate to the treaty *qua* instrument (authentic texts, signature, ratification, acceptance or approval, entry into force, scope of application, amendments or modifications, denunciation, suspension or termination, registration, depositary, date and place of conclusion). The rules of these three categories of treaty provisions are of a different legal nature and it is within the second and third categories that the rule of State's consent to jurisdiction plays a paramount role in international arbitration.\n\n355.\n\nThe above distinction is enhanced by the established jurisprudence of the ICJ. For example, in its Judgment in the *East Timor* case *,* the Court declared that the *erga omnes* character of a norm and the rule of consent to jurisdiction are two different things and that the mere fact that rights and obligations *erga omnes* may be at issue in a dispute would not give the Court jurisdiction to entertain the dispute.292 The Court's Judgment on jurisdiction and admissibility concerning the case entitled *Armed Activities on the territory of the Congo (New Application: 2002)* underlines, with respect to the relationship between peremptory norms of general international law (*jus cogens*) and the establishment of the Court's jurisdiction, that: \"the fact that a dispute relates to compliance with a norm having such character (*jus cogens*), which is assuredly the case with regard to the prohibition of genocide, cannot of itself provide a basis for the jurisdiction of the Court to entertain that dispute. Under the Court's Statute that jurisdiction is always based on the consent of the parties.\"293 If this is so for *erga omnes* obligations and *jus cogens* norms, the same cannot but be likewise true with respect to dispositive rules of the kind of those contained in BITs.\n\n*Supra* note 277, p. 102, para. 29.\n\n*Supra* note 280 *,* p. 32, para. 64.\n\n356.\n\nIt follows that when a dispute-resolution provision in a treaty provides for the jurisdiction of a given international court or tribunal as a means of settlement of disputes, that jurisdiction exists only in respect of the parties to the treaty and within the limits of their consent as embodied in the dispute-resolution provision concerned. The importance or relevance of the values intended to be protected by the treaty in question and the nature, character and/or scope of the substantive rules therein are irrelevant for establishing jurisdiction. This is also confirmed by the jurisprudence of the ICJ. For example, in its Judgment in the case concerning the *Interpretation* *and Application of the Genocide Convention (Bosnia and Herzegovina v. Serbia and Montenegro) (Merits)* the Court states:\n\n\"The jurisdiction of the Court in this case is based solely on Article IX of the (Genocide) Convention [...] (the Court) *has no power to rule on alleged breaches of other obligations under international law, not amounting to genocide, particularly those protecting human rights in armed conflict. That is so even if the alleged breaches are obligations under peremptory norms, or of obligations which protect essential humanitarian values, and which may be owed* erga omnes\"294 (*emphasis supplied*).\n\nI.C.J. Reports 2007 *,* p. 104, para. 147.\n\n357.\n\nSurely, the values protected by the BITs are important, but they are certainly not higher in importance than those protected by the rules enumerated by the Court in the quotation above.\n\n358.\n\nThe first general relevant conclusion to be drawn from the referred international jurisprudence of the ICJ is the need for the arbitrators to distinguish substantive rights and obligations granted to investors of the other Contracting Party by the 1990 Argentina-Italy BIT (material provisions), on one hand, and the investment dispute-resolution provisions of the BIT concerning disputes between the host State of the investment and the private investor national of the other Contracting State, on the other hand. The importance of substantive provisions setting forth *material standards* of protection of foreign private investments and investors, or the value attached by an arbitrator to such a protection by means of international arbitration, are elements that in public international law are not called in to play any role in the legal operation of determining (through interpretation of the dispute-resolution provision) either the existence or inexistence of jurisdiction or, in the first hypothesis, the wideness of the scope of the arbitral jurisdiction accepted by Argentina and Italy in the \"*standing international arbitration offer*\" made to private investor nationals of the other Contracting Party embodied by them in the dispute-resolution provision of the BIT.\n\n359.\n\nThe necessity to underline in the present context the distinction between the *material protection* provisions and *dispute-resolution* provisions derives from the fact that confusion between these two categories of treaty provisions are at the root of the misleading jurisdictional conclusions which one may find in several ICSID and other arbitral decisions on jurisdiction and admissibility in investment dispute cases, particularly in decisions dealing with the issue of the establishment of jurisdiction and competence through the operation of the MFN clause in the BIT concerned.\n\n360.\n\nSome excesses in this respect have prompted pronouncements as the following of the 2009 *Quasar de Valors* award on preliminary objections (Arbitration Institute of the Stockholm Chamber of Commerce):\n\n\"*Article 31 (of the VCLT) must be considered with caution and discipline lest it become a palimpsest constantly altered by the projection of subjective suppositions. It does not for example compel the result that all textual doubts be resolved in favour of the investors. The long-term promotion of investments is likely to be better ensured by a well-balanced regime* *rather than by one which goes so far that it provokes a swing of the pendulum in the other* *direction*\".295 (*emphasis supplied*).\n\n*Quasar de Valors*, *supra* note 11, para.55.\n\n361.\n\nIn line with the Report of the Executive Directors,296 Aron Broches in his 1972 lecture at the Hague Academy of International Law of The Hague after recalling that a characterization of the 1965 ICSID Convention as an instrument for only the protection of private foreign investments is one-sided and too narrow continued as follows :\n\n\"Like the Statute of the International Court of Justice, the (ICSID) Convention imposes no obligation on Contracting States to submit any specific dispute to the jurisdiction of the Centre in the absence of consent, and this fact is expressly noted in the Preamble. The Preamble also makes clear that it is not the purpose of the Convention, or *the expectations of the Contracting States,* that all matters affecting foreign investments should be removed from national jurisdiction. The Preamble recognizes that such disputes would usually be subject to national legal processes but that international methods of settlement may be appropriate in certain cases. I may add in that connection that while Article 26 of the Convention provides that consent to arbitration under the Convention shall unless otherwise stated be deemed consent to such arbitration to the exclusion of any other remedy, that Article expressly recognizes *the right of a* *Contracting State to required the exhaustion of local remedies*  *as a condition of its consent**\"297 (emphasis supplied).*\n\nPara.13 of the Executive Directors' Report.\n\nAron Broches, \"The Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and nationals of other States\", *Recueil des Cours*, 1972, II, tome 136, p.349.\n\n362.\n\nThus, the lofty goal of the protection of foreign investors is not the only \"object and purpose\" of the ICSID Convention and of the BITs. These instruments are treaties, namely international instruments, governed by public international law and, as such, the intention of the contracting States Parties thereto as manifested in the text, or necessarily implied thereof, must be respected by all concerned, arbitrators included (*pacta sunt servanda*). The protection of foreign investments and investors is certainly one of the purposes of the ICSID system, but it does not authorize arbitrators to interpret the provisions of the ICSID Convention or of a given BIT in a way that would disregard the intentions of the States Parties as manifested in the text, or necessarily implied thereof, and/or interpreting the text by ignoring the outstanding interpretative elements enounced in Article 31(1) of the VCLT, namely: good faith, the ordinary meaning of the terms used in the text, the context of those terms and the object and purpose of the treaty in question.\n\n363.\n\nThe invocation of the protection of foreign private investments or investors is not a justification in law for making interpretations of the jurisdictional provisions of the ICSID Convention or of a BIT more liberal or strict than in the case of any other kind of treaty provision. All treaty provisions (the jurisdictional ones and MFN clauses included) in need of interpretation must be interpreted through the application of the interpretation rules codified in Articles 31, 32 and 33 of the VCLT which are mandatory rules of international law of general application for the interpretation of any treaty or treaty provision (not mere axioms, directives or guides) and, as such, binding for the parties to the dispute and the arbitrators alike. I fully agree therefore with the prevailing view that dispute-resolution provisions, as well as MFN clauses, in BITs must be construed and applied neither broadly nor restrictively but in conformity with those rules of the VCLT.\n\n364.\n\nFurthermore, the interpretation should also take into account the commitments that the parties may be considered as having reasonably and legitimately envisaged when concluding the treaty, like the principle of contemporaneousness and the principle of effectiveness (*effect utile*) *.* These principles are controlled within the general rule of interpreting treaties (Article 31 of the VCLT) by the principle of good faith and the object and purpose of the treaty. I share, consequently, the following observations made by the 1983 *Amco Asia v. Indonesia* arbitral tribunal in its decision on jurisdiction:\n\n\"[...] (a) convention to arbitrate is not to be construed *restrictively,* nor, as a matter of fact, *broadly* or *liberally.* It is to be construed in a way which leads to find out and to respect the common will of the parties **:** such a method of interpretation is but the application of the fundamental principle *pacta sunt servanda,* a principle common to, indeed, to all systems of internal law and to international law.\n\nMoreover, - and that is again a general principle of law -any convention, including conventions to arbitrate, should be construed in good faith, that is to say by *taking into account the consequences of the commitments of the parties may be considered as having reasonably and legitimately envisaged*\"298 (*emphasis supplied in second paragraph*).\n\n*Amco Asia Corporation and others v. Republic of Indonesia* (ICSID Case No. ARB/81/1), Decision on Jurisdiction of September 25, 1983 (\"*Amco Asia*\"), para. 14(i).\n\n365.\n\nI do not believe therefore that the basic distinction in the matter under consideration between *Mafezzini*, *Siemens* and the like; and *Plama, Wintershall* and the like case-law's lines of interpretation (concerning, for example, the interpretation of MFN clauses in BITs) turns on the existence or not of any purported rule of restrictive or liberal interpretation. For the author of the present Opinion, any *a priori* affirmation of the existence of a general rule of either restrictive or liberal interpretation of treaties would conflict with the VCLT and contemporary customary international law. As stated above, any treaty provision in need of interpretation has to be interpreted by applying duly the interpretation rules codified in Articles 31-33 of the Vienna Convention in every circumstance and, therefore, independently that the outcome of the interpretation yielded by the application of the said VCLT rules be considered *a posteriori* wide or narrow with respect to the claims, expectations or positions of any of the parties to the dispute or to the subjective values or legal schools of the arbitrators.\n\n**(iv) The scope of application of generally drafted MFN clauses and the** ***ejusdem generis*** **principle**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n366.\n\nRegarding the operation of MFN clauses in the jurisdictional field, the extension of the scope of application of \"generally drafted MFN clauses\" to dispute settlement issues on the basis of an alleged presumed consent or contracting out presupposition, or of other allegations disregarding the above distinction between substantive provisions and dispute-resolution provisions, would amount to bypassing the paramount international law rule of States' consent to jurisdiction, as defined by international jurisprudence and best doctrine. Matters being so, those promoting the extension of the scope of application of \"generally drafted MFN clauses\" in BITs to dispute-resolution should provide a reasonable legal explanation of how this phenomenon may take place in practice without disregarding the said principle. Such explanation is needed because as Professor Zachary Douglas rightly explains:\n\n\"The fundamental point is that the more favourable treatment granted in a third treaty must be claimed *through* the MFN clause in the basic treaty. That is how the MFN clause works. It does not operate to amend or supplement the text of the basic treaty\".299\n\nZachary Douglas, \"The MFN clause in Investment Arbitration: Treaty Interpretation Off the Rails\", *Journal of International Law Dispute Settlement*, Vol.2, No.1 (2011), at p. 106.\n\n367.\n\nUntil *Maffezini* (2000), it was admitted in investment arbitral decisions that rights and means of protecting rights are two different \"legal animals\" to use the image of Professor Brigitte Stern in her concurring and dissenting opinion in the *Impregilo* award.300 This continues to be the case as reflected in the jurisprudence of the ICJ and public international law doctrine, as well in a number of arbitral decisions in investment dispute, because the distinction is inherent to basic systemic principles of the international legal order in force. Subjective convictions to the contrary deserve respect, but by definition they are unable to modify that legal order and might even be an obstacle for its progressive development.\n\nBrigitte Stern concurring and dissenting opinion in *Impregilo v. Argentina*, *supra* note 40, para.31.\n\n368.\n\nIt is for that reason that I do not share, in its literalness, propositions such as **:** disputesettlement arrangements and substantive or material protection are inextricably related (*Mafezzini*), part of the treatment of foreign investments and investors (*Siemens*), integral part of the investment protection regime (*Suez*), or a significant substantive incentive and protection for foreign investors (*Gas Natural*), etc. In this way, the error of *Maffezini* in the interpretation of a well-known passage in *Ambatielos II* was extended for a while beyond *Maffezini* itself by subsequent decisions which disregarded altogether the \"public policy considerations\" and other caveats of *Maffezini*, as well as its conclusion that the requisite in the BIT concerned of the submission of the disputes to local courts within the specified period of eighteen months prior to taking it to international arbitration was indeed a jurisdictional requirement, limiting as such the scope of the consent to arbitration of the State hosting the investment. But, ICSID investment arbitration is not a system of binding precedents and, by now, quite a number of arbitral decisions and opinions have restored the scope of application of generally drafted MFN clauses in investment disputes as commanded by public international law.\n\n369.\n\nUltimately, as explained by Professor Brigitte Stern: \"[...] the core reason why an MFN clause cannot apply to dispute settlement is intimately linked with the essence of international law\"301. A conclusion at the root of the findings of other arbitral tribunal awards and decisions on investment disputes as, for example, *Salini v. Jordan* (2004), *Plama* (2005), *Telenor* (2006), *Berchader* (2006), *Wintershall* (2008), *Tza Yap Shum* (2009) and, more recently, *ICS Inspection and Control Services* (2012) and *Daimler Financial Services* (2012) *.* There is not a need however to dwell in detail on this case-law in the light of the circumstances of the present case (see below). Moreover, the issue of the extension of the application of the MFN clauses to dispute settlement provisions has been recently thoroughly and masterly examined in the decisions on jurisdiction of the *Inspection and Control Service* tribunal (paras. 274-325) and the *Daimler* tribunal (paras. 160-278) with respect to the United Kingdom-Argentine BIT and the German-Argentine BIT respectively, as well as by Brigitte Stern in her concurring and dissenting opinion in *Impregilo v. Argentina* (with reference to the Argentina-Italy BIT) and by J. Christopher Thomas in his separate and dissenting opinion in *Hochtief v. Argentina* (with reference to the German-Argentine BIT). I share generally the lofty reasoning and conclusions of those recent judicial contributions on the subject-matter of the application of MFN clauses to dispute-resolution in investment disputes.\n\n*Ibid,* para.16 of the concurring and dissenting opinion.\n\n370.\n\nBecause of the rule of State's consent to the jurisdiction of international tribunals in public international there is a dichotomy evident between substantive rights and the settlement procedural rights aiming at protecting those substantive rights, and such a dichotomy prevents, without more, an *ejusdem generis* relationship between those two sets of rights by lacking the required \"*substantial identity*\" between both. The *ejusdem generis* rule which governs the operation of MFN clauses in international relations takes duly into account that dichotomy in the definition of the scope of application of generally drafted MFN clauses, as well as with respect to the distinction between the substantive provisions of a treaty and the final clauses of the treaty. Then, concerning the latter relationship, there are not, apparently, arbitral decisions extending the application of a generally drafted MFN clause to the field of the final clauses of other BITs, although in certain situations it might be said that such an extension would improve the protection of the substantive rights of an investor.\n\n371.\n\nThe situation was similar with respect to extending the application of that type of MFN clause to dispute-resolution provisions until *Maffezini* interpreted the expression \"administration of justice\" of the *Ambatielos* International Arbitration Commission as referring to the application of an international dispute-resolution provision instead of the application to substantive protection provisions in treaties between the United Kingdom and several other countries, substantive protection which included, in the case, the right of access to national courts of the United Kingdom.302 It should be added that when, in a MFN clause context, the expression \"administration of justice\" is used without further ado, that expression is sent generally back to the administration of *national* justice. For example: access to national courts; recognition and execution of foreign judgments; security for costs; *cautio judicatum solvi* ; judicial assistance between States; etc. This appears to be the ordinary meaning of the expression when used in the indicated context.303\n\n*Salini v. Jordan* decision on jurisdiction, *supra* note 289, paras.107-112.\n\nAndre Ustor, \"Most-Favoured-Nation Clause\", in *Encyclopedia of Public International Law,* Max Planck Institute, Vol.8 (1985), at p.411.\n\n372.\n\nAs stated most effectively by the ILC in paragraphs 10 and 11 of its commentary to Articles 9 and 10 of the Draft Articles on the Most-Favoured-Nation Clause:\n\n\"(10) No writer would deny the validity of the *ejusdem generis* rule which, for the purpose of the most-favoured-nation clause, derives from its very nature. It is generally admitted that a clause conferring most-favoured-nation rights in respect of certain matter or class of matter, can attract the rights conferred by other treaties (or unilateral acts) only in regard to the same matter or class of matter.\n\n(11) The effect of the most-favoured-nation process is, by means of the provision of one treaty, to attract those of another. Unless this process is strictly confined to cases where there is a substantial identity between the subject-matter of the two sets of clauses concerned, the result in a number of cases may be to impose upon the granting State obligations it never contemplated. Thus the rule follows clearly from the general principles of treaty interpretation. States cannot be regarded as being bound beyond the obligations they have undertaken.\"304\n\n*Yearbook of the International Law Commission,* 1978, vol.II, Part Two, p.30.\n\n373.\n\nThus a \"generally drafted MFN clause\" cannot operate where there is a lack of \"*substantial identity*\" between the subject-matter of the rules at issue. One thing is to accord the investor most-favoured-nation treatment in material rights, and another thing to use the MFN clause to avoid a condition or limitation contained in the dispute-resolution provisions of the same BIT. To proceed otherwise would amount to deny not only the \"*effet utile\"* of the dispute-resolution in the interpretation, but also and most fundamental the international law rule of a State's consent to jurisdiction. The reason being that \"jurisdictional rights\" as, for example, access to international arbitration to settle a given investment dispute, require private investors' prior compliance - as commanded by the rule of State's consent to jurisdiction - with the conditions or requirements qualifying the right of access set out by the Contracting States in the dispute-resolution provision of the BIT in question. It is so because indeed, as stated in the ICJ jurisprudence, those conditions or requirements *delimit the scope of the host State's consent to international arbitration* given in advance, under the form of an \"offer\" in the dispute-resolution provision of the BIT.\n\n374.\n\nBetween \"substantive rights\" and \"substantive treatment\", on one hand, and \"jurisdictional rights\" and \"jurisdictional treatment\", on the other hand, there are legal differences not only of degree but also of nature. This difference in nature manifests itself in the fact that \"jurisdictional rights\" and \"jurisdictional treatment\" require prior compliance - by virtue of the systemic rule of State's consent of jurisdiction - with the *ratione voluntatis* conditions or requirements attached by the Contracting Parties to their *standing international arbitration offer*. The qualifying conditions of access to substantive rights of BITs and the qualifying conditions of access to international arbitration or other international means of dispute-resolution of BITs lack, therefore, between them the necessary *substantial identity* for the operation *inter se* of a generally drafted MFN clause.305\n\nBrigitte Stern's concurring and dissenting opinion in *Impregilo*, *supra* note 300, para.44 and ff.\n\n375.\n\nThe existence of an obligation of international law to comply with the jurisdictional conditions or requirements as defined by the Contracting States in BITs before the private investor having even the possibility of access to the international arbitration of the offer (consequential to the interposition in the matter of the rule of State's consent to jurisdiction), explains that it is unjustified in international law to insist on the proposition of the existence of an *ejusdem generis* relationship between \"substantive protection\" and \"the means of enforcing such protection\", as rightly underlined by J. Christopher Thomas.306 The beneficiary of a MFN clause can only claim rights falling within the scope of the clause as defined by the Contracting States in the BIT. As written by Andre Ustor, former ILC Special Rapporteur on the topic:\n\n\"The beneficiary State (the investor in the instant case) can only claim rights which belong to the subject-matter of the clause, which are within the time-limits and other conditions or restrictions set by the agreement, and which are in respect of persons or things specified in the clause or implied from its subject-matter.\"307\n\nJ. Christopher Thomas' separate and dissenting opinion in *Hochtief Aktiengesellschaft v. Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/07/31), Decision on Jurisdiction of October 24, 2011 (\"*Hochtief*\"), para. 81 and footnote 52 of the opinion.\n\nAndre Ustor, \"Most -Favoured-Nation Clause\", *supra* note 303, p. 415.\n\n376.\n\nThe above considerations apply, as indicated, to \"generally drafted MFN clauses\" whose interpretation cannot be done in isolation, namely without considering the *context* represented by the text of the dispute-resolution provision and of the BIT concerned as a whole as provided by the VCLT. The situation would of course be different if the MFN clause (or for that matter the dispute-resolution provision or some other provision of the BIT) provides expressly in a certain and unequivocal manner that the MFN treatment of the clause in the basic BIT is intended to import a more favourable arbitration dispute-resolution provision from another treaty.\n\n377.\n\nIn this latter hypothesis, the interpreter cannot but give effect to that common intention of the Contracting Parties manifested in the BIT because \"the text must be presumed to be the authentic expression of the intention of the parties\"308 and, in particular, because the requirements of the rule of State's consent to jurisdiction would have been fulfilled in such a case by the special way of incorporating expressly in the BIT the mutual consent of the Contracting States to extend the scope of operation of the MFN clause in the BIT concerned to dispute-resolution matters in their mutual relations. As stated in the *Plama* decision :\n\n\"[...] an MFN provision in a basic treaty does not incorporate by reference dispute settlement provisions in whole or in part set forth in another treaty, *unless the MFN provision in the basic treaty leaves no doubt that the Contracting Parties intended to incorporate them*\"309 (e *mphasis supplied*).\n\nUN Publication on the Law of Treaties, *supra* note 175, p.40, para. 11.\n\n*Plama*, *supra* note 41, para.223.\n\n**(v) As secondary right holders, foreign private investors have access to international arbitration only by accepting the \"standing arbitration offer\" in the terms and with the general preconditions and prior requirements formulated by the Contracting States in the BIT**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n378.\n\nAs explained above, each Contracting State gives *in advance* in the BIT its consent to the effect that investment disputes with a protected private investor national of the other Contracting State be submitted to international arbitration under the form of a standing offer expressed in *written* form, as required by Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention. Thus, the terms, conditions and wideness of the consent of the host State party to the investment dispute are to be found in the dispute-resolution provision of the BIT concerned. The protected private foreign investors are entitled therefore to invoke that consent to international arbitration of the host State as defined and confined by the said dispute-resolution provision, but not to allege a different host State's consent or a wider one.\n\n379.\n\nThe private investor cannot modify by his/its act of acceptance of the standing offer, or otherwise, the terms or scope of the \"international arbitration\" consented by the Contracting States in the offer contained in the dispute-resolution provision of the BIT. The written acceptance of the foreign private investor cannot therefore be accompanied by reservations or caveats of any kind with respect to the existence of the consent to arbitration embodied in the \"standing offer\" of the host State or to its extent. On the contrary, to be legally effective the investor's acceptance shall be deemed to correspond to the terms and scope of the international arbitration standing offer as defined by the Contracting States in the BIT. To do otherwise would be self-defeating for the investor because it would prevent that *the respective consents of the parties to the dispute match each other so that the undertaking to arbitrate (convenci\u00f3n de arbitraje) between them be formed and the undertaking duly executed*. As has already been mentioned in Chapter II (2) of this Opinion, the jurisdiction of an arbitral tribunal depends upon the existence of an agreement to arbitrate between the parties to the dispute. This need is a *sine qua non* prior condition for any international arbitration, as explained by J. Christopher Thomas in his separate and dissenting opinion in *Hochtief v. Argentina**.*310 He pointed out *inter alia* that: \"In the pre- *Maffezini* days, it was clear that the offer and the acceptance must match\"311.\n\n*Supra* note 306, paras. 14-27 of the dissenting opinion.\n\n*Ibid*, para. 20 of the dissenting opinion.\n\n380.\n\nWithout a mutually-consented-binding-arbitral-undertaking duly executed, the investor as a secondary holder of rights under the BIT in question would have deprived him/it by its own conduct of the right of access to the ICSID Centre and, consequently, of the possibility that the investment dispute be adjudicated by an ICSID arbitral tribunal. It is, therefore, in the investor's interest to meet the terms and scope of the \"standing offer\" for international arbitration made by the host State in the BIT concerned by complying with the preconditions or prior requirements attached thereto by the Contracting States. Unilateral attempts to circumvent, to modify or to alter in any respect the terms and scope of the host State's consent to international arbitration, as defined and delimited in the said offer, are in public international law beyond the reach of *third parties* who, like the investors, are holding under the BIT secondary-treaty rights only.\n\n381.\n\nThese general conclusions are based not only upon the paramount international law principle of the consensual jurisdiction of international courts and tribunals, but also in the law of treaties. As recalled by the *Wintershall* tribunal, according to the law of treaties, when exercising a right provided for in a given treaty, a \"third beneficiary of a right\" under the treaty, like the investors, \"must comply with the conditions for the exercise of the right provided for in the treaty concerned or established in conformity with the treaty\"312, namely in the instant case with the conditions and requirements set forth in Article 8 of the 1990 Argentina-Italy BIT.\n\n*Wintershall*, *supra* note 9, para. 114. See, in the analogous context of treaties providing for rights for third States, Article 36(2) of the VCLT: \"A State exercising a right in accordance with paragraph 1 shall comply with the conditions for its exercise provided for in the treaty or established in conformity with a treaty\".\n\n382.\n\nAs has been underlined by case-law and doctrine the \"standing arbitration offers\" of the Contracting States of BITs are in the nature of \"take it or leave it offers\" vis-\u00e0-vis foreign private investors. For example, the award on jurisdiction in the *ICS Inspection and Control Services* case states that:\n\n\"At the time of commencing dispute resolution under the treaty, the investor can only accept or decline the offer to arbitrate, but cannot vary its terms. The investor, regardless of the particular circumstances affecting the investor or its belief in the utility or fairness of the conditions attached to the offer of the host State, must nonetheless contemporaneously consent to the application of the terms and conditions of the offer made by the host State, *or else no agreement to arbitrate may be formed.* As opposed to a dispute resolution provision in a concession contract between an investor and a host State where subsequent events or circumstances arising may be taken into account to determine the effect to be given to earlier negotiated terms, the investment treaty presents a 'take it or leave it' situation at the time the dispute and the investor's circumstances are already known. This point is equally poignant in the context of jurisdiction grounded on an MFN clause [...]\"313 (*emphasis supplied*).\n\n*ICS Inspection and Control Services*, *supra* note 12, para. 272.\n\n383.\n\nThus, to enjoy the right of access to international arbitration, provided for in a given BIT, a foreign private investor as a *third party* shall comply *with the conditions for the exercise* of that right set forth in the dispute-resolution provision of the BIT as commanded by the law of treaties, as well as by the rule of State's consent to jurisdiction of general international law for which rule those conditions *limit further the scope of the consent itself.* This is established jurisdiction at the ICJ. For example, in its Judgment in the *Armed Activities on the Territory of the Congo (New Application: 2002) (Democratic Republic of Congo v. Rwanda)* case, the Court declared that:\n\n\"(The Court's) jurisdiction is based on the consent of the parties and is confined to the extent accepted by them...When that consent is expressed in a compromissory clause in an international agreement, *any conditions to which such consent is subject must be regarded as constituting limits thereon*\"314 (*emphasis supplied*).\n\n*Supra* note 280, p. 39, para. 88.\n\n**(vi) Non-applicability of the customary international law rules on prior exhaustion of local remedies and diplomatic protection to the present case**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n384.\n\nArgentina and Italy did not require when joining the ICSID Convention or thereafter the exhaustion of local administrative or judicial remedies as a condition of their respective consents to arbitration under that Convention, as allowed by its Article 26.315 In 1990, they did not incorporate either in their BIT a conventional *inter se* version of that rule of customary international law. But, Argentina and Italy did not *contract into* the \"standing offer\" in the BIT for international arbitration with investors unreservedly.\n\nNo information to the contrary was called to the attention of the ICSID Secretariat or the Tribunal by the Parties.\n\n385.\n\nBoth countries do confine their respective consents to international arbitration within some jurisdictional preconditions that protected investors shall comply with before having access to international arbitration. However, none of them (prior consultation as far as possible, followed by 18 months litigation in local courts) amount to an exhaustion of administrative or judicial local remedies precondition. They are *conventional preconditions* agreed upon willingly and freely by Argentina and Italy which delimit the maximum extent of the consent to international arbitration accepted by these countries in the \"offer\" of their BIT. Diplomatic protection customary rules of international law are also alien to the present phase devoted to the preliminary objections submitted by the Respondent and exclude at present, expressly, by Article 27(1) of the ICSID Convention because no award has yet been rendered by the Tribunal in the case.\n\n386.\n\nThe above reminder is, however, necessary because the Majority Decision based its conclusion upon the prerequisite of the 18 months litigation in local courts in a *de lege ferenda* threshold for the futility exception contained in Article 15(a) of the 2006 draft articles of the ILC on diplomatic protection,316 draft articles which remain since then within the UN General Assembly waiting for a decision in the light of comments and observations from Governments **.** In such circumstances, I am of the opinion that the recourse by the Majority Decision to the said threshold as it would be positive international law applicable in the relations between Argentina and Italy is not only misplaced, but an unwarranted *ultra vires* exercise by the Majority of the *Kompetenz-Kompetenz* of the Tribunal vested upon it by Article 41 of the ICSID Convention. An opinion of mine which is, furthermore, confirmed by the very fact that Article 17 of the said 2006 draft articles reads as follows:\n\n\"The present draft articles do not apply to the extent that they are inconsistent with special rules of international law, such as treaty provisions for the protection of investments\".317\n\nMajority Decision, paras. 608-11.\n\nThe 2006 ILC draft articles on diplomatic protection, with commentaries, appears in *Official Records of the General Assembly, Sixty-first Session, Supplement No.10 (A/61/10).* In 2010, the General Assembly decided to include in the provisional agenda of its sixty-eight session (2013) an item entitled \"Diplomatic Protection\" and, within the framework of a working group of the Sixth Committee, in the light of the written comments of Governments, as well as views expressed in the debates held at the 62nd and 65th sessions of the General Assembly, to further examine the question of a convention on diplomatic protection, or any other appropriate action, on the basis of the articles and also identify any difference of opinion on the articles (see: International Law Commission, Analytical Guide: Diplomatic Protection, J. Final Outcome, available at: http://untreaty.un.org/ilc/guide/9 8.htm, last update:19 January 2012).\n\n**(b) The extent of the Respondent's consent to international arbitration manifested in the \"standing arbitration offer\" of Article 8 of the 1990 Argentina-Italy BIT**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**(i) The Respondent's consent to international arbitration as confined within the dispute-resolution system of the BIT**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n387.\n\nArgentina's international arbitration \"offer\" to Italian private investors in its territory is contained in Article 8(3) of the 1990 Argentina-Italy BIT. In this \"offer\" Argentina gives its advance and irrevocable consent that the investment disputes with the protected Italian private investors may be submitted to international arbitration. But, the \"offer\" is far from being an unrestricted international arbitration offer. It is subject to some prior conditions and requirements. The Italian private investors have to comply with those conditions and requirements in order to have access to international arbitration. They do not have an unrestricted unilateral right of access to international arbitration vis-\u00e0-vis the Respondent.\n\n388.\n\nAs to the prior general conditions two appear as outstanding, namely: (i) that the consent to international arbitration is given by Argentina \"for the purpose, and in conformity with the terms\" of the BIT (Article 8(3), second paragraph); and (ii) that the said consent is given by Argentina for \"any dispute relating to investments that arises\" between it and protected Italian private investors \"with respect to matters regulated\" by the BIT (Article 8(1), but not further or otherwise.\n\n389.\n\nConcerning the requirements circumscribing the extent of Respondent's given consent, Article 8 of the BIT provides for a multi-layered, sequential dispute-resolution system leading, eventually, as a last step, to international arbitration. The prior settlement means provided for by the system are \"amicable consultations\" (Article 8(1)) and \"18-month litigation in local courts\" (Article 8(2)(3)). In the first place, the dispute \"shall be, in so far as possible, resolved through amicable consultations between the parties to the dispute\". If the initial \"amicable consultations\" attempt does not provide a solution, the dispute \"may be submitted to a competent administrative or judicial jurisdiction of the Contracting Party in whose territory the investment is located\". It is only if the dispute still exists \"after a period of 18 months has elapsed since the commencement of the proceeding before the national jurisdictions\" that the dispute may be submitted to international arbitration.\n\n390.\n\nThe above preconditions and prerequisites are part and parcel of the \"offer\" that Argentina and Italy agreed upon in the BIT delimiting as much the extent of the international arbitration consented by Argentina and Italy in the BIT. These *ratione voluntatis* limitations (agreed upon by the Contracting States) of the extent of the consent to international arbitration given by them in advance and in an irrevocable manner, adopts in Article 8(3) of the BIT the form of an \"offer\" to the private investors nationals of the other Contracting State. Thus, the Italian private investors in Argentina protected by the BIT have no option but to comply with the closely interlinked conditions and prerequisites mentioned in Article 8 of the BIT which define the extent of the host State's consent to international arbitration. It follows that they do not have the right to sue directly the host State by filing a request for arbitration in the Centre without previous compliance with the said preconditions and prerequisites, simply because that is the express will of the States Parties to the BIT.318 It is, therefore, in the interest of the protected investors to comply with those conditions and prerequisites.\n\n*Wintershall*, *supra* note 9, para. 117.\n\n391.\n\nThe text of Article 8 of the Argentina-Italy BIT is crystal clear. In the face of that clearness eventual allegations of different expectations by investors are not, in my opinion, a proposition susceptible of being sustained in public international law. Arbitrators cannot but duly take into account those preconditions and prerequisites when assessing, pursuant to the Argentina-Italy BIT, the jurisdiction of the ICSID and the competence of the present Tribunal. No doubts seem possible about the intentions of Argentina and Italy manifested in Article 8 of their BIT concerning the extent of their respective consents to international arbitration embodied in the \"offer\". The Claimants themselves admitted in their Request for Arbitration of 23 June 2008 that: \"In the present case, Argentina's offer to Italian investors to refer disputes to ICSID is expressed in Article 8 of the BIT, which provides the following: (quotation of the text of paragraphs 1 to 5(a) of Article 8 of the Argentina-Italy BIT).319\n\nPara. 83 of the Request for Arbitration.\n\n**(ii) General preconditions**\n------------------------------\n\n392.\n\nAs indicated in paragraph 388 above, the Respondent's consent to international arbitration in Article 8 (3) is given for investment disputes between the investor and the host State *with respect to matters regulated by the BIT* (Article 8(1)), not further or otherwise. Such consent does not extend therefore to matters falling outside the BIT as, for example, matters not covered by the definition of the terms \"investment\", \"investor\", \"income\" and \"territory\" in Article 1 of the BIT. In other words, the extent of the Respondent's consent to international arbitration is circumscribed to investment disputes whose subject-matter falls under the *ratione materiae* and the *ratione personae* jurisdictions as defined by the Argentina-Italy BIT and the ICSID Conventi on.320\n\nSo far as to the scope of *ratione materiae* jurisdiction in the instant case, see Chapters II (1) and III of the present Opinion.\n\n393.\n\nFurthermore, the Respondent's consent is given \"in conformity with the terms of the Agreement\" (namely the BIT) and, consequently, for *the period of time following compliance* with the dispute-resolution prerequisites of \"amicable consultations\" and the \"18 months litigation in Argentine courts\". This *ratione temporis* limitation of the extent of the Respondent's consent to international arbitration is likewise ignored by the Majority Decision. Further, additional limitations *ratione temporis* are set forth in the final clauses of the BIT with respect to investments made prior to the entry into force of the BIT, as well as to its entry into force and terms and expiration of the BIT.\n\n394.\n\nRegarding the second general precondition, namely the existence of an investment dispute, at the date of the institution of the present arbitration proceeding (23 June 2008), between the Parties with respect to matters regulated by the BIT, namely a legal investment dispute between the Claimants and the Respondent,321 no specific preliminary objection was submitted. But, Respondent moved the preliminary admissibility objection that the \"Claimants lack legal standing to institute these proceedings\".322 This matter will be considered bellow in Section 2 of this Opinion devoted to the extent of Claimants' consent and the admissibility of their Request for Arbitration.\n\nClaimants instituted the present arbitration proceeding pursuant to Rule 1 of the Institution Rules, Article 25 of the ICSID Convention limiting the jurisdiction of the Centre to \"any legal dispute arising directly out of an investment\".\n\nPoint (e) of Respondent's Request for Relief in para. 185 of the Argentine Republic's Post-Hearing-Brief.\n\n**(iii) The prior requirement of \"amicable consultations\"**\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n395.\n\nThe dispute-resolution system the Argentina-Italy BIT provides for, in the first place, that the investment dispute \"shall be, insofar as possible, resolved through amicable consultations between the parties to the dispute\" (Article 8(1)). Only in the case the \"amicable consultations\" do not provide a solution, the dispute may be submitted to the local courts of the host State of the investment (second step of the system). The use of the world \"shall\" is in itself indicative of an *obligation* to try to resolve the dispute through amicable consultations, not simple a choice or option. The word \"shall\" in treaty terminology means that what is provided for is *legally binding*.\n\n396.\n\nThe Respondent accepts that the obligation for the Parties to the dispute to enter into \"amicable consultations\" is a mandatory requirement which it characterize as jurisdictional in nature.323 The Claimants consider that there exits an obligation for the Parties to resort to \"amicable consultations\" prior to taking a dispute to international arbitration, but in their opinion the provision does not lay down a mandatory jurisdictional requirement but merely provides for a procedural prerequisite which does not need to be strictly followed. Thus, for the Claimants non-compliance with the \"amicable consultations\" requirement of Article 8(1) of the BIT would not be a bar to ICSID jurisdiction.324\n\nMajority Decision, para. 552.\n\n*Ibid.,* para.560.\n\n397.\n\nFurthermore, Claimants argued that the requirement of \"amicable consultations\" was clearly inapplicable in the present case. They alleged that it was apparent from the facts because Argentina would have always displayed a hostile and uncooperative attitude towards the Claimants and, in any case, the possibility of reaching an amicable settlement was precluded by Law No. 26,017 which prohibited governmental bodies from taking any kind of action (judicial, extrajudicial or private) with the Claimants.325 However, for the Respondent the prior requirement of \"amicable consultations\" operates as a limitation of its consent to international arbitration and, being mandatory and jurisdictional in nature, the requirement must be strictly complied with before an investor's right to international arbitration arises, and be exercised by the investors through the institution of international arbitral proceedings on the investment dispute. Failure to comply with the requirement will entail a bar to the jurisdiction of the Centre and to the competence of the Tribunal. Furthermore, the Respondent points out that the Law No. 26,017 did not make settlement of the investment dispute with Argentina impossible or futile. It only required legislative consent to any settlement as corroborated by the reopening of the Exchange Offer in 2010.326\n\nRequest for Arbitration, para. 87\n\nMajority decision, paras.552-553.\n\n398.\n\nI find myself in agreement with the essence of the Respondent's view. As admitted by the Majority Decision itself,327 there is no ambiguity as to the mandatory character of the prior \"amicable consultations\" requirement of Article 8(1) of the Argentina-Italy BIT. The addition of the words \"in so far as possible\" does not eliminate the binding character of the provision,328 the mandatory language of which reveals, obviously, a State Parties' intention to the effect that the dispute *\"shall be, in so far as possible,*  *resolved* *through amicable consultations\u2019\" (emphasis supplied*).\n\n*Ibid*, paras. 579-80.\n\nFor the Majority Decision the addition of the words \"so far as possible\" characterized that the type of binding provision as an \"obligation of means\" or of \"best efforts\" (para. 579 of the Decision).\n\n399.\n\nFurthermore, to the extent that a prerequisite in a treaty or in a given compromissory clause thereof qualified as a *legally binding condition*, it must be comply with before the seisin of the international court or tribunal concerned, even when the prerequisite is not subject by the treaty instrument or clause to a given *temporal timeframe*, as it is the case of the rule on \"amicable consultations\" of Article 8(1) of the Argentina-Italy BIT. This provision does not set out in effect any given period of time or time-limits for the holding of the \"amicable consultations\" between the parties to the dispute.\n\n400.\n\n\"Amicable consultations\" or \"negotiations\" as preconditions to international arbitration or judicial settlement are very usual in conventional law. For example, Article 9 of the Argentina-Italy BIT concerning the \"Resolution of Disputes between the Contracting Parties\" over the interpretation and application of the BIT itself provides also for \"amicable consultations\" during six months before going to an *ad hoc* Arbitral Tribunal to be established in accordance with the provisions of the said Article of the BIT.\n\n401.\n\nResort to \"amicable consultations\" or \"negotiations\" prior to the recourse to international arbitration or judicial settlement is indeed a generalized practice which in the field of investment disputes is very common in most if not all of the BITs.329 We are not dealing here, therefore, with one of those conditions or requirements that sometimes investors' counsels characterize *ex* *facie* as \"unreasonable\", \"meaningless\", \"nonsensical\", \"oppressive\" or \"impossible of compliance\" and that, for those reasons, they ask that their clients be dispensed with or the tribunal disregard it altogether in the instituted arbitral proceeding.330 In the instant case, as matter of principle, there is no reason why the Tribunal should not enforce the \"amicable consultations\" obligation of Article 8(1) of the BIT, when it is clearly and undisputedly so stipulated in a conventional rule of the applicable BIT.\n\nFor example, the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, Article 22.\n\nSee, for example, *Wintershall*, *supra* note 9, para 125.\n\n402.\n\nAs the ICJ has explained, resort to \"amicable consultations\" and \"negotiations\" fulfils three main useful distinct functions, namely: (i) it gives notice to the respondent that a dispute exists and delimits the scope of the dispute and its subject-matter; (ii) it encourages the parties to attempt to settle their dispute by mutual agreement, so avoiding recourse to binding third-party adjudication or arbitration; and (iii) it performs an important function, together with other methods of peaceful settlement, in indicating *the limit of consent given by States to the jurisdiction* of a given international court or tribunal.331\n\nIn the *ICJ Judgment* in the *Application of the CERD (Georgia v. Russian Federation)* case, *supra* note 283, para. 135. The fact that Article 22 of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (CERD) is not drafted in mandatory terms did not prevent the Court to dismiss the case for non-compliance by claimant of the two alternative preconditions to judicial settlement set out in the said Article 22, namely negotiations or referral to procedures expressly provided for in CERD.\n\n403.\n\nIn the light of the conduct adopted by Claimants, the \"amicable consultations\" method of Article 8(1) of the Argentina-Italy BIT is clearly unable in the present case to perform the first two functions listed above But the third function, namely *the important function of indicating the limit of the consent given by Argentina to international arbitration in Article 8 of the BIT, as Respondent in the instant case, remains entirely, because beyond the reach of being affected by any Claimants' adopted conduct*.\n\n404.\n\nIn effect, it is unquestionable that it belongs exclusively to the Argentine Republic to define the extent of its own consent to international arbitration in investment disputes with alleged Italian investors. And the Argentine Republic did so, in agreement with Italy, in Article 8 of the 1990 Argentina-Italy BIT. The consent therein manifested being limited by an \"amicable consultations\" prerequisite with the Italian disputing investor(s), the concluding finding cannot be other than the submission to international arbitration of an alleged investment dispute with an Italian investor *without* the prior holding of the mandatory \"amicable consultations\" between the Parties to the dispute falls outside the extent of the consent to international arbitration given by the Argentine Republic in the BIT concluded with Italy. In any case, Argentina's consent to international arbitration in the absence of compliance with \"amicable consultations\" of Article 8 of the BIT has not been proven by Claimants who all the way argued that the requirement did not apply to them in the circumstances of the case.\n\n405.\n\nThe Majority Decision admits that \"no consultations between the Parties have taken place\" and that \"Claimants could not establish that a minimum amount of consultations between them and the Respondent were conducted\".332 However, the Majority concludes that \"Claimants did not violate the requirement to engage in amicable consultations incumbent upon them by virtue of Art. 8(1) of the Argentina-Italy BIT \".333 How is this *ex facie* contradiction explained in the Majority Decision? By an erroneous interpretation of the role attributed to the words *\"in so far as possible\"* within the rule set forth in Article 8(1). To the point that it infringes upon the issue of the extent of the Respondent's consent to international arbitration, this erroneous interpretation has to be dealt here, without prejudice to come back to the matter in Section 2 of the present Chapter from the standpoint of the definition of the extent of the manifested Claimants' consent.\n\nMajority Decision, para. 584.\n\n*Ibid,* para. 588.\n\n406.\n\nThe Majority Decision begins by making the disclaimer that it is not reading a \"futility exception\" into Article 8(1), but that its conclusions are \"a direct and independent consequence of the very wording of the provision in question \".334 But right after, the Majority abandons the text of the provision all together *endorsing* instead, within the interpretative process, some subjective *Abaclat* tribunal's pronouncements to the effect that consultation \"is to be reasonably understood as referring not only to the technical possibility of settlement talks, but also to the possibility, i.e. the likelihood, of a positive result\" and that \"it would be futile to force the Parties to enter into a consultation exercise which is deemed to fail from the outset. The willingness to settle is the *sine qua non* condition for the success of any amicable settlement talk\".335 Peculiar pronouncements in the light *inter alia* that in public international law, as a general rule, an obligation of \"consultation\" or \"negotiation\" does not entail reaching agreement but of trying to agree.\n\n*Ibid,* para. 582.\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n407.\n\nIn that way, namely through an alleged interpretation of the text (supposed to be conducted in accordance with the interpretation rules of the VCLT), the \"amicable consultations\" conventional obligation set forth in Article 8(1) of the BIT is transformed in something else, i.e. in an obligation with a different content and purpose.336 This method of interpretation of treaty law cannot be considered reasonable at all in public international law. Once more, the Majority Decision is modifying the text of the BIT under the pretext of making an interpretation of one of its provisions. The \"amicable consultations\" obligation of Article 8(1) is not setting forth the precondition that a \"possibility of meaningful consultations to settle the dispute\" with the host State existed, as argued the Majority Decision. This is *Abalat's dixit,* not BIT's *dixit.*\n\nIn other contexts as well.\n\n408.\n\nWithin the text of Article 8(1) the words *\"in so far as possible\"* do not refer to the entering or engaging into the \"amicable consultations\" but to the duration of the obligation. The obligation *to resolve* the dispute through that process ends or terminates in law at the moment when that possibility is over, but it exists and is operative until that moment. The words *\"in so far as possible\"* do not qualify the entering or engaging of the \"amicable consultations\" process. Claimants are not obliged to enter or engage in \"amicable consultations\" at any specified moment of time, but if they do not try even (as in the present case) to initiate the process, they cannot claim the right of submitting the investment dispute to international arbitration pursuant to Article 8 of the Argentina -Italy BIT. The Argentine Republic's consent to international arbitration in the \"offer\" to Italian protected private investors in its territory does not extend so far as to cover unilateral direct access to international arbitration\n\n409.\n\nI conclude, therefore, that the extent of consent to international arbitration contained in the Argentine Republic's offer of the BIT does not cover the international arbitration proceeding instituted by Claimants in the instant case. This conclusion of mine is based upon the text of Article 8(1) of the BIT in the context of paragraphs (1)-(3) of the Article as a whole. It is furthermore conformed to the established jurisprudence of the ICJ on the matter, as well as to a number of arbitral decisions in ICSID case-law. As declared by the ICJ in its Judgment in the *Case concerning Application of the CERD (Georgia v. Russian Federation):*\n\n\"Manifestly, in the absence of evidence of a genuine attempt to negotiate, the precondition of negotiation is not met. However, where negotiations are attempted or have commenced the jurisprudence of this Court and of the Permanent Court of International Justice clearly reveals that the precondition of negotiation is met only when there has been a failure of negotiations, or when negotiations have become futile or deadlocked\".337\n\n*Supra* note 283, para. 159. The paragraph mentioned in support of the declared jurisprudence the following cases: *Mavrommatis Palestine Concessions*, *supra* note 271; *South West Africa (Ethiopia v. South Africa; Liberia v. South* *Africa) (1960-1966); United States Diplomatic and Consular Staff in Tehran (United States of America v. Iran); Applicability of the Obligations to Arbitrate under Section 21 of the United Nations Headquarters Agreement of 26* *June 1947 Advisory Opinion of 26 April 1988 - General List No. 77 (1988-1988)* ; and *Questions of Interpretation and Application of the 1971 Montreal Convention arising from the Aerial Incident at Lockerbie (Libyan Arab Jamahiriya v. United States of America)*. In the same sense, the Judgment in the case of *Armed Activities in the Territory of the Congo*, *supra* note 280, p. 40-41, para. 91).\n\n410.\n\nThe ICJ dismissed the above case by lack of jurisdiction because Georgia was unable to prove that in fact it sought *to commence* good faith negotiation or the other settlement method provided for in Article 22 of CERD as preconditions for the seisin of the Court. The same may occur of course in investment arbitrations proceedings. Then, as did for example the *Murphy International v. Ecuador* tribunal, the lack of jurisdiction of ICSID and of competence of the tribunal has to be declared by sustaining a preliminary objection of non-compliance with the amicable consultations or negotiation precondition prescribed by the applicable BIT.338\n\nWith respect to a \"six months consultation and negotiation period\" precondition in the applicable BIT (*Murphy Exploration & Production Company - International v. Republic of Ecuador* (PCA- UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules) Award on Jurisdiction of December 15, 2010 (\"*Murphy v. Ecuador*\"), para. 161).\n\n411.\n\nLastly, it should be recalled that the position of the Claimants concerning compliance with the \"amicable consultations obligation\" of Article 8(1) of the Argentina-Italy BIT is different from the position of the claimants in the *Abaclat* case, as proved by the evidence provided for by their letter of 28 February 2006 to the Argentine Minister of Economy referred to in paragraph 66 of the present Opinion. There is not such kind of letter in the present case. I see in this absence an additional reason to avoid references to the pronouncements of the *Abaclat* tribunal on the subject-matter of the \"amicable consultations\" of Article 8(1) of the BIT.\n\n**(iv) The prior requirement of \"18 month litigation in local courts\"**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n412.\n\nThe considerations and conclusions above are likewise applicable *mutatis mutandis* to the second prerequisite to international arbitration of the system set forth in Article 8(2) and (3) of the Argentina-Italy BIT namely that, if the \"amicable consultations\" failed, \"the dispute may be submitted to the competent administrative or judicial jurisdiction of the Contracting Party in whose territory the investment is located\" during \"a period of 18 months\". The language of Article 8(2) uses a permissive \"may\", but read together with the immediate context provided for by Article 8(3) cannot be reasonably understood but as meaning that the dispute, if it still exists, may be submitted to international arbitration only \"after a period of 18 months has elapsed since notification of the commencement of the proceeding before the national jurisdictions indicated in paragraph 2\". As stated by the *Impregilo* award with reference to the same provision of the Argentina-Italy BIT applicable to the present case:\n\n\"[...] the wording of Article 8(3) indicates that it contains a general condition for international arbitration, and there is no exception for the situation where there had been no domestic proceedings. If the intention had been to provide for such an exception, the wording would most probably be different. An appropriate wording would then have been, for instance: 'If the dispute has not been submitted to the competent judicial or administrative courts in accordance with paragraph 2 above, or if the dispute, after having been submitted to these courts, has remained unresolved eighteen months after the commencement of the proceedings before them, it may be submitted to international arbitration...'\".339\n\n*Impregilo*, *supra* note 40, para. 89.\n\n413.\n\nThus, Article 8(2) of the BIT provides a mandatory time-limited \"18 months litigations in local courts obligation\" (Argentine courts in the instant case) before, if the investment dispute still exists, bringing it to international arbitration. So much so, that Article 8(4) of the BIT provides that \"from the moment an (international) arbitral proceeding is commenced, each of the parties to the dispute will adopt all necessary measures in order to desist from the on-going judicial proceeding\" in local courts. This proviso answers eventual situations in which the withdrawal of the case from local courts would be or appear impermissible under domestic laws.340\n\nThe point was, for example, raised in the *Wintershall* case, *supra* note 9 (*see* paras. 130-32 of the award).\n\n414.\n\nThe Claimants denied the above. For the Claimants the prerequisite to have recourse to the domestic courts of the host State for a period of 18 months prior to resorting to international arbitration was merely an option for the investor. To this effect they rely on: the language of Article 8(2); the \"entirely futility\" of a legal action before Argentine courts because the impossibility to decide the case in only 18 months; the Law No. 26,017 (notably its Articles 3 and 6); the judgment of the Supreme Court of Argentina in the *Galli, Hugo Gabriel y otro c/ Poder Ejecutivo Nacional* (\"*Galli*\") case; and the costs of the proceedings before the Argentine courts. Furthermore, Claimants contend that they are not required to have recourse to domestic courts on the account of an alleged alternative base of jurisdiction which would be provided for by the MFN clause contained in Article 3 of the Argentina-Italy BIT.341\n\nMajority Decision, paras. 563-67.\n\n415.\n\nThe Respondent considers that the recourse to domestic courts was mandatory and a precondition to avail oneself of international arbitration. It points out further that the Claimants do not dispute their failure to submit their claims to the Argentine courts, and contests that the Claimants can rely on the so-called \"futility exception\" on any of the alleged accounts, recalling in that respect that Article 8(3) of the BIT does not require the dispute to be *resolved* within the 18 months stipulated timeframe, but only that the dispute be *submitted* to domestic courts during 18 months. The Respondent contends also that Law No. 26,017 and the 2005 *Galli* judgment (a purely domestic case) in no way inhibits Claimants from *submitting* the dispute to local courts, that remedies before Argentine courts are inexpensive and, furthermore, that the MFN clause of the Argentina-Italy BIT does not apply to dispute-resolution mechanisms.342\n\n*Ibid,* paras. 554-59.\n\n416.\n\nAs in the case of the \"amicable consultation\", I find myself in agreement with the essence of the Respondent's arguments on the time-bound-prior-recourse-to-local-courts requirement of the Argentina-Italy BIT. The requirement is mandatory and sequential in nature for any Italian claimant investor in the territory of Argentina. It limits, therefore, the scope of the Respondent's consent to international arbitration as manifested in the \"offer\" contained in Article 8(3) of the Argentina-Italy BIT and, consequently, is also jurisdictional in nature. The Majority Decision begins by accepting the proposition that \"the *possibility* to proceed to international arbitration is at the disposal of the investor only when not having failed to satisfy the *obligation* of having recourse to domestic courts\",343 but it voids that initial admission of any practical meaning when coming down to consider the legal consequences of Claimants' non-compliance with the prerequisite.\n\n*Ibid,* para. 591.\n\n417.\n\nAs to the question of the limiting effect of this prerequisite on the extent of the Argentine Republic's consent to international arbitration, I do not find any answer in the Majority Decision. However, there is no reason why the Tribunal should not consider and respect the extent of the Respondent' consent to jurisdiction resulting from the \"18 months litigation in Argentine courts\" precondition, as formulated together by Argentina and Italy as Contracting States of Article 8(2) and (3) of the BIT. Further, the precondition considered is not an extemporaneous prerequisite at all. About 10 of the BITs concluded by the Argentine Republic with other States contain, with some difference in language, a time-bound recourse to domestic courts obligation before going to international arbitration.344\n\nThe 10 State Parties to those 10 BITs are: Italy, Belgium-Luxembourg, United Kingdom, Germany, Switzerland, Spain, Canada, Austria, Netherlands, and Republic of Korea (See *ICS Inspection and Control Services*, *supra* note 12, Annex 1).\n\n418.\n\nThe requirement is neither a mere \"waiting period\" nor an \"exhaustion of local remedies\" requirement. It falls rather between both in respect to contents as well as object and purpose.345 It is further a requirement mixed in character composite by a *ratione fori* element and a *ratione* *temporis* element.346 Beyond resolving the dispute, there are various other purposes and sensible reasons for including the \"18 months litigation in local courts\" precondition requirement. As has been observed by some arbitral tribunals in investment disputes:\n\n\"(1) the submission to domestic courts might serve to familiarize them with the State's international obligations towards foreign investors and promote their capacity to handle and resolve international investment disputes; (2) the submission to domestic courts may help to highlight areas of inconsistence between local law and State' international obligations for potential reform, (3) the State may prefer to avoid the publicity of an international claim if the dispute is able to be resolved locally; and (4) the delay and process involved may better allow the State to assess the claim, gather evidence, and prepare a defence to a possible international arbitration claim\".347\n\n*Ibid,* para. 248.\n\n*Wintershall*, *supra* note 9, para. 145\n\n*ICS Inspection and Control Services*, *supra* note 12, p.89, footnote 98, and *Daimler v. Argentina*, *supra* note 1, paras. 197-98.\n\n419.\n\nIn any case, being in Article 8 of the BIT, this treaty-based-pre-condition is also, like the previous amicable consultations one, a *ratione voluntatis* requirement that Italian private investors have no choice but to comply with in order to be entitled to institute an international arbitration proceeding at ICSID against the Argentine Republic. In the absence of even a *cursory* attempt to comply with the \"18 months litigation in Argentine courts\" it's obvious, without the need of further evidence that Claimants failed to abide by that precondition to international arbitration.\n\n420.\n\nThis conduct of the Claimants is, however, powerless *per se,* as stated above, to alter, in any respect, the extent of the Respondent's consent to international arbitration *as manifested in the offer of Article 8 of the BIT.* Therefore, the conventional obligation of \"18 months litigation in Argentine courts\" cannot be considered fulfilled (like in the case of the \"amicable consultations\" precondition) by anything less than by what is explicitly prescribed in Article 8 of the BIT. The consent to international arbitration given by the Respondent in the said offer does not extend to investment disputes instituted by Italian private investors prior to their compliance with the 18 months of litigation in Argentine courts.\n\n421.\n\nAs we are going to see next, the 18 months litigation in local courts is a requirement that must be respected because it is jurisdictional in nature, the reason being as declared unanimously by the *Impregilo v. Argentina* tribunal:\n\n\"In sum, Article 8(3) contains a jurisdictional requirement that has to be fulfilled before an ICSID tribunal can assert jurisdiction. This decision is in accordance with the decision in *Wintershall*, where it was found for a very similar clause in the Argentina-Germany BIT, that 'Article 10(2) contains a time-bound prior-recourse-to-local-courts-clause, which mandates (not merely permits) litigation by the investor (for a definite period) in the domestic forum' *before the right to ICSID can even materialize*. *Impregilo* not having fulfilled this requirement, the Tribunal cannot find jurisdiction on the basis of Article 8(3) of the Argentina-Italy BIT \"348 (*emphasis supplied*).\n\n*Impregilo*, *supra* note 40, para. 118.\n\n422.\n\nThe quotation above describes clearly the reasons and grounds why I cannot but dissent *in toto* of the construction made by the Majority Decision on the requirement of the prior recourse to domestic courts as established in Article 8 of the Argentina-Italy BIT. This Article sets forth the conditions under which the present Tribunal may exercise jurisdiction in the case with the consent of those two States by their sovereign agreement embodied in the Argentina-Italy BIT, but not further or otherwise. As stated by the *Wintershall* tribunal with reference to the similar provision in the Argentina-Germany BIT:\n\n\"That an investor could choose at will to omit the second step (the 18-months domestic courts requirement) is simply not provided for nor even envisaged by the Argentina-Germany BIT - because (Argentina's) the Host State's 'consent' (standing offer) is premised on there being first submitted to the courts of competent jurisdiction in the Host State the entire dispute for resolution in local courts\".349\n\n*Wintershall*, *supra* note 9, para. 160(2 *)*.\n\n423.\n\nI am therefore in agreement with the concluding words of the *Daimler v. Argentina* award on the requirement that \"since the 18-months domestic courts provision constitutes a treaty-based pre-condition *to the Host States consent to arbitrate,* it cannot be bypassed or otherwise waived by the Tribunal\"350 by extrapolating on the consideration of the present requirement a \"futility threshold\" proposition to governments contained in the ILC draft articles on diplomatic protection, still within consideration in the UN General Assembly, in detriment of the integrity of the Argentina-Italy BIT and of the public international law rule of State's consent to jurisdiction (see above para. 386 of this Opinion).\n\n*Daimler*, *supra* note 1, para. 194.\n\n**(v) The jurisdictional nature of the obligations enshrined in Article 8(1)-(3) of the Argentina-Italy BIT.**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n424.\n\nThe question of the legal nature of the obligations enshrined in Article 8(1)-(3) of the Argentina-Italy BIT is very much in dispute between the Parties to the present case. While the Respondent insists that these provisions of the BIT create a \"multi-layered, sequential dispute resolution system\" constituting \"mandatory jurisdictional requirements\", Claimants' view is that these requirements only give rise to \"procedural prerequisites\"351 which may be eventually disregarded or waived. The Majority Decision avoids deciding this inter-Parties issue in the following terms:\n\n\"[...] irrespective of whether others may identify a different degree of \"bindingness\" with regard to the two notions, in this Tribunal's view and at least with regard to the requirements set forth by Art. 8(1)-(3) of the Argentina-Italy BIT, if any of these requirements *in their* *interpretation by the Tribunal and applied to the facts of the case,* has not been met by Claimants, the Tribunal would have to dismiss the case irrespective of whether the requirement would qualify as one of jurisdiction or admissibility\"352 (*emphasis supplied*).\n\nMajority Decision, para. 570.\n\n*Ibid,* para. 575.\n\n425.\n\nI belong to the \"others\" who identify a different degree of \"bindingness\" between the two notions and that consider further that, being the BITs bilateral treaties, ICSID arbitral tribunals have to respect and enforce *pacta sunt servanda* in the interpretation and application the disputeresolution provisions contained in those conventional instruments as agreed upon by the Contracting States concerned, Argentina and Italy in the instant case. To do otherwise would go against the legal security in investment relations between host States and private foreign investors and goes against the public international law rule of State's consent to jurisdiction governing the jurisdictional field at the international level.\n\n426.\n\nGenerally speaking, the so-called \"procedural requirements\", even in the form of mere prior \"waiting periods\" or \"cooling off periods\" for consultations or negotiations, or for any other purpose like litigation in domestic courts, are formulated in BITs in terms of mandatory jurisdictional requirements, its non-compliance justifying a finding of lack of jurisdiction. For example, Article 10(4) of the Argentina-Germany BIT provides that if no agreement were reached concerning the choice between ICSID or UNCITRAL arbitrations the dispute will be submitted to ICSID *following a three-month term* counted from a given date. And Article VII, paragraph 3(a), of the Argentina-United States BIT, a BIT invoked by Claimants in the present case (see below), provides that if the dispute has not been submitted for resolution under paragraph 2 (a) or (b) of the Article and *that six months have elapsed* from the date on which the dispute arose, the dispute may be submitted for settlement by binding arbitration, but not before. I am, therefore, generally in agreement with the following conclusion of the *Murphy v. Ecuador* tribunal:\n\n\"The Tribunal also does not accept the consequences Claimant seeks to derive between 'procedural' and 'jurisdictional' requirements. According to Murphy International, 'procedural requirements' are of an inferior category than the 'jurisdictional requirements' and, consequently, its non-compliance has no legal consequences. It is evident that in legal practice this does not occur, and non-compliance with a purely procedural requirement, such as, for example, the time to appeal a judgment can have serious consequences for the defaulting party.\"353\n\n*Murphy v. Ecuador*, *supra* note 338, para. 142.\n\n427.\n\nThus, even purely \"waiting periods\" or \"procedural requirements\" may be rendered \"jurisdictional\" (namely the so-called \"obstacles\" or \"hurdlers\" for a certain doctrine) by the wording, context or role attributed to it by the Contracting States within the dispute-resolution provision of the BIT concerned. It is obvious that it is not beyond the States' autonomy to contract in thereon through a BIT. Thus, it is likewise obvious that although there is an objective core-notion of what is \"jurisdictional\", Contracting States may also by agreement attribute to a given requirement a \"jurisdictional\" role (*ratione voluntatis* preconditions). In the instant case, the obligations enshrining in Article 8(1)-(3) of the Argentina-Italy BIT are, in my opinion, \"jurisdictional\" in nature by sharing the objective core-notion of the concept, as well as by the subjective will of Argentina and Italy as sovereign State Parties to the BIT.\n\n428.\n\nOf course, it may happen that in a given particular case the host State might acquiesce to forgive the foreign investor's compliance with one or more preconditions to international arbitration set forth in the BIT, even those jurisdictional in nature There are some examples of this kind in the field of investor-host State dispute settlement, for instance, in the *Wena Hotel* case (a waiting period requirement) and in the *Bayindir Insaat* case (a notice requirement). But, in the instant case none of the Parties to the dispute have pleaded the existence between them of such a kind of understanding. The Respondent insists on compliance with all the requirements in Article 8(1)-(3) of the BIT as \"jurisdictional\" and the Claimants in its \"procedural\" nature and, under the circumstances, dispensable.\n\n429.\n\nThe preconditions to international arbitration in the dispute-resolution provisions of BITs are, as a general rule, \"jurisdictional\" in nature by the simple fact that they relate and limit the power of the international arbitral tribunals to decide on the merits of the dispute. *This is the established jurisprudence of the ICJ on the matter,* summarized in the following passage of its 2006 Judgment on \"Jurisdiction of the Court and Admissibility of the Application\" in the *Armed Activities on the Territory of the Congo (New Application: 2002)* :\n\n\"The Court recalls in this regard that its jurisdiction is based on the consent of the parties and *is confined to the extent accepted by them...* when that consent is expressed in a compromissory clause in an international agreement (for example in a BIT), *any conditions to which such consent is subject must be regarded as constituting the limits thereon. The court accordingly considers that the examination of such conditions relates to its jurisdiction and not to the admissibility of the application\".*354\n\n*Supra* note 280, p. 39, para. 88. The Court mentioned eight previous Judgments in support of its finding (*ibid*.) and applied it to all compromissory clauses invoked by the Applicant in the case (*ibid,* p. 40, para. 88). This jurisprudence continuous to be applied by the Court, as illustrated by the 2011 Judgment on preliminary objections in the *Case Concerning the Application of the CERD (Georgia v. Russian Federation)*, *supra* note 283, see para. 131.\n\n430.\n\nThe same criterion continues to be applied by the ICJ as, for example, in the 2011 Judgment in the *Georgia v. Russian Federation (preliminary objections)* case relating to the application of the CERD Convention. In its Judgment concerning the *Armed Activities in the Territory of Congo (New Application 2002)* case, the ICJ applied that jurisdictional criterion to all the titles invoked by the Applicant and irrespective of the kind of precondition at issue as follows:\n\nConvention on Discrimination against Women (Article 29) - The Court was not satisfied that the Applicant in fact sought to commence \"negotiations\" and noted also that the Applicant failed to prove attempts on its part to initiate an \"arbitration\" precondition in the following terms:\n\n\"The Court cannot in this regard accept the DRC's argument that the impossibility of opening or advancing in negotiations with Rwanda prevented it from contemplating having recourse to arbitration; *since this is a condition formally set out in Article 29 of the Convention on Discrimination against Women, the lack of agreement between the parties as to the organization of an arbitration cannot be presumed. The existence of such disagreement can follow only from a proposal for arbitration by the applicant, to which the respondent has made no answer or which it has expressed its intention not to accept. In the present case, the Court has found nothing in the file which would enable it* *to conclude that the DRC made a proposal to Rwanda that arbitration proceedings should be organized, and that the latter failed to respond thereto*\"355 (*emphasis supplied*).\n\nWHO Constitution (Article 75) - The Court noted that, even if the DRC had proved the existence of a question or dispute falling within the scope of the said Article:\n\n\"it has in any event not proved that the other preconditions for seisin the Court established by the provision have been satisfied, *namely that it attempted to settle the question or dispute by negotiation with Rwanda or that the World Health Assembly had been unable to settle it*\"356 (*emphasis supplied*).\n\nUNESCO Constitution (Article XIV(2)) and Montreal Convention (Article 14(1)) - The Court reached *mutatis mutandis* similar conclusions because the applicant failed to show that the prior procedures to seisin the Court pursuant to those treaty provisions were followed, concluding that it had no jurisdiction to entertain the application as in the case of the previous titles of jurisdiction invoked by the applicant.\n\n*Supra* note 280, p. 41, para. 92.\n\n*Ibid,* p. 43, para. 100.\n\n431.\n\nThis jurisprudence of the Court has inspired a number of decisions and awards of ICSID and other arbitral tribunals dealing with investor-host State investment disputes, as well as domestic court decisions rejecting investor's arguments to the contrary. A perusal of the decisions of the said arbitral tribunals does bear out very much the proposition that preconditions to international arbitration as the requirements in Article 8 of the Argentina-Italy BIT, namely amicable consultations and 18 months litigation in local courts, are requirements in the nature of \"jurisdictional requirements\" whose omission or failure to comply would result in a determination of lack of jurisdiction. See, for example, among others: *Maffezini* (2000) (paras. 35-6); *Enron Creditors Recovery* (2006) (para. 88); *Wintershall* (2008) (paras. 155-56); *Murphy v. Ecuador* (2010) (paras. 156-57); *Impregilo* (2011) (para. 94); *ICS Inspection and Control Services* (2012) (para. 262); *Daimler* (2012) (paras. 193-94). Faced with the aggregate of the ICJ's jurisprudence and investor-State case-law in investment disputes, the Majority Decision justifies its declared non-definition of the legal nature of the requirements of Article 8 of the Argentina-Italy BIT by referring to the 2011 *Abaclat* majority decision,357 namely to a decision that has been commented by doctrine as \"*sidestepping jurisdictional requirements, and instead introducing 'admissibility' criteria*\".358\n\nMajority Decision, para. 570.\n\nHans van Houte and Bridie McAsey, *Cases Comment, Abaclat and others v. Argentina Republic. ICSID, the BIT and Mass Claims, supra* note 52, p. 233.\n\n432.\n\nSome arbitral decisions (i.e. *Ethyl Corporation v. Canada* ; *Lauder v. Czech Republic* ; *SGS v. Pakistan*) have found that the failing to comply with periods designed to encourage means of settlement by consultations or negotiations would not deprive the arbitral tribunal of jurisdiction. These three cases are referred to in footnote 298 of the Majority Decision together with others less pertinent.359 They reflect the practice on admissibility objections in domestic courts. But this cannot hold up in public international law as a proposition susceptible of generalisation when the requirements considered *constitute treaty-based preconditions to the host State's consent to arbitrate the dispute, as in the case of Article 8 of the Argentina-Italy BIT,* and that furthermore, in the instant case, are formulated in mandatory language. As is stated in the *Daimler v. Argentina* award:\n\n\"However, admissibility analyses patterned on domestic court practice have no relevance for BIT-based jurisdictional decisions in the context of investor-State disputes. In the domestic courts, admissibility requirements are judicially constructed rules designed to preserve the efficiency and integrity of court proceedings. *They do not expand the jurisdiction of domestic courts.* Rather, they serve to streamline courts' dockets by striking out matters which the jurisdiction of the courts, are for one reason or another not appropriate for adjudication at the particular time or in the particular manner in question\"360 (*emphasis supplied*).\n\nFor example, in *Bayindir Insaat*, *supra* note 214, Pakistan as the respondent State in the case admitted that the notice requirement did not constitute a prerequisite for jurisdiction (see *Wintershall*, *supra* note 9, p. 89, para. 152.)\n\n*Daimler*, *supra* note 1, para. 192.\n\n433.\n\nIt should be added that in the Argentina-Italy BIT, the period of time reserved for amicable consultations is governed by terms such as \"insofar as possible\" (Article 8(1)) and Article 8(3) for litigation in domestic courts a fixed period of \"18 months\" (Article 8(3)). Both terms are treaty-based sharing and have, consequently, the same \"jurisdictional\" nature of their respective requirement because conditioning or limiting the extent of the Argentine Republic's consent to international arbitration and, in turn, the Tribunal's power to adjudicate the merits of the present dispute. They do not raise an admissibility issue in public international law, but a jurisdictional one.\n\n434.\n\nIn sum, the \"preconditions\" to international arbitration set forth in Article 8 of the Argentina-Italy BT are both treaty-based \"jurisdictional requirements\" which as such should have been enforced by the Tribunal in accordance with international law as reflected in the established jurisprudence of the ICJ and in investor-State dispute arbitration case-law; the reason being that those preconditions limit the extent of the Argentine Republic's consent to international arbitration and, consequently, the Tribunal's power to decide the merits of the dispute.\n\n435.\n\nEven investment arbitral decisions upholding that a given MFN clause in a BIT provides for, *in toto* or in part, an alternative title of jurisdiction have treated the issue, as they should, namely as a jurisdictional question (i.e. *RostInvest*, *Quasar de Valors*, *Hochtief*) *.*361 The treatment of the \"requirement\" of exhaustion of local remedies as an \"admissibility issue\" as referred to in footnote 288 of the Majority Decision is consequential to the content and operation of that \"material rule\" of customary international law linked to the exercise by States of the \"diplomatic protection\" of its nationals.\n\n*Hochtief v. Argentine* decision on jurisdiction, *supra* note 306, refers to the distinction between \"jurisdiction\" and \"admissibility\" in its reasoning concerning the topic entitled \"*MNF and jurisdictional limits*\" (paras. 90, 91 and 94 of the decision).\n\n**2. Consent of the Claimants**\n-------------------------------\n\n**(a) The international arbitration consented by Claimants in their Request for Arbitration**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n436.\n\nThe Claimants filed a Request for Arbitration at ICSID on 23 June 2008. In the Introduction of the Request, Claimants limit themselves to indicate: \"This is a Request for Arbitration pursuant to Article 36 of the Washington Convention of 18 March 1965 and Article 8, para. 5(a), of the Agreement between the Argentine Republic and the Italian Republic on the Reciprocal Promotion and Protection of Investments (the \"BIT\") signed in Buenos Aires on 22 May 1990 and in force from 14 October 1 993.362 According to Article 36(2) of the ICSID Convention, a request for arbitration shall contain information concerning (i) the issues in dispute, (ii) the identity of the parties, and (iii) the *consent to arbitration of the parties to the dispute*, in accordance with the ICSID Institution Rules. Article 8(5)(a), of the Argentina-Italy BIT regulates the election by the investor of the international arbitration body, ICSID arbitration in the instant case.\n\nRequest for Arbitration, para.1\n\n437.\n\nThe information of the Request concerning the *consent to arbitration of the Parties to the present dispute* does not appear until rather the end of the Request in Section XII of the document entitled \"The Parties have consented in writing to ICSID Jurisdiction\". Section XII begins recalling that Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention does not require a specific form for the manifestation of the parties' written consent, but merely required that the consent be given prior to the filing of the Request for Arbitration.363 In this respect, it should be pointed out that in the present case the Claimants did not provide any evidence, and did not argue, of having given any written consent to the present arbitration before filing their Request of 23 June 2008.\n\n*Ibid.,* para.81.\n\n438.\n\nThereafter, Section XII of the Request goes on explaining the formation of the necessary *undertaking to arbitrate* between the Parties to the present dispute as follows:\n\n\"82. It is commonly admitted by case-law and the most authoritative doctrine that a Contracting State's consent to submit a dispute or category of disputes to ICSID arbitration may result from a unilateral undertaking or a public offer by that State to submit such disputes to ICSID, as expressed in national law or in an international treaty on the protection of foreign investments. Foreign investors have *the right to accept such an offer once a dispute has arisen* between them and the offering State.\n\n83. In the present case, Argentina's offer to Italian investors to refer investment disputes to ICSID is expressed in Article 8 of the BIT, which provides the following: (quotation of the text of paragraphs (1) to (5)(a) of the Argentina-Italy BIT)\".\n\n84. As to the Claimants' acceptance of the Argentina's offer of ICSID arbitration it is commonly admitted that the investor's acceptance of the host State's offer can be manifested, *inter alia,* by filing a request for arbitration to ICSID. For these purposes, *the Claimants* *hereby accept to submit the dispute to ICSID arbitration by signing and filing this Request for Arbitration.\"*\n\n85. Pursuant to Article 2(3) of the ICSID Institution Rules, the *date of consent* is considered to be 'the date on which the second party (i.e. the investor) acted'. In the present case such date is the date of submission of this request\" (*emphasis supplied*).\n\n439.\n\nSo far so good. But, immediately after, the Claimants' Request for Arbitration contradicts itself by stating that: \"The *conditions* set out in Article 8 of the BIT *are clearly inapplicable* in the present case\"364 (*emphasis supplied*). This statement, and related Claimants' argument all along this phase of the proceeding, raises an issue of paramount importance for the continuation of the proceeding in the case, namely the jurisdictional question of whether or not the undertaking to arbitrate (*convenci\u00f3n de arbitraje*) as between the Parties to the present dispute was actually executed by the Claimants when filing at ICSID on 23 June 2008 their Request for Arbitration, as affirmed by Claimants in the above quoted paragraph 84 of the Request.\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 86\n\n440.\n\nIn the light of the above statement of the Request, can it be affirmed that the consent of the Claimants as given in the filed Request and the consent of the Respondent manifested in the \"offer\" were at idem on 23 June 2008 so that the necessary undertaking to arbitrate between the Parties for submission of the alleged dispute to ICSID arbitration was duly executed on that day? It is clear to me, in the light of the concurring facts that, on that date, each of the Parties to the dispute accepted as a principle ICSID arbitration as a means of settlement of investor-State investment disputes, but not on the submission of the Claimants' alleged multiparty investment dispute to ICSID arbitration. The legal cause for that evident conclusion is that on 23 June 2008 the Claimants' Request by no means accepted the terms of the *\"offer\"* of the Argentine Republic to Italian private investors in its territory embodied in the dispute-resolution sequential system of Article 8, paras. (1) to (3), of the Argentina-Italy BIT, whose preconditions to international arbitration constitute, as already explained, the limits of the Respondent's consent to international arbitration as it is well established by a steady international jurisprudence.\n\n441.\n\nAs explained in Section 1 of the present Chapter of this Opinion, the Claimants have indeed \"*the right to accept such an offer*\",365 but surely \"*not the right to alter or modify that offer*\" as they did by giving in substance their consent to an unilateral direct access to ICSID international arbitration which is not part and parcel of the \"offer\" of the Respondent State, while declaring playing with words, in the above quoted paragraph 84 of the Request, their \"*acceptance of the Argentina's offer of ICSID arbitration*\" *.* The Claimants' reporting information on the motives of their own conduct set out in the three last paragraphs of Section XII of their Request for Arbitration does not allow any doubt in that respect. Claimants did not accept Respondent's \"offer\" but something else.\n\nSee paras.106-116 of the present Opinion.\n\n442.\n\nAs secondary treaty rights holders, the Claimants are not in the possession of any bargaining right aiming at amending the terms and conditions of the \"offer\" made by the two States Parties to the BIT. They may or may not accept the \"offer\" with its terms and conditions, but they lack *locus standing* to try in fact to a redefinition of the standing offer in terms of a right of unilateral direct access to international arbitration non-existent in the BIT, or to appeal to the present Tribunal to apply to the case, under pretext of interpretation, a version of the disputeresolution mechanism of article 8 of the BIT different to the one manifestly agreed by Argentina and Italy when the two States concluded the BIT in 1 990.366\n\nSee paras.378-383 of the present Opinion.\n\n443.\n\nIn effect, concerning for example the first mandatory prior requirement to international arbitration, namely the entering or engaging \"amicable consultations\" with the host State with a view to resolve, in so far as possible, the investment dispute (Article 8(1) of the BIT), Claimants admit not having complied with this prerequisite of the Respondent's \"offer\", invoking in that respects three general considerations: (i) that it is apparent from the description of the facts underlying the dispute, as presented in the Request for Arbitration, that Argentina has always displayed a hostile and uncooperative attitude towards the Claimants; (ii) that the possibility of reaching an amicable settlement was precluded by Law No. 26,017 of 9 February 2005; and (iii) that Argentina's behaviour in the present case is similar to the ones held by it since the beginning of 2001, for which Argentina has already been held liable **.**367\n\nRequest for Arbitration, para. 87.\n\n444.\n\nNone of these three general considerations are, in public international law, susceptible of derogating, reforming or suspending the jurisdictional conventional obligation of means bestowed upon any purported Claimants by Article 8(1) of the BIT, a precondition limiting as such the scope of the Respondent's consent to the international arbitration of the \"offer\". Moreover, even if, for the sake of argument, one would admit that any or all the above considerations would have the effect of liberating the Claimants from the prior amicable consultations obligation, the total absence of evidence of a genuine attempt by them to enter or engage in \"amicable consultations\" means not only that they failed altogether to comply with that precondition but also that their consent to ICSID arbitration did not match the consent to arbitration embodied in the Respondent's \"offer\".\n\n445.\n\nThis complete absence of *any attempt* to engage with the Respondent in amicable consultations prescribed by the BIT, together with the kind of excuses advanced, shows also that when filing their Request for Arbitration the Claimants did not intend to match the Argentina's consent to international arbitration as in the \"offer\" in order to execute the corresponding arbitral undertaking between the Parties to dispute, but to get from the present Tribunal an unilateral, unconditional and unreserved access to ICSID arbitration going far beyond the extent of the consent to international arbitration given by the Argentine Republic in its \"offer\" of Article 8 of the Argentina-Italy BIT.\n\n446.\n\nThat intention is confirmed by the fact that none of the alleged excuses prevent obviously Claimants addressing a communication to the Respondent asking for the opening of amicable consultations or giving notice that in case of rejection by the Respondent of such an opening, they will institute arbitral proceedings at ICSID, as did the Italian claimants in the *Abaclat and others* case without difficulties with their letter to the Argentine Ministry of Economy and Production.368 Law No. 26,017, for example, does not preclude Claimants from sending such kind of communications to the Respondent and, in any case, the former are not arguing having suffered any material impossibility (original or supervening) of performing such kind of acts before filing the Request for Arbitration or being in some other way prevented from complying with the prerequisite of the \"amicable consultations\" of Article 8(1) of the BIT.\n\nTAF letter of 28 February 2006 (see para. 66 of the present Opinion).\n\n447.\n\nThis conduct is indeed revealing that the actual intention of the Claimants was to pursue ICSID arbitration but not the ICSID arbitration consented by the Respondent in Article 8 the Argentina-Italy BIT given therein by the Contracting States expressly \"for the purpose, and in conformity with the terms of this Agreement\" and not further or otherwise. The Claimants themselves admit, as indicated, that they have not complied with the prerequisite of amicable consultations arguing that it would be clearly inapplicable to them in the circumstances of the present case. But the Majority Decision disregarding altogether that admission concludes that the Claimants \"*did not violate the requirement incumbent upon them by virtue of Article 8(1)*\" of the BIT.369\n\nMajority Decision, para.588.\n\n448.\n\nI reject that conclusion of the Majority Decision because it is the result of a devious and unlikely interpretation of the ordinary meaning of the words \"in so far as possible\" within Article 8(1) of the BIT, off of track with the VCLT interpretation rules and on the basis of merely *speculating grounds* because no evidence has being submitted to the effect that the Respondent replied to a Claimants' demarche showing no interest in entering into \"amicable consultations\". Then, as established by the jurisprudence of the ICJ and of the PCIJ, the invocation of failure, deadlock or futility of a given consultation or negotiation precondition is in order *only where* *consultations or negotiations are attempted or have commenced, not before that attempt or commencement as in the instant case.*370 Further, as has been recently declared by the Court, \"the rules which determine the scope and extent of jurisdiction and when that jurisdiction may be exercised do not derogate from (the) substantives rules, nor...would require their modification or would displace their application\" (2012 ICJ Judgment in the *Jurisdictional Immunities of the State (Germany v. Italy; Greece Intervening,* para. 95) and - I would add - the same is true the other way around, namely that the substantive rules of international law, independently of its nature and protected values, do not derogate, modify or displace the rules determining the scope, extent or exercise of international jurisdiction governed by the consent of the parties to the dispute.\n\nSee the ICJ judgment of 1 April 2011 in the *Case concerning the Application of the CERD (Georgia v. Russian Federation)*, *supra* note 283, para.159.\n\n449.\n\nThe non-compliance either by Claimants with the second mandatory precondition to arbitration of Article 8 of the BIT, namely with the submission of the dispute to Argentine courts for a period of 18 months before resorting to international arbitration, corroborates that when filing the Request for Arbitration at ICSID the consent given by the Claimants was actually a consent to an international arbitration bypassing the sequential dispute-resolution system of the BIT, trying to put in its place an unconditional ICSID arbitration in total disregard of the \"offer\" made by Argentina and Italy in the BIT. As in the case of the amicable consultation precondition there is also total absence of evidence of any genuine attempt by the Claimants to institute litigation in Argentine courts for an 18 months period as prescribed by Article 8(2) and (3) of the BIT\n\n450.\n\nThis time, the Claimants invoked in the Request, in an effort to justify their conduct, the following three general considerations: (i) that the consistent jurisprudence of international arbitral tribunals demonstrates that the provision does not constitute an obstacle to the offer of arbitration contained in the BIT; (ii) that in the present case the Claimants were effectively inhibited from challenging Argentina's preposterous Public Offer of Exchange (the 2005 POE) in light of Article 6 of Law No. 26,017; and (iii) that the resort to Argentine courts would have been an *entirely futile exercise*, since it would be clearly impossible for the local courts to decide the case in only 18 months.371\n\nRequest for Arbitration, paras. 88 and 89. Subsequently to the filing of the Request, in the Counter Memorial (paras. 412-15), the Claimants invoked also to justify their non-compliance with the local courts prior requirement the decision of Argentine Supreme Court of 5 April 2005 in the *Galli* case (Annex CLA-37). Contrary to the Majority Decision, I cannot but reject also the *Galli* argument because that case concerned Argentine nationals subject to Argentine laws, not foreigners allegedly protected by an international treaty like the Argentina-Italy BIT. No evidence was submitted concerning Argentine judicial decisions relating to foreigners under special treaty protection.\n\n451.\n\nThe \"consistent jurisprudence\" argument is inaccurate and did not correspond when the Request for Arbitration was filed on 23 June 2008 to the actual ICSID case-law situation. The \"effectively inhibition\" argument because of Law 26,017 is untenable in the absence of evidence that Argentine courts rejected any attempt by Claimants of instituting litigation because of the said Law, lack of a cause of action or some other way preventing them from complying with the rule in Article 8(2) and (3). As to the \"impossibility\" or \"futility\" to resolve the dispute in 18 months it is an argument based upon an incorrect reading of the core-meaning of that rule of the BIT,372 as well as on speculative grounds on the Argentine domestic courts capabilities in the light of the *Galli* and other decisions of the Argentine Supreme Court concerning *domestic bondholders.*373 For me, in the present instance the Claimants' plea of the *entirely futility exercise of litigation in Argentine domestic courts* is indeed merely speculative as the Argentine courts were never presented with Claimants' claims. Thus, futility has not been established in the first place by the facts of the case relating to the conduct of Claimants. It is not therefore a case of obvious futility. Speculative arguments are not supposed to derogate *pacta sunt servanda* nor the international law rule of State's consent to jurisdiction with its corollaries.\n\nThe conventional rule at stake is not premised on the proposition that the dispute is to be solved in 18 months in domestic courts, but on the different assumption that the dispute be submitted to domestic courts of the host State, Argentina in the present case, for a period of 18 months for trying to resolve the dispute before submitting it to international arbitration, by a sovereign common decision of Argentina and Italy (Article 8(2) and (3) of the BIT).\n\nThere is not evidence of any attempt by the Claimants to seize Argentine domestic courts of the dispute. It is, therefore, without evidence in support that the Majority Decision concludes that the arguments referred in the said decisions of the Supreme Court apply \"with equal force to non-domestic bondholders\", engaging thereafter in highly speculative, unnecessary and out of place considerations on Argentine Constitution and judicial domestic proceedings, including on costs when Claimants have instituted international proceedings which are not precisely gratuitous (paras. 618-623 of the Majority Decision).\n\n452.\n\nBut, the Majority Decision does just that. On one hand, it admits the binding character of the recourse to domestic court of Article 8 of the BIT and that the Claimants, secondary treaty-right holders, failed to satisfy that conventional obligation. But, on the other hand, the Majority Decision - as it did with respect to the amicable consultation - states that \"it cannot be concluded that the requirement of having recourse to Respondent's domestic courts, as set forth in Art. 8(2) and (3) of the Argentina-Italy BIT, was violated by Claimants\"374. This conclusion of the Majority Decision up-holds therefore the \"futility exception\" invoked by the Claimants in the following terms:\n\n\"[\u2026] an interpretation strictly faithful to the requirements of Art. 31 of VCLT, notably Art. 31(3)(c) of the Vienna Convention, leads to identify a futility exception in the pertinent *lex lata,* i.e. Art. 8(2) and (3) of the Argentina-Italy BIT\".375\n\nMajority Decisi\u00f3n, para. 628.\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 626.\n\n453.\n\nThis finding is based, in my opinion, upon a reasoning carrying with it serious departures from the international law applicable to the jurisdictional and admissibility issues at stake as well as from fundamental rules of international arbitral procedure applicable to the Tribunal's exercise of the power to determine its own competence (Article 41 of the ICSID Convention). On the applicable international law, the reasoning of the Majority Decision tries to move by all means from the consent to jurisdiction *pacta* between the Parties to the dispute to the field of international responsibility for wrongful acts. In other words, it tries to switch off the rules of the game from \"consent\" and relevant \"treaty law\" and move to the field of \"responsibility law\".\n\n454.\n\nThis explains why the Majority Decision in its paragraphs 588 and 628 frames its respective findings on the amicable consultations precondition and on the recourse to domestic courts precondition in terms of *no violation by the Claimants of the corresponding provisions of Article 8 of the BIT.* But, the \"violation\" or \"no violation\" by any one of the Parties of the provisions of the BIT is not an issue in the present phase of the case. What is the subject-matter of the present phase is the determination by the Tribunal of the existence and scope of each of the Parties to consent to ICSID arbitration and whether both consents match each other executing thereby the necessary *undertaking to arbitrate (convenci\u00f3n de arbitraje).* In other words, the determination of whether or not \"the parties to the dispute consent in writing to submit (the dispute) to the Centre\" (Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention).\n\n455.\n\nThis unwarranted departure from the rules governing consent to jurisdiction at the international law level, and related treaty law, finds further confirmation in the fact that the Majority Decision picks on a \"futility exception\" - *as an implied condition in the conventional obligation set forth in Article 8(2) and (3) of the Argentina-Italy BIT -* of the exhaustion of local remedies rule of customary international law allegedly applied in the diplomatic protection field. But, neither Argentina nor Italy have required to applied that rule when joining the ICSID Convention or, thereafter, when they consented to ICSID arbitration as embodied in their 1990 BIT (Articles 25 and 26 of the ICSID Convention). Furthermore, the special rules of the ICSID system exclude diplomatic protection altogether unless the Contracting State concerned failed to abide by and comply with the award rendered in the dispute (Article 27). The Majority Decision is therefore premised on the assumption that foreign protected investors may claim simultaneously in an ICSID arbitration proceeding what they considered unilaterally as advantageous for them in both the special conventional ICSID system with its BITs and in customary international law relating to diplomatic protection.\n\n456.\n\nLast but not least, the Majority Decision identifies *ex officio* the threshold of the applied \"futility exception\" in one of the exceptions to the customary exhaustion of local remedies rule set out in Article 15(a) of the 2006 ILC draft articles on diplomatic protection, a draft under consideration since then by Governments within the General Assembly of the United Nations. But, on one hand, \"futility\" has not been demonstrated in the instant case, nor that the relief sought was patently unavailable within the Argentine legal system or completely ineffective at resolving the dispute. On the other hand, the threshold in question goes further than the exception to the local remedies exhaustion rule codified in Article 44(b) of the ILC Articles on Responsibility for Internationally Wrongful Acts, Articles called to the attention of States by General Assembly Resolution 56/83 of 12 December 2001. Furthermore, the Majority Decision relies on the said threshold notwithstanding the reservation of Article 17 of the 2006 ILC draft articles on Diplomatic Protection to the effect that those draft articles \"do not apply to the extent that they are inconsistent with special rules of international law, *such as treaty provisions for the protection of investments*\" (*emphasis supplied*). In those circumstances to apply such a threshold, whatever its existence or scope may be, as a supposed \"futility-exception-implied-condition\" in Article 8(2) and (3) of the 1990 Argentina-Italy BIT forming part of the positive international law applicable in the relations between the two countries cannot be qualified but as an incomprehensible and *ultra vires* decision of the Majority. The Majority Decision is creating out of the blue an exception to the treaty dispute-resolution provisions of Article 8 of the Argentina-Italy BIT (*pacta sunt servanda)* unknown to the Contracting Parties and invoking Article 31(3)(c) of the VCLT in support of that pretending exception, while disregarding that this Article of the Vienna Convention sends back the interpreter to the positive international law applicable in the relations between Argentina and Italy such as the rules governing the jurisdiction of international tribunals, the consent of the parties to the dispute in the first place, and the very system of interpretation of treaties of the Convention based essentially in the textual approach which, in the present case, applied as both conventional and customary international law rules.\n\n457.\n\nThe provisions in Article 8(2) and (3) of the BIT are not obviously a conventional version of the exhaustion of local remedies customary rule of international law which has no role to play at the least in the instant phase of the case. But, the above perusal of the reasoning and conclusions of the Majority Decision on the matter is quite relevant to confirm once more that the Claimants' given consent to ICSID arbitration is not a consent *ad idem* with the Respondent's consent to international arbitration embodied in the \"offer\" of Article 8 of the BIT. They filed the Request for Arbitration with the reservation or caveat that the preconditions to international arbitration of that Article were inapplicable to them (paragraph 86 of the Request), pleaded so, and adopted all along a conduct showing that they never departed from an attitude of non-compliance as a matter of right.\n\n458.\n\nIn the light of the considerations above, I concluded that the consent to arbitration manifested by the Claimants by filing at ICSID the Request for Arbitration of 23 June 2008 did not match the Respondent's consent to ICSID arbitration embodied in the \"offer\" contained in Article 8 of the Argentina-Italy BIT and that, as a result, the necessary undertaking to arbitrate between the Parties to the dispute (*convenci\u00f3n de arbitraje*) has not being duly executed. In consequence, the present Arbitral Tribunal is also, on the basis of that finding, without competence to entertain and adjudicate the merits of the case.\n\n**(b) The invocation of the MFN clause in Article 3(1) of the Argentina-Italy BIT as an alternative base of jurisdiction**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n459.\n\nThe MFN clause of Article 3 of the Argentina-Italy BIT was mentioned in the Request for Arbitration in connection with alleged violations by Argentina of a \"substantive standard\" of protection only, namely the full protection and security standard.376 But, in the CounterMemorial the Claimants declared that Article 3 of the BIT \"rules out any obligation of recourse to domestic courts\", alleging that both the \"MFN clause argument\" and the \"futility argument\" allow non-compliance by Claimants with the prior recourse to Argentine courts, as required by Article 8(2) and (3) of the BIT.377 In the Reply, the Respondent asserted that the Claimants were procedurally precluded from relying on the MFN clause for that additional purpose because they had failed to do so in the Request for Arbitration.378\n\nRequest for Arbitration, paras. 61-69.\n\nClaimants' Counter Memorial, paras. 400-423.\n\nRespondent's Reply, para. 476.\n\n460.\n\nThe Claimants rejected that assertion of the Respondent in their Rejoinder379 but, at the hearing, they remained silent on the plea that the MFN clause of Article 3 of the BIT rules out any obligation for them to have prior recourse to Argentine courts for a period of 18 months as required by the BIT. This prompted the Respondent to propose that the Claimants' plea of the MFN clause as ruling out their obligation of recourse to domestic courts should be dismissed *in* *limine* by the Tribunal.380 But, Claimants made again a reference to the MFN clause of Article 3(1) of the BIT in connection with their non-compliance with the domestic courts requirement.381\n\nClaimants' Rejoinder, paras. 190-191.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing-Brief, paras. 98-102.\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing-Brief, para. 117.\n\n461.\n\nAs explained in its paragraph 629, the Majority Decision did not need to enter into the question whether the MFN clause in Article 3(1) may have entitled Claimants to rely on the allegedly more favourable dispute-resolution clause contained in Article VII(3) of the Argentina-United States BIT. Thus, the Majority Decision did not decide the procedural inadmissibility objection raised thereon by the Respondent. For my part, I esteem that given my findings in the present preliminary objection phase, I have to answer in this Opinion the Claimants' jurisdictional claim concerning the applicability of the MFN clause in Article 3(1) to disputeresolution. I will therefore supplement below the general consideration of public international law in Section 1 (iv) of the present Chapter on the scope of application of general drafted MFN clauses and the *ejusdem generis* principle with some additional more specific considerations as to the interpretation of Article 3(1) of the Argentine-Italy BIT.\n\n462.\n\nI will refer to as briefly as possible to some interpretative elements and factors which make the Claimants' argument on the MFN clause in Article 3(1) of the BIT unpersuasive for me. In the first place to follow the Claimants' argument would mean to adopt an extensive interpretation of Article 3(1) in contradiction to the VCLT approach to treaty interpretation which rules out restrictive as well as extensive interpretations, adopting instead expansive doctrinal positions aiming at *multilateralization* dispute-resolution provisions in BITs through MFN clauses,382 in total contradiction with the systemic international law rule of the State's consent to jurisdiction (with its corollaries) and to the *ejusdem generic* principle governing the operation of the MFN clause. I will also bear in mind that as stated in the 2012 award in *Inspection and Control* *Services and Argentina* case *:* \"In the mass of different answers to this question and the many articulations of each answer, it should not be forgotten that, at its root, what is being engaged in is an exercise in treaty interpretation, *the results of which are inherently particular to the treaty*  *being interpreted*\"*.*383\n\nSee, for example, Stephan Schill, *Most-Favored-Nation Clauses as a Basis of Jurisdiction in Investment Ttreaty Arbitration - Arbitral Jurisprudence at a Crossroad,* The Journal of World Investment &Trade, April 2009, p.203. Quoted by Claimants, see Rejoinder, p. 56, para.194.\n\n*Inspection and Control Services* award on jurisdiction of 10 February 2012, *supra* note 12, p. 91, para.275.\n\n463.\n\nIn effect, the BITs are treaties belonging to the international legal order and deriving its force from the *pacta sunt servanda* rule of that order. Consequently, its terms and provisions must be interpreted \"according to the normal rules of interpretation of treaties and without losing sight of the principles and rules of international law applicable in the relations between the Contracting Parties to the BIT\"384 (Article 31(3)(c) of the VCLT), including the rule of State's consent to jurisdiction and the *ejusdem generis* principle. One must approach the interpretative process by recalling the text of Article 3(1) of the Argentina-Italy BIT which reads as follows:\n\n\"Each Contracting Party, within the ambit of its own territory, shall accord to the investments made by investors from the other Contracting Party, to the income and activities related to such investments, and to all other matters regulated by this Agreement, a treatment that is no less favourable than that accorded to its own investors or investors from third party States\".\n\n*Ibid.,* p.92/93, para.279.\n\n464.\n\nThe text of Article 3(1) *is not therefore explicit* as to its application to dispute-resolution matters *and international law does not construe a State's silence as consent to the jurisdiction of a given international court or tribunal*.385 Other general considerations which should likewise be born in mind in an interpretation of Article 3(1) of the BIT are: (i) that it combines in a single provision \"national treatment\" and \"most-favoured-nation treatment\"; (ii) that Article 3 is placed second among the \"substantive or material protection clauses\" (Article 2 to 7 of the BIT) and is therefore clearly differentiated in the overall scheme of the treaty from the definitions (Article 1), dispute-resolution provisions (Articles 8 and 9) and final clauses of the instrument (Articles 10 to 13), (iii) that all treatments excluded by Article 3(2) from the treatment accorded to in Article 3(1) are also substantive or material in character; (iv) that the MFN treatment is granted by Article 3(1) to the \"investments\", the \"investors\" have not been expressly granted \"MFN treatment\" in Article 3(1);386 (v) Article 3(1) is formulated in terms of \"treatment\" of the investment of investors while Article 8 of the Argentina-Italy BIT concerns dispute-settlement \"rights\" and \"duties\" of investors and Contracting States.\n\n*Daimler*, *supra* note 1, para. 277.\n\nThe terms \"investment\" and \"investor\" are defined separately in Article 1 of the Argentina-Italy BIT. The distinction has been relevant in some investment arbitration case-law, for example in *RostInvest*. However, the *RostInvest* quotation in paragraph 193 of the Claimants' Rejoinder relates to a MNF clause provision relating to \"investors\", not to \"investments\" (paras. 131-132 of the Decision).\n\n465.\n\nIt is also relevant to bear in mind what the text of Article 3(1) does not say expressly or by implication. For example, that Article 3(1) does not have any cross-reference to Article 8 of the BIT or, for the matter, to dispute-resolution \"matters\" or \"activities\" relating thereto. At the same time, it is equally true that the Article 3(2) does not carve out expressly the said matters and/or activities from Article 3(1). However, being \"dispute-resolution\" excluded from a general drafted MFN clause by the operation of the *ejusdem generis* principle of international law, it is entirely possible that it did not occur to the Contracting Parties that the MFN clause in Article 3(1) of the BIT could one day be invoked by an investor to bypass stipulations on dispute-resolution expressly contracting in by them in Article 8 of the BIT.387\n\nAs it is the declared purpose of the Claimants in the present case with respect to the prior requirement of the 18 months litigation in Argentine courts provided for in Article 8(2) and (3) of the BIT.\n\n466.\n\nThe principle of contemporaneousness is another element to be born in mind in the interpretative process. After all, the Argentina-Italy BIT was concluded 10 years before *Maffezini,* namely at a time when the general accepted prevailing view was, as stated by the ICJ in the *Anglo-Iranian Oil Company (United Kingdom v. Iran)* case, that \"the most-favourednation clause [\u2026] has no relation whatsoever to jurisdictional matters between the two Governments\".388 A tribunal has to take account of the consequences of the parties' commitments but in so far as these commitments appear as having being reasonably and legitimately envisaged by the parties to the agreement (*Amco Asia*) which cannot be the case with the present instance.\n\n*Judgment*, I.C.J. Reports 1952, p.110. For an analysis of the jurisprudence of the ICJ and other precedents see: Zachary Douglas, *International Law of Investment Claims, supra* note 166, pp.345-356.\n\n467.\n\nTerms in Article 3(1) of the Argentina-Italy BIT such as \"treatment\", \"activities\" or \"all other matters\" are certainly capable of a broad meaning, but an interpretation undertaken in conformity with the VCLT does not end with the consideration of those terms in isolation. It is not, therefore, possible to affirm, without further ado, that the provision of a MFN clause as the one embodied in Article 3(1) reaches the dispute-resolution provisions in Article 8 of the BIT. In effect, to be in a position allowing the application of Article 3(1) in any given matter or field an arbitral tribunal has in the first place to have been properly seised with jurisdiction thereon by the parties to the dispute. Thus, to reach Article 3(1) of the BIT the present Tribunal must have jurisdiction under its Article 8. This means in the instant case that for Claimants reaching Article VII of the comparator United States-Argentina BIT, the present Tribunal must have been in a position enabling it to establish jurisdiction pursuant to Article 8 of the basic Argentina-Italy BIT.389\n\nAs stated by the *Daimler* Tribunal: \"since the Claimant has not yet satisfied the necessary condition precedent to Argentina consent to international arbitration, its MFN arguments are not yet properly before the Tribunal. The Tribunal is therefore without jurisdiction to rule on any MFN-based claims unless the MNF clauses themselves supply the tribunal with the necessary jurisdiction\" (*supra* note 1, para. 200).\n\n468.\n\nMoreover, if it would be possible for establishing jurisdiction under Article 3(1) of the BIT without passing through Article 8, Claimants should still have to prove that the text of the MFN clause, as worded in Article 3(1), reflects a certain, clear and unambiguous Contracting States' consent to international arbitral jurisdiction, as they did in Article 8 in a manifest and unequivocal manner. In other words, it must be proven that Article 3(1) is actually an alternative base or title of international arbitral jurisdiction within the BIT. To affirm jurisdiction under Article 3(1) without such a proof (which is missing in the instant case) would amount to bypassing the international law rule of State's consent to jurisdiction *and to regard as sufficient* *consent to the jurisdiction of an international tribunal that would be merely presumed*.390\n\nSee, *Case Concerning the Aerial Incident of 27 July 1955 (Israel v. Bulgaria)*, I.C.J. Reports 1959, p.142, for the same proposition.\n\n469.\n\nOne of the first textual questions to elucidate is whether the term *\"treatment\"* as used in Article 3(1) of their BIT *encompasses jurisdictional as well substantive treatment*.391 The very text of Article 3(1) casts doubts upon whether the broadest meaning of the term \"treatment\" is the ordinary meaning intended by the Contracting Parties in the provision. The MFN clause in Article 3(1) is, in effect, silent about extending its application to dispute-resolution provisions, while Article 8 of the same BIT provides a detailed sequential system for dispute-resolution of investment disputes between an investor and the host State. Article 8 is consequently a context which is called to playing a paramount role in the determination of the ordinary meaning of the term \"investment\" within Article 3(1),392 as well as in confirming the absence of an *ejusdem generis* relationship between the subject-matter of Article 3(1) and the subject-matter of Article 8.\n\nThe *Wintershall* tribunal, *supra* note 9, for example, rejected the application of the MNF clause of the Germany-Argentina BIT in the case because the 18 months litigation in domestic courts prerequisite was part and parcel of the integrated jurisdictional \"offer\" for ICSID arbitration of Germany and Argentina in their BIT, not because the term \"treatment\" *per se* could not include arbitration or other means of international dispute settlement when so provided for in the applicable BIT in a certain, clear and unambiguous manner.\n\nSee, for example, *Austrian Air Lines v. Slovak Republic* (UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules), Final Award of 9 October 2009, para.138, and *ICS Inspection and Control Services*, *supra* note 12, para.296.\n\n470.\n\nArticle 3(1) regulates a Contracting State's substantive grant, namely the grant of MFN and national treatments that it \"shall accord to the investments made by investors from the other Contracting Party within the ambit of its own territory\". It follows that the term \"treatment\" is limited by the text *to activities developed in the territory of the host State,* as in the case of others substantive standards provisions and definitions of the BIT. In contrast, the text does not enounce any kind of territorial limitation in the dispute resolution provisions (Articles 8 and 9) or in the final clauses (Articles 10-13) of the BIT. The logical inference of this textual difference is that \"treatment\" in Article 3(1) does not encompass activities taking place outside the territory of the host State as, for the matter, those relating to the present ICSID arbitration proceeding.\n\n471.\n\nAccording to the text of Article 3 (1) the MFN \"treatment\" to be accorded by the host State within the ambit of its territory applies to the \"income and activities related to (the) investments\", as well as to \"all other matters regulated by (the BIT)\". \"Income\" is a term defined in Article 1(3) which is not susceptible of attracting as such dispute-resolution provisions of any comparator BIT. As to the \"activities\", the text qualifies the term by the words \"related to (the) investments\". Thus, the \"activities\" concerned appears focused on the day-to-day normal conduct, management and operation of the investment, namely to activities in the territory of the host States and, therefore, far removed from those relating to *the resolution of investment disputes by international arbitration* in contentious situations between the investor and the host State.393\n\n*Wintershall*, *supra* note 9, para. 171.\n\n472.\n\nIt remains the meaning of the expression *\"all other matters regulated by (the) BIT\"* of Article 3(1). Claimants seem to rely upon that expression, following *Maffezini*, *Siemmens*, *Gas* *Natural*, *Suez* and the like decisions which they characterized as \"constant ICSID case-law\"394 but disregarding *Salini v. Jordan*, *Plama*, *Telenor*, *Wintershall* and the like trend of opinion.395 In ascertaining the ordinary meaning of that expression in Article 3(1) one must recall: (i) that the scope of the expression is limited to matters within the \"territorial ambit\" of the host State as defined in Article 1(4); (ii) that the scope of the expression is limited to matters regulated by the BIT relating to \"investments\" ; and (iii) that the scope of the expression is limited to the matters in the BIT concerning the \"treatment\" to be accorded by the host States to the investments.\n\nClaimants' Counter-Memorial of 26 November 2009, para. 404.\n\nAs recorded in para. 268 of the *Daimler* award of 2 August 2012, *supra* note 1: \"To-date, at least nine investor-State arbitral panels have found that a particular BIT's MFN clause could be used to modified its international dispute resolution provisions while another ten have reached the opposite result\".\n\n473.\n\nWhat are those \"all other matters regulated by the BIT\"? They are the provisions of the BIT \"regulating\" the substantive protection of the investments *other* than the national treatment and MFN treatment of Article 3(1) itself, namely: the encouragement and protection of the investments (Article 2), the compensation for damages and losses of investments (Article 4), the nationalization or expropriation of investments (Article 5), transfer and repatriation of capital, emoluments and compensation relating to an investment (Article 6) and subrogation in credits resulting from a guarantee to ensure investments against non-commercial risks (Article 7). The expression in question, drafted as a residual rule, sends therefore back the interpreter to \"all\" material provisions of the BIT on substantive protection of investments\n\n474.\n\nThis conclusion is confirmed by the text of Article 8(1) and Article 5(1)(c) of the Argentina-Italy BIT which according to Article 31(2) of the VCLT are *context* for the determination of the ordinary meaning of the expression \"matters regulated by this Agreement\" in Article 3(1) of the BIT. Then, the same expression appears for a second time precisely in Article 8(1) where the Argentina-Italy BIT defines the \"*investor-Host State investment disputes*\" covered by dispute-resolution provision. In effect, Article 8 defines those disputes between investor-host State as relating to investments \"*with respect to matters regulated by this Agreement*\", namely to the substantive protection *matters which are the ones regulated by the BIT* in its Articles 2 to7 and which are distinguished from those between the Contracting States on the interpretation and application of the BIT dealt within Article 9.\n\n475.\n\nArticle 5(1)(c) of the Argentina-Italy BIT corroborates that the investor-host State investment disputes concerning substantive protection matters when - in connection with the determination of the amount of compensation in case of nationalization and expropriations-provides for, in mandatory terms, that \"if an agreement is not reached between the investor and the Contracting Party that adopted the measure, the amount of compensation shall de determine pursuant to *the dispute resolution procedure indicated in Article 8 of the Agreement*\" (*emphasis supplied*). No reference either to Article 3(1) of the BIT as a base of jurisdiction alternative to the dispute resolution system of Article 8 of the BIT\n\n476.\n\nIt is therefore clear that the Argentina-Italy BIT distinguishes \"matters regulated by the Agreement\" and \"disputes resolution procedures of the Agreement\", the first expression concerning substantive protection matters exclusively. Moreover, as shown briefly below, there are further a number of elements concurring in the interpretation that the scope of the MFN clause in Article 3(1) of the said BIT does not cover the subject-matter of dispute-resolution of investment disputes.396\n\nMy conclusion on the matter is similar to the one reached by Brigitte Stern on the interpretation of Article 3 (1) of the Argentina-Italy BIT in her opinion in the *Impregilo* case, *supra* note 300, and, *mutatis mutandis*, by Christopher Thomas on his interpretation of the corresponding MFN clause of the Germany-Argentina BIT in his opinion in the *Hochtief* case, *supra* note 306. It is also inspired by the detailed explanations on the issue of MNF clauses and dispute-resolution which I generally share developed in *Wintershall*, *supra* note 9 (2008), *ICS Inspection and Control services*, *supra* note 12 (2012) and *Daimler*, *supra* note 1 (2012) awards.\n\n477.\n\nConcerning the *expression unius est exclusion alterius* argument, invoked also by the Claimants,397 the answer of principle is quite clear. Argentina and Italy did not need to *contract-out* of international arbitral jurisdiction in Article 3(2) because it has not been proved that they did *contracting-in* international arbitral jurisdiction, explicitly or implicitly, in Article 3(1) of the BIT in the first place. The exceptions to MFN clause treatment listed in Article 3(1) (also in Additional Protocol, para. 2(b)) with its references to \"advantages\" and/or \"privileges\" send back to the substantive treatments granted by the host State within its territory. It is not the case of ICSID arbitration proceedings.\n\nClaimants' Counter-Memorial, para.407.\n\n478.\n\nAnother reason why I do not consider that a MFN clause drafted as Article 3(1) of the Argentina-Italy BIT could be interpreted as argued by the Claimants is the fact that it would deprive of its *effect utile* the dispute-resolution provision specifically agreed upon in the BIT by the Contracting Parties, without explicitly clear evidence of a Contracting States' intention to the contrary (principle of effectiveness controlled in Article 31(1) of the VCLT by good faith and the object purpose of the treaty).\n\n479.\n\nLastly, the Claimants have not met the burden of proof that Article VII of the United States-Argentina BIT invoked by them through the MFN clause of Article 3(1) of the Argentina-Italy BIT effectively provides for, necessarily, that the former treaty grants a \"*more favourable treatment*\" than the latter. The United States-Argentina BIT fixes a six-month mandatory consultation and negotiation period and gives *fork-in-the road* effects to the investor's choice of alternative dispute-resolution means. In fact, each of those BITs set forth two different systems of settlement which as such could well fall under the *Maffezini* exceptions.398\n\nSee on the matter *Wintershall*, *supra* note 9, paras.175-176.\n\n480.\n\nFurthermore, in the instant case there is also additional circumstances that (to be explained below) result from the non-compliance by Claimants of the prerequisite of \"amicable consultations\" of the Argentina-Italy BIT and from the fact that they filed their Request for Arbitration without having previously established in law the existence of the dispute. Then, according to Article VII of the United States-Argentina BIT the fixed six months fixed for consultation and negotiation period has to be counted *as from the date that the dispute arose.* But the Tribunal has no information about that date.\n\n481.\n\nIn the light of the considerations above, I reject the Claimants' argument that the MFN clause of Article 3(1) of the Argentina-Italy BIT does extend to the dispute-resolution matters of Article 8 and that, consequently, it would have the effect of ruling out any obligation for them of recourse during 18 months to Argentine domestic courts, as provided for in Article 8(2) and (3) of the BIT.399\n\nFor indications on State practice and international jurisprudence in relation with the issue of excesses in the application of the MFN clauses to dispute-resolution which followed the *Maffezini* decision (2000), see *Plama* decision on jurisdiction, *supra* note 41, (2005) paras. 200-27, and *Daimler* award, *supra* note 1 (2012), paras.261-78.\n\n**(c) The inadmissibility of the Request for Arbitration: untimely filing and internal incongruity**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n482.\n\nIn their eagerness for reaching direct access to international arbitration, the Claimants filed a premature and internal incongruent Request for Arbitration that they try thereafter to make good alleging, as considered above, \"futility\" and the MFN clause of Article 3 of the Argentina-Italy BIT. But that untimely finding of the Request and its internal incongruity pose additional questions concerning, this time, the admissibility of the Request itself.\n\n**(i) The question of the existence of a dispute between the Parties prior to the date of filing of the Request**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n483.\n\nThe first admissibility issue relates to the question of whether on 23 June 2008 - date of the filing at ICSID of the Request for Arbitration and of the Claimants' consent in writing to submit it to the Centre, there existed between the Parties \"a dispute\" which should be legal and arising directly out of an investment, as provided for generally in Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention and with respect to matters regulated by the Argentina-Italy BIT in Article 8(1) of the latter.\n\n484.\n\nThe Respondent did not move for a preliminary objection referring specifically to the question of the *existence of a dispute* between the Parties with respect to the subject-matter of the claim made by Claimants in their Request for Arbitration.400 However, in point (f) of its request for relief the Respondent asked the Tribunal to determine, in the alternative, *inter alia* that \"Claimants lack legal standing to institute the proceedings\".401 Then, one of the first general conditions to have legal standing to institute arbitral or judicial proceedings is *the existence of the alleged dispute at the critical date,* a preliminary question which by its very nature is susceptible of *motu propio* examination by an international tribunal. Although the Majority did not do so in its Decision, I consider that, in the circumstances of the case, I have to answer that question in this Opinion, taking into account the facts as alleged in the documents submitted by the Parties and, in the first place, by the Request for Arbitration filed by the Claimants on 23 June 2008.\n\nRequest for Arbitration, paras. 11-12.\n\nRespondent Post-Hearing-Brief, para. 185.\n\n485.\n\nIn public international law it is established case law that the general meaning of the word \"dispute\" when used in relation to the jurisdiction of an international court or tribunal is \"a disagreement on a point of law or fact, a conflict of legal views or of interests between two persons\".402 In other words, it must be shown that the claim of a party is positively opposed by the other, the existence of the dispute being determined objectively as a matter of substance on an examination of the facts. The existence of a dispute may sometimes be inferred from the failure to respond to a claim in circumstances where a response is called for.403 But, in any case the dispute must exist at the date the application or request instituting the proceeding is filed, the latter day being the critical date for determining the admissibility of the application or request concerned.404\n\n*Mavrommatis Palestine Concessions, supra* note 271, p. 11.\n\nFor the jurisprudence of the ICJ on the matter see: *Case concerning the Application of CERD (Georgia v. Rusian Federation), supra* note 283 *,* para. 30.\n\n*Border and Transborder Armed Actions (Nicaragua v. Honduras), Jurisdiction and Admissibility*, I.C.J. Reports 1988, p. 95, para. 66.\n\n486.\n\nThe Request for Arbitration filed at the ICSID by the Claimants on 23 June 2008 devotes its Chapter II to \"The Facts Underlying the Dispute\" (38 paragraphs). The Chapter begins by stating that \"the present claims are to be viewed against the historic background and specially of the Argentine Government's policy with respect to the country's economic crises of the late 1980s and 1990s which sought to render the investment environment more appealing to foreign investors\";405 and ends with the historic background by stating, with reference to the 2007 positive trend of Argentina's economic growth, that \"despite its recovery, Argentina still steadfastly and without any justification - in a totally arbitrary and discriminatory manner -refuses to reimburse the holders of the non-exchanged securities, including the Claimants, of the entire value of their investment\",406 concluding as follows:\n\n\"Since this behaviour amounts to a clear violation of Argentina's international obligations, the Claimants have decided to seek satisfaction against Argentina by bringing their claims to ICSID, as permitted by the BIT\".407\n\nRequest for Arbitration, para. 13.\n\n*Ibid,* para. 37.\n\n*Ibid,* para. 38.\n\n487.\n\nBut, there is not a single word in Chapter II on exchanges between the Parties establishing, or allowing to be established, that by 23 June 2008, the date of the filing of the Request for Arbitration, there was a dispute between the Parties about the Respondent's compliance with its obligations under the Argentina-Italy BIT and/or under international law. Chapter III of the Request for Arbitration, entitled \"Argentina has violated its obligations under the BIT and under international law\", begins by recalling the object of the dispute as defined in paragraph 11 of the Request. Nothing either on evidence relevant to determine the existence of a dispute between the Parties as to the violations described by the Claimants as constituting the object of the dispute.\n\n488.\n\nStill more significant is the fact that Chapter IV of the Request entitled \"ICSID Jurisdiction over the Present Dispute\" remains silent on the existence in law of a dispute between the Parties as a result of the Respondent's proclaimed violations. In paragraph 71, the Request states that the prerequisites for the jurisdiction of ICSID are the following: (i) the dispute is of a legal nature; (ii) the dispute arises directly out of an investment; (iii) the parties to the dispute are a Contracting State and a national or nationals of another Contracting State; and (iv) the parties have expressed in writing their consent to submit the dispute to ICSID. Immediately after, paragraph 72 affirms that \"all these conditions are satisfied in the case\". However, *the list omits from the first of all of conditions, namely the existence of the dispute prior to the filing of the Request for Arbitration*.\n\n489.\n\nThis is confirmed by the additional fact that under the section relating to the first of the listed conditions, namely \"the dispute is of a legal nature\", nothing is said with respect to the *existence of the dispute invoked.* In effect, paragraph 73 of the Request limits itself to state: \"The terms of the dispute are summarised in Chapter II above (The Facts Underlying the Dispute). The dispute is to be settled under international law, in particular the BIT (Articles 2(2) and 5)\".\n\n490.\n\nThis perusal of the Claimants' Request for Arbitration points out that by the date on which the Request was filed (23 June 2008) there was not in law a dispute between the Parties to the present case about the Respondent's compliance with its obligations under the Argentina-Italy BIT and/or under international law. The Request does not record any element of information on the existence by that date of a disagreement between the Parties on the subject-matter of the Claimants' claim. There is a complete absence of the factual evidence needed to determine whether the Claimants made such claims and the Respondent positively opposed it with the result that by the critical date it may be affirmed there was a dispute between them in the sense of Article 25 of the ICSID Convention and Article 8 of the Argentina-Italy BIT.\n\n491.\n\nIt is not possible either to infer the existence of the dispute from a failure of the Respondent to respond to the Claimants' claim because the peculiarity of the instant case lies precisely in the fact of the total absence of evidence of whether the Claimants made such a claim to the Respondent before filing the Request for Arbitration. I did not find in the dossier of the case documents, statements or exchanges of the Parties issued before 23 June 2008 about the existence of a dispute. Moreover, the circumstance of the lack of any undertaking of amicable consultations between the Parties does not provide for any assistance either to determining the existence of the dispute.408\n\nAs a matter of principle the existence of a dispute is an issue distinct from the undertaking of consultations or negotiations, but the latter are sometimes of help to determining the former.\n\n492.\n\nIn the absence of any evidence to the contrary, I conclude that *the Claimants fail to prove the existence of a dispute between the Parties on the subject-matter of their claim before the critical date.* The Request for Arbitration is therefore inadmissible.\n\n**(ii) The internal incongruity of the Request**\n------------------------------------------------\n\n493.\n\nThe filed Request for Arbitration is a document with contradictions, errors and omissions as referred to in paragraph 112 of this Opinion. Then, this has a bearing on various jurisdictional and admissibility issues, such as the actual Claimants' written consent to *commence* the present ICSID arbitral proceedings against the Argentine Republic on 22 June 2008 and their legal representation at the filing of the Request and during the instant phase of the proceeding, as well as on the validity of the Request in the light of its internal incongruity as to the signing and filing of the document. I consider therefore that the Request is a document *vitiate* in many aspects, some essential.409 I disagree, therefore, with what appears to be the general underlying proposition of the Majority Decision's conclusions thereon,410 namely that the vices and defects of the Request are after all deficiencies of low intensity. I am of a different opinion, sharing in general the developments and conclusions on the matter of the Argentine Republic as summarized in its Post-Hearing-Brief.411\n\nParas. 111-12 of this Opini\u00f3n.\n\nChapter II of the Majority Decision.\n\nArgentine Republic's Post-Hearing-Brief, paras. 40-80.\n\n494.\n\nAs explained by the Majority Decision, there is an inter-play between the requirement of the ICSID Convention on the \"written consent to submit the dispute pursuant to Article 26\" and the requirement on the \"submission of the request in writing pursuant to Article 36\"412. Having already dealt with the essential issue of the Claimants' written consent within the context of the topic of the jurisdiction of the Centre and the competence of the Tribunal, I will review below briefly the matter from the standpoint of the admissibility question of the submission of the request in writing provided for in Article 36 of the Convention.\n\nMajority Decision, para. 206 and ff.\n\n495.\n\nFor that purposes the most significant question is, in my opinion, the issue of the signing and filing of the Request, together with some ancillary issues relating to the so-called NASAM Mandate Package, the NASAM Mandate and the Power of Attorney elements of the NASAM Mandate Package.413 The text of the Request for Arbitration cannot be clearest as to the signing and filing of the Request by the Claimants themselves. The relevant paragraph reads as follows:\n\n\"84. As to the Claimants' acceptance of Argentina's offer of ICSID Arbitration, it is commonly admitted that the investor's acceptance of the host State's offer can be manifested, *inter alia*, by filing a request for arbitration to ICSID. For these purpose, the Claimants hereby accept to submit the dispute to ICSID arbitration **by signing and filing this Request** **for Arbitration**\" (*emphasis supplied*).\n\nThe NASAM Mandate Package as submitted to the Tribunal included the following documents: (i) NASAM Instruction Letter to the holders of security entitlements in Argentine bonds; (ii) the NASAM **Mandate** (the *Incarico*); (iii) a form to be completed with details of the Claimants; (iv) a form to be completed by the Claimants banks; (v) **Special Power of Attorney** (*Procura Speciale)*, in Italian and in English, purporting to establish a counsel representative relationship of each individual Claimant with Avv. Piero G. Parodi, the only designated counsel in the attorneys' powers (see, para 6(a) of the Request).\n\n496.\n\nThus, according to the Request for Arbitration the Claimants (i) accept Argentina's offer of ICSID arbitration through the form of filing the Request at the Centre and (ii) accept for these purposes the submission of the dispute to ICSID arbitration, by signing and filing the Request with the Centre on 23 June 2008. It follows that the signing of the Request for Arbitration by the Claimants is a decisive indicative element, according to the text of the Request itself, of the consent of the Claimants to arbitrate the dispute and to institute the present proceeding in the Centre on the said date. But, the signatures of the Claimants are missed in the signature page of the Request for Arbitration.414\n\nRequest for Arbitration, p. 42 (in English version).\n\n497.\n\nNone of the Claimants signed the Request for arbitration. Consequently, Paragraph 84 of the Request was never executed. There is, therefore, an evident internal incongruity in the Request (a marked logical contradiction, incoherence or discordance within the document) never corrected on a subject-matter (the Claimants' consent to commence ICSID arbitration against Argentina) of paramount importance for the institution of the present proceeding which vitiates, in my opinion, the validity of the Request giving rise to a cause of inadmissibility of the document. The Respondent is right when it affirms that \"no action against Argentina could be brought without Claimants' signature on the Request for Arbitration (given that this is what the parties had agreed upon)\"415 through the form of acceptance of Argentina's offer chosen by the Claimants themselves in paragraph 84 of the Request.\n\nArgentine Republic's Post-Hearing-Brief, para. 69.\n\n498.\n\nThat form of expressing Claimants' consent to institute the present ICSID arbitral proceeding finds confirmation beyond any reasonable doubt in the indications contained in the NASAM Mandate and Instruction Letter, according to which the prospective Claimants were expected to sign the Power of Attorney (and mailed to NASAM or handed over to the so-called *Multi Family Office*) so that it would be effective by the time of the execution of the Request for Arbitration when signing it at the office of Mr. Parodi (only designated counsel in the Power of Attorney). As stated in the NASAM Instruction Letter: \"You will subsequently have to sign the request for arbitration when so requested by attorney Parodi at his office\".416 Thus, the NASAM Scheme provided for: (i) that the prospective Claimants sign the Request for Arbitration and (ii) that the prospective Claimants doing so at the office of Mr. Parodi, in all probability for verifying the actual identity of the numerous Claimants and authenticate their signatures.\n\nExhibit of the Argentine Republic No. 107. Quoted in para. 43 of the Argentina's Post-Hearing-Brief.\n\n499.\n\nNone of those two requirements were satisfied. The only person having actually signed *manu propia* the Request for Arbitration filed at ICSID on 23 June 2008 is Mr. Radicati di Brozolo who, according to the Request, was designated as co-counsel by Mr. Parodi in accordance with the power conferred upon him by the Claimants in the Power of Attorney.417 And it seems also that the filing of the Request at ICSID was effected by Mr. Radicati di Brozolo without any document or letter of Mr. Parodi accrediting him as co-counsel. The only evidence before the Tribunal of the link between Mr. Parodi and Mr. Radicati di Brozolo was provided much later, at the Hearing, through a letter, date 3 June 2008, signed by Mr. Parodi and addressed to Mr. Radicati di Brozolo and Mr. Barra, but submitted to the Tribunal on January 2011, of a more than questionable, in my opinion, probative value. The Majority Decision makes all kinds of contortionist efforts to \"*heal*\" the lack of authorization of Mr. Radicati di Brozolo to sign and file the Request for Arbitration on 23 June 2008.418\n\nRequest for Arbitration, para. 6 (b).\n\nMajority Decision, paras. 259-272.\n\n500.\n\nHowever, the legal relevant point for my inadmissibility finding concerning the Request for Arbitration is not whether before the critical date Mr. Parodi authorized or not Mr. Radicati di Brozolo to sign and file the Request, but the internal incongruity of the Request as filed by him. In other words, the issue is not for me the signing and filing by Mr. Radicati di Brozolo, *but the not signing and filing of the Request by the Claimants which is an incontestable proven fact in the present proceeding.* As to Mr. Radicati di Brozolo's authorization for signing and filing I will point out that according to paragraph 6 of the Request the three persons listed therein (Parodi, Radicati di Brozolo and Parra) represented *jointly* the Claimants while Mr. Parodi's letter of 3 June 2008 to his co-counsels confer upon them all the powers to represent the Claimants and to defend them *jointly and severally.* This contradiction between Mr. Parodi's letter and the Request for Arbitration filed by Mr. Radicati di Brozolo adds a new internal incongruity to the latter.\n\n501.\n\nIt follows from the above, that the Claimants' Request for Arbitration is also inadmissible on a second account, namely by the vice of internal incongruities on the essential question of the manifestation of the Claimants' consent to arbitration.\n\n**V. CONCLUDING FINDINGS**\n--------------------------\n\n502.\n\nIn consequence of the forgoing considerations and conclusions, I find with respect to the arguments and evidence submitted by the Parties on the Respondent's preliminary objections constituting the subject-matter of this phase of the case the following:\n\n1. That this Tribunal has no jurisdiction *ratione materiae* over the sovereign debt instruments (security entitlements in Argentina sovereign bonds) because they do not constitute a covered protected investment under the ICSID Convention and the Argentina-Italy BIT, in the light of their very nature and in absence of a territorial link with Argentina;\n\n2. That this Tribunal has no jurisdiction under the ICSID Convention and the BIT over the kind of multiparty claims action instituted by the Claimants, in the absence of Argentina's consent or acquiescence thereto;\n\n3. That the *ratione personae* jurisdiction objection does not possess in the circumstances of the case an exclusively preliminary character and, consequently, is not susceptible of adjudication in the present preliminary phase on jurisdiction and admissibility;\n\n4. That the *prima facie* treaty claims test objection does not possess either in the circumstances of the case an exclusively preliminary character and, therefore, is not susceptible either of adjudication in the present phase;\n\n5. That the Tribunal has no jurisdiction because of the lack of Respondent's consent to international arbitration in absence of compliance by the Claimants with the prerequisites of prior amicable consultations and 18-month litigation in Argentine courts prescribed by Article 8 of the BIT;\n\n6. That this Tribunal has no jurisdiction because the Claimants' consent to the arbitration as manifested in their Request for Arbitration does not match the Respondent's consent to international arbitration offered in Article 8 of the BIT and, consequently, the undertaking between the Parties to the dispute to have recourse to ICSID arbitration (*convenci\u00f3n de arbitraje*) has not been duly executed by the filing of the said Request;\n\n7. That the MFN clause in Article 3(1) of the Argentina-Italy BIT does not extend to international dispute resolution matters; and\n\n8. That the Claimants' Request for Arbitration is inadmissible on two accounts, namely for having being filed before a legal dispute between the Claimants and the Respondent was duly established in international law and because the instrument is vitiated by internal incongruity.\n\nFor these reasons, I cannot concur in the Majority Decision and enter this dissenting Opinion."}], "Content": "Decision on Jurisdiction and Admissibility\n------------------------------------------\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **ABBREVIATIONS OF THE SUBMISSIONS OF THE PARTIES** | |\n| Claimants\u2019 Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction and Admissibility | CI |\n| Claimants\u2019 Rejoinder on Jurisdiction | CII |\n| Claimants\u2019 Post-Hearing Brief | C III |\n| Claimants\u2019 Comments on the Decision on Jurisdiction and Admissibility and the Dissenting Opinion of Professor Abi-Saab in the *Abaclat* case | C IV |\n| Request for Arbitration | Request |\n| Respondent\u2019s Memorial on Jurisdiction and Admissibility | R I |\n| Respondent\u2019s Reply Memorial on Jurisdiction and Admissibility | R II |\n| Respondent\u2019s Post Hearing Brief | R III |\n| Respondent\u2019s Comments on the Decision on Jurisdiction and Admissibility and the Dissenting Opinion of Professor Abi-Saab in the *Abaclat* case | R IV |\n| Respondent\u2019s Comments to Claimants\u2019 Comments on the Decision on Jurisdiction and Admissibility and the Dissenting Opinion of Professor Abi-Saab in the *Abaclat* case | R V |\n| Transcript of the Hearing on Jurisdiction | Tr |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **FURTHER ABBREVIATIONS USED IN THE DECISION** | |\n| Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States | ICSID Convention |\n| Rules of Procedure for the Institution of Conciliation and Arbitration Proceedings | Institution Rules |\n| Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings | Arbitration Rules |\n| Agreement between the Argentine Republic and the Republic of Italy for the Encouragement and Protection of Investments of 22 May 19902 | Argentina-Italy BIT *or* BIT |\n| Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties of 23 May 1969 | VCLT |\n| North Atlantic Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 d\u2019Administration | NASAM |\n| Incarico (Retainer Agreement) on behalf of NASAM3 | NASAM Mandate |\n| Procura sp\u00e9ciale (Special Power of Attorney) on behalf of Avv.

The Parties further agreed on a calendar for their written pleadings in the preliminary phase and on a Hearing on Jurisdiction which was held from 25 to 27 January 2011 in Paris.\n\n4.\n\nIn the various rounds of exchange of written submissions and in the Hearing on Jurisdiction, both Parties have been given wide and equal opportunity to present their case in regard to the questions of jurisdiction and admissibility before the Tribunal. Having considered the evidence and arguments submitted by the Parties and based on the deliberations held among the Members of the Tribunal, the Tribunal considers itself in a position to render the present Decision on Jurisdiction and Admissibility which concludes the first phase of the proceedings in the present dispute.\n\n*Limitation of the first phase of the proceedings to questions of a general character*\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n5.\n\nIn the afore-mentioned First Session of the Tribunal, the Parties further agreed, as follows (see Minutes of the First Session, point 14):\n\nThe preliminary phase would deal with preliminary objections of a general character only, but not with any jurisdictional issues that may arise in relation to individual claimants, which would be dealt with at a later stage as necessary and appropriate. In the event of disagreement as to whether a given objection is of a \"general character only\" the matter will be decided by the Tribunal.\n\n6.\n\nBy virtue of the mandate with which the present Tribunal has been entrusted by the Parties, the Tribunal does not aim at determining whether or not it has jurisdiction in respect to each single Claimant. Instead, the Tribunal will set forth the general prerequisites for its jurisdiction and the admissibility of the Claimants\u2019 claims in the present case. Accordingly, relevant jurisdictional issues touching specifically upon individual Claimants are not to be dealt with in the present Decision, but are joined to the examination of the merits of the case.\n\n*Relationship of the present Decision to the Abaclat case*\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n7.\n\nBefore explaining the structure of the present Decision on Jurisdiction and Admissibility, the Tribunal would like to point out that currently two other ICSID proceedings are under way concerning issues closely related to the present dispute. In fact, in these two cases, in analogy to the present one, Italian nationals seek compensation from the Argentine Republic for purported violations of the latter\u2019s obligations under the Argentina-Italy BIT in connection with Argentina\u2019s default on paying its sovereign debt in 2001.\n\n8.\n\nThe older of these two cases is *Abaclat and others (Case formerly known as Giovanna a Beccara and others) v. Argentine Republic,* ICSID Case No. ARB/07/5 which was registered by ICSID on 7 February 2007 (hereinafter *\"Abaclat* case\"). As in the present case, Argentina challenged the jurisdiction of the Tribunal and the admissibility of the Claimants\u2019 claims. In its *Decision on Jurisdiction and Admissibility* of 4 August 2011 (hereinafter *'Abaclat* Decision\"), the Tribunal, by majority decision, held that it had jurisdiction to hear the case in question and that the Claimants\u2019 claims were admissible. The dissenting arbitrator, Professor Georges Abi-Saab, issued his Dissenting Opinion to the Tribunal\u2019s Decision on 28 October 2011 (hereinafter \"Dissenting Opinion of Professor Abi-Saab in the *Abaclat* case\").\n\n9.\n\nThe other case is *Giovanni Alemanni and others v. Argentine Republic,* ICSID Case No. ARB/07/8 which was registered on 27 March 2007. While Argentina has raised preliminary objections concerning jurisdiction and admissibility also in this dispute, the pertinent tribunal has not yet reached a decision in this regard.\n\n10.\n\nIn light of the substantial parallels between the present case and the *Abaclat* case, in particular of the fact that the Respondent used to a large extent the same or similar arguments to those it put forward in the present case, and given that both Tribunals have come to the same conclusion, i.e. to affirm that the Tribunal has jurisdiction and that the claims brought forward by the Claimants are admissible, it would be artificial for this Tribunal to ignore the Decision taken by its sister Tribunal.\n\n11.\n\nQuite evidently, it is highly common for arbitral tribunals in general and ICSID tribunals in particular to take inspiration from the decisions of other tribunals having faced similar questions or situations. However, there can be no doubt that there is a special, particularly close relationship between the present and the *Abaclat* cases - most obviously, as has already been pointed out, due to the substantial overlap of the questions of fact and law the two Tribunals are confronted with in their respective cases.\n\n12.\n\nThe present Tribunal will therefore not hesitate to benefit, where applicable and appropriate, from the reasoning of the *Abaclat* Tribunal. Far from adhering to any doctrine of *stare decisis* or considering itself legally bound by the findings of the *Abaclat* Tribunal, this implies a process of critically engaging with the majority decision, but also with the counter-arguments contained in the Dissenting Opinion of Professor Abi-Saab. It will become manifest throughout the subsequent reasoning that the present Tribunal agrees with many, though not all, considerations and views expressed in the *Abaclat* Decision, and the Tribunal will refer to these parallels in the pertinent context.\n\n13.\n\nThe Tribunal wishes to emphasize, however, that it is well aware that it is called upon to decide the case submitted to it by the Parties on its own needs and merits. The reasoning of the *Abaclat* Decision can thus be of relevance to that of the present Tribunal only if and to the extent that the Parties in the present case have submitted arguments similar to, and compatible with, those marshaled in the *Abaclat* case.\n\n*Structure of the present Decision*\n-----------------------------------\n\n14.\n\nAs regards the structure of the present Decision, the reasoning will proceed as follows: The Tribunal will first provide an overview over the procedural history of the case (paras. 16 *et seq.),* the facts relevant to this phase of proceedings (paras. 56 *et seq.)* as well as the relief sought by the Parties (paras. 63 *et seq.).*\n\n15.\n\nSubsequently, the Tribunal will address the preliminary objections as to jurisdiction and admissibility as raised by the Respondent (see *R I \u00a7\u00a7 87 et seq.* and the following submissions). However, the Tribunal will not precisely follow the order of issues as set out by the Respondent, but will proceed in the following manner: First, the Tribunal will deal with the issue of the consent of the Respondent (Chapter I.; paras. 68 *et seq.),* then with the consent of the Claimants (Chapter IT; paras. 173 *et seq.)* and subsequently with the problem of the nationality and standing of the Claimants (Chapter III; paras. 279 *et seq.).* After that, it will address the question of whether there exists a legal dispute arising out of an investment in the present case (Chapter IV.; paras. 355 *et seq.)* and then turn to the further issues of the existence of a *prima facie* treaty claim (Chapter V.; paras. 521 *et seq.)* and whether Claimants have complied with Art. 8 of the Argentina-Italy BIT and the prerequisites of amicable consultations and recourse to Argentine courts contained therein (Chapter VI; paras. 552 *et seq.).* In each one of the Chapters, the Tribunal will first briefly set out the arguments submitted by the Respondent and the Claimants and then present its own findings on the issues at stake.\n\n**PROCEDURAL HISTORY**\n----------------------\n\n16.\n\nOn 26 June 2008, the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (hereinafter \"ICSID\" or the \"Centre\") received a Request for Arbitration dated 23 January 2008 (hereinafter \"Request\") from Claimants against Respondent. On 1 July 2008, the Centre acknowledged receipt of the Request. On 3 July 2008, the Centre transmitted a copy of the Request and its accompanying documentation to Respondent and its Embassy in Washington, D.C.\n\n17.\n\nOn 28 July 2008, pursuant to Art. 36(3) of the ICSID Convention and in accordance with Rules 6(1)(a) and 7(a) of the Institution Rules, ICSID\u2019s Acting Secretary-General registered the Request, and on the same date, notified the Parties of the registration, inviting them to constitute an arbitral tribunal as soon as possible.\n\n18.\n\nBy letter of 22 September 2008, Claimants informed ICSID that the Parties had reached an agreement on the method for the appointment of the Tribunal. It stated that each Party was to appoint an arbitrator, with Claimants appointing Professor Karl-Heinz B\u00f6ckstiegel, a national of Germany. The two party-appointed arbitrators would submit to the Parties a list of five candidates for the position of President of the Tribunal. The Parties would then attempt to reach an agreement on the designation of the President of the Tribunal from the list of candidates. If the party-appointed arbitrators were unable to agree on a list of candidates for the designation of the President, either Party could request that the President be appointed by the Chairman of ICSID\u2019s Administrative Council in accordance with the method set forth in Rule 4 of the Arbitration Rules. Professor B\u00f6ckstiegel accepted his appointment on 25 October 2008.\n\n19.\n\nOn 22 September 2008, Respondent appointed Dr. Santiago Torres Bern\u00e1rdez, a national of Spain, as arbitrator. Dr. Torres Bern\u00e1rdez accepted his appointment on 29 October 2008.\n\n20.\n\nBy letter of 23 September 2008, but received 24 January 2008, Respondent confirmed to ICSID its agreement with Claimants as to the method for appointing the President of the Tribunal.\n\n21.\n\nOn 5 November 2008, ICSID sent to both Parties the co-arbitrators\u2019 proposed list of candidates for the position of President of the Tribunal.\n\n22.\n\nBy letters of 17 and 18 November 2008, the Parties informed the Centre that they had agreed to the appointment of Judge Bruno Simma, a national of Austria and Germany, as the President of the Tribunal.\n\n23.\n\nOn 5 December 2008, the Centre informed the Parties that the Arbitral Tribunal was deemed constituted by (i) Professor Karl-Heinz B\u00f6ckstiegel (appointed by Claimants), (ii) Dr. Santiago Torres Bern\u00e1rdez (appointed by Respondent), and (iii) Judge Bruno Simma (appointed by agreement of the parties), President of the Tribunal. Further, the Tribunal was informed that Mr. Gonzalo Flores, Senior Counsel, would serve as the Secretary to the Tribunal. Mr. Flores was replaced as Secretary of the Tribunal by Mrs. Anneliese Fleckenstein, Legal Counsel, on 4 October 2011.\n\n24.\n\nOn 24 February 2009, the First Session was held via telephone conference. During the session a procedural calendar for the further conduct of the proceedings was agreed by the Parties. The agreements reached were recorded in the Minutes of the First Session.\n\n25.\n\nOn 16 March 2009, Respondent filed its request for the production of documents, as per the schedule agreed upon by the Parties. On 30 March 2009, Claimants filed their objections to Respondent\u2019s request for the production of documents. On 13 April 2009, Respondent filed a *Redfern Schedule.* On 17 April 2009, Claimants responded to Respondent\u2019s letter of 13 April 2009 and the attached *Redfern Schedule.* On 15 May 2009, Respondent filed observations to Claimants\u2019 letter of 17 April 2009. On 18 May 2009, Claimants responded to Respondent\u2019s letter of 15 May 2009.\n\n26.\n\nOn 11 June 2009, Respondent filed its Memorial on Jurisdiction and Admissibility (\"R I\").\n\n27.\n\nOn 29 June 2009, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 1 ruling on Respondent\u2019s request for the production of documents.\n\n28.\n\nOn 16 July 2009, Claimants\u2019 filed their request for the production of documents. On 23 July 2009, Respondent requested that the Tribunal dismiss Claimants\u2019 request objecting to its tardiness and raising other objections to the request. On 3 August 2009, Claimants responded to Respondent\u2019s objections of 23 July 2009, and filed *d\\S\\r Redfern Schedule.* On the same date, Respondent submitted its observations to Claimants\u2019 letter.\n\n29.\n\nOn 18 September 2009, the Tribunal issued a decision concerning Claimants\u2019 request for the production of documents and Respondent\u2019s objections.\n\n30.\n\nBy letter of 15 October 2009, Claimants informed the Tribunal that together with Respondent, they had agreed to amend the schedule.\n\n31.\n\nOn 26 November 2009, Claimants submitted their Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction and Admissibility (\"C I\").\n\n32.\n\nOn 15 December 2009, Respondent filed its second request for the production of documents. On 22 December 2009, Claimants filed their objections to Respondent\u2019s second request for the production of documents. On 11 January 2010, Respondent filed a *Redfern Schedule* on its second request for the production of documents.\n\n33.\n\nBy letter of 17 February 2010, the Tribunal reiterated its decisions in Procedural Order No. 1.\n\n34.\n\nOn 12 March 2010, Respondent submitted its Reply Memorial on Jurisdiction and Admissibility (\"R II\").\n\n35.\n\nOn 22 March 2010, Claimants filed their second request for the production of documents. On 29 March 2010, Respondent filed its objections to Claimants\u2019 second request for the production of documents.\n\n36.\n\nBy letter of 28 April 2010, Claimants requested from the Tribunal a suspension of the present proceedings in light of the publicly announced New Exchange Offer by the Argentine Government.\n\n37.\n\nBy letter of 30 April 2010, Respondent informed the Tribunal that it had no objection to Claimants\u2019 request for suspension.\n\n38.\n\nBy letter of 4 May 2010, Respondent further informed the Tribunal that the Parties, having conferred on the issue of suspension, had agreed to suspend the proceedings as of that date without the need for Claimants to file their Rejoinder on the scheduled date.\n\n39.\n\nBy letter of 5 May 2010, Claimants confirmed the agreement as conveyed by Respondent on 4 May 2010.\n\n40.\n\nBy letter of 31 May 2010, Respondent objected to North Atlantic Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 d\u2019Administration\u2019s (\"NASAM\") communication to Claimants with respect to the New Exchange Offer.\n\n41.\n\nBy letter of 10 June 2010, Claimants responded to Respondent\u2019s letter concerning NASAM and requested an extension of the suspension of the proceeding as well as the submission of its Rejoinder.\n\n42.\n\nBy letter of 16 June 2010, the Tribunal issued a decision on the Parties\u2019 respective letters concerning NASAM, dated 31 May 2010 and 10 June 2010 and granted the extension to the suspension of the proceeding.\n\n43.\n\nThe parties further exchanged letters on the issue concerning NASAM as well as Claimants\u2019 request for an extension on its Rejoinder. On 16 July 2010, the Tribunal informed the Parties that the suspension was terminated, and indicated a date for the submission of Claimants\u2019 Rejoinder.\n\n44.\n\nOn 8 October 2010, Claimants submitted their Rejoinder on Jurisdiction (\"C H\").\n\n45.\n\nBy letter of 26 November 2010, the Tribunal invited the Parties to indicate whether they would be agreeable to the appointment of an Assistant to the President of the Tribunal. By letters of 26 and 30 November 2010, Respondent and Claimants, respectively, agreed.\n\n46.\n\nOn 30 December 2010, the Parties agreed to the appointment of Dr. Michael Waibel as Assistant to the President of the Tribunal.\n\n47.\n\nFrom 25 to 27 January 2011, the Tribunal held a hearing on jurisdiction in Paris. Present at the hearing were, for the Tribunal: Judge Bruno Simma, President; Professor Karl-Heinz B\u00f6ckstiegel, Arbitrator; Dr. Santiago Torres Bern\u00e1rdez, Arbitrator; Dr. Michael Waibel, Assistant to the President of the Tribunal; and Mr. Gonzalo Flores, Secretary of the Tribunal. Claimants were represented by Professor Luca G. Radicati di Brozolo, Ms. Victoria Vi\u00f1es, Mr. Michele Sabatini, Mr. Clemente Parodi and Mr. Giovanni Minuto. Respondent was represented by Dra. Angelina Abbona, *Procuradora del Tesoro de la Nacion',* Dr. Gabriel Bottini, *Director Nacional de Asuntos y Controversias Internacionales de la Procuraci\u00f3n del Tesoro de la Naci\u00f3n',* Ms. Silvina Gonz\u00e1lez Napolitano, Mr. Alejandro Turyn, Ms. Mariana Lozza, Ms. Ver\u00f3nica Lavista, Mr. Diego Gosis, Dr. Domenico Di Pietro, Mr. Juli\u00e1n Negro and Mr. Patricio Amedo Barreiro from the *Procuraci\u00f3n del Tesoro de la Naci\u00f3n.*\n\n48.\n\nOn 28 March 2011, Respondent filed its Post Hearing Brief (\"R III\"), and Claimants filed theirs the following day on 29 March 2011 (\"C III\").\n\n49.\n\nBy letter of 11 July 2011, the President of the Tribunal informed the Parties that Dr. Waibel had resigned as Assistant and invited the parties to comment on his replacement by Dr. Andreas Th. M\u00fcller.\n\n50.\n\nBy letter of 21 July 2011, Dr. M\u00fcller\u2019s appointment was confirmed.\n\n51.\n\nBy letter of 4 November 2011, as requested by the Parties, the Tribunal invited the Parties to submit simultaneous comments to the Decision on Jurisdiction and Admissibility and Dissenting Opinion of Professor Abi-Saab in the *Abaclat* case.\n\n52.\n\nOn 25 November 2011, the Parties submitted their comments to the Decision on Jurisdiction and Admissibility and the Dissenting Opinion of Professor Abi-Saab in the *Abaclat* case (\"C IV\"; \"R IV\"). On 13 December 2011, the Parties submitted further comments to each other\u2019s submissions of 25 November 2011 (\"C V\"; \"R V\").\n\n53.\n\nUpon request by the Tribunal, on 9 July 2012, Claimants submitted their Statement of Costs incurred from the filing of the Request until the date of the submission of the statement. Respondent submitted its Statement of Costs the following day on 10 July 2012.\n\n54.\n\nUpon request by the Tribunal, the Respondent stated, by letter of 17 September 2012, that it does not object to the discontinuance of proceedings in connection with those Claimants that, including those listed in Annex CA 73, tendered into the 2010 Exchange Offer. Subsequently, the Tribunal requested the Claimants to provide it with reliable information as to which Claimants among the 55 persons listed in Annex CA 73 meet the afore-mentioned requirements.\n\n55.\n\nIn their response dated 18 October 2012, the Claimants submitted an updated list of Claimants who have accepted the 2010 Exchange Offer. In particular, according to the Claimants, out of the 55 persons listed in Annex CA 73, 29 accepted the Exchanger Offer.\n\n**FACTS OF THE CASE**\n---------------------\n\n56.\n\nIn their written and oral submissions, the Parties have provided the Tribunal with a considerable amount of factual information *(RfA \u00a7\u00a7 13-37; CI \u00a7\u00a7 21-79; CII \u00a7\u00a7 5-7; C III \u00a7\u00a7 35-41; RI\u00a7\u00a7 7-86; RII \u00a7 22-81; Tr pp. 9/13-12/17, 157/19-162/12).*\n\n57.\n\nThe Tribunal sees no need to express itself on these submissions in any detail at this stage of the proceedings and for the purpose of deciding, as the Tribunal is called upon, on Respondent\u2019s preliminary objections regarding jurisdiction and admissibility in the present dispute.\n\n58.\n\nFor one, a considerable part of the information provided by the Parties will only become relevant at the merits stage of the proceedings and will be addressed by the Tribunal at that time.\n\n59.\n\nSecondly, inasmuch as certain factual claims made by the Parties are directly relevant for this Decision on Jurisdiction and Admissibility, the Tribunal will address these in the respective Chapters of the present Decision and assess the probative value of the Parties\u2019 submissions in the relevant context.\n\n60.\n\nThirdly, the Tribunal acknowledges that the *Abaclat* Decision, in its paras. 11-64, 70-71 and 75-80, contains a summary of the general factual background of the *Abaclat* case (see para. 10 of the *Abaclat* Decision), notably containing an explanation of general concepts related to financial markets and bonds, as far as relevant for the case, a general overview on sovereign debt restructuring and of Argentina\u2019s financial crisis and default in 2001 as well as Argentina\u2019s activities in terms of restructuring its economy and its sovereign debt (particularly including the Exchange Offer of 2005 and the adoption of Law No. 26,017 on 9 February 20059).\n\nLey 26,017 of 9 February 2005, Bolet\u00edn Oficial de la Rep\u00fablica Argentina, N\u00fam. 30,590, 11 February 2005 (hereinafter \"Law No. 26,017\").\n\n61.\n\nIn the eyes of the Tribunal, this succinct description of the factual background in the *Abaclat* Decision can also be usefully applied regarding the present case. The Tribunal has already stated10 that it will refer to the *Abaclat* case, whenever appropriate, and it considers this a valuable opportunity to do so for reasons of expediency, namely in order not to reduplicate an effort that has already been made by its sister Tribunal.\n\nSee *supra* para. 12.\n\n62.\n\nThe Tribunal would wish to point out at the same time that, while referring to the aforementioned paragraphs of the *Abaclat* Decision, it does not take a final stand on any of the facts stated therein. Inasmuch as it is necessary to set out specific facts to decide the legal questions pertinent to this first stage of the proceedings, i.e. the jurisdictional and admissibility phase, this will be done, as has already been stated11, in the respective Chapters of the present Decision.\n\nSee *supra* para. 59.\n\n**PRAYERS OF RELIEF**\n---------------------\n\n63.\n\nIn paras. 90 and 91 of the Request, the Claimants state that they\n\n90. [...] seek an Arbitral Award:\n\n- declaring that the Respondent has breached its international obligations under the BIT and international law by failing to ensure fair and equitable treatment and full protection and security to their investments and by expropriating such investments without prompt, adequate and immediate compensation;\n\n- ordering the Respondent to refund to each Claimant the entire nominal value of the Bonds held by it, plus accrued interest until maturity, plus compounded interest from the date of expiry to the date of the Request for Arbitration, plus all other damages that shall be demonstrated to be a direct consequence of the Respondent\u2019s international law violations;\n\n- ordering the Respondent to pay compounded interest on the total amount indicated above from the date of the present Request for Arbitration until the date of actual payment.

CONSENT OF THE RESPONDENT**\n--------------------------------\n\n**A. Positions of the Parties**\n-------------------------------\n\n**1. Contentions by Respondent**\n--------------------------------\n\n68.\n\nRespondent submits that the present dispute involves an attempt by a great number of unrelated Claimants to jointly arbitrate their claims against a State. This way to proceed is unprecedented since the States Parties to the ICSID Convention did not consent to jurisdiction over collective actions. Both the ICSID Convention and the Argentina-Italy BIT are limited to single investor disputes and do not even allude to the possibility of collective actions, let alone do they establish the necessary and appropriate procedures for such proceedings *(RI \u00a7 87).*\n\n69.\n\nIn Respondent\u2019s submission, in order for Claimants to meet their burden for establishing jurisdiction, they must demonstrate both that the ICSID Convention permits arbitration of collective or mass claims and that Argentina consented to such arbitration in Art. 8 of the Argentina-Italy BIT *(RI \u00a7 90).* Since the Claimants concede themselves that \"the ICSID Convention and Rules and the BIT do not expressly envisage actions brought by a plurality of claimants\" *(CI \u00a7 169),* Respondent contends that the Tribunal should dismiss the present case for lack of jurisdiction *(R II \u00a7 82).*\n\n***a) The ICSID Convention does not authorize collective actions nor did Argentina consent to such proceedings in the Argentina-Italy BIT***\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n70.\n\nRespondent contends that nothing in the ICSID Convention and Rules provides Claimants with any right to bring collective and mass claims before an ICSID tribunal *(R I \u00a7 90).* In particular, the text of the ICSID Convention, notably its Art. 25(1), consistently uses singular nouns when defining ICSID jurisdiction over investor claims *(R II \u00a7 105; R III \u00a7 10).* Moreover, Art. 8 paras. 1 and 5 of the Argentina-Italy BIT both use the expression \"an investor\" or \"of the investor\" in the singular form, thus limiting Respondent\u2019s consent to arbitrate to claims filed by a single investor *(R.II\u00a7\u00a7 111, 112; R III \u00a7 11).* Regarding Claimants\u2019 counter-argument that Art. 8 para. 3 of the BIT speaks of \"investors\", Respondent submits that the two afore-mentioned paragraphs are more relevant than para. 3, because para. 1 is the chapeau on which the whole provision is based and because para. 5 includes the Respondent\u2019s consent to arbitration *(Tr p. 361/3).*\n\n71.\n\nThe absence of any express provisions for collective proceedings cannot be construed to implicitly allow for such actions *(RI \u00a7 91; Tr p. 51/11),* rather, the opposite is true *(R II \u00a7\u00a7 101, 106).* The interpretation proposed by Claimants turns on its head one of the defining aspects of international law, i.e. international jurisdiction being voluntary, unlike domestic jurisdiction which is mandatory, and thus the former must be expressly consented *(R II \u00a7 102).* Hence, Respondent sharply disagrees with the finding in the *Abaclat* Decision that for admitting multi-party proceedings in ICSID a supplementary expression of consent in addition to the general consent given to ICSID arbitration is not necessary *(R IV pp. 6-8).*\n\n72.\n\nFurthermore, international and domestic instruments allowing for collective or mass claim proceedings contain detailed legal provisions regarding whether a case is suitable for collective treatment and establish specific procedures to handle such cases *(RI \u00a7\u00a7 88, 91).* In contrast, the absolute absence of procedural rules for collective proceedings within the framework of the ICSID Convention provides further evidence that such proceedings do not fall within the Convention\u2019s jurisdictional scope *(RII \u00a7\u00a7 110, 114; R III \u00a79).*\n\n73.\n\nIn particular, in domestic jurisdictions where collective or mass claims are permitted (such as in the US legal system\u2019s class action mechanism and the related arbitral rules of the American Arbitration Association, but also in the UK as well as in Italy), these are typically authorized by specific legal provisions representing a policy choice by the jurisdiction to provide for such a means of conflict resolution in appropriate circumstances. These provisions set out detailed procedures established by a legislative-type body to ensure fairness of representation and due process of law to all participants before any case is permitted to proceed on a collective basis. Nowhere can a group of claimants unilaterally determine that their own particular claims are necessarily proper or suitable for aggregate treatment *(RI\u00a7\u00a7 92-97; RII\u00a7\u00a7 114, 124-126).*\n\n74.\n\nIn a similar vein, Respondent submits that the mass claim facilities that have occasionally been created by international instruments (e.g. the Iran-US Claims Tribunal and the UN Compensation Commission) likewise provide specially designed procedures for addressing these kinds of claims recognizing their unique nature. In each of the examples of such mass claim facilities, their establishment has involved careful and detailed drafting of rules and procedures by which to ensure the proper handling of collective or multiple claims *(RI \u00a7\u00a7 98-100; RII \u00a7 116).*\n\n75.\n\nThe ICSID Convention and the Argentina-Italy BIT contain no such procedures, and this silence is itself powerful evidence of the absence of any intent by the parties to these instruments to permit such claims; in fact, mass or class proceedings were highly controversial, or entirely prohibited, at the time when those instruments were adopted *(R I \u00a7\u00a7 91, 101-102; RII \u00a7 101, 108, 124; RIII \u00a7 18; Tr p. 57/14).* Respondent criticizes the *Abaclat* Tribunal for interpreting its jurisdictional basis beyond \"the horizon of foreseeability\", i.e. extending jurisdiction to what the parties could not have foreseen at the time consent was given *(R IV pp. 6, 8).* From this Respondent concludes that accepting jurisdiction over this collective action would manifestly disregard the jurisdictional limits imposed by the ICSID Convention and Argentina\u2019s consent to arbitrate in Art. 8 of the Argentina-Italy BIT and that it is therefore not within the powers of an ICSID tribunal to do *so (RI \u00a7 103; RII \u00a7 100).*\n\n76.\n\nRespondent does not disagree, however, that a limited multi-party proceeding between closely related investors may be possible if the parties offer their consent to it in the case of each individual proceeding *(R II \u00a7 140).* Yet, in no case has an arbitral tribunal on an *ad hoc* basis, without any previous authorization in the pertinent constitutive documents or institutional arbitration rules, created or permitted a mass claim procedure *(R II \u00a7\u00a7 118, 129; R III \u00a7 24).* The multi-party proceedings cited by the Claimants at most support the proposition that in some instances, provided respondent\u2019s consent had been given, ICSID tribunals have entertained unique proceedings involving a small number of claimants (generally two or three) who were intimately linked in some concrete way *(R II \u00a7103).*\n\n77.\n\nThe claim at stake is fundamentally different from the afore-mentioned cases, since here the Claimants have divergent interests and their claims are thus not suited for collective treatment. In the Respondent\u2019s eyes, this dispute brings together contractually unrelated persons *(R I \u00a7 104).* It involves security entitlements regarding 55 different bond series [state as of March 2010] with different applicable laws, issuance dates, types of currency and amounts, and which were acquired in different places, at very different prices and on different dates, even including some Claimants having purchased after Argentina\u2019s default. Similarly, at least some Claimants have initiated lawsuits against the banks that sold them the security entitlements and taken the position that the sale contracts of their security entitlements should be terminated *(RI\u00a7 94; RII\u00a7\u00a7 104, 135).* The fact that the link between the Claimants is the invocation of the same BIT or a common claim for damages is not enough in order to consolidate the claims of several Claimants. Otherwise, all claims invoking the same BIT brought before ICSID against a country could be consolidated. Arguing that all the persons involved have purportedly been affected by the same measure is not sufficient either *(R III \u00a7\u00a7 19, 21; Tr p. 369/15).*\n\n78.\n\nMoreover, Respondent contends that in existing multi-party ICSID cases there was not only a strong connection among claimants, but the respondent State in the dispute did not oppose such joinder. In the cases brought against Argentina before ICSID tribunals, Respondent decided to consent to multi-party proceedings only where there was a strong preexisting connection between claimants *(RI\u00a7 105).* Respondent emphasizes that there is not a single case in the ICSID Convention\u2019s history which was initiated by multiple unrelated parties without the respondent State\u2019s consent. The lack of any such jurisprudence reflects the absence of any provision in ICSID law that would remotely permit such a claim *(RI\u00a7 107).*\n\n79.\n\nFollowing Respondent\u2019s submission, no ICSID case involved more than 14 Claimants, thus not raising any of the manageability and due process issues existing in the present proceedings *(RI \u00a7 104; RII \u00a7 129).* Concerning Claimants\u2019 contention that the discussion regarding collective claims in the Dissenting Opinion of Professor Abi-Saab in the *Abaclat* case is largely moot because in that case there are 60,000 claimants whereas in the present one there are only 64 (C *IV \u00a7 50),* Respondent insists that the conclusions reached in the Dissenting Opinion apply both to a collective action involving 60,000 as well as one involving 120 or 64 Claimants *(R Vp.* 5).\n\n80.\n\nAs regards, finally, Claimants\u2019 arguments that jurisdiction should exist because this is the most efficient, favourable, cost-effective way to proceed and would eliminate inconsistent decisions, from the point of view of the Respondent, these must fail as a matter of law. ICSID is a strictly consent-based institution and lack of consent is an absolute bar to jurisdiction that cannot be overcome by policy considerations *(R II \u00a7 142; Tr p. 55/1).* What Claimants do not say is that, if there are financial and administrative obstacles with ICSID arbitration, domestic law mechanisms are at their disposal, as provided for by each kind of bond series *(Tr p. 53/22).*\n\n***b) Claimants\u2019 submission as to the nature of the action brought by them is not convincing***\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n81.\n\nRespondent disagrees with Claimants\u2019 argument *(CI \u00a7\u00a7 156, 158)* that the present action is not a class action but one in which the individual Claimants personally act for the enforcement of their own rights and not on behalf of third parties *(R II \u00a7 83).* Respondent characterizes the action as an \"atypical class action\" because if it were a class action, it would not be admitted even in the most liberal States that accept class actions *(Tr p. 65/4).*\n\n82.\n\nFirst, in Respondent\u2019s view, it is obvious that Claimants are not acting personally for the enforcement of their own rights, but it is in fact the *North Atlantic Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 dAdministration* (hereinafter \"NASAM\") which is acting on their behalf. This third-party representation is not a regular or permissible feature of discretionary joinder in internal legal systems or before international tribunals *(R II \u00a7 84; Tr p. 61/13).*\n\n83.\n\nSecondly, the *Incarico (Retainer Agreement) on behalf of NASAM* (hereinafter \"NASAM Mandate\")13 refers twice to \"azione di gruppo\". Whether this is translated as \"group\", \"collective\" or \"class\" action, the fact remains that this is not an individual action. This result is corroborated by the fact that the filing of the action was conditioned upon NASAM\u2019s ability to gather a certain number of members for the group of Claimants. Thus, the NASAM Mandate turns out to be a key document in confirming the true nature of the present action, contrary to Claimants\u2019 attempts to classify it otherwise *(RII \u00a7\u00a7 85, 86; R III \u00a7 3; Tr pp. 65/10, 68/11).*\n\nSee *supra* reference note 3.\n\n84.\n\nThirdly, inasmuch as Claimants assert that this proceeding is not a class action because each Claimant has expressed its individualized consent, Respondent contends that Claimants\u2019 alleged acts of consent lack validity *(R II \u00a7 89),* as explained below.14\n\nFor the Respondent\u2019s position on the issue of Consent of the Claimants see *infra* paras. 173 *et seq.*\n\n85.\n\nFourthly, Claimants\u2019 collective action is in fact a representative or class action in which NASAM inadmissibly acts as Claimants\u2019 sole representative. This becomes manifest from the fact that NASAM \"recruited\" the Claimants and entrusted Avv. Parodi to bring and pursue arbitral proceedings and that Claimants have become simple passive onlookers in a proceeding they cannot influence or modify since they are required to leave the management of the arbitration proceedings in NASAM\u2019s hands *(R II \u00a7 90; Tr p. 63/16).*\n\n***c) Violation of fundamental principles of due process***\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n86.\n\nRespondent further contends that, in the absence of anything like mass or collective claim procedures in the ICSID arbitration, the present proceeding violates fundamental principles of due process *(RI \u00a7 108; RII \u00a7 142).*\n\n87.\n\nFirst, deciding more than a hundred claims [state as of March 2010] would be unworkable and unfair to the Respondent. As mentioned above15, the security entitlements in question relate to 55 different bonds issues [state as of March 2010] under different instruments and subject to different governing laws, and they were acquired by Claimants at different times and under different conditions. The Tribunal would be required to review individually all these cases to determine multiple factual and legal issues (for instance, the nationality and residence of the Claimants, the date of acquisition of the security entitlements, the purchase prices, the circumstances and terms and conditions of each of the 55 bond issuances [state as of March 2010], including the existence of different choice of law and forum clauses and how the value of each bond evolved before and after the contested measures). In particular, there is no sensible way in which Argentina could, within any reasonable period of time, address all these issues in view of each Claimant in its written submissions, let alone in cross-examination and oral submissions in the course of a hearing. The possibility for Argentina to individually analyze and address the claim of each Claimant is, however, a fundamental feature of its rights of defense in the present case *(R I \u00a7 109; R II \u00a7\u00a7 147, 148; R III \u00a7 35).* Furthermore, the Respondent contends that the individualized facts and circumstances regarding each holder of a security entitlement are relevant not only in the merits phase, but are also relevant to the threshold determination of whether the Tribunal has jurisdiction at all *(RII\u00a7\u00a7 149-152).*\n\nSee *supra* para. 77.\n\n88.\n\nSecondly, the owners of security entitlements are persons who have undertaken their transactions in a unilateral fashion. Hence, there is no link among the Claimants and they thus fail to present the characteristics that are typically required to permit joint treatment under collective action regimes. Even under the permissive class action provisions of the US legal system, the New York District Court rejected a collective action brought by holders of a disparate collection of bonds issued by Argentina as the claims involved were \"too large, too diverse, and too vaguely defined to be the basis for a manageable class action.\" For the same reasons, the proposed collective action in the present case would be prohibitively unmanageable *(RI\u00a7 110).*\n\n89.\n\nThirdly, Respondent criticizes that absent from Claimants\u2019 proposed collective action is a legal representative who can adequately and fairly represent the interests of the individual Claimants. In assessing a collective action such as the present one where the interests of the Claimants are represented by a sole representative, it is the Tribunal\u2019s responsibility under any system that allows such claims to evaluate carefully the proposed representative in order to ensure that it has the incentive and ability to pursue vigorously the interests of each and every Claimant *(RI \u00a7 112; RII \u00a7 155).*\n\n90.\n\nFourthly, the Respondent points out that its pertinent submissions merely scratch the surface of the problems of fairness and manageability. Given the absence of rules on collective claims in the framework of the ICSID Convention and therefore given the lack of applicable legal standards, it is impossible to discuss, much less decide, whether such standards have been met. This collective claim simply ignores the lack of such standards and at best asks the Tribunal to develop a *sui generis* process that the ICSID Convention and Rules never contemplated *(RI\u00a7 113).*\n\n91.\n\nRespondent further submits that Rule 19 of the Arbitration Rules, while stating the principle that the Tribunal controls and directs the unfolding of the proceedings through procedural orders, does not empower the Tribunal to create rules of procedure in order to pursue a collective or mass claim. Likewise, Art. 44 of the ICSID Convention allows for the replacement of a small missing element and not whole sets or chapters of rules that cover complete segments of procedure. In Respondent\u2019s view, the procedural adaptations envisaged by the Tribunal in the *Abaclat* case go beyond what is allowed for a tribunal within the framework of the ICSID Convention *(R IVpp. 10, 11).*\n\n**2. Contentions by Claimants**\n-------------------------------\n\n92.\n\nRegarding Respondent\u2019s contention that Claimants have brought a \"collective action\" in the present case, the latter submit that the Respondent\u2019s argument is based on a three-fold assumption: that the Claimants\u2019 claims are a \"mass claim\", that they do not meet the requirements to be treated as a multiparty arbitration by an ICSID tribunal and that they cannot be dealt with by the Tribunal without violating fundamental due process principles *(C I \u00a7 151).* The Claimants seek to refute each of these arguments in their submissions and point out that the present arbitration is far from being \"extraordinary\" or \"unprecedented\", as suggested by the Respondent *(CI \u00a7 153).*\n\n***a) The nature of the action brought by the Claimants***\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n93.\n\nClaimants criticize Respondent for seeking to present the claims at stake as a \"mass claim\", \"collective claims\", \"collective actions\" or even a \"class action\" *(CI \u00a7 155; CII \u00a7 51).* As Respondent itself admits, the main feature of mass proceedings or class actions is their representative nature. However, this does not hold true in the present dispute in which the individual Claimants are directly and personally acting for the enforcement of their own rights and not on behalf of any third parties (C *I \u00a7\u00a7 157, 158; C III \u00a7 74; Tr p. 215/8).* The action brought is thus one brought by a limited number of well-identified Claimants who hold substantially identical securities and who complain about the very same illegality (C *I \u00a7\u00a7 160, 165; C II \u00a7 51; Tr p. 15/20).* Reliance on the Dissenting Opinion of Professor Abi-Saab in the *Abaclat* case cannot help Respondent in the present dispute due to the enormous difference between 60,000 claimants in the *Abaclat* case and 64 Claimants in the case at hand (C *IV\u00a7\u00a7 50, 51).*\n\n94.\n\nMoreover, according to the Claimants, Respondent\u2019s assimilation of the present action to the global claims settlement machinery (e.g. the Iran-US Claims Tribunal or the UN Compensation Commission) is misleading. Those mechanisms aimed to ensure the global consequences of a behavior of a State such as war, invasion, etc. and vis-\u00e0-vis victims whose number and identity could not be ascertained beforehand. The claims in the present case are of a different type, as this dispute deals with a very specific set of facts and Claimants *(CI \u00a7\u00a7 163, 164; C III \u00a7 74).*\n\n95.\n\nInasmuch as Respondent contends that NASAM \"recruited\" the Claimants to participate in a class action, the latter refer to their characterization of NASAM\u2019s role in the present proceedings, as described in the following Chapter of the present Decision.16 NASAM simply made available to the Claimants a mechanism to fund their action and acted on Claimants\u2019 behalf in choosing counsel, thereby providing them with a concrete opportunity to pursue their rights (C *I \u00a7\u00a7 161, 162; CII \u00a7\u00a7 54, 56).*\n\nSee *infra* paras. 202, 203.\n\n96.\n\nIn addition, Claimants refute Respondent\u2019s argument that the NASAM Mandate itself speaks of a \"class action\". The term solely appears in the Mandate\u2019s English translation submitted by the Respondent. Insofar as the NASAM Mandate refers to \"azioni di gruppo\" (group actions), the term is manifestly used in a non-technical sense. Moreover, the language of the Mandate is not of itself dispositive of the nature of the proceedings and cannot affect the true nature of the action brought before the Tribunal (C *I \u00a7 162; CII \u00a753).*\n\n***b) Possibility of bringing multi-party arbitrations before an ICSID*** ***tribunal without special consent of the Parties***\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n97.\n\nWhile Respondent submits that the rules governing ICSID arbitration do not contemplate the possibility of multi-party arbitrations and that these are therefore not allowed, Claimants insist that there is nothing in the ICSID Convention and Rules and the Argentina-Italy BIT nor in the factual set of circumstances of the present case which would stand in the way of the claims brought being adjudicated by the present Tribunal *(C I \u00a7 168).* The silence of the afore-mentioned legal instruments is not conclusive and cannot be construed as a prohibition of proceedings with multiple claimants (C *III \u00a7 77).*\n\n98.\n\nAccording to Claimants, it is further irrelevant whether the contracting parties contemplated actions involving multiple claimants or not when they entered into the Argentina-Italy BIT, since the rules on treaty interpretation according to Art. 31 of the *Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties* of 23 May 1969 (hereinafter \"VCLT\") require agreements to be interpreted not in the light of the intention of the parties at the time of the treaty\u2019s conclusion, but in accordance with the ordinary meaning of the terms of the treaty in their context and in the light of the treaty\u2019s object and purpose (C *II \u00a7 67).* In addition, the fact that most national procedural laws (including the Italian and the Argentine ones) permit the bringing of joint actions by more than one claimant suggests that the concept is not so alien that Respondent could not have conceived of its application (C *III \u00a7\u00a7 84, 85; Tr p. 221/13).* Furthermore, the Claimants argue that the admissibility of actions brought by multiple claimants before international courts and tribunals is almost a general principle (C *III \u00a7 83).*\n\n99.\n\nIn particular, Claimants insist that the use of the singular in Art. 25(1) of the ICSID Convention is not intended to preclude the institution of proceedings by multiple claimants *(CI \u00a7 176; C III \u00a7 80).* In a similar vein, the use of the singular (\"investor\") in Art. 8(1) of the Argentina-Italy BIT is no conclusive argument for Respondent\u2019s position. First, terms used in the singular are usually interpreted to include the plural and *vice versa.* Most dispute resolution clauses in BITs use the term \"investor\" in the singular, and this has never been an issue in ICSID arbitration. Second, both the heading of Art. 8 and Art. 8 para. 3 of the Argentina-Italy BIT use the plural \"investors\" (C *II \u00a7 69; Tr p. 223/2).*\n\n100.\n\nIn addition, ICSID practice displays many examples of proceedings with multiple claimants where these are linked by the same factual background, the same relief sought and the same legal basis *(CI \u00a7 170; C III \u00a7 80).* By the Claimants\u2019 count, there have been more than 120 multi-party investment cases, including ICSID and NAFTA (C *IV \u00a7 60).* Moreover, Claimants point out that Respondent\u2019s assertion that no ICSID case involved more than fourteen claimants is not correct (C *I \u00a7 194)* and that the Dissenting Opinion of Professor Abi-Saab in the *Abaclat* case fell victim to the same mistake (C *IV\u00a7 60).*\n\n101.\n\nInasmuch as Respondent contends that the present case is different from other multi-party arbitrations since it is brought by \"contractually unrelated\" parties, Claimants submit that there is no predetermined catalogue of types of cases that can form the subject of an arbitration brought by a plurality of claimants (C *I \u00a7\u00a7 171, 172).* In their view, the sole requirement for setting in motion ICSID proceedings, including those with a multiplicity of claimants, is that all of them must have given their consent in writing *(CI \u00a7 173).*\n\n102.\n\nIf it were conceded that there ought to be a reasonable and significant link between the claims of the individual claimants and that it were not possible to adjudicate in the same arbitration totally unrelated claims, in the Claimants\u2019 submission, these criteria would certainly be fulfilled for the present dispute (C *I \u00a7 177).* All the pertinent claims arise from and relate to a substantially identical factual and legal pattern. The differences between the positions of the Claimants (i.e. the fact that they hold bonds issued under different conditions, applicable law, currency and interest rate) are totally immaterial to the subject-matter. The identity of the illegality complained of, of the legal basis and of the relief sought is more than sufficient to establish a link between the claims that justifies their being treated in the same proceedings, as is illustrated by the *Funnekotter and others v. Zimbabwe* case.17 Thus, the lack of a direct contractual link between the Claimants cannot be an obstacle to their claims being adjudicated in the same proceeding *(CI \u00a7\u00a7 178, 179; C III \u00a7\u00a7 75, 76; Tr pp. 220/16, 473/15).*\n\n*Bernardus Henricus Funnekotter and others v. Zimbabwe,* ICSID Case No. ARB/05/6, Award, 22 April 2009.\n\n103.\n\nContrary to the Respondent\u2019s assumption, a specific consent on its part to have a plurality of claims brought under the umbrella of a single arbitration is not required (C *I \u00a7 174; C III \u00a7 81).* Insofar as Respondent contends that in the cases brought against Argentina which were cited by the Claimants Argentina had consented to multiple claims being brought in the same arbitration, Claimants argue that in the pertinent cases consent flowed simply from the offer contained in the BIT. The admissibility of a multipartite action was not even discussed by the respective ICSID tribunals. In any event, the fact of Argentina not contesting the admissibility of such actions can be of no relevance *(C I \u00a7 184; CIV \u00a7 59).* Respondent is, however, right to point out that consent is needed for the consolidation of cases, i.e. the joinder of two or more proceedings, but this a constellation very different from that in the present dispute *(CI \u00a7 186; CII \u00a7 71).*\n\n104.\n\nReferring to the *Abaclat* case, Claimants contend that the majority decision was correct in finding that consent to multiple claims is clearly implied by the acceptance of jurisdiction in relation to bonds. Since bonds by definition are mass instruments, it would be counterintuitive that ICSID protection would obtain in respect of them only if each bondholder acts individually (C *IV\u00a7 53).*\n\n105.\n\nInasmuch as Respondent points to Claimants\u2019 alleged lack of consent to bringing their proceedings in a single arbitration, it is submitted that each Claimant obviously knew that its claim would be prosecuted together with those of other bondholders. Respondent\u2019s reference to Italian law is misplaced, as explained in the following Chapter of the present Decision18, since Italian law does not govern these proceedings (C *II \u00a7 75; C III \u00a7 85; Tr pp. 221/5, 474/20).* Pursuant to the Claimants, referring to Italian or Argentine law which both permit the bringing of joint actions by more than one claimant regarding proceedings with similar factual or legal circumstances merely indicates that the possibility of bringing multiple actions is a generally acknowledged principle, notably by the two parties of the pertinent BIT (C *III \u00a7\u00a7 83-85; Tr p. 474/22).*\n\nSee *infra* para. 194.\n\n***c) No risk for due process by admitting multi-party arbitrations***\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n106.\n\nClaimants further criticize the Respondent for submitting that multi-party arbitrations cannot be properly and effectively managed due to the absence of specific rules and proceedings to deal with them and that due process would therefore be jeopardized when entertaining jurisdiction in regard to such arbitrations. In the Claimants\u2019 view, such erroneous reasoning essentially draws on Respondent\u2019s failed attempt to assimilate a case as the present one to a class action (C *I \u00a7 189).* The same holds true for the misplaced analogy regarding international claims settlements (C *I \u00a7 191).* Unlike those mechanisms, in the present case each one of the Claimants is clearly identified and properly before the Tribunal, and the numbers involved are very small compared to those in class action cases which typically amount to thousands or tens of thousands of persons *(CI \u00a7 190).*\n\n107.\n\nAs regards Respondent\u2019s submissions concerning the manageability of the case, Claimants contend that Respondent deliberately overblows the complexity of the case. The number of Claimants is not a particular concern, notably so that the number of Claimants has dropped significantly (C *III \u00a7 88; Tr p. 224/8).* The catalogue of questions lying on the table is not particularly impressive. The differences between the bonds held by the Claimants are immaterial to the present dispute. Thus, the overall number of issues, documents, expert reports, witnesses and other elements that the Tribunal will have to consider will not be greater than those which many international arbitral tribunals routinely have to deal with *(CI \u00a7\u00a7 192, 193; CII \u00a7 77; CIV\u00a7 56).*\n\n108.\n\nIn the Claimants\u2019 eyes, the Respondent is unable to substantiate how its right to due process could be jeopardized in the present case. To refer to the difficulty in hearing all the Claimants as witnesses can be of no avail in that regard because it is difficult to see why the Respondent could in good faith seek to examine each and every Claimant. The vast majority of the pertinent issues can easily be disposed of by documents *(CI \u00a7 196).*\n\n109.\n\nMoreover, Claimants contend that the present Tribunal must assess its jurisdiction on the basis of the requirements set forth in Art. 25(1) of the ICSID Convention and the Argentina-Italy BIT. The availability of suitable procedural rules is not among the conditions which allow an ICSID tribunal to dismiss an action on jurisdictional or admissibility grounds. Once jurisdiction and admissibility are established, it will be for the Tribunal and the Parties to agree on the most appropriate procedure to deal with the issues at stake *(CI \u00a7 199).* It is manifestly false to state that adaptations of the procedure to deal with unprecedented situations can only occur through amendments to the ICSID Rules (C *II \u00a7 76),* as Art. 44 of the ICSID Convention empowers the Tribunal to adopt the proper decisions on the conduct of the procedure (C *III \u00a7 88; Tr p. 224/17).*\n\n110.\n\nFinally, on a more practical level, Claimants submit that their decision to bring a single proceeding instead of separate arbitrations for each one of them is unquestionably the most efficient and advantageous course of action as it avoids countless parallel proceedings, reduces costs enormously and eliminates the risk of inconsistent decisions. This is also in Respondent\u2019s interest since its defense would have been much more complicated and costly, had the Claimants submitted separate requests for arbitration in each single case. In such scenario, Argentina would surely have moved to obtain the consolidation of the claims (C *I \u00a7\u00a7 200, 201; C III \u00a7 89; Tr p. 225/11).*\n\n**B. Findings of the Tribunal**\n-------------------------------\n\n**1. The nature of the claim submitted to the Tribunal**\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n111.\n\nRespondent contends that neither the ICSID Convention nor the Argentina-Italy BIT provide a legal basis to the submission of the type of claims brought before the Tribunal by the Claimants and that Respondent, in any event, did never consent to such claims being brought to an ICISD tribunal.\n\n112.\n\nThe task of the Tribunal to decide on this jurisdictional objection is complicated by the fact that the Parties have used different terms, and have relied on various concepts, to characterize the claim brought by Claimants in the present proceedings: collective actions, mass claims, class action, multi-party or aggregate proceedings, etc. Also the *Abaclat* Tribunal has found that \"there is no uniform terminology concerning the various kinds of proceedings involving a high number of parties, and that various jurisdictions, courts and authors refer to different terms and meanings.\"19\n\n*Abaclat* Decision, para. 480\n\n113.\n\nThe Tribunal must, for reasons of clarity of the subsequent reasoning, first of all identify what type of claim has been submitted to it in the present dispute. As a matter of fact, when the Request was filed on 23 June 2008, the claim in question was brought to the Tribunal by 119 Claimants. In the wake of the 2010 Exchange Offer20, this number dropped to 90 Claimants.21 In that sense and without using these terms in any technical sense or in analogy to any type of procedures in domestic or international law bearing the same name, the Tribunal has to deal with *multiple* claimants or a *multi-party* proceeding.\n\nSee in more detail *infra* note 156.\n\nSee *infra* paras. 334 *et seq.*\n\n***a) The present action is not a \"class action\" and should not be referred to as a \"massproceeding\"***\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n114.\n\nAt the same time, the Tribunal does not consider that the action before it may adequately be referred to as (1) a \"class action\" or (2) \"mass claim(s)\"/\"mass proceeding(s)\".\n\n**(1) The \"class action\" issue**\n--------------------------------\n\n115.\n\nAs regards the first term, class actions are a procedural device provided for in different domestic laws such as in US law. There is no indication whatsoever, and both Parties are in agreement on this aspect, that a procedural mechanism comparable to the US class action system would exist within the framework of the ICSID Convention. Furthermore, the Parties agree that the main feature of a class action is its representative nature (C *I \u00a7 157; RI \u00a7 112).* As the *Abaclat* Decision has usefully pointed out in that regard,\n\n[s]ome jurisdictions address collective injuries by creating mechanisms allowing claims to be brought for representative relief. Whilst forms of representative relief vary greatly, they have in common that a high number of claims arise as one single action. The mechanisms in which these claims are brought together vary and can be categorized by reference to their approach to three different issues: (a) the nature of the claim, with regard to which representative relief can take the form of a purely procedural device available regardless of the type of substantive law at issue, or be limited to certain fields of law (e.g., consumer law, antitrust, etc.); (b) the nature of the representative, who can be a private named individual on behalf of a large group of unnamed others or an approved intermediary entity on behalf of all injured individuals; (c) the nature of the relief, which can take the form of individual damages or representative relief (e.g., declaratory or injunctive relief).22\n\n*Abaclat* Decision, para. 483.\n\n116.\n\nIn contrast, in the present case each of the Claimants signed an individual Power of Attorney.23 The subject-matter of the proceedings are the Claimants\u2019, and only their, claims. According to Art. 53(1) of the ICSID Convention, the decisions to be taken by the present Tribunal are binding upon the Claimants, and solely upon them. The Claimants are clearly identified individuals and act in their own names and not on behalf of any third party, notably not NASAM.24 The current proceedings do therefore not have a representative character at all. Accordingly, since a class action mechanism in any technical meaning of the word neither exists under the ICSID Convention nor was it the Claimants\u2019 intention to submit such class action to the Tribunal, the Tribunal is certainly not in the presence of a class action or anything close to it.\n\nSee *infra* para. 230.\n\nSee in more detail *infra* paras. 273 *et seq.*\n\n117.\n\nThis was also the conclusion of the Tribunal in the *Abaclat* case:\n\nLooking at the way the present arbitration was initiated, the present proceedings appear to be aggregate proceedings, in which each individual Claimant is aware of and consented to the ICSID arbitration. As such, the present proceedings cannot be compared to US class actions, in which a representative initiates a proceeding in the name of a class composed of an undetermined number of unidentified claimants. In the present arbitration, the number of Claimants is established and so is their identity.25\n\n*Abaclat* Decision, para. 486.\n\n118.\n\nRespondent is correct to point out that the Claimants, by using the term \"azioni di gruppo\" twice in the NASAM Mandate26, have themselves contributed to a certain confusion in the matter. However, the NASAM Mandate is a contract between NASAM and the Claimants and has therefore no direct bearing on the present dispute.27 In addition, even if the NASAM Mandate were to be deemed legally relevant in the sense of a need to interpret the Request in the light of the Mandate, without the Request in any manner referring to it, this could not be dispositive of the objective nature of the claim brought before the present Tribunal. It should be noted that the Respondent frames its objection in terms of a lack of its consent to the adjudication of such type of claim. This is, however, a challenge to the jurisdiction of ICSID and the competence of the present Tribunal to decide the case at hand which must be answered on the basis of the objective character of the claim in dispute between the Parties and not of the way it is denominated by them in their submissions, let alone in a document which has no direct relation to or bearing upon the present proceedings.\n\nSee *R II \u00a7\u00a7 85, 86* and *Tr p. 66/8,* referring to preambular para. N and para. 13 of the NASAM Mandate (Annex RA 108); see also the English translation (Annex RA 108) of preambular para. N of the NASAM Mandate (speaking of the undersigned persons \"hav[ing] been informed that the actions to be brought [...] are \u2018class actions\u2019\") as well as of para. 13 of the NASAM Mandate (\"[...] involved in the class action to be brought [...]\").\n\nSee *infra* para. 226.\n\n**(2) The \"mass claim\" issue**\n------------------------------\n\n119.\n\nAs concerns, secondly, the characterization of the claim in the present dispute as \"mass claim(s)\" or \"mass proceeding(s)\", the Tribunal considers that this is not a technical term. It cannot be precisely defined at what point a multitude of claimants turns into a \"mass\" of claimants. In principle, the Tribunal would not have objections to refer to the initial number of 119 Claimants in the present case, in terms of everyday speech, as a \"mass\", compared to two or five claimants in other disputes. However, it would caution against drawing any specific conclusions from the use of this term.\n\n120.\n\nIn particular, the Tribunal would want to point out that the \"mass claim\" concept was commonly relied upon in the context of the *Abaclat* proceedings with its initially 180,000 and now still 60,000 claimants.28 Whilst the Tribunal does not take any stand on the question of the appropriate terminology to be used in that case, it would emphasize that the dimension of the Claimants in the case to be decided by the present Tribunal can in no way be compared to the *Abaclat* case, being merely one thousandth of the latter. Especially insofar as the use of the term \"mass claim\" or \"mass proceedings\" might convey the connotation that already the sheer number of claimants in itself calls for modifications or adaptations of the procedural arrangements to guarantee the manageability or fairness of the case, the Tribunal strongly insists that it does not see any such implications arising from the number of initially 119 and now 90 Claimants as such. It is against this background of linguistic ambiguity and potential confusions and misunderstandings arising from it that the Tribunal would advise against the use of the concept of \"mass claims\" and \"mass proceedings\" in regard to the present dispute and will itself consequently abstain from relying on these terms in the following.\n\nSee *Abaclat* Decision, paras. 1, 90, 640.\n\n***b) The character of the present action as a \"multi-party\"*** ***proceeding***\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n121.\n\nThe Parties have also referred to the present proceedings as \"collective action\" or \"aggregate proceedings\". As these are again no technical terms with a fixed meaning, at least not in the framework of the ICSID Convention, the Tribunal has no principled objections against using them. It would only add two caveats in this regard: First, it should be understood at all times that to rely on such terms should not lead to introduce, through the \"backdoor\" as it were, elements characteristic of \"class actions\" or \"mass claims\" into the notion of collective or aggregate proceedings. This would risk to thwart or at least to undermine the efforts for terminological clarity in which the Tribunal engaged in the previous sub-section. Second, and with a similar intention, such terms should not be taken as a basis to import aspects into the ICSID framework which are associated with concepts deriving from the court litigation and arbitration regime of domestic laws (notably Argentine or Italian law) or other areas of international law, which might bear the same name but may well have a technical meaning different from, or even incompatible with, the legal framework set up by the ICSID Convention.\n\n122.\n\nWith these provisos in mind, the Tribunal will now proceed to the essence of the contention between the Parties in this section, i.e. the question whether a claim involving multiple Claimants such as the one presented to this Tribunal can find its legal basis in the ICSID Convention and the Argentina-Italy BIT and whether it may be deemed to be covered by Respondent\u2019s consent to ICSID jurisdiction and thus to be within the competence of this Tribunal. For reasons of clarity and to avoid any confusion in this area which is highly prone to a \"terminological imbroglio\", the Tribunal will in its subsequent reasoning stick to qualifying the present proceeding as a \"multi-party action\" or \"multiparty proceeding\".\n\n***c) The present claim is not the result of a joinder of proceedings***\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n123.\n\nHaving concluded that the present dispute constitutes a multi-party proceeding, a further conceptual clarification is in place: A multi-party proceeding can be the result of the initial submission of a certain number of separate individual arbitrations which are subsequently consolidated and joined with each other. There can be no doubt that such an *ex post* joinder or consolidation of proceedings is subject to a specific consent of the Parties.29 One might refer to the *Wintershall* case in this regard which related to the *ex post* addition (viz. substitution30) of a claimant (i.e. the Wintershall Holding AG) to the proceedings, which indeed required the Respondent\u2019s consent.31\n\nSee *G. Kaufrnann-Kohler et al.,* Consolidation of Proceedings in Investment Arbitration: How Can Multiple Proceedings Arising from the Same or Related Situations be Handled Efficiently? Final Report on the Geneva Colloquium held on 22 April 2006, 21 ICSID Review-Foreign Investment Law Journal 59 (2006) (Annex AL RA 7). To be sure, the Final Report expressly noted that \"the ICSID Convention and the ICSID Arbitration Rules are silent on consolidation. Failing an express provision, it is untenable to argue that the institution or the arbitration tribunal has the power to consolidate separate arbitrations\" *(ibid.,* p. 91). However, it should be taken into account as well that the Final Report based itself on an understanding of consolidation as \"the joinder of two or more proceedings that are pending before different tribunals\" and which \"does not cover multiparty and multicontract arbitrations\" *(ibid.,* pp. 80, 81).\n\nSee *Wintershall AG v. Argentine Republic,* ICSID Case No. ARB/04/14, Award, 8 December 2008, para. 31: \"Meanwhile, the Claimant by a letter of May 18, 2007 notified the Centre of a \u2018spin-off\u2019: viz. regarding a corporate restructuring of all assets and liabilities of the Claimant including assignment of all rights and liabilities of the Claimant against the Argentine Republic [...] to a new legal entity: with a prayer for recognition by the Tribunal of this new entity, which would continue, as Claimant, the ICSID Claim that had been filed by the original Claimant.\" See also *ibid.,* paras. 45 *et seq.*\n\n*lb id.,* paras. 59 and 60.\n\n124.\n\nThe present dispute is not a case of consolidation of proceedings, however, but the original submission of a claim by a plurality of Claimants in one single ICSID proceeding. This appears to be conceded by the Respondent itself when it states in relation to the *Abaclat* case - which is analogous in this regard to the present dispute -that there \"the claims were not filed on a separate basis and later aggregated, but were filed on an aggregate basis from the beginning, and may not be treated as individual claims\" *(RIV p. 4).*\n\n125.\n\nAccordingly, the subsequent analysis does not deal with the question of what kind of consent is needed for a subsequent joinder or consolidation of proceedings, but whether, within the framework of the ICSID Convention, the original submission of a multi-party claim requires an act of consent on the part of the Respondent beyond the general jurisdictional requirement of written consent pursuant to Art. 25(1) of the Convention.\n\n**2. Consent to multi-party proceedings within the framework of the ICSID Convention and the Argentina-Italy BIT**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n126.\n\nThere is full agreement between the Parties that neither the ICSID Convention and Rules nor the Argentina-Italy BIT contain any provision that would specifically address the question, notably the lawfulness *vel non,* of multi-party proceedings in an ICSID arbitration such as the one which is presently before the Tribunal. The Parties disagree, however, as to what consequences should be drawn from this silence of the pertinent documents.\n\n127.\n\nThe Tribunal would recall in this context that the Tribunal in the *Abaclat* case was confronted with similar differences of opinions:\n\nTo recall, Respondent contends that arbitration in the form of collective proceedings is not provided for by ICSID [and] that this silence is a \"qualified silence\" that should be interpreted to mean that collective arbitration is not possible [... ] under the current ICSID framework [...].\n\nIt is undisputed that the ICSID framework contains no reference to collective proceedings as a possible form of arbitration. The key question here is how to interpret the Convention\u2019s silence. In particular, the Tribunal is tasked with the assessment of whether this silence should be considered a \"qualified silence,\" meaning an intended silence indicating that it does not allow for something that is not provided, or whether it is to be considered a \"gap,\" which was unintended and which the Tribunal has the power to fill [... ],32\n\n*Abaclat Decision,* paras. 516, 517.\n\n128.\n\nThe submissions of the Parties in the *Abaclat* case mark the two ends of the spectrum of possible interpretations of the Convention\u2019s silence on multi-party proceedings, and also in the present dispute the Parties have organized their arguments along these lines. Whereas Claimants contend that the silence of the pertinent legal instruments is not conclusive and cannot be understood as a prohibition of proceedings with multiple claimants (C *III \u00a7* 77), Respondent submits that the absence of express provisions for multi-party proceedings cannot be construed to implicitly allow for such actions, but that the absence of clear and express consent to multi-party proceedings leads to the opposite conclusion *(RI\u00a7 91; RII\u00a7\u00a7 101, 106).*\n\n***a) Existence of the Parties\u2019 consent to multi-party proceedings***\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n129.\n\nIn order to decide these questions, and the Parties are again in agreement on this aspect, the Tribunal must rely on the general rules of treaty interpretation as codified in arts. 31 and 32 of the VCLT. Pursuant to Art. 31 para. 1 of the Vienna Convention, \"[a] treaty shall be interpreted in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their consent and in the light of its object and purpose.\"\n\n130.\n\nFirst, the Tribunal considers that, at the level of interpretation according to the ordinary meaning of the relevant terms, the wording of Art. 25 of the ICSID Convention is susceptible to accommodate both interpretations. While it is true that the provision speaks of \"a national of [a] Contracting State\" in the singular, nothing would force the Tribunal to conclude that this wording could not also encompass a plurality of individuals. The argument that the use of the singular for \"national\" in Art. 25 of the ICSID Convention would bar multipartite arbitration was raised in the *Kl\u00f6ckner and others v. Cameroon* case but was not taken up by the Tribunal deciding that case and was apparently dropped by the respondent Government.33\n\nSee *C. Schreuer,* The ICSID Convention. A Commentary, 2nd ed., Cambridge 2011, Art. 25, para. 279 (hereinafter *\"Schreuer.* ICSID Convention Commentary\"), referring to *G.R. Delaume,* ICSID Arbitration, in: J. Lew (ed.), Contemporary Problems in International Arbitration (1987), 23, 36, 37.\n\n131.\n\nMoreover, the same result follows from an analysis of Art. 8 of the Argentina-Italy BIT. This provision speaks interchangeably of \"an investor\" (paras. 1 and 5) and \"investors\" (heading and para. 3). The Tribunal is not able to follow Respondent\u2019s argument that Art. 8 paras. 1 and 5 are somewhat more \"relevant\" than para. 3 or the title of this provision *(Tr p. 361/3),* at least not for the purpose of drawing the conclusion that the wording of Art. 8 of the BIT would *restrict* Respondent\u2019s consent to arbitrate to claims filed by a single investor. In the Tribunal\u2019s view, this rather underscores the opposite conclusion that the ordinary meaning of the term \"national\" in Art. 25(1) of the ICSID Convention, when viewed together with Art. 8 of the Argentina-Italy BIT, may well include the situation of a plurality of investors submitting a legal dispute to the Centre.\n\n132.\n\nSecondly, the Tribunal notes that, while the *travaux pr\u00e9paratoires* can only provide supplementary means of interpretation in the sense of Art. 32 of the VCLT, some discussions took place at the time of conclusion of the ICSID Convention in regard to multi-party proceedings.34 However, these discussions were not conclusive as to the intention to either accept or refuse multi-party arbitrations.35 This might nonetheless weaken Respondent\u2019s claim that accepting multi-party arbitrations would extend the jurisdictional basis \"way beyond the \u2018horizon of foreseeability\u2019 of the drafters of the ICSID Convention,\" i.e. to what the Parties could have foreseen at the time the treaty was concluded or consent was given.36\n\nFor instance, during the drafting of the Convention, the British expert mentioned that there might well be more than just two parties to a dispute and that he assumed that this was implicit in the draft (see *Schreuer,* ICSID Convention Commentary, Art. 25, para. 277, referring to Documents Concerning the Origin and the Formulation of the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States (1968), Vol. II, 400,413.\n\nProfessor Abi-Saab\u2019s Dissenting Opinion in the *Abaclat* case, in its para. 175, affirmatively refers to the majority opinion\u2019s statement that during the drafting of the ICSID Convention, the question of multi-party arbitrations was left open. He adds that \"[i]t was debated during the latest revision of the Rules, but again was not expressly addressed in the revised Rules of 2006\".\n\n*RIV pp. 6, 8,* endorsing para. 165 of Professor Abi-Saab\u2019s Dissenting Opinion and critically referring to para. 519 of the *Abaclat* Decision.\n\n133.\n\nThirdly, and related to the previous aspect, Claimants are right to point out that the domestic laws of both Argentina and Italy were familiar with multi-party proceedings at the time when these countries gave consent to the ICSID Convention and the Argentina-Italy BIT.37 This is also confirmed by the statement of Professor Kielmanovich, the expert on Argentine procedural law nominated by the Respondent. According to him, Art. 88 of the 1981 Argentine Code of Civil and Commercial Procedure allows for *litisconsorcio facultativo* \"where the different claims [...] are related to one another on account of their cause, purpose or both, *i.e.* where the claims rely on the same legal relationship or the same fact\".38 This reference is not meant to establish the possibility to conduct multi-party proceedings as a general principle of law in the sense of Art. 38 para. 1 lit. c of the *Statute of the International Court of Justice.* The Tribunal would note in that regard that not even the Claimants\u2019 submissions make such a far-reaching claim when they state that it is \"almost\" a general principle that multiple claimants may bring actions before international courts and tribunals (C *III \u00a7 83).*\n\nSee the references to Art. 88 of the Argentine Code of Civil and Commercial Procedure on \"litisconcorcio facultativo\" and Art. 103 of the Italian Code of Civil Procedure on \"litisconsorzio facoltativo\". Both Parties appear to agree on this aspect; see *Tr pp. 219/8; 365/20.*\n\nOpinion of Professor Jorge Kielmanovich, 26 February 2010, para. 12. The original text of Art. 88 of the 1981 Code reads, as follows: \"Litisconcorcio facultativo. Podr\u00e1n varias partes demandar o ser demandadas en un mismo proceso cuando las acciones sean conexas por el t\u00edtulo, o por el objeto, o por ambos elementos a la vez.\" (in English translation: \"Discretionary Joinder. One lawsuit may involve several plaintiffs or several defendants when the actions in question have the same cause, purpose, or both.\") ft is worth noting that Professor Kielmanovich deals with this issue under the heading \"La acumulaci\u00f3n subjetiva en el derecho argentino\" (in English translation: \"Joinder of Parties under Argentine Law\"). The term \"joinder\" here has obviously a broader meaning than that in which it was used before; see *supra* para. 123.\n\n134.\n\nSimilarly, the reference to Argentine and Italian law does not suggest that the present dispute is governed by either of these domestic laws. The Tribunal will explain in further detail below that questions of jurisdiction do not follow Art. 42 but Art. 25 of the ICSID Convention and are therefore exclusively governed by international law.39 The Tribunal notes, however, that the admission of multi-party proceedings in the afore-mentioned sense does not come as a surprise to the Respondent, but that it is well accustomed from its own legislation and legal tradition that instituting multi-party proceedings is perfectly possible under certain circumstances. It deserves mention in this regard that when the Respondent *(R IV p. 8)* refers to the *Abaclat* Decision\u2019s statement that \"at the time of the conclusion of the ICSID Convention, collective proceedings were quasi inexistant\",40 the reference is obviously to class action- or mass claim-type collective proceedings.41 The reference is not to standard multi-party proceedings in the sense of claims submitted by a plurality of claimants, which is the case here and which was a ubiquitous phenomenon at the time of the adoption of the ICSID Convention.\n\nSee *infra* paras. 233 *et seq.*\n\n*Abaclat* Decision, para. 519; see also Dissenting Opinion of Professor Abi-Saab in the. Abaclat case. para. 165.\n\nAs to these concepts see *supra* paras. 114 *et seq.*\n\n135.\n\nFourthly, in the history of ICSID, there are numerous examples of cases involving several or even multiple claimants.42 Claimants submit that there have been more than 120 multiparty investment cases, including ICSID and NAFTA (C *IV \u00a7 60).* Whether this number is correct or not, a look at ICSID\u2019s case list43 reveals that 38 out of the 398 reported cases include the phrase \"and others\" on the claimant\u2019s side, i.e. they are multi-party cases.44 Already this simple fact manifests that multi-party arbitration is a common feature in ICSID arbitration. Regarding numbers, these cases involve a varying number of claimants ranging from 3 to 1445 or 137 claimants46, respectively. To be sure, the *Abaclat* Tribunal stated that \"[w]hile it has happened in the past that multiple claimants initiated ICSID arbitration proceedings, this appears to be the first case in ICSID\u2019s history that \u2018mass claims\u2019 are brought before it.\"47 This observation only holds true, however, for that very case with its initially 180,000 and currently still 60,000 claimants48, but not for the present case which, with its few dozens of Claimants, appears to remain well within the overall scale of previous ICSID and other arbitral proceedings.\n\nSee *Schreuer Commentary,* Art. 25, para. 278.\n\nAs of 21 August 2012 (http://icsid.worldbank,org/ICSID/FrontServlet?reauestType=CasesRH&actionVal=ListCases).\n\nThe phrase \"and others\" points to the existence of three or more claimants, since otherwise the case name includes the name of the two claimants, without the addition of \"and others\".\n\nBoth the Respondent *(R I \u00a7 104; R II \u00a7 129)* and the Dissenting Opinion of Professor Abi-Saab in the *Abaclat* case, para. 171 curiously refer to *Bernardus Henricus Funnekotter and others v. Zimbabwe,* ICSID Case No. ARB/05/6, Award, 22 April 2009, with its 14 claimants as being the case with most claimants in ICSID history so far.\n\nSee *Alasdair Ross Anderson and others v. Costa Rica,* ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/07/3, Award, 19 May 2010.\n\n*Abaclat* Decision, para. 295.\n\nSee *supra* note 28.\n\n136.\n\nFifthly, the practice of having more than one party on the investor\u2019s side was also accepted by a number of ICSID tribunals. As already mentioned before49, in the *Kl\u00f6ckner and others v. Cameroon* case, the respondent Government initially argued that the use of the singular for \"national\" in Art. 25 of the ICSID Convention would bar multipartite arbitration. However, this claim was not taken up by the Tribunal and was apparently dropped by the respondent Government subsequently.50 Furthermore, in *Goetz and others* v. *Burundi,* six Belgian shareholders of a Burundian company jointly instituted proceedings, and the deciding Tribunal saw no problem in the fact that there was a group of claimants submitting the claim together.51\n\nSee *supra* para. 130.\n\nSee *supra* note 33. The Dissenting Opinion of Professor Abi-Saab in the *Abaclat* case, para. 175, n. 40 curiously relies on this aspect in support of the proposition that \"the rule of \u2018secondary consent\u2019 was consistently upheld in multi-party arbitration\".\n\n*Antoine Goetz and others v. Burundi,* ICSID Case No. ARB/95/3, Award, 10 February 1999, para. 89; see also *Schreuer,* ICSID Convention Commentary, Art. 25, para. 280 in this regard.\n\n137.\n\nIf it were argued that these cases only involved a small number of claimants, as Respondent does *(R II \u00a7 137),* it must be acknowledged that meanwhile arbitral tribunals have dealt with much bigger numbers of claimants, for instance, with 46 claimants in the *Bayview and others v. Mexico* case52, with 137 claimants in the *Alasdair Ross Anderson and others v. Costa Rica* case53 and with 109 claimants in the *Cattlemen* case.54 As to the latter, while this case was not arbitrated under the ICSID Convention, but was a NAFTA case conducted under UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules, it should be pointed out that the pertinent provisions of the North American Free Trade Agreement are very similar to those relevant to the present dispute.55\n\n*Bayview Irrigation District and others v. Mexico,* ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/05/l, Award, 19 June 2007.\n\n*Alasdair Ross Anderson and othersv. Costa Rica,* ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/07/3, Award, 19 May 2010.\n\nNAFTA/UNCITRAL, *Canadian Cattlemen for Fair Trade v. United States,* Award on Jurisdiction, 28 January 2008.\n\nSee notably Art. 1116 para. 1 of the *North American Free Trade Agreement**.* \"An investor of a Party may submit to arbitration under this Section a claim that another Party has breached an obligation [...]\".\n\n138.\n\nIt must be conceded to the Respondent, however, that in all the afore-mentioned cases the deciding tribunals eventually declared themselves lacking in jurisdiction - albeit never in relation to the fact that several or even many claimants had instituted the proceedings, as this aspect was not an issue in any of these disputes. The silence of both the respondent Governments and the deciding tribunals in all these cases as to the presence of a multitude of investors on the claimant\u2019s side may be interpreted as an indirect acknowledgment that this was not an obstacle for the cases to proceed *(CI \u00a7 183).* Yet, it can also be understood as manifestation of the principle that, where a tribunal admits one of the objections put forward and determines that it has no jurisdiction, there is no need for the tribunal to elaborate on the rest of the (possible) objections. Accordingly, the fact that the remaining objections are not addressed does not indicate that the tribunal intended to reject them implicitly *(R II \u00a7 138).* Against this background, the present Tribunal would advise caution regarding attempts to draw definite conclusions from the afore-mentioned decisions in the one or the other direction.\n\n139.\n\nIn the *Funnekotter and others v. Zimbabwe* case56, however, there were fourteen Dutch investors, and the Tribunal confirmed its jurisdiction without seeing any problem concerning the multitude of claimants involved in this case. The argument that there was no objection on the part of the respondent State in this respect *(R II \u00a7 136)* is of no avail to the Respondent. In fact, after having initially contested the jurisdiction of the Tribunal due to a lack of proof of the claimants\u2019 Dutch nationality, the respondent State subsequently declared that it did not object to the jurisdiction of the Centre.57 Yet, having taken note of the \"current agreement between the parties\" on jurisdiction, the Tribunal considered it nonetheless important, \"[i]n light of the importance of jurisdiction as a foundation for arbitral decisions and the special competence granted to arbitral tribunals to determine their jurisdiction [...] to address [...] the question of jurisdiction\".58 It was only after and on the basis of this *proprio motu* assessment of the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction that the Tribunal concluded that all prerequisites for jurisdiction under the ICSID Convention were met.59 While the *Funnekotter* Tribunal addressed a number of jurisdictional issues on its own initiative, in no way whatsoever was the question of the case having been instituted by a multitude of claimants brought up by the Tribunal as a potential obstacle or challenge to its jurisdiction. Had the Tribunal in the *Funnekotter* case harboured any doubts as to a multi-party proceeding requiring the specific consent on the part of the respondent Government, it would have certainly taken up the issue *sua sponte* and would have actively assured itself that there was jurisdiction to decide the case at hand.\n\n*Bernardus Henricus Funnekotter and others v. Zimbabwe,* ICSID Case No. ARB/05/6, Award, 22 April 2009.\n\nSee *ibid.,* para. 93.\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 94.\n\nSee *ibid.,* paras. 94, 95.\n\n140.\n\nClaimants are also right to point out that in the *LG&E and others v. Argentine Republic* case with its three claimants, the arbitral tribunal merely acknowledged that the \"host State [i.e. Argentina] [...] has already given its consent\"60 by signing the BIT, without any specific investigation into whether Argentina had specifically or separately consented to a multi-party arbitration (C *IV \u00a7 59).*\n\n*LG&E Energy Corp, and others v. Argentina,* ICSID Case No. ARB/02/1, Decision on Objections to Jurisdiction, 30 April 2004, para. 73.\n\n141.\n\nThe Tribunal thus concludes from the review of the pertinent case-law that neither respondent Governments (with the exception of the afore-mentioned *Kl\u00f6ckner and others v. Cameroon* case, and even there only temporarily) nor arbitral tribunals have taken issue so far with the mere fact of a plurality of claimants jointly submitting a claim for arbitration, nor have they required or implied that a specific consent on the part of the respondent Government would be necessary to safeguard jurisdiction to decide the case at hand. In cases involving a plurality of claimants where the arbitral tribunals asserted their jurisdiction, the tribunals did not raise any jurisdictional doubts as to the existence of a multitude of claimants in the proceedings. The Respondent was not able to point to one single case, apart from the present one and its \"sister cases\",61 where the respondent Government, let alone the deciding tribunal, would have considered the mere fact of several claimants instituting arbitral proceedings jointly an obstacle to jurisdiction, unless the respondent Government gives it specific consent to do so. Accordingly, in the present Tribunal\u2019s opinion, it is evident that multi-party arbitration is a generally accepted practice in ICSID arbitration, and in the arbitral practice beyond that, and that the institution of multi-party proceedings therefore does not require any consent on the part of the respondent Government beyond the general requirements of consent to arbitration.\n\nAs to the *Abaclat* and *Alemanni* cases see *supra* paras. 8 and 9.\n\n142.\n\nSixthly, this view is also corroborated by the pertinent literature. Both Parties have referred to Professor Schreuer\u2019s Commentary on the ICSID Convention in this context, but have relied on different editions of it in support of their respective positions. Respondent *(R II \u00a7 133)* cited the first edition for the proposition that multi-party claims in ICSID arbitration should \"ar[i]se from one investment operation\" and that they are \"the consequence of companies claiming jointly with their parent companies or their subsidiaries\" or of \"the assignment, in part, of the investor\u2019s rights to an additional investor.\"62 In contrast, Claimants (C *III \u00a7 78)* cite from the second edition of the Commentary: \"The Convention speaks of \u2018a national of another Contracting State\u2019 in the singular. But, it would be wrong to conclude that only one party may be admitted to ICSID proceedings on the investor\u2019s side.\"63\n\n*C. Schreuer Commentary,* The ICSID Convention: A Commentary, 1st ed., Cambridge 2001, Art. 25, para. 172 (hereinafter *\"Schreuer.* ICSID Convention Commentary, 1st ed.\").\n\n*Schreuer,* ICSID Convention Commentary, Art. 25, para. 277.\n\n143.\n\nThe Tribunal would point out that these two very sentences were already contained in the first edition of the Commentary.64 In a similar vein, the Commentary states in both editions that the case-law \"show[s] that having more than one party on the investor\u2019s side in one set of proceedings is perfectly possible.\"65 Hence, as regards the possibility of multi-party proceedings as such, there is no ambiguity at all in the literature referred to by the Parties, and no requirement for a specific consent on the part of the Respondent can be derived from there. A different question is whether multi-party proceedings in ICSID arbitration presuppose a certain link or relationship between the would-be co-claimants; this question will be addressed below.66\n\n*Schreuer,* ICSID Convention Commentary, 1st ed., Art. 25, para. 170.\n\n*Ibid.,* Art. 25, para. 172; *Schreuer,* ICSID Convention Commentary, Art. 25, para. 279.\n\nSee *infra* paras. 152 *et seq.*\n\n144.\n\nSeventhly, having particular regard to the nature of the claim made in the present proceedings, the Tribunal agrees with the *Abaclat* Tribunal that \"where a BIT covers investments which are susceptible of involving a high number of investors, and where such investments require a collective relief in order to provide effective protection to such investment\"67 - which is the case with bonds, as will be set out in further detail below68 -, this suggests that the authors of the BIT, by the very act of including these into the list of protected investments, were envisaging a high number of potential claimants. The Tribunal cannot see why in constellations involving mass instruments such as bonds several claimants finding themselves in an analogous situation should not be allowed to bring their claims together before one arbitral tribunal. Thus, multi-party proceedings appear to be a particularly typical course of action when the collective nature of the proceedings derives from the nature of the investment made.\n\n*Abaclat* Decision, para. 518; see also *ibid.,* para. 490 as well as *CIV \u00a7 53.*\n\nSee Art. 1 para. 1 of the Argentina-Italy BIT as well as *infra* Chapter IV, in particular paras. 488 *et seq.*\n\n145.\n\nFinally, the Tribunal is aware that the Parties have submitted a series of arguments regarding what would be the best course for the Tribunal to take in terms of efficiency considerations and policy goals underlying the ICSID Convention and the Argentina-Italy BIT. Not surprisingly, the views expressed by the Parties in this respect are conflicting and often diametrically opposed. In this regard, the Tribunal would wish to stress its conviction that the response to the pertinent question - i.e. whether, within the framework of the ICSID Convention, the original submission of multi-party claims requires a specific or additional act of consent on the part of the Respondent beyond the general consent requirement pursuant to Art. 25(1) of the Convention - must be given on the basis of the existing law and by applying the rules of treaty interpretation, as exemplified above.\n\n146.\n\nIn the Tribunal\u2019s view, this interpretatory effort clearly points into one direction. Nothing has emerged from the preceding legal analysis that would militate in favour of interpreting the \"silence\" of the ICSID Convention as standing in the way of instituting multi-party proceedings. Quite the contrary, not only are multi-party arbitrations not excluded by the pertinent provisions of ICSID law, but they are perfectly compatible with them. The analysis of the relevant tribunal practice has not suggested any other outcome. In view of this unambiguous result, the Tribunal sees no benefit in engaging in a policy or efficiency reasoning of any kind, but concludes that the ICSID Convention, the Argentina-Italy BIT and other applicable rules in the present dispute are not opposed to a plurality of claimants jointly submitting a claim to the Centre. In particular, these provisions do not require a specific or additional consent on the part of the Respondent beyond the prerequisite of written consent under Art. 25(1) of the ICSID Convention.\n\n***b) Scope of the Parties\u2019 consent to multi-party proceedings***\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n147.\n\nHaving reached the conclusion that multi-party proceedings are in harmony with the ICSID framework, the question remains whether this applies to all multi-party proceedings or whether there exists a limit to the consent the Contracting Parties have given in this respect.\n\n**(1) The question of a maximum number of Claimants**\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n148.\n\nOne issue raised by Respondent in this respect is that of a possible maximum number of claimants in a multi-party proceeding. Professor Schreuer has been cited by the Claimants in support of the proposition that no such limit exists: \"Once the principle of multipartite arbitration is accepted, no question should arise by virtue only of the number of co-claimants.\"69 Whatever the merit of this statement, which was made with express reference to the *Abaclat* case, the Tribunal has already emphasized that the present dispute differs a lot from *Abaclat* in terms of the amount of Claimants involved.70\n\n*Schreuer,* ICSID Convention Commentary, Art. 25, para. 281.\n\nSee *supra* para. 120.\n\n149.\n\nIn addition, the Tribunal has referred to a number of arbitrations, inside and outside the ICSID framework, which dealt with a comparable or even higher number of claimants71 than in the present case, and in none of these have any of the deciding tribunals, nor the respective respondents, taken issue with several or several dozens of claimants having instituted arbitral proceedings. In particular, the present Tribunal is not convinced by the Respondent\u2019s argument that the number of 14 claimants in the *Funnekotter and others v. Zimbabwe* case is \"substantially different\" *(R II \u00a7 136)* from that in the present one. The Request was brought by 119 individual Claimants, and meanwhile 29 have withdrawn from the proceedings so that the present number of Claimants amounts to 90.72\n\nSee *supra* paras. 135 *et seq.*\n\nSee *infra* paras. 333 *et seq.*\n\n150.\n\nThe Tribunal can therefore not see in what way the present dispute when compared to the *Funnekotter* case could be deemed not only as a *plus* but an *aliud.* As the *Abaclat* Decision convincingly pointed out, it is difficult to conceive why and how an ICSID tribunal could \"lose\" jurisdiction when the number of claimants rises beyond a certain threshold.73 If it is possible under the ICSID Convention to have multi-party proceedings with three, five or ten claimants, it is hard to accept the proposition that there is a certain limitation to the number of claimants which cannot be exceeded without jurisdiction being eliminated or forfeited.\n\n*Abaclat* Decision, para. 490, first indent\n\n151.\n\nThe only argument to be raised in this context which has, in the Tribunal\u2019s eyes, its merit and thus deserves some attention is that of the manageability of the proceedings and the respect of due process vis-\u00e0-vis the Parties - even though there is, as will be seen, nothing to be gained for the Respondent from that argument under the circumstances of the present case. The Tribunal will come back to this issue shortly.74\n\nSee *infra* paras. 164 *et seq.*\n\n**(2) The question of the need of a link between the claims in dispute**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n152.\n\nThe Respondent further submits that, even if multi-party proceedings were admitted, these would always have to relate to claimants being \"intimately linked in some concrete way\" *(R II \u00a7 103).* Yet, in the eyes of the Respondent, the present dispute brings together contractually unrelated persons *(RI\u00a7 104).* Accordingly, for the Respondent the fact that the link between the Claimants is the invocation of the same BIT does not suffice to combine the claims of several persons. Otherwise, all claims invoking the same BIT brought before ICSID against a country could be brought to the fore together *(R III \u00a7\u00a7 19, 21; Tr p. 369/15).* While Claimants insist that the only requirement for setting in motion of ICSID proceedings, including those with a multiplicity of claimants, is that all of them must have given their consent in writing *(C I \u00a7 173),* they seem prepared, to a certain extent, to concede that there \"ought to be a reasonable and significant link\" between the claims of the persons seeking to bring a multi-party action and that it would therefore \"not be possible to adjudicate in the same arbitration claims that are totally unrelated\" (C *I \u00a7 177).* In addition, in the Hearing on Jurisdiction, Claimants stated that \"[i]t is clear that there has to be some reasonable link regarding what is claimed\" *(Tr p. 473/15).*\n\n153.\n\nThe Tribunal would indeed have its doubts whether completely unrelated claims could be brought by a plurality of persons in one and the same arbitral proceeding. It deserves mention that most domestic legal systems providing for multi-party proceedings require a certain link to exist between the claims in order to be brought jointly in one single claim. The Tribunal would, however, caution against importing domestic law standards in this respect and would recall, once again, that the decision on jurisdiction within the ICSID framework is a question to be answered on the basis of international law.75 Against that background, Claimants are right to emphasize that whatever prerequisites Art. 88 of the Argentine Code of Civil and Commercial Procedure may set forth for the lawful institution of a multi-party action under Argentine domestic law, this can be of no relevance to the answer to be given to the question here.76\n\nSee *supra* para. 134 as well as in more detail *infra* paras. 233 *et seq.*\n\n*C III \u00a7 85; Tr pp. 221/5, 474 6.* referring to the Opinion of Professor Jorge Kielmanovich, 26 February 2010 in this regard; see already *supra* note 38.\n\n154.\n\nWhatever minimum standard may apply under Art. 25 of the ICSID Convention as to a necessary link between the claims in a multi-party proceeding, and whether such requirement exists at all, can be left open by the present Tribunal. In particular, it does not consider it necessary or useful to elaborate on the question *in abstracto* whether it is required that the claims be \"homogeneous\" or whether it suffices that they are \"sufficiently comparable\", etc. and to try to devise a general standard or threshold in that regard.\n\n155.\n\nIn order to tackle the issues at stake, the Tribunal would first state that it cannot see that a requirement would exist under the ICSID Convention, or could be deduced from it, that the claimants in a multi-party proceeding must be necessarily connected by a contractual link among themselves. Respondent draws upon the first edition of Professor Schreuer\u2019s Commentary on the ICSID Convention in support of its contention that multi-party arbitrations can only be validly instituted by closely related investors such as shareholders of the same company or companies jointly with their parent or subsidiary companies *(R I \u00a7 105; R II \u00a7 133)77* The Tribunal takes note of the Claimants\u2019 submission that this citation does not appear any more in the Commentary\u2019s second edition (C *I \u00a7 172).* It will not, however, draw any particular conclusion from this fact, neither in the sense of identifying this as a change of opinion and thus as an \"obvious recognition that the circumstances which justify the bringing of a plurality of claims within one and the same proceedings can vary greatly\" *(C I \u00a7 172)* nor in the sense of associating it with Professor Schreuer\u2019s purported engagement for the claimants in the *Abaclat* case, as suggested by the Respondent *(R II \u00a7 134; Tr p. 363/4).*\n\nSee *Schreuer,* ICSID Convention Commentary, 1st ed., Art. 25, para. 172: \"Each of the[] [mentioned] cases [of multi-party arbitrations] arose from one investment operation.\" These were cases where the multi-party character was \"the consequence of companies claiming jointly with their parent companies or their subsidiaries\" or of \"the assignment, in part, of the investor\u2019s rights to an additional investor.\"\n\n156.\n\nThe Tribunal rather considers that, irrespective of this, there is no indication that the ICSID Convention and Arbitration Rules or the Argentina-Italy BIT give rise to any specific requirement in that regard or that the pertinent arbitral practice has seen an obstacle in the institution of multi-party proceedings by contractually unrelated claimants with similar claims. While in the *Bayview and others v. Mexico* case78 46 unrelated claimants instituted ICSID proceedings and had only in common the fact that they all contended to have been harmed by the same allegedly unlawful acts of the respondent State, the present Tribunal prefers not to rely on this case since the Tribunal declared itself lacking in jurisdiction. It was already pointed out that the conclusions to be drawn from such case-law are only of limited value for the purposes of the discussion here.79\n\n*Bayview Irrigation District and others v. Mexico,* ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/05/l, Award, 19 June 2007.\n\nSee *supra* para. 138.\n\n157.\n\nHowever, in the *Goetz and others v. Burundi* case, six natural persons of Belgian nationality who were shareholders of a Burundian company had brought a joint claim and the ICSID Tribunal upheld its jurisdiction.80 While the present Tribunal agrees with the Respondent *(R II \u00a7 137)* that Burundi in that case did not only fail to raise objections to jurisdiction, but also failed to answer the claimants\u2019 memorial, and the arbitration proceeded therefore in default pursuant to Arbitration Rule 42 para. 381, the Tribunal considers that it cannot agree with the Respondent as to the conclusions to be drawn from that state of affairs. The Tribunal in the *Goetz* case was well aware that it was called upon to assure itself whether there was jurisdiction in the dispute in question, even more so in cases of default where the respondent State is not present to defend its rights. The *Goetz* Tribunal thus expressly referred82 to Arbitration Rule 42 para. 4, also part of Rule 42 on \"Default\", according to which \"[t]he Tribunal shall examine the jurisdiction of the Centre and its own competence in the dispute, and, *if it is satisfied,* decide whether the submissions are well-founded in fact and in law\" (emphasis added). Accordingly, if the Tribunal had had doubts as to the lack of a sufficient link between the claimants as an obstacle to its jurisdiction, it would have had to bring them up. However, nothing of that kind occurred, and the Tribunal confirmed that it had competence *ratione materiae* and *ratione personae* to decide the case.83\n\n*Antoine Goetz and others v. Burundi,* ICSID Case No. ARB/95/3, Award, 10 February 1999, para. 89.\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 44.\n\n*Ibid.*, para. 79.\n\n*Ibid.*, para. 85.\n\n158.\n\nThis result is corroborated by the *Funnekotter and others v. Zimbabwe* case84 which was instituted by fourteen Dutch nationals who directly or indirectly owned different large commercial farms in Zimbabwe. Claimants contended in that regard that \"[t]he only existing link between the individual claimants and their respective claims was that all of them had suffered the same harm by virtue of the measures adopted by the host State, which deprived each one of them of its investment without a just compensation\" (C *I \u00a7 180).* It was already mentioned above85 that, in spite of the respondent State\u2019s eventual acceptance of the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction, the latter addressed the question of jurisdiction *proprio motu* and confirmed that all prerequisites for jurisdiction under the ICSID Convention were met.86 While the *Funnekotter* Tribunal thus actively assured itself of its jurisdiction, in no way whatsoever was the issue of the claimants having no contractual relation between themselves or of their jointly brought claims not being sufficiently linked to each other addressed by the Tribunal. Against this background, the present Tribunal is therefore not convinced by the Respondent\u2019s attempt to distinguish the *Funnekotter* case by (correctly) stating that the respondent State did not object to the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction *(R II \u00a7 136).* The silence of the Tribunal carries more weight, in this case, than that of the respondent State.\n\n*Bernardus Henricus Funnekotter and others v. Zimbabwe,* ICSID Case No. ARB/05/6, Award, 22 April 2009.\n\nSee *supra* para. 139.\n\nSee the afore-mentioned *Funnekotter* case, para. 94.\n\n159.\n\nFinally, the Tribunal finds it useful to turn to the *Abaclat* case. Even though the *Abaclat* Tribunal makes the following statement in the context of justifying the need for procedural adaptations in mass claims cases (which is a question different from that which the present Tribunal is dealing with here), the Tribunal would nonetheless endorse the argument in order to underscore that a requirement of a contractual link between claimants seeking to institute joint proceedings cannot be derived from the ICSID legal framework.\n\n[...] [I]t is important to recall that the present proceedings concern only potential treaty claims and do not deal with any contractual claims Claimants may have against Argentina [...]. Thus, the identity or homogeneity requirement applies to the investment and the rights and obligations deriving therefrom based on the BIT and not to any potential contractual claims. In other words, in the present case, it is irrelevant whether Claimants have or do not have homogeneous contractual rights to repayment by Argentina of the amount paid for the purchase of the security entitlements. The only relevant question is whether Claimants have homogeneous rights of compensation for a homogeneous damage caused to them by potential homogeneous breaches by Argentina of homogeneous obligations provided for in the BIT.87\n\n*Abaclat* Decision, para. 541.\n\n160.\n\nOn the basis of this distinction, the *Abaclat* Decision, in para. 542, concludes that the \"specific circumstances surrounding individual purchases by Claimants of security entitlement are irrelevant\".\n\n161.\n\nOn that basis, the present Tribunal considers that Claimants are correct in arguing that the necessary link among them exists in terms of the *treaty claim* they jointly submit in the present arbitration. Thus, they are right to point out that they complain about the same illegality which the Respondent is said to have committed against them all. They base their claim on the same provisions of the Argentina-Italy BIT as well as the ICSID Convention and they have made identical prayers of relief, i.e. indemnification under the BIT for the acts allegedly committed by the Respondent.88 In addition, they claim that the factual background on the basis of which the Claimants seek to establish their claim is virtually the same for all Claimants.\n\nSee *Request \u00a7 91* as well as *supra* para. 63.\n\n162.\n\nIn contrast, the fact - which Respondent has highlighted repeatedly and intensively - that there are certain differences between the Claimants as to the dates and the series of bonds under which the different security entitlements were acquired, or regarding the currency or interest rate which would apply to them, etc., are not relevant here since they relate to the *contractual* claims the Claimants may have, but not to the *treaty* claims with which the Tribunal is dealing here.89 In so far as they may become relevant to establish the quantum of claim for each individual Claimant, they will have to be examined in the following procedure on the merits of this case.\n\nAs to this aspect see also *infra* para. 543.\n\n163.\n\nHence, Respondent has not convinced the Tribunal that the claims in question would raise any relevant doubt as regards their ability to be treated, and decided upon, by the present Tribunal in one single multi-party arbitration. Under the circumstances of the present case, the Tribunal is therefore not able to conclude, as suggested by the Respondent, that its competence to decide the case would be called into question due to a presumed lack of the necessary link between the claims brought j ointly in the dispute at stake here.\n\n**3. Due process and manageability concerns**\n---------------------------------------------\n\n164.\n\nInasmuch as Respondent\u2019s statement that the \"claims are not even suited for collective treatment\" intends to suggest that it would not be possible for a tribunal operating on the basis of the ICSID Convention to adjudicate a dispute such as the present one effectively and fairly, the Tribunal is not able to accept this argument.\n\n165.\n\nAs has already been stated, this is not a mass claim case.90 Such a specific procedural device, as Respondent has consistently and correctly pointed out, does not exist within the ICSID regime. However, the absence of a specific mass claim regime in ICSID does not at all prevent the Tribunal from dealing with the present dispute as what it is, i.e. a multi-party proceeding including 119 or 90 Claimants respectively, which is governed by the procedural provisions of the ICSID Convention and Rules and other applicable norms of international law.\n\nSee *supra* paras. 119, 120.\n\n166.\n\nThe Tribunal does not consider that the mere number of Claimants in the present case would make the proceedings \"unmanageable\", as the Respondent has suggested, or would violate fundamental principles of due process or would be unfair to the Respondent, neither in the present jurisdictional phase nor in the merits phase of the proceedings.\n\n167.\n\nIn the First Session, the Parties have agreed that the \"preliminary phase would deal with preliminary objections of a general character only, but not with any jurisdictional issues that may arise in relation to individual claimants, which would be dealt with at a later stage as necessary and appropriate\".91 Given this fact, the criticism on the part of the Respondent that the impossibility to look at the specific circumstances of each single Claimant already in the jurisdictional phase would entail a limitation of Argentina\u2019s defense rights *(R II \u00a7 149; R IVp. 11; R Vp. 6)* cannot be upheld by the Tribunal. Accordingly, in this preliminary phase of the proceedings, the Tribunal has to restrict itself to a general assessment whether there is jurisdiction to decide the dispute in question. The fact that there are several dozens of Claimants involved in these proceedings has no impact at all on the assessment to be made by the Tribunal at this stage of the proceedings.\n\nSee Minutes of the First Session, point 14; *supra* para. 5.\n\n168.\n\nBut even in the subsequent merits phase of the proceedings, the Tribunal cannot see a fundamental problem in taking evidence regarding, and assessing, the individual case of each and every of the 90 Claimants remaining in the case. Whether it is necessary and appropriate to call every single Claimant into the witness stand and cross-examine them there in order to safeguard the fundamental principles of due process, as Respondent seems to suggest *(RI \u00a7 109; R II \u00a7 148; R III \u00a7 35),* is to be decided at the appropriate time on the basis of the relevant facts and according to the applicable rules of law. The Tribunal does not take a stand on this question at this moment.\n\n169.\n\nThe Tribunal is in full agreement with the Respondent that, in the adjudication of the present dispute, it is fully bound by Art. 44 of the ICSID Convention and Arbitration Rule 19, and the Tribunal will be fully mindful of this legal framework when discharging its duty to control and direct the unfolding of the proceedings through procedural orders. In view of the circumstances of the present case, notably the considerable but nonetheless limited number of Claimants, the Tribunal would not consider that the specific controversy regarding the scope of an ICSID tribunal\u2019s power to devise \"necessary adaptations\" to the ICSID standard procedure which arose in the context of the *Abaclat* case92 and to which the Parties have referred (C *III \u00a7 88; R III \u00a7 26; RIVpp. 10, 11; Tr p. 224/1* 7), would be relevant to the present case.\n\nSee *Abaclat* Decision, paras. 529 *et seq.* ; see in this regard also the Dissenting Opinion of Professor Abi-Saab, paras. 194 *et seq.*\n\n170.\n\nIn particular, the Tribunal cannot see in which manner the obvious right of both Parties to the proceedings being conducted according to the principles of fairness and due process would be encroached upon or what defense right of the Respondent might be curtailed or otherwise negatively affected by the mere fact of the Tribunal admitting that 119 or 90 Claimants, respectively, may institute multi-party proceedings under Art. 25 of the ICSID Convention.\n\n171.\n\nAs the Tribunal already found that the present case is neither a class action nor a mass claim case93, the due process and fairness concerns raised by the Respondent regarding the representation of the Claimants are moot, and the Tribunal will therefore not address them in any detail.\n\nSee *supra* paras. 114 *et seq.*\n\n172.\n\nSimilarly, the Tribunal does not need to take a stand regarding Claimants\u2019 submission that the decision to institute one single proceeding for all Claimants jointly is the most efficient course of action because it avoids parallel proceedings, reduces costs, eliminates the risk of inconsistent decisions and even makes the Respondent\u2019s defense less complicated and costly. Whatever the truth of these considerations, they could not lead the Tribunal to approve the conduct of multi-party proceedings under the ICSID Convention if this were not permitted under the legal framework of ICSID as a matter of law. Conversely, as the Tribunal has concluded that the ICSID Convention is perfectly compatible with a plurality of Claimants jointly bringing claims in an ICSID arbitration, those policy considerations do not add to answering the question that the Tribunal has to address in the present preliminary phase of the proceedings.\n\n**II. CONSENT OF THE CLAIMANTS**\n--------------------------------\n\n**A. Positions of the Parties**\n-------------------------------\n\n**1. Contentions by Respondent**\n--------------------------------\n\n173.\n\nRespondent submits that Claimants\u2019 purported consent to ICSID jurisdiction does not constitute \"consent in writing\" in the meaning of Art. 25(1) of the ICSID Convention and falls outside Argentina\u2019s offer to arbitrate in Art. 8 para. 3 of the Argentina-Italy BIT *(R I \u00a7 114; R III \u00a7 40).* Argentina criticizes the Claimants for not paying sufficient regard to questions of form and emphasizes that formalities are necessary to preserve due process and the legality of arbitral proceedings *(Tr p. 76/11).*\n\n***a) Lack of the signature of Claimants themselves***\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n174.\n\nRespondent emphasizes that the Request was not signed by Claimants *manu propria (R I \u00a7 116)* even though they allege, in the Request itself, to have submitted the dispute to ICSID jurisdiction by \"signing\" and filing the Request, and even though the NASAM Mandate provides that the Claimants themselves shall sign the Request to express their consent *(RI \u00a7 120; R II \u00a7 164; R III \u00a7\u00a7 66-68).* Moreover, it was even made conditional upon each Claimant to sign the Request in Mr. Parodi\u2019s office for the NASAM Mandate to become effective *(RIII \u00a7\u00a7 42-45; Tr pp. 79/11, 348/19).*\n\n175.\n\nAs this did not happen, Respondent argues that the Claimants did not consent to ICSID jurisdiction in the announced manner and, more importantly, the NASAM Mandate never came into effect *(Tr p. 80/8).* Furthermore, if the NASAM Mandate instructed the Claimants that they were expected to sign the Request and they did not do so, they could reasonably have understood that they would have further opportunity to decide whether to consent to any particular arbitration. Thus, the alleged consent is not perfect. It was expected to be completed with the signature of the Request and this has not been done *(R II \u00a7 167; Trp. 83/2).*\n\n***b) Lack of consent for ICSID arbitration in the Power of Attorney***\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n176.\n\nIn addition, regarding the Request\u2019s signing by Claimants\u2019 counsel, Respondent contends that nowhere in the *Procura sp\u00e9ciale (Special Power of Attorney)* which the Claimants supposedly signed in favour of Avv. Piero Giuseppe Parodi (hereinafter: \"Power of Attorney\") did Claimants consent in writing to the Centre\u2019s jurisdiction nor did they authorize their counsel to do so on their behalf. The Power of Attorney mentioned neither the Centre nor the Argentina-Italy BIT *(RI \u00a7 117; RII \u00a7 165; R III \u00a7 71; Tr p. 89/6).*\n\n177.\n\nIn particular, one passage in the Power of Attorney refers to the signing of \"Terms of Reference\" (in capital letters). However, these are a specific feature of ICC arbitration and thus a type of arbitration completely different from ICSID arbitration. In a similar vein, insofar as the Power of Attorney contains a reference to \"whatever arbitration of whatever Country of the World\", this is clearly inconsistent with the nature and characteristics of ICSID arbitration *(RIII \u00a7\u00a7 72, 73; Tr p. 92/4).*\n\n178.\n\nAs far as the references to ICSID in the NASAM Mandate are concerned, Respondent contends that they only contain information that NASAM provided to the Claimants, not an expression of will and consent coming from them *(R I \u00a7 119; R III \u00a7\u00a7 77-80; Tr pp. 86/19, 347/10).* Furthermore, there is no evidence that any Claimant actually paid the initial contribution to expenses to NASAM with the express reference to \"Arbitrato ICSID\" *(RII\u00a7 166).*\n\n***c) Purported legal defects of the Power of Attorney and the NASAM Mandate***\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n179.\n\nAssuming *arguendo* that the Power of Attorney and/or the NASAM Mandate contained Claimants\u2019 consent in writing, Respondent further submits that this consent would be invalid because these documents violate formal and substantive requirements of Italian law *(R I \u00a7 123).* This is relevant because both the NASAM Mandate and the Power of Attorney are governed by Italian law *(R I \u00a7 124).* Contrary to Claimants\u2019 submission, in the eyes of the Respondent, the reference to the *AMTO v. Ukraine* case is misplaced, since it was decided under the Energy Charter Treaty which directs the Tribunal to decide the case in accordance with international law. In contrast, Art. 42 of the ICSID Convention as well as Art. 8 (7) of the Argentina-Italy BIT require the Tribunal to decide on the basis of the laws of the Contracting Party involved in the dispute - including its rules on the conflict of laws - as well as applicable international law. In Respondent\u2019s view, in the present case Argentine law on the conflict of laws would point to the application of Italian law so that compliance of the Power of Attorney and the NASAM Mandate with the formal and substantive requirements of Italian and international law is highly relevant *(RII\u00a7 171).*\n\n**(1) Purported legal defects of the Power of Attorney**\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n180.\n\nAs regards the Power of Attorney, under Art. 83 of the Italian Code of Civil Procedure, the power of attorney enabling an attorney to represent a party in judicial proceedings must be granted before a notary public or, alternatively, the signature must be authenticated by the attorney. Since this did not happen in the present case, the respective Powers of Attorney do not comply with the requirements of Italian law and do therefore not provide a basis for consent *(RI \u00a7\u00a7 127, 128).*\n\n181.\n\nFurthermore, Respondent submits that the lawyer in whose favour the Power of Attorney was issued, i.e. Mr. Parodi, failed to sign the Request. The sole person who signed is Mr. Radicati di Brozolo. Mr. Parodi did not sign any of the Claimants\u2019 submissions nor did he take part in the First Session held by the Tribunal on 24 February 2009 *(Trp. 329/21).* Mr. Parodi is the only person empowered by the Claimants to represent them, but Argentina has not been able to meet him *(Tr p. 329/12)* because he consistently failed to show up *(Tr p. 330/16).* Argentina asserts that the unjustified non-appearance of the main Counsel before the Tribunal is unprecedented *(Tr p. 340/1; RIII \u00a7 40).*\n\n182.\n\nThe only link between Mr. Parodi and Mr. Radicati di Brozolo as acting Counsel emerged for the first time on the third day of the Hearing on Jurisdiction through a letter of questionable probative value *(R III \u00a7 40; Tr p. 335/10).* Respondent submits that it is not prepared to accept the letter allegedly written by Mr. Parodi which was provided to the Tribunal only as a photocopy *(Tr p. 335/16).* Furthermore, Respondent contends that because only Mr. Radicati di Brozolo signed the Request, the Claimants would have needed to attach the letter at that time to show that Mr. Radicati di Brozolo had been authorized to represent Claimants *(Tr p. 336/10).* As the date of signature on this letter is not authenticated, Respondent alleges that it is unproven that Mr. Radicati acted as authorized co-counsel when he signed the Request *(Tr p. 336/18).* Hence, Respondent contends that Mr. Radicati di Brozolo lacks the capacity to represent the Claimants *(Tr pp. 328/19, 336/2).*\n\n**(2) Purported legal defects of the NASAM Mandate negatively affecting the Power of Attorney**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n183.\n\nMoreover, in the Respondent\u2019s submission, also the NASAM Mandate fails to meet substantive requirements of Italian law *(R I \u00a7 129),* and this in a twofold sense. First, Italian law is violated because NASAM is given full control over Claimants\u2019 claims in the arbitration, transferring to NASAM all the powers a client should have and be able to exercise in an attorney-client relationship. NASAM is set up as the exclusive representative of the Claimants and as a filter of all communications between Claimants and their attorneys. This violation of the right of defense is a breach of norms of public law and thus renders the NASAM Mandate void under Art. 1418 of the Italian Civil Code *(RI \u00a7\u00a7 130, 132; RII \u00a7 188).*\n\n184.\n\nSecond, NASAM does not fulfill the requirements set forth by Italian law in order to pursue a claim on behalf of third parties. Pursuant to Art. 77 of the Italian Code of Civil Procedure, representation of another individual or entity in court is only allowed if the third person has the power to dispose of the legal relationship at stake or the capacity of being the general representative of such person or entity. Neither of the two is the case regarding NASAM *(RI\u00a7\u00a7 130, 134, 135).*\n\n185.\n\nRegarding the purported legal defects of the NASAM Mandate, Respondent submits that the NASAM Mandate and the Power of Attorney are linked to each other, designed together and structured to achieve a common purpose. In that regard, Claimants contradict themselves when they submit, on the one hand, that the NASAM Mandate and the Power of Attorney are separate and unrelated instruments but contend, on the other hand, that the NASAM Mandate is relevant for the interpretation of the intention of the Claimants in granting the Power of Attorney *(RIII \u00a7\u00a7 53, 54; Tr p. 84/18).* Under Italian law, when legal documents demonstrate a practical common intent of the parties to be interdependent, those documents are legally connected and in Italian legal terminology characterized as *negozi collegati.* As a consequence, the deficiencies of the one necessarily affect the other, i.e. if one of the components is invalid also the other must be deemed invalid. In Respondent\u2019s opinion, this is the case regarding the NASAM Mandate whose illegality affects the Power of Attorney and *vice versa (R I \u00a7\u00a7 125, 126; R II \u00a7 179).*\n\n**(3) The nature of NASAM\u2019s funding arrangement**\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n186.\n\nAccording to Respondent\u2019s submission, the problem is not NASAM\u2019s funding arrangement as such, but rather the fact that genuine third-party funding deals with the provision of funds by individuals and companies having no other connection with the litigation. NASAM does not fall in this definition, however, as its control goes as far as making NASAM a real party in interest in the present case *(R II \u00a7 195).* In particular, Respondent alleges that NASAM was the driving force behind the decision to initiate the present arbitration. The lawyers were selected by NASAM and it was NASAM who instructed Claimants\u2019 lawyers accordingly *(R I \u00a7 73; R II \u00a7\u00a7 178, 192).* Furthermore, Respondent submits that NASAM has full control over the present arbitration and that it is its sole beneficiary *(R I \u00a7 264).* According to the Respondent, the NASAM Mandate therefore creates an impermissible barrier between Claimants and their lawyers *(R II \u00a7 191).*\n\n**2. Contentions by Claimants**\n-------------------------------\n\n187.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, it is commonly admitted that their consent in writing, as required by Art. 25(1) of the ICSID Convention, can be manifested by filing a request for arbitration to ICISD. They thus declare that \"[f]or these purposes, the Claimants hereby accept to submit the dispute to ICSID arbitration by signing and filing this Request for Arbitration\" *(Request \u00a7 84).* Regarding Respondent\u2019s contention that the Claimants have not validly consented to ICSID jurisdiction, the latter offer a series of counter-arguments.\n\n***a) Lack of the signature of Claimants themselves***\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n188.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, the fact that they did not sign the Request *manu propria* does not call into question the existence of Claimants\u2019 consent in writing in the meaning of Art. 25(1) of the ICSID Convention. First, it is generally recognized that an investor may accept an offer for ICSID arbitration contained in a BIT simply by starting ICSID proceedings and the large majority of ICSID proceedings in recent years are based on consent established in this way *(C I \u00a7 140).* In addition, neither the Argentina-Italy BIT nor the ICSID Convention require a particular form for the expression of written consent by the investor *(C I \u00a7 142).* Moreover, it is common ICSID practice that requests for arbitration are signed by duly authorized counsel and not by the parties themselves. ICSID tribunals have never questioned that this way of expressing consent satisfies the requirement of \"consent in writing\" under Art. 25(1) of the ICSID Convention *(C I \u00a7 149; CIII \u00a756).*\n\n189.\n\nFurthermore, Claimants submit that while the NASAM Mandate provided for signing of the Request by each Claimant, when Counsel was appointed NASAM was made aware that the signing of the Request by each Claimant was not required by the ICSID Rules and that Counsel\u2019s signature sufficed to express the Claimants\u2019 consent. Therefore, NASAM decided to dispense the Claimants (most of whom are very elderly) from a burdensome and useless journey to Milan, informing all Claimants accordingly (C *III \u00a7 66; Tr p. 491/2).* Since NASAM was the entity prescribing the actions the Claimants were to carry out, it also had the power to dispense them from carrying out some of those actions. Thus, the lack of Claimants\u2019 signature did not and could not affect the validity of the consent to the present arbitration (C *III \u00a7 67).*\n\n***b) Lack of consent for ICSID arbitration in the Power of Attorney***\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n190.\n\nClaimants insist that the filing of the Request on their behalf through their duly appointed Counsel is the unequivocal manifestation of their consent to ICSID arbitration (C *I \u00a7\u00a7 144, 147).* The Powers of Attorney authorize Counsel \"to communicate any notice dispute in my/our name and on my/our behalf\u2019 and \"to sign and forward any request of arbitration [...] and to make any other request to the Arbitral Tribunal and/or to any other competent Court of Authority of whatever Country in the world\"94 and, according to the Claimants, this reference unquestionably includes ICSID. In addition, the Power of Attorney must be read in conjunction with the NASAM Mandate which expressly refers to ICSID *(CI \u00a7 145; CII \u00a7 12)95* Although the relationship between the Claimants and Counsel is governed exclusively by the Power of Attorney, the NASAM Mandate is relevant for the interpretation of the intention of the Claimants in granting the Power of Attorney and therefore also of the content of the powers granted to Counsel (C *II \u00a7 13; Tr p. 170/1).*\n\nPower of Attorney, p. 2.\n\nSee NASAM Mandate, Preamble, lit. H, O and P, pp. 2, 5 and 6.\n\n191.\n\nMoreover, when Claimants made their initial contribution to expenses to NASAM, they did so with the express reference to \"Arbitrato ICSID\"96 which proves that they intended to bring ICSID proceedings *(C I \u00a7 146; Tr p. 171/11).* It is further contended that the Claimants actually made reference to \"ICSID arbitration\" when making their payments and that documents to that effect were produced (C *II \u00a7\u00a7 14, 15,* referring to Annexes CA 49 and CA 50).\n\n*Ibid.,* Preamble, lit. P, p. 6.\n\n***c) Purported legal defects of the Power of Attorney***\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n192.\n\nClaimants uphold the validity of the Power of Attorney and thus refute Respondent\u2019s arguments that (1) the Power of Attorney as such is illegal and that (2) the NASAM Mandate is null and void which, due to the legal relation between the two documents, would adversely affect the Power of Attorney.\n\n**(1) Purported legal defects of the Power of Attorney**\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n193.\n\nIn Claimants\u2019 opinion, Respondent\u2019s reliance on Art. 83 of the Italian Code of Civil Procedure is misplaced since this provision only applies to proceedings before Italian courts and not to arbitration, let alone to arbitration not governed by Italian law (C *I \u00a7 125; Tr p. 175/13).* Already under Italian law, a power of attorney issued in connection with arbitration proceedings is therefore valid irrespective of the nature of the act whereby it is granted, e.g. private or public, oral or written. No specific formal requirements have to be met *(CI \u00a7 128; CII \u00a7 34).*\n\n194.\n\nMoreover, Claimants insist that Italian law is not applicable to establishing the requirements of a power of attorney issued in the context of an arbitration governed by international law such as ICSID arbitration *(CI \u00a7 129; CII \u00a7 32).* In order to decide on jurisdiction, ICSID tribunals are called to apply only the self-standing provisions of Art. 25 of the ICSID Convention as has been clearly held in the *AMTO v. Ukraine* case (C *I \u00a7\u00a7 130-132; C II \u00a7 32).* Claimants are aware that Respondent seeks to distinguish this case which was decided on the basis of the Energy Charter Treaty from the present one inasmuch as Art. 42 of the ICSID Convention in combination with Art. 8 para. 7 of the Argentina-Italy BIT would lead to the application of Italian law. Claimants counter that Art. 42 of the ICSID Convention only addresses issues of substantive law, but not of procedural law and certainly does not determine the law applicable to the determination of the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction under Art. 25 of the ICSID Convention (C *II \u00a7 33; Tr p. 174/3).*\n\n195.\n\nNeither the Argentina-Italy BIT nor the ICSID Convention contains any specific provision as to formal requirements needed for a power of attorney to be valid. The only provisions expressly addressing representation of the parties are Arbitration Rule 1 pursuant to which the Request \"shall be signed by the requesting party or its duly appointed representative\" as well as Arbitration Rule 18 providing that \"each party may be represented or assisted by agents, counsel or advocates [...]\". No formal or other particular requirement is established by the Arbitration Rules *(CI \u00a7 131; CII \u00a7 16).*\n\n196.\n\nAs to Respondent\u2019s objection to the manner of Claimants\u2019 representation, they submitted that, while it is true that the Request was only signed by Mr. Radicati di Brozolo, the Power of Attorney given to Mr. Parodi authorized him to engage other counsel in the defense of the present case (C *III \u00a7 7; Tr p. 333/2).* At the Hearing on Jurisdiction, a letter of 3 June 2008 by Mr. Parodi to Mr. Radicati di Brozolo and Mr. Barra was submitted appointing the latter two as co-counsel and conferring upon them all powers to represent the Claimants and to defend them jointly and severally *(Tr pp. 334/4, 449/18).* Mr. Radicati di Brozolo pointed out that he was in direct contact with Mr. Parodi who is in control of the proceedings *(Tr p. 450/16).* In any event, it is contended that Mr. Parodi\u2019s signature on the post-hearing brief marks his formal ratification of all Claimants\u2019 written and oral submissions in the arbitration (C *III \u00a7 8).*\n\n197.\n\nClaimants further submit that the reason why the written submissions were signed with \"p.p.\" (i.e. \"per procurationem\") on behalf of Mr. Parodi was that those submissions went off in the middle of the night, and Mr. Parodi was not there physically to sign them (C *III \u00a7 11; Tr p. 338/21).* In addition, Claimants contend that it is standard practice in Italy, including before Italian courts, that one of the lawyers, be it the lead lawyer or one of the co-counsels, signs \"anche per i colleghi\", i.e. \"also for the colleagues\" *(Tr p. 451/6).* It is further common in international arbitrations that English and American firms sign with the name of the firm, e.g. \"Clifford Chance\" or the like, and nobody has ever seriously contested the fact that there is an appropriate power of attorney *(Tr p. 454/4).*\n\n**(2) Purported legal defects of the NASAM Mandate negatively affecting the Power of Attorney**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n198.\n\nWhile agreeing with the Respondent that the NASAM Mandate is a contract governed by Italian law *(C I \u00a7 92),* the Claimants refute, first, Respondent\u2019s argument that the NASAM Mandate is null and void. Even if it were so, they deny, secondly, that there is a legal connection between the NASAM Mandate and the Power of Attorney that would make the latter null and void *(CI \u00a7 94).*\n\n199.\n\nAs regards the first element, Claimants argue that the NASAM Mandate does not give NASAM complete control over the Claimants\u2019 claims in arbitration, as alleged by the Respondent (C *I \u00a7\u00a7 97-100).* The relationship between Claimants and their Counsel is governed only by the Power of Attorney signed by each individual Claimant, which leaves Claimants in full control of the relationship with Counsel. The Mandate does not confer on NASAM any power to instruct Counsel for the Claimants *(CI \u00a7 101).*\n\n200.\n\nMoreover, Claimants contend that Respondent\u2019s references to Italian law are totally unavailing since they do not relate to arbitration but to judicial proceedings before Italian courts. In particular, none of the restrictions and guarantees referred to by the Respondent that apply to the attorney-client relationship in judicial proceedings are pertinent in arbitral proceedings, including the right to delegate any third party to dispose of the main party\u2019s substantive rights (C *105-108; C II \u00a7 44).* Finally, even if such provisions could apply to arbitrations governed by Italian law (i.e. those having their seat in Italy), they do not apply to foreign arbitrations and so much less can they apply to an ICSID arbitration (C *I \u00a7\u00a7 110, 120; CII \u00a7\u00a7 45-47).*\n\n201.\n\nConcerning the second element, the argument relying on the doctrine of \"negozi collegati\" is of no avail to the Respondent because it is based on the serious misconception that Italian law can be applicable to decide issues of power of attorney in ICSID proceedings *(C I \u00a7 120).* Furthermore, even assuming that Italian law were applicable, the Powers of Attorney and the NASAM Mandate are not \"negozi collegati\", but separate and perfectly self-standing agreements (C *II \u00a7 30).* In addition, there is no illegality which could impinge on the power of attorney in the light of the NASAM Mandate being perfectly valid, as pointed out before *(CI \u00a7 122).*\n\n**(3) The nature of NASAM\u2019s funding arrangement**\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n202.\n\nAccording to Claimants, the NASAM Mandate is a perfectly valid contract which does nothing more than provide assistance to Claimants in financing the proceedings (C *I \u00a7 111).* No one seriously contests the legality of third party funding in international arbitration, especially in a case like the present one where the claims are brought by the original holders of the rights subject of the litigation and where the benefits of the arbitration accrue for the most part to the Claimants *(C I \u00a7 113; Tr p. 153/20).* Without prejudice to the Claimants\u2019 position on the complete irrelevance of Italian law, third party funding is perfectly in line with it (C *115, 116).*\n\n203.\n\nNASAM\u2019s primary role in this arbitration is to coordinate and fund the arbitration (C *I \u00a7 92).* It also serves as a conduit for the transmission of information between the Claimants and their attorneys. Even though NASAM assisted Claimants with finding Counsel, these were appointed by Claimants themselves *(Tr p. 155/7).* Claimants submit that the NASAM Mandate does not create a barrier between them and their Counsel (C *II \u00a7 41; Tr p. 155/19).* In particular, the Mandate does not give NASAM complete control over their claim (C *I \u00a7\u00a7 97 et seq.; C IV \u00a7 69).* Counsel is not bound by the terms and conditions of the NASAM Mandate. It is the Power of Attorney alone which governs the relationship between the Claimants and their Counsel *(CI \u00a7\u00a7 101, 105; CII \u00a7 22).* In the Hearing on Jurisdiction, Counsel emphasized that he represents the Claimants rather than NASAM and takes no instructions from the latter *(Tr pp. 156/8, 476/10).* In response to Argentina\u2019s allegation that NASAM sought to prevent the Claimants from participating in the 2010 restructuring offer, the Claimants point out that NASAM was powerless to influence Claimants since many of them felt completely free to disregard its suggestions and accepted the 2010 Exchange Offer *(C III \u00a7 32; Tr p. 157/5).*\n\n**B. Findings of the Tribunal**\n-------------------------------\n\n**1. The prerequisite of written consent of Claimants**\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n204.\n\nPursuant to Art. 25(1) of the ICSID Convention to which the Parties have referred extensively in their submissions, both parties must submit the legal dispute in question to the Centre \"in writing\" in order for the dispute to fall within ICSID jurisdiction. Whereas Claimants are convinced that they have acted accordingly, Respondent upholds that the Claimants have not fulfilled this requirement, and this in several respects:\n\n- due to the lack of Claimants\u2019 signatures on the Request (2.);\n\n- due to the fact that the Power of Attorney given to Avv. Parodi by the Claimants is invalid and that its scope does not cover the initiation of ICSID proceedings, so that Avv. Parodi actually did not act as Claimants\u2019 \"duly authorized representative\" for the purpose of filing a request for the commencement of ICSID proceedings (3.);\n\n- even in case of the said Power of Attorney being in good order, due to the failure of Avv. Parodi as the Claimants\u2019 only duly authorized representative to sign the Request *manu propria* and in view of the lack of authorization of Avv. Radicati di Brozolo as the only person having actually signed the Request (4.);\n\n- and finally, in the light of the questionable role NASAM has played in the present case (5.).\n\n205.\n\nBefore delving into these questions in more detail, the Tribunal considers it useful to begin its reasoning in the matter with a general observation. The duty to approach the Centre \"in writing\" which figures so prominently in the present case, raises two interrelated, but conceptually distinct legal questions. In the Tribunal\u2019s opinion, this distinction should be borne in mind throughout the subsequent reasoning.\n\n***a) The structure of the legal problem***\n-------------------------------------------\n\n206.\n\nFirst, Art. 25(1) of the ICSID Convention requires \"consent *in writing'* to submit a dispute to the Centre. At the same time, Art. 36(1) of the Convention states that any Contracting State or any national of a Contracting State wishing to institute arbitration proceedings shall address \"a request to that effect *in writing'* to the Secretary-General. Hence, the Convention gives rise to a twofold requirement to approach the Centre \"in writing\".\n\n**(1) Written consent to submit the dispute pursuant to Art. 25**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n207.\n\nThe prerequisite, as laid down in Art. 25(1) of the ICSID Convention, that both parties express their consent in writing for a legal dispute to be submitted to the Centre, is a jurisdictional requirement *stricto sensu.* That \"[c]onsent of the parties is the cornerstone of the jurisdiction of the Centre\" and that \"[c]onsent to jurisdiction must be in writing\" are well-known and often-cited sentences from the authoritative Report of Executive Directors.97 Consent is thus \"an indispensable condition for the jurisdiction of the Centre\", and since the Convention\u2019s \"only formal requirement for consent is that it must be in writing\"98, failure to provide written consent by any of the parties would have to lead to the dismissal of the case for lack for jurisdiction.\n\nInternational Bank for Reconstruction and Development, Report of Executive Directors of the ICSID Convention, 18 March 1965, nr. 23.\n\n*Schreuer,* ICSID Convention Commentary, Art. 25, para. 379; see also *ibid.,* para. 374.\n\n208.\n\nIn this context, it is firmly established that under the regime of Art. 25 of the ICSID Convention consent may result from a unilateral offer of arbitration on the part of the host State in a BIT which is subsequently accepted by the investor.99 The investor may accept such an offer of consent contained in a BIT simply by instituting ICSID proceedings.100 The requirement of providing consent \"in writing\" is realized by the very act of submitting the request of arbitration in written form to the Centre. It indicates a minimum of formality in accepting the host State\u2019s offer.101\n\n*Ibid.,* paras. 378 and 427 *et seq.*\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 448; *C. Schreuer,* Consent to Arbitration, in: P. Muchlinksi et al., The Oxford Handbook of International Investment Law, Oxford 2008, 830, at 837 with extensive references to the pertinent case-law.\n\n*C. F. Amerasinghe,* Submissions to the Jurisdiction of the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes, 5 Journal of Maritime Law and Commerce (1974) 211, at 217; *id.,* The International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes and Development through the Multinational Corporation, 9 Vanderbilt Journal of Transnational Law (1976) 793, at 810; *id.,* The Jurisdiction of the International Centre of Investment Disputes, 19 Indian Journal of International Law (1979) 166, at 224; see *Schreuer,* ICSID Convention Commentary, Art. 25, para. 416.\n\n**(2) Submission of the request in writing pursuant to Art. 36**\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n209.\n\nAccording to Art. 36(1) of the ICSID Convention, as already stated above, \"[a]ny Contracting State or any national of a Contracting State wishing to institute arbitration proceedings shall address a request to that effect in writing to the Secretary-General\". Pursuant to para. 2 of this provision, the request for arbitration shall contain information, *inter alia,* regarding the identity of the parties and \"their consent to arbitration in accordance with the rules of procedure for the institution of conciliation and arbitration proceedings\". This information covers the jurisdictional requirements as set out in Art. 25(1) of the ICSID Convention, notably including the requirement of consent.\n\n**(3) Interplay of the two provisions in the case of expression of consent by instituting arbitral proceedings**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n210.\n\nIf consent is expressed, as is commonly the case nowadays, by instituting arbitral proceedings, the requirement that the request for ICSID arbitration must be in writing, as set forth by Art. 36 of the Convention, simultaneously guarantees that the claimant\u2019s consent becomes manifest in written form so that the standard of Art. 25 of the Convention is met, including the \"minimum of formality\" it requires as to the manifestation of consent. In such cases, the request for arbitration does not only contain information regarding the investor\u2019s consent to submit a legal dispute to the Centre, it *embodies* it.\n\n211.\n\nIn such constellations, Art. 36 assumes a *double* function which amounts to a sort of *d\u00e9doublement fonctionnel',* on the one hand, the *direct* or *genuine* function of Art. 36 of assuring that the request is submitted to the Centre in written form, and on the other hand, the *indirect* or *derived* function of guaranteeing that the jurisdictional requirement of \"consent in writing\" is satisfied, as called for by Art. 25.\n\n***b) Application to the present case***\n----------------------------------------\n\n212.\n\nThe present case is obviously one of those - and neither of the Parties takes issue with it - where the requesting party seeks to express its consent to submit a legal dispute to the Centre by the very act of instituting proceedings, thereby accepting the offer of the host State as contained in Art. 8 paras. 3 and 5 of the Argentina-Italy BIT. Hence, the investors act to meet the jurisdictional requirement of providing written consent (Art. 25 of the ICSID Convention) through addressing a request for arbitration in writing to ICSID\u2019S Secretary-General (Art. 36 of the ICSID Convention).\n\n213.\n\nCorrespondingly, the \"Request for Arbitration\" dated 23 June 2008 expressly declares itself to be based on Art. 36 of the ICSID Convention and Art. 8(5)(a) of the Argentina-Italy BIT *(Request \u00a7* 7). Paras. 81-84 of the Request explicitly refer to the generally accepted practice of a host State offering to submit disputes to ICSID in a BIT and the investor accepting that offer, *inter alia,* by filing a request for arbitration to ICSID. It is on this basis that para. 84, second sentence (whose exact meaning is subject to dispute between the Parties102) states: \"For these purposes, the Claimants hereby accept to submit the dispute to ICSID arbitration by signing and filing this Request for Arbitration.\"\n\nSee in this regard *infra* paras. 222 *et seq.*\n\n214.\n\nImplementing the mandate contained in Art. 36(2) of the ICSID Convention, Rule 2(1)(c) of the Institution Rules requires that the request shall \"indicate the date of consent and the instruments in which it is recorded\", with \"date of consent\" meaning the \"date on which the second party acted\" in terms of expressing its consent in writing (Institution Rule 2(3)). As in the present case this date coincides with the day of the submission of the Request, the date of consent is 23 June 2008. As required by Institution Rule 2, there is an explicit statement to this effect in para. 85 of the Request.\n\n215.\n\nHowever, as explained above, the Respondent submits that the Request cannot effectively fulfill the function of providing valid consent to the arbitration, in the meaning of Art. 25 of the ICSID Convention, due to Claimants\u2019 failure to sign the Request themselves and/or their failure to duly appoint Avv. Parodi as their representative and/or the failure of the latter to sign the Request *manu propria* and/or to properly authorize Avv. Radicati di Brozolo to act as co-counsel in the present case. Accordingly, in the Respondent\u2019s eyes, against the first appearance of the case, the Claimants have never genuinely given their consent in writing. In view of the lack of a mandatory jurisdictional requirement, according to them, the case should therefore be dismissed by the Tribunal.\n\n216.\n\nIn fact, the Request bears three signatures *(Request, p. 42).* The Parties agree that none of them is from Claimants themselves. According to the Request, the signatures refer to the three individuals who, according to para. 6 of the Request, jointly represent the Claimants\n\n[f]or the purposes of the present Request and of the arbitral procedure [...]\n\na) Aw. Piero G. Parodi, member of the Milan Bar, designated in the powers of attorney referred to in para. 5(iii) above;\n\nb) Prof. Avv. Luca G. Radicati di Brozolo, member of the Milan Bar and professor of international law at the Catholic University of Milan designated as co-counsel by Avv. Parodi in accordance with the power conferred upon him by the Claimants in the powers of attorney;\n\nc) Prof. Abogado Rodolfo Carlos Barra, member of the Buenos Aires Bar and professor of administrative law at the Universidad Cat\u00f3lica Argentina designated as co-counsel by Avv. Parodi in accordance with the power conferred upon him by the Claimants in the powers of attorney.\n\n217.\n\nAmong these three, it seems that only Avv. Radicati di Brozolo signed the Request *manu propria* while in the place of Avv. Parodi\u2019s and Prof. Barra\u2019s signatures there are illegible signatures, preceded by the acronym \"pp\", standing for \"per procurationem\". This indicates that someone signed the Request on their behalf *(Trp. 329/21),* arguably Avv. Radicati di Brozolo himself (C *III \u00a7 11).*\n\n218.\n\nThis state of affairs gives rise to the question whether the Tribunal should follow the Respondent in declaring the Request not to validly express Claimants\u2019 written consent to the present arbitration and therefore in dismissing the case for lack of jurisdiction. To this effect, the aforementioned arguments are to be addressed in turn.\n\n**2. The question of the lack of Claimants\u2019 signatures from the Request**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n219.\n\nPursuant to Institution Rule 1(1), a request for arbitration must be made\n\nin writing to the Secretary-General at the seat of the Centre. The request shall indicate whether it relates to a conciliation or an arbitration proceeding. It shall be drawn up in an official language of the Centre, shall be dated, and *shall be signed by the requesting party or its duly authorized representative.* [emphasis added]\n\n220.\n\nHence, the Institution Rules expressly provide for the request for arbitration to be signed either by the requesting party itself (i.e. the Claimants) or by its \"duly authorized representative.\" From this follows that at least for the purposes of Art. 36 of the ICSID Convention (i.e. the requirement of submitting the request \"in writing\") which expressly refers to the Institution Rules, signature by representatives is sufficient. Nothing suggests that, for the purposes of Art. 25 of the Convention, one should come to a different result. In the light of the afore-mentioned double function of Art. 36, the consent of the requesting party becomes manifest or is, for that matter, embodied in the written request. Accordingly, the jurisdictional requirement of written consent in Art. 25 is satisfied by discharging the procedural one of filing a written request in Art. 36, either by the party itself or by its duly appointed representative.\n\n221.\n\nApart from the clear wording of the Institution Rules in this regard, extensive ICSID practice shows that it is highly common that requests for arbitration, including those where the request has the function of providing written consent to arbitration in the meaning of Art. 25 of the ICSID Convention, are exclusively signed by the claimant\u2019s duly appointed lawyers.\n\n222.\n\nThere is no need to reach a different conclusion even when taking into account Claimants\u2019 purported \"promise\" in the present case to sign the Request themselves. This allegedly arises from the wording of para. 84 of the Request (\"the Claimants *hereby* accept to submit the dispute to ICSID arbitration by *signing* and filing *this* Request for Arbitration\"; emphasis added) as well as from para. 2 lit. f of the NASAM Mandate which instructs Claimants to sign the Request prepared by Avv. Parodi, in such numbers of copies as may be necessary *(R I \u00a7 120; R II \u00a7 164; RIII \u00a7\u00a7 66-68).* Respondent has even contended that, since lit. P of the Mandate\u2019s Preamble made it an express condition upon each Claimant to sign the Request for the NASAM Mandate to become effective, the latter never came into effect. Yet, a number of reasons militate against qualifying the undisputed lack of Claimants\u2019 signatures from the Request as calling into question the jurisdiction of the Centre in the present case.\n\n223.\n\nFirst, the Tribunal would consider it a rather artificial reading of para. 84 of the Request (on p. 38) to mean *verbatim* that Claimants thereby committed themselves to sign the Request *manu propria.* Such an understanding construes the Request so as to read into it an obvious contradiction, inasmuch as four pages later (on p. 42) what appears is only the signature of the lawyer who obviously signed on Claimants\u2019 behalf without any hesitation as to a purported commitment in para. 84 to reserve the signatures to Claimants. Accordingly, the phrase \"by signing [...] this Request for Arbitration\" is better understood to include Avv. Parodi (and, for that matter, Avv. Radicati di Brozolo and Avv. Barra) as acting on Claimants\u2019 behalf for the purposes of submitting the Request.\n\n224.\n\nSecondly, this conclusion is corroborated by para. 6 of the Request, according to which the Claimants shall be represented by their lawyers \"for the purposes of the present Request\" which would obviously also encompass the very act of submitting the Request to ICSID. Parallel to that, the Power of Attorney expressly authorized Mr. Parodi \"[t]o sign and forward any request of arbitration [...] in my/our name and on my/our behalf\u2019 *(ibid.,* p. 2). The Request and the Powers of Attorney (as part of Exhibit C-2) were submitted together to the Centre when instituting arbitral proceedings in the present case.\n\n225.\n\nThirdly, though this Tribunal need not rely thereon in view of the other reasons given, there appear to be quite a number of examples of ICSID cases where, according to the terms of the request for arbitration, claimants are referred to as \"submitting the dispute\" or \"hereby accepting Respondent\u2019s offer\" and \"declaring consent\", without them having signed the request for arbitration themselves and without the mere presence of the signature of their duly appointed legal representatives having led to a challenge of claimants\u2019 consent on the part of the Respondent.\n\n226.\n\nFourthly, the Tribunal cannot see in what way the fact that the afore-mentioned para. 2(f) of the NASAM Mandate contains a duty of the Claimants to \"sign, when so required by Counsel Parodi, the arbitration request to be prepared by him in English, in such number of copies as may be necessary\" might affect the interpretation of para. 84 of the Request, as explained by the Tribunal above. The documents submitted to the Centre in order to institute the present arbitration were the Request accompanied by copies of the Powers of Attorney (made on the model of the form attached to the NASAM letter of 8 May 2006 and signed by the individual Claimants103)104, with the NASAM Mandate playing no role in that regard.\n\nSee Letter of 8 May 2006 by NASAM regarding \"Procedura arbitrale CIRDI-ICISD - UNCITRAL contro il govemo argentino\" (Annex RA 107), with \"Procura sp\u00e9ciale\" (\"Special Power of Attorney\" in the English translation) being attached as Annexes 3 and *3bis* (Annexes RA 111 and RA 112).\n\nPursuant to its para. 5(iii), the Request is accompanied by \"a copy of the power of attorney accorded to the attorneys mentioned in para. 6 below\", and this is referred to again on p. 43 of the Request where it is stated that Exhibit C-2 contains \"a copy of the power of attorney accorded to Counsel\"; see also *infra* para. 230 in this regard.\n\n227.\n\nFifthly, even if the NASAM Mandate should be attributed some relevance in this context, Claimants are correct to point out that NASAM was free to release the Claimants from a supposed commitment to sign the Request in person. This was a promise given by Claimants to NASAM in the NASAM Mandate which is a two-party contract. The Tribunal cannot see why the contracting party in whose favour such clause was introduced into the contract would not be able to waive it at a later stage. By doing this, it would simultaneously eliminate the condition under which the contract was arguably concluded. According to the submission of the Claimants (C *III \u00a7 66),* this is exactly what happened in the present case, and there is no reason for the Tribunal to challenge the truth of that statement. The Tribunal concludes on this matter that due to the waiver by NASAM of the requirement for the Claimants to sign in person, the lack of the signatures of the Claimants on the Request could have no adverse effect on the validity of the NASAM Mandate, let alone - what only counts here - on the validity of the Powers of Attorney and the Request they accompany as Exhibit C-2.\n\n228.\n\nSixthly and finally, the Tribunal finds it difficult to follow Respondent\u2019s argument that Claimants might have expected to sign the Request in person and therefore to have further opportunity to decide whether to consent to any particular arbitration *(RII\u00a7 167; Tr p. 83/2).* After all, all Claimants signed a Power of Attorney which expressly authorizes Avv. Parodi \"[t]o sign and forward any request of arbitration [...] in my/our name and on my/our behalf\u2019 *(ibid.,* p. 2). While already this element would suffice to dispel any doubt in this regard, in addition, the letter by NASAM to holders of Argentine bonds of 8 May 2006, i.e. more than two years before the submission of the Request, clearly spoke of instituting ICSID or UNCITRAL, i.e. arbitral proceedings against Argentina.105 The Preamble, lit. P of the NASAM Mandate referred to a wire transfer to be operated by the Claimants with the subject \"Arbitrato ICSID\" (i.e. \"ICSID Arbitration\"), and, contrary to Respondent\u2019s submissions *(R II \u00a7 166),* the Claimants acted accordingly.106 In the light of this, it is hard to believe that Claimants were taken by surprise when the Request was filed on 23 June 2008.\n\nLetter of 8 May 2006 by NASAM (North Atlantic Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 d\u2019Administration) regarding \"Procedura arbitrale CIRDI-ICSID - UNCITRAL contro il govemo argentino\" (\"ICSID-UNCITRAL arbitration proceedings against the Argentine government\") (Annex RA 107).\n\nSee the samples of money transfers made by Claimants with the reference to \"Arbitrato ICSID\" and of executed NASAM Mandates (Annexes CA 49 and CA 50). Furthermore, Claimants signaled to the Tribunal their readiness to produce copies of all the executed Mandates if the Tribunal should deem it necessary or useful (C *II \u00a7 15, n. 3).*\n\n**3. The question of defects of the Power of Attorney given to Avv. Parodi**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n229.\n\nAs mentioned before, pursuant to Rule 1 para. 1 of the Institution Rules, a request for arbitration \"shall be signed by the requesting party or *its duly authorized representative\"* (emphasis added). Claimants submit that Avv. Parodi acted as such duly authorized representative of the Claimants when the Request was submitted to the Centre on 23 June 2008.\n\n230.\n\nAccording to para. 6 of the Request, Avv. Parodi represents Claimants \"[f]or the purposes of the present Request and of the arbitral procedure [... as...] designated in the powers of attorney referred to in para. 5 (iii) above\". Pursuant to para. 5(iii), as has been mentioned before107, the Request is accompanied by \"a copy of the power of attorney accorded to the attorneys mentioned in para. 6 below\". The Tribunal reiterates in that regard that the Claimants have signed Powers of Attorney on the model of the form attached to the afore-mentioned letter of 8 May 2006 in favour of Avv. Parodi108, thus empowering this individual to act on their behalf. These Powers of Attorney have been put at the disposal of the Tribunal in regard to all of the Claimants (see *Request, pp. 8 and 43,* referring to Exhibit C-2). In view of the fact that the present phase of the proceedings deals with preliminary objections of a general character only, but not with any jurisdictional issues that may arise in relation to individual claimants109, for the purposes of deciding this preliminary phase, the Tribunal is satisfied from its examination of Exhibit C-2 that these Powers of Attorney provide a valid link between the Claimants and the Request.\n\nSee *supra* para. 226.\n\nSee *supra* note 103.\n\nSee Minutes of the First Session, point 14; *supra* para. 5.\n\n231.\n\nRespondent contends, however, that the Powers of Attorney given to Avv. Parodi by Claimants are defective, and this in a twofold sense: First, in the eyes of the Respondent, for a whole number of reasons they are legally invalid and could therefore not authorize Avv. Parodi to act on Claimants\u2019 behalf (a). Secondly, the scope of those Powers of Attorney does not cover the initiation of ICSID proceedings so that, on closer observation, Avv. Parodi actually did not act as Claimants\u2019 \"duly authorized representative\" for the purposes of filing a request for the commencement of ICSID proceedings (b).\n\n***a) The purported invalidity of the Power of Attorney***\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n232.\n\nRespondent claims that both the Powers of Attorney given to Mr. Parodi and the NASAM Mandate violate a series of formal and substantive requirements of Italian law *(R I \u00a7\u00a7 123, 129).* As the two sets of documents are intrinsically linked to each other, following the Italian law doctrine of \"negozi collegati\" upon which Argentina relies, the deficiencies of the one would necessarily affect the other. Claimants seek to counter each of the arguments based on Italian law, but above all they deny the applicability of Italian law in the first place.\n\n233.\n\nThe essence of the Parties\u2019 disagreement in this regard is whether Art. 42 of the ICSID Convention and Art. 8 para. 7 of the Argentina-Italy BIT which deal with the law applicable in ICSID proceedings would lead to the application of Italian law to the questions at stake here. This issue must be addressed by the Tribunal before entering into any analysis of Italian law with regard to the case at hand.\n\n234.\n\nPursuant to Art. 42(1) of the ICSID Convention\n\n[t]he Tribunal shall decide a dispute in accordance with such rules of law as may be agreed by the parties. In the absence of such agreement, the Tribunal shall apply the law of the Contracting State party to the dispute (including its rules on the conflicts of laws) and such rules of international law as may be applicable.\n\n235.\n\nAccording to Art. 8(7) of the Argentina-Italy BIT\n\n[t]he arbitral tribunal shall make its decisions based on the laws of the Contracting Party involved in the dispute - including its rules on conflict of laws -, the provisions of this Agreement, the terms of any particular agreements entered into regarding the investment, as well as applicable principles of international law.\n\n236.\n\nRespondent submits that both provisions point to the law of the Contracting State which is party to the dispute, i.e. Argentina, and that Argentine rules on conflict of laws (to which also both provisions refer) would call for the application of Italian law for all questions pertinent in the present context *(R II \u00a7 171).* However, the Tribunal is not convinced by this argument and rather adheres to the predominant opinion in this field, namely that the afore-cited provisions address the question of the law applicable to the merits of the case, and not the law applicable to the determination of the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction for the purposes of Art. 25 of the ICSID Convention.110\n\nSee *Ceskoslovenska obchodn\u00ed bank\u00e1, A.S. v. Slovakia,* ICSID Case No. ARB/97/4, Decision on Objections to Jurisdiction, 24 May 1999, para. 35; see also *Schreuer,* ICSID Convention Commentary, Art. 25, para. 578, stating that \"[t]ribunals have held consistently that questions of jurisdiction are not subject to Art. 42 which governs the merits of the case\" and referring in this regard to rizar\u00e1 *Corp. v.

Ukraine,* ICSID Case No. ARB/07/16, Award, 8 November 2010, para. 226.\n\n237.\n\nIn this context, Claimants have referred to the *AMTO v. Ukraine* case111 (decided on the basis of the Energy Charter Treaty) where the respondent Government had challenged the validity of the power of attorney of the claimant\u2019s counsel. The Tribunal held that\n\n[t]he applicable law in the present arbitration is the [Energy Charter Treaty] itself, and \"applicable rules and principles of international law\" (Article 26(6)). There is no requirement in the [Energy Charter Treaty] relating to powers of attorney, and nor has the Respondent identified any relevant principles of international law relating to powers of attorney. [...] Accordingly, the Arbitral Tribunal accepts the power of attorney [...] and finds that [...] the Request for Arbitration ha[s] [...] been fully authorized by the Claimant. The Respondent\u2019s objection based on lack of authority is therefore dismissed.112\n\nArbitration Institute of the Stockholm Chamber of Commerce, *Limited Liability Company AMTO v. Ukraine,* SCC Case No. 080/2005, Final Award, 26 March 2008.\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 56.\n\n238.\n\nRespondent is correct in pointing out that the provisions on applicable law are quite different when comparing the present to the *AMTO* case, with Art. 26(6) of the Energy Charter Treaty stating that the tribunal \"shall decide the issues in dispute in accordance with this Treaty and applicable rules and principles of international law.\" However, the *AMTO* case still stands for the proposition that international law does generally not lay down formal requirements regarding powers of attorney, as opposed to domestic law which often contains precise rules on that matter.\n\n239.\n\nMore particularly, and this time precisely in regard to Art. 42(1) of the ICSID Convention and Art. 8(7) of the Argentina-Italy BIT, the *Abaclat* Tribunal convincingly concluded that\n\n[i]t is widely acknowledged that the question of the existence and validity of consent in the sense of article 25(1) ICSID Convention is not subject to the law applicable to the merits designated in Article 42 ICSID Convention, but rather to Article 25 itself and the instruments expressing such consent. This is also the view of the present Tribunal, which considers that questions of consent under Article 25 ICSID Convention are subject to principles of international law, and not pursuant to any particular national law. This applies not only with regard to the material content of the consent, i.e., to its substantive validity, but also with regard to its form, i.e., to its formal validity. In this respect, Article 8(7) BIT, which refers to the law applicable to the merits of the dispute in the sense of Article 42 ICSID Convention, is irrelevant for the determination of the existence of consent.113\n\n*Abaclat* Decision, para. 430\n\n240.\n\nIn a similar vein, the present Tribunal considers that the question whether there is \"written consent\" for ICSID arbitration in the meaning of Art. 25(1) of the ICSID Convention must be assessed within the framework of the ICSID Convention itself. Pursuant to its Art. 36(1) in combination with Institution Rule 1(1), as laid out above, a request for arbitration must be submitted in writing and signed by the requesting party itself or its duly authorized representative. In the light of the double function of Art. 36 in cases of the present type114, these requirements are the necessary, but also sufficient conditions to realize \"consent in writing\" in the meaning of Art. 25 of the Convention.\n\nSee *supra* para. 211.\n\n241.\n\nAs a consequence, the proper form of the request for arbitration and the legal provisions applicable to it are, in the eyes of the Tribunal, an *autonomous* question to be assessed exclusively on the basis of the ICSID Convention and, if available, pertinent principles of international law. In this regard, Art. 36 of the ICSID Convention and the Institution Rules based thereupon constitute a *lex specialis* vis-\u00e0-vis Art. 42(1) of the Convention inasmuch as the former contain a comprehensive, and exhaustive, set of formal requirements for a request for arbitration to be properly submitted to ICSID pursuant to Art. 36 and, accordingly, to meet the prerequisite of \"consent in writing\" of Art. 25 of the ICSID Convention. Given the fact that the pertinent provisions lay out the procedural requirements for initiating proceedings in quite some detail, the carefully crafted balance between desired accessibility of the ICSID arbitration system and necessary formalism becoming manifest therein should not be burdened by additional - and extraneous -elements.\n\n242.\n\nOn this basis, the formal requirements arising from Art. 36 of the Convention and the Institution Rules are 1) the written submission of the request for arbitration to ICSID and 2) its having been signed by the Claimants\u2019 duly authorized representative. Upon a strict reading of the formal requirements, there would not even be a need for the Power of Attorney given to the representative to be in writing, let alone for a special form for this written authorization. Accordingly, form requirements established by domestic law for the validity of the Power of Attorney authorizing the representative to act can have no legal relevance here.115\n\nSee the similar conclusion in the *Abaclat* Decision, para. 432: \"With regard to the formal requirements, Article 8 BIT does not appear to impose any specific form requirement, whilst Article 25(1) ICSID Convention only requires the consent to be in \u2018written\u2019 form. No notarization or supplementary other procedure is requested.\"\n\n243.\n\nThe party submitting the request for arbitration must therefore be able to prove to the satisfaction of the Tribunal that its duly authorized representative acted on its behalf when submitting the request for arbitration, but no more than that. Hence, there must be proof, at the time of the submission of the request for ICSID arbitration, of the existence of an authorization by the claimant(s) to an individual which is sufficiently comprehensive and precise to empower that individual to act on claimant\u2019s behalf for the purpose of instituting ICSID proceedings.\n\n244.\n\nThe Tribunal thus concludes on this matter that the validity of the Request is to be exclusively assessed in the light of the formal requirements of Art. 36 of the ICSID Convention and the Institution Rules. Both pertinent requirements, i.e. written submission of the Request and its signature by the duly authorized representative, are met, as evidenced by the Request itself and the annexed Powers of Attorney given to Avv. Parodi by the Claimants. Regarding the latter requirement, however, a proviso must be added: The question whether the Powers of Attorney given to Avv. Parodi were sufficiently comprehensive and precise to empower him to institute ICSID proceedings on behalf of the Claimants will only be addressed in the following sub-section together with the pertinent arguments of the Parties.\n\n245.\n\nApart from the afore-mentioned provisions, under the pertinent rules of international law, no further formal requirements apply to the authorization of representatives by the requesting party so that there is no need for the Tribunal to enter into the diverse arguments raised as to the invalidity of the Powers of Attorney under Italian law.\n\n246.\n\nAs regards the question of the NASAM Mandate which, according to its own terms *(ibid.,* nr. 16), is governed by Italian law, the Tribunal considers that this has no bearing upon the validity of the submission of the Request to ICSID. Due to the inapplicability of Italian domestic law in the present context, neither would the Italian legal doctrine of \"negozi collegati\", whatever its scope and status within the Italian legal order, be of relevance here. The Tribunal is not able to see therefore how the purported invalidity, under Italian law, of the NASAM Mandate (which is a contract between Claimants and NASAM) could have the effect of invalidating the Powers of Attorney. Accordingly, there is no need for the present Tribunal to further elaborate on the Parties\u2019 arguments as to the validity *vel non* of the NASAM Mandate and as to the question whether the NASAM Mandate and the Powers of Attorney constitute \"negozi collegati\".\n\n***b) Purported defects in the scope of the Power of Attorney***\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n247.\n\nRespondent also argues that, even if the Power of Attorney were valid, nowhere in that document did the Claimants authorize their counsel to submit a request for arbitration to ICSID and that neither the Centre nor the Argentina-Italy BIT were mentioned in the Power of Attorney *(R I \u00a7 117; R II \u00a7 165).* The Respondent suggests that in the light of this defect the Claimants cannot be deemed to have consented to the jurisdiction of the Centre.\n\n248.\n\nIn the \"Special Power of Attorney\", Avv. Parodi is given \"every most ample authority and power to represent and to defend the undersigned in relation to all rights and faculties deriving to the undersigned from the property of the [...] bonds\" mentioned in the respective document *(ibid.,* p. 1). In particular, such conferred authority and powers entitle Avv. Parodi \"[t]o sign and forward any request of arbitration\" *(ibid,* p. 2) and to act in Claimants\u2019 name and on their behalf \"in front of Any Arbitral Tribunal, Ordinary Court and/or Authority of whatever Country of the World (with the exclusion of Italy) in relation to the said bonds\" *(ibid,* p. 2).\n\n249.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that this authorization is, in the afore-mentioned sense, both comprehensive and precise enough to empower Avv. Parodi to institute ICSID proceedings on Claimants\u2019 behalf. The Power of Attorney uses sweeping language inasmuch as it speaks of \"every most ample authority and power to represent\" the Claimants and, in particular, of Avv. Parodi being entitled to sign and forward *\"any* request of arbitration\" (emphasis added) \"in front of *Any* Arbitral Tribunal [...] in relation to the said bonds\" (emphasis added). From the Tribunal\u2019s point of view, these paragraphs can only be reasonably understood as each Claimant signing such Power of Attorney having made Avv. Parodi his \"duly authorized representative\" for the purposes of submitting a request for arbitration to ICSID.\n\n250.\n\nAny other construction of these provisions would entail a distortion of the language of the Power of Attorney. While the phrase \"Terms of Reference\" (in capital letters) *(ibid.,* p. 2) might refer to ICC arbitration, as Respondent has suggested *(R III \u00a7 72),* this cannot possibly lead to a different result, given the broad and repeated authorizations to sign *any* request for arbitration before *any* arbitral tribunal.\n\n251.\n\nLikewise, inasmuch as Respondent contends that the wording \"whatever arbitration of whatever Country of the World\" is clearly inconsistent with the nature and characteristics of ICSID arbitration *(R III \u00a7 73),* the Tribunal disagrees. First, the citation in Respondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief misstates the text of the Power of Attorney where the pertinent passage reads: \"[T]he above conferred authority and powers shall specifically entitle Mr. PIER *[sic]* GIUSEPPE PARODI [...] [t]o sign and forward any request of arbitration [...] to the Arbitral Tribunal and/or to any other competent Court or Authority of whatever Country of the World (with the exclusion of Italy) [...]\". It is far from clear, already as a matter of construction of the sentence, whether the phrase \"of whatever Country of the World\" relates only to \"any other competent Court or Authority\" or also to \"Arbitral Tribunal\"; and the same holds true of the Italian version.116 Second, and more importantly, the Tribunal would want to highlight once again that the sweeping authorization of Avv. Parodi to sign *any* request for arbitration before *any* arbitral tribunal would decide any remaining ambiguity of language in favour of Avv. Parodi having been authorized by Claimants to institute arbitral proceedings before ICSID on their behalf.\n\nSee Procura Sp\u00e9ciale (i.e. the Italian original of the Power of Attorney, Annex RA 111), p. 2: \"[L]\u2019attivit\u00e0 ed i poteri come sopra conferiti legittimano specificamente l\u2019Aw. PIER *[sic]* GIUSEPPE PARODI [...] [a] firmare ed inoltrare ogni richiesta di arbitrato [...] ad ogni Tribunale Arbitrale e/o ad ogni altra Corte od Autorit\u00e0 competente di qualsiasi Paese del mondo (ad esclusione deUTtalia) [...]\".\n\n252.\n\nAccordingly, the Tribunal concludes that there were no defects in the scope of the Power of Attorney signed by Claimants in favour of Avv. Parodi that would raise doubts as to the sufficiently comprehensive and precise character of the Power of Attorney to make Avv. Parodi the duly authorized representative of the Claimants for the purposes of submitting a request for arbitration to ICSID.\n\n253.\n\nThis result can be reached, as the Tribunal would want to emphasize, without a need to rely on the NASAM Mandate which is a contract concluded between the Claimants and NASAM. The Parties have used a lot of ink to establish, or refute, that the NASAM Mandate contributed to the authorization to institute ICSID proceedings. The Tribunal would agree in that regard with Respondent that a certain tension arises from arguing, on the one hand, that the Power of Attorney is a self-standing document for the purposes of assessing the latter\u2019s validity and, on the other hand, using the NASAM Mandate to interpret the scope of the Power of Attorney.\n\n254.\n\nHowever, the Tribunal would not go as far as speaking of a contradiction in that respect. It would still admit that the repeated references in the NASAM Mandate to ICSID arbitration117 may be used as an auxiliary argument to bolster up the main, and independent, argument that the Power of Attorney as such was broad enough to authorize Avv. Parodi to institute ICSID proceedings on Claimants\u2019 behalf. The references in the NASAM Mandate confirm that the Claimants were well aware that Avv. Parodi was preparing to take their claims to an international arbitral tribunal and that this would be done in the ICSID framework. In particular, as already mentioned above118, lit. P of the Preamble of the NASAM Mandate referred to a wire transfer to be operated by the Claimants with the subject \"Arbitrato ICSID\" (i.e. \"ICSID Arbitration\"), and the Claimants acted accordingly. Furthermore, the letter of 8 May 2006 by NASAM to holders of Argentine bonds clearly spoke of the intention to institute ICSID or UNCITRAL proceedings against Argentina.119 In the light of this, it is hard to believe that Claimants were surprised when the Request was filed on 23 June 2008.\n\nSee NASAM Mandate, Preamble, lit. H, O and P, pp. 2, 5 and 6.\n\nSee *supra* para. 228.\n\nLetter of 8 May 2006 by NASAM regarding \"Procedura arbitrale CIRDI-ICSID - UNCITRAL contro il governo argentino\" (\"ICSID-UNCITRAL arbitration proceedings against the Argentine government\") (Annex RA 107).\n\n**4. The questions of the lack of Avv. Parodi\u2019s signature from the Request and of the authorization of Avv. Radicati di Brozolo to sign on his behalf**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n255.\n\nHaving thus established that Avv. Parodi was the duly authorized representative of the Claimants for the purpose of submitting the Request on behalf of the Claimants, another issue has arisen in the proceedings, i.e. the lack of Avv. Parodi\u2019s signature from the Request. This fact has not been subject to dispute between the Parties. The same holds true for the fact that there is indeed a signature in the place where Avv. Parodi\u2019s signature should have been and that it is preceded by the abbreviation \"pp\", standing for \"per procurationem\". Respondent submits in this regard that, due to the illegible signature, it is not known who signed on Avv. Parodi\u2019s behalf *(Trp. 329/22).* The Tribunal has already found in that regard120 that it follows the submission of the Claimants (C *III \u00a7 11),* which was not disputed by the Respondent, that it was Avv. Radicati di Brozolo who signed for Avv. Parodi.\n\nSee *supra* para. 217.\n\n256.\n\nThe Parties are in fundamental disagreement, however, what legal consequences arise from the failure of Avv. Parodi to sign the Request himself. Different arguments have been marshaled by the Claimants to establish that, while Avv. Parodi did not sign *manu propria,* Avv. Radicati di Brozolo as the only person who signed the Request was authorized to act on Avv. Parodi\u2019s behalf when signing the Request. Respondent denies that such authorization existed on the relevant date.\n\n257.\n\nThe Tribunal considers in this regard that Claimants\u2019 contention as to the existence of a common practice in Italy of lawyers signing \"anche per i colleghi\" *(Tr p. 451/6)* can be of no relevance here since the Tribunal has already found, in a related context121, that questions of the jurisdiction of the Centre and of lawful representation before it are not governed by domestic law, but by international law.\n\nSee *supra* para. 241.\n\n258.\n\nOn the third day of the Hearing on Jurisdiction, however, the Claimants submitted to the Tribunal a letter, dated 3 June 2008 and addressing itself to Avv. Radicati di Brozolo and Prof. Barra *(Tr p. 334/4;* Annex CA 77). Upon a question by the Respondent, Avv. Radicati di Brozolo confirmed that the signature on the letter is that of Avv. Parodi *(Tr p. 336/9).* In English translation, it reads, as follows:\n\nDear Colleagues,  \n In connection with the new arbitration that will be submitted to ICSID on account of Mr. Alpi and other holders of Argentine Bonds who have given me the Power of Attorney to defend them, and on the basis of the powers which are given to me on the basis of that mandate, I appoint you my co-counsel, conferring upon you all the powers to represent them and to defend them jointly and severally.122\n\nThe original Italian version reads: \"Cari Colleghi, in relazione al nuovo arbitrato che sar\u00e0 sottoposto allTCSID per conto del Sig. Alpi e degli altri portatori di bonds argentini che hanno a me conferito mandato a difenderli, ed in virt\u00f9 dei poteri conferitimi dal mandato stesso, vi nomino miei co-difensori attribuendovi tutti i poteri par rappresentarli e difenderli conguintamente o disgiuntamente.\"\n\n259.\n\nIf accepted, this letter would constitute a valid sub-delegation of the powers of representation in the present case by Avv. Parodi as Claimants\u2019 duly authorized representative to the benefit of Avv. Radicati di Brozolo and Prof. Barra as co-counsel. In fact, such sub-delegation is expressly authorized by the Power of Attorney according to which Avv. Parodi is empowered \"[t]o delegate, totally or partially, any of the foregoing authorities and powers to any other lawyer or collaborator of his choice\" *(ibid.,* p. 4).\n\n260.\n\nIt is not subject to dispute between the Parties that Avv. Radicati di Brozolo signed the Request dated 23 June 2008 *manu propria.* Assuming that the afore-mentioned letter, which is dated 3 June 2008, was actually signed on that date by Avv. Parodi, Avv. Radicati di Brozolo would have been authorized to sign the Request on behalf of Avv. Parodi and, consequently, also on behalf of the Claimants. From the point of view of international law on the basis of which questions of representation have to be evaluated, there can be no objection to such chain of authorization and sub-authorization as long as the chain is uninterrupted and existed at the time when the consent for arbitration needed to be perfected, i.e. in the present case 23 June 2008.\n\n261.\n\nYet, the late submission of the letter in question in January 2011 casts some doubt on the credibility of this document. Claimants informed the Tribunal that the letter was extracted from their files only at this time *(Tr p. 334/22).* The Respondent challenged the submission and the credibility of the document *(Tr p. 335/10),* qualifying it of being a \"letter of questionable probative value\" *(RIII \u00a7 40).*\n\n262.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that Respondent makes two arguments in this regard - one on the legal level (a), the other one on the evidentiary level (b) - which must be dealt with in turn.\n\n263.\n\n(a) First, Respondent makes the *legal* argument that the Claimants would have had to attach the letter at the time of filing the Request to show that Avv. Radicati di Brozolo had been authorized to represent them *(Tr p. 336/10).* The Tribunal is not convinced by this argument and considers the above-mentioned distinction between arts. 25 and 36 of the ICSID Convention123 to be relevant to disentangle the legal issues at stake here. In this regard, the Tribunal deems it crucial to differentiate the question whether Avv. Radicati di Brozolo was *actually empowered* to act on behalf of Claimants on 23 June 2008 from the question whether this fact was *properly documented* at this time. While the former question is one of the jurisdiction of the Centre under Art. 25 of the Convention, the second relates to Art. 36 of the Convention.\n\nSee *supra* paras. 206 *et seq.*\n\n264.\n\nAs has already been stated above124, Art. 36 of the ICSID Convention and Rule 1(1) of the Institution Rules set forth 1) the written submission of the request for arbitration and 2) its having been signed by the requesting party or its duly authorized representative as formal requirements for the request for arbitration. Furthermore, Institution Rule 2(2) identifies those pieces of information to be included in the request for arbitration which shall also be supported by documentation; the document authorizing the signing representative to act on behalf of the Claimants does not figure among those. On this basis, Institution Rule 5 entrusts the ICSID Secretary-General with sending an acknowledgment of having received the request for arbitration to the requesting party. Moreover, pursuant to Art. 36(3) of the ICSID Convention and Institution Rule 6 para. 1, the Secretary-General shall, as soon as possible, either register the request for arbitration or, \"if he finds, on the basis of the information contained in the request, that the dispute is manifestly outside the jurisdiction of the Centre, notify the parties of his refusal to register the request and of the reasons therefor.\"\n\nSee *supra* paras. 219, 240.\n\n265.\n\nTo be sure, had there been doubts on the occasion of submitting the Request with regard to the signing of the Request by a duly appointed representative of the requesting party, the Secretary-General would have had to become active, under Institution Rule 6, since such lack of signature might, under the circumstances of the case, also put into question the very existence of the jurisdictional requirement of the consent of Claimants in writing. Yet, there are no indications that any such doubt existed or was raised at the time. Moreover, given the fact that Institution Rule 2(2) does not require the requesting party at the stage of submitting the request for arbitration to provide supporting documentation that the signing representative acted as a \"duly appointed representative\" in the meaning of Institution Rule 1(1), there was no basis for the Secretary-General to refuse to register the Request pursuant to Institution Rule 6(1)(b).\n\n266.\n\nEven if it were to be concluded, however, that the Secretary-General should not have proceeded to the registration of the Request, this Tribunal considers and there is relevant authority that certain violations of Art. 36 of the ICSID Convention and Institution Rule 1 are essentially *procedural* in nature and do not create as such a bar to the jurisdiction of the Centre. As Professor Schreuer puts it: \"[W]hen faced with any shortcomings in a request under Art. 36(2) and Institution Rule 2, the Secretary-General will not necessarily decline to register the request but may consult with the claimant with a view to the request\u2019s supplementation or correction. Once the request is registered, deficiencies in the request can no longer be raised and cannot operate as a bar to the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction.\"125\n\n*Schreuer,* ICSID Convention Commentary, Art. 36, para. 43 (referring to *Compa\u00f1\u00eda de Aguas del Aconquija S.A. and Vivendi Universal v. Argentina,* ICSID Case No. ARB/97/3, Decision on Jurisdiction, 14 November 2005, paras. 22, 23, 45-49, 98-104 and *Metalpar v. Argentina,* ICSID Case No. ARB/03/5, Award, 6 June 2008, para. 11).\n\n267.\n\nAs mentioned before, the decision of the question whether there is jurisdiction *vel non* incumbent on the Tribunal must be based on Art. 25 of the ICSID Convention and its requirement of \"written consent\". In this regard, the Tribunal must decide whether written consent to ICSID arbitration in the meaning of Art. 25 objectively existed. Professor Schreuer notes in this regard: \"Once a request has been registered, the tribunal must ascertain the existence of all jurisdictional requirements *on the basis of Art. 25* in the light of all available evidence. Omissions, errors and other deficiencies in the request for arbitration are not an independent basis for the tribunal to decline jurisdiction.\"126\n\n*Schreuer,* ICSID Convention Commentary, Art. 36, para. 42; emphasis added.\n\n268.\n\nThe Tribunal would thus find that, even if the Secretariat had failed to become active with regard to the requirements of Art. 36 of the ICSID Convention and the Institution Rules, this would be without further consequence on the level of Art. 36 as soon as the Request was registered, which occurred on 28 July 2008. As regards Art. 25 of the Convention which relates to the pertinent question for the Tribunal to decide, the criterion must be whether the requirement of \"written consent\" was objectively met on the relevant date which is the date of the submission of the Request, i.e. 23 June 2008127 -irrespective of whether there might have been a problem of documentation of that written consent on that date. Hence, the late appearance of the afore-mentioned letter in the proceedings cannot put into the question as such the jurisdiction of the Centre and the competence of the present Tribunal to decide the case at hand.\n\nSee *R. Dolzer/C. Schreuer,* Principles of International Investment Law, Oxford 2008, 41; *Schreuer Commentary,* Art. 25, paras. 36, 38: \"It is an accepted principle of international adjudication that jurisdiction will be determined by reference to the date on which judicial proceedings are initiated. This means that on that date all jurisdictional requirements must be met. [...] ICSID Tribunals have applied this principle consistently,\" with references to *Antoine Goetz and others v. Burundi,* ICSID Case No. ARB/95/3, Award, 10 February 1999, para. 72; *Zhinvali Development Ltd. v. Georgia,* ARB/00/1, Award, 24 January 2003, para. 307; *Bayindir Insaat Turizm Ticaret Ve Sanayi A.S. v. Pakistan,* ICSID Case No. ARB/03/29, Decision on Jurisdiction, 14 November 2005, para. 178; *Compania de Aguas del Aconquija S.A. and Vivendi Universal v. Argentina,* ICSID Case No. ARB/97/3, Decision on Jurisdiction, 14 November 2005, para. 60.\n\n269.\n\n(b) As regards the second question, Respondent challenges the *evidentiary* value of the afore-mentioned letter. The Tribunal considers in that regard that, while the circumstances of submission of the letter were quite peculiar indeed, there is no basis for the Tribunal to refuse to take the document to the case-file and to draw appropriate conclusions from it. First, the Tribunal has no reason to doubt that the signature on the letter is that of Avv. Parodi, since this was confirmed upon enquiry by the Respondent by Avv. Radicati di Brozolo in the Hearing on Jurisdiction *(Tr p. 336/9).* In addition, regarding the signatures on Claimants\u2019 letters of 10 June 2010 (pp. 1, 14) and of 21 September 2011 as well as on Claimants\u2019 Post-Hearing Brief (C *III p. 49),* it was not contested by Respondent that they come from Avv. Parodi. When compared to the signature on the letter of 3 June 2008, these appear similar enough to conclude that it was always Avv. Parodi who signed these documents. Second, concerning time issues, the letter bears the date of 3 June 2008 and there is no counter-evidence establishing that that document might have been created at a later date.\n\n270.\n\nIn the light of these findings, the Tribunal is held to conclude that the chain of authorization of the Claimants to Avv. Parodi (through the Power of Attorney) and from Avv. Parodi to Avv. Radicati di Brozolo (through the letter in question) is uninterrupted and complete and must be deemed to have existed at the time when the Request was submitted, i.e. on 23 June 2008. The jurisdiction requirement of written consent of the Claimants is thus met in the present case.\n\n271.\n\nIn this context, the Tribunal would also attach some relevance to the subsequent intervention of Avv. Parodi by letter of 10 June 2010128 and in particular to his signature on Claimants\u2019 Post Hearing Brief (C *III p. 49)* and on Claimants\u2019 letter of 21 September 2011. To be sure, any intervention by Avv. Parodi after 23 June 2008 could not have, as a matter of law, cured a lack of authorization on the relevant date. Accordingly, the Tribunal cannot endorse the contention that Avv. Parodi\u2019s later signatures on Claimants\u2019 briefs constituted \"his formal ratification of all Claimants\u2019 written and oral submissions in this arbitration\" (C *III \u00a7 8;* see also Claimants\u2019 letter of 21 September 2011) inasmuch as these were understood as \"healing\" a prior lack of authorization. Nonetheless, on the evidentiary level, the subsequent acts of Avv. Parodi indicate, as pointed out by Avv. Radicati di Brozolo *(Tr p. 450/1* 6), that Avv. Parodi knew about and consented to all the stages of the proceedings, namely including the initial stage of submitting the Request.\n\nThe further letter of 24 June 2010 to which Claimants refer (C *III \u00a7 8, n. 6)* bears the name of Aw. Parodi, but not his signature.\n\n272.\n\nWhereas the Tribunal has already concluded at this point that consent in writing of the Claimants in the meaning of Art. 25 of the ICSID Convention existed at the appropriate time, there is an alternative argument by the Claimants which has some merit in the eyes of the Tribunal. Not only does it seem to be common in ICSID proceedings that the requesting party\u2019s representative signs the request for arbitration instead of the requesting party itself129, it also appears to be a standard practice in cases before ICSID that the lawyer personally authorized by the Claimants does not sign the request for arbitration *manu propria,* but that his law firm colleagues sign for him. There even appears to be a practice in international arbitration, particularly by English and American law firms acting as counsel, to sign only with the name of the firm rather than putting the name of an individual lawyer.130 To the Tribunal\u2019s knowledge, no other ICSID tribunal has so far taken issue with this practice which would count as another indication that questions of representation must be analyzed in the context of pertinent international law and practice, and more specifically, relevant ICSID practice, and that the requirement of signature by the \"duly authorized representative\" in the meaning of Institution Rule 1 para. 1 is applied flexibly by ICSID tribunals. This arguably also reflects the needs of contemporary arbitration practice, notably in bigger law firms, where it is common that in view of the imminent expiry of time-limits for the submission of briefs other lawyers sign on the behalf of their colleagues.\n\nSee *supra* para. 221.\n\nThis was mentioned by one Member of the Tribunal during the Hearing on Jurisdiction *(Tr p. 454/9).*\n\n**5. The role of NASAM in the present proceedings**\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n273.\n\nIn view of the prominent place given to NASAM in the Parties\u2019 submissions, the Tribunal deems it appropriate to specifically address its role in the present case, though recognizing that NASAM is no party to the proceeding.\n\n274.\n\nIt is undisputed that NASAM, i.e. the *North Atlantic Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 d'Administration,* is a company active since 1978 in Monaco. In 1998, it was acquired by Guardian SA, a Swiss-based trust company. In 2006, NASAM decided to coordinate, organize and fund a legal action of holders of Argentine bonds against Argentina.\n\n275.\n\nFurthermore, Claimants emphasize that NASAM is neither a bank nor a financial institution and that it was never in any way involved, directly or indirectly, in the placing of Argentine bonds with any investors, and in particular with the Claimants. Nor does NASAM have, at present or has it had in the past, any link with the Italian banks involved in the placing of such bonds with regard to such placing. In this regard, Claimants insist that the present dispute must clearly be distinguished from the *Abaclat* case where the third party funder is an association of Italian banks, the so-called \"Task Force Argentina\" (C *I \u00a7\u00a7 89, 90).* Respondent has not challenged this aspect of Claimants\u2019 submissions regarding NASAM.\n\n276.\n\nAs to NASAM\u2019s role in respect to the present proceedings more specifically, Respondent\u2019s main concern is not the funding arrangement as such, but that NASAM was the driving force behind the present arbitration and that it has full control over it. According to Respondent, the NASAM Mandate creates an impermissible barrier between Claimants and their lawyers *(R II \u00a7 191).* In Respondent\u2019s opinion, NASAM is the \"real party in interest\" in the present dispute *(RI\u00a7 264).*\n\n277.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that, while NASAM has, without doubt, played a crucial role not only in financing the present proceedings on the Claimants\u2019 side, but also in bringing them together and coordinating them to conduct the proceedings against the Respondent, this does not amount to putting NASAM in a position to \"control\" the present proceedings. The lawyers acting in this case are bound by the Power of Attorney which legally links them to the Claimants, and to the Claimants only. At the same time, these lawyers are not bound by the NASAM Mandate which is a contract between NASAM and the Claimants. Counsel for the Claimants specifically pointed out in the Hearing on Jurisdiction that he represents the Claimants rather than NASAM and takes no instructions from the latter *(Tr pp. 156/8, 476/10).* In addition, in spite of NASAM\u2019s letter to the Claimants of 17 May 2010 seeking to influence them not to accept Argentina\u2019s 2010 Exchange Offer, a relevant part of the original Claimants in the present case decided to accept it (C *III \u00a7 32; Tr p. 157/5).*\n\n278.\n\nHence, the Tribunal cannot conclude that NASAM is more than a third party which has a special relationship to the Claimants. It is not a party to the present proceedings. The NASAM Mandate does not interfere with the ability of the Claimants to conduct the present proceedings in their best interest and to instruct their counsel accordingly. In sum, in the Tribunal\u2019s opinion, there are no substantiated indications that there would be an external control of the present proceedings by an external actor or a conflict of interests which would undermine the proper exercise of jurisdiction by the Tribunal. Accordingly, no further analysis of the question of NASAM\u2019s involvement in the present dispute is required.\n\n**III. NATIONALITY AND STANDING OF CLAIMANTS**\n----------------------------------------------\n\n**A. Positions of the Parties**\n-------------------------------\n\n**1. Contentions by Respondent**\n--------------------------------\n\n***a) The nationality requirement under Art. 25 of the ICSID Convention and Art. 1(2) of the Argentina-Italy BIT***\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n279.\n\nThe Respondent contends that the Claimants have failed to provide evidence of the nationality requirement under Art. 25 of the ICSID Convention and the nationality and domicile requirements of the Argentina-Italy BIT and the Additional Protocol *(RI \u00a7 239).* In particular, an investor (irrespective of whether it is a natural or a juridical person) must have the nationality of the Contracting State other than the State party to the dispute (positive nationality) and must not have the nationality of the host State (negative nationality) on the date of consent as well as on the date of registration in the case of natural persons. In addition, the Claimants must not have been domiciled in Argentina for more than two years prior to the acquisition of their security entitlements *(R I \u00a7\u00a7 245, 246; RIII \u00a7 164).*\n\n280.\n\nFurthermore, in the eyes of the Respondent, it is undisputable that the burden of proving that Claimants fulfill the nationality and domicile requirements of Art. 25(2) of the ICSID Convention and Art. 1 para. 2 of the Argentina-Italy BIT and the Additional Protocol falls upon them *(RI \u00a7 240; Tr p. 394/5).*\n\n281.\n\nHowever, according to the Respondent, the documents submitted by the Claimants do not satisfy the necessary requirements. Mere copies of certificates of residence and identification documents are insufficient to meet the standards of proving the aforementioned criteria *(R I \u00a7 248; R III \u00a7 167).* In particular, Claimants have failed to demonstrate that they do not possess Argentine nationality, that they are no dual nationals and that they meet the non-residency requirement *(Tr p. 107/10).*\n\n***b) Number and identity of the Claimants***\n---------------------------------------------\n\n282.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, the documentation submitted by Claimants regarding their number and identity contains incurable errors, contradictions and is incomplete. Thus, neither Claimants nor their holdings may be accurately identified *(R III \u00a7 170; Tr p. 108/3).*\n\n***c) Lack of standing due to Claimants\u2019 legal proceedings against the seller banks***\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n283.\n\nRespondent submits that the Claimants remain free to pursue legal proceedings, in addition to the present one against Argentina, against the seller banks seeking *whatever* remedy they prefer, including restitution of the sale price following a declaration of nullity, annulment or termination of the sale contracts. According to the Respondent, Claimants have admitted that at least some of them have initiated such claims but they refused any discovery in that respect *(RI \u00a7 259; RII \u00a7\u00a7 412, 413; R III \u00a7 180).*\n\n284.\n\nThe compensation which Claimants may get from the banks following a possible invalidation of the sale contracts conflicts with the claims put forward in the present proceedings. It would notably cause the Claimants to lose their purported status as investors under the Argentina-Italy BIT and their standing to bring the present ICSID claim *(RI \u00a7\u00a7 259, 260; RII\u00a7 420).*\n\n285.\n\nAs regards Claimants\u2019 argument that this question relates to the individual position of the Claimants and does therefore not pertain to the present phase of the proceedings, Respondent disagrees and submits that it has shown a basis for believing that some, and conceivably all, Claimants may lack standing because they have obtained or may obtain a domestic judgment nullifying any claim they may have. Claimants have not established that this circumstance does not pertain to every Claimant *(R I \u00a7 262; R II \u00a7 424; R III \u00a7 183).*\n\n***d) Lack of standing due to Claimants\u2019 impermissible pursuing of claims on behalf of a third party in abuse of process***\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n286.\n\nRespondent further contends that the Claimants are conducting the present proceedings on behalf of a third party, namely NASAM, who is the real party in interest, since, under paras. 5 and 6 of the NASAM Mandate, it has an irrevocable right to recover the proceeds of the claims. This is impermissible and, as a consequence, the Claimants lack standing *(RI \u00a7\u00a7 263, 264; RII \u00a7 427; R III \u00a7 184).*\n\n287.\n\nMoreover, NASAM lacks standing to pursue a claim in its own right. First, it does not have Italian nationality because it is an administrative company incorporated in the Principality of Monaco and owned by Guardian SA, a Swiss trust company. Secondly, while NASAM hired attorneys, organized the Claimants, consolidated information about the disparate claims, undertook to finance the arbitration and while it exercises complete control over it, it has not accepted the obligations of a party. This situation prejudices Respondent\u2019s ability to defend itself. In the Respondent\u2019s submission, it is an abuse of process to permit the present arbitration to continue on behalf of a real party in interest that lacks standing under the Argentina-Italy BIT *(R I \u00a7\u00a7 263, 265-268; R II \u00a7\u00a7 427, 428).*\n\n***2.*** **Contentions by Claimants**\n-------------------------------------\n\n***a) The nationality requirement under Art. 25 of the ICSID Convention and Art. 1(2) of the Argentina-Italy BIT***\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n288.\n\nThe Claimants declare that they are all individuals of Italian nationality and entities incorporated in Italy *(Request \u00a7\u00a7 4, 79).* They submit that Exhibit C-2 contains for each Claimant who is a natural person not only a copy of its passport and identity card, but also a certificate of Italian citizenship, residence and/or domicile, which reveal that all Claimants are of Italian nationality. In addition, Exhibit C-2 also contains documents which demonstrate the Italian nationality, and the absence of any link to Argentina, of the Claimants who are corporate identities (C *I \u00a7\u00a7 345, 346; C III \u00a7 28).* The certificates of citizenship provide conclusive evidence that all Claimants had Italian nationality both at the date on which the Claimants\u2019 consent to arbitrate the present dispute was given and on the date on which the Request was registered *(CI \u00a7 347; CII \u00a7 146).*\n\n289.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, the Respondent\u2019s allegations as to the Claimants\u2019 possible dual nationality and acquisition of Argentine nationality are mere speculation. Any hypothetical acquisition of Argentine nationality by a Claimant would have been recorded in the appropriate register of nationality in Argentina and would have been indicated in the further certificates of citizenship, which is not the case for any of the Claimants involved *(CI \u00a7 353).*\n\n290.\n\nIn addition, the birth and residence certificates filed by all the individual Claimants evidence the lack of merit of the Respondent\u2019s insistence that the Claimants should prove that, pursuant to the Additional Protocol to the Argentina-Italy BIT, the Claimants did not have a domicile in Argentina in the two years prior to the investment (C *I \u00a7 354; C III \u00a7 28; Tr p. 459/16).*\n\n291.\n\nAs regards the burden of proof, Claimants contend that it falls upon the Respondent to provide evidence to disprove what emerges from the documents submitted by the Claimants (C *I \u00a7\u00a7 349, 355; C III \u00a7 29).* Accordingly, in the Claimants\u2019 opinion, it is incumbent on them to prove that they are Italian nationals, but Respondent bears the burden of proving that the Claimants have Argentine or dual nationality or have at some point resided in Argentina because this point is a \"defense\" or a \"counterargument\" *(Tr p. 459/3).* The burden of proof as to these negative circumstances rests on the Respondent also because it has easier access to the evidence. In particular, it would have been easy for Argentina to verify its own register of nationality (C *III \u00a7 30).*\n\n***b) Number and identity of the Claimants***\n---------------------------------------------\n\n292.\n\nWhile the Respondent argues that the different submissions of the Claimants show differences concerning their number and identity, the latter consider such argument not true *(C I \u00a7 147).* They notably insist that no change to the number and identity of the Claimants has ever been made by them *(C I \u00a7 149).* There have been a number of inconsistencies in the tables submitted before, but they have been corrected later on *(Tr p. 477/18).* Hence, according to the Claimants, there are 64 Claimants remaining in the present case. If one considers co-owners of the same entitlement as a single Claimant (or, for that matter, a single \"center of interest\"), there are 36 remaining centres of interest (C *HI \u00a7\u00a713, 14).*\n\n***c) No lack of standing due to legal proceedings against the seller banks***\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n293.\n\nInsofar as the Respondent argues that the Claimants lack standing to bring the present action because they have pursued or are still pursuing legal proceedings against the banks selling the bonds/security entitlements, the Claimants submit that only a minority among them have brought proceedings against the seller banks. In addition, the two legal relationships involved - one of Claimants with the banks from which they purchased the bonds/security entitlements, the other with the obligor under the bonds/security entitlements, i.e. Argentina -, and the claims to which each may give rise, are completely distinct *(CI\u00a7\u00a7 369-371).*\n\n294.\n\nClaimants concede that if one amongst them has obtained (or may obtain in the future) decisions from local courts declaring null and void the acquisition of the bonds/security entitlements from the selling banks, this may cause those bonds/security entitlements to revert back to the banks and the Claimant in question to lose its status as investor under the BIT and therefore its standing in the present proceedings. In this regard, counsel for the Claimants undertook to inform the Respondent and the Tribunal of any decisions or settlements in the cases currently pending as well as in any other proceedings which might be brought by any Claimant (C *II\u00a7\u00a7 157, 158).*\n\n295.\n\nIt is further submitted by the Claimants that the precise consequences of the actions which some of the Claimants may have brought, can only be verified on a case by case basis, having regard to the specificities of the situation of each Claimant. In most cases, the outcome of such proceedings would only affect the quantum of the amount recoverable from the Respondent. The Claimants emphasize that, since all the issues have to do with the position of the individual Claimants, they are not relevant in the present phase of the proceedings (C *I \u00a7\u00a7 373, 374).*\n\n***d) No lack of standing due to Claimants\u2019 pursuing of claims on behalf of a third party***\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n296.\n\nThe Claimants criticize the Respondent for relying on a deliberately distorted reading of the role of NASAM. They insist that NASAM is not a party to the present proceedings and that the fact that NASAM had a role in organizing and funding the proceedings in no way affects this conclusion (C *II \u00a7 52).* The Claimants are definitely not pursuing claims on behalf of a third party. The fact that a third party may have an interest in the outcome of the proceedings does not of itself make it a party to the proceedings. Hence, no lack of standing can follow from the limited degree of involvement of NASAM in the present case (C *II \u00a7 59).*\n\n**B. Findings of the Tribunal**\n-------------------------------\n\n**1. The relevant provisions for the determination of jurisdiction** ***ratione personae***\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n297.\n\nIn addition to jurisdictional requirements *ratione materiae,* there are also requirements of jurisdiction *ratione personae* of the Centre and, for that matter, of the competence of the present Tribunal to decide the case at hand. There is agreement between the Parties that these requirements, as far as they are pertinent in the present proceedings, are contained, on the one hand, in Art. 25 paras. 1 and 2 of the ICSID Convention, and on the other hand, in Art. 1 para. 2 of the Argentina-Italy BIT in combination with the Additional Protocol to this BIT.\n\n298.\n\nPursuant to Art. 25(1) of the ICSID Convention, the jurisdiction of the Centre shall extend to any legal dispute arising directly out of an investment between a Contracting State and \"a national of another Contracting State\". This phrase is defined by the Convention itself in Art. 25(2) in the following terms:\n\n\"National of another Contracting State\" means:\n\n(a) any natural person who had the nationality of a Contracting State other than the State party to the dispute on the date on which the parties consented to submit such dispute to conciliation or arbitration as well as on the date on which the request was registered pursuant to paragraph (3) of Article 28 or paragraph (3) of Article 36, but does not include any person who on either date also had the nationality of the Contracting State party to the dispute; and\n\n(b) any juridical person which had the nationality of a Contracting State other than the State party to the dispute on the date on which the parties consented to submit such dispute to conciliation or arbitration and any juridical person which had the nationality of the Contracting State party to the dispute on that date and which, because of foreign control, the parties have agreed should be treated as a national of another Contracting State for the purposes of this Convention.\n\n299.\n\nIn addition, the Argentina-Italy BIT contains a definition of the term \"investor\" in its Art. 1(2). Since, as opposed to the question of jurisdiction *ratione materiae,* the Parties have not raised objections as regards the proper translation of the pertinent passages into English131, the Tribunal limits itself to refer to the authentic Spanish and Italian versions of that provision and to reproduce here only its English translation132:\n\n2. The term \"investor\" means any physical or juridical person of one Contracting Party that has made, is making, or has assumed an obligation to make investments in the territory of the other Contracting Party.\n\n- \"physical person\" means, for each Contracting Party, any physical person who has citizenship in that State, in accordance with its laws.\n\n- \"juridical person\" means, for each Contracting Party, any entity organized in conformity with the laws of a Contracting Party, having its seat in the territory of such Contracting Party and being recognized by that Contracting Party, such as public entities engaged in economic activity, partnerships or stock corporations, foundations and associations, regardless of whether their liability is limited or not.\n\n- For purposes of this Agreement, the juridical acts and the capacity of each juridical person in the territory of the Contracting Party in which the investment is made shall be regulated by the legislation of the latter.\n\nAs to this see *infra* para. 418.\n\nAs to the Spanish version and English translation by the Respondent see Annex RA 147; see *supra* note 2.\n\n300.\n\nAlso the English translation of Art. 1 of the Additional Protocol to the Argentina-Italy BIT is not contested between the Parties.133 This provision complements the definition contained in Art. 1 of the BIT with the following requirements:\n\nWith reference to Article 1 [of the BIT]:\n\na. Physical persons of each Contracting Party may not benefit from this Agreement if, at the time of making the investment, they have maintained their domicile for more than two years in the territory of the Contracting Party where the investment was made.\n\nIn the event that a physical person of one Contracting Party has, simultaneously, a registered residence in his country and a domicile for more than two years in the other Contracting Party, he shall be treated, for purposes of this Agreement, as a national of the Contracting Party in whose territory the investment was made.\n\nb. The domicile of an investor shall be determined in conformity with the laws, regulations and provisions of the Contracting Party in whose territory the investment was made.\n\nAs to the Additional Protocol's Spanish version and English translation by the Respondent see Annex RA 146.\n\n**2. The requirements of jurisdiction** ***ratione personae*** **in the present case**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n301.\n\nAs regards the jurisdictional requirements *ratione personae* in the case at hand, the Tribunal would first note that - in analogy to the situation regarding jurisdiction *ratione materiae134 -* both the pertinent prerequisites of the ICSID Convention and the Argentina-Italy BIT including its Additional Protocol have to be met by the Claimants in order for the case to pass the threshold of jurisdiction and to proceed to the merits.\n\nSee *infra* paras. 435 *et seq.*\n\n***a) The requirements under Art. 25 of the ICSID Convention***\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\n302.\n\nAs regards, first, the requirement that a legal dispute arise between a Contracting State and \"a national of another Contracting State\", the definition in Art. 25(2) of the ICSID Convention is twofold inasmuch as it addresses natural or physical persons, on the one hand, and juridical or legal persons, on the other hand, separately. The definition applies positive and negative elements to determine what a national of another Contracting State is for the purposes of the Convention.\n\n303.\n\nAccordingly, under this provision and applied to the case at hand, for a natural person to qualify as a \"national of another Contracting State\" for the purposes of the ICSID Convention, it *must* have had Italian nationality (or that of another non-Argentine Contracting State of the ICSID Convention)\n\n(a) on the date on which the parties consented to submit the dispute to arbitration, i.e. 23 June 2008135;\n\n(b) on the date of the registration of the Request for Arbitration, i.e. 28 July 2008136;\n\nand *must not* have had Argentine nationality\n\n(c) on either the date of consent\n\n(d) or on the date of registration of the Request for Arbitration.\n\nSee *supra* para. 16 in combination with para. 214.\n\nSee *supra* para. 17.\n\n304.\n\nFurthermore, for a juridical person to be a \"national of another Contracting State\" for the purposes of the ICSID Convention, it must have had Italian nationality (or that of another non-Argentine Contracting State) on the date of consent, i.e. 23 June 2008. Alternatively, but of no relevance to the present case, a juridical person having had the Argentine nationality on the date of consent is also covered by the definition if the Parties agree that, due to foreign control, it should be treated as a national of another Contracting State for the purposes of the ICSID Convention. Hence, as regards juridical persons, in the present case only a positive nationality requirement applies.\n\n***b) The requirements under Art. 1 of the Argentina-Italy BIT and its Additional Protocol***\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n305.\n\nIn addition, Art. 1(2) of the Argentina-Italy BIT also distinguishes between natural/physical and juridical/legal persons: it defines \"for the purposes of this Agreement\" investor as \"any physical or juridical person of one Contracting Party that has made, is making, or has assumed an obligation to make investments in the territory of the other Contracting Party\".\n\n306.\n\nOn this basis, Art. 1(2) of the BIT determines that \"physical person\" means \"for each Contracting Party, any physical person who has citizenship in that State, in accordance with its laws\". In contrast, \"juridical person\" means \"for each Contracting Party, any entity organized in conformity with the laws of a Contracting Party, having its seat in the territory of such Contracting Party and being recognized by that Contracting Party, such as public entities engaged in economic activity, partnership or stock corporations, foundations and associations, regardless of whether their liability is limited or not\". The provision further states that \"[f]or purposes of this Agreement, the juridical acts and the capacity of each juridical person in the territory of the Contracting Party in which the investment is made shall be regulated by the legislation of the latter\".\n\n307.\n\nAs already mentioned, the Additional Protocol to the Argentina-Italy BIT which was signed on the same day as the BIT itself (i.e. 22 May 1990) contains \"with reference to Article 1 [of the BIT]\" additional requirements regarding domicile if a natural/physical person were to qualify as such under Art. 1 para. 2 of the Argentina-Italy BIT.\n\n**3. Allocation of the burden of proof regarding the nationality and domicile requirements**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n308.\n\nWhile Respondent contends that the Claimants bear the burden of proving all aspects of the nationality and domicile requirements - i.e. (i) the positive nationality requirements, (ii) the negative nationality requirements as well as (iii) the negative domicile requirement -, Claimants argue that it only falls upon them to prove that they are Italian nationals, but that the Respondent bears the burden of proving that the Claimants have Argentine or dual nationality or have at some relevant point resided in Argentina.\n\n309.\n\nThe ICSID Convention or Arbitration Rules do not contain specific provisions on the allocation of burden of proof. ICSID tribunals have applied several rules regarding the burden of proof concerning facts upon which the parties rely.137 These notably include rules that are well established in international adjudication, e.g. the general rule that the burden of proof is with the claimant and that the burden of proof lies with the party asserting a fact, whether it being the claimant or the respondent.\n\nSee as to this aspect, e.g., *Schreuer,* ICSID Convention Commentary, Art. 43, para. 116.\n\n310.\n\nAgainst this background, it appears reasonable to adopt the view that the legal regime of the ICSID Convention follows general international law in this regard. The Tribunal would consider that it can usefully draw in this respect upon the finding of the International Court of Justice in the *Avena* case138, since the Court had a situation before it which is largely comparable to that in the present case.\n\n*Avena and Other Mexican Nationals (Mexico* v. *USA), Judgment,* ICJ Reports 2004, 12.\n\n311.\n\nIn that case, Mexico and the United States disagreed on what each Party had to show as regards nationality in connection with Art. 36 para. 1 of the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations. Mexico accepted that it had to prove that the persons in question were Mexican nationals, but it contended that the burden of proof would lie with the United States should the Respondent in that case wish to contend that particular persons of Mexican nationality were also US nationals. The International Court of Justice emphasized \"the well-settled principle in international law that a litigant seeking to establish the existence of a fact bears the burden of proving if\u2019.139 On that basis, the Court endorsed Mexico\u2019s position inasmuch as it took \"the view that it was for the United States to demonstrate that this was so [i.e. that the persons in question were US nationals] and to furnish the Court with all information on the matter in its possession\".140\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 55, with reference to *Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua, Jurisdiction and Admissibility, Judgment,* ICJ Reports 1984, 392, para. 101.\n\n*Avena and Other Mexican Nationals (Mexico* v. *USA), Judgment,* ICJ Reports 2004, 12, para. 57.\n\n312.\n\nIn the light of this, the present Tribunal concludes that the burden of proof that the Claimants are Italian nationals falls on the Claimants themselves, while the burden to disprove the negative elements - i.e. of not being Argentine (or, for that matter, dual) nationals and of not having been domiciled in Argentina for more than two years - would fall on the Respondent\u2019s side.\n\n**4. Application to the present case**\n--------------------------------------\n\n***a) The Claimants\u2019 duty to substantiate the nationality requirement***\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n313.\n\nClaimants contend that they are \"individuals of Italian nationality and entities incorporated in Italy\" *(Request \u00a7 79).* In view of the (initial) list of 119 Claimants, it is stated that it contains \"individuals and entities - all of Italian nationality\" *(Request \u00a7 4).* According to the Claimants\u2019 submission, Exhibit C-2 contains, amongst others, a copy of each Claimant\u2019s document of identification (Passport or Identity Document for individuals) or certificate of incorporation (for companies) *(Request p. 43).*\n\n314.\n\nThe Tribunal would note in that regard that it is *not* necessary that assertions on nationality - which are mandatory under Art. 36(2) of the ICSID Convention in combination with Rule 2(1)(d)(i) and (ii) of the Institution Rules141, and have accordingly been made by the Claimants - are substantiated by documentary evidence at the stage of filing the Request; such evidence may, however, have to be produced at a later stage.142 That there is no duty incumbent upon the Claimants to substantiate the nationality requirement already at the time of submission of the claim follows from the clear wording of Institution Rule 2(2) which requires documentation for nationality purposes only in one instance, i.e. with respect to an agreement of the parties to treat a juridical person as a national of another Contracting State for the purposes of the Convention (see Art. 25(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention and Institution Rule 2(1)(d)(iii) - an alternative which is not applicable here. *E contrario* no documentation requirement exists regarding the indications to be made under Institution Rule 2 para. 1 lit. d sublit. i and ii, i.e. the positive and negative nationality requirements. Accordingly, there is no parallelism between the duty of indicating certain states of affairs, on the one hand, and that of documenting or substantiating and proving that information, on the other hand.\n\nAccordingly, \"[t]he Request shall [...] (d) indicate with respect to the party that is a national of a Contracting State: (i) its nationality on the date of consent; and (ii) if the party is a natural person: (A) his nationality on the date of the request; and (B) that he did not have the nationality of the Contracting State party to the dispute either on the date of consent or on the date of the request [...]\".\n\n*Schreuer Commentary,* Art. 25, para. 686 as well as Art. 36, para. 27, referring to Note D to Institution Rule 2, 1 ICSID Reports 53/4, and Note B to Institution Rule 6 of 1968, 1 ICSID Reports 58.\n\n315.\n\nThis is also relevant in view of Regulation 30 of the Administrative and Financial Regulations which contains rules on \"supporting documentation\" within the meaning of Institution Rule 2(2). According to that Regulation, documentation shall include, unless otherwise agreed by the parties or ordered by the competent Tribunal, the complete document or a duly certified copy or extract, except if the party is unable to obtain such document or certified copy (in which case the reason for such inability must be stated). In addition, pursuant to para. 3 of Regulation 30, each document which is not in a language approved for the proceeding in question, shall, unless otherwise ordered by the competent Tribunal, be accompanied by a certified translation into such a language.\n\n316.\n\nYet, as has been explained before, no documentation obligation exists insofar as the nationality requirement is concerned. As a consequence, no formal documentation requirement can be derived from the ICSID legal regime in regard to the positive and negative nationality prerequisites. In particular, there is no duty to provide the Tribunal with the originals or certified copies of the documents substantiating that the Claimants are Italian nationals. In a similar vein, there is no obligation to furnish translations of Italian documents into English and/or Spanish.\n\n317.\n\nFurthermore, as mentioned in the context of Claimants\u2019 consent to arbitration143, Institution Rule 2 is of a procedural nature. Even if there were deficiencies in the request for arbitration, once the request is registered, those deficiencies can no longer be raised and cannot operate as a bar to the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction. \"Once a request has been registered, the tribunal must ascertain the existence of all jurisdictional requirements on the basis of Art. 25 in the light of all available evidence. Omissions, errors and other deficiencies in the request for arbitration are not an independent basis for the tribunal to decline jurisdiction.\"144\n\nSee *supra* para. 266.\n\n*Schreuer,* ICSID Convention Commentary, Art. 41, paras. 38, 42 and 43. See also *ibid.,* Art. 36, para. 43 (as to the references to the pertinent case-law see *supra* note 125).\n\n318.\n\nAccordingly, the question of the appropriate way for Claimants to meet the substantiation requirement for their having Italian nationality must be drawn from the general evidentiary regime of the ICSID Convention. The Tribunal will therefore have to decide whether an investor meets the Convention\u2019s nationality requirements in the same manner as with the other objective requirements for ICSID jurisdiction. A certificate of nationality will therefore be treated as part of the \"documents or other evidence\" to be examined by the Tribunal in accordance with Art. 43 of the ICSID Convention.145 ICSID arbitration is not governed by formal rules nor by national laws on evidence. ICSID tribunals have full discretion in assessing the probative value of any piece of evidence introduced before them.146 In general, the finding of the Annulment Committee in *Soufraki v. United Arab Emirates* that \"[i]t is only in exceptional cases [...] that ICSID tribunals have to review nationality documentation issued by state officials\",147 may be taken as a guidance in that regard.\n\n*Ibid.,* Art. 25, para. 649.\n\n*Ibid.,* Art. 43, para. 104, referring to Arbitration Rule 34 para. 1 as well as to Note A to Arbitration Rule 33 of 1968, 1 ICSID Reports 95.\n\n*Hussein Nuaman Soufraki v. United Arab Emirates,* ICSID Case No. ARB/02/7, Decision on Annulment, 5 June 2007, para. 28.\n\n319.\n\nIn sum, also photocopies of passports or identity documents or certificates of incorporation will suffice to adequately substantiate the Italian nationality requirement for natural and juridical persons - pursuant to Art. 1(2) of the Argentina-Italy BIT, the nationality of a juridical person depends on whether the entity in question is organized in conformity with the laws of a Contracting Party (in this case Italy), has its seat in this Party\u2019s territory and is recognized by it -, as long as there are no relevant counterindications and as long as the Tribunal is satisfied that the documents are in order. In view of the fact that the present phase of the proceedings deals with preliminary objections of a general character only, but not with any jurisdictional issues that may arise in relation to individual claimants148, for the purposes of deciding this preliminary phase, the Tribunal is satisfied from its examination of Exhibit C-2 that the documents supplied by the Claimants suffice to substantiate the nationality requirement.\n\nSee Minutes of the First Session, point 14; *supra* para. 5.\n\n***b) The Respondent\u2019s claims regarding dual nationality and the lack of the domicile requirement***\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n320.\n\nThe Respondent has raised doubts in the present proceedings as to whether (part of) the Claimants were not Argentine or dual nationals and as to whether they meet the domicile requirement, as laid down in the Additional Protocol to the Argentina-Italy BIT. The Tribunal has already concluded that the burden to disprove these negative elements falls on the Respondent.\n\n321.\n\nThe Tribunal notes, however, that the Respondent did not make any concrete claims in this regard. In sum, nothing has come to the fore during the proceedings which would indicate that any of the Claimants in the present case would have been a dual national (i.e. would have also Argentine nationality) at any point in time or would have been domiciled in Argentina at all, let alone for longer than two years. Hence, the Tribunal concludes that in terms of the negative nationality and domicile requirements, due to the lack of relevant concrete submissions and documentation from the Respondent\u2019s side, no problems as to the jurisdiction *ratione personae* of the Centre and accordingly regarding the competence of the Tribunal arise.\n\n***c) Conclusion***\n-------------------\n\n322.\n\nThe Tribunal therefore concludes that no doubts regarding the jurisdiction *ratione personae* of the Centre in relation to the present case have become manifest.\n\n323.\n\nThis conclusion particularly holds true in view of the mandate given to the Tribunal in the present preliminary phase of the proceedings on jurisdiction and admissibility which shall \"deal with preliminary objections of a general character only, but not with any jurisdictional issues that may arise in relation to individual claimants\".149\n\nMinutes of the First Session, point 14; see *supra* para. 5.\n\n324.\n\nIn that respect, Claimants have usefully pointed to the *Bayview* case where in regard to the same matter it was stated that \"[i]t is clear that there are at least some claimants who meet the requirement that they be nationals or enterprises of a Party\".150 Also in the dispute at hand, there can be no doubt that at least some of the Claimants qualify as \"nationals of another Contracting State\" in the meaning of Art. 25(2) of the ICSID Convention and as \"investors\" in the meaning of Art. 1(2) of the Argentina-Italy BIT. This suffices to establish the jurisdiction *ratione personae* in the present dispute and to allow the case to move forward to the merits stage.\n\n*Bayview Irrigation District and others v. Mexico,* ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/05/l, Award, 19 June 2007, para. 89.\n\n325.\n\nAt the same time, should the Respondent, in the further course of the proceedings, submit relevant information to the Tribunal regarding the nationality and domicile requirements which would raise doubts as to whether certain individual Claimants qualify as \"nationals of another Contracting State\" or \"investors\" under the afore-mentioned provisions, the Tribunal reserves the right to enter into a more detailed analysis of these individual cases \"at a later stage as necessary and appropriate\"151 and to draw the necessary conclusions from it.\n\nMinutes of the First Session, point 14; see *supra* para. 5: \"[...] jurisdictional issues that may arise in relation to individual claimants, which would be dealt with at a later stage as necessary and appropriate.\"\n\n326.\n\nIn a similar vein, having stated that the Claimants have, as a matter of principle, successfully substantiated that they have Italian nationality, the Tribunal reserves the right to go beyond this necessarily general finding and to individually examine the materials and documents made available to it by the Claimants in the further course of the proceedings, with a view whether Claimants actually were Italian nationals on the relevant dates.\n\n**5. The Respondent\u2019s claims regarding the purported lack of standing of the Claimants**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n327.\n\nThe Tribunal now proceeds to the question of the purported lack of standing of the Claimants. To begin with, inasmuch as the Respondent has contended that the Claimants do not have *locus standi* since in their capacity as holders of security entitlements acquired through multiple intermediaries they are only remotedly connected with the underwriters and the underlying bonds *(R I \u00a7\u00a7 253-258; R II \u00a7\u00a7 400-411),* the Tribunal would refer to the treatment of this question in the following Chapter of the present Decision.152 In view of the fact that the issuance and the circulation of the bonds/security entitlements in the present case must be regarded as an economic unity, there is neither too remote a relation between the Claimants and Argentina nor does there exist, in the light of the numerous intermediaries involved, any \"cut-off point\" beyond which the Claimants could not rely on the bonds/security entitlements vis-\u00e0-vis the Respondent.\n\nSee *infra* Chapter IV, paras. 422 *et seq.*\n\n328.\n\nSimilarly, the Respondent\u2019s related argument that the Claimants are not investors within the meaning of Art. 1 para. 2 of the Argentina-Italy BIT because they did not make an investment in the territory of the Respondent, as expressly provided for in that rule *(R I \u00a7\u00a7 251, 252; RII \u00a7\u00a7 397, 398),* will be dealt with in further detail, and disposed of, in the context of discussing the analogous territoriality requirement contained in Art. 1 para. 1 of the Argentina-Italy BIT regarding the concept of \"investment\". Respondent itself concedes in that regard that \"investors do not exist in isolation from their investments\" so that, in relation to the question at hand, the Tribunal would refer *mutatis mutandis* to the pertinent Chapter in the present Decision.153\n\nSee *infra* paras. 496 *et seq.*\n\n329.\n\nYet, beyond that, the Respondent has marshaled two further arguments suggesting that the Claimants lack standing to bring the case at hand before the Tribunal.\n\n330.\n\nFor one, the Respondent is right to point out that decisions of domestic courts regarding claims brought by the Claimants against banks and financial intermediaries in connection with their purchases of the bonds/security entitlements in question may have repercussions as to how much compensation they might receive in the present case. In the extreme, if those Claimants\u2019 whole loss has been wholly compensated for, they would indeed lose standing to bring any claim against the Respondent before the present Tribunal.\n\n331.\n\nThe Tribunal would, however, follow the Claimants\u2019 argument that this is an issue to be addressed individually on a case by case basis. In accordance with the mandate with which the Tribunal has been endowed for this preliminary phase of the proceedings, these are questions to be dealt with at the merits stage. Insofar as the current phase is restricted to preliminary objections of a \"general character only\"154, the Tribunal would conclude that the Respondent *(RI \u00a7 262; RII \u00a7 424; R III \u00a7 183)* has not arrived at convincing the Tribunal that the afore-mentioned problem is an omnipresent or general one for all or most of the Claimants. The Respondent errs inasmuch as it insinuates that the Claimants have not established that this circumstance does not pertain to every Claimant. It would have been incumbent upon the Respondent to show that the limited number of cases it referred to in terms of possible implications of domestic proceedings for the case at hand amounts to a problem of \"general character\" that would not only imply a possible reduction of the compensation to be claimed, but completely deprive the Claimants of their *locus standi* before the present Tribunal.\n\nMinutes of the First Session, point 14; see *supra* para. 5.\n\n332.\n\nMoreover, the Tribunal cannot endorse that the Claimants would lose standing because of the purported role which NASAM plays in the present proceedings. This issue has already been addressed, and disposed of, by the Tribunal155, and there is no need to revert to this discussion. The Claimants are not pursuing their claims on behalf of NASAM. Accordingly, it can be of no relevance in the present case whether NASAM itself would qualify as a \"national of another Contracting State\" or an \"investor\" under Art. 25(2) of the ICSID Convention and Art. 1(2) of the Argentina-Italy BIT, respectively. Thus, the Tribunal cannot see any basis for the Respondent\u2019s claim that present proceeding constitutes an abuse of process due to the role of NASAM.\n\nSee *supra* paras. 273 *et seq.*\n\n**6. Discontinuance of proceedings, consolidated list of Claimants, implications for the allocation of costs and renaming of the proceedings**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n333.\n\nFinally, there remain some matters to be dealt with in regard to the status of Claimants in the present proceedings. They relate to the fact that, in the wake of Respondent\u2019s new Exchange Offer of April 2010156, a number of the persons constituting the initial 119 Claimants have decided to accept Argentina\u2019s offer and have sought to discontinue the present proceedings.\n\nSee Annexes CA 74 as well as RA 305.\n\n***a) Discontinuance of proceedings in regard to several Claimants***\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n334.\n\nThe Tribunal would recall in that regard that para. 4 of the Request provides a list of the 119 initial Claimants who were grouped in 68 segments (from no. 1 to no. 67, including no. 34/v.s), testifying to the fact that a number of individual Claimants are co-owners of the same entitlements (C *III \u00a7 14).* Later in the proceedings, those groups were referred to as \"centers of interest\" by the Claimants.\n\n335.\n\nIn view of certain ambiguities in that regard, \"[i]n order to avoid any doubt about the correct number and identity of each original Claimant and their entitlements\", the Claimants attached a new table as Annex CA 51 (C *II \u00a7 150).* According to the Claimants, this table does not contain any new information, but is extrapolated from the documents already produced in Exhibit C-2 of the Request (C *II \u00a7 151).* In fact, the list of persons provided on 23 June 2008 (in the Request) is identical with that of October 8, 2010 (in the Claimants\u2019 Rejoinder on Jurisdiction).\n\n336.\n\nAs already mentioned, following Argentina\u2019s 2010 Exchange Offer, some Claimants have sought to withdraw from the proceedings. Claimants have provided the Tribunal with a list of 55 individuals (grouped in 32 \"centers of interest\")157 \"who have discontinued the proceedings as of October 8, 2010\" (C *II \u00a7 144).* This would leave 64 Claimants (in 36 \"centers of interest\") remaining in the proceedings. In a further effort of clarification, Claimants have confirmed this position in their Post-Hearing Brief (C *III \u00a7* *14)158,* with Claimants agreeing with the Respondent that the co-owners of bonds shall not be considered a single Claimant (C *II \u00a7 149).*\n\nSee Annex CA 73.\n\nSee Annex CA 78.\n\n337.\n\nAs regards the 55 individuals listed in Annex CA 73 (C *II \u00a7 144)* who have, in the Claimants\u2019 submission, discontinued the proceedings as of 8 October 2010, the present Tribunal shares the opinion of the Tribunal in the *Abaclat* case that in regard to withdrawals announced after the notice of registration, i.e. on 28 July 2008, \"a claimant may not unilaterally withdraw its request for arbitration without the consent of the other party. In other words, once a request for arbitration is registered, a unilateral withdrawal by a party is no longer possible and a party may only be excluded from the proceedings through the mechanism of discontinuance under Rules 43 and 44 ICSID Arbitration Rules\".159 Accordingly, a mere notice of withdrawal by the Claimants to the Tribunal and the Respondent cannot by itself effect the discontinuance of the proceedings regarding the 55 individuals referred to above.\n\n*Abaclat* Decision, para. 615.\n\n338.\n\nAgain in accordance with the approach taken in the *Abaclat* case160, the present Tribunal interprets the Claimants\u2019 notice as an expression of the desire of those Claimants not to be part of the proceedings any more in the sense of a request for discontinuance of the proceedings pursuant to Rule 44 of the Arbitration Rules. It has been accepted in investment arbitration beyond the *Abaclat* case that discontinuance under Arbitration Rule 44 in respect of some, but not all of several parties is well possible.161\n\nSee *ibid.,* paras. 617, 619, and 620.\n\nSee *Suez, Sociedad General de Aguas de Barcelona SA., and InterAguas Servicios Integrales del Agua S.A. v. Argentina,* ICSID Case No. ARB/03/17, Decision on Jurisdiction, 16 May 2006, paras. 17, 18; *Suez, Sociedad General de Aguas de Barcelona S.A., and Vivendi Universal S.A. v. Argentina,* ICSID Case No. ARB/03/19, Decision on Jurisdiction, 3 August 2006, paras. 17, 18; see further *Schreuer,* ICSID Convention Commentary, Art. 48, para. 84.\n\n339.\n\nHowever, such discontinuance is subject to the conditions and requirements as spelt out in Arbitration Rule 44. In particular, the Tribunal may only issue an order taking note of the discontinuance of the proceeding if the other party has made no objection thereto. Inasmuch as the Claimants argue that \"Argentina has already agreed to such discontinuance pursuant to Rule 44 of the Arbitration Rules by requiring, as a precondition to the participation in the 2010 [Exchange Offer], that each bondholder terminate all legal proceedings against Argentina and release Argentine *[sic]* from all administrative, judicial and arbitral claims\" (C *II \u00a7 144),* the Tribunal cannot agree. Arbitration Rule 44 proscribes a certain procedure to be followed by the Tribunal, namely to fix a time limit within which the other party may state whether it opposes the discontinuance. Only the respect for, and the reliance on, such procedure may trigger the specific legal consequences attached to this provision, including that of the other party being deemed to have acquiesced in the discontinuance if no objection is made within the time limit.\n\n340.\n\nCorrespondingly, by letter of 10 September 2012, Respondent was requested to state by 17 September 2012 whether it opposes the discontinuance of the proceedings by the 55 Claimants contained in Annex CA 73 and was further adverted to the legal consequences provided by Rule 44 of the Arbitration Rules if no objection was made within the time limit.\n\n341.\n\nBy letter of 17 September 2012, Respondent submitted its observations in regard to Annex CA 73 and the list of 55 Claimants who intended to discontinue the proceedings as of 8 October 2010. Respondent stated that, pursuant to Arbitration Rule 44, it does not object to the discontinuance of the proceedings in connection with those Claimants that, including those listed in Annex CA 73, tendered into the 2010 Exchange Offer.162 In addition, Respondent requested the Tribunal to order that the Respondent and the Claimants subject to discontinuance under the terms of the afore-mentioned letter bear the costs of the proceedings equally and that each of them bear their own costs.163\n\nThe Spanish original of the Letter of 17 September 2010 reads: \"La Rep\u00fablica Argentina informa que, en virtud de la Regla de Arbitraje 44 del CIADI, no se opone a la terminaci\u00f3n de este procedimiento en relaci\u00f3n con aquellos Demandantes que, entre los incluidos en el Anexo CA-73, entraron al Canje de 2010.\"\n\nSee *ibid.-.* \"En consecuencia, la Rep\u00fablica Argentina respetuosamente le solicita al Tribunal que ordene, oportunamente, que la Rep\u00fablica Argentina y aquellos Demandantes respecto de los cuales el procedimiento se ha terminado, en los t\u00e9rminos de esta nota, soporten en forma equitativa los costos del arbitraje y que cada uno de ellos soporto sus proprios costos.\"\n\n342.\n\nBy further letter of 1 October, the Tribunal requested the Claimants to provide it with reliable information which Claimants among the 55 persons listed in Annex CA 73 meet the afore-mentioned requirements. In their response dated 18 October 2012, the Claimants submitted an updated list of Claimants who have accepted the 2010 Exchange Offer. Pursuant to the Claimants, in particular, out of the 55 persons indicated in Annex CA 73, 29 accepted the Exchange Offer.\n\n343.\n\nThese 29 individuals (grouped in 19 \"centers of interest\") are:\n\n1) 2) Alpi Giordano and Mazzetti Silvia,\n\n3) Bartolomeoli Roberto,\n\n4) 5) Bellosi Angiolo and Paolini Cesarina,\n\n6)7) Beretta Davide and Zorza Giuseppina,\n\n8) Biti Roberta,\n\n9) Borgogno Lidia,\n\n10) Candini Daniele,\n\n11) 12) Carelli Natale and Savelli Anna,\n\n13) D\u2019Amico Massimino Ciro,\n\n14) Di Caterina Pietro,\n\n15) Gherardi Gabriele,\n\n16) Gorini Mauro,\n\n17) 18) Iacovera Erminio and Moruzzi Clelia,\n\n19) Novia Pietro,\n\n20) 21) Olmo Alessandrina and Zanzoterra Diego,\n\n22) 23) Pampagnin Enrico and Martellato Antonietta,\n\n24)-27) Rosetti Lina, Quami Mario, Quami Alessandro and Quami Margherita,\n\n28) Steinhauslin Carlo,\n\n29) Viccei Cinzia.\n\n344.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that, if it is to issue an order under Arbitration Rule 44 taking note of the discontinuance of the proceedings in regard to certain Claimants, it can only do so if and insofar as the Respondent has made no objection to the Claimants\u2019 request for discontinuance164, i.e. to the extent that the Claimants\u2019 request for discontinuance and the Respondent\u2019s non-objection to discontinuance overlap. As mentioned before, the Claimants\u2019 request includes the 55 individuals listed in Annex CA 73. According to the Respondent, it does not object to the discontinuance of the proceedings in regard to those Claimants who tendered into the 2010 Exchange Offer. In the light of Claimants\u2019 submission of 18 October 2012, the 29 individuals listed therein accepted the 2010 Exchange Offer; they are also all listed in Annex CA 73. They are therefore those Claimants in regard to whom the Parties\u2019 declarations of request for, and non-objection to, discontinuance overlap.\n\nSee also *Abaclat* Decision, para. 628 in this regard.\n\n345.\n\nHence, the Tribunal takes note, under Arbitration Rule 44, of the discontinuance of the proceedings in regard to the 29 Claimants listed in para. 343. The discontinuance takes effect as of the date of this Decision, i.e. 8 February 2013.\n\n346.\n\nAccordingly, the proceedings involving the 29 afore-mentioned Claimants subject to discontinuance are terminated. The Claimants having withdrawn from the proceedings are not subject to or bound by the present Decision, except for the considerations in the present section a) and the subsequent section c) (on the implications of discontinuance for the allocation of costs) and the related parts of the *dispositif165* as well as the separate Procedural Order on the allocation of costs.\n\nSee *infra* para. 631.\n\n***b) Consolidated list of Claimants***\n---------------------------------------\n\n347.\n\nIn the light of the discontinuance of the proceedings in regard to the afore-mentioned 29 Claimants, 90 individuals remain Claimants in the present proceeding. For reasons of clarity, the Tribunal enumerates them in the following:\n\n|  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| *Remaining* *Claimants* | *\"Centers of Interest\"* | *Old* *Numbering* | *Names of Claimants* |\n| 1. | 1. | 2 | Ambiente Ufficio S.p.A. |\n| 2. |  |  | Longo Mauro |\n| 3. | 2. | 3 | Barbagini Attilio |\n| 4. | 3. | 4 | Barnaba Giorgio |\n| 5. |  |  | Meoni Bernardo |\n| 6. | 4. | 9 | Bonfissuto Girolamo |\n| 7. |  |  | Raimondo Patrizia |\n| 8. | 5. | 11 | Briga Benedetto Salvatore |\n| 9. |  |  | Di Girolamo Maria Luisa |\n| 10. | 6. | 12 | Burzi Luciano |\n| 11. |  |  | Re Romana |\n| 12. |  |  | Burzi Alberto |\n| 13. |  |  | Burzi Andrea |\n| 14. | 7. | 13 | Buscaglia Fernanda |\n| 15. | 8. | 14 | Buscaglia Giancarlo |\n| 16. |  |  | Garbarini Camilla |\n| 17. | 9. | 15 | Butturini Angela |\n| 18. | 10. | 16 | Caci Rosanna |\n| 19. |  |  | Bavagnoli Marco |\n| 20. |  |  | Bavagnoli Ariberto |\n| 21. | 11. | 17 | Cambi\u00e9 Attilio |\n| 22. |  |  | Cambi\u00e9 Paola |\n| 23. |  |  | Seramondi Franca |\n| 24. | 12. | 20 | Carlotti Luciano |\n| 25. |  |  | Carlotti Gabriele |\n| 26. |  |  | Carlotti Roberto |\n| 27. | 13. | 21 | Casasola Enea |\n| 28. | 14. | 22 | Cassin Mario |\n| 29. | 15. | 23 | Catini Michela |\n| 30. | 16. | 24 | Cavati Eugenio |\n| 31. | 17. | 25 | Coppola Franco |\n| 32. |  |  | Mogliati Maria |\n| 33. | 18. | 26 | D\u2019Altilia Cinzia |\n| 34. | 19. | 29 | Di Gregorio Giovanni |\n| 35. | 20. | 30 | Di Lullo Arnaldo |\n| 36. |  |  | Di Lullo Maria Lucia |\n| 37. |  |  | Di Lullo Maria Letizia |\n| 38. | 21. | 31 | Draghi Giuseppe |\n| 39. |  |  | Draghi Luigi |\n| 40. |  |  | Draghi Rosa |\n| 41. | 22. | 32 | Edil Mari S.r.l - Camaroli Celso |\n| 42. | 23. | 33 | Evangelisti Michele |\n| 43. | 24. | *3 Abis* | Ghezzi Francesco Conti Maria Luigia |\n| 44. |  |  |  |\n| 45. | 25. | 35 | Giana Marisa |\n| 46. |  |  | De Mattei Andrea |\n| 47. | 26. | 36 | Giordano Francesco Paolo |\n| 48. |  |  | Capozzoli Rosa |\n| 49. | 27. | 38 | Greuter Giovanni |\n| 50. |  |  | Lomonaco Giuseppina |\n| 51. | 28. | 40 | Laurino Claudio |\n| 52. | 29. | 41 | Marchi Guido |\n| 53. |  |  | Brunelli Valeria |\n| 54. | 30. | 42 | Marini Pi era |\n| 55. |  |  | Marini Marisa |\n| 56. | 31. | 43 | Martelli Fabio |\n| 57. | 32. | 44 | Marzi lliana |\n| 58. |  |  | Bracchi Bruno |\n| 59. | 33. | 45 | Mazzone Vito |\n| 60. |  |  | Uglietti Maria Cristina |\n| 61. | 34. | 46 | Mengoli Cesarino |\n| 62. |  |  | Scazzieri Angela Gabriella |\n| 63. | 35. | 49 | Padovani Piera |\n| 64. | 36. | 51 | Paolini Colombo |\n| 65. |  |  | Paolini Giulio |\n| 66. | 37. | 52 | Peschiera Claudio |\n| 67. |  |  | Gennari Silvia |\n| 68. |  |  | Peschiera Gabriele |\n| 69. |  |  | Peschiera Francesco |\n| 70. | 38. | 53 | Podesti Alberto |\n| 71. |  |  | Striani Camilla |\n| 72. | 39. | 54 | Protti Maria Teresa |\n| 73. |  |  | Santini Giancarla |\n| 74. | 40. | 55 | Romoli Romano |\n| 75. | 41. | 56 | Ronchi Teresa |\n| 76. |  |  | Valenti Ronchi Gianlucio |\n| 77. | 42. | 58 | Salvatorelli Vincenzo |\n| 78. |  |  | Peschiutta Franca |\n| 79. |  |  | Salvatorelli Annarita |\n| 80. | 43. | 59 | Salvi Renato |\n| 81. | 44. | 60 | Saviotti Franco |\n| 82. |  |  | Boattini Ebe |\n| 83. | 45. | 61 | Solitro Gabriele |\n| 84. | 46. | 62 | Solitro Leonardo |\n| 85. | 47. | 64 | Tedeschi Enos |\n| 86. | 48. | 65 | Toccalini Sergio |\n| 87. |  |  | Maggioni Giuseppina |\n| 88. |  |  | Maggioni Carlo |\n| 89. |  |  | Giusertoli Angela |\n| 90. | 49. | 66 | Tramontana Federico |\n\n***c) Implications of discontinuance for the allocation of costs***\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n348.\n\nPursuant to the Respondent\u2019s letter of 17 September 2012, the Tribunal is requested to order that the Respondent and the Claimants subject to discontinuance under the terms of the afore-mentioned letter bear the costs of the proceedings equally and that each of them bear their own costs.\n\n349.\n\nThe Tribunal considers the allocation of costs proposed by the Respondent to be reasonable. As convincingly stated in the *Abaclat* case166, the Claimants were the ones who initiated the present proceedings; hence, they should bear, at least, partly the arbitration costs. At the same time, the Respondent\u2019s 2010 Exchange Offer played a certain role in Claimants\u2019 decision to continue, or to withdraw from, the present proceedings. Thus, both sides bear an equal share of the cost burden, and, therefore, the Tribunal accepts the cost allocation as suggested by the Respondent so that the Respondent and the Claimants subject to discontinuance shall each bear half of the arbitration costs and bear their own costs.\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 631.\n\n350.\n\nGiven the fact that due to the discontinuance in regard to 29 Claimants, a quarter of the initial 119 Claimants leave the case while 90 Claimants, i.e. three quarters, remain in the proceedings, the Tribunal finds that the allocation of costs shall be based on the following principles.\n\n351.\n\nAs regards arbitration costs, the Tribunal finds it appropriate that a quarter (25 %) of the arbitration costs from the beginning of the proceedings until the taking effect of the discontinuance (i.e. 8 February 2013) are to be attributed to the proceedings between the Respondent and those Claimants subject to discontinuance, and thus should be equally borne by the Respondent and those Claimants. The Tribunal reserves the decision on the rest of the arbitration costs to the merits phase of the proceedings.\n\n352.\n\nIn a similar vein, the Tribunal finds that a quarter (25 %) of each Party\u2019s own costs from the beginning of the proceedings until 8 February 2013 is attributable to the proceedings between the Claimants who are subject to discontinuance and the Respondent, and thus should be borne by the Respondent and the Claimants subject to discontinuance, respectively, while reserving the decision on the rest of the Parties\u2019 costs to the merits phase of the proceedings.\n\n353.\n\nThe Tribunal will proceed to an exact allocation of the costs attributable to the Claimants subject to discontinuance and the Respondent in a separate Procedural Order.\n\n***d) Renaming of the case***\n-----------------------------\n\n354.\n\nIn the light of the discontinuance of proceedings regarding several Claimants, notably including Giordano Alpi, i.e. the first original Claimant in alphabetical order, the Tribunal decides to rename the present proceedings *\"Ambiente Ufficio S.p.A, and others v. Argentine Republic\",* Ambiente Ufficio S.p.A, being the next Claimant in alphabetical order.\n\n**IV. EXISTENCE OF A LEGAL DISPUTE DIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF AN INVESTMENT**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**A. Positions of the Parties**\n-------------------------------\n\n**1. Contentions by Respondent**\n--------------------------------\n\n***a) The relationship of Art. 25 of the ICSID Convention and Art. 1 of the Argentina-Italy BIT***\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n355.\n\nRespondent submits that the term \"investment\" in Art. 25 of the ICSID Convention must be interpreted autonomously, i.e. independently of the definition of an investment in the respective clause of the applicable BIT. The criteria of Art. 25 of the Convention are objective in nature. These objective requirements cannot be overridden by the parties, whether by way of their consent under a BIT nor otherwise. Hence, there cannot be a broader definition of the term \"investment\" than that included in the ICSID Convention.\n\n356.\n\nThus, a *double-barreled test* regarding the notion of investment must apply in order to grant an ICSID tribunal jurisdiction *ratione materiae (R I \u00a7\u00a7 144-146; R II \u00a7 224).* In order for a protected \"investment\" to exist, each and all of the requirements set forth in the ICSID Convention and - where appropriate - the applicable BIT have to be fulfilled. This is the double-barrelled test: an aggregate of the two sets of requirements *(R III \u00a7\u00a7 118, 119).* Prior to the analysis under the BIT, the Tribunal must determine whether, under the ICSID Convention, there is an investment of the kind to which protection is afforded. The applicable BIT merely supplements Art. 25 of the ICSID Convention for the purpose of determining the competence of the Tribunal *(R II \u00a7 220).* Respondent points out in this regard that Claimants themselves have recognized the double-barreled test before the Tribunal even though they attempt to reduce the scope of such recognition *(RIII\u00a7 119; Trp. 126/4).*\n\n***b) The security entitlements in question do not qualify as investment under Art. 25 of the ICSID Convention***\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n357.\n\nRespondent contends that the Claimants\u2019 alleged \"investment\" does not satisfy the objective criteria required under the ICSID Convention and is therefore not protected under this Convention *(RI\u00a7 143).*\n\n**(1) The investment in the present case**\n------------------------------------------\n\n358.\n\nAs a general matter, Respondent endorses the statement of Professor Abi-Saab in his Dissenting Opinion in the *Abaclat* case that an ICSID tribunal cannot only look at the economics of a transaction without taking into consideration its legal framework and structure in order to determine whether it qualifies as a protected investment or not *(R IV p. 13).*\n\n359.\n\nIn this context, Respondent insists that the Claimants hold \"security entitlements\" and not \"bonds\" *(RI \u00a7 140).* Argentina\u2019s bond issuances are transactions typical and inherent to capital or securities markets where Argentina made a single issuance to the bond underwriters who made a single payment for a global amount to Argentina. As Claimants are not the bondholders themselves, they only have, at best, indirect interests in the globally registered bonds *(R II \u00a7\u00a7 203, 204).* The individual participants\u2019 positions with respect to globally registered bonds are known as \"security entitlements\". The holders of security entitlements have no direct relationship with the bond issuer (in this case, the Respondent) or with the bond underwriter *(R II \u00a7 205).* That those people who purchase bonds in the retail market are generally called \"bond holders\" in common language does not change the fact that only parties that made contributions to the Argentine treasury were the initial purchasers, i.e. the underwriters *(RII\u00a7 261).*\n\n360.\n\nIn the Respondent\u2019s opinion, when the Italian banks sold Claimants individual portions of their large security holdings, Claimants thus acquired a new security entitlement separate from the global bond, an entitlement which was created specifically at the time of such operation to which Argentina neither was nor could have been a party *(R II \u00a7 207).* Furthermore, the entitlements acquired by Claimants are not a loan by Claimants to the Argentine Republic or any other party since the Claimants have never entered into any agreement with Argentina *(R II \u00a7 209).*\n\n361.\n\nEach Italian banks\u2019 sales of security entitlements to Claimants were a matter entirely between themselves and Claimants and did not affect the bank\u2019s previously purchased interests in Argentine bonds, which continue to be held unchanged in the bank\u2019s account at the relevant depository or other financial intermediary. The banks\u2019 sales of the secondary entitlements to their customers may have been the consequence of their earlier decision to purchase interests in Argentine bonds, but only in the sense that one event -time wise - followed the other *(RI\u00a7 214).*\n\n**(2) The concept of \"investment\" in Art. 25 of the ICSID Convention**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n362.\n\nIn the Respondent\u2019s opinion, the fact that no definition of the term \"investment\" has been included in the ICSID Convention does not mean that the term is not to be interpreted *(R II \u00a7 216).* In this regard, most tribunals and international scholars have chosen the VCLT as a tool. Such interpretation should be made in good faith, taking into consideration the consequences of the undertakings that the parties may have reasonably and legitimately predicted or imagined *(RII\u00a7\u00a7 227, 228).* In particular, the Respondent refutes Claimants\u2019 position that the prevailing, and most reasonable, view is that the term \"investment\" in Art. 25 of the ICSID Convention must be interpreted broadly *(R II \u00a7 234).*\n\n363.\n\nInasmuch as Claimants rely on the *Fedax* case in support of the proposition that financial instruments are generally considered investments under the ICSID Convention, Respondent points out that the promissory notes at issue in *Fedax* were not the kind of investments that \"come in for quick gains and leave immediately thereafter, i.e. \u2018volatile capital\u2019\". In contrast, the acquisition, sale or termination of Claimants\u2019 security entitlements can be conducted instantaneously on secondary markets *(R II \u00a7 213).* Furthermore, the Respondent argues that including financial holdings which are traded on stock markets within the scope of protection of the ICSID Convention would be contrary to the aims and purposes of the Convention. In particular, causing any right deriving from the issuance of security entitlements related to debt securities traded on capital markets to be subject to the provisions of the extensive network of BITs would hinder the issuance, circulation, payment and restructuring thereof *(RIII \u00a7\u00a7 145, 148).*\n\n**(3) Relevance and application of the so-called \"Salini test\"**\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n364.\n\nRespondent urges the Tribunal to apply the so-called *Salini* test in order to determine whether the Centre has jurisdiction in the present case *(R II \u00a7 236).* The *Salini* and subsequent Tribunals have identified defining, and in their view mandatory, criteria of \"investment\", namely a certain duration, regularity of profits and return, risk, a substantial commitment, and a significant contribution to the host State\u2019s economy *(RI\u00a7 151).* In the present case, in the Respondent\u2019s opinion, these elements are not only deficient, but completely absent *(RII\u00a7\u00a7 250, 288).*\n\n365.\n\nFirst, Respondent contends that, according to the pertinent ICSID case-law, the minimum length of time that a project should take in order to be considered an investment under the ICSID Convention is between two and five years *(Tr p. 137/18).* Respondent points out that the alleged \"investment\" made by the initial purchasers lasted only a few seconds, however, because they only acquired the bonds when they were certain that these could give rise to security entitlements which could be sold immediately after the issuance thereof *(R III \u00a7\u00a7 127, 128; Tr p. 138/12).* Furthermore, the nature of purchases of security entitlements on the secondary market is that they need not be held for any particular duration, but are readily tradable and are often bought and sold on the secondary market within seconds *(R I \u00a7\u00a7 158-160).* While Claimants argue that the duration of the bond issuance should be taken into consideration, the Respondent submits that the time that must be considered is the alleged duration of the participation of each Claimant in a security entitlement, not the expiration date of the bonds *(R II \u00a7\u00a7 263, 269).* More specifically, the Respondent points to at least eight Claimants who purchased their security entitlements after the payment date had passed *(R II \u00a7 305; Tr p. 140/17).*\n\n366.\n\nSecondly, under ICSID case-law, the project should provide regularity of profit and return in order to qualify as an investment under the ICSID Convention. Although Respondent admits that the holder of security entitlements may have the right to periodically be paid certain amounts of principal and interest, the intrinsic characteristic of secondary market transactions and the fact that by nature security entitlements are easily and recurrently transferred, imply that there is no regularity of profit and return for Claimants *(R I \u00a7\u00a7 167, 168; R II \u00a7\u00a7 279, 280).* From the information provided by the Claimants, there are cases in which they have acquired security entitlements just a few months and even a few days before the maturity dates. If interests were paid annually, holders of these security entitlements did not enjoy of any kind of regularity of profits and returns. According to the Respondent, the most foreseeable source of profit for the Claimants is speculation on the spread between the buying and selling prices *169,* *170).*\n\n367.\n\nThirdly, according to the Respondent, the payment obligations deriving from the Claimants\u2019 security entitlements are not tied to the success of any commercial undertaking or capital project. The risk which Claimants might have incurred when purchasing security entitlements in Argentina\u2019s foreign debt is inherent in the transaction and is no more than the ordinary commercial risk assumed by other persons involved in this kind of purely commercial transaction. Yet, an ordinary commercial contract cannot be considered an \"investment\" *(R I \u00a7\u00a7 163-165; R II \u00a7\u00a7 272, 274).* If the risk of default were sufficient to qualify as the risk necessary for the existence of an investment protected under the Convention, that would be tantamount to holding that mere nonpayment of a contract gives rise to a claim under a treaty, a proposition that is unanimously rejected *(RII \u00a7 272).* In addition, in Respondent\u2019s eyes, major players of the financial world were well aware that Argentina had defaulted several times in the second half of the 20th century, and this issue was considered at the time of issuance of the bonds at stake in the present proceeding *(R II \u00a7 275).*\n\n368.\n\nFourthly, as regards the requirement of substantial commitment, Respondent criticizes that the Claimants only provided to the Tribunal the nominal value of the security entitlements they bought, but not the price paid by each Claimant when purchasing the security entitlements *(RI \u00a7 156; RII \u00a7 258).* Respondent further criticizes that Claimants seek to add up their individual contributions and that the time that should be considered in determining the existence of an investment is the duration of the financial instruments from the issuance of the relevant bonds up to their maturity *(R II \u00a7\u00a7 252, 254).* In contrast, in the Respondent\u2019s submission, each Claimant must have an investment. This requirement may not be satisfied by the accumulation of claims of a group of several people that are not legally related *(R II \u00a7 262).*\n\n369.\n\nFifthly, in view of the requirement of a significant contribution to Argentina\u2019s economic development, the proceeds of secondary market transaction accrue to the selling dealers and investors, but no payment was made by the Claimants to the Respondent *(RI\u00a7 175).* Claimants\u2019 purchases did not involve transfer of funds into the territory of Argentina nor benefited Argentina\u2019s economy. The alleged economic benefit of Argentina when issuing the bonds does not derive from Claimants\u2019 purchases of security entitlements, but from the contracts which Argentina executed with the issuing banks and the underwriters *(RI\u00a7 177; RII \u00a7 283).* Inasmuch as the majority decision in the *Abaclat* case considers that the funds transferred to the Respondent by placement agents are nothing but advances later transferred by individual investors and that the Claimants\u2019 funds were therefore ultimately made available to the Respondent, the majority, in the eyes of the Respondent, completely ignored the operation of sovereign debt placement, as described above *(R IV p. 14).*\n\n370.\n\nEven if it were conceded that each Claimant had made, with its payment to the selling third party, a contribution, the latter would still be of too small a magnitude to qualify as a \"contribution\" to the economic development of the Respondent in any relevant sense *(R II \u00a7\u00a7 284, 285).* In that regard, the Respondent argues that the Tribunal may not look to the whole global bond and regard it as a single investment *(R II \u00a7 253).* Rather the Tribunal needs to evaluate for each individual Claimant whether their purchase of security entitlements amounts to a significant contribution *(RII\u00a7 262).*\n\n371.\n\nFurthermore, in the Respondent\u2019s submission, it is impossible to trace the proceeds which Respondent received from the underwriters buying the bonds. In particular, Claimants cannot prove if the proceeds of a particular bonds issuance were used to finance increasing interest payments which have no lasting value for the development of the economy *(RII\u00a7 286).*\n\n***c) The security entitlements in question do not qualify as investment under Art. 1 of the Argentina-Italy BIT***\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**(1) The scope of the list in Art. 1 para. 1 lit. a-f of the BIT**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n372.\n\nRespondent submits that, first of all, Claimants\u2019 translation into English of Art. 1(1)(c) of the Argentina-Italy BIT is inaccurate. Neither the authentic Italian nor the Spanish version of the BIT include the term \"bond\". There is no reference to the term \"bond\" or \"security entitlement\", but only to \"obligations\" *(R I \u00a7 180; R III \u00a7 134).* In the Spanish language, \"obligaci\u00f3n\" and \"bono\" are two different terms with different meaning, with the term \"bono\" having a similar meaning to the term \"bonds\" in English *(R II \u00a7 292).*\n\n373.\n\nThe rationale of this drafting of the provision is that the Contracting Parties\u2019 intention was to exclude bonds from the scope of application of the Argentina-Italy BIT. Had Argentina and Italy considered bonds as an investment, they would have included them within the definition of investment in Art. 1 of the BIT and would have used the word \"bonos\" in Spanish and \"titoli obbligazionari\" in Italian *(RI\u00a7 186; RII\u00a7\u00a7 292, 296).* If Claimants\u2019 statement that in Italian there is no specific word to make reference to what in English is called a \"bond\" were correct, the fact that there is a distinction between the terms in Spanish and that the word for bonds in Spanish was not used, furthers the interpretation that \"obbligazioni\" should not be understood to be synonymous of \"bond\" *(RII\u00a7 293).*\n\n**(2) The requirements of the investment being made \"in the territory\" of the Respondent and of it being a \"foreign\" investment**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n374.\n\nRespondent states that, in the light of Art. 1 of the Argentina-Italy BIT, investments made outside the territory of the host State, i.e. Argentina, fall outside the scope of protection of the BIT *(R I \u00a7 209).* Respondent insists that the Claimants\u2019 security entitlements are not physically located in the territory of Argentina. This conclusion is reinforced by the fact that the Claimants\u2019 security entitlements were purchased and registered outside Argentine territory, that they are governed by foreign law and that they are enforceable in foreign jurisdictions. In this respect, Respondent contends that it did not, and could not, exercise any sovereign right in respect of Claimants\u2019 alleged \"investments\" since they were subject to foreign laws and jurisdictions *(RI \u00a7 215).*\n\n375.\n\nThe proposition that there exists no investment in Argentina\u2019s territory in the present case is, in the Respondent\u2019s eyes, further corroborated by the fact that the proceeds of Claimants\u2019 purchase of security entitlements did not accrue to the Respondent *(RI \u00a7 213; RII \u00a7\u00a7 351, 356).* In particular, the fact that the issuance of bonds might have benefited the Respondent and allowed it to refinance part of its foreign debt, does not mean that there is an investment in the Argentine territory protected by the Argentina-Italy BIT *(R* *II \u00a7 357).* Therefore, when acquiring security entitlements on the secondary market, Claimants did not make an investment in Argentine territory.\n\n376.\n\nIn sum, according to the Respondent, it is not possible for a bond that was issued outside Argentine territory, that is not subject to Argentine law, that is held by non-Argentine residents who acquired it in Italy, and registered in the accounts of banks located outside the Argentine Republic, to be considered as located within Argentine territory *(R III \u00a7 139; R Vp. 9).* As all the criteria and connecting factors (e.g. the place of performance, the forum selection clauses, the currency of payment, the residence of the intermediaries, etc.) were deliberately structured so as to have their *situs* outside Argentina, the alleged investment was not made in the territory of the Respondent and thus falls outside the scope of the jurisdiction *ratione materiae* of the Tribunal *(RIVp. 15).*\n\n377.\n\nFurthermore, Respondent contends that the Claimants\u2019 security entitlements are not an investment protected under the BIT because of the \"governing law clause\" in each bond prospectus, by virtue of which Claimants\u2019 securities are governed by different foreign (non-Argentine) domestic laws, and because the bonds were subject to the jurisdiction of foreign (non-Argentine) courts *(RI \u00a7 188; RII \u00a7 308).* At no time could Claimants have believed that they were making an investment in Argentina since their holding of security entitlements they acquired in Argentine debt was never governed by Argentine law or under the scope of Argentine authorities\u2019 jurisdiction *(R I \u00a7 193; R II \u00a7 310).* It is clear that the Argentina-Italy BIT only protects \"foreign investment\", i.e. investments made by a person of one Contracting Party in the territory of the other Contracting Party, and, as Respondent points out, the Claimants do not object to that proposition *(RI \u00a7 190; RII \u00a7 303).* Claimants\u2019 statement that foreign investment arises automatically in the event of a holding by a foreign person is wrong *(RII\u00a7 318).*\n\n**(3) The requirement of the investment being made \"in accordance with the laws\" of the Respondent**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n378.\n\nRespondent takes the position that the Claimants\u2019 purchases of security entitlements were in violation of Italian laws which govern the acquisition of the security entitlements at stake and were therefore not compatible with the \"in accordance with\" clause of Art. 1 of the Argentina-Italy BIT *(RI \u00a7 198).* Even in the absence of such language in the relevant treaty, investments made in violation of domestic or international law are not protected *(R I \u00a7 201; RII \u00a7 330; R III \u00a7 141).*\n\n379.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, the purpose of such clauses is not limited to excluding claims arising out of investments that were not recognized as legal under the host State\u2019s law when they were made. Rather, such clauses are an expression of international public policy which embodies the principle of the respect for law *(R II \u00a7 329).* That the illegality was committed by third parties, i.e. the banks, rather than the Claimants, is immaterial. What is decisive is not the investor\u2019s illegal conduct, but the illegality of the investment *(R II \u00a7 344).* It is further improper to distinguish between illegal investments made in good faith and those made in bad faith, since good faith investors may enforce their rights against the party who committed the illegality, i.e., in this case the Italian banks. The host State, however, is not obliged to protect investments that are in violation of the principle of conformity with law *(R II \u00a7 345).*\n\n380.\n\nItalian law is applicable to the present case because, pursuant to the terms of Art. 8 para. 7 of the Argentina-Italy BIT, the Tribunal shall make its decisions on the basis of the laws of Argentina, including its rules on conflict of laws, and the pertinent provisions of international law *(R I \u00a7 204; R II \u00a7\u00a7 322, 324; R III \u00a7 143).* Conversely, the Claimants\u2019 narrow statement that both Art. 8(7) of the BIT and Art. 42(1) of the ICSID Convention contemplate the law to be applied to the merits of the dispute and not the jurisdictional stage is wrong *(R II \u00a7 327).* In contrast, the Respondent underscores that Argentine law provides that the validity and nature of contracts executed outside the territory of Argentina, and the obligations that derive from those contracts, shall be governed by the laws of the place where the contract was executed, i.e. Italy *(RI \u00a7 205; Tr p. 144/21).*\n\n381.\n\nRespondent argues that Claimants bought their security entitlements not only in violation of the selling restrictions in the bond documents prohibiting the sale of security entitlements to unqualified, unsophisticated buyers, but also of those contained in Italian statutes *(R I \u00a7 207; R II \u00a7\u00a7 335, 336).* In particular, all the offering circulars concerning Italian Lira-denominated bonds contained selling restrictions relating specifically to the Italian territory that prohibited sales to retail customers like the Claimants *(R II \u00a7 340).* To underscore this point, the Respondent refers to the various cases brought against Italian banks in which Italian courts found that purchases of security entitlements by retail purchasers violated selling restrictions *(RII\u00a7 341).*\n\n**2. Contentions by Claimants**\n-------------------------------\n\n382.\n\nClaimants submit that the dispute in question is legal in nature, as required by Art. 25(1) of the ICSID Convention *(Request \u00a7\u00a7 73, 74).* They further contend that the requirement of the legal dispute \"arising directly out of an investment\", as laid down in the same provision, is met as well and that the instruments in question qualify as investments within the meaning of Art. 1 of the Argentina-Italy BIT *(Request \u00a7 78).*\n\n***a) The relationship of Art. 25 of the ICSID Convention and Art. 1 of the Argentina-Italy BIT***\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n383.\n\nClaimants summarize the main thrust of their reasoning, as follows (C *II \u00a7 85):* First of all, the investment must fit within the meaning of both the ICSID Convention and the relevant BIT. Contrary to Respondent\u2019s submission, Claimants do no ignore the need to meet the so-called *double barreled test.* Nor do the Claimants intimate that any transaction can be categorized as an investment (C *II \u00a7 81).* The notion of investment was not defined in the ICSID Convention since the drafters intended to avoid undue restrictions on the Contracting States\u2019 understanding of what should constitute an investment. As a result, in the absence of an objective definition of \"investment\" under the ICSID Convention, the \"investment\" requirement under Art. 25(1) of the Convention is primarily controlled by the parties and should not be interpreted separately or autonomously from the definition of investment in the relevant BIT *(C I \u00a7 210).* Arbitrators should therefore not impose fixed criteria to determine the existence of an investment under the Convention, but should rather refer for guidance to the \"typical characteristics\" or \"features\" of an investment identified by case-law and scholars.\n\n***b) The bonds in question qualify as investment under Art. 25 of the ICSID Convention***\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**(1) The investment in the present case**\n------------------------------------------\n\n384.\n\nWhile the Claimants do not consider the Respondent\u2019s description of the mechanisms for the issuance and circulation of financial instruments in today\u2019s world of indirect and centralized holding of paperless securities to be incorrect, they qualify it as irrelevant for the present case (C *II \u00a7 96).* In that regard, the Claimants argue that, in their opinion, the investment at stake in the present dispute is the overall loan which made funds available to finance Respondent\u2019s budgetary needs and which is represented by the bonds issued in respect thereof. Each Claimant holds a proportionate share of that investment corresponding to the face value of the bonds held by it (C *II \u00a7 83; C III \u00a7 91; Tr p. 186/5).* The \"security entitlements\" held by each one of the Claimants are simply the evidence of their entitlement to a proportionate share of the initial investment made in Argentina. As holders of title to the capital and interest in their proportionate share in the overall investment, i.e. the bonds issued by the Respondent, the Claimants are investors within the meaning of the ICSID Convention and the BIT (C *II \u00a7\u00a7 99, 103; C III \u00a7 93).*\n\n385.\n\nThe Claimants thus regard the issuance of negotiable bonds on the international financial markets, and not the subsequent purchases of security entitlements on the secondary market, as the relevant transaction for the purpose of qualification as an investment *(CI \u00a7 280).* Accordingly, the applicable doctrine is that of the \"general unity of an investment operation\" (C *III \u00a7\u00a7 129 et seq.; Trp. 499/3).* Claimants contend that the initial purchase by the banks and underwriters of the bonds issued by Argentina is indisputably an investment which satisfies all the requirements of the definition of investment. Even assuming that the purchase of a portion of the bond issues, taken alone, might not qualify as an investment under Art. 25 of the ICSID Convention, the present dispute would nonetheless \"relate to\" an investment, since each transaction is an integral part of the overall operation which qualifies as investment (C *III \u00a7 136).*\n\n386.\n\nBy its nature, when a bond is issued, it is underwritten by a multitude of underwriters and is placed on the secondary market on which it circulates. If placement and circulation of the bonds on the secondary market were not permitted, there would have not been no issuance of a bond. The Respondent would never have been able to satisfy its need for foreign capital through the issuance of a bond, had there not been the opportunity for the initial purchasers to resell on the secondary market (C *III 134; Tr p. 184/1).* By specifically choosing to finance itself by issuing bonds, Respondent knew that its bonds would circulate and be transferred innumerable times in fractions of the initial amount of the issue (C *III \u00a7 151).*\n\n387.\n\nThe subsequent circulation of the bonds on the secondary market evidently did not deprive the initial \"investment\" of its quality, nor did it modify its nature (C *II \u00a7 97; C III \u00a7 148; Tr pp. 128/11, 506/19).* In particular, Claimants refute Respondent\u2019s formalistic argument which would essentially imply that the initial investment loses its nature as an investment simply by virtue of one of its natural, essential and clearly intended features, i.e. circulation on the secondary market (C *II\u00a7 104).* In particular, it is immaterial that the banks and brokers which purchased the bonds upon their issue then resold them \"in their own name and on their own behalf\u2019 to the subsequent purchasers. Under investment treaty law there is no limitation on the possibility for the subsequent acquirer of an initial investment to benefit from the protection of an investment protection treaty (C *II \u00a7\u00a7 98, 102).*\n\n388.\n\nIn sum, Claimants emphasize that there is no contradiction, as suggested by the Respondent, in considering the position of the *individual* Claimants in order to identify them and to determine the amount owed to each one and, at the same time, in looking at the *overall* transaction and the initial investment as a whole for the purposes of establishing whether there exists an investment in terms of the ICSID Convention and the Argentina-Italy BIT (C *II \u00a7 101; C III \u00a7 123; Tr p. 512/19).*\n\n**(2) The concept of \"investment\" in Art. 25 of the ICSID Convention**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n389.\n\nThe Claimants submit - and consider this to be the prevailing view both in the pertinent case-law and in academic writings - that, due to the lack of a definition of investment in the ICSID Convention, the investment requirement under Art. 25 must be interpreted broadly and having primary regard to the intention of the parties in each individual circumstance (C *210, 219; C III \u00a7 119).* According to the Claimants, ample ICSID jurisprudence and legal doctrine demonstrate that the notion of \"investment\" under the Convention encompasses a broad variety of situations, including acquisitions of shares, payments towards a potential concession as well as loans, including bonds *(Request \u00a7 75).*\n\n390.\n\nIn particular, Claimants contend that there can be no doubt that financial instruments, and hence the bonds held by the Claimants, are investments for the purposes of the ICSID Convention *(C I \u00a7\u00a7 237 et seq.; C II \u00a7 91; C III \u00a7 160).* In Claimants\u2019 view, the Respondent does not deny this conclusion nor does it challenge the relevance of the caselaw or the doctrinal opinions relied upon by the Claimants (C *II \u00a7 92).* Inasmuch as the Dissenting Opinion of Professor Abi-Saab in the *Abaclat* case states that financial products such as bonds should be \"excluded *per se\"* from the protection granted by the ICSID Convention, this view, in the Claimants\u2019 opinion, lacks any foundation and is unsupported by any authority (C *IV \u00a7 30).* Moreover, for purposes of jurisdiction, bonds are similar to portfolio investment in shares for which ICSID jurisdiction is uncontested *(C III \u00a7 137).*\n\n**(3) Relevance and application of the so-called** ***Salini*** **test**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n391.\n\nThe Claimants do not consider fixed criteria to be compatible with the absence of an objective definition of \"investment\" from the ICSID Convention. In particular, they contend that the Respondent\u2019s position according to which the criteria of the so-called *Salini* test - namely substantial commitment, duration, assumption of risk, regularity of profit and return, and significance for the host State\u2019s economic development - should be elevated to jurisdictional requirements, is untenable for a variety of reasons (C *221, 222; CIII\u00a790).*\n\n392.\n\nTo begin with, ICSID tribunals are not bound by earlier decisions *(CI \u00a7 223).* Moreover, it is broadly recognized that the weight attached by certain tribunals to the *Salini* test is undeserved *(CI \u00a7\u00a7 224 et seq.).* It is not considered the controlling test by the prevailing view in investment treaty jurisprudence and amongst scholars and, if used at all, is applied with considerable flexibility. In particular, it is not required that all of the test\u2019s elements be satisfied in each case (C *II \u00a7 87; C III \u00a7\u00a7 118,* 119). For the overwhelming body of case-law and scholarly opinion, whether a particular transaction can be characterized as an investment depends on a more sophisticated and case-by-case approach taking into account a broader variety of elements (C *I \u00a7 235).* In particular, the agreement of the Contracting States of a BIT on the definition of investment is entitled to \"great deference\" *(C III \u00a7 118).*\n\n393.\n\nFurthermore, even if the *Salini* criteria were, for the sake of argument, accepted as mandatory, they are satisfied in the present case *(CI \u00a7\u00a7 244, 245; CII \u00a7 87; C III \u00a7\u00a7 90, 121; Trp. 496/22).*\n\n394.\n\nFirst, the bonds in question are the result of a transaction whereby Argentina issued massive amounts of negotiable debt instruments (i.e. bonds) to finance its debt and placed them on the international markets. The individual Claimants have all acquired a portion of these issuances. The overall capital outlays by the bondholders constitute a gigantic financial commitment on the part of the bondholders and thus meet the prerequisite of a substantial commitment in capital. Respondent\u2019s insistence at looking at the amount actually paid by each Claimant is patently absurd (C *I \u00a7\u00a7 247, 248).*\n\n395.\n\nSecondly, the Claimants argue that their investment satisfies the element of duration because the relevant parameter is not the period for which each individual Claimant has held the bonds purchased by it, but the duration of the relevant bond issue. The average interval between the bonds\u2019 date of issuance and the date of maturity is approximately 8.2 years *(CI \u00a7\u00a7 249, 251).*\n\n396.\n\nThirdly, Claimants refute Respondent\u2019s argument that the purchase of the bonds only involved an ordinary commercial risk since Argentina\u2019s obligations to repay the loans did not depend on the success of any commercial undertaking or capital project and since Claimants\u2019 risk was no different from that of any commercial contract between creditor and debtor (C *I \u00a7 252).* In contrast, Claimants contend that the risks of sovereign borrowing are fundamentally different from those of dealing with an ordinary commercial counter-party, notably in the form of the State borrower altering the terms of its obligations to the detriment of the creditors by means of a sovereign act *(CI \u00a7 254).*\n\n397.\n\nFourthly, Claimants also object to the allegation that their bonds do not satisfy the condition of regularity of profits and returns, inasmuch as the investments provided for a regularity of returns, viz. the periodic interest payments. Claimants submit that it is irrelevant at which moment each Claimant acquired its respective bonds; they rather want to look to the overall conditions of the bond issues *(CI \u00a7\u00a7 258, 261).*\n\n398.\n\nFinally, Claimants deem it impossible to dispute that their investment contributed to Argentina\u2019s economic development. Accordingly, Respondent is mistaken when it contends that the amount paid by the Claimants to purchase the bonds was not invested in Argentina. Instead, regard must be had to the original proceeds of the issuance of the bond where there can be no doubt that those went entirely and directly to Argentina\u2019s Treasury *(CI \u00a7\u00a7 263, 264).*\n\n***c) The bonds in question qualify as investment under Art. 1 of the Argentina-Italy BIT***\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**(1) The scope of the list in Art. l(1)(a)-(f) of the BIT**\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n399.\n\nIn the Claimants\u2019 view, Art. 1(1)(c) of the Argentina-Italy BIT (\"bonds, public or private securities [...]\") expressly contemplates that State-issued bonds and other public instruments of debt must be considered an investment for the purposes of the BIT *(Request \u00a7 76).* The Italian word \"obbligazioni\" is the (only) word for bonds, and \"obligaciones\" is the Spanish word for that term so that the proper English translation is \"bonds\" *(CI \u00a7 269).* This is confirmed by the most current and authoritative dictionaries *(CI \u00a7 273; C III \u00a7 96).* Furthermore, this becomes manifest in Directive 2004/39/EC on markets in financial instruments which uses, in its authentic texts, \"bonds\" in English, \"obbligazioni\" in Italian and \"obligaciones\" in Spanish *(C II \u00a7 110).*\n\n400.\n\nRespondent errs in its submission that the correct translation of the term into English is \"obligations\" *(C I \u00a7 271).* While it is true that \"obbligazioni\" and \"obligaciones\" also have the broader meaning of \"obligations\", the provisions of the BIT must be read in context. This makes clear that the juxtaposition of the term \"obbligazioni/obligaciones\" to \"titoli pubblici o privati/titulos p\u00fablicos o privados\" (public or private securities) intended to refer to the other meaning of \"obbligazioni\"/\"obligaciones\", i.e. \"bonds\" (C *I \u00a7274).*\n\n401.\n\nThe Claimants see their position confirmed by the fact that the Respondent\u2019s witnesses used the terms interchangeably (C *III \u00a7\u00a7 93, 96).* Moreover, Argentina\u2019s 2010 Exchange Offer specifically labels the bonds at issue interchangeably as \"obbligazioni\" and \"titoli\" in Italian, \"bonds\" and \"securities\" in English and \"t\u00edtulos\" and \"bonos\" in Spanish. Furthermore, Respondent\u2019s own counsel repeatedly referred to bonds as \"t\u00edtulos\" and holders of security entitlements as \"bondholders\" (C *III \u00a7 100).*\n\n402.\n\nEven if Respondent\u2019s textual argument were conceded and the word did not mean \"bonds\" in this context, but simply \"obligations\", bonds - as being obligations - would still be included in this term (C *III \u00a7 98).* Furthermore, in any case, they would be covered by the catch-all expression at the end of Art. l(1)(c) of the BIT, i.e. \"any other right to benefits or services of an economic value, as well as capitalized income\" *(CI \u00a7 276; C III \u00a7 96).* Claimants emphasize that this argument was not contested by Respondent (C *II \u00a7 112).*\n\n403.\n\nFinally, bonds are in any event covered by the language of the catch-all clause of Art. l(1)(f) of the BIT which provides that the definition of investment includes \"any right having an economic value conferred by law or contract\" *(Request \u00a7 77; CI \u00a7 277; C III \u00a7 96).* Also this argument was not contested by the Respondent, as pointed out by the Claimants *(C II \u00a7 112).*\n\n**(2) The requirements of the investment being made \"in the territory\" of the Respondent and of it being a \"foreign\" investment**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n404.\n\nClaimants refute Respondent\u2019s argument that the bonds are not protected by the BIT because they do not constitute an investment made \"in the territory\" of Argentina, as required by the chapeau of Art. 1(1) of the Argentina-Italy BIT as well as by its Preamble and Art. 1(2). In the Claimants\u2019 view, what is relevant here is the initial transaction, i.e. the issuance of negotiable bonds on the international financial markets, not the subsequent purchases of the bonds on the secondary markets *(CI \u00a7 280).*\n\n405.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, it is impossible to reason with regard to bonds as one would reason with reference to a piece of land or an industrial plant or a mine. When it comes to money, regard can only be had to who obtains the benefit of it. Hence, when considering where the investment was made, one must take into account the destination of the proceeds of the bond issuances, i.e. the beneficiary of the funds in question, and those undisputedly went to the benefit of the Respondent *(CI \u00a7 281; CII \u00a7 114; Tr p. 191/22).* Contrary to the position taken by Professor Abi-Saab\u2019s Dissenting Opinion in the *Abaclat* case, it is not merely an \"assumption\" that the funds made available to the Respondent contributed to the country\u2019s economic development, since the proceeds of the bonds issuances were included in Argentina\u2019s official budget and since the law of Argentina requires that the purpose of each financing must be authorized and specified by the law *(CIV\u00a7\u00a745, 47).*\n\n406.\n\nIn that regard, Claimants consider it irrelevant that the Claimants\u2019 money did not go directly into Argentina\u2019s coffers since that is intrinsic to the circulation of securities on the secondary market and does not detract from Respondent being the sole beneficiary of the investment (C *III \u00a7 106).* In addition, it is irrelevant that the funds involved were not physically transferred into the territory of the beneficiary State (C *III \u00a7 107)* and that the bonds are not physically held in the territory of Argentina, since, even when represented by physical instruments, they are by definition held by the holder (C *I \u00a7 281).* It is further irrelevant whether the Claimants had, or could have, actually believed that they were making an investment in Argentina. For one, the investor\u2019s belief is not an element which comes into consideration for the purpose of determining whether an investment is protected under the BIT. Furthermore, regard must be had to the initial investment and not to the subsequent purchases on the secondary market (C *II \u00a7\u00a7 116, 117).*\n\n407.\n\nMoreover, Claimants do not agree with the analysis in Professor Abi-Saab\u2019s Dissenting Opinion in the *Abaclat* case that the territoriality requirement in Art. 1 of the Argentina-Italy BIT cannot be \"proved or demonstrated, except by tracing [the investment] to a specific project, enterprise or activity in the territory\". In contrast, the Claimants second the *Abaclat* majority decision\u2019s approach which states that such \"specificity\" requirement is not contained in the Argentina-Italy BIT (C *IV\u00a7 43).*\n\n408.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, the provisions on governing law and jurisdiction over the bonds are not relevant for the determination whether the investment was made in Argentina. First, the law that governs the contractual relationship which is at the basis of the investment is immaterial for the purposes of determination whether an investment is covered by the BIT. Secondly, not even Respondent would probably dispute that an investment in a project physically located in Argentina was not made in its territory simply because the relevant contract was made subject to a foreign law or provided for the submission to the jurisdiction of foreign courts (C *I \u00a7 287, 288; Tr p. 192/6).* In spite of the applicable choice of law and forum clauses, the Claimants were very much subjecting themselves to the law of the sovereign issuer or at least running the risk that the foreign State would use its sovereign powers to interfere with their investment, as actually happened *(CI \u00a7 290).*\n\n409.\n\nAs regards the related argument that the investments in question are not \"foreign\", Claimants insist that the only decisive criterion to identify a foreign investment is the nationality of the investors *(CI \u00a7 293; CII \u00a7 115; C III \u00a7 109).*\n\n**(3) The requirement of the investment being made \"in accordance with the laws\" of the Respondent**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n410.\n\nIn Claimants\u2019 view, the Respondent\u2019s further defense that the investments in question are not \"in accordance with the laws and regulations\" of the host State, as required by the chapeau of Art. 1(1) of the Argentina-Italy BIT, is misconceived on several accounts (C *I \u00a7295).*\n\n411.\n\nFirst, the provision refers to the law of the host State, i.e. Argentina. The Respondent\u2019s attempt to bring Italian law into play via Art. 8(7) of the BIT and its reference to the host State\u2019s laws on conflict of laws is flawed since that provision contemplates the law to be applied to the merits of the dispute (similarly to Art. 42(1) of the ICSID Convention). Hence, the reference in Art. 1(1) of the BIT is to Argentine substantive law only, and Italian law is manifestly inapplicable (C *I \u00a7\u00a7 300, 302; C II \u00a7 120; C III \u00a7 112; Tr p. 195/18).*\n\n412.\n\nMoreover, even if it were conceded *arguendo* to the Respondent that Italian law applies, it is not relevant under Art. 1(1) of the BIT whether the sale of the bonds to the Claimants by Italian banks violated certain provisions of Italian law. What is relevant here is the legality of the investment, i.e. the \"contribution or asset invested [...] in the territory\" of the host State, not the transfers of the bonds on the secondary market *(CI \u00a7 296).*\n\n413.\n\nFurthermore, Claimants contend that whenever the illegality of an investment under the host State\u2019s law has been upheld, the illegality (i) was very serious, (ii) had been consciously committed by the investor at the expense of the host State, and (iii) had been committed upon admission of the investment in the host State, and not thereafter (C *I \u00a7 305).* According to the Claimants, none of these criteria is met in the present case. In particular, the purported illegality was committed at the expense of the Claimants and in no way harmed (or was intended to harm) the interests of the Respondent. The latter cannot now take advantage of a reputed illegality committed by a third party (C *I \u00a7 307; C II \u00a7 124; C III \u00a7 114).* Any violation of whatever rule which could have occurred in relation to the circulation of the investments remains entirely outside the scope of the present proceedings *(CI \u00a7 321).*\n\n414.\n\nAs regards, more specifically, the \"selling restrictions\" referred to by the Respondent, Claimants point out that the bonds themselves contained no limitation whatsoever as to legal or natural persons that can become the holders thereof. The only limitations were that the bonds could not be sold in Italy \"in a solicitation to the public at large\" which in fact never occurred and that the sale had to be conducted through appropriately authorized financial intermediaries (including banks) which was the case (C *I \u00a7\u00a7 310, 311; Tr p. 198/11).* Accordingly, there was no across-the-board prohibition on the sale of the bonds by financial intermediaries to private investors in Italy, in spite of a certain amount of litigation in Italy which, however, related to the specific circumstances of individual cases (C *I \u00a7\u00a7 312, 313).* In this context, Claimants contend that there is no contradiction between their position in this arbitration and their individual positions before the Italian courts, since the nature of the claims that the bondholders may have against the financial intermediaries is totally different from that of their claims against the Respondent *(C II \u00a7 122; C III \u00a7 115).*\n\n**B. Findings of the Tribunal**\n-------------------------------\n\n**1. The relevant provisions for the determination of the jurisdiction** ***ratione materiae***\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n415.\n\nThe Parties agree that the jurisdiction *ratione materiae* of the Centre and, for that matter, the competence of the Tribunal in the present case must be based on Art. 25(1) of the ICSID Convention and Art. 1(1) of the Argentina-Italy BIT. The scope of jurisdiction as deriving from these instruments and provisions is, however, contested between the Parties, as was also pointed out by the *Abaclat* Tribunal167 which found itself in a situation comparable to that of the present Tribunal insofar as the question of jurisdiction *ratione materiae* is concerned. In order to answer this question, the Tribunal considers it useful to first recall the pertinent legal provisions.\n\nSee *Abaclat* Decision, para. 251.\n\n416.\n\nPursuant to Art. 25(1) of the ICSID Convention, the Centre\u2019s jurisdiction *ratione materiae* \"shall extend to any legal dispute arising directly out of an investment\".\n\n417.\n\nFurthermore, Art. 1(1) of the Argentina-Italy BIT reads - under the heading \"definitions\" (\"definiciones\"/ \"definizioni\") - in its Spanish and Italian authentic versions:\n\nA los fines del presente Acuerdo:\n\n1. El t\u00e9rmino \"inversi\u00f3n\" designa, de conformidad con el ordenamiento jur\u00eddico del pa\u00eds receptor e independientemente de la forma jur\u00eddica elegida o de cualquier otro ordenamiento jur\u00eddico de conexi\u00f3n, todo aporte o bien invertido o reinvertido por personas f\u00edsicas o jur\u00eddicas de una Parte Contratante en el territorio de la otra, de acuerdo a las leyes y reglamentos de esta \u00faltima.\n\nEn este marco general, son considerados en particular como inversiones, aunque no en forma exclusiva:\n\na) bienes muebles e inmuebles, como tambi\u00e9n cualquier otro derecho \"in rem\", incluidos \u2014en cuanto sean utilizables para inversiones\u2014 los derechos reales de garant\u00eda sobre propiedad de terceros;\n\nb) acciones, cuotas societarias y toda otra forma de participaci\u00f3n a\u00fan minoritaria o indirecta en las sociedades constituidas en el territorio de una de las Partes Contratantes;\n\nc) obligaciones, t\u00edtulos p\u00fablicos o privados o cualquier otro derecho a prestaciones o servicios que tengan un valor econ\u00f3mico, como tambi\u00e9n las ganancias capitalizadas;\n\nd) cr\u00e9ditos directamente vinculados a una inversi\u00f3n, regularmente contra\u00eddos y documentados seg\u00fan las disposiciones vigentes en el pa\u00eds donde esa inversi\u00f3n sea realizada;\n\ne) derechos de autor, de propiedad industrial o intelectual \u2014tales como patentes de invenci\u00f3n; licencias; marcas registradas; secretos modelos y dise\u00f1os industriales\u2014, as\u00ed como tambi\u00e9n procedimientos t\u00e9cnicos, transferencias de conocimientos tecnol\u00f3gicos, nombres registrados y valor llave;\n\nf) cualquier derecho de tipo econ\u00f3mico conferido por ley o por contrato y cualquier licencia o concesi\u00f3n de acuerdo con las disposiciones vigentes que regulan estas actividades econ\u00f3micas, incluyendo la prospecci\u00f3n, cultivo, extracci\u00f3n y explotaci\u00f3n de los recursos naturales.\n\nAi fini del presente Accordo:\n\n1. Per investimento si intende, conformemente all\u2019ordinamento giuridico del Paese ricevente ed indipendamente dala forma giuridica prescelta o da qualsiasi altro ordinamento giuridico di riferimento, ogni conferimento o bene investito o reinvestito da persona f\u00edsica o giuridica di una Parte Contraente nel territorio dell\u2019altra, in conformit\u00e1 alie leggi e regolamenti di quest\u2019ultima.\n\nIn tale contesto di carattere generale, sono considerati specificamente come investimenti, anche se non in forma esclusiva:\n\na) b\u00e9ni mobile ed immobili, nonch\u00e9 ogni altro diritto in rem, compresi - per quanto impiegabili per investimento - i diritti reali di garanzia su propriet\u00e1 di terzi;\n\nb) azioni, quote societarie e ogni altra forma di partecipazione, anche se minoritaria o indiretta, in societ\u00e1 constituite nel territorio di un delle Parti Contraenti;\n\nc) obbligazioni, titoli pubblici o private o qualsiasi altro diritto per prestazioni o servizi che abbiano un valore econ\u00f3mico, come altresi redditi capitalizzati;\n\nd) crediti direttamente collegati ad un investimento, regolarmente assunti e documentati secondo le disposizioni vigenti nel Paese in cui tale investimento sia effettuato;\n\ne) diritti d\u2019autore, di propriet\u00e1 industrial od intellettuale - quali brevetti di invenzione; licenze; marchi registrati; segreti, modelli e designs industriali -nonch\u00e9 procedimenti tecnici, trasferimenti di conoscenze tecnologiche, denominazioni reg\u00edstrate e l\u2019avviamento;\n\nf) ogni diritto di natura econ\u00f3mica conferito per legge o per Contratto, nonch\u00e9 ogni licenza e concessione rilasciata in conformit\u00e1 a disposizioni vigenti per l\u2019esercizio delle relative attivit\u00e0 economiche, c\u00f3mprese quelle di prospezione, coltivazione, estrazione e sfruttamento di risorse naturali.\n\n418.\n\nIn its unofficial English translation168, the provision reads:\n\nFor the purpose of this Agreement:\n\n1. The term \"investment\" shall mean, in conformity with the legal system of the host State and independently from the legal form adopted or from any other connected legal system, any contribution or asset invested or reinvested by physical or juridical persons of one Contracting Party in the territory of the other, in accordance with the laws and regulations of the latter.\n\nWithin this general context, the following are specifically, but not exclusively, considered to be investments:\n\na. movable and immovable property, and any other right *in rem,* including, to the extent they may be used as investments, security interests over the property of third parties;\n\nb. shares, equity interests or any other form of holding, even if a minority or indirect interest, in companies organized in the territory of one of the Contracting Parties;\n\nc. [Claimants: bonds] [Respondent: obligations], public or private securities or any other right [Claimants: for performances] [Respondent: to benefits] or services [Claimants: that have] [Respondent: with] an economic value, [Claimants: including also] [Respondent: as well as] capitalized income;\n\nd. credits directly related to an investment, regularly entered into and documented pursuant to the provisions in force of the State in which said investment is made;\n\ne. copyrights, intellectual or industrial property-including patents, licenses, registered, trademarks, trade secrets and industrial designs-as well as technical procedures, transfer or technological know-how, trade names and goodwill;\n\nf. [Claimants: any right having an economic value conferred by law or contract] [Respondent: any right of an economic nature granted by law or by contract], and any license or concession in accordance with provisions in force regulating such economic activities, including prospect, cultivation, extraction, and exploitation of natural resources.\n\nSee Annex RA 147 for the translation provided by the Respondent; see *Request \u00a7\u00a7 76, 77* for the alternative translation offered by the Claimants.\n\n419.\n\nWhile there is no disagreement between the Parties as to the *legal* character of the present dispute, as required by Art. 25(1) of the ICSID Convention, the notion of \"investment\" has become the object of a heated controversy in the case at hand. Art. 1(1) of the Argentina-Italy BIT contains a legal definition of the term \"investment\" \"[f]or the purpose of this Agreement\", and Art. 25(1) of the ICSID Convention calls for a (legal) dispute \"arising directly out of investment\" for it to be covered by the jurisdiction of the Centre.\n\n420.\n\nThus, the very essence of the contention between the Parties in regard to jurisdiction *ratione materiae* is the question how Art. 25 of the ICSID Convention and Art. 1 of the Argentina-Italy BIT interact and what legal implications the use of the term \"investment\" in both of these provisions may have. As concerns the relationship between the two provisions, the Parties have referred to the so-called *double barreled* test. It is therefore this aspect to which the Tribunal will direct its attention subsequently.\n\n421.\n\nBefore that, the Tribunal must, however, clarify what constitutes the economic operation for which the status of an investment protected under Art. 25 of the ICSID Convention and Art. 1 of the Argentina-Italy BIT is claimed.\n\n**2. The relevant economic operation at stake in the present proceedings and the purported lack of standing of the Claimants in this context**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n422.\n\nThe Parties in the present case have offered diverging views as to what economic operation the Tribunal should look at in order to assess whether it is in presence of an investment in the meaning of Art. 25 of the ICSID Convention and Art. 1 of the Argentina-Italy BIT. While the Respondent insists on a strict distinction of \"bonds\" and \"security entitlements\", with the Claimants supposedly only holding the latter, Claimants do not consider this distinction to be relevant in the present case and call upon the Tribunal to regard the issuance of bonds as an integrated operation also including security entitlements.\n\n423.\n\nWithout delving into the minutiae of the mechanism of issuing and circulating sovereign bonds, the Tribunal would consider that, for the purpose of identifying the protected investment in the present case, the distinction between bonds and security entitlements has no particular significance; in any event, it does not have the significance which Respondent seeks to ascribe to it. The Tribunal would endorse the statement of the *Abaclat* Tribunal in this regard that \"whatever the technical nuances between bonds and security entitlements may be, they are part of one and the same economic operation and they make only sense together\".169\n\n*Abaclat* Decision, para. 358. For the treatment of the \"general unity\" of an investment operation and the pertinent case-law see *Fedax N. V. v. Venezuela,* ICSID Case No. ARB/96/3, Decision on Jurisdiction, 11 July 1997, para. 26, n. 28; *Schreuer,* ICSID Convention Commentary, Art. 25, paras. 93-105, with further references as well as *D. Carreau* et at, Droit International \u00c9conomique, 3rd ed., 1990, 570, para. 956, as cited in *E. Gaillard,* Identify or Define? Reflections on the Evolution of the Concept of Investment in ICSID Practice, in: C. Binder et al. (eds.), International Investment Law for the 21st Century: Essays in Honour of Christoph Scheuer, Oxford, 2009, 403, at 405; see, in contrast, the Dissenting Opinion of Professor Abi-Saab in the *Abaclat* case, paras. 69-72 challenging the majority\u2019s \"one economic operation\" approach.\n\n424.\n\nFurthermore, the *Abaclat* Decision has described where the economic unity of the operation lies in terms well applicable also to the present proceedings:\n\ni) First, the bonds at stake were always meant to be divided into smaller negotiable economic values, i.e., securities. It has been sufficiently demonstrated by Claimants that the underwriters would not have subscribed to any of the bonds, without having previously ensured that the bonds were resellable to the Intermediaries and their end customers.\n\nii) Secondly, the security entitlements are the result of the distribution process of the bonds through their division into a multitude of smaller securities representing each a part of the value of the relevant bond. The security entitlements have no value per se, i.e., independently of the bond.\n\niii) Thirdly, the fact that the distribution process happens electronically, without the physical transfer of any title, does not change anything to the fact that rights effectively passed on to acquirers of security entitlements in the bonds.170\n\n*Abaclat* Decision, para. 364.\n\n425.\n\nAgainst this background, the Tribunal would consider that the Claimants have correctly characterized the investment at stake as the overall loans which made funds available to finance the Respondent\u2019s budgetary needs, with each Claimant holding a proportionate share of that investment (C *II \u00a7 83; C III \u00a7 91).* To seek to split up bonds and security entitlements into different, only loosely and indirectly connected operations would ignore the economic realities, and the very function, of the bond issuing process. In particular, it would disregard the fact that it is the bond issuing State itself that departs from the assumption, and counts on the fact, that persons will purchase shares of the bonds on the secondary market, in the form of security entitlements, since otherwise the bond could not have been successfully issued in the first place.\n\n426.\n\nThe Tribunal in the *CSOB v. Slovakia* case was right to state that\n\n[a]n investment is frequently a rather complex operation, composed of various interrelated transactions, each element of which, standing alone, might not in all cases qualify as an investment. Hence, a dispute that is brought before the Centre must be deemed to arise directly out of an investment even when it is based on a transaction which, standing alone, would not qualify as an investment under the Convention, provided that the particular transaction forms an integral part of an overall operation that qualifies as an investment.171\n\n*Ceskoslovenska obchodn\u00ed bank\u00e1, A.S. v. Slovakia,* ICSID Case No. ARB/97/4, Decision on Objections to Jurisdiction, 24 May 1999, para. 72.\n\n427.\n\nIn a similar vein, the Tribunal in the *Enron Corporation v. Argentina* case found that \"an investment is indeed a complex process including various arrangements [...]. This particular aspect was explained by an ICSID tribunal as \u2018the general unity of an investment operation\u2019 and by another tribunal considering an investment based on several instruments as constituting an \u2018indivisible whole\u2019.\"172\n\n*Enron Corporation and Ponderosa Assets, L.P. v. Argentina,* ICSID Case No. ARB/01/3, Decision on Jurisdiction, 14 January 2004, para. 70.\n\n428.\n\nThe doctrine of the \"general unity of an investment operation\" is well-established in international investment law.173 Hence, when a tribunal is in presence of a complex operation, it is required to look at the economic substance of the operation in question in a holistic manner. As aptly stated by Professor Schreuer,\n\n[i]t follows from this consistent case law that tribunals, when examining the existence of an investment for the purposes of their jurisdiction, have not looked at specific transactions but at the overall operation. Tribunals have refused to dissect an investment into individual steps taken by the investor, even if these steps were identifiable as separate legal transactions. What mattered for the identification and protection of the investment was the entire operation directed at the investment\u2019s overall economic goal.174\n\nSee notably the references in *Schreuer,* ICSID Convention Commentary, Art. 25, paras. 93 *et seq.*\n\n*C. Schreuer/U. Kriebaum,* At what time must legitimate expectations exist?, in: Jacques Werner/Arif Hyder Ali (eds.), A Liber Amicorum: Thomas W\u00e4lde. Law Beyond Conventional Thought (2010) 265, at 272.\n\n429.\n\nIn the light of this jurisprudence and applying it to the facts of the present case, the Tribunal is convinced that the process of issuing bonds and their circulation on the secondary, i.e. financial, markets in the form of security entitlements are to be considered an economic unity and must be dealt with as such a unity for the purpose of deciding whether disputes relating to financial instruments of this kind \"aris[e] directly out of an investment\" and are therefore covered by Art. 25 of the ICSID Convention and Art. 1 of the Argentina-Italy BIT.\n\n430.\n\nThis was also the view held by the Tribunal in the *Abaclat* case175:\n\nThe Tribunal is of the opinion that such argument [i.e., that the payment of the purchase price occurred after the payment of the lump sum price by the underwriters, and that only the latter payment can be considered to have been made available to Argentina] ignores the reality of the bond issuance process. Indeed, although the payment of the lump sum price for the bonds and the payment of the purchase price by the individual holders of security entitlements happened at different points in time, the latter constitutes the basis for the former. As mentioned above, the bonds and the security entitlements are part of one and the same economic operation and they make only sense together: Without the prior insurance to be able to collect sufficient funds from the individual purchasers of security entitlements, the underwriters would never have committed to the payment of the lump sum payment. In other words, the lump sum payment is an advance made by the underwriters to Argentina on the future payments of individual investors.\n\n*Abaclat* Decision, para. 376.\n\n431.\n\nIn view of the bond issuance process constituting a single economic operation, notably including the circulation of security entitlements on the secondary market, the present Tribunal will in the following refer to these instruments together, with wordings such as \"bonds and security entitlements\", \"bonds or security entitlements\", \"bonds/security entitlements\", etc. implying no difference in meaning, but referring to this unity of the investment operation at stake.\n\n432.\n\nThis finding permits the Tribunal to simultaneously dispose of related arguments put forward by the Respondent. It has been submitted that the Claimants as holders of mere security entitlements acquired through multiple intermediaries lack standing because they are only remotedly connected with the underlying bonds *(RI \u00a7 254).* It has equally been contended that the indirect holding system implicates a cut-off point beyond which claims are not permissible because the connection with the investment is too remote *(R I \u00a7 256; RIII\u00a7\u00a7 175-179).*\n\n433.\n\nTo be sure, while the argument of a lack of standing is presented to operate on the level of jurisdiction *ratione personae,* as it suggests that the Claimants do not qualify as investors for having failed to have themselves made \"investments\"176, the argument is closely related to the pertinent discussion of the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction *ratione materiae.* Accordingly, the response to be given to it cannot be different from what has been stated above. Given the Tribunal\u2019s conclusion that the bond issuing process, including the purchase of security entitlements on the secondary market, is to be seen as an economic unity embodying a single act of investment, it cannot uphold the Respondent\u2019s submission and thus has to reject the argument that Claimants would lack standing in the present proceedings.\n\nSee *supra* para. 327.\n\n434.\n\nIn a similar vein, inasmuch as it may be suggested that in view of the \"remote character\" of the Claimants\u2019 security entitlements, when compared to the situation of the original underwriters with regard to the initial act of issuing of the bonds, the investment would not arise \"directly\" out of an investment as required by Art. 25(1) of the ICSID Convention, the same reasoning applies. Being part of a single economic operation, the purchase of security entitlements by Claimants on the secondary market is to be considered part and parcel of a single investment.\n\n**3. The nature and legal relevance of the \"double barreled\" test**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n435.\n\nHaving clarified at what economic operation the Tribunal has to look when assessing whether it is in presence of a protected investment, the Tribunal now turns to the above-mentioned question of the nature of the so-called \"double barreled\" test and how it is to be applied in the present case. It should first be noted in this regard that both Parties accept the relevance of this test when it comes to understanding the term \"investment\" in Art. 25 of the ICSID Convention and Art. 1 of the Argentina-Italy BIT and to determining, on this basis, the jurisdiction *ratione materiae* of the Centre (C *II \u00a7 81; R I \u00a7\u00a7 144-146; RII \u00a7 224).*\n\n436.\n\nAt the same time, the exact functioning and application of the test are controversial between the Parties: On the one hand, Respondent insists that in order for a protected investment to be present, each and all of the requirements set forth both in the ICSID Convention and the applicable BIT must be fulfilled. Respondent thus contends that the term \"investment\" in Art. 25 of the ICSID Convention must be interpreted autonomously, i.e. independently of the investment clause in the pertinent BIT, and that the objective requirements laid down in the ICSID Convention cannot therefore be overridden by the Parties *(R III \u00a7\u00a7 118, 119, 144 et seq.).* On the other hand, Claimants submit that the \"investment\" requirement of the ICSID Convention is primarily controlled by the Parties and should not be interpreted separately from the definition of investment in the relevant BIT *(C I \u00a7210, CII \u00a7 89).*\n\n437.\n\nIn this regard, the present Tribunal would consider that, inasmuch as the Tribunal is established and operates under the ICSID Convention, its competence cannot transcend the jurisdiction of the Centre, as defined in Art. 25 of the Convention. Hence, to the extent that Art. 25 imposes limits on the jurisdiction of the Centre, they are also binding upon the Tribunal.\n\n438.\n\nAs Art. 41(2) of the ICSID Convention clearly states, any objection by a party that a dispute is not within the jurisdiction of the Centre or for other reasons is not within the competence of the Tribunal, shall be considered and decided by the Tribunal, and this decision must obviously be taken on the basis, and within the boundaries, of Art. 25 of the Convention. Accordingly, irrespective of whether this operation is referred to as a \"double keyhole\" approach or a \"double barreled\" or \"twofold\" test177 or whether it is described as identifying the \"outer limits\" of the consent to arbitration given by the Parties, Art. 25 of the ICSID Convention is - in addition to and beyond the relevant provisions of the Argentina-Italy BIT - pertinent for the present Tribunal\u2019s Decision on the jurisdiction of the Centre and the Tribunal\u2019s competence to hear the present case.\n\nSee in general *Sehr euer/Dolzer,* Principles of International Investment Law (note 127) 62; *Schreuer,* ICSID Convention Commentary, Art. 25, paras. 124 and 125 with references to the pertinent case-law.\n\n439.\n\nFurthermore, the limits set by Art. 25(1) ICSID Convention are not subject to consensual change178 by the parties to a dispute179, save Art. 25 or, for that matter, another provision of the Convention were to declare the consent of the parties to be relevant in terms of the jurisdiction of the Centre.180 Accordingly, the existence of an \"investment\" within the meaning of Art. 25 ICSID Convention is a mandatory requirement for the jurisdiction of the Centre, with a request for arbitration transcending these limits leading to the dismissal of the case.\n\n*Schreuer,* ICSID Convention Commentary, Art. 25, paras. 122, 123 and 125-127; see also *M. Waibel,* Opening Pandora\u2019s Box. Sovereign Bonds in International Arbitration, 101 AJIL (2007) 711, at 718, 719 (n. 52 and 54) and 722, emphasizing that the term \"investment\" in Art. 25(1) of the ICSID Convention is \"not infinitely elastic\", as well as Professor Abi-Saab\u2019s Dissenting Opinion in the *Abaclat* case, para. 46 seconding this statement.\n\nE.g. the exclusion of persons having dual nationality from the jurisdiction *ratione personae* of the Centre if one of the nationalities is that of the host State; see Art. 25(2)(a) of the Convention; see *Schreuer,* ICSID Convention Commentary, Art. 25, paras. 5 and 7.\n\nSee e.g. Art. 25(2)(b) of the Convention according to which the parties to a dispute can agree that a juridical person having the nationality of the host State but subject to foreign control should be treated as a national of another Contracting State for the purposes of the Convention. Even though such persons would normally be excluded from the scope of application *ratione personae* of the Convention, the agreement of the parties as authorized by Art. 25 brings them back under the Convention\u2019s protective umbrella.\n\n440.\n\nAlas, this first set of responses does not settle the question how the mandatory jurisdictional requirement *ratione materiae* of \"investment\" plays out in the present case and, in particular, how narrow or wide the limits set by it are. The reach of the Convention can only be properly assessed by submitting the term \"investment\" in Art. 25(1) to a thorough analysis and clarifying whether bonds or security entitlements such as those pertinent to the present dispute constitute \"investments\" for the purposes of the ICSID Convention and the Argentina-Italy BIT.\n\n**4. The meaning of \"investment\" under Art. 25(1) of the ICSID Convention**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n441.\n\nThe Parties agree that neither the ICSID Convention nor, for that matter, other ICSID Regulations or Rules contain a legal definition of the term \"investment\". However, they draw different conclusions from this fact: while the Claimants argue that, due to the lack of a definition, the investment requirement under Art. 25 of the Convention must be interpreted broadly and having primary regard to the intention of the Parties in each individual circumstance (C *I \u00a7\u00a7 210, 219; C III \u00a7 119),* the Respondent claims the opposite and refutes that Art. 25 should be subject to a broad interpretation *(RII\u00a7 234).*\n\n442.\n\nAs the Parties themselves concede, the meaning to be given to the term \"investment\" must be the result of an interpretation of the provision in question according to the rules of international law. The intensive debate, not to say controversy, regarding the term \"investment\" which has become manifest in various arbitral decisions dealing with Art. 25 of the ICSID Convention but also in pertinent academic circles, reveals that the meaning of the term is far from being clear.\n\n443.\n\nGiven the fact that Art. 41 of the ICSID Convention makes the Tribunal the judge of its own competence, it is the Tribunal\u2019s responsibility to clarify the interpretation to be given to the term in a systematic and well-reasoned fashion and to decide on this basis whether the concept of \"investment\" is susceptible to cover sovereign bonds or security entitlements such as those pertinent to the present case. In this operation, the Tribunal will be guided - and the Parties fully agree in this regard - by the generally accepted rules of treaty interpretation as set out in Art. 31 of the VCLT, notably the general rule that \"[a] treaty shall be interpreted in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in the light of its object and purpose\".\n\n444.\n\nFurthermore, pursuant to Art. 32 of the VCLT,\n\nRecourse may be had to supplementary means of interpretation, including the preparatory work of the treaty and the circumstances of its conclusion, in order to confirm the meaning resulting from the application of article 31, or to determine the meaning when the interpretation according to article 31 :\n\n(a) leaves the meaning ambiguous or obscure; or\n\n(b) leads to a result which is manifestly absurd or unreasonable.\n\n445.\n\nThe Tribunal is well aware that Art. 32 of the VCLT only provides for *supplementary* means of interpretation which thus only come into play if and to the extent that the application of the rules of interpretation codified in Art. 31 of the Vienna Convention were to lead to the result that the meaning of the provision in question remains \"ambiguous or obscure\". The Tribunal is further aware that such a conclusion cannot be drawn at this stage of the reasoning.\n\n446.\n\nHaving made this proviso, the Tribunal considers it nonetheless preferable, in the light of the circumstances of the case and for the sake of clarity of the argument, to first turn its attention to the drafting process of the ICSID Convention, notably in regard to the genesis of its Art. 25. This course of action shall help to enlighten the background against which the provision was adopted and to prepare the ground for a proper analysis of the term \"investment\" according to the rules of interpretation enshrined in Art. 31 of the VCLT.\n\n447.\n\nIt is through this way of proceeding that the Tribunal will be able to assure itself whether, on the one hand, the criteria of interpretation established by Art. 31 of the VCLT lead to a sufficiently clear understanding of the term \"investment\" in Art. 25 of the ICSID Convention that might subsequently be confirmed by referring to the *travaux pr\u00e9paratoires* or whether, on the other hand, those criteria leave the meaning of the term \"ambiguous or obscure\" so that refuge is to be taken to the preparatory work and the circumstances of conclusion of the ICSID Convention in order to determine the meaning of the term \"investment\". In that sense, the following remarks are clearly not meant to modify the well-established rules of treaty interpretation or to substitute for a proper interpretation of the provision in question in the light of Art. 31 of the VCLT.\n\n***a) The background of the adoption of Art. 25(1) of the ICSID*** ***Convention***\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n448.\n\nAccording to the 1965 Report of the Executive Directors on the ICSID Convention, \"[n]o attempt was made to define the term \u2018investment\u2019 given the essential requirement of consent by the parties, and the mechanism through which Contracting States can make known in advance, if they so desire, the classes of disputes which they would or would not consider submitting to the Centre (Article 25 (4)).\"181 While this statement is commonly cited as authoritative comment for the interpretation of Art. 25 of the ICSID Convention, it is rarely made subject to further analysis.\n\nReport of the Executive Directors (note 97), nr. 27.\n\n449.\n\nTo begin with, the statement must be qualified inasmuch as several, though unsuccessful, attempts at defining the term \"investment\" had actually been made in the negotiation process leading to the adoption of the ICSID Convention in 1965.182 In fact, the question of whether and how to define the concept of \"investment\" was one of the most contentious issues in that process. While a first camp, mostly consisting of developed (viz. capital-exporting) States, proposed to abstain from any definition of investment and to leave that matter entirely to the consent of the States involved, another group of States, dominated by developing (viz. capital-importing) States, was strongly in favour of a precise and narrow definition that would limit the Convention\u2019s scope of application *ratione materiae* to a well-defined (and if possible even exhaustive) list of protected investments.183 When the negotiations were on the brink of failure due to the stalemate between the two camps, a compromise proposal introduced by the United Kingdom brought the breakthrough, permitting that in the final vote the Convention was adopted by an overwhelming majority.184\n\n*Schreuer,* ICSID Convention Commentary, Art. 25, para. 119.\n\nFor a detailed account of the negotiations, notably regarding the competing proposals of jurisdictional \"maximalists\" and \"minimalists\" see *J. D. Mortenson,* The Meaning of \"Investment\": ICSID\u2019s *Travaux* and the Domain of International Investment Law, 51 Harvard International Law Journal (2010) 257, at 281 *et seq.. ;* see also *Schreuer,* ICSID Convention Commentary, Art. 25, paras. 113 *et seq.; D. R. Sedlak,* ICSID\u2019s Resurgence in International Investment Arbitration: Can the Momentum Hold?, 23 Penn State International Law Review (2004) 147, at 156, 157.\n\n*Mortenson,* The Meaning of \"Investment\" (note 183) 289 *et seq.* and 301, notably referring to Aron Broches\u2019 summary of the arrangement in his report to the Executive Directors as allowing \"each Contracting State [to], in effect, write its own definition\" of \"investment\"; see Memorandum of the Meeting of the Committee of the Whole, 16 February 1965, in Documents Concerning the Origin and the Formulation of the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States (1968), Vol. II, 972; see, in a similar vein, *Schreuer,* ICSID Convention Commentary, Art. 25, para. 115.\n\n450.\n\nThis compromise proposal sought to take account of the concerns of both camps. To this effect, it combined two aspects: On the one hand, it opted for the bare use of the term \"investment\". This was a concession to the proponents of the non-definition approach, implying that the Convention would impose no, or only very weak, limits as to the jurisdiction *ratione materiae* of the Centre regarding the question whether a certain economic operation would qualify as an investment under Art. 25 of the ICSID Convention.\n\n451.\n\nOn the other hand, this liberal approach was complemented, and contained, by the establishment of a mechanism by which (namely the capital-importing) States could withhold matters from the jurisdiction of the Centre which they considered inappropriate to be dealt with by this institution. The immediate result of the move to accommodate these States\u2019 concerns was the introduction of Art. 25(4) of the ICSID Convention - a provision which was not in the Convention\u2019s draft before. It permits any Contracting State, before or after ratification of the Convention, to \"notify the Centre of the class or classes of disputes which it would or would not consider submitting to the jurisdiction of the Centre [...] Such notification shall not constitute the consent required by paragraph (1).\"\n\n452.\n\nStates had therefore the possibility of restricting the Centre\u2019s jurisdiction *ratione materiae* to economic operations and assets which they considered to constitute investments, by giving or not giving consent or by qualifying their consent with certain restrictions185 - be it via their domestic investment legislation or via the applicable BIT. In addition, notifications under Art. 25(4) of the ICSID Convention allowed States to make announcements in general terms as to the types of disputes in respect of which they would consider giving consent. While such notifications do not amount to limiting as such the jurisdiction *ratione materiae* of the Centre and while those notifications cannot replace the specific consent to arbitration required under Art. 25 (see its afore-cited para. 4, final sentence), they may have an indirect bearing on jurisdiction: a consent clause which is not entirely clear may be interpreted by reference to a prior notification of classes of disputes in respect of which the host State has expressed its intentions.186 Accordingly, the consent of the parties as to the scope of the term \"investment\" is to be deemed of great relevance when establishing the meaning of Art. 25 of the ICSID Convention, without the concept thus becoming subject to the parties\u2019 unfettered discretion.187\n\nSee also *A. Broches,* The Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes: Some Observations on Jurisdiction, 5 Columbia Journal of Transnational Law (1966), 261, at 268: \"During the negotiations several definitions of \u2018investment\u2019 were considered and rejected. It was felt in the end that a definition could be dispensed with \u2018given the essential requirement of consent by the parties\u2019. This indicates that the requirement that the dispute must have arisen out of an \u2018investment\u2019 may be merged into the requirement of consent to jurisdiction.\"\n\n*Schreuer,* ICSID Convention Commentary, Art. 25, paras. 921 *et seq.* and 934.\n\n*Broches,* The Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes (note 185) 268: \"Presumably, the parties\u2019 agreement that a dispute is an \u2018investment dispute\u2019 will be given great weight in any determination of the Centre\u2019s jurisdiction, although it would not be controlling.\"\n\n453.\n\nThe scope of the term \"investment\" in a given case would therefore be the product of a liberal understanding of the concept of \"investment\", combined with possible restrictions to the consent to arbitration as provided by the host State.188 Such restrictions may be effected by the interplay of pertinent declarations on the part of the States involved, including (i) notifications under Art. 25(4) and, in particular, definitions of investment as contained (ii) in national investment legislations as well as (iii) in the applicable BITs.189\n\nSee e.g. *E. C. Schlemmer,* Investment, Investor, Nationality, and Shareholders, in: P. Muchlinksi et al., The Oxford Handbook of International Investment Law, Oxford 2008, 49, at 63 : \"It was, however, a deliberate decision not to include a definition of investment in the Treaty,for fear that a concrete meaning would limit its scope and raise unnecessary jurisdictional problems\u2019 [...] [T]he definition of \u2018investment\u2019 should depend on the parties\u2019 consent in the separate international investment agreements or in international instruments [...] The absence of definition makes it possible to have a fairly liberal interpretation when it comes to deciding what an investment would be\" (referring to *D. A. Lopina,* The International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes: Investment Arbitration for the 1990s, Ohio State Journal on Dispute Resolution (1988) 107, at 114 and to *N. Rubins,* The Notion of 'Investment\u2019 in International Investment Arbitration, in: Norbert Hom (ed.), Arbitrating Foreign Investment Disputes, The Hague 2004, 292 *et seq.).* See further *Mortenson,* The Meaning of \"Investment\" (note 183) 259, arguing that it is not correct that the \"delegates at the drafting convention were forced to leave \u2018investment\u2019 undefined because of their inability [...] to formulate a single, clean definition [...] Rather, the decision to leave \u2018investment\u2019 open-ended had a specific meaning as part of a crucial compromise of a long-raging dispute.\" See furthermore *ibid,* 280: \"The failure to define \u2018investment\u2019 [...] was an explicit choice that represented categorical adoption of the broad jurisdictional position in exchange for some crucial opt-out provisions aimed at taking the developing countries\u2019 concerns into account.\" See, however, *Waibel,* Opening Pandora\u2019s Box (note 178) 730: \"Many commentators mistakenly interpret Article 25\u2019s definitional silence concerning \u2018investment\u2019 as legitimating an elastic notion of investment, but the *failure to reach consensus* cannot be used to adopt a broad notion *by default/* (emphasis in original).\n\nSee *Mortenson,* The Meaning of \"Investment\" (note 183) 293 *et seq.*\n\n454.\n\nIt is therefore Art. 25(1) of the ICSID Convention itself that opens the general scope of the term \"investment\" to the possibility of restriction. This is how the provision has been understood to work at the time of conclusion of the ICSID Convention (even though the specific question of the Centre\u2019s jurisdiction over loans seems to have been left open at that time190). The very citation from the Report of Directors referred to above testifies to this trade-off when it expressly links the lack of a definition of \"investment\", first, to the \"essential requirement of consent by the parties\" and, second, to the \"mechanism\" of Art. 25(4) of the Convention. However, the Report\u2019s wording is inaccurate inasmuch as the non-existence of a definition of \"investment\" in Art. 25(1) of the ICSID Convention was due to a deliberate abstention from including a definition rather than to a failure to agree on a definition.\n\nSee *Schreuer,* ICSID Convention Commentary, Art. 25, para. 118, generally referring to Documents Concerning the Origin and the Formulation of the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States (1968), Vol. II, 261, 474, 668, 709. See, however, the account *of Mortenson,* The Meaning of \"Investment\" (note 183) 299, n. 225 who concludes that \"all efforts to eliminate the Convention\u2019s application to bonds, loans, and capital flow were rejected\". In that regard, he refers to the pertinent sources in the afore-mentioned Documents Concerning the Origin and Formulation of the ICSID Convention, notably Summary Proceedings of the Legal Committee Meeting (Nov. 27, 1964, Morning), p. 709 (Philippines) (suggesting the elimination of claims based on capital flow); Consultative Meeting of Legal Experts, Addis Ababa (Dec. 16-20, 1963), p. 261 (Burundi) (\"[A] foreign company which lent money to a State could not be regarded as an investor.\"); Consultative Meeting of Legal Experts, Addis Ababa (Dec. 16-20, 1963), p. 261 (Broches) (explaining that the current draft covered loans); Consultative Meeting of Legal Experts, Bangkok (Apr. 27-May 1, 1964), p. 474 (Australia) (stating that the Convention also covers \"borrowing of cash by the host country from foreign private investors\"). See also *Waibel,* Opening Pandora\u2019s Box (note 178) 720, n. 61, further referring to the statement of the Austrian delegate that \"public loans or bonds should not be included\"; see *ibid,* 709.\n\n***b) Interpretation of the concept of \"investment\" in the light of Art. 31 of the VCLT and its application to the financial instruments in the present case***\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n455.\n\nAs stated above, the previous remarks regarding the genesis of Art. 25 of the ICSID Convention cannot be decisive for the interpretation of the provision as a matter of international law, which remains subject to the general rules of treaty interpretation as codified in Art. 31 of the VCLT. In particular, reliance on the *travaux pr\u00e9paratoires* and the intentions of the parties must not lead to an outcome deviating from the interpretation of Art. 25 \"in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in the light of its object and purpose\", even if indicated otherwise by the historical background. The previous remarks are only meant to provide a useful background for the operation of interpretation to which the Tribunal now turns.\n\n**(1) Ordinary meaning**\n------------------------\n\n456.\n\nTo begin with, as regards the ordinary meaning of the term \"investment\", this is a notion covering a wide range of economic operations varying substantially as to their character and profile. For instance, investment has been defined as \"[t]he placing of capital or laying out of money in a way intended to secure income or profit from its employment\"191 or \"[a]n expenditure of money for income or profit or to purchase something of intrinsic value: capital outlay\".192 A comparison of common definitions of the term \"investment\", \"investissement\" and \"inversion\" in the three authentic languages of the ICSID Convention (i.e. English, French and Spanish)193, while not giving clear contours to the notion of investment, confirms the broad character of the concept. Accordingly, the Tribunal is of the opinion that the ordinary meaning of the term \"investment\" does certainly not restrict the scope of the notion so as to exclude bonds or security entitlements such as the ones pertinent to this case from its purview, but is rather susceptible to include those financial instruments.194\n\n*Black\u2019s Law Dictionary,* 4th ed. 1951.\n\n*Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary,* 3rd ed. 1961.\n\nSee *Waibel,* Opening Pandora\u2019s Box (note 178) 719, n. 55; *Mortenson,* The Meaning of \"Investment\" (note 183) 310, n. 258-260.\n\nHowever, it is worth referring to Professor Amerasinghe\u2019s caveat in this context: \"dictionary definitions devised for the purpose of economic science or financial analysis may be irrelevant for the purpose of defining investment in connection with the Centre\u2019s jurisdiction. So also tax law or investment law definitions in municipal law are intended to relate to special objectives and would be of limited usefulness\"; see *id.,* The International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes and Development (note 101) 180. Yet, even endorsing this argument would not result in the opposite conclusion that bonds/security entitlements are *not* covered by the term\u2019s ordinary meaning, but would rather suggest that the term is \"ambiguous\" in the sense of Art. 32 of the VCLT or that this is a case of a term having been given \"[a] special meaning [...] if it is established that the parties so intended\" (Art. 31 para. 4 of the VCLT).\n\n**(2) Context**\n---------------\n\n457.\n\nFurthermore, Art. 31 of the VCLT reminds the interpreter that the terms used in the treaty should not be analyzed in an isolated manner, but understood in their context, i.e. by relying on the method of systematic interpretation. In that regard, the Tribunal may usefully refer back to the previous sub-section195 according to which the possibility of notification, as laid down in Art. 25(4) of the ICSID Convention, and the possibility for States to restrict the Centre\u2019s jurisdiction *ratione materiae* by limiting their consent to arbitration via their investment legislation and their BITs, work as compensatory mechanisms counter-balancing a wide and possibly even extensive understanding of \"investment\" in Art. 25(1) of the ICSID Convention. The existence of this balancing mechanism would militate for an interpretation which does not unduly place restrictions on the concept of \"investment\" in para. 1 but which gives it a broad scope of application, subject to the possibility of subsequent restriction by the parties.\n\nSee *supra* para. 453.\n\n**(3) Object and purpose**\n--------------------------\n\n458.\n\nWhen it comes, thirdly, to object and purpose, the situation is less clear. The often-cited first preambular paragraph of the ICSID Convention which emphasizes \"the need for international cooperation for economic development, and the role of private international investment therein\"196 may well be understood in different ways. While the Decision in the *Abaclat* case saw the Convention\u2019s aim in \"encourag[ing] private investment while giving the Parties the tools to further define what kind of investment they want to promote\",197 Professor Abi-Saab\u2019s Dissenting Opinion harshly criticized this approach as\n\na purely subjective, truncated and partial representation of the object and purpose of the ICSID Convention and the BIT [...] [T]he object and purpose of these two treaties - the ICSID Convention and the BIT - are described as being exclusively to afford maximum protection to foreign investment and foreign investors; as if these treaties were \"unilateral contracts\" creating rights for the benefit of one party only.198\n\nSee also the Report of the Executive Directors (note 97), nr. 9 according to which the Convention was \"prompted by the desire to strengthen the partnership between countries in the cause of economic development\".\n\n*Abaclat* Decision, para. 364.\n\nDissenting Opinion of Professor Abi-Saab in the *Abaclat* case, para. 157.\n\n459.\n\nIn Professor Abi-Saab\u2019s opinion, \"[t]his unilateral vision is in stark contrast to the \u2018object and purpose\u2019 of the ICSID Convention\",199 notably as it becomes manifest in the Report of Executive Directors.200 That the interpretation of the ICSID Convention in terms of its object and purpose can lead to both an extensive and a restrictive reading of the term \"investment\", depending on what goal one ascribes to the Convention, also becomes manifest both in arbitral jurisprudence201 and in the pertinent academic literature.202\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 159.\n\nSee Report of the Executive Directors (note 97), nr. 13: \"While the broad objective of the Convention is to encourage a larger flow of private international investment, the provisions of the Convention maintain a careful balance between the interests of investors and those of host States.\"\n\nSee, e.g., *Ceskoslovenska obchodn\u00ed bank\u00e1, A.S. v. Slovakia,* ICSID Case No. ARB/97/4, Decision on Objections to Jurisdiction, 24 May 1999, para. 64: \"This statement [the statement in the 1965 Report of Executive Directors; see *supra* note 181] also indicates that investment as a concept should be interpreted broadly because the drafters of the Convention did not impose any restrictions on its meaning. Support for a liberal interpretation of the question whether a particular transaction constitutes an investment is also found in the first paragraph of the Preamble to the Convention [...] This language permits an inference that an international transaction which contributes to cooperation designed to promote the economic development of a Contracting State may be deemed to be an investment as that term is understood in the Convention.\" See the references to the pertinent case-law in *Schreuer,* ICSID Convention Commentary, Art. 25, para. 121, n. 145 and *Gaillard,* Identify or Define? (note 169) 407-411.\n\nSee in this regard, e.g., *D. A. R. Williams,* Jurisdiction and Admissibility, in: P. Muchlinksi et al., The Oxford Handbook of International Investment Law, Oxford 2008, 868, at 876 (\"A broad interpretation of Article 25 \u2019investment\u2019 is supported by distinguished commentators and the awards of various tribunals.\", referring to *C. F. Amerasinghe,* The Jurisdiction of the International Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes (note 101) 181 as well as the *CSOB v. Slovakia* and *Fedax v. Venezuela* decisions (see *supra* notes 169 and 201); *Mortenson,* The Meaning of \"Investment\" (note 183) 301 *et seq.,* arguing for \"deference\" to be shown by international tribunals to the judgment of sovereign states for three reasons: (a) the benefit of maximizing policy flexibility in a changing, pluralist world, allowing different Member States to pursue different policies at any given moment in time and to change their minds over time, (b) the wisdom of vesting decisional authority in the body with comparative advantages in expertise and policy legitimacy, and (c) the lack of need to protect vulnerable interests by tightening legal scrutiny. See also *Gaillard,* Identify or Define? (note 169) 406 *et seq.*\n\n460.\n\nIn this tug-of-war of judicial and scholarly opinions, the Tribunal would, by way of a tentative conclusion, resist to endorse an overly narrow reading of the term \"investment\" in Art. 25(1) of the Convention. In particular, the Tribunal would like to caution against a restrictive reading of the jurisdictional provisions of the ICSID Convention which does not find its base in the Convention itself, but rather draws on concerns regarding the ability, and appropriateness, of arbitral tribunals to tackle difficulties relating to the substantive side of a case. This is a question to be dealt with on the level of the merits, but should not lead tribunals to decline to hear cases in \"anticipatory obedience\" to real or imagined constituencies.203\n\n*Mortenson,* The Meaning of \"Investment\" (note 183) 272: \"tribunals may be cutting back on their jurisdiction in an ill-formulated (and perhaps even unconscious) effort to communicate modesty to their state-constituents and avoid applying what some view as the investment regime\u2019s increasingly overbroad *substantive* rules.\" (emphasis in the original); see also *ibid,* 313 and 314.\n\n461.\n\nAt the same time, the Tribunal would concede that a restrictive reading is required if the consent given by a State indicates that certain types of investment should be excluded from the protection of the ICSID arbitration mechanism. The key role of the requirement of (specific) consent to arbitration on the part of States is already articulated in the last preambular paragraph204 and becomes particularly and repeatedly manifest in Art. 25 of the ICSID Convention, notably in the last sentence of its para. 4. Not surprisingly, the Report of the Executive Directors205 refers to consent therefore as the \"cornerstone\" of the jurisdiction of the Centre.\n\n\"Declaring that no Contracting State shall by the mere fact of its ratification, acceptance or approval of this Convention and without its consent be deemed to be under any obligation to submit any particular dispute to conciliation or arbitration\".\n\nReport of the Executive Directors (note 97), nr. 23.\n\n462.\n\nIn the present context, the paramount argument militating against a broad understanding of the term \"investment\" would be that this might come as a surprise for States having subscribed to international arbitration. Yet, the Tribunal cannot see what States would lose in terms of the consent-based character of the ICSID Convention, and arbitral proceedings conducted on its basis, by the mere fact that the term \"investment\" in Art. 25(1) is understood in the broad terms suggested by the provision itself and seconded by the definition in the BIT that arises from the very consent of the parties, in conjunction with an express authorization for investors to submit such protected investments to ICSID arbitration. In this regard, the very fact that BITs regularly combine (and do so also in the present case) a detailed definition of the term \"investment\" with explicit authorization for the investor to resort to ICSID arbitration, should be given great weight in deciding whether or not the transaction in question is an investment for the purposes of Art. 25 of the ICSID Convention.206 As pointed out above, States have a number of ways available to them to qualify their consent and to exclude certain types of investment from their consent to arbitration.207\n\nSee *Alcoa Minerals of Jamaica v. Jamaica,* ICSID Case No. ARB/74/2, Decision on Jurisdiction and Competene, 6 July 1975, 4 Yearbook of Commercial Arbitration (1979), 206, at 207; see further *Ceskoslovenska obchodn\u00ed bank\u00e1, A.S. v. Slovakia,* ICSID Case No. ARB/97/4, Decision on Objections to Jurisdiction, 24 May 1999, para. 66 according to which the parties\u2019 acceptance of the Centre\u2019s jurisdiction \"with respect to the rights and obligations arising out of their agreement therefore creates a strong presumption that they considered their transaction to be an investment within the meaning of the ICSID Convention.\"\n\nSee *supra* para. 453. The fact that Art. 25 para. 4, once introduced into the Convention, was only scarcely used (see *Schreuer,* ICSID Convention Commentary, Art. 25, paras. 926, 927; *Mortenson,* The Meaning of \"Investment\" (note 183) 294) cannot change this result.\n\n463.\n\nAs regards the case before the Tribunal, Art. 1(1) of the Argentina-Italy BIT contains a detailed agreement between the two States parties as to what economic operations they wanted to see included in the term \"investment\". Assuming that sovereign bonds/security entitlements are covered by this definition,208 the *Abaclat* Tribunal convincingly concluded that leaving those outside of the scope of protection of the ICSID Convention because of a purportedly narrower definition of \"investment\" in Art. 25 of the Convention would \"make no sense in view of Argentina\u2019s and Italy\u2019s express agreement to protect the value generated by these kinds of contributions [...] [T]here would be an investment, which Argentina and Italy wanted to protect and to submit to ICSID arbitration, but it could not be given any protection.\"209 In this context, Claimants have correctly noted that a narrow definition of investment excluding bonds would \"unreasonably deny sovereign States [...] the possibility to promote subscription of their public debt by granting to foreign bondholders ICSID protection. Such an artificial limitation of sovereign power is unwarranted\" (C *IV\u00a7 35).*\n\nSee *infra* paras. 488 *et seq.*\n\n*Abaclat* Decision, para. 364.\n\n**(4) Subsequent State practice**\n---------------------------------\n\n464.\n\nSubsequent State practice which, by virtue of Art. 31(3)(b) of the VCLT, shall also be taken into account in the operation of interpretation together with the context, does not lead to a conclusive result. Given the existence of both wide and restrictive definitions of the term \"investment\" in BITs and national investment legislation, it is hard to identify a common pattern, at least one that would exclude sovereign bonds from the scope of the term \"investment\" with the necessary clarity.210 Accordingly, no counter-argument can be deduced from this aspect of treaty interpretation.\n\nSee *Mortenson,* The Meaning of \"Investment\" (note 183) 312: \"State practice thus seems at worst ambiguous on the question, and in no event a source of such clarity as to override the other considerations outlined here.\"\n\n465.\n\nIt should be noted in this regard that several tribunals have used what might be called a \"state practice approach\" in the sense that they were looking into whether the general inclusion of obligations in \"very substantial numbers of BITs across the world\" could generate an \"international consensus\" relevant to the interpretation of Art. 25 of the ICSID Convention.211 On the basis of its own analysis, the Tribunal is, however, not in a position to draw such conclusions in the present context.\n\nSee, for instance, *Biwater Gauff (Tanzania), Ltd. v. Tanzania,* ICSID Case No. ARB/05/22, Award, 24 July 2008, para. 314; *Fedax N.V. v. Venezuela,* ICSID Case No. ARB/96/3, Decision on Jurisdiction, 11 July 1997, paras. 34-36; see *Mortenson,* The Meaning of \"Investment\" (note 183) 277, n. 93 and 303, n. 238.\n\n**(5) Pertinent case-law and doctrine**\n---------------------------------------\n\n466.\n\nIn the light of Art. 38(1)(d) of the Statute of the International Court of Justice, one might also refer to \"judicial decisions and the teachings of the most highly qualified publicists of the various nations\" for the determination of rules of international law. It has been pointed out already that both on the judicial and the academic levels, there is much controversy on the meaning to be given to the term \"investment\" in Art. 25 of the ICSID Convention and on whether to construe it broadly or restrictively.\n\n467.\n\nThat financial investments such as the sovereign bonds/security entitlements at stake in the present case may constitute investments for the purpose of Art. 25(1) of the ICSID Convention has already been confirmed in a comparable case by the *Fedax* Tribunal212 and in other cases.213 Even the *Joy Mining* Tribunal which is commonly cited for its strict approach to Art. 25 of the ICSID Convention has, by distinguishing *Fedax* from the facts of the *Joy Mining* case, signaled its approval of the approach taken by the *Fedax* Tribunal.214\n\n*Fedax N.V. v. Venezuela,* ICSID Case No. ARB/96/3, Award, 11 July 1997, para. 29 where the Tribunal concluded, in the light of the broad scope of Art. 25 of the ICSID Convention, that \"loans qualify as an investment within ICSID\u2019s jurisdiction, as does, in given circumstances, the purchase of bonds. Since promissory notes are evidence of a loan and a rather typical financial and credit instrument, there is nothing to prevent their purchase from qualifying as an investment under the Convention in the circumstances of a particular case like this.\"\n\nSee *Schreuer,* ICSID Commentary, Art. 25, para. 149 and its references to *Ceskoslovenska obchodn\u00ed bank\u00e1, A.S. v. Slovakia,* ICSID Case No. ARB/97/4, Decision on Objections to Jurisdiction, 24 May 1999, paras. 76-91; *Sempra Energy International v. Argentina,* ICSID Case No. ARB/02/15, Award, 28 September 2007, paras. 214-216 as well as *CDC Group pic v.

Turkey,* ICSID Case No. ARB/02/5, Decision on Jurisdiction, 4 June 2004, para. 189. See in this regard also *Dolzer/Schreuer,* Principles of International Investment Law (note 127) 66, 67; *Waibel,* Opening Pandora\u2019s Box (note 178) 720-722.\n\n*Joy Mining Machinery Limited v. Egypt,* ICSID Case No. ARB/03/11, Award, 6 August 2004, paras. 60 and 61: \"Even the much cited *Fedax* case is to be distinguished from the present one although it admitted that financial contributions made in the form of promissory notes did qualify as an investment. [...] [T]he element that persuaded the tribunal to reach that conclusion was that the financing in question *had and was being used by the State to finance its budget under a law of public credit* [...] The situation in this case is clearly not of the same nature.\" (emphasis added); see *Fedax N.V. v. Venezuela,* ICSID Case No. ARB/96/3, Award, 11 July 1997, para. 42 in this regard.\n\n468.\n\nIn general, Professor Amerasinghe claims that \"a broad approach to the interpretation of this term in Article 25 is warranted\".215 Similarly, Professor Schreuer is reluctant as to the possibility to derive from the ICSID Convention itself a specific notion of \"investment\" that would delimit the scope of Art. 25(1) of the Convention in a meaningful way. He states that the \"only possible indication of an objective meaning that can be gleaned from the Convention is contained in the Preamble\u2019s first sentence [...] Therefore, it is arguable that the Convention\u2019s object and purpose indicate that there should be some positive impact on development.\"216 Furthermore, in the recent second edition of his ICSID Convention Commentary and already in view of the cases dealing with Argentine sovereign bonds pending before ICSID tribunals, Professor Schreuer specifically submits that \"[financial instruments such as loans or the purchase of bonds may qualify as investments\".217\n\n*Amerasinghe,* The Jurisdiction of the International Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes (note 101) 181.\n\n*Schreuer,* ICSID Convention Commentary, Art. 25, para. 121, with references to the pertinent case-law.\n\n*lb id.,* Art. 25, para. 149 with further references inn. 191.\n\n469.\n\nThis position is seconded by Georges R. Delaume according to whom it \"is within the sole discretion of each Contracting State to determine the type of investment disputes that it considers arbitrable in the context of ICSID\".218 In particular, he submits that \"the characterization of transnational loans as \u2018investments\u2019 has not raised difficulty [...] [F]rom the origin of the Convention [it has been assumed] that longer term loans were included in the concept of \u2018investment\u2019\".219 Compared to that, the dissenting voices have remained in the minority.220 Moreover, it is interesting to recall in this context that attempts were made in the drafting process of the ICSID Convention to eliminate its application to bonds, loans and capital flow, but all of these were rejected.221\n\n*G. R. Delaume,* ICSID and the Transnational Financial Community, 1 ICSID Review (1986) 237, at 242.\n\nSee *ibid.,* 239 and 240; see also *I.F.I. Shihata,* Towards a Greater Depoliticization of Investment Disputes: The Roles of ICSID and MIGA, 1 ICSID Review (1986) 1, at 4; see, however, the criticism by *Waibel,* Opening Pandora\u2019s Box (note 178) 722.\n\nSee, in particular, *Waibel,* Opening Pandora\u2019s Box (note 178); *id,* Sovereign Defaults before International Courts and Tribunals, Cambridge 2011, 219 *et seq.: Gaillard,* Identify or Define? (note 169) 404 *et seq.*\n\nSee references *supra* note 190. In particular, Australia\u2019s position according to which the draft of the Convention also covered phenomena such as the \"borrowing of cash by the host country from foreign private investors\" deserves mention; see Consultative Meeting of Legal Experts, Bangkok, 27 April-1 May 1946, in Documents Concerning the Origin and the Formulation of the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States (1968), Vol. II, 474.\n\n**(6) Conclusion**\n------------------\n\n470.\n\nAs a result, the Tribunal would conclude that the term \"investment\" in Art. 25 of the ICSID Convention, when interpreted in accordance with its ordinary meaning, in its context and in the light of the object and purpose of the Convention, is to be given a broad meaning, i.e. with jurisdictional limits arising from this provision only at the outer margins of economic activity.222 There is no need here for the Tribunal to decide the question whether one should go as far as including any \"plausibly economic activity or asset\" under the umbrella of Art. 25 of the Convention as long as States are prepared to subject it to ICSID jurisdiction.223 In fact, there are good reasons to leave a single commercial transaction such as the delivery of a single load of cars outside the concept of investment and thus outside the subject-matter jurisdiction of the Centre.224\n\nEven Professor Abi-Saab in his fervent Dissenting Opinion in the *Abaclat* case concedes in paras. 45, 46 that \"[i]t is true that the[] outer-limits [of the types of dispute that can be treated within ICSID] bound a vast ambit [...] leaving] much latitude and a wide margin of interpretation and further specification to States in their BITs\". He insists, however, that limits \"exist all the same\" and that the term \"investment\" in Art. 25(1) of the ICSID Convention is \"not infinitely elastic\", the latter statement referring to *Waibel,* Opening Pandora\u2019s Box (note 178) 722.\n\nSee notably *Mortenson,* The Meaning of \"Investment\" (note 183) 300.\n\nSee *Dolzer/Sehreuer,* Principles of International Investment Law (note 127) 70; *Schreuer,* ICSID Convention Commentary, Art. 25, para. 122; *Mortenson,* The Meaning of \"Investment\" (note 183) 269, n. 38 with further references; see *Fedax N.V. v. Venezuela,* ICSID Case No. ARB/96/3, Decision on Jurisdiction, 11 July 1997, para. 42; *Joy Mining Machinery Limited v. Egypt,* ICSID Case No. ARB/03/11, Award, 6 August 2004, paras. 43-45 and 52; see also the Dissenting Opinion of Professor Abi-Saab in the *Abaclat* case, para. 45, n. 7 with further references.\n\n471.\n\nSovereign bonds and security entitlements based thereupon are, however, in no way comparable to single commercial transactions. Notwithstanding the peculiarities of these financial instruments225, in the light of the broad understanding to be given to Art. 25 of the ICSID Convention, the Tribunal has no doubt that bonds/security entitlements such as those at stake in the present proceedings fall under the term \"investment\" as used in Art. 25 of the Convention.\n\nSee the description of the \"anomalous\" features of such financial instruments in the Dissenting Opinion of Professor Abi-Saab in the *Abaclat* case, para. 57: \"Such widely dispersed off-the shelf financial products, with their high velocity of circulation and their remoteness, the same as their holders, from the State in whose territory the investment is supposed to take place (being traded within seconds at the touch of a button in capital markets, with no involvement or knowledge of the borrowing country, nor passage through the territory or the legal system of that State), seem at first blush to be worlds apart from the direct foreign investment model, which is usually long negotiated and extensively embedded in the legal environment of the host State.\" See, in a similar vein, *ibid,* paras. 108 and 118.\n\n472.\n\nAccordingly, the Tribunal can see no reason why sovereign bonds/security entitlements should be excluded from the jurisdiction of the Centre and, for that matter, from the competence of this Tribunal, if and to the extent that there is evidence that the States parties, i.e. Argentina and Italy, considered those to be investments to be protected, in view of which they both gave their \"advance and irrevocable consent that any dispute [on this basis] may be submitted to arbitration\" (Art. 8(3) of the Argentina-Italy BIT). Hence, sovereign bonds/security entitlements are covered by the term \"investment\" in Art. 25(1) of the ICSID Convention.\n\n473.\n\nAgainst this background, there is no need to refer to Art. 32 of the VCLT, apart from noting that the account of the circumstances of the adoption of Art. 25(1) of the ICSID Convention \"confirms the meaning resulting from the application\" of Art. 31 of the VCLT, as provided for by Art. 32 of the Vienna Convention.\n\n474.\n\nAlternatively, even if one were not to endorse the Tribunal\u2019s conclusion as to the meaning of the term \"investment\" in Art. 25 of the ICSID Convention including bonds/security entitlements, one would at least have to concede that the meaning of the term was left \"ambiguous or obscure\". Art. 32 of the VCLT would then call for the use, as a supplementary means of interpretation, of the preparatory work of the treaty and the circumstances of its conclusion. As described above226, this would clearly point into the direction of the term \"investment\" as encompassing financial instruments such as bonds/security entitlements, subject to relevant statements on the part of the concerned States that would exclude such instruments from the scope of protected investments.\n\nSee *supra* paras. 448 *et seq.*\n\n**5.

Morocco227,* the Tribunal had to deal with the construction of a highway by Italian contractors in Morocco. The Respondent in this case argued that the construction contract did not constitute an investment. In order to answer this question, the Tribunal examined several criteria and concluded that the contract in question did qualify as an investment pursuant to the definition in the pertinent BIT in combination with Art. 25(1) of the ICSID Convention.228\n\n*Salini Costruttori S.p.A, and Italstrate S.p.A. v. Morocco,* ICSID Case No. ARB/00/4, Decision on Jurisdiction, 23 July 2001.\n\nSee *ibid.,* para. 45; see in this regard also *Schlemmer,* Investment, Investor, Nationality, and Shareholders (note 188) 67.\n\n476.\n\nSince then, several tribunals have proceeded in a similar fashion using similar criteria with the consequence that the test has become known as the *\"Salini* test\".229 With certain variations230, it includes the following elements: (a) the existence of a substantial contribution, (b) the project should have a certain duration, (c) participation in the risks of the transaction beyond the mere risk arising from a commercial transaction, (d) regularity of profit and return for the investors as well as (e) significance of the operation for the host State\u2019s development.231\n\nSee the discussion of cases in *Schreuer,* ICSID Convention Commentary, Art. 25, paras. 154 *et seq.* and 159, 160; *Dolzer/Schreuer,* Principles of International Investment Law (note 127) 68, 69; *Gaillard,* Identify or Define? (note 169) 404, 411; *Mortenson,* The Meaning of \"Investment\" (note 183) 274 *et seq.* and 277, n. 91-93 with further references.\n\nSee, e.g., *Joy Mining Machinery Limited v. Egypt,* ICSID Case No. ARB/03/11, Award, 6 August 2004, paras. 53-57; *Mortenson,* The Meaning of \"Investment\" (note 183) 273, n. 60-63 with further references.\n\nSee *Schreuer,* ICSID Convention Commentary, Art. 25, para. 153; *Schlemmer,* Investment, Investor, Nationality, and Shareholders (note 188) 65, with further references.\n\n477.\n\nOf particular relevance to the present case are the decisions in the *Fedax* and *Joy Mining* cases.232 In the first of these cases, *Fedax,* the question at stake was whether promissory notes would qualify as an investment, a question that was affirmed by the Tribunal.233 In contrast, in *Joy Mining234,* the Tribunal had to decide whether certain performance guarantees would amount to an investment. Arguing that there was no risk involved and that the relevant period was too short and also implicitly challenging whether the guarantees contributed to the economic development of the host country, the Tribunal concluded that the performance guarantees would not qualify as an investment.235\n\nAs to these two cases see also *infra* para. 467\n\n*Fedax N.V. v. Venezuela,* ICSID Case No. ARB/96/3, Decision on Jurisdiction, 11 July 1997, paras. 21-29 and 43.\n\n*Joy Mining Machinery Limited v. Egypt,* ICSID Case No. ARB/03/11, Award, 6 August 2004.\n\nSee *ibid.,* paras. 53-63; see also *Schlemmer,* Investment, Investor, Nationality, and Shareholders (note 188) 68 in this regard.\n\n478.\n\nThe *Salini* test and the afore-mentioned decisions have become the point of departure for a line of cases in which the deciding tribunals felt a need to fill the concept of \"investment\" in Art. 25(1) of the ICSID Convention with an independent meaning whose contours are considered to be expressed by the *Salini* criteria. This implies that an investment has to pass not only the threshold of the relevant BIT and the rather general requirements of an investment under Art. 25 of the ICSID Convention as set out before. It has to overcome, in addition, a higher hurdle that underlies the term \"investment\" in Art. 25, with a mandatory *Salini-style*\u00a0test. This approach has become the basis for a peculiar, and amplified, version of the double barreled test. As a result, what has occurred in several instances was that, while an economic operation or asset managed to pass the test in regard to the pertinent BIT, it failed to meet the standards purportedly governing, in the deciding tribunal\u2019s view, the application of Art. 25 of the ICSID Convention, thus leading to the tribunal in question dismissing the case for lack of jurisdiction *ratione materiae.*\n\n479.\n\nWhether one should rely on the *Salini* test at all and, in particular, whether the ICSID Convention justifies to construe it as embodying *jurisdictional* requirements, meaning that a lack of realization of one of the elements of the test would imply lack of jurisdiction and thus the duty for the Tribunal to dismiss the case, has been subject to controversy. The preceding analysis has also made clear that the present Tribunal endorses the view that the term \"investment\" in Art. 25(1) of the ICSID Convention should not be subjected to an unduly restrictive interpretation. Hence, the *Salini* criteria, if useful at all, must not be conceived of as expressing jurisdictional requirements *stricto sensu.*\n\n480.\n\nThe Commentary to the ICSID Convention to which both Parties have referred in the present case, approaches the matter in a similar fashion. In the Commentary\u2019s first edition, Professor Schreuer identified the five criteria enumerated above236 and characterized them as \"typical\" to \"most of the operations\" that have been subject to ICSID proceedings. He then added an important qualification: \"These features should not necessarily be understood as jurisdictional requirements but merely as typical characteristics of investments under the Convention.\"237 In the second edition of the Commentary, Professor Schreuer comments on the rise of the *Salini* test in these words: \"The development in practice from a descriptive list of typical features towards a set of mandatory legal requirements is unfortunate. The First Edition of this Commentary cannot serve as authority for this development.\"238\n\n*Schreuer,* ICSID Convention Commentary, 1st ed., Art. 25, para. 122: (a) \"a certain duration\" of the enterprise, (b) \"a certain regularity of profit and return\", (iii) an \"assumption of risk\", (iv) a \"substantial\" commitment by the investor, and (e) some \"significance for the host State\u2019s development\"; see *supra* para. 476.\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 122; see now *Schreuer,* ICSID Convention Commentary, Art. 25, para. 153.\n\n*Schreuer,* ICSID Convention Commentary, Art. 25, para. 171.\n\n481.\n\nFollowing Professor Schreuer\u2019s approach, the criteria assembled in the *Salini* test, while not constituting mandatory prerequisites for the jurisdiction of the Centre in the meaning of Art. 25 of the ICSID Convention, may still prove useful, provided that they are treated as guidelines and that they are applied in conjunction and in a flexible manner.239 In particular, they may help to identify, and exclude, extreme phenomena that must remain outside of even a broad reading of the term \"investment\" in Art. 25 of the ICSID Convention.240 Nonetheless, the basic character, and rationale, of the \"non-definition\" of investment allow Art. 25(1) of the ICSID Convention to cover a wide range of economic operations and assets, susceptible to include non-standard and atypical investments and capable of adapting to the evolving nature of economic activity.241\n\nSee *Salini Costruttori S.p.A, and Italstrate S.p.A. v. Morocco,* ICSID Case No. ARB/00/4, Decision on Jurisdiction, 23 July 2001, para. 52: \"In reality, these various elements may be interdependent [...] As a result, these various criteria should be assessed *globally* even if, for the sake of reasoning, the Tribunal considers them individually here.\" (emphasis added) See further *Schreuer,* ICSID Convention Commentary, Art. 25, paras. 171, 172 and 174 (\"In fact, tribunals have pointed out repeatedly that the criteria they applied were interrelated and should be looked at not in isolation but in conjunction. [... ] A rigid list of criteria that must be met in every case is not likely to facilitate the task of tribunals or to make decisions more predictable.\"), with further references; see also *Dolzer/Schreuer,* Principles of International Investment Law (note 127) 69, n. 141; *Schlemmer,* Investment, Investor, Nationality, and Shareholders (note 188) 66: \"Although these basic criteria are generally applied, it cannot be regarded as a *numerus clausus.* There are a number of instances, involving non-traditional types of investment transactions, where one cannot just rely on these criteria *in abstracto* but has to look at all the circumstances of the case in a flexible manner.\"\n\nSee *supra* para. 470.\n\nSee *Mihaly International Corporation v. Sri Lanka,* ICSID Case No. ARB/00/2, Award, 15 March 2002, para. 33 characterizing the fact that the term \"investment\" is left undefined by the ICSID Convention as \"preserving its integrity and flexibility and allowing for future progressive development of international law on the topic of investment\".\n\n***b) The application of the*** **Salini** ***test to the bonds/security entitlements in the present case***\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n482.\n\nHaving given the *\"Salini* test\" its proper place when assessing the jurisdiction *ratione materiae* in the present case, in the Tribunal\u2019s view, the bonds/security entitlements which are at stake in the present proceedings fulfill the criteria generally ascribed to the *Salini* test. In this context, the Tribunal would recall that it is important to bear in mind that the investment at stake constitutes an economic unity242 and should not be split up in separate economic operations.\n\nSee *supra* paras. 422 *et seq.*\n\n483.\n\nAs regards, first, the prerequisite of a *substantial contribution on the part of the investor243,* it is not relevant that the contribution of the single Claimant might have been minor. What counts is that the bonds issued as a whole amounted, without doubt, to a substantial contribution on the investors\u2019 part.\n\nSee in general *Schreuer,* ICSID Convention Commentary, Art. 25, para. 161 with further references; see also *Schlemmer,* Investment, Investor, Nationality, and Shareholders (note 188) 68; *Gaillard,* Identify or Define? (note 169)415,416.\n\n484.\n\nSecondly, while Respondent argues that the *minimum duration* for an investment is two to five years *(Tr p. 137/18)244* and that Claimants would generally not hold their security entitlements for that amount of time (or have at least not provided evidence for this), it is the duration of the bonds issued that is relevant. This was also confirmed in the *Fedax* case where the Tribunal accepted that the endorsement of negotiable promissory notes left the duration of the investment untouched.245\n\nSee in general *Schreuer,* ICSID Convention Commentary, Art. 25, paras. 162-170 and 173, 174; *Waibel,* Opening Pandora\u2019s Box (note 178) 724-726; *Gaillard,* Identify or Define? (note 169) 404, 405; see furthermore *Salini Costruttori S.p.A, and Italstrate S.p.A. v. Morocco,* ICSID Case No. ARB/00/4, Decision on Jurisdiction, 23 July 2001, para. 45.\n\nSee *Fedax N.V. v. Venezuela,* ICSID Case No. ARB/96/3, Decision on Jurisdiction, 11 July 1997, para. 43.\n\n485.\n\nThirdly, in terms of the requirement of an *operational* as opposed to a mere commercial risk, Respondent submits that the risk assumed by the Claimants of not being paid is not different from that involved in any commercial contract between a creditor and a debtor and that such ordinary commercial contracts cannot be considered an investment *(R I \u00a7\u00a7 164, 165).* However, given the risk of the host State\u2019s sovereign intervention, a risk that became manifest in Argentina\u2019s very default and restructuring, what is at stake is not an ordinary commercial risk.246\n\nAs to the generally generous application of this criterion see *Schreuer,* ICSID Convention Commentary, Art. 25, para. 163; see also *Waibel,* Opening Pandora\u2019s Box (note 178) 726; *Williams,* Jurisdiction and Admissibility (note 202) 880; *Gaillard,* Identify or Define? (note 169); *Mortenson,* The Meaning of \"Investment\" (note 183) 298, n. 220.\n\n486.\n\nFourthly, apart from the generally doubtful existence of the criterion of *regularity of profits and returns* as an independent element of the *Salini* test,247 the Respondent\u2019s argument that security entitlements are transferred easily and frequently cannot convince. Again, the bonds and security entitlements have to be deemed a single economic operation, with the interest supposed to be paid periodically satisfying the criterion of regularity of profits and returns.\n\nSee *Schreuer,* ICSID Convention Commentary, Art. 25, para. 157.\n\n487.\n\nFifthly, regarding the prerequisite of a *significant contribution to the development of the host country,* there can be no doubt, given the unity of the economic operation at stake, that the funds generated through the bonds issuance process were ultimately made available to Argentina and must be deemed to have contributed to Argentina\u2019s economic development.248 In view of the volume of the bonds involvement, the contribution was certainly significant to Argentina\u2019s development.249\n\nSee also *Abaclat* Decision, para. 378.\n\nAs to the controversial criterion of a contribution to the host State\u2019s development see *Schreuer,* ICSID Convention Commentary, Art. 25, para. 164 as well as paras. 173, 174: \"A test that turns on the contribution to the host State\u2019s development should be treated with particular care. [...] Any concept of economic development, if it were to serve as a yardstick for the existence of an investment and hence for protection under ICSID, should be treated with some flexibility.\" See also *Schlemmer,* Investment, Investor, Nationality, and Shareholders (note 188) 68; *Mortenson,* The Meaning of \"Investment\" (note 183) 274; *Waibel,* Opening Pandora\u2019s Box (note 178) 723, 724; *Gaillard,* Identify or Define? (note 169) 413, 414.\n\n**6. The meaning of \"investment\" under Art. 1(1) of the Argentina-Italy BIT**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n488.\n\nThe definition of the term \"investment\" in Art. 1(1) of the Argentina-Italy BIT contains a non-exhaustive list of different types of investments falling under the protective umbrella of the BIT *(arg.* \"the following are specifically, but not exclusively, considered to be investments\").250\n\nSee also the authentic Spanish and Italian versions: \"son considerados en particular como inversiones, aunque no en forma exclusiva\" and \"sono considerati specificamente come investimenti, anche se non in forma esclusiva\".\n\n489.\n\nIn particular, lit. c specifically addresses financial instruments. However, there has been strong disagreement between the Parties as to how to properly understand the terms used in the authentic Spanish and Italian versions of the BIT251 and how to adequately translate them into English. In particular, it has been controversial whether the term \"obligaciones\" in Spanish and \"obbligazioni\" in Italian should be translated as \"bonds\", as suggested by the Claimants, or \"obligations\", as contended by the Respondent.\n\nSee the authentic Spanish and Italian versions: \"obligaciones, t\u00edtulos p\u00fablicos o privados o cualquier otro derecho a prestaciones o servicios que tengan un valor econ\u00f3mico, como tambi\u00e9n las ganacias capitalizadas\" and \"obbligazioni, titoli pubblici o private o qualsiasi altro diritto per prestazioni o servizi che abbiano un valore econ\u00f3mico, como altresi redditi capitalizzati\".\n\n490.\n\nThe Tribunal considers in this regard that whatever position one wants to take on the translation issue, there can be no doubt that Art. 1(1) of the Argentina-Italy BIT covers the bonds/security entitlements at stake in the present proceedings.\n\n491.\n\nTo begin with, even following the Respondent\u2019s argument as to the translation of the terms \"obligaciones\" and \"obbligazioni\", this would only mean to replace the concept of \"bonds\" by the admittedly broader concept of \"obligations\" which would, however, still include bonds/security entitlements. While the Respondent has focused its argument on the translation issue, it has not explained to the satisfaction of the Tribunal how one could derive from the wording of the Spanish and Italian authentic versions that the Parties excluded bonds/security entitlements from the purview of the Argentina-Italy BIT because they did not use the words \"bonos\" in Spanish and \"titoli obbligazionari\" in Italian *(R II \u00a7\u00a7 292, 296).* At most, it might be argued that the Parties opted to use a generic term covering all types of obligations, thus including bonds/security entitlements. Had the Parties sought to actually exclude those instruments from the scope of the application of the BIT, they would have had to say so explicitly.\n\n492.\n\nThis conclusion is corroborated by the fact that lit. c further includes \"any other right to benefits or services with an economic value\".252 The use of this residual or \"catch-all\" clause clearly indicates that the Parties to the Argentina-Italy BIT sought to make lit. c a comprehensive provision encompassing all types of obligations and comparable rights as long as they have an economic value. It is obvious that the very object of such residual clause is to include all rights having an economic value, even if they were to be deemed to be \"non-standard\" or \"atypical\", rather than excluding any such right, without a very specific reason to do so. Yet, such a reason has not been brought to the fore during the present proceedings.\n\nTranslation of the Respondent; see also the Claimants\u2019 translation: \"any other right for performances or services that have an economic value\" (see *supra* para. 418).\n\n493.\n\nMoreover, in the same spirit, Art. 1(1)(f) of the Argentina-Italy BIT contains a further catch-all clause bringing \"any right of an economic nature granted by law or by contract\"253 into the purview of the BIT. The Tribunal seconds the finding of the majority decision in the *Abaclat* case which, pronouncing itself on its jurisdiction on the basis of the same Argentina-Italy BIT, concluded that \"the definition provided for in Art. 1(1) is not drafted in a restrictive way. Based on its wording, Art. 1(1) cannot be seen to have intended to adopt a restrictive approach with regard to what kind of activity or dealing was meant to qualify as an investment.\"254 Given this state of affairs, the present Tribunal thus cannot see how it could be concluded that the bonds/security entitlements at stake in the present proceedings would not fall under at least one of these provisions.\n\nTranslation of the Respondent; see also the Claimants\u2019 translation: \"any right having an economic value conferred by law or contract\" (see *supra* para. 418).\n\n*Abaclat* Decision, para. 354.\n\n494.\n\nIt deserves particular mention that this was also the position taken by Professor Abi-Saab in his Dissenting Opinion in the *Abaclat* case in which he was otherwise very critical of the approach taken by the majority decision recognizing bonds/security entitlements as \"investments\" under the relevant provisions of the ICSID Convention and the Argentina-Italy BIT. Professor Abi-Saab specifically stated that \"Article 1/1/c covers financial instruments, and that its language is large enough to encompass the security entitlements in the Argentinean bonds\".255\n\nDissenting Opinion of Professor Abi-Saab in the *Abaclat* case, para. 68; see, in a similar vein, *Waibel,* Opening Pandora\u2019s Box (note 178) 730.\n\n495.\n\nHence, the Tribunal is fully convinced that the bonds/security entitlements pertinent to the present case fall into the scope of application of the list of investments laid down in Art. 1 (1)(a)-(f) of the Argentina-Italy BIT.\n\n**7. Investment made \"in the territory\" of Argentina**\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n496.\n\nIt is agreed between the Parties that, in addition to having to fall into the afore-mentioned list of investments, the chapeau of Art. 1(1) of the Argentina-Italy BIT further requires that the contribution at stake be invested \"in the territory\" of the host State in order for the contribution to qualify as a protected investment \"for the purposes of this Agreement\". This territoriality requirement is reinforced by being repeated in the second preambular paragraph and in Art. 1(2) of the Argentina-Italy BIT.\n\n497.\n\nThe Parties have expressed very different views on the question whether the territoriality requirement is met in the present case. Respondent submits, in essence, that it is impossible for a financial instrument which was issued outside Argentine territory and is not physically held in Argentina, which is subject to foreign laws and enforceable in foreign jurisdictions, which is registered in the accounts of banks located outside Argentina and whose proceeds did not accrue to Argentina, to qualify as an investment \"in the territory\" of Argentina. Claimants reject this argument and focus on who benefitted from the investments in question in order to identify the *situs* of the investment at stake. The Claimants do not consider choice of law and forum clauses pointing to other legal orders than Argentine law to prove an investment to be a non-Argentine one.\n\n498.\n\nThe Tribunal would consider in regard to the territoriality requirement, as enshrined in Art. 1(1) of the Argentina-Italy BIT, that, given the character of the investments at stake, the decisive criterion cannot be whether those are physically located in Argentina, as suggested by the Respondent. By their very nature, financial instruments such as bonds/security entitlements are not physical investments such as a piece of land, an industrial plant or a mine, as correctly pointed out by the Claimants.\n\n499.\n\nThe Tribunal is convinced that, in order to identify in which State\u2019s territory an investment was made, one has to determine first which State benefits from this investment. Most observers will agree that the one criterion which may be taken from the ICSID Convention itself when it comes to determining the nature of an investment under this Convention, is that of a contribution \"for economic development\", as referred to in the first preambular paragraph of the ICSID Convention.256 Accordingly, to assess where an investment was made, the criterion must be to whose economic development an investment contributed.\n\nSee *Schreuer,* ICSID Convention Commentary, Art. 25, para. 121, with references to the pertinent case-law (n. 145): \"only possible indication of an objective meaning that can be gleaned from the Convention is contained in the Preamble\u2019s first sentence [...] Therefore, it is arguable that the Convention\u2019s object and purpose indicate that there should be some positive impact on development.\"\n\n500.\n\nThe present Tribunal thus cannot come to any other conclusion than identifying the Respondent as the beneficiary of the investment at stake in the present proceedings. It would like to recall, in this context, the importance to conceive of the investment in question as a unified economic operation.257 The whole bond issuing process, notably including the circulation of security entitlements on the secondary market, was devised -and specifically intended by the Respondent itself - to raise money for the budgetary needs of Argentina and thus to further the development of that State.\n\nSee *supra* para. 429.\n\n501.\n\nHence, the Tribunal cannot endorse the argument made by the Respondent that, while the issuance of the bonds might have benefitted Argentina and might have allowed it to refinance part of its foreign debt, the proceeds of Claimants\u2019 purchases of security entitlements did not accrue to the Respondent *(R II \u00a7 357),* since such an approach ignores the realities of the bond issuing process and negates the very reasons for which the Respondent undertook to issue the bonds in question with the underwriters.\n\n502.\n\nIn this context, the present Tribunal is also sympathetic to the statement by the *Abaclat* Tribunal258 which endorsed an analogous type of reasoning and found\n\nthat the determination of the place of the investment depends, in the first instance, on the nature of such investment. With regard to an investment of a purely financial nature, the relevant criteria cannot be the same as those applying to an investment consisting of business operations and/or involving manpower and property. With regard to investments of a purely financial nature, the relevant criteria should be where and/or for the benefit of whom the funds are ultimately used, and not the place where the funds were paid out or transferred. Thus, the relevant question is were the invested funds ultimately made available to the Host State and did they support the latter\u2019s economic development?259\n\n*Abaclat* Decision, para. 374.\n\nIn this regard, the *Abaclat* Tribunal notably refers to *Fedax N.V. v. Venezuela,* ICSID Case No. ARB/96/3, Decision on Jurisdiction, 11 July 1997, para. 41 : \"It is a standard feature of many international financial transactions that the funds involved are not physically transferred to the territory of the beneficiary, but put at its disposal elsewhere. In fact, many loans and credits do not leave the country of origin at all, but are made available to suppliers and other entities. [...] The important question is whether the funds made available are utilized by the beneficiary of the credit, as in the case of the Republic of Venezuela, so as to finance its various governmental needs. It is not disputed in this case that the Republic of Venezuela, by means of the promissory notes, received an amount of credit hat was put to work during a period of time for its financial needs.\" See further *SGS Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale de Surveillance S.A. v. Pakistan,* ICSID Case No. ARB/01/13, Decision on Jurisdiction, 6 August 2003, paras. 136-140, where emphasis was laid on the fact that the aim of SGS\u2019s activity was to \"raise the financial revenue of the State\" *(ibid.,* para. 139); *SGS Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale de Surveillance S.A. v. Philippines,* ICSID Case No. ARB/02/6, Decision on Jurisdiction, 29 January 2004, para. 111; *Ceskoslovenska obchodn\u00ed bank\u00e1, A.S. v. Slovakia,* ICSID Case No. ARB/97/4, Decision on Objections to Jurisdiction, 24 May 1999, paras. 78, 79. See furthermore, *Schreuer,* ICSID Convention Commentary, Art. 25, paras. 192 *et seq.,* notably paras. 197, 198: \"Where the document providing the basis of consent refers to investment in the territory of a State, a certain degree of flexibility is appropriate. Not all investment activities are physically located on the host State. This is particularly true of financial instruments. [...] If a treaty includes loans and claims to money in its definition of investment, it would be unrealistic to require a physical presence in or a transfer of funds into the host State [...] In cases involving financial obligations the *locus* of the investment can often be determined by reference to the debtor and its location. In this way financial instruments issued by States have their *situs* in that State.\"\n\n503.\n\nSimilarly, the Tribunal does not see any need for the Claimants to prove that the funds in question can be traced to a specific project, enterprise or activity in the host State\u2019s territory. Nowhere in the Argentina-Italy BIT can such \"specificity requirement\" complementing the prerequisite of territoriality be found.260 Claimants are right to point out that the proceeds of the bond issuances were, at least in the beginning, included in Argentina\u2019s official budget and that the pertinent Argentine legislation had to provide that the purpose of each financing must be authorized and specified by the law (C *IV \u00a7 45, 47)261*\n\nSee also *Abaclat* Decision, para. 375: \"A further question is whether it is necessary that investment of purely financial nature be further linked to a specific economic enterprise or operation taking place in the territory of the Host State. Based on the above consideration that in Art. 1 of their BIT, Argentina and Italy designated financial instruments as an express kind of investment covered by the BIT and thereby intending to provide such investment with BIT protection, the Tribunal considers that it would be contrary to the BIT\u2019s wording and aim to attach a further condition to the protection of financial investment instruments.\"\n\nSee also *Abaclat* Decision, para. 44 where it is mentioned that the issuance of Argentina\u2019s sovereign bonds, as governed by Law No. 24,156 on Financial Administration and Control Systems (LFA), required that either a specific law must authorize the loan or that it must be included in a general authorization contained in the annual budget law. Therein, amongst others, the \"purpose of financing\" must be specified (see Art. 60 LFA; see also *C IV \u00a7 45,* referring to Art. 56 LFA).\n\n504.\n\nTo which extent and in which ways those funds made available to the Respondent were actually used for promoting the economic development of Argentina does not fall into the sphere of the Claimants. Nor is it relevant whether the individual Claimants, when purchasing the security entitlements, actually believed or were aware that they were making \"an investment in Argentina\". It suffices that, by virtue of the bonds issuance process and the circulation of bonds/security entitlements, funds were made available to the Respondent that were at its disposal to foster its economic development, and this notably suffices to qualify the investment at stake as one made \"in the territory\" of Argentina.\n\n505.\n\nAgain, the Tribunal deems it appropriate to point out that the *Abaclat* Tribunal reached a similar conclusion when finding that\n\n[t]here is no doubt that the funds generated through the bonds issuance process were ultimately made available to Argentina, and served to finance Argentina\u2019s economic development. Whether the funds were actually used to repay preexisting debts of Argentina or whether they were used in government spending is irrelevant. In both cases, it was used by Argentina to manage its finances, and as such must be considered to have contributed to Argentina\u2019s economic development and thus to have been made in Argentina.262\n\n*Abaclat* Decision, para. 378.\n\n506.\n\nIn contrast, the Tribunal would not attribute particular significance to the fact that the different contracts involved in the complex machinery and on the different levels of the bonds issuing process are governed by non-Argentine laws and enforceable in non-Argentine jurisdictions. The Claimants\u2019 argument that an investment project physically located in the Respondent\u2019s territory but in case of which the relevant contracts contain choice of law and forum clauses pointing to other legal orders than that of Argentina, would still be considered an investment project in the territory of the Respondent *(CI \u00a7\u00a7 287, 288; Tr p. 192/6),* is persuasive in the eyes of the Tribunal.\n\n507.\n\nIn addition, inasmuch as Respondent contends that it could not exercise any sovereign right in respect of Claimants\u2019 alleged investments, the Tribunal is not convinced by this argument. It was notably through the operation of Law No. 26,017263 that the Respondent sought to influence the terms of the bonds/security entitlements issued by it. In addition, nowhere in the ICSID Convention or the Argentina-Italy BIT it is said that an investment may only be considered to be made in the territory of the host State if that State can exercise full sovereign rights or, for that matter, otherwise full control in regard to those investments.\n\nSee *infra* note 285.\n\n508.\n\nIn sum, the Tribunal is convinced that, looking at the investment operation at stake as a whole and in terms of its economic realities, it is hard to imagine the investment\u2019s *situs* to be elsewhere than in Argentina. While the Respondent is right to point out that a number of \"connecting factors\" *(RIV p. 15)* do not point to Argentina, the Tribunal cannot join the Respondent\u2019s conclusion that the investment was not made in the Respondent\u2019s territory since the decisive elements, notably the fact that the funds involved were destined to contribute to Argentina\u2019s economic development and were actually made available to it for that purpose, qualify the investments pertinent to the present case as having been made in Argentina.\n\n509.\n\nIn regard to the bonds/security entitlements at stake, the only alternative conclusion to be drawn would be to state that those have their *situs* nowhere, as the Respondent could not point to any other jurisdiction that would have closer links to the investments at issue. This would, however, imply that those investments fall out of the protection of investment law completely. Yet, as far as the present Tribunal is concerned, such position cannot be reconciled with the obvious intent of the Parties, when concluding the Argentina-Italy BIT, to make Art. 1(1) of the BIT cover various types of obligations, including financial instruments such as bonds/security entitlements, in view of which they must have been aware that those would often have a *situs* not as clearly identifiable as that of a mine or industrial plant.\n\n510.\n\nConsequently, the Tribunal concludes that the bonds/security entitlements at stake in the present proceedings are investments made in the territory of Argentina for the purposes of Art. 1(1) of the Argentina-Italy BIT.\n\n**8. Investment made \"in accordance with the laws and regulations\" of Argentina**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n511.\n\nFinally, the Respondent has pointed to a further requirement contained in the chapeau of Art. 1(1) of the Argentina-Italy BIT, namely that the investment in question must be \"in accordance with the laws and regulations\" of the host State, in order for an investment to fall within the scope of application *ratione materiae* of the BIT.\n\n512.\n\nThe Tribunal does not see any reason why the investments at stake should not be in accordance with the laws and regulations of the host State, i.e. Argentina. During the proceedings, no argument has been brought before the Tribunal that the bonds/security entitlements would have violated any provision of Argentine law.\n\n513.\n\nHowever, the Respondent submits that, according to Art. 8(7) of the Argentina-Italy BIT, the Tribunal \"shall make its decision based on the laws of the Contracting Party involved in the dispute - including its rules on conflict of laws -, the provisions of this Agreement, the terms of any particular agreements entered into regarding the investment, as well as applicable principles of international law\". The Respondent further contends that Argentine law provides that the validity and nature of contracts executed outside Argentina shall be governed by the laws of the place where the contract was executed, i.e. Italy, so that Italian law is to be applied to the security entitlements at hand *(RI\u00a7 205; Tr p. 144/21).*\n\n514.\n\nIn that respect, the Tribunal would endorse the position of the *Abaclat* Tribunal which understands Art. 8(7) of the Argentina-Italy BIT as dealing exclusively with the law applicable to the merits of the dispute, but not as serving as a basis to extend the definition of investment as provided for in Art. 1(1) of the BIT, as these two provisions \"have different contexts and different purposes\".264\n\nSee *Abaclat* Decision, para. 383.\n\n515.\n\nThe present Tribunal would recall in this regard that it already addressed a related question, pertaining to the consent of the Claimants, more particularly regarding the question of the purported invalidity of the Power of Attorney. The Tribunal concluded that this question must be dealt with solely on the basis of Art. 25(1) of the ICSID Convention (as the pertinent provision for assessing questions of jurisdiction), as opposed to Art. 42 of the Convention which is supposed to address the law applicable to the merits of the dispute.265 Against this background, the Tribunal takes the position that an analogous reasoning should apply *mutatis mutandis* to the question at stake here.\n\nSee *supra* paras. 233 *et seq.*\n\n516.\n\nIn addition, this result also makes sense in the light of the object and purpose of this provision. The Tribunal would agree with the submission of the Claimants that the provisions of the host State\u2019s law contemplated by the \"in accordance with the laws and regulations\" clause essentially relate to \"the rules of public law or administrative law of the host State that forbid certain types of investments or require that these be made respecting certain principles aimed at protecting the interests of the host State\" *(C I \u00a7 300).* Hence, economic operations shall notably be excluded from the purview of protected investments when they are not compatible with the *ordre public* of the host State.\n\n517.\n\nIn conclusion, the question of jurisdiction *ratione materiae* in respect of the \"in accordance with the laws and regulations\" clause must be solved on the sole basis of Art. 1(1) of the BIT, i.e. by reference to Argentine law, and not by relying upon Art. 8(7) of the BIT. Accordingly, as there is no indication whatsoever that provisions of Argentine law have been violated by the bonds/security entitlements pertinent to the present case, the Tribunal must conclude that also this requirement of jurisdiction *ratione materiae* is fulfilled.\n\n518.\n\nYet, even if one were to adopt the position that Italian substantive law was applicable to the question at stake, this would not lead to a different outcome. Assuming *arguendo* that the selling restrictions on security entitlements contained in Italian law reached the extent which has been suggested by the Respondent, the purported illegality would not have been committed by the Claimants, but by a third party, namely Italian banks and financial intermediaries. Furthermore, this illegality would have been committed at the expense of the Claimants themselves, and not to the detriment of the Respondent. Given that the \"in accordance with the law and regulations\" clause serves to protect the host State\u2019s *ordre public,* the Tribunal cannot see how such violations of Italian law, even if proved to have taken place, could negatively affect the qualification of the investments at stake as being in accordance with the laws and regulations of the host State.266\n\nSee also *Abaclat* Decision, para. 385 in that regard: \"The alleged breach of applicable regulations on which Respondent relies, concerns breaches allegedly committed by the Italian banks and not by Claimants. Such breaches should not be relevant for the purpose of examining Claimants\u2019 rights and Argentina\u2019s obligations under the BIT. As such, an alleged misconduct of the Italian banks may not render the security entitlements unlawful pursuant to Art. 1 para. 1 of the Argentina-Italy BIT.\"\n\n519.\n\nConsequently, the bonds/security entitlements were made in accordance with the laws and regulations of Argentina pursuant to Art. 1(1) of the Argentina-Italy BIT.\n\n**9. Conclusion**\n-----------------\n\n520.\n\nHaving rejected all preliminary objections of the Respondent as to the purported lack of jurisdiction *ratione materiae* and having assured itself that all requirements in this regard are satisfied in respect of the pertinent bonds and security entitlements, both under Art. 25 of the ICSID Convention and Art. 1(1) of the Argentina-Italy BIT, the Tribunal concludes that, as far as the requirement of the existence of a legal dispute arising directly out of an investment is concerned, there exists jurisdiction of the Centre and, for that matter, competence of the present Tribunal to decide the case at hand.\n\n**V. EXISTENCE OF** ***PRIMA FACIE*** **TREATY CLAIMS**\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n**A. Positions of the Parties**\n-------------------------------\n\n**1. Contentions by Respondent**\n--------------------------------\n\n521.\n\nThe Respondent submits that it is well established that an international court or tribunal must satisfy itself, at the jurisdictional stage, that the case presented by a claimant is capable of coming within the provisions of the treaty that has been invoked *(RI \u00a7 217; R III \u00a7 150; Tr p. 97/21).* As regards this so-called *prima facie* test, in the Respondent\u2019s opinion, the allegations pleaded by Claimants are not capable of establishing the violations of the provisions of the Argentina-Italy BIT invoked in the Request *(R I \u00a7 219).* Nowhere do the Claimants explain how their claims - first focusing on a claim for failure to pay the debt, then drawing more upon the 2005 Exchange Offer and Law No. 26,017 *(R II \u00a7\u00a7 362, 363) -* constitute a violation of the Argentina-Italy BIT *(R II 365).*\n\n522.\n\nIn this context, Respondent points out that the host State is responsible for breach of an investment treaty only when it acts in the exercise of its governmental or sovereign authority rather than merely as a commercial party *(R I \u00a7 220; R III \u00a7 153; Tr p. 96/9).* For this purpose, account is to be taken of the nature of the relevant act, not of its form. Even where the State has acted through laws and decrees, such act may be commercial in nature, especially in the context of the present case *(RIII \u00a7 154; Tr pp. 102/22, 375/2).*\n\n523.\n\nRespondent insists that it was impossible for it to exercise sovereign authority in regard to the Claimants\u2019 security entitlements and the underlying bonds since these are governed by foreign law and enforceable in foreign jurisdictions. These bonds and security entitlements are therefore beyond the scope of Argentina\u2019s legislative jurisdiction so that the Respondent could not and did not alter or cancel the Claimants\u2019 rights. A State\u2019s sovereign power to prescribe and enforce legal rights is by definition limited to its own legal jurisdiction, and it thus cannot affect rights under another State\u2019s laws or foreign courts *(RI \u00a7 223; RII \u00a7\u00a7 368, 373; R III \u00a7 155; Tr p. 101/3).*\n\n524.\n\nIn particular, the Exchange Offer launched by Respondent in 2005 was absolutely voluntary at all times. It was only a payment proposal and a restructuring offer which bondholders were not forced to accept, nor could Argentina have forced them to do so. Law No. 26,017 does not modify significantly the substantive rights of those who did not accept the 2005 Exchange Offer *(R II \u00a7\u00a7 369, 370; R III \u00a7 156; Tr p. 102/4).*\n\n525.\n\nInasmuch as the Claimants argue that there is jurisdiction over their claim for fair and equitable treatment based on the Respondent\u2019s refusal to repay and to reasonably restructure its debt, such a refusal to repay does not constitute a basis of jurisdiction because non-payment in itself is no violation of international law. Furthermore, in the Respondent\u2019s opinion, fair and equitable treatment does not prohibit debtors from offering options for the repayment of obligations in situations of need and, for that matter, from restructuring its debt in accordance with their real ability to pay *(RI \u00a7 228; RII \u00a7 366; RIII \u00a7 159).*\n\n526.\n\nThe allegations that Claimants cite in support of their purported expropriation claim are obviously wrong because the bonds at stake were not taken away from the Claimants, rather, they remain in full property of those titles. These allegations are simply assertions that Argentina did not pay Claimants their contract claims, a complaint about a failure to pay that does not amount to expropriation under international law *(R I \u00a7\u00a7 230, 231; Tr pp. 104/7, 380/15).*\n\n527.\n\nFinally, insofar as the Claimants seek to rely on the full protection and security clause through the most-favoured nation clause of the Argentina-Italy BIT, they do, in the eyes of the Respondent, not offer any argument as to how this clause would allow the inclusion of an extraneous right into the BIT *(RI \u00a7 236).*\n\n***2.*** **Contentions by Claimants**\n-------------------------------------\n\n528.\n\nThe Claimants argue that they have established a *prima facie* violation of a series of provisions of the Argentina-Italy BIT *(Request \u00a7\u00a7 39 et seq.; CI \u00a7 338; CII \u00a7 134; Tr p. 162/18).*\n\n529.\n\nFirst, by eliminating the bondholders\u2019 rights to capital and interest and by refusing to restore their rights even after Argentina\u2019s economic situation came back to normal, Respondent committed a gross violation of the obligation to protect the investors\u2019 legitimate expectations, to respect the stability of the investment environment as well as the requirements of reasonableness, proportionality and due process. Accordingly, the Respondent violated the duty to accord fair and equitable treatment under Art. 2 of the Argentina-Italy BIT *(Request \u00a7\u00a7 40 et seq.; C III\u00a7\u00a7 43, 44).*\n\n530.\n\nSecondly, given the fact that Respondent used its sovereign powers to deprive the bondholders of all their economic rights and failed to restore their rights, there is a violation of the Respondent\u2019s obligation to refrain from measures of expropriation of the investors\u2019 right and property, without immediate, adequate and effective compensation, as prescribed in Art. 5 of the Argentina-Italy BIT *(Request \u00a7\u00a7 51 et seq.; C III \u00a7\u00a7 45, 46).*\n\n531.\n\nThirdly, according to the Claimants, while not laid down explicitly in the BIT, the obligation of full protection and security is applicable in the present case via the most-favoured nation clause of Art. 3 of the Argentina-Italy BIT which renders applicable Art. 2(2)(a) of the Argentina-US BIT that contains such an obligation. This duty was violated by Respondent\u2019s failure to provide a secure and transparent legal environment to the bondholders *(Request \u00a7\u00a7 61 et seq.; CIII\u00a7\u00a7 47, 48).*\n\n532.\n\nThe Claimants resist the Respondent\u2019s attempt to downgrade the dispute to a contract dispute. They thus reject the defense that the claims brought in the present arbitration relate to a mere failure to pay, which as such cannot be characterized as a violation of the BIT, and that Argentina\u2019s acts complained of by the Claimants were not carried out in the exercise of the Respondent\u2019s sovereign capacity *(CI \u00a7 323; C III \u00a7 51; Tr p. 165/7).* On the contrary, the present case concerns precisely the consequences of a legislative act on the part of Argentina, i.e. Law No. 26,017, which led to the total and irreversible annihilation of Claimants\u2019 rights. A legislative act is the most typical manifestation of a sovereign act (C *I \u00a7\u00a7 328, 329; C II \u00a7 127, 130)* because non-participating holders lost any rights under the bonds (C *II \u00a7 132).* The situation at hand is therefore not an ordinary breach of contract, but a straightforward and paradigmatic violation of a treaty obligation *(CI \u00a7 332; CIV\u00a7 71).*\n\n533.\n\nIn this regard, the fact that the bonds/security entitlements were stipulated to be governed by a foreign law and submitted to the jurisdiction of foreign courts is not sufficient to put them beyond the reach of the Respondent\u2019s legislative jurisdiction. Argentina was at the same time the debtor of the bonds and the holder of sovereign power on its territory and it maintained the full power to modify its obligations *(CI \u00a7 330; CII \u00a7 130; C III \u00a7 52; Tr p. 166/4).*\n\n**B. Findings of the Tribunal**\n-------------------------------\n\n534.\n\nWhile the Parties agree that there exists a \"legal dispute\" within the meaning of Art. 25(1) of the ICSID Convention *(Tr p. 167/13),* it is contested whether the claims submitted to the Tribunal fall within the scope of protection of the Argentina-Italy BIT. In this regard, the Respondent argues that the claims at stake are of a merely contractual character and that they do not arise out of rights and obligations contained in the BIT, whereas Claimants state the opposite. In particular, the Claimants request the Tribunal to declare that \"the Respondent has breached its international obligations under the BIT and international law by failing to ensure equitable treatment and full protection and security to their investments and by expropriating such investments without prompt, adequate and immediate compensation\" *(Request \u00a7 90).*\n\n535.\n\nWhatever position one might want to adopt in this regard, the Respondent is right to contend that it is necessary for an international tribunal to satisfy itself, at the jurisdictional stage, that the case presented by a claimant is capable of coming with the provisions of the treaty that has been invoked in the dispute at hand *(R I \u00a7 217; RIII \u00a7 150),* i.e. in the present case the Argentina-Italy BIT. This refers to the so-called *prima facie* test, an exercise to which the Tribunal will turn now.\n\n536.\n\nIn this regard, the Tribunal takes note of the fact that the *Abaclat* Tribunal has engaged in a persuasive analysis of the issues in question267, in relation to mostly the same provisions of the Argentina-Italy BIT which are also relied upon by the Claimants here. Following its general approach to take inspiration from the *Abaclat* Decision, wherever applicable and appropriate,268 the present Tribunal considers it both useful and legitimate to draw on its sister Tribunal\u2019s reasoning when addressing the question of the existence of *prima facie* claims subsequently.\n\nSee in particularrt\u00e8acto Decision, paras. 311-332.\n\nSee *supra* para. 12.\n\n**1. Basis of the** ***prima facie*** **test**\n----------------------------------------------\n\n537.\n\nAs convincingly stated by the *Abaclat* Tribunal, \"according to generally accepted practice, the task of the Tribunal at the stage of determining whether it has jurisdiction to hear a claim under an investment treaty merely consists in determining whether the facts alleged by the claimant(s), if established, are capable of constituting a breach of the provisions of the BIT which have been invoked\".269 And the *Abaclat* Tribunal continues: \"In performing this task, the Tribunal applies a *prima facie* standard, both to the determination of the meaning and scope of the relevant BIT provisions invoked as well as to the assessment of whether the facts alleged may constitute breaches of these provisions on its face. In the words of the tribunal in *Saipem v. Bangladesh;* \u2018If the result is affirmative, jurisdiction will be established, but the existence of breaches will remain to be litigated on the merits.\u2019\"270\n\n*Abaclat* Decision, para. 303, referring to *Saipem S.p.A. v. Bangladesh,* ICSID Case No. ARB/05/07, Decision on Jurisdiction and Recommendation on Provisional Measures, 21 March 2007, paras. 84 *et seq.,* in particular para. 91.\n\n*Abaclat* Decision, para. 303, referring to the afore-mentioned *Saipem v. Bangladesh* case, para. 91.\n\n538.\n\nIn a similar vein, it has been stated that\n\n[t]he prima-facie test is firmly established as the threshold test for establishing jurisdiction *ratione materiae* in investment treaty cases. The formulation of the approach and of the prima-facie test, which appears to find most favour, is the following: \"The tribunal should be satisfied that, if the facts alleged by the claimant ultimately prove true, they would be capable of falling within (or coming within) (or constituting a violation of) the provisions of the investment treaty.\" This formulation has received particular endorsement by the tribunals in *Salini* v *Jordan, Impregilo v Pakistan,* and *Saipem v Bangladesh.* The semantic differences in wording between \u2018falling within\u2019 or \u2018coming within\u2019 or \u2018constituting a violation of have been said to be of little importance.271\n\n*A. Sheppard,* The Jurisdictional Threshold of a Prima-Facie Case, in: P. Muchlinksi et al., The Oxford Handbook of International Investment Law, Oxford 2008, 932, at 960, referring to *Salini Costruttori S.p.A, and Italstrate S.p.A.* *v. Morocco,* ICSID Case No. ARB/00/4, Decision on Jurisdiction, 23 July 2001, para. 151; *Impregilo, S.p.A. v. Pakistan,* ICSID Case No. ARB/03/3, Decision on Jurisdiction, 22 April 2005, paras. 237-254; *Saipem S.p.A. v. Bangladesh,* ICSID Case No. ARB/05/7, Decision on Jurisdiction and Recommendation on Provisional Measures, 21 March 2007, paras. 84-91.\n\n539.\n\nFurthermore, it has been said that\n\nTribunals have developed a practice under which they will apply a *prima facie* test as to the merits of the case at the stage of determining jurisdiction. It is applied especially where the claim alleges the violation of a treaty that is invoked as the basis of jurisdiction [...] [The test] requires that the facts alleged by the claimant, if established, are capable of forming the basis for a treaty violation. Tribunals have applied this test in a large number of cases. It does not appear to be controversial in principle.272\n\n*Schreuer,* ICSID Convention Commentary, Art. 41, paras. 86, 87, with further references; see also *ibid.,* Art. 41, paras. 88-92 and Art. 42, paras. 117, 118.\n\n540.\n\nThe *prima facie* test is commonly traced back to the *Mavrommatis* Judgment of the Permanent Court of International Justice273 and the *Ambatielos* Judgment of the International Court of Justice274 as well as, in particular, to the latter Court's 1996 Judgment on Preliminary Objection in the *Oil Platforms* case275 and the Separate Opinions of Judges Shahabuddeen and Higgins in that case.276\n\n*Mavrommatis Palestine Concessions (Greece* v. *United Kingdom), Judgment, 30 August 1924,* PCIJ Series A, No. 2, 16.\n\n*Ambatielos (Greece* v. *United Kingdom), Merits: Obligation to Arbitrate, Judgment,* ICJ Reports 1952, 10, 18.\n\nSee *Oil Platforms (Iran* v. *USA), Preliminary Objection, Judgment,* ICJ Reports 1996, 803, paras. 16 *et seq.*\n\nSee *ibid.,* 822 *et seq.* and 847 *et seq.* (notably at 586, para. 33); see further *Sheppard,* The Jurisdictional Threshold of a Prima-Facie Case (note 271) 934-938; *Schreuer,* ICSID Convention Commentary, Art. 41, para. 86; *Zeiler,* Jurisdiction, Competence, and Admissibility Claims in ICSID Arbitration Proceedings, in: C. Binder et al. (eds.), International Investment Law for the 21st Century: Essays in Honour of Christoph Scheuer, Oxford, 2009, 76, at 86, 87.\n\n**2. Alleged breaches of the Argentina-Italy BIT**\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n541.\n\nHaving the afore-mentioned test in mind, for the purposes of assuring itself of its jurisdiction, the Tribunal must thus satisfy itself that, if the facts alleged by the Claimants ultimately prove true, those would be capable of constituting a breach of the Argentina-Italy BIT. The present Tribunal shares the view of the *Abaclat* Tribunal that \"[i]n performing this task, the Tribunal is to apply a *prima facie* standard, both to the determination of the meaning and scope of the relevant BIT provisions invoked as well as to the assessment of whether the facts alleged may constitute breaches of these provisions on their face\".277\n\n*Abaclat* Decision, para. 311.\n\n542.\n\nThe Claimants contend that - by virtue of the acts of the Respondent in relation to its default in December 2001 and its subsequent dealing with its creditors, notably regarding the 2005 Exchange Offer and by adoption of Law No. 26,017 and other legislative and regulatory acts adopted in this context - they have become subject to different types of violations of the Argentina-Italy BIT, notably in regard to (a) the Respondent\u2019s duty to accord the Claimants fair and equitable treatment according to Art. 2(2) of the BIT, (b) its obligation under Art. 5 of the BIT not to expropriate the Claimants\u2019 investments without payment of adequate, effective and immediate compensation, as well as (c) its duty to accord the Claimants full protection and security by virtue of the most-favoured nation treatment clause in Art. 3(1) of the BIT in connection with Art. 2(2)(a) of the Argentina-US BIT.\n\n543.\n\nAs concerns the Respondent\u2019s counter-argument that whatever acts it may have set, they did not amount to more than a non-payment of a contractual debt and an absolutely voluntary restructuring offer and would therefore give merely rise to a *contractual,* but not a treaty claim, the Tribunal considers that it was not so much the failure to pay, but the use of the Respondent\u2019s sovereign prerogatives when restructuring its debt, notably including the adoption of Law No. 26,017, which qualify the Respondent\u2019s acts as potential breaches of the Argentina-Italy BIT and thus as *treaty* claims.\n\n544.\n\nThis distinction is relevant since it is generally admitted, as also acknowledged in the *Abaclat* case, that in regard to a BIT claim\n\nan arbitral tribunal has no jurisdiction where the claim at stake is a pure contract claim [...] Within the context of claims arising from a contractual relationship, the tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction in relation to BIT claims is in principle only given where, in addition to the alleged breach of contract, the Host State further breaches obligations it undertook under a relevant treaty. [... ]\n\nA claim is to be considered a pure contract claim where the Host State, party to a specific contract, breaches obligations arising by the sole virtue of such contract. This is not the case where the equilibrium of the contract and the provisions contained therein are unilaterally altered by a sovereign act of the Host State. This is the case where the circumstances and/or the behavior of the Host State appear to derive from the exercise of its sovereign power. Whilst the exercise of such power may have an impact on the contract and its equilibrium, its origin and nature are totally foreign to the contract.\n\nThe Emergency Law278 had the effect of unilaterally modifying Argentina\u2019s payment obligations [...].\n\nIn the present case, the situation is somewhat peculiar, since the debtor is a sovereign State. Argentina, which considered itself insolvent, decided to promulgate a law, namely Law No. 26,017, entitling it not to perform part of the obligations which Argentina had undertaken prior to the enactment of such a law, and fixing in a sovereign manner the modalities and terms of such liberation. Such a behavior derives from Argentina\u2019s exercise of sovereign power. Thus, what Argentina did, it did based on its sovereign power; it is neither based on nor does it derive from any contractual argument or mechanism.\n\nIn other words, the present dispute does not derive from the mere fact that Argentina failed to perform its payment obligations under the bonds but from the fact that it intervened as a sovereign by virtue of its State power to modify its payment obligations towards its creditors in general, encompassing but not limited to the Claimants.\n\n[...] [Hence,] the dispute, and in particular Claimants\u2019 claims and Argentina\u2019s defense thereto, relate to the actions Argentina took in order to remedy its financial insolvency. Such actions were based on a sovereign decision of Argentina outside of a contractual framework. Thus, Argentina\u2019s actions were the expression of State power and not of rights or obligations Argentina had as a debtor under a specific contract.279\n\nThis refers Law No. 26,017; see *Abaclat* Decision, para. 78 and *infra* note 335.\n\n*Abaclat* Decision, paras. 316, 318, 321, 323-325.\n\n545.\n\nIn the light of this reasoning of its sister Tribunal with which the present Tribunal fully agrees, the attempts of Respondent to present its actions as operating purely on the contractual level and not amounting to the use of sovereign power are ultimately not convincing.\n\n546.\n\nIn particular, this holds true for the argument that even when a State acts through laws and decrees, this would not necessarily imply the exercise of governmental or sovereign authority, but could also constitute an act commercial in nature. In the light of what has been stated above, whatever types of legislative acts and different legal consequences engendered by them one might envisage, Law No. 26,017 and related legislative and regulatory acts did in fact unilaterally modify Respondent\u2019s payment obligation.\n\n547.\n\nRelated to that, it may well be true, as contended by the Respondent, that the bonds/security entitlements at stake in the present proceedings are governed by foreign law and enforceable in foreign jurisdictions. However, insofar as the Respondent seeks to conclude from the existence of such choice of law and forum selection clauses that those instruments were, by definition, beyond the scope of Argentina\u2019s legislative jurisdiction, the present Tribunal cannot follow this reasoning. While the Respondent could obviously not alter the terms of legal rights and obligations as arising from different laws and jurisdictions, it could nonetheless influence those bonds/security entitlements within the reach of the Respondent\u2019s (notably territorial) jurisdiction, for instance by legally forbidding the executive authorities to enter into any settlement of the claims in question or by ordering the domestic judicial authorities, should an \"old\" bond come before them, to replace *ipso jure* the old bonds by the newly issued bond instruments.280\n\nSee as to arts. 3 and 6 of Law No. 26,017 *infra* notes 285 and 286.\n\n548.\n\nIt is therefore not a far-fetched conclusion - in particular taking into account that at this stage of the proceedings the Tribunal has to apply a *prima facie* standard - that such course of action can plausibly be understood as having unilaterally altered the contractual equilibrium and having transcended the realm of purely non-sovereign action. In the light of this *prima facie* assessment, the Tribunal is therefore not in presence of a purely contractual claim, but of a treaty claim. The Respondent\u2019s acts in relation to its default in December 2001 and its subsequent actions, notably including the adoption of Law No. 26,017, may well have amounted, as alleged by the Claimants, to a violation of at least one of the provisions of the Argentina-Italy BIT on which the Claimants have relied in the present proceedings.\n\n549.\n\nAgainst this background, the present Tribunal fully endorses the pertinent findings of the *Abaclat* Tribunal:\n\nThe Tribunal considers that, *prima facie,* [the afore-mentioned] facts, if established, are susceptible of constituting a possible violation of at least some of the provisions of the BIT invoked by Claimants, particularly: [...] The arbitrary promulgation and implementation of regulations and laws can, under certain circumstances, amount to an unfair and inequitable treatment. It may even further constitute an act of expropriation where the new regulations and/or laws deprive an investor of the value of its investment or from the returns thereof.281\n\n*Abaclat* Decision, para. 314.\n\n**3. Conclusion**\n-----------------\n\n550.\n\nThe Tribunal thus concludes at this stage of the proceedings that the allegations of the Claimants and the facts on which these allegations are based are, if proven, susceptible of constituting a violation of BIT provisions invoked by the Claimants. Whether the Claimants\u2019 presentation of the facts is accurate will, if and inasmuch as necessary, be examined during the merits stage of the proceedings.\n\n551.\n\nThe Tribunal further concludes that, in the light of its *prima facie* assessment, the acts of the Respondent, as alleged by the Claimants, include the exercise of sovereign authority on the part of the Respondent and, thus falling within the scope of protection of the Argentina-Italy BIT, constitute treaty claims. As a consequence, for the purposes of this *prima facie* assessment, the claims at stake arise out of rights and obligations contained in the Argentina-Italy BIT so that the present dispute falls within the jurisdiction *ratione materiae* of the Centre and the competence of the present Tribunal.\n\n**VI. COMPLIANCE WITH ARTICLE 8 OF THE ARGENTINA-ITALY BIT -THE PREREQUISITES OF AMICABLE CONSULTATIONS AND RECOURSE TO ARGENTINE COURTS**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**A. Positions of the Parties**\n-------------------------------\n\n**1. Contentions by Respondent**\n--------------------------------\n\n552.\n\nRespondent argues that Art. 8 of the Argentina-Italy BIT provides for a multi-layered, sequential dispute resolution system *(R I \u00a7 269; R II \u00a7 429; R III \u00a7 88).* It gives rise to mandatory jurisdictional requirements; failure to respect them implies a bar to the jurisdiction of the Tribunal *(Tr p. 22/3).* As the prerequisites of Art. 8 of the BIT must be satisfied before Argentina can be considered to have consented to arbitration through the BIT and as Claimants have improperly skipped the first two steps (i.e. amicable consultations and recourse to the Argentine courts), it follows that Argentina has not consented and that the Centre has no jurisdiction *(RI \u00a7 273; RII \u00a7 431; R III \u00a7 84).*\n\n553.\n\nAs to the *amicable consultations* requirement of Art. 8(1), Respondent points out that Claimants have acknowledged their failure to make any attempt to resolve their purported claims against Argentina *(RI\u00a7 271).* Furthermore, Respondent submits that it conducted good-faith consultations with innumerable purchasers and creditor groups since its default in 2001 and that the 2005 Exchange Offer was a product of these substantial discussions and reflected the contributions of many creditor groups *(RI \u00a7\u00a7 278, 279; RII \u00a7\u00a7 459, 460; Tr p. 418/6).* Moreover, Law No. 26,017 did not make settlement with Argentina impossible or futile. It only required legislative consent to any settlement which is corroborated by the reopening of the Exchange Offer in 2010 *(R I \u00a7 280; RII \u00a7 462).* Argentina further contends that Claimants could have attempted to negotiate with Respondent before Law No. 26,017 was enacted *(R II \u00a7 461; Tr p. 34/15).*\n\n554.\n\nMoreover, Respondent considers the prerequisite to have *recourse to domestic courts* for 18 months to be mandatory. It is a precondition to avail oneself of international arbitration according to Art. 8(3) of the Argentina-Italy BIT *(R I \u00a7\u00a7 283, 286, 287).* Respondent points out in that regard that Claimants do not dispute their failure to submit their claims to the Argentine courts *(RI\u00a7 282).*\n\n555.\n\nIn addition, Respondent contests that the Claimants can rely on \"the so-called futility exception\" *(R I \u00a7 288).* Respondent submits in that regard that Claimants err when claiming futility because it would be impossible for Argentine courts to resolve the dispute within 18 months. For one, it is far from impossible for Argentine courts to decide a case similar to the present one in 18 months *(R I \u00a7\u00a7 289, 293).* More importantly, Art. 8(3) of the BIT does not require the dispute to be *resolved* within the timeframe stipulated therein, but only that the dispute is *submitted* to domestic courts *(R I \u00a7\u00a7 291, 294; RII \u00a7 466; R III \u00a7 94).*\n\n556.\n\nIn Respondent\u2019s opinion, there are at least two reasons to include a requirement to have recourse to domestic courts in the Argentina-Italy BIT : On the one hand, the Contracting Parties intended to give local courts an opportunity to decide a dispute before it could be submitted to international arbitration so that judicial authorities would be afforded the opportunity to review - and, if appropriate, to correct - government acts before setting in motion the intricacies and consequences associated with international investment arbitration. The provision gives the host State the opportunity to address the allegedly wrongful act within the framework of its domestic legal system, thus avoiding potential international responsibility therefor. On the other hand, the Contracting Parties could have the chance to resolve the dispute in their territories in a shorter period of time than international arbitration *(RI\u00a7\u00a7 292, 293; RII\u00a7\u00a7 467, 468).*\n\n557.\n\nAs regards Claimants\u2019 reference to Law No. 26,017, Argentina contends that the law in no way inhibits Claimants from submitting the dispute to local courts *(R I \u00a7 297).* Furthermore, Respondent deems Claimants\u2019 reference to the 2005 *Galli* Judgment of the Supreme Court of Argentina282 and its progeny unavailing since this was a purely domestic case. By virtue of Art. 75 para. 22 of the Argentine Constitution, international treaties such as the Argentina-Italy BIT rank above domestic legislation in the legal hierarchy.283 Accordingly, Claimants could have relied on the BIT before the Argentine courts in order to have Law No. 26,017 (assuming that it was not in compliance with the international obligations of Argentina, which is disputed by Respondent) set aside by the domestic courts as unconstitutional *(RI \u00a7 296; RII \u00a7 473; Tr pp. 36/21, 431/6, 433/15).*\n\nCorte Suprema de Justicia de la Naci\u00f3n, *Galli, Hugo G. y otro/Poder Ejecutivo Nacional si* amparo, Final decision, 5 April 2005 (Fallos: 328:690), Case No. G. 2181 XXXIX; see Annex CLA 37.\n\nConstitution of Argentina, as sanctioned by the Constituent General Congress on 1st May 1853, reformed by the National Convention \"ad hoc\" on 25 September of 1860 and with the Reforms of the Conventions of 1866, 1898, 1957 and 1994, Art. 75 para. 22: \"Corresponde al Congreso [...] Aprobar o desechar tratados concluidos con las dem\u00e1s naciones y con las organizaciones internacionales y los concordatos con la Santa Sede. Los tratados y concordatos tienen jerarqu\u00eda superior a las leyes.\"; Translation: \"Congress is empowered [...] To approve or reject treaties concluded with other nations and international organizations, and concordats with the Holy See. Treaties and concordats have a higher hierarchy than laws.\"\n\n558.\n\nIn regard to Claimants\u2019 submissions regarding futility due to the high costs of commencing proceedings in local courts, Argentina contends that the mere fact that such recourse might be burdensome or would cause the investor to incur costs does not defeat the requirement for Claimants to meet the conditions of Art. 8 of the BIT. High costs do not render the local recourse option futile, just expensive *(R II \u00a7\u00a7 470, 471).* Furthermore, Respondent submits that remedies before Argentine courts are inexpensive *(Tr p. 434/9).* Should any investor consider that the costs incurred by him to satisfy the BIT requirements are unreasonable, he may attempt to recover such costs by resorting to the international arbitral tribunal *(RIII\u00a7 114).*\n\n559.\n\nConcerning the most-favoured nation clause (hereinafter \"MFN clause\") argument made by the Claimants, Respondent contends, first, that the MFN clause does not apply to dispute resolution mechanisms *(R I \u00a7 272; R II \u00a7 477).* Secondly, the MFN clause only applies to investments in the territory of Argentina *(R II \u00a7 491).* Thirdly, even if the clause applied to dispute resolution provisions, Claimants have not shown that the dispute settlement provisions contained in the Argentina-US BIT284, notably its Art. VII para. 3, are more favourable than those of the Argentina-Italy BIT. In particular, it does not amount to less favourable treatment for Claimants to be first required to resolve the dispute in domestic courts *(RII\u00a7\u00a7 494, 495).*\n\nTreaty between the USA and the Argentine Republic Concerning the Reciprocal Encouragement and Protection of Investment of 14 November 1991; see Annex CA 39 (hereinafter \"Argentina-US BIT\").\n\n**2. Contentions by Claimants**\n-------------------------------\n\n560.\n\nClaimants accept that there exists an obligation for the Parties, under Art. 8 of the Argentina-Italy BIT, to resort to amicable consultations and to have recourse to domestic courts prior to taking a dispute to international arbitration *(Tr p. 226/10).* However, in their opinion, this provision does not lay down mandatory jurisdictional requirements but merely provides for procedural prerequisites which do not need to be strictly followed. Thus, non-compliance is not a bar to ICSID jurisdiction *(C I \u00a7 382; C II \u00a7 164).* According to the Claimants, these procedural prerequisites constitute reasonable prior steps to avoid an international arbitration which could prove useless if other simpler or less costly solutions to the dispute could be found. In contrast, recourse to international arbitration should not be unduly jeopardized or procrastinated where there are no realistic prospects that the other means for the settlement of the dispute will prove workable or successful *(CI \u00a7 379).* The Claimants submit that, in the case at hand, any effort to resort to the mechanisms indicated in arts. 8(1) and (2) of the BIT would have proved futile since there was no realistic prospect for the Parties to reach an agreement on the present dispute or to obtain justice at the hands of the courts of Argentina *(CI \u00a7 388).*\n\n561.\n\nAs regards more specifically the prerequisite of *amicable consultations* pursuant to Art. 8(1) of the BIT, the Claimants submit that the Respondent has always displayed a hostile and uncooperative attitude towards them *(Request \u00a7 87).* They refute the argument that the 2005 Exchange Offer showed Argentina\u2019s willingness to consult the bondholders since the terms of the offer were elaborated unilaterally by Argentina and then imposed on bondholders who were not involved in the negotiations *(CI\u00a7\u00a7 391 et seq.; CII\u00a7 170; Trp. 227/21).*\n\n562.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, the possibility of reaching an amicable settlement was finally precluded by Art. 3 of Law No. 26,017 which forbids Respondent from entering into any judicial, out-of-court or private settlement with bondholders who did not participate in the 2005 Exchange Offer *(Request \u00a787; CI\u00a7\u00a7 393 et seq.; CII \u00a7 178; Tr p. 229/18; C III \u00a7 174).* The Claimants consider the absence of consultations before the enactment of Law No. 26,017 to be irrelevant since consultations were only required before the request for international arbitration was submitted, so that Claimants were certainly not under an obligation to consult before 2005 *(Tr pp. 229/7, 464/21; C III \u00a7 173).* Given the fact that Art. 8 para. 1 of the Argentina-Italy BIT merely requires amicable consultations to be pursued \"insofar as possible\", Claimants cannot be blamed for not having had recourse to consultations since these were impossible *(CI \u00a7 387; CII \u00a7180).*\n\n563.\n\nConcerning the prerequisite to have *recourse to the domestic courts* of the host State for a period of 18 months prior to resorting to international arbitration according to Art. 8(2) of the BIT, Claimants have contended that this is not a mandatory requirement, but merely an option for the investor *(C I \u00a7 398).* To this effect, they rely on the language of the provision according to which disputes \"may\" be submitted to the courts. Claimants contrast this wording with that of Art. 10 of the Argentina-Germany BIT (\"shall\") which was pertinent in the *Wintershall* case and seek to distinguish that case on this basis (C *I \u00a7\u00a7 385, 387).*\n\n564.\n\nFurthermore, even if recourse to domestic courts were considered mandatory, Claimants submit that any legal action before Argentine courts on their part would have been entirely futile, and this for several reasons: First, it is clearly impossible for the local courts to decide a case of such magnitude in only 18 months *(Request \u00a7 89; CI \u00a7 419; C II \u00a7\u00a7 208, 211; Tr p. 234/10).*\n\n565.\n\nSecondly, Law No. 26,017, notably its arts. 3285 and 6286, is considered by Claimants to have been absolutely categorical in shutting the door to any possibility to obtain redress before Argentine courts *(Request \u00a7 88; CI \u00a7 411; CII \u00a7 201).* This is corroborated by the legal stance taken by the Supreme Court of Argentina in the afore-mentioned judgment in the *Galli* case287 which demonstrated that any bondholder attempting to obtain payment by resorting to the courts of Argentina will face a rejection of its claims so that any such attempt would have proven a totally useless and frustrating exercise (C *415, 418; C II \u00a7 203; Trp. 231/7).* Furthermore, Claimants refute Respondent\u2019s argument that *Galli* only related to domestic cases and that the Claimants could have relied before the Argentine courts on the supremacy of the Argentina-Italy BIT over Law No. 26,017 according to Art. 75 para. 22 of the Constitution of Argentina (C *II \u00a7 204; Tr p. 233/16; C III \u00a7 179).* In *Galli,* the Supreme Court declared the restructuring legislation to be a non-justiciable political question and recognized in this and subsequent decisions the constitutionality of Law No. 26,017 (C *II \u00a7 205; C III \u00a7 180).* Moreover, the position taken by the Argentine Government in the present proceedings squarely contradicts the one which the same Government vigorously defended in domestic litigation *(CI \u00a7\u00a7 416-418; CII\u00a7 206; Tr p. 234/3).*\n\nLaw No. 26,017, Art. 3: \"Proh\u00edbese al Estado nacional efectuar cualquier tipo de transacci\u00f3n judicial, extrajudicial o privada, respecto de los bonos a que refiere el articulo 1\u00b0 de la presente ley.\" (as to the Spanish original see Annex RA 72). See also the translation provided by the Respondent: \"The national Government is precluded from entering into in *[sic]* any type of judicial, extra-judicial or private settlement with respect to the bonds to which Article 1 of the present law refers.\" (Annex RA 72). The translations as provided by the Claimants read: \"It is prohibited to the National Government to make any kind of *[CII:* The national Government is precluded from entering into in *(sic)* any type of] judicial, out-of-court or private settlement, in respect of the bonds referred to in article 1 of this Act [i.e. the bonds that were not tendered for exchange in the 2005 Exchange Offer].\" *(CI \u00a7 393, n. 326; CII \u00a7 174 n. 76).*\n\nLaw No. 26,017, Art. 6: \"Sin peijuicio de lo establecido precedentemente, los bonos del Estado nacional elegibles de acuerdo a lo dispuesto por el Decreto N\u00b0 1735/04, depositados por cualquier causa o t\u00edtulo a la orden de tribunales de cualquier instancia, competencia y jurisdicci\u00f3n [...] quedar\u00e1n reemplazados, de pleno derecho, por los \u2018BONOS DE LA REPUBLICA ARGENTINA A LA PAR EN PESOS STEP UP 2038\u2019, en las condiciones establecidas para la asignaci\u00f3n, liquidaci\u00f3n y emisi\u00f3n de tales bonos por el Decreto N\u00b0 1735/04 y sus normas complementarias.\" The English translation provided by the Respondent reads: \"Notwithstanding the above established, the bonds of the national Government eligible under the terms of Decree No. 1735/04, deposited pursuant to any cause or title on the order of any court of any venue, competence, and jurisdiction [...] shall be replaced, by operation of law, with the 'BONDS OF THE ARGENTINE REPUBLIC AT PAR IN PESOS STEP UP 2038,\u2019 according to the terms established for the assignment, liquidation and issue of such bonds by Decree No. 1735/04 and its complementary norms.\" (see Annex RA 72). As to the Claimants' translation see *CII \u00a7 174, n. 76:* \"Notwithstanding the above provisions, the bonds of the national Government eligible under the terms of Decree No. 1735/04, deposited pursuant to any cause or title to the order of any court or any instance, competence, and jurisdiction [...] shall be replaced, by operation of law, with the \u2018BONDS OF THE ARGENTINE REPUBLIC AT PAR IN PESOS STEP UP 2038\u2019, according to the terms established by Decree No. 1735/04 and its complementary norms for the assignment, liquidation and issue of such bonds.\"\n\nSee *supra* note 282.\n\n566.\n\nThirdly, Claimants contend that to bring proceedings before the Argentine courts they would have to pay a judicial tax *(tasa de justicia)* in an amount of 3 % of the amount claimed. In addition, since they are not domiciled and do not possess real estate in Argentina, they would also have to submit a guarantee *(garant\u00eda de arraigo)* which can be very costly. Moreover, if the Claimants abandoned the proceedings after the elapse of the 18 months, they would be required to pay the costs of the proceedings and would not be entitled to recover their own costs *(CI \u00a7 422; Tr p. 235/6; C III \u00a7 182).*\n\n567.\n\nIn any event, the Claimants contend that they are not required to have recourse to domestic courts on account of the MFN clause contained in Art. 3 of the Argentina-Italy BIT. In the eyes of the Claimants, this clause applies to all matters covered by the BIT (C *I \u00a7 406).* According to the Claimants, both the wording of the provision and ICSID case law admit that MFN clauses extend to dispute resolution mechanisms (C *I \u00a7\u00a7 404, 406).* Hence, Art. 3 of the Argentina-Italy BIT allows Claimants to rely on Art. VII para. 3 of the Argentina-US BIT and thus to refer the dispute to ICSID arbitration with no need to satisfy the 18-month period before the domestic courts *(CI \u00a7 400; CII \u00a7 189).*\n\n**B. Findings of the Tribunal**\n-------------------------------\n\n568.\n\nAccording to Art. 8(1)-(3) of the Argentina-Italy BIT,\n\n(1) Any dispute relating to investments that arises between an investor from one of the Contracting Parties and the other Party, with respect to matters regulated by this Agreement, shall be, insofar as possible, resolved through amicable consultations between the parties to the dispute.\n\n(2) If such consultations do not provide a solution, the dispute may be submitted to a competent administrative or judicial jurisdiction of the Contracting Party in whose territory the investment is located.\n\n(3) If a dispute still exists between investors and a Contracting Party, after a period of 18 months has elapsed since notification of the commencement of the proceeding before the national jurisdictions indicated in paragraph 2, the dispute may be submitted to international arbitration.\n\n569.\n\nRespondent has contended, and Claimants have agreed *(Tr p. 226/10),* that these provisions give rise to obligations for a party who wants to avail itself of the dispute resolution mechanism offered by the Argentina-Italy BIT. The Parties disagree, however, on the precise legal nature of these obligations (1.) as well as on the scope of the prerequisites of amicable consultations (2.) and of recourse to the domestic courts (3.).\n\n**1. Nature of the obligations enshrined in Art. 8(1)-(3) of the Argentina-Italy BIT**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n570.\n\nRespondent has insisted throughout the proceedings that Art. 8(1)-(3) of the Argentina-Italy BIT create a \"multi-layered, sequential dispute resolution system\" constituting \"mandatory jurisdictional requirements\". In contrast, in Claimants\u2019 view, these only give rise to \"procedural prerequisites\". Both Parties have drawn the Tribunal\u2019s attention to numerous authorities and cases in which legal issues which they deemed comparable to those in the present dispute were at stake. In particular, the International Court of Justice, relying on its case-law on the matter, recently qualified negotiation requirements stemming from Art. 29 of the *Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination against Women* as affecting its jurisdiction.288 In contrast, the Tribunal in the *Abaclat* case - which had the same BIT before it as the present Tribunal - concluded that Art. 8(1)-(3) of the Argentina-Italy BIT were requirements of admissibility rather than jurisdiction.289\n\nSee *Armed Activities on the Territory of the Congo (New Application: 2002) (Democratic Republic of the Congo* v. *Rwanda), Jurisdiction and Admissibility, Judgment,* ICJ Reports 2006, 6, para. 88; as to Art. 75 of the WHO Constitution, Art. XIV para. 2 of the Unesco Constitution, and Art. 14 para. 1 of the Montreal Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts against the Safety of Civilian Aviation see, in a similar vein, *ibid.,* paras. 99 *et seq.,* 107 *et seq.* as well as 117 *et seq.* Furthermore, *va.* *Application of the International Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Racial Discrimination (Georgia* v. *Russia), Preliminary Objections, Judgment, 1 April 2011,* para. 141, the negotiation requirement in Art. 22 of the Convention was considered a precondition to be fulfilled before the seisin of the Court, i.e. a precondition to the exercise of the Court\u2019s jurisdiction *(ibid.,* para. 183). See, however, the *jurisprudence constante* of the International Court of Justice which treats the requirement of exhaustion of local remedies (in the context of diplomatic protection) as an admissibility issue; see e.g. *Interhandel Case (Switzerland* v. *USA), Preliminary Objections Judgment,* ICJ Reports 1959, 6, 23 *et seq**.:* see also *I. Brownlie,* Principles of Public International Law, 7th ed., 2008, 492 *et seq.*\n\n*Abaclat* Decision, para. 496.\n\n571.\n\nFurther examples could be added at will. The major conclusion to be drawn for them, however, is that there has not been a consistent approach on these matters by investment treaty tribunals290, let alone in international law more generally. This does not come as a surprise since each international arbitral tribunal or judicial body must craft its decision on the basis of the applicable substantial provisions of international law and within the specific institutional and procedural framework in which it is embedded. This limits the extent to which a tribunal such as the present one can rely on distinctions made by other tribunals which may perfectly make sense from their respective viewpoint.\n\nSee *Williams,* Jurisdiction and Admissibility (note 202) 919.\n\n572.\n\nThe present Tribunal is called to interpret and apply the Argentina-Italy BIT which does not differentiate between \"mandatory\" and \"non-mandatory\" requirements as well as \"jurisdictional\", \"admissibility\" or \"procedural\" prerequisites. Nor is such distinction contained in the ICSID Convention or the Arbitration Rules. Hence, as far as the applicable law is concerned, there is no *a priori* reason for the Tribunal to enter into the doctrinal intricacies of these distinctions and the related academie and judicial discourse.\n\n573.\n\nThat being said, the mandate given to the Tribunal by the Parties states that there should first be \"a preliminary phase in the proceedings covering *jurisdiction and admissibility\"291* For this reason, these concepts are relevant to the Tribunal and this becomes manifest in the very title of its present Decision, i.e. \"Decision on Jurisdiction and Admissibility\". At the same time, this does not force the Tribunal to draw a neat dividing line between these two concepts and to endorse one of the many controversial views articulated as to where the exact difference lies between them. The Tribunal would like to note in this context that the terminology applied by the Parties themselves does not seem to be free from ambiguities.292\n\nSee Minutes of the First Session, point 14 (emphasis added); *supra* para. 5.\n\nFor instance, while some of Respondent\u2019s submissions qualify violations of obligations under Art. 8 of the Argentina-Italy BIT as obstacles to the admissibility of the claims at stake *(R I \u00a7 282),* other passages suggest the opposite, i.e. that such violations would give rise to jurisdictional obstacles *273, 287, 298).*\n\n574.\n\nThe Tribunal would consider that the mission with which it has been entrusted by the Parties does not call it, in the first place, to give an answer as to whether the legal issues at stake are to be classified as questions of jurisdiction or admissibility. The Tribunal\u2019s mandate - and it is to this mandate that the title of the present Decision refers - rather requires it to take note of and thoroughly examine all legal claims made by the Parties under the labels of both jurisdiction and admissibility and to decide whether these are justified in law or not.\n\n575.\n\nWhat is thus crucial, in the Tribunal\u2019s opinion, is that all claims of lack of jurisdiction and admissibility filed by Respondent in its Memorial and elaborated upon in its further written and oral submissions will have to be perused and, if considered as not justified, rejected before the dispute could proceed to the merits phase. In no way would the distinction between jurisdictional and admissibility issues suggest a different degree of \"bindingness\". Hence, irrespective of whether others may identify a different degree of \"bindingness\" with regard to the two notions, in this Tribunal\u2019s view and at least with regard to the requirements set forth by Art. 8(1)-(3) of the Argentina-Italy BIT, if any of these requirements in their interpretation by the Tribunal and applied to the facts of the case, has not been met by Claimants, the Tribunal would have to dismiss the case irrespective of whether the requirement would qualify as one of jurisdiction or admissibility.\n\n576.\n\nIn order to answer these questions, the Tribunal will now turn to the submissions of the Parties as to whether the Claimants have complied with the requirements of prior amicable consultations and recourse to the domestic courts of Argentina, respectively.\n\n**2. The prerequisite of amicable consultations**\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n577.\n\nArt. 8(1) of the Argentina-Italy BIT states the requirement that any dispute relating to investments falling into its scope of application \"shall be, insofar as possible, resolved through amicable consultations\". In the Tribunal\u2019s opinion, the language of the provision clearly suggests that it creates a duty for the Parties to enter into consultations. This becomes manifest in the authentic versions of Art. 8(1) of the BIT where the use of \"ser\u00e1 [...] solucionada\" in Spanish and \"sar\u00e0 [...] risolta\" in Italian indicates the existence of a legal obligation.293 This result is corroborated by the conditional clause in para. 2 which authorizes the Parties to proceed to subsequent dispute resolution mechanisms (only) \"if such consultations do not provide a solution\".\n\nSee the analogous situation in *Wintershall AG v. Argentine Republic,* ICSID Case No. ARB/04/14, Award, 8 December 2008 where Art. 10 para. 2 of the Argentina-Germany BIT similarly provided for that a \"dispute [...] shall [...] be submitted\" (\"la controversia [...] ser\u00e1 sometida\" in Spanish and \"Meinungsverschiedenheit [...] ist [...] zu unterbreiten\" in German) and where the deciding arbitral tribunal correctly identified this wording as being \"indicative of an \u2018obligation\u2019 - not simply a choice or option\" and \"legally binding\" *(ibid.,* para. 119).\n\n578.\n\nThe present Tribunal is aware that the Tribunal in the *Abaclat* case came to a different result in view of the very same provision of the Argentina-Italy BIT. It notably concluded that \"the consultation requirement set forth in Article 8(1) BIT is not to be considered of a mandatory nature but as the expression of the good will of the Parties to try firstly to settle any dispute in an amicable way.\"294 The Tribunal justified this conclusion chiefly by relying on the use of the phrase \"insofar as possible\" (in Spanish: \"en la medida de lo posible\"; in Italian: \"per quanto possibile\") in Art. 8 para. 1 of the Argentina-Italy BIT.\n\n*Abacial.* Decision, para. 564.\n\n579.\n\nIn contrast, the present Tribunal would rather follow the reasoning in the Dissenting Opinion of Professor Abi-Saab who has rightly pointed out that the addition of this phrase does not eliminate the binding character of the provision, but characterizes it as a certain type of binding provision, namely an \"obligation of means\" or of \"best efforts\".295 As also the International Court of Justice has emphasized on several occasions, provisions directing the parties to consult or negotiate may well constitute legally binding obligations, non-compliance with them having legal effects, including the dismissal of the case. Whether and to which extent they set forth binding obligations, is a matter of interpretation of the relevant provisions.296\n\nDissenting Opinion of Professor Abi-Saab in the *Abaclat* case, para. 26.\n\nSee, e.g., *Railway Traffic between Lithuania and Poland, Advisory Opinion, 15 October 1931,* PCIJ Series A/B, No. 42, 116; *North Sea Continental Shelf (Germany/Denmark; Germany/Netherlands), Judgment,* ICJ Reports 1969, 3, para. 85; *Pulp Mills on the River Uruguay (Argentina* v. *Uruguay), Judgment,* ICJ Reports 2010, 14, paras. 149, 150; see also *supra* note 288.\n\n580.\n\nA party defying a duty to engage, as far as possible, in amicable consultations would therefore have to be prepared to see its claim denied to be admitted to the merits phase. However, before reaching such conclusion, the Tribunal must clarify the exact nature of the \"duty to consult insofar as possible\". Two remarks are in place in this regard:\n\n581.\n\nFirst, from its very character as an obligation of means and not of result follows that \"an obligation to negotiate does not imply an obligation to reach an agreement.\"297 Some tribunals go even so far as to qualify consultation or negotiation clauses as mere procedural requirements whose violation would have no effect on jurisdiction or the admissibility of the claim.298 Yet, this is not the view taken by this Tribunal. At the same time, one must take note of the fact that in the few cases where investment tribunals struck out cases for a violation of a consultation or negotiation requirement, this was mostly for the reason that the respective clauses contained minimum periods of time for consultations which were not respected by the claimants.299 This is not the case here, however, where we have a *simple* consultation clause which does not reserve any minimum requirement of time for consultations.\n\n*Railway Traffic between Lithuania and Poland, Advisory Opinion, 15 October 1931,* PCIJ Series A/B, No. 42, 116.\n\nSee, e.g., UNCITRAL (NAFTA), *Ethyl Corp. v. Canada,* Award on Jurisdiction, 24 June 1998, para. 85; *Salini Costruttori S.p.A, and Italstrate S.p.A. v. Morocco,* ICSID Case No. ARB/00/4, Decision on Jurisdiction, 23 July 2001, paras. 74-88 and 187; UNCITRAL, *Ronald S. Lauder v. Czech Republic,* Final Award, 3 September 2001, para. 187; *SGS Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale de Surveillance S.A. v. Pakistan,* ICSID Case No. ARB/01/13, Decision on Jurisdiction, 6 August 2003, para. 184; *Bayindir Insaat Turizm Ticaret Ve Sanayi* A.S. *v. Pakistan,* ICSID Case No. ARB/03/29, Decision on Jurisdiction, 14 November 2005, para. 100; see, however, the approach in *Antoine Goetz and others v. Burundi,* ICSID Case No. ARB/95/3, Award, 10 February 1999, paras. 90-93; *Enron Corporation and Ponderosa Assets, L.P. v. Argentina,* ICSID Case No. ARB/01/3, Decision on Jurisdiction, 14 January 2004; see furthermore *Schreuer,* Consent to Arbitration (note 100) 844 *et seq.*\n\n*Burlington Resources, Inc. v. Ecuador,* ICSID Case No. ARB/08/5, Decision on Jurisdiction, 2 June 2010, para. 315; *Murphy Exploration and Production Company International v. Ecuador,* ICSID Case No. ARB/08/4, Award, 15 December 2010, paras. 90 *et seq.,* in particular paras. 131 and 132.\n\n582.\n\nSecondly, the qualifying phrase \"insofar as possible\" which is commonly found in international investment treaties,300 indicates that if the Claimants can show that consultations were *not possible,* they cannot be held to have breached the duty incumbent upon them. This does not mean reading a futility exception into Art. 8(1) of the Argentina-Italy BIT, but it is a direct and independent consequence of the very wording of the provision in question. Furthermore, there is considerable authority for the proposition that mandatory waiting periods for consultations (let alone a *simple* duty to consult, as in the present case) do not pose an obstacle for a claim to proceed to the merits phase if there is no realistic chance for meaningful consultations because they have become futile or deadlocked.301 In this regard and particularly taking note of the fact that Art. 8(1) of the Argentina-Italy BIT envisages consultations with a view of \"resolving\" the dispute at stake, the Tribunal would endorse the *Abaclat* Tribunal\u2019s conclusion that consultation \"is to be reasonably understood as referring not only to the technical possibility of settlement talks, but also to the possibility, i.e. the likelihood, of a positive result\" and that \"it would be futile to force the Parties to enter into a consultation exercise which is deemed to fail from the outset. Willingness to settle is the *sine qua non* condition for the success of any amicable settlement talk.\"302\n\nSee, e.g., Art. 26 para. 1 of the Energy Charter Treaty; Art. XIII para. 1 of the Agreement between the Government of Canada and the Government of Barbados for the Reciprocal Promotion and Protection of Investments; Art. X para. 1 of the Agreement between the Government of the Kingdom of Norway and the Government of the Republic of Hungary on the Promotion and Reciprocal Protection of Investments; Art. 8 para. 1 of the Agreement between the Republic of Austria and Romania on the Promotion and Reciprocal Protection of Investments.\n\nAs to the pertinent case-law of the International Court of Justice see the references in *Application of the International Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Racial Discrimination (Georgia* v. *Russia), Preliminary Objections, Judgment, 1 April 2011,* para. 159.

Tanzania,* ICSID Case No. ARB/05/22, Award, 24 July 2008, para. 343: \"settlement obviously impossible\" and \"negotiations obviously futile\"; UNCITRAL, *Ronald S. Lauder v. Czech Republic,* Final Award, 3 September 2001, paras. 188-191; *SGS Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale de Surveillance S.A. v.

See also *Schreuer,* Consent to Arbitration (note 100) 846 stating in relation to mandatory waiting periods: \"What matters is whether or not there was a promising opportunity for a settlement. There would be little point in declining jurisdiction and sending the parties back to the negotiation table if these negotiations are obviously futile.\"\n\n*Abaclat* Decision, para. 564.\n\n583.\n\nHence, while a *consultation as far as possible* requirement of the type enshrined in Art. 8(1) of the Argentina-Italy BIT creates a legal obligation, this obligation is not violated if it is established that (a) the sufficient minimum amount of consultations was actually conducted, or at least offered, or that (b) amicable consultations in order to resolve the case at stake were not possible in the first place.\n\n584.\n\nApplying these considerations to the facts of the present case, no consultations between the Parties have taken place. To be sure, Claimants submit that after 2001 \"there were several attempts by groups of holders of Argentine bonds to enter into negotiations with Argentina for a reasonable proposal\" (C *II\u00a7 167).* However, Respondent contends *(RI\u00a7 271; R IV \u00a7 16),* and Claimants concede, that they \"did not personally attempt consultations with Argentina before the commencement of these proceedings\" (C *IV \u00a7 19).* In this respect, the Tribunal concludes that Claimants could not establish that a minimum amount of consultations between them and the Respondent were conducted.\n\n585.\n\nThe Tribunals thus turns to the second alternative, i.e. that meaningful consultations with a view of resolving the dispute at stake were not possible. In 2005, during the time the Exchange Offer was open for acceptance by Argentina\u2019s creditors, the Argentine Congress adopted Law No. 26,017 which forbade the country\u2019s government from entering into any judicial, non-judicial or private settlement with the non-participating bondholders as well as from reopening the Exchange Offer.303 In fact, this law prevented the Argentine Government from \"enter[ing] into negotiations with a view to arriving at an agreement, and not merely to go through a formal process of negotiation as a sort of prior condition\".304 The Government could have discharged its duty \"so to conduct [itself] that the negotiations are meaningful, which will not be the case when either of them insists upon its own position without contemplating any modification of it\"305 only at the cost of violating Law No. 26,017. Hence, at least since the adoption of this law it was clear that no realistic possibility of meaningful consultations to settle the dispute with the Argentine Government existed.\n\nAs to Art. 3 of Law No. 26,017 see *supra* note 285.\n\n*North Sea Continental Shelf Cases (Germany/Denmark; Germany/ Netherlands), Judgment,* ICJ Reports 1969, 48, para. 85.\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 85.\n\n586.\n\nThis result is not affected by the fact that the Argentine Congress could have at any time suspended or eliminated the ban on consultations and negotiations and that it actually did so in 2010 in order to open the way for the new Exchange Offer *(RI \u00a7 280; R II \u00a7 462).* What is crucial in this regard is that, first, the potential partner for negotiations, i.e. the Argentine Government, was not in a position to act accordingly while the law was in force, i.e. from 2005 onwards, and, second, that the very reason for the non-availability of a venue for meaningful consultations was above all Congress\u2019 adoption of Law No. 26,017.\n\n587.\n\nAs far as Respondent argues that Claimants were free to initiate consultations *before* the adoption of Law No. 26,017, the Tribunal would consider that there existed no duty for the Claimants to do so in order to comply with Art. 8(1) of the Argentina-Italy BIT. The provision is entirely silent regarding the time when consultations have to take place. The only temporal requirement to be drawn from the provision is that this must be done before the party in question has recourse to the domestic courts and proceeds to international arbitration. As the Request was filed on 23 June 2008, the Tribunal cannot therefore see why the Claimants would have fallen short of complying with Art. 8(1) of the BIT by not having had initiated consultations before 2005 (i.e. the year of adoption of Law No. 26,017).\n\n588.\n\nAccordingly, the Tribunal concludes that Claimants did not violate the requirement to engage in amicable consultations incumbent upon them by virtue of Art. 8(1) of the Argentina-Italy BIT.\n\n**3. The prerequisite of having recourse to domestic courts**\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n***a) Binding character of the requirement***\n---------------------------------------------\n\n589.\n\nAs regards the second element in the three-step dispute resolution system, i.e. the requirement to have recourse to domestic courts, the Tribunal is of the opinion that the clear wording of Art. 8 paras. 2 and 3 of the Argentina-Italy BIT permits of no other conclusion than that the provision sets forth a binding precondition for access to international arbitration.\n\n590.\n\nThis follows first from the unqualified \"if\u2019 at the beginning of para. 3 - \"if such consultations do not provide a solution\" (in Spanish: \"Si esas consultas no aportaran una soluci\u00f3n\"; in Italian: \"Se tali consultazioni non consentissero una soluzione\") - which makes the very right to start an arbitration dependent on prior submission of the dispute to the local courts of the Respondent and the lapse of a period of 18 months since the notification of the commencement of national proceedings.\n\n591.\n\nSecondly, this holds true in spite of the use of the word \"may\" (in Spanish: \"podr\u00e1\"; in Italian: \"potr\u00e0\") in Art. 8 para. 2 of the BIT. This paragraph speaks of the possibility to submit a dispute to the domestic courts of the host State in case of the continuing existence of a dispute subsequent to (or for lack of) consultations. If an investor does not want to abandon his claims at this point, he \"may\" proceed in the order envisaged by the BIT\u2019s dispute settlement system by approaching the host State\u2019s courts. Far from characterizing the recourse to domestic courts as a voluntary exercise on the way to international arbitration, para. 2 must be read in context with para. 3. There, the further possibility (in Spanish: \"podr\u00e1\"; in Italian: \"potr\u00e0\"; in English: \"may\") to submit the dispute to international arbitration is conditioned by the twofold obligation (a) to previously have recourse to the host State\u2019s courts and (b) to notify the commencement of these national proceedings. As a consequence, the *possibility* to proceed to international arbitration is at the disposal of the investor only when not having failed to satisfy the *obligation* of having recourse to domestic courts.\n\n592.\n\nThirdly, the reference to the *Wintershall* case where in Art. 10(2) of the pertinent Argentina-Germany BIT the wording \"shall [...] be submitted\" (\"ser\u00e1 sometida\" in Spanish; \"ist [...] zu unterbreiten\" in German) is used in relation to the recourse to domestic tribunals306, as opposed to the phrase \"may be submitted\" in Art. 8(2) of the Argentina-Italy BIT, is of no avail to the Claimants. As has been pointed out, the term \"may\" refers to the possibility for the investor to further proceed with the claim, but does not dispose of the need to make use of this possibility in the manner prescribed by the BIT, i.e. his obligation to have recourse to domestic courts before submitting an arbitration request. To suggest an *argumentum e contrario* here would be tantamount to ignoring the logic structure, and interdependence of the different steps, of Art. 8 paras. 1-3 of the Argentina-Italy BIT.\n\n*Wintershall AG v. Argentine Republic,* ICSID Case No. ARB/04/14, Award, 8 December 2008, paras. 119 *et seq.*\n\n593.\n\nThis Tribunal is not called upon to interpret similar provisions in other treaties. But at least in application to the specific rulings regarding Art. 8 of the BIT, the Tribunal is for the above reasons not convinced by the concerns and criticism raised vis-\u00e0-vis clauses \"providing] for a mandatory attempt at settling the dispute in the host State\u2019s domestic courts for a certain period of time\"307 inasmuch as this has prompted investment arbitral tribunals or distinguished scholars in the field to challenge the binding character of such clauses.308 The Tribunal cannot ignore the fact that such clauses are commonly found in investment treaties309 and that they are typically drafted in a manner that manifests their binding nature. These characteristics are clear indications that the Contracting Parties of the respective BIT intended to give such clauses some effect. Treaty provisions should not be construed in a way that takes away from them all useful effect *(ut res magis valeat quam pereat).* It is thus necessary for a tribunal called to interpret such a clause to duly acknowledge its binding character and to identify which purposes it may serve in the context of the applicable BIT. This also holds true in the present case.\n\n*Schreuer,* Consent to Arbitration (note 100) 847; see also *L. Markert,* Streitschlichtungsklauseln in Investitionsschutzabkommen (2010) 210 referring to such clauses as \"temporary limited local remedies clauses\" *(\"befristete local remedies-Klauseln\").*\n\n*Plama Consortium Limited v. Bulgaria,* ICSID Case No. ARB/03/24, Decision on Jurisdiction, 8 February 2005, para. 224 which speaks in respect of an analogous clause in the applicable BIT of a \"curious requirement\" and \"sympathizes with a tribunal that attempts to neutralize such a provision that is nonsensical from a practical point of view\".

[...] Claimants\u2019 disregard of the 18 months requirement is in itself not yet sufficient to preclude Claimants from resorting to arbitration.\"311 These statements were harshly criticized in Professor Abi-Saab\u2019s Dissenting Opinion, where they were qualified as \"very odd indeed\", since they ignored that\n\nno instrument, laying down jurisdictional limits or admissibility conditions, specifies the legal consequences of non observance of these limits or non fulfilment of these conditions. These consequences are embedded in the very legal classification of these as jurisdictional limits or admissibility conditions. According to the general rules of law and rules of general international law, non compliance begets the inevitable legal sanction of dismissing the case, as falling outside the jurisdiction of the tribunal or as inadmissible.312\n\n*Abaclat* Decision, paras. 579, 580.\n\nDissenting Opinion of Professor Abi-Saab in the *Abaclat* case, para. 28.\n\n596.\n\nThis Tribunal would be inclined to endorse the latter position. If a requirement set forth by Art. 8 of the Argentina-Italy BIT were not complied with, the venue to international arbitration would not be open. However, at this stage the Tribunal would consider it premature to come to such conclusion. Claimants argue that the prerequisite of having recourse to the domestic courts of Argentina has not been violated by, or does not apply to, Claimants, and this for two reasons: First, they argue that paras. 2 and 3 of Art. 8 of the BIT are inapplicable in the present case because recourse to Respondent\u2019s courts would have been futile. Secondly, the Claimants seek to take refuge to the MFN clause in Art. 3 para. 1 of the Argentina-Italy BIT in combination with Art. VII(3) of the Argentina-US BIT. The Tribunal will now examine the futility argument (c) and the MFN clause argument (d) in turn.\n\n***c) The futility exception***\n-------------------------------\n\n**(1) Existence of the futility exception**\n-------------------------------------------\n\n597.\n\nClaimants submit that there exists an exception to the duty to have recourse to Respondent\u2019s courts in case such recourse would be futile. Respondent implicitly accepts the existence of a futility exception, but argues that the relevant threshold is very high and that the facts of the case do not lend themselves to give rise to a situation of futility *(RI\u00a7\u00a7 290, 291).*\n\n598.\n\nEven though the Parties do therefore not disagree as to the *existence* of a futility exception with regard to prerequisite of having recourse to domestic courts, as laid down in Art. 8(2) and (3) of the Argentina-Italy BIT, the Tribunal must assure itself that this view of the Parties constitutes a sound interpretation of these provisions. The question of the applicable *threshold* can only be addressed once it is clear that the exception exists in the first place.313\n\nSee *infra* paras. 608 *et seq.*\n\n599.\n\nIt appears to be generally accepted in international law that obligations requiring an individual to approach a State\u2019s local courts before a claim may be taken to the international plane do not apply unconditionally. Under certain circumstances, the lack of a claim\u2019s prior submission to domestic courts does not lead to the dismissal of the claim, notably in the law of diplomatic protection. Indeed, for a State to bring a claim on behalf of one of its nationals under the title of diplomatic protection, the individual concerned must, as a matter of principle, exhaust the legal remedies available to him in the State where the alleged injury took place.314 However, only those remedies must be used which are available \"as a matter of reasonable possibility.\"315 This exception to the local remedies rule, the so-called *futility* rule, is now universally recognized in the law of diplomatic protection. It is set out in Art. 15(a) of the Draft Articles of the International Law Commission on Diplomatic Protection of 2006 (hereinafter \"2006 ILC Draft Articles on Diplomatic Protection\") in the following manner: \"Local remedies do not need to be exhausted where [...] [t]here are no reasonably available local remedies to provide effective redress, or the local remedies provide no reasonable possibility of such redress.\"316\n\nSee *Elettronica Sicula S.p.A. (ELSI) (USA* v. *Italy), Judgment,* ICJ Reports 1989, 15, para. 50; see further Art. 14 of the 2006 ILC Draft Articles on Diplomatic Protection; *Brownlie,* Principles of Public International Law (note 288) 492.\n\nSee *Certain Norwegian Loans (France* v. *Norway), Judgment,* ICJ Reports 1957, 9, Separate Opinion of Judge Lauterpacht, 34, at 39; *Barcelona Traction, Light and Power Company, Limited (Second Phase), Judgment,* ICJ Reports 1970, 3, Separate Opinions of Judge Tanaka, 114, at 144, 145 and of Judge Gros, 267, at 284; see *Brownlie,* Principles of Public International Law (note 288) 495 with further references.\n\nArt. 15 lit. a of the 2006 ILC Draft Articles on Diplomatic Protection.\n\n600.\n\nThat being said, Art. 8(3) of the Argentina-Italy BIT does not mention or refer to such exception. This is not the end of the matter, however. According to the general rules of treaty interpretation as codified in Art. 31 of the VCLT, it is required that when interpreting a treaty provision \"any relevant rules of international law applicable in the relations between the parties\" shall be \"taken into account, together with the context\" (Art. 31 para. 3 lit. c of the VCLT).317 The term \"relevant rules of international law\" also includes pertinent customary international law.318\n\nAs to the relevance of this provision in treaty interpretation see notably the *Oil Platforms Case (Iran* v. *USA), Judgment,* ICJ Reports 2003, 161, paras. 41 *et seq.* as well as *Certain Questions of Mutual Assistance in Criminal* *Matters (Djibouti* v. *France), Judgment,* ICJ Reports 2008, 177, paras. 112 *et seq.**;* in particular regarding investment law see *A. van Aaken,* Fragmentation of International Law: The Case of International Investment Law, 17 Finnish Yearbook of International Law (2008), 91, at 103 and 108; see *Markert,* Streitschlichtungsklauseln in Investitionsschutzabkommen (note 307) 167, 168 and 213 *et seq.* It is worth noting that also Professor Abi-Saab\u2019s Dissenting Opinion in the *Abaclat* case, para. 28 refers to the relevance of \"general rales of law and rales of general international law\".\n\n*Ioannis Kardassopoulos v. Georgia,* ICSID Case No. ARB/05/18, Decision on Jurisdiction, 6 July 2007, para. 208; *C. McLachlan,* The Principle of Systemic Integration and Article 31(3)(c) of the Vienna Convention, 54 International and Comparative Law Quarterly (2005) 279, at 310 *et seq.* with further references to the pertinent caselaw; International Law Commission, Report on Fragmentation of International Law (2006), 7; *A. van Aaken,* Defragmentation of Public International Law Through Interpretation: A Methodological Proposal, 16 Indiana Journal of Global Legal Studies (2009), 483, at 497, 498.\n\n601.\n\nThus, in order to determine whether the futility exception also applies in the context of a provision such as Art. 8 (3) of the Argentina-Italy BIT, it is necessary for the Tribunal to assess whether the customary law exception of futility regarding the rule of exhaustion of local remedies in diplomatic protection is sufficiently comparable to the requirement of recourse to the domestic courts of Art. 8 (3) of the Argentina-Italy BIT to identify the former as a rule of international law \"relevant\" to the latter.\n\n602.\n\nIn that regard, the Tribunal would consider that exhaustion of local remedies clauses and the prerequisite to have recourse to domestic courts for a certain amount of time are similar inasmuch as they both require to turn to the local judicial authorities before the claim can be successfully brought to the international plane. Both serve the purpose of honoring the host State\u2019s sovereignty by providing the latter the opportunity to settle a dispute in its own fora before moving on to the international level. In a similar vein, Respondent has submitted that clauses of the type of Art. 8 (3) of the Argentina-Italy BIT intend to give local courts an opportunity to decide a dispute before turning to international arbitration so that judicial authorities would be afforded the opportunity to review - and, if appropriate, to correct - government acts before setting in motion the intricacies and consequences associated with international investment arbitration. Indeed, the provision gives the host State the opportunity to address the allegedly wrongful act within the framework of its own domestic legal system, thus avoiding potential international responsibility therefor *(RI \u00a7 292; RII \u00a7 467).* Furthermore, the Contracting Parties could have the chance to resolve the dispute in their territories in a shorter period of time than international arbitration *(RI \u00a7 293; RII \u00a7 468).319*\n\nFor further reasons see UNCITRAL (PCA), *ICS Inspection and Control Services Limited v. Argentina,* PCA Case No. 2010-9, Award on Jurisdiction, 10 February 2012, para. 269, n. 298.\n\n603.\n\nAccordingly, in view of the strong structural parallels between these two types of clauses, the Tribunal does not consider it a far-fetched conclusion to assume that the futility exception to the exhaustion of local remedies rule in the field of diplomatic protection is, in the light of Art. 31(3)(c) of the VCLT, also applicable to clauses requiring recourse to domestic courts in international investment law. The conclusion that the futility of local remedies constitutes an exception to the duty of having recourse to local courts is also affirmed in the case-law and in legal academia.320\n\n*Biwater Gauff (Tanzania), Ltd. v. Tanzania,* ICSID Case No. ARB/05/22, Award, 24 July 2008, para. 343; *Saipem S.p.A. v. Bangladesh,* ICSID Case No. ARB/05/7, Decision on Jurisdiction and Recommendation on Provisional Measures, 21 March 2007, para. 153. See, however, for the opposite view (regarding the UK-Argentina BIT) UNCITRAL, *BG Group Pic. v. Argentina,* Final Award, 24 December 2007, para. 146 (but accepting a variation of the futility argument on the basis of Art. 32 of the VCLT; see *ibid.,* para. 147) as well as the subsequent decision of the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, *Argentina v. BG Group Pic., 665* F.3d 1353 (D.C. Circuit, 17 January 2012), 2 and 17; on which 106 AJIL (2012) 393 *et seq.* See further - again regarding the US-Argentina BIT - *ICS Inspection and Control Services Limited v. Argentina,* PCA Case No. 2010-9, Award on Jurisdiction, 10 February 2012, para. 263, citing the *Abaclat* Decision as the only decision brought to the Tribunal\u2019s attention where an element of futility had been used successfully to allow derogation from the prerequisite of recourse to domestic courts, and concluding that futility had not been demonstrated to the Tribunal's satisfaction (see *ibid.,* paras. 269 and 273); see, in a similar vein, (regarding the Germany-Argentina BIT) *Daimler Financial Services AG v. Argentina,* ICSID Case No. ARB/05/1, Award, 22 August 2012, para. 198, where the Tribunal appears to affirm, in principle, the existence of a futility exception, but concludes that futility was not demonstrated by the Claimant in the case in question (see *ibid.,* para. 191); see, however, the Dissenting Opinion of Judge Brower, para. 15. See in general *C. Schreuer,* Travelling the BIT Route. Of Waiting Periods, Umbrella Clauses and Forks in the Road, Journal of World Investment and Trade (2004), 231, at 238.\n\n604.\n\nYet, there is a major difference between these two types of clauses. While in the field of diplomatic protection the affected individual is generally required to \"exhaust\" local remedies, in the case of requirements of recourse to domestic courts the investor typically has to submit the dispute to the local courts for a certain amount of time. Given the realities of settlement of complex disputes and the multi-stage character of domestic judicial proceedings, of which the Contracting States of BITs are certainly well aware, it is hardly plausible (and insofar everyone seems to agree) to impute to such clauses the purpose of resolving an investment dispute by passing through the domestic legal system and obtaining a final judgment within that amount of time. The consequence of the recognition of the limited purpose of such clauses is not, however, to challenge the soundness and relevance of the latter at all321, but to direct the attention on these very purposes and enquire about the functions which such clauses may actually serve in the limited time foreseen, in the present case 18 months.322\n\nSee, however, *P. Juillard,* Chronique de droit international \u00e9conomique - Investissements, 41 Annuaire Fran\u00e7ais de Droit International (1995) 604, at 608; *A. Crivellaro,* Consolidation of Arbitral and Court Proceedings in Investment Disputes, 4 Law and Practice of International Courts and Tribunals (2005) 371, at 399.\n\nSee *supra* para. 593.\n\n605.\n\nSuch amount of time may indeed be sufficient for the commencement of formal court proceedings to prompt the Parties to the dispute to agree on a court or out-of-court settlement or for the national courts to render a first-instance judgment in the investor\u2019s favour which the host State does not appeal. Since the domestic judicial system may precisely serve such purposes where and inasmuch as there exist \"reasonably available local remedies to provide effective redress\", the futility exception appears to be the appropriate standard also in regard to recourse to domestic courts clauses.\n\n606.\n\nWhat is more, since the futility exception is even capable of disposing of a duty to exhaust local remedies - i.e. the use of (virtually) all means offered by the domestic dispute settlement system for a (virtually) unlimited amount of time -, this must hold true *a fortiori* for a duty to have recourse to local remedies for a limited amount of time. Accordingly, the only aspect where there exists a major difference between the two types of clauses, i.e. the time aspect, does not prevent the drawing of a parallel between them regarding the futility exception; it rather militates in favour of drawing this parallel.\n\n607.\n\nHence, the Tribunal concludes that an interpretation of BIT clauses such as Art. 8(3) of the Argentina-Italy BIT, in the light of Art. 3 l(3)(c) of the VCLT, results in admitting a futility exception also in respect to such clauses, on the model of the futility exception to the exhaustion of local remedies rule in the field of diplomatic protection.\n\n**(2) Threshold of the futility exception**\n-------------------------------------------\n\n608.\n\nGiven the widely analogous structure and purposes of clauses on the exhaustion of local remedies in the law of diplomatic protection and clauses providing for recourse to domestic courts such as Art. 8(3) of the Argentina-Italy BIT, the Tribunal considers it appropriate to also draw on the International Law Commission\u2019s work on diplomatie protection as regards the *threshold* for the futility exception. The standard was articulated in the afore-cited Art. 15(a) of the 2006 ILC Draft Articles on Diplomatic Protection in the following manner: \"Local remedies do not need to be exhausted where [...] [t]here are no reasonably available local remedies to provide effective redress, or the local remedies provide no reasonable possibility of such redress323\n\nSee *supra* para. 599.\n\n609.\n\nThis standard was carefully drafted and documented by the International Law Commission, as becomes manifest in the Commentary to the Draft Articles.\n\n(3) The \"obvious futility\" test, expounded by Arbitrator Bagge in the *Finnish Ships Arbitration,* sets too high a threshold. On the other hand, the test of \"no reasonable prospect of success\", accepted by the European Commission of Human Rights in several decisions, is too generous to the claimant. This leaves the third option which avoids the stringent language of \"obvious futility\" but nevertheless imposes a heavy burden on the claimant by requiring that he prove that in the circumstances of the case, and having regard to the legal system of the respondent State, there is no reasonable possibility of effective redress offered by the local remedies.\n\nThis test has its origin in a separate opinion of Sir Hersch Lauterpacht in the *Norwegian Loans* case and is supported by the writings of jurists. [...]\n\nIn this form the test is supported by judicial decisions which have held that local remedies need not be exhausted where the local court has no jurisdiction over the dispute in question; the national legislation justifying the acts of which the alien complains will not be reviewed by local courts; the local courts are notoriously lacking in independence; there is a consistent and well-established line of precedents adverse to the alien; the local courts do not have the competence to grant an appropriate and adequate remedy to the alien; or the respondent State does not have an adequate system of judicial protection.\n\n(4) In order to meet the requirements of paragraph (a) it is not sufficient for the injured person to show that the possibility of success is low or that further appeals are difficult or costly. The test is not whether a successful outcome is likely or possible but whether the municipal system of the respondent State is reasonably capable of providing effective relief. This must be determined in the context of the local law and the prevailing circumstances. This is a question to be decided by the competent international tribunal charged with the task of examining the question whether local remedies have been exhausted. The decision on this matter must be made on the assumption that the claim is meritorious.324\n\nILC Draft Articles on Diplomatic Protection, Commentary, Art. 15, nr. 3 (footnotes omitted).\n\n610.\n\nIn the light of the International Law Commission\u2019s well-reasoned and well-balanced restatement of the threshold applicable to the futility exception, the Tribunal does not consider it necessary to rely on alternative standards proposed by the Parties. In that regard, it will not follow Claimants\u2019 submission that recourse to international arbitration \"should not be unduly jeopardized or procrastinated where there are no realistic prospects that other means for the settlement of the dispute will prove workable or successful\" (C *I \u00a7 379).* Likewise, in view of what has been stated above, the Tribunal is not convinced that \"according to international arbitration panels, the test of futility is \u2018obvious futility\u2019 or \u2018manifest ineffectiveness\u2019 - in other words, more than alleged probability of failure is required\", as argued by the Respondent *(RI \u00a7\u00a7 290, 296, n. 402f; RII \u00a7\u00a7 465, 4 73)325*\n\nRespondent notably refers to the United States Restatement (Third) of Foreign Relations Law according to which the futility exception applies only when local remedies are \"clearly sham or inadequate, or their application is unreasonably prolonged\", \u00a7 713 cmt f (1986).\n\n611.\n\nFurthermore, the Tribunal would wish to point out that since the present case only regards a requirement to have temporary recourse to domestic courts, as opposed to a fully-fledged exhaustion of local remedies requirement, the threshold to be met for the futility exception to be realized in the present case cannot possibly be considered higher than in the context of diplomatic protection; on the contrary, it is arguably rather lower.\n\n**(3) Application of the futility exception to the present case**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n612.\n\nClaimants marshal three separate arguments in favour of the futility exception being fulfilled in the present case, with the Respondent opposing all of these. The Tribunal will now examine them in turn.\n\n613.\n\n(a) Claimants submit that any legal action on their part before Argentine courts would have been an entirely futile exercise since it is clearly impossible for the local courts to decide a case of such magnitude in only 18 months *(Request \u00a7 89; CI \u00a7 419; CII \u00a7\u00a7 208, 211; Tr p. 234/10).* However, as has been already pointed out above326, Respondent *(R I* *291, 294; RII \u00a7 466; R III \u00a7 94)* is right to submit that Art. 8(3) of the BIT may not be construed to require the dispute to be *resolved* by a final judgment in the domestic court system within 18 months, but only that the dispute is *submitted* to the domestic courts.\n\nSee *supra* para. 604.\n\n614.\n\nTo begin with, the provision solely calls for the dispute not to be submitted to international arbitration before \"a period of 18 months has elapsed since notification of the *commencement* of the proceeding before the national jurisdictions\" (emphasis added). Furthermore, the very existence of Art. 8(4) of the Argentina-Italy BIT327 confirms that the Parties to the BIT considered it not to be a rare case that domestic proceedings would still be pending when the arbitration is initiated. In addition, by expressly recognizing that a case with a certain complexity in the factual and legal realm could hardly be dealt with in a period of 18 months in any legal system (notably further taking into account the multi-level nature of national court systems) *(Trp. 468/12),* Claimants themselves suggest that construing the provision as setting forth a time standard for the final disposal of the dispute cannot be a sound interpretation of the provision in question. Otherwise, the 18 months period which was expressly agreed upon by the Parties would be rendered nugatory in most real-life investment disputes.\n\n\"From the moment an arbitral proceeding is commenced, each of the parties to the dispute will adopt all the necessary measures in order to desist from the ongoing judicial proceeding.\"\n\n615.\n\n(b) In Claimants\u2019 view, Law No. 26,017 was absolutely categorical in shutting the door to any possibility to obtain redress before Argentine courts *(Request \u00a7 88; CI \u00a7 411; CII \u00a7 201).* They consider this to notably hold true for Art. 6 of the Law328 since it prevented the domestic courts from fulfilling the very functions the *recourse to domestic courts* prerequisite was said to serve. Respondent counters that Claimants could have set aside Law No. 26,017 (assuming that it was not in compliance with the international obligations of Argentina) by arguing before the domestic courts that, by virtue of Art. 75 para. 22 of the Argentine Constitution, international treaties to which Argentina is a party rank higher in the hierarchy of the Argentine legal system than laws adopted by Congress *(RI\u00a7 296; RII \u00a7 473; Tr pp. 36/21; 431/6; 433/15).*\n\nSee *supra* note 286.\n\n616.\n\nClaimants contend, however, that such a course of action was not to be expected from the Argentine courts, since the legal stance taken by the Supreme Court of Argentina in its 2005 *Galli* Judgment329 demonstrated that any bondholder attempting to obtain payment by resorting to the domestic courts of Argentina would face a rejection of his claims, so that any such attempt would have constituted a totally useless and frustrating exercise (C *I \u00a7\u00a7 415, 418; C II \u00a7 203; Trp. 231/7).* Respondent counters this argument by emphasizing that *Galli* was a purely domestic case including exclusively domestic bondholders so that it cannot be taken as guidance for how the Argentine judicial system would have treated non-domestic bondholders, notably in view of Art. 75 para. 22 of the Constitution.\n\nSee *supra* para. 557.\n\n617.\n\nIn *Galli,* the Supreme Court remanded an appellate court decision which had ordered Respondent to pay certain amounts due to certain Argentine nationals under bonds which the latter had not tendered for exchange, and upheld the compatibility of the debt restructuring legislation with the Argentine Constitution. As regards the reasons for this decision, they are laid out in quite some detail in the Opinion of the Procurator-General of the Nation (pp. 1-29) which the seven Justices of the Supreme Court expressly endorsed (p. 30). Against this background, the *Galli* judgment can be said to be based on the following findings:\n\n- Both the Procurator-General and the Justices emphasize the powers of Congress, under arts. 75 paras. 7 and 8 of the Argentine Constitution, to settle the payment of the domestic and foreign debt of the Nation and to fix the general budget, and refer to the \"monetary sovereignty\" *(soberan\u00eda monetaria)* of Congress (p. 23; per Justices Zaffaroni and Lorenzetti, \u00a7 10, p. 55).\n\n- Against this background, the debt restructuring process is qualified as belonging to the political sphere and thus generally not being subject to judicial review, notwithstanding a rather generic test of \"reasonability\" *(car\u00e1cter razonable)* and non-discrimination of the measures in question, but which does not change the general picture of judicial deference vis-\u00e0-vis the political echelons (p. 26; per Justices Maqueda and Highton de Nolasco, \u00a7 12, p. 42; per Justices Zaffaroni and Lorenzetti, \u00a7 9, p. 54; per Justice Argibay, \u00a7 4, p. 64).\n\n- Furthermore, it is pointed out that participation in the Exchange Offer was an option for the bondholders and that those who did not participate acted voluntarily and thus exposed themselves to the consequences of their behaviour (per Justices Maqueda and Highton de Nolasco, \u00a7\u00a7 18, 19, pp. 46, 47). The investors were aware that the laws adopted by Congress forbade the executive power to reopen the exchange process as well as the possibility of entering into any kind of judicial, out-of-court or private transaction with regard to the bonds that were not exchanged (per Justice Argibay, \u00a7 7, pp. 65, 66).\n\n- The Procurator-General and the Justices of the Supreme Court strongly draw upon the Supreme Court\u2019s *Brunicardi* case330 which dealt with the foreign sovereign debt of Argentina and measures taken in this regard by the Argentine Government in 1983. Accordingly, if a Government decided to suspend the payment of debt for reasons of financial necessity or public interest, this was generally accepted by the international community (p. 20). According to the Supreme Court in *Brunicardi,* there exists a principle of international law that precludes a State\u2019s international responsibility in case of suspension or modification, in whole or in part, of the payment of the external debt, in the event the State is forced to do so due to reasons of financial necessity (p. 22; per Justices Maqueda and Highton de Nolasco, \u00a7 10, p. 39; per Justices Zaffaroni and Lorenzetti, \u00a7\u00a7 13, 14, pp. 59, 60).\n\nFallos 319:2886.\n\n618.\n\nThe Tribunal would consider that these arguments apply, in principle, with equal force to non-domestic bondholders. In particular given the Supreme Court\u2019s stance on international law, it is very doubtful whether a reference to Art. 75 para. 22 of the Argentine Constitution and to Argentina\u2019s international obligations under the BIT would have changed the picture. It may well be that the Constitution endows international treaties which a higher normative rank than laws, but a BIT would still be inferior to the provisions of the Constitution itself. The Supreme Court in *Galli* emphasizes the powers of Congress to settle domestic and foreign debt, notably in emergency situations, and accepts the debt restructuring process as emanating from this constitutional power. The fact that the Supreme Court qualifies the restructuring legislation to be generally non-justiciable by the courts and confirms its reasonable character suggests that the Supreme Court was not prepared to interfere with the exercise of powers by Congress which, in the Supreme Court\u2019s view, were reserved to Congress by the Constitution itself.\n\n619.\n\nFurthermore, *Galli* was followed by two later decisions of the Argentine Supreme Court in 2008 in which it expressly upheld the approach taken in *Galli331* Hence, when Claimants submitted the Request in 2008 - and this is the perspective from which the futility *vel non* of having recourse to Argentine courts must be assessed - they were confronted with a line of Supreme Court cases manifesting that the latter was not willing to let the judiciary interfere with the debt restructuring decisions of Congress regarding the emergency situation of the early 2000s.\n\n*Lucesoli, Daniel Bernard c/ Poder Ejecutivo Nacional s/ amparo,* Case No. L. 542. XLIII, 9 September 2008 (Annex CLA-38) and *Rizzuti, Carlos Pablo c/ Poder Ejecutivo Nacional s/ amparo,* Case No. R. 483. XLIV, 22 December 2008 (Annex CLA-39).\n\n620.\n\nGiven the jurisprudence of the Supreme Court of Argentina and in the light of the circumstances prevailing in the present case, the Tribunal concludes that having recourse to the Argentine domestic courts and eventually to the Supreme Court would not have offered Claimants a reasonable possibility to obtain effective redress from the local courts and would have accordingly been futile. Hence, Claimants did not violate the duty to have recourse to Argentine courts under Art. 8(2) and (3) of the Argentina-Italy BIT when they submitted the Request for Arbitration on 23 June 2008.\n\n621.\n\nThe Tribunal would like to add, to its knowledge, since 1994, i.e. the introduction of the new Art. 75 para. 22 into the Argentine Constitution, no domestic law was struck down for being incompatible with a BIT.\n\n622.\n\n(c) As regards the cost argument, there can be no doubt that approaching the local courts will create additional costs for the investor. However, as the International Law Commission has rightly pointed out in the context of the duty to exhaust local remedies in cases of diplomatic protection, it is not sufficient to show that those remedies are \"difficult or costly. The test is [...] whether the municipal system of the respondent State is reasonably capable of providing effective relief.\"332 While Claimants contend that filing their claim in the Argentine courts may have given rise to substantial costs, they have not established that the financial burden imposed upon them would reach an extent that the Argentine court system cannot be deemed reasonably capable of providing effective relief. To reach such conclusion on the basis of mere financial reasons can only be envisaged, if at all, in exceptional circumstances.\n\nILC Draft Articles on Diplomatic Protection, Art. 15(a), Commentary; see *supra* note 324.\n\n623.\n\nIn addition, Art. 8(4) of the Argentina-Italy BIT provides that \"[f]rom the moment an arbitral proceeding is commenced, each of the parties of the dispute will adopt all the necessary measures in order to desist from the ongoing judicial proceeding.\" This provision may help to alleviate the financial burden by avoiding or reducing costs incumbent upon Claimants inasmuch as it also commits a Party to take the necessary steps to allow the other Party to desist from the domestic proceedings. Hence, once the 18 months term has expired and a Party decides to proceed to international arbitration, the other Party must, to the extent possible, adopt the necessary measures so that no additional costs will arise for the former Party due to the mere fact of exercising a right expressly granted to it by the BIT, namely Art. 8(3) of the BIT. Any other interpretation would not be consistent with an application of Art. 8(4) in good faith. As a possible consequence, if a Party used instruments of domestic law available to it to make the other Party leaving the domestic proceedings overly costly so as to actually restrain it from proceeding to international arbitration, this might constitute a violation of Art. 8(4) of the BIT and might lead the aggrieved Party to sue for the loss incurred in the subsequent arbitral proceedings.\n\n**(4) The Tribunal\u2019s conclusions and the Decision in the** ***Abaclat*** **case**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n624.\n\nThe Tribunal in the *Abaclat* case came to the same result, viz., that the duty to have recourse to Argentine courts, according to Art. 8(2) and (3) of the Argentina-Italy BIT, was not violated by Claimants, albeit on the basis of a different reasoning. It did not want to rely so much on the \"general principle of futility\" but rather on a \"weighting of the specific interests at stake.\" This weighing of interests of the Parties aims at taking into serious consideration the host State\u2019s interest of having an opportunity to address the allegedly wrongful act within the framework of its own domestic legal system before resorting to international arbitration, and then at comparing this interest with that of the Claimants of being provided with an efficient dispute resolution mechanism. In the *Abaclat* Tribunal\u2019s opinion, \"the relevant question is not \u2018could the dispute have been efficiently settled before the Argentine courts?\u2019, but \u2018was Argentina deprived of a fair opportunity to address the dispute within the framework of its own domestic legal system because of Claimants\u2019 disregard of the 18 months litigation requirement?\"\u2019333 \"[T]his opportunity must not only be a theoretical opportunity, but there must be a real chance in practice that the Host State, through its courts, would address the issue in a way that could lead to an effective resolution of the dispute\".334\n\n*Abaclat* Decision, para. 581 as well as paras. 582 and 584.\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 582.\n\n625.\n\nOn the basis of that approach to the question, the *Abaclat* Tribunal concluded that \"[i]n the light of the Emergency Law335 and other relevant laws and decrees, which prohibited any kind of payment of compensation to Claimants, the Tribunal finds that Argentina was not in a position to adequately address the present dispute within the framework of its domestic legal system. As such, Argentina\u2019s interest in pursuing this local remedy does not justify depriving Claimants of their right to resort to arbitration for the sole reason that they decided not to previously submit their dispute to the Argentinean courts.\"336\n\nThe *Abaclat* Tribunal hereby refers to Law No. 26,017, also referred to as *ley Cerrojo* (see *ibid.,* para. 78). As to the ambiguity of the majority decision in this regard (which also refers to the Public Emergency and Reform Law of 2002 as \"Emergency Law\"; *ibid.,* para. 60) see *CIV\u00a7 19, n. 12* and *RIV16, n. 62.*\n\n*Abaclat* Decision, para. 588.\n\n626.\n\nThe reasoning of the *Abaclat* Tribunal is committed to an approach focusing on \"the context, as well as [...] the purpose and aim of Article 8.\"337 While this wording evokes elements of Art. 31 of the VCLT, the Tribunal\u2019s decision was harshly criticized in the Dissenting Opinion of Professor Abi-Saab for \"tak[ing] the liberty of striking out a clear conventional requirement, on the basis of its purely subjective judgment.\"338 The present Tribunal has chosen a different path for its own reasoning on the matter and has, in the previous sub-section, laid out in detail how an interpretation strictly faithful to the requirements of Art. 31 of VCLT, notably including Art. 31(3)(c) of the Vienna Convention, leads to identify a futility exception in the pertinent *lex lata,* i.e. Art. 8(2) and (3) of the Argentina-Italy BIT.\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 579.\n\nDissenting Opinion of Professor Abi-Saab in the *Abaclat* case, para. 30.\n\n627.\n\nThe Tribunal cannot ignore, however, that on a more general level the \"futility\" reasoning which governs the present Decision and the \"fair opportunity\" approach endorsed by the *Abaclat* Tribunal are not mutually exclusive, but complement each other. In fact, they seem to be based on different perspectives on the same reality of competing interests. Whilst the \"futility\" reasoning rather looks at the problem from *Claimants \u2019* side, the \"fair opportunity\" approach, by asking whether *Respondent* is given a fair opportunity to address the dispute through its local courts, takes the latter\u2019s perspective. Similarly, whereas the emphasis of the \"futility\" approach is on the existence for Claimants of an *effective* remedy, the \"fair opportunity\" approach draws on the idea of *forfeiture* of Respondent\u2019s right to preferential dealing with the case due to its inability or unwillingness to provide effective legal means of redress to the investor(s).\n\n628.\n\nIn sum, the challenge is to strike a balance between these equally legitimate and important interests under the circumstances of a concrete case. In view of Respondent\u2019s acts, notably the adoption of Law No. 26,017, it would seem to the Tribunal to impose an undue burden on Claimants and not to be compatible with the Tribunal\u2019s responsibility to guarantee fair and effective arbitration proceedings to construe Art. 8 of the Argentina-Italy BIT so as to require Claimants to have recourse to Argentine courts when being placed in a situation such as the present one and sanction their not having done so by dismissing the case. After all, it was acts clearly attributable to the Respondent, namely arts. 3 and 6 of Law No. 26,017, which prevented both the executive and judicial authorities of Argentina by legislative *fiat* of the Argentine Congress - laws enacted by Congress being, according to Art. 13 of the Argentine Constitution, alongside the Constitution itself, \"the supreme law of the Nation\" - from addressing, let alone effectively settling, the claims of the Claimants within the domestic legal system of Argentina. Accordingly, it cannot be concluded that the requirement of having recourse to Respondent\u2019s domestic courts, as set forth in Art. 8(2) and (3) of the Argentina-Italy BIT, was violated by Claimants.\n\n***d) No need to rely on the most favoured nation clause of Art. 3(1) of*** ***the BIT***\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n629.\n\nIn view of this result, it is not necessary for the Tribunal to enter into the question whether the most favoured nation clause contained in Art. 3 para. 1 of the Argentina-Italy BIT may have entitled Claimants to rely on the allegedly more favourable dispute resolution clause contained in Art. VII(3) of the Argentina-US BIT.\n\n**DISSENTING OPINION BY ARBITRATOR TORRES BERN\u00c1RDEZ**\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n630.\n\nArbitrator Dr. Torres Bern\u00e1rdez will issue a Dissenting Opinion to the present Decision on Jurisdiction and Admissibility. In agreement with Dr. Torres Bern\u00e1rdez, the text of the Dissenting Opinion will be published subsequently.\n\n**DECISIONS TAKEN BY THE TRIBUNAL**\n-----------------------------------\n\n631.\n\nIn view of the above reasoning and subject to the mandate given to it by the Parties to restrict its decision at this stage of the proceedings to \"preliminary objections of a general character only\"339, the Tribunal\n\n*- Decides* that the present case falls within the jurisdiction of the Centre and that the Tribunal has competence to decide the present case;\n\n*- Decides* that the Claimants\u2019 claims are admissible;\n\n*- Therefore dismisses* all Respondent\u2019s objections as regards jurisdiction and admissibility;\n\n*- Takes note* of the discontinuance of proceedings as of 8 February 2103 in regard to the 29 Claimants listed in para. 343 above;\n\n*- Orders* the afore-mentioned Claimants and the Respondent to bear the arbitration costs and their own costs as set out in paras. 348-352 above and in a separate Procedural Order;\n\n*- Reserves* the decision on the costs not decided upon in the present Decision and in the separate Procedural Order to the merits phase of the proceedings;\n\n*- Decides* to rename the present proceedings \"Ambiente Ufficio S.p.A, and others v.
