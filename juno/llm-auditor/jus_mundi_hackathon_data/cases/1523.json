INTRODUCTION AND PARTIES**\n-------------------------------\n\n1.\n\nThis case concerns a dispute submitted to the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (\"ICSID\" or the \"Centre\") on the basis of the Agreement between the Government of the Russian Federation and the Government of Turkmenistan on the Promotion and Reciprocal Protection of Investments (the \"BIT\"), which was signed on 25 March 2009 and entered into force on 23 August 2010, and the ICSID Additional Facility Rules.\n\n2.\n\nThe Claimant is Public Joint Stock Company Mobile TeleSystems (\"MTS\" or the \"Claimant\"), a company registered under the laws of the Russian Federation.\n\n3.\n\nThe Respondent is Turkmenistan (\"Turkmenistan\" or the \"Respondent\").\n\n4.\n\nThe Claimant and the Respondent are collectively referred to as the \"Parties\". The Parties\u2019 representatives and their addresses are listed above on page (i).\n\n5.\n\nThis dispute concerns the Claimant\u2019s claims that the Respondent mistreated the Claimant\u2019s investment during its operation in the Turkmenistan telecommunications market between 2012 and 2017 and wrongfully shut down the Claimant\u2019s operations in September 2017 in violation of the BIT.\n\n**II. PROCEDURAL HISTORY**\n--------------------------\n\n6.\n\nOn 27 July 2018, ICSID received an electronic version of the Request for Arbitration from MTS against Turkmenistan, including Exhibits C-0001 to C-0028 (the \"Request\"). ICSID also received hard copies of the Request on 1 August 2018, and the prescribed lodging fee.\n\n7.\n\nOn 10 August 2018, pursuant to Article 4 of the Rules Governing the Additional Facility for the Administration of Proceedings by the Secretariat of ICSID (\"Arbitration Rules\"), the Acting Secretary-General approved access to the Additional Facility. In addition, in accordance with Article 4 of the Arbitration Rules, the Acting Secretary-General registered the Request and notified the Parties of the Registration. In the Notice of Registration, pursuant to Article 5(e) of the Arbitration Rules, the Acting Secretary-General invited the Parties to proceed to constitute a tribunal as soon as possible.\n\n8.\n\nOn 16 October 2018, further to the Claimant\u2019s request that the Tribunal in this case be constituted pursuant to the formula provided by Articles 6(1) and 9 of the Arbitration Rules, the Secretary-General informed the Respondent, pursuant to Rule Article 6(1) of the Arbitration Rules, that the Tribunal in the case was to be constituted pursuant to Article 9 of the Arbitration Rules. In accordance with this provision, the Tribunal shall consist of three arbitrators, one arbitrator appointed by each Party and the third, who shall be the President of the Tribunal, appointed by agreement of the Parties.\n\n9.\n\nOn 24 October 2018, the Claimant appointed Dr. Paolo Michele Patocchi, a national of Switzerland, as arbitrator in this case pursuant to Article 9 of the Arbitration Rules. On 31 October 2018, Dr. Patocchi accepted his appointment.\n\n10.\n\nOn 8 November 2018, the Respondent appointed Mr. John M. Townsend, a national of the United States, as arbitrator in this case pursuant to Article 9 of the Arbitration Rules. On 13 November 2018, Mr. Townsend accepted his appointment.\n\n11.\n\nBy email of 24 October 2018 and letter of 8 November 2018, the Parties had advised the Secretariat that they would agree on a method for the appointment of the President of the Tribunal after the co-arbitrators were appointed. On 8 November 2018, the co-arbitrators having accepted their appointments, ICSID invited the Parties to agree on the method for the appointment of the President of the Tribunal.\n\n12.\n\nOn 16 November 2018, ICSID acknowledged receipt of a letter from the Claimant proposing the method for the appointment of the presiding arbitrator and an email from the Respondent confirming its agreement to the Claimant\u2019s proposed method.\n\n13.\n\nBy letter dated 29 November 2018, the Claimant communicated the Parties\u2019 agreement to extend the time limit for the co-arbitrators to select the President of the Tribunal.\n\n14.\n\nOn 13 December 2018, Mr. Townsend and Dr. Patocchi agreed to nominate Professor Siegfried H. Elsing, a national of Germany, as President of the Tribunal in accordance with the method for appointment agreement upon between the Parties.\n\n15.\n\nMr. Townsend and Dr. Patocchi further made disclosures concerning their prior contacts with Professor Elsing.\n\n16.\n\nOn 18 December 2018, following nomination by his co-arbitrators, Professor Elsing accepted his appointment as presiding arbitrator.\n\n17.\n\nOn the same date, the Secretary-General, pursuant to Article 13(1) of the ICSID Arbitration Additional Facility Rules, notified the Parties that all three arbitrators had accepted their appointments and that the Tribunal was therefore deemed to have been constituted on that date and the proceeding to have begun. The Tribunal is thus composed of Professor Elsing, President, appointed by his co-arbitrators; Dr. Patocchi appointed by the Claimant; and Mr. Townsend, appointed by the Respondent. Ms. Martina Polasek, Deputy Secretary-General, ICSID, was designated to serve as Secretary of the Tribunal.\n\n18.\n\nOn 12 January 2019, taking into account the Claimant\u2019s letter of 3 January 2019, the Respondent\u2019s e-mail of 7 January 2019, the Claimant\u2019s e-mail of 8 January 2019 and the Respondent\u2019s letter of 10 January 2019, the Tribunal decided to hold the first session in-person in Paris on 29 January 2019.\n\n19.\n\nThe Respondent was initially represented by Curtis, Mallet-Prevost, Colt & Mosle LLP (\"CMC&M\"). On 27 January 2019, the Respondent presented a power of attorney appointing Squire Patton Boggs (\"SPB\") as its co-counsel. Ms. Harwood, the Respondent\u2019s lead counsel, had changed firms and was now a partner at SPB, effective as of 22 January 2019.\n\n20.\n\nOn 28 January 2019, the Claimant requested the Tribunal to disallow the presence of Ms. Harwood at the first session to be held in Paris, France, on 29 January 2019, due to a potential conflict of interest involving her new firm.\n\n21.\n\nOn 28 January 2019, the Tribunal, after having heard the Parties, permitted Ms. Harwood to attend the first session due to the short notice of the Claimant\u2019s request and the nature of the matters to be discussed at such conference.\n\n22.\n\nOn 29 January 2019, the Tribunal held a first session in Paris.\n\n23.\n\nDuring the first session, Ms. Harwood informed the Tribunal that she was now a partner at SPB and that her colleagues, Mr. Ali Gursel and Ms. Bahar Charyyeva, planned to transfer to SPB as well. The Claimant did not object to SPB participating in the conference but reserved its right to apply for disqualification of SPB.\n\n24.\n\nThe Tribunal in its letter of 2 February 2019 granted the Claimant a time limit until 28 February 2019 to apply for the disqualification of SPB as counsel and granted the Respondent 30 days from the receipt of the Claimant\u2019s application to comment on such application. In addition, the Tribunal directed SPB to establish an ethical wall immediately.\n\n25.\n\nOn 5 February 2019, the Respondent informed the Tribunal that, in accordance with its instructions at the first session held on 29 January 2019, SPB had \"immediately notified all personnel worldwide of the ethical wall established to prevent the sharing or disclosure of confidential information or documents, if any, that may have been obtained in the course of the prior representation concluded in 2013 involving certain entities referred to in Claimant\u2019s letter to the Tribunal dated 28 January 2019. This has been implemented as a precautionary measure, without prejudice to SPB\u2019s position on the matters raised in Claimant\u2019s letter\".\n\n26.\n\nOn 22 February 2019, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 1 recording the agreement of the Parties on procedural matters and the decision of the Tribunal on disputed issues. Procedural Order No. 1 provides, inter alia, that the applicable Arbitration Rules would be the ICSID Arbitration (Additional Facility) Rules in force as of 10 April 2006, the Rules of Procedure contained in Procedural Order No. 1 and the procedural rulings of the Tribunal taken in accordance with Section 5 of Procedural Order No. 1. The procedural language was decided to be English and the place of proceeding was recorded as Stockholm, Sweden. Procedural Order No. 1 also set out the agreed procedural timetable for the Merits phase of the proceedings.\n\n27.\n\nProcedural Order No. 1 further listed as counsel of record for the Claimant - Mr. Jay Alexander, Dr. Johannes Koepp, Dr. Alejandro Escobar and Ms. Valeriya Kirsey of Baker Botts (UK) LLP and for the Respondent - Mr. Ali Gursel, Ms. Bahar Charyyeva of Curtis, Mallet-Prevost, Colt & Mosle LLP and Ms. Miriam Harwood of Squire Patton Boggs LLP. SPB\u2019s representation was recorded without prejudice to the Claimant\u2019s reservation of rights with respect to the involvement of SPB in this arbitration.\n\n28.\n\nOn 26 February 2019, the Claimant requested an extension of time for the application to disqualify SPB until 14 March 2019, which the Tribunal granted by email on 27 February 2019.\n\n29.\n\nOn 6 March 2019, ICSID requested the Parties to confirm if they wished the October 2020 hearing to be held at the seat of arbitration in Stockholm.\n\n30.\n\nOn 11 March 2019, further to the Tribunal\u2019s instructions, the Respondent filed a submission rejecting the Claimant\u2019s request that SPB resign from the case.\n\n31.\n\nOn 14 March 2019, the Claimant filed its application to disqualify SPB.\n\n32.\n\nOn 17 March 2019, ICSID Secretary-General informed the Parties that Ms. Leah Waithira Njoroge, Legal Counsel, ICSID, was designated to serve as Secretary of the Tribunal in replacement of Ms. Polasek.\n\n33.\n\nOn 19 March 2019, the Claimant communicated its preference for the hearing to be held in London.\n\n34.\n\nOn 20 March 2019, the Respondent informed the Tribunal that all of the Respondent\u2019s counsel were now affiliated with SPB.\n\n35.\n\nOn 29 March 2019, the Claimant filed a request for an urgent order concerning the Parties\u2019 confidentiality obligations (\"Confidentiality Request\"). The Claimant was due to file its Memorial on the same day and intended to \"exhibit certain documents which are not public and are of a highly commercially sensitive nature in that they contain Claimant\u2019s proprietary information\".1\n\nClaimant\u2019s letter of 29 March 2019.\n\n36.\n\nOn 29 March 2019, the Respondent informed the Tribunal that it was not in a position to comment on the Confidentiality Request immediately because it was awaiting instructions from its client.\n\n37.\n\nOwing to the short notice of the Confidentiality Request and the Respondent not being able to comment on the Confidentiality Request before the time limit for Claimant\u2019s Memorial expired, likewise on 29 March 2019, the Tribunal directed the Claimant to proceed with providing its Memorial and related documents on the current schedule. Documents that required special treatment were directed to be placed in a separate folder which were directed to be clearly labelled as containing confidential documents. The Tribunal directed the Respondent to keep such documents separate and not to disseminate them outside the law firm of the Respondent\u2019s counsel until the Tribunal had the opportunity to rale on the Claimant\u2019s Confidentiality Request.\n\n38.\n\nOn 29 March 2019, the Claimant filed its Memorial on the Merits (\"Cl. Mem.\") including:\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n\u2022 Fact Exhibits C-0001 through C-0300, C-0302 through C-0355;\n\n\u2022 Expert Report of Annette Bohr with Exhibits AB-0001 to AB-0076 (\"Bohr Report\");\n\n\u2022 Expert Report of Laura Hardin with Annexes 1 to 5, Appendices 1 to 19 and Exhibits LH-0001 to LH-0011, LH-0013 to LH-0025, LH-0027 to LH-0047, LH-0049 to LH-0095, LH-0097 to LH-0143, LH-00145 to LH-0152 (\"Hardin Report\"); and\n\n\u2022 Legal Authorities CL-0001 through CL-0133.\n\nOut of 355 Fact Exhibits, 275 were marked \"Confidential\" and placed in a separate folder on Box (ICSID\u2019s file sharing platform) as per the Tribunal\u2019s instructions.\n\n39.\n\nOn 2 April 2019, the Respondent informed the Tribunal that it would adhere to the Tribunal\u2019s instructions of 29 March 2019 and revert with its response to the Claimant\u2019s application by no later than 5 April 2019.\n\n40.\n\nOn 5 April 2019, the Respondent filed observations on the Claimant\u2019s request of 29 March 2019, on the confidentiality of documents objecting to \"Claimant\u2019s Application and respectfully request(ing) that it be denied\" on the ground that the Claimant\u2019s Confidentiality Request had no basis or justification and was overbroad and untenable.\n\n41.\n\nOn 7 April 2019, the Tribunal granted the Claimant a time limit until 9 April 2019 to file a response to the Respondent\u2019s letter of 5 April 2019 on the confidentiality of documents.\n\n42.\n\nOn 8 April 2019, the Respondent requested that the hearing be held at the seat of the arbitration in Stockholm.\n\n43.\n\nOn 9 April 2019, the Claimant filed its response to the Respondent\u2019s letter of 5 April 2019.\n\n44.\n\nOn 12 April 2019, the Tribunal granted an extension of time for the Respondent\u2019s response to the Disqualification Request until 25 April 2019.\n\n45.\n\nOn 12 April 2019, the Respondent forwarded a letter from the Ministry of Justice of Turkmenistan revolting the power of attorney previously granted to CMC&M and confirmed that CMC&M no longer represented Turkmenistan in this arbitration.\n\n46.\n\nOn 15 April 2019, the Respondent filed observations on the Claimant\u2019s response of 9 April 2019 on the confidentiality of documents.\n\n47.\n\nOn 22 April 2019, the Tribunal gave preliminary directions to the Parties as follows:\n\n1. Respondent was currently permitted to share Confidential Documents with any official of the Respondent who was assisting with this arbitration.\n\n2. All time limits between the counter-memorial and the hearing will be postponed by two weeks. The procedural calendar will be amended accordingly and transmitted to the Parties by separate email.\n\n3. The Tribunal appreciates the cooperation of the Parties and encourages them, to the extent possible, to find mutually acceptable solutions to any further procedural issues before requesting a decision of the Tribunal.\n\n48.\n\nOn 23 April 2019, the procedural calendar was amended recording that all time limits between the counter-memorial and the hearing were postponed by two weeks and transmitted to the Parties by separate email.\n\n49.\n\nOn 25 April 2019, the Respondent filed its Opposition to the Claimant\u2019s Application for Disqualification of the Respondent\u2019s Counsel, together with the Legal Expert Opinion of Professor Roy D. Simon, Jr.\n\n50.\n\nNoting the Claimant\u2019s message of 25 April 2019, advising it that it intended to approach the Respondent to attempt to reach a mutually agreed solution relating to the treatment of confidential documents, the Tribunal, on 27 April 2019, invited the Parties to update it on their negotiations by 9 May 2019 and invited them to consider Article 3.13 of the IBA Rules in their discussions. After being granted an extension of time, the Claimant filed its letter to the Tribunal on 24 May 2019 informing the Tribunal that the Parties had not come to an agreement.\n\n51.\n\nOn 24 May 2019, the Claimant also filed its reply to the Respondent\u2019s Opposition to the Claimant\u2019s Application for Disqualification of the Respondent\u2019s Counsel.\n\n52.\n\nOn 14 June 2019, the Respondent filed observations on the Claimant\u2019s response of 24 May 2019 on the proposal for disqualification which was followed by further submissions by both the Claimant and the Respondent on 19 June 2019.\n\n53.\n\nOn 14 June 2019, the Respondent also filed observations on the Claimant\u2019s response of 24 May 2019 on confidentiality of documents.\n\n54.\n\nOn 3 July 2019, the Tribunal issued a procedural order on confidentiality of documents. The Tribunal denied the Claimant\u2019s Confidentiality Request of 29 March 2019 in its entirety and rescinded its interim orders of 29 March 2019 and 22 April 2019 concerning the disclosure of Confidential Documents.\n\n55.\n\nOn 9 August 2019, the Tribunal dismissed the Claimant\u2019s Application that SPB be disqualified as the Respondent\u2019s counsel (\"Non-Disqualification Decision\").

Respondent\u2019s request that Claimant be precluded from aggravating this dispute further by re-litigating its Application in any other forum, should MTS not be satisfied with the Tribunal\u2019s decision, was dismissed.\n\n5. The decision on the costs of the Tribunal and of the Parties that were incurred with this Application will be determined in the Award together with the overall costs of the proceedings.\n\n56.\n\nOn 6 September 2019, pursuant to the Tribunal\u2019s instructions, the Respondent filed the Affidavit of Charles E. Talisman, Assistant General Counsel of SPB providing a description of the Ethical Wall measures implemented at SPB in connection with this matter and Affidavits of Miriam K.

Dippon, Ph.D., with Exhibits CD-0061 to CD-0119 and Appendices 1 to 26 (\"Second Dippon Report\");\n\n\u2022 Legal Authorities RL-0173 to RL-0221; and\n\n\u2022 Fact Exhibits R-0201 to R-0268.\n\n73.\n\nOn 27 January 2021, the Claimant filed two applications (i) an Application to Obtain Further Documents and for Leave to File Further Expert Reports on Quantum (the \"Quantum Application\"); and (ii) an Application for Production of Original Hard-Copy Documents for Inspection (the \"Inspection Application\").\n\n74.\n\nOn 19 February 2021, the Respondent submitted Responses to the Quantum Application (the \"Response to Quantum\") and to the Inspection Application (the \"Response to Inspection\").\n\n75.\n\nBy its letter of 19 February 2021, the Claimant stated that, in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, it appeared unlikely that it would be possible to hold an in-person hearing in Stockholm by July and suggested that the Parties and the Tribunal give consideration to possible alternative arrangements for the hearing.\n\n76.\n\nOn 24 February 2021, the Claimant submitted its Replies to the Respondent\u2019s Opposition to the Quantum Application and to the Inspection Application (the \"Reply to Quantum\" and \"Reply to Inspection\").\n\n77.\n\nIn response to the Tribunal\u2019s invitation, on 25 February 2021, the Respondent submitted its observations on the Claimant\u2019s letter of 19 February 2021. In its letter, the Respondent stated that it welcomed further discussion of alternative dates and/or locations, and specifically invited the Claimant to indicate its availability after 15 October 2021, as well as input from the Tribunal as to its ability to accommodate the Parties, in the event that an in-person hearing could not be held in July 2021, either in Stockholm or another location.\n\n78.\n\nOn 1 March 2021, the Respondent submitted its Rejoinders to the Claimant\u2019s Reply to the Respondent\u2019s Opposition to the Quantum Application and to the Inspection Application (the \"Rejoinder to Quantum\" and \"Rejoinder to Inspection\").\n\n79.\n\nAlso, on 1 March 2021, the Claimant wrote with reference to the Respondent\u2019s letter of 25 February 2021 and the Claimant\u2019s letter of 19 February 2021, asking the Tribunal to indicate whether it could be available for a hearing at any time in November or December 2021.\n\n80.\n\nOn 2 March 2021, in response to the Claimant\u2019s request of 1 March 2021, the Tribunal confirmed its availability to convene the hearing on 6-17 December 2021.\n\n81.\n\nOn 9 March 2021, the Claimant indicated that the Claimant and its representatives were available on 6-17 December 2021, and was willing to agree to vacate the July 2021 dates and postpone the hearing until 6-17 December 2021, on the understanding that, if it proved impossible for any reason to hold an in-person hearing in December 2021, the Parties and the Tribunal would reconsider holding a virtual hearing at that time in order to ensure that the hearing would not be further delayed until 2022.\n\n82.\n\nOn 11 March 2021, the Respondent confirmed that it would be available for an in-person hearing on 6-17 December 2021, and that it agreed to vacate the July 2021 hearing dates. The Respondent also emphasized in the same correspondence that, notwithstanding this rescheduling of the July 2021 hearing, the Parties should not engage in further submissions prior to the new hearing dates, including a third round of expert reports or additional production of documentary evidence, and that the Claimant\u2019s pending applications should be denied.\n\n83.\n\nBy its letter of 16 March 2021, the Tribunal confirmed that it vacated the hearing dates of 5-16 July 2021 and the case management conference scheduled for 7 April 2021, and invited the Parties to confer and submit their respective views where they were unable to agree, by 23 March 2021. In particular, the Parties were invited to indicate whether they were open to considering Washington, D.C., or Paris as a venue for the hearing. Also, the Tribunal informed the Parties that the ICSID Secretariat, on the Tribunal\u2019s instructions, made a tentative booking of the facilities at the ICSID Hearing Centre in Washington, D.C., while maintaining the arrangements in Stockholm with revised dates.\n\n84.\n\nOn 19 March 2021, the Parties informed the Tribunal that the Parties had agreed to extend the deadline for the notification of witnesses and experts for cross-examination until 31 August 2021 and to reschedule the Pre-Hearing Conference to sometime in September 2021.\n\n85.\n\nWith reference to the Parties\u2019 correspondence of 19 March 2021, on 23 March 2021, the Tribunal approved the agreed modifications to the procedural timetable and the deadline for notification of witnesses and experts for cross-examination was accordingly extended to 31 August 2021. Further, the Tribunal confirmed its availability to convene the Pre-Hearing Conference on either 29 or 30 September 2021, and invited the Parties to indicate their availability on those dates.\n\n86.\n\nOn 23 March 2021, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 4 concerning the Claimant\u2019s Quantum Application and Inspection Application. In this Order, the Tribunal stated that it was not convinced that an order for the production of the requested documents was necessary; however, out of utmost precaution, the Tribunal recommended that the Respondent should preserve the originals of these documents in case an inspection of any of them should become necessary at a later stage of the proceeding.\n\n87.\n\nAlso, on 23 March 2021, the Claimant informed the Tribunal that the Parties had conferred as requested in the Tribunal\u2019s letter of 16 March 2021, but they had been unable to reach an agreement. The Claimant further stated that it was open, in principle, to considering alternative hearing venues other than Stockholm; however, Washington D.C. was not the Claimant\u2019s preferred option due to the increased costs associated with holding the hearing in the U.S. as well as the difficulties for Russian citizens in obtaining U.S. entry visas.\n\n88.\n\nOn 24 March 2021, the Respondent confirmed that it was open to Washington D.C. or Paris as a hearing venue, and indicated its preference for Washington D.C. as between Washington D.C., Paris, and Stockholm.\n\n89.\n\nIn response to the Tribunal\u2019s invitation of 23 March 2021, on 26 March 2021, the Claimant informed the Tribunal that it would be unavailable for a Pre-Hearing Conference during the working day (U.K. time) on 29 or 30 September 2021, but it would be available on those days after 7 pm U.K. time. On 29 March 2021, the Respondent confirmed its availability for a Pre-Hearing Conference on 29 September 2021 at 7 pm U.K. time.\n\n90.\n\nOn 8 September 2021, the Tribunal confirmed that, because of the increasing complications and concerns caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the hearing scheduled for 6-17 December 2021 would proceed virtually by video conference.\n\n91.\n\nPursuant to Section 19.1 of Procedural Order No. 1, a pre-hearing organizational meeting between the Parties and the Tribunal was held by videoconference on 29 September 2021 (the \"Pre-Hearing Conference\"), to discuss any procedural, administrative, and logistical matters in preparation for the Hearing. Participating were:\n\n*Tribunal:*\n\nProfessor Dr. Siegfried H. Elsing President  \nDr. Paolo Michele Patocchi Arbitrator  \nMr. John M. Townsend Arbitrator\n\n*ICSID Secretariat:*\n\nMs. Leah W. Njoroge Secretary of the Tribunal\n\n*For the Claimant:*\n\nDr. Johannes Koepp Baker Botts (UK) LLP  \nMr. Jay Alexander Baker Botts (UK) LLP  \nMr. David Turner Baker Botts (UK) LLP  \nMs. Valeriya Kirsey Baker Botts (UK) LLP  \nMs. Izabella Kharlamova Baker Botts (UK) LLP\n\n*For the Respondent:*\n\nMs. Miriam Harwood Squire Patton Boggs (US) LLP  \nMr. Ali Gursel Squire Patton Boggs (US) LLP  \nMr. John Branson Squire Patton Boggs (US) LLP  \nMs. Zeynep Gunday Sakarya Squire Patton Boggs (US) LLP  \nMr. Carlos Guzman Plascencia Squire Patton Boggs (US) LLP\n\n92.\n\nDuring the Pre-Hearing Conference, the Parties and the Tribunal discussed draft Procedural Order No. 5 circulated to the Parties on 16 September 2021. An audio recording of the Pre-Hearing Conference was made and deposited in the archives of ICSID, and it was made available to the Members of the Tribunal and the Parties on 30 September 2021.\n\n93.\n\nOn 29 September 2021, during the Pre-Hearing Conference, the Respondent raised an objection concerning the format of the hearing, stating that it considered that a virtual hearing was inappropriate in light of the importance and complexity of the present case. The Tribunal answered that its decision had been made reluctantly in light of the health risks and complications caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and the Parties\u2019 inability to agree on a venue in the course of an exchange of correspondence conducted over several months. After further deliberation, the Tribunal maintained its decision to proceed with the Hearing virtually by videoconference.\n\n94.\n\nOn 15 October 2021, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 5. which set out the procedural rules that would govern the conduct of the hearing. Inter alia, paragraph 29 of Procedural Order No. 5 directed the Claimant to provide, to the Respondent only, an advance copy of the PowerPoint presentation that its expert witness Mr. Thomas proposed to use at the Hearing.\n\n95.\n\nOn 5 November 2021, the Respondent submitted two letters seeking orders from the Tribunal concerning (i) Mr. Thomas\u2019s demonstratives, arguing inter alia that the slides contained a new damages model; and that Mr. Thomas should not give evidence at the hearing and, in the alternative, requesting that the hearing dates be vacated, should the Tribunal admit Mr. Thomas\u2019s slides; and (ii) the Respondent\u2019s objections to the Claimant\u2019s request to submit new exhibits and legal authorities into the record. At the Tribunal\u2019s invitation, the Claimant submitted its responses to the Respondent\u2019s 5 November 2021 letters on 10 November 2021.\n\n96.\n\nBy letter dated 15 November 2021, the Tribunal, in relation to Mr. Thomas\u2019s slides, stated that these demonstratives should not be an expert report \"in disguise\", that the Tribunal accepted the Claimant\u2019s representations in its letter dated 10 November 2021 that Mr. Thomas did not seek to introduce a new model at the hearing and that his presentation was directed at critiquing the new model put forward by Dr. Dippon. The Tribunal ruled that, based on that understanding, Mr. Thomas might make his presentation at the hearing and reserved its right to admit or request further input from the Parties on quantum issues after the hearing if it emerged that the demonstratives contained new evidence. The Tribunal also ruled that it did not consider that the admission of Mr. Thomas\u2019s presentation required any change in the hearing dates, as the Respondent had been provided an advance copy of that presentation giving the Respondent the opportunity to prepare for Mr. Thomas\u2019s cross-examination well in advance.\n\n97.\n\nBy letter dated 16 November 2021, the Respondent wrote to the Tribunal submitting that it could not proceed with the hearing for various reasons, inter alia because Mr. Thomas\u2019s presentation contained new evidence, and that it objected to the virtual format of the hearing. The Respondent requested the Tribunal to vacate the hearing dates and reschedule an in-person hearing within three months after consultations with the Parties.\n\n98.\n\nIn its letter dated 18 November 2021, submitted at the Tribunal\u2019s invitation, the Claimant argued that the Respondent had not provided any basis for the Tribunal to revisit its decision concerning the hearing and submitted that there was nothing in the ICSID Additional Facility Rules and Swedish law that prevented the Tribunal from ruling that the hearing proceed virtually.\n\n99.\n\nOn 19 November 2021, the Tribunal decided that the hearing would proceed virtually by video conference as scheduled. The Tribunal considered that the issue had been previously discussed with the Parties and determined in its past rulings of 8 September and 15 November 2021. The Tribunal agreed with the Claimant that nothing in the ICSID Additional Facility Rules, Swedish law and the Tribunal\u2019s own orders prevented it from deciding that the hearing proceed virtually. As to the allegation that Mr. Thomas\u2019s slides contained new evidence, the Tribunal noted that it had not yet seen the slides and could not determine whether they contained new evidence. The Tribunal offered to sit additional hearing days if it emerged at the hearing that there was new evidence to which the Respondent could not adequately respond and reiterated its decision that responses to any new material on quantum could be addressed in post-hearing submissions.\n\n100.\n\nOn 22 November 2021, the Respondent wrote again that it declined to proceed with the hearing due to the circumstances explained in its 16 November 2021 letter, *i.e.,* the alleged new evidence contained in Mr. Thomas\u2019s slides among others. The Respondent invoked Article 48 of the ICSID Arbitration (Additional Facility) Rules on default by a party and requested that the Tribunal grant a period of grace and reschedule the hearing in three months. The Respondent added that \"it fully intends to appear and present its case in this proceeding\".\n\n101.\n\nOn 24 November 2021, the Claimant submitted a response to the Respondent\u2019s 22 November 2021 letter, arguing that the Respondent had not satisfied the requirements of Article 48 of the ICSID Arbitration (Additional Facility) Rules. According to the Claimant, an Article 48 situation applies only where the non-cooperating party has failed to \"appear or to present its case at any stage of the proceeding\". The Claimant explained that while the Respondent declared that it \"declines to participate in the Hearing\", the Respondent had not yet \"failed to appear or present its case at a hearing\". The Claimant asked the Tribunal to dismiss the Respondent\u2019s Article 48 application, or, in the alternative, order the postponement of only the examination of quantum experts. The Claimant also requested that, should the Tribunal grant the Respondent\u2019s application, then the hearing should be rescheduled at the earliest opportunity in early or mid-2022, that the Respondent should not be entitled to any further period of grace under Article 48 and that the Respondent pay the Claimant\u2019s fees and expenses incurred between 29 September 2021 and the date on which the Tribunal ordered the hearing dates to be vacated.\n\n102.\n\nOn 25 November 2021, the Tribunal issued the following directions to the Parties: (i) the Tribunal would convene a Case Management Conference (\"CMC\") by videoconference on 29 November 2021 with the Parties starting at 12:30 pm EST/6:30 pm CET; (ii) the Respondent was directed to inform the Tribunal and the Claimant by 9 am EST/3 pm CET on 29 November 2021, whether it would participate in the hearing should the Tribunal decide to proceed with the hearing only for the examination of fact witnesses, and postpone the examination of experts until 2022; (iii) if the Respondent indicated that it would not participate in the hearing, the Claimant was invited to confirm before the commencement of the CMC whether it made a request in accordance with Article 48(1) of the ICSID Arbitration (Additional Facility) Rules; and (iv) the Tribunal informed the Parties that the weeks of 2 and 9 May 2022 had become available for a hearing and that each Party was invited to inform the Tribunal by 9 am EST/3 pm CET on 29 November 2021, if there was any insurmountable obstacle to its participation on those weeks either in (1) the continuation of the hearing, for examination of expert witnesses, should the examination of fact witnesses take place during the December dates, or (2) a full hearing, if it would not be possible to continue with any portion of the hearing on the December dates.\n\n103.\n\nBy letter dated 29 November 2021, the Respondent informed the Tribunal that it \"cannot proceed with the December hearing\". The Respondent also informed the Tribunal that it could not proceed with the separate examination of fact witnesses during the December hearing dates and postpone the examination of the quantum experts. According to the Respondent, the merits and quantum issues in this case are \"inextricably intertwined\" and separating these issues would result in the Respondent\u2019s inability to present the case fully to the Tribunal. The Respondent indicated its availability to participate in a hearing on the weeks of 2 and 9 May 2022.\n\n104.\n\nOn 29 November 2021, the Claimant submitted a letter requesting the Tribunal to proceed under Article 48(1) of the ICSID Arbitration (Additional Facility) Rules \"on the basis that the Respondent has unequivocally signalled that it intends to default by failing to attend\" the hearing. The Claimant reiterated its request that the Tribunal deny the Respondent\u2019s request for a period of grace under Article 48(2) of the ICSID Arbitration (Additional Facility) Rules. In the alternative, the Claimant submitted that if the Tribunal were to grant the Respondent a period of grace, it should rule that the Respondent was not entitled to a further period of grace if it subsequently refused to participate in the rescheduled hearing. The Claimant indicated that its expert, Ms. Hardin, would not be available during the May 2022 dates proposed by the Tribunal due to a conflict.\n\n105.\n\nPursuant to the Tribunal\u2019s directions of 25 November 2021, a CMC between the Parties and the Tribunal was held by videoconference on 29 November 2021 at 12:30 pm EST (the \"29 November CMC\"). Participating in the 29 November CMC were:\n\n*Tribunal:*\n\nProfessor Dr. Siegfried H. Elsing President  \nDr. Paolo Michele Patocchi Arbitrator  \nMr. John M. Townsend Arbitrator\n\n*ICSID Secretariat:*\n\nMs. Leah W. Njoroge Secretary of the Tribunal\n\n*For the Claimant:*\n\nDr. Johannes Koepp Baker Botts (UK) LLP  \nMr. Jay Alexander Baker Botts (UK) LLP  \nMs. Valeriya Kirsey Baker Botts (UK) LLP  \nMr. David Turner Baker Botts (UK) LLP  \n[REDACTED]\n\n*For the Respondent:*\n\nMs. Miriam Harwood Squire Patton Boggs (US) LLP  \nMr. Ali Gursel Squire Patton Boggs (US) LLP  \nMr. John Branson Squire Patton Boggs (US) LLP  \nMs. Zeynep Gunday Sakarya Squire Patton Boggs (US) LLP  \nMr. Carlos Guzman Plascencia Squire Patton Boggs (US) LLP\n\n106.\n\nAn audio recording of the 29 November CMC was made and deposited in the archives of ICSID, and it was made available to the Members of the Tribunal and the Parties on 30 November 2021.\n\n107.\n\nThe Tribunal discussed with the Parties the status of the Hearing based on their submissions concerning Article 48 of the ICSID Arbitration (Additional Facility) Rules and their indications of availability for a rescheduled hearing in May 2022. The Tribunal also discussed with the Parties the issue of Mr. Thomas\u2019s presentation. The Respondent, after being asked by the Tribunal, clearly confirmed that it would not appear at the hearing in December 2021, whereupon the Claimant made a request according to Article 48(1) of the ICSID Arbitration (Additional Facility) Rules.\n\n108.\n\nIn the course of the 29 November CMC, the Tribunal fixed another CMC on 7 December 2021, starting at 10 am EST, to discuss the Parties\u2019 proposals for finding arrangements to accommodate the examination of Ms. Hardin during the May 2022 dates. This was confirmed by the Tribunal in a message of 29 November 2021.\n\n109.\n\nPursuant to the Tribunal\u2019s directions of 29 November 2021, another CMC between the Parties and the Tribunal was held by videoconference on 7 December 2021, at 10 am EST (the \"7 December CMC\"). Participating in the 7 December CMC were:\n\n*Tribunal:*\n\nProfessor Dr. Siegfried H. Elsing President  \nDr. Paolo Michele Patocchi Arbitrator  \nMr. John M. Townsend Arbitrator\n\n*ICSID Secretariat:*\n\nMs. Leah W. Njoroge Secretary of the Tribunal\n\n*For the Claimant:*\n\nDr. Johannes Koepp Baker Botts (UK) LLP  \nMr. Jay Alexander Baker Botts (UK) LLP  \nMs. Valeriya Kirsey Baker Botts (UK) LLP  \nMr. David Turner Baker Botts (UK) LLP\n\n*For the Respondent:*\n\nMs. Miriam Harwood Squire Patton Boggs (US) LLP  \nMr. Ali Gursel Squire Patton Boggs (US) LLP  \nMr. John Branson Squire Patton Boggs (US) LLP  \nMs. Zeynep Gunday Sakarya Squire Patton Boggs (US) LLP  \nMr. Carlos Guzman Plascencia Squire Patton Boggs (US) LLP\n\n110.\n\nAn audio recording of the 7 December CMC was made and deposited in the archives of ICSID, and it was made available to the Members of the Tribunal and the Parties on 7 December 2021.\n\n111.\n\nThe Tribunal and the Parties discussed proposals to accommodate Ms. Hardin\u2019s testimony on the May 2022 dates among other procedural items relating to the organization of the hearing in May 2022.\n\n112.\n\nOn 15 December 2021, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 6, by which the Tribunal (i) confirmed that the hearing was postponed by operation of Article 48(2) of the ICSID Arbitration (Additional Facility) Rules and the Respondent was hereby put on notice that the Tribunal would not entertain a further request from it for postponement of the hearing dates rescheduled in accordance with this provision; (ii) directed the Claimant\u2019s expert, Mr. Thomas, and the Respondent\u2019s expert, Dr. Dippon, to submit their slides together with a summary of what in their presentations was new since their last expert reports by 15 January 2022 and 31 January 2022 respectively; and (iii) fixed 2-13 May 2022 for the Hearing, directed the Parties to submit a revised detailed hearing schedule by 17 December 2021, and a joint proposal concerning a venue for an in-person hearing by 31 January 2022. Further, the Tribunal directed that it would convene a CMC on 25 February 2022 to discuss with the Parties the format of the hearing and a Pre-Hearing Conference on 5 April 2022 to discuss any outstanding procedural matters related to the Hearing. The Tribunal reiterated that the hearing would proceed virtually by videoconference, should the public health conditions make it impossible or imprudent to proceed in person.\n\n113.\n\nPursuant to the Tribunal\u2019s directions in Procedural Order No. 6, on 4 January 2022, the Parties submitted two hearing schedules, one to be used in the event of a virtual hearing and the other to be used for an in-person hearing.\n\n114.\n\nBy the Parties\u2019 correspondence of 1 and 2 February 2022, the Parties advised the Tribunal that they had \"mutually identified Istanbul, Turkey and Lausanne, Switzerland as alternative venues [for an in-person hearing]\". The Parties advised that they were not aware of obstacles for either Party\u2019s counsel, representatives, witnesses, or experts to travel to Istanbul, Turkey; however, with respect to Lausanne, Switzerland, each Party might have members of their delegation who must request a visa and/or obtain a \"special necessity\" entry permission due to the type of COVID vaccine they had received.\n\n115.\n\nOn 5 February 2022, the Tribunal advised the Parties that it was prepared to proceed with the Hearing in person in Lausanne, Switzerland, and that it had instructed ICSID to place an enquiry with the Hotel Beau-Rivage Palace, the venue identified by the Parties, to confirm the dates and logistical arrangements for the Hearing.\n\n116.\n\nOn 15 February 2022, the Parties advised the Tribunal that they were in the process of exploring the availability of Swiss visas and entry permission under the \"special necessity\" exception for their witnesses and client representatives and proposed that the Tribunal consider Istanbul as an alternative venue in the event that it would not be possible to convene the hearing in Lausanne.\n\n117.\n\nOn 19 February 2022, the Tribunal rejected the Parties\u2019 proposal of Istanbul as an alternative hearing venue and ruled that, in the event that the Hearing could not proceed in person in Lausanne (e.g., because the hearing venue in Lausanne became unavailable or because participants were unable to attend in person), the hearing would proceed remotely on Zoom. On the same date, the Parties reiterated their request for the Tribunal to reconsider Istanbul as an alternative Hearing venue due to difficulties in obtaining Swiss visas for members of their delegations.\n\n118.\n\nOn 22 February 2022, in response to the Parties\u2019 request that the Tribunal reconsider Istanbul as an alternative hearing venue, the Tribunal reiterated its previous rulings of 5-19 February 2022, confirming that the Hearing would proceed in person in Lausanne and that the alternative to the in-person hearing would be a hearing by video conference on Zoom. The Tribunal invited the Parties to confirm the reservation at the Hotel Beau-Rivage Palace by 23 February 2022.\n\n119.\n\nBy its communication of 23 February 2022, the Claimant confirmed its agreement to proceed with the in-person Hearing in Lausanne, Switzerland, as directed by the Tribunal. On the same date, the Respondent advised that it could not commit to the reservation at the Hotel Beau-Rivage Palace given the uncertainties with securing visas for its witnesses, Party representatives, and Ashgabat-based counsel.\n\n120.\n\nOn 15 March 2022, the Respondent requested clarifications from the Claimant, specifically enquiring whether the Claimant had been affected by sanctions against Russia and whether it faced difficulties that would prevent the Claimant\u2019s participation in the forthcoming hearing as a result of the events in Russia and Ukraine, including obtaining visas, travelling to Switzerland for an in-person Hearing, and whether MTS would be able to pay for its travel costs, counsel fees, and any advances on costs to ICSID that may be required for the hearing or for the remainder of this proceeding.\n\n121.\n\nOn 16 March 2022, the Claimant submitted a response to the Respondent\u2019s request for clarifications, confirming that the Claimant had not been affected by sanctions against Russia and that Baker Botts LLP continued to represent MTS. The Claimant stated that, in light of recent events in Russia and Ukraine, the physical attendance of its witnesses and client representatives at the Hearing in Switzerland was \"very unlikely\" and proposed that the Tribunal, counsel and experts meet in person for the Hearing while the witnesses connect remotely.\n\n122.\n\nOn 17 March 2022, in response to the Parties\u2019 correspondence of 15 and 16 March 2022, the Tribunal informed the Parties that it was not opposed to the Claimant\u2019s proposal that the Hearing be conducted in a hybrid format with counsel and experts attending physically and fact witnesses connecting remotely, provided that any fact witness who could travel to Switzerland would not be precluded from appearing in person. The Tribunal instructed the Parties to confirm reservations at the Hotel Beau-Rivage Palace by 17 March 2022, in light of the urgency.\n\n123.\n\nOn 18 March 2022, the Respondent inquired as to the availability of ICSID\u2019s facilities in Washington, D.C., on the dates of the hearing, in order to avoid the high cost of renting the hotel venue in Lausanne, since the issue the Claimant had previously identified as an obstacle to a hearing in the U.S. i.e., the inability of the Claimant\u2019s Russian witnesses to obtain U.S. visas would be moot given the Claimant\u2019s proposal that all fact witnesses testify remotely. ICSID confirmed the availability of its Washington, D.C., facilities on the hearing dates. However, the Claimant objected to holding the hearing in Washington, D.C. The Tribunal reiterated its decision to conduct the hearing in Lausanne.\n\n124.\n\nOn 18 March 2022, each Party confirmed its agreement with the proposal that the hearing be conducted on the basis that the Tribunal, counsel, and the experts would attend in person and fact witnesses might testify remotely, provided that any fact witnesses who were able travel to Switzerland would not be precluded from appearing in person. The Respondent confirmed that its counsel and experts would attend the hearing in Lausanne and that it would confer with the Claimant regarding the attendance of each Party\u2019s fact witnesses.\n\n125.\n\nOn 31 March 2022, the Respondent asked the Claimant whether its witnesses or Party representatives had obtained Swiss visas to attend the Hearing in person in Lausanne. On 1 April 2022, the Claimant advised that it had not obtained Swiss visas for its witnesses or Party representatives. The Claimant further advised that it was still \"in the process of submitting visa applications with the Swiss consulate in Moscow for its witnesses/representatives who do not currently have a Schengen visa, and applications for entry permits (i.e., exemptions from the Swiss COVID vaccination requirements) for those who do...\" and that \"it is obviously not possible to predict whether the Swiss authorities will grant these visas/ entry permits\". The Respondent has also continued its efforts to obtain Swiss visas for its Turkmenistan-based witnesses and Party representatives, has not yet obtained the visas, and cannot predict if its efforts will be successful.\n\n126.\n\nPursuant to Section 19.1 of Procedural Order No. 1, a Pre-Hearing Conference between the Parties and the Tribunal was held by videoconference on 5 April 2022 to discuss any procedural, administrative, and logistical matters in preparation for the Hearing.

The Respondent cites *Joy Mining:* where the evidence shows that all of the claims are contractual, a finding that a tribunal lacks jurisdiction is justified; *Robert Azinian* v. *United Mexican States:* investment treaty arbitration is not intended to \"substitute for contractually agreed dispute resolution mechanisms [...] nor [...] elevate [...] ordinary transactions with public authorities into potential international disputes\".226\n\nResp.

The Respondent argues that it is not enough that the Claimant has attempted to characterize its claims as breaches of the BIT and the Tribunal \"is not bound by [the Claimant\u2019s] labelling\". It is rather for the Tribunal to \"determine the nature of the disputes objectively\".234\n\nResp. C-Mem., \u00b6 261.\n\n262.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, to demonstrate that claims fall prima facie under the BIT for purposes of jurisdiction, labelling the claims as treaty claims by the Claimants alone, is not enough and would reduce the \"inquiry to jurisdiction and competence ... to naught\".235 A treaty claim has to stand on its own and a contention that a violation of a contract \"constitutes in turn and by another name (figuring in the treaty) a treaty violation, [...] does not suffice to transform the contract claim into a treaty claim or to create a parallel treaty claim\".236 *Vivendi II* stated \"[...] where 'the fundamental basis of the claim\u2019 is the contract, however [] many more layers of claims one tops it with, it remains a contract claim, which has to be settled according to the terms of the contract and in the forum chosen in that contract\".237\n\nResp.

Rej., \u00b6 48.\n\nResp. Rej., \u00b6 48.\n\nResp. Rej., \u00b6 49.\n\n268.\n\nSecond, according to the Respondent, MTS\u2019 FET claim also essentially stems from the 2012 Agreement and the ancillary contracts. The Respondent points out that MTS itself alleges that the Respondent breached Article 4(1) of the BIT, the FET clause, by \"reneging on its specific undertakings in the contractual arrangements with MTS\" and identifies specific provisions in the 2012 Agreement that the Respondent allegedly breached which thus constitute the \"essential basis\" of this claim.246\n\nResp. Rej., \u00b6 54.\n\n269.\n\nThird, the Respondent argues that MTS\u2019 claim for violation of national treatment is based on the same facts as its FET claim, being \"inextricably linked to the determination of the contractual issues\".247\n\nResp. Rej., \u00b6 61.\n\n270.\n\nFourth, regarding MTS\u2019 argument that the Respondent breached its obligation to provide \"all necessary approvals\", the Respondent contends that this claim stems from the undertaking in the 2012 Agreement to provide MTS with \"all necessary legal and technical conditions of operation\" and is thus also an alleged contractual breach.248\n\nResp. Rej., \u00b6 62.\n\n271.\n\nFifth, the Respondent also contends that MTS\u2019 allegation of breach of Turkmenistan\u2019s duty to accord full protection to MTS\u2019 investment, is a contractual claim based on Turkmentelecom\u2019s decision not to renew the 2012 Agreement.249 Accordingly, the Respondent takes the position that all of MTS\u2019 alleged treaty claims are \"artificially repackaged\" breach of contract claims.250\n\nResp. Rej., \u00b6 63, 64.\n\nResp. Rej., \u00b6 66.\n\n**(2) The contracts provide dispute resolution provisions which must be honoured**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n272.\n\nMoreover, the Respondent argues, investment treaty tribunals cannot accept jurisdiction where a contract provides for a different dispute resolution forum, and were they to do so, such tribunals would \"subvert th[e] contractual certainty to the detriment of one of the parties\" rather than \"give effect to the collective will of the parties and the principle of *pacta sunt servanda\"*.251 By including an exclusive jurisdiction clause in a contract, \"there cannot be any doubt that [the investor] can renounce the right to arbitrate contract claims in a treaty forum\".252 Accordingly, the Respondent contends that the \"Tribunal must respect the forum selection clauses of all of the contracts at issue in this case\".253\n\nResp.

C-Mem., \u00b6 258.\n\n273.\n\nThe Respondent argues this is supported by decisions of other investment arbitration tribunals.254 For example the *\"ad hoc* Committee in *Vivendi v. Argentina* stated: '[i]n a case where the essential basis of a claim brought before an international tribunal is a breach of contract, the tribunal will give effect to any valid choice of forum clause in the contract.\u2019\"255 Also, in *SGS* v. *Philippines,* the tribunal \"underscored the need to give effect to the contractual choice of forum: \"[...] Tribunal agrees [...] that the general provisions of BITs should not, unless clearly expressed to do so, override specific and exclusive dispute settlement arrangements made in the investment contract itself\u2019 as this would give investors \"the hidden capacity to bring contractual claims to BIT arbitration\", a result that \"was [not] contemplated by States in concluding generic investment protection agreements\".256\n\nResp.

As such, in the Respondent\u2019s view, \"any claims arising under those contracts should be submitted to the contractually agreed forum\".261\n\nResp. Rej., \u00b6 35.\n\n276.\n\nAccordingly, the Respondent submits that the \"Tribunal must respect the forum selection clauses of all the contracts at issue in this case\" as investment treaty arbitration is not intended to \"resolve commercial contractual disputes, nor to substitute for contractually agreed dispute resolution mechanisms\".262\n\nResp.

The Claimant maintains that its claims are \"for breaches of [its] legal rights as a foreign investor under the BIT\", rather than claims for breach of contract. None of its BIT claims, it says, \"depends upon the assertion of any contractual right\".263\n\nCl.

THE TRIBUNAL\u2019S ANALYSIS AND CONCLUSION ON THE RESPONDENT\u2019S JURISDICTIONAL OBJECTIONS**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n292.\n\nThe Tribunal finds that it has jurisdiction over all claims asserted by the Claimant in this arbitration to the extent that these claims are treaty claims. The Respondent\u2019s jurisdictional objections are therefore dismissed.\n\n293.\n\nThe Claimant alleges breaches of its rights as a foreign investor under the BIT rather than claims for breach of contract. The claims as put forward by the Claimant arise pursuant to the BIT irrespective of the fact that they may also arise from a contractual investment framework.\n\n294.\n\nThe Tribunal observes, as a general matter, that a State\u2019s conduct can give rise to both types of claims, i.e., breaches of contract and treaty violations.\n\n295.\n\nIn this dispute, the Claimant does not complain of mere contractual breaches, but rather blames Turkmenistan for violating MTS\u2019 rights under the BIT. Whether Turkmenistan has actually breached any of the Claimant\u2019s rights under the BIT is a question pertaining to the merits, not jurisdiction.\n\n296.\n\nThus, the conduct of the Respondent in the performance of its contractual relationships with the Claimant can at the same time constitute an internationally wrongful act.\n\n297.\n\nBoth the Claimant\u2019s 2017 Shutdown Claims, alleging expropriation as well as breaches of further standards under the BIT (such as fair and equitable treatment, full protection and security, national treatment, and necessary approvals), and the Claimant\u2019s Historical Breaches Claims, alleging various breaches under the BIT (such as fair and equitable treatment, national treatment, full protection and security, necessary approvals as well as free transfer) during the period 2012-2017,294 are clearly treaty claims, not contract claims.\n\n*See* Claimant\u2019s Opening, p. 18; Cl. PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 10, et seq. (Shutdown Claims), 38, 40, 44, 48, 51, 56, 59, 62, 65, 68, 71 (Historical Breaches Claims).\n\n298.\n\nWhatever merit each of those claims may have, each is stated as a claim arising under the BIT, not under a contract. This Tribunal has no jurisdiction to adjudicate whatever contract claims the Claimant may have and will not attempt to do so.\n\n299.\n\nAll that is required to confer on this Tribunal jurisdiction to entertain the Claimant\u2019s treaty claims is for one of the Claimant\u2019s claims to arise under the BIT. The Claimant\u2019s claims all concern alleged breaches of the Respondent\u2019s obligations under the BIT in relation to an investment of the Claimant.\n\n300.\n\nAs far as the Respondent argues that contract claims are subject to the contractually agreed fora, the Tribunal finds that the Claimant\u2019s claims are treaty claims rather than contract claims. The Tribunal further finds that the fact that the 2012 Agreement provides for resolution of disputes arising under that contract by LCIA arbitration does not deprive this Tribunal of jurisdiction over alleged claims pleaded and arising under the BIT.\n\n**D.

If a dispute cannot be settled through negotiations within six months of the date of a written request from either party to the dispute for its settlement through negotiation, the dispute may be referred for resolution, at the discretion of the investor, to:  \n(a) a competent court of the Contracting Party in the territory of which the investments were made;  \n(b) the International Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes, established by the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States done at Washington on 18 March 1965 for settlement of disputes pursuant to the provisions of such Convention (provided that the Convention has entered into force for both Contracting Parties) or pursuant to the Additional Facility Rules of the International Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes (if the Convention has not entered into force for one or both of the Contracting Parties);  \n(c) an ad hoc arbitral tribunal appointed and functioning pursuant to the Arbitration Rules of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL).  \n3. The arbitral award rendered in a dispute pursuant to this Article shall be final and binding on both parties to the dispute. Each Contracting Party provides in its territory for enforcement of such award in accordance with its legislation. (Exhibit C-0001).  \nArticle 2(a) of the Additional Facility Arbitration Rules provides as follows:  \nThe Secretariat of the Centre is hereby authorized to administer, subject to and in accordance with these Rules, proceedings between a State (or a constituent subdivision or agency of a State) and a national of another State, falling within the following categories:  \n(2) (a) conciliation and arbitration proceedings for the settlement of legal disputes arising directly out of an investment which are not within the jurisdiction of the Centre because either the State party to the dispute or the State whose national is a party to the dispute is not a Contracting State; [...].\n\n302.\n\nThe Claimant submits that the Tribunal has jurisdiction over this arbitration pursuant to the BIT. According to the Claimant, the present dispute submitted to arbitration is a \"legal dispute arising directly out of an investment that is not within the jurisdiction of the Centre\"296 because the Claimant in this arbitration is a national of the Russian Federation and the Russian Federation is not a Contracting State to the ICSID Convention.297 It is a \"legal dispute\", as it concerns alleged breaches by the Respondent of its legal obligations in connection with the Claimant\u2019s investments and the Respondent\u2019s alleged obligations to compensate the Claimant for such breaches \"under the BIT and international law\", and it arises \"directly out of\u2019 investments made by the Claimant in the territory of the Respondent.298\n\nCl.

Mem., \u00b6\u00b6 348, 349.\n\n303.\n\nThe Claimant further contends that this Tribunal has jurisdiction over its claims because the Claimant is (i) \"a qualifying investor within the meaning of the BIT\"; (ii) \"has made a qualifying investment in the territory of Turkmenistan within the meaning of the BIT\"; and (iii) both Parties \"consented to submit the dispute to arbitration under the ICSID Additional Facility Rules pursuant to the terms of the BIT\".299\n\nCl. Mem., \u00b6 341.\n\n304.\n\nFirst, the Claimant asserts that it is \"a qualifying investor\" within the meaning of Article 1(a) of the BIT,300 because MTS is a company \"incorporated and constituted pursuant to the legislation of the Russian Federation\" which is a Contracting Party to the BIT and the Claimant \"owns, directly and indirectly, all of the shares in MTS-TM, a company organized under the laws of Turkmenistan\".301\n\nArticle 1(a) of the BIT provides: \"For the purposes of this Agreement the following concepts shall mean: (a) 'investor\u2019: any physical person that is a national of a Contracting Party pursuant to its legislation; any legal entity incorporated or constituted pursuant to the legislation of a Contracting Party\". (Exhibit C-0001).\n\nCl. Mem., \u00b6 342.\n\n305.\n\nSecond, the Claimant contends that it made a \"qualifying investment\" in Turkmenistan within the meaning of Article 1(b) of the BIT302 and within Article 2(a) of the Additional Facility Rules. That investment consists of shares in MTS-TM, rights to licenses, permits, land-use, property and other rights derived from contracts, capital contributions, funds and intellectual property rights. The Claimant says that the Respondent \"expressly acknowledged\" that the Claimant made an investment.303\n\nArticle 1(b) of the BIT provides:  \n(b) \"investments\" - all types of objects of civil rights which are invested by an investor of one Contracting Party in the territory of the other Contracting Party pursuant to the legislation of the latter Contracting Party and, in particular, but not exclusively: movable and immovable property and also property rights and other rights of monetary value; shares, contributions and other forms of participatory interest in the capital of commercial organisations, and also bonds; claims on funds invested to create economic value, or claims under agreements having economic value and relating to investments; exclusive rights to objects of intellectual property (copyright, patents, industrial designs, models, trademarks or service marks, technology, commercially valuable information and know-how); rights to conduct business granted pursuant to the legislation of the Contracting Parties or pursuant to agreements concluded in accordance with the legislation of the Contracting Parties including, in particular, rights in relation to the exploration, development, extraction and exploitation of natural resources.\n\nCl. Mem., \u00b6\u00b6 344-346.\n\n306.\n\nThird, the Claimant points out that the Parties consented to submit the dispute to arbitration under the ICSID Additional Facility Rules with Turkmenistan\u2019s consent expressed in Article 9 of the BIT and MTS having expressed its consent by filing a request for arbitration with the Centre on 27 July 2018.304\n\nCl. Mem., \u00b6 347.\n\n307.\n\nThe Respondent has not objected to the Claimant\u2019s assertions that it is an investor under the BIT, that it has made an investment in Turkmenistan within the meaning of the BIT and that both Parties have consented to submit their dispute to arbitration under the ICSID Additional Facility Rules in accordance with the tenus of the BIT.\n\n**(2) Tribunal\u2019s analysis and conclusions**\n-------------------------------------------\n\n308.\n\nThe Tribunal finds that the Claimant is indeed an investor within the meaning of Article 1(a) of the BIT. It is undisputed that MTS is a company incorporated and constituted pursuant to the legislation of the Russian Federation.\n\n309.\n\nThe Claimant has also made an investment in Turkmenistan within the meaning of Article 1(b) of the BIT. It is undisputed that the Claimant owns, directly and indirectly, all shares in MTS-TM, a company organized under the laws of Turkmenistan.\n\n310.\n\nFinally, the Tribunal finds that the Parties have consented to submit the dispute to arbitration under the ICSID Additional Facility Rules: the Respondent\u2019s consent is expressed in the standing offer contained in Article 9 of the BIT, whilst the Claimant gave its consent to submit the dispute to arbitration by filing its Request for Arbitration on 27 July 2018.\n\n311.\n\nAs regards the application of the Additional Facility Rules, the Tribunal notes that no objection has been made by the Respondent in that respect. In any event, the Tribunal finds that the Additional Facility Rules are applicable to this case as the present dispute is a \"legal dispute arising directly out of an investment that is not within the jurisdiction of the Centre\" within the meaning of Article 2 (a) of the Additional Facility Rules. The present dispute is a legal dispute concerning alleged breaches of the Respondent\u2019s legal obligations vis-\u00e0-vis the Claimant. The dispute also arises out of the Claimant\u2019s investment in Turkmenistan. The dispute is not within the jurisdiction of the Centre because, although Turkmenistan is a Contracting State to the ICSID Convention, the Russian Federation is not.\n\n312.\n\nIn sum, the Tribunal finds that the Claimant is an investor that made an investment in Turkmenistan, and the Parties have consented to submit the dispute to arbitration under the ICSID Additional Facility Rules.\n\n**VI.

THE PARTIES\u2019 POSITIONS**\n-----------------------------\n\n**(1) The Claimant\u2019s Position**\n-------------------------------\n\n313.\n\nThe Claimant, in response to the Respondent\u2019s assertion that MTS has failed to make a prima facie showing that the alleged measures were taken by MTS\u2019 Turkmen counterparties in the exercise of sovereign authority, argues that its claims are \"based upon internationally wrongful sovereign acts, not breaches of contract\".305 According to the Claimant, the conduct of its Turkmen counterparties can rise to the level of internationally wrongful acts and this arbitration is the proper forum to assess whether the actions of the Turkmen parties \"engage Turkmenistan\u2019s responsibility under the BIT\" as such an evaluation \"must be carried out under international law\".306\n\nCl.

Turkmentelecom plays a direct role in implementing the President of Turkmenistan\u2019s National Program under the supervision of the Ministry of Communications which determines the tariff rates; Turkmentelecom\u2019s role includes allocating and distributing data channel capacity in Turkmenistan, so much so that the Respondent admitted that internet access in Turkmenistan is entirely dependent on Turkmentelecom; Turkmentelecom is a de facto agent of the Ministry of Communications and Turkmentelecom\u2019s conduct is attributable to Turkmenistan under Article 4 of the ILC Draft Articles on State Responsibility (\"ILC Articles\").328\n\nCl.

As to the 2012 Agreement, it was entered into by Turkmentelecom pursuant to specific governmental authority granted by the President of Turkmenistan under Decree No. 12307 of 13 May 2012 \"with the view of fulfilling tasks defined in the National Program of Social and Economic Development of Turkmenistan in 2011-2030\" and the execution of the Decree was to have been supervised by the senior Turkmen Government officials mentioned in Article 3 of the Decree; the presence of the profit charge (i.e., a payment to the Government, as admitted by the Respondent) and a number of other contract terms in the 2012 Agreement (notably Clauses 6, 7, and 8) seek to implement sovereign communications policy, thereby showing that Turkmentelecom acted as an agent of the State and stood in the shoes of the Ministry of Communications when it signed the 2012 Agreement.330\n\nCl.

Rej., \u00b6 67.\n\nResp.

C-Mem., \u00b6 353.\n\n326.\n\nAccordingly, in the Respondent\u2019s view, MTS has failed to make even a prima facie showing that the alleged measures were taken by MTS\u2019 Turkmen counterparties in the exercise of sovereign authority and their actions are therefore not attributable to the Respondent under the BIT.345 First, MTS\u2019 claims arise under contracts to which the State of Turkmenistan is not a party.346 Second, most of the actions of which MTS complains were taken by Turkmentelecom acting as MTS-TM\u2019s contracting party, and that is relevant in particular in relation to the non-renewal of the 2012 Agreement.347 The fact that Turkmentelecom is entrusted with the public interest mission of satisfying all telecommunications demands of Turkmenistan or the fact that the conclusion of the 2012 Agreement was authorized \"[w]ith the view of fulfilling tasks defined in the National Program of Social and Economic Development of Turkmenistan in 2011-2030\" does not transform Turkmentelecom\u2019s conduct as a party acting under a contract into sovereign acts potentially giving rise to State liability for breach of a treaty.348 Third, MTS has failed to establish, even prima facie, that Turkmenistan somehow interfered in MTS\u2019 operations by acting beyond the scope of its rule as supervising authority in relation to the project as contemplated by Clause 8 of the 2012 Agreement.349\n\nResp.

TRIBUNAL\u2019S ANALYSIS**\n--------------------------\n\n327.\n\nThe Tribunal will now turn to the question whether Turkmenistan\u2019s and Altyn Asyr\u2019s conduct as alleged by the Claimant is attributable to Turkmenistan.\n\n328.\n\nThe Tribunal observes that the Claimant\u2019s claims are presented as falling into two broad categories: the 2017 Shutdown Claims and the Historical Breaches Claims.350 Under the Shutdown Claims, the Claimant relies on conduct by the Ministry of Communications, the Cabinet of Ministers, Turkmentelecom, and the Frequency Authority.351 In the context of the Historical Breaches Claims, the Claimant refers to conduct by the Ministry of Communications, Turkmentelecom, the Ministry of National Security, the Ministry of Economy, the Cabinet of Ministers, the Central Bank, and Altyn Asyr.352\n\n*See* below, Section VII. B. and C.\n\nCl. Opening, p. 18.\n\nCl. Opening, p. 18.\n\n329.\n\nThe relevant standard for attribution can be found in the ILC Articles. Article 4 of the ILC Articles353 deals with conduct of State organs and provides for a structural attribution test of acts of de jure or de facto organs of the State. Articles 5 of the ILC Articles354 deals with conduct by persons or entities that are not State organs, but that are empowered by the law of the State to exercise elements of governmental authority and includes a functional test on attribution. Finally, Article 8 of the ILC Articles355 deals with acts by persons acting under the instructions, or under the direction and the control of, a State and provides for a control-based test.\n\nDraft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts, International Law Commission (the \"ILC Articles\"), Exhibit C-0018, Article 4 provides:  \nConduct of organs of a State  \n1. The conduct of any State organ shall be considered an act of that State under international law, whether the organ exercises legislative, executive, judicial or any other functions, whatever position it holds in the organization of the State, and whatever its character as an organ of the central Government or of a territorial unit of the State.  \n2. An organ includes any person or entity which has that status in accordance with the internal law of the State.\n\nILC Articles, Exhibit C-0018, Article 5 provides:  \nConduct of persons or entities exercising elements of governmental authority  \nThe conduct of a person or entity which is not an organ of the State under article 4 but which is empowered by the law of that State to exercise elements of the governmental authority shall be considered an act of the State under international law, provided the person or entity is acting in that capacity in the particular instance.\n\nILC Articles, Exhibit C-0018, Article 8 provides:  \nConduct directed or controlled by a State  \nThe conduct of a person or group of persons shall be considered an act of a State under international law if the person or group of persons is in fact acting on the instructions of, or under the direction or control of, that State in carrying out the conduct.\n\n330.\n\nInsofar as the Claimant relies on the conduct of State organs and/or State agencies (the Ministry of Communications, the Cabinet of Ministers, the Ministry of National Security, the Ministry of Economy, the Cabinet of Ministers, the Central Bank, and the Frequency Authority), these can be considered (de jure) State organs whose conduct is attributable to Turkmenistan in accordance with Article 4 of the ILC Articles.\n\n331.\n\nWhat remains to be considered is the question whether the conduct of Turkmentelecom and Altyn Asyr is attributable to Turkmenistan. Whether the acts of Turkmentelecom and Altyn Asyr (as formally independent State-owned entities) may be attributed to Turkmenistan appears in fact to be the only relevant and contested issue regarding attribution.356\n\nClaimant's Opening, p. 22, 26.\n\n**(1) Turkmentelecom**\n----------------------\n\n332.\n\nAs regards Turkmentelecom, the Tribunal finds that Turkmentelecom is a de facto State organ (Article 4 of the ILC Articles), which fulfils governmental functions (Article 5 of the ILC Articles).\n\n333.\n\nThe Tribunal finds that there are several aspects to be considered in establishing whether Turkmentelecom\u2019s conduct can be attributed to the Respondent.\n\n334.\n\nHistorically, Turkmentelecom\u2019s predecessor was the Department of Intercity Communications at the Ashgabat Telegraph and Telephone Station of the Ministry of Communications, later named State Communications Company Turkmentelecom.357 Turkmentelecom was established in 1993 according to Order No. 49 of the Ministry of Communications as \"State Telecommunication Company 'Turkmentelecom\u2019 of Ministry of Communication of Turkmenistan\".358 According to its Charter, Turkmentelecom reports directly to the Ministry of Communications.359 Always according to its Charter, the General Director of Turkmentelecom is appointed and may be released by the Ministry of Communications.360 The annual profit plan is set and approved by the Ministry of Communications. Turkmentelecom holds itself out as part of the Ministry of Communications, including in its official letterhead, which mentions the Ministry of Communications upfront and sets out the Ministry\u2019s emblem.361 Turkmentelecom shares the same corporate headquarters in Ashgabat as the Ministry of Communications.362\n\n[REDACTED]\n\nCharter of State Telecommunication Company \"Turkmentelecom\" of Ministry of Communication of Turkmenistan, 27 December 2005 (\"Charter of Turkmentelecom\"), Article 1.1, Exhibit R-0138.\n\nCharter of Turkmentelecom, Article 1.2, Exhibit R-0138.\n\nCharter of Turkmentelecom, Arts. 13.2 and 13.3, Exhibit R-0138.\n\n*See* for example Letter No. 984 from Turkmentelecom to BCTI, 28 June 2005, Exhibit C-0043.\n\nThe address is 88, Archabil Avenue, Ashgabat. *See* Charter of Turkmentelecom, paragraph 1.9 as amended, p. 13, Exhibit R-0138, and, for instance, Letter No. 2501 from Ministry of Communication to MTS-TM, 12 November 2012, Exhibit R-0058. [REDACTED] confirmed in cross-examination that the Ministry of Communications and Turkmentelecom share the same building (Hearing Transcript, Day 7, 20:15).\n\n335.\n\nThe Ministry of Communications referred to Turkmentelecom as a \"subordinate enterprise\" in a draft agreement sent to MTS and BCTI.363 In the presidential decree authorizing Turkmentelecom to enter into the 2012 Agreement, Turkmentelecom is named \"Turkmentelecom of the Ministry of Communications\" which suggests that Turkmentelecom is a part of the MoC.364\n\nLetter No. 1551 from the Ministry to MTS and BCTI (enclosing new draft contract), 17 June 2010, Exhibit C-0077.\n\nRuling of the President of Turkmenistan No. 12307 \"On the development of cellular communication in Turkmenistan\", 13 May 2012, Exhibit C-0009.\n\n336.\n\nIn the negotiations for continuing operations in Turkmenistan in 2017, Turkmenistan was represented (jointly) by the MoC and Turkmentelecom. Furthermore, in making the decision not to extend the 2012 Agreement, Turkmentelecom stated that it took into account not only the amount of profit payments but also the public interest, in particular MTS-TM\u2019s alleged failure to provide sufficient mobile coverage in rural areas and to offer new communication services.365\n\nLetter No. 2492 from Turkmentelecom to MTS, 22 December 2016, Exhibit C-0016.\n\n337.\n\nThe Tribunal therefore finds that Turkmentelecom is a de facto State organ empowered to carry out and that actually carries out executive functions in the field of telecommunications in Turkmenistan, effectively as a department of the Ministry of Communications, and is for that purpose acting as a de facto organ of the State (Article 4 of the ILC Articles).\n\n338.\n\nIn any event, even if Turkmentelecom were not found to be a de facto State organ, the Tribunal finds that Turkmentelecom also exercises elements of governmental authority (Article 5 of the ILC Articles) in the telecommunications sector, in particular by controlling and allocating data channel capacity, which is a public resource. Furthermore, the 2012 Agreement was entered into by Turkmentelecom pursuant to specific governmental authority granted by presidential decree.\n\n339.\n\nWhether, for the purposes of Article 8 of the ILC Articles, the specific alleged acts were effectively performed as a result of the Ministry of Communications\u2019 instructions, direction or control does not require further analysis, given that the Tribunal has already found that Turkmentelecom\u2019s acts are attributable according to both Article 4 and Article 5 of the ILC Articles.\n\n340.\n\nTherefore, Turkmentelecom\u2019s conduct in dealing with the Claimant is attributable to the Respondent.\n\n**(2) Altyn Asyr**\n------------------\n\n341.\n\nThe Tribunal observes, as a preliminary point, that Altyn Asyr plays only a minor role as an alleged \"State actor\" in the Claimant\u2019s claims. The only alleged breach involving actions of Altyn Asyr concerns the alleged refusal of Altyn Asyr to provide sufficient interconnection channels.366\n\n*See* for example, Cl. Opening, p. 18; [REDACTED] \u00b6 30(e).\n\n342.\n\nAltyn Asyr, as a closed joint stock company, is the State-owned mobile operator in Turkmenistan. It is a legal entity separate from the State. Unlike its parent Turkmentelecom, which was formerly a department of the Ministry of Communications, and which carries out regulatory functions in the telecommunications sector, Altyn Asyr is first and foremost a commercial company and a competitor in the telecommunications market. Attribution of its acts and omissions is therefore less obvious than in case of Turkmentelecom.\n\n343.\n\nThe Claimant argues the following aspects to be particularly relevant with regard to attribution of Altyn Asyr\u2019s acts and omissions:367 Altyn Asyr was established and is owned 99% (directly and indirectly) by the MoC.368 The general director of Altyn Asyr is appointed by the MoC, Turkmentelecom, and a State-owned bank and the supervisory board is appointed by the MoC and comprises officials from the MoC, Turkmentelecom, and a State-owned bank.369 The annual profit plan of Altyn Asyr is set and approved by the MoC.370 The Claimant further argues that the profits of Altyn Asyr have been spent on presidential \"vanity projects\" (golf courses, theme parks, etc.).371\n\nCl. Opening, p. 22 and 26.\n\nCl. Opening, p. 22, referring to Corporate Charter of Closed Joint Stock Company \"Altyn Asyr\", 30 January 2013, Exhibit R-0139.\n\nCl. Opening, p. 22, referring to Corporate Charter of Closed Joint Stock Company \"Altyn Asyr\", 30 January 2013, Exhibit R-0139; Meeting Minutes No. 37a of Supervisory Board of Altyn Asyr, 6 April 2016, R-0162.\n\nCl. Opening, p. 22, referring to Approved profit plan for Altyn Asyr for 2017, Exhibit C-0598.\n\nCl. Opening, p. 22, referring to Meeting Minutes No. 37a of Supervisory Board of Altyn Asyr, 6 April 2016, Exhibit R-0162.\n\n344.\n\nThe Tribunal observes that Altyn Asyr acts as a commercial company and as a competitor in the telecommunications market, and does not, as its principal goal, exercise regulatory functions. Whilst Turkmentelecom also may act in the form of a private company, the Tribunal finds that Turkmentelecom\u2019s direct subordination to the MoC and its exercise of regulatory/governmental functions is clearer and much more prominent than is the case for Altyn Asyr. The fact alone that the Ministry of Communications and Turkmentelecom may have a certain general control over Altyn Asyr, following from Altyn Asyr\u2019s ownership structure, without any further indication of an integration into or a direct subordination of Altyn Asyr under the Ministry of Communications, does not turn Altyn Asyr into a (de facto) State organ. The Tribunal is therefore not satisfied that MTS has discharged its burden of proof in relation to the contention that Altyn Asyr is a (de facto) State organ within the meaning of Article 4 of the ILC Articles. Likewise, there is insufficient evidence to find that Altyn Asyr exercises governmental authority (Article 5 of the ILC Articles). In particular, the Claimant failed to state which elements of governmental authority (if any) were/are (allegedly) exercised by Altyn Asyr.\n\n345.\n\nFinally, as regards the question whether Altyn Asyr acted on the instructions of, or under the direction or control of Turkmenistan (Article 8 of the ILC Articles), the Tribunal observes that State ownership of an enterprise may be evidence of \"general control\", but the existence of a separate corporate entity may also create a presumption to the contrary. Rather, prima facie, the conduct of carrying out activities of a separate corporate entity may not be attributable to the State. State ownership is of course relevant, particularly if the State is the sole or a majority shareholder, but in this context, it is neither sufficient nor necessary to establish general control. A State may own a company but allow it to act independently in the pursuit of its business. Thus, the Tribunal considers establishing \"general control\" as a sole or majority shareholder to be only a first step. For the conduct to be attributable under Article 8 of the ILC Articles, the Claimant must also establish \"specific control\", namely that the specific acts alleged (and not the general operation of the company) were effectively performed as a result of the State\u2019s instructions, direction or control; whether or not that is an act that can be attributed to the Respondent will be examined more closely in the context of the Interconnection Claim.372\n\n*See* Section VII. C. (8) below.\n\n**(3) Conclusion on Attribution**\n---------------------------------\n\n346.\n\nTurkmentelecom\u2019s conduct relied upon by the Claimant is attributable to the Respondent.\n\n347.\n\nWhether Altyn Asyr\u2019s acts complained of in this case can be attributed to the Respondent will be finally decided in the context of the relevant claim (\"Interconnection Claim\").373\n\n*See* Section VII. C. (8) below.\n\n**VII. LIABILITY**\n------------------\n\n**A. THE RELEVANT STANDARDS OF PROTECTION UNDER THE BIT**\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n348.\n\nThe Tribunal will first provide an overview of the Parties\u2019 positions on the relevant standards of protection under the BIT before analysing the Parties\u2019 contentions bearing on liability.\n\n349.\n\nThe Tribunal has carefully taken note of the Parties\u2019 positions regarding the different standards of protection under the BIT on which the Claimant relies. The Tribunal does not need to decide on issues of law in the abstract. Only if and to the extent these issues become relevant in the context of the Claimant\u2019s specific claims will the Tribunal need to consider these issues further. The Tribunal therefore limits its comments on these standards to some general observations, reserving more detailed analysis for its discussion of the specific breaches alleged by the Claimant.\n\n**(1) Fair and Equitable Treatment (FET)**\n------------------------------------------\n\n***a. The Claimant\u2019s Position***\n--------------------------------\n\n350.\n\nThe Claimant argues that the Respondent breached the fair and equitable treatment (\"FET\") obligation set forth in Article 4(1) of the BIT.374 This provision states:\n\nEach Contracting Party shall ensure in its territory fair and equitable treatment of investments and returns of investors of the other Contracting Party relating to ownership, use and disposal of such investments and returns.\n\nExhibit C-0001, Article 4(1).\n\n351.\n\nThe Claimant argues that the FET standard is breached by:\n\n\u2022 frustrating an investor\u2019s legitimate expectations,375\n\n\u2022 by acting in an arbitrary, capricious, and discriminatory manner (including by acting in a manner contrary to the principle of legality),376\n\n\u2022 by acting in an inconsistent and non-transparent manner, and by failing to accord administrative due process,377 and\n\n\u2022 by failing to act in good faith towards the foreign investor.378\n\nCl. Mem., \u00b6\u00b6473, et seq.\n\nCl. Mem., \u00b6\u00b6 494, et seq.\n\nCl. Mem., \u00b6\u00b6 519, et seq.\n\nCl. Mem., \u00b6\u00b6 526, et seq.\n\n352.\n\nThe Claimant submits that the FET obligation requires the host State to protect the legitimate expectations of foreign investors and that this is a central element of FET which requires the host State to uphold undertakings, commitments, assurances and representations made to an investor and upon which the investor relied when making its initial investment or deciding on the expansion of an existing one.379 According to the Claimant, legitimate expectations can arise either as a result of specific commitments undertaken by the State towards the investor, or can also find their source in the investor\u2019s reliance on the stability of the general legal framework of the host State.380 Thus, in the Claimant\u2019s view, the host State\u2019s specific commitments, its regulatory framework designed to induce investment, and its conduct at the time of the investment are all factors that may give rise to legitimate expectations upon which the investor may reasonably rely in malting its investment.\n\nCl. Mem., \u00b6 473.\n\nCl. Mem., \u00b6 475.\n\n353.\n\nFor the Claimant, actions or omissions by the host State which frustrate the investor\u2019s legitimate expectations amount to a breach of the FET standard.381 The Claimant submits that situations which constitute a breach of the foreign investor\u2019s legitimate expectations include a failure to uphold repeated promises made to investors, interference with contractual arrangements, including through forced amendments; and dismantlement of the legal framework aimed at attracting the foreign investments.382\n\nCl. Mem., \u00b6 478.\n\nCl. Mem., \u00b6 479.\n\n354.\n\nThe Claimant further contends that the FET standard prohibits the host State from acting in an arbitrary, capricious or discriminatory manner.383 According to the Claimant, the FET standard also requires the State to act in a manner that is not \"arbitrary, grossly unfair, unjust, idiosyncratic, [or] discriminatory\".384\n\nCl. Mem., \u00b6\u00b6 494 et seq.\n\nCl. Mem., \u00b6 494, quoting *Rumeli Telekom A.S. and Telsim Mobil Telekomunikasyon Hizmetleri A.S. v. Republic of Kazakhstan,* ICSID Case No. ARB/05/16, Award, 29 July 2008, \u00b6609, Exhibit CL-0053.\n\n355.\n\nThe Claimant argues that the principle of non-discrimination also plays a role in the analysis of State measures in light of the FET standard and that discrimination is a significant element in determining whether the standard of fair and equitable treatment has been breached. The Claimant adds that discriminatory treatment is also prohibited under the national treatment provision in Article 4(2) of the BIT.385\n\nCl. Mem., \u00b6 501.\n\n356.\n\nThe Claimant maintains that the prohibition of arbitrariness and discrimination is an essential principle of the rule of law.386 Thus, the Claimant argues that \"[t]he corollary of the prohibition against arbitrary State action is the principle of legality\", which includes an obligation to apply domestic law. The Claimant concedes, however, that not every breach of domestic law would amount to a breach of the FET standard; only a qualified violation of domestic law would breach that standard.387\n\nCl. Mem., \u00b6 495.\n\nCl. Mem., \u00b6\u00b6 499, et seq.\n\n357.\n\nThe Claimant further argues that the FET standard prohibits the host State from acting inconsistently, non-transparently, and in violation of due process.388 According to the Claimant, the requirements of transparency, consistency, and due process are fundamental elements of the rule of law and are, therefore, constituent principles of the FET standard.389 In the Claimant\u2019s view, a breach of FET would result from the failure of the host State to accord the investor due process of law.390\n\nCl. Mem., \u00b6\u00b6 519, et seq.\n\nCl. Mem., \u00b6 519.\n\nCl. Mem., \u00b6 521.\n\n358.\n\nFurthermore, the Claimant identifies the duty of good faith, being an expression and \"part of the *bona fide* principle recognized in international law\", as an essential element of the rule of law and as another component of the FET standard.391\n\nCl. Mem., \u00b6\u00b6 526, et seq, quoting *Tecnicas Medioambientales Tecmed SA v. United Mexican States,* ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/00/2, Award, 29 May 2003, \u00b6153, Exhibit CL-0022.\n\n359.\n\nThe Claimant contends that Turkmenistan relies on the argument that the FET standard under Article 4(1) of the BIT should be limited by the Tribunal to the minimum standard of treatment under customary international law. The Claimant takes the view that the FET standard under Article 4(1) of the BIT is an \"autonomous\" standard, not limited to the minimum standard of treatment under customary international law.392 The Claimant argues that it is clear from the language of Article 4(1) that the autonomous treaty standard of \"fair and equitable treatment\" applies, not the minimum standard of treatment under customary international law. The Claimant maintains that Article 4(1) is not qualified by any reference to \"the minimum standard of treatment\", or to \"customary international law\", or even to \"treatment in accordance with international law\", i.e., by any of the forms of language sometimes used by States when they wish to limit the scope of FET protection to the minimum standard of treatment.393 The Claimant states it is the Respondent that bears the burden of proving that the language of Article 4(1) should be interpreted to mean something other than what it says.394\n\nCl.

Reply, \u00b6 485.\n\n360.\n\nThe Claimant takes the view that, even if the Tribunal were to accept the Respondent\u2019s argument regarding the minimum standard of treatment, the Respondent would still have breached its FET obligations under the BIT, arguing that the Respondent\u2019s mistreatment of the Claimant\u2019s investment was so egregious and so blatantly unfair and so evidently discriminatory that it fell short of even the minimum standard of treatment under customary international law.395\n\nCl. Reply, \u00b6 482.\n\n***b. The Respondent\u2019s Position***\n----------------------------------\n\n361.\n\nThe Respondent argues that the Claimant distorts the FET standard.396 The Respondent submits that the Parties disagree about the basic parameters of the FET standard to be applied in this case and that FET as protected by the BIT is equivalent to the international minimum standard of treatment in customary international law. According to the Respondent there is no justification for departing from the customary international law approach, especially since the Claimant can point to no evidence that Russia and Turkmenistan contemplated a broader meaning for the FET standard.397\n\nResp. C-Mem., \u00b6\u00b6 435, et seq.\n\nResp. C-Mem., \u00b6 436.\n\n362.\n\nThe Respondent states that FET was historically understood to be the same as the minimum standard of treatment,398 and that the practice of many States reflects the view that FET continues to be synonymous with the international minimum standard.399 The Respondent submits that, in 2001, the three State parties to NAFTA issued a joint interpretative note confirming that they intended the FET to reflect the minimum standard treatment required by customary international law. The Respondent states that many countries have adjusted their BIT practice in the wake of unjustifiably expansive interpretations by arbitral tribunals, to clarify that FET is intended to correspond to the minimum standard.400 The Respondent explains that the content of the minimum standard was famously set forth in *Neer v. Mexico,* which is widely recognized as the authoritative articulation of the minimum standard under customary international law:401\n\n[T]he treatment of an alien, in order to constitute an international delinquency, should amount to an outrage, to bad faith, to wilful neglect of duty, or to an insufficiency of governmental action so far short of international standards that every reasonable and impartial man would readily recognize its insufficiency.402\n\nResp. C-Mem., \u00b6 437.\n\nResp. C-Mem., \u00b6 438.\n\nResp. C-Mem., \u00b6 438.\n\nResp. C-Mem., \u00b6 439.\n\n*L. F. H. Neer and Pauline Neer (U.S.A.) v. United Mexican States,* General Claims Commission, Opinion, 15 October 1926, Reports of International Arbitral Awards, United Nations (2006), p. 61-62, Exhibit RL-0082.\n\n363.\n\nThe Respondent submits that any inquiry into an alleged breach of FET must take into account that a reasonable investor should be expected to have investigated the host State and its laws, and to have negotiated for any contractual provisions or other assurances it believes necessary to secure against excessive business risk. In the same vein, when an investor agrees to the terms of a contract, it must be deemed to have known and accepted the risks inherent in the contractual framework and the applicable regulatory environment.403 The due diligence and expectations of an investor will differ depending on whether it decides to invest in an advanced or a transitional economy. Where an investor, like MTS, decides to return to a country in which it has previously conducted business activities, its expectations should be informed by its prior experiences as well as by the tenus on which it re-entered that country.404 If the investor fails to carry out sufficient due diligence before it enters into a sector and jurisdiction, it assumes the associated risks and cannot then turn against the State to seek compensation if those risks materialize.405\n\nResp. C-Mem., \u00b6 443.\n\nResp. C-Mem., \u00b6 444.\n\nResp. C-Mem., \u00b6 445.\n\n364.\n\nThe Respondent maintains that the FET standard is not an amorphous point of entry for any complaint that an investor has against a host State or the investor\u2019s contractual counterparties in the host State. Rather, it requires a balanced analysis of the State\u2019s conduct and that of the investor, especially at the time when an investor entered into the country. It is not enough that a claimant should find itself in an unfortunate position as a result of its dealings with a respondent.406\n\nResp. C-Mem., \u00b6 446.\n\n365.\n\nAs regards legitimate expectations,407 the Respondent argues that the failure to respect an investor\u2019s legitimate expectations in and of itself does not constitute a breach of the international minimum standard. In other words, the FET standard does not protect legitimate expectations without more. According to the Respondent, not every expectation of an investor is protected; rather an expectation must be recognised and protected in international law.408\n\nResp. C-Mem., \u00b6\u00b6 449, et seq.\n\nResp. C-Mem., \u00b6 449.\n\n366.\n\nThe Respondent argues that, as far as the Claimant seeks to base its legitimate expectations on the stability of the general legal framework of Turkmenistan or on the terms of licenses issued by Turkmenistan and contracts concluded with Turkmen counterparties, a failure to observe these alleged expectations could not have caused a breach of FET, because legal and business stability is not part of the FET standard and expectations under commercial contracts are not protected under international law.409\n\nResp. C-Mem., \u00b6 450.\n\n367.\n\nAbsent a specific and unambiguous promise or guarantee on the part of the State at the time the investment is made - for example, in the form of a stabilization clause - the Respondent contends that an investor can have no legitimate expectation that the regulatory framework applicable to its investment will not change.410 The Respondent submits that legitimate expectations are only relevant to an FET claim if (a) the investor reasonably relied on a specific and unambiguous promise or guarantee by the State, (b) that reliance is assessed according to an objective standard, and (c) the State acted contrary to the specific and unambiguous promise.411 The Respondent further argues that, in the context of a contractual relationship, an investor\u2019s expectations are shaped by that relationship, and the investor will be subject to the law applicable to the contract and the jurisdiction of the contractually-agreed upon dispute resolution forum. Such an investor must accept the risks inherent in such a relationship and should expect, according to the Respondent, that its counterparty can exercise its contractual rights. From this, it follows that mere non-performance of a contract is outside the scope of the FET standard.412 In short, the Respondent contends, contractual breaches, not involving unilateral sovereign interference with contractual rights, are not violative of the FET standard.413\n\nResp. C-Mem., \u00b6 451.\n\nResp. C-Mem., \u00b6 452.\n\nResp. C-Mem., \u00b6 454.\n\nResp. C-Mem., \u00b6 456.\n\n368.\n\nInsofar as the Claimant alleges arbitrary, capricious, and discriminatory conduct and a lack of administrative due process, the Respondent argues that neither would amount to a breach of the FET standard. To establish a breach of FET because of an absence of due process or arbitrariness (which the Respondent defines as a wilful disregard of due process of law414), the Claimant must show at least a lack of due process leading to an outcome which offends judicial propriety.415 The Respondent emphasizes that the concepts of arbitrariness and due process as a part of FET do not convert any and every failure on the part of the host State to comply strictly with the requirements of its laws or regulations into a breach of international law.416 Thus, an ordinary failure to comply with a law or a contract is not sufficient for a finding of arbitrariness.417\n\nResp. C-Mem., \u00b6 462.\n\nResp. C-Mem., \u00b6 459.\n\nResp. C-Mem., \u00b6 460.\n\nResp. C-Mem., \u00b6 463.\n\n369.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, allegations regarding breaches of fair and equitable treatment by governmental bodies and administrative agencies need to be examined against the yardstick of a denial of justice, which is a component of the international minimum standard of treatment.418 The test for establishing an administrative denial of justice is an administrative irregularity that is enough to shock a sense of judicial propriety.419 The Respondent adds that a denial of justice claim requires exhaustion of local remedies as a threshold substantive requirement.420\n\nResp. C-Mem., \u00b6 467.\n\nResp. C-Mem., \u00b6 468.\n\nResp. C-Mem., \u00b6 469.\n\n370.\n\nInsofar as the Claimant refers to consistency and transparency in the context of FET, the Respondent argues that transparency, standing alone, is not a requirement of customary international law and thus does not form part of the FET standard. The mere fact that aspects of a State\u2019s legislative or regulatory framework are complex, the Respondent says, or may give rise to a level of uncertainty or ambiguity, a characteristic shared by most complex regulatory environments, cannot constitute a violation of international law. Very few countries can claim to be fully transparent in their regulatory decision-making and implementation process. An inflexible and unrealistic approach to these issues would in effect transfer the risk of operating in a developing country environment from an investor to the host State.421 The Respondent submits that the same applies to an alleged obligation of consistency that is also not a requirement of customary international law and that so far has not been accepted as part of the content of fair and equitable treatment with a sufficient degree of support.422\n\nResp. C-Mem., \u00b6 476.\n\nResp. C-Mem., \u00b6 477.\n\n371.\n\nRegarding the Claimant\u2019s reference to good faith in the context of FET, the Respondent argues that good faith is a well-established principle of public international law, but it is of no assistance in interpreting the standard of fair and equitable treatment. The Respondent submits that no tribunal has ever found a breach of the fair and equitable treatment standard by relying solely upon the principle of good faith. Under international law, the standard of proof for allegations of bad faith is demanding, requiring malicious intent to cause harm.423\n\nResp. C-Mem., \u00b6 478.\n\n372.\n\nIn its Rejoinder, the Respondent argues that the FET standard remains a high bar,424 and confirms its view that FET is equivalent to the minimum standard of treatment rather than an autonomous standard that goes beyond the minimum standard of treatment of customary international law.425 And even if the Tribunal were to apply an autonomous FET standard, the Respondent says, the threshold for finding a violation of that standard would be a high one.426 The Respondent argues that an inquiry into breaches of FET has to take into account the due diligence made and the risks accepted by a foreign investor in entering (re-entering in this case) a particular investment environment. When an investor agrees to the terms of a contract, it must be deemed to have known and accepted the risks inherent in the contractual framework. The Respondent contends that the due diligence and expectations of an investor will differ depending on whether the investor decides to invest in an advanced economy or in a transitional economy, in particular one in which it has operated in the past.427 The Respondent states that the Claimant agrees that no State should be held to a perfect standard of consistency and transparency, and that there should be some further margin of appreciation for developing countries such as Turkmenistan.428\n\nResp.

The Tribunal\u2019s Analysis***\n--------------------------------\n\n373.\n\nAs regards the FET standard, the Tribunal is not convinced by the Respondent\u2019s argument that the FET standard is identical with the minimum standard of treatment in customary international law. The Tribunal finds that if the parties to a treaty want to refer to customary international law, one would assume that they will refer to it as such rather than using the term \"fair and equitable treatment\" of investments, as the Parties to the BIT did in Article 4(1). The Tribunal further accepts that certain sub-categories of the FET, such as the protection of the investor\u2019s legitimate expectations, fair procedure and due process, non-discrimination and non-arbitrariness as well as the protection of the good faith principle (as an expression of the principle of good faith under international law), form in principle part of the FET standard.\n\n374.\n\nWhether the FET standard represents a high threshold (as argued by the Respondent) or not cannot be answered in the abstract and largely depends on the specific facts of the case, in particular on whether MTS has discharged its burden in relation to the alleged breaches.\n\n**(2) National Treatment (NT)**\n-------------------------------\n\n***a. The Claimant\u2019s Position***\n--------------------------------\n\n375.\n\nThe Claimant argues that Turkmenistan has also breached its National Treatment (\"NT\") obligation under Article 4(2) of the BIT. Article 4(2) of the BIT provides:\n\nTreatment specified in paragraph 1 of this Article shall be not less favourable than treatment accorded by the Contracting Party to investments and returns of investors who are its own nationals or to investments and returns of investors of any third State, whichever is more favourable in the investor\u2019s view.429\n\nBIT, Article 4(2), Exhibit C-0001.\n\n376.\n\nThe Claimant states that this provision of the treaty contains an NT obligation as well as an Most-Favoured-Nation (MFN) obligation and argues that NT and MFN provisions address nationality-based discrimination by requiring that foreign investors and investments receive no less favourable treatment than nationals or investments of the host State or third-party States. The Claimant states that both clauses protect foreign investments and returns from discriminatory treatment that puts them at a disadvantage compared to local investors, or investors-nationals of a third State.430\n\nCl. Mem., \u00b6 533.\n\n377.\n\nAs regards the NT obligation, the Claimant takes the view that the treatment of foreign investors must not only be \"fair and equitable\", but it must also be at least at a level playing field with the treatment of domestic investors (i.e., \"not less favourable than treatment accorded [...] to investments and returns of investors who are its own nationals\").431 Thus, the Claimant argues that the purpose of the national treatment obligation is to prohibit nationality-based discrimination by the host State between the host States\u2019 investors and investments and those of the other party to the BIT and to provide a level playing field between the foreign investor and the local competitor.432\n\nCl. Mem., \u00b6 535.\n\nCl. Mem., \u00b6 536, referring to A. Newcombe and L. Paradell, \"Law and Practice of Investment Treaties: Standards of Treatment\" (Kluwer Law International 2009), pp. 150-151, Exhibit CL-0064.\n\n378.\n\nThe Claimant explains that the NT standard sets a floor (treatment that is \"not less favourable\"), rather than a ceiling and therefore does not preclude the application of standards that are more favourable to foreign investors than those that apply to domestic operators.433 The Claimant further submits that the NT standard is a relative standard: it is defined by reference to treatment of other investments in a comparable setting.434\n\nCl. Mem., \u00b6 538.\n\nCl. Mem., \u00b6 539.\n\n379.\n\nThe Claimant further maintains that the impact of a measure on an investment is the relevant factor and that proof of discriminatory intent or motive is not required to trigger responsibility for breach of the NT standard. According to the Claimant, it is sufficient to show that the treatment accorded by the host State was less favourable to the foreign investor than to domestic investors in like circumstances. The Claimant adds that, where discriminatory intent is proved, it is relevant and may be sufficient to establish less favourable treatment.435 In the Claimant\u2019s view, the NT standard under the BIT is consistent with Turkmenistan\u2019s obligations under Turkmen law and the 2012 Agreement.436\n\nCl. Mem., \u00b6 541.\n\nCl. Mem., \u00b6 542.\n\n***b. The Respondent\u2019s Position***\n----------------------------------\n\n380.\n\nAs regards the legal standard of National Treatment, the Respondent argues that a State Party\u2019s obligations under BIT Article 4(2) are specifically limited to FET, which is the \"[t]reatment specified in paragraph 1 of this Article\". Thus, this claim is largely duplicative of the Claimant\u2019s FET claim.437 The Respondent notes that Article 4(3) of the BIT contains a reservation of rights by which the State Parties to the BIT Russia and Turkmenistan -allowed themselves the right to \"apply or introduce\" exceptions from national treatment, so long as the treatment is not applied on a discriminatory basis when compared to the treatment of investors of a third State.438 Article 4(3) provides:\n\nEach Contracting Party shall reserve the right to apply and introduce, in accordance with its legislation, exceptions from the national treatment envisioned in paragraph 2 of this Article with regard to investments and returns of investors of the other Contracting Party, provided that such exceptions are not applied or introduced on a discriminatory basis when compared to the treatment of investments and returns of investors of any third State.439\n\nResp. C-Mem., \u00b6 561.\n\nResp. C-Mem., \u00b6 562.\n\nBIT, Article 4(3), Exhibit C-0001.\n\n381.\n\nThe Respondent argues that this exception is a significant limitation on the State\u2019s obligation to provide \"no less favorable\" treatment to foreign investors than to nationals. It is a general reservation of the right to accord preferential treatment to national investors, not limited to any prescribed list of exclusions. The only limitations on this reservation of right for the State to accord more favourable treatment to nationals is to do so on a basis that does not discriminate as compared to investors of a third State, and to do so in accordance with its own laws.440 Even if the Claimant could prove preferential treatment, there would still be no liability under the BIT, due to the reservation of rights contained in Article 4(3).441 In order to sustain its claim, MTS would first have to establish that all of the elements generally required to determine a violation of national treatment obligations are met and then even if it could do so - that the \"exception\" to national treatment was not permitted under Article 4(3). That would require that the treatment alleged to discriminate against MTS be compared to the treatment of nationals of a third State. In the present case, since there was and is no investor in the cellular communications market from a third State, no such claim would be viable.442\n\nResp. C-Mem., \u00b6 563.\n\nResp. C-Mem., \u00b6 566.\n\nResp. C-Mem., \u00b6 567.\n\n382.\n\nThe Respondent submits that Article 4(2)\u2019s express reference to \"the treatment specified in Article 4(1)\" precludes the Claimant from making the same discrimination claims on two distinct legal grounds, FET and national treatment, thus avoiding the stringent requirements of the national treatment standard.443\n\nResp. Rej., \u00b6 358.\n\n383.\n\nThe Respondent argues that the Parties seem to be in general agreement as to the content of the national treatment standard. First, it is common ground between the Parties that Article 4(2) of the BIT protects against discrimination based on nationality. Second, it is undisputed that a comparative factual analysis must be conducted to compare the treatment of the foreign investor with that of Turkmen nationals in like circumstances.444 Accordingly, the test for determining the Claimant\u2019s claim under Article 4(2) of the BIT requires satisfying all three of the following: (i) The Claimant must prove that MTS was in like circumstances with Altyn Asyr, the national telecom operator; (ii) MTS must demonstrate that it received less favourable treatment from the State in respect of its investment, as compared to the treatment granted to Altyn Asyr; and (iii) The Claimant must prove that no exception is allowed under Article 4(3) of the BIT.445\n\nResp. Rej., \u00b6 359.\n\nResp. Rej., \u00b6 360.\n\n***c. The Tribunal\u2019s Analysis***\n--------------------------------\n\n384.\n\nAs regards the NT standard the Tribunal limits its analysis at this point to the observation that both Parties seem to agree that, to show discrimination against a foreign investor requires a showing that foreign and domestic investors are in like circumstances but are treated differently. As rightly observed by both Parties, there is an overlap with the FET standard which also covers instances of discrimination, due in part by the reference back to Article 4(1) of the BIT in Article 4(2) of the BIT.\n\n**(3) All Necessary Approvals**\n-------------------------------\n\n**a.** ***The Claimant\u2019s Position***\n------------------------------------\n\n385.\n\nThe Claimant argues that the Respondent has further breached its obligation under Article 3(2) of the BIT to issue \"all necessary approvals\".446 Article 3(2) of the BIT provides as follows:\n\nEach Contracting Party shall, pursuant to its legislation, issue all necessary approvals for the realization of permitted investments by investors of the other Contracting Party.447\n\nCl. Mem., \u00b6 552.\n\nBIT, Article 3(2), Exhibit C-0001.\n\n386.\n\nThe Claimant argues that Article 3(2) of the BIT confers an \"ancillary right\" upon the investor, once its investment has been admitted. The right thus conferred upon the investor is to receive the necessary approvals for the realization of its permitted investment. The Claimant believes this to be an obligation on the host State, as indicated by the mandatory wording in Article 3(2) (\"shall [...] issue all necessary approvals [...]\").448 The Claimant states that the term \"approvals\" in Article 3(2) of the BIT is sufficiently broad to encompass a wide range of Government-issued decisions, including authorizations, permits, licenses, consents, visas, and any other decisions signifying green light given by the Government.449\n\nCl. Mem., \u00b6 554.\n\nCl. Mem., \u00b6 557.\n\n387.\n\nThe Claimant argues that, even if the Tribunal were to attribute a narrower meaning to the term \"approvals\" in Article 3(2), MTS would be entitled to rely on the MFN clause in Article 4(2) of the BIT to import more broadly-worded provisions from other investment treaties entered into by Turkmenistan.450 In that context the Claimant takes the view that the normal effect of an MFN clause in a BIT is to widen the rights of the investor. The MFN clause serves, in particular, to import broader substantive protection standards, e.g., to clarify the meaning of words used in the basic treaty, or to import protection provisions which are absent in the basic treaty. In essence, the effect of an MFN clause is \"to raise the level of protection\".451\n\nCl. Mem., \u00b6 558, et seq. Article 4(2) of the BIT provides:  \nTreatment specified in paragraph 1 of this Article shall be not less favourable than treatment accorded by the Contracting Party to investments and returns of investors who are its own nationals or to investments and returns of investors of any third State, whichever is more favourable in the investor\u2019s view.\n\nCl. Mem., \u00b6 559.\n\n388.\n\nThe Claimant also takes the view that the assurance in Article 3(2) of the BIT that the necessary approvals will be granted is consistent with Clause 3.1 of the 2012 Agreement, which requires Turkmentelecom to provide MTS with \"all necessary legal and technical conditions of operation in the cellular communication market of Turkmenistan\" including \"additional technical resources\".452\n\nCl. Mem., \u00b6 562, referring to 2012 Agreement, Exhibit C-0008.\n\n***b. The Respondent\u2019s Position***\n----------------------------------\n\n389.\n\nInsofar as the Respondent refers to \"all necessary approvals\" in Article 3(2) of the BIT the Respondent argues that the Claimant cannot import provisions from other BITs to justify a wider understanding of the word \"approvals\". The MFN clause of the Russia-Turkmenistan BIT provides no basis for importation of substantive standards of treatment from other treaties.453 Article 4(2) protects against discriminatory treatment - specifically and exclusively with respect to the FET obligation set forth in Article 4(1) of the BIT - as compared to the treatment accorded to nationals of a third State.454 The express limitation of the MFN obligation to FET obligations defeats the Claimant\u2019s claim that it can \"import\" better standards on unrelated issues such as the \"approvals\" protections supposedly provided in other treaties.455\n\nResp. C-Mem., \u00b6\u00b6 610, et seq.\n\nResp. C-Mem., \u00b6 612.\n\nResp. C-Mem., \u00b6 613.\n\n***c. The Tribunal\u2019s Analysis***\n--------------------------------\n\n390.\n\nAs regards \"all necessary approvals\" in Article 3(2) of the BIT the Tribunal accepts the Respondent\u2019s argument that the Claimant cannot import provisions from other BITs to justify a wider understanding of the word \"approvals\". The MFN clause of the Russia-Turkmenistan BIT specifically and exclusively applies to the FET obligation set forth in Article 4(1) of the BIT and therefore does not apply to other issues such as \"necessary approvals\" contained in other provisions such as Article 3(2). The Claimant has not, in any event, identified a third-State treaty with Turkmenistan that contains more favourable terms.\n\n**(4) Full Protection (FPS)**\n-----------------------------\n\n***a. The Claimant\u2019s Position***\n--------------------------------\n\n391.\n\nThe Claimant contends that the Respondent has failed to accord full protection (\"FPS\") to MTS\u2019 investment and returns.456 Article 3(3) of the BIT provides as follows:\n\nEach Contracting Party shall guarantee in the territory of its state and in accordance with its legislation full protection of investments and returns of investors of the other Contracting Party.457\n\nCl. Mem., \u00b6 567.\n\nBIT, Article 3(3), Exhibit C-0001.\n\n392.\n\nThe Claimant argues that Article 3(3) captures not only \"investments\", but also specifically \"returns of investors\", which includes amounts yielded by investments and, in particular, profit, dividends, interest, royalties, licensing and other remuneration. The Claimant maintains that, although the wording of this provision (\"full protection\") differs somewhat from the more common wording found in other BITs (i.e., \"full protection and security\") the variation of language does not make a significant difference in the level of protection a host State is to provide.458\n\nCl. Mem., \u00b6 569.\n\n393.\n\nThe Claimant takes the view that the full protection obligation requires the host State to exercise reasonable care to protect covered investments; unlike most other investment treaty provisions, this provision requires the host State \"to protect investment against injurious action by private parties as well as by the State\".459 The Claimant argues that, traditionally, the full protection and security guarantee protected the physical integrity of investments against interference by use of force,460 but that this traditional view has evolved towards a broader standard not only including physical security, but also entailing an obligation to provide a stable business environment.461 Thus, the Claimant argues that the \"full protection\" standard in Article 3(3) of the BIT is properly understood as extending to the protection of the stability and physical, commercial, and legal environment of MTS\u2019 investment and returns, as well as protection against harassment (whether or not physical in nature). The Claimant submits that the broader interpretation is supported, inter alia, by the use of the word \"full\" protection in Article 3(3) and the definitions of investment and of returns under Article 1(b) and (c) of the BIT which include tangible and intangible assets.462\n\nCl. Mem., \u00b6 570, quoting United Nations Conference on Trade and Development. International Investment Agreements: Key Issues, UNCTAD/ITE/IIT/2004/10, Vol. I, 2004, p. 136, Exhibit CL-0029.\n\nCl. Mem., \u00b6 571.\n\nCl. Mem., \u00b6 572.\n\nCl. Mem., \u00b6 574.\n\n***b. The Respondent\u2019s Position***\n----------------------------------\n\n394.\n\nInsofar as the Claimant relies on the \"full protection\" standard in Article 3(3) of the BIT, the Respondent argues that the standard as proposed by the Claimant is incorrect.463 The Respondent argues that this obligation is one of conduct, rather than one of result, and requires only that the State exercise due diligence in affording protection to foreign investments and does not subject States to strict liability for any loss suffered by an investor. The essential question is whether the State exercised due diligence to the extent reasonable under the circumstances.464 The Respondent further argues that limiting the full protection standard to physical intrusions is necessary in order to maintain the distinction between this standard and other standards of treatment, particularly FET, and to prevent a blurring of these standards that would render them meaningless.465\n\nResp. C-Mem., \u00b6\u00b6 630, et seq.\n\nResp. C-Mem., \u00b6 630.\n\nResp. C-Mem., \u00b6 632.\n\n***c. The Tribunal\u2019s Analysis***\n--------------------------------\n\n395.\n\nThe Tribunal observes that the FPS standard is traditionally concerned with the physical safety of investments. The Tribunal finds that an interpretation of \"full protection\" in Article 3(3) BIT that goes beyond situations of physical safety and applies to stability of the business and legal framework of an investment would unnecessarily blur the boundaries between the FPS and FET standards. Hence, the Tribunal finds that the full protection afforded by the BIT is limited to situations in which the physical safety of the investment is concerned, none of which is alleged to arise in this case.\n\n**(5) Transfer of Funds**\n-------------------------\n\n***a.******The Claimant\u2019s Position***\n-------------------------------------\n\n396.\n\nThe Claimant claims that it has suffered from restrictions on conversion of manat into hard currency imposed by the Turkmen authorities and that Turkmenistan has an obligation under Article 7 of the BIT to guarantee unrestricted \"transfer of funds\" related to MTS\u2019 investments in the territory of Turkmenistan.466 Article 7 of the BIT provides:\n\n1. Each Contracting Party shall guarantee investors of the other Contracting Party, following their performance of all taxation and other liabilities envisioned by the legislation of the former Contracting Party, the unrestricted transfer abroad of funds related to their investments and in particular, but not exclusively:\n\n(a) initial and additional capital used to carry out or expand investments;\n\n(b) returns;\n\n(c) funds paid to redeem loans and credit recognized by both Contracting Parties as investments, and accrued interest;\n\n(d) funds received by the investor in relation to the full or partial liquidation or sale of investments;\n\n(e) funds received by the investor as compensation and indemnification for losses pursuant to Article 5 and Article 6 of this Agreement;\n\n(f) salary and other remuneration received by the investor and nationals of the other Contracting Party allowed to work in the territory of the former Contracting Party in relation to investments.\n\n2. Transfer of the funds specified in paragraph 1 of this Article shall be executed without delay in any freely convertible currency at the discretion of the investor at the market exchange rate applicable on the date of the transfer pursuant to the legislation of the Contracting Party in the territory of which the investments were made.467\n\nCl. Mem., \u00b6 578.\n\nBIT, Article 7, Exhibit C-0001.\n\n397.\n\nThe Claimant submits that the free transfer principle is aimed at measures that would restrict the possibility to transfer, such as currency control restrictions or other measures taken by the host State which effectively imprison the investors\u2019 funds, typically in the host State.468\n\nCl. Mem., \u00b6 580.\n\n398.\n\nThus, subject only to compliance by MTS and MTS-TM with tax obligations, Article 7 guarantees (i) the \"unrestricted transfer\" of MTS\u2019 funds related to its investments, (ii) without delay, (iii) in any freely convertible currency at MTS\u2019 discretion, and (iv) at the market exchange rate applicable on the date of the transfer pursuant to the Turkmen legislation.469\n\nCl. Mem., \u00b6 582.\n\n***b. The Respondent\u2019s Position***\n----------------------------------\n\n399.\n\nAs regards the \"transfer of funds\" under Article 7 of the BIT, the Respondent argues that the Claimant\u2019s claim regarding currency conversion is duplicative of its other allegations, such as FET.470\n\nResp. C-Mem., \u00b6 637.\n\n400.\n\nThe Respondent argues that the Claimant\u2019s theory under this latter provision of the Treaty appears to be that \"subject only to compliance by MTS with tax obligations\", it enjoyed the unrestricted right to transfer a wide range of amounts at whatever it claims to be the market exchange rate, and that for the Claimant this alleged right was breached by restrictions on conversions of manats into US$ allegedly imposed in early 2016.471\n\nResp. C-Mem., \u00b6 637.\n\n401.\n\nThe Respondent contends that Article 7 does not grant the Claimant the right to exchange its manat for whichever foreign currency it should wish to obtain, in whatever amounts it desires. It only provides that the \"transfer abroad\" of certain \"funds related to [...] investments\" will not be impeded. The Claimant has not identified any obstacles to the transfer of its money abroad per se. Rather, it appears to be complaining about the lack of US$ within Turkmenistan. Article 7 cannot be construed to guarantee the presence of sufficient US$ (or Euros, or Japanese yen, or pounds sterling) within Turkmenistan, but rather to govern the process by which such funds are transferred outside of the country.472\n\nResp. C-Mem., \u00b6 653.\n\n402.\n\nThe Respondent further submits that, apart from quantifying the \"stranded\" dividends in broad tenus, the Claimant has made no effort to identify the types of transactions that it alleges were prevented or rendered more difficult by Turkmenistan\u2019s alleged restrictions. Relying on *Continental Casualty Company v. Argentine Republic,* the Respondent argues that \"transfers related to an investment\" under Article 7 does not include \"merely a change of type, location and currency as part of an investor\u2019s existing investment [...] in order to protect them from the impending devaluation\".473\n\nResp. C-Mem., \u00b6 658, quoting *Continental Casualty Company v. Argentine Republic,* ICSID Case No. ARB/03/9, Award, 5 September 2008, \u00b6 241, Exhibit RL-0139.\n\n403.\n\nThe Respondent adds that Article 7 of the BIT does not guarantee MTS an absolute right to repatriate its profits. Rather, the Respondent has a sovereign right to implement legitimate and justified restrictions on the free convertibility of currency.474\n\nResp. Rej., \u00b6 446.\n\n***c. The Tribunal\u2019s Analysis***\n--------------------------------\n\n404.\n\nAs regards the \"transfer of funds\" the Tribunal observes that Article 7 of the BIT on the \"transfer of funds\" does not grant the right to exchange manats into any specific currency, but is rather concerned with the process of transferring funds out of the host State.\n\n**(6) Expropriation**\n---------------------\n\n***a. The Claimant\u2019s Position***\n--------------------------------\n\n405.\n\nThe Claimant submits that the \"forced shutdown of MTS\u2019 operations in Turkmenistan\" was an unlawful expropriation which violated Article 5 of the BIT. Article 5 of the BIT provides:\n\n1. Investments by investors of one Contracting Party made in the territory of the other Contracting Party and the returns of such investors shall not be directly or indirectly expropriated, nationalised or subjected to measures having effect equivalent to expropriation or nationalisation (hereinafter referred to as \"expropriation\"), except for cases where expropriation is carried out in the public interest, on a non-discriminatory basis, in accordance with the procedure established by the legislation of the latter Contracting Party, and is accompanied by the payment of prompt, adequate and effective compensation.\n\n2. The compensation specified in paragraph 1 of this Article shall amount to the market value of the expropriated investments and returns, calculated at the date directly preceding either the expropriation date, or the date when the impending expropriation became public knowledge, whichever is the earlier. Compensation shall be paid without delay in a freely convertible currency and, pursuant to Article 7 of this Agreement, shall be freely transferred abroad from the territory of the Contracting Party in which the investments were made. From the date of expropriation to the date of payment of compensation, interest shall be accrued at a commercial market-based interest rate, which shall not be lower than the six-month LIBOR rate in US dollars.475\n\nBIT, Article 5, Exhibit C-0001.\n\n406.\n\nThe Claimant argues that Article 5(1) of the BIT also applies to measures the effect of which is equivalent to expropriation.476 Article 5(1) of the BIT expressly contemplates that expropriation includes not only the direct taking of the foreign investment, but also indirect expropriation, i.e., \"measures having effect equivalent to expropriation or nationalization\".477 Thus, in the event of an indirect expropriation, the investor formally retains ownership of the investment but loses the ability to reap the economic benefits of that investment.478 The Claimant maintains that that the denial of a necessary license or permit for arbitrary or improper reasons may constitute an indirect expropriation if the result is the loss of the value of the investment.479\n\nCl. Mem., \u00b6\u00b6 594, et seq.\n\nCl. Mem., \u00b6 594.\n\nCl. Mem., \u00b6 598.\n\nCl. Reply, \u00b6 356.\n\n***b. The Respondent\u2019s Position***\n----------------------------------\n\n407.\n\nAs regards the Claimant\u2019s expropriation claim under Article 5 of the BIT, the Respondent argues that it is a fundamental principle that only property rights that exist and are enforceable pursuant to the law or contract under which they were created, may be expropriated: \"Conceptually, property can only be expropriated if it exists. If a right was never acquired or has been otherwise extinguished under local law, it cannot be expropriated\".480 In order to determine the existence and nature of the alleged rights at issue, the Tribunal must consider the underlying law and instruments under which the rights were supposedly created. Here, that means the terms of the 2012 Agreement, governed by English law, and the framework of law and regulations applicable to the telecommunications sector in Turkmenistan.481\n\nResp. C-Mem., \u00b6 356, quoting A. Newcombe and L. Paradell, Law and Practice of Investment Treaties: Standards of Treatment (Kluwer Law International 2009), \u00b6 7.19, Exhibit CL-0064.\n\nResp. C-Mem., \u00b6 360.\n\n***c. The Tribunal\u2019s Analysis***\n--------------------------------\n\n408.\n\nAs regards expropriation, the Tribunal notes that there is not much debate between the Parties regarding the general concept of indirect expropriation under the BIT. Thus, the Tribunal limits itself to the general observation that a (property) right can only be expropriated if it exists; if a right was never acquired or has been extinguished, it cannot be expropriated either directly or indirectly.\n\n409.\n\nThe Claimant\u2019s claims are presented in two separate parts: the 2017 Shutdown Claims (B.) and the Historical Breaches Claims (C.). The Tribunal will deal with each of them in turn.\n\n**B. THE CLAIMANT\u2019S 2017 SHUTDOWN CLAIMS**\n------------------------------------------\n\n410.\n\nThe Claimant\u2019s 2017 Shutdown Claims consist of a \"Primary Case\" and an \"Alternative Case\".482\n\nCl. PHB, \u00b6 10, \u00b6\u00b6 13, et seq., \u00b6\u00b6 27, et seq.\n\n411.\n\nOn each case, the Claimant seeks to recover for the loss of its investment in MTS-TM as a result of the shutdown of its operations in 2017, which in the Claimant\u2019s view constituted an unlawful expropriation in violation of Article 5(1) of the BIT. In addition to constituting an unlawful expropriation, the Claimant argues that the 2017 shutdown of MTS-TM was equally a breach of (i) the Respondent\u2019s fair and equitable treatment (\"FET\") obligations under Article 4(1) of the BIT, (ii) the Respondent\u2019s national treatment (\"NT\") obligations under Article 4(2) of the BIT, (iii) the Respondent\u2019s full protection and security (\"FPS\") obligations under Article 3(3) of the BIT, and (iv) the Respondent\u2019s obligation to provide \"all necessary approvals for the realisation of permitted investments\" under Article 3(2) of the BIT.483\n\nCl. PHB, \u00b6 11.\n\n412.\n\nUnder its \"Primary Case\" the Claimant argues that the Respondent expropriated the Claimant\u2019s investment in Turkmenistan when it shut down MTS-TM\u2019s network on 29 September 2017 on the basis that MTS no longer had the right to operate in Turkmenistan following the expiry of the 2012 Agreement.484 The Claimant argues that the 2012 Agreement was not a legal prerequisite for MTS-TM to operate (or continue operating) in Turkmenistan and that the Respondent had no right to shut down MTS\u2019 operations on the basis that the 2012 Agreement had expired.485 The Claimant further submits that the 2012 Agreement was illegal (and therefore invalid) on the basis that the profit charge was illegal and that MTS was coerced into agreeing to it. In the Claimant\u2019s view, its license was a sufficient legal basis for its operations in Turkmenistan. At the time of the 2017 shutdown, the Claimant says, MTS-TM was in possession of a valid license with a commitment from the MoC to a minimum 10-year operating term. MTS\u2019 right to further operate in Turkmenistan was, it says, expropriated by the Respondent (along with the value of MTS\u2019 business) when it shut down MTS-TM\u2019s network on 29 September 2017 on the basis that this was justified by the expiry of the 2012 Agreement.486\n\nCl.

PHB, \u00b6 14.\n\n416.\n\nThe Claimant submits that the Respondent\u2019s argument whereby MTS-TM had no right to conduct any operations in the country as a cellular communications services provider without the 2012 Agreement has no basis.492 The Claimant contends that the 2012 Agreement was not only devoid of any legal basis under the laws of Turkmenistan, but also violated (i) the BIT (which requires Turkmenistan to admit foreign investments in accordance with its legislation), (ii) the Constitution of Turkmenistan (which provides that taxes and other mandatory payments to the Turkmen Government must be determined in accordance with law), and (iii) Turkmen domestic law (including the Law on Foreign Investments, which guarantees foreign investors\u2019 right to freely use their income and profits after payment of taxes and other obligatory charges provided for by the laws of Turkmenistan).493 As the 2012 Agreement had no basis in Turkmen law, then it cannot have been a legal prerequisite for MTS\u2019 operations.494\n\nCl.

PHB, \u00b6 15.\n\n417.\n\nAs regards the Respondent\u2019s argument that the 2012 Agreement was a \"framework agreement\" without which MTS-TM had no right to access State resources, the Claimant argues that the 2012 Agreement was not a legal or practical requirement for the provision of any State resources to MTS-TM. MTS-TM applied for, contracted for, and paid for all of the resources it required to operate its network independently of the 2012 Agreement, in most cases not even from Turkmentelecom. The Respondent\u2019s repeated, self-serving reference to agreements such as the Radio Frequency Agreement and the Interconnection Agreements as \"ancillary agreements\" to the 2012 Agreement is wrong. Not only were these agreements not legally conditioned in any way upon the existence of the 2012 Agreement, but not one of them even mentioned the 2012 Agreement. That the 2012 Agreement was not a \"framework agreement\" required for MTS-TM to access State resources is conclusively established by the fact that Altyn Asyr obtained licenses and access to all the State resources it required without ever being required to enter into an agreement equivalent to the 2012 Agreement.495 MTS-TM lost its access to State resources in September 2017 not because the 2012 Agreement expired, but because the Respondent took them away on the wrongful basis that MTS-TM had no legal entitlement to operate in Turkmenistan without the 2012 Agreement. According to the Claimant, this conduct was expropriatory, as well as a breach of the FET, NT and FPS standards, and a breach of the Respondent\u2019s obligation to provide the Claimant with \"all necessary approvals\" for the realisation of its investment.496\n\nCl. Reply PHB, \u00b6 8.\n\nCl. Reply PHB, \u00b6 9.\n\n418.\n\nMoreover, the Claimant takes the view that the 2012 Agreement was illegal (and therefore invalid) due to coercion and because the profit charge was itself illegal. The Claimant argues that Turkmenistan coerced MTS into signing the 2012 Agreement and that cannot transform the 2012 Agreement into a lawful prerequisite for MTS to operate (or continue operating) in Turkmenistan. According to the Claimant, the Respondent cannot rely on the proposition that an investor can be estopped from challenging the illegality of a State\u2019s conduct under a BIT.497 Even if such were the case (quod non), the elements of estoppel under international law are not met in this case because MTS did not \"freely\" enter into the 2012 Agreement.498 The Claimant contends that in circumstances where it is common ground that MTS was given no choice by the Respondent but to sign the 2012 Agreement if it wished to return to Turkmenistan, it is unclear how the Respondent can still claim that MTS \"freely\" entered into the 2012 Agreement and is estopped from denying the legality of said Agreement.499 The Claimant denies the Respondent\u2019s assertion that the Claimant has \"failed to satisfy the high standard of proving economic duress and causation under English law\".500 The Claimant rebuts that it has never made any claim that the 2012 Agreement was void for economic duress under English law, and that it is the Claimant\u2019s case that the Respondent\u2019s insistence on profit-sharing as a condition of the Claimant\u2019s operations in Turkmenistan violated international law (i.e., the BIT) as well as Turkmen law.501\n\nCl.

The Claimant states that its claims \"arise (a) in relation to the 2017 shutdown, from the Respondent\u2019s unlawful insistence in 2017 on an extension of the 2012 Agreement as a condition of MTS\u2019 continued operations in Turkmenistan, and (b) in relation to the Profit Charge as an Unlawful Measure, on the Respondent\u2019s unlawful extraction of [REDACTED] in 2012. According to the Claimant, neither of these acts occurred prior to the effective date of the Settlement Agreement as the 2012 Agreement did not even enter into force until 28 September 2012, months *after* the effective date of the Settlement Agreement (25 July 2012). The Claimant states that, before that time, it had no justiciable claim against the Respondent that was capable of being waived.502\n\nCl. Sur-Reply PHB, p. 1.\n\n420.\n\nWith regard to the Respondent\u2019s argument that the Claimant\u2019s witnesses confirmed the significance of, and need to extend, the 2012 Agreement and recognized that an extension of the 2012 Agreement was necessary to continue their operations in Turkmenistan, the Claimant replies that this is false and that the evidence of the Claimant\u2019s witnesses has been clear and consistent to the effect that they never understood the 2012 Agreement to be a prerequisite for MTS\u2019 operations in Turkmenistan. The Claimant also rejects the Respondent\u2019s point that the Respondent \"did not say that the 2012 Agreement 'had no basis in Turkmen law\u2019 at the hearing\", pointing out that the Respondent\u2019s counsel did expressly state at the Hearing that \"it would be nice if the law said, 'You have to have this particular framework agreement\u2019, but it\u2019s not established in the law\".

Sur-Reply PHB, p. 1.\n\n421.\n\nIn the Claimant\u2019s view, its license was a sufficient legal basis for its operations in Turkmenistan.504 The Ministry of Communications granted MTS-TM a first license (No. 1- 20-21-40) on 26 July 2012 for a period ending on 26 July 2015,505 and then renewed the license for a period ending on 26 July 2018.506 At the time of the 2017 shutdown, MTS-TM was therefore in possession of a valid operating license with a commitment from the Ministry of Communications to a minimum 10-year operating term. MTS-TM\u2019s right to operate pursuant to its license - an intangible property right protected under both Turkmen law and the BIT - was expropriated by the Respondent (along with the value of MTS-TM\u2019s business) when it shut down MTS-TM\u2019s network on 29 September 2017 on the wrongful basis that this was justified by the expiry of the 2012 Agreement.507\n\nCl.

The Claimant further argues that the Respondent cannot explain how its translation of that phrase (\"is to be\") is capable of actually meaning \"may be\".512 As regards the Respondent\u2019s view that the \"3+2+3+2\" does not constitute an agreement, the Claimant disagrees, arguing that the provision was proposed by the Ministry of Communications itself, it was negotiated between the parties\u2019 lawyers and was printed on the back of MTS-TM\u2019s license; it was signed and sealed by [REDACTED], separately from the front page of the license.513\n\nCl.

The Claimant also argues that even if MTS-TM had not held a vested contractual right in September 2017 to a five-year extension of its Radio Frequency Spectrum Agreement, its Interconnection Agreements and its leases of State property (quod non), it was incumbent upon Turkmenistan to ensure that MTS-TM could reasonably access the State resources it required to operate for the duration of its license, both as a matter of fair and equitable treatment and because Article 3(2) of the BIT expressly requires Turkmenistan to provide \"all necessary approvals for the realisation of permitted investments\".517\n\nCl.

The Claimant further submits that Turkmenistan\u2019s refusal to extend the 2012 Agreement was based on an improper motive (i.e., financial extortion).519\n\nCl. PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 27, et seq.\n\nCl.

PHB, \u00b6 27, FN 104.\n\n427.\n\nThe Claimant submits that it is well-established in international case law that a State\u2019s refusal to grant or extend a necessary license or permit for arbitrary, unjustified or improper reasons may constitute an indirect expropriation if the result of such refusal is the loss of the investor\u2019s investment. Thus, if the 2012 Agreement were to be considered a legal prerequisite for MTS-TM\u2019s operations in Turkmenistan (quod non), then the Respondent expropriated MTS\u2019 investment in violation of Article 5(1) of the BIT by refusing to extend the 2012 Agreement beyond September 2017 without any reasonable justification, and in violation of MTS\u2019 legitimate expectation to operate in Turkmenistan for a period of at least 10 years, and at the same time the Respondent breached the FET, NT, \"all necessary approvals\" and FPS standards under Articles 4(1), 4(2), 3(2) and 3(3) of the BIT.521\n\nCl. PHB, \u00b6 31.\n\n***b. The Respondent\u2019s Position***\n----------------------------------\n\n428.\n\nThe Respondent argues that the Claimant had no right or expectation to renew the 2012 Agreement for a second five-year term or to continue operating in Turkmenistan after its expiration.522\n\nResp. PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 5, et seq.\n\n429.\n\nThe Respondent states that the evidence shows that MTS had no right or expectation to renew the 2012 Agreement for a second 5-year term in 2017, and certainly not to continue operating in Turkmenistan in perpetuity.523\n\nResp. PHB, \u00b6 5.\n\n430.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the express terms of the 2012 Agreement regarding duration and renewal are clear and were the result of negotiation.524 The 2012 Agreement was extensively negotiated by the parties, with almost 20 drafts exchanged over the course of at least ten months, from August 2011 to the time when it was finally signed on 24 May 2012. The final version of the contract includes a provision on its duration and a possibility of its renewal in Clause 18.525 The Respondent states that in the original drafts of the contract, MTS had attempted to obtain a longer term, first proposing 20 years, and then 10 years, as well as proposing mandatory language of extension, specifically, the phrase \"shall be extended\". The Respondent submits that the Claimant failed to obtain such terms and that the parties expressly agreed to a 5-year term. Rather than including mandatory language of extension as MTS sought, Clause 18 contains the permissive language \"may be extended\".526 There can be no dispute that the 2012 Agreement only provides for a 5-year term, and that it does not provide for mandatory renewal.527 The Claimant understood that Clause 18 provided Turkmentelecom complete discretion regarding the extension or non-extension of the Agreement. MTS\u2019 contemporaneous public filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) reported that the 2012 Agreement was to expire in five years and did not assert that there was an automatic right to extend or that MTS could continue operating in Turkmenistan after the 5-year term. The Respondent contends that Turkmentelecom had an absolute right to decide not to renew the 2012 Agreement. Moreover, MTS has never established that the decision not to extend that contract was arbitrary or lacking any reasons.528 The Respondent cites several reasons for the non-renewal of the 2012 Agreement, such as the need to develop the telephone and cellular communication in rural areas in Turkmenistan, the need for all operators to take part in the communication development program, the fact that the Claimant did not roll out any new technology and that the profit payments under the 2012 Agreement had declined and failed to meet expectations.529\n\nResp.

PHB, \u00b6 10.\n\n431.\n\nThe Respondent argues that the Claimant\u2019s contention that it was economically coerced into signing the 2012 Agreement is untenable. First, the Respondent submits that it is undisputed that the 2012 Agreement was heavily and freely negotiated by the parties, over at least 10 months, with counsel on both sides, and that the Claimant was assisted by experienced international counsel in 2012, just as it was when it acquired BCTI\u2019s rights under the 1994 Agreement and entered into the 2005 Agreement.530 Second, the Respondent asserts that the profit-sharing terms in the 2012 Agreement were not new to the Claimant as the Claimant had always operated under profit-sharing terms in its prior agreements, since it first entered Turkmenistan in 2005.531 Third, the Respondent contends that just as with the 2012 Agreement, after performing the 2005 Agreement for its full 5-year term, the Claimant itself sought to renew it on the same terms, including profit-sharing.532 Fourth, the Respondent maintains that the Claimant never complained that the profit-sharing terms of the 2005 and the 2012 Agreements were \"illegal\" in any way, either when they were being negotiated or during the entire course of their performance, nor did the Claimant make any such argument in the 2011 arbitrations. The Respondent states that, contrary to the instructions the Claimant gave to its quantum expert in this arbitration, it instructed the same expert in the 2011 arbitrations, Ms. Laura Hardin, to give full force and effect to the profit-sharing terms of the 2005 Agreement, deducting the [REDACTED] that MTS owed to Turkmenistan in her calculations. The Respondent further argues that, if the Tribunal accepted the Claimant\u2019s premise that the 2012 Agreement was unlawful ab initio, MTS would have no right to bring claims under the BIT for damages arising out of an illegal contractual arrangement, and the Tribunal would have to dismiss the claims on that basis alone.533\n\nResp.

Reply PHB, \u00b6 12.\n\n432.\n\nAs regards the \"note\" on the back of the 2012 license on which the Claimant relies, the Respondent argues that this does not override all of the Claimant\u2019s signed, written contracts nor does it entitle the Claimant to operate in Turkmenistan for ten years. The note on the back of the license that Claimant obtained from the Ministry of Communications in July 2012 did not give the Claimant legitimate expectations of continuing to operate after the 2012 Agreement expired. There is no documentary evidence supporting the Claimant\u2019s interpretation of the note; neither its literal meaning nor the context of the parties\u2019 negotiations support the Claimant\u2019s argument that the note was a legally binding commitment to guarantee the Claimant ten years of operations in Turkmenistan.534 The entire documentary record contradicts that argument. On its face, the plain meaning of the note does not purport to override the terms of the 2012 Agreement or any of the ancillary agreements (Interconnection Agreements and Radio Frequency Agreement), which established the rights, conditions of operations and technical resources that MTS required in order to conduct operations as a cellular services provider in Turkmenistan. It is undisputed that the license was issued in the Turkmen language only, and that the note on the back of the license was also written in Turkmen only. The Respondent\u2019s certified English translation of the Turkmen text of the note states: \"is to be extended according to the procedure set forth by the legislation of Turkmenistan\". The Respondent submits that this is not mandatory language.535 Consequently, the note does not constitute an agreement as the Claimant contends.536\n\nResp. PHB, \u00b6 13.\n\nResp. PHB, \u00b6 14.\n\nResp. PHB, \u00b6 17.\n\n433.\n\nThe Respondent argues that there is no dispute that, under all translations of the note, the text expressly states that any extensions of the license would be made according to Turkmen law and procedure. Under the Turkmen Law on Licensing, MTS had to maintain the technical resources and means necessary to carry out the licensed activity resources and means that were afforded to MTS by virtue of the 2012 Agreement, and the ancillary agreements. Once those contracts expired, MTS no longer possessed the means necessary to carry out the licensed activities. The license alone was useless. The express language of the note - which qualifies the possibility of renewal by the phrase \"according to the procedure set forth by the legislation of Turkmenistan\" - undercuts the Claimant\u2019s theory that the note superseded the carefully negotiated 5-year term of the 2012 Agreement and guaranteed MTS the right to operate in Turkmenistan for 10 years.537\n\nResp. PHB, \u00b6 18.\n\n434.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the Claimant\u2019s contemporaneous behaviour also undercuts its argument. The Claimant cannot explain why it applied for a 3-year license in 2015, when the supposedly \"binding\" agreement provided only for a two-year renewal after the first three years (\"3+2+3+2\"). Apparently, neither MTS nor the Ministry felt compelled to comply with the \"formula\" in the note on the 2012 license, and there is no reference to the note, the formula, or to any further extensions on the license that was issued to the Claimant in 2015.538\n\nResp. PHB, \u00b6 19.\n\n435.\n\nThe Respondent maintains that the note simply could not supersede the terms of the extensively negotiated 2012 Agreement and ancillary agreements. Rather, the note indicated that the license would run in parallel with the Claimant\u2019s contractual framework. The purpose of having two \"3+2\" combinations was to mimic the initial 5-year term of the 2012 Agreement and the possibility of a subsequent 5-year term. At the Hearing, the Respondent\u2019s witness [REDACTED] in the period from February 2012 to January 2019, explained that the note was included on the back of the 2012 license as a way to assuage the Claimant that it would be able to renew and maintain communications licenses for the entire 5-year duration of the 2012 Agreement - given the fact that the Law on Licensing only provided for a maximum 3-year duration for licenses - and that the same procedure would apply if the 2012 Agreement was renewed for another five years.539\n\nResp. PHB, \u00b6 20.\n\n436.\n\nThe Respondent takes the view that the residual term of the 2015 License did not afford the Claimant greater rights than it had under the 2012 Agreement and ancillary agreements and had no practical effect after its contracts expired. Contrary to the Claimant\u2019s contentions, the license issued to MTS in July 2015, standing alone, did not constitute a \"protected property right\" that was expropriated when its contracts expired and it ceased operations in September 2017.540 At the Hearing, Mr. Townsend asked whether the cessation of activity ten months before the license expired amounted to a taking of some right from the Claimant.541 The Respondent\u2019s answer was no. The Respondent submits that MTS ceased activities at the end of September 2017, because the contractual framework under which it conducted operations as a cellular services provider in Turkmenistan expired. The 3-year communications license issued to MTS in July 2015 was not a stand-alone right, it was rather one part of a bundle of rights that depended on the other parts to be functional. It could only be effective in conjunction with the rights conferred by the 2012 Agreement, the Interconnection Agreements with Turkmentelecom, Altyn Asyr and ACT, and the Radio Frequency Agreement under which frequencies were allocated to the Claimant. In this framework, the communications license functioned as an integral part of the overall investment, an indivisible whole. The 2012 Agreement and the ancillary agreements were indispensable to the Claimant\u2019s operations. The Respondent concludes that the Claimant did not have any investment capable of expropriation following the expiration of its contracts in September 2017.542\n\nResp. PHB, \u00b6 21.\n\nHearing Transcript, Day 1, 274:3-11.\n\nResp. PHB, \u00b6 21.\n\n437.\n\nThe Respondent explains that the 2012 Agreement was the framework agreement - the replacement for the 2005 Agreement under which MTS previously operated in Turkmenistan from 2005-2010 - without which MTS was not entitled to operate in Turkmenistan. The very title of the 2012 Agreement refers to the \"Conditions of Operation [...] in the Cellular Telecommunications Market of Turkmenistan\".543 The 2012 Agreement and the ancillary agreements provided the \"technical base\" and \"technical means\" that allowed MTS to obtain, and to maintain, a functional license. Once these Agreements expired, MTS-TM could not conduct the cellular communications services that were the subject of the communications license.544 MTS\u2019 license was one right in a bundle of rights a bundle that was an \"indivisible whole\". According to the Respondent, possessing one stick in a bundle of rights is not enough.545\n\nResp. PHB, \u00b6 23.\n\nResp. PHB, \u00b6 27.\n\nResp. PHB, \u00b6 28.\n\n438.\n\nThe Respondent submits that MTS-TM\u2019s business plans show that the Claimant always understood it had only a 5-year time horizon for its operations in Turkmenistan, as expressly set forth in the 2012 Agreement, and did not believe that it had a right nor any expectation that it would continue operating after the expiration of that contract. MTS-TM, on instructions from MTS\u2019 global Board of Directors, carefully calibrated its investments to adhere to this 5-year time frame, with the expressly stated objective - seen over and over again in its own documents - that it must recover its investment in Turkmenistan within five years and maximize its profits in that period. The Respondent asserts that this strategy permeated every decision that MTS-TM made during the course of its operations from 2012-2017, including the decision not to invest in updated technology that could have more fully realized the potential of business in Turkmenistan over the long term, but would not have provided the requisite short-term return.546\n\nResp. PHB, \u00b6 29.\n\n439.\n\nThe Respondent contends that MTS-TM\u2019s business plans also show that MTS-TM established its level of investment at the outset of operations in 2012, immediately after its successful relaunch of operations - in a favourable environment, untainted by any of the purportedly wrongful conduct that MTS alleges occurred in later years and that it carried out that level of investment for the following five years, achieving its financial goals and obtaining an overall [REDACTED] The record thus also contradicts MTS\u2019 allegations that it was impeded by wrongful measures during the course of its operations in 2012-2017.547\n\nResp. PHB, \u00b6 30.\n\n440.\n\nThe Respondent argues that, as part of its primary \"2017 Shutdown\" claim, the Claimant attacks the 2012 Agreement in two ways: first, it argues that the 2012 Agreement was not a \"legal prerequisite\" to its operations in Turkmenistan and, second, it argues that none of the \"technical means\" required to operate its network in the country were provided pursuant to the 2012 Agreement, but rather through the ancillary agreements with Turkmentelecom, Altyn Asyr, Ashgabat Telephone Network, the Interdepartmental Commission on Radio Frequencies and Turkmentelecom\u2019s regional affiliates. The Respondent submits that there can be no question that the 2012 Agreement was the primary legal basis setting the terms and conditions under which MTS was permitted to operate as a cellular services operator in Turkmenistan, and that it was the basis on which MTS was provided with the technical means required for such operations. The Respondent asserts that the Claimant\u2019s own counsel acknowledged contemporaneously that the 2012 Agreement provided the legal guarantees that MTS will receive all the critical technical resources they require.548\n\nResp. Reply PHB, \u00b6 2.\n\n441.\n\nThe Respondent maintains that the evidence establishes that the Claimant fully understood that the 2012 Agreement was the necessary framework agreement for its operations in Turkmenistan, without which it could not operate.549 The Respondent contends that the Claimant\u2019s attempt to disavow the 2012 Agreement contradicts the evidentiary record, its own prior statements and its own conduct in Turkmenistan.550 Thus the Respondent argues that it is undisputed that\n\n\u2022 MTS always operated throughout its entire history in Turkmenistan pursuant to a framework agreement, starting in 2005, when it acquired the rights of BCTI (which had also operated under a framework agreement for its entire history from 1994-2005), when it entered into the 2005 Agreement, and again under the 2012 Agreement.551\n\n\u2022 Each time that its framework agreements expired, first in 2010 and then in 2017, the Claimant sought to extend those agreements on the same terms and conditions, knowing that it could not continue operating in the country without them. The Respondent takes the view that the Claimant would not have sought to extend the 2012 Agreement if it had believed it was unnecessary.552\n\n\u2022 The Claimant\u2019s own admissions in the 2010 Arbitrations demonstrate its understanding that the \"framework\" for its operations was established in the 2005 Agreement - just as BCTI\u2019s 1994 Agreement, which the Claimant acquired in 2005, had established the \"framework\" for BCTI\u2019s operations in Turkmenistan. The Respondent submits that the terms and conditions of the 2012 Agreement, and the system of ancillary agreements associated with it, were carried over from and were nearly identical to the 2005 Agreement.553\n\n\u2022 In its contemporaneous, public filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in 2012, the Claimant itself described the 2012 Agreement as the agreement regarding its terms of operation in Turkmenistan, which had been signed with Turkmentelecom, acting in accordance with a decree issued by the President of Turkmenistan.554\n\n\u2022 The preamble of 2012 Agreement defines the latter as setting forth the \"Conditions of Operation of MTS-Turkmenistan [...] In The Cellular Telecommunications Market of Turkmenistan\".555\n\n\u2022 The Claimant\u2019s witnesses confirmed the significance of, and need to extend, the 2012 Agreement, which they were \"hoping\" would be renewed on the same terms and conditions in 2017, and they recognized that an extension for another 5-year term was not a mere \"formality\", but rather was necessary to continue their operations in Turkmenistan.556\n\nResp.

The Respondent asserts that it did not say that the 2012 Agreement \"had no basis in Turkmen law\" at the Hearing, nor did it \"admit that it could not produce any legal basis for the 2012 Agreement\" as alleged by the Claimant.557 The Respondent asserts that the 2012 Agreement is grounded in Turkmen law, and was entered pursuant to and in accordance with several Turkmen legal instruments, which are in the record. The Respondent further restates the following points:\n\n\u2022 The Claimant acknowledges that the 2012 Agreement was specifically authorized by Presidential Decree, which authorized Turkmentelecom to conclude an agreement with MTS on the terms and conditions of activity of MTS-TM. The prior framework agreement under which MTS operated, the 2005 Agreement, was likewise authorized by a Presidential Decree.558\n\n\u2022 Pursuant to its charter, issued under Turkmen law, Turkmentelecom is \"primarily tasked with satisfying all the telecommunication demands of Turkmenistan in accordance with the national plans for the development of the communications sector, which is overseen by the MOC [...] includ[ing] cellular communications\", and it entered into the 2012 Agreement in accordance with its capacities under its charter.559\n\n\u2022 In particular, Turkmentelecom\u2019s charter provides that Turkmentelecom has the right to enter into contracts with legal entities and natural persons.560\n\n\u2022 The Turkmen Civil Code further states that legal entities, including those formed by the State, such as Turkmentelecom, may participate in relations of civil law on general grounds.561\n\nResp.

Reply PHB, \u00b6 4.\n\n444.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the Claimant\u2019s theory according to which contract terms cannot be \"legal\" unless they are specifically required in legislation, is absurd. According to the Respondent there is no merit to that theory, and the Claimant has never supported it with any legal authorities, whether domestic or international. The Respondent takes the view that parties to a commercial agreement are free to agree to whatever commercial terms they want, including profit-sharing, and MTS operated under those agreed terms from the very beginning of its activities in Turkmenistan in 2005, as did its predecessor BCTI. The Respondent submits that the Claimant\u2019s lawyer in 2005, [REDACTED] confirmed that the 2005 Agreement, including profit-sharing, was \"certainly not\" illegal nor did it violate Turkmen law. The Respondent argues that both the 2012 Agreement and its profit-sharing terms were in full compliance with Turkmen law, legal instruments and the Constitution.563\n\nResp. Sur-Reply PHB, \u00b6 6.\n\n445.\n\nWith regards to the Claimant\u2019s illegality and estoppel arguments, the Respondent argues in its Sur-Reply PHB that the Claimant has completely backpedalled, stating that the Claimant \"does not assert that the 2012 Agreement was an 'illegal\u2019 contract in the sense that it was procured by some unlawful means\" and that \"MTS is not making any claim arising from the negotiation of the 2012 Agreement\". The Respondent asserts that the Claimant curiously argues that it is not estopped from claiming that the Respondent unlawfully extracted [REDACTED] following the resumption of MTS\u2019 operations. The Respondent takes that view that the Claimant\u2019s new admission that it does not claim wrongful conduct with respect to the negotiations of the 2012 Agreement precludes its argument that it was economically coerced into entering that contract or that the Respondent unlawfully imposed profit-sharing.564\n\nResp. Sur-Reply PHB, \u00b6 7.\n\n446.\n\nThe Respondent further submits that the Claimant\u2019s argument that the 2012 Agreement did not form the basis of (or provide the consideration for) the provision of any technical resources to MTS-TM is incorrect. The Respondent asserts that the Claimant\u2019s own counsel acknowledged at the time the 2012 Agreement was negotiated and signed, that agreement provided MTS with the \"legal guarantees\" required in order for MTS to receive the \"critical technical resources\" necessary for its operations in Turkmenistan.565\n\nResp. Reply PHB, \u00b6 5.\n\n447.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, the Parties expressly recognized and understood that the 2012 Agreement was the pre-requisite for MTS\u2019 operations in Turkmenistan, setting forth the terms and conditions of its operations, including the \"legal guarantees\" and basis on which Turkmentelecom and other Turkmen entities would provide MTS with the technical resources for its operations in the country. The Respondent points out that the Claimant itself relied upon and repeatedly invoked the 2012 Agreement throughout its operations in 2012-2017 to request and obtain the resources it needed, and that the Claimant has repeatedly affirmed the significance of Clause 3 of the 2012 Agreement, pointing out that \"[u]nder the 2012 Agreement, Turkmenistan expressly committed to providing MTS-TM with the 'technical conditions of operation\u2019 and 'all necessary legal and technical resources\u2019\".566\n\nResp. Reply PHB, \u00b6 6.\n\n448.\n\nThe Respondent submits in its Reply PHB that the Claimant, as part of its alternative \"2017 Shutdown\" claim, states that even if the 2012 Agreement were a legal prerequisite for MTS\u2019 operations in Turkmenistan the refusal to extend it beyond September 2017 was not justified and violated its legitimate expectations. The Respondent responds to that argument as follows: (i) the 2012 Agreement provided for a 5-year term without mandatory extension; (ii) MTS knew full well that Turkmentelecom was not \"obliged\" to renew the 2012 Agreement for a second 5-year term in 2017; (iii) the \"Note\" on the back of MTS\u2019 first license in 2012 (which was not repeated on the second license, issued in 2015) did not supersede the terms of the 2012 Agreement and ancillary agreements nor did it guarantee MTS ten years of operations in the country; (iv) MTS\u2019 contemporaneous business plans and financial information demonstrate that MTS carefully planned and carried out its investments with the knowledge and expectation that it had only a 5-year term under the 2012 Agreement, with the goal of completely recovering its investment in that 5-year time period and realizing a profit, which it succeeded in doing; and (v) Turkmentelecom\u2019s reasons for not renewing in 2017 were valid and known to MTS.567\n\nResp. Reply PHB, \u00b6 7.\n\n**(2) The Tribunal\u2019s Analysis**\n-------------------------------\n\n449.\n\nAs regards the Claimant\u2019s 2017 Shutdown Claims, the Tribunal will analyse the Claimant\u2019s Primary (a.) and Alternative (b.) case in turn. None of these claims is successful. As a consequence, the 2017 Shutdown Claims have to be dismissed.\n\n***a. Primary case***\n---------------------\n\n450.\n\nBy way of reminder, under its primary case the Claimant argues that the Respondent expropriated the Claimant\u2019s investment in Turkmenistan when it shut down MTS-TM\u2019s network on 29 September 2017 on the basis that MTS no longer had the right to operate in Turkmenistan following the expiry of the 2012 Agreement. It is the Claimant\u2019s argument that the 2012 Agreement was not a legal prerequisite for MTS-TM to operate (or continue operating) in Turkmenistan and that the Respondent had no right to shut down MTS-TM\u2019s operations on the basis that the 2012 Agreement had expired. The Claimant further submits that the 2012 Agreement was illegal (and therefore invalid) due to economic coercion and due to an illegal profit charge. In the Claimant\u2019s view, its license was a sufficient legal basis for its operations in Turkmenistan. At the time of the 2017 shutdown, MTS says that it was in possession of a valid license with a commitment from the Ministry of Communications to a minimum 10-year operating term from 2012. Thus, it is the Claimant\u2019s case that MTS\u2019 right to further operate in Turkmenistan was expropriated by the Respondent (along with the value of MTS\u2019 business) when it shut down MTS-TM\u2019s network in September 2017.568\n\nCl. PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 10 et seq.\n\n***(a) Legality/validity of the 2012 Agreement***\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n451.\n\nAs an initial point, the Tribunal finds that the 2012 Agreement was neither invalid nor illegal.\n\n452.\n\nIn the Tribunal\u2019s view, and contrary to the Claimant\u2019s assertion, there is no evidence that the Claimant was coerced into signing the 2012 Agreement. Rather, it is undisputed that it was the Claimant who sought an extension of the 2005 Agreement at the end of its 5-year-term.\n\n453.\n\nFurthermore, it was the Claimant which, in 2010, had commenced arbitrations following the non-renewal of the 2005 Agreement, the settlement of which led to the 2012 Agreement.569 There is no evidence that the Claimant was unable to bargain. In any event, the Tribunal observes that the Claimant had operated before 2012 under similar profit-sharing arrangements. The conclusion of the 2012 Agreement with a [REDACTED] is not, in such circumstances, an indication of coercion by the Respondent.570\n\n*See* Sections III. B. and C. (1) and (2) above.\n\n*See* Sections III. B. and C. (1) and (2) above.\n\n454.\n\nThe Tribunal is not convinced that, under these circumstances, the 2012 Agreement was not freely negotiated or that the Claimant was forced by the Respondent to conclude the 2012 Agreement.\n\n455.\n\nThe Tribunal finds that the \"profit charge\" (as the Claimant defines it) or the \"profit sharing terms\" (as the Respondent defines them) contained in Clause 1 of the 2012 Agreement is not in itself illegal and did not render the 2012 Agreement illegal or invalid.\n\n456.\n\nAs convincingly explained by the Respondent\u2019s expert, Dr. Dippon, profit-sharing or some kind of charge for granting a concession to operate in the telecommunication services industry is quite common in the global telecommunications world.571\n\nDippon Report, \u00b6\u00b6 74, et seq.\n\n457.\n\nAs far as the Claimant argues that the 2012 Agreement was \"without legal basis\" the Tribunal finds that the 2012 Agreement is sufficiently grounded in Turkmen law. Like the 2005 Agreement before it, the 2012 Agreement was specifically authorized by a Presidential Decree (No. 12307, dated 13 May 2012) \"authorizing [Turkmentelecom] to conclude an agreement with [MTS] on the terms and conditions of activity of [MTS-TM]\".572 According to its charter, as summarized by Turkmentelecom\u2019s former [REDACTED] Turkmentelecom is primarily tasked with satisfying all the telecommunication demands of Turkmenistan in accordance with the national plans for the development of the communications sector, which is overseen by the MOC\".573 Turkmentelecom\u2019s charter, in Article 3.1.2, provides that Turkmentelecom has the right to \"[e]nter into contracts with legal entities and natural persons\". The Turkmen Civil Code states in Article 48(2) that legal entities, including those formed by the State, such as Turkmentelecom, may \"participate in relations of civil law on general grounds\"; Article 1(2) provides that \"[i]ndividuals and legal entities are free to establish their rights and obligations based on a contract\".574 These provisions are consistent with the universally held view that the freedom of contract applies to States and State entities. This is nothing unusual. The Tribunal is therefore satisfied that, when Turkmentelecom entered into the 2012 Agreement, it did so in accordance with its capacities under its charter and in accordance with the Turkmen Law.\n\nRuling of the President of Turkmenistan No. 12307 \"On the development of cellular communication in Turkmenistan, 13 May 2012, Exhibit C-0009.\n\n[REDACTED]; *See* Charter of Turkmentelecom, in particular Articles 1.4, 2.1, 3.2, Exhibit R-0138.\n\nCharter of Turkmentelecom, in particular Article 3.1, Exhibit R-0138; Civil Code of Turkmenistan, Articles 1(2), 48(2) Exhibit R-0206.\n\n458.\n\nMoreover, the Tribunal is not convinced by, and sees no legal basis for, the Claimant\u2019s argument that freely negotiated contractual terms such as Clause 1 of the 2012 Agreement cannot be lawful unless they are specifically mentioned in or required by legislation. In the Tribunal\u2019s view, parties to a commercial agreement are in principle free to agree to whatever commercial terms they want, including profit-sharing, unless such the terms are contrary to a legal prohibition (which does not exist here). This is what MTS and Turkmentelecom did by negotiating and concluding the 2012 Agreement.\n\n459.\n\nThe Tribunal does not share the Claimant\u2019s view that the profit charge was discriminatory because Altyn Asyr did not operate under a profit-sharing agreement like Clause 1 of the 2012 Agreement. The Tribunal finds that Altyn Asyr, as a wholly State-owned company, and MTS, as a privately-owned company, are not similarly situated and that the Claimant\u2019s discrimination argument therefore fails. More particularly, all of the [REDACTED] (and not just a [REDACTED] of a wholly State-owned business like Altyn Asyr belong, in principle, to the State. Therefore, the Tribunal does not find that the profit-sharing under the 2012 Agreement can be regarded as discriminatory.\n\n460.\n\nIt is further undisputed that the Claimant, in the past, had always operated in Turkmenistan under contracts with profit-sharing terms. Thus, the 1994 Agreement, which the Claimant acquired from BCTI in 2005, obligated the Claimant to pay [REDACTED] of its profits,575 whereas the 2005 Agreement contained a [REDACTED] profit charge.576 It is also undisputed that the Claimant never challenged the legality or validity of these contractual arrangements prior to this arbitration.\n\n1 994 Agreement, Clause 5.1, Exhibit C-0003.\n\n2005 Agreement, Clause 1, Exhibit C-0005.\n\n461.\n\nFurthermore, the Claimant\u2019s external legal counsel during the 2005 negotiations, Mr. [REDACTED], testified that there was no concern at the time that the 1994 and 2005 Agreements were illegal. [REDACTED]lso confirmed during his testimony at the Hearing that the Claimant had performed legal due diligence and that MTS received advice from local Turkmen counsel. He recalled no concern about the 2012 Agreement being illegal, although he had no specific recollection as to the profit charge. [REDACTED] testified:\n\nQ. Did MTS perform commercial and legal due diligence on BCTI\u2019s operation in Turkmenistan?\n\nA. We certainly conducted legal diligence. On the commercial side, I didn\u2019t see it myself, but it would have been done. Because even back in those days, it was practice to put together a diligence package and presentation for the MTS board before they signed off on deals, which would have included the technical commercial piece, alongside the legal analysis.\n\nQ. Did MTS hire local counsel in Turkmenistan to advise and assist in the transaction?\n\nA. Yes, this I can\u2019t recall. I was thinking about this when I put the witness statement together.\n\nSometimes we, [REDACTED], sourced and subcontracted to local lawyers. On other occasions, MTS had their own contacts and dealt with local counsel themselves.\n\nI have a feeling with Turkmenistan it was \u2014 as I\u2019m sure all the folks here will not be surprised to hear, it was a challenge in 2004/2005 to find sophisticated M&A lawyers; or any lawyers, actually. And I think MTS would have sourced expertise through contacts, which sometimes involved academic lawyers, people that were -- this could well have been a lawyer in Ashgabat who was a professor of law, or similar. I can\u2019t recall.\n\nBut certainly someone did, because I do recall we were all comfortable with the legal analysis on the notification and change of control point.\n\nQ. So do you remember seeing any due diligence report from Turkmen lawyers?\n\nA. I don\u2019t recall, which is why -- which is why I think MTS dealt with them directly internally.577\n\nand\n\nQ. The contract also provided for MTS to pay [REDACTED] of its net profits to the Government; correct?\n\nA. Correct.\n\nQ. The profit-sharing term was not based on any law enforced in Turkmenistan; correct?\n\nA. To my knowledge, correct, yes.\n\nQ. And you didn\u2019t think that was illegal; correct?\n\nA. For sure not.\n\nQ. So that\u2019s why you advised your client to go forward with the transaction; correct?\n\nA. Yes. We wouldn\u2019t have proceeded if we thought there was material illegality involved in the investment, in any jurisdiction.578\n\nand\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: [...] Was there any concern raised that perhaps the existence of the agreement, the 2005 Agreement, would somehow violate Turkmen law, because the operation agreement as such is not based on any statutory Turkmen requirement? Did that come to your mind, or was it a concern?\n\nSo the question: \"Why the hell do we need that agreement? We could apply for a license and the license would be granted as a matter of Turkmen law\".\n\nA. Well, I can\u2019t recall the detail of the discussions, forgive me. You know, it\u2019s 17 years ago.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: No, no, we understand. And I have to say, given the time span that has passed, you have a fairly good recollection.\n\nA. Certainly I don\u2019t -- I certainly don\u2019t recall any discussions or material concern that by signing the agreement we were breaching Turkmen law. We would have definitely -- MTS were always very -- being a New York-listed entity, always very, very sensitive to being on the right side of the line whenever we did transactions, especially in other countries. So we would not have signed the agreement if we had any concerns around the legality of the terms in it.\n\nI think we knew when we went down there, following the switch-off, we\u2019re going to have to renegotiate the 1994 Agreement. We\u2019re not going to come out of this with the 1994 Agreement just intact and everyone shaking hands. And so the November 2005 Agreement was a necessary, enforced through circumstances, renegotiation of the 1994 Agreement.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: As a matter of commercial -- and perhaps even legal -- reality, you were concerned to protect your client: nothing illegal, as you said.\n\nA. Yes.579\n\nHearing Transcript, Day 4, 145:16 - 146:21.\n\nHearing Transcript, Day 4, 147:19 - 148:5.\n\nHearing Transcript, Day 4, 175:14 - 176:21.\n\n462.\n\nIn the Tribunal\u2019s view, the profit-sharing tenus of the 2012 Agreement were, during several months of negotiations with counsel on both sides, freely negotiated between the Claimant and the Respondent. The Tribunal notes that it was the Claimant that actively sought the extension of the 2005 Agreement (including the profit charge) at the end of the 5-year term of the 2005 Agreement. It is undisputed that all of the (nearly 20) drafts exchanged between the Parties of the 2012 Agreement, which included drafts submitted by the Claimant, contained a profit charge. Thus, the Claimant itself did not question the validity of the profit-sharing terms in 2012, and its own draft proposals of the 2012 Agreement provided for a profit share. Rather, it was the Claimant\u2019s goal in the negotiations of the 2012 Agreement to [REDACTED] as submitted by the Claimant\u2019s witness [REDACTED]580rather than deleting/avoiding the profit charge as being an illegal term. In the end, a [REDACTED] (contained in Clause 1 of the 2012 Agreement) was agreed. And it was the Claimant that, in 2017, wanted to renew the 2012 Agreement and on the \"same terms\"581 as submitted by the Claimant\u2019s witness [REDACTED] which obviously included the profit share.\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n463.\n\nIn sum, the Tribunal finds that the Claimant has failed to discharge its burden of proof in relation to the alleged invalidity or illegality of the 2012 Agreement and/or the profit-charge. The Tribunal finds that the 2012 Agreement was neither illegal nor invalid due to coercion or due to the profit-sharing arrangement contained in Clause 1.\n\n464.\n\nFurthermore, even if the 2012 Agreement had been illegal or invalid (based on coercion into the 2012 Agreement and/or an illegality of the profit-sharing arrangement in Clause 1), quod non, the Claimant would be estopped from invoking these grounds.\n\n465.\n\nThe Claimant itself proposed drafts of the 2012 Agreement which included a profit charge. It was the Claimant that requested an extension of the 2012 Agreement (including profit-sharing) and argues that it had an expectation that the 2012 Agreement would be extended on the \"same terms and conditions\". The \"same terms and conditions\" obviously included the profit charge in Clause 1 of the 2012 Agreement, about which the Claimant now complains. Thus, the Tribunal finds that the Claimant\u2019s argument regarding the illegality/invalidity of the 2012 Agreement amounts to contradictory behaviour contrary to good faith (venire contra factum proprium).\n\n***(b) Status of the 2012 Agreement / The 2012 Agreement was the framework for the Claimant\u2019s operations in Turkmenistan***\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n466.\n\nThe 2012 Agreement, in its very title, refers to the \"Conditions of Operation [...] in the Cellular Telecommunications Market of Turkmenistan\". Furthermore, the 2012 Agreement is expressly referred to in its preamble as an \"agreement on the conditions of operation of business enterprise MTS Turkmenistan [...] in the cellular communications market of [REDACTED] Turkmenistan\".582 Thus, it must have been clear to both sides, including the Claimant, that this was the central agreement which formed the fundamental basis and prerequisite for the Claimant\u2019s operations in Turkmenistan. The time and effort that both parties put into the negotiation of the 2012 Agreement supports this conclusion.\n\n2012 Agreement, Exhibit C-0008.\n\n467.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the 2012 Agreement not only included a profit charge/a profit-sharing arrangement as the only substantial obligation (as argued by the Claimant) contained in Clause 1, but also included several other provisions concerning the Claimant\u2019s operations in Turkmenistan, setting forth rights and obligations for both parties. Examples of such provisions include Clause 2 (Turkmentelecom has the right to receive from MTS any information concerning its operations in Turkmenistan), Clause 3 (Turkmentelecom shall provide and ensure that MTS is provided with all necessary legal and technical conditions of operation in the cellular communication market of Turkmenistan), Clause 4 (Upon request, Turkmentelecom shall solicit from the Government bodies and/or State enterprises the provision of technical equipment to MTS), Clause 5 (MTS undertakes to provide services in accordance with license and applicable laws), Clause 10 (Turkmentelecom to ensure that MTS is provided with leased premises for MTS\u2019 base stations), Clause 11 (MTS\u2019 right to establish its own tariff policy), Clause 16 (MTS\u2019 right to develop and optimize its network in Turkmenistan) and Clause 18 regarding the term of the 2012 Agreement.\n\n468.\n\nIt was only after the conclusion of the 2012 Agreement in May 2012 (and in implementation of such agreement) that the ancillary agreements (interconnection agreements583 and radio frequency agreement584) were concluded and the operating license was issued: the Interconnection Agreement with Turkmentelecom dated 9 June 2012,585 the Interconnection Agreement with Ashgabat Telephone Network dated 18 June 2012,586 the Interconnection Agreement with Altyn Asyr,587 and the Radio Frequency Agreement with the Frequency Authority dated 25 July 2012.588 All of the ancillary agreements had five-year terms and thus ran in parallel with the 2012 Agreement; hence the terms of the ancillary agreements all expired in 2017. This confirms the Tribunal\u2019s understanding that the 2012 Agreement was in fact the framework for the Claimant\u2019s operations in Turkmenistan and that the ancillary agreements were adjusted to fit, complement and implement that framework.\n\nInterconnection and Interworking Agreement No. 0013/06-3 between MTS-TM and Turkmentelecom, 9 June 2012, Exhibit C-0130, Interconnection and Interworking Agreement No. 0021/06 between MTS-TM and Ashgabat Telephone Network, 18 June 2012, Exhibit C-0131, and Agreement No. 0021/06-1 between MTS-TM and Altyn Asyr on Interconnection and Interaction of Mobile Networks, 18 June 2012, Exhibit C-0132.\n\nAgreement No. 521/0038/07 between MTS-TM and the Frequency Authority (SICURFS) on the Usage of Radio Frequency Spectrum, 25 July 2012, Exhibit C-0137.\n\nInterconnection and Interworking Agreement No. 0013/06-3 between MTS-TM and Turkmentelecom, 9 June 2012, Exhibit C-0130.\n\nInterconnection and Interworking Agreement No. 0021/06 between MTS-TM and Ashgabat Telephone Network, 18 June 2012, Exhibit C-0131.\n\nAgreement No. 0021/06-1 between MTS-TM and Altyn Asyr on Interconnection and Interaction of Mobile Networks, 18 June 2012, Exhibit C-0132.\n\nAgreement No. 521/0038/07 between MTS-TM and the Frequency Authority (SICURFS) on the Usage of Radio Frequency Spectrum, 25 July 2012, Exhibit C-0137.\n\n469.\n\nThis also applies to the operating license. Only after the 2012 Agreement and the ancillary agreements were in place, two months after the conclusion of the 2012 Agreement, was such license589 issued.\n\nLicense No. 1-20-21-40 granted to MTS-TM, 26 July 2012, Exhibit C-0010.\n\n470.\n\nIt is therefore unsurprising that, [REDACTED]590 The same system or structure of a main agreement (the then 2005 Agreement) plus ancillary agreements associated with it plus a license, was carried over from the 2005 to the 2012 Agreement.\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n471.\n\nThus, the Claimant always operated in Turkmenistan under a framework agreement: first when the Claimant acquired the rights of BCTI (including the 1994 Agreement), then when the Claimant entered into the 2005 Agreement, and again in 2012, when the Claimant entered into the 2012 Agreement. Each time when the term of those framework agreements expired, the Claimant requested the extension of those agreements: in 2010, the Claimant requested the extension of the 2005 Agreement, and in 2017, the Claimant requested the extension of the 2012 Agreement. The Tribunal is convinced that the Claimant would not have requested the extension of the 2012 Agreement if the Claimant had believed that the 2012 Agreement was not a necessary requirement for its operations in Turkmenistan.\n\n472.\n\nAlso, in the Claimant\u2019s own filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in 2012, the Claimant confirmed the central importance of the 2012 Agreement and referred to it as \"the agreement regarding our terms of operation in Turkmenistan\".591 Furthermore, during the negotiation of the 2012 Agreement, the Claimant\u2019s counsel expressed its understanding that the 2012 Agreement would provide the Claimant with the legal guarantees needed to receive all the critical technical resources.592\n\nMTS 2012 US SEC Form 20-F, p. 51, Exhibit A&M-0014.\n\nEmail from [REDACTED] 30 May 2012, p. 1, Exhibit R-0158: [MTS\u2019 Counsel]: \"2. [...] the 2012 MTS- TurkmenTelecom Agreement is itself not yet in force. Indeed, your clients insist (by way of your proposed Side Letter) that it should not enter into force until the Settlement Agreement is signed. Accordingly, our clients do not have any legal guarantees that they will receive all the critical technical resources they require as part of the settlement. [Respondent\u2019s Counsel:] The legal guarantees your client negotiated in respect of these matters are contained in Clauses 3, 4, 10 and 16 of the new commercial agreement [...]\".\n\n473.\n\nIn its Memorial, the Claimant itself describes Turkmentelecom\u2019s obligations under the 2012 Agreement as including the obligation to provide MTS with all necessary resources, and that Turkmentelecom would solicit the provision to the Operator [i.e. MTS] of all necessary communication frequencies and other communication resources and provide additional technical resources and equipment.593 The Claimant further referred to Turkmentelecom\u2019s undertaking under the 2012 Agreement to \"solicit from the government bodies and/or state enterprises of Turkmenistan the provision to the Operator of any additional numbering, additional technical equipment for the connection to the public network of Turkmenistan and/or any other technical equipment and resources necessary for the Operator to conduct and develop its activities in Turkmenistan\".594 In its Reply, the Claimant submits that \"Turkmenistan expressly promised MTS under the 2012 Agreement that it would treat MTS-TM fairly, committing, inter alia, to provide all necessary legal and technical resources to MTS-TM on a non-discriminatory basis\".595 It is also undisputed that the Claimant, during its operations in 2012-2017, requested relevant resources under the 2012 Agreement.\n\nCl. Mem., \u00b6 169.\n\nCl. Mem., \u00b6 169, quoting 2012 Agreement, Clause 4, Exhibit C-0008.\n\nCl. Reply, \u00b6 499.\n\n474.\n\nThe 2012 Agreement was the necessary legal framework for the Claimant\u2019s operations without which the Claimant could not operate, and the Tribunal is convinced that the Claimant accepted and understood that.\n\n***(c) The operating license alone did not permit MTS to continue operating in Turkmenistan***\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n475.\n\nThe Tribunal finds that the operating license alone was insufficient for MTS to continue operating after the expiry of the 2012 Agreement. Hence, the operating license did not permit the Claimant to continue operating in Turkmenistan after the expiry of the 2012 Agreement.\n\n476.\n\nContrary to the Claimant\u2019s view, the license issued to MTS in July 2015 with a term until July 2018 (as extended),596 standing alone, did not constitute a protected property right that was expropriated when the 2012 Agreement and the ancillary contracts ended and the Claimant ceased operations in September 2017.\n\nLicense No. 1-20-21-40 reissued to MTS-TM on 26 July 2015, Exhibit C-0014.\n\n477.\n\nThe reason for the lack of synchronism between the duration of the 2012 Agreement and of the 2015 license is, as the Respondent\u2019s witness [REDACTED] convincingly explains, that domestic legislation provides for a three-year renewal of the license. When MTS requested a three-year renewal after the three-year license granted in 2012 expired, the administration followed that law,597 even though it disrupted the synchronism between the duration of the license (three plus three years = six years, i.e., until 2018) and the duration of the 2012 Agreement (five years until 2017).\n\n[REDACTED].\n\n478.\n\nContrary to the Claimant\u2019s contention, the 2015 license did not confer a protected property right that was expropriated when the Claimant ceased operations in September 2017. The Claimant\u2019s activities ceased at the end of September 2017, because the contractual framework under which it conducted operations as a cellular services provider in Turkmenistan expired. The Tribunal concurs with the Respondent that the 3-year license issued to the Claimant in July 2015 was not a stand-alone right, but rather one part of a bundle of rights that depended on the other parts to be functional. It could only be effective within the framework of the 2012 Agreement, the Interconnection Agreement with Turkmentelecom, with Altyn Asyr and with ACT, and the Radio Frequency Agreement; these contracts together conferred the rights and the technical means necessary for MTS\u2019 operation upon MTS. The 2012 Agreement and the ancillary agreements were essential to the Claimant\u2019s operations and the operating license only functioned within that framework. Without that framework, the operating license was useless. As a consequence, the Claimant did not retain any investment capable of expropriation following the expiration of its contracts in September 2017.\n\n479.\n\nTurkmen law on licensing required license holders to be technically capable of providing services.598 Upon the expiry of the ancillary agreements in parallel with the 2012 Agreement, MTS-TM\u2019s technical capability for providing services, and thus meeting the requirement for the continued validity of the license, was no longer present. In the Tribunal\u2019s view, a license alone is useless without the technical means to operate. Furthermore, the license alone did not give the Claimant a right to require the Respondent to provide the technical means to operate in Turkmenistan. The latter was provided for in the 2012 Agreement, which had expired in 2017 in accordance with its tenus.\n\nLaw of Turkmenistan No. 202-III \"On Licensing of Certain Types of Activities\" (as amended), Article 11, C-0064.\n\n480.\n\nArticle 11(3) of the Law of Turkmenistan \"On Licensing of Certain Types of Activities\" requires, under the heading \"Licensing Requirements and Conditions\", that\n\nThe licensing regulations shall provide that the licensee must comply with:\n\n[...]\n\n3) ensure compliance of buildings, structures, equipment and other technical means with the special conditions set for licensees in the instances where it is necessary for the carrying out of certain types of activities;\n\n[...].599\n\nLaw of Turkmenistan No. 202-III \"On Licensing of Certain Types of Activities\" (as amended), 25 June 2008, Exhibit C-0064; Article 11 reads as follows:  \nArticle 11. Licensing Requirements and Conditions  \nThe licensing regulations shall provide that the licensee must comply with:  \n1) laws of Turkmenistan and environmental, sanitary and epidemiological, hygiene, and fire safety rules and regulations;  \n2) qualification requirements set for licensees;  \n3) ensure compliance of buildings, structures, equipment and other technical means with the special conditions set for licensees in the instances where it is necessary for the carrying out of certain types of activities;  \n4) internal control regulations for combating the legalization of illicit earnings and the financing of terrorism.\n\n481.\n\nThe licensing requirements and conditions imposed on the license applicant when a license is issued are contained in Articles 24 et seq. of the \"Regulations on Licensing of Activities in Communications Area\".600 Article 24(6) provides as follows:\n\n24. The licensing requirements and conditions imposed on the license applicant when a license is issued are the following:\n\n[...]\n\n6) Availability of material and technical base that is sufficient for the performance of work, provision of services that are part of the licensed types of activities;\n\n[...].\n\nResolution of the President of Turkmenistan No. 11266 \"On Approval of Regulations on Licensing of Activities in Communications Area\" (as amended), 17 September 2010, Exhibit C-0090.\n\n482.\n\nAt the Hearing, the Respondent\u2019s witness [REDACTED] further explained this aspect as follows:\n\nQ. And did MTS have this when it applied for its license, these underlying requirements and conditions?\n\nA. When MTS applied for a license, the material and technical base had to be there for the application and if one of the points were to be missing, the issue would remain open.\n\nQ. So you\u2019re saying that it did have these underlying conditions we just spoke of?\n\nA. At the time of the application, they already had a signed agreement with Turkmentelecom for interconnection, Interconnection Agreement. They applied for the frequencies allocation, they had been allocated, by the way, and that was in line with the applicable legislation. Without at least one of them, the license wouldn\u2019t have been granted.601\n\nHearing Transcript, Day 8, 185:25 - 186:13.\n\n483.\n\nRegarding the dependency of the license on the necessary framework, [REDACTED] stated in his testimony:\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Now, my question to you is, the second licence was not under any condition; it was for three years\u2019 period. What was the basis of the cancellation of this licence, 10 months prior to the expiration? That is my question to you.\n\nA. Mr President, the licence was not terminated or cancelled. It was valid until 28th July, if I remember correctly, 2018. 28th or 26th July. I may be wrong. It was never revoked. So they had a licence for three years.\n\nThe 2012 Agreement expired in September and without that agreement, MTS simply could not continue operating on the basis of just a licence, because the Interconnection Agreement, a Frequency Agreement and all of that is the basis for any licence, and this is why [REDACTED] knew and was asking for the agreement to be extended.602\n\nHearing Transcript, Day 8, 199:4 - 20.\n\n484.\n\nThe 2012 Agreement and the ancillary agreements provided the \"technical base\" and \"technical means\" that allowed MTS to obtain and to maintain a functional license. Once these agreements expired, MTS-TM could not conduct the cellular communications services that were the subject of the communications license.\n\n485.\n\nHence, the license did not give the Claimant the right to continue operating beyond the expiry of the 2012 Agreement. Therefore, the residual term of the 2015 license until July 2018 did not grant the Claimant more rights than it had under the 2012 Agreement and the ancillary agreements. Again, the license alone was useless without these agreements. Thus, even if the residual term of the license had been unlawfully taken away by the Respondent, the value of it would have been worthless.\n\n486.\n\nThe Tribunal further finds that the \"3+2+3+2\" wording on the back of the 2012 license603 does not lead to a different conclusion.604\n\nLicense No. 1-20-21-40 granted to MTS-TM, 26 July 2012, Exhibit C-0010.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, the wording on the back of the 2012 license, which is in Turkmen language, has to be translated as follows *(See* Claimant\u2019s License Submission, 30 June 2022, \u00b6 1): \"This license was issued by the Ministry of Communications of Turkmenistan to be valid for a period of 3 years from the date of issue of the original and in accordance with the legislation of Turkmenistan shall be subsequently extended for 2, 3 and 2 years, not exceeding a total of 10 years\".  \nAccording to the Respondent, the wording on the back of the 2012 license, which is in Turkmen language, has to be translated as follows (*See* Respondent\u2019s License Submission dated 30 June 2022, Annex 1, \u00b6 3): \"Note: This original copy of License was issued by the Ministry of Communications of Turkmenistan for a period of 3 years starting from the date of actual issuance and is to be extended according to the procedure set forth by the legislation of Turkmenistan consecutively for 2, 3 and 2 years, for a total period of no longer than 10 years\".\n\n487.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the Parties are in disagreement on whether the \"3+2+3+2\" wording on the back of the 2012 license gave the Claimant the right to a renewed operating license for an aggregate period of ten years.\n\n488.\n\nIn the Tribunal\u2019s view, even assuming that the \"3+2+3+2\" wording on the back of the 2012 license was a valid agreement that gave the Claimant the right or legitimate expectation to a renewed license with an aggregate term of ten years (quod non), this would not have given the Claimant the right or legitimate expectation to continue operating without the necessary framework, i.e., without the 2012 Agreement and without the ancillary agreements. Thus, in the Tribunal\u2019s view, it does not make a difference whether the Claimant\u2019s operating license had a residual term of 10 months or 5 years and 10 months: A license alone without the necessary legal and technical framework was useless and did not give the Claimant the right or expectation to continue operating in Turkmenistan.\n\n489.\n\nFurthermore, as both Parties agree, according to the \"3+2+3+2\" wording on the back of the 2012 license, any extension of the license would only be in accordance with the \"legislation of Turkmenistan\", which means that any renewal would be subject to a (renewed) examination of the requirements for granting a license. Therefore, irrespective of whether the \"3+2+3+2\" wording constitutes a binding agreement or not, any extension of the license was, even according to the wording on the back of the 2012 license, not a mere automatic formality, but rather was subject to Turkmen legislation and therefore subject to review of the licensing requirements, which could have ended with the refusal to grant or to renew the license.605 And without the technical means to cany out its operations in Turkmenistan the Claimant had no right or expectation to a renewed or newly granted license.\n\nThis is also explained by the Respondent\u2019s witness [REDACTED], who points out that in accordance with Turkmen legislation every renewal of the license would be subject to a renewed application and a renewed review of the licensing requirements: \"First, the wording of the note itself explicitly refers to a 'prolongation as per legislation of Turkmenistan.\u2019 This confirms that each renewal of the license required the resubmission of an application and issuance of a renewed license in line with the relevant Turkmen laws. It follows that each application for renewal of a license had to be reviewed by the MOC, which verified, based on the submitted documents, the fulfillment of the licensing requirements and conditions. Provided these were not satisfied, the Licensing Committee was entitled to dismiss the application\".\n\n490.\n\nTherefore, the license expired in July 2018 without any right or legitimate expectation to a renewal/extension thereafter.\n\n491.\n\nFurthermore, even though, following the Tribunal\u2019s reasoning above, it is not decisive for the Tribunal\u2019s finding, the Tribunal notes that the \"3+2+3+2\" language did not constitute an agreement or even a guarantee to have a license with a ten-year-duration as argued by the Claimant. The maximum of ten years (\"3+2+3+2\") contemplated in the note on the back of the 2012 license was obviously to align the possible maximum duration of the license with the possible maximum duration of the 2012 Agreement, subject to the legislation of Turkmenistan, i.e., subject to a renewed application for a license and a renewed review of the licensing requirement. This, however, does not constitute an agreement or a \"guarantee\" to be provided with a license with an (aggregate) ten-year duration.\n\n492.\n\nIt is undisputed that, under Turkmen law, the maximum term of a license is three years and that an extension requires a review of all necessary requirements (e.g., necessary technical conditions). Hence, already from the outset, under these conditions there could not be any expectation or right of having a license granted \"in perpetuity\". In addition, as mentioned before, even a license \"in perpetuity\" would have been dependent on the necessary framework without which even an unlimited license would be useless.\n\n***(d) Conclusion on Primary Case***\n------------------------------------\n\n493.\n\nTherefore, the Tribunal finds that the Claimant\u2019s Primary Case fails.\n\n494.\n\nThe 2012 Agreement was valid and binding as a matter of Turkmen law. It was, moreover, the framework for MTS\u2019 operations in the telecommunications market in Turkmenistan; MTS-TM could not have operated in Turkmenistan solely pursuant to a license. The license could not have been extended without the 2012 Agreement being in force, so that MTS had no right that could have been expropriated by Turkmenistan at the time the 2012 Agreement expired.\n\n495.\n\nConsequently, at the end of the 5-year-term there was no right of the Claimant that could have been taken/expropriated (Article 5(1) of the BIT) or otherwise be violated by the Respondent. In view of this finding, the Tribunal finds that there is no basis for assuming a violation of the further standards under the BIT, such as FET (Article 4(1)), FPS (Article 3(3)), All Necessary Approvals (Article 3(2)).\n\n***b. Alternative Case***\n-------------------------\n\n496.\n\nUnder its alternative case the Claimant argues that, even if the 2012 Agreement was a legal prerequisite for its operations in Turkmenistan, the Respondent breached the BIT by refusing to the extend the 2012 Agreement beyond September 2017 (i) in violation of the Claimant\u2019s legitimate expectation of a renewal of 2012 Agreement, and (ii) without any reasonable justification.\n\n***(a) The Respondent\u2019s refusal to extend the 2012 Agreement did not violate the Claimant\u2019s legitimate expectations***\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n497.\n\nThe Tribunal finds that the Respondent\u2019s refusal to extend the 2012 Agreement did not violate the Claimant\u2019s legitimate expectations. In fact, the Tribunal finds the Claimant had no right or legitimate expectation of renewal of the 2012 Agreement beyond its 5-year term.\n\n498.\n\nThe final version of the 2012 Agreement deals with duration and the possibility of renewal in Clause 18, which provides as follows:\n\nThe term of this Agreement shall be for 5 (five) years from the Effective Date. Upon the expiration of the five-year term this Agreement may be extended for a further five-year term on the satisfaction of the following conditions:\n\n[...].606\n\n2012 Agreement, Exhibit C-0008, Clause 18.\n\n499.\n\nIn view of the clear and unambiguous language of Clause 18, the Tribunal finds that the 2012 Agreement only provides for a 5-year term without mandatory renewal. Witness testimony and contemporary documentation show that the Claimant understood that Turkmentelecom \"was not obliged\" to extend the 2012 Agreement.\n\n500.\n\nOne of the Claimant\u2019s witnesses, [REDACTED] acknowledged that the final version of the 2012 Agreement does not contain mandatory renewal language:\n\nQ. But in the end, the 2012 Agreement did not guarantee ten years of operations to MTS-TM; correct?\n\nA. If we are discussing this modal verb \"shall be extended\", then indeed the final draft reads differently.\n\nQ. Do you know how it reads, the final draft?\n\nA. If I\u2019m not mistaken, it says \"may be extended\"; at least that\u2019s perhaps the meaning.607\n\nHearing Transcript, Day 3, 34:15-22.\n\n501.\n\nMTS itself acknowledged that the Claimant had no right or legitimate expectation to renew the 2012 Agreement for a second 5-year term in 2017, and certainly not to continue operating in Turkmenistan in perpetuity, in an internal, contemporaneous document \"On prolongation of an agreement on the terms of MTS activity on Turkmenistan market\"608 in June 2017:\n\nOn 14 November 2016, pursuant to the terms of clause 18 of the Agreement (at least 6 months prior to its expiration) PJSC \"MTS\" sent a written request to STC \"Turkmentelecom\" with a proposal to extend the Agreement on the same terms for a 5-year term, as was envisaged by the Agreement. We hoped that the Agreement on the Terms of Activity would be extended due to the absence of MTS-Turkmenistan violations and open claims from state controlling bodies of Turkmenistan and STC \"Turkmentelecom\", although STC \"Turkmentelecom\" was not obliged to extend it.609\n\nMTS internal report on extension of the 2012 Agreement, 5 June 2017, Exhibit C-0458.\n\nMTS internal report on extension of the 2012 Agreement, 5 June 2017, p. 1 et seq. [of the PDF], Exhibit C-0458; for same language see also MTS internal report on extension of the 2012 Agreement, 27 September 2017, p. 1, et seq. [of the PDF], Exhibit C-0528.\n\n502.\n\nWhen questioned about this language at the Hearing, the Claimant\u2019s witness [REDACTED] confirmed that the renewal provision of Clause 18 of the 2012 Agreement does not contain mandatory language:\n\n[T]he agreement did not contain a provision on a mandatory extension by Turkmentelecom, and that\u2019s why we were waiting for an answer as to whether this was going to take place or not.610\n\nHearing Transcript, Day 2, 174:2-6.\n\n503.\n\n[REDACTED] confirmed his above testimony when questioned by the President of the Tribunal about the same issue:\n\nQ. [Y]ou also agreed that while there was hope that the agreement would be extended, STC Turkmentelecom was not obliged to extend it [...] you agreed with that?\n\nA. The agreement did not have a strict legal obligation. It didn\u2019t have a clause that stated Turkmentelecom was obliged to extend the agreement for a further period of time, as far as I understand.611\n\nHearing Transcript, Day 2, 181:19 - 182:2.\n\n504.\n\nThe testimony of [REDACTED] also makes clear that the Claimant did not regard the extension of the 2012 Agreement as a mere formality:\n\nQ. Okay. Let\u2019s look at another letter. If you could pull up tab 25, this is Exhibit C-18. It\u2019s a letter from the Ministry of Communications to MTS-TM, dated December 22nd 2016. I see you\u2019re there. If you look at the third paragraph, this says that: \"... 'MTS-[TM]\u2019 has not been carrying out modernization works on existing communication [channels], has not introduced new communication services, the most advanced technologies for providing mobile coverage in populated areas of our country are not being introduced, the revenues received are systematically reduced, as well as the quality of cellular communication services in your network does not improve, for which reason the Ministry of Communication of Turkmenistan expresses its great dissatisfaction\". Do you see that?\n\nA. Yes, of course.\n\nQ. After receiving these letters, did you still think that applying for the extension was only going to be a formality?\n\nA. I said from the very beginning: we didn\u2019t believe that this application would be just a formality. Of course, this letter raised questions on our part. In our reply letter, which we already discussed, I commented on the complaints that the Ministry expressed in this letter.\n\nFurthermore, after receiving this letter, we had a personal meeting with [REDACTED] and myself, meeting with the Minister to sum up the work of the company in 2016, and to discuss the plans for 2017.612\n\nHearing Transcript, Day 2, 168:15 - 169:22.\n\n505.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the duration and renewal of the 2005 Agreement were already disputed issues between the Parties in the 2010 arbitrations. As a consequence and rather unsurprisingly, the duration and conditions for renewal of the 2012 Agreement were intensely negotiated between the Parties, as is demonstrated by the negotiation history. During these negotiations, the Claimant proposed a longer term of the 2012 Agreement (fifteen years plus an automatic extension for five years613), but the Respondent did not agree to a longer term.\n\nDraft 2012 Agreement by MTS, 19 August 2011, Clause 46, Exhibit R-0201.\n\n506.\n\nIn the contract negotiations for the 2012 Agreement, the Parties agreed on a 5-year term without a mandatory or automatic extension. Thus, the renewal term in Clause 18 of the 2012 Agreement only provides that the latter \"may be extended\" (for another 5 years) rather than e.g., \"shall\" be extended, as had been proposed in one of the Claimant\u2019s drafts of the 2012 Agreement.614 All the Claimant could do was to seek the renewal of the agreement, which was entirely in the hands of the Respondent. In accordance with the terms of the 2012 Agreement, the Respondent was under no obligation to grant a renewal. Thus, the Claimant may have had a unilateral hope for renewal, but it did not have a legitimate expectation nor indeed a right to renewal.\n\nDraft 2012 Agreement by MTS, 17 November 2011, Clause 18, Exhibit R-0210.\n\n507.\n\nWhen the 2012 Agreement was about to expire, the Claimant sought to extend this agreement for another five years, but this request was lawfully denied.\n\n508.\n\nThe Tribunal is convinced that MTS understood that Clause 18 provided Turkmentelecom full discretion regarding the extension or non-extension of the 2012 Agreement. Thus, the Claimant reported to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that the 2012 Agreement has a five-year term and \"could be extended for next five years provided certain terms and conditions are satisfied\":\n\nAs a result of negotiations with the Turkmenistan government and ministries on May 24, 2012 MTS and state-owned telecom operator Turkmentelekom, acting in accordance with a decree issued by the President of Turkmenistan, signed the agreement regarding our tenus of operations in Turkmenistan (the \"Agreement\"). The Agreement has five year term and could be extended for next five years provided certain terms and conditions are satisfied. Under this Agreement MTS-Turkmenistan will pay Turkmentelekom monthly an amount calculated as [REDACTED] in Turkmenistan based on accounting rules of Turkmenistan.615\n\nMTS 2012 US SEC Form 20-F, p. 51, Exhibit A&M-0014.\n\n509.\n\nThereby the Claimant made it clear that there was no automatic right to renewal and that the Claimant had no right to continue operating in Turkmenistan after the expiry of the 2012 Agreement\u2019s 5-year term unless the said Agreement was renewed.\n\n510.\n\nIn light of the fact that the Claimant had no right to or legitimate expectation of a renewal of the 2012 Agreement and given that the Respondent had full discretion to renew or not to renew the 2012 Agreement, the Tribunal has no need to review the reasons given by the Respondent for its decision not to renew the 2012 Agreement. The Respondent\u2019s witness [REDACTED] testified at the Hearing about the reasons for the non-renewal of the 2012 Agreement, including the need to develop the telephone and cellular communication in rural areas,616 the lack of new technology617 and the lack of a development plan.618 [REDACTED] testified at the Hearing that the profit payments under the 2012 Agreement had declined and failed to meet expectations.619 To the extent it may be relevant, therefore, the Respondent\u2019s decision not to renew the 2012 Agreement cannot be regarded as lacking any reasons. As to the reasons invoked by the Respondent, the Tribunal finds that they are not arbitrary, particularly in the light of the Tribunal\u2019s finding that the Respondent did not discriminate against MTS in the period 2012-2017 and that MTS failed to discharge its burden of proof in relation to the allegation that it was unable to develop its network in Turkmenistan in that period as planned due to the Respondent\u2019s discrimination.\n\nHearing Transcript, Day 8, 117:18-22.\n\nHearing Transcript, Day 8, 116:13-25.\n\nHearing Transcript, Day 8, 123:1-5.\n\nHearing Transcript, Day 7, 132:16-24.\n\n***(b) The Claimant\u2019s contemporaneous business plan was designed to [REDACTED]***\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n511.\n\nThat the Claimant was fully aware that the 2012 Agreement had a 5-year term without a right to or a legitimate expectation of an automatic renewal is further confirmed by the Claimant's business plan for its operations in Turkmenistan, [REDACTED]\n\n512.\n\nThe Claimant\u2019s business plan shows that the Claimant understood that it only had a 5-year term for its operations in Turkmenistan, in line with the term of the 2012 Agreement, and that the Claimant did not believe that it had a right or a legitimate expectation to continue operating after the expiry of the 2012 Agreement. Thus, [REDACTED]620\n\nMTS Presentation on Status of Business Development in Turkmenistan, 26 November 2012, p. 4, Exhibit C-0142: [REDACTED]\n\n513.\n\nThus, the first budget that the Claimant developed was reported in a Presentation on the Status of Business Development in Turkmenistan from November 2012. In that presentation, the Claimant\u2019s financial strategy was described as follows: [REDACTED]\n\n514.\n\nThe Claimant's business plan meant a [REDACTED]\n\n515.\n\nThis is confirmed by the Claimant\u2019s witness [REDACTED]625\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n516.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that, at the time that the November 2012 and December 2012 budgets and business plans were being developed, none of the allegedly wrongful measures had taken place. Thus, these business plans constitute clear evidence of the Claimant\u2019s investment strategy and financial objectives, \"untainted\" by the Respondent\u2019s allegedly wrongful conduct. In addition, these business plans were made after experiencing a \"successful\" restart of MTS-TM\u2019s operations in September 2012. This was confirmed by [REDACTED] who testified that:\n\n[...] both presentations that were made in November and December 2012 were given two to three months following a successful launch [...] [MTS had] very good expectations in terms of the business further on.626\n\nHearing Transcript, Day 2, 109:24 - 110:4.\n\n517.\n\n[REDACTED] further explained that the November and December 2012 business plans reflected the positive business environment MTS-TM found when it returned to the Turkmen market:\n\nIn November/December 2012, we had quite positive dynamics in the performance indicators. And based on those positive dynamics, we built our forecasts regarding future and expected development of the company.627\n\nHearing Transcript, Day 2, 111:1 - 5.\n\n518.\n\nIn a similar vein, [REDACTED] agreed with a statement by [REDACTED] according to which MTS experienced a successful re-entry into the Turkmen market in September 2012 with favourable conditions throughout the following year:\n\nQ. Are you aware that [REDACTED] said in his second witness statement (paragraph 28) that: \"The period from September 2012 to the end of 2013 had ... been relatively successful for MTS-TM\"? [...]\n\nA.

And capital expenditures are important because they represent the company\u2019s ability to generate profits and to grow in the future. On the other side, they reduce cash that is available for distribution to shareholders, so there\u2019s always a balancing act [...].630\n\nHearing Transcript, Day 5, 20:10-17.\n\n522.\n\nAccording to Ms. Hardin\u2019s calculations, the Claimant [REDACTED] es[REDACTED]\n\n523.\n\nTherefore, the Tribunal is convinced that the Claimant made a deliberate business decision, implemented over the years of the five-year operation in Turkmenistan, [REDACTED]633\n\nMTS Actual Financial Statements, pp. 70, 91, 114, 137, 154, 159, 160, Exhibit A&M-79.\n\n524.\n\nIn sum, [REDACTED] This clearly confirms the Tribunal\u2019s view that the Claimant understood that its operations in Turkmenistan depended on the 2012 Agreement and that it had no right or legitimate expectation of renewal of that contract.\n\n***(c) Relevance of communication license***\n--------------------------------------------\n\n525.\n\nFurthermore, the Tribunal finds that the license did not give the Claimant a right or legitimate expectation of renewal of the 2012 Agreement either.\n\n526.\n\nUnder its Alternative Case the Claimant argues, based on the - correct - assumption that its operation in Turkmenistan was conditioned upon the 2012 Agreement, that the non-renewal of the 2012 Agreement breached the Claimant\u2019s legitimate expectations.\n\n527.\n\nAs found by the Tribunal above,634 the 2012 Agreement was the framework under which the Claimant operated in Turkmenistan. The license alone without that framework and without the technical means to operate in Turkmenistan was not sufficient for the Claimant to operate in Turkmenistan and did not give the Claimant any right or expectation to continue operating in Turkmenistan.635\n\n*See* above Section VII.B.(2) a.(b).\n\n*See* above Section VII.B.(2) a.(c).\n\n***(d) Refusal to renew the 2012 Agreement not without justification***\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n528.\n\nInsofar as the Claimant complains that the Respondent has rejected the Claimant\u2019s request for a renewal of the 2012 Agreement without any reasonable justification, the Tribunal finds that the Claimant\u2019s lack of any right to a renewal of the 2012 Agreement was sufficient for the Respondent to deny the Claimant\u2019s application for a renewal. Hence, as already stated above,636 the Tribunal is not convinced that the Respondent had to justify its decision not to renew the 2012 Agreement. Nevertheless, to the extent it may be relevant, the Tribunal is not convinced that the reasons given by the Respondent (insufficient payments by MTS and insufficient investments into the telecommunications infrastructure) are not sufficient for the Respondent\u2019s decision not to renew the 2012 Agreement. As already stated above, the Tribunal also finds that the reasons invoked by the Respondent are not arbitrary.637\n\n*See* paragraph 510 above.\n\n*See* paragraph 510 above.\n\n***(e) Conclusion on Alternative Case***\n----------------------------------------\n\n529.\n\nThe Claimant had no right or legitimate expectation of renewal of the 2012 Agreement. The Claimant only had a right of limited duration under the 2012 Agreement that expired at the end of the five-year term of the 2012 Agreement.\n\n530.\n\nGiven that the Claimant had no legitimate expectation of renewal of the 2012 Agreement as the framework of its operation in Turkmenistan, there was no vested legal right capable of being expropriated after the expiration of the 2012 Agreement.\n\n531.\n\nAs a consequence, the Claimant\u2019s Alternative Case Claim fails.\n\n532.\n\nIn sum, the Claimant\u2019s 2017 Shutdown Claims fail in their entirety and must be denied.\n\n**C. THE CLAIMANT\u2019S HISTORICAL BREACHES CLAIMS**\n------------------------------------------------\n\n533.\n\nUnder its \"Historical Breaches Claims\", the Claimant complains of eleven allegedly unlawful measures imposed by Turkmenistan during the five-year term (2012 - 2017) of the 2012 Agreement which are alleged to have adversely interfered with the Claimant\u2019s operations.638\n\nThe Claimant\u2019s list of \"five key unlawful measures\" (Claimant\u2019s PHB I, Annex 1) does not include several claims (relating to sale of handsets, VPN, Interconnections with Altyn Asyr, tariff-setting, conversion). In its Sur Reply, p. 1, the Claimant states that it has not dropped these claims. Hence, they are included in the analysis.\n\n**(1) Profit Charge / Profit-Sharing Claim**\n--------------------------------------------\n\n534.\n\nUnder this claim, the Claimant argues that the \"imposition of the profit charge\" contained in Clause 1 of the 2012 Agreement was unlawful, unfair, arbitrary and discriminatory.\n\n**a.** ***The Claimant\u2019s Position***\n------------------------------------\n\n535.\n\nThe Claimant argues that the Respondent, under the 2012 Agreement, imposed a profit charge on MTS-TM between 2012-2017 without any lawful basis which constitutes a breach of (i) the FET standard (Article 4(1) BIT), (ii) the NT standard (Article 4(2) BIT), and (iii) the FPS standard (Article 3(3) BIT).639\n\nCl. PHB, \u00b6 38.\n\n536.\n\nThe Claimant takes the view that \"[t]he imposition of the Profit Charge on MTS-TM breached the FET standard because it was unfair, arbitrary, unlawful and discriminatory\". The Claimant argues that there was no basis under Turkmen law for requiring MTS-TM to pay [REDACTED] to Turkmentelecom as a condition of its operations, which in itself renders the imposition of the profit charge unfair, arbitrary and unlawful.640\n\nCl. PHB, \u00b6 38.\n\n537.\n\nThe Claimant submits that the Respondent\u2019s argument that the profit charge derived its validity from the parties\u2019 agreement, ignores the fact that MTS did not voluntarily give up [REDACTED] to Turkmentelecom. The profit charge was not \"freely negotiated\" in the exercise of the parties\u2019 freedom of contract. It was an arbitrary and extra-legal requirement imposed by the Respondent as a conditio sine qua non. The Claimant was given no choice but to accept the profit charge if it wished to operate in Turkmenistan. When the Claimant refused to submit to the Respondent\u2019s demands for a higher profit charge in 2010 and 2017, its operations were shut down each time.641\n\nCl. PHB, \u00b6 38.\n\n538.\n\nThe Claimant also takes the view that the imposition of the profit charge on MTS-TM was unlawful (and thus in further violation of the FET standard) because it violated the Respondent\u2019s legal obligations under the BIT, its Constitution, and its domestic law.642\n\nCl. PHB, \u00b6 38.\n\n539.\n\nIn its Reply PHB, the Claimant submits that, for the avoidance of doubt, the Claimant does not assert that the 2012 Agreement was an \"illegal\" contract in the sense that it was procured by some unlawful means. However, the Claimant argues that the Respondent has no answer for how its imposition of the profit-sharing obligation on MTS as a condition of its operations in Turkmenistan did not breach its own legal obligations under the BIT, the Turkmen Constitution, and the Turkmen Law on Foreign Investments.643\n\nCl. Reply PHB, \u00b6 11.\n\n540.\n\nThe Claimant submits that Article 3(1) of the BIT requires Turkmenistan to admit foreign investments \"in accordance with its legislation\". The Claimant argues that Turkmen legislation does not establish a profit-sharing requirement as a condition of admission. On the contrary, Article 21(2) of the Turkmen Law on Foreign Investments specifically guarantees that \"[f]oreign investors [...] may, after payment of taxes and other obligatory charges provided for by the laws of Turkmenistan, freely use their income and profits in the territory of Turkmenistan\".644\n\nCl. PHB, \u00b6 38, quoting Turkmen Law on Foreign Investments, 3 March 2008, Article 21(2), Exhibit C-0060.\n\n541.\n\nThe Claimant takes the view that Article 135 of the Turkmen Constitution further prohibits the imposition of any taxes, fees or other mandatory payments to the Turkmen Government that are not \"determined by law\". The Claimant submits that, while the Respondent has argued that the profit charge was not a payment to the Turkmen Government, this is unsustainable given that Turkmentelecom (as the recipient of the profit charge) forms part of the Ministry of Communications.645\n\nCl. PHB, \u00b6 38.\n\n542.\n\nAs regards the Respondent\u2019s argument that the Claimant cannot complain about the imposition of the profit charge because it agreed to it, the Claimant replies that this argument is flawed, both factually and legally. The Claimant submits that it is common ground that MTS was given no choice but to accept the imposition of the profit charge if it wished to return to the Turkmen market and [REDACTED] The Respondent\u2019s counsel openly admitted at the Hearing that MTS would have been unable to \"resume activities in Turkmenistan\" unless it entered into the 2012 Agreement, and that the only \"alternative to signing the 2012 Agreement and resuming operations\" was \"[p]ursuing its litigation\". The Claimant takes the view that legally the elements of estoppel under international law are plainly not met in the present case, and there is no precedent, commentary or academic writing indicating that an investor can be estopped from asserting a State\u2019s violation of its legal obligations under a BIT in any event.646\n\nCl. Reply PHB, \u00b6 13.\n\n543.\n\nWith regards to the Respondent\u2019s argument that if the profit-sharing obligation was unlawful, that would also mean that MTS is not entitled to invoke the benefits of the Russia-Turkmenistan BIT because its investment was illegal, the Claimant submits that an investor is not deprived of the protection of a BIT because the State has acted unlawfully. According to the Claimant that would completely undermine the purpose of the BIT. The relevant legal obligations that were breached by the imposition of the profit-sharing requirement on the Claimant are Turkmenistan\u2019s obligations - i.e., to admit investments in accordance with its legislation, not to impose taxes and other mandatory payments to the Government without legal basis, and to protect foreign investors\u2019 right to freely use their after-tax profits. The Claimant cannot be held responsible for Turkmenistan\u2019s breaches of its legal obligations towards the Claimant.647\n\nCl. Reply PHB, \u00b6 12.\n\n544.\n\nThe Claimant maintains that the profit charge was also discriminatory (and thus in further violation of the FET standard) because it was imposed on foreign-owned MTS-TM as a condition of its operations but not on domestic operator Altyn Asyr. The Claimant asserts that the Law on Communications and the Law on Licensing both require Turkmenistan to apply the same terms and conditions to foreign operators as to domestic operators.648 The Claimant argues that the Respondent\u2019s claim that the profit charge was not discriminatory because Altyn Asyr also made annual payments to Turkmentelecom by way of dividends is an effective admission that the profit charge was imposed on MTS-TM because, as a foreign-owned company, the Respondent could not lawfully extract a share of its post-tax profits as it could from Altyn Asyr. MTS-TM made distributions of dividends to its own shareholder, MTS, but the amount available for it to distribute was reduced as a result of having to pay [REDACTED] to Turkmentelecom. The lack of equivalence between a voluntary distribution of dividends and a mandatory profit tax is in the Claimant\u2019s view highlighted by the fact that Altyn Asyr chose to distribute as little as [REDACTED] to Turkmentelecom in some years, while MTS-TM had no choice but to hand over [REDACTED] to Turkmentelecom year after year. Altyn Asyr was thus able to retain significantly more of its own earnings - [REDACTED] in some years - to invest in its network or to spend on other purposes.649\n\nCl. PHB, \u00b6 38, referring to Law on Communications, Exhibit C-0073; Law on Licensing, Exhibit C-0064.\n\nCl. PHB, \u00b6 38.\n\n545.\n\nThe Claimant argues that the Respondent\u2019s argument that \"all of [Altyn Asyr\u2019s] profits belonged to the state [...] 100%\" is a reversal of the Respondent\u2019s previous position that Altyn Asyr is a financially independent company whose \"profits remain at its disposal\".650 According to the Claimant, Altyn Asyr elected to distribute only part of its profits to its shareholders by way of dividends (as little as [REDACTED] in some years), deferred the payment of dividends until later years, and was free to spend the rest on other projects (golf courses, amusement parks, etc.), while MTS-TM was given no choice but to hand over a mandatory [REDACTED] to the State every year.651\n\nCl. Sur-Reply PHB, \u00b6 19.\n\nCl. Sur-Reply PHB, p. 1.\n\n546.\n\nThe Claimant further argues that the imposition of the profit charge on MTS-TM breached the NT standard because, owing to the profit charge, the Respondent treated MTS-TM and Altyn Asyr differently without any reasonable justification. The Respondent has argued that MTS-TM and Altyn Asyr were not in \"like circumstances\" for the purposes of the NT standard because Altyn Asyr is State-owned and had a \"social focus of activities\", whereas MTS\u2019 operations were \"solely profit motivated\". The Claimant submits that this argument is illogical. MTS-TM and Altyn Asyr were direct (and exclusive) competitors. Altyn Asyr did not operate altruistically, as the Respondent suggests. [REDACTED] admitted that the Ministry of Communications set data channel tariffs in order to ensure that Altyn Asyr and Turkmentelecom met their planned income targets, which form part of the State budget.652\n\nCl. PHB, \u00b6 38.\n\n547.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, the fact that MTS-TM was a foreign-owned commercial operator and Altyn Asyr a domestic State-owned operator is precisely why their differential treatment violates the NT standard. That Altyn Asyr operated under certain (vaguely defined) social development goals cannot explain why MTS-TM alone was subject to an [REDACTED]653\n\nCl. PHB, \u00b6 38.\n\n548.\n\nAs regards causation and damages, the Claimant alleges that the loss caused to MTS by the Respondent\u2019s unlawful imposition of the profit charge is clear, as MTS-TM should never have been forced to pay [REDACTED] to Turkmentelecom without any legal basis and in violation of both the BIT and Turkmenistan\u2019s domestic laws and Constitution.654\n\nCl. PHB, \u00b6 38.\n\n549.\n\nThe Claimant argues that it paid around [REDACTED] to Turkmentelecom pursuant to the profit charge between 2012 and 2017. In the counterfactual world, the causative impact of the profit charge (and thus the share of damages attributable to this measure) becomes much greater as MTS becomes more profitable (through the removal of the other unlawful measures).655\n\nCl. PHB, \u00b6 39.\n\n***b. The Respondent \u2019s Position***\n-----------------------------------\n\n550.\n\nThe Respondent characterises MTS\u2019 allegation that the profit-sharing terms of the 2012 Agreement were illegal and constituted a violation of Articles 4(1), 4(2) and 3(3) of the BIT as frivolous and absurd.656\n\nResp. PHB, \u00b6 70.\n\n551.\n\nThe Respondent submits that MTS had always operated in Turkmenistan under contracts that had profit-sharing terms. According to the Respondent, this was true in the contract that it acquired in 2005 from its predecessor, BCTI, in a private commercial transaction of which Turkmenistan was not aware until after MTS and BCTI had negotiated, executed, and publicly announced the deal. BCTI was the first cellular communications provider ever to operate in Turkmenistan, and its contract, entered into in 1994, required it to pay [REDACTED] of profits from its operations in Turkmenistan to the Government. MTS purchased BCTI\u2019s rights and obligations under that contract, including the profit-sharing terms.657 The Respondent emphasizes that in the same year, 2005, MTS entered into its own contract with Turkmenistan, on terms reducing the profit-sharing payment to [REDACTED]. The lawyer retained by the Claimant at the time the Claimant entered the Turkmenistan market in 2005, and its witness in this arbitration, Mr. [REDACTED] counseled MTS during the 2005 transactions. At the Hearing, questioned as to whether the profit-sharing terms in either BCTI\u2019s 1994 Agreement or MTS\u2019 2005 Agreement were illegal, [REDACTED] replied that this was certainly not the case.658 [REDACTED] did not recall any discussions or material concern that by signing the agreement in 2005, MTS or the MoC, the Turkmen parties on the other side, were doing something that was in violation of their own law. [REDACTED] confirmed that MTS made a \"commercial\" decision to enter into the 2005 Agreement, after considering various inputs, including the profit-share percentages, and a possible joint venture with Turkmenistan.659\n\nResp. PHB, \u00b6 71.\n\nResp. PHB, \u00b6 72; Resp. Reply PHB, \u00b6 16.\n\nResp. PHB, \u00b6 72.\n\n552.\n\nThe Respondent submits that [REDACTED] testified that both [REDACTED] and the Claimant understood that the absence of a specific law requiring profit-sharing did not make the profit-sharing terms of its contract illegal. The Respondent states that [REDACTED] was clear in his testimony that the Claimant would not have proceeded with the purchase of BCTI \"if there was material illegality involved in the investment\" and that [REDACTED] also confirmed that the Claimant consulted Turkmen counsel in the course of its analysis and drafting of the 2005 Agreement.660\n\nResp. Reply PHB, \u00b6 18.\n\n553.\n\nThe Respondent asserts that the Claimant admits that the profit-sharing terms agreed in the 2012 Agreement, under which MTS-TM would pay [REDACTED] to Turkmentelecom, were a continuation of the same terms under which MTS had operated under the 2005 Agreement during the period 2005-2010. The Respondent adds that, at the time that it decided to enter into the 2012 Agreement, the Claimant was advised by another international law firm, [REDACTED] which represented it in the multiple arbitrations that the Claimant brought against Turkmenistan after the 2005 Agreement was not renewed and in the negotiations for the terms and conditions of its resumption of operations in Turkmenistan.661\n\nResp. PHB, \u00b6 73.\n\n554.\n\nThe Respondent emphasizes that, contrary to the Claimant\u2019s contention, there can be no argument that MTS was coerced into agreeing to the profit-sharing terms of the 2012 Agreement. If anything, the Respondent says, it was the Claimant that was using the arbitrations brought against the Respondent after the expiry of the 2005 Agreement as leverage against the Respondent to lead the Respondent to initiate negotiations for its re-entry. The Claimant itself had demanded to renew the 2005 Agreement in 2010 on the same terms, including profit-sharing, and it again demanded to renew the 2012 Agreement in 2017 on the same terms, including profit-sharing. The Respondent submits that there is no evidence that the Claimant ever previously suggested or complained that the profit-sharing terms were illegal. If that were the case, that would mean that all of the Claimant\u2019s operations in Turkmenistan from the beginning of its entry into the market in 2005-2010, and again from 2012-2017, were conducted under \"illegal\" contracts. That would also mean that MTS is not entitled to invoke the benefits of the Russia-Turkmenistan BIT, because its investment would have been illegal ab initio.662\n\nResp. PHB, \u00b6 74.\n\n555.\n\nThe Respondent submits that, at the Hearing, MTS\u2019 witness, [REDACTED], confirmed that when MTS\u2019 Board of Directors approved the 2012 Agreement and the return to the Turkmen market, \"MTS did not disclose its belief that the 2012 Agreement or the profit-sharing arrangement therein were illegal or the result of unlawful correction\" to any of its shareholders or in its disclosures to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. This is consistent with [REDACTED] recollection, as he confirmed that, in his experience with MTS, its public disclosures under the U.S. securities laws were always \"true and complete\". The Respondent contends, in summary, that the Claimant\u2019s allegation that the profit-sharing terms were unlawful or coerced has always been an absurd, counterfactual claim that is entirely without merit.663\n\nResp. PHB, \u00b6 75.\n\n556.\n\nThe Respondent further submits that the Claimant\u2019s allegations that the profit charge was discriminatory because Altyn Asyr did not have a profit-sharing agreement is meritless, as the Claimant\u2019s own counsel acknowledged that all of Altyn Asyr\u2019s profits belonged to the State.664 The Respondent contends that the Claimant has never disputed that it was fully aware of the structure of Altyn Asyr\u2019s ownership and the differences with respect to profit-sharing when it made the informed decision - after 10 months of negotiation - to return to the Turkmen market in 2012.665 The Respondent adds that, although Altyn Asyr is a separate legal entity, the State is its ultimate shareholder (with Turkmentelecom, also a State-owned entity), and the State is entitled to distribution of Altyn Asyr\u2019s profits as it may direct, and that Altyn Asyr paid profits as dividends to its shareholders, Turkmentelecom and the Ministry of Communications.666\n\nResp.

Sur-Reply PHB, \u00b6 9.\n\n557.\n\nIn the Respondent\u2019s view the Claimant\u2019s argument is based on the absurd premise that an investor may enter into a contract forming the basis for its investment in a host State, with full knowledge and understanding of the terms and conditions under which it would operate, proceed to operate under those agreed conditions for the entire term of the contract, and then later claim that the contract was illegal and violated its rights from the beginning.667\n\nResp. Reply PHB, \u00b6 20.\n\n558.\n\nAs to quantum/damages, the Respondent submits that the Claimant\u2019s experts, Ms. Hardin and Mr. Thomas, failed to provide a credible quantification of this alleged wrongful conduct. All of Ms. Hardin\u2019s models simply assume liability on all of the measures complained of by MTS. Ms. Hardin only quantifies the effect of profit-sharing in the \"but for\" world, where cash flows are calculated on the basis of counter-factual assumptions, such as a [REDACTED] and other corrections for other wrongful acts. Mr. Thomas\u2019 model is likewise unreliable. He acknowledged that his and Ms. Hardin\u2019s calculation of the effect of profit-sharing were incompatible, and that an accurate model would require \"harmonis[ation]\" so that his calculations \"are more appropriately attached to the final version of the measures\". The Respondent argues that the Claimant has failed to offer a damages figure for the actual effect of the profit-sharing terms under real world circumstances and that accordingly, also for this reason, no damages can be awarded.668\n\nResp. PHB, \u00b6 76.\n\n***c. The Tribunal\u2019s Analysis***\n--------------------------------\n\n559.\n\nIt is the Claimant\u2019s case that the \"imposition of the profit charge\" contained in Clause 1 of the 2012 Agreement was unlawful, unfair, arbitrary and discriminatory.\n\n560.\n\nThe Tribunal has already found, in the context of the Claimant\u2019s Shutdown Claims, that the profit charge/profit-sharing under Clause 1 of the 2012 Agreement was not unlawful.669\n\n*See* Section VII.B.(2) above.\n\n561.\n\nThe Claimant\u2019s Profit Charge Claim is denied.\n\n562.\n\nClause 1 of the 2012 Agreement was freely negotiated between the Claimant and Turkmentelecom and it was for the parties to decide if and under which terms they wanted to enter into an agreement. The sharing of profits was neither unfair nor arbitrary. Furthermore, as already stated, it is an almost global standard practice that States charge companies for the opportunity to participate in the State\u2019s telecommunications market. Profit-sharing is not uncommon in the telecommunications sector.670\n\n*See* Section VII.B.(2) a. above; *see* also Dippon Report, \u00b6\u00b6 74, et seq.\n\n563.\n\nThe Tribunal is not convinced by the Claimant\u2019s argument that freely negotiated contractual terms like Clause 1 of the 2012 Agreement cannot be lawful unless they are specifically mentioned or required by legislation. In the Tribunal\u2019s view, parties to a commercial agreement are in principle free to agree to whatever commercial terms they want, such as Clause 1, including profit-sharing, unless a term is contrary to a legal prohibition (which was not the case here). This is what MTS and Turkmentelecom did by negotiating and concluding the 2012 Agreement.\n\n564.\n\nMoreover, the Tribunal does not share the Claimant\u2019s view that the profit charge was discriminatory because Altyn Asyr did not operate under a profit-sharing agreement as contained in Clause 1 of the 2012 Agreement.671 The Tribunal finds that Altyn Asyr, as a wholly State-owned company, and MTS-TM, as a privately-owned company, were not similarly situated and that the Claimant\u2019s discrimination argument fails. More particularly, all of the [REDACTED] (and not just a [REDACTED] thereof) of a wholly State-owned business like Altyn Asyr belong, in principle, to the State.672 Therefore, the Tribunal does not find that the profit-sharing provision of the 2012 Agreement was discriminatory.\n\n*See* Section VII.B.(2) a. above.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that, in the context of attribution, the Claimant itself has argued, relying on the witness statement of [REDACTED], that Altyn Asyr has no independent budget or funding, that it must be assumed that its finances are comingled with those of the State and that Altyn Asyr\u2019s revenues are transferred to the State budget, [REDACTED]\n\n565.\n\nIn addition, the Tribunal finds that the Claimant is estopped from relying on the alleged unlawfulness of the 2012 Agreement. The Claimant, with the support of counsel, freely negotiated and agreed to the 2012 Agreement (including profit-sharing) while aware of Altyn Asyr\u2019s existing ownership structure, which has not changed since Claimant\u2019s return to the Turkmen market in 2012. The Claimant then performed the 2012 Agreement and, at the end of the contract\u2019s term, requested the renewal of the 2012 Agreement (including profit-sharing). The Claimant therefore acts in a contradictory manner contrary to good faith *(venire contra factum proprium)* if the Claimant now contends that the same 2012 Agreement was unlawful as well as unfair, arbitrary and discriminatory.\n\n566.\n\nIn sum, the Claimant\u2019s Profit Charge Claim fails. The profit charge agreed between the contracting parties is neither unlawful nor unfair, arbitrary or discriminatory. As a consequence, the Tribunal finds no breach of (i) the FET standard (Article 4(1) BIT), (ii) the NT standard (Article 4(2) BIT), or (iii) the FPS standard (Article 3(3) BIT) in connection with that charge.\n\n**(2) Data Channel Capacity Claim**\n-----------------------------------\n\n567.\n\nUnder the Data Channel Capacity Claim, the Claimant argues that it received insufficient data channel capacity to conduct its business due to the Respondent\u2019s refusal to provide adequate data channel capacity. More particularly, the Claimant argues that Turkmentelecom, when allocating external data channel capacity, gave much greater capacity to Altyn Asyr than to MTS, which in the Claimant\u2019s view was unfair, arbitrary and discriminatory.\n\n***a. The Claimant\u2019s Position***\n--------------------------------\n\n568.\n\nThe Claimant argues that the Respondent\u2019s allocation of external data channel capacity between MTS-TM and Altyn Asyr constitutes a breach of (i) the FET standard (Article 4(1) BIT), (ii) the NT standard (Article 4(2) BIT), (iii) the \"all necessary approvals\" standard (Article 3(2) BIT), and (iv) the FPS standard (Article 3(3) BIT).673\n\nCl. PHB, \u00b6 40.\n\n569.\n\nThe Claimant takes the view that the Respondent\u2019s allocation of external data channel capacity breached the FET standard because it was unfair, arbitrary, non-transparent and discriminatory. The Claimant submits that Turkmentelecom, exercising a monopoly power over the distribution of external data channel capacity in Turkmenistan, consistently gave much greater capacity to its own operator Altyn Asyr (by a factor of up to at least six times), despite MTS-TM\u2019s countless pleas for access to more capacity.674\n\nCl. PHB, \u00b6 40.\n\n570.\n\nThe Claimant complains that Turkmentelecom had excess capacity at times that it did not allocate, but that every time Turkmenistan obtained additional external data capacity it gave vastly more to Altyn Asyr than to MTS-TM. The Respondent\u2019s argument that it allocated external data capacity according to the two operators\u2019 respective needs is incorrect, the Claimant says, because Turkmentelecom never requested any information from MTS-TM or Altyn Asyr (such as current and projected active subscriber numbers, average per-user data consumption, etc.) that it would have required to properly assess the operators\u2019 respective data capacity needs. In reality, the only information Turkmentelecom had concerning MTS-TM\u2019s needs was its countless pleas for access to greater data capacity, both oral and written - the vast majority of which Turkmentelecom simply ignored. When MTS-TM was finally given access to [REDACTED] its data traffic grew by [REDACTED] evidencing the strong pent-up demand for data usage from its subscribers. When MTS-TM was given access to [REDACTED], its per-user data consumption quickly rose again.675\n\nCl. PHB, \u00b6 40.\n\n571.\n\nThe Claimant refers to the Respondent\u2019s argument that the Claimant\u2019s witnesses tried to create an entirely new and fictitious narrative based on undocumented oral requests for additional external data channel capacity. [REDACTED] and was told that while the Respondent was \"unable to give us this capacity for internet connection, [...] by the first quarter of 2013, we would be able to receive the channels that we had asked for\" once they had \"revamp[ed] and modernise[d] their servers\". That is why MTS wrote to Turkmentelecom in March and April 2013 requesting [REDACTED]676\n\nCl. Sur-Reply PHB, p. 2.\n\n572.\n\nAs regards the Respondent\u2019s argument that it had no spare data channel capacity because [REDACTED] was allocated in 2016 to the Ashgabat Telephone Network for provision of broadband services, the Claimant replies that, even if true (the Claimant notes that this is not stated anywhere in Exhibit CD-0082), the previously undisclosed allocation of [REDACTED] to the ATN cannot explain similar irregularities in Exhibit CD-0082 for the years 2013, 2014 and 2015 (the Claimant submits that [REDACTED] admitted in cross- examination that if the figures in Exhibit CD-0082 were correct, they would show that the Respondent did in fact have spare capacity).677\n\nCl.

Sur-Reply PHB, p. 2.\n\n574.\n\nThe Claimant contends that it was impossible for Turkmentelecom to have allocated external data channel capacity fairly, because it never asked MTS-TM about its present or future data capacity requirements. In response to the Respondent\u2019s rebuttal that the Ministry of Communications had the capability to monitor each providers\u2019 utilization in real time, the Claimant asserts that there is no evidence that the Ministry had the capability to (or actually did) monitor MTS-TM and Altyn Asyr\u2019s data requirements in \"real time\".679\n\nCl. Sur-Reply PHB, p. 2.\n\n575.\n\nThe Claimant submits that MTS-TM did not deserve less data capacity because its data traffic was low; according to the Claimant its data traffic was low because it needed more capacity. In the Claimant\u2019s view the Respondent\u2019s refusal to provide MTS-TM with sufficient external data channel capacity was also unfair and discriminatory because it prevented MTS-TM from expanding its 3G network to all regions of Turkmenistan, as it was aiming to do as early as mid-2013, and prevented it from launching a 4G network entirely. [REDACTED] confirmed in cross-examination that anything less than [REDACTED] of external data channel capacity (i.e., [REDACTED], just over six months before the shutdown) \"wouldn\u2019t be enough\" to operate a nationwide 3G network in Turkmenistan, let alone to consider launching a 4G network.680 As far as the Respondent states that Mr. Thomas acknowledged an \"obvious flaw\" in assuming a 1:1 data capacity allocation between MTS-TM and Altyn Asyr, as this would result in MTS-TM\u2019s network being better resourced than Altyn Asyr\u2019s, the Claimant argues that Mr. Thomas said only this was \"possible\". The Claimant adds that in the \"but-for\" world, it is likely Altyn Asyr\u2019s network would have carried less data traffic due to increased competition from MTS-TM.681\n\nCl. PHB, \u00b6 40.\n\nCl. Sur-Reply PHB, p. 3.\n\n576.\n\nIn the Claimant\u2019s opinion, the Respondent\u2019s argument that Altyn Asyr had more active data subscribers than MTS-TM, and had more data traffic on its network than MTS-TM and therefore deserved more channel capacity, inherently treats MTS-TM unfairly, because it penalises MTS-TM for starting from a lower base than Altyn Asyr in 2012.682 In other words, allocating capacity according to operators\u2019 existing usage rather than their projected future needs would effectively lock MTS-TM in at a permanently lower capacity (because with limited data capacity, MTS-TM would be unable to grow its data subscribers or its data traffic), and would thus impose a permanent competitive disadvantage on MTS-TM.683\n\nCl.

Reply PHB, \u00b615.\n\n577.\n\nThe Claimant also contends that the Respondent\u2019s allocation of data channel capacity breached the NT standard because, for the reasons explained above, it treated MTS-TM and Altyn Asyr differently without any reasonable justification.684\n\nCl. PHB, \u00b6 40.\n\n578.\n\nThe Claimant takes the view that the refusal to provide sufficient external data channel capacity to MTS-TM breached the \"all necessary approvals\" standard because MTS required access to sufficient data capacity \"for the realisation of [its] permitted investmen[t]\". Without sufficient data capacity MTS was unable to develop and expand its network and provide full 3G and 4G services to its subscribers.685\n\nCl. PHB, \u00b6 40.\n\n579.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, the Respondent\u2019s allocation of external data channel capacity breached the FPS standard because the Respondent failed to protect MTS-TM\u2019s legal right to compete with Altyn Asyr on a level playing field.686\n\nCl. PHB, \u00b6 40.\n\n580.\n\nAs regards causation, the Claimant argues that there is ample evidence in the record showing that MTS-TM was harmed by the Respondent\u2019s refusal to provide it with sufficient external data channel capacity.687\n\nCl. PHB, \u00b6 41.\n\n***b. The Respondent\u2019s Position***\n----------------------------------\n\n581.\n\nThe Respondent argues that it has shown, in the written pleadings and through the testimony of both Parties\u2019 experts during the Hearing, that Turkmentelecom allocated to MTS-TM a more favourable amount of data capacity than was allocated to Altyn Asyr at all relevant times. The Respondent submits that, during the Hearing, Mr. Thomas admitted that Altyn Asyr\u2019s network was always more congested than MTS-TM\u2019s network, meaning that MTS-TM was able to offer its customers faster service and better quality than Altyn Asyr.688\n\nResp. PHB, \u00b6 78.\n\n582.\n\nThe Respondent argues that both the Claimant and the Respondent agreed in their written pleadings that the key factor determining an operator\u2019s data capacity requirements is not the raw number of subscribers on a network, but the number and size of data users on the network - in particular, the number of smartphones, as opposed to more basic feature mobile phones.689 Thus, not all data subscribers are alike. MTS\u2019 network was primarily 2G and thus its subscribers used less data.690 At the Hearing, Mr. Thomas attempted to revise his opinion, arguing that, based on the total number of subscribers, MTS was denied a fair allocation of data, stating that Altyn Asyr had 5 to 6 times more capacity than MTS but it only had [REDACTED] the number of data subscribers.691 [REDACTED] The Respondent concludes that, as a consequence, the key test is not to compare the number of data subscribers, but to compare how much data those subscribers are using (defined as \"data traffic\").692\n\nResp.

The Respondent submits that, at the Hearing, [REDACTED] The Respondent submits that [REDACTED] new recollection is unconvincing, given that in two lengthy witness statements he never disclosed or alleged that MTS made any oral requests or received any oral promises for more data capacity. The Claimant\u2019s new argument fails to explain [REDACTED] MTS further fails to explain how the Ministry of Communications would have provided MTS-TM with [REDACTED], when Mr. Thomas\u2019 Report confirms that Turkmenistan only had [REDACTED] available for the entire country in 2013.

Reply PHB, \u00b6 23.\n\n585.\n\nWith regards to the Claimant\u2019s argument that the Ministry of Communications withheld data capacity from MTS-TM notwithstanding that Turkmenistan increased its external data capacity over time, the Respondent submits that it is misguided and misleading, that Turkmenistan did not have the additional capacity to give to MTS-TM, and that there is nothing wrongful about that fact.697 The Respondent states that both experts agree that Turkmenistan increased its total external data capacity for the entire country over time, from 0.93 Gbits in 2013 to 2.64 Gbits in 2014 and then 7.49 Gbits in 2015. Turkmenistan was only able to \"significantly increase\" its external data capacity in 2016 and 2017 \u2014 reaching 10.8 Gbits for the first time in 2016 and then 21.22 Gbits in 2017. During this period, Turkmenistan allocated significant amounts of its new external data capacity to developing its broadband network, which is the primary access to internet by all devices other than mobile phones. The Respondent argues that the Claimant was aware of the Respondent\u2019s investment in broadband and nevertheless ignored this fact in favour of the allegation that the Ministry of Communications withheld up to [REDACTED] of alleged spare capacity.698 The Respondent also takes the view that the Claimant\u2019s allegations that Turkmenistan withheld spare capacity in 2016 and 2017 are irrelevant, because MTS-TM received significant and sufficient increases in its capacity in both of those years, which was confirmed by [REDACTED] es[REDACTED]ess\n\nResp.

Turkmenistan is not required to allocate its limited national resources \"equally\" in absolute terms, between unequal commercial actors.704 The Respondent asserts that Mr. Thomas acknowledged that \"in the real world\" MTS-TM\u2019s network \"would be significantly better\" than Altyn Asyr\u2019s if it were allocated the same capacity.705\n\nResp.

The Tribunal\u2019s Analysis***\n--------------------------------\n\n588.\n\nThe Claimant essentially argues that Turkmentelecom inadequately allocated external data channel capacity to MTS and consistently gave much greater capacity to Altyn Asyr than to MTS, which in the Claimant\u2019s view created an uneven playing field and was unfair, arbitrary and discriminatory.\n\n589.\n\nThe Claimant\u2019s Data Channel Capacity Claim is denied.\n\n***(a) The Claimant was not entitled to an equal (1:1) allocation of data capacity***\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n590.\n\nThe Tribunal finds that the Claimant\u2019s Data Channel Capacity Claim, which in essence is a claim for discrimination against MTS vis-\u00e0-vis Altyn Asyr, cannot be based on the proposition that the amount of data channel capacity allocated to Altyn Asyr and MTS was not the same.\n\n591.\n\nThe Claimant\u2019s claim is first based on the proposition that a fair and non-discriminatory allocation of capacity would have been an equal (i.e., 1 Mbit : 1 Mbit) allocation between MTS and Altyn Asyr. This approach, however, fails to take into account the individual situations of each company, in particular the size and the technological development of MTS-TM and Altyn Asyr. MTS-TM [REDACTED]706 Hence, it is undisputed that Altyn Asyr had a more technologically advanced network than MTS, which required more data channel capacity. In other words, MTS and Altyn Asyr were not similarly situated in terms of technological development and in terms of their resulting data channel capacity requirements.\n\nRespondent's Opening, p. 196 and 198.\n\n592.\n\nGiven that Altyn Asyr carried substantially more bits of traffic than MTS-TM [REDACTED], an \"equal\" (1 Mbit : 1 Mbit) allocation of data channel capacity would have put MTS-TM in a better (rather than an equal) position. In the Tribunal\u2019s view, this would not have been a fair and non-discriminatory allocation of data capacity. In order to prove its claim, it is therefore insufficient for MTS to focus only on the absolute amounts of data channel capacity that were allocated to MTS-TM and to Altyn Asyr.\n\n593.\n\nAlso, the contractual instruments do not support the Claimant\u2019s contention that a fair allocation can only be an equal (1:1) allocation of data channel capacity. As regards requests for additional resources, the 2012 Agreement,707 in Clause 3, provides that:\n\n[...] such resources shall be provided to the extent they fall within the documented scope of technical capabilities, and shall be of the quality, characteristics and quantity necessary at that stage of the Operator\u2019s activity in Turkmenistan [...].\n\n2012 Agreement, Clause 2, Exhibit C-0008.\n\n594.\n\nThus, the 2012 Agreement refers to \"resources [...] of the quantity necessary at that stage of the Operator\u2019s activity in Turkmenistan\" rather than to an equal (in absolute terms) allocation amongst market participants. A \"quantity necessary\" is a quantity that takes into account the individual situation, in particular, the size and the technological development of each company.\n\n595.\n\nIn the Interconnection Agreement between Turkmentelecom and MTS-TM,708 the Claimant accepted that it would start its Turkmenistan operations anew in 2012 with an external capacity of [REDACTED]709 Thus, the Claimant itself agreed to an initial allocation that gave it [REDACTED]\n\nInterconnection and Interworking Agreement No. 0013/06-3 between MTS-TM and Turkmentelecom, 9 June 2012, Schedule No. 3, Exhibit C-0130.\n\nSecond Dippon Report, \u00b6 99, table 4.\n\n596.\n\nThus the relevant test is not the absolute amount of capacity distributed between operators. What is relevant is the necessary amount of data capacity which is defined by the amount of traffic in a network. The amount of traffic does not necessarily coincide with the number of subscribers a network has, because in a technologically advanced network (with 3G and 4G technology) subscribers require more capacity and cause more data traffic than in networks with a less developed technological status.\n\n597.\n\nIn his testimony, the Respondent\u2019s expert, Mr. Thomas, confirmed that not all subscribers are equal and, in particular, that [REDACTED]\n\nQ. [...] Because the issue really is, and I think you know this: all data subscribers are not equal, are they?\n\nA. No.\n\nQ. And so if we look at this chart, we see that the traffic on Altyn Asyr\u2019s network\n\n[REDACTED]\n\nA. Yes.\n\nQ. [REDACTED]\n\nA. Yes.\n\nQ. Okay. And so that means that Altyn Asyr\u2019s network was more congested than MTS\u2019s network; correct? There was more traffic crossing Altyn Asyr\u2019s bridge than MTS\u2019s bridge?\n\nA. It had a far larger bridge. So you would have to do the calculation by available capacity to make that statement.\n\nQ. [REDACTED]\n\nA. Yes.\n\nQ. [REDACTED]\n\nQ. And it often is, because you have more traffic crossing that bridge in central London; right?\n\nA. Yes.\n\nQ. And it\u2019s the same analogy with data traffic; right?\n\nA. I follow your argument.\n\nQ. Okay. So you agree with me that at all times between 2012 and 2017 [REDACTED]\n\nA. Yes, it did.710\n\nHearing Transcript, Day 9, 122:2 - 123:14.\n\n598.\n\nMr. Thomas also confirmed that having more traffic on one network leads to a slower service for the customers:\n\nQ. [REDACTED]711\n\nHearing Transcript, Day 9, 129:23 - 130:3.\n\n599.\n\nThus, the relevant standard applied by MTS for its claim (i.e., only an equal (1:1) allocation of data capacity in absolute tenus is a fair and non-discriminatory allocation) is flawed. Neither the Treaty nor the 2012 Agreement nor the Interconnection Agreement between MTS and Turkmentelecom guarantees the allocation of data capacity equal (1:1) to Altyn Asyr without due regard to the actual needs and circumstances of the respective operators. A comparison of the absolute numbers of data channel capacity allocated to MTS-TM and Altyn Asyr is therefore insufficient to prove MTS\u2019 claim. The observation that the two parties did not receive equal allocation is therefore not proof of unfair or discriminatory treatment. Instead, fair and non-discriminatory treatment only requires that similarly situated providers receive the same access to infrastructure. Hence, the Claimant\u2019s case is flawed to the extent it is based on the proposition that the data channel capacity was not the same for MTS-TM and Altyn Asyr. They were not in the same position in all relevant respects.\n\n600.\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n601.\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n602.\n\nAs demonstrated by the Respondent\u2019s expert, Dr. Dippon, in every year between 2012 and 2017, [REDACTED] as [REDACTED]ess\n\n***(b) The different allocation of data capacity between MTS and Altyn Asyr does not violate the Claimant\u2019s rights***\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n603.\n\nMTS further claims that the difference in data capacity allocation between MTS and Altyn Asyr, i.e., that \"Turkmentelecom [...] consistently gave much greater capacity to its own operator, Altyn Asyr\",717 amounts to discrimination and unfair and arbitrary treatment even if MTS had not been entitled to the same data capacity allocation as Altyn Asyr. In view of the evidence recalled above, the Tribunal is not convinced that the actual allocation of data capacity was unfair, arbitrary or discriminatory. The fact that Altyn Asyr received more capacity than MTS does not serve as proof that the allocation of data capacity was inappropriate. More particularly, in view of the evidence that Altyn Asyr, [REDACTED] the Tribunal is not convinced that the difference in data capacity between Altyn Asyr and MTS was inappropriate and violated the Claimant\u2019s rights. This is despite the fact that there is no clear evidence regarding the principles that were followed by Turkmentelecom when allocating data capacity. The director general of Turkmentelecom, [REDACTED] was not able to explain clearly the considerations on which the allocation of data channel capacity between Altyn Asyr and MTS had been made. As to the factors relevant to a fair allocation of data capacity and MTS\u2019 requests for additional capacity, [REDACTED] was not able to say more than, [REDACTED] ess [REDACTED].719\n\nCl. PHB, \u00b6 40.\n\nHearing Transcript, Day 7, 114:3-8.\n\n604.\n\nOne might have expected the Director General of Turkmentelecom to be ready and willing to explain that the allocation of data channel capacity between Altyn Asyr and MTS had been made based on objective and reasonable considerations. [REDACTED] The Respondent\u2019s argument therefore boils down to the assertion that the data channel capacity that MTS was allocated from time to time was sufficient and appropriate for MTS\u2019 needs, thereby avoiding any discussion of how Turkmentelecom applied relevant principles and criteria. However, despite this lack of explanation on the part of Turkmentelecom, in view of the evidence on the actual allocation of data capacity to Altyn Asyr and MTS [REDACTED], the Tribunal is not convinced that the allocation of data capacity to MTS was unfair, arbitrary, or discriminatory or in any way inappropriate.\n\n605.\n\nIn sum, the Tribunal finds no evidence that the allocation of data channel capacity to MTS was unfair and discriminatory. There is no clear evidence that Altyn Asyr received a disproportionate or inappropriate amount of the available data channel capacity. Furthermore, there is no evidence that the amount of data channel capacity received by MTS-TM was inappropriately low. The evidence rather suggests that MTS-TM received a proportionally larger allocation of data channel capacity that its competitor Altyn Asyr [REDACTED]\n\n606.\n\nThus, the allocation of data channel capacity was not unfair, discriminatory, or arbitrary. As a consequence, the Tribunal finds no breach of (i) the FET standard (Article 4(1) BIT), (ii) the NT standard (Article 4(2) BIT), and (iii) the FPS standard (Article 3(3) BIT) in connection with such allocation.\n\n**(3) Data Channel Quality Claim**\n----------------------------------\n\n***a.

PHB, \u00b6 44.\n\n608.\n\nThe Claimant takes the view that the Respondent\u2019s failure to provide data channels of sufficient quality to MTS-TM breached the FET standard because it was unfair, non-transparent and discriminatory. The Claimant contends that the Respondent has no credible answer for why MTS-TM suffered prolonged outages that Altyn Asyr did not. As regards the Respondent\u2019s argument that MTS-TM and Altyn Asyr suffered equivalent disruptions, the Claimant argues that it has never denied that at the outset of the June - December 2016 outage, both MTS-TM and Altyn Asyr\u2019s networks were affected.721 The Respondent\u2019s counsel omitted to explain, however, that service on Altyn Asyr\u2019s network was restored by early July 2016, whereas MTS-TM continued to face severe disruptions for the next six months. There is no evidence, moreover, that Altyn Asyr\u2019s network was affected at all by the March - April 2016 and May - September 2017 outages.722 The Claimant further argues that Turkmenistan\u2019s failure to provide data channels of sufficient quality to MTS-TM was not limited to the three aforementioned instances (two in 2016 and one in 2017), but rather was a permanent problem between 2013 and 2017.723\n\nCl.

According to the Claimant, the Respondent\u2019s failure to provide data channels of sufficient quality to MTS-TM also breached the FPS standard because the Respondent failed to protect MTS-TM\u2019s legal right (as established, inter alia, by Article 4(1) of the Turkmen Law on Communications) to compete with Altyn Asyr on a level playing field.727\n\nCl. PHB, \u00b6 44.\n\n***b. The Respondent\u2019s Position***\n----------------------------------\n\n613.\n\nThe Respondent argues that MTS\u2019 allegations rest entirely on anecdotal evidence of three so-called \"major instances of external data quality\" disturbances that MTS-TM allegedly experienced in 2016 and 2017. However, the Claimant failed to establish that these quality issues were discriminatory or unfair compared to the data quality that Altyn Asyr\u2019s subscribers experienced.728\n\nResp. PHB, \u00b6 93.\n\n614.\n\nThe Respondent submits that, despite the fact that Mr. Thomas was instructed to review only three discrete periods of data quality complaints that had a purported impact on MTS-TM, the Claimant now alleges in its post-hearing brief that quality disruptions were \"a permanent problem\" but has failed to prove this new claim.729\n\nResp. Reply PHB, \u00b6 35.\n\n615.\n\nThe Respondent submits that there is simply no evidence that MTS suffered quality issues different or greater than Altyn Asyr. [REDACTED] es [REDACTED]731\n\nResp. Reply PHB, \u00b6 36.\n\n616.\n\nThe Respondent states that the Claimant, in its Sur-Reply PHB, on the one hand denies that Altyn Asyr\u2019s network also had prolonged quality issues during periods in which MTS-TM had none or significantly lesser quality disruptions, but at the same time admits that Altyn Asyr\u2019s network had more problems than MTS-TM in June 2016. The Respondent also submits that the Claimant ignores the Respondent\u2019s discussion of MTS-TM\u2019s letters to the Ministry of Communications in the following \"six months\" (July-December 2016) which demonstrate that Altyn Asyr continued to suffer significant quality issues. As for the Claimant\u2019s criticism that the Respondent only \"refer[s] to a single snapshot from late June/early July 2016\" to show that Altyn Asyr suffered similar quality problems, the Respondent argues that the Claimant itself focused solely on snapshots of three discrete periods of quality issues in 2016 and 2017.732\n\nResp.

PHB, \u00b6 95.\n\nResp. PHB, \u00b6 96.\n\n***c. The Tribunal\u2019s Analysis***\n--------------------------------\n\n619.\n\nThe Claimant argues that the Respondent unfairly and discriminatorily failed to provide MTS-TM data channels of sufficient quality.\n\n620.\n\nThe Claimant\u2019s Data Channel Quality Claim is denied. There is no evidence that the Respondent acted in an unfair or discriminatory manner in relation to MTS.\n\n621.\n\nFirst, whilst it is undisputed that the Claimant experienced quality issues, it is undisputed that Altyn Asyr was also affected by quality problems. When asked about data quality issues encountered by MTS-TM as compared to Altyn Asyr in June 2016, the Claimant\u2019s expert, Mr Thomas, acknowledged that Altyn Asyr had encountered more severe quality issues during that period:\n\nQ. And you can see how well [MTS\u2019] network is operating between June 7th and June 25 th; right?\n\nA. Yes.\n\nQ. That\u2019s demonstrably better than Altyn Asyr\u2019s during the same time on the last slide; right?\n\nA. Yes.\n\n[...]\n\nQ. So if you were advising Altyn Asyr, wouldn\u2019t you complain about the data quality for the first 25 days of that month, not MTS?\n\nA. If I were Altyn Asyr and I had those sorts of problems, I would be concerned, yes.736\n\nHearing Transcript, Day 9, 178:6-20.\n\n622.\n\nThus, the Tribunal is convinced that quality issues, such as outages, affected, in principle, both operators, MTS-TM and Altyn Asyr.\n\n623.\n\nSecond, in the Tribunal\u2019s view, it is not unusual that an operator may suffer from quality problems and network outages, both of which are common in the telecommunications industry and occur on even the best networks.737 That is why it is unsurprising that the parties to the Interconnection Agreement between MTS and Turkmentelecom included a [REDACTED].738 This clearly shows that the Claimant understood that quality problems could well arise during operations. It is further undisputed that MTS-TM [REDACTED] from Turkmentelecom [REDACTED] for the disruptions it complains about.739 That is [REDACTED] the Claimant has specifically [REDACTED]. To that extent, the Claimant was made whole by Turkmentelecom.\n\nSecond Dippon Report, \u00b6 ES7.\n\n[REDACTED]: [REDACTED]\n\n*See* Summary Presentation of Christian M. Dippon of 13 May 2022 (\"Dippon Presentation\"), p. 17: \"The evidence shows that MTS-TM applied for and received [...] discounts\".\n\n624.\n\nThird, there is no evidence that the Respondent acted in an unfair or discriminatory way vis-\u00e0-vis the Claimant with regard to data channel quality. The Tribunal finds that the unplanned and unintended technical outages that affected both operators (MTS-TM and Altyn Asyr) do not constitute unfair and discriminatory treatment by the Respondent. There is no further evidence, e.g., that the outages affecting MTS were arranged on purpose or that repairs affecting MTS were deliberately carried out too slowly, etc. The Claimant, in any event, does not point to such evidence. The fact that MTS-TM may (or may not) have experienced more outages that Altyn Asyr in itself does not suffice to demonstrate unfair or discriminatory treatment.\n\n625.\n\nFinally, there is no evidence that the alleged quality problems had any impact on MTS-TM\u2019s operations.\n\n626.\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n627.\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n628.\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n629.\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n630.\n\nIn sum, the Tribunal finds no evidence of discriminatory or unfair treatment of MTS-TM. A certain level of outages or quality problems normally needs to be taken into account (not only in Turkmenistan) and does not represent a violation of the Claimant\u2019s treaty rights. Furthermore, the parties to [REDACTED]. [REDACTED] Finally, both operators, including Altyn Asyr, were affected by quality issues and hence there is no evidence that MTS suffered a competitive disadvantage.\n\n631.\n\nConsequently, since the Tribunal finds no evidence of the unfair or discriminatory behaviour alleged by the Claimant, the Tribunal finds that this claim has to be denied.\n\n**(4) Data Channel Tariffs Claim**\n----------------------------------\n\n***a. The Claimant\u2019s Position***\n--------------------------------\n\n632.\n\nThe Claimant contends that the Respondent\u2019s imposition of exorbitant and discriminatory tariffs on MTS-TM for the lease of both domestic and external data channels constitutes a breach of (i) the FET standard (Article 4(1) BIT), (ii) the NT standard (Article 4(2) BIT), and (iii) the FPS standard (Article 3(3) BIT).746\n\nCl. PHB, \u00b6 48.\n\n633.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, the data channel tariffs imposed on MTS-TM breached the FET standard because they were unfair, arbitrary, non-transparent and discriminatory (and, ultimately, expropriatory). The tariffs imposed by Turkmenistan acting through the Ministry of Communications to lease domestic data channels were exorbitant and bore no relationship to Turkmentelecom\u2019s costs in providing these channels. The Claimant submits that it is a fundamental departure from generally accepted global practices that the tariffs for domestic data channels were set by the Ministry of Communications not to cover Turkmentelecom\u2019s costs, but rather (i) to subsidise the provision of unrelated services (e.g., landline telephones), and (ii) to ensure that Turkmentelecom generated its planned revenues for the State budget.747\n\nCl. PHB, \u00b6 48.\n\n634.\n\nThe Claimant further argues that, in addition to being unfair, arbitrary and non-transparent, the tariffs for domestic data channels imposed on MTS-TM were also discriminatory (and thus in further violation of the FET standard). The Claimant submits that Altyn Asyr was granted [REDACTED] that was not made available to MTS-TM. Furthermore, in September 2015, at the same time as the Ministry of Communications raised tariffs for domestic data channels by 30%, it established a [REDACTED] that only Altyn Asyr qualified for - thereby compensating Altyn Asyr for the [REDACTED] The Claimant states that, given Turkmentelecom\u2019s refusal to grant MTS-TM sufficient external data channel capacity, it would not have made commercial sense for MTS-TM to lease the amount of domestic data channel capacity required to qualify for the discount. The Claimant says it could not afford to use those discounts because it was unable to lease the required number of channels. According to the Claimant, by 2017, Altyn Asyr was enjoying a [REDACTED], while MTS-TM was receiving a discount of 0%. Given that only Altyn Asyr could qualify for the discounts, that meant that the discounts served to limit Altyn Asyr\u2019s costs, while ensuring that only MTS-TM paid the full increased tariff. The Claimant argues that the Respondent has made no attempt to justify the excessively high tariffs set by the Ministry of Communications or to explain [REDACTED] testimony that by 2017, Altyn Asyr was paying [REDACTED] as MTS-TM to access [REDACTED] channel capacity.748\n\nCl. PHB, \u00b6 48.\n\n635.\n\nThe Claimant disputes the Respondent\u2019s assertions that the same tariffs and discounts for domestic data channels applied equally to both MTS-TM and Altyn Asyr, and that MTS-TM\u2019s inability to benefit from the discounts enjoyed by Altyn Asyr was due to its own commercial decision not to lease sufficient domestic data channels from Turkmentelecom. The Claimant refers in this respect to the testimony of [REDACTED] who explained that it would have been commercially irrational for MTS-TM to have leased the domestic data channel capacity required to reach the discount threshold when its external data channel capacity was so restricted. [REDACTED]749 The Claimant contends that the discriminatory nature of the discounts is further highlighted by the fact that they were originally offered only to Altyn Asyr, before the Respondent apparently realised the obviousness of this discriminatory treatment and amended the discounts to make them facially, but not economically, available to both operators.750\n\nA velayat is an administrative division of Turkmenistan.\n\nCl. Reply PHB, \u00b6 25.\n\n636.\n\nThe Claimant further submits that the tariffs imposed on MTS-TM to lease external data channels (which, as [REDACTED] confirmed during cross-examination, were also set by the Ministry of Communications) were equally unfair, arbitrary, non-transparent and discriminatory. While the Respondent\u2019s wholesale cost of purchasing external internet capacity from abroad [REDACTED], the tariffs imposed on MTS-TM to lease external data channel capacity remained unchanged over this entire period. [REDACTED]751 According to the Claimant, in addition to being unfair and arbitrary, the tariffs were also discriminatory, as Altyn Asyr was paying just [REDACTED] external data channel capacity as MTS-TM (using better quality data channels).752\n\nCl.

PHB, \u00b6 48.\n\nCl. Sur-Reply PHB, p. 3\n\n638.\n\nLastly, the Claimant submits that the data channel tariffs imposed on MTS-TM also breached the NT standard, because they treated MTS-TM and Altyn Asyr differently without any reasonable justification. The Claimant also contends that the data channel tariffs imposed on MTS-TM breached the FPS standard because the Respondent failed to protect MTS-TM\u2019s legal right to compete with Altyn Asyr on a level playing field.755\n\nCl. PHB, \u00b6 48.\n\n***b. The Respondent\u2019s Position***\n----------------------------------\n\n639.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the data channel tariff rates apply to both operators, Altyn Asyr and MTS-TM, and were therefore not discriminatory.756\n\nResp. PHB, \u00b6 99.\n\n640.\n\nAs regards discounts, the Respondent argues that the Claimant was fully informed that there was a discount matrix that varied depending on the volume of leased channels, and that the Claimant\u2019s inability to obtain those discounts was due to its own commercial and technical decisions.757 Therefore, it was the Claimant\u2019s own business strategy - and not any discriminatory conduct by the Respondent - that prevented it from benefitting from the discounts available to both operators. [REDACTED]758\n\nResp. PHB, \u00b6 99.\n\nResp. Reply PHB, \u00b6 41.\n\n641.\n\nThe Respondent says that MTS\u2019 allegation that the data channel prices in Turkmenistan are high by international standards is based on irrelevant international benchmarks for submarine cables and is also based solely on three price points from Belarus and Uzbekistan, which are also irrelevant.759\n\nResp. PHB, \u00b6 100.\n\n642.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the BIT does not require State-owned entities to operate as non-profit enterprises, so the fact that Turkmentelecom made a profit is irrelevant.760 In the Respondent\u2019s view, the BIT does not prohibit Turkmentelecom from making a profit in its activities in Turkmenistan, or reinvesting that profit into development of landline broadband services in the country.761 With regard to the Claimant\u2019s allegation that the 2017 tariff increase was implemented to maintain Turkmentelecom\u2019s level of profitability, the Respondent explains that Turkmentelecom planned to generate a profit in 2017, but the profit decreased year on year, and the projected profit excluded capital expenditures which the projected profit would not have been enough to cover.762 Insofar as the Claimant argues that capital expenditures have nothing to do with Turkmentelecom\u2019s overall profitability, the Respondent replies that CAPEX obviously affects profitability and that Ms. Hardin\u2019s own calculation of lost profits deducts CAPEX from the Claimant\u2019s projected revenues.763 The Respondent further asserts that there is nothing contradictory about [REDACTED] testimony that increasing tariffs was necessary to maintain Turkmentelecom\u2019s profitability in 2017, when Turkmentelecom\u2019s projected net profits would not have been enough to cover expected capital expenditures.764\n\nResp.

Reply PHB, \u00b6 38.\n\n644.\n\nThe Respondent states that the Claimant has also failed to establish the quantum of this claim. None of Ms. Hardin\u2019s models quantifies the individual impact of data channel prices. Mr. Thomas also fails to provide any reasonable analysis of his allocator\u2019s quantification of this claim, and his indicative weights in the allocator are unreliable.766\n\nResp. PHB, \u00b6 101.\n\n***c. The Tribunal\u2019s Analysis***\n--------------------------------\n\n645.\n\nThe Claimant complains that the imposition of tariffs by the Respondent for the lease of data channels was unfair, arbitrary and discriminatory and that Turkmentelecom charged MTS-TM exorbitant prices for channel capacity.\n\n646.\n\nThe Claimant\u2019s Channel Tariff Claim is denied.\n\n647.\n\nThere is no evidence of a discriminatory imposition of tariffs or of excessive tariff rates.\n\n648.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that there were two price changes during the 2012-2017 period.767 The first price change occurred in October 2015, when the Respondent created a separate tariff for mobile wireless access to communication channels. The second price change occurred in July 2017. In both instances MTS-TM and Altyn Asyr were subject to the same price schedules.768\n\n*See* Thomas Report, \u00b6 9.18, Figure 9-3.\n\nSecond Dippon Report, \u00b6 ES6; [REDACTED]\n\n649.\n\nThis was acknowledged by the Claimant\u2019s witness, [REDACTED] who confirmed in his testimony that the same tariff rates applied to both operators:\n\nQ. [...] Take a look at paragraph 62 of your second witness statement. Here you acknowledge that the same tariff rates apply to both operators; right?\n\nA. Yes, so in my witness statement I did mention that. [...].769\n\nHearingTranscript, Day 2, 114:19-22.\n\n650.\n\nAs regards the tariff increase on 1 October 2015, this was, strictly speaking, not a tariff increase but the introduction of a new category of tariff for cellular operators which did not exist before.770 In September 2015, Altyn Asyr and MTS were notified about the new policy and neither entity complained about the new tariff policy; in October 2015, the new tariff policy came into effect. The new tariff rates were, on average, 30-33% higher than the rates for the previous categories.771\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n651.\n\nBy letters dated 1 June 2017, MTS and Altyn Asyr were notified by Turkmentelecom about the tariff increase taking effect from 1 July 2017 onwards.772 The new tariff, again, equally applied to both Altyn Asyr and MTS. The increased tariff remained in force (and thus applicable to Altyn Asyr) long after MTS had left the market in Turkmenistan in 2017.\n\n*See* Letter No. 1244 from Turkmentelecom to MTS-TM, 1 June 2017, Exhibit C-0263, and Letter No. 1243 from Turkmentelecom to Altyn Asyr, 1 June 2017, Exhibit R-0102.\n\n652.\n\nMoreover, given that MTS stopped operating in Turkmenistan at the end of September 2017, i.e., 90 days after the 2017 price increase, it seems unlikely that the price increase could have had a substantial negative impact on MTS\u2019 operations in Turkmenistan.\n\n653.\n\nContrary to the Claimant\u2019s argument, there is no evidence of a connection between the 2017 price increase and the course of contract negotiations and the Claimant\u2019s unwillingness to accept Turkmentelecom\u2019s terms of future cooperation that were allegedly discussed during a meeting which took place on 31 May 2017.773 Given that a new tariff policy takes some time to be prepared and to be put into effect, the Tribunal is not convinced that such a price increase was implemented literally overnight, given that on 1 June 2017 notifications were sent to both operators, MTS and Altyn Asyr.774 Moreover, the new tariff applied equally to Altyn Asyr, which excludes the hypothesis that MTS was specifically targeted by the new tariff.775\n\n*See* Cl. Mem., \u00b6 304.\n\n*See* Letter No. 1244 from Turkmentelecom to MTS-TM, 1 June 2017, Exhibit C-0263, and Letter No. 1243 from Turkmentelecom to Altyn Asyr, 1 June 2017, Exhibit R-0102. *See* also [REDACTED] \u00b6 31, on the internal approval process for that price increase.\n\nThe new tariff continued to apply to Altyn Asyr after MTS had left the Turkmen market in 2017.\n\n654.\n\nAs regards the availability of discounts on channel prices, the Tribunal notes that discounts for bulk services were generally available to both operators, i.e., to MTS and Altyn Asyr, if the respective operator leased channels in a certain amount to other users. Although the Claimant alleges that MTS was excluded from discounts on intercity data channels, [REDACTED] testified that MTS was informed that there was a discount matrix that was applied depending on the volume of leased channels:\n\nQ. You said [...]:\n\n\"We know that there was a discount matrix that was applied depending on the volume of [REDACTED] ...\"\n\nAnd then you said (page 67, lines 6 to 8):\n\nSpecifically, to obtain a [REDACTED]\n\nAnd then you discussed [REDACTED] that was supposedly provided; right? You said all that on direct examination.\n\nA. Yes, I confirm that.776\n\nHearing Transcript, Day 2, 115:13-23.\n\n655.\n\nFurthermore, it appears from [REDACTED] testimony that the Claimant\u2019s inability to obtain those discounts was due to its own commercial and technical decisions, [REDACTED] es[REDACTED]\n\n656.\n\nIndeed, the Claimant confirms that it decided not to \"lease the amount of domestic data channel capacity required to qualify for the discount\" because it \"would not have made commercial sense\".779\n\nCl. PHB, \u00b6 48.\n\n657.\n\nHence, the Tribunal finds that it was first and foremost owing to MTS\u2019 own commercial decision that MTS was not in a position to benefit from those discounts.\n\n658.\n\nAs regards the Claimant\u2019s argument that due to the Respondent\u2019s (alleged) refusal to grant sufficient data channel it would not have made commercial sense for MTS to lease the number of data channels required to qualify for the discount, the Tribunal has already stated above in the context of the Claimant\u2019s Data Channel Capacity Claim that there is no evidence that MTS received a disproportionately low amount of data channel capacity.780\n\n*See* Section VII.C.(2) c. above.\n\n659.\n\nIn addition, [REDACTED]781\n\nHearing Transcript, Day 6, 87:9-11.\n\n660.\n\nIn light of this evidence the Tribunal is not convinced that MTS was specifically excluded from receiving discounts.\n\n661.\n\nOver and above that, the Tribunal finds that there is insufficient evidence that the tariffs were exorbitant.\n\n662.\n\nThe Tribunal is not convinced that the channel lease prices were excessive or that MTS was unaware of the general level of these prices when it re-entered the Turkmen market. Rather to the contrary, MTS explicitly agreed to them when negotiating and agreeing to the Interconnection Agreement with Turkmentelecom in 2012.782\n\nSecond Dippon Report, \u00b6 111.\n\n663.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that Mr. Thomas only examined three price points (two from Belarus and one from Uzbekistan) to reach the conclusion that channel prices in Turkmenistan were unreasonably high and not reflective of common international practice.783 The Tribunal concurs with the Respondent\u2019s expert, Dr. Dippon, that no trend or conclusion can be drawn from a sample of three prices only.784\n\nThomas Report, \u00b6\u00b6 8.34, 8.36, 8.39, Figure 8-4.\n\nSecond Dippon Report, \u00b6 108.\n\n664.\n\nIn addition, the Tribunal finds that the fact that Turkmentelecom may have made a profit on the lease of data channels is irrelevant. The BIT does not require State-owned entities to operate as non-profit enterprises. Thus, there is nothing wrong in Turkmentelecom using its revenues/profits to invest and to develop its infrastructure, such as landline services in the country.\n\n665.\n\nFurthermore, the tariffs applied equally to MTS and Altyn Asyr, so that they gave no competitive advantage to Altyn Asyr over MTS.\n\n666.\n\nThere is no evidence of discriminatory or of excessive, unfair tariffs imposed on MTS. Tariffs were equally applied to all operators; thus, it appears that Altyn Asyr was not treated more favourably than MTS.\n\n667.\n\nIn sum, the Respondent\u2019s setting of tariffs has not been shown to have been unfair, arbitrary or discriminatory and there is insufficient evidence of exorbitant tariffs. Hence, there is no showing of any breach by the Respondent under the Treaty in connection with these tariffs.\n\n**(5) Import Permits Claim**\n----------------------------\n\n668.\n\nUnder this claim the Claimant argues that the Respondent during the 2015 - 2017 period unjustifiably delayed und refused the Claimant\u2019s applications for import permits and that such refusals were unfair, arbitrary and discriminatory. According to the Claimant, these applications related to the import of base stations, radio relay links and other electronic equipment.785\n\nCl. Sur-Reply PHB, p. 4.\n\n***a. The Claimant\u2019s Position***\n--------------------------------\n\n669.\n\nThe Claimant submits that the Respondent\u2019s unjustified delays in dealing with, and refusals of, MTS-TM\u2019s applications for import permits constitute a breach of (i) the FET standard (Article 4(1) BIT), (ii) the NT standard (Article 4(2) BIT), (iii) the \"all necessary approvals\" standard (Article 3(2) BIT), and (iv) the FPS standard (Article 3(3) BIT).786\n\nCl. PHB, \u00b6 51.\n\n670.\n\nThe Claimant takes the view that the said unjustified delays and refusals breached the FET standard because they were unfair, arbitrary, non-transparent and discriminatory. The Claimant argues that the Respondent has put forward no explanation or justification for its repeated obstruction of MTS-TM\u2019s attempts to import equipment into Turkmenistan. The Claimant contends that the Respondent\u2019s conduct was also discriminatory (and thus in further violation of the FET standard) as Altyn Asyr never had a single application for an import permit rejected and has not encountered any significant problems with import of its equipment. The Claimant argues that the Respondent failed to treat MTS-TM and Altyn Asyr equally with respect to applications for import permits.787\n\nCl. PHB, \u00b6 51.\n\n671.\n\nInsofar as the Respondent states that all of the Claimant\u2019s applications in 2012, 2013 and 2014 were properly processed, the Claimant argues that 17 of its requests to Turkmentelecom for permits to deliver and install new equipment were denied in 2012 and 2013 alone,788 which caused MTS-TM to fall behind its investment and development schedule even at this early juncture, impacting in particular MTS-TM\u2019s ability to develop its 3G network.789 The Claimant also denies the Respondent\u2019s statement that the Claimant has confirmed that every single one of MTS-TM\u2019s import permit applications made during the entire 5-year term of the 2012 Agreement was approved; the Claimant submits that three of its applications were rejected without any explanation.790\n\nCl.

In the Claimant\u2019s view the Respondent has never presented any serious attempt to justify its arbitrary and discriminatory treatment of MTS-TM with respect to import permits.791\n\nCl. Sur-Reply PHB, p. 4.\n\n673.\n\nThe Claimant states that the Respondent\u2019s unjustified delays in dealing with, and refusals of, MTS-TM\u2019s applications for import permits breached the NT standard because they treated MTS-TM and Altyn Asyr differently without any reasonable justification. The Respondent also breached the \"all necessary approvals\" standard because MTS required these import permits for the realisation of its permitted investment. Finally, the Claimant takes the view that the said unjustified delays and refusals breached the FPS standard because the Respondent failed (i) to protect MTS-TM\u2019s legal right to compete with Altyn Asyr on a level playing field, and (ii) to protect MTS-TM\u2019s legal right to obtain import permits for its equipment in accordance with proper legal process.792\n\nCl. PHB, \u00b651.\n\n***b. The Respondent\u2019s Position***\n----------------------------------\n\n674.\n\nThe Respondent underscores that the Claimant\u2019s complaints are limited to only four permits, all of which were submitted in late 2015-2016, and all of which were - like all other import permit applications MTS-TM made during the 5-year term of the 2012 Agreement - ultimately approved. According to the Respondent, all of MTS\u2019 applications in 2012, 2013 and 2014 were properly processed.793\n\nResp. PHB, \u00b6 110; Resp. Reply PHB, \u00b6 50; Resp. Sur-Reply PHB, \u00b6 20.\n\n675.\n\nThe Respondent asserts that the delay in processing these four permit applications in 2015 and 2016 had no material impact on MTS-TM\u2019s operations under the 2012 Agreement or on its ability to develop its network in Turkmenistan during that time.794\n\nResp. Reply PHB, \u00b6 51.\n\n676.\n\nThe Respondent states that the Claimant\u2019s expert, Mr. Thomas, acknowledged that MTS-TM\u2019s own logistics schedule for new equipment (from contracting with the manufacturer to testing and commissioning) meant that there was at least a 10-month lag time between the import of equipment and its commissioning to active use in its operations,795 and that MTS cannot establish that the delay of four permits in late 2015-2016 negatively impacted its operations in Turkmenistan.796 None of the equipment requested in the delayed permits would have been utilized until the very late stages of MTS-TM\u2019s operations in Turkmenistan - in late 2016 and 2017,797 four years after MTS-TM launched operations [REDACTED]798\n\nResp.

PHB, \u00b6112.\n\n677.\n\nThe Respondent further argues that the record demonstrates that, before MTS decided to re-enter the Turkmen market in 2012, it knew and expressed the opinion that there were regulatory difficulties relating to import permits in Turkmenistan, and that it believed this to be the result of low budgets. The Respondent maintains that an investor is not entitled to a perfect regulatory environment in a host State and that this principle is especially relevant when the investor is aware of the particular concerns relating to that environment before making its investment and when the Claimant expected a degree of inefficiency in the permitting process when it made its decision to enter the Turkmen market.799\n\nResp. Reply PHB, \u00b6 52.\n\n678.\n\nIn the Respondent\u2019s view, it is impossible to reconcile the allegation that these permits negatively impacted MTS-TM with the contradictory testimony of MTS\u2019 own witness [REDACTED]800\n\nResp. PHB, \u00b6113.\n\n679.\n\nThe Respondent further argues that none of Ms. Hardin\u2019s models quantifies the individual impact of the alleged delays in permits, nor does Mr. Thomas\u2019 allocator. Moreover, there is no evidence that MTS-TM suffered any harm.801\n\nResp. PHB, \u00b6114.\n\n680.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the Claimant\u2019s attempts to re-focus its claim on two of the delayed applications relating to \"radio relay links\" and domestic permits for installation of equipment fails as the Claimant has never attempted to prove or quantify the impact of these issues. Also in this context, the Respondent asserts that at no time did Mr. Thomas calculate the effect of any purported delay of radio relay links or installation permits as he only purported to calculate the damage caused by the delay in the import permits of base stations. For this reason alone, the belatedly revised claim must also fail.802\n\nResp. Reply PHB, \u00b6 53.\n\n***c. The Tribunal\u2019s Analysis***\n--------------------------------\n\n681.\n\nThe Claimant\u2019s Import Pennits Claim argues that Respondent unjustifiably delayed the processing of and/or refused the Claimant\u2019s applications for import permits, which delays and refusals were unfair, arbitrary and discriminatory in the Claimant\u2019s view.\n\n682.\n\nThe Claimant\u2019s Import Permits Claim is denied.\n\n683.\n\nThere is insufficient evidence to show that any delay in granting a minor number of applications may actually have had an impact on MTS\u2019 operations.\n\n684.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that all of Claimant\u2019s applications for import permits were granted. Hence there was no \"refusal\" to grant any import permit.\n\n685.\n\nAs regards the alleged delays in the application process, the Claimant\u2019s witness, [REDACTED] identified only four import permits applied for in 2016 that were materially delayed out of 30 permits applied for between 2012 and 2017, all of which were granted.803\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n686.\n\nThe Tribunal is unable to conclude that the delays in 2016 in approving permits for import of equipment had any material impact on MTS\u2019 operations or put MTS at a competitive disadvantage.\n\n687.\n\nThere is a considerable time span between an application for an import permit for new equipment and the delivery and commissioning of such equipment into active use in operations. Due to this time lag between obtaining a license for the import of equipment and its commissioning, none of the equipment requested in the delayed permits would have been put into service until late 2016 or 2017. Thus, it is unlikely that any of the equipment that was the subject of the delayed permits would have been utilized before the very late stages of MTS\u2019 operations in Turkmenistan, thereby reducing the potential impact of those delays.\n\n688.\n\nThe Tribunal has seen no evidence of any material impact of the alleged delays on the Claimant\u2019s operations in Turkmenistan.\n\n689.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that neither Ms. Hardin nor Mr. Thomas addressed this claim in then-expert reports.\n\n690.\n\nNone of Ms. Hardin\u2019s models quantifies the impact of the individual measures, such as the impact of the alleged delays regarding import permits. At the Hearing Ms. Hardin confirmed that she did not quantify the impact of the individual measures:\n\nQ. Okay. But if it\u2019s not in your report, then we can\u2019t \u2014 the Tribunal can\u2019t tell how you quantify that, can we?\n\nA. Well, I don\u2019t quantify the individual measures.804\n\nHearing Transcript, Day 5, 116:3-6.\n\n691.\n\nMr. Thomas did not include this claim his first expert report. At the Hearing he testified that he was not asked to look at the issue of import permits:\n\nQ. In your July 2020 report there\u2019s no mention of import permits, is there?\n\nA. No, I wasn\u2019t asked to look at import permits specifically.805\n\nHearing Transcript, Day 9, 145:25-146:2.\n\n692.\n\nAs regards Mr. Thomas\u2019 allocator tool, Mr. Thomas described it in this testimony as \"hardly scientific\".806 He also testified that his methodology was not prepared \"with the degree of precision that you would like in these circumstances\" and that his goal was \"to provide the Tribunal with something that allows them to do anything other than a binary decision\":\n\nQ. Right, so then how can we simply trust that we are going to take an allocation that you have given from one and simply apply it blanket to Ms Hardin\u2019s model? It clearly doesn\u2019t work, or it would have worked with profit-sharing, wouldn\u2019t it?\n\nA. Well, I go back to what I said in my original report, which is it is very difficult to produce something with the degree of precision that you would ideally like in these circumstances. That\u2019s not the world we\u2019re living in. What I\u2019m trying to do is to provide the Tribunal with something that allows them to do anything other than a binary decision as to whether all the measures are in or all the measures are out.807\n\nHearing Transcript, Day 9, 92:18-24.\n\nHearing Transcript, Day 9, 83:25-84:11.\n\n693.\n\nTherefore, the Tribunal is not convinced that Mr. Thomas\u2019 allocator tool provides sufficient evidence of the impact of the permit delays that are the subject of this claim (or of the other historical claims).\n\n694.\n\nThe Tribunal also finds no evidence that the Claimant lost any competitive advantage or incurred other harm because of any import permit delays. In order to show a claim-specific impact, the Claimant would have to show that the Respondent prevented the Claimant from deploying certain infrastructure at a specific period in time that in turn decreased its competitiveness relative to Altyn Asyr; the Claimant would also have to provide data as to how customers reacted to such delays.808 The Claimant has provided no such evidence.\n\n*See* Second Dippon Report, \u00b6\u00b6 158-160.\n\n695.\n\nAs consequence, the Claimant\u2019s claim based on import permit delays is dismissed.\n\n**(6) Access to VPN Claim**\n---------------------------\n\n696.\n\nUnder this claim, the Claimant complains that it could not obtain the infrastructure that would have enabled it to provide international data roaming services to its subscribers. The Claimant argues that the Respondent ignored numerous of the Claimant\u2019s requests to access a VPN to provide data roaming services without any justification, while Altyn Asyr was (allegedly) provided access to VPN channels. MTS deems this unfair and discriminatory.\n\n***a. The Claimant\u2019s Position***\n--------------------------------\n\n697.\n\nThe Claimant argues that the Respondent\u2019s refusal to allow MTS-TM to access a VPN constituted a breach of (i) the FET standard (Article 4(1) BIT), (ii) the NT standard (Article 4(2) BIT), (iii) the \"all necessary approvals\" standard (Article 3(2) BIT), and (iv) the FPS standard (Article 3(3) BIT).809\n\nCl. PHB, \u00b6 56.\n\n698.\n\nThe Claimant states that the Respondent\u2019s refusal to allow MTS-TM to access a VPN breached the FET standard because it was unfair, arbitrary, non-transparent and discriminatory. According to the Claimant, the Respondent ignored MTS-TM\u2019s numerous requests to access a VPN without any reason or justification. MTS-TM\u2019s only alternative to using a VPN for data roaming was to provide direct connection, point to point. But at that time it was very difficult to implement this technologically, and MTS-TM did not receive permission for that either. The Respondent\u2019s refusal to allow MTS-TM to access a VPN was also discriminatory (and thus in further violation of the FET standard), because Altyn Asyr was permitted to access a VPN while MTS-TM was not.810\n\nCl. PHB, \u00b6 56.\n\n699.\n\nThe Claimant acknowledges that [REDACTED] from Altyn Asyr explained that Altyn Asyr did not use a VPN, but used other protocols, without stating what these secure protocols were.811 What matters is that access to secure network protocols within its data channel is exactly what MTS-TM requested from Turkmentelecom (and was denied) as early as July 2012.

It also breached the \"all necessary approvals\" standard because MTS required access to a VPN for the realisation of its investment. Finally, the Respondent\u2019s refusal to grant MTS-TM access to a VPN breached the FPS standard, because the Respondent failed to protect MTS-TM\u2019s legal right to compete with Altyn Asyr on a level playing field. According to the Claimant MTS-TM was harmed by the Respondent\u2019s refusal to allow it to access a VPN.814\n\nCl. PHB, \u00b6 56.\n\n***b. The Respondent\u2019s Position***\n----------------------------------\n\n701.\n\nThe Respondent notes that the Claimant alleges that MTS-TM was denied access to VPN to provide data roaming while Altyn Asyr was allegedly provided such access. The [REDACTED]815 Following the resumption of its operations in September 2012, MTS-TM did not request access to VPN (or any alternatives for data roaming) until 2015.816 In any event, MTS could have provided roaming services by direct connection, point to point, which renders this claim moot.817 Thus, the Respondent submits that MTS\u2019 [REDACTED] agreed that MTS-TM could have obtained without Turkmentelecom a similar \"direct connection, point to point\".818 With regard to the Claimant\u2019s argument that it was not possible for MTS-TM to provide data roaming via alternatives to VPN, because MTS-TM did not get permission for those either, the Respondent argues that there is no evidence that MTS-TM requested permission to provide VPN through any alternative means.819\n\nResp.

Reply PHB, \u00b6 47.\n\nResp. Sur-Reply PHB, \u00b6 19.\n\n703.\n\nThe Respondent argues that none of Ms. Hardin\u2019s models quantifies the individual impact of the VPN data roaming claim and that Mr. Thomas also fails to prove any reasonable analysis of his allocator\u2019s quantification of this claim, and his indicative weights in the allocator are unreliable. Moreover, there is no evidence of damage to MTS from this alleged measure.822 Thus, the Respondent submits that Mr. Thomas agreed that there was no evidence to establish any impact on MTS due to its inability to offer VPN data roaming. Mr. Thomas allocated a random percentage of [REDACTED] without any explanation or justification for using these dissimilar markets as benchmarks for hypothetical VPN revenues in Turkmenistan. The Respondent submits that Mr. Thomas\u2019 lack of analysis and factual support renders this claim totally unsubstantiated.823\n\nResp. PHB, \u00b6 108.\n\nResp. Reply PHB, \u00b6 49.\n\n***c. The Tribunal\u2019s Analysis***\n--------------------------------\n\n704.\n\nThe Claimant\u2019s Access to VPN Claim complains that the Claimant could not obtain the infrastructure that would have enabled it to provide international data roaming to its subscribers, which the Claimant deems unfair and discriminatory.\n\n705.\n\nThe Claimant\u2019s Access to VPN Claim is denied.\n\n706.\n\nThe Tribunal finds insufficient evidence to support this claim. To establish the claim-specific impact of its VPN claim, the Claimant would need to demonstrate that it lost profits or market share from subscribers that intended to use VPN services provided by MTS as the result of some act or omission of the Respondent. The Claimant would also need to demonstrate how much international incoming traffic was lost due to the absence of a VPN.824 The Claimant has provided no such evidence.\n\nSecond Dippon Report, \u00b6163.\n\n707.\n\nMs. Hardin does not quantify the individual impact of the VPN Claim.\n\n708.\n\nMr. Thomas\u2019 allocator\u2019s indicative weight is not fully reliable. Mr. Thomas himself stated at the Hearing that his methodology was not prepared \"with the degree of precision that you would like in these circumstances\" and that his goal was \"to provide the Tribunal with something that allows them to do anything other than a binary decision [...]\".825\n\nHearing Transcript, Day 9, 83:25-84:11.\n\n709.\n\nFurthermore, Mr. Thomas\u2019 allocator assumes that MTS\u2019 revenues [REDACTED] These markets are hardly comparable.826\n\nSecond Dippon Report, \u00b6 132.\n\n710.\n\nLastly, it is undisputed that Altyn Asyr did not use VPN during the period from 2012 until 2017, which means that in practice MTS did not suffer any competitive disadvantage vis-\u00e0-vis Altyn Asyr.\n\n711.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the Claimant\u2019s list of \"five key unlawful measures\" (Annex I to the Claimant\u2019s PHB) does not include the VPN Claim.\n\n712.\n\nIn sum, the Tribunal finds that there is insufficient evidence to support this claim.\n\n**(7) Sale of Handsets Claim**\n------------------------------\n\n713.\n\nUnder this claim, the Claimant alleges a discriminatory and unfair prohibition against its sale of handsets. The Claimant argues that the Respondent removed the Claimant\u2019s right to sell handsets from its charter in 2015, and that such removal was unfair and discriminatory and breached the Claimant\u2019s right to all necessary approvals for the realisation of its investment.\n\n***a. The Claimant\u2019s Position***\n--------------------------------\n\n714.\n\nThe Claimant argues that the Respondent\u2019s removal of MTS-TM\u2019s right to sell handsets constitutes a breach of (i) the FET standard (Article 4(1) BIT), (ii) the NT standard (Article 4(2) BIT), (iii) the \"all necessary approvals\" standard (Article 3(2) BIT), and (iv) the FPS standard (Article 3(3) BIT).827\n\nCl. PHB, \u00b6 59.\n\n715.\n\nThe Claimant takes the view that the Respondent\u2019s removal of the right to sell handsets from MTS-TM\u2019s charter breached the FET standard, because it was unfair, arbitrary, non-transparent and discriminatory. The Claimant asserts that the Respondent has provided no explanation, let alone justification, for removing MTS-TM\u2019s right to sell handsets in 2015, and that such conduct is the definition of arbitrariness and non-transparency.828\n\nCl. PHB, \u00b6 59.\n\n716.\n\nAt the conclusion of the Parties\u2019 opening submissions on Day 1 of the Hearing, the President of the Tribunal asked the Respondent\u2019s counsel to provide an explanation on Day 2 for why MTS-TM\u2019s right to sell handsets was removed from its charter. The Respondent was unable to do so. The Claimant takes the view that the Respondent\u2019s removal of MTS-TM\u2019s right to sell handsets was also discriminatory (and thus in further violation of the FET standard), because Altyn Asyr continued at all times to be authorised to sell handsets. The Respondent has repeatedly argued that removing MTS-TM\u2019s right to sell handsets could not have deprived MTS-TM of a competitive advantage over Altyn Asyr because Altyn Asyr never exercised its right to sell handsets. However, the Claimant says, it is precisely because MTS-TM had begun selling handsets while Altyn Asyr had not that removing MTS-TM\u2019s right to do so deprived it of a competitive advantage.829\n\nCl. PHB, \u00b6 59.\n\n717.\n\nThe Claimant submits that the Respondent originally claimed that \"retail sales\" may have been omitted unintentionally by the Ministry of Economy from MTS-TM\u2019s 2015 charter, whilst it now claims that the Ministry of Economy parsed through the list and determined that handset sales were not relevant to MTS\u2019 activities.830 The Claimant asserts that this new explanation follows the inability of the Respondent\u2019s counsel to explain to the Tribunal why MTS\u2019 right to sell handsets was removed, and is disproved by the evidence which shows that no reason was identified (even internally) for the Ministry\u2019s decision.831 The Claimant asserts that the Ministry rejected the Claimant\u2019s appeal against its decision in January 2017 without providing any reasons whatsoever. This shows, in the Claimant\u2019s view, that this was not an administrative oversight, but rather a deliberate decision to restrict MTS-TM\u2019s activities.832\n\nCl. Sur-Reply PHB, p. 3.\n\nCl.

Reply PHB, \u00b6 29.\n\n718.\n\nInsofar as the Respondent argues that the Claimant did not pursue administrative remedies under Turkmen law when the new charter was issued in March 2015, the Claimant replies, in its Sur-Reply, that this is false and that the only remedy it had against the Ministry\u2019s decision to remove MTS-TM\u2019s right to sell handsets was to refile its application, which MTS-TM did in 2016.833\n\nCl. Sur-Reply PHB, p. 4.\n\n719.\n\nThe Claimant further contends that the Respondent\u2019s removal of MTS-TM\u2019s right to sell handsets also breached the NT standard, because the Respondent treated MTS-TM and Altyn Asyr differently without any reasonable justification. The Respondent\u2019s removal of MTS-TM\u2019s right to sell handsets also breached the \"all necessary approvals\" standard, because the ability to sell handsets is important to a telecoms operator. The Claimant also argues a breach of the FPS standard, because the Respondent (i) failed to protect MTS-TM\u2019s legal right to compete with Altyn Asyr on a level playing field, and (ii) failed to protect MTS-TM\u2019s legal right to sell handsets by arbitrarily depriving it of the authorisation to do so.834\n\nCl. PHB, \u00b6 59.\n\n***b. The Respondent\u2019s Position***\n----------------------------------\n\n720.\n\nThe Respondent asserts that the Ministry of Economy did not unilaterally intervene and remove permission for \"handset sales\" from MTS-TM\u2019s charter in 2015 and that MTS-TM\u2019s original charter of 2008 contained no reference to \"handset sales\".835 As to the background of this claim, the Respondent submits that the 2008 charter contained a list of [REDACTED] which included a non-specific reference to \"retail sales in non-specialized shops\" and \"retail sale in specialized shops\". In the beginning of 2015, MTS-TM applied to re-register its charter to introduce changes to its shareholders, capitalization, shareholders\u2019 rights and powers of board of directors.

It ultimately issued the new charter in March 2015 with a list [REDACTED] that were clearly and specifically related to MTS\u2019 activities, such as [REDACTED].838 The Respondent states that there is no evidence that MTS provided any explanations [REDACTED], or that it considered the \"retail sale\" items any more important or relevant than [REDACTED]839\n\nResp. PHB, \u00b6 104; Resp. Reply PHB, \u00b6 43.\n\nResp. Reply PHB, \u00b6 43.\n\n722.\n\nAs regards the Claimant\u2019s complaints that it was no longer able to sell handsets after the re-registration in March 2015, the Respondent argues that there is no evidence in the record suggesting that the Ministry of Economy even realized that MTS had been selling handsets, or that it omitted the \"retail sales\" item intentionally and with the purpose of precluding handset sales, or that MTS ever explained why it included that item in the list [REDACTED] There is no evidence of wrongful conduct or malicious intent, or disregard for the law. The Ministry of Economy made a comparative analysis of additional requested types of activities and of the activities carried out in Turkmenistan, noting that the types of activities are sufficient for the activities carried out by MTS.840 In its Sur-Reply PHB, the Respondent asserts that the Claimant now admits that it did not appeal the revised March 2015 charter, contrary to its prior allegations, and that the Claimant does not deny that there are no letters of complaint where it brought this issue to the attention of Turkmentelecom, the Ministry of Communications, or any other Turkmen entity. The Respondent contends that the Claimant\u2019s reference to a new application for a revised charter at the end of 2016 does nothing to explain its inactivity, failure to complain, and failure to avail itself of any remedies for nearly two years.841\n\nResp. PHB, \u00b6 105.\n\nResp. Sur-Reply PHB, \u00b6 18.\n\n723.\n\nThe Respondent submits that MTS did not complain or pursue any administrative means of challenging the registration, or even to inquire as to whether a mistake had been made in the list. Thus, MTS did not pursue its administrative remedies under Turkmen law when the new charter was issued in March 2015. There is no evidence that it even notified Turkmentelecom or the Ministry of Communications about the new charter in 2015 or that it voiced any complaints about it. The Respondent further asserts that the only document in the record referring to the Claimant\u2019s inability to sell handsets is nearly a year later, in MTS\u2019 May 2016 letter to Turkmentelecom explaining various reasons that profit payments had decreased, in which it refers to \"discontinued trading operations involving sale of handsets\". The Respondent states that MTS did not even complain about the omission of its right to sell handsets from its charter in this letter.842\n\nResp. PHB, \u00b6 105; Resp. Reply PHB, \u00b6 44.\n\n724.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the Claimant in its post-hearing brief refers to a purported \"appeal\" concerning the charter in 2017, but it appears that MTS-TM actually filed an \"application to amend its corporate charter\" for a second time in late 2016. The Respondent asserts that MTS never referred to this application as an \"appeal\" before its post-hearing brief. Moreover, MTS has failed to provide the application that it supposedly filed in 2016, including any list of activities it may have submitted in connection with the requested amendment. Thus, there is no basis to understand or assess the document referred to in the Claimant\u2019s PHB, which states that \"the types of activities of Economy Society [MTS] are sufficient for the activities carried out by it\". In any event, contrary to MTS\u2019 allegation that \"no reason was identified\" for the decision, the document contains a rational observation as to the sufficiency of the activities in MTS\u2019 charter. The Respondent again asserts there is no documentary evidence of any kind showing that MTS ever attempted to explain why \"retail sales\" or \"handset sales\" were necessary for its operations or should be included in its charter, either in 2015 or 2017.843\n\nResp. Reply PHB, \u00b6 45.\n\n725.\n\nAs regards the Claimant\u2019s argument that it suffered discrimination because Altyn Asyr continued at all times to be authorized to sell handsets, the Respondent asserts that the Claimant omits the critical facts that (i) Altyn Asyr never sold handsets; and (ii) Altyn Asyr did not request re-registration of its charter as MTS did in 2015.

Reply PHB, \u00b6 46.\n\n726.\n\nThe Respondent argues that none of Ms. Hardin\u2019s models quantifies the individual impact of the alleged inability to sell handsets after 2015 and that Mr. Thomas also fails to prove any reasonable analysis of his allocator\u2019s quantification of this claim, and his indicative weights in the allocator are clearly unreliable. There is no evidence of damage to MTS from this alleged measure.845\n\nResp. PHB, \u00b6 106.\n\n***c. The Tribunal\u2019s Analysis***\n--------------------------------\n\n727.\n\nThe Claimant argues that the Respondent deprived the Claimant of the right to sell handsets in 2015, which was unfair and discriminatory and breached the Claimant\u2019s right to all necessary approvals for the realisation of its investment.\n\n728.\n\nThe Claimant\u2019s Sale of Handsets Claim is denied.\n\n729.\n\nIt is undisputed that in the beginning of 2015, MTS-TM applied to re-register its charter in order to introduce changes regarding its shareholders, capitalization, shareholders\u2019 rights and the powers of board of directors. The application included a list [REDACTED] of activities, including \"retail sale\".846 MTS-TM\u2019s old charter from 2008 included a list [REDACTED], amongst them also \"retail sale\".847 The Ministry of Economy granted the application but reduced the long list [REDACTED]848 because many of the activities which appeared on the Claimant\u2019s application were unrelated to the provision of telecommunication services. In the list of [REDACTED] \"retail sale\" was not included. Thus, the final list established by the Ministry849 (Exhibit C-0544) does not include the retail sale activities which were included in the Claimant\u2019s application.\n\nCharter of MTS-TM as submitted for re-registration in 2015, Article 3.2.4, No. 59 and 61, Exhibit C-0543.\n\nCharter of MTS-TM in 2008, Article 3.2.4., No. 13 and 14, Exhibit C-0542.\n\nCharter of MTS-TM in 2015 as registered, 25 March 2015, Article 3.2.4, Exhibit C-0544.\n\nCharter of MTS-TM in 2015 as registered, 25 March 2015, Exhibit C-0544.\n\n730.\n\nThe Claimant did not take issue with this removal with the Ministry. Hence there is no evidence that the Claimant ever complained (or even only made an informal inquiry) about the decision by the Ministry of Economy and Development. There is also no hint in the record that the Ministry was (made) aware of MTS\u2019 handset sales or that the Ministry acted with the intent to preclude handset sales. Neither the Ministry of Communications nor Turkmentelecom was informed about this issue at the time. The only written communication in the record that mentions handsets is a letter to Turkmentelecom from May 2016, i.e., a year later, in which MTS explains why its profit share payments have declined.850\n\nLetter No. 04.2/1394 from MTS-TM to Turkmentelecom, 16 May 2016, Exhibit C-0223.\n\n731.\n\nAs regards Altyn Asyr, it appears uncontradicted that Altyn Asyr\u2019s permitted activities included the possibility to sell handsets. However, it is equally uncontradicted that Altyn Asyr never engaged in selling handsets between 2012 and 2017; hence the loss of the right to sell handsets did not have any actual impact on MTS\u2019 competitive position vis-\u00e0-vis Altyn Asyr.851 Furthermore, MTS-TM\u2019s subscribers had access to handsets through independent handset retailers.\n\nSee also Second Dippon Report, \u00b6\u00b6 ES9, 161.\n\n732.\n\nMoreover, the Tribunal finds no evidence of any impact of the inability to sell handsets on MTS-TM\u2019s operations in Turkmenistan.852\n\n*See* Second Dippon Report, \u00b6\u00b6 ES9, 162.\n\n733.\n\nThe Claimant\u2019s expert, Ms. Hardin, does not quantify the individual impact of the Handset Claim (any more than any other of the individual claims).\n\n734.\n\nThe Claimant\u2019s other expert, Mr. Thomas, states in his presentation to the Tribunal of May 2022 (\"Thomas Presentation\") \"[t]o be conservative, I do not assume any increased revenue directly from the sale of handsets\".853 Furthermore, the Tribunal is not convinced that Mr. Thomas\u2019 indicative weights contained in his allocator tool can be regarded as fully reliable. Mr. Thomas himself stated at the Hearing that his methodology of was not prepared \"with the degree of precision that you would like in these circumstances\" and that his goal was \"to provide the Tribunal with something that allows them to do anything other than a binary decision [...]\".854\n\nThomas Presentation, p. 36.\n\nHearing Transcript, Day 9, 83:25-84:11.\n\n735.\n\nIn sum, the Tribunal finds that this is a de minimis claim for which there is insufficient evidence. As a consequence, the claim is denied.\n\n**(8) Interconnection Claim**\n-----------------------------\n\n736.\n\nUnder this claim, the Claimant argues that the Respondent (through Altyn Asyr) did not provide sufficient interconnections between MTS-TM\u2019s and Altyn Asyr\u2019s networks. More particularly, the Claimant argues that it did not have sufficient voice interconnections with Altyn Asyr\u2019s network, which had a large impact on MTS-TM\u2019s subscribers.\n\n***a. The Claimant\u2019s Position***\n--------------------------------\n\n737.\n\nThe Claimant alleges that the Respondent\u2019s unjustified refusal to provide sufficient interconnections between MTS-TM and Altyn Asyr\u2019s networks constituted a breach of (i) the FET standard (Article 4(1) BIT), (ii) the \"all necessary approvals\" standard (Article 3(2) BIT), and (iii) the FPS standard (Article 3(3) BIT).855\n\nCl. PHB, \u00b6 62.\n\n738.\n\nThe Claimant argues that the Respondent\u2019s unjustified refusal to provide sufficient interconnections between MTS-TM\u2019s and Altyn Asyr\u2019s networks breached the FET standard because it was unfair and arbitrary. The Claimant states that Altyn Asyr could have provided more interconnection channels had it wished to, but instead chose to ignore MTS-TM\u2019s many letters pleading for Altyn Asyr\u2019s cooperation in establishing additional channels. [REDACTED] Given that there was no commercial reason for Altyn Asyr\u2019s refusal to provide additional channels, it is clear to the Claimant that this conduct formed part of the broader State-orchestrated campaign against MTS.856\n\nCl. PHB, \u00b6 62.\n\n739.\n\nThe Claimant takes the view that the Respondent\u2019s refusal to provide sufficient interconnections between MTS-TM and Altyn Asyr\u2019s networks breached the \"all necessary approvals\" standard because MTS required these interconnections for the realisation of its investment. Altyn Asyr\u2019s failure to provide adequate interconnection channels had a serious impact on the quality of services that MTS-TM was able to provide to its subscribers, and resulted in loss of revenue and a higher rate of churn of subscribers away from the MTS-TM network.857\n\nCl. PHB, \u00b6 62.\n\n740.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, the Respondent\u2019s refusal to provide sufficient interconnections between MTS-TM and Altyn Asyr\u2019s networks breached the FPS standard because the Respondent failed to protect MTS-TM\u2019s legal right to compete with Altyn Asyr on a level playing field.858\n\nCl. PHB, \u00b6 62.\n\n***b. The Respondent\u2019s Position***\n----------------------------------\n\n741.\n\nThe Respondent denies that insufficient voice interconnections between MTS and Altyn Asyr\u2019s networks had an \"outsized impact on MTS\u2019 subscribers\". The Respondent submits that the evidence shows that any interconnection problems had a greater effect on Altyn Asyr, and that the \"certificates of reconciliation\" between calls of each operator\u2019s subscribers show that more Altyn Asyr subscribers called MTS subscribers than vice versa. In other words, it is more likely that calls from Altyn Asyr subscribers were dropped. The Respondent submits that there is simply no evidence in the record that supports this claim. The Claimant\u2019s expert, Mr. Thomas, testified that MTS provided him with all of the evidence of the case before he decided which claims to include in his expert report; the Respondent submits that he did not include the interconnection claim in his report because it did not have any impact on MTS-TM\u2019s operations.859\n\nResp. PHB, \u00b6 123.\n\n742.\n\nThe Respondent argues that the interconnection channels were provided pursuant to a commercial contract (with its own dispute resolution clause) directly between MTS-TM and Altyn Asyr, so that this claim is an attempt to elevate a routine contract claim into a BIT claim.860\n\nResp. Reply PHB, \u00b6 60.\n\n743.\n\nWith regard to the Claimant's allegation [REDACTED] The Respondent asserts that Altyn Asyr had no interest or benefit in denying MTS-TM interconnection channels.861\n\nResp. Reply PHB, \u00b6 60.\n\n744.\n\nThe Respondent points out that none of Ms. Hardin\u2019s models quantifies the individual impact of the alleged interconnection issues and that Mr. Thomas also fails to prove any reasonable analysis of his allocator\u2019s quantification of this claim, and his indicative weights in the allocator are unreliable. Moreover, there is no evidence that MTS suffered any harm. As noted, Mr. Thomas did not even deem this claim worthy of discussion in his Report. For his allocator, Mr. Thomas assumed without evidence that 10 percent of these customers would choose to leave the network impacting MTS\u2019 subscriber base. But there is no evidence that interconnection problems caused subscriber loss to MTS. Indeed, Mr. Thomas recognized that subscribers did not have a great deal of other opportunities to go to.862 Mr. Thomas confirmed that he was not provided with any new evidence between his July 2020 report (where did not address the interconnection claim) and his latest January 2022 Supplemental Report. The Respondent concludes that the Claimant failed to meet its burden of proof.863\n\nResp. PHB, \u00b6 124.\n\nResp. Reply PHB, \u00b6 61.\n\n***c. The Tribunal\u2019s Analysis***\n--------------------------------\n\n745.\n\nThe Claimant\u2019s Interconnection Claim argues that the Respondent did not provide sufficient interconnections between MTS-TM\u2019s and Altyn Asyr\u2019s networks. More particularly, the Claimant argues that it did not have sufficient voice interconnections with Altyn Asyr\u2019s network, which had a large impact on its subscribers.\n\n746.\n\nThe Claimant\u2019s Interconnection Claim is denied.\n\n747.\n\nAs an initial point, because the only acts alleged in connection with this claim are acts of Altyn Asyr, the Tribunal returns to the question whether Altyn Asyr\u2019s acts can be attributed to the Respondent.864\n\n*See* Section VI. B. (2) and (3) above.\n\n748.\n\nThe Tribunal finds that the interconnection claim must be denied for lack of attribution.\n\n749.\n\nAfter the Tribunal\u2019s rejection of attribution as to Altyn Asyr under Articles 4 and 5 ILC Articles,865 what remains to be examined is whether Altyn Asyr acted on the instructions of, or under the direction or control of, Turkmenistan under Article 8 ILC Articles. The Tribunal finds that the acts or omissions of Altyn Asyr complained of (refusal or failure to provide sufficient interconnection channels) cannot be attributed to the Respondent according to Article 8 ILC Articles.\n\n*See* Section VI. B. (2) above.\n\n750.\n\nThe Tribunal observes that State ownership of an enterprise, such as the indirect State ownership of Altyn Asyr, may be evidence of general control over an enterprise, particularly if the State is the sole or a majority shareholder. On the other hand, the existence of a separate corporate entity, such as Altyn Asyr, may create a presumption to the contrary that activities of such a separate corporate entity is not attributable to the State. The Tribunal observes that a State may own a company but may still allow it to act independently in the pursuit of its business. Thus, establishing general control as a sole or majority shareholder is only a first step in establishing attribution. For the company\u2019s conduct to be attributable under Article 8 ILC Articles, the Claimant must also establish \"specific control\", namely that the specific alleged acts (and not just the general operation of the company) were effectively performed as a result of the State\u2019s instructions, direction or control.\n\n751.\n\nThe Tribunal cannot exclude that Altyn Asyr, as a State-owned company, was acting under the general control of the Ministry of Communications (and to a lesser degree also of Turkmentelecom). However, in order to establish attribution under Article 8 ILC Articles, the Claimant would need to demonstrate, as required by Article 8, that Altyn Asyr was \"in fact acting on the instructions of, or under the direction or control of, that State in carrying out the conduct\" the Claimant complains of in this case. It is the Claimant\u2019s argument that the Respondent has breached the BIT because Altyn Asyr refused to provide sufficient interconnection channels between MTS and Altyn Asyr\u2019s networks. The Tribunal, however, has seen no evidence that Altyn Asyr, when providing (allegedly insufficient) interconnection channels to MTS under the Interconnection Agreement between MTS and Altyn Asyr acted on the instructions of, or under the direction or control of the Respondent, particularly of the Ministry of Communications and/or Turkmentelecom.\n\n752.\n\nThus, even though Altyn Asyr, as a State-owned entity, may have been legally under the general control of its owner, this is, in the Tribunal\u2019s view, insufficient to prove that Altyn Asyr, when distributing (allegedly insufficient) interconnection channels between MTS and Altyn Asyr, acted on the instructions or under the direction or control of the Ministry of Communication or Turkmentelecom. As a consequence, the acts or omissions complained of with regard to Altyn Asyr (refusal to provide sufficient interconnection channels) cannot be attributed to the Respondent according to Article 8 ILC Articles, and this claim must be dismissed.\n\n**(9) Tariff-Setting Claim**\n----------------------------\n\n753.\n\nUnder this claim, the Claimant argues that the Respondent restricted the Claimant\u2019s ability to set tariffs by preventing it from increasing or reducing tariffs to respond to the market.\n\n***a. The Claimant\u2019s Position***\n--------------------------------\n\n754.\n\nThe Claimant takes the view that the Respondent\u2019s restrictions on MTS-TM\u2019s ability to set its own tariffs constituted a breach of (i) the FET standard (Article 4(1) BIT), (ii) the NT standard (Article 4(2) BIT), and (iii) the FPS standard (Article 3(3) BIT).866\n\nCl. PHB, \u00b6 65.\n\n755.\n\nThe Claimant submits that the Respondent\u2019s restrictions on MTS-TM\u2019s ability to set its own tariffs breached the FET standard because they were unfair, arbitrary, non-transparent and discriminatory. According to the Claimant, shortly after the restart of operations in 2012, the Minister of Communications informed MTS that it was not allowed to set low tariffs, because that would affect Altyn Asyr\u2019s customer base. The Claimant also alleges that, in 2015, the Respondent prevented MTS-TM from raising its tariffs to compensate for the change that year in Turkmenistan\u2019s official fixed exchange rate. The Claimant contends that the Respondent has never expressly denied that it limited MTS-TM\u2019s ability to set its own tariffs and that these restrictions on MTS-TM\u2019s ability to set its own prices constituted an unfair and arbitrary restriction on MTS-TM\u2019s commercial freedom. The restrictions were also discriminatory, according to the Claimant, because the Respondent has never suggested that Altyn Asyr was subject to any such restrictions.867\n\nCl. PHB, \u00b6 65.\n\n756.\n\nThe Claimant further asserts that the Respondent\u2019s restrictions on MTS-TM\u2019s ability to set its own tariffs breached the NT standard because they treated MTS-TM and Altyn Asyr differently without any reasonable justification. According to the Claimant the said restrictions also breached the FPS standard because Respondent (i) failed to protect MTS-TM\u2019s legal right to compete with Altyn Asyr on a level playing field, and (ii) failed to protect MTS-TM\u2019s legal right to set its own tariffs.868\n\nCl.

Reply PHB, \u00b6 54.\n\n758.\n\nThe Respondent submits that there is no evidence on the record supporting the claim that MTS-TM was prevented from increasing or reducing its tariffs to respond to the market, and in particular, that MTS-TM was not allowed to increase its tariffs in 2015, after Turkmenistan\u2019s devaluation of the manat.870 The Respondent submits that Mr. Thomas acknowledges that he did not know how much of a constraint there was in the actual world.871 [REDACTED]872\n\nResp.

Mr. Thomas did not discuss this measure in his expert report and for his allocator, he recognized that he did not have the information to be able to do a deep-dive forensically on what the impact was. He further noted that he saw no specific evidence that he could point to.

Regarding this claim he submitted at the Hearing in his presentation that he \"assumes[s] a [REDACTED] without these restrictions\".876 However, he also testified at the Hearing that he did not have enough information to make a deeper forensic analysis of what the impact of the measure was. He also could not point to any specific evidence:\n\n(Slide 36) The last few measures I\u2019ll deal with here. I\u2019m not going to spend a great deal of time on them, but they all ran through the model as describes here.

PHB, \u00b6 68.\n\n768.\n\nThe Claimant states that the Respondent\u2019s restrictions on MTS-TM\u2019s ability to advertise breached the FET standard because they were unfair, arbitrary, non-transparent and discriminatory. The Claimant submits that MTS-TM was unable to place its advertising in premium locations occupied by Altyn Asyr, and that MTS-TM was not able to advertise on television, whilst Altyn Asyr had no difficulties in this regard. The Claimant alleges that the Respondent has never denied the existence of these informal restrictions on MTS-TM\u2019s ability to advertise and that the Respondent also sought to deter corporate clients (in particular, State-owned corporate clients) from joining MTS-TM\u2019s network, which too constituted an unfair, arbitrary and non-transparent restriction on MTS-TM ability to compete freely with Altyn Asyr.879\n\nCl. PHB, \u00b6 68.\n\n769.\n\nThe Claimant argues that the Respondent\u2019s restrictions on MTS-TM\u2019s ability to advertise and market its services breached the NT standard because MTS-TM and Altyn Asyr were treated differently without any reasonable justification. The Respondent\u2019s restrictions also breached the \"all necessary approvals\" standard because MTS required the ability to advertise for the realisation of its permitted investment. The restrictions also constituted a breach of the FPS standard because the Respondent (i) failed to protect MTS-TM\u2019s legal right to compete with Altyn Asyr on a level playing field, and (ii) failed to protect MTS-TM\u2019s legal right to advertise in Turkmenistan.880\n\nCl. PHB, \u00b6 68.\n\n770.\n\nThe Claimant maintains that MTS-TM was harmed by the Respondent\u2019s restrictions on MTS-TM\u2019s ability to advertise and market its services. As early as November 2012, MTS-TM noted that Altyn Asyr was using \"administrative leverage\" to gain an unfair advantage over MTS-TM. MTS-TM repeatedly recorded in subsequent annual strategy presentations that it was subject to \"administrative restrictions on the placement of outdoor advertising\", while Altyn Asyr\u2019s advertising \"occup[ied] the most efficient places\".

The Respondent submits that [REDACTED] confirmed at the Hearing that there were no formal written bans and that MTS\u2019 complaint is that, while MTS-TM had outside commercial advertising, Altyn Asyr had more of it and that MTS-TM had problems in placing advertising.

PHB, \u00b6 71.\n\n787.\n\nThe Claimant alleges that the Respondent has also tried to suggest (inconsistently) that the Turkmen Government was not responsible for the restrictions in converting TMT into US$, blaming this instead on macroeconomic conditions or a shortage of US$ at local Turkmen banks.896\n\nCl. PHB, \u00b6 71.\n\n788.\n\nThe Claimant submits that it is a matter of public record, based on an order issued by the Central Bank of Turkmenistan in January 2016, that Turkmen banks have refused to sell U.S. dollars since then. The Claimant further argues that the Respondent\u2019s expert, Dr. Dippon, acknowledged in his first report that it is well documented within the economic literature that, if a country wants to maintain a fixed currency exchange rate, as in the case of Turkmenistan, then it must institute restrictions on foreign currency transfers, and that Dr. Dippon further referred to Turkmenistan\u2019s policy decisions of maintaining its fixed exchange rate and foreign currency transfer restrictions. Dr. Dippon\u2019s description of the currency exchange restrictions as being the result of \"Turkmenistan\u2019s policy decisions\" is also consistent with the views of foreign governments and independent observers, who have explained that the Turkmen Government strictly controls foreign exchange flows and the conversion to hard currency of the local currency, the manat (TMT) is increasingly difficult.897\n\nCl. PHB, \u00b6 71.\n\n789.\n\nThe Claimant states that the Respondent has also argued that it has not breached Article 7 because MTS\u2019 ability to repatriate its investment returns has only been delayed, rather than banned; the Claimant takes the view that the Respondent ignores the fact that Article 7 does not prohibit only undue or absolute restrictions on free transfer of proceeds, as some such BIT provisions do, but requires the Respondent to guarantee to MTS the \"unrestricted transfer abroad of funds related to [its] investment [...] without delay in any freely convertible currency\". In any event, to claim that MTS\u2019 repatriation of its investment proceeds has merely been \"delayed\" is to understate the scale of the issue. [REDACTED]898\n\nCl. PHB, \u00b6 71.\n\n790.\n\nAs regards the Respondent\u2019s argument that the Claimant has never stated that it does not still have access to its funds in Turkmenistan, the Claimant replies that this is true, but irrelevant. What is relevant is the Respondent\u2019s failure to uphold MTS\u2019 right under the BIT to the \"unrestricted transfer abroad of funds related to its investment\". In order to guard against any risk of double-counting (even though Turkmenistan has presented no evidence that the Claimant will ever be able to repatriate its trapped funds), the Claimant offered to assign its rights to the trapped funds to the Respondent upon receipt of the compensation granted by the Tribunal.899\n\nCl. Reply PHB, \u00b6 36.\n\n791.\n\nAs regards the Respondent\u2019s assertion that there is no documentary evidence in the record showing how much of MTS\u2019 funds remain trapped in Turkmenistan, the Claimant argues that Exhibit C-0533, [REDACTED]900\n\nCl. Reply PHB, \u00b6 37.\n\n792.\n\nThe Claimant further argues that the Respondent\u2019s failure to allow MTS to repatriate its investment returns breached the FET standard because it was unfair and arbitrary. The Claimant alleges that the currency control restrictions imposed by Turkmenistan have prevented MTS from accessing its investment returns without any reasonable justification, which constitutes per se unfair and arbitrary treatment of MTS as a foreign investor.901\n\nCl. PHB, \u00b6 71.\n\n793.\n\nThe Claimant maintains that the Respondent\u2019s failure to allow MTS to repatriate its investment returns breached the \"all necessary approvals\" standard because MTS required this \"for the realisation of [its] permitted investmen[t]\", as MTS\u2019 inability to convert TMT into US$ has prevented it for a number of years now from accessing the full returns on its investment. The Claimant also argues that the Respondent\u2019s failure to allow MTS to repatriate its investment returns breached the FPS standard because the Respondent failed to protect MTS\u2019 legal right to convert and repatriate dividends, and thereby failed to guarantee the protection of MTS\u2019 investment returns.902\n\nCl. PHB, \u00b6 71.\n\n794.\n\nThe Claimant argues, [REDACTED]903\n\nCl. PHB, \u00b6 72.\n\n795.\n\nThe Claimant refers to [REDACTED]\n\n***b. The Respondent\u2019s Position***\n----------------------------------\n\n796.\n\nThe Respondent observes that MTS does not claim that it does not have access to its funds in Turkmenistan. By reference to the testimony of [REDACTED], the Respondent explains that MTs has [REDACTED] According to the Respondent, MTS complains about a delay in the conversion of manats into U.S. dollars, but that all companies in Turkmenistan who work with foreign markets face those challenges.905\n\nResp. PHB, \u00b6 119.\n\n797.\n\nThe Respondent submits that there is, in any event, no documentary evidence in the record to support the Claimant\u2019s claim and that the Claimant has never submitted any bank account statements in order to prove which if any, funds were \"trapped\" in Turkmenistan.906 Not even the Respondent\u2019s experts, Ms. Hardin and Mr; Thomas, claim to have seen any financial documents supporting the Claimant\u2019s claim;907 they testified they were not provided with any documents supporting this claim.908 The Respondent notes that in its PHB, the Claimant confirms that there is no documentary support for this claim, which rests entirely [REDACTED] with Ms. Hardin and his testimony at the Hearing.909\n\nResp.

Reply PHB, \u00b6 58.\n\n798.\n\nThus, the Respondent argues that the Claimant has failed to prove its currency conversion claims under Articles 3, 4, & 7 of the BIT. The Respondent submits that the factual predicate of this claim requires establishing the existence of \"stranded cash\" held in Turkmen manats in Turkmenistan banks. The Respondent asserts that it should not be difficult for MTS to establish this basic factual predicate, which should be easily demonstrated simply by providing bank account records, but the Claimant has never provided a single bank account record establishing the existence of a single manat stranded in Turkmenistan.910 The Respondent contends that the quantum the Claimant seeks in its claim is an accounting fiction which does not represent actual currency that is \"stranded\" or \"trapped\" in Turkmenistan.911\n\nResp.

The Tribunal\u2019s Analysis***\n--------------------------------\n\n803.\n\nThe Claimant\u2019s Currency Conversion Claim alleges that the Respondent imposed unfair limits on the Claimant\u2019s export of profits from Turkmenistan. The Claimant argues that the Respondent failed to permit the Claimant to freely convert TMT into US$ in order to repatriate its investment returns. The Claimant maintains that it has been unable to transfer any funds out of Turkmenistan since 2019.\n\n804.\n\nThe Claimant\u2019s Currency Conversion Claim is denied.\n\n805.\n\nInsofar as the Claimant complains of restrictions in converting TMT into US$, the Tribunal has already stated that Article 7 of the BIT on the \"transfer of funds\" does not grant the right to exchange manats into any specific currency, but is rather concerned with the process of transferring funds out of the host State.921\n\n*See* Section VII.A.(5) c above.\n\n806.\n\nThe Tribunal also finds that there is insufficient evidence that the Claimant actually has \"stranded cash\" in Turkmenistan\u2019s banks. The Claimant\u2019s claim therefore fails for lack of proof. More particularly, the Tribunal finds no documentary evidence - no bank account statements in particular - which would show and provide proof of the amount of money that is (allegedly) currently held in bank account(s) in Turkmenistan.\n\n807.\n\nThe Tribunal finds no documentary evidence in the record to support the Claimant\u2019s Currency Conversion claim. MTS has never produced bank account statements to prove what, if any, funds were \"trapped\" in Turkmenistan. Hence, the most basic evidence to prove the existence of cash in Turkmen bank accounts is absent. The Claimant\u2019s expert, Ms. Hardin, testified that she does not recall seeing any financial documents supporting the Claimant\u2019s claim:\n\nQ: But where does the information in table come from?\n\nA: Well, it was supported by discussions with [REDACTED]\n\nQ: Okay. And again I\u2019m going to ask you the same question: did you put your eyes on the financial documents?\n\nA: I don\u2019t recall. There were documents that I saw, but I don\u2019t recall that.\n\nQ: And to the best of your knowledge, there are no financial documents in the record, whether or not you have seen them?\n\nA: Not that I know of.922\n\nHearing Transcript, Day 5, 155:3-15.\n\n808.\n\nThe Claimant\u2019s other expert, Mr. Thomas, also testified that he has not seen any underlying documents supporting this claim:\n\nQ. Okay. And [Ms. Hardin] also testified that she actually had not seen any of the underlying documents to support any of the existence of stranded cash; do you recall that testimony?\n\nA. Again, not the detail of it. But I know it was covered.\n\nQ. And that\u2019s fine. Have you seen any underlying documents?\n\nA. No, I wasn\u2019t asked to. I have taken simply the output of Ms Hardin\u2019s model and put it into the allocation tool.923\n\nHearing Transcript, Day 9, 97:25-98:9.\n\n809.\n\nThus, this claim rests on [REDACTED] with Ms. Hardin and his testimony at the Hearing. In the Tribunal\u2019s view, this evidence is insufficient [REDACTED]\n\n810.\n\nInsofar as the Claimant refers to its own financial statements in Exhibit C-0533, [REDACTED] the Tribunal finds that this is not a primary source and, in the Tribunal\u2019s view, is neither sufficient nor current. Again, if there is any cash remaining in Turkmenistan, there should be direct evidence in the form of current bank account statements to show its existence and amount.\n\n811.\n\nAfter the Hearing, Ms. Hardin submitted Post-Hearing Corrections with an update on the currency conversion claim, which now allege - in case the Shutdown Claims are granted - [REDACTED]\n\n812.\n\nHowever, even on Ms. Hardin\u2019s own account, [REDACTED] es[REDACTED] Furthermore, the allegedly trapped dividends which MTS claims seem to be merely an accounting entry for which no support was presented.\n\n813.\n\nIn sum, the Claimant has failed to prove its currency conversion claims under Articles 3, 4 and 7 of the BIT. The factual predicate of the Claimant\u2019s currency conversion claim requires establishing the existence of \"stranded cash\" held in Turkmen manats in Turkmenistan\u2019s banks. This should be easily accomplished by providing bank account records. Yet the Claimant has never provided any bank account statement establishing the existence of any manats stranded in Turkmenistan. At the Hearing, both Ms. Hardin and Mr. Thomas confirmed that they had not been provided with any documents to support this claim.\n\n814.\n\nIn addition, the Tribunal notes t[REDACTED] es[REDACTED]\n\n815.\n\n[REDACTED] \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ this would not be equivalent to \"lost cash\" or \"lost profits\". Hence, a full award of the \"stranded cash\" as requested by the Claimant928 would lead to double compensation if the \"stranded\" amount is finally repatriated. Therefore, the Tribunal finds that Mr. Thomas is wrong when he states that \"[t]he impact of the currency conversion measure is the value of the cash that was stranded in Turkmenistan that MTS-TM could not repatriate\".929 The Tribunal rather agrees with the Respondent\u2019s expert, Dr. Dippon, who submits that the currency conversion claim has no impact on MTS\u2019 profits as it does not represent lost profits from hindered business operations.930 A restriction on transfer of funds constitutes a requirement that MTS\u2019 profits remain in Turkmenistan until a repatriation is possible. The Claimant has also not offered to surrender the \"stranded\" Turkmen manats in order to avoid double compensation if the alleged cash amount is finally transferred.\n\n*See* Hardin\u2019s Post-Hearing Corrections, \u00b6 13.\n\nThomas Presentation, p. 36.\n\nDippon Presentation, p. 41; Second Dippon Report, \u00b6 164.\n\n816.\n\nTherefore, Claimant has failed to prove its Currency Conversion Claim. The Tribunal finds that there is no reliable evidence to establish the existence of any stranded cash in Turkmenistan, and certainly not the amounts that the Claimant has asked for. This claim is accordingly dismissed.\n\n**D. THE TRIBUNAL\u2019S CONCLUSION ON LIABILITY**\n---------------------------------------------\n\n817.\n\nThe Claimant\u2019s 2017 Shutdown Claims and its Historical Breaches Claims are denied.\n\n818.\n\nThe Tribunal, having rejected all of the Claimant\u2019s claims, finds no merit in the aggregation of these claims. Hence, Claimant\u2019s 2017 Shutdown Claims and its Historical Breaches Claims as a whole are dismissed.\n\n819.\n\nThe Claimant\u2019s case on liability is rejected.\n\n**VIII. DAMAGES**\n-----------------\n\n820.\n\nGiven that the Tribunal has rejected the Claimant\u2019s case on liability, the Tribunal has no occasion to consider the Claimant\u2019s claims for damages.\n\n**IX. COSTS**\n-------------\n\n**A. THE CLAIMANT\u2019S COST SUBMISSION**\n-------------------------------------\n\n821.\n\nIn its Costs Submission, the Claimant argues that the Tribunal should order the Respondent to reimburse MTS for its legal, expert and other costs and to pay all of the fees and expenses of the members of the Tribunal, together with the expenses and charges of ICSID.931\n\nCl. Costs Submission, \u00b6 2.\n\n822.\n\nThe Claimant points out that Article 58(1) of the ICSID Additional Facility Rules932 does not provide any express guidance as to how the Tribunal should determine the allocation of costs between the Parties.933 Therefore, the Claimant takes the view that the Respondent should be ordered to bear the costs on the basis of the \"costs follow the event\" rale, as the prevailing approach to costs allocation under Swedish law and an increasingly common practice among modern investment treaty tribunals.934\n\nArticle 58(1) of the ICSID Additional Facility Rules provides that: \"Unless the parties otherwise agree, the Tribunal shall decide how and by whom the fees and expenses of the members of the Tribunal, the expenses and charges of the Secretariat and the expenses incurred by the parties in connection with the proceeding shall be borne\".\n\nCl. Costs Submission, \u00b6 2.\n\nCl. Costs Submission, \u00b6\u00b6 2, 3 et seq.\n\n823.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, the majority of modern investment treaty tribunals, including ICSID tribunals, are adopting some form of \"costs follow the event\" or \"loser pays\" approach. The Claimant further submits that adopting such an approach is particularly appropriate here, as the present case is an ICSID Additional Facility Rules proceeding. Accordingly, the applicable procedural law (the lex arbitri), including with respect to the allocation of costs, is not public international law but Swedish law. The Claimant further argues that Swedish procedural law applies a general rule that \"costs follow the event\", and Swedish legal scholars and commentators confirm that consistent with this general rule, the default approach in Swedish arbitral practice is that \"costs follow the event\".935\n\nCl. Costs Submission, \u00b6 3.\n\n824.\n\nThe Claimant argues that the Respondent\u2019s \"serious and repeated misconduct throughout this arbitration\" further supports the application of cost-shifting.936 Accordingly, even if MTS is not successful in all of its claims, the Claimant says that the Tribunal should nevertheless order the Respondent to pay a reasonable share of MTS\u2019 costs (and the majority of the arbitration costs) in order to recognise and sanction the Respondent\u2019s misconduct.937 Thus, the Claimant maintains that, regardless of the outcome of the case, the Tribunal should order the Respondent to pay a reasonable share of MTS\u2019 costs, as well as the majority of the arbitration costs.938\n\nCl.

The arbitrators\u2019 order may also include interest, if a party has so requested\".\n\nCl. Costs Submission, \u00b6 12.\n\n**B. THE RESPONDENT\u2019S COST SUBMISSION**\n---------------------------------------\n\n828.\n\nIn its submission on costs, the Respondent claims the reimbursement of costs and expenses of these proceedings, including the Respondent\u2019s legal fees and expenses totalling [REDACTED], broken down as follows:952\n\n[REDACTED]\n\nResp. Costs Submission, \u00b6 1.\n\n829.\n\nThe Respondent takes the view that an award on costs requiring the Claimant to compensate the Respondent for the full amount of its legal fees and expenses is warranted.953\n\nResp. Costs Submission, \u00b6 2.\n\n830.\n\nThe Respondent further argues that the Claimant\u2019s conduct in pursuing frivolous claims, and its history of aggressive, bad faith and obstructive tactics are all factors to be taken into account in the apportionment of costs.954 The Respondent alleges that these tactics caused enormous financial burden to Turkmenistan, with needless escalation of costs, for which MTS must be held accountable.955\n\nResp. Costs Submission, \u00b6 2.\n\nResp. Costs Submission, \u00b6\u00b6 2(i)-(viii), 3, Section II(A)-(F).\n\n831.\n\nAs regards the standards for awarding costs,956 the Respondent argues that under Article 58(1) of the ICSID Facility Arbitration Rules the Tribunal has the power to assess and apportion all or part of the fees and expenses incurred by the parties in connection with the proceeding, including legal fees, expert fees, ICSID costs, and other expenses.957\n\nResp. Costs Submission, \u00b6\u00b6 4, et seq.\n\nResp. Costs Submission, \u00b6 4.\n\n832.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the conduct of the parties is a factor that ICSID tribunals should consider in allocating costs as recognized in the recent 2022 amendments to the ICSID Arbitration Rules.958 The Respondent also refers to Rule 62(1)(b) of the 2022 ICSID Additional Facility Arbitration Rules959 as well as arbitral jurisprudence960 regarding the relevance of the conduct of the parties for the allocation of costs.\n\nResp. Costs Submission, \u00b6 5.\n\nRule 61(1) of the 2022 ICSID Additional Facility Arbitration Rules provides:  \n(1) In allocating the costs of the proceeding, the Tribunal shall consider all relevant circumstances, including:  \n(a) the outcome of the proceeding or any part of it;  \n(b) the conduct of the parties during the proceeding, including the extent to which they acted in an expeditious and cost-effective manner and complied with these Rules and the orders and decisions of the Tribunal;  \n(c) the complexity of the issues; and  \n(d) the reasonableness of the costs claimed.\n\nResp. Costs Submission, \u00b6\u00b6 6, et seq.\n\n833.\n\nThe Respondent argues that the circumstances of this case warrant an award of costs against the Claimant.961\n\nResp. Costs Submission, \u00b6 11.\n\n834.\n\nThe Respondent \"respectfully requests that the Tribunal award it the entirety of its legal fees, expert fees, and all other costs and expenses incurred in this arbitration, in the amount of [REDACTED], plus interest at a reasonable commercial rate accruing from the date of the award until the date of payment\".962\n\nResp.

THE TRIBUNAL\u2019S AND ICSID\u2019S FEES AND EXPENSES**\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n835.\n\nThe fees and expenses of the Tribunal, ICSID\u2019s administrative fees and expenses, amount to (in US$):\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n**D. THE TRIBUNAL\u2019S DECISION ON COSTS**\n---------------------------------------\n\n836.\n\nArticle 58 (1) of the ICSID Facility Arbitration Rules, to which both Parties refer, gives the Tribunal discretion to allocate all costs of the arbitration, including attorney\u2019s fees and other costs, between the Parties as it deems appropriate. Article 58 (1) provides:\n\nUnless the parties otherwise agree, the Tribunal shall decide how and by whom the fees and expenses of the members of the Tribunal, the expenses and charges of ICSID and the expenses incurred by the parties in connection with the proceeding shall be borne. The Tribunal may, to that end, call on the Secretariat and the parties to provide it with the information it needs in order to formulate the division of the cost of the proceeding between the parties.\n\n837.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees with the Claimant that costs are properly allocated on the basis of the \"costs follow the event\" rule.\n\n838.\n\nGiven that the Respondent has prevailed in this case, the costs have, in principle, to be borne by the Claimant.\n\n839.\n\nThe Tribunal finds, however, that some adjustment is appropriate to take account of the fact that the Claimant has prevailed on jurisdiction. The Claimant has also largely prevailed on attribution.\n\n840.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that each side argues that its costs were increased by the other side\u2019s conduct. After having reviewed the Parties\u2019 allegations, the Tribunal finds some basis for complaint by each Party, but insufficient reason to give this aspect any impact on the allocation of costs between the Parties.\n\n841.\n\nTaking the above into account, the Tribunal finds that the Claimant should bear the entire costs of the arbitration, including the Tribunal Members\u2019 fees and expenses, ICSID\u2019s administrative fees, and other direct expenses. These are itemized in paragraph 835, above, and total [REDACTED] The Claimant shall therefore reimburse the Respondent for its share of such fees and expenses in the amount of [REDACTED]\n\n842.\n\nThe Tribunal also finds that the Claimant should reimburse the Respondent for 80 percent of the Respondent\u2019s legal fees and expenses. The Respondent has calculated its total legal fees and expenses as [REDACTED], which includes [REDACTED] of arbitral costs. Thus, the total of Respondent\u2019s legal fees and expenses (not including arbitral costs) is [REDACTED]. Claimant is directed to pay the Respondent [REDACTED]\n\n843.\n\nAs regards interest, the Respondent requests interests on its costs at a \"reasonable commercial rate accruing from the date of the award until the date of payment\".963\n\nResp. Costs Submission, \u00b6 31.\n\n844.\n\nThe Tribunal finds it appropriate that no interest should be due on the amount payable to the Respondent if payment of the amounts ordered is made by the Claimant within 60 days from the date of this Award. If payment is not made by that date, the Claimant shall pay interest at the rate proposed by the Claimant itself in its prayer for relief, i.e., the U.S. 5-year median Treasury rate + 4%, compounded annually, on all of the amounts awarded from the date of the Award to the date the Award is paid in full.964\n\nCl.
