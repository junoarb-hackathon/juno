FACTUAL BACKGROUND**\n---------------------------\n\n**A. The background to the Chinchero International Airport**\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n80.\n\nThe Cuzco region is Peru's main touristic site and a critical component of Peru's touristic sector.3 However, the Cuzco region's existing airport, the Velasco Astete International Airport (the \"**Cuzco Airport**\"), built in 1963, has a series of geographical and capacity limitations.4 In 2017, Peru estimated that by 2020, the Cuzco Airport would be operating at three times the capacity for which it was designed.5\n\n**Exhibit C-98**, Chinchero International Airport \u2013 Cuzco (AICC), Presentation of PROINVERSI\u00d3N, February 2014; **Exhibit R-17**, *Oficio No. 050-2017-MINCETUR/DM-GA*, 13 July 2017, attaching *Informe No. 016-2017/MINCETUR/VMT/DGET/DIOT*, MINCETUR's Opinion Regarding Public Interest of Chinchero Airport, 12 July 2017, p. 7.\n\n**Exhibit C-98**, Chinchero International Airport \u2013 Cuzco (AICC), Presentation of PROINVERSI\u00d3N, February 2014; **Exhibit R-17**, *Oficio No. 050-2017-MINCETUR/DM-GA*, 13 July 2017, attaching *Informe No. 016-2017/MINCETUR/VMT/DGET/DIOT*, MINCETUR's Opinion Regarding Public Interest of Chinchero Airport, 12 July 2017, pp. 2, 4-6.\n\n**Exhibit R-17**, *Oficio No. 050-2017-MINCETUR/DM-GA*, 13 July 2017, attaching *Informe No. 016-2017/MINCETUR/VMT/DGET/DIOT*, MINCETUR's Opinion Regarding Public Interest of Chinchero Airport, 12 July 2017, p. 7.\n\n81.\n\nAccordingly, on 11 October 2001, Peru's Congress enacted Law No. 27528, which classified the Chinchero International Airport (the \"**Chinchero Airport**\" or the \"**New Airport**\")as a project of public interest and of the \"highest priority to the State\" (the \"**Project**\" or the \"**Chinchero Airport Project**).\"6 This law also authorized PROINVERSI\u00d3N,7 the State's private investment promotion agency, to promote a public tender process and grant the concession for the construction and operation of the Airport.8\n\n**Exhibit CL-93**, *Ley No. 27528, Ley que Dispone la Actualizaci\u00f3n de Estudios Definitivos y la Construcci\u00f3n del Aeropuerto de Chinchero, en el Departamento de Cusco*, 9 October 2001 (\"Law No. 27528\"), art. 2.\n\nAt that time called Agencia de Promoci\u00f3n de la Inversi\u00f3n Privada.\n\n**Exhibit CL-93**, Law No. 27528, art. 4.\n\n82.\n\nIn 2009, Peru's Congress reiterated the importance of the Chinchero Airport Project for the country's economic and social development through Law No. 27528, and on 2 February 2010, the Ministry of Transport and Communications (the \"**MTC**\")requested PROINVERSI\u00d3N to launch a public tender to award the concession for the construction and operation of the New Airport.9\n\n**Exhibit R-21**, *Oficio No. 125-2010-MTC/01* from MTC to Proinversi\u00f3n, 2 February 2010.\n\n83.\n\nA few months later, through Emergency Decree No. 039-2010, the President of Peru, President Alan Garc\u00eda P\u00e9rez, ordered PROINVERSI\u00d3N to prioritize the Chinchero Airport Project to overcome the operational, geographic and social limitations of the Cuzco Airport.10\n\n**Exhibit C-100**, *Decreto de Urgencia No. 039-2010*, 10 June 2010, \"Considerando.\"\n\n84.\n\nIn 2017, the MTC and the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Tourism (the \"**MINCETUR**\" for its acronym in Spanish)were asked again to confirm whether the construction of the Chinchero Airport was in the public interest and to assess the benefits of the Project to the Cuzco region.11 Both the MTC and MINCETUR concluded that the new Chinchero Airport would bring about significant benefits to the region, including approximately US$63 billion in benefits during the 40 years of the Concession and the creation of 2,500 jobs during its construction and operation.12 MINCETUR further concluded that the New  \nAirport was urgently needed to aid the economic and social development of Cuzco and Peru, and that building the New Airport was in the public interest.13\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, paras. 22, 23.\n\n**Exhibit R-18**, Memorandum No. 0524-2017-MTC-12.08, 13 July 2017, attaching *Informe No. 0347-2017-MTC/12.08*, MTC's Opinion Regarding Public Interest of Chinchero Airport, 13 July 2017, pp. 3, 5, 6.\n\n**Exhibit R-17**, *Oficio No. 050-2017-MINCETUR/DM-GA*, 13 July 2017, attaching *Informe No. 016-2017/MINCETUR/VMT/DGET/DIOT*, MINCETUR's Opinion Regarding Public Interest of Chinchero Airport, 12 July 2017, p. 9.\n\n**B. The tender process for the Chinchero Airport and the** ***Bases***\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**(1)Introduction**\n-------------------\n\n85.\n\nAs explained above, PROINVERSI\u00d3N had to develop a tender process to select a concessionaire for the design, construction and operation of the Chinchero Airport. According to the Respondent, the tender process was divided into two phases:14 first, PROINVERSI\u00d3N prepared the bidding terms (the \"***Bases***\"), which served as the terms of reference of the tender procedures and made drafts of the Concession Contract available to potential bidders. The potential bidders were then invited to make comments on the drafts. Taking the appropriate comments and answers into account, PROINVERSI\u00d3N published the final version of the *Bases* and the Concession Contract. In the second phase of the tender process, PROINVERSI\u00d3N collected proposals from the bidders and selected the winning bid among the qualified bidders.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, para. 29; **Exhibit RWS-2**, First Guti\u00e9rrez Damazo Statement, paras. 15, 16.\n\n86.\n\nThe first version of the *Bases* of the tender was published in August 2010.15 The *Bases* were modified on various occasions through *circulares*, issued in response to the bidders' comments and questions, with the final consolidated version published in 2014.16 According to the *Bases*, the tender process would be divided into three stages:17\n\n\u2022 Pre-qualification of bidders:18 During this first phase, bidders had to submit documentation evidencing that they met the minimum technical and financial requirements set out in the *Bases*. Among those requirements, bidders had to prove that they had the required competence and experience to build, manage and operate an international airport, a net worth of US$140 million and an annual turnover of at least US$48 million.\n\n\u2022 Evaluation of the bidders' technical proposals:19 The pre-qualified bidders had to submit their technical proposal and a signed copy of the Concession Contract. The technical proposal had to include a description of the Project and a business plan.\n\n\u2022 Evaluation of the bidders' economic proposals:20 At the same time, the pre-qualified bidders had to submit \u2013 in a separate envelope \u2013 their economic proposals. Despite receiving the technical and economic proposals at the same time, PROINVERSI\u00d3N had to first assess whether the proposals complied with the technical requirements, inform the pre-qualified bidders, and subsequently review and rank the economic proposals.21\n\n**Exhibit C-10**, *Bases - Concurso de Proyectos Integrales para la Entrega en Concesi\u00f3n al Sector Privado del Nuevo Aeropuerto Internacional de Chinchero Cusco*, August 2010 (\"First Bidding Terms\").\n\n**Exhibit C-18**, *Texto \u00danico Ordenado de las Bases -Concurso de Proyectos Integrales para la Entrega en Concesi\u00f3n al Sector Privado del Nuevo Aeropuerto Internacional de Chinchero Cusco, Circulares No. 1 a No. 64*, March 2014 (\"Final Bidding Terms\"); Respondent's Counter-Memorial, para. 29.\n\n**Exhibit C-18**, Final Bidding Terms, art. 5, art. 7.1, art. 7.2; Claimants' Memorial, paras. 45 *et seq*.; Respondent's Counter-Memorial, paras. 36 *et seq*.\n\n**Exhibit C-18**, Final Bidding Terms, art. 5.\n\n**Exhibit C-18**, Final Bidding Terms, art. 7.1.\n\n**Exhibit C-18**, Final Bidding Terms, art.7.2.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, para. 46.\n\n87.\n\nGiven that the Parties dispute the economic structure of the Project, the Tribunal will next turn to that topic.\n\n**(2)The financial structure of the Project as contemplated in the** ***Bases***\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n88.\n\nIn the first draft of the *Bases*, PROINVERSI\u00d3N classified the Concession as a \"self-sustaining PPP,\" which meant that the concessionaire would be responsible for bearing the full cost of construction and would recoup its up-front costs through the fees collected during the operation of the Concession.22\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, para. 34; **Exhibit RWS-2**, First Guti\u00e9rrez Damazo Statement, para. 13.\n\n89.\n\nHowever, according to the Respondent, after conducting a financial analysis, PROINVERSI\u00d3N concluded that the Project would not be viable under a self-sustaining structure and the airport fees required to finance the Project would have to be too high. Consequently, by October 2012, PROINVERSI\u00d3N changed the economic structure of the Project to a co-financed PPP.23 This meant that the State would bear part of the costs of the Project.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, para. 35; **Exhibit RWS-2**, First Guti\u00e9rrez Damazo Statement, paras. 13, 14.\n\n90.\n\nIn December 2012 (*i.e.*, before the final version of the *Bases* was approved), PROINVERSI\u00d3N hired the consulting firm Advanced Logistics Group (\"**ALG**\")to advise on how to structure the financial and economic model of the Concession.24 On 17 December 2013, ALG issued a report in which it recommended a financial structure for the Concession (\"**ALG's Financial Economic Model**\"), and setting out the maximum levels of co-financing that would be needed from the State. It also recommended the economic criteria to be used to select the concessionaire.25\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, para. 49; **Exhibit R-29**, Proinversi\u00f3n's Meeting Minute No. 497-4-2012-CPI regarding Chinchero's Tender Process, Session No. 497, 7 December 2012.\n\n**Exhibit R-32**, *Circular No. 55*, regarding Chinchero's Tender Process, 20 December 2013; **Exhibit R-33**, *Circular No. 57*, regarding Chinchero's Tender Process, 20 December 2013.\n\n91.\n\nALG's recommendation was to combine two co-financing mechanisms: Pay-As-You-Work (\"*Pago por Obras*\" or \"**PPO**\" for its acronym in Spanish)and Payment for the Advancement of Works (\"*Pago Annual por Obras*\" or \"**PAO**\" for its acronym in Spanish).26\n\n**Exhibit R-31**, ALG Report, Deliverable 4-B: Financial Economic Model, December 2013, p. 128.\n\n92.\n\nUnder ALG's Financial Model, the PPO mechanism meant that the State would pay the concessionaire periodically as the works covered by that mechanism were being executed, based on the progress of the work as certified by the *Organismo Supervisor de la Inversi\u00f3n en Infraestructura de Transporte de Uso P\u00fablico* (\"**OSITRAN**\"). Under the PAO mechanism, the State would pay back the concessionaire for the co-financed costs covered by that mechanism only after the Chinchero Airport had been built and begun operating. Payment would be made through quarterly payments over a period of 15 years. The quarterly payments would include a premium to compensate the concessionaire for financing the construction of the Airport. To calculate the premium, ALG assumed an average borrowing interest rate of 7.01% plus a 2.5% spread.27\n\n**Exhibit R-31**, ALG Report, Deliverable 4-B: Financial Economic Model, December 2013, pp. 128-130.\n\n93.\n\nSome of ALG's recommendations and parameters set out above were incorporated into the *Bases*.28 In particular, the *Bases* contemplated that the Project would be developed on a \"co-financing\" basis, and such term was defined as: \"the amount of money expressed in US dollars that the Concession Owner will pay to the Concessionaire through the mechanisms of Pay-As-You-Work (PPO)and Payment for the Advancement of Works (PAO).\"29 In light of this financial structure, Annex 7 of the *Bases* set out the two criteria that would be taken into account by the State to determine the best economic proposals:30\n\n\u2022 Criteria No. 1, Payment Fund of the PAO: Each bidder would set out the maximum amount the State would have to pay to co-finance the Project. This amount was referred to as the Payment Fund of the PAO (\"*Fondo de Pagos del PAO\"* or \"**FPAO**\" for its acronym in Spanish).31 Under the *Bases*, the bidders' proposals had to include an FPAO equal to or lower than the maximum amount of co-financing that Peru was willing to assume, and which was set at US$457.489.504. This amount corresponded to the estimated baseline scenario proposed by ALG in its Financial Economic Model.32\n\n\u2022 Criteria No. 2, Annual Refund Percentage (\"*Porcentaje de Reintegro del Cofinanciamiento\"*):33 The *Bases* established that the concessionaire would have to provide the State a percentage equal to or above 30% of all net income above US$35 million, obtained from the operational stage of the Chinchero Airport.\n\n**Exhibit R-32**, *Circular No. 55*, regarding Chinchero's Tender Process, 20 December 2013; **Exhibit R-33**, *Circular No. 57*, regarding Chinchero's Tender Process, 20 December 2013.\n\n**Exhibit C-18**, Final Bidding Terms, art. 1.2.13.

The premium was supposed to compensate Kuntur Wasi for financing the Project during this phase.80\n\n**Exhibit C-14**, Annex 16, Appendix 2, Cl. 2.4 (p. 316 of the PDF)..\n\n**Exhibit C-18**, Final Bidding Terms, Annex 1, Appendix 1, art.

As explained earlier, this amount, which represented the FPAO, \"Payment Fund\" or \"*Fondo de Pagos del Pago por Avance de Obra*\"83 was US$264,758,697.00 and corresponded to the amount that Kuntur Wasi presented in its economic proposal as the maximum amount that the State would be required to pay to build the Chinchero Airport.84 The formula set out in the Concession Contract was the following:85\n\n*i* \\* (1 + *i*)n\n\n*PAOtrimestral = FPAO \\* [---------------------------]*\n\n(1 + *i*)n -1\n\nDonde:\n\nPAO trimestral = Cuota trimestral del PAO.\n\nFPAO = Fondo de Pagos del PAO, definido en la Propuesta Econ\u00f3mica.\n\ni = Tasa de descuento trimestral para efectos del Fondo de Pagos del PAO, la misma que es equivalente a la tasa promedio ponderado anual del Cierre Financiero de la Etapa de Ejecuci\u00f3n de Pbras m\u00e1s un spread del 2.5%, convertida a su tasa equivalente trimestral\n\nn = 60, que es el n\u00famero de cuotas trimestrales en las que se pagar\u00e1 el PAO\n\nClaimants' Memorial, paras. 76, 77.\n\n**Exhibit C-4**, Concession Contract, Annex 23, Appendix 1, Cl. 1.2.\n\nClaimants' Memorial, para. 77.\n\n**Exhibit C-4**, Concession Contract, Annex 7, Appendix 1; Claimants' Memorial, para. 77; Respondent's Counter-Memorial, para. 63.\n\n**Exhibit C-4**, Concession Contract, Annex 23, Appendix 1.\n\n117.\n\nPursuant to this formula, the amount of the quarterly PAO would be based on two factors: the FPAO, which was fixed at US$264,758,697.00, and variable \"i.\" Under the Concession Contract, variable \"i\" was defined as follows:\n\n*i = Quarterly discount rate for the purposes of the PAO Payment Fund, which is equivalent to the annual weighted average rate of the Financial Clos[ure] for the Construction Stage plus a 2.5% spread, converted into its quarterly equivalent rate.*86\n\nThis is an English translation provided at para. 65 of the Respondent's Counter-Memorial.

The Claimants submit that the FPAO was intended to cover the construction costs of Sub-stage 2 only, with variable \"i\" covering the financing costs. The Respondent submits that the FPAO covered both, financing and construction costs, thereby subjecting both costs to the FPAO cap.89\n\nClaimants' Memorial, para. 79.\n\n**Exhibit RWS-2**, First Guti\u00e9rrez Damazo Statement, paras. 47, 48; Respondent's Counter-Memorial, para. 66.\n\nClaimants' Reply, paras. 455-488; Respondent's Rejoinder, paras. 42-61.\n\n**(iii)Sub-stage 3: non-financed construction works**\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n119.\n\nThis sub-stage covered construction works that would not be financed by the State.

Under the terms of the Contract, at least 30 days before the construction works could begin, Kuntur Wasi had an obligation to secure the Financial Closing (\"*Cierre Financiero\"*)of the Contract.91\n\n**Exhibit C-4**, Concession Contract, Cl. 1.23.\n\n121.\n\nTo obtain the Financial Closing, Kuntur Wasi had to file the relevant documents evidencing that it had the necessary financing to carry out the Project.92 Kuntur Wasi could prove this in two different ways: (i)by showing that it was obtaining the capital required to carry out the works from related companies; or (ii)by showing that it was borrowing the capital from Authorized Third-Party Lenders (\"*Acreedores Permitidos\"*).93\n\n**Exhibit C-4**, Concession Contract, Cl. 1.1, Cl. 1.23, Cl. 9.2.\n\n**Exhibit C-4**, Concession Contract, Cl. 1.1, Cl. 1.23, Cl. 9.2.\n\n122.\n\nKuntur Wasi's failure to certify that it met the requirements for the Financial Closing meant that the MTC could, subject to OSITRAN'S opinion, terminate the Contract for breach, in accordance with Clause 15.3 of the Concession Contract.94\n\n**Exhibit C-4**, Concession Contract, Cl. 9.2.1.\n\n**(v)Endeudamiento Garantizado Permitido or EGP**\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n123.\n\nAs explained above, under the Concession Contract, Kuntur Wasi could choose to finance the Project itself or to obtain funding from third parties. If Kuntur Wasi chose to borrow capital, the State would allow Kuntur Wasi to pledge the rights to the Concession; the net income obtained from the Concession, and Kuntur Wasi's shares, in favor of the Authorized Third-Party Lenders. This was the so-called *Endeudamiento Garantizado Permitido* (\"**Permitted Guaranteed Indebtedness**\" or \"**EGP**\" for its acronym in Spanish).95 The EGP was defined as follows:\n\n*[T]he indebtedness resulting from any financing or credit transactions entered into with and / or loans obtained from any of the \"Authorized Creditors\" in any form, and which will be used for the object of this Contract [\u2026] and is guaranteed pursuant to Clause 10.4.1.\".*96*[Tribunal's translation]*\n\n**Exhibit C-4**, Concession Contract, Cl. 10.4.\n\nThe original Spanish reads: \"*[E]l endeudamiento por concepto de operaciones de financiamiento o cr\u00e9dito, emisi\u00f3n de valores mobiliarios o instrumento de deuda y/o de dinero tomado en pr\u00e9stamo de cualquier(a)de los Acreedor(es)Permitido(s)bajo cualquier modalidad, cuyos fondos ser\u00e1n destinados al cumplimiento del objeto de este Contrato [\u2026], y se encuentra garantizado conforme lo dispuesto en el Numeral 10.4.1.*\" **Exhibit C-4**, Concession Contract, Cl. 1.44.\n\n124.\n\nKuntur Wasi would only be allowed to provide those guarantees, however, if its financing package received a favorable opinion by OSITRAN and the MTC's approval.

Notably, the *Contralor\u00eda* pointed out that it was necessary to determine whether the assumptions used by the consultants (*i.e.,* ALG)to calculate variable \"i\" had been shared with the bidders. If those documents were not part of the tender process, the *Contralor\u00eda* warned that it was possible that each bidder applied a different methodology and assumptions with regard to the calculation of that variable.137 The *Contralor\u00eda* further noted that the Concession Contract did not set out any limits to variable \"i\" and that the Contract itself did not allow to identify the assumptions to calculate the variable.138 Consequently, the *Contralor\u00eda* concluded that approving Kuntur Wasi's proposed \"i\" could affect the economic equilibrium of the Concession Contract, and recommended that the MTC renegotiate the amount of the PAO payments with Kuntur Wasi.139\n\n**Exhibit C-22**, *Oficio No. 4268-2016 MTC/25*, 27 October 2016, attaching *Oficio No. 01882-2016-CG/DC,* 12 October 2016, p. 1.\n\n**Exhibit C-22**, *Oficio No. 4268-2016 MTC/25*, 27 October 2016, attaching *Oficio No. 01882-2016-CG/DC,* 12 October 2016, p. 2.\n\n**Exhibit C-22**, *Oficio No. 4268-2016 MTC/25*, 27 October 2016, attaching *Oficio No. 01882-2016-CG/DC,* 12 October 2016, p. 2.

The MEF's view was that Addendum No. 1 would save the State between US$245 and US$340 million, and that although it changed the original payment schedule, Addendum No. 1 would mean keeping the \"distribution of risks\" and the \"economic equilibrium\" of the Contract:187\n\n*1. The Contralor\u00eda claims that Addendum No. 1 causes a financial loss of USD 40 million to the State. However, on the contrary, Addendum No. 1 does not cause a financial loss but rather it allows for costs savings for the State for the following reasons: [\u2026]*\n\n*b. The Audit Report reveals that the calculation of the financial loss by the Contralor\u00eda resulted from a comparison of Addendum No. 1 and an internal document of ProInversi\u00f3n (Financial Model), which was not included in the Concession Contract and was not known to the bidders. [\u2026]*\n\n*e. Upon appropriate comparison, Addendum No. 1 allows for an estimated saving for the State of between USD 245 million to USD 340 million.*\n\n*2. But even if the comparison of Addendum No. 1 and the Financial Model made by the Contralor\u00eda were accepted as valid, the discount rate applied does not reflect the opportunity cost for the State. Upon correction of the discount rate, Addendum No. 1 would allow for savings for the State amounting to USD 56 million rather than a USD 40 million loss.*\n\n*3. The Contralor\u00eda asserts that Addendum No. 1 changes the economic-financial balance of the contract because the financial risk is transferred to the State. However, Addendum No. 1 does not alter the economic-financial balance of the Concession Contract because: [\u2026]*\n\n*c. To mitigate this problem, Addendum No. 1 amended the payment mechanism, by respecting the original financial proposal, maintaining the economic-financial balance and eliminating the excessive payment of interest.188*\n\nClaimants' Memorial, para. 126; **Exhibit C-36**, News article published by El Comercio, \"*Mart\u00edn Vizcarra renuncia al MTC tras dejar sin efecto contrato de Chinchero*,\" 22 May 2017.\n\nClaimants' Memorial, para. 120; **Exhibit C-78**, \"*Comunicado en relaci\u00f3n a observaciones realizadas por la Contralor\u00eda*,\" 22 May 2017, MEF.\n\nClaimants' Reply, para. 94; **Exhibit C-185**, News articles published by Agencia Peruana de Noticias Andina, \"*MEF: adenda sobre Chinchero genera ahorro econ\u00f3mico y no perjuicio econ\u00f3mico*\" , 22 May 2017.

According to Mr. Giuffra, until that point in time, Peru's position was to try to renegotiate the Concession Contract with Kuntur Wasi.

When asked by Counsel for the Claimants at the Hearing, Mr. Giuffra said he did not remember exactly when that conversation had taken place.195 Mr. Giuffra explained that this six-month period would have introduced a significant delay to the Project and was unacceptable to the Respondent, given that Kuntur Wasi had already had three years since the Concession Contract was signed to obtain the financing. Mr. Giuffra further explained that Kuntur Wasi's request indicated to the Respondent that Kuntur Wasi would not be able to obtain the funding for the Project and therefore, any further renegotiation efforts would have been in vain.196\n\nTranscript Day 5 (English), 912:20-22.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, paras. 121, 122; **Exhibit RWS-1**, First Giuffra Statement, paras. 9-11; Transcript, Day 5 (Spanish), 993-994:1.\n\n187.\n\nOn the other hand, the Claimants refer to an announcement on 2 June 2017, by Congressman Lescano, indicating that, depending on the Government's decision with respect to Kuntur Wasi, he would impeach Minister Giuffra.197 According to the Claimants, this announcement led to a telephone conversation held on 3 June 2017 (*i.e.,* two days after the *Hoja de Ruta*), between Minister Giuffra and Mr. Vargas, in which the former informed Kuntur Wasi that the MTC would terminate the Concession Contract by mutual agreement because of the \"political tension between the Executive, on the one hand, and the Congress and the Contralor\u00eda on the other, was unbearable.\"198 Mr. Giuffra denies that the termination decision was politically motivated, arguing that it was based purely on technical and formal aspects based on the circumstances of the case.199\n\nClaimants' Reply, paras. 111, 112.\n\n**Exhibit CWS-4**, First Vargas Loret de Mola Statement, para. 42.

JURISDICTION**\n--------------------\n\n220.\n\nPeru argues that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction over **(A)** the BIT claims, because Kuntur Wasi (*i.e*., Sociedad Aeroportuaria Kuntur Wasi S.A.)is not controlled by an Argentine company and, thereby, is not an Argentine investor under BIT nor under the ICSID Convention and thus, it cannot be a claimant in this arbitration; and **(B)** the contractual claims, because Corporaci\u00f3n Am\u00e9rica -- the only foreign investor entitled to appear before this Tribunal -- is not a party to either the Concession Contract or the Guarantee Agreement, and Kuntur Wasi -- which is a party to those contracts and may raise contractual claims \u2014 is not a proper claimant in this arbitration.\n\n**A. The Tribunal\u2019s Jurisdiction Over Kuntur Wasi\u2019s Treaty Claims**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**(1)The Parties' Positions**\n-----------------------------\n\n***a. The Respondent's Position***\n----------------------------------\n\n221.\n\nThe Respondent's first jurisdictional objection concerns Kuntur Wasi's standing to bring claims under the BIT. In particular, the Respondent asserts that the Claimants have failed to prove that Kuntur Wasi \u2013 a Peruvian entity \u2013 is a protected investor under the BIT and the ICSID Convention by virtue of foreign control.252\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, para. 154.\n\n222.\n\nOn the Respondent's case, both the ICSID Convention and the BIT permit a Peruvian company to bring a dispute to ICSID arbitration against Peru only where the claimants can prove actual or effective \"foreign control*.*\"253 Control may exist by reason of the percentage of shares held, legal rights conferred in instruments or agreements, or a combination of these, and the specific voting rights that the share ownership confers.254\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, paras. 155, 156.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, paras. 159-161.\n\n223.\n\nThe Respondent acknowledges that reference to Article 25(2)(b)of the ICSID Convention in the Concession Contract and in the Guarantee Agreement indicates that at the time of signing, the Parties agreed to treat Kuntur Wasi as a foreign national for purposes of the ICSID Convention.255 However, according to the Respondent, the Claimants must prove both that Kuntur Wasi is actually controlled by Corporaci\u00f3n Am\u00e9rica and that Peru consented to treat Kuntur Wasi as an Argentine company for purposes of the ICSID Convention and the BIT.256\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, para. 203.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, paras. 157, 163, citing **Exhibit RL-9**, *Vacuum Salt Products Limited v. Republic of Ghana*, ICSID Case No. ARB/92/1, Award, 16 February 1994 (hereinafter *Vacuum Salt v. Ghana*), para. 36 (\"*[T]he parties' agreement to treat Claimant as a foreign national 'because of foreign control' does not ipso jure confer jurisdiction*.\"); **Exhibit RL-10**, *Autopista Concesionada de Venezuela, C.A. v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela*, ICSID Case No. ARB/00/5, Decision on Jurisdiction, 27 September 2001 (hereinafter *Autopista v. Venezuela*), paras. 110-126 (determining whether the U.S. owner of a Venezuelan company in fact controlled that company notwithstanding the parties' agreement to treat such a company as a foreign company for the purposes of Article 25(2)(b)of the ICSID Convention); Respondent's Rejoinder, para. 201.\n\n224.\n\nOn the Respondent's case, the Claimants have failed to prove control in their own pleaded case. First, the Respondent argues that \"negative control\" or veto power does not suffice to establish foreign control.257 According to the Respondent, having veto power only means that Kuntur Wasi cannot take any affirmative corporate decision without the agreement and consent of both Andino and Corporaci\u00f3n Am\u00e9rica; and therefore, neither of them \"effectively controls\" the company in terms of the BIT. In the Respondent's view, the affirmative power to govern and manage the local company (and not merely a veto right over certain decisions)is the international law standard for control applicable to this dispute.258\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, para. 165.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, paras. 205 *et seq*.\n\n225.\n\nThe Respondent's main arguments against Corporaci\u00f3n Am\u00e9rica's alleged control over Kuntur Wasi are the following:259\n\na. Corporaci\u00f3n Am\u00e9rica's lack of a controlling shareholding in Kuntur Wasi: Corporaci\u00f3n Am\u00e9rica has always held the same percentage of shares as Andino and has always nominated the same number of board members.260 Kuntur Wasi's own corporate documents show that 50% voting power is insufficient to direct significant corporate decisions, which must be approved with a qualified majority of 67% of the voting shares during shareholder meetings.261\n\nb. Corporaci\u00f3n Am\u00e9rica's lack of authority to control Kuntur Wasi's corporate decisions: The fact that decisions of the Board of Directors require the approval of three out of four directors, while Corporaci\u00f3n Am\u00e9rica only had the power to appoint two directors, and therefore, any significant decisions would require the approval by Andino's directors, shows that Corporaci\u00f3n Am\u00e9rica has never had the power to control Kuntur Wasi's corporate decisions.262\n\nc. Corporaci\u00f3n Am\u00e9rica's lack of managerial or operational control over Kuntur Wasi at any level263: According to the Respondent, the fact that Corporaci\u00f3n Am\u00e9rica had the technical knowledge and experience to advance the Chinchero Airport Project and that Kuntur Wasi would not have been chosen in the tender process without Corporaci\u00f3n Am\u00e9rica carries no legal weight and does not prove control within the meaning of the ICSID Convention or the BIT.264 Furthermore, even on the Claimants' own case, the two individuals most responsible for the Project's progress were Mr. Arruda and Mr. Mobilia, both employees of Corporaci\u00f3n Am\u00e9rica, who had no apparent role in Kuntur Wasi (such as managing or directing Kuntur Wasi employees), nor did they take actions on behalf of Kuntur Wasi.\n\nRather, the facts show that Andino managed Kuntur Wasi, given that Andino: (i)identified the Chinchero Airport Project; (ii)selected Corporaci\u00f3n Am\u00e9rica as its partner; (iii)recommended that Mr. Jos\u00e9 Balta, Andino's Chief Financial Officer at the time, served as Kuntur Wasi's General Manager; (iv)conducted Kuntur Wasi's outreach to the Peruvian State; and (v)Mr. Vargas, Andino's CEO, was the Chairman of Kuntur Wasi's *Directorio*.265\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, para. 203.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, para. 165.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, para. 166.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, para. 166.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, paras. 231 *et seq*.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, para. 167.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, para. 235.\n\n226.\n\nIn the Respondent's view, if a foreign company is to \"control\" a domestic company through its knowledge and expertise as the Claimants argue, the foreign company must use its knowledge and experience to manage or direct the actions of the domestic company. In other words, the \"controlling\" company must lend this expertise to the domestic company, for example by appointing managers or directors that govern the domestic company, thus utilizing the expertise of the controlling company.266 Yet, in this case, the Claimants have not presented evidence that Corporaci\u00f3n Am\u00e9rica in fact exerted influence over the management of Kuntur Wasi.267\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, para. 236.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, para. 244.\n\n227.\n\nMoreover, according to the Respondent, the Claimants have not identified a single case where a tribunal held that a foreign investor controlled a local company through knowledge, expertise, and management where the foreign company (i)did not own a majority of shares in the domestic company; and (ii)did not appoint the majority of the domestic company's board of directors.268\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, paras. 237-243.\n\n228.\n\nThe Respondent also denies that the BIT Protocol, on which the Claimants rely, is helpful to their case on jurisdiction.269 In particular, the Respondent argues that the BIT Protocol indicates that control may be found to exist, among others, when there is a \"[a] direct or indirect percentage of shareholding in the capital of a juridical person that permits an effective control such as, in particular, a shareholding in the capital greater than half.\"270 Yet, Corporaci\u00f3n Am\u00e9rica holds only 50% of Kuntur Wasi's shares, which is not \"greater than half.\"\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, paras. 224 *et seq*.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, para. 161.\n\n229.\n\nAnother factor that indicates control under the BIT Protocol is \"[d]irect or indirect possession of the quantity of votes that permits to have a dominant position in the corporate bodies or decisively influence the operation of the legal entity.\"271 In this case, a 50% holding cannot be considered to confer a dominant position since the other shareholder, Andino, possess the same number of shares, and therefore, Corporaci\u00f3n Am\u00e9rica does not have the power to \"decisively influence\" the operation of Kuntur Wasi.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, para. 162. According to the Respondent, the Board of Directors' composition reflects this power equality (two directors for each shareholder, while three are required for approving resolutions).\n\n230.\n\nAs a result, the Respondent argues that the only foreign investor and legitimate Claimant entitled to appear before this Tribunal is Corporaci\u00f3n Am\u00e9rica, and Kuntur Wasi must be dismissed from the proceeding.272\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, para. 170.\n\n***b. The Claimants' Position***\n--------------------------------\n\n231.\n\nThe Claimants assert that the Tribunal has jurisdiction over the Claimants' treaty claims as well as over Kuntur Wasi's claims arising from the Concession Contract and the Guarantee Agreement.273 In the Claimants' view, the basis for the Tribunal's jurisdiction over Kuntur Wasi's claims is found in Articles 1(2)(c) and Article 10 of the BIT, Article 25(2)(b)of the ICSID Convention and Clause 16.6.1 of the Concession Contract.274\n\nClaimants' Memorial, paras. 170 *et seq*.\n\nClaimants' Memorial, paras. 172, 177, 183, 190.\n\n232.\n\nWith respect to the Respondent's jurisdictional objection in relation to Kuntur Wasi's treaty claims, the Claimants argue that Kuntur Wasi satisfies the requirements to bring a claim under Article 10 of the BIT, in particular because:\n\n(i)the dispute relates to Kuntur Wasi's protected investments and Peru's breaches of the BIT;275\n\n(ii)the dispute is between an investor of one Contracting Party against the other Contracting Party.276 According to the Claimants, Kuntur Wasi is a protected investor because, although it is an entity constituted under the laws of Peru, it is effectively controlled by Corporaci\u00f3n Am\u00e9rica, an Argentinean legal entity;277\n\n(iii)Kuntur Wasi observed the six-month period to amicably settle the dispute (the dispute was notified on 18 July 2017 and the Request for Arbitration was filed on 21 June 20 18);278 and\n\n(iv)Kuntur Wasi has not submitted its dispute to domestic courts.279\n\nClaimants' Memorial, para. 199.\n\nClaimants' Memorial, para. 200.\n\nClaimants' Memorial, para. 201.\n\nClaimants' Memorial, para. 202\n\nClaimants' Memorial, para. 203.\n\n233.\n\nThe Claimants also assert that Kuntur Wasi meets the requirements of Article 25(2)(b)of the ICSID Convention because:\n\n(i)there is a legal dispute between the Parties arising directly out of the Concession Contract, the Guarantee Agreement and the BIT;280\n\n(ii)both Peru and Kuntur Wasi consented to submit disputes under the BIT and disputes under the Concession Contract to ICSID;281 and\n\n(iii)the dispute is between Peru, which is a contracting state to the ICSID Convention, and Kuntur Wasi, who Peru consented would be treated as a \"national of another State\"282 for purposes of Article 25(2)(b)of the ICSID Convention by virtue of foreign control.283\n\nClaimants' Memorial, para. 186.\n\nClaimants' Memorial, para. 188.\n\nClaimants' Memorial, para. 192; **Exhibit C-4**, Concession Contract, Cl. 16.6.1(b).\n\nClaimants' Memorial, paras. 187, 206.\n\n234.\n\nWith respect to the element of \"control\" under Article 25(2)(b)of the ICSID Convention, the Claimants acknowledge that they must demonstrate *both* that the host State has consented to treat domestic incorporated entities that are controlled by foreign nationals as protected investors (subjective criterion)*and* that the local entity is, in fact, foreign controlled (objective criterion).284\n\nClaimants' Memorial, para. 211; Claimants' Reply, para. 193.\n\n235.\n\nWith respect to the subjective criterion, relying on an opinion by Professor Schreuer, the Claimants argue that Peru agreed to treat Kuntur Wasi as a foreign investor through Clause 16.6.1(b)(i)of the Concession Contract, Clause 3 of the Guarantee Agreement and Article 1(2)c)of the BIT.285 The Claimants' position with respect to the legal value of Clause 16.6.1 of the Concession Contract varied throughout their pleadings. At first, the Claimants \u2013 relying on the opinion of Prof. Schreuer \u2013 argued that this contractual acknowledgement is not enough by itself to prove control, but it creates \"a strong presumption in favour of foreign control\"286 given that it presupposes that Peru considered, at the time of signing the Concession Contract, that Kuntur Wasi was, in fact, controlled by a foreign entity.287 In this context, the Claimants also argued that where there is an express agreement to treat a local entity as \"foreign,\" coupled with the extensive definition of control under the relevant BIT, tribunals should be less *rigorous* in relation to the concept of control.288 However, in subsequent pleadings, the Claimants escalated this argument to an estoppel allegation, claiming that Peru cannot contest the fact that it agreed and recognized that Kuntur Wasi should be deemed as a foreign investor for the purposes of ICSID arbitration.289\n\nClaimants' Reply, paras. 196-199; Claimants' Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, paras. 36 *et seq*.\n\n**Exhibit CER-5**, Schreuer Report, para. 155: \"\u2026 this clause represents a recognition by Peru of the fact that Kuntur Wasi is controlled by Corporaci\u00f3n Am\u00e9rica for purposes of Article 25(2)(b)of the ICSID Convention. This recognition creates a strong presumption in favour of foreign control that is difficult to challenge by the State that has agreed to it.\"\n\nClaimants' Reply, paras. 203-205; Claimants' Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, paras. 35-42. According to the Claimants, Peru has unequivocally and consistently recognized that Corporaci\u00f3n Am\u00e9rica controls Kuntur Wasi, not only through Clause 16 of the Concession Contract but also because Peru again adopted the same arbitration clause when it negotiated the Addendum, and it never raised any objection to Corporaci\u00f3n Am\u00e9rica's control until this arbitration.\n\nClaimants' Reply, para. 221.\n\nClaimants' Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, paras. 35-50.\n\n236.\n\nWith respect to the objective criterion, the Parties' disagreement concerns whether Kuntur Wasi was *effectively* foreign controlled.290 In this regard, the Claimants argue that:\n\n(i)The ICSID Convention purposefully does not define \"control\" and that there is nothing either in the negotiating history of the ICSID Convention nor in its context, object and purpose that would require affirmative control (\"*control afirmativo*\")or effective control (\"*control efectivo*\")as the Respondent contends.291\n\n(ii)With respect to the Concession Contract, the Claimants acknowledge that the Concession Contract does not contain any definition of control for purposes of Clause 16.6.1(b)(i).292\n\n(iii)As for the BIT, the Claimants argue that Article 1(2)of the BIT sets out a broad definition of \"investor\" and that the BIT Protocol (which is an integral part of the BIT with equal legal value)establishes that the element of control is satisfied if the foreign entity exercises \"*control efectivo\"* or holds a dominant position (\"*posici\u00f3n determinante*\"). According to the Claimants, having a majority shareholding is one of the ways in which effective control may be had, but it is not a formal requirement for control and even less to prove that Corporaci\u00f3n Am\u00e9rica has a \"*posici\u00f3n determinante.*\" The Claimants further argue that the BIT Protocol allows the Tribunal to consider any reasonable control criteria, given that it uses the expression \"among others\" (\"*entre otros*\")before listing the examples and that \"*control afirmativo*\" is not a requirement for establishing either \"*control efectivo*\" or a \"*posici\u00f3n determinante.*\"293\n\nClaimants' Reply, paras. 198-202.\n\nClaimants' Reply, paras. 207 *et seq*; Claimants' Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, paras. 54 *et seq*.\n\nClaimants' Reply, para. 220.\n\nClaimants' Reply, paras. 215-219; Claimants' Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, paras. 60 *et seq*.\n\n237.\n\nTurning to the facts of the case, the Claimants argue that Corporaci\u00f3n Am\u00e9rica \"decisively influences*\"* Kuntur Wasi within the meaning of the second example listed in the BIT Protocol.294 In particular, the Claimants rely on the following facts to sustain their argument that Corporaci\u00f3n Am\u00e9rica has always been able to exercise \"decisive influence*\"* over Kuntur Wasi:\n\n(1)Formal corporate structure and composition of the board indicate that Kuntur Wasi's decisions required Corporaci\u00f3n Am\u00e9rica's approval: Corporaci\u00f3n Am\u00e9rica has always held 50% of Kuntur Wasi's shares and has always been able to designate two out of four directors to the *Directorio*. Given that all corporate decisions required 67% of the voting shares, Corporaci\u00f3n Am\u00e9rica's approval has been necessary for all decisions within Kuntur Wasi and therefore, Corporaci\u00f3n Am\u00e9rica has had \"negative control\" (\"*control negativo*\")over Kuntur Wasi.295\n\nOn the Claimants' case, the fact that Mr. Vargas (President of the *Directorio*)and Mr. Balta, General Manager of Kuntur Wasi, were both Andino's employees, does not alter the fact that Corporaci\u00f3n Am\u00e9rica had to approve all decisions within Kuntur Wasi.296\n\n(2)Operational management and technical expertise: Relying on Prof. Schreuer's opinion, the Claimants argue that investment treaty tribunals have considered the foreign investor's ability to direct the decisions of the local entity on the basis of experience and know-how as indicative of foreign control.297 To prove operational management, the Claimants rely on the fact that Corporaci\u00f3n Am\u00e9rica was the only shareholder with the required technical expertise and know-how to win the bidding process and to carry out the construction and operation of the Chinchero Airport.298 According to the Claimants, by requiring that Corporaci\u00f3n Am\u00e9rica have a Minimum Ownership Interest (\"*Participaci\u00f3n M\u00ednima*\")in the project of at least 25% of the shares from the date of the Concession Contract until at least 5 years from the commencement of the Operational Stage of the Chinchero Airport, Peru implicitly acknowledged that Corporaci\u00f3n Am\u00e9rica managed Kuntur Wasi.299\n\nThe Claimants further allege that Kuntur Wasi was a special purpose vehicle created exclusively for purposes of constructing and managing the airport and that, without Corporaci\u00f3n Am\u00e9rica's participation, it would never have been able to meet that purpose.300 In fact, under the Concession Contract \u2013 drafted unilaterally by Peru \u2013 Corporaci\u00f3n Am\u00e9rica was the entity required under the Concession Contract to carry out the main obligations related to the management of the Chinchero Airport.301 In practice, this was indeed the case as Corporaci\u00f3n Am\u00e9rica was also the shareholder that led Kuntur Wasi's compliance with the obligations under the Concession Contract, such as the EDI and obtaining the required financing.302\n\nThe Claimants deny the Respondent's argument that the two individuals most responsible for the Project's progress (Mr. Arruda and Mr. Mobilia)acted at all times as employees of Corporaci\u00f3n Am\u00e9rica and not through Kuntur Wasi. According to the Claimants, even though the preparation of the EDI and the negotiations to obtain financing were led by Corporaci\u00f3n Am\u00e9rica, both actions were closely coordinated with Kuntur Wasi.303\n\nFinally, according to the Claimants, by requiring that only Corporaci\u00f3n Am\u00e9rica (and not Andino)undertake \"not to prevent, by any actions or omissions, Kuntur Wasi from conducting its usual business and particularly any activities involved in the execution of the Concession Contract,\"304 Peru further acknowledged that Corporaci\u00f3n Am\u00e9rica was the only shareholder that could direct Kuntur Wasi's actions.\n\nClaimants' Reply, paras. 228-232; Claimants' Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, paras. 63 *et seq*.\n\nClaimants' Memorial, para. 215; Claimants' Reply, paras. 217, 226, 227, 232-238; Claimants' Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, paras. 79, 80, 101.\n\nClaimants' Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, paras. 81-83.\n\nClaimants' Reply, paras. 242, 243, citing **Exhibit CER-5,** Schreuer Report, para. 80; **Exhibit CL-159**, *Compagnie d'Exploitation du Chemin de Fer Transgabonais v.

As such, the Tribunal has jurisdiction over the claims brought by Kuntur Wasi in these proceedings.\n\n240.\n\nThe following sections detail the analysis of the Tribunal of these issues. At the outset, the Tribunal notes that these issues raise questions of international law and treaty interpretation.\n\n***a. Under the ICSID Convention***\n-----------------------------------\n\n241.\n\nThe starting point for the Tribunal's analysis is the ICSID Convention. Article 25 of the ICSID Convention provides in relevant part:\n\n*Article 25*\n\n*(1)The jurisdiction of the Centre shall extend to any legal dispute arising directly out of an investment, between a Contracting State (or any constituent subdivision or agency of a Contracting State designated to the Centre by that State)and a national of another Contracting State, which the parties to the dispute consent in writing to submit to the Centre. When the parties have given their consent, no party may withdraw its consent unilaterally.*\n\n*(2)\"National of another Contracting State\" means:*\n\n*(a)any natural person who had the nationality of a Contracting State other than the State party to the dispute on the date on which the parties consented to submit such dispute to conciliation or arbitration as well as on the date on which the request was registered pursuant to paragraph (3)of Article 28 or paragraph (3)of Article 36, but does not include any person who on either date also had the nationality of the Contracting State party to the dispute; and;*\n\n*(b)any juridical person which had the nationality of a Contracting State other than the State party to the dispute on the date on which the parties consented to submit such dispute to conciliation or arbitration and any juridical person which had the nationality of the Contracting State party to the dispute on that date and which, because of foreign control, the parties have agreed should be treated as a national of another Contracting State for the purposes of this Convention. (Emphasis added).*\n\n242.\n\nThere is no dispute over any of the elements of Article 25 other than the ultimate one: whether Kuntur Wasi is a \"national of another Contracting State\" within the second part of Article 25(2)(b). This provision, as other tribunals have observed, constitutes an exception to the general rule that a national of a Contracting State cannot bring claims against that State. In considering this issue, the Tribunal will first assess the significance of the Parties' agreement in Clause 16.6.1 of the Concession Contract that Kuntur Wasi is a national of another Contracting State by virtue of being under foreign control.\n\n243.\n\nThe specific language of the Concession Contract, Article 16.6.1(b), is as follows:\n\n*The GRANTOR, on behalf of the Government of the Republic of Peru, states that the CONCESSIONAIRE shall be considered as a National of Another Contracting State, since it is subject to foreign control as provided for in Article 25(2)(b)of the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States, and the CONCESSIONAIRE agrees to be considered as such.306*\n\n**Exhibit C-4**, Concession Contract, Cl. 16.6.1(b). [Tribunal's translation] The original Spanish reads: \"*Para efectos de tramitar los procedimientos de arbitraje internacional de derecho, de conformidad con las reglas de arbitraje del CIADI, el CONCEDENTE, en representaci\u00f3n del Estado de la Rep\u00fablica del Per\u00fa, declara que al CONCESIONARIO se le considerar\u00e1 como \"Nacional de Otro Estado Contratante\", por estar sometido a control extranjero seg\u00fan lo establece el Literal b)del Numeral 2 del Art\u00edculo 25 del Convenio sobre Arreglos de Diferencias Relativas a Inversiones entre Estados y nacionales de otros Estado, y el CONCESIONARIO acepta que se le considere como tal.*\"\n\n244.\n\nThis language, which appears within the clause of the Concession Contract submitting legal disputes to ICSID arbitration, is manifestly designed with Article 25(b)(2)of the Convention in mind. Indeed, it references that provision explicitly, and uses the precise language of the Convention. It therefore seems evident that its purpose was to express the Parties' agreement to treat Kuntur Wasi as a national of Argentina for purposes of any investment dispute such as this one.\n\n245.\n\nThis agreement and declaration of the Respondent is reinforced by the Guarantee Agreement, which first affirms, *inter alia,* all the declarations of the Concessionaire in the Concession Contract in the following terms:\n\n*2.1 Under this GUARANTEE CONTRACT, THE STATE guarantees to the CONCESSIONAIRE COMPANY, the Grantor's representations, warranties, and obligations under the Concession Contract. This guarantee is not a financial guarantee.307*\n\n**Exhibit C-49**, Guarantee Agreement, Cl. 2.1. This is an English translation provided at para. 230 of the Respondent's Counter-Memorial. The original Spanish reads: \"*2.1 En virtud del presente CONTRATO DE GARANTIA, EL ESTADO garantiza a LA SOCIEDAD CONCESIONARIA, las declaraciones, seguridades y obligaciones del Concedente establecidas en el CONTRATO DE CONCESION. Esta garant\u00eda no constituye una garant\u00eda financiera*\"\n\n246.\n\nThe question, therefore, is whether such a clause, reinforced by the Guarantee Agreement, is sufficient to meet the requirements of Article 25(2)(b)of the Convention, which by its terms includes two elements: consent to arbitration, and the existence of foreign control at the time of that consent. Both the Parties, the Claimants' uncontroverted expert, Professor Schreuer, and prior decisions interpreting this provision, seem to be in agreement that it does not, although both the Claimants' expert and key decisions indicate that it should be given presumptive effect with respect to the issue of foreign control. As Professor Schreuer has stated (in reference to Clause 16.6.1(b)(i)of the Concession Contract):\n\n*154. This clause in the Concession Contract between Peru and Kuntur Wasi, is an unequivocal agreement that, because of foreign control, the parties have agreed that Kuntur Wasi should be treated as a national of another Contracting State for the purposes of Article 25(2)(b)of the ICSID Convention.*\n\n*155. At the same time, this clause represents a recognition by Peru of the fact that Kuntur Wasi is controlled by Corporaci\u00f3n Am\u00e9rica for purposes of Article 25(2)(b)of the ICSID Convention. This recognition creates a strong presumption in favour of foreign control that is difficult to challenge by the State that has agreed to it.*308\n\n**Exhibit CER-5**, Schreuer Report, paras. 154, 155.\n\n247.\n\nThe *Vacuum Salt v. Ghana* decision, on which the Respondent relies heavily in its submissions, and a seminal decision interpreting Article 25(2)(b), stated as follows:\n\n*[T]he parties' agreement to treat Claimant as a foreign national because of foreign control\" does not ipso jure confer jurisdiction. The reference in Article 25(2)(b) to foreign control necessarily sets an objective Convention limit beyond which ICSID jurisdiction cannot exist and parties therefore lack power to invoke same no matter how devoutly they may have desired to do so.309*\n\n**Exhibit RL-9***,* Vacuum Salt v. Ghana, para. 36.\n\n248.\n\nThe Tribunal in *Vacuum Salt v. Ghana* went on to conclude that:\n\n*[T]he existence of consent to an arbitration clause such as [the one in that case] in circumstances such that jurisdiction could be premised only on the second clause of Article 25(2)(b) raises a rebuttable presumption that the foreign control criterion of the second clause of Article 25(2)(b)has been satisfied on the date of consent.310*\n\n**Exhibit RL-9***,* Vacuum Salt v. Ghana, para. 38.\n\n249.\n\nThe *Autopista v. Venezuela* jurisdictional decision, also relied upon by the Respondent, did not use the language of presumption, but instead used to similar effect language of deference absent evidence of abuse:\n\n*[I]t is the task of the Tribunal to determine whether the parties have exercised their autonomy within the limits of the ICSID Convention, i.e. whether they have defined foreign control on the basis of reasonable criteria. For this purpose, the Tribunal has to review the concrete circumstances of the case without being limited by formalities. However, as long as the definition of foreign control chosen by the parties is reasonable and the purposes of the Convention have not been abused (for example in cases of fraud or misrepresentation), the Arbitral Tribunal must enforce the parties' choice.311*\n\n**Exhibit RL-10**, *Autopista v. Venezuela*, para. 116. In that case, the Tribunal respected the parties' choice to limit the inquiry to direct shareholding, finding that it constituted a reasonable test for control (paras. 120-211). This Tribunal is not so restricted.\n\n250.\n\nThe Tribunal finds the approach of treating the Concession Contract's provisions as presumptive and therefore rebuttable by facts demonstrating the lack of any reasonable basis for the parties' designation to be an appropriate one.312 The references to \"abuse\" by the *Autopista v. Venezuela* tribunal, and Professor Schreuer's own opinion, suggest that the Parties' agreement would have to constitute \"an unreasonable selection of nationality that cannot be sustained by any rational interpretation of the facts*.*\"313\n\n**Exhibit CER-5,** Schreuer Report, para. 155\n\n**Exhibit CL-154**, *C. Schreuer, L. Malintoppi, A Reinisch, A. Sinclair,* The ICSID Convention: A Commentary (2d ed., 2009), Art. 25, para. 815.\n\n251.\n\nSeveral arguments have been raised by Respondent regarding the facts and circumstances that in this case could rebut the presumption of foreign control. Principal among these is the argument that negative control is not sufficient to establish control. The Respondent also takes issue with the other facts and circumstances that have been put forth by the Claimants as indicia of control. The Tribunal will consider each in turn.\n\n252.\n\nFirst, there is no dispute on the factual record that Corporaci\u00f3n Am\u00e9rica exercises power over the adoption of Kuntur Wasi's corporate decisions. Corporaci\u00f3n Am\u00e9rica owns, or owned during the relevant period, 50% of the stock of Kuntur Wasi, and had the right to appoint, and did appoint, 50% of the members of the Board of Directors of the company (two out of four). It had the power, under the constitutive documents of Kuntur Wasi, to block virtually any important decision of the company, by virtue of the shareholder and Board of Directors supermajority voting provisions, including the requirement that decisions of the Board of Directors require the approval of three out of four directors.314\n\n**Exhibit C-17**, Constitutive Documents of Kuntur Wasi, 11 June 2014, art. 29, (requiring the presence of 67% of the voting shares for a quorum to be established for shareholder meetings), art. 30 (requiring approval by 67% of the voting shares), art. 48 (quorum for directors is half plus one), art. 51 (the vote of three members of the Board required to adopt a matter).\n\n253.\n\nHowever, Corporaci\u00f3n Am\u00e9rica could not affirmatively drive decisions of Kuntur Wasi through those channels, because the other 50% shareholder, Andino, possessed the equal power to approve or block such decisions, whether in shareholder or Board of Directors meetings. Indeed, Corporaci\u00f3n Am\u00e9rica's power via its shareholding and the Board of Directors are mirrored by Andino's. What Corporaci\u00f3n Am\u00e9rica could block, Andino could also block.\n\n254.\n\nIn the view of the Tribunal, \"control\" for purposes of the ICSID Convention does not turn on majority shareholding but means, as stated by Professor Schreuer, the \"actual power to steer the investment\"315 of an enterprise through whatever power (including blocking power)and authority that party may possess. While it is possible that negative control may in some cases be sufficient to achieve such a result, where blocking power is shared equally by two shareholders, as is the case here, that power would seem to fall short even of negative control. Under the formal governance provisions of Kuntur Wasi, the concerted actions of both shareholders would be necessary to take those formal decisions. It is possible, of course, that Corporaci\u00f3n Am\u00e9rica directed those formal actions, but we do not have evidence on the record to that effect. Accordingly, Corporaci\u00f3n Am\u00e9rica's power to block decisions by the shareholders or the Board of Kuntur Wasi cannot, on the facts of this case, suffice to satisfy the Convention requirement.\n\n**Exhibit CER-5**, Schreuer Report, para. 88.\n\n255.\n\nThat does not mean, however, that the inquiry must stop with the formal governance of the company. As Professor Schreuer's report, discussing the history of this provision of the Convention, and cases make clear, the standard for control is not a formalistic or formulaic one that looks solely at share ownership or governance at the Board level, or even with formal management. Rather, it is a flexible standard that looks at all the relevant facts and circumstances concerning the operation and management of the enterprise, including expertise and know-how that may lead to operational control.316\n\n**Exhibit CER-5**, Schreuer Report, paras. 53, 80; **Exhibit RL-9,** *Vacuum Salt v. Ghana,* para. 43. As the Tribunal stated: \"Each case arising under that clause must be viewed in its own particular context, on the basis of all of the facts and circumstances. There is no formula. It stands to reason, of course, that 100 percent foreign ownership almost certainly would result in foreign control, by whatever standard, and that a total absence of foreign shareholding would virtually preclude the existence of such control. How much is enough, however, cannot be determined abstractly. Thus, in the course of the drafting of the Convention, it was said variously that \"interests sufficiently important to be able to block major changes in the company\" could amount to a \"controlling interest\" (Convention History, Vol. 11, 447); that \"control could in fact be acquired by persons holding only 25 percent of\" a company's capital (id., 447-48); and even that \"51% of the shares might not be controlling\" while for some purposes \"15% was sufficient\" (id., 538). As Amerasinghe has said, \"the concept of 'control' is broad and flexible... . [T]he question is... whether the nationality chosen represents an exercise of a reasonable amount of control to warrant its choice on the basis of a reasonable criterion.\" C.F. Amerasinghe, Jurisdiction Ratione Personae Under The Convention On The Settlement Of Investment Disputes Between States and Nationals Of Other States, 1974-1975 Brit. Y.B. Int'l L. 227, 264-65.\"\n\n256.\n\nUnder all the relevant facts and circumstances of this case, the Tribunal is satisfied that the presumption of foreign control established by the stipulation in the Concession Contract is not rebutted.\n\n257.\n\nThe Tribunal finds several facts to be relevant on the issue of foreign control. First, it is important to note that Kuntur Wasi is effectively a special purpose vehicle, established solely for the purposes of carrying out the Concession Contract. This is apparent from the constitutive documents (*estatutos)* of Kuntur Wasi, which state that:\n\n*ARTICLE 2. PURPOSE. THE PURPOSE OF THE COMPANY SHALL BE SOLELY AND EXCLUSIVELY THE EXERCISE OF THE RIGHTS AND THE PERFORMANCE OF THE DUTIES UNDER THE CONCESSION CONTRACT FOR THE DESIGN, FINANCING, TAX REGISTRATION, OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE OF THE NEW CHINCHERO \u2013 CUZCO INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT (AICC)(HEREINAFTER, THE CONCESSION CONCTRACT), AS WELL AS OTHER DUTIES SET FORTH THEREIN, IN THE CAPACITY AS CONCESSIONAIRE OF THE GOVERNMENT OF THE REPUBLIC OF PERU.*317\n\n**Exhibit C-17,** Constitutive Documents of Kuntur Wasi, 11 June 2014, art. 2. [Tribunal's translation] The original Spanish reads: \"*ARTICULO 2\u02da OBJETO=== LA SOCIEDAD TIENE POR OBJETO DEDICARSE \u00daNICA Y EXCLUSIVAMENTE AL EJERCICIO DE LOS DERECHOS Y OBLIGACIONES RELATIVOS AL CONTRATO DE CONCESI\u00d3N PARA EL DISE\u00d1O, FINANCIAMIENTO, CONSTREGISTRO [sic] UNICO DE CONTRIBUYENTECI\u00d3N [sic], OPERACI\u00d3N Y MANTENIMIENTO DEL NUEVO AEROPUERTO INTERNACIONAL DE CHINCHERO \u2013 CUSCO (AICC)(EN ADELANTE, EL \"CONTRATO DE CONCESI\u00d3N\"), Y OTRAS OBLIGACIONES ESTABLECIDAS EN \u00c9STE, TENIENDO LA CALIDAD DE CONCESIONARIO DEL ESTADO DE LA REPUBLICA DEL PER\u00da*.\"\n\n258.\n\nIts sole business, therefore, is the construction and operation of the Chinchero Airport. This makes any distinction between the business of the company and the Project covered by the Concession Contract an academic one \u2013 in fact they are coterminous and congruent.\n\n259.\n\nIt is also uncontroverted that, of the company's two shareholders, only one of them \u2013 Corporaci\u00f3n Am\u00e9rica \u2013 possessed the relevant expertise in the construction and operation of airports. Andino's business was historically entirely different,318 and its selection rested on the perceived benefits of having a local shareholder for projects in Peru.319 The need for local management also drove the selection of Kuntur Wasi's management.320\n\n*See, e.g.,* **Exhibit CWS-4**, First Vargas Loret de Mola Statement, through para. 26.\n\nIndeed, the two shareholders already had experience with this model with their prior airport ventures in Peru. *See, e.g.,* **Exhibit CWS-4,** First Vargas Loret de Mola Statement, paras. 10-18.\n\n*See, e.g.,* **Exhibit CWS-2,** First Barrenechea Statement, para. 36.\n\n260.\n\nIt is clear from the bidding documents that a bidder that did not have expertise in airport construction and operation would not be technically qualified to participate in the project.321 Indeed, all the bidders who were pre-qualified on technical grounds possessed such qualifications. These technical qualifications were a \"gating\" issue. Lacking such qualifications, Andino alone could not have been awarded the Concession Contract, much less pre-qualified and been given the opportunity to bid. Corporaci\u00f3n Am\u00e9rica's participation was essential to the process.\n\n**Exhibit C-18**, Final Bidding Terms, March 2014, art. 5.1 (defining the technical and operational requirements for bidders).\n\n261.\n\nIt is also undisputed that Corporaci\u00f3n Am\u00e9rica was the consortium member qualified as the \"Strategic Investor\" in recognition of its essential technical expertise in relation to the Concession Contract's execution (both the building of the project and the operation of the airport upon its completion).322 \"Strategic Investors\" were precluded by the standard contract terms established by Peru from disposing of their interest in the concessionaire during the entire period of construction and for 5 years from the commencement of the \"operation phase.\"\n\n**Exhibit C-4**, Concession Contract, Cl. 1.68 defines \"Strategic Investor\" as follows: \"'*lnversionista(s)Estrategico(s)', es el integrante del CONCESIONARIO que acredita los requisitos t\u00e9cnico - operativos de precalificaci\u00f3n establecidos en las Bases y que es titular de por lo menos la Participaci\u00f3n M\u00ednima en el CONCESIONARIO*\"; **Exhibit C-18,** Final Bidding Terms, March 2014, art. 5.1, defined the technical and operational requirements that bidders must meet, and went on to define \"Strategic Investor\" in art. 5.1.4 on the basis of those requirements.\n\n262.\n\nClause 3.2.1(b)of the Concession Contract, required that the *estatutos* of the Concessionaire contain the following restriction, among others:\n\n*A restriction to the free transfer, disposition or encumbrance of shares or interests representing the Minimum Ownership Interest of the Strategic Investor(s)in the CONCESSIONAIRE, to third parties or other partners of the CONCESSIONAIRE until the end of the Works Execution Stage or for at least five (05)Years as from the beginning of the Operation Stage, as applicable pursuant to the technical-operational requirements informed by the Strategic Investor(s)in the Bidding stage, except for the provisions of Section 10.4.1 (c)regarding the possibility of encumbering the Minimum Ownership Interest from the beginning of the Concession for the purposes of obtaining financing.*323\n\n**Exhibit C-4,** Concession Contract, Cl. 3.2.1. b). This transfer restriction appears in art. 16 of **Exhibit C-17**, Constitutive Documents of Kuntur Wasi, 11 June 2014. [Tribunal's translation] The original Spanish reads: \"*Una restricci\u00f3n a la libre transferencia, disposici\u00f3n o gravamen de acciones o participaciones que representen la Participaci\u00f3n M\u00ednima del(os)lnversionista(s)Estrat\u00e9gico(s)en el CONCESIONARIO, a terceros o a otros socios del CONCESIONARIO hasta el t\u00e9rmino de la Etapa de Ejecuci\u00f3n de Obras o hasta por lo menos cinco (05)A\u00f1os contados desde el inicio de la Etapa de Operaci\u00f3n, seg\u00fan corresponda a los requisitos t\u00e9cnico - operativos acreditados por el(los)lnversionista(s)Estrat\u00e9gico(s)en la etapa de Concurso, salvo por lo previsto en el Literal c)del Numeral 10.4.1 de la Cl\u00e1usula D\u00e9cima respecto de la posibilidad de gravar la Participaci\u00f3n M\u00ednima desde el inicio de la Concesi\u00f3n con la finalidad de obtener financiamiento.*\"\n\n263.\n\nPeru thus locked in Corporaci\u00f3n Am\u00e9rica's participation in Kuntur Wasi for a period of years and took steps in the Concession Contract to ensure that, at least during the period relevant to this case, it would maintain a significant stake in the project - \"skin in the game.\"324\n\nThe fact that the Concession included the exclusive right to operate the Airport once it was built reinforces the importance of the role of the Strategic Investor. It is difficult to imagine that Peru would have been willing to give operating rights to a Concessionaire lacking such qualifications. Thus, more than financing capacity, the know-how and experience of the Strategic Investor in the field of airport development and operation emerges as critical to the scheme the specific concession.\n\n264.\n\nThere was also evidence adduced, principally by fact witnesses both in written testimony and at the Hearing, that Corporaci\u00f3n Am\u00e9rica provided key expertise and know-how to the Concession Contract's execution prior to its termination, including in connection with the engineering study that was completed (EDI)and the financing.325 Although the Respondent argued this expertise was not shown to have been provided on behalf of Kuntur Wasi, in the Tribunal's view, that argument relies on formalism that is not required by the relevant standard. It is plain from the evidence their efforts were in furtherance of the Concession Contract and therefore part of Kuntur Wasi's *raison d'\u00eatre.*\n\n*See, e.g.,* **Exhibit CWS-1**, First Balta del R\u00edo Statement, paras. 9, 11; **Exhibit CWS-2**, First Barrenechea Statement, paras. 23-26, 35-39; **Exhibit CWS-3**, Mobilia Statement, paras. 13-26; **Exhibit CWS-4,** First Vargas Loret de Mola Statement, paras. 23, 24.\n\n265.\n\nThe Respondent has argued based on *Vacuum Salt v. Ghana* that the technical role played by certain Corporaci\u00f3n Am\u00e9rica personnel is not probative on the issue of control. But as Professor Schreuer points out, a number of tribunals have found know-how and expertise to be relevant to the issue of control.326 Moreover, a careful examination of *Vacuum Salt* reveals key factual differences between the foreign shareholder there and Corporaci\u00f3n Am\u00e9rica's position in Kuntur Wasi. The tribunal in *Vacuum Salt* concluded that, when all the relevant facts and circumstances were considered, the foreign investor did not exercise decisive influence over the company. But in *Vacuum Salt,* the foreign shareholder held only 20% of the local entity's shares. It was not the largest shareholder or even in a coequal position with another shareholder as is the case here; rather, a local shareholder held the largest block of shares, 31%. The local shareholder also held key management roles as well, roles to which the foreign shareholder's technical activities were subordinate.327\n\n**Exhibit CER-5**, Schreuer Report, paras. 81-89, citing **Exhibit RL-10,** *Autopista v. Venezuela*; **CL-159,** *Compagnie d'Exploitation v. Gabon*; **CL-162,** *United Utilities (Tallinn)B.V. and Aktsiaselts Tallinna Vesi v. Republic of Estonia*, ICSID Case No. ARB/14/24, Award, 21 June 2019.\n\n**Exhibit RL-9**, *Vacuum Salt v. Ghana,* para. 53.\n\n266.\n\nFinally, Corporaci\u00f3n Am\u00e9rica's negative control of Kuntur Wasi, while not sufficient in and of itself to establish control, is also a relevant consideration in the totality of the facts and circumstances. Such negative control, when coupled with the other circumstances set forth above, becomes managerial in fact. Negative control in the formal governance aspects of the Company does not preclude the existence of control at the end of the day and in fact may well contribute to it. And while we do not have direct evidence on the record indicating that Corporaci\u00f3n Am\u00e9rica drove concerted decision-making by the shareholders, the Board of Directors, and management, neither do we have evidence on the record that they did not, or that the other shareholder, Andino, disagreed with them or blocked their decisions, and there is sufficient circumstantial evidence to support the inference that Corporaci\u00f3n Am\u00e9rica did so.\n\n267.\n\nFor these reasons, the Tribunal concludes that the facts and circumstances put forward by the Respondent are not sufficient to rebut the presumption created by the provisions of the Concession Contract, reinforced by the Guarantee Agreement, that Kuntur Wasi is under the control of Corporaci\u00f3n Am\u00e9rica. The Tribunal considers therefore that Kuntur Wasi is a \"national of another Contracting State\" within the meaning of the ICSID Convention based on the totality of the facts and circumstances.\n\n***b. Under the BIT***\n----------------------\n\n268.\n\nArticle 1(2)(c)of the BIT treats as an \"investor\" for purposes of the BIT:\n\n*[A]ny legal person established in accordance with the law of any country which is effectively controlled by natural or legal persons of the other Contracting Party.*328 *(Emphasis added).*\n\n**Exhibit C-50,** Per\u00fa-Argentina BIT, art. 1(2)(c). [Tribunal's translation] The original Spanish reads: \"*[T]oda persona jur\u00eddica establecida de conformidad con la legislaci\u00f3n de cualquier pa\u00eds que est\u00e9 efectivamente controlada por personas f\u00edsicas o jur\u00eddicas de la otra Parte Contratante.*\"\n\n269.\n\nThe BIT Protocol elaborates on this requirement with the following provisions:\n\n*Ad. Article 1, paragraph (2), (c). The Contracting Party in whose territory investments take place may request proof of control invoked by investors of the other Contracting Party. Any of the following facts, among others, may be considered as evidence of control:*\n\n*(i)a percentage of direct or indirect shareholding in the capital of a legal person which permits effective control, such as, in particular, a shareholding of more than half;*\n\n*(ii)direct or indirect holding of such number of votes as makes it possible to exercise a determining position in corporate bodies or to influence decisively the functioning of the legal person.*329\n\n**Exhibit C-50,** Per\u00fa-Argentina BIT, art. 1(2)(c). [Tribunal's translation] The original Spanish reads: \"*Ad. Art. 1, p\u00e1rrafo 2)(e): La Parte Contratante en cuyo territorio las inversiones tienen lugar puede solicitar la prueba del control invocado por los inversores de la otra Parte Contratante. Cualquiera de los siguientes hechos, entre otros, pueden ser considerados como evidencia del control: i)un porcentaje de participaci\u00f3n directa o indirecta en el capital de una persona jur\u00eddica que permita un control efectivo, tal como, en particular, una participaci\u00f3n en el capital superior a la mitad; ii)la posesi\u00f3n directa o indirecta de una cantidad de votos que permita tener una posici\u00f3n determinante en los \u00f3rganos societarios o influir de manera decisiva en el funcionamiento de la persona jur\u00eddica.*\"\n\n270.\n\nThe key question is therefore whether Kuntur Wasi is \"effectively controlled\" by Corporaci\u00f3n Am\u00e9rica, and whether the proof that has been submitted is evidence of such control.\n\n271.\n\nThe plain language of the BIT, particularly the use of the term \"effectively\" in relation to \"controlled\" would seem to make it clear that the standard, as with the ICSID Convention, is a functional rather than a formalistic one. And the BIT Protocol's \"*entre otros*\" language reinforces that view, as it indicates that effective control can be established by a variety of circumstances. In the Tribunal's view, and contrary to the Respondent's argument, it is not limited in its scope by the fact that the subparagraphs that follow refer to matters such as share ownership or formal management. That enumeration virtually exhausts the formal governance mechanisms, and there would be no need for the \"*entre otros\"* language if a wider scope were not contemplated. Moreover, the functional interpretation is reinforced by the \"decisive influence\" language of subparagraph (ii), which suggests that is the key consideration.\n\n272.\n\nAlthough the Concession Contract's provision discussed above regarding foreign control is framed in terms of the ICSID Convention, and not the BIT, the common link between the two is the element of control. Thus, for the same reasons that have led the Tribunal to conclude that Kuntur Wasi satisfies the requirements of Article 25(2)(b)of the Convention, the Tribunal concludes that Kuntur Wasi is also effectively controlled by a juridical person of another Contracting Party, namely, Corporaci\u00f3n Am\u00e9rica, for purposes of the BIT.\n\n273.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that for purposes of the BIT, as was the case with the ICSID Convention, the Concession Contract provision, reinforced by the Guarantee Agreement, is presumptive evidence of effective control in fact. It also considers that while the power of negative control alone is not effective control for purposes of the BIT, negative control, when coupled with the other facts and circumstances discussed above, does not preclude, and in on the facts of this case contributes to, the establishment of effective control of Kuntur Wasi by Corporaci\u00f3n Am\u00e9rica.\n\n274.\n\nFor all these reasons, the Tribunal concludes that Kuntur Wasi is effectively controlled by Corporaci\u00f3n Am\u00e9rica and therefore qualifies as an \"investor\" [of another contracting Party] under the BIT.\n\n275.\n\nThe Respondent's jurisdictional objection therefore fails, and the claims asserted by Kuntur Wasi are therefore claims that can be heard by this Tribunal.\n\n276.\n\nGiven this conclusion, the Tribunal finds it unnecessary to consider the estoppel arguments advanced by the Claimants, except to note that such arguments, especially given the existence of the Guarantee Agreement, have considerable force on the facts of this case in terms of the elements of a promise and reliance.\n\n**B.

The Respondent's Position***\n----------------------------------\n\n277.\n\nThe Respondent acknowledges that Corporaci\u00f3n Am\u00e9rica qualifies as a protected investor under the BIT.330 However, according to the Respondent, since Corporaci\u00f3n Am\u00e9rica is not a party to the Concession Contract (or the Guarantee Agreement), it cannot bring contract claims before an ICSID tribunal.331 According to the Respondent, the Concession Contract clearly sets out that only disputes between the \"Parties\" to the Concession contract may be referred to ICSID:\n\n*[When] non-technical disputes arise which involve an amount greater than Thirty Million and 00/100 Dollars (US$30,000,000.00)or its equivalent in national currency, the Parties will try to resolve such dispute through direct negotiations ... If the Parties are not able to reach agreement during the direct negotiations period referred to in the foregoing paragraph, the disputes will be resolved through international arbitration administered through the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes... . (Emphasis omitted).*332\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, para. 170.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, para. 171.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, para. 172, citing **Exhibit C-4**, Concession Contract, Cl. 16.6.1(b)(i). This is an English translation provided at para. 172 of the Respondent's Counter-Memorial. The original Spanish reads: \"*[Cuando] las Controversias No-T\u00e9cnicas que tengan un monto involucrado superior a Treinta Millones y 00/100 D\u00f3lares (USD 30 000 000,00)o su equivalente en moneda nacional, las Partes tratar\u00e1n de resolver dicha controversia v\u00eda trato directo [\u2026] En caso las Partes no se pusieran de acuerdo dentro del plazo de trato directo referido en el p\u00e1rrafo precedente, las controversias suscitadas ser\u00e1n resueltas mediante arbitraje internacional de derecho administrado por el Centro Internacional de Arreglo de Diferencias Relativas a Inversiones\u2026*\"\n\n278.\n\nIn this case, the Parties to the Contract are the MTC and Kuntur Wasi; Corporaci\u00f3n Am\u00e9rica not being a Party to the Concession Contract, cannot bring any claims under it.333 And the same is true for the Guarantee Agreement.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, paras. 173.\n\n279.\n\nNor can Corporaci\u00f3n Am\u00e9rica assert contractual claims by virtue of an umbrella clause, as, according to the Respondent: (i)there is no umbrella clause in the Peru-Argentina BIT, (ii)an umbrella clause cannot be introduced by means of the MFN clause, and (iii)even in the hypothetical case that the umbrella clause was introduced into the BIT, the umbrella clause would not apply to commitments made by the MTC under the Concession Contract or the Guarantee Agreement because Corporaci\u00f3n Am\u00e9rica is not a party to either of these.334\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, paras. 174, 175. The Respondent illustrates this \"privity requirement of the umbrella clause\" citing **Exhibit RL-14**, *Burlington Resources Inc. v. Republic of Ecuador*, ICSID Case No. ARB/08/5, Decision on Liability, 14 December, 2012, para. 214; **Exhibit CL-61**, *Impregilo S.p.A v.

Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/01/12, Award, 14 July 2006 (hereinafter *Azurix Corp. v. Argetina*), para. 384.\n\n280.\n\nAs a result, while Corporaci\u00f3n Am\u00e9rica qualifies as a foreign investor and as a legitimate Claimant entitled to appear before this Tribunal, the Tribunal only has jurisdiction to hear Corporaci\u00f3n Am\u00e9rica's treaty-based claims.\n\n***b. The Claimants' Position***\n--------------------------------\n\n281.\n\nThe Claimants argue that Corporaci\u00f3n Am\u00e9rica is not bringing claims under the Concession Contract *per se*, but rather, is bringing an umbrella-clause claim based on the contractual obligations that Peru entered into *vis-\u00e0-vis* Kuntur Wasi, by virtue of applying the BIT's MFN clause (Clause 3(1)of the BIT). In the Claimants' view, the Respondent's objection is not properly a \"jurisdictional objection,\" but rather one on the merits pertaining to the scope of the BIT's MFN and umbrella clauses.335\n\nClaimants' Reply, para. 181, footnote 172.\n\n282.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, the MFN clause contained in Article 3(1)of the BIT, is broad and does not set out any prohibitions or limitations on what guarantees may be \"imported\" through its application, as the Respondent suggests.336 The Claimants assert that the Respondent has not presented proof that Peru ever showed any intention to exclude an umbrella clause from the BIT and that the Respondent's interpretation seeks to give more weight to an omission rather than the express terms of the BIT (which contains an MFN clause).337\n\nClaimants' Reply, para. 851.\n\nClaimants' Reply, para. 853.\n\n283.\n\nThe Claimants acknowledge that there is a divide in the caselaw between tribunals that support using MFN clauses to bring in procedural standards and those that consider that they should be limited to substantive standards.338 However, in this case, the Claimants argue that they are only asserting that substantive rights can be \"imported\" by application of the MFN clause.\n\nClaimants' Reply, paras. 857 *et seq*.\n\n284.\n\nFinally, the Claimants also dismiss the Respondent's argument that Corporaci\u00f3n Am\u00e9rica cannot rely on the umbrella clause because it is not privy to the Concession Contract and the Guarantee Agreement. According to the Claimants, the text of the umbrella clause of the Thailand \u2013 Peru BIT relates generally to obligations \"into which it may have entered with regard to investments\")\"339 and therefore, it does not require that the contractual obligations must have been entered into with respect to the particular investor.340 According to the Claimants, investment treaty tribunals faced with this question in the past, such as the *Casualty v. Argentina*, the *Enron v. Argentina* or the *Supervisi\u00f3n y Control v. Costa Rica* tribunals, have supported the Claimants' interpretation of similarly worded umbrella clauses.341\n\nClaimants' Reply, para. 871, citing **Exhibit CL-112**, BIT between Peru and Thailand, art. 4(e).\n\nClaimants' Reply, paras. 871-876.\n\nClaimants' Reply, paras. 873-875, citing **Exhibit CL-148**, *Continental Casualty Company v.

Costa Rica*), para. 287.\n\n**(2)The Tribunal's Analysis**\n------------------------------\n\n285.\n\nBecause the Tribunal has found that it has jurisdiction over the claims brought by Kuntur Wasi under both the ICSID Convention and the BIT, it sees no need to address here whether Corporaci\u00f3n Am\u00e9rica, notwithstanding its lack of contractual privity, can maintain claims under the Concession Contract and Guarantee Agreement, via the BIT's MFN clause*.*342\n\nWhile these issues were raised by the Respondent in connection with its objection to jurisdiction, the Respondent described them as \"consequences\" of the asserted lack of jurisdiction over Kuntur Wasi's claims rather than jurisdictional *in se* (Respondent's Counter-Memorial, para. 170). The Tribunal agrees that this is not a jurisdictional issue, but in its view, a question of admissibility and/or application of the BIT's MFN clause and the interpretation of any provisions incorporated by virtue of that clause and therefore need not be addressed here.\n\n**V. LIABILITY**\n----------------\n\n286.\n\nThe Claimants make ten claims under the Concession Contract, the Guarantee Agreement and Peruvian law, as follows:\n\n1. Peru's unilateral termination of the Concession Contract was contrary to the terms of the Contract and Peruvian law;\n\n2. Peru acted in bad faith and its conduct was inconsistent with the promises and commitments made to the Claimants;\n\n3. Kuntur Wasi's termination of the Concession Contract was valid and has consequences under Peruvian law;\n\n4. Peru's failure to make the Advance Payment constituted a breach of its obligations under the Concession Contract, as amended;\n\n5. Peru's requests that Kuntur Wasi return the Concession area were wrongful;\n\n6. Peru breached the Concession Contract by benefiting from the EDI without paying for it;\n\n7. Peru repudiated the Concession Contract;\n\n8. Peru breached the Concession Contract by failing to observe the Guarantee Agreement;\n\n9. Peru acted with *dolo* and *culpa inexcusable*; and\n\n10. Peru's actions caused damage to the image, honor and good reputation of Kuntur Wasi and its shareholders.\n\n287.\n\nThe Claimants also make multiple claims under the BIT, which are summarized in paragraph 599 *infra*. Section A of this Part of the Decision will address the contractual and Peruvian law claims in the order set forth above, while Section B will address the BIT and international law claims.\n\n**A. Peru's alleged breach of the Concession Contract, the Guarantee Agreement and Peruvian law**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**(1)Peru's unilateral termination of the Concession Contract was contrary to the terms of the Concession Contract and Peruvian law**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n***a. The Parties' Positions***\n-------------------------------\n\n**(i)The Claimants' Position**\n------------------------------\n\n288.\n\nThe Claimants' first claim on the merits is that Peru breached the Concession Contract by declaring its unilateral termination without cause. According to the Claimants, Clause 15.5.1 of the Contract allowed Peru to unilaterally terminate the Contract for public interest reasons.343 However, the Claimants argue that the Contract did not permit the termination of the Contract at will; rather, the MTC had to establish that there was a well-founded public interest reason to do so.344\n\nClaimants' Memorial, para. 316.\n\nClaimants' Memorial, para. 225.\n\n289.\n\nThe Claimants argue that under Peruvian law, the unilateral termination of the Concession Contract for public interest reasons must comply with the following requirements: (i)there must be a public interest justifying the termination; (ii)the request for termination must be reasoned; and (iii)the decision to terminate must be reasonable and proportional. In the Claimants' view, the Respondent did not comply with any of the above requirements, and therefore, its decision to terminate the Concession Contract unilaterally was arbitrary, illegal, invalid and constitutes, *per se*, a breach of the Concession Contract.345\n\nClaimants' Memorial, para. 226.\n\n***(a)The termination was not based on any public interest reason***\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n290.\n\nFirst, as to requirement (i)above that unilateral termination be based on a public interest reason, the Claimants argue that although it is for the State to determine what is in the public interest in each circumstance, this determination must be made in accordance with the applicable laws.346 In this regard, the Claimants point to various laws that had established that building the Chinchero Airport was in fact in the public interest. In particular, the Claimants refer the Tribunal, among others, to Article 2 of Law 27528, according to which the Chinchero Airport Project was declared \"of public necessity and use\" (\"*de necesidad y utilidad p\u00fablica*\")and was considered \"as being of the highest priority\" (\"*de la m\u00e1s alta prioridad*\"),347 and to Emergency Decree No. 039-2010 of 9 June 2010; consequently, the Peruvian Government declared that the Chinchero Airport was a project of priority and of national interest.348 According to the Claimants, these laws and regulations prove that the Peruvian State had repeatedly expressed that construction of the Chinchero International Airport was in the public interest.\n\nClaimants' Memorial, para. 229.\n\n**Exhibit CL-5**, *Ley 27528, Ley que dispone la actualizaci\u00f3n de Estudios Definitivos y la Construcci\u00f3n del Aeropuerto de Chinchero, en el Departamento del Cusco*, 4 October 2001, art. 2; Claimants' Memorial, para. 230.

Thereby, the MTC pointed out that:\n\n*The Grantor is driven to make this contractual amendment by the need to take measures in the Public Interest, that is [...] that the city of Cuzco -Chinchero has airport infrastructure in the short term\u2026*350\n\nClaimants' Memorial, paras. 234-235.\n\n**Exhibit C-76***, Informe No. 105-2017-MTC/25,* 2 February 2017, para. 5.17. [Tribunal's translation]\n\n292.\n\nLikewise, the Claimants rely on the report issued by the MEF on 27 January 2017, in which it concluded that Addendum No. 1 would result in \"significant costs savings for the Grantor,\"351 and on the OSITRAN report of 20 January 2017 favorable to Addendum No. 1, which, in the Claimants' view, confirmed the public interest in the Project.352 The Claimants further point to several public statements made by President Kuczynski, Mr. Mart\u00edn Vizcarra (by then Minister of Transport and Communications), the MTC and the MEF in early 2017, confirming that Addendum No. 1 would result in significant benefits and savings to the Peruvian State and was, therefore, in the public interest.353\n\n**Exhibit C-73**, *Informe No. 016-2017-EF/68.01,* 27 January 2017, para. 2.22; Claimants' Memorial, para. 237.

According to the Claimants, the FPAO was meant to cover only the construction costs but not the cost of financing.362 The Claimants rely on Annex 23 of the Concession Contract which established that \"Sub-Stage 2, consisting in the Execution of Works to be co-financed out of the Payment Fund of the PAO\"363; and on Clause 1.2.iii of Appendix 23, which set out that \"the aggregate amount of the valuations of the Milestone or Milestone subject to Co-financing progress shall determine the Payment Fund of the PAO.\"364 On the Claimants' view, if the FPAO is the sum of the co-financed amounts for each step of the works, it is clear that the FPAO was only meant to cover construction costs.365\n\nClaimants' Reply, paras. 459, 460.\n\n**Exhibit C-4,** Concession Contract, Annex 23 \u2013 Appendix 1, p. 542.

The Claimants assert that the ALG Model was confidential and never shared with them up until this arbitration (something which, according to the Claimants, the Respondent does not dispute). The Claimants also argue that the OSITRAN report 057/2013 contains inconsistent statements which contradict the Concession Contract as well as incomplete quotes; and is not binding, intended to complement the Concession Contract, or directed at the bidders.377\n\nClaimants' Reply, paras. 495 *et seq*.\n\n303.\n\nThe Claimants also point out that OSITRAN approved Kuntur Wasi's financial proposal and that neither the *Contralor\u00eda* nor the CAF ever suggested at the time that the Concession Contract should be terminated or that there had been any breach or wrongdoing on the part of Kuntur Wasi.378 Rather, these institutions only recommended that variable \"i\" should be renegotiated because of an ambiguity in the Concession Contract.379 In fact, the Claimants argue that Peru itself questioned the *Contralor\u00eda*'s report at the time it was issued.380\n\nClaimants' Reply, para. 178, 49, 93.\n\nClaimants' Reply, para. 14, 52-54.\n\nClaimants' Reply, paras. 92-95; **Exhibit C-185**, News article published by Agencia Peruana de Noticias Andina, \"*MEF: Adenda sobre Chinchero genera ahorro econ\u00f3mico y no perjuicio econ\u00f3mico,*\" 22 May 2017; **Exhibit C-120**, News clip from Buenos D\u00edas Per\u00fa, \"*Vizcarra sobre Chinchero*: *Decidimos dejar sin efecto contrato que desde el inicio parti\u00f3 mal,*\" 22 May 2017; **Exhibit C-121**, News clip from CANAL N, \"*Viceministra Molinelli: Informe de Contralor\u00eda no tiene sustento t\u00e9cnico,*\" 22 May 2017.\n\n304.\n\nLikewise, the Claimants argue that the Respondent never complained of the Claimants' alleged misconduct in relation to its financial proposal during the negotiation of Addendum No. 1.381 According to the Claimants, Addendum No. 1 was not motivated by Kuntur Wasi's breach, but rather because the State wanted to change the financial structure of the Concession Contract. During the negotiation of Addendum No. 1, it was Peru that proposed changing the financial structure altogether to a system in which Kuntur Wasi would not have to co-finance the works during Stage 2 and therefore, any discussions concerning variable \"i\" became futile. In Claimants' view, the evidentiary record in the arbitration proves that Addendum No. 1 was not signed at the request of or to benefit Kuntur Wasi (which lost the spread of 2.5%); but rather it was requested, designed and drafted by Peru.382\n\nClaimants' Reply, para. 15.\n\nClaimants' Reply, paras. 17, 18, 50 *et seq*.\n\n305.\n\nIn this sense, the Claimants refer, among others, to the fact that Minister Vizcarra himself acknowledged that the Contract itself did not set out how variable \"i\" should be calculated:\n\n*The MTC, in my care and strictly in accordance with the recommendations made by the Contralor\u00eda General de la Rep\u00fablica:*\n\n*1.

On the Claimants' case, Minister Vizcarra's statements are binding on Peru because he was, at the time of the statements, the Minister of Transport, which is the highest authority in relation to the Concession Contract, and because the statements were made in the context of an impeachment before Congress.

The Claimants explain that the fact that the obligations were suspended after the Contralor\u00eda's report does not indicate that either Party had the right to terminate the Contract.410 Moreover, Clause 4.3.1 of the Concession Contract expressly established that any suspension would be temporary and that the Parties had an obligation to seek to resume their obligations as soon as possible.411\n\nClaimants' Reply, para. 426.

The scenarios contemplated in the Roadmap were the basis for negotiations and required further agreement by the Parties. In any event, the Claimants argue that the State did not really engage in any negotiations with Kuntur Wasi as set out in the Roadmap given that it decided in less than three days thereafter that it would terminate the Contract.412\n\nClaimants' Reply, paras. 435 *et seq*.\n\n316.\n\nFurthermore, according to the Claimants, had the Roadmap been binding, it would not have been necessary for Peru to unilaterally terminate the Concession Contract: it would have been enough to invoke the alleged agreement reached on 1 June 2017. The Claimants also point out that, none of the reports issued by the MTC and the MINCETUR on 13 July 2017, which on Respondent's case provide the basis for the termination, mention the *Roadmap*.413\n\nClaimants' Reply, paras. 440, 441.\n\n317.\n\nFinally, the Claimants also deny having requested an additional six months after the Roadmap was signed to obtain financing, and argue that, even if that was the case, six months would have been a reasonable time to obtain financing.414\n\nClaimants' Reply, paras. 443, 444.\n\n***(b)Peru did not provide any explanation for the termination***\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n318.\n\nSecondly, as explained above under point (ii),415 the Claimants argue that under the Concession Contract and Peruvian law, the request for termination must be reasoned. In this regard, the Claimants argue that Clause 15.5.1 required that any unilateral termination of the Concession Contract be \"well-founded\" (\"*debidamente fundada\").*416 This is also a requirement set out in Peruvian law and by the Constitutional Court, which limits the exercise of public functions.417 Under Peruvian law, it is well established that the State must give sufficient reasoning for its decisions and, in particular, the reasoning must: (a)identify the particular public interest that is affected and how the public decision will solve the problem;418 (b)be clear and to the point, in other words, it cannot be abstract;419 and (c)be accurate and consistent with reality.420\n\n*See* para. 289 *supra*.\n\nClaimants' Reply, paras. 297 *et seq*.

To recall, the notification stated as follows:\n\n*\"[U]nder the current circumstances, it is not possible to carry out the Project as and when originally planned, which jeopardizes attaining the public purpose of providing Cuzco with a new international airport, which is of high interest for the whole nation.*\n\n*In this scenario, the unilateral termination of the AICC Contract as provided for in paragraph 15.5.1 thereof is the solution that best aligns with the public interests involved.\"*421\n\n**Exhibit C-44**, Oficio No. 142-2017-MTC/01, 13 July 2017, p. 2. [Tribunal's translation] The original Spanish reads: \"*[E]n la actual situaci\u00f3n no es posible concretar la ejecuci\u00f3n del Proyecto en la forma y oportunidad originalmente previstas, lo cual pone en peligro el logro de la finalidad p\u00fablica de alto inter\u00e9s nacional de dotar al Cusco de un nuevo aeropuerto internacional.

[Tribunal's translation] The original Spanish reads: \"*si a\u00fan era de inter\u00e9s p\u00fablico construir el Aeropuerto de Chinchero.*\"\n\n323.\n\nThe Claimants also point out that the Respondent's argument that these reports were the basis for its decision must fail because of the chronology of how events unfolded. In particular, the Claimants refer to the fact that the MTC only requested the reports on 12 July 2017, that is, one day before they were issued, and that it is not credible that the MTC analyzed the reports, issued the formal notice of termination, sent it to a public notary and then to the Claimants, all in a single day.429\n\nClaimants' Reply, paras. 135-139.\n\n324.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, all of this \"fast track\" contrasts with the reports issued in relation to Addendum No. 1, which specifically addressed whether signing the Addendum was in the public interest.430 In the Claimants' view, if the State were to change its view in such a radical way, the least one could expect was that the reports would explain why it was no longer in the public interest to continue with the Concession Contract. Yet, there is not a single document that analyses this.431\n\nClaimants' Reply, para. 133, 139.\n\nClaimants' Reply, paras. 139, 140.\n\n325.\n\nFinally, the Claimants also argue that the MTC's communication, in further breach of Peruvian law, contains false statements and is therefore arbitrary. In particular, the Claimants take issue with the MTC's statement that \"it [was] not possible to carry out the Project\" (\"*no es posible concretar la ejecuci\u00f3n*\").432 According to the Claimants, they always made their best efforts to finalize the execution of the Chinchero Airport as originally contemplated in the Contract and complied with the Contract and negotiated in good faith with the State when required.433 The Claimants argue that terminating the Concession Contract and appointing a new concessionaire would not have resulted in a reduction of time or costs, and Peru was well aware of this when the MTC issued the communication.434 In fact, had Peru not terminated the Concession Contract, Addendum No. 1 contemplated that the works would have begun by April 2017. Yet, Peru's unilateral termination of the Contract and the subsequent opening of a new tender process, have caused significant delays and increased costs to the State.435\n\nClaimants' Memorial, para. 279.

In particular, the Claimants argue that if a decision does not contain the reasoning on which it is based, it is not \"*debidamente fundada*\" as required by Clause 15.5.1 of the Concession Contract.436 A systemic interpretation of the Concession Contract also indicates that reasons must be given. In particular, the Claimants rely on the fact that: (a)Clause 15.5.1 requires that the unilateral termination must be notified in advance and in writing; (b)Clause 15.5.2 requires that the communication must be signed by the ministry responsible for addressing \"such a matter of public interest\" (\"*tal problema de inter\u00e9s p\u00fablico*\");437 and (c)other clauses in the Concession Contract which refer to the terms \"well-founded\" (\"*debidamente fundada*\")expressly require a supported reasoning of the decision.438 According to the Claimants, this is also a requirement under Peruvian law applicable to all acts of the administration.439\n\nClaimants' Reply, paras. 322, 323.\n\nClaimants' Reply, para. 323. [Tribunal's translation]\n\nClaimants' Reply, paras. 324, 325.\n\nClaimants' Reply, para. 328 *et seq*. According to the Claimants, there is no distinction between different types of clauses for the unilateral termination of contracts under Peruvian law.\n\n327.\n\nThe Claimants also take issue with the Respondent's position that Peruvian Administrative Law (and the requirements set out in the LPAG in particular)is not applicable to the MTC's actions in relation to the Concession Contract. The Claimants' position is that the Concession Contract is a \"legal relationship under public law\" (\"*relaci\u00f3n jur\u00eddica de derecho p\u00fablico*\" and that it relates to a concession, which is an \"*administrative act*\" (\"*acto administrativo*\"); and as such, it is governed by the rules set out in the Concession Contract itself and also in public administrative laws.440 This means that the requirements of administrative law pertaining to public acts are equally applicable to the MTC's acts in relation to the Concession Contract.441\n\nClaimants' Reply, paras. 348-352. [Tribunal's translation]\n\nClaimants' Reply, paras. 354, 355.\n\n328.\n\nThe Claimants further object to the Respondent's assertion that the State has full discretion in defining what is the public interest and what not, and that this determination is not arbitrable.442 According to the Claimants, Peru's view does not have any legal or contractual basis. The Concession Contract unequivocally sets out \u2013 in Clauses 15.5.1, 15.8.7 and 16.2.1 \u2013 that disputes related to the termination for public interest reasons, including a dispute related to whether there was a public interest, can be submitted to arbitration.443 Accepting the Respondent's interpretation of Clause 15.5.1 would deprive the requirement that the State provide \"well-founded reasons of public interest\" of any effect.444 The Claimants also assert that the Respondent's expert, Dr. Ferrando, cannot point to a single source under Peruvian law that supports its views, simply because Peruvian Law requires that decisions taken in the public interest can be submitted to dispute resolution.445\n\nClaimants' Reply, paras. 380-382.\n\nClaimants' Reply, paras. 384-388.\n\nClaimants' Reply, para. 389.

In this case, the Claimants argue that the MTC's decision to terminate the Concession Contract did not comply with the above requirements.448\n\nClaimants' Memorial, para. 291; **Exhibit CL-3**, *Tribunal Constitucional del Per\u00fa*, File No. 0090-2004-AA/TC, Judgment, 5 July 2004, para. 36; **Exhibit CL-16**, *Tribunal Constitucional del Per\u00fa, Caso Compa\u00f1\u00eda Cervecera Ambev Per\u00fa S.A.,* File No. 1209-2006-PA/TC, Judgment, 14 April 2006; para. 55.\n\nClaimants' Memorial, para. 292; **Exhibit CL-15**, *Tribunal Constitucional del Per\u00fa, Expediente 2488-2004-AA/TC*, 10 October 2006.\n\nClaimants' Memorial, para. 293.\n\n330.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, the MTC's decision to terminate the Concession Contract was neither suited to the intended purpose nor necessary to achieve said purpose, which allegedly was to reduce costs and time in constructing the Chinchero Airport.449 To the contrary, the Claimants point out that the Respondent was well aware, at the time it terminated the Contract, that having to find another concessionaire would significantly delay the Project.450 Indeed, the Claimants point out that whereas under Addendum No. 1 the works would have begun in April 2017, it wasn't until October 2019 that Peru signed a contract with the Government of Korea for the technical assistance with the Project, and it was envisaged that the contract for the commencement of the earthworks would not be signed before June 2020.451\n\nClaimants' Memorial, paras. 294, 295, 298, 299.\n\nClaimants' Memorial, para. 296, citing **Exhibit C-33**, *Respuestas al pliego interpelatorio de 83 preguntas formuladas por los Congresistas de la Rep\u00fablica en relaci\u00f3n al proyecto Aeropuerto Internacional de Chinchero \u2013 Cusco*, 18 May 2017, p. 24; Claimants' Reply, paras. 143 et seq.\n\nClaimants' Reply, paras. 145-148.\n\n331.\n\nFurthermore, the Claimants also argue that terminating the Concession Contract did not result in savings to the State, but rather the opposite, since Peru not only would have to pay compensation to Kuntur Wasi but also would be required to spend additional resources to adapt Kuntur Wasi's EDI and find another concessionaire.452 According to Kuntur Wasi, the construction of the Project under Addendum No. 1 would have cost the State US$ 410 million, whereas now, pursuant to the contract signed with the Government of Korea, it will cost a total of US$ 770 million.453\n\nClaimants' Memorial, para. 300.\n\nClaimants' Reply, para. 149.\n\n332.\n\nAs to whether the measure is proportional *stricto sensu*, Kuntur Wasi further alleges that, to the extent the termination of the Concession Contract did not result in any benefit to the State, the measure could not be deemed proportional.454\n\nClaimants' Memorial, para. 301.\n\n333.\n\nFinally, the Claimants also reject the Respondent's argument that it is not necessary to analyze the reasonableness or the proportionality of the MTC's decision.455 According to the Claimants, all decisions of public entities, when they create obligations or impose restrictions, must be limited to the competence of the entity, be proportional and adjusted to the public interest which the measure pursues.456 On the Claimants' case, not only was the MTC's termination of the Concession Contract not founded on public interest reasons; it was actually motivated by Minister Vizcarra's and Minister Giuffra's wish to avoid political pressure.457 This, on the Claimants' case, constitutes a misuse of powers.458\n\nClaimants' Reply, para. 360.\n\nClaimants' Reply, para. 367.\n\nClaimants' Reply, paras. 371 *et seq*.\n\nClaimants' Reply, para. 372.\n\n**(ii)The Respondent's Position**\n---------------------------------\n\n334.\n\nThe Respondent argues that the Concession Contract allows for the unilateral termination of the Contract by the MTC for public interest reasons, which is precisely what the MTC did.\n\n***(a)Peru terminated the Concession Contract for public interest reasons***\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n335.\n\nThe Respondent argues that the construction of the Chinchero International Airport has been declared an urgent and public necessity in Peru since 2001. This was reconfirmed by the State in 2010 and then again in 2017, when the State and the MINCETUR concluded that the construction of the Chinchero Airport was an \"urgent and public necessity Project.\"459\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, para. 187.\n\n336.\n\nOn the Respondent's case, the termination of the Concession Contract was well founded on public interest grounds because, by 2017, Kuntur Wasi had proven to be a deficient partner to build the Airport, as it was not able to put together a reasonable financial package to complete the construction of the Airport and this had caused significant delays.460 In particular, the Respondent relies on two facts to sustain that it was in the public interest to terminate the Concession Contract.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, para. 188.\n\n337.\n\nFirst, the Respondent argues that by mid-2017, Kuntur Wasi submitted a financial package that was unreasonable and would have caused an economic prejudice to the State.461 According to the Respondent, under both the *Bases* and the Concession Contract, the FPAO was the \"agreed limit\" or \"cap\" which represented the net value maximum amount the State would have to pay for the construction of the Project.462 In the Respondent's view, contrary to the Claimants' argument that the FPAO was only meant to cover the construction costs, the FPAO was not tied to any work, task or activity.463 According to the Respondent, the definition of the FPAO in paragraph 45 of the *Bases*, does not support the Claimants' argument that the FPAO was limited to construction costs, nor does Clause 1.54 or Annex 23 of the Concession Contract. Those instruments merely define the FPAO as the net value amount that serves as the basis for the calculation of the quarterly payments.464\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, para. 41.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, para. 62; Respondent's Rejoinder, paras. 44, 45.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, paras. 42, 43.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, paras. 45-47; **Exhibit C-18**, Final Bidding Terms, Annex No. 7; **Exhibit C-4**, Concession Contract, Cl. 1.54.\n\n338.\n\nThe Respondent acknowledges that PROINVERSI\u00d3N clarified during the tender process \u2013 in an answer to the bidders \u2013 that the PAO was not limited to construction costs but corresponded to the amount each bidder needed to be co-financed by the State.465 According to the Respondent, however, the fact that PROINVERSI\u00d3N only stated that the PAO was not limited to construction costs \u2013 and did not state the same in relation to the FPAO \u2013 does not mean that the FPAO and the PAO were to be comprised of different costs: in Respondent's view, the PAO is the FPAO multiplied by the interest rate (*i.e.,* the borrowing rate of the concessionaire)divided by 60.466\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, para. 50, citing **Exhibit R-84**, Memorandum No. 60 regarding Chinchero's Tender Process, 17 January 2014, questions 60, 91, 102, 105.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, para. 51.\n\n339.\n\nMoreover, according to the Respondent, it would have been absurd for the State to select the bidder on the basis of the lowest FPAO and then allow the bidder to charge the State for unlimited additional costs through the PAO. This is contrary to both the way in which the tender process was designed and the very function of public procurement processes.467\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, para. 57.\n\n340.\n\nRespondent argues that under the Claimants' interpretation of the Contract, the fact that the concept \"weighted average rate of return\" was not defined in the Contract did not mean that it was unconstrained. According to the Respondent, the fact that Appendix 1 of Annex 23 defines variable \"i\" as the \"*tasa de descuento trimestral*\" essentially means the interest rate and therefore, that the weighted average rate would be the weighted average interest rate that the concessionaire would be able to obtain for its financing.468\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, paras. 59 *et seq*.\n\n341.\n\nFinally, the Respondent also argues that bidders knew or should have known that PROINVERSI\u00d3N's assumption \u2013 based on ALG's Financial Model \u2013 was that variable \"i\" would yield a borrowing interest rate of 7.01% plus a spread of 2.50%. In particular, the Respondent argues that bidders had access to OSITRAN's opinion on the final version of the Concession Contract, which included an explanation of the State's understanding of the variables of the quarterly PAO formula.469 While recognizing that OSITRAN's opinion is not binding, the Respondent argues nonetheless that it was \"very relevant\" as it provided bidders with a direct means of understanding the State's reading and plans for the application of key economic terms of the Contract,470 and it was publicly available.471\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, para. 65, 66; **Exhibit R-57**, *Informe No. 057-13-GRE-GS-GAJ-OSITRAN*, OSITRAN's Technical Opinion Regarding the Final Version of the Contract, 27 December 2013, para. 108, 109.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, para. 68.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, para. 71.\n\n342.\n\nSecondly, the Respondent also explains that as a result of the *Contralor\u00eda*'s reports, the Contract could not be executed under the terms of Addendum No. 1, unless the Parties managed to reach an agreement to amend certain terms. According to the Respondent, the *Contralor\u00eda* had the authority to oversee the use of public funds in Peru and to review decisions of State entities to determine whether they would harm the Peruvian Treasury (under Law 27785).472 In this case, the *Contralor\u00eda* report found that the modifications to the Contract included in Addendum No. 1 violated Peruvian law given that they changed the competitive terms of the tender process and the financial structure of the Contract.473 For this reason, the *Contralor\u00eda* urged the MTC to reestablish the original economic balance of the Contract.474\n\nTranscript, Day 9 (English), 1944:2-6.\n\n**Exhibit RD-1**, Respondent's Opening Statement Presentation, slide 65.\n\nRespondent's Closing Statement Presentation, p. 58; Transcript, Day 9 (English), 1947:6-9.\n\n343.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, the decision to modify the financial structure and reallocate the financial risks of the Project, and to change the terms of the competition on which the bidders submitted their bid, were not ones as to which the MTC had discretion.475 Under Peruvian law, any amendment to the Concession Contract would have had to maintain the \"financial-economic balance\" (\"*equilibrio econ\u00f3mico financiero*\")and the \"the terms of the promotion process\" (\"*condiciones del proceso de promoci\u00f3n*\").476 Therefore, the *Contralor\u00eda*'s audit report was binding, and not following the *Contralor\u00eda*'s findings could have resulted in criminal, civil and administrative procedures against the Government officials involved in the acts that led to the *Contralor\u00eda*'s findings.477\n\nTranscript, Day 9 (English), 1944:13-17.\n\nTranscript, Day 9 (English), 1944:17-22. [Tribunal's translation]\n\nRespondent's Closing Statement Presentation, p. 59; Transcript, Day 9 (English), 1947:19-1948:1. The Respondent also points out that in its final report, the *Contralor\u00eda* concluded that it suspected criminal misconduct and recommended that the report be sent to the \"*\u00d3rgano Instructor Competente*\" and to the \"*Procuradoria*\" to initiate sanctioning and legal proceedings. (Transcript, Day 9 (English), 1948:6-12)\n\n344.\n\nAfter the *Contralor\u00eda*'s report, the Parties engaged in negotiations and agreed that, if they did not manage to agree on the amendment of certain terms, they would mutually terminate the Contract. On Respondent's case, by mid-2017, it became clear that the Parties could not reach any such agreement because Kuntur Wasi informed the Respondent that it would need six additional months to obtain financing under the newly negotiated terms.478 This led the Respondent to believe that Kuntur Wasi would never be able to build the Chinchero Airport, and left the MTC with no option but to unilaterally terminate the Concession Contract. On Respondent's view, had the MTC not terminated the Concession Contract, the Project would still be paralyzed.479\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, paras. 56, 57.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, paras. 205-208.\n\n345.\n\nIn response to the Claimants' argument that any discussion relating to Kuntur Wasi's financial proposal is irrelevant because of Addendum No. 1, the Respondent argues that this is a relevant fact because it provides context to the dispute in this arbitration. It shows, in Respondent's view, that Kuntur Wasi attempted to charge an excessive and unreasonable interest rate to the State and that it had financial issues from the very beginning of the Concession.480\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, para. 27.\n\n346.\n\nWith respect to Minister Vizcarra's statements before the Congress in relation to the Concession Contract and Addendum No. 1, the Respondent asserts that Minister Vizcarra was merely defending a policy position and his preferred policies from congressional attack; but that his statements do not represent a definitive interpretation of the Concession Contract or Peruvian law and should have no persuasive value for the Tribunal.481\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, para. 376.\n\n***(b)The MTC's communication of July 2017 was sufficiently motivated***\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n347.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, it is in this context that the MTC's communication of July 2017 must be read. The Respondent argues that the MTC's communication \"explained that Kuntur Wasi's inability to execute the Project under the terms granted in the Concession, jeopardized the fulfilment of the public interest of building the Airport\"482 and therefore, the MTC had no choice but to terminate the Contract to continue its pursuit of building the Airport.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, para. 190.\n\n348.\n\nIn response to the Claimants' argument that Peruvian law required the termination to be duly motivated, reasonable and proportional, the Respondent argues that this standard applies only to \"administrative acts,\" where the State uses its *ius imperium*. However, when a State enters into a concession contract such as the one at issue in this case, the State is acting as a commercial party and its acts are only assessed in accordance with the terms of the Contract itself. Therefore, the Tribunal does not need to determine whether the MTC's termination of the Contract was reasonable, proportional or duly justified in accordance with Peruvian law. On Respondent's case, the Claimants own actions evidence that they did not regard the MTC's termination of the Contract as an administrative act given that they never sought to challenge the termination before the entity that issued the act \u2013 *i.e.*, the normal recourse against administrative acts \u2013 but rather used the contractual resources available under the Contract.483\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, paras. 200-203; **Exhibit RER-2**, First Ferrando Gamarra Report, paras. 14, 85.\n\n349.\n\nFurthermore, according to the Respondent and its Peruvian law expert, Dr. Ferrando, Clause 15.5.1 of the Concession Contract does not require the State to provide \"individualized, justified and developed\" reasons for terminating the Contract.484 Rather, Dr. Ferrando explains that the requirement in Clause 15.5.1 for there to be \"well-founded\" (*debidamente fundadas*)public interest reasons means that such public reasons must exist and must have merit, but the MTC does not need to prove them at the moment it gives notice to the Concessionaire that it is terminating the Contract. The Respondent further argues that the Claimants were or should have been fully aware of this provision in the Contract, as it was included in the Concession Contract which Kuntur Wasi signed as part of its bid to win the Concession.485\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, para. 183.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, para. 184; **Exhibit RER-2**, First Ferrando Gamarra Report, paras. 15, 58, 136.\n\n350.\n\nDr. Ferrando further explains in his report that the concept of public interest has not been defined in Peruvian law or in the Contract, but it has been developed in Peruvian doctrine and jurisprudence. According to such doctrine and jurisprudence, to determine whether something is in the \"public interest,\" the State analyses the circumstances on a case-by-case basis and determines what will create a general benefit for its population. Importantly, Dr. Ferrando argues that it is up to the State alone to determine its own priorities and what is in the \"public interest.\"486\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, para. 186; **Exhibit RER-2**, First Ferrando Gamarra Report, paras. 16, 97-105.\n\n351.\n\nNevertheless, the Respondent argues that, even if the termination was considered an administrative act, it would have been reasonable, proportional and duly justified in light of the circumstances. In particular, in the Respondent's view, the following circumstances evidence that the termination was proportional and reasonable:\n\n352.\n\nBy mid-2017 Kuntur Wasi had proven a deficient partner to build and operate the Chinchero Airport. In particular, the Respondent refers to the fact that the Claimants first submitted a financial package that was unreasonable and caused an economic prejudice to the State. This paralyzed the Project and caused significant delays in the initiation of the construction of the Project.487\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, para. 205; Respondent's Rejoinder, paras. 23-27.\n\n353.\n\nThe Respondent also explains that as a result of the *Contralor\u00eda*'s reports, the Contract could not be executed under the terms of Addendum No. 1 unless the Parties managed to reach an agreement to amend certain terms. The Parties engaged in negotiations and agreed that, if they did not manage to agree on the amendment of certain terms, they would mutually terminate the Contract. On the Respondent's case, by mid-2017, it became clear that the Parties could not reach any such agreement because Kuntur Wasi informed the Respondent that it would need six additional months to obtain financing under the newly negotiated terms.488\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, paras. 205-208.\n\n***b. The Tribunal's Analysis***\n--------------------------------\n\n354.\n\nThe parties have discussed at length the requirements necessary for the Peruvian State to legitimately terminate the Concession Contract for reasons of public interest. Clause 15.5.1 regulates this ground for termination in the following terms:\n\n*For well-founded public interest reasons, the GRANTOR has the power to terminate the Concession Contract at any time, by prior written notice to the CONCESSIONAIRE at least six (6)months in advance of the term established for termination. The decision must be notified to the Allowed Creditors in the same term.489*\n\n**Exhibit C-4**, Concession Contract, Cl. 15.5.1. This is an English translation provided by the Respondent at para. 181 of its Counter-Memorial. The original Spanish reads: \"*Por razones de inter\u00e9s p\u00fablico debidamente fundadas, el CONCEDENTE tiene la facultad de resolver el Contrato de Concesi\u00f3n en cualquier momento, mediante notificaci\u00f3n previa y por escrito al CONCESIONARIO con una antelaci\u00f3n no inferior a seis (6)meses del plazo previsto para la terminaci\u00f3n. En igual plazo deber\u00e1 notificar tal decisi\u00f3n a los Acreedores Permitidos.*\"\n\n355.\n\nThe Claimants argue, on the basis of the clause cited above, that Peru was not entitled to terminate the Concession Contract at its sole discretion, but rather it was authorized to terminate such contract only upon \"well-founded public interest reasons.*\"* According to Kuntur Wasi, this means that it was possible to terminate the Contract provided that: (i)there was a public interest, (ii)the decision was grounded, and (iii)the decision was reasonable and proportionate.490\n\n*See* para. 289 *supra*.\n\n356.\n\nThe Respondent holds, instead, that the Peruvian Government is entitled to terminate the Concession Contract as long as (i)there is a reason of public interest and (ii)such reason actually exists.491\n\n*See* para. 349 *supra*.\n\n357.\n\nThe Peruvian Government argues that termination was an action required to attain the public interest, *i.e.,* building the Chinchero Airport, since, in light of various post-Contract award circumstances, Kuntur Wasi would have proven to be a deficient partner to complete such Project.492 Although the Claimants do not object to the fact that the prompt construction of the Chinchero Airport was indeed the public interest underlying the Project, the Claimants object that termination of the Concession Contract was the necessary means to meet such interest.493\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, paras. 187, 188, 204, 205.\n\nClaimants' Memorial, paras. 263, 265.\n\n358.\n\nThus, the Parties agree in that the legitimate termination of the Concession Contract, pursuant to Clause 15.5.1, implies at least the existence of a public interest that justifies the termination. It is clear to the Tribunal that, in addition to the existence of proper grounds for the decision, the appropriate time to execute the action and ultimately the reasonableness and proportionality of the measure, termination must be supported by an actual reason of *public interest*. Otherwise, termination would be groundless and as such would amount to a violation of the Concession Contract.\n\n359.\n\nThus, the Tribunal has to determine, above all, whether the Peruvian Government's decision to terminate the Concession Contract early was justified by adequate reasons of public interest. For the sake of order, the analysis of this matter will be structured upon the basis of the circumstances that, according to Peru, would prove that Kuntur Wasi was not suitable to carry out the Project, *i.e.,* precisely the reason of public interest claimed by the Respondent.494 Such circumstances are as follows: (i)Kuntur Wasi's inability to submit a reasonable financing proposal, (ii)invalidity of Addendum No. 1, and (iii)Kuntur Wasi's need for an additional six-month term to obtain financing.495\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, para. 204.\n\n*See* para. 336 *supra.*\n\n360.\n\nUpon an analysis of these facts, this section concludes, in subsection (iv), that the Respondent did not prove the circumstances under which Kuntur Wasi might be considered as a deficient contractor to carry out the Project. Therefore, the reasons of public interest asserted by Peru did not suffice to support the early termination of the Concession Contract as provided in Clause 15.5.1.\n\n**(i)Financing Proposal**\n-------------------------\n\n361.\n\nUnder the Concession Contract, Kuntur Wasi had the duty to submit to the Grantor, 30 days prior to the commencement of the Works, a proposal for the financing of the construction of the Project.496 Pursuant to the terms of the Contract, the financing mechanism was the so-called EGP. Upon authorization of the EGP submitted by Kuntur Wasi, the Financial Closing would be complied with (*supra*, para. 121).497\n\n**Exhibit C-4**, Concession Contract, Cl. 1.44 and 10.4.7.\n\n**Exhibit C-4**, Concession Contract, Cl. 1.23.\n\n362.\n\nKuntur Wasi submitted its first financing proposal to the MTC on 17 September 2015. This proposal was rejected by OSITRAN on 7 December 2015 for failure to present the required documents.498 In May 2016, Kuntur Wasi submitted a second financing proposal.499 After a series of comments and corrections, OSITRAN issued a favourable technical opinion in July 2016.500 However, the proposal was rejected by the MTC which considered that the proposal would cause financial damage to the Peruvian Government (*supra*, para. 152). The issue was then to properly determine the EGP in accordance with the Bidding Terms and the Concession Contract.\n\nThe request was made by Letter No. 246-2015-KW, dated 17 September 2015 (**Exhibit R-71**). This request was rejected by *Oficio No.134-15-GRE* dated 7 December 2015 (**Exhibit R-38**).\n\n**Exhibit C-20/C-194**, Letter No. 089-2016-KW, 4 May 2016.\n\n**Exhibit C-57**, *Oficio Circular No. 027-16-SCD-OSITRAN*, 7 June 2016; **Exhibit C-58**, Letter No. 119-2016-KW, 5 July 2016; **Exhibit R-64**, *Oficio* No. *088-16-GRE-OSITRAN*, 11 July 2016; **Exhibit R-65**, Letter No. 128-2016-KW, 14 July 2016; **Exhibit C-114**, *Informe No. 014-16-GRE-GAJ-OSITRAN*, 20 July 2016.\n\n363.\n\nThe background described above indicates that there was a regulatory vacuum in the Concession Contract which may have led to different interpretations by Kuntur Wasi and the Peruvian Government, particularly with regard to variable \"i\" used in the formula to calculate the total amount of the EGP.\n\n364.\n\nSuch uncertainty is also reflected by the fact that according to the *Contralor\u00eda*, the CAF, the expert Finnerty and the statements made by Minister Vizcarra at the time, the Concession Contract did not contain a clear definition of the \"i\" rate.501 This is particularly clear in the conclusion of the *Contralor\u00eda*'s report issued in connection with the request for approval of the EGP submitted by Kuntur Wasi:\n\n*The generality of the terms of the Contract, as it has been drafted and without any limits having been set in this respect, does not allow for an identification of the inputs applicable for calculation of the \"i\" Rate\u2026*502\n\n**Exhibit C-23**, *Reporte de Conclusiones y Recomendaciones*, CAF, 7 November 2016, p. 4: \"The Concession Contract does not define the annual weighted average rate of the Financial Closing applicable to the Works Execution Stage (hereinafter, \"Financing Average Rate\"), nor does said Contract provide for a procedure or formula to calculate such rate. This derives into a contractual vacuum subject to the interpretation of the parties.*\"* [Tribunal's translation] The original Spanish reads: \"*El Contrato de Concesi\u00f3n no define que es la tasa promedio ponderado anual del Cierre Financiero de la Etapa de Ejecuci\u00f3n de Obras (en adelante* \"*Tasa Promedio del Financiamiento\"), ni establece un procedimiento o f\u00f3rmula para calcularla. Esto genera un vac\u00edo contractual que est\u00e1 sujeto a la interpretaci\u00f3n de las partes.\"* Also in this respect, the First Finnerty Report explains the following: \"The interest rate \"i\" (\"Quarterly PAO Interest Rate\"), however, was not explicitly determined as part of the competitive bidding process that ultimately identified the Company that would be given the concession to build and operate the Chinchero Airport (the \"Concessionaire\"). [\u2026] The Quarterly PAO Interest Rate was to be determined as part of the financing proposal (the \"EGP Proposal\")that Kuntur Wasi would submit to the MTC for approval\" (**Exhibit RER-3**, First Finnerty Report, para. 19). Further in this regard, Minister Vizcarra stated that: \"As the Concession Contract does not stipulate a maximum rate to be used, Kuntur Wasi, endorsed by the contract of July 2014, had the possibility of using any rate for the Financial Closing.\" [Tribunal's translation] The original Spanish reads: \"*Dado que el Contrato de Concesi\u00f3n no establece el valor de una tasa m\u00e1xima a utilizar, Kuntur Wasi, con el aval del contrato suscrito en julio de 2014, ten\u00eda la posibilidad de presentar cualquier tasa para realizar el Cierre Financiero*.\" (Claimants' Reply, para. 270, citing to **Exhibit C-33**, *Respuestas al pliego interpelatorio de 83 preguntas formuladas por los Congresistas de la Rep\u00fablica en relaci\u00f3n al proyecto Aeropuerto Internacional de Chinchero \u2013 Cusco*, 18 May 2017, pp. 49 y 50. *See also* Claimants' Reply, paras. 20-22, 448 *et seq*.).\n\n**Exhibit C-22**, Oficio No. 4268-2016 MTC/25, 27 October 2016, p. 2 (p. 4 of the PDF). [Tribunal's translation] The original Spanish reads: \"*La generalidad del Contrato, tal como ha quedado redactado y sin haberse planteado l\u00edmites al 118royect, no permite identificar los supuestos aplicables para la estimaci\u00f3n de la Tasa 'i'*.\"\n\n365.\n\nThe records of the case show that the Peruvian Government had certain expectations about the value that the \"i\" rate would have. It can be assumed that the procedural bases were designed on the assumption that the EGP would be calculated using the average interest rates available in the market at the time of the bidding process.503\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, para. 65.\n\n366.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that these expectations of the Peruvian Government were not part of the bidding terms, and therefore cannot be considered binding on the Claimants. Indeed, Peru based the formula for calculating the financial package on ALG's Financial Economic Model. However, this model was confidential and was not disclosed to the participants in the bid (*supra*, para*.* 95).\n\n367.\n\nEven if some considerations of the ALG's Financial Economic Model were disclosed in OSITRAN's opinion on the Concession Contract,504 it follows from the MTC's conduct after the *Contralor\u00eda*'s report of October 2016 that the issue of variable \"i\" was not relevant to determine whether Kuntur Wasi was a deficient partner for the execution of the Project.\n\n**Exhibit R-35**, Publication of OSITRAN's Technical Opinion of the Final Version of the Contract, El Peruano, 7 January 2014.\n\n368.\n\nThe MTC rejected Kuntur Wasi's economic proposal as detrimental to the Peruvian State.505 Clause 10.4.7 of the Contract allowed the MTC to \"deny the request for authorization of the Permitted Guaranteed Indebtedness based on the economic prejudice that said terms could cause.\"506 The decision not to authorize the EGP proposal was reasoned and informed to Kuntur Wasi by an Official Notice of 25 November 2016.507\n\n**Exhibit C-67**, *Oficio No. 4601-2016-MTC*, 25 November 2016.\n\n[Tribunal's translation] The original Spanish reads: \"*\u2026negar la solicitud de autorizaci\u00f3n del Endeudamiento Garantizado Permitido bas\u00e1ndose en el perjuicio econ\u00f3mico que dichos t\u00e9rminos podr\u00edan ocasionarle.*\" In this regard, the Contract defines the EGP as \"the indebtedness main terms, including principal amounts, interest rate(s), amortization provisions, costs of issue, commissions, advance payment penalties, insurance, taxes, among others, [which] shall require the approval of the GRANTOR, subject to the prior opinion of OSITRAN. The GRANTOR may not deny approval without justifiable cause.\" [Tribunal's translation] The original Spanish reads: \"*los principales t\u00e9rminos del endeudamiento, incluyendo los montos del principal, la tasa o tasas de inter\u00e9s, disposiciones sobre amortizaci\u00f3n, gastos de proyecto, comisiones, penalidades por pago anticipado, seguros, impuestos, entre otros, requerir\u00e1n la aprobaci\u00f3n del CONCEDENTE, previa opini\u00f3n del OSITR\u00c1N. El CONCEDENTE no podr\u00e1 negar la aprobaci\u00f3n sin mediar causa justificada.*\" (**Exhibit C-4**, Concession Contract, Cl. 1.44). In other words, Peru reserved the right to reject the proposal, among other reasons, based on the financial terms of the offer. Clause 10.4.7 on the authorization of the EGP expressly provides such right.\n\n*Informe No. 1135-2016-MTC* of 25 November 2016 outlines the grounds for the unfavourable opinion issued by said authority with regard to the EGP request. Such report is attached as **Exhibit C-67**, *Oficio No. 4601-2016-MTC*, 25 November 2016, whereby the decision to reject the EGP proposal was informed.\n\n369.\n\nPeru was not only entitled to reject the proposal in the terms it did. The Contract also empowered Peru to declare early termination for the Concessionaire's failure to comply with its obligation of securing financing. Indeed, clause 15.3.2(m)authorized the Grantor to early terminate the Concession Contract due to \"[n]on-compliance with the Financial Closing for reasons attributable to the CONCESSIONAIRE, in accordance with the provisions of clause 9.\"508 Clause 9, in turn, states that \"[i]f the CONCESSIONAIRE has not evidenced the Financial Closing, such failure shall be considered a breach by the CONCESSIONAIRE and therefore the GRANTOR, after a report issued by OSITRAN, may terminate the Concession for breach by the CONCESSIONAIRE. In such event, the provisions of Clause 15.3 hereof shall apply.\"509\n\n[Tribunal's translation] The original Spanish reads: \"*\u2026 [i]ncumplimiento del Cierre Financiero por responsabilidad del CONCESIONARIO, de acuerdo a lo establecido en la cl\u00e1usula novena.*\"\n\n[Tribunal's translation] The original Spanish reads: \"*En caso que el CONCESIONARIO no haya acreditado el Cierre Financiero, se considerar\u00e1 un incumplimiento del CONCESIONARIO y por lo tanto el CONCEDENTE, previo informe emitido por el OSITRAN, podr\u00e1 optar por invocar la Caducidad de la Concesi\u00f3n por incumplimiento del CONCESIONARIO, siendo de aplicaci\u00f3n lo establecido en el Numeral 15.3 del presente Contrato.*\" **Exhibit C-4**, Concession Contract, Cl. 9.2.1. The clause refers to non-compliance with the Financial Closing, not to the non-approval of the EGP. Nonetheless, the Financial Closing (at least in this case)required EGP approval. This is so because under Clause 9.2.1, the Concessionaire had the duty to prove availability of third-party financing (i.e., EGP)or its own financing to perform the works. Kuntur Wasi had no financing of its own. As a result, it required EGP authorization.\n\n370.\n\nIn such event, Kuntur Wasi was entitled to object to the decision of the MTC asserting that the proposal had been accepted by OSITRAN, that it was in compliance with industry practice and that, therefore, there were no grounds for Peru to terminate the Contract.\n\n371.\n\nHowever, this discussion is purely hypothetical. In fact, the MTC neither used this remedy nor alleged a breach by Kuntur Wasi. Rather, the MTC decided to renegotiate the terms of the financial proposal submitted by the Claimants.\n\n372.\n\nThe Respondent itself explained the reasons for such decision. In its closing arguments, Peru held that, after the financing proposal made by Kuntur Wasi was rejected, \"(\u2026)the MTC would have been well within its rights to terminate the Contract because Kuntur Wasi had failed to achieve financial close pursuant to Clauses 9.2.1 and 15.3.2. [\u2026] The MTC, however, decided in good faith to try to work with Kuntur Wasi to move the Project forward because it was in the public interest to do so. The Parties, thus, negotiated Addendum 1...\"510\n\nTranscript, Day 9 (English)1943:5-13.\n\n373.\n\nIn the renegotiation process, the MTC proposed that Addendum No. 1 be executed, which completely disregarded the \"i\" variable. The new financing model radically amended the original scheme under the Concession Contract with regard to Sub-Stage 2 of works execution, replacing the system of guaranteed indebtedness and its components (PAO and FPAO)with a pay-as-you-work (PPO)mechanism similar to that of Sub-Stage 1 (*supra*, paras. 160-162).\n\n374.\n\nAddendum No. 1 proposed by the MTC was accepted by Kuntur Wasi and subscribed by the competent Peruvian authorities (*supra,* paras. 164-171).\n\n375.\n\nThus, the Tribunal agrees with the Claimants in that execution of Addendum No. 1 made irrelevant the discussion over the initial proposal made by Kuntur Wasi with regard to financing.511 Indeed, even if there were reasons to believe that Kuntur Wasi's original proposal was inconsistent with industry practice, the MTC decided to renegotiate the Contract and execute Addendum No. 1, although it was entitled to terminate the Concession Contract for Kuntur Wasi's failure to obtain the Financial Closing.\n\nClaimants' Reply, Section II.L\n\n376.\n\nIn view of the findings by the *Contralor\u00eda* and the CAF, it is significant that the MTC made such a decision.512 Having identified the Concession Contract's ambiguity as to the \"i\" variable, both entities suggested that Peru renegotiate the quarterly PAO to achieve better results. None of said entities interpreted Kuntur Wasi's actions as an abuse of the bidding terms proposed by the State.\n\n*See* para. 169 *supra*.\n\n377.\n\nTo conclude, the ambiguity in the Concession Contract resulted in irreconcilable differences to achieve the Financial Closing. Once the problem was identified, the Parties agreed to remedy the situation by amending the financing structure. Thus, the discussion as to the financing mechanism applicable to the Project pursuant to the original contractual framework was terminated upon execution of Addendum No. 1. Therefore, the opinion of the Tribunal is that such a discussion does not have any relevance for the purpose of assessing the causes that led Peru to the unilateral and early termination of the Concession Contract.\n\n**(ii)Validity of Addendum No. 1**\n----------------------------------\n\n378.\n\nThe Tribunal will analyze next if the alleged unlawfulness of Addendum No. 1 is relevant to assess the merits of the reasons upon which early termination of the Concession Contract was based. As indicated above, Peru submits that the objections made by the *Contralor\u00eda* to Addendum No. 1 rendered *impossible* the execution of the agreement that had been reached, which made the Parties to attempt a new renegotiation.513\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, paras. 118, 205. Claimants' Reply, paras. 399 *et seq.*\n\n379.\n\nAbove all, the Tribunal considers it implausible that the *Contralor\u00eda* would have the authority to order the termination of the Concession Contract.514 It was possible to terminate the Contract upon the occurrence of any of the causes set forth in Clause 15. However, an order by the *Contralor\u00eda* was not one of said causes. In any case, the *Contralor\u00eda* did not order or recommend such action to the MTC.\n\nClaimants make this affirmation in their Reply (Claimants' Reply, para. 403).\n\n380.\n\nThe *Contralor\u00eda* issued a formal opinion regarding Addendum No. 1 in Audit Report No. 265-2017. There are two conclusions in this report: (1)Addendum No. 1 was subscribed within the first three years of the Concession Contract, without authorization of the Authorized Third-Party Lenders; and (2)Addendum No.1 changed the competitive terms defined in the bidding process, thus distorting the economic-financial balance of the Concession Contract. Both conclusions implied, according to the *Contralor\u00eda*, a breach of Law Decree No. 1224, which regulates *Asociaciones P\u00fablico Privadas* (*Public and Private Partnerships*, \"**PPP Law**\").515 Based on these conclusions, the *Contralor\u00eda* recommended to the MTC as follows:\n\n*6. To take actions to re-establish the competitive conditions set forth in the bidding terms followed by all bidders and under which the Concessionaire submitted the successful proposal, as well as the technical, legal and economic conditions considered in the proposal of the successful bidder and the Contract executed, to such end, the Law, the bidding terms and conditions, the contract, the directives, guidelines and guides applicable to the execution of the contract shall be taken into account, in order to safeguard the interests of the State.*\n\n*7. To elaborate a procedure that allows for the registration of the agenda for the joint evaluation required by the provision, as well as the documents analyzed.*\n\n*8. In order to achieve the financial closing within the shortest term possible, to arrange such actions as are required for the Concessionaire to formally present the Permitted Creditor and submit the financing proposal, arranging at the same that the assessment of the received proposals allows to obtain the best financial terms possible in the interest of the State, maintaining the financial-economic balance.*516\n\n**Exhibit C-30**, Audit Report No. 265-2017-CG/IMPROY-AC, 19 May 2017, p. 54.\n\n**Exhibit C-30**, Audit Report No. 265-2017-CG/IMPROY-AC, 19 May 2017, p. 55. [Tribunal's translation] The original Spanish reads: \"*6.

The Tribunal considers that the allegations of unlawfulness asserted by the *Contralor\u00eda* are arguable and, in any case, were not mandatory for the MTC.\n\n383.\n\nAs indicated above, the Audit Report raised two objections to Addendum No. 1. The first objection referred to the possibility of executing an Addendum within the first three years of the Concession Contract without authorization by an Authorized Third-Party Lender.\n\n384.\n\nIn this respect, the Tribunal considers that the explanation provided by expert witness Mar\u00eda Teresa Qui\u00f1ones is convincing. The Concession Contract had a vacuum that made it impossible to achieve the Financial Closing to the satisfaction of both Parties. Thus, Kuntur Wasi requested to formalize a new agreement with an Addendum subscribed pursuant to the terms of the Regulatory Provisions of Decree Law 1224, Article 54 (b), which governs Public-Private Partnerships. This provision states that \"During the first three (03)years as from the date of execution of the contract, no Addenda to the Public Private Partnership contracts may be subscribed, except in the case of: b)The substantiated requirements of the auhtorized third-party lenders, associated with the financial closing stage of the contract.\"517\n\n[Tribunal's translation] The original Spanish reads: \"*Durante los tres (03)primeros a\u00f1os contados desde la fecha de suscripci\u00f3n del contrato, no pueden suscribirse Adendas a los contratos de Asociaci\u00f3n P\u00fablico Privada, salvo que se trate de: b)Los requerimientos sustentados de los acreedores permitidos, vinculados a la etapa de cierre financiero del contrato.*\"\n\n385.\n\nThe *Contralor\u00eda* held that an Addendum based on such legal ground was not possible at the time, as there was no Authorized Third-Party Lender to make a valid request for amendment.518 However, under such interpretation it was not possible to apply the provision.\n\nAccording to the definition set forth by the Concession Contract, the \"Authorized Third-Party Lenders require authorization by the GRANTOR to prove such condition, provided they submit Annex 14 to the GRANTOR in advance for approval.\" [Tribunal's translation] The original Spanish reads: \"*Acreedores Permitidos deber\u00e1n contar con la autorizaci\u00f3n del CONCEDENTE para acreditar tal condici\u00f3n, cumpliendo con presentar previamente el Anexo 14 ante el CONCEDENTE para su aprobaci\u00f3n.*\" (Clause 1.1 of the Concession Contract).\n\n386.\n\nFor a lender to be deemed an Authorized Third-Party Lender under the terms of the Concession Contract, a formal undertaking was required by such lender to provide financing to the Concessionaire via the execution of Annex 14. However, no lender would undertake such a commitment if the terms of the EGP were not previously approved by the Grantor. Approval of the EGP, in turn, did not seem feasible unless the Concession Contract was amended, as explained above.519\n\nAs Ms. Qui\u00f1ones stated, the Contralor\u00eda's interpretation led to the chicken or egg dilemma: \"the financial closing was a prior requirement to petition a bankability Addendum that would allow for the financial closing.\" (**Exhibit CER-6**, Qui\u00f1ones Alayza Report, para. 152). [Tribunal's translation] The original Spanish reads: \"*se necesitaba alcanzar el cierre financiero como requisito previo para solicitar una Adenda de bancabilidad que permitiese alcanzar el cierre financiero.\"*\n\n387.\n\nThe purpose of the provision is precisely to authorize an amendment of the Contract in the event any errors or omissions\u2014such as the uncertainty as to the indebtedness rate\u2014make the financial closing of the Project impossible.520 In this regard, it is reasonable to apply general interpretation criteria that sustain a practical application of the provision over formal criteria that would render it ineffective.\n\n**Exhibit CER-6**, Qui\u00f1ones Alayza Report, para. 142.\n\n388.\n\nThe second objection raised by the *Contralor\u00eda* to Addendum No. 1 makes sense from the point of view of the State interest involved in a public tender. Indeed, under a tender process, the winning bidder is selected because of a superior proposal in the context of competitive bidding. If after the tender is awarded, its inherent terms are changed, the non-selected bidders are prejudiced because they were discarded to the benefit of a proposal which, ultimately, was amended.521 The State, in turn, loses the opportunity to partner with a possibly more appropriate bidder. In this respect, the execution of Addendum No. 1 would affect the very nature of the purpose of the bidding process.\n\n**Exhibit CER-6**, Qui\u00f1ones Alayza Report, para. 158.\n\n389.\n\nHowever, re-establishing the original bidding conditions would imply reopening the debate on how to determine the \"i\" component of the formula for the Quarterly PAO. Aware of this, the *Contralor\u00eda* suggested restoring the competitive conditions by *\"*arranging at the same time that the assessment of the received proposals allows to obtain the best financial terms possible in the interest of the State, maintaining the financial-economic balance*.\"*522\n\n**Exhibit C-30**, Audit Report No. 265-2017-CG/IMPROY-AC, 19 May 2017, p. 56. [Tribunal's translation] The original Spanish reads: \"*disponiendo a su vez que la evaluaci\u00f3n de las propuestas recibidas permita obtener las mejores condiciones econ\u00f3micas para los intereses del Estado, manteniendo el equilibrio econ\u00f3mico financiero.\"*\n\n390.\n\nIn other words, the *Contralor\u00eda* recommended returning to the original financing scheme, but this time, negotiating the value of the indebtedness rate that would be returned to the Concessionaire to maintain the Contract's economic and financial balance. Certainly, Kuntur Wasi's offer in the bidding process did not include a limit to the \"i\" component, nor a negotiation process for determining such value. No evidence has been submitted in this case as to whether other bidders included these in their proposals.\n\n391.\n\nThus, even if the *Contralor\u00eda*'s recommendation did not imply terminating or amending the awarded Concession Contract, it certainly altered the terms upon which the bidders made their offers, particularly as regards the \"i\" component. It was then an impracticable recommendation, which failed to adequately solve the ambiguity of the Concession Contract. This ambiguity put the Parties in the position of needing to reach a new agreement not prescribed under the original terms.\n\n392.\n\nIn the same vein, the Tribunal has not found sufficient evidence to find that the recommendations made by the *Contralor\u00eda* were binding.\n\n393.\n\nBoth Parties admitted that the MTC was entitled to some degree of discretion to amend the Concession Contract. According to the Organic Law for the National Control System and the General Comptroller's Office of the Republic, government officials may have *some degree of discretion* provided, when they are expressly authorized by the law in force. In these cases, the *Contralor\u00eda* cannot challenge the decisions of the MTC for the mere fact of having a different opinion.523\n\n**Exhibit CL-262**, Law No. 29622 amending Law No. 27785, Fourth Supplementary Final Provision: \"When the law in force expressly gives government officials some degree of discretion to make certain decisions, the agencies of the National Control System cannot challenge the exercise of such discretionary power for the mere fact of having a different opinion. Those decisions may only be challenged if they were taken without adequate consideration of the facts or risks at the appropriate time, or based upon the results obtained in view of the purposes and goals set, or, in such cases where the law allows for several interpretations; the decision deviates from the Interpretation adopted by the guiding agency competent on the matter.\" [Tribunal's translation] The original Spanish reads: \"*En los casos en que la legislaci\u00f3n vigente autorice a los funcionarios expresamente alg\u00fan grado de discrecionalidad para determinada toma de decisi\u00f3n, los \u00f3rganos del Sistema Nacional de Control no pueden cuestionar su ejercicio por el solo hecho de tener una opini\u00f3n distinta. Tales decisiones solo pueden observarse si fueron tomadas sin una consideraci\u00f3n adecuada de los hechos o riesgos en el momento oportuno. O por los resultados logrados seg\u00fan los objetivos y metas planteados, o cuando, en los casos que la normativa permita varias interpretaciones; la decisi\u00f3n se aparte de la Interpretaci\u00f3n adoptada por el \u00f3rgano rector competente en la materia*.\"\n\n394.\n\nHowever, the Parties disagree on the degree of discretion that such provision grants. The Claimants argue that the MTC acted within the discretionary powers granted by the PPP Law to approve, conduct, execute, supervise and audit the private investment promotion processes.524 In this regard, the recommendations made in the report merely reflected the *Contralor\u00eda's* a non-binding opinion.525 Meanwhile, Peru asserts that, notwithstanding the MTC's and MEF's discretionary powers, the *Contralor\u00eda* is at all times authorized to supervise the correct use of public funds in Peru*.*526 Upon the amendment of the financial- economic structure of the Concession Contract, the decisions of the MTC would be susceptible of review by the *Contralor\u00eda*.527\n\nClaimants' Reply, para. 405 citing **Exhibit CL-9**, Legislative Decree governing the framework for private investment promotion through Public-Private Partnerships and projects in assets approved by Legislative Decree No. 1224 of 24 September 2015, Sixth Supplementary Final Provision.\n\nClaimants' Reply, paras. 406, 407.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, paras. 111, 112.\n\nThis was explained by Peru at the closing arguments: \"In other words, while the MTC may decide to amend the contract, it does not have the discretion to change the economic balance of the Concession and its economic equilibrium. Because the Contralor\u00eda has the authority to oversee the use of public funds, it did have the power to review the Addendum and to ensure that any changes made to the Contract did not adversely affect the economic equilibrium of the Contract and did not cause harm to the Peruvian Treasury.\" Transcript, Day 9 (English), 1945:1-10.\n\n395.\n\nThe Tribunal also notes that Peru raised this interpretation for the first time in this arbitration. At the time the dispute arose, an MTC senior official declared before the Peruvian Congress528 and on broadcast television that it disagreed with the *Contralor\u00eda*'s position.529 Meanwhile, the MEF issued a public statement affirming the discretionary power of the officials involved in the execution of the Project.530 Peru even requested an independent study that could corroborate the *Contralor\u00eda*'s conclusions. However, this report concluded that, on the contrary, the execution of Addendum No. 1 was beneficial to the Peruvian State.531\n\n**Exhibit C-33**, *Respuestas al pliego interpelatorio de 83 preguntas formuladas por los Congresistas de la Rep\u00fablica en relaci\u00f3n al proyecto Aeropuerto Internacional de Chinchero \u2013 Cusco*, 18 May 2017, Response to Question No. 1, p. 12.\n\n**Exhibit C-120**, News clip from Buenos D\u00edas Per\u00fa, \"Vizcarra sobre Chinchero: Decidimos dejar sin efecto contrato que desde el inicio parti\u00f3 mal,\" 22 May 2017, minute 1:04-1:16.\n\n**Exhibit C-78**, \"Comunicado en relaci\u00f3n a observaciones realizadas por la Contralor\u00eda,\" 22 May 2017, MEF.\n\n**Exhibit C-246**, *An\u00e1lisis del Informe N\u00b0265-2017-CG/MPROY \u2014 AC, de la Contralor\u00eda General De La Rep\u00fablica,* Jorge Alejandro Le\u00f3n Ball\u00e9n, September 2017, conclusion 5.1.3.\n\n396.\n\nEven during the arbitration, Mr. Bruno Giuffra, the Respondent's witness, argued that the Audit Report was not binding:\n\n*Mr Giuffra: (...)From the outset, I tried to look for a way out, regardless of the Comptroller's proposals. Perhaps, we could find an option D accepted by the Comptroller's Office.*\n\n*Mr Bullard: You didn't consider the Comptroller's Office's Report as binding.*\n\n*Mr Giuffra: It is known that it is not a binding Report.532*\n\nTranscript, Day 5 (English), 1016:19-1017:3.\n\n397.\n\nIn view of the considerations above, the Tribunal finds Peru's position unconvincing. While there is a legality argument in favour of the binding nature of the *Contralor\u00eda*'s conclusions, the evidence shows that all Peruvian officials acted\u2014both before and after execution of Addendum No. 1\u2014with the conviction that such conclusions were not binding upon the MTC, but simply a recommended course of action.\n\n398.\n\nAccordingly, the Tribunal does not find sufficient grounds to demonstrate the unlawfulness of Addendum No. 1, nor that the recommendations based on the *Contralor\u00eda*'s objections were binding. Furthermore, the administrative law experts of both Parties agreed that, at the time of the early termination of the Contract, Addendum No. 1 was valid and in force.\n\n399.\n\nMar\u00eda Teresa Qui\u00f1ones, on behalf of the Claimants, dedicated an entire section of her legal report to justify the validity of Addendum No. 1,533 and when the Tribunal asked her whether it was in force at the time of the termination of the Concession Contract, she stated: \"the text which was in force existed in the Contract which was modified by Addenda 1. That was the text in force.\"534\n\n**Exhibit CER-6**, Qui\u00f1ones Alayza Report, chapter IV, Section A on the \"Analysis of the reports issued by *Contralor\u00eda,*\" paras. 137-165.\n\nTranscript, Day 9 (English), 1793:2-4.\n\n400.\n\nIn turn, the Respondent's expert Enrique Ferrando, when asked the same question, stated that he agreed with Dr. Qui\u00f1ones and added that \"the Contract had been modified by Addenda 1, and that was a contractual relationship without prejudice that it was being questioned for reasons of nullity, but it was in force.\"535\n\nTranscript, Day 9 (English), 1793:5-9.\n\n401.\n\nWhile the Tribunal does not doubt that the *Contralor\u00eda* had raised issues about when and how Addendum No. 1 was subscribed, it is clear that the report issued by such authority did not provide for the Addendum's termination or invalidity. Neither did the MTC or the MEF, nor is there any evidence in the file to conclude that the Addendum was no longer effective by operation of the law. In short, Addendum No. 1 was still in force at the time of the termination and provided for a specific mechanism to finance and execute the Project.\n\n402.\n\nIn conclusion, the Concession Contract as amended by Addendum No. 1 was the contractual framework in force at the time of termination by Peru. The recommendations made by the *Contralor\u00eda* did not bind the MTC, nor did they imply the termination of the Contract. While it is reasonable for the MTC to be interested in adapting the Project to the supervising agency's position, Addendum No. 1 could be executed, as it was still in force, without amendments. Indeed, the Roadmap (\"*Hoja de Ruta*\")did not alter the force of Addendum No. 1, but simply invited the Parties to negotiate in good faith a new financing scheme. Under such terms, the *Contralor\u00eda*'s disagreement with Addendum No. 1 does not amount to an adequate ground to justify the termination of the Concession Contract for reasons of public interest. In the same vein, it cannot be inferred from the objections raised against Addendum No. 1 that Kuntur Wasi had been a deficient concessionaire for the execution of the Project or that the feasibility of the Project had been affected by deficiencies attributable to the Claimants.\n\n**(iii)Additional term for Project financing**\n----------------------------------------------\n\n403.\n\nThe third circumstance that, in Peru's opinion, motivated the termination of the Concession Contract was Kuntur Wasi's request, made in the final negotiations between the Parties, for six additional months to obtain financing. The analysis of this motive requires a review of the events that preceded Kuntur Wasi's alleged request.\n\n404.\n\nThe execution of Addendum No. 1 implied two relevant changes in the financial structure of the Project: (1)the substitution of the PAO system applicable to Sub-Stage 2, with a PPO system; thus, both the execution of works under Sub-Stage 1 and Sub-Stage 2 would be financed by Peru, according to the progress of the work and the approval by OSITRAN; (2)Peru would deliver an advance payment amounting to USD 40 million to finance the execution of the works under Sub-Stage 2, which would be reimbursed by Kuntur Wasi through discounts in the PPOs.\n\n405.\n\nOn 22 February 2017, the *Contralor\u00eda* issued a preliminary report regarding Addendum No.1, warning of risks that Kuntur Wasi might use the Advance Payment for purposes other than those agreed upon by the Parties.536 On 27 February 2017, the MTC sent a letter to Kuntur Wasi requesting the suspension of the Concession Contract.537 A few days later, the Parties suspended their obligations under the Contract.538 In May 2017, the *Contralor\u00eda* issued Audit Report 265-2017 with a final opinion on Addendum No. 1.539 As discussed in the preceding section, the *Contralor\u00eda* raised certain potential legal issues and risks in relation to Addendum No. 1 and recommended that the original financing structure be re-established, with the adjustments already mentioned.\n\n**Exhibit C-29**, *Oficio No. 00331-2017-CG/DC*, 22 February 2017, p. 1.\n\n**Exhibit R-75**, *Oficio No. 0813-2017-MTC/25*, 27 February 2017.\n\n**Exhibit C-31**, *Acta de acuerdo de Suspensi\u00f3n Temporal de Obligaciones Contractuales*, 2 March 2017.\n\n**Exhibit C-30**, Audit Report No. 265-2017-CG/IMPROY-AC, 19 May 2017.\n\n406.\n\nDespite these recommendations, the MTC decided to follow an alternative path. Following Minister Vizcarra's resignation, the new Minister proposed to Kuntur Wasi that they find a new solution acceptable to the *Contralor\u00eda*.540 In this context, the Parties decided to extend the suspension of their obligations and discussed potential alternatives. The detail of these conversations is unknown to the Tribunal. The only written record is a document signed on 1 June 2017 by Minister Giuffra and Mr. Vargas (the Roadmap)(\"*Hoja de Ruta*)(*supra*, paras. 185, 186).\n\nTranscript Day 5 (Spanish), 1175:4-16. *See* **Exhibit C-79**, *Oficio No. 2118-2017-MTC/25*, 24 May 2017.\n\n407.\n\nThe Roadmap outlines two alternatives: \"1. Comprehensive renegotiation; or 2. Mutual termination in case the first [alternative] does not work.\" Regarding the renegotiation, the document lists the points that would be included in an eventual new addendum. Among the points relevant to the discussion, the Parties agreed that: there would be no Advance Payment or interest payment, the term of the Concession would be reduced to 25 years and PPO would be maintained as the financing mechanism for the execution of the works under Sub-Stage 2.541\n\n**Exhibit R-16**, Letter from Minister Giuffra to Kuntur Wasi, 1 June 2017.\n\n408.\n\nAccording to Peru, a few days after subscribing to this document, Kuntur Wasi reportedly asked Minister Giuffra for an additional six months to secure financing under the terms of the Roadmap. The Parties have discussed at length the occurrence of this conversation and its relevance to Peru's subsequent termination of the Concession.\n\n409.\n\nPeru argues that, after three years of trying to achieve Financial Closing, this request evidenced Kuntur Wasi's inability to execute the Project promptly or even at all.542 Kuntur Wasi contends, instead, that there is no record to prove that this conversation occurred. In any event, if it did occur, it was a reasonable request considering the changes that the Roadmap implied in the financial structure of the Contract.543\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, para. 121, 122.\n\nClaimants' Closing Statement, Transcript, Day 9 (Spanish), 2126:4-2128:6.\n\n410.\n\nThe Tribunal considers it unnecessary to rule on the actuality of this conversation for the purposes of assessing Peru's grounds for terminating the Concession Contract. Assuming that Kuntur Wasi's request did occur, the Tribunal finds that, contrary to Peru's allegation, it was not indicative of the Concessionaire's lack of financial capacity to carry out the Project.\n\n411.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, the facts and circumstances seem to indicate that the six-month term proposed by Kuntur Wasi was reasonable, considering the size of the Project and the changes proposed by the Parties in the Roadmap that deviated from Addendum 1.\n\n412.\n\nThe terms of the Roadmap differed substantially from the terms of Addendum No. 1, which was the agreement in force at that time. In particular, the Roadmap contemplated a financing scheme to be followed by the concessionaire *with no advance payment or interest* payments. This suggests that under the new scheme it would be more difficult to secure financing than under the mechanism contemplated in the previous agreements or at least in Addendum No.1.\n\n413.\n\nIndeed, the Concession Contract originally contemplated a PAO payment system that would allow Kuntur Wasi to recover the amounts invested for the execution of the works under Sub-Stage 2, plus interest associated with the financing and an additional profit (spread)of at least 2.5%. Under this structure, Kuntur Wasi conducted a competitive process that lasted approximately seven months to select Goldman Sachs as the potential lender for the Project.544\n\n**Exhibit CWS-1**, First Jos\u00e9 Balta Statement, paras. 18, 19.\n\n414.\n\nAddendum No.1 simplified the financial structure of the Contract, as it made Peru responsible for the payment of the work based on progress and included an Advance Payment of USD 40 million. Thus, Kuntur Wasi would no longer have the duty to obtain financing for the works under Sub-Phase 2 and would be in charge of the operation of the Chinchero Airport for 40 years.\n\n415.\n\nThe renegotiation proposal provided for new changes in the financing method applicable to the Concession Contract. Although the Sub-Phase 2 works would still be financed by Peru through a PPO system, under this agreement there would be no Advance Payment, and the term of the Concession would be reduced from 40 to 25 years. Undoubtedly, these were significant changes that would affect the preliminary commitment made by any lender. In this regard, expert Finnerty stated that a material change in the financing structure would require obtaining the lenders' commitment again:\n\n*PRESIDENT LOW: So, all you're really saying is that if there's a material change you may have to go back to the drawing board with the lenders; is that correct?*\n\n*[Mr FINNERTY]: That's correct. If there's a material change and, as a result, one of lenders now refuses to sign the commitment letter, then you've got to make some changes to the Project or find a substitute, and then go back to the MTC\u2026*545\n\nTranscript, Day 4 (English), 837:1-9.\n\n416.\n\nGiven that (i)the lender selection process under the original scheme took approximately seven months, (ii)the Parties were considering substantial amendments to the Concession Contract, reducing the term of the Concession to almost half of the original period, and (iii)Peru's financial expert confirmed that a substantial change in the Project would require renewing the loan commitments, the Tribunal finds that Kuntur Wasi's request for a six-month period to obtain financing under the new scheme being negotiated was reasonable.\n\n417.\n\nThe Tribunal also dismisses the allegation that such request evidenced that Kuntur Wasi was unable or unfit to carry out the Project.\n\n418.\n\nMr. Giuffra stated that the excessive request for time to raise funds \"was a clear sign that it was not prepared to proceed with the Project and did not have the necessary financing to do so. Mr. Vargas' statement led me to deeply doubt about Kuntur Wasi's ability to commit to carrying out and actually completing the Project.\"546\n\n**Exhibit RWS-1**, First Giuffra Statement, para. 11. [Tribunal's translation] The original Spanish reads: \"*era una clara se\u00f1al de que no estaba preparado para seguir Adelante con el Proyecto y no dispon\u00eda del financiamiento necesario para hacerlo. La afirmaci\u00f3n del Sr. Vargas me hizo dudar seriamente de la habilidad de Kuntur Wasi para comprometerse a llevar a cabo el Proyecto y culminarlo.*\"\n\n419.\n\nAside from Mr. Giuffra's statements, there is no record evidencing an objective inability of Kuntur Wasi to honour its commitments. Professor Finnerty argued, in the third question of his legal report, that Kuntur Wasi relied on a third party for financing, and that in any event third party financing would require prior agreement between the Parties on the terms of the Concession Contract.547\n\n**Exhibit RER-3**, First Finnerty Report, para. 56-59.\n\n420.\n\nNone of the above considerations is indicative of an inability to carry out the Project. While Kuntur Wasi did not have the resources to finance the Project on its own, expert Finnerty stated in these proceedings that Corporaci\u00f3n Am\u00e9rica's and Andino's financial support made it feasible for it to do so.548 On the other hand, the need for a prior agreement between the Parties shows that Kuntur Wasi was not required to have immediate financing, as the terms of the Project were under a renegotiation process.\n\nTranscript, Day 4 (English), 838:21-839:3.\n\n421.\n\nMoreover, if Peru considered the six-month term to be excessive, it would have been reasonable for it to seek to negotiate a shorter term with Kuntur Wasi. It is worth noting that the Parties had agreed to attempt a *comprehensive renegotiation* of the Concession Contract, which would certainly involve resolving issues such as the matter supposedly raised by Kuntur Wasi. In view of these considerations, it does not seem justified for Peru to immediately adopt the decision not to continue with the Concession Contract solely based upon a request by Kuntur Wasi for an additional period of time to secure financing based on revised terms of the Concession.\n\n422.\n\nIn conclusion, Kuntur Wasi's alleged request for a six-month period to secure financing under the Roadmap structure was reasonable and appropriate to the Project's status. Also, it is not evidence of Kuntur Wasi's alleged financial inability to carry out the Project. Consequently, the reason invoked by Peru cannot justify the early termination of the Concession Contract.\n\n**(iv)Inexistence of a public interest justifying the termination of the Concession Contract**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n423.\n\nThe analysis of the case records shows that there were no objective reasons to conclude that Kuntur Wasi was a deficient contractor for the execution of the Project. Indeed, the submission of a financing proposal that in Peru's opinion was unacceptable is explained by the ambiguity in the Concession Contract. The decision to suscribe to Addendum No. 1 was joint and informed. The subsequent objections raised by the *Contralor\u00eda* did not make it impossible to execute such Addendum and, in any case, were not attributable to Kuntur Wasi. There are no reasons either to disapprove Kuntur Wasi's behavior in the negotiations following the objections raised by the *Contralor\u00eda*. The alleged request for a six-month period to obtain financing under the new contractual framework provided for in the Roadmap was reasonable and does not evidence a technical inability to carry out the Project.\n\n424.\n\nAs explained above, for the Concession Contract to be terminated for *well-founded reasons of public interest*, required, at least, the existence of one reason to justify the termination. Dr Ferrando elaborated on this point as follows:\n\n*In fact, the expression \"well-founded\" refers to the existence of a causal link between the termination and the public interest intended to be protected via the termination. That is to say, that the reason for the unilateral termination must actually be the reason alleged; there must be coherence so that the ground supporting the \"public interest\" shall not be arbitrary or alien to the reason for termination. Well-founded is not grounded, explained, motivated or developed.*549\n\n**Exhibit RER-2**, First Ferrando Gamarra Report, para. 136. [Tribunal's translation] The original Spanish reads: \"*En realidad, la expresi\u00f3n \"debidamente fundado\" est\u00e1 referido a la existencia de un nexo de causalidad entre la resoluci\u00f3n y el inter\u00e9s p\u00fablico que se busca proteger con la resoluci\u00f3n. Es decir que sea cierto, que sea verdad que la raz\u00f3n de la resoluci\u00f3n unilateral fue la que se argumenta, que exista una congruencia, de modo tal que el sustento del \"inter\u00e9s p\u00fablico\" no sea arbitrario o ajeno a la raz\u00f3n de la resoluci\u00f3n. Debidamente fundado no es fundamentado, explicado, motivado o desarrollado*.\"\n\n425.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that the reason of public interest invoked by Peru to terminate the Concession Contract does not meet this standard. There is not sufficient evidence to prove that Kuntur Wasi was a deficient partner for the execution of the Project; so, such circumstance was not a legitimate cause for the MTC's decision.\n\n426.\n\nIn view of this conclusion, it is unnecessary to rule on the discussion between the Parties' legal experts as to whether it was necessary to provide the reasons for such decision and the moment when such reasons should be given. The question is not whether Peru sufficiently justified its decision, but whether its decision was based on any reason to justify the early termination of the Concession Contract. The Tribunal considers it was not.\n\n427.\n\nBased on the analysis above, the Arbitral Tribunal finds that Peru breached the Concession Contract by terminating it without a well-founded reason of public interest.\n\n**(2)Peru acted in bad faith and its conduct was inconsistent with the promises and commitments made to the Claimants**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n***a. The Parties' Positions***\n-------------------------------\n\n**(i)The Claimants' Position**\n------------------------------\n\n428.\n\nThe Claimants' second claim is that Peru acted in bad faith and in a manner inconsistent with the promises and commitments it made to the Claimants when it terminated the Concession Contract.\n\n429.\n\nTo support their claim, the Claimants rely on Article 1362 of the Peruvian Civil Code, which establishes that contracts must be negotiated, entered into and performed in good faith. Under Peruvian law, the principle of good faith encompasses several standards that a diligent businessperson is required to observe in his or her dealings, including: the duty to act in a coherent manner, the duty to act with transparency, and the prohibition on acting in a manner that is contradictory with previous actions (*doctrina de actos propios*).550\n\nClaimants' Memorial, paras. 304-306, citing, amomg others: **Exhibit CL-17**, S*ala Civil Permanente de la Corte Suprema de la Rep\u00fablica*, Cassation No. 88-2014, Lima Sur, 2 March 2015, p. 1; **Exhibit CL-18**, *Sala Civil Transitoria de la Corte Suprema*, Cassation No. 1322-2006, Puno, 6 November 2006, pp. 12, 13.\n\n430.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, it is well settled under Peruvian law that public entities are also bound to act in good faith and hence, are bound by the doctrine of *actos propios*, which prevents them from acting in a manner inconsistent with their previous actions.551 In particular, the Claimants rely on Article 1.8 of the *Ley de Procedimiento Administrativo General*, which establishes that public authorities must act in good faith and cannot go against their own actions, and Article 1.15 of the same law, which requires that public entities act in a manner consistent with individuals' legitimate expectations. According to the Claimants, to prove that there has been a breach of the *actos propios* doctrine, three conditions must be met: (i)there must be a binding conduct that creates a legitimate expectation; (ii)there must be a contradictory conduct; and (iii)there must be identity of the parties in elements (i)and (ii).552\n\nClaimants' Memorial, paras. 308, 309; **Exhibit CL-21**, Mor\u00f3n Urbina, Juan Carlos, *COMENTARIOS A LA LEY DEL PROCEDIMIENTO ADMINISTRATIVO GENERAL, TEXTO \u00daNICO ORDENADO DE LA LEY NO. 27444,* 12\u00aa edici\u00f3n.

Only three days after asserting before the Congress that there was no public interest reason to terminate the Concession Contract, on 21 May 2017 Minister Vizcarra announced that the State would terminate the Concession Contract and Addendum No. 1.565 Furthermore, on 4 June 2017, just three days after the Renegotiation Proposal, the new Minister of Transport, Minister Giuffra, announced that \"Kuntur Wasi [would] not be involved in the construction and operation of the Chinchero International Airport.\"566 This was followed by an official announcement, on that same day, by the MTC indicating that the Contract would be terminated by mutual agreement.567\n\nClaimants' Memorial, para. 335, citing **Exhibit C-35**, News article published by Semana Econ\u00f3mica, \"*Aeropuerto de Chinchero: Ejecutivo dejar\u00e1 sin efecto contrato de concesi\u00f3n*, 22 May 2017; **Exhibit C-34**, News clip from Cuarto Poder, \"*Mart\u00edn Vizcarra: 'Chinchero va, pero el Contrato no',*\" 21 May 2017.\n\nClaimants' Memorial, para. 337, citing **Exhibit C-40**, News article published by El Comercio, *\"Gobierno y Kuntur Wasi acordaron resolver contrato por Chinchero, anuncia Giuffra\"*, 4 June 2017.

It also agrees with the Claimants that, to establish a breach of the doctrine of *actos propios*, the three elements set out above in paragraph 430 must be considered.570 Where the Respondent disagrees with the Claimants is on whether elements (i)and (ii)were actually met in the present case.571\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, paras. 215, 216.\n\nRespondent does not deny that there is an identity of the parties, but argues that there is no violation of the *actos propios* doctrine because elements one and two fail. *See* Respondent's Counter-Memorial, para. 220.\n\n437.\n\nFirst, the Respondent argues that the alleged acts of the State in support of Addendum No. 1 do not constitute \"binding conduct\" for purposes of an *actos propios* analysis. According to the Respondent, the fact that some public officials publicly supported the Addendum does not bind the State. Furthermore, the Claimants knew (or should have known)that the Addendum could be subject to the *Contralor\u00eda*'s review and that if the *Contralor\u00eda* had negative findings, the State was obligated to act in accordance with those findings.572\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, para. 217, citing **Exhibit RER-2**, First Ferrando Gamarra Report, paras. 166-171.\n\n438.\n\nSecondly, the Respondent alleges that it always acted in a consistent manner, driven to achieve the public interest of building the Chinchero Airport. In the Respondent's view, it was precisely to achieve the public interest that Peru decided to open the tender process in 2010; to award the Concession to Kuntur Wasi with the expectation of having a new airport built by 2021; to reject Kuntur Wasi's unreasonable financial package; to try to renegotiate the Contract through Addendum No. 1 in the face of Kuntur Wasi's inability to achieve financial closure; to engage in negotiations with Kuntur Wasi again, when the *Contralor\u00eda* \u2013 acting within its legal capacities and exercising its powers \u2013 provided observations with respect to Addendum No. 1; and to terminate the Concession Contract when it became clear that the Parties would not be able to agree on how to amend the Contract and move forward with the Project.573\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, paras. 218, 219.\n\n***b. The Tribunal's Analysis***\n--------------------------------\n\n439.\n\nThe Claimants assert that the Peruvian Government's actions are contrary to its prior own acts and is therefore in breach of its good faith duty. In essence, the doctrine of *actos propios* requires that the contracting party \"observe in the future such conduct as may have been inferred from such party's prior actions.\"574\n\n**Exhibit MTQ-39**, D\u00edez Picazo, Luis (1963), \"*La doctrina de los actos propios*\", Barcelona, Espa\u00f1a: Bosch. P.245., cited in **Exhibit CER-6**, Qui\u00f1ones Alayza Report, para. 172. [Tribunal's translation] The original Spanish reads: \"*observar en el futuro la conducta que los actos anteriores hac\u00edan prever*.\"\n\n440.\n\nThe Parties agree that for the doctrine of *actos propios* to apply three elements are required: (i)a relevant or binding conduct, *i.e.*, a source of legitimate expectation in the other party, (ii)a subsequent incoherent conduct, and (iii)identity of the parties in the first and second elements.575\n\nClaimant's Memorial, para. 312; Respondent's Counter-Memorial, para. 216.\n\n441.\n\nTo assess the first requirement, not only does the prior conduct actually displayed by the Peruvian Government have to be determined, but also the expectations derived from such conduct. The Claimants' claim is confusing in this regard. Based upon the filings made by the Parties, the Tribunal identifies two expectations that, in Kuntur Wasi's view, would have been affected: (i)compliance with the contractual requirements in the event that Peru decided to terminate the Contract576 and (ii)Peru's endorsement of Addendum No. 1 and, therefore, the continuation of the Project.577\n\nClaimants' Memorial, para. 332.\n\nClaimants' Memorial, para. 315.\n\n442.\n\nIn this Tribunal's view, the first expectation that the Claimants allege was violated cannot amount to a breach of the good faith duties distinct from the duties agreed under the Contract. Indeed, Kuntur Wasi alleges that the Peruvian Government's actions led to \"Kuntur Wasi's certainty, expectation and right such that, if Peru were to terminate the Contract, it would proceed in compliance with the stipulated requirements.\"578 However, Kuntur Wasi had not only the *expectation* that a unilateral termination would be exercised in accordance with the Contract, but also a *right* enforceable under the Contract.\n\nClaimants' Memorial, para. 332. [Tribunal's translation] The original Spanish reads: \"*[G]ener\u00f3 la seguridad, la expectative y el derecho de Kuntur Wasi de que, si Per\u00fa iba a decider resolver el Contrato de Concesi\u00f3n, lo har\u00eda cumpliendo los requisitos estipulados expresamente\u2026*\" Law expert Eduardo Benavides also confirmed that this would be at least one of the expectations that the Claimants allege as defrauded. With regard to Kuntur Wasi's claim in this respect, the expert stated that \"If the State, through administrative acts, official admissions by its representatives, formal communications and contractual representations, generates in the concessionaire the confidence that the Project will be executed, that the State will honour its commitments and that the concession will be respected, a legitimate expectation is generated in the concessionaire that the State will respect the concessionaire's rights and will comply with its obligations in defence of the concession.\" (**Exhibit CER-7**, Benavides Torres Report, para. 147)[Tribunal's translation] The original Spanish reads: \"*Si el Estado, a trav\u00e9s de actos administrativos, reconocimientos oficiales de sus representantes, reconocimientos formales y declaraciones contractuales, genera en el concesionario, la confianza de que el Proyecto ser\u00e1 ejecutado, que el Estado cumplir\u00e1 sus compromisos y que se respetar\u00e1 la concesi\u00f3n, se genera una confianza leg\u00edtima en el concesionario de que el Estado respetar\u00e1 los derechos del concesionario y cumplir\u00e1 con sus obligaciones, defendiendo la concesi\u00f3n.*\"\n\n443.\n\nAs reviewed above, Addendum No. 1 was validly entered into and did not result in grounds for Contract termination. This circumstance was acknowledged by the Peruvian Government's representatives, who confirmed that Addendum No. 1 was legal and rejected the *Contralor\u00eda*'s objections.579 In this sense, even if it might be considered that Peru acted in a contradictory manner by terminating the Contract, such contradiction is no different from the breach of the Contract.\n\n**Exhibit C-33**, R*espuestas al pliego interpelatorio de 83 preguntas formuladas por los Congresistas de la Rep\u00fablica en relaci\u00f3n al proyecto Aeropuerto Internacional de Chinchero - Cusco,* 18 May 2017, p.15; **Exhibit C-78**, \"Comunicado en relaci\u00f3n a observaciones realizadas por la Contralor\u00eda,\" MEF, 22 May 2017; **Exhibit C-121**, News clip from CANAL N \"V*iceministra Molinelli: Informe de Contralor\u00eda no tiene sustento t\u00e9cnico*,\" 22 May 2017.\n\n444.\n\nThe doctrine of *actos propios* identifies a duty related to the contractual obligation to conduct business in a consistent manner.580 However, when the expectation that is claimed to have been violated was agreed upon under a contract, the question of a breach of the good faith duty becomes a question of breach of contract, as alleged by Kuntur Wasi and as discussed in the previous section (*supra*, paras. 288 *et seq.*). The analysis of the claim for breach of the doctrine of *actos propios* implies a determination as to whether Peru's actions gave rise to expectations *other than* those expressly agreed upon in the Contract. As a result, the first expectation alleged by the Claimants as having been violated cannot be assessed as matter of *actos propios*, but of contractual breach.\n\n**Exhibit RER-2**, First Ferrando Gamarra Report, para. 162.\n\n445.\n\nBy contrast, the Tribunal considers that in the second expectation alleged by the Claimants as having been violated, the requirement is, at least in the abstract, met. Here, Kuntur Wasi argues that the Respondent generated \"legitimate expectations in the investor that Peru supported Addendum No. 1, that the Project would continue, and that there was no public interest reasons to justify the termination of the Concession Contract.\"581 In this regard, the Tribunal considers that although the Peruvian Government had the power to unilaterally terminate the Contract on the ground set forth in Clause 15.5, a relevant and consistent conduct associated with the inappropriateness of such ground might, eventually, prevent exercise of that power upon the basis of good faith. This is the scope of the doctrine of *actos propios*.\n\nClaimant's Memorial, para. 331. [Tribunal's translation] The original Spanish reads: \"*las expectativas leg\u00edtimas en el inversionista de que Per\u00fa apoyaba la Adenda No. 1, de que el Proyecto continuar\u00eda, y de que no exist\u00eda causal de inter\u00e9s p\u00fablico que justifique la terminaci\u00f3n del Contrato de Concesi\u00f3n.*\"\n\n446.\n\nHowever, under a specific analysis of the record and arguments of the Parties concerning the actual verification of the requirements of the doctrine of *actos propios*, the Tribunal finds that there was no relevant inconsistent or incoherent conduct by the Peruvian Government with regard to the inappropriateness of Contract termination for reasons of public interest, within the context in which the termination notice occurred.\n\n447.\n\nIt is true that the MTC affirmed there was no reason of public interest to terminate the Contract.582 However, these statements were made in the context of challenges against Minister Vizcarra for the defects in the contractual design and the objections raised by the *Contralor\u00eda* to Addendum No. 1.583\n\n**Exhibit C-33**, *Respuestas al pliego interpelatorio de 83 preguntas formuladas por los Congresistas de la Rep\u00fablica en relaci\u00f3n al proyecto Aeropuerto Internacional de Chinchero - Cusco,* 18 May 2017, pp. 23 and 47. Responses to the questionnaire submitted by Congress where Minister Vizcarra stated that \"To declare reasons of public interest requires sound grounds and the signature of several Ministers. Undoubtedly, if such grounds existed, public clause could be invoked; in the case of the \"Chinchero\" Airport there was no way to configure such legal issue.\" [Tribunal's translation] The original Spanish reads: \"*Declarar una raz\u00f3n de inter\u00e9s p\u00fablico requiere un sustento firme y la firma de varios Ministros. Sin duda si existieran esas razones se podr\u00eda invocar esa clausula, en el caso del Aeropuerto \"Chinchero\" no hab\u00eda forma de configurar una situaci\u00f3n legal de ese tipo.*\"\n\n**Exhibit C-33**, *Respuestas al pliego interpelatorio de 83 preguntas formuladas por los Congresistas de la Rep\u00fablica en relaci\u00f3n al proyecto Aeropuerto Internacional de Chinchero - Cusco*, 18 May 2017, p. 14, 23, 24, 29 and 47.\n\n448.\n\nBased on these statements, the Tribunal agrees with Kuntur Wasi that the Peruvian Government may have generated certain expectations that the Contract would not be terminated due to the objections raised against Addendum No. 1. But this does not prevent the Peruvian Government from legitimately considering a unilateral termination under Clause 15.5 in the face of new circumstances.\n\n449.\n\nIndeed, after the objections raised by the *Contralor\u00eda* to Addendum No. 1 became known and the MTC, the MEF and other public agencies supported execution of such Addendum, the Parties signed the Roadmap, in which they expressed their intention to (i)renegotiate the Contract or (ii)terminate the Contract by mutual agreement.584\n\nClaimants' Reply, para. 28.\n\n450.\n\nThe Tribunal believes that the Roadmap is particularly relevant to the analysis of a legitimate expectation that the Contract would not be terminated and that it would be executed pursuant to Addendum No.1. Although Addendum No.1 was the contractual framework in force, the subsequent subscription of the Roadmap concerning its modification or, failing that, the termination of the Contract, undercuts the conclusion that Kuntur Wasi had a legitimate expectation that the Contract would remain in force under the terms of Addendum No.1.\n\n451.\n\nIn this regard, the Tribunal considers that the MTC's execution and subsequent defence of Addendum No. 1 are expressions of Peru's good faith negotiation to ensure the continuity of the Project. However, these actions lose force as the basis for a legitimate expectation that the Contract would be executed in accordance with the terms agreed under Addendum No. 1, as the Claimants themselves by signing the Roadmap were willing to renegotiate those terms.\n\n452.\n\nBased on the above considerations, this claim must be rejected by the Tribunal. First, because terminating the Contract in accordance with the requirements set forth therein was not an expectation of Kuntur Wasi created by Peru's conduct, but a contractual right whose violation was analyzed in the previous section; and second, because Kuntur Wasi, by signing the Roadmap, agreed to renegotiate or at least revise the terms of Addendum No.1, thus losing the expectation that the Contract would necessarily be performed pursuant to the terms previously agreed.\n\n**(3)Kuntur Wasi's termination of the Concession Contract was valid and has consequences under Peruvian law**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n***a. The Parties' Positions***\n-------------------------------\n\n**(i)The Claimants' Position**\n------------------------------\n\n453.\n\nAs explained above, the Claimants' position is that Peru's unilateral termination of the Concession Contract was contrary to the express terms of the Concession Contract and as such, invalid. This, on the Claimants' case, itself constituted a breach of the Concession Contract. On the basis of this understanding, and despite renegotiation efforts, the Claimants claim that they were forced to terminate the Contract pursuant to Article 1429 of the Peruvian Civil Code.585\n\nClaimants' Memorial, para. 456.\n\n454.\n\nThe Claimants explain that, under Peruvian law, the termination of the Contract for breach requires proof that: (i)there was a breach; (ii)the non-breaching party requested the other party to amend its breach and comply with the Contract; and (iii)at least 15 days must have elapsed after the request.586\n\nClaimants' Memorial, para. 457.\n\n455.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, there can be no doubt that the Respondent breached the Concession Contract (as explained in the previous sections). Secondly, the Claimants requested Peru to comply with the Contract and to remedy its breaches, by letter of 22 January 2018.587 Despite this request, Peru failed to remedy its breach. For this reason, Kuntur Wasi sent a letter to the MTC on 7 February 2018, informing the MTC of the termination of the Concession Contract.588\n\n**Exhibit C-88**, Letter No. 014-2018-KW, 22 January 2018.\n\nClaimants' Memorial, para. 460; **Exhibit C-89**, Letter No. 018-2018-KW, 7 February 2018.\n\n456.\n\nFinally, the Claimants allege that the consequence of a termination for breach is that the breaching party must pay compensation for any damages caused to the non-breaching party, pursuant to Article 1429 of the Peruvian Civil Code.589\n\nClaimants' Memorial, para. 462.\n\n**(ii)The Respondent's Position**\n---------------------------------\n\n457.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, it validly and legitimately terminated the Concession Contract for public interest reasons in July 2017, as explained above at paras. 335 *et seq*. However, the Respondent argues that, even if it had breached the Contract, the Contract expressly limits the amount of compensation that can be awarded to the Concessionaire under such circumstances to sunk costs duly recognized by OSITRAN.590\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, para. 235.\n\n458.\n\nIn particular, the Respondent relies on Clause 15.4 of the Concession Contract, which establishes that in case the Contract is terminated because of the MTC's breach, the MTC only has to pay the Concessionaire \"the general expenses incurred [by the concessionaire] until the date on which the Contract is terminated, duly verified and approved by OSITRAN.\"591\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, para. 235, citing **Exhibit C-4**, Concession Contract, Cl. 15.4.3(a). The original Spanish reads: \"*los gastos generales en que haya incurrido hasta la fecha en que surta efecto la resoluci\u00f3n del Contrato, debidamente acreditados y reconocidos por el OSITRAN.*\"\n\n459.\n\nNotably, however, the Claimants have refused to provide OSITRAN any information about the expenses to be paid, and, therefore, at the moment, there were no expenses to be paid to Kuntur Wasi.592\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, paras. 127, 235.\n\n***b. The Tribunal's Analysis***\n--------------------------------\n\n460.\n\nKuntur Wasi's allegations under this claim imply declaring that (i)Peru's termination was \"invalid and ineffective,\"593 (ii)consequently, the contractual obligations remained enforceable subsequent to the communication of termination by the MTC, and (iii)that Kuntur Wasi's subsequent termination was valid and had the effects prescribed by the Peruvian Civil Code.594\n\nClaimants' Memorial, para. 455. [Tribunal's translation] The original Spanish reads: \"*inv\u00e1lida e ineficaz.\"*\n\nClaimants' Memorial, para. 461.\n\n461.\n\nThe Tribunal has already held that Peru's termination of the Concession Contract, without a well-founded reason of public interest, amounts to a breach of contract (*supra,* para. 427). Therefore, the Tribunal must now analyze the legal effects of such improper termination.\n\n462.\n\nIn response to Kuntur Was\"s request that Peru's unilateral termination be declared ineffective, the Respondent merely affirmed that said termination was legitimate.595 On the other hand, if this Tribunal were to find that the termination violated the terms of the Concession Contract (as has ultimately been held), Peru merely stated its position with respect to the applicable statute governing damages, but failed to qualify the legal consequences of the improper termination.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, p. 235; Respondent's Rejoinder, para. 315.\n\n463.\n\nThe Tribunal finds that the unilateral termination communicated by the MTC was ineffective, since it did not comply with one of the requirements established in the Concession Contract, *i.e.*, to be supported by a well-founded reason of public interest. As a logical consequence, the termination communicated by the MTC on 13 July 2017 by means of Official Letter No. 142-2017-MTC/01 did not terminate the contractual relationship.\n\n464.\n\nAlthough this finding implies holding that the contractual relationship remained in force during the subsequent months, the conclusion would be the same if the Tribunal were to declare that termination was effective. Indeed, according to Clause 15.5.1 of the Concession Contract, the unilateral termination exercised by Peru would only be effective upon the lapse of six months after its communication, that is, in January 2018. As soon as this term had expired, Kuntur Wasi informed its intention to terminate the Concession Contract.\n\n465.\n\nIndeed, by letter dated 22 January 2018, Kuntur Wasi set out the breaches which -in its view- Peru incurred and which entitled Kuntur Wasi to request the termination of the Concession Contract. In this regard, Kuntur Wasi informed as follows \"[u]nder these circumstances, Kuntur Wasi gives the Grantor one last chance and, in accordance with Article 1429 of the Civil Code, which is a supplementary provision applicable to all contracts, (\u2026)requires that the Grantor pay the Advance Payment [\u2026] [and] comply with all its obligations; within fifteen (15)days from the receipt of this communication. This requirement is made under penalty that upon expiration of said time limit, the Concession Contract shall be deemed terminated by operation of law and compensation shall be sought for damages, loss of profit and moral damages caused by the Grantor .\"596\n\n**Exhibit C-88**, Letter No. 014-2018-KW, 22 January 2018, p. 8. [Tribunal's translation]. The original Spanish reads: \"*Frente a esta situaci\u00f3n, Kuntur Wasi otorga una \u00faltima oportunidad al Concedente y, conforme al articulo 1429 del C6digo Civil, norma supletoria aplicable a todo contrato, lo requiere a pagar el Valor de Adelanto [\u2026], lo requiere a cumplir con todas sus obligaciones; ello dentro del plazo de quince (15)d\u00edas de recibida esta comunicaci\u00f3n.

The original Spanish reads: \"*[\u2026] en tanto los incumplimientos del Concedente se han producido voluntariamente o, en el mejor de los casos, con culpa inexcusable, no son de aplicaci\u00f3n los l\u00edmites de responsabilidad establecidos en el Contrato de Concesi\u00f3n [\u2026] El monto de la indemnizaci\u00f3n deber\u00e1 ser determinado por el Tribunal Arbitral conforme a la Cl\u00e1usula D\u00e9cimo Sexta del Contrato de Concesi\u00f3n*.\"\n\n467.\n\nPursuant to the relief sought by Kuntur Wasi, the Tribunal has to analyze whether the above-mentioned termination, within the framework of Article 1429 of the Peruvian Civil Code, \"is valid and, therefore, has legal effects on the Concession Contract.\"600 The Tribunal will sustain this request, subject to the following qualifiers.\n\nClaimants' Memorial, para. 674, (e). [Tribunal's translation] The original Spanish reads: \"*es v\u00e1lida y, por lo tanto, produce efectos jur\u00eddicos en el Contrato de Concesi\u00f3n.*\"\n\n468.\n\nFirst, Kuntur Wasi was authorized to request the termination of the Concession Contract. As stated in this decision (*supra*, para. 427), improper termination by Peru also amounted to a breach of the Concession Contract. It is a breach by the Grantor (*Concedente*), here, Peru, that enables the Concessionaire to terminate the contractual relationship on an early basis, both pursuant to the terms of the Concession Contract (Clause 15.4)and pursuant to the general rules prescribed by the Peruvian Civil Code (Article 1428). In this respect, both regulations are consistent, as they offer the creditor a termination remedy upon the debtor's breach.\n\n469.\n\nThe Tribunal sees no obstacle in declaring that the termination of the Concession Contract was, in this case, consistent with the Civil Code's prerogative. As a result, the Concession Contract was terminated *ipso iure*, *i.e.*, by operation of law, when the 15-day time limit from the date when Kuntur Wasi's request for compliance of 22 January 2018 expired. In other words, the fact that the terms of the Concession Contract enable the Concessionaire to exercise a termination remedy for the Grantor's breach, does not prevent the fact that such very remedy, provided in the interest of the damaged party, may be exercised pursuant to the supplementary rules of civil law prescribed in the Civil Code.\n\n470.\n\nNonetheless, the finding above is independent from the damages rules applicable to the case, a matter over which the Parties entered into a special agreement to limit the Civil Code's common or supplementary regime.\n\n471.\n\nEven if damages are discussed in a different section herein-below (*infra*, paras. 801 *et seq.*), the Tribunal deems it relevant to advance certain considerations in view of the discussion between the Parties in this respect.\n\n472.\n\nThe Parties agreed upon a special damages regime to be applied to the different events of termination (Clause 15). Particularly, Clause 15.4 of the Concession Contract governs damages due in the event of termination for breach by the Grantor. Clause 15.4.4 expressly provides that \"[t]he items listed in this Clause shall be the only payments admitted in favour of CONCESSIONAIRE, and include admission of various expenses arising under the Concession.\"601 [Tribunal's translation]\n\nThe original Spanish reads: \"*[l]os conceptos se\u00f1alados en la presente Cl\u00e1usula son los \u00fanicos pagos a ser reconocidos a favor del CONCESIONARIO, que incluye el reconocimiento de los gastos diversos con motive de la Concesi\u00f3n.*\"\n\n473.\n\nKuntur Wasi admitted the existence of this agreement to limit liability by indicating in its letter of termination that such limits would not be applicable, on the grounds that Peru's breaches had been *committed wilfully or upon gross negligence* (*supra*, para. 466). In other words, according to Kuntur Wasi, the application of the damages provisionsof the Civil Code (not limited to the damages specified in the Concession Contract)is subject to a finding of wilful misconduct or gross negligence on the part of the MTC (Article 1321 of the Peruvian Civil Code). As noted in this Decision (*infra*, para. 577), the Tribunal has concluded that the MTC did not engage in wilful misconduct or gross negligence in breaching the Concession Contract.\n\n474.\n\nKuntur Wasi's letter of termination also acknowledges other applicable contractual clauses, in order to prepare the inventory, the return of the assets and the reimbursement of the bond. It is worth noting that reimbursement of the bond is precisely regulated in Clause 15.4.5 of the Concession Contract, under the section that governs termination for breach by the Grantor (*Concedente*). In other words, the termination of the Concession Contract in accordance with the general rules of the Civil Code does not imply waiving the Concession Contract in other matters especially agreed upon by the Parties. Such was the understanding of the Claimants when they terminated the Contract for breach.\n\n475.\n\nThus, the Tribunal concludes that (i)the termination communicated by Peru on 13 July 2017 did not have the effect of terminating the contractual relationship; and (ii)this contractual relationship remained in force until the termination communicated by Kuntur Wasi became effective, on 7 February 2018. The effects derived from both conclusions, particularly in terms of damages, are addressed in the relevant sections of this decision.\n\n**(4)Peru's failure to make the Advance Payment constituted a breach of its obligations under the Concession Contract, as amended**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n***a. The Parties Positions***\n------------------------------\n\n**(i)The Claimants' Position**\n------------------------------\n\n476.\n\nAs explained above at para. 159, according to Addendum No. 1, the MTC would pay Kuntur Wasi an Advance Payment of US$ 40 million, within 30 days of signing the Addendum, provided that Kuntur Wasi delivered an Advance Payment Guarantee (\"*Garant\u00eda de Adelanto\"*)to the State (*i.e*., a letter of guarantee for the amount of the Advance Payment, which would secure the appropriate use of the amount received in the Advance Payment).602\n\nClaimants' Memorial, para. 349, citing **Exhibit C-24**, Addendum No. 1, Cl. 3.12.\n\n477.\n\nHowever, on the Claimants' case, before the Claimants could issue the *Garantia de Adelanto* (within the deadline provided in the Contract), Peru had already declared that it would not comply with its obligation to pay de Advance Payment on 4 June 2017, and ultimately terminated the Contract on 13 July 2017. In these circumstances, there was \u2013 on the Claimants' case \u2013 a risk that even if Kuntur Wasi delivered the *Garantia de Adelanto*, Peru would simply not make the Advance Payment.603\n\nClaimants' Memorial, para. 351; Claimants' Reply, paras. 151 *et seq*.\n\n478.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, Article 1427 of the Peruvian Civil Code establishes that, when there is a risk that the party to the contract that was supposed to carry out a subsequent obligation (*i.e.*, Peru by making the Advance Payment)will not be able to perform under the contract, the party who was supposed to perform in the first place (here, Kuntur Wasi by delivering the *Garant\u00eda de Adelanto*)may suspend its obligations until the second party performs its obligations or offers guarantees that it will perform.604 On the basis of this provision, on 14 August 2017, Kuntur Wasi sent a letter to the MTC, requesting payment of the Advance Payment despite not having issued the *Garant\u00eda de Adelanto*.605\n\nClaimants' Memorial, para. 352.\n\nClaimants' Memorial, para. 353; **Exhibit C-147**, Letter No. 098-2017-KW, 18 August 2017.\n\n479.\n\nThe MTC replied to the Claimants' letter on 31 August 2017, indicating that the Concession Contract had been unilaterally terminated on 13 July 2017 and, therefore, that Peru would not make the Advance Payment.606 According to the Claimants, even if the MTC's termination was considered valid, pursuant to Clause 15.8.7 of the Concession Contract, in case the termination was subject to arbitration proceedings, the termination itself would only take effect after the issuance of the corresponding arbitral award.607 Therefore, at the moment Kuntur Wasi requested payment of the Advance Payment, the Concession Contract was still in force and Peru was therefore in default pursuant to Article 1333.3 of the Peruvian Civil Code.608\n\nClaimants' Memorial, para. 354, citing **Exhibit C-148**, *Oficio No. 3562-2017-MTC*, 31 August 2017.\n\nClaimants' Memorial, para. 355; Claimants' Reply, paras. 570 *et seq*.\n\nClaimants' Memorial, para. 356.\n\n**(ii)The Respondent's Position**\n---------------------------------\n\n480.\n\nThe Respondent, on the other hand, argues that before 30 days had passed after signing Addendum No. 1, the *Contralor\u00eda* issued its Preliminary Report, alerting about the potential problems with the Addendum. In light of the *Contralor\u00eda*'s report, in February 2017, the Parties agreed to suspend their obligations under the Contract, including those related to the Advance Payment and in May 2017, the Parties decided to extend this suspension until the end of August 2017. Thus, the Respondent argues that during that time it did not have an obligation to make the Advance Payment.609\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, paras. 110, 118, 226.\n\n481.\n\nOn 13 July 2017, the State unilaterally terminated the Contract and, therefore, the obligation to pay the Advance Payment (or any other obligation under the Contract)no longer existed.610\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, para. 226.\n\n482.\n\nFinally, the Respondent argues that even if the Tribunal were to consider that the State had an obligation to make the Advance Payment, such obligation was conditional on Kuntur Wasi delivering an Advance Payment Guarantee, which it never did.611\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, para. 226.\n\n***b. The Tribunal's Analysis***\n--------------------------------\n\n483.\n\nThrough Addendum No. 1, the Parties designed a new financial scheme whereby they replaced the PAO system for Sub-Stage 2 with a PPO system (*supra*, para. 404). The new design also provided for the delivery of an advance payment by Peru for the commencement of the works under this stage.\n\n484.\n\nAddendum No. 1 stipulates that the \"Amount of the Advance Payment\" would be US$ 40,262,870, which would be paid by Peru to Kuntur Wasi \"within thirty calendar days following the date of execution of Addendum No. 1 to the Concession Contract\" (Clause 3.12 of the Addendum).612 The same Clause provides that for delivery of the Amount of the Advance Payment \"the CONCESSIONAIRE shall previously deliver to the GRANTOR a letter of guarantee for the Advance Payment Guarantee for the Works under the PPO 2 and give instructions on the account to which the transfer or deposit of the aforementioned amount is to be made.\"613 Clause 10.2.4 of the Concession Contract (incorporated under Clause 3.21 of Addendum No.1)details the obligations of Peru and Kuntur Wasi in relation to the delivery of the Amount of the Advance Payment and the Advance Payment Guarantee, respectively.\n\n[Tribunal's translation] The original Spanish reads: \"*dentro de los treinta d\u00edas calendario siguientes a la fecha de la firma de la Adenda N\u00ba1 al Contrato de Concesi\u00f3n.*\"\n\n[Tribunal's translation] The original Spanish reads: \"*el CONCESIONARIO deber\u00e1 entregar previamente al CONCEDENTE la carta fianza por la Garant\u00eda de Adelanto para las Obras retribuidas por el PPO 2 e instruir respect de la cuenta a la se realice la transferencia o dep\u00f3sito del monto antes referido*.\"\n\n485.\n\nThe Parties do not dispute the existence or the terms of these obligations. Both Parties agree that Peru was required to deliver the Amount of the Advance Payment within 30 days from the execution of Addendum No. 1, upon delivery of the Advance Payment Guarantee by Kuntur Wasi.614 The discussion focuses, instead, on the enforceability of the obligations in view of the events that took place after Addendum No. 1 was entered into.\n\nClaimants' Memorial, para. 351; Respondent's Counter-Memorial, para. 226.\n\n486.\n\nOn 22 February 2017, the *Contralor\u00eda* issued a preliminary opinion on Addendum No.1 warning that the delivery of the Amount of the Advance Payment, under the terms provided for in Addendum No.1, posed a risk that the Concessionaire might use the amount for a purpose other than that it was intended (*supra,* para. 173).\n\n487.\n\nIn response to said warnings, the MTC requested that Kuntur Wasi suspend the obligations until the final opinion by the *Contralor\u00eda* was available.615 On 2 March 2017, the Parties agreed to temporarily suspend the obligation to deliver the Advance Payment Guarantee, the Amount of the Advance Payment and, consequently, to suspend the commencement of the Works Execution Stage. According to the suspension resolution, the Parties reached that agreement \"to safeguard the interests of the Peruvian Government and in response to the Concessionaire's intention to assure that the funds of the Amount of the Advance Payment [would] be undoubtedly channelled through transparent vehicles and with the necessary traceability.\"616\n\n**Exhibit R-75**, *Oficio No. 0813-2017-MTC/25*, 27 February 2017.\n\n**Exhibit C-31**, *Acta de acuerdo de Suspensi\u00f3n Temporal de Obligaciones Contractuales*, 2 March 2017, Section V. [Tribunal's translation] The original Spanish reads: \"\u2026 *en cautela de los intereses del Estado Peruano y de la preocupaci\u00f3n del Concesionario que no exista duda alguna que los fondos del Valor del Adelanto se van a canalizar mediante veh\u00edculos transparentes y con la trazabilidad necesaria.*\"\n\n488.\n\nOn 22 May 2017, the *Contralor\u00eda* issued its final opinion through Audit Report No. 265-2017. On 31 May 2017, the Parties agreed to extend the suspension period for 90 days as from June 1. Thus, the obligations would be suspended until 30 August 2017.617 However, on 13 July 2017, while the suspension was still in effect, Peru notified Kuntur Wasi of the unilateral termination of the Concession Contract pursuant to Clause 15.5.1.\n\n**Exhibit C-32**, *Adenda al Acta de Suspensi\u00f3n Temporal de Obligaciones Contractuales*, 31 May 2017.\n\n489.\n\nOn 18 August 2017, Kuntur Wasi sent a letter to the MTC expressing the view that the unilateral termination informed by Peru did not comply with the requirements set forth in the Contract. According to Kuntur Wasi, this event posed a *clear and imminent risk* that Peru might not comply with its obligations upon termination of the suspension. In this context, Kuntur Wasi advised that, upon application of Article 1427 of the Civil Code, Kuntur Wasi would suspend the delivery of the Advance Payment Guarantee until the MTC first complied with the payment of the Amount of the Advance Payment or granted a guarantee to secure such Advance Payment. It also added that \"as long as the Grantor does not comply with the payment of the indicated amount or does not grant a guarantee to secure such amount, the Grantor will be in voluntary breach of its contractual obligations.\"618\n\n**Exhibit C-147**, Letter No. 098-2017-KW, 18 August 2017, p. 2. [Tribunal's translation] The original Spanish reads: \"\u2026*en tanto el Concedente no cumpla con el pago del monto indicado o no otorgue garant\u00eda que lo respalde, incurrir\u00e1 en incumplimiento voluntario de sus obligaciones contractuales.*\"\n\n490.\n\nOn 31 August 2017, Peru rejected this requirement, asserting that the unilateral termination was *valid, legitimate and effective*. In Peru's opinion, requesting the payment of the Amount of the Advance Payment upon termination of the suspension made no sense \"since the MTC has unilaterally terminated the Contract by letter dated 13 July 2017, which termination shall be effective on 13 January 2018.\"619\n\n**Exhibit C-148,** Oficio N\u00b0 3562-2017-MTC, 31 August 2017, p. 2. [Tribunal's translation] The original Spanish reads: \"*\u2026 por cuanto el MTC ha declarado la caducidad unilateral del Contrato mediante carta del 13 de julio de 2017, caducidad que se producir\u00e1 el 13 de enero de 2018.*\"\n\n491.\n\nThe Claimants contend that Peru breached the Concession Contract by failing to deliver the Amount of the Advance Payment, pursuant to Article 1427 of the Peruvian Civil Code. The Claimants assert that the termination of the Contract was ineffective and that, according to Clause 15.5.1, even if the termination had been validly exercised, it would only take effect as of January 2018, so that Peru was required to deliver the Amount of the Advance Payment (*supra*, paras. 478, 479). Meanwhile, the Respondent contends that the Contract was validly terminated and that, therefore, the obligation to deliver the Amount of the Advance Payment ceased to exist as of that time. The Respondent also asserts that, in any event, this obligation was contingent upon the delivery of the Advance Payment Guarantee, which Kuntur Wasi never provided (*supra*, paras. 480-482).\n\n492.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees with Kuntur Wasi in that, once the suspension was terminated, the Parties had to resume performance of their obligations. Indeed, Clause 15.5.1 establishes that the termination must be notified \"not less than six (6)months prior to the date set for termination.\"620 Thus, regardless of the alleged validity of the unilateral termination exercised by Peru (which this Tribunal has rejected), it was appropriate to seek performance of the enforceable obligations.\n\n[Tribunal's translation] The original Spanish reads: \"\u2026*con una antelaci\u00f3n no inferior a seis (6)meses del plazo previsto para la terminaci\u00f3n.*\"\n\n493.\n\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, this Tribunal finds that the Claimants' claim is not admissible for the reasons explained below.\n\n494.\n\nKuntur Wasi's claim is based upon Article 1427 of the Peruvian Civil Code, which provides as follows:\n\n*If subsequent to termination of a contract for mutual consideration there is a risk that the party who must perform in the second place will not be able to comply with its duties, the party who must perform in the first place may suspend performance until the other party duly performs or secures such performance.621*\n\n[Tribunal's translation. The original Spanihs reads: \"*Si despu\u00e9s de concluido un contrato con prestaciones rec\u00edprocas sobreviniese el riesgo de que la parte que debe cumplir en segundo lugar no pueda hacerlo, la que debe efectuar la prestaci\u00f3n en primer lugar puede suspender su ejecuci\u00f3n, hasta que aqu\u00e9lla satisfaga la que le concierne o garantice su cumplimiento.*\"\n\n495.\n\nFirst, the rule requires that consideration be *mutual*. According to Dr. Ferrando, the obligations in this claim did not meet this requirement, since the Amount of the Advance Payment had to be delivered only once Kuntur Wasi had delivered the Advance Payment Guarantee. In other words, they were successive, not simultaneous, obligations.622\n\n**Exhibit RER-6**, Second Ferrando Gamarra Report, paras. 141-144.\n\n496.\n\nThe Tribunal disagrees with this argument. Mutual consideration does not mean that obligations must be performed simultaneously, but rather that an obligation is due in exchange for another; they are designed to facilitate or accept the performance of another obligation; or they are obligations whose performance can only be reasonably understood as contingent upon the performance of the other. Kuntur Wasi's obligation to deliver the Advance Payment Guarantee, even though it was due prior to receiving the Amount of the Advance Payment, was clearly linked to the Peruvian Government's obligation. Therefore, the first requirement of the rule analyzed is met.\n\n497.\n\nThus, Kuntur Wasi was legally excused from delivering the Advance Payment Guarantee once Peru notified it of the improper termination and throughout the effective period of the Contract. As the rule provides, *the party who must perform in the first place may suspend performance*. The rule operates as an incentive for the counter-party to continue performance under the Contract.\n\n498.\n\nNonetheless, Kuntur Wasi's claim in this case does not conform to the remedy available under the article invoked. Indeed, Kuntur Wasi does not seek an excuse for its breach in order to maintain the Contract, but requests that this Tribunal determine that Peru breached the obligation to deliver the amount of the Advance Payment in order to justify Kuntur Wasi's termination. On the other hand, the obligation to deliver this amount was never enforceable, because the Claimant breached its own duty. In fact, both the obligation to deliver the amount of the Advance Payment and the obligation to deliver the Guarantee were discharged once Kuntur Wasi terminated the Concession Contract. As concluded above, Kuntur Wasi's termination was valid and effective as of 7 February 2018 (*supra,* para. 475). However, this termination was not founded on Article 1427 of the Peruvian Civil Code.\n\n499.\n\nFurthermore, the Tribunal notes that this claim has no practical effects in terms of compensation. If the Peruvian Government had delivered the Amount of the Advance Payment, it could have executed the Advance Payment Guarantee or, failing that, Kuntur Wasi would now have a duty to reimburse such amount.\n\n500.\n\nFor the reasons above, the Tribunal rejects the Claimants' claim discussed in this section.\n\n**(5)Peru's requests that Kuntur Wasi return the Concession area were wrongful**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n***a. The Parties' Positions***\n-------------------------------\n\n**(i)The Claimants' Position**\n------------------------------\n\n501.\n\nThe Claimants further claim that, pursuant to Clause 5.2 of the Concession Contract, Kuntur Wasi should be in possession of the Concession area through the duration of the Contract.623 Furthermore, in the Claimants' view, in case there was a dispute in relation to the termination of the Contract, Clause 15.8.7 established that the Concession Contract would remain in effect until there was a final award on the matter.624 Therefore, it was legitimate for Kuntur Wasi to retain the Concession area until a final award was issued, and the MTC breached the Concession Contract by repeatedly demanding that Kuntur Wasi return the Concession area.625\n\nClaimants' Memorial, para. 358.\n\nClaimants' Memorial, para. 359; Claimants' Reply, paras. 153, 574-577.\n\nClaimants' Memorial, paras. 360-369; Claimants' Reply, para. 153.\n\n**(ii)The Respondent's Position**\n---------------------------------\n\n502.\n\nPursuant to Clause 15.5.1 of the Contract, unilateral termination would enter into effect six months after the MTC notified Kuntur Wasi that it was terminating the Contract (*i.e.*, on 13 January 2018). Clause 15.8.1 provides that once a termination takes effect, the Concessionaire must return the airport land to the MTC. Thus, the Respondent asserts that rather than a breach of the Contract, demanding the return of the airport land was the MTC's obligation.626\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, para. 227.\n\n503.\n\nThe Respondent also rejects the Claimants' argument that Clause 15.8.7 meant that it was not required to return the airport land until after the arbitration award was issued. According to the Respondent's expert, Dr. Ferrando, Clause 15.8.7 is not applicable because the Contract expressly states that, in case of unilateral termination, the termination will be effective within six months after notice of termination. Furthermore, in January 2018 (*i.e.*, when the unilateral termination took effect), Kuntur Wasi had not yet submitted its request for arbitration and, therefore, the termination was not subject to an arbitral proceeding.627\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, paras. 227, 228, citing **Exhibit RER-2**, First Ferrando Gamarra Report, paras. 181-189.\n\n***b. The Tribunal's Analysis***\n--------------------------------\n\n504.\n\nThe Tribunal has already established that the unilateral termination by Peru was improper and, therefore, ineffective. Consequently, the Contract remained in force until termination by operation of law on 7 February 2018, upon Kuntur Wasi's request (*supra,* para. 475).\n\n505.\n\nThis means that Kuntur Wasi was validly entitled to hold the Concession assets until the date mentioned in the preceding paragraph. Clause 5.2 of the Concession Contract embraces this right as follows: \"The CONCESIONNAIRE shall hold possession, use and benefit of all the Concession Assets, the right to provide Airport and Non-Airport Services, as well as the exercise of such rights as may be necessary to comply with the obligations under this Contract and Applicable Law.\"628\n\n[Tribunal's translation] The original Spanish reads: \"*El CONCESIONARIO tendr\u00e1 la posesi\u00f3n, el uso y disfrute de los Bienes de la Concesi\u00f3n, el derecho a la prestaci\u00f3n de los Servicios Aeroportuarios y Servicios No Aeroportuarios, as\u00ed como el ejercicio de los derechos que sean necesarios para que cumpla con las obligaciones a su cargo establecidas en el presente Contrato y las Leyes Aplicables.*\"\n\n506.\n\nHowever, Kuntur Wasi's claim requires not only declaring Kuntur Wasi's legitimate possession of the Concession assets until the date of their restitution. The claim also requires a declaration that Peru breached the Contract *by repeatedly demanding the return of the Concession Area despite clear contractual provisions to the contrary.*629 Thus, the Tribunal must determine whether a demand, contrary to the terms of the Contract, amounts to a breach by the demanding party.\n\nClaimants' Memorial, para. 371. [Tribunal's translation] The original Spanish reads: \"*exigir reiteradamente la devoluci\u00f3n del \u00c1rea de la Concesi\u00f3n pese a las claras disposiciones contractuales en sentido contrario.*\"\n\n507.\n\nAs a defence, the Peruvian Government refers to the Contract terms to justify said demand. In particular, the Respondent asserts the following as grounds for the Respondent's legitimate right to the return of the Concession area: (i)the termination was effective as of 13 January 2018, and therefore Kuntur Wasi had the duty to return the Concession area as of such date pursuant to Clause 15.8.1; (ii)Clause 15.8.7, which provides for the suspension of the effects of termination until an arbitral award is issued, would not apply (1)because Clause 15.5.1 provides for the suspension of the effects of termination for six months as from the date of notice of termination, a provision that should prevail for reasons of its specificity, and (2)because by the time when the termination of the Contract became effective, Kuntur Wasi had not initiated yet the arbitration proceeding objecting to such termination.\n\n508.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that, regardless of the merits of the above-mentioned defences, Kuntur Wasi's claim is not admissible because Peru did not breach any obligation by demanding that the Concession area be returned.\n\n509.\n\nIt was Peru's duty to provide the land for the execution of the Project, while Kuntur Wasi was entitled, in turn, to retain possession of the Concession area until Contract termination. This is precisely what happened in the case. In fact, Kuntur Wasi only returned the land on 8 February 2018, the date on which the Record of Return of the Concession assets was entered into and the day after the Concession Contract was terminated by operation of law (*supra,* para. 206).\n\n510.\n\nThe demands for the early return of the Concession area might, at most, be qualified as conduct contrary to the principle of good faith, as it disregards the agreed-upon contractual framework. Nonetheless, this consideration does not suffice to determine that there was a breach by Peru; rather, it may only be relevant for the purposes of assessing whether the Concession Contract was repudiated. This matter will be discussed in a different section below (*infra*, paras. 521 *et seq.*).\n\n511.\n\nLastly, as established regarding the claim on the delivery of the Amount of the Advance Payment, the Tribunal does not find that this claim has practical consequences in terms of compensation. No damage has been sustained as a result of the demand for early return of the Concession area, which, in any case, had to be returned by the end of the Concession.\n\n**(6)Peru breached the Concession Contract by benefitting from the EDI without paying for it**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n***a. The Parties' Positions***\n-------------------------------\n\n**(i)The Claimants' Position**\n------------------------------\n\n512.\n\nAs explained above, under the Concession Contract, Kuntur Wasi had the obligation to prepare and deliver the EDI. This was a detailed set of executive or shop drawings of the Project, with a sufficient level of detail to allow the commencement of the construction works.630 On 27 May 2015, Kuntur Wasi submitted its EDI to OSITRAN. OSITRAN then provided comments, which were addressed by Kuntur Wasi in a resubmitted EDI. The final EDI was approved by OSITRAN on 7 December 2015.631\n\nClaimants' Memorial, para. 372.\n\nClaimants' Memorial, para. 373; **Exhibit C-5**, *Oficio No. 1553-2015-MTC/12.08*, 7 December 2015.\n\n513.\n\nKuntur Wasi's claim in relation to the EDI is that the Respondent is currently using and benefitting from Kuntur Wasi's EDI in order to carry out the Project with other contractors, but has not paid for it. In particular, the Claimants point out that the new tender process for the Chinchero Airport expressly stated that the new concessionaire would have to use Kuntur Wasi's EDI as a point of departure in relation to the first phase of the works (*i.e.*, earthworks), modifying it from there.632\n\nClaimants' Memorial, para. 375.\n\n514.\n\nFinally, the Claimants argue that Peru must pay for all the costs incurred by Kuntur Wasi in preparing the EDI, and that the State's offer must not be \"generic or conditional.\"633\n\nClaimants' Memorial, para. 376.\n\n**(ii)The Respondent's Position**\n---------------------------------\n\n515.\n\nThe Respondent does not deny having used Kuntur Wasi's EDI. Rather, the Respondent's argument is that it has made several attempts to pay Kuntur Wasi for the EDI, but the Claimants have refused to receive payment. According to the Respondent, when a creditor refuses payment of the obligation, the debtor is not in default.634\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, para. 229; **Exhibit R-108**, *Oficio No. 583-2019-MTC/02*, 6 November 2019.\n\n***b. The Tribunal's Analysis***\n--------------------------------\n\n516.\n\nKuntur Wasi seeks a determination of breach of the Concession Contract because the EDI was not paid for. The Parties do not dispute that Kuntur Wasi prepared and delivered the EDI in accordance with the requirements of the Contract.635 Nor do they dispute that payment was due. The Parties differ, however, as to whether a breach of the Contract may be declared upon said ground, taking into account that the MTC offered payment which was rejected by Kuntur Wasi because the latter considered that the amount offered covered the costs of the EDI only partially and was conditioned on the Claimants' agreement to withdraw their claims in this arbitration proceeding.636\n\nClaimants' Memorial, para. 373; Respondent's Counter-Memorial, para. 229.\n\nClaimants' Memorial, para. 376; Claimants' Reply, paras. 805.\n\n517.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the Claimants only raised this claim as a breach of contract in their Memorial.637 In contrast, in their Reply, the Claimants raised this claim exclusively as a violation of the BIT for expropriation of intellectual property.638 The arguments raised in connection with the contractual claim and under international law are, in any event, the same, *i.e.*, that rejection of the payment offer is not a waiver of the right to monies owed and that Peru's offer did not fully cover the EDI's costs. Therefore, the Tribunal deems it relevant to refer to the discussion in the section on expropriation under the BIT, where the merits of this claim are discussed in detail (*infra*, paras. 758 *et seq.*).\n\nClaimants' Memorial, paras. 372-377, 562-565.\n\nClaimants' Reply, paras. 802-826.\n\n518.\n\nIn any event, the Tribunal considers that the non-payment for the EDI does not amount to a breach of contract. According to the Concession Contract, the delivery of the EDI was among the obligations that the Concessionaire had to perform in order to receive remuneration for its work.\n\n519.\n\nCompensation sought for this item only arises in connection with the early termination of the Contract, so that it is appropriate for the EDI to be compensated as part of the \"*general expenses*\" incurred by Kuntur Wasi, in accordance with Clause 15.4.3 of the Concession Contract.\n\n520.\n\nAccordingly, the Tribunal rejects this claim on the grounds that Peru did not breach the Concession Contract by failing to pay for the EDI. This decision is without prejudice to Kuntur Wasi's right to full compensation for the EDI, which is appropriate as an *expense* incurred by the investor in the performance of the Contract improperly terminated by Peru (*infra,* para. 985 (v)b.), and as consequential damage for the violation of the fair and equitable treatment clause under the BIT (*infra,* para. 985 (iv)).\n\n**(7)Peru repudiated the Concession Contract**\n----------------------------------------------\n\n***a. The Parties' Positions***\n-------------------------------\n\n**(i)The Claimants' Position**\n------------------------------\n\n521.\n\nThe Claimants' sixth claim is that Peru repudiated the Contract by announcing \u2013 on various occasions \u2013 that it would not comply with the Contract.639 In particular, the Claimants refer to the following statements made by Peruvian high-ranking officials and public entities, indicating that Peru would not comply with the Concession Contract:640\n\n\u2022 21 May 2017: statement by Minister Vizcarra to the effect that, having considered the Contralor\u00eda's report, the Government would terminate the Concession Contract;641\n\n\u2022 4 June 2017: statement by Minister Giuffra announcing that Kuntur Wasi would not participate in the construction and operation of the Concession;642\n\n\u2022 13 July 2017: Peru's notification to Kuntur Wasi of the unilateral termination of the Concession Contract;643\n\n\u2022 11 September 2017: Peru's repeated refusal to comply with the Concession Contract;644\n\n\u2022 21 December 2017: Peru's request that Kuntur Wasi return the Concession area;645\n\n\u2022 12 January 2018: Peru's reiterated request that Kuntur Wasi return the Concession area;646\n\n\u2022 18 January 2018: Peru's reiterated request that Kuntur Wasi return the Concession area;647 and\n\n\u2022 19 January 2018: Peru's reiterated request that Kuntur Wasi return the Concession area.648\n\nClaimants' Memorial, para. 378.\n\nClaimants' Memorial, para. 379.\n\n**Exhibit C-35**, News article published by Semana Econ\u00f3mica, \"*Aeropuerto de Chinchero: Ejecutivo dejar\u00e1 sin efecto contrato de concesi\u00f3n*, 22 May 2017; **Exhibit C-34**, News clip from Cuarto Poder, \"*Mart\u00edn Vizcarra: 'Chinchero va, pero el Contrato no',*\" 21 May 2017.\n\n**Exhibit C-40**, News article published by El Comercio, \"*Gobierno y Kuntur Wasi acordaron resolver contrato por Chinchero, anuncia Giuffra*,\" 4 June 2017.\n\n**Exhibit C-44**, *Oficio No. 142-2017-MTC/01*, 13 July 2017.\n\n**Exhibit C-149**, *Oficio No. 3703-2017-MTC/25*, 11 September 2017.\n\n**Exhibit C-82**, *Oficio No. 5379-2017-MTC/25*, 21 December 2017.\n\n**Exhibit C-86**, *Oficio No. 200-2018-MTC 25*, 12 January 2018.\n\n**Exhibit C-48**, *Oficio No. 010-2018-EF/CE-36*, 18 January 2018.\n\n**Exhibit C-125**, *Oficio No. 020-2018-MTC/12*, 19 January 2018.\n\n522.\n\nThese statements also meant that Peru put itself in a position of default in relation to all of its obligations under the Concession Contract, which in turn allowed Kuntur Wasi to terminate the Concession Contract for breach.649\n\nClaimants' Memorial, para. 380.\n\n**(ii)The Respondent's Position**\n---------------------------------\n\n523.\n\nThe Respondent asserts that it did not repudiate the Contract by announcing that it would not comply with its terms (*i.e.*, in relation to termination of the Contract or the non-payment of the US$40 million Advance Payment); rather, Peru unilaterally terminated the Concession Contract in a legitimate exercise of its contractual rights.650\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, para. 222.\n\n524.\n\nSecondly, the Respondent further argues that some of the acts of repudiation alleged by the Claimants are post-termination. In the Respondent's view, it would be illogical and unreasonable for the Claimants to expect that the MTC would make the US$ 40 million Advance Payment provided in Addendum No. 1 after the *Contralor\u00eda* had determined the terms of Addendum No. 1 were not consistent with Peruvian law, and the MTC had terminated the Contract.651\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, para. 223.\n\n***b. The Tribunal's Analysis***\n--------------------------------\n\n525.\n\nThe Claimants allege that Peru repudiated the Contract by announcing it would not honour the agreement. Further, the Claimants assert that pursuant to Article 1333.3 of the Peruvian Civil Code, whenever a debtor states that it will not perform its duties, such debtor becomes *ipso facto* in default.\n\n526.\n\nThe Respondent contends that the MTC never stated that it would not comply with its contractual obligations, but rather terminated the Contract in accordance with the requirements established in the Concession Contract and Peruvian law. The Respondent also asserts that the other examples used by the Claimants to assert an alleged repudiation of the Contract occurred after the termination. In this regard, the Respondent explains that Peru could not have repudiated a Contract that was already terminated.\n\n527.\n\nRepudiation occurs when a debtor clearly and expressly states that it will not honour its obligation. Even if it is an Anglo-Saxon instrument (*repudiatory breach*), the hypothesis of repudiation has progressively been incorporated to traditional civil law systems and instruments of comparative law. Nonetheless, application of repudiation under Peruvian law has been subject to controversy in this proceeding. According to Dr. Ferrando, repudiation \"is not a term of legal nature embraced by the relevant Peruvian laws.\"652 Thus Dr. Ferrando states that the Claimants use this term colloquially simply to say that the MTC refused to comply with the Contract.\n\n**Exhibit RER-2**, First Ferrando Gamarra Report, para. 195. [Tribunal's translation] The original Spanish reads: \"\u2026*no es un t\u00e9rmino de naturaleza jur\u00eddica que se encuentre en las normas peruanas relevantes.*\"\n\n528.\n\nKuntur Wasi did not comment on this point in its Reply Memorial, nor through the Peruvian law experts who issued reports on its behalf. The only legal support for the claim would be Article 1333.3 of the Peruvian Civil Code, which provides as follows:\n\n*A debtor shall be in default as from the date on which creditor requests, in court or otherwise, fulfilment of the former's obligation. A demand is not required for debtor to be in default: (\u2026)3. Whenever debtor informs in writing it is unwilling to perform an obligation.653*\n\n[Tribunal's translation] The original Spanish reads: \"*Incurre en mora el obligado desde que el acreedor le exija, judicial o extrajudicialmente, el cumplimiento de su obligaci\u00f3n. No es necesaria la intimaci\u00f3n para que la mora exista: (\u2026)3.- Cuando el deudor manifieste por escrito su negativa a cumplir la obligaci\u00f3n.*\"\n\n529.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, under this provision \"Peru is in default, giving rise to Kuntur Wasi's right to validly terminate the Concession Contract.\"654\n\nClaimants' Memorial, para. 380. [Tribunal's translation] The original Spanish reads: \"... *tiene por efecto constituir a Per\u00fa en incumplimiento, generando el derecho en Kuntur Wasi de resolver v\u00e1lidamente el Contrato de Concesi\u00f3n.*\"\n\n530.\n\nThe Tribunal interprets the transcribed rule as offering a default mechanism for cases that are usually considered in comparative law as a repudiation of the contract (\"unwillingness\"). However, this rule does not permit an *inference* of future non-performance from the debtor's actions or circumstances. Indeed, this is a restricted hypothesis: \"whenever the debtor informs in writing it is unwilling to perform*\".*\n\n531.\n\nUpon an analysis of the events in which the Peruvian Government would have allegedly announced that it was unwilling to honour the Concession Contract, the Tribunal concludes that the requirements for application of said rule are not met.\n\n532.\n\nThe first event alleged by Kuntur Wasi is the notice and exercise of the termination clause. The Tribunal considers that Contract termination does not mean *informing an unwillingness to perform*. On the contrary, Peru stated repeatedly that it was terminating the Concession Contract based on a contractual prerogative.655 The fact that this Tribunal has concluded that exercise of such prerogative was improper does not prove *repudiation* of the Concession Contract, but rather a *breach* thereof. In other words, the assumption contravenes the purpose of the instrument under analysis, which implies projecting in advance the future breach of the debtor. Where the debtor has already breached, termination is an effective mechanism to protect the creditor's interests. This is the mechanism that was exercised by Kuntur Wasi.\n\n**Exhibit C-148**, *Oficio N\u00b0 3562-2017-MTC*, 31 August 2017, **Exhibit C-149**, *Oficio No. 3703-201-MTC/25*, 11 September 2017.\n\n533.\n\nAnother basis to assert an alleged refusal by the Peruvian Government to comply with the Concession Contract would be its reluctance to deliver the Amount of the Advance Payment. In this regard, the Claimants refer to Official Notices Nos. 3562-2017-MTC/25 and 3703-2017-MTC/25 dated 31 August 2017 and 11 September 2017, respectively. In the first of these official letters, the MTC stated that \"the reiterated demand for the delivery of the Amount of the Advance Payment upon termination of the suspension makes no sense, since the MTC has unilaterally terminated the Contract by letter dated 13 July 2017, which termination shall be effective on 13 January 2018.\"656 In the second official letter, the MTC merely reiterated that it disagreed with Kuntur Wasi's position.657\n\n**Exhibit C-148**, Oficio N\u00b0 3562-2017-MTC, 31 August 2017, p. 2. [Tribunal's translation] The original Spanish reads: \"...*la insistencia en el pago del Valor de Adelanto al momento en que se levante la suspension carece de l\u00f3gica, por cuanto el MTC ha declarado la caducidad unilateral del Contrato mediante carta del 13 de julio del 2017, caducidad que se producir\u00e1 el 13 de enero de 2018.\"*\n\n**Exhibit C-149**, *Oficio No. 3703-2017-MTC/25*, 11 September 2017.\n\n534.\n\nIn the Tribunal's opinion, Official Letter No. 3562-2017-MTC/25 is the most relevant evidence to assert a potential repudiation of the Concession Contract by Peru. Indeed, even if the termination had been validly exercised, it would only be effective as of January 2018, as stated in the Concession Contract. However, such evidence is not enough to assert that Peru repudiated the Contract. As concluded above, the obligation to deliver the amount of the Advance Payment was not enforceable, because Kuntur Wasi never provided the applicable Guarantee. In addition, the Official Letter No. 3562-2017-MTC/25 does not express an intention to disregard the Contract, but a confirmation that it would be in force until a certain date according to its own provisions. Therefore, such document does not meet the requirements set forth in article 1333.3.\n\n535.\n\nFinally, the request for the return of the Concession area does not amount to a repudiation of the Concession Contract, either. Indeed, in the first request, dated 21 December 2017, the MTC urged Kuntur Wasi to kindly return possession of the area to the Peruvian Government as soon as possible, and in any event, no later than on the expiration date.658 In the following communications Peru merely reiterated the request for the return of the Concession area as of 13 January 2018, the date on which, in its opinion, the Concession Contract would terminate.659 Everything indicates that the return request prior to termination was made by calling upon a voluntary act of the Concessionaire. The remaining requests, although erroneous, were made on the basis of the contractual provisions and not in denial of the agreement.\n\n**Exhibit C-82**, *Oficio* No. 5379-2017-MTC/25, 21 December 2017.\n\n**Exhibit C-86**, *Oficio* No. 200-2018-MTC 25, 12 January 2018; **Exhibit C-48**, *Oficio No. 010-2018-EF/CE-36*, 18 January 2018; **Exhibit C-125**, *Oficio No. 020-2018-MTC/12*, 19 January 2018.\n\n536.\n\nAccordingly, the Tribunal rejects the allegation of repudiation of the Concession Contract. As explained, Article 1333 of the Peruvian Civil Code contemplates a restricted hypothesis of repudiation, under which a debtor may be held in default provided there is an express intention not to perform. In this case, the statements by the Peruvian Government referred to by the Claimants do not meet the requirement set forth in said article.\n\n**(8)Peru breached the Concession Contract by failing to observe the Guarantee Agreement**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n***a. The Parties' Positions***\n-------------------------------\n\n**(i)The Claimants' Position**\n------------------------------\n\n537.\n\nAs explained above, at the time the Concession Contract was signed, Kuntur Wasi and the MTC also signed a Guarantee Agreement.660 The Claimants argue that the fact that performance of the Concession Contract was guaranteed through the Guarantee Agreement meant that the State extended sovereign protections (\"*protecciones soberanas*\")in favor of the investor.661\n\nClaimants' Memorial, paras. 399, 400; Respondent's Counter-Memorial, para. 230.\n\nClaimants' Memorial, para. 400.\n\n538.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, \"the Concession Contract, through the Guarantee Agreement, is protected and shielded, to the maximum extent possible, against any action of public entities contrary to the provisions agreed upon, even against an act of the Congress of the Republic, *i.e.*, the ultimate expression of the sovereign power of the State.\"662 In this respect, the Claimants appear to rely on the nature of the Guarantee Agreement as a \"*Contrato Ley*,\" which according to the Claimants, is meant to protect investors against political risks in order to attract investment.663\n\nClaimants' Memorial, para. 402. [Tribunal's translation] The original Spanish reads: \"*el Contrato de Concesi\u00f3n goza, mediante el Contrato de Garant\u00eda, de la m\u00e1xima protecci\u00f3n y blindaje frente a cualquier actuaci\u00f3n de cualquier entidad p\u00fablica que pretenda ir en contra de lo pactado, incluso frente a una ley del Congreso de la Rep\u00fablica, que es la m\u00e1xima expresi\u00f3n del poder soberano estatal.\" In this respect, the Claimants appear to rely on the nature of the Guarantee Contract as a \"Contracto Ley.*\"\n\nClaimants' Memorial, paras. 402-404.\n\n539.\n\nThe concept of \"Contratos Ley\" is set out in Article 62 of the Peruvian Constitution, according to which: \"[b]y means of contract-law agreements (contratos-ley), the State may issue guarantees and grant assurances. These agreements may not be amended by legislative act\u2026\"664 The Claimants argue that the Contratos Ley are a domestic system for the protection of investments because they allow freezing the fiscal, exchange rate, labor and non-discrimination legislation, among others, and guarantee all of the terms of a contract against any contrary action by the State.665 According to the Claimants, given the nature of the Guarantee Agreement as a *Contrato Ley*, the Guarantee Agreement has at least three effects in this case:\n\n\u2022 it reinforces the State's compromise that it will comply with the obligations under the Concession Contract. Notably, this commitment is undertaken by the Peruvian State itself and not merely through some public entities;666\n\n\u2022 it implies that the State is responsible not only for any breaches of the Concession Contract, but also for any acts in the exercise of its sovereign capacity that are contrary to the terms of the Concession Contract. In other words, the State cannot \"hide\" behind its \"sovereign capacity\" to justify a failure to comply with the Contract.667\n\n\u2022 it means that State can be brought to arbitration for any breach of the Guarantee Agreement resulting from any acts of the State. This is, in the Claimants' view, precisely the reason why Clause 3 of the Guarantee Agreement establishes that disputes in relation thereto are subject to arbitration pursuant to Clause 16 of the Concession Contract.668\n\nClaimants' Memorial, para. 404; **Exhibit CL-23**, Constituci\u00f3n Pol\u00edtica del Per\u00fa, 1993, art. 62.

The Guarantee Agreement also does not and cannot prevent other Peruvian entities such as the *Contralor\u00eda* or the *Fiscal\u00eda* from exercising their legal powers and acting within their competence.672\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, para. 232; **Exhibit RER-2**, First Ferrando Gamarra Report, paras. 205-207*.*\n\n543.\n\nIn any event, on the Respondent's case, since the MTC did not breach the Concession Contract (either by terminating the Concession Contract, by refusing to pay the advance payment, by using the EDI or by demanding the return of the Airport Land), it has likewise not breached the Guarantee Agreement.673\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, para. 233.\n\n***b. The Tribunal's Analysis***\n--------------------------------\n\n544.\n\nThe Parties disagree as to the nature of the Guarantee Agreement and the effects that the qualification of the Guarantee Agreement has on the case. The Claimants argue that this document is a Contract-Law (\"*Contrato-Ley\"*), which would have the effect of shielding or reinforcing the Peruvian State's commitment to comply with the obligations secured therein. In particular, this would imply that (i)all public entities, in addition to the Grantor, would be bound by the Concession Contract; (ii)public entities should refrain from exercising state powers that would result in the breach of the obligations under the Concession Contract; and (iii)the arbitration prescribed in the Concession Contract would be applicable to the Peruvian State. Meanwhile, in the Respondent's view, the document would simply guarantee the MTC's compliance with the representations and obligations of the Concession Contract.674\n\nClaimants' Memorial, paras. 404 *et seq.*; Respondent's Counter-Memorial, paras. 230, 232.\n\n545.\n\nThe Tribunal finds the Respondent's position on this issue not convincing. The Guarantee Agreement is a contract entered into pursuant to Article 1357 of the Peruvian Civil Code, which provides that \"by law, supported by reasons of social, national or public interest, guarantees and assurances may be granted by the State by means of contract.\" In this case, execution of the Guarantee Agreement was authorized by Supreme Decree 185-2014-EF.675 The obligations under the Guarantee Agreement must be different from the obligations under the contract secured. Otherwise, it would make no sense to assume an obligation already undertaken. Precisely, the purpose of a guarantee is to create an additional obligation that secures performance of a duty.\n\n**Exhibit C-49**, Guarantee Agreement, Whereas, Cl. 1.13.\n\n546.\n\nThe purpose of the Guarantee Agreement is stipulated in Clause 2.1:\n\n*Under this Guarantee Agreement, the STATE secures in favour of THE CONCESSION COMPANY, the representations, warranties and obligations of the Grantor established in the CONCESSION CONTRACT. This guarantee is not a financial guarantee.676 [Tribunal's translation]*\n\nThe original Spanish reads: \"*En virtud del presente CONTRATO DE GARANT\u00cdA, EL ESTADO garantiza A LA SOCIEDAD CONCESIONARIA, las declaraciones, seguridades y obligaciones del Concedente establecidas en el CONTRATO DE CONCESI\u00d3N. Esta garant\u00eda no constituye una garant\u00eda financiera.*\"\n\n547.\n\nThe scope of this guarantee was studied by both Parties' experts on Peruvian law. Eduardo Benavides, for the Claimants, argued that the Guarantee Agreement is a Contract-Law (\"*Contrato-Ley\"*), by which Peru waived \"the right to exercise acts under the legal power of the State (Ius Imperium), throughout the execution of the contract, that might be contrary to the obligations and guarantees contained in such contract.\"677 In practice, by virtue of the Guarantee Agreement, the Concession Contract \"is mandatory and binding upon all the entities of the Peruvian State\" and prevents amendment of its provisions by an act of the Government.678\n\n**Exhibit CER-7**, Benavides Torres Report, Conclusion 1, p. 4.

[Tribunal's translation] The original Spanish reads: \"\u2026*obliga y vincula a todas las entidades del Estado Peruano.*\"\n\n548.\n\nEnrique Ferrando, on behalf of the Respondent, argued that the Guarantee Agreement ensures appropriate performance of the Concession Contract, and awards reinforced protection to the investments in the design, financing, construction, operation and maintenance of the airport.679 In particular, Dr. Ferrando stated that the guarantee provided to the Concession Contract ensures that \"its provisions will not be affected by direct actions that amend or alter the originally agreed contractual terms.\"680\n\n**Exhibit RER-2**, First Ferrando Gamarra Report, para. 211.\n\n**Exhibit RER-2**, First Ferrando Gamarra Report, para. 208. [Tribunal's translation] The original Spanish reads: \"\u2026*sus disposiciones no se ver\u00e1n afectadas por intervenciones directas que modifiquen o alteren las condiciones contractuales originalmente pactadas.\"*\n\n549.\n\nThe experts agree that the Guarantee Agreement conveys immutability to the terms of the Concession Contract. The Tribunal agrees with the Claimants that this translates into the following consequences: (i)the Peruvian State\u2014not just the MTC\u2014undertook to observe the provisions of the Contract; and (ii)State entities committed to limit the exercise of their public powers, in consideration of the rights and obligations contained in the Concession Contract. Therefore, the exercise of a public power by any entity of the Peruvian Government contrary to the Concession Contract, would imply in turn a breach of the Guarantee Agreement.\n\n550.\n\nIn this case, the Tribunal has held that the MTC breached the Concession Contract by terminating such Contract without a reason of public interest that justified the decision (*supra*, para. 427). To the extent that the MTC is a State agency, this breach also involves a violation of the Guarantee Agreement, because the latter was binding on the Peruvian State as a whole.\n\n551.\n\nWith regard to other breaches attributed by the Claimants to entities other than the MTC, the Tribunal confirms its previous findings. The Tribunal determined that it was the MTC and not any other state agency that breached the Concession Contract. The reasons to determine the Respondent's compliance in these other claims are outlined in the respective sections. In each case, the Tribunal has considered the Guarantee Agreement executed and has determined whether the Peruvian State acted in accordance with its contractual obligations.\n\n552.\n\nAccordingly, the Tribunal concludes that the MTC's violation of the Concession Contract was at the same time a violation by the Peruvian Government of the Guarantee Agreement. As both violations were attributable to the same State agency, the breach of the Guarantee Agreement has no additional consequences in practice for the purposes of assigning liability under Peruvian law. This finding does not change the effects derived from the violation of the Guarantee Agreement for the purposes of assigning liability to the Peruvian Government under international law (*infra*, para. 733).\n\n**(9)Peru acted with** ***dolo*** **and** ***culpa inexcusable***\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n***a. The Parties' Positions***\n-------------------------------\n\n**(i)The Claimants' Position**\n------------------------------\n\n553.\n\nThe Claimants further claim that Peru breached the Concession Contract wilfully \u2013 because it knew that it was breaching its commitments and nevertheless, pursued conduct that was inconsistent with the Contract \u2013 and with gross negligence, because Peru did not use the minimum level of diligence required by Peruvian law.681\n\nClaimants' Memorial, para. 422.\n\n554.\n\nArticle 1138 of the Peruvian Civil Code establishes that \"a person who deliberately fails to perform an obligation is guilty of wilful misconduct *(\"dolo\"),*\" without any need to show the intention to harm.682 Article 1319 of the Peruvian Civil Code establishes that somebody acts with inexcusable negligence (\"*culpa inexcusable*\")if it \"negligently fails to perform an obligation.\" *Culpa inexcusable* or gross negligence is the highest degree of negligence and implies a disregard for the most basic duties and obligations.683\n\nClaimants' Memorial, para. 423, citing **Exhbit CL-34**, Osterling, Felipe, *Las Obligaciones*, Lima: Editora Jur\u00eddica Grijley, Octava Edici\u00f3n, 2007, pp. 239, 240.\n\nClaimants' Memorial, para. 438.\n\n555.\n\nIn this case, the Claimants argue that the the Respondent wilfully breached the Concession Contract by unilaterally terminating it despite knowing that the termination was not valid. In particular, the Claimants fault the the Respondent for terminating the Contract despite knowing that: (i)Kuntur Wasi had not breached the Contract; (ii)Addendum No. 1 had been validly signed; and (iii)there was no public interest that could justify the termination of the Contract.684 According to the Claimants, the reports of 13 July 2017 on which the the Respondent relies for its position that there was a public interest justifying the termination of the Concession Contract, prove the Claimant's case. In the Claimant's view, none of these reports conclude that it was in the public interest to terminate the Concession Contract, let alone did they recommend that the MTC terminate it.685\n\nClaimants' Memorial, para. 426, 427.\n\nClaimants' Reply, paras. 547 *et seq*.\n\n556.\n\nThe Claimants also argue that Peru knew that \u2013 through its actions \u2013 it had created in Kuntur Wasi the legitimate expectation that the Project would be executed under the terms of Addendum No. 1; and that, by unilaterally terminating the Concession Contract, Peru wilfully breached those legitimate expectations.686\n\nClaimants' Memorial, paras. 431, 432.\n\n557.\n\nLikewise, the Claimants argue that Peru knew that it had to make the Advance Payment and that, even if the Contract had been validly terminated, the obligations under the Contract would remain in force until the issuance of a final award, and despite that knowledge, Peru wilfully refused to make the Advance Payment.687\n\nClaimants' Memorial, para. 433-435.\n\n558.\n\nNot only did Peru know that its actions were contrary to the Concession Contract, but it also knew that those actions would cause harm to Kuntur Wasi. This is, in the Claimants' view, evidenced by Minister Vizcarra's statement to the effect that, in case of termination, the State would have to pay compensation to Kuntur Wasi.688\n\nClaimants' Memorial, para. 436; **Exhibit C-33**, *Respuestas al pliego interpelatorio de 83 preguntas formuladas por los Congresistas de la Rep\u00fablica en relaci\u00f3n al proyecto Aeropuerto Internacional de Chinchero \u2013 Cusco*, 18 May 2017, p. 24.\n\n559.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, the Respondent also acted with gross negligence when it terminated the Concession Contract without any supporting public interest reasons; without providing any reasoning whatsoever; without indicating which \"problem\" the termination was intended to solve; and despite the Guarantee Agreement.689 Through these actions, Peru also failed to act with the slightest diligence required by the law governing public-private partnerships, according to which, when confronted with two alternatives, the State must always choose the one that would allow the project to be executed and which promotes the investment.690\n\nClaimants' Memorial, paras. 441, 444, 446; Claimants' Reply, paras. 554 *et seq*.\n\nClaimants' Memorial, para. 442.\n\n560.\n\nFinally, the Claimants allege that, under Peruvian law, the characterization of a breach as wilful or as resulting from gross negligence has two consequences: (i)contractually agreed limitations on the amount of compensation are automatically void and therefore, inapplicable; (ii)the non-breaching party has a right to be compensated for unforeseeable damages caused by the breach.691\n\nClaimants' Memorial, paras. 448-454, citing, among others, art. 1328 and art. 1321 of the Peruvian Civil Code.\n\n**(ii)The Respondent's Position**\n---------------------------------\n\n561.\n\nThe Respondent denies acting with *dolo* or *culpa inexcusable*. The Respondent's case is that it did not breach the Contract by unilaterally terminating it, and therefore, there is no *dolo*. However, in the Respondent's view, even if the Tribunal were to find that the termination was inconsistent with the Contract, the MTC's actions were not wilful.692\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, para. 210; **Exhibit RER-2**, First Ferrando Gamarra Report, paras. 218-220.\n\n562.\n\nAccording to Dr. Ferrando, under Peruvian law, for there to be *dolo*, there has to be a breach and an intention to breach.693 The Respondent asserts that the Claimants have failed to show that the MTC acted with deliberate intention to breach the Contract. In particular, the Respondent takes issue with all three facts that \u2013 on the Claimants' case \u2013 indicate the MTC's deliberate action: that the MTC knew that Kuntur Wasi had not breached the Contract; that Peru knew that Addendum No. 1 had been validly executed; and that there was no public interest justification to unilaterally terminate the Contract).694\n\n**Exhibit RER-2**, First Ferrando Gamarra Report, paras. 218-20.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, paras. 211, 212.\n\n563.\n\nFirst, the Respondent argues that the reason for the termination of the Contract was Kuntur Wasi's failure to submit a reasonable financial package that would not cause an economic prejudice to the State. Secondly, the fact that Addendum No. 1 was signed in accordance with Peruvian law does not indicate that it would not be subject to the *Contralor\u00eda'*s review and that, following the *Contralor\u00eda\u00b4s* unfavorable views, it would not be terminated by the MTC. Third, according to the Respondent, the only way to fulfil the State's public interest in building the Chinchero Airport was to terminate the Contract because Kuntur Wasi had proven to be an unreliable partner.695\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, para. 212.\n\n564.\n\nThe Respondent also denies that the MTC acted with gross negligence by failing to identify a public interest reason for terminating the Concession Contract, for the same reasons.696\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, para. 214.\n\n***b. The Tribunal's Analysis***\n--------------------------------\n\n565.\n\nThe Claimants argue that the Peruvian Government allegedly engaged in wilful misconduct or gross negligence based upon three grounds: (i)by unilaterally terminating the Concession Contract in the knowledge that there was no valid reason for such termination; (ii)by frustrating Kuntur Wasi's legitimate expectations that the Project would be executed in accordance with Addendum No.1; and (iii)by failing to deliver the Advance Payment. In Clalimants' opinion, the Peruvian Government was aware that these actions were contrary to the Concession Contract and would damage Kuntur Wasi.\n\n566.\n\nThe Tribunal has found that Peru breached the Concession Contract by failing to comply with the requirements set forth in Clause 15.5.1 for termination thereof. With respect to the other claims mentioned in the preceding paragraph, the Tribunal has found that Peru acted in accordance with its duties under the Concession Contract. Accordingly, the analysis of the allegations of wilful misconduct or gross negligence will be limited to the only event that amounts to a breach of contract as stated in the Decision.\n\n567.\n\nArticles 1318 and 1319 of the Peruvian Civil Code define wilful misconduct (\"*dolo*\")and gross negligence (\"*culpa grave*\"), respectively. With respect to the former, the law provides that \"a person who deliberately fails to perform an obligation is guilty of wilful misconduct.\" As for the latter, the law provides that \"inexcusable negligence is incurred by those who, due to gross negligence, do not execute an obligation.\"\n\n568.\n\nIn the civil law tradition, also in force in Peru, both wilful misconduct and gross negligence require a high standard of proof.697 Wilful misconduct requires proof that the subject acted *deliberately*, which requires producing evidence showing the subjectivity of the contracting party at the time of the breach. Although wilful misconduct does not always entail an intention to harm the counterparty, it carries the heavy burden of proving that the breach was committed consciously.\n\n**Exhibit RER-2**, First Ferrando Report, para. 220.\n\n569.\n\nMeanwhile, proof of gross negligence essentially operates objectively, contrasting a standard of care with the debtor's actions. The party alleging gross negligence must go beyond the mere presumption of negligence associated with the breach of contract, and must show what the applicable minimum standard of care was and how the debtor deviated from it.\n\n570.\n\nThe Claimants base their allegation of wilful misconduct or gross negligence on the termination of the contractual relationship, contending that the Peruvian State was aware that (i)Kuntur Wasi had not breached the Contract, (ii)Addendum No.1 had been validly executed and (iii)there was no reason of public interest justifying the termination of the Contract.\n\n571.\n\nIn the Tribunal's opinion, none of these arguments suffice to prove that the Respondent engaged in wilful misconduct or gross negligence. With respect to the former, it is undisputed that at the time of termination Peru did not consider that Kuntur Wasi had breached the Concession Contract. If that had been the case, Peru would have given notice of termination in accordance with Clause 15.3, which governs the events for termination attributable to the Concessionaire's fault. The Peruvian State opted, instead, to terminate the Concession Contract in accordance with Clause 15.5, which does not govern termination upon the Concessionaire's breach but upon a well-founded reason of public interest. Thus, according to the provisions of the Contract, the State was authorized to terminate the contractual relationship, even if there was no breach by the Concessionaire. In other words, the fact that Kuntur Wasi had not defaulted does not mean, *per se*, that the Concession Contract was terminated through wilful misconduct or gross negligence.\n\n572.\n\nTerminating the Concession Contract even if Addendum No. 1 was valid does not amount to wilful misconduct or gross negligence by Peru, either. Although the Respondent contested the validity of Addendum No. 1, the evidence produced in this arbitration has demonstrated that during the effective term of the contractual relationship, the MTC and the MEF acted on the understanding that Addendum No. 1 was valid and that the *Contralor\u00eda*'s recommendations were not binding (*supra,* paras. 378 *et seq*.). The efforts made by the MTC to amend Addendum No. 1 responded to a legitimate interest to find a solution that would be satisfactory to the supervising authority.698 Kuntur Wasi agreed with this (*supra,* paras. 487, 488). Thus, the Tribunal does not find a thoughtless or reckless disregard of Addendum No. 1 by the MTC, but rather an attempt to adapt the terms of the agreement to the recommendations issued by the *Contralor\u00eda*.\n\nMinister Giuffra Statement: \"From the outset, I tried to look for a way out, regardless of the Controller's proposals. Perhaps, we could find an option D accepted by the Comptroller's Office.\" (Transcript, Day 5 (English), 1016:19-22).\n\n573.\n\nLastly, Kuntur Wasi asserts that there was wilful misconduct or gross negligence because there was no valid reason justifying the termination pursuant to Clause 15.5 of the Concession Contract. According to Kuntur Wasi, none of the 13 July 2017 reports, on which the Respondent based its decision to terminate the Concession Contract, state that such termination was a matter of public interest. And Kuntur Wasi further alleges that the Peruvian State did not provide any reasons at all for the termination and failed to indicate the problem intended to be solved with termination. Nor did the Peruvian Government display the minimum duty of diligence required by the PPP Law, which provides to always opt for the alternative that allows for the execution of the Project and promotes private investment.\n\n574.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees with the Claimants in that the Peruvian Government did not provide a well-founded reason of public interest to lawfully terminate the Contract pursuant to the terms of Clause 15.5. Hence, the Tribunal held that Peru breached the Concession Contract. However, this circumstance does not prove that Peru engaged in wilful misconduct or gross negligence.\n\n575.\n\nGross negligence requires proof that the behaviour displayed by the debtor reveals an unusual lack of care, that demonstrates factual and reckless disregard for the interest of the other party.\n\n576.\n\nPeru's actions were clumsy or negligent with regard to Kuntur Wasi. This is evidenced by the MTC's actions: announcing the termination shortly after subscribing the Renegotiation Proposal; failing to carefully consider Kuntur Wasi's request for six months to secure financing; or deciding to terminate the Contract in spite of the fact that other entities recommended that the terms of the Project be adapted. However, these circumstances do not represent an extreme hypothesis of wilful misconduct or gross negligence.\n\n577.\n\nAlthough Peru has been unable to prove that Kuntur Wasi was a deficient contracting party to carry out the Project and that, therefore, early termination was a matter of public interest, the State did indeed establish that it engaged in an active search for a solution allowing for the execution of the Project under terms conforming to both the framework in force and the interests of the investor. When the Parties were unable to achieve the Financial Closing, Peru proposed the execution of Addendum No. 1. When the *Contralor\u00eda* warned that Addendum No. 1 was potentially unlawful, Peru encouraged the renegotiation of the financial terms one more time. These circumstances show there was no such intention of Peru to harm Kuntur Wasi or gain personal benefits at the expense of the latter, but rather find a solution that would be mutually acceptable to the Parties. To conclude, even if Peru breached the Concession Contract (as it did), the Tribunal dismisses the allegation that in so doing, Peru has engaged in wilful misconduct or gross negligence.\n\n**(10)Peru's actions caused damage to the image, honour and good reputation of Kuntur Wasi and its shareholders**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n***a. The Parties' Positions***\n-------------------------------\n\n**(i)The Claimants' Position**\n------------------------------\n\n578.\n\nThe Claimants' last claim under Peruvian law is that the Respondent has damaged Kuntur Wasi's constitutionally protected rights to \"image, reputation and honour.\"699 According to the Claimants, this constitutional right is linked to the concept of dignity and protects the social reputation in society of natural or legal entities against false accusations.700 Therefore, any act that causes humiliation, that is disrespectful or that otherwise implies the dissemination of lies, or that negatively affects a person's reputation in society, is a violation of the right to \"image, reputation and honor,\" and as such, gives rise to moral damages.701\n\nClaimants' Memorial, para. 381.\n\nClaimants' Memorial, paras. 382-386.\n\nClaimants' Memorial, para. 387.\n\n579.\n\nThe Claimants argue that Kuntur Wasi's shareholders are companies with high standing in the region and in the world. In this sense, the Claimants point out that Corporaci\u00f3n Am\u00e9rica is the greatest private airport operator in the world, with 52 airports in Latin America, Europa and Eurasia, and with more than 20 years' experience in the field; and Andino is a Peruvian entity with a long-standing record, which trades on the Stock Exchange of Lima.702 The Claimants further argue that, when the Concession was awarded, Peru itself spoke to Kuntur Wasi's experience.703 And when Addendum No. 1 was signed, President Kuczinski emphasized Corporaci\u00f3n Am\u00e9rica's experience and good reputation.704\n\nClaimants' Memorial, paras. 388, 389.\n\nClaimants' Memorial, para. 390.\n\nClaimants' Memorial, para. 392.\n\n580.\n\nYet the good reputation of Kuntur Wasi, its officials and its shareholders has been severely affected since 2017 because of Peru's actions.705 In particular, the Claimants take issue with two actions taken by Peru, which, on the Claimants' case, have damaged their reputation:\n\n\u2022 Peru's decision to open criminal investigations against Kuntur Wasi's and Andino's officials for having signed the Concession Contract and Addendum No. 1. According to the Claimants, the *Fiscal\u00eda* has initiated investigations on the basis of abstract allegations and without clear indication of the facts that support opening an investigation for collusion.706 In the Claimants' view, the decision to open criminal investigations was \"arbitrary\" and \"contrary to the norms of civilized nations.\"707 The Claimants further argue that, even if some of the criminal investigations against Kuntur Wasi and its employees have been dismissed, one continues and, in any event, the Peruvian State must pay for the damage caused by opening unfounded investigations that had significant media attention and were arbitrary.708\n\n\u2022 The termination of the Concession Contract itself will have a negative effect on Corporaci\u00f3n Am\u00e9rica's prospects for securing another airport concession in the future. That is because most tender procedures require bidders to confirm whether a government has ever cancelled one of their concession contracts in the past. Peru's unjustified and arbitrary decision therefore poses a risk to Corporaci\u00f3n Am\u00e9rica.709 The termination has also had a negative impact on Mr. Balta \u2013 Kuntur Wasi's former General Manager \u2013 who explains that he lost his job as a result of the termination and will find it hard to find another job in Peru.710\n\nClaimants' Memorial, para. 393.\n\nClaimants' Memorial, paras. 394, 656-661.\n\nClaimants' Memorial, para. 655.\n\nClaimants' Reply, paras. 165 *et seq*.\n\nClaimants' Memorial, para. 397, 662.\n\nClaimants' Memorial, para. 398; citing **Exhibit CWS-1,** First Jos\u00e9 Balta Statement, para. 74.\n\n581.\n\nThese actions justify, on the Claimants' case, the award of moral damages.711\n\nClaimants' Memorial, para. 665.\n\n**(ii)The Respondent's Position**\n---------------------------------\n\n582.\n\nThe Respondent does not deny that the *Fiscal\u00eda* opened preliminary investigations against the Claimants' representatives as a result of the *Contralor\u00eda*'s findings about Addendum No. 1. However, the Respondent's case is that the preliminary investigation was not baseless or designed to harass the Claimants.712\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, para. 148.\n\n583.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, because the *Fiscal\u00eda* is the general prosecutor in Peru, if it receives a complaint that a possible crime has been committed and believes it to be at least plausibly substantiated, it has a duty to initiate preliminary investigations.713 In this case, the *Fiscal\u00eda* received a request from the MTC to investigate whether any possible criminal activities had been associated with Addendum No. 1 and, given the seriousness of the issue and the significance of the Project for Peru, the *Fiscal\u00eda* prudently opened a preliminary investigation. This was not, as the Claimants suggest, a targeted discriminatory action against Kuntur Wasi or Corporaci\u00f3n Am\u00e9rica. Rather, the preliminary investigations extended to everyone involved with the Addendum.714\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, para. 148.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, para. 149.\n\n584.\n\nThe Respondent further argues that Kuntur Wasi and its shareholders have been afforded due process and have availed themselves of their due process rights through local court proceedings to narrow the investigation. And, in any event, the investigation by the *Fiscal\u00eda* never moved beyond preliminary status (neither Kuntur Wasi's nor Corporaci\u00f3n Am\u00e9rica's representatives were ever indicted)and in the end, it was closed in January 2020.715\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, para. 149, 400.\n\n585.\n\nTherefore, according the Respondent, even if the Claimants' allegations were true (*i.e.*, that the criminal investigations were not justified), the Claimants have failed to explain how a preliminary investigation that: (i)did not involve the arrest or detention of anyone; (ii)was conducted in accordance with due process of law; and (iii)has ultimately been dropped, is comparable to an abusive physical or emotional harm that would be needed to be proved to claim moral damages.716\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, para. 400.\n\n586.\n\nWith respect to the Claimants' allegation that the termination of the Contract has resulted in reputational loss, the Respondent contends that the Claimants' claim is highly speculative, as the Claimants did not present any evidence of bids where this issue has been raised. Furthermore, according to the Respondent, the alleged reputational loss would in no event support a finding of moral damages because, if the Tribunal finds in favor of the Respondent, then the Respondent acted consistently with its obligations under the Contract and international law, and the Claimants have no cause for complaint. If, on the other hand, the Tribunal finds in favor of the Claimants, then the Tribunal will have recognized their complaints either with respect to the termination of the Contract or the State's treatment of the Claimants or their investments.717\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, para. 401.\n\n587.\n\nFinally, the Respondent contends that an award of moral damages requires far more than merely showing that an investor's \"reputation\" was harmed by the State, both under international law and Peruvian law. As a matter of international law, the Respondent emphasizes that in the rare instances where moral damages have been awarded, there has been egregious conduct and severe physical harm, and not a mere showing of impact on reputation.718 As a matter of Peruvian law, the Respondent argues that moral damages are only available to companies to the extent that they prove that their commercial reputation \u2013 not that of their employees \u2013 was impaired by illegal conduct against the company itself, and that the Claimants have not proven such an allegation in this case. In any event, Peruvian law is only relevant for the Claimants' contract law claims, not for its treaty-based claims.719\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, paras. 400-404.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, para. 406, citing **Exhibit RER-2**, First Ferrando Gamarra Report, paras. 250-258, 261.\n\n***b. The Tribunal's Analysis***\n--------------------------------\n\n588.\n\nThe Claimants contend that Peru breached the Concession Contract, the Guarantee Agreement and Peruvian law as it damaged \"the image, honour and good reputation of Kuntur Wasi and the latter's shareholders and officers.\" To support this claim, the Claimants explain in three different sections that (1)Peruvian law embraces the right of legal entities to good reputation, (2)Kuntur Wasi had built good reputation, and (3)Peru damaged such good reputation.\n\n589.\n\nThe Tribunal understands that Kuntur Wasi has, as any legal person, fundamental rights such as the right to one's honour and good name. Indeed, as the Claimants allege, these are rights established for all persons in general by the Constitution of Peru, as has been expressly recognized by the Constitutional Court.720\n\n**Authority CL-26**, *Expediente N\u00b0 0905-2001-AA/TC*, legal ground 7, 14 August 2002; Claimants' Memorial, para. 384, footnote 469.\n\n590.\n\nThe Respondent does not object this conclusion but adds certain considerations that it submits should be taken into account to determine whether a claim for damage to a legal person's reputation is admissible. Among these considerations, the Respondent affirms that (i)the harmful behaviour must be particularly serious,721 (ii)damage has to be claimed exclusively by the party harmed,722 and (iii)moral damages claimed by a legal person require a financial prejudice.723\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, para. 395.\n\n**Exhibit RER-2**, First Ferrando Gamarra Report, paras. 250, 251.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, para. 406.\n\n591.\n\nWith regard to the first consideration, the Tribunal rejects the assertion that an action that causes moral damage for which compensation may be sought shall necessarily imply physical harm or illegal detention.724 To arrive at this conclusion, the Respondent thoroughly examines prior decisions issued by tribunals ruling in cases of disputes between States and investors, but this claim was filed under contract-law provisions. Therefore, the merits of the claim shall be determined in light of the provisions stipulated in the Concession Contract and, failing that, Peruvian law. Pursuant to Peruvian law, the requirements applicable to compensation of moral damages are the same as those applicable to property losses, thus a negligent action, even if not gross, suffices to amount to an unlawful act.725\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, para. 395.\n\n**Exhibit RER-2**, First Ferrando Gamarra Report, para. 252.\n\n592.\n\nThe second consideration is that moral damages may only be claimed by the harmed party. In this respect, the Tribunal agrees. Indeed, moral damage, such as any compensable damage, is personal. This means that, save for a few exceptional cases such as succession by inheritance or the transfer of a business, the action for damages shall be brought exclusively by the harmed party. Legal standing to sue lies solely in the victim to seek redress.\n\n593.\n\nTherefore, the Tribunal finds that the claims for damage to the honour and reputation of Kuntur Wasi based on the criminal investigations against the company's officers are not admissible. In fact, any criminal investigation initiated against an individual and the ultimate communication (\"*formalizaci\u00f3n*\")thereof, would only provide legal standing to such individual to sue for any possible harm (monetary or otherwise)derived from an unfounded or abusive proceeding. On the contrary, such an investigation does not provide standing to sue for damage to the person's own attributes to a business represented by those officers because as a matter of fact, the business has not sustained any harm.726\n\n**Exhibit RER-2**, First Ferrando Gamarra Report, para. 250, 251.\n\n594.\n\nFinally, the Respondent asserts that a claim for moral damages by a legal person requires a financial prejudice. In this regard, Dr. Ferrando explains that: \"the reputation of legal persons is not an inherent quality. [\u2026] Therefore, damage to reputation translates into lost revenue resulting from damage to the firm's name. If this loss does not exist, there is no moral damage.\"727\n\n**Exhibit RER-2**, First Ferrando Gamarra Report, para. 253. [Tribunal's translation] The original Spanish reads: \"*\u2026la reputaci\u00f3n de las personas jur\u00eddicas no es una cualidad inherente a estas. [\u2026] Por consiguiente, el da\u00f1o a la reputaci\u00f3n se manifiesta a trav\u00e9s de una merma de los ingresos de la persona jur\u00eddica derivados del da\u00f1o reputacional. Si esa merma no existe, no hay da\u00f1o moral.*\"\n\n595.\n\nEven if the Tribunal disagrees with this allegation, it cannot ignore that the Claimants did not dispute that this was a requirement of any action for moral damages. On the contrary, the Claimants argued that the harm to their reputation did in fact have financial consequences. In this regard, the Claimants affirmed that this damage would have negative consequences for Corporaci\u00f3n Am\u00e9rica in future bids for other airports.728 Furthermore, Mr. Vargas stated that the politicization of the conflict and the criminal investigations would have allegedly damaged Andino's financial system and would have allegedly even resulted in the suspension of several other projects until this case is resolved.729\n\n**Exhibit CWS-2**, First Barrenechea Statement, para. 60.\n\n**Exhibit CWS-6**, Second Vargas Loret de Mola Statement, para. 10.\n\n596.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the possible monetary damages alleged under these statements cannot be sustained with respect to Kuntur Wasi. As noted earlier in relation to jurisdiction, this company was incorporated for the exclusive purpose of carrying out the construction and operation of the Chinchero Airport.730 Therefore, its bidding in other tenders could not be affected as there would be none. Likewise, the alleged monetary damages of Andino are irrelevant, since Kuntur Wasi does not have legal standing to sue for damages sustained by its shareholders, *i.e.,* different legal entities.\n\n**Exhibit C-17**, Constitutive Documents of Kuntur Wasi, 11 June 2014, Chapter I \"Corporate name, purpose, registered office and duration\", Article 2: \"The purpose of the company shall be solely and exclusively the exercise of the rights and the performance of the obligations under the concession contract for the design, financing, [\u2026] operation and maintenance of the new Chinchero-Cuzco International Airport (AICC).\" [Tribunal's translation] The original Spanish reads: \"*La sociedad tiene por objeto dedicarse \u00fanica y exclusivamente al ejercicio de los derechos y obligaciones relativos al contrato de concesi\u00f3n para el dise\u00f1o, financiamiento, [\u2026] operaci\u00f3n y mantenci\u00f3n del nuevo aeropuerto de internacional de Chinchero-Cusco (AICC).*\"\n\n597.\n\nLastly, it is noted that this claim, which has been submitted as a contractual claim in the proceeding,731 was filed by Kuntur Wasi and not by Corporaci\u00f3n Am\u00e9rica. Even assuming that this is a general claim of both Claimants, no evidence has been presented to prove the possible negative consequences for Corporaci\u00f3n Am\u00e9rica in future bids. The fact that this damage was actually sustained was merely asserted in the memorials by reference to the statement of the Chief Executive Officer of Corporaci\u00f3n Am\u00e9rica.732 This contention does not suffice to establish a financial loss that is certain and resulting from the harm to Corporaci\u00f3n Am\u00e9rica's reputation.\n\nClaimants' Memorial, p. 113.\n\nClaimants' Memorial, para. 397; Claimants' Reply, para. 956. Both paragraphs refer to **Exhibit CWS-2**, First Barrenechea Statement, para. 60.\n\n598.\n\nIn conclusion, the Tribunal rejects the claim for damage to Kuntur Wasi's honour and reputation. First, because the criminal investigations against the company's officers do not provide legal standing to sue to Kuntur Wasi as if it were the company's own damage. Second, there is no evidence of financial loss sustained by Kuntur Wasi resulting from the alleged damage to the firm's honour or reputation.\n\n**B. Alleged breaches under the BIT and International Law**\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n599.\n\nThe Claimants assert that the BIT has been breached in five respects by the conduct of the Respondent: first, by the Respondent's failure to provide fair and equitable treatment to their investment, as required by Article 2(3)of the BIT, first sentence (Section B.(1)); second, by the Respondent's unjustified conduct in violation of the second sentence of Article 2(3)of the BIT (same); third, by the Respondent's expropriation of the Concession Contract and the EDI, in violation of Article 4(2)of the BIT (Section B.(2)); fourth, by the Respondent's failure to provide legal security for their investment, as required by Article 4(1)of the BIT (Section B.(3)); and finally, by the Respondent's contractual breaches, actionable under the BIT by virtue of its MFN clause, Article 3(1), through which an umbrella clause from another treaty can be imported (Section B.(4)). The first two claims will be considered together since they involve the different and overlapping aspects of the same BIT provision.\n\n**(1)Article 2(3)of the BIT**\n-----------------------------\n\n***a. The Parties' Positions***\n-------------------------------\n\n**(i)The Claimants' Position**\n------------------------------\n\n600.\n\nThe Claimants' first claim under the BIT is that the Respondent acted in an inconsistent, contradictory and arbitrary manner towards the Claimants, in breach of Article 2(3)of the BIT.733 This Article reads as follows:\n\n*Each Contracting Party shall ensure at all times a fair and equitable treatment of the investments of investors of the other Contracting Party, and shall not prejudice their management, maintenance, use, enjoyment, or disposition through unjustified or discriminatory measures.*734\n\nClaimants' Memorial, para. 468.\n\n**Exhibit C-50**, Per\u00fa-Argentina BIT, art. 2(3). This is an English translation provided at para. 239of Respondent's Counter-Memorial. The Spanish original of art. 2(3)of the BIT reads: *\"Cada Parte Contratante asegurar\u00e1 en todo momento un tratamiento justo y equitativo a las inversiones de inversores de la otra Parte Contratante, y no perjudicar\u00e1 su gesti\u00f3n, mantenimiento, uso, goce o disposici\u00f3n a trav\u00e9s de medidas injustificadas o discriminatorias.*\"\n\n601.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, Article 2(3)of the BIT sets out two independent obligations which required the Respondents to: (i)provide the Claimants' investment with fair and equitable treatment at all times (the \"**positive obligation to provide FET**\"); and (ii)abstain from adopting \"unjustified and discriminatory\" measures affecting the management, maintenance, use, enjoyment or disposition (\"*gesti\u00f3n, mantenimiento, uso, goce o disposici\u00f3n*\")of the Claimants' investments (the \"**negative obligation of Article 2(3)**\").735\n\nClaimants' Memorial, para. 470.\n\n602.\n\nIn the Claimants' view, albeit independent, these two obligations are closely related: by definition, unjustified treatment would lead to a breach of the fair and equitable treatment standard (whereas a breach of fair and equitable treatment does not require showing that the State's conduct was unjustified or discriminatory).736 In this case, however, the Claimants argue that Peru's conduct is both unjustified and arbitrary, and thus contrary to both aspects of this Article.\n\nClaimants' Memorial, para. 471. The Claimants rely on caselaw supporting that unjustified and discriminatory conduct by the State inform the analysis of breach of FET (*see*, Claimants' Memorial, footnote 537).\n\n***(a)The standard of Article 2(3)of the BIT***\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n603.\n\nThe Claimants, while acknowledging that the BIT does not define the content of its FET standard, rely on prior caselaw indicating that FET protects investors' legitimate expectations against conduct that is arbitrary, discriminatory, lacking transparency, consistency or coherence.737 According to the Claimants, the BIT's FET standard offers investors an \"ample and flexible\" protection, which seeks to assure investors that, among other things, they will be treated \"fairly\" considering all circumstances and will not be \"harmed\" by the State.738\n\nClaimants' Memorial, paras. 472-474, relying in particular on the decision in **Exhibit CL-77**, C*rystallex International Corporation v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/11/2, para. 543.\n\nClaimants' Memorial, paras. 472, 473.\n\n604.\n\nThe Claimants emphasize that \u2013 contrary to the Respondent's suggestion \u2013 the BIT's FET standard is autonomous from the customary international law minimum standard of treatment.739 In the Claimants' view, the BIT's FET obligation sets out an objective standard, which does not require showing that the State acted with bad faith or that the State deliberately breached the BIT.740\n\nClaimants' Reply, paras. 588-599.\n\nClaimants' Memorial, paras. 473, 603 *et seq*.\n\n605.\n\nFinally, the Claimants assert that the Tribunal must look at the cumulative effect of a State's measures in order to determine whether there has been a breach of fair and equitable treatment, rather than analyze each measure individually and in isolation.741\n\nClaimants' Memorial, para. 475.\n\n606.\n\nOn the basis of the above standard, the Claimants argue that Peru's conduct fell short of FET for the following reasons: Peru's actions were inconsistent or contradictory (subsection (b)); Peru acted arbitrarily and without justification (subsection (c)); and Peru contravened the Claimants' legitimate expectations (subsection (d)).\n\n***(b)Inconsistency or contradictory conduct***\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n607.\n\nRelying on *Saluka v.

Contradictions over Kuntur Wasi's EGP**\n--------------------------------------------\n\n608.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, Peru acted in a contradictory manner when it first issued favorable opinions in relation to Kuntur Wasi's financial proposal, only to later reject the EGP without any justification.751 In particular, Kuntur Wasi refers to:\n\n\u2022 OSITRAN's report of 20 July 2016, in which OSITRAN concluded that the documents submitted by Kuntur Wasi for the EGP approval \"comply with the provisions of the Concession Contract\" [Tribunal's translation] (\"*se ajustan a las disposiciones del Contrato de Concesi\u00f3n\"*)*;*752 and OSITRAN's subsequent opinion, of 22 July 2016, approving Kuntur Wasi's EGP;753\n\n\u2022 The *Contralor\u00eda* report of 27 October 2016 and the CAF report, of 7 November 2016, both of which recommended only that the MTC should renegotiate the amount of the quarterly PAO, but did not recommend terminating the Concession Contract;754 and\n\n\u2022 Peru's notification to Kuntur Wasi of 25 November 2016, in which the MTC rejected Kuntur Wasi's 4 May 2016 EGP without any reasoning other than to say that the EGP \"would cause an economic prejudice to the Grantor\" [Tribunal's translation] (\"*generar\u00eda un perjuicio econ\u00f3mico al Concedente*\").755\n\nClaimants' Memorial, para. 482.\n\nClaimants' Memorial, para. 484, citing **Exhibit C-114**, *Informe No. 014-16-GRE-GAJ-OSITRAN*, 20 July 2016, paras. 228, 231.\n\nClaimants' Memorial, para. 484; **Exhibit C-21**, *Oficio Circular No. 039-16-SCD-OSITRAN*, 22 July 2016.\n\nClaimants' Memorial, para. 485; **Exhibit C-22**, *Oficio No. 4268-2016 MTC/25*, 27 de octubre de 2016, (the MTC sent the report of the *Contralor\u00eda* to Kuntur Wasi on 27 October 2016); **Exhibit C-23**, *Reporte de Conclusiones y Recomendaciones*, CAF, 7 November 2016, p. 23.\n\nClaimants' Memorial, para. 486; **Exhibit C-67**, *Oficio No. 4601-2016-MTC*, 25 November 2016.\n\n609.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, the Respondent admits that any contradictions between OSITRAN and the MTC in relation to the EGP became moot because Addendum No. 1, which replaced the previous financing structure, was approved. On the Claimants' case, this is precisely the reason why any justification for termination of the Concession Contract because Kuntur Wasi \"gamed the system\" is moot. However, it does not eliminate the inconsistency.756\n\nClaimants' Reply, para. 690; citing the Respondent's Counter-Memorial, para. 258.\n\n**ii. Contradictions in relation to the negotiations leading to Addendum No. 1**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n610.\n\nOn the Claimants' case, Peru also acted in a contradictory manner during the negotiation of Addendum No. 1. In particular, the Claimants argue that the MTC sent Kuntur Wasi two proposals to amend the Concession Contract, and once Kuntur Wasi had accepted one of them and sent a draft on the basis of such proposal (which also incorporated the MTC's, the CAF's and the *Contralor\u00eda's* recommendations), the MTC rejected it. The MTC then sent a third proposal which completely changed the financing mechanism of the Project, which ultimately became Addendum No. 1.757\n\nClaimants' Memorial, paras. 488, 489, relying on: **Exhibit C-61**, Email from Yaco Rosas (MTC)to Jos\u00e9 Carlos Balta del Rio (Kuntur Wasi), 22 October 2016; **Exhibit C-62**, Letter No. 183-2016-KW, 28 October 2016; **Exhibit C-63**, *Oficio No. 4362-2016-MTC/25*, 7 November 2016; **Exhibit CWS-1**, First Jos\u00e9 Balta Statement, para. 30; **Exhibit C-64**, Email from Yaco Rosas (MTC)to Jos\u00e9 Carlos Balta del Rio (Kuntur Wasi), 9 November 2016. Claimants' Reply, paras. 633 *et seq*.\n\n**iii. Contradictions in relation to Addendum No. 1**\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n611.\n\nThe Claimants argue that Peru contradicted itself when it first promoted, supported, and finally signed Addendum No. 1 to bring the Project forward, and then later unilaterally and without reasoning, terminated the Concession Contract.758 According to the Claimants, after Peru changed the economic structure of the Concession Contract, all the competent Peruvian entities, including OSITRAN, MEF, and the MTC, and high-ranking Government officials (including President Kuczynski)approved Addendum No. 1.759 These public manifestations of support continued even after Addendum No. 1 was signed, as evidenced by Minister Vizcarra's appearance before the Congress as late as in May 2016 to defend its benefits, among other actions.760\n\nClaimants' Memorial, para. 490; Claimants' Reply, paras. 639 *et seq*.\n\nClaimants' Memorial, paras. 491-493.\n\nClaimants' Memorial, para. 494; **Exhibit C-33**, *Respuestas al pliego interpelatorio de 83 preguntas formuladas por los Congresistas de la Rep\u00fablica en relaci\u00f3n al proyecto Aeropuerto Internacional de Chinchero \u2013 Cusco*, 18 May 2017, pp. 15, 16.\n\n612.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, despite the \"repeated, continued and consistent\" support shown by Peru in relation to the benefits of Addendum No. 1, by the end of February 2017, Peru started to change its position. The change began on 22 February 2017, when the *Contralor\u00eda* issued a report finding that there was a potential risk that Kuntur Wasi could use the Advance Payment for a different purpose than to commence the construction works, and was followed by the *Contralor\u00eda's* report of 19 May 2017, which concluded that Addendum No. 1 breached certain regulations.761 On 21 May 2017, three days after supporting Addendum No. 1 in Congress and the day before renouncing his post, Minister Vizcarra appeared on television to communicate that the Government would terminate (\"*dejar sin efecto*\")the Concession Contract as modified by Addendum No. 1.762 According to the Claimants, Minister Vizcarra's announcement was telling, in that it spoke in terms of the termination of the Concession Contract and not just the Addendum No. 1, despite the fact that the *Contralor\u00eda's* reports only referred to Addendum No.1.763\n\nClaimants' Memorial, para. 495, 496.\n\n**Exhibit C-120**, News clip from Buenos D\u00edas Per\u00fa, \"*Vizcarra sobre Chinchero: Decidimos dejar sin efecto contrato que desde el inicio parti\u00f3 mal*,\" 22 May 2017.\n\nClaimants' Memorial, para. 497.\n\n613.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, the Respondent's only argument in relation to these contradictions is that the public statements in support of Addendum No. 1 came from individuals who do not bind the Peruvian State. On the Claimants' case, however, those statements are binding on Peru pursuant to Article 4 of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility, as they were issued by organs of the State, and in particular, by the President, the Council of Ministers or the Ministers themselves.764\n\nClaimants' Reply, paras. 645, 646.\n\n**iv. Contradictions in relation to the termination of the Concession Contract**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n614.\n\nIn the Claimants' view, Peru also acted in a contradictory manner when it terminated the Concession Contract: first, Minister Vizcarra appeared before Congress on 18 May 2017 to support Addendum No. 1 and said that there was no public interest reason that would justify terminating the Contract; secondly, only three days later, Minister Vizcarra appeared before television to announce that the Government would terminate the Concession Contract; thirdly: on 23 May 2017, President Kuczynski announced that Peru would not terminate the Concession Contract, but would seek to agree on amendments; fourthly, despite the President's announcement and the fact that the Parties were in the middle of negotiations, on 4 June 2017, Minister Giuffra publicly announced that the Government and Kuntur Wasi had reached a mutual agreement to terminate the Concession Contract and the MTC published an official statement to that effect; and finally, on 13 July 2017, Minister Giuffra declared the unilateral termination of the Concession Contract.765\n\nClaimants' Memorial, paras. 501-504; Claimants' Reply paras. 661 *et seq*.\n\n**v. Contradictions in relation to the existence of public interest reasons for the termination**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n615.\n\nThe Claimants further argue that Peru's conduct was contradictory as to the reasons for the termination of the Concession Contract. While Peru first represented that Addendum No. 1 was adopted precisely to guarantee that the public interest would be upheld, because it would allow to provide the city of Cuzco with adequate airport infrastructure in the near term, a few months later, it said the exact opposite.766\n\nClaimants' Memorial, paras. 507, 508; Claimants' Reply, paras. 668 *et seq*.\n\n**vi. Contradictions in relation to the Trato Directo**\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n616.\n\nFinally, the Claimants assert that Peru's conduct was also contradictory in relation to the negotiations that took place after the termination of the Concession Contract. In particular, the Claimants allege that while Peru showed interest in engaging in negotiations with Kuntur Wasi (and even asked for an extension of the deadline for the negotiations), at the same time, it repeatedly requested Kuntur Wasi to return the Concession area.767 The Claimants also take issue with the fact that once Kuntur Wasi returned the Concession area, Peru terminated the *Trato Directo* almost two months before the expiration of the deadline for the negotiations.768\n\nClaimants' Memorial, paras. 510- 513; Claimants' Reply, paras. 677 *et seq*.\n\nClaimants' Reply, para. 677.\n\n617.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, the Respondent did not have a contractual right to seek the return of the Concession area because at the time of the negotiations, the Concession Contract was still in force (pursuant to Article 15.8.7 of the Concession Contract, the effects of the termination would be suspended until an award was issued)and required that the Parties engage in the *Trato Directo* as a prerequisite to the institution of arbitration proceedings (as set out in Clause 16 of the Concession Contract).769\n\nClaimants' Reply, para. 681.\n\n***(c)Arbitrary and unjustified conduct***\n------------------------------------------\n\n618.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, a State also breaches its fair and equitable treatment obligations if it acts in an arbitrary and unjustified manner. In their view, \"arbitrary\" \u2013 adopting Prof. Schreuer's words \u2013 means a situation where the measure in question \"*inflicts damage on the investor without serving any apparent legitimate purpose,*\"770 or a situation which implies an excess of discretion, prejudice or personal preference which causes harm to the investor without any apparent legitimate objective.\"771\n\nClaimants' Memorial, para. 514, citing **Exhibit CL-83**, *EDF (Services)Limited v. Romania*, ICSID Case No. ARB/05/13, Award, 8 October 2009 (hereinafter *EDF v. Romania*), para. 303.\n\nClaimants' Memorial, para. 516 and Reply, para. 694, citing, e.g., **Exhibit CL-83**, *EDF v. Romania*, para. 303; **CL-84**, *Tza Yap Shum v. Republic of Peru,* ICSID Case No. ARB/07/6, Award, 7 July 2011, para. 192.\n\n619.\n\nThe Claimants argue that, in this case, the termination of the Concession Contract should have been sufficiently reasoned, at least for three reasons. First, because the obligation to provide the reasoning supporting public decisions affecting an investment is set out in international law as developed by case law (relying on the case law cited above). Secondly, because Clause 15.5.1 of the Concession Contract requires that unilateral termination be based on \"well-founded reasons of public interest\" (\"*razones de inter\u00e9s p\u00fablico debidamente fundadas*\"); and thirdly, because Peruvian administrative law requires that every public decision must be \"well-founded\" (\"*debidamente motivad[a]*\")and \"suit the public interest objective\" (\"*adecuarse a las finalidades de inter\u00e9s p\u00fablico*\").772 [Tribunal's translation]\n\nClaimants' Memorial, paras. 518-520, citing **Exhibit CL-4**, D*ecreto Supremo 004-2019-JUS, Texto \u00danico Ordenado de la Ley del Procedimiento Administrativo General*.\n\n620.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, the MTC's communication of 13 July 2017, notifying Kuntur Wasi of the termination of the Concession Contract, is neither grounded on public interest reasons, nor does it contain any reasoning:773\n\n(i)Contrary to what the MTC says in the communication, Peru itself had recognized previously that there was in fact no public interest reason supporting the termination of the Concession Contract. In support of this allegation, the Claimants point to Minister Vizcarra's appearances before the Congress, in which he affirmed that \"[a]s a State we did not have tools to terminate this Contract\"774 and that \"to declare reasons of public interest requires sound grounds and the signature of several Ministers. Undoubtedly, if such reasons existed, such clause could be invoked; in the case of the \"Chinchero\" Airport there was no way to configure such legal issue\" [Tribunal's translation];775\n\n(ii)There is in fact no public interest reason that would support the termination of the Concession Contract. To the contrary, building the Chinchero Airport is in the public interest. Terminating the Concession Contract would only delay the construction of the Project (in fact, the works would have begun almost three years after the moment when Kuntur Wasi would have started the works, had the Contract not been terminated)and to increased costs;776\n\n(iii)The MTC's communication of 13 July 2017 does not contain any reasoning: it did not explain why continuing with the Project with Kuntur Wasi would pose a problem in relation to the public interest, nor why terminating the Concession Contract would in fact solve that problem. The communication only contains vague statements that are not related to the specific circumstances (*i.e.*, stating that the termination is \"more in line (\"*m\u00e1s acorde*\")with the public interest)and false statements. In particular, the Claimants take issue with the MTC's statement that it would no longer be possible to carry out the Project, arguing that Kuntur Wasi was both able and willing to carry out the Project.777\n\n(iv)Peru's decision to terminate the Concession Contract is not based on any technical opinion. According to the Claimants, while it is true that Addendum No. 1 was subject to a process in which OSITRAN, the MEF and the MTC issued opinions; none of these entities recommended the termination of the Concession Contract.778 The Claimants also point out that the Respondent expressly admitted that the MTC's decision to terminate was based on Minister Giuffra's own personal \"discretion\" and \"belief\" that Kuntur Wasi would not be able to complete the Project;779 and that the 13 July 2017 reports issued by the MINCETUR and the MTC which allegedly informed the MTC's decision, do not state that it was in the public interest to terminate the Concession Contract, let alone do they recommend such action.780\n\nClaimants' Memorial, paras. 523, 524; Claimants' Reply, paras. 711 *et seq*.\n\n**Exhibit C-117**, Video of Minister Mart\u00edn Vizcarra before the *Comisi\u00f3n Permanente del Congreso*, *Congreso de la Republica del Per\u00fa*, 9 February 2017, minute 30.27 onwards.

In the Claimants' view, it was irrational for Peru to conclude that the State's best interest lay in terminating the Concession Contract even if it were correct that Kuntur Wasi had said it needed six additional months as the Respondent alleges, especially considering the costs associated with the termination.781\n\nClaimants' Reply, paras. 721-728.\n\n622.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, Peru's arbitrary conduct constitutes a breach of the fair and equitable obligation as well as a breach of Peru's separate obligation to abstain from adopting unjustified measures that negatively affect investments (as set out in Article 2(3)of the BIT). In the Claimants' view, this obligation requires that Peru abstain from any conduct that causes a \"negative economic impact\" on the investments.782\n\nClaimants' Memorial, paras. 532-534.\n\n***(d)Legitimate expectations***\n--------------------------------\n\n623.\n\nFinally, the Claimants also argue that the protection of an investor's legitimate expectations is a key component of the fair and equitable treatment obligation.783 Relying on previous case law, the Claimants suggest that the BIT protects against State conduct that \"affect the basic expectations that were taken into account by the foreign investor to make the investment*.*\"784 As to the source of legitimate expectations, the Claimants argue that they can arise from the State's representations or undertakings, whether explicit or implicit.785\n\nClaimants' Memorial, paras. 538, citing *inter alia*: **Exhibit CL-87**, Rudolf Dolzer, *Fair and Equitable Treatment: Today's Contours*, 12 Santa Clara J.

Peru's conduct created legitimate expectations**\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n625.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, Peru created, through the following conduct, the legitimate expectation of the Claimants that they would be able to carry out and operate the Project for a certain period of time and that Peru would only unilaterally terminate the Concession Contract for well-founded public interest reasons:787\n\n1. Law No. 27528,788 which declared that the Chinchero Airport was a public interest project;\n\n2. Emergency Decree No. 039-2010 that declared that the Chinchero Airport was of \"national necessity and its execution was a priority in the year;\"789 [Tribunal's translation]\n\n3. Supreme Decree No. 059-96-PCM,790 which stated that it was in the national interest to promote private investment in the infrastructure sector; and the Law on Public-Private Partnerships, which declared it to be of \"national interest the promotion of private investment through Public-Private Partnerships*;*\"791 [Tribunal's translation]\n\n4.

The Concession Contract, which established that the only reason Peru could unilaterally terminate the Contract was for \"well-founded reasons of public interest\" (\"*razones de inter\u00e9s p\u00fablico debidamente fundadas*\"), and the Guarantee Agreement, through which Peru guaranteed all of the MTC's representations and obligations under the Concession Contract;793\n\n6.

According to the Claimants, their expectation was that they would be able to continue with the Project under the terms and conditions set out in Addendum No. 1.795 The Claimants also argue that investment treaty tribunals have consistently held that legitimate expectations can arise from contracts with the State,796 and that in this case, their legitimate expectations were created through the Concession Contract itself; the factual circumstances surrounding the Concession Contract; as well as the Guarantee Agreement, which reinforced the obligations contained in the Concession Contract.797\n\nClaimants' Reply, paras. 739, 740.\n\nClaimants' Reply, paras. 743-746.\n\nClaimants' Reply, paras. 748, 755.\n\n627.\n\nThe Claimants also take issue with the Respondent's argument that legitimate expectations could not be derived from the Concession Contract because the construction of the Project was subject to further approvals and actions (such as obtaining the financial closure and approval by the MTC). According to the Claimants, their expectations were precisely that *if* the conditions and requirements set out in the Contract were fulfilled, they would be able to build and operate the Chinchero Airport. In other words, the Claimants argue that the Contract was the framework that governed the relationship between the Parties and that it expected that Peru would comply with it.798\n\nClaimants' Reply, paras. 750 *et seq*.\n\n628.\n\nFinally, in response to the Respondent's argument that the Claimants could not derive any legitimate expectations from Addendum No. 1 because it was approved *after* the Claimants had already invested in Peru, the Claimants argue that Addendum No. 1 effectively modified the Concession Contract, that it was proposed by the State itself and that Kuntur Wasi could have rejected it. Furthermore, the Claimants also assert that after Addendum No. 1 was adopted, they continued to make investments in Peru through the resources spent to be able to perform the Concession Contract.799\n\nClaimants' Reply, paras. 757, 758.\n\n**ii. The Claimants' relied on those legitimate expectations**\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n629.\n\nSecondly, the Claimants argue that they relied on the legitimate expectations generated by Peru's conduct. In particular, the Claimants explain that, in reliance on the above mentioned legislative and administrative acts, the following actions were taken:800\n\n(i)Corporaci\u00f3n Am\u00e9rica and Andino created the Kuntur Wasi consortium with the specific purpose of participating in the tender process;\n\n(ii)Kuntur Wasi participated in the tender process and drafted the required technical and economic proposals;\n\n(iii)Once the Concession Contract was signed, Kuntur Wasi invested millions of dollars to comply with all its obligations under the Concession Contract (including obtaining permits, licenses, the preparation of the EDI and the Financial Closing); and\n\n(iv)Kuntur Wasi also engaged in the renegotiation of Addendum No. 1 and participated, in good faith, in the renegotiation to amend the entire Concession Contract.\n\nClaimants' Memorial, paras. 549, 550.\n\n**iii. Peru breached the Claimants' legitimate expectations**\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n630.\n\nFinally, the Claimants assert that all their legitimate expectations were destroyed when Peru unilaterally terminated the Concession Contract on 13 July 2017. From that moment, the Claimants lost all their rights to the Project without receiving any compensation from the State.801\n\nClaimants' Memorial, para. 551.\n\n631.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, the Respondent's argument that the Claimants are trying to assert legitimate expectations that the *Contralor\u00eda* would not exercise its legitimate competence to review Addendum No. 1 is a misrepresentation. The Claimants argue that their case is not whether the *Contralor\u00eda* could review the Addendum, but rather whether\n\nthe State had sufficient public interest reasons to deprive the Claimants of their legitimate expectations.802\n\nClaimants' Reply, para. 772.\n\n**(ii)Respondent's Position**\n-----------------------------\n\n***(a)The standard of Article 2(3)of the BIT***\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n632.\n\nThe Respondent appears to agree with the Claimants that Article 2(3) establishes two independent obligations, but submits that there is substantial overlap between them, such that the negative obligation related to unjustified measures is subsumed within the FET obligation.803\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, para. 240.\n\n633.\n\nThe Respondent alleges that \u2013 contrary to the Claimants' suggestion \u2013 the FET standard under international law does not require the State to provide an investor with perfect fairness or equity, and thus, not every act that could possibly be labelled somewhat \"unfair\" constitutes a breach of the Treaty.804 Relying on the decisions in *Waste Management v. Mexico* and *Genin v. Estonia*, the Respondent argues that for a finding of breach of FET, the Claimants would have to establish that the acts of the State show \"wilful neglect of duty, an insufficiently of action falling far below international standards, or even subjective bad faith\";805 or that the State's actions that are \"arbitrary, grossly unfair, unjust or idiosyncratic, is discriminatory [\u2026] involves a lack of due process leading to an outcome which offends judicial propriety \u2013 as might be the case with a manifest failure of natural justice in judicial proceedings or a complete lack of transparency and candour in an administrative process.\"806\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, para. 240, 241.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, para. 241, citing, *inter alia*, **Exhibit RL-23**, *Alex Genin, Eastern Credit Limited, Inc. and A.S. Baltoil v. Republic of Estonia*, ICSID Case No. ARB/99/2, Award, 25 June 2001 (hereinafter, *Genin v. Estonia*), para. 367.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, para. 242, citing **Exhibit RL-25**, *Waste Management, Inc. v. United Mexican States*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/00/3, Award, 30 April 2004 (hereinafter, *Waste Management II v. Mexico*), para. 98. (Emphasis omitted).\n\n634.\n\nIn the Respondent's view, although some of these quotes referred to the \"minimum standard of treatment\" under public international law, the BIT's FET standard is largely the same as the minimum standard under CIL.807 In any event, the Respondent argues that the debate as to whether these two standards are the same is futile because it does not dispute that the BIT's FET standard contains protection against State conduct that is arbitrary, unjustified or contravenes legitimate expectations. As will be further developed below, what the Respondent opposes is that the scope and content of the FET standard (including the one in the BIT)protects investors against \"mere inconsistency (without more).\"808\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, para. 241; Respondent's Rejoinder, para. 324.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, para. 325.\n\n635.\n\nOn the basis of the above, the Respondent denies that its conduct fell short of FET for the following reasons:\n\n***(b)Inconsistency or contradictory conduct***\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n636.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, tribunals have routinely held that an investor cannot prove a breach of FET simply by labelling certain State acts or statements by State actors as \"inconsistent.\" Rather, tribunals have acknowledged that it may well happen in any functioning government that different arms of the State reach different conclusions of law, fact, or policy within their respective and particular roles and competences in the State's legal framework.809 In the Respondent's view, inconsistency is relevant to FET when framed in terms of \"arbitrary\" or \"unjustifiable acts,\" which implies State conduct fact more severe and reproachable than mere \"inconsistency.\"810\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, paras. 244, 247.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, para. 245.\n\n637.\n\nFurthermore, the Respondent argues that when analyzing whether a State's acts have breached the FET standard, tribunals must consider all the circumstances and \"balance other legally relevant interests,\"811 including its sovereign right to pass legislation and adopt decisions for the protection of its public interest. In other words, according to the Respondent, complaints about inconsistency may be excused where protection of the public interest or other countervailing interests apply, given that investment treaties are not intended to restrain States from enacting and applying *bona fide* laws of general application in the public interest.812\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, para. 246, citing **Exhibit CL-64**, *Lemire v. Ukraine II*, para. 285. *See also* **Exhibit CL-80**, *Saluka v. Czech Republic*, para. 305.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, para. 246; Respondent's Rejoinder, para. 327.\n\n638.\n\nInstead, the Respondent proposes that a State's actions would only breach the FET standard if the claimed inconsistencies violate the existing domestic legal framework, *e.g.,* because the entity is acting outside of its own legal competence and functions, or because the acts complained of were sufficiently egregious so as to be considered arbitrary, in bad faith, or a contravention of legitimate expectations.813 In the case at hand, the Respondent argues that the conduct complained of by the Claimants was either not inconsistent, or entirely justified as a matter of policy and under Peruvian law.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, para. 247-249, 253.\n\n**i. Contradictions in relation to the EGP**\n--------------------------------------------\n\n639.\n\nEven if inconsistency *per se* were an element of FET, in the Respondent's view, there was no contradiction in relation to Kuntur Wasi's EGP. According to the Respondent, the Concession Contract contemplated a two-tiered review process under which, prior to the MTC's review, OSITRAN had to provide an opinion that the financing met certain minimum requirements. This was not, however, a final decision and the MTC was not bound by OSITRAN's decision.814 The Concession Contract granted the MTC the right not to approve Kuntur Wasi's financial proposal if it found that the EGP caused an economic prejudice to the State. In this case, the MTC reviewed the financing proposal and determined that the costs to Peru were substantially higher than anticipated and included additional costs that had not been included in Kuntur Wasi's original bid. On this basis, the MTC rejected the proposal.815\n\nThe Respondent also argues that the CAF's opinion referenced by the Claimants is irrelevant to the question of inconsistency because the CAF is not a government entity or officials (Respondent's Rejoinder, para. 371).\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, para. 256.\n\n640.\n\nFurthermore, each of these entities reviewed the financial proposal for different purposes, in accordance with their legally entrusted duties.816\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, para. 257.\n\n641.\n\nIn any event, even if the opinion of OSITRAN and the MTC's decision were contradictory, the Claimants must be deemed to have waived any complaints related to its initial financial proposal when it signed Addendum No. 1, which amended the financial components of the Contract.817\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, para. 258.\n\n**ii. Contradictions with respect to the negotiation of Addendum No. 1**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n642.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, the fact that the MTC made several proposals during the negotiations of Addendum No. 1 does not evidence any inconsistencies, but rather, merely reflects a normal process of negotiation. It is the Respondent's case that the MTC's proposals were made in good faith during the ongoing negotiations with Kuntur Wasi and ultimately resulted in a freely reached agreement on one of those proposals.818 And in any event, even if Peruvian entities had acted inconsistently, the parties agreed to the terms of Addendum No. 1, which evidences that the Claimants suffered no harm.819\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, para. 259.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, paras. 259, 260.\n\n**iii. Contradictions in relation to Addendum No. 1 and the subsequent termination of the Concession Contract**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n643.\n\nThe Respondent does not deny that several Peruvian entities, including the MTC and the Peruvian President, supported the new financial structure under Addendum No. 1, hoping to move the Project forward. However, the Respondent explains that subsequently, the *Contralor\u00eda* determined \u2013 within the scope of its authority under Peruvian law \u2013 that Addendum No. 1 violated Peruvian law.820\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, paras. 261, 264.\n\n644.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, the *Contralor\u00eda* reached this conclusion while acting in its unique capacity as defender of the fiscal health of the State, entrusted with the role of reviewing whether State actions preserve the Peruvian treasury.821 In this capacity, the *Contralor\u00eda* determined that Addendum No. 1 violated Peruvian procurement law and risked a substantial loss for Peru. The Respondent further explains that the MTC was required by law to follow the recommendations of the *Contralor\u00eda* and its personnel could face official sanctions if they disobeyed the *Contralor\u00eda*, as well as potential personal criminal liability.822 According to the Respondent, the legitimate difference in views between duly authorized State entities (namely the MTC and the *Contralor\u00eda*)does not trigger a violation of the FET provision of the BIT.823\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, para. 262.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, para. 263.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, para. 264.\n\n645.\n\nFinally, the Respondent also disagrees with the Claimants that certain statements \u2013 as opposed to State acts \u2013 bind the Peruvian State. In particular, the Respondent's case is that the public statements made by President Kuczynski, as well as by Minister Vizcarra and a video that the MTC released, are not State acts that can form the basis for an FET claim.824\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, para. 265.\n\n**iv. Contradiction between the contradictions in relation to the public interest supporting the termination of the Contract**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n646.\n\nThe Respondent alleges that there was no contradiction when it first declared that it was in the public interest to continue the Project with Addendum No. 1 and then subsequently declared that it was in the public interest for the State to terminate the Concession Contract. At all times, Peru worked in good faith to try to complete the Project as quickly and at a reasonable cost to the Peruvian public treasury. This was both the reason why the MTC tried to reach a negotiated solution with the Claimants to complete the Project, and also the reason why it terminated the Concession Contract after the *Contralor\u00eda's* report of May 2017.825 By that time, it became clear that the MTC's faith in the Claimants' ability to complete the Project was misplaced (because Kuntur Wasi had yet to obtain financing for the Project even after three years).826\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, para. 266.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, para. 267.\n\n**v. Contradictions in respect of the Trato Directo**\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n647.\n\nFinally, according to the Respondent, there was no contradiction in requesting that Kuntur Wasi return the Concession area to Peru while at the same time continuing to negotiate with Kuntur Wasi. According to the Respondent, the MTC had the right to take back the land as soon as the Concession Contract was terminated under Clause 15.8.1. Contrary to the Claimants' assertion, in January 2018, when the Contract terminated and the MTC requested the return of the Concession area, the termination was not subject to an arbitral proceeding (which under Clause 15.8.7 would have suspended the effects of the termination until an award was issued).827\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, para. 370.\n\n648.\n\nMoreover, there was no barrier to continuing discussions after Kuntur Wasi returned the land because the negotiations at that point were about compensation for the unilateral termination; they were not negotiations about revising the Contract.828\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, para. 268.\n\n***(c)Arbitrary and unjustified conduct***\n------------------------------------------\n\n649.\n\nRelying on the standard for unjustified measures of the *EDF v. Romania* case \u2013 which the Claimants themselves adopt \u2013 the Respondent argues that to prove that unjustified measures harmed the Claimants' investment, there is a \"high bar\" which requires the Claimants to prove, at a minimum, that the measures they identified did not serve \"any apparent legitimate purpose;\" were \"not based on legal standards;\" were \"taken for reasons that are different from those put forward by the decision maker;\" or were \"taken in willful disregard of due process.\"829 As to the term \"arbitrary,\" the Respondent argues that this sets a similarly high bar, which would require proof that the acts are \"opposed to the rule of law;\" constitute a \"willful disregard of due process of law, an act which shocks, or at least surprises, a sense of juridical propriety;\"830 or demonstrates \"an unexpected and shocking repudiation of a policy's very purpose and goals, or otherwise grossly subvert[] a domestic law or policy for an ulterior motive*.*\"831 In the Respondent's view, determining whether an action is arbitrary does not involve judging whether a measure is the \"best response\" to achieve a policy, but rather whether the measure evidences \"manifest impropriety and raises questions about Peru's adherence to \"the rule of law\" itself.832\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, paras. 270, 271, citing **Exhibit CL-83**, *EDF v. Romania*, para. 303.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, para. 272, citing **Exhibit CL-78**, *El Paso Energy International Company v. The Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/03/15, Award, para. 319.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, para. 272, citing **Exhibit RL-34**, *Cargill, Inc. v. United Mexican States*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/05/2, Award, 18 September 2009, at para. 293.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, para. 273.\n\n650.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, the fundamental basis of both of the Claimants' claims for breach of Article 2(3)of the BIT is that Peru terminated the Concession Contract without a proper public interest rationale.833 In the Respondent's view, the MTC terminated the Concession Contract pursuant to the Contract's express provisions and for a public interest reason. Because the MTC merely exercised its contractual right to terminate the Concession Contract, that termination cannot constitute a breach of the BIT.834\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, para. 269.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, para. 238.\n\n651.\n\nOn the facts of the case, the Respondent argues that the Claimants' allegations that Peru acted in an arbitrary and unjustified manner fail for the simple reason that the MTC did in fact justify the termination of the Concession Contract in the public interest.835 In particular, the Respondent argues that the MTC terminated the Concession Contract because it had lost faith that Kuntur Wasi would ever be able to begin, much less complete, construction of the new Chinchero Airport. According to the Respondent, after the *Contralor\u00eda* had issued its 2017 report, the Parties engaged in negotiations once again to bring the Project forward and agreed, on 1 June 2017, on the parameters for another financing structure. They also agreed that if no agreement could be reached under the proposed terms, then the parties would terminate the Contract jointly, by mutual consent. However, the breaking point occurred when, in subsequent discussions, Mr. Vargas informed Minister Giuffra that it would need at least another six months to obtain the financing necessary to proceed with construction. This indicated to the MTC that extended additional delays were inevitable and it also led the MTC to lose faith that Kuntur Wasi would be able to secure the financing needed and complete the Project at all.836\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, para. 274.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, para. 274-276; Respondent's Rejoinder, para. 390.\n\n652.\n\nThus, according to the Respondent, because the Chinchero Airport was an important project in the public interest, the continued delays and Kuntur Wasi's unreliability had become intolerable. Consequently, after having sought confirmation from the relevant divisions of the MTC and from MINCETUR, Peru exercised its contractual right to terminate the Concession Contract in the public interest.837 On the Respondent's case, the MTC and MINCETUR reports supported Peru's decision to terminate because they reiterated the public interest in building the Airport, which, in the MTC's view, could no longer be accomplished with Kuntur Wasi.838 According to Mr. Giuffra, he also received legal advice from outside counsel which confirmed that the Contract could be terminated on this basis.839\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, paras. 277, 278.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, para. 396.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, para. 278.\n\n653.\n\nThe Respondent further argues that the communication sent by the MTC to Kuntur Wasi on 13 July 2017 provided the rationale for the termination in sufficient detail, namely that the MTC needed to construct the high-priority Chinchero Airport and did not believe that Kuntur Wasi would be able to complete the Project.840 Furthermore, while admittedly the explanation for the termination is summarized briefly in the letter, according to the Respondent, Minister Giuffra had already delivered the same message to Mr. Vargas during the meetings in May and June 2017, where he explained that if the Parties could not reach an agreement on the terms for the financing, the Contract would have to be terminated by mutual agreement.841\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, para. 279; Respondent's Rejoinder, para. 392.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, para. 392.\n\n654.\n\nIn response to the Claimants' argument that Minister Vizcarra himself had declared that there was no public interest reason to cancel the Concession Contract, the Respondent alleges that soon after those statements, the *Contralor\u00eda* issued a report declaring that Addendum No. 1 violated Peruvian law. This, together with the fact that the Parties could not renegotiate the financing issue (and the history of the Project, which had been plagued with delays), led Minister Giuffra to terminate the Contract, despite espousing the same public interest in the Project as Minister Vizcarra.842\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, paras. 393, 395.\n\n***(d)Legitimate expectations***\n--------------------------------\n\n655.\n\nFinally, the Respondent also argues that the Claimants' claim for breach of legitimate expectations must fail because the Claimants have not proven what specific, objectively reasonable expectations they developed nor how and when the Claimants directly relied on those expectations in making their investment.843\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, para. 281.\n\n656.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, for a claim for breach of legitimate expectations to succeed, the Claimants would have to prove that the basic expectations (*i.e.*, those that were fundamental to make the decision to invest)were taken into account by the foreign investor to make the investment;844 that those expectations were legitimate and reasonable; and they must have some degree of specificity.845\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, para. 282.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, para. 285; Respondent's Rejoinder, paras. 406 *et seq*.\n\n657.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, although the Claimants identify a series of laws, regulations, decrees, reports, public statements, as well as the Concession Contract and the Guarantee Agreement as sources of their expectations, they only identify two particularized expectations: (i)that Peru would unilaterally terminate the Concession Contract only for reasons of public interest; and (ii)that the Claimants would achieve construction and operation of the Chinchero Airport.846\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, paras. 287, 288.\n\n658.\n\nThe Respondent admits that the first of these expectations can be considered reasonable and legitimate because it is based on the text of the Concession Contract itself. However, according to the Respondent, the Claimants' claim fails because Peru never violated this expectation since, as explained above, the Concession Contract was terminated for a specific public interest reason.847\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, para. 289.\n\n659.\n\nAs to the second expectation, the Respondent argues that it was neither reasonable nor legitimate. According to the Respondent, if the Claimants can lay claim to an \"expectation\" that their endeavor will necessarily succeed, then any government action that creates any barrier to that success will automatically constitute a breach of their \"expectation\" of project success.848\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, para. 290.\n\n660.\n\nFurthermore, the Respondent argues that the Claimants present no documents assessing how they interpreted or formed this purported expectation before they invested in Peru. On the Respondent's case, the Concession Contract could not create the legitimate expectation that the Claimants would be able to construct the Airport, as the Contract indicated that further approval from the State was necessary to proceed with the Project and allowed the State to unilaterally terminate the Contract for public interest reasons.849\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, paras. 291, 292.\n\n661.\n\nMoreover, the Respondent also argues that the Guarantee Agreement could not and did not change any expectations that arose out of the Concession Contract, as the Guarantee Agreement merely reaffirmed the provisions set out in the Concession Contract but did not create any additional rights or alter the provisions of the Concession Agreement that allowed the State to unilaterally terminate it.850\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, para. 293.\n\n662.\n\nFinally, the Respondent argues that the signing of Addendum No. 1, as well as any subsequent reports and statements issued by Peruvian authorities that allegedly \"reinforced\" the Claimants' expectations, are irrelevant because they all occurred several years after Kuntur Wasi invested in Peru (*i.e.*, when the Concession Contract was signed in 2014). And in any event, the Respondent argues, neither Addendum No. 1 nor any of those subsequent statements and reports could have generated any legitimate expectations because any review of the Peruvian legal structure by the Claimants would have shown that the *Contralor\u00eda* had unique and legitimate oversight powers that could be exercised to review Addendum No. 1 to determine whether it complied with Peruvian law.851\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, paras. 294, 295.\n\n***b. The Tribunal's Analysis***\n--------------------------------\n\n**(i)Article 2(3)of the BIT**\n-----------------------------\n\n663.\n\nThe Parties are in agreement that Article 2(3)of the BIT contains two distinct but overlapping provisions: first, the positive obligation to provide FET to investments of investors of the other party; and second, the negative obligation not to engage in unjustified or discriminatory treatment *vis-\u00e0-vis* those investments.\n\n664.\n\nThey are also in agreement that these two obligations overlap, such that conduct that fulfills the positive obligation will also likely fulfill the negative obligation, although the converse is not necessarily the case. This is because the triggers for the negative obligation (unjustified or discriminatory conduct)are narrower than the potential triggers, at least in the Claimants' view, for the positive obligation.\n\n665.\n\nThe submissions of the parties have focused principally on the positive obligation, with the limited attention devoted to the negative obligation deriving from the view, discussed further below, that \"unjustified\" (in terms of the negative obligation)and \"arbitrary\" (in terms of the positive obligation)are so closely related as to permit the inference that once arbitrary action has been proven, unjustified treatment also occurred.\n\n666.\n\nThe Tribunal will consider first the parties' submissions in relation to FET, and then turn to the negative obligation set forth in Article 2(3).\n\n**(ii)The Positive Obligation to Provide FET**\n----------------------------------------------\n\n***(a)The BIT's FET standard***\n-------------------------------\n\n667.\n\nThe Parties disagree with respect to the standard that applies to the positive FET obligation. In the Respondent's view, as set forth earlier, the treaty's standard is essentially the same as the **CIL** standard for the treatment of aliens, as articulated in cases such as *Genin v. Estonia* and *Waste Management II v. Mexico*.852 In the Claimants' view, the standard is an autonomous one that goes beyond the minimum standard.\n\n*See* Respondent's Counter-Memorial, paras. 241, 242 (citing to multiple authorities, in particular **Exhibit RL-23**, *Genin v. Estonia*, and **Exhibit RL-25**, *Waste Management II v. Mexico*).\n\n668.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, the CIL standard does not provide the standard of interpretation for this treaty. The BIT contains no express language to this effect, and no evidence has been provided that, unlike the NAFTA and some other treaties, the parties to the BIT intended for the CIL standard to apply.853 Rather, the Tribunal considers that the proper approach to Article 2(3)'s positive obligation is to interpret it in accordance with the methodology prescribed by the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (\"**VCLT**\").\n\nCf. **Exhibit CL-76**, *Azurix Corp v. Argentina* and **Exhibit CL-66**, *Biwater Gauff (Tanzania)Ltd. v. United Republic of Tanzania*, ICSID Case No. ARB/05/22, Award, 24 July 2008 (hereinafter *Biwater Gauff v. Tanzania*), cited in Claimants' Reply paras. 597-99. The Tribunal notes that some of the authorities on which the Respondent relies, including *SD Myers* and *Waste Management*, are NAFTA cases applying Article 1105 of that treaty, which is expressly tied to the CIL standard. These cases are accordingly less on point than cases involving treaties whose FET standard is framed in terms similar to the present BIT.\n\n669.\n\nThis methodology focuses on the ordinary meaning of the BIT's terms, construed in light of its object and purpose.854\n\nVCLT, art. 31. This is consistent with the approach taken by a number of tribunals. *See, e.g.,* **Exhibit CL-69**, *MTD v. Chile,* paras. 112, 113; **Exhibit CL-80**, *Saluka v. Czech Republic,* para. 294.\n\n670.\n\nThe BIT, not atypically, does not prescribe the content of the FET standard. The plain meaning of the terms \"fair and equitable\" do not shed much light on its content, either.\n\n671.\n\nThe object and purpose of the BIT is to promote and protect foreign investment.855 Like the treaty in *Saluka*, however, this BIT also contains language aimed at intensifying the economic cooperation of the States Parties, namely Argentina and Peru.856 The tribunal in *Saluka* considered that this language requires a \"more balanced\" approach that emphasizes the key role played by legitimate expectations, an approach the Tribunal finds persuasive.857\n\nSee **Exhibit C-50,** Per\u00fa-Argentina BIT, Preamble: \"Recognizing that the promotion and protection of such investments through an agrement can serve as a stimulus to private economic initiative and increase the prosperity of both Nations.\" [Tribunal's translation] The original Spanish reads: \"*Reconociendo que la promocion y la proteccion de tales inversiones mediante un convenio pueden server de estimulo a la iniciative economica privada y a incrementar la prosperidad en ambas Naciones.*\" See also arts. 2(1), 2(2).\n\n*See* **Exhibit C-50,** Per\u00fa-Argentina BIT, Preamble, art. 2.\n\n**Exhibit CL-80**, *Saluka v. Czech Republic,* paras. 300-302.\n\n672.\n\nThe Parties appear to agree that FET is an objective standard, and that this specific BIT requires that FET be provided \"at all times\" (\"*en todo momento*\"), but are not fully in agreement as to the different factors that may be relevant to FET, and disagree on the content of certain factors. This is particularly the case in relation to the Claimants' position regarding inconsistent/contradictory conduct, which in the Respondent's view is not sufficient, standing alone, to trigger FET. They appear to agree that arbitrariness is relevant to FET as well as legitimate expectations, but disagree as to the application of these elements to the facts of this case.\n\n673.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, FET claims are highly factual in nature. They involve an assessment of whether the conduct of a State, viewed in its totality, has crossed a line from permissible to impermissible in relation to the investor's legitimate expectations.858 It is not a case of a Tribunal substituting its own judgment for the policy or other decisions of the State, but rather looking for those facts and circumstances that are probative on the question of whether key factors, reflecting fundamental principles of international law, have been violated.859\n\n**Exhibit CL-80**, *Saluka v. Czech Republic,* para. 285.\n\nThe *MTD v. Chile* tribunal quoted Judge Schwebel for the proposition that: \"fair and equitable treatment\" is \"a broad and widely-accepted standard encompassing such fundamental standards as good faith, due process, nondiscrimination, and proportionality\" (**Exhibit CL-69**, *MTD v. Chile,* para. 104).\n\n674.\n\nAs the tribunal in *Philip Morris v. Uruguay*, a case emphasized by the Respondent, stated:\n\n*As held by investment tribunals, whether a particular treatment is fair and equitable depends on the circumstances of the particular case. Based on investment tribunals' decisions, typical fact situations have led a leading commentator to identify the following principles as covered by the FET standard: transparency and the protection of the investor's legitimate expectations; freedom from coercion and harassment; procedural propriety and due process, and good faith.860*\n\n**Exhibit RL-27**, *Philip Morris Brands S\u00e0rl, Philip Morris Products S.A. and Abal Hermanos S.A. v. Oriental Republic of Uruguay*, ICSID Case No. ARB/10/7, Award, 8 July 2016 (hereinafter *Philip Morris v. Uruguay*), para. 320.\n\n675.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees with the Claimants that bad faith, while a highly relevant factor when present, is not a precondition for finding an FET violation. Thus, a State can be found to have acted in good faith and still breach FET as a matter of law.\n\n676.\n\nWith this consideration of the overall standard in mind, the Tribunal will examine in turn the theories put forward by the Claimants that they assert have breached the obligation of FET: first, by the inconsistent or contradictory conduct of the Respondent; second, by the arbitrary or unjustified conduct of the Respondent; and third, by conduct of the Respondent violating the Claimants' legitimate expectations.\n\n***(b)The Asserted Breaches of FET***\n-------------------------------------\n\n**i. Inconsistency/Contradictory Conduct**\n------------------------------------------\n\n677.\n\nAs noted above, the Parties dispute whether inconsistent or contradictory conduct, as such, can constitute a breach of FET. The Respondent submits it does not, and that to the extent the Claimants' FET claim is grounded on this asserted element, it should fail as a matter of law.861 Inconsistency, it submits, is relevant to whether conduct is arbitrary or unjustifiable, but that inconsistency *per se* does not engage FET, and States may sometimes act inconsistently\u2014especially when different organs or different branches of government are concerned\u2014as long as that conduct is not disproportionate in nature.862\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, paras. 325, 338.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, paras. 327-337 (discussing *Glencore* and *Philip Morris)*.\n\n678.\n\nInconsistency, standing alone, has not always been identified as an element of FET. The tribunal in *MTD v. Chile* cited with favor the description of FET in *Tecmed,* which identified consistency, along with transparency and other elements, but ultimately tied a lack of consistency to arbitrariness:\n\n*The foreign investor also expects the host State to act consistently, i.e. without arbitrarily revoking any preexisting decisions or permits issued by the state that were relied upon by the investor to assume its commitments as well as to plan and launch its commercial and business activities.863*\n\n**Exhibit CL-69**, *MTD v. Chile,* para. 114, citing *Tec-Med,* para. 98. *MTD v. Chile* was a case where there was a fundamental inconsistency between the State's approvals of the foreign investment and its land-use policy.\n\n679.\n\nOn the other hand, the tribunal in *Saluka,* an oft-cited decision, referenced \"manifest inconsistency\" in its initial framing of the standard, which it summarized after first referencing the concept of legitimate expectations as follows:\n\n*A foreign investor whose interests are protected under the Treaty is entitled to expect that the Czech Republic will not act in a way that is manifestly inconsistent, non-transparent, unreasonable (i.e. unrelated to some rational policy), or discriminatory (i.e. based on unjustifiable distinctions). In applying this standard, the Tribunal will have due regard to all relevant circumstances.864*\n\n**Exhibit CL-80**, *Saluka v. Czech Republic,* para. 309.\n\n680.\n\nThe *Philip Morris v. Uruguay* tribunal accepted that the concept of FET comprised various strands, including those recognized by the *Saluka* tribunal.865 Likewise, the *Glencore v. Colombia* decision recognizes consistency as part of a relevant set of factors, among others: \"whether the State has respected the principles of due process, consistency, and transparency when adopting the measures at issue.866\n\n**Exhibit RL-27**, *Philip Morris v. Uruguay*, para. 324: \"The Tribunal agrees that the various aspects of State conduct mentioned above are indicative of a breach of the FET standard.\"\n\n**Exhibit RL-26**, *Glencore v. Colombia*, para. 1310. *See* also **Exhibit CL- 79,** *PSEG Global v. [T\u00fcrkiye]*, para. 240.\n\n681.\n\nWhile the matter is thus not free from doubt, the Tribunal accepts that at least in some circumstances, inconsistency as a legal matter can be a distinct strand of FET independent of arbitrariness, as will be developed further below.\n\n682.\n\nHowever, the Tribunal does not consider that the facts of this case that are alleged to reflect such inconsistency constitute a violation of Article 2(3), first sentence, of the BIT. The Claimants make multiple arguments about inconsistency in the FET context, focusing on what they characterize as six \"episodes\" reflecting inconsistent treatment. The Tribunal will turn first to the three non-termination related episodes, then discuss the termination-related episodes.\n\n683.\n\n*EGP Proposal.* First, as to the alleged inconsistencies/contradictions over Kuntur Wasi's EGP proposal, the Tribunal agrees with the Respondent that the differing opinions of OSITRAN, the *Contraloria* and the MTC do not reflect the type of inconsistency that triggers international responsibility. The Tribunal is persuaded that the different mandates of the various State agencies \u2013 and in particular the broad discretion apparently accorded to the MTC to determine whether the EGP would cause economic prejudice to Peru\u2014 explain the differing positions taken by these authorities. The Claimants has not established that there was a failure to apply the relevant norms or an abuse of authority, nor any requirement of Peruvian law that one agency adopt the position of any other authority. The Tribunal therefore concurs with those authorities that have considered that differing views of State authorities applying a pre-existing legal framework are not grounds for finding an FET breach.867\n\n*See* Respondent's Counter-Memorial, paras. 244-253 and cases cited therein.\n\n684.\n\nThe analysis of the tribunal in *Glencore v. Colombia* is particularly pertinent in differentiating between those acts which merely reflect a normal diversity of opinion within government and those that rise to the level of problematic inconsistency:\n\n*1419. The Tribunal agrees with Claimants that an investor may legitimately hold the expectation that different branches of government will not take inconsistent actions affecting the investment: a government agency should not make a decision that contradicts a prior decision made by the same or another agency, acting within the same sphere of powers, on which the investor has relied, causing harm to the investor. This is part of the core meaning of the FET standard.*\n\n*1420. There is no inconsistency and no breach of legitimate expectations, however, when the second agency, applying substantive legal criteria established in a pre-existing legal framework, takes a decision which diverges from that previously adopted by another agency. The reason is simple: The modern nation-state typically endows different agencies with different legal and policy responsibilities and objectives.868 [Emphasis added]*\n\n**Exhibit RL-26**, *Glencore v. Colombia*, paras. 1419, 1420.\n\n685.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees in any event with the Respondent that any inconsistency, at least in relation *to* this \"episode\" standing alone,869 was mooted by the Parties' ultimate agreement to Addendum No. 1, which established a materially different financing scheme for the Project.\n\nIt may still be relevant when all facts and circumstances are considered, however.\n\n686.\n\n*Negotiation of Addendum No. 1.* Second, as to the alleged inconsistency in the negotiation of Addendum No. 1, the Tribunal likewise agrees with the Respondent that these facts do not engage FET. The fact that the MTC, in the course of negotiations, declined to follow an approach suggested by other Peruvian Government agencies does not constitute the type of inconsistency that would breach the FET obligation. As noted above, diversity of opinion among different government agencies operating pursuant to different mandates is not *ipso facto* problematic; this is especially true in the context of the give and take of negotiations, where typically nothing is binding until there is a final agreement. Unless there is evidence of bad faith, which has not been argued here, it would straitjacket a diverse government operation to impose such a rigid standard on a State's conduct in this context. The Tribunal also agrees with the Respondent that the fact that the Parties ultimately reached agreement on the terms of Addendum No. 1 effectively moots this issue, at least in terms of this specific \"episode.\"\n\n687.\n\n*Trato Directo.* Third, the Tribunal sees no inconsistency with respect to the State's conduct during *the* period of *Trato Directo,* including its request for an extension of the period at the end of 2017*.* The State had determined to terminate the Concession Contract and such termination naturally would lead to the taking back of the Concession. As the Respondent sets out in Rejoinder, no arbitral proceedings had been commenced by that time; consequently, Clause 15.8.7 of the Concession Contract had not been triggered.870 Furthermore, while the period of *Trato Directo* under Article 16.5 of the Contract is aimed at trying to resolve the dispute without resort to legal proceedings; it appears the negotiations were centered on the issue of compensation and the reversal of the termination was not a serious topic.871\n\n*See* Respondent's Rejoinder, para. 292.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, para. 268.\n\n688.\n\nMoreover*,* even if the Claimants are correct that the termination had not yet become effective and therefore the Concession Contract was still in force at the time Peru sought devolution of the Concession area as a technical matter, an early request for return of the land, even if contractually not justified, does not, in the Tribunal's view, implicate FET. The State was not obliged as a matter of international law to refrain from taking steps to recover the Concession area during the period of *Trato Directo.*872\n\nAt the same time, it has initiated *consultas amistosas* under Article 10 of the BIT. The same observation applies to those consultations.\n\n689.\n\nPeru's actions in terminating the period of *Trato Directo* in January 2018, shortly after it had requested an extension, also does not reflect the type of conduct that would implicate FET. Intervening events (including in relation to the devolution)could well have persuaded it that, contrary to its earlier view, the continuation of *Trato Directo* would not be fruitful.\n\n690.\n\n*Termination.* The three termination-related arguments focus on: (1)the asserted contradiction between the termination decision and the adoption of Addendum No. 1; (2)the asserted tension between the public interest arguments supporting Addendum No. 1 and those supporting the termination; and (3)the allegedly contradictory termination process, during which various officials contradicted themselves and others regarding the Contract.\n\n691.\n\nAll of these \"episodes\" purport to be based on the public interest. But in the Tribunal's view, the public interest in building the airport on a priority basis873 only goes so far in relation to the State's decisions and actions regarding the Concession. The Tribunal agrees with the Respondent that this general, overarching public interest does not mean that the State cannot take steps it deems appropriate in dealing with a specific issue with a concessionaire, even if that may slow down the Project.874 Notwithstanding its priority status, which implies an effort to complete the Project as quickly as possible, the State must in fact determine what steps at a given time best comport with the overall public interest. It does not strike the Tribunal as contradictory that at one point the State might in good faith consider that proceeding with a contractual amendment to carry a concession contract forward is the course of conduct that best furthers the public interest, while at a later point in time it might conclude otherwise and indeed, that termination of that same contract might be the course of action that best serves that interest based on all the facts and circumstances at that later point in time.\n\n**Exhibit CL-93**, Ley No. 27,528, art. 2 declared it to be: \"\u2026*de necesidad y utilida publica y de la mas alta prioridad para el Estado el Proyecto Especial Aeropuerto Internacional de Chinchero, en la provincial de Urubamba del departamento del Cusco.*\" A *Decreto de Urgencia No. 039-2010*, issued on 9 june 2010 identified a number of projects, among them the Chinchero Airport, as being \"*de necesidad nacional y de ejecuci\u00f3n prioritaria\"* for that year. (**Exhibit CL-6**, *Decreto de Urgencia No. 039-2010*, 9 June 2010). Various pronouncements of PROINVERSION reflect this, including the Convocatoria of 31 August 2010 (**Exhibit C-015**)and the Acuerdo No. 357-01-2010 (**Exhibit C-164**). The Concession Contract, in one of its Antecedentes, states that: \"*De acuerdo a lo se\u00f1alado en la misma norma se declar\u00f3 de necesidad y utilidad p\u00fablica y de la m\u00e1s alta prioridad para el Estado, el Proyecto Especial Aeropuerto Internacional de Chinchero, en la provincia de Urubamba del departamento del Cusco*.\" (**Exhibit C-4**, Concession Contract, p. 4, second paragraph). The above-cited authorities establish clearly that not only was building the Airport a matter of public interest, but it was viewed as a priority project for the State.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, para. 267.\n\n692.\n\nUndoubtedly in this case, those two points in time came in close succession, especially given the intervening defense of the Addendum by public officials, and that timing as well as the abruptness of the termination decision in and of themselves raise doubts. But the doubts they raise for the Tribunal are whether the termination decision was arbitrary or unjustified on all the facts and circumstances\u2014whether the public interest reason for termination, in the face of all that had gone before, was sufficiently established. In other words, in the Tribunal's view, it is not the alleged contradictory nature of the two decisions (and the intervening actions in support of going forward)that it is critical to examine from an FET perspective, but rather the basis for the termination decision, including the role played by the report of the *Contralor\u00eda* regarding Addendum No. 1. The Tribunal therefore concludes that the asserted episodes of contradictory behavior on the part of Peru do not implicate FET. It will examine this second bundle of \"episodes\" in the subsequent section on arbitrariness, which in the Tribunal's view, is the more relevant issue to consider in relation to this course of conduct.\n\n**ii. Arbitrary or Unjustified Conduct**\n----------------------------------------\n\n693.\n\nThe *second* ground on which the Claimants rely for their position that FET has been breached is arbitrary or unjustified conduct. Here, their focus is on the termination of the Concession Contract. Arbitrariness in their view is shown by the contradictions between statements made by Minister Vizcarra to the Congress shortly before the termination, the lack of reasoning in the termination notice, and the absence of technical opinions supporting the termination, as well as the lack of a valid public interest reason for termination.\n\n694.\n\nThe Respondent relies on the fact that the termination notice justified the action being taken by reference to the public interest, as well as its evidence regarding the \"loss of faith\" in Kuntur Wasi that caused *Minister* Giuffra to conclude that it would not be in a position to complete the Project. The Respondent also relies on its contractual right to terminate.\n\n695.\n\nThe Parties are in agreement that arbitrariness is a relevant factor in assessing whether the *treatment* a foreign investment has received is fair and equitable. They further agree that the terms \"arbitrary,\" \"unreasonable\" and \"unjustified\" are essentially synonymous.875\n\nClaimants' Reply, para. 695; Respondent's Counter-Memorial, paras. 271, 272; Respondent's Rejoinder, paras. 381, 383.\n\n696.\n\nThey subscribe to the standard of arbitrariness formulated by Professor Schreuer and set forth by the *EDF* tribunal as a comprising four categories:\n\n*[1] a measure that inflicts damage on the investor without serving any apparent legitimate purpose;*\n\n*[2] a measure that is not based on legal standards but on discretion, prejudice or personal preference;*\n\n*[3] a measure taken for reasons that are different from those put forward by the decision maker;*\n\n*[4] a measure taken in willful disregard of due process and proper procedure.876*\n\n**Exhibit CL-83**, *EDF v. Romania*, para. 303.\n\n697.\n\nDespite this apparent agreement on the relevant standard, the Respondent argues for the application of a higher threshold of proof of arbitrariness than the Claimant appears to accept.877 In the Tribunal's view, when arbitrariness is considered from the substantive point of view\u2014*i.e.*, not simply as a matter of process\u2014the key issues are the underlying basis for the conduct or measure at issue, and whether that basis is sufficient in light of the significance of that conduct or measure. If the decision reflects a U-turn from previous positions (*i.e.*, is arguably inconsistent), if it is highly consequential, if the matter is one of high public interest\u2014all of these are circumstances which bear on what may be necessary to demonstrate that a government action is not arbitrary, but sufficiently justified. This is not simply a question of what local law may or may not require, but local law may figure in the analysis, depending on the requirements that pertain to the conduct at issue. In the Tribunal's view, when dealing with a concept like arbitrariness, it is more the clarity of the evidence regarding the basis for the decision that is key, rather than whether it is a high or a low bar that must be met.\n\n*See* Claimants' Reply, paras. 695 *et seq*.\n\n698.\n\nTurning to the case at hand, the Tribunal has already expressed its view that the question of public interest (the basis of the termination here)is more nuanced than the simple invocation of the general policy in favor of building the airport as a matter of national priority. While the existence of such a policy has been amply established, it does not fully assist in addressing the questions before this Tribunal. Taken to its logical extreme, it would mean that termination of a contract with a concessionaire to build a project having such a public interest foundation and priority status could not be justified under any circumstances, as it would inevitably set the project back in time and require additional resources to complete. But that position cannot be correct.\n\n699.\n\nMoreover, in this case the Concession Contract permitted termination for \"*razones de inter\u00e9s p\u00fablico debidamente fundadas\"* (\"well-founded reasons of public interest\"). Regardless of the meaning in Peruvian law of \"*debidamente fundadas,*\" the plain language of this provision provides clear evidence that in relation to termination, the question of public interest must be a more nuanced one. The Claimants' submission that the same public interest cannot justify both continuation of the Contract under the terms of Addendum No. 1 and its termination also well illustrates this point.878\n\nClaimants' Memorial, para. 506-08.\n\n700.\n\nGiven the setbacks that any such termination could bring (*e.g.*, a rebidding process or at least the award of a new contract to a different concessionaire, all of which would take time and result in additional costs being incurred by the State), it seems evident to the Tribunal that the State, in exercising its right to termination, must be able to demonstrate that it took such action on a justified basis. If that were not the case, the State would be free to act in an arbitrary fashion.\n\n701.\n\nThe Tribunal, in its contractual analysis, has found that even assuming that the Contract's unilateral termination provision only required that there be a real public interest basis for the MTC's decision to terminate it unilaterally,879 from an international law perspective, the question is somewhat different. As a matter of substance, the action must be shown to serve a legitimate purpose, that is based on legal standards rather than mere caprice or pretext, as well as alignment between the stated reasons and the real reasons.880 In other words, State needs to be able to demonstrate its justification for termination, not in a conclusory form, but in a way that would enable the Tribunal to understand that the justification meets this standard.\n\n*See*, e.g., para. 360 *supra*.\n\nCf. **Exhibit CL-83**, *EDF v. Romania*. *See supra* para. 696.\n\n702.\n\nThis necessity becomes even more important in a context with respect to a project for which the State itself has expressed a strong public interest in going forward as a matter of priority, and as to which the facts indicate a significant and recent change of position on the part of relevant government authorities regarding its direction. In the view of the Tirbunal, the more significant and recent the change of position, the more important the justification becomes as to why the public interest is satisfied by the course of action the State has determined to take. This is especially the case when the decision has the types of significant consequences that termination of a 40-year concession contract brings.\n\n703.\n\nIn the Tribunal's assessment, satisfactory evidence of such a justification has not been put forward in these proceedings. The termination notice in this case failed to explain the justification for termination of the Concession Contract. While the notice refers to the public interest, and its \"*m\u00e1s acorde*\" language suggests that the Government's termination decision was made after a weighing of options and interests, it is entirely conclusory in nature. It does not explain further what factors were considered in the balance and what the ultimate justification was for termination. As such, it opens the door to the allegation that the decision was, in fact, arbitrary, unreasonable and unjustified. Although contemporaneous Government documents might have shed light on how this determination was made, those documents, if they exist, are not on the record here. And the agency reports that were issued in connection with the official termination notice are not on point, as they only discuss the public interest in building the Airport, not in terminating the Concession Contract.\n\n704.\n\nSeveral other facts and circumstances leading up to the Government's unilateral termination do not dispel this concern, but rather add to it:\n\n(i)Addendum No. 1, which was agreed only a few months earlier, not only reflected a diametrically contrary direction for the Project, but indicates that the main problem that had plagued the Project's progress, the financing, had been solved. In this regard it is relevant that Addendum No. 1, although greatly simplifying the financing scheme of the Project, still required financing arrangements to be made\u2014 a point the Tribunal will return to later. In contrast to the process surrounding the termination, it also reflected a deliberative and well-documented process of the Government, with input from multiple agencies taken before the Addendum was approved, making it possible to understand the basis for the public interest decision that it reflected.\n\n(ii)The public statements of Executive Branch officials supporting the Project prior to the termination, including the then-President of the country, also indicated that the public interest lay with continuing with the current contract. This is really the relevant point of such statements\u2014not the issue of whether they are binding or not, about which the parties have spilled much ink\u2014but that they underscore the strength of the public interest in going forward with the Concession Contract. And in this case, as with Addendum No. 1, all of the statements were relatively recent, some just a matter of days before the termination decision was announced by Minister Giuffra on June 4.\n\n(iii)Nor did Minister Giuffra's June 4 statement, or the June 1 *Hoja de Ruta* whose import is much disputed, put unilateral termination by the government on the table; rather, the June 1 *Hoja de Ruta* framed the alternatives as renegotiation or mutual termination, while the June 4 statement asserted there was a mutual agreement, \u2014 both of which are quite different from the unilateral termination that ultimately emerged in July.\n\n705.\n\nThe Tribunal has already examined, in its contractual analysis, the Respondent's stated basis for the termination, namely, Minister Giuffra's determination that Kuntur Wasi was not capable of going forward with the Project, and found the asserted bases for that determination to be wanting.881 That analysis applies with equal force here and will not be repeated. Given the attention certain factual issues received both in the Parties' written submissions and at the hearing, and the international law standard that must be applied, the Tribunal considers it important to consider in detail the events leading up to the termination decision, beginning with the May 19 report of the *Contraloria.*\n\nSection A.(1), *supra.*\n\n706.\n\nAs discussed earlier, the *Contraloria's* report did not require unilateral termination.882 Rather, it called into question the validity of Addendum No. 1 and consequently the \"go forward\" position. The Claimants suggest that the *Contraloria's* opinion was politically motivated, while the Respondent submits that it was serious and could not be ignored. The Tribunal considers that the reality is somewhere in between. The *Contraloria's* conclusions were rejected by other agencies of the Government of Peru,883 and in some respects are difficult to reconcile with the terms of Addendum No. 1. Moreover, the *Contraloria* had weighed in on the EGP proposal and its recommendations were not followed in the Addendum. It is clear from the record that its positions were not binding, even if not following them could create risks for the government officials involved. Indeed, Minister Giuffra admitted as much in his testimony before this Tribunal at the Hearing.884\n\n*See, e.g.,* paras. 379, 381 *supra.*\n\n*See, e.g.,* para. 395 *supra;* **Exhibit C-185**, News article published by Agencia Peruana de Noticias Andina, \"*MEF: Adenda sobre Chinchero genera ahorro econ\u00f3mico y no perjuicio econ\u00f3mico,*\" 22 May 2017; **Exhibit C-120**, News clip from Buenos D\u00edas Per\u00fa, \"*Vizcarra sobre Chinchero: Decidimos dejar sin efecto contrato que desde el inicio parti\u00f3 mal*,\" 22 May 2017; **Exhibit C-121**, News clip from CANAL N \"*Viceministra Molinelli: Informe de Contralor\u00eda no tiene sustento t\u00e9cnico*,\" 22 May 2017.\n\n*See* para. 396 *supra.*\n\n707.\n\nWhat is clear is that the *Contraloria's* report was issued in the midst of a political controversy which had gripped the country at that time. This controversy pitted the Executive against the Congress, with the *Contraloria* apparently aligned with the latter. Minister Vizcarra was threatened with impeachment and had to appear before the Congress to defend Addendum No. 1 and a contract made by the predecessor government. The criminal investigation previously initiated was expanded to include the possibility of collusion with respect to Addendum No. 1.\n\n708.\n\nFacing censure from the Congress, Minister Vizcarra resigned his post a few days after the issuance of the *Contraloria's* report and his appearances before the Congress. The day prior to his resignation, he announced that the Contract as modified by Addendum No. 1 would have no effect. His 180-degree turn demonstrates the degree to which the Project had become politicized.\n\n709.\n\nIt was at this juncture, on 25 May 2017, one day after Kuntur Wasi was asked to agree to extend the Contract's suspension,885 that Bruno Giuffra became Minister of Transportation and Communications. From this point, it was a mere 10 days before the new Minister announced, on June 4, 2017, that Kuntur Wasi would not continue with the Project and the Concession Contract would be terminated, allegedly by mutual agreement.886\n\n**Exhibit C-79**, *Oficio No. 2118-2017-MTC/25*, 24 May 2017; **Exhibit C-80**, Letter No. 075-2017-KW, 26 May 2017.\n\n**Exhibit C-40**, News article published by El Comercio, \"*Gobierno y Kuntur Wasi acordaron resolver contrato por Chinchero, anuncia Giuffra*,\" 4 June 2017. The formal termination notice was not issued until 6 weeks later, on July 13, 2017. **Exhibit C-44**, *Oficio No. 142-2017-MTC/01*, 13 July 2017.\n\n710.\n\nThe Respondent has submitted that Minister Giuffra resolved to terminate the Contract after Kuntur Wasi advised him that it would need another six months to secure the construction financing on the basis of the terms then under discussion, at which point he lost faith in Kuntur Wasi's ability to complete the Project at all.887\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, para. 267.\n\n711.\n\nThe only evidence in support of this position is Minister Giuffra's testimony in these proceedings. Peru has put forward no documentation that makes this point, and it is disputed by the Claimants. In its contractual analysis, the Tribunal concluded it was unnecessary to determine whether Kuntur Wasi in fact made such an assertion, given its view that even if such a statement had been made, six months would have been a reasonable period of time to secure financing and would not have demonstrated the Concessionaire's lack of capacity to complete the Project.888\n\n*See* para. 411 *supra.*\n\n712.\n\nMoreover, the formal notice of 13 July 2017 from the MTC unilaterally terminating the Concession under Section 15.5.1 of the Contract does not reflect the conclusion put forward by Minister Giuffra in his witness statement and at the hearing. The MTC and MINCETUR opinions that were issued in connection with the termination889 reiterate the public interest in building the Airport, but for the reasons articulated earlier, do not express the public interest in termination, which was the action requiring justification. Nor do they reflect the conclusion to which Mr. Giuffra has testified in these proceedings.\n\n**Exhibit R-17**, *Oficio No. 050-2017-MINCETUR/DM-GA*, 13 July 2017, attaching *Informe No. 016-2017/MINCETUR/VMT/DGET/DIOT*, MINCETUR's Opinion Regarding Public Interest of Chinchero Airport, 12 July 2017; **Exhibit R-18**, Memorandum No. 0524-2017-MTC-12.08, 13 July 2017, attaching *Informe No. 0347-2017-MTC/12.08*, MTC's Opinion Regarding Public Interest of Chinchero Airport, 13 July 2017; **Exhibit R-19**, Memorandum No. 3410-2017-MTC/25, 13 July 2017, attaching Report No. 0567- 2017-MTC/25, MTC's Legal Opinion Regarding Public Interest of Chinchero Airport, 13 July 2017.\n\n713.\n\nMinister Giuffra indicated he sought and received external legal advice regarding the termination, but that documentation has not been submitted as evidence in these proceedings.890\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, para. 130 (stating that \"Minister Giuffra also sought advice of outside and internal legal counsel to confirm that the bases upon which the MTC was considering terminating the Contract were consistent with the provisions provided for in the Contract\"). Note 241 to this paragraph refers to Minister Giuffra's statement and to the legal advice of MTC (**Exhibit R-19**)but does not cite to any external advice.\n\n714.\n\nMinister Giuffra may well have come to the conclusion to which he has testified, *i.e.*, that he lost confidence in Kuntur Wasi's ability to complete the Project. But even if that was his view at the time, the decision to terminate on that basis and in the manner it was implemented was unreasonable and unjustified, for the reasons the Tribunal has already expressed in the contractual section. First, even if Addendum No. 1 simplified the financing, it still needed to be arranged. And further changes were under discussion in early June, including shortening the Concession period, which could well have further implications for the financing requirements for the Project. It would be unreasonable for the State to assume that even a simpler financing arrangement than the PAO/FPAO scheme could be completed overnight. Thus, a request for a reasonable amount of time to arrange financing under a different scheme than that previously pursued would not, in the Tribunal's view, indicate a lack of capacity to complete the Project.\n\n715.\n\nSecond, the unilateral termination decision was in fact an abrupt change of position from the June 1 *Hoja de Ruta* and the June 4 announcement, by a new Minister who had assumed his position in the midst of political turmoil in the country. Termination was not mandated by the report of the *Contraloria*, which as already noted, was non-binding.891\n\n*See* **Exhibit CER-6**, Qui\u00f1ones Alayza Report, para. 166 *et seq*. The Tribunal notes that is position appears to be consistent with how the parties treated the opinion of the *Contraloria* with regard to EGP as well. *See* paras. 397-402 *supra.*\n\n716.\n\nGiven all these circumstances, and given the official stated basis of termination, the Tribunal concludes that, if Minister Giuffra's stated reasons in these proceedings were the real reasons, then the government's official reasons do not state the real reasons; if, on the other hand, the official reasons are the real reasons, then they are inapposite as they do not explain the public interest *in termination of the Contract*. Either way the position is troubling from an international law perspective. Harking back to the *EDF v. Romania* tests for arbitrariness set forth earlier, the termination inflicted damage on the Claimants without setting forth a sufficient justification for the action taken, it appears to have been based on subjective views rather than objective legal standards, and the ultimate reasons are cast into doubt by the different explanations given in the official termination documents and in these proceedings. Moreover, the manner in which the decision was taken, in contrast to prior actions in relation to the Contract, and the fact that it represented an about-face from recent actions, deepen the concerns about the termination decision.\n\n717.\n\nTaken in the context of all of the circumstances, as is appropriate for FET determinations, the Tribunal concludes that the evidence put forward in these proceedings indicates that the unilateral termination decision was arbitrary, unreasonable, and unjustified.\n\n718.\n\nThis finding also deals with the Respondent's position that termination in accordance with a contract can never implicate FET.892 In the Tribunal's view, when termination reflects an arbitrary course of conduct on the part of the State and is therefore wrongful, reliance on a termination right in the contract does not prevent that act from constituting an FET breach. Had the termination been properly justified in terms of the Contract, a different question would have been presented here. But it was not.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, para. 238; Respondent's Rejoinder, paras. 318-320.\n\n719.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, the termination decision here, while expressed through the State's purported exercise of a contractual right, was in fact an exercise of *puissance publique*. This was not, in the words of the tribunal in *Biwater Gauff,* on which the Respondent relies, the \"ordinary behavior\" of a contractual counterparty that was long-anticipated.893 Nor, despite some surface parallels, is this situation akin to the one in *Convial Callao*, on which the Respondent particularly relies. There, the Claimants argued that the existence of a contractual termination right grounded in the public interest rendered any such termination inherently an exercise of sovereign authority. The tribunal concluded there was no such inherent right in Peruvian law, and that it only existed as a matter of contract.894 The tribunal went on to determine that the termination, pursuant to a clause substantially different from the one here, that provided for termination \"[a]t any moment and for reasons of opportunity, merit or convenience to the public interest\" [Tribunal's translation]*,* without any requirement that they be well-founded (\"*debidamente fundadas).895*\n\n**Exhibit CL-66**, *Biwater Gauff v. Tanzania*, para. 492.\n\n**Exhibit RL-43**, *Convial Callao S.A. and CCI \u2013 Compa\u00f1\u00eda de concesiones de Infraestructura S.A. v. Republic of Peru*, ICSID Case No. ARB/10/2, Award, 21 May 2013 (hereinafter *Convial Callao v. Peru*), paras. 513-527.\n\nThe Spanish original reads: \"*[e]n cualquier momento y por razones de oportunidad, m\u00e9rito o conveniencia al inter\u00e9s p\u00fablico*.\" **Exhibit RL-43**, *Convial Callao v. Peru*, para. 518.\n\n720.\n\nSeveral aspects of the tribunal's analysis in *Convial Callao* merit highlighting here. The tribunal recognized early in its consideration of the issue that several tribunals had implicitly recognized the possibility of contractual rights providing the basis for an international treaty violation, \"when the contractual breach implies non-compliance with an obligation under the treaty,\" not limited to situations of treaties featuring an umbrella clause.896 [Tribunal's translation]\n\nThe Spanish original reads: \"*cuando la violaci\u00f3n contractual conlleva el incumplimento de una obligaci\u00f3n bajo el tratado*.\" **Exhibit RL-43**, *Convial Callao v. Peru*, para. 503.\n\n721.\n\nThe tribunal also recognized that some acts that at first blush may be considered contractual in nature are in reality sovereign acts that as a consequence engage state responsibility.897 But it found nothing at the end of the day in the State's conduct to convince it that the termination decision was anything more than the proper exercise of a contractual right.898 The Claimants' allegations of political pressure and arbitrary motives were deemed899 unproven.\n\n**Exhibit RL-43**, *Convial Callao v. Peru,* para. 511.\n\n**Exhibit RL-43**, *Convial Callao v. Peru,* para. 540.\n\n**Exhibit RL-43**, *Convial Callao v. Peru,* para. 544.\n\n722.\n\nThe Tribunal is persuaded that the facts of this case justify the conclusion that the termination decision was a sovereign one, even if it purported to have been taken within the contractual framework. As set forth above in Section A.(1), it has not been established that the decision was for well-founded (\"*debidamente fundadas\")* reasons as a matter of Peruvian law even on the Respondent's narrower reading of that requirement. Moreover, from an international law perspective, the justification for the termination decision was likewise defective leading to the conclusion that the decision was arbitrary. While the Tribunal has not determined the unilateral termination was pretextual, as some other tribunals have identified as an exception to the general rule,900 its findings are a close cousin and similar logic holds.\n\n*See* Respondent's Rejoinder, paras. 451, 452, 454, and cases cited therein.\n\n723.\n\nThe existence of the Guarantee Agreement in this case also put the full authority of the State behind proper Contract performance, as will be discussed in further detail in the next section in connection with the issue of legitimate expectations. The question framed by the *Vigotop* tribunal, whether \"[the State] has stepped out of the contractual shoes?\"901 must therefore in this case be answered in the affirmative*.*\n\n*See* Claimants' Reply, paras. 796-800, **Exhibit RL-45**, *Vigotop Limited v. Republic of Hungary*, ICSID Case No. ARB/11/22, Award, October 1, 2014, para. 328.\n\n**iii. Legitimate Expectations**\n--------------------------------\n\n724.\n\nThe final element that must be considered in the FET analysis is the issue of legitimate expectations.\n\n725.\n\nLegitimate expectations are a key factor in FET determinations. Prominent commentators consider them to be a pillar of FET,902 and many investment tribunal decisions have highlighted their importance.903\n\n*E.g.,* **Exhibit CL-87**, Rudolf Dolzer, \"*Fair and Equitable Treatment: Today's Contours,*\" 12 Santa Clara J. INT'L L. 7, 17 (2014).\n\nE.g., **Exhibit CL-80**, Saluka v. Czech Republic, **Exhibit CL-91**, Gold Reserve v. Venezuela; **Exhibit CL-9**, Olin Holdings v. Libya.\n\n726.\n\nThe Respondent agrees with the relevance of this factor, but emphasizes the need for reasonableness regarding such expectations, and the need for specificity with respect to them.904 The Tribunal agrees with these points, but finds that they present no obstacle here.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, paras. 282-288.\n\n727.\n\nThe Claimants' asserted expectations fall into at least two distinct categories: (1)expectations from generally applicable documents that support the building of the Airport as a matter of priority national public interest; (2)specific commitments arising from the Concession Contract and the Guarantee Agreement, including the signature of Addendum No. 1.\n\n728.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, the first group of documents can contribute to the Claimants' expectations only to a limited extent. Although they precede the making of the investment, they merely establish that the building of the Airport is a matter of strong public interest to Peru that should be carried out as a matter of priority. But in the same way that this general public interest only goes so far in justifying termination, so it only goes so far in shaping the legitimate expectations of the Claimants.\n\n729.\n\nFar more relevant in the Tribunal's view are the Concession Contract and Guarantee Agreement, both of which are documents reflecting specific commitments on the part of the State to the Claimants and the investment. The Tribunal accepts the submission of the Respondent, based on the writings of Professor Schreuer, that not every contractual provision can give rise to legitimate expectations on the part of a foreign investor and that only those expectations as to the future created by a contract that are specific and fundamental should be recognized.905\n\n*See* Respondent's Rejoinder, paras. 409-412.\n\n730.\n\nIt would clearly be unreasonable for the Claimants to have an expectation that the Project would be built and they would retain the Concession for its full 40-year term, regardless of performance, contingencies, required approvals, or the like. Such an expectation is belied by the terms of the Contract itself, and the Tribunal does not understand the Claimants' position to be that any such expectations would be legitimate.\n\n731.\n\nBut an expectation that if the Concession Contract came to the point of termination, especially the exercise of a unilateral termination right by the State, the Government would not exercise that right in an arbitrary, unreasonable or unjustified manner, especially in light of the undisputed public interest in building the Project on a priority basis, is in the Tribunal's view a legitimate one, particularly in light of the Contract's specific unilateral termination provision.\n\n732.\n\nThe Guarantee Agreement reinforces this expectation. Although the Respondent has sought to minimize its importance, the Guarantee Agreement is a commitment that puts the full force of the State behind compliance with the terms of the Concession Contract, including the clauses governing its termination.906 It therefore reinforces those expectations from the Contract that are legitimate, such as those in relation to termination. Indeed, according to the Claimants' legal expert Ms. Qui\u00f1ones, the Guarantee had the force of law and could only be modified with the assent of the Congress.907 To consider that it had no effect on expectations would be to deny any *effet utile* to the Guarantee. In the context of termination, therefore, the Tribunal considers that the Guarantee Agreement created a legitimate expectation, under the provisions of the BIT, that the Concessionaire would be protected by the State against a termination decision by the MTC that did not conform to the terms of the Contract.\n\nAccording to Ms. Qui\u00f1ones, it follows from entering the Guarantee Contract that the provisions governing the termination of the Concession Contract are also part of the assurances the Peruvian government gave to the Concessionnaire. **CER-6**, Qui\u00f1ones Alayza Report, para. 43.\n\nMs. Qui\u00f1ones explains that by entering a \"*contrato-ley*,\" the Peruvian government restricts its own *ius imperium,* and compliance with its obligations are governed by private law. Thereby, unilateral amendments are not valid, not event if approved by Congress. **CER-6**, Qui\u00f1ones Alayza Report, paras. 46, 47.\n\n733.\n\nBoth the Concession Contract and the Guarantee Agreement thus give rise, in the view of the Tribunal, to legitimate expectations with respect to the exercise of a termination right on a proper basis. Although the Tribunal concluded that Peru did not violate the doctrine of *actos propios* under Peruvian Law for the unjustified termination of the Concession Contract (see para. 444 *supra*), it finds that the Claimants acquired a legitimate expectation under the BIT that the Contract would only be terminated according to its own terms.\n\n734.\n\nWith respect to the element of reliance, there is no doubt that investments were made by the Claimants in response to the Concession Contract and Guarantee Agreement--in establishing Kuntur Wasi, in preparing the EDI, and otherwise in pursuing the Project. These investments show the reliance of the Claimants on the legitimate expectations created by those Concession Contract provisions and Guarantee with respect to the risk that the Contract would be terminated.\n\n735.\n\nIt is less clear to the Tribunal what legitimate expectations, if any, can be said to have arisen from Addendum No. 1. It post-dated the initial investment and, given that the Project was suspended by mutual agreement just a few weeks after the Addendum's signature, it is unlikely significant investments were made in reliance on it (and indeed, none have been proven here). Any expectation would thus be a more general one harking back to the original Contract and Guarantee Agreement, essentially that given the public interest in building the Airport on a priority basis, the State would work in good faith with the Concessionaire to develop a financing plan that would allow the Project to move forward. But the Addendum did not operate to create legitimate expectations that the Contract could not be unilaterally terminated. To the extent it could be said to create any expectations, they would be limited by and subject to those Contract provisions allowing for such termination in certain circumstances. The most therefore that can be said, when the Concession Contract, Guarantee Agreement, and Addendum No. 1 are considered together, is that the Claimants had legitimate expectations of good faith and careful consideration on the part of the State in resolving issues that might arise during the term of the Concession, including the financing scheme for construction, and that the State would ensure that the MTC would not invoke its unilateral termination right without a proper justification for such termination, given not only the Contract requirements but also the setbacks such an action would bring to a Project whose construction as a priority matter was a matter of high public interest.\n\n736.\n\nBefore reaching a final conclusion on FET, however, the Tribunal must consider the Respondent's arguments concerning the Claimants' conduct, especially the position that the Claimants through their EGP proposal sought to \"game the tender process,\" in particular by manipulating the formula by which the PAO Trimestral would be calculated.908 The Respondent has also suggested in passing in its Rejoinder that the Claimants have failed to put forward evidence of the due diligence on which they based their investments.909 However, this is not the affirmative obligation of the Claimants to prove and has not been raised by the Respondent as an affirmative defense. The Tribunal will therefore focus on the \"gaming the system\" allegation as potentially justifying termination, even though it has likewise not been put forward by the Respondent as a defense under a rubric of bad faith, unclean hands, or other similar theory.\n\n*See, e.g.,* Respondent's Counter-Memorial, paras. 5, 78, 81, 96, 212; Respondent's Rejoinder, para. 5, 378, 464; **Exhibit RD-1**, Respondent's Opening Statement Presentation, 13 September 2021 \"Theme 1- Kuntur Wasi Tried to Game the Tender Process\", pp. 4-50; Transcript, Day 1 (English), 134:1322; 144:15-21; 145:18-22; 146:1-11; 152:7-22; 153-156:1-18.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, para. 435.\n\n***(c)Kuntur Wasi's Alleged \"Gaming of the System\"***\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n737.\n\nThe \"gaming the system\" allegation relates to the EGP proposal that was first presented by Kuntur Wasi to the MTC and OSITRAN in September 2015,910 only to be rejected in December 2015 by OSITRAN due to Kuntur Wasi's failure to submit all necessary documents with the proposal.911 It was re-presented in May 2016 to the MTC and subsequently to OSITRAN as well.912\n\n**Exhibit R-71**, Letter No. 246-2015-KW, 17 September 2015.\n\n**Exhibit R-38**, Annex 25 to Letter No. 089-2016-KW, 4 May 2016.\n\n**Exhibit C-20**, *Oficio Circular No. 039-16-SCD-OSITRAN*, 22 July 2016.\n\n738.\n\nThe Respondent has argued strongly that the EGP proposal reverse engineered the formula set forth in the Concession Contract to generate an \"i\" variable that allowed Claimants to shift costs to the Respondent that they had not factored into their bid and that were not intended to be passed through to the Respondent.913\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, para. 94.\n\n739.\n\nIt is important to consider the chronology of this proposal in some detail. OSITRAN approved the EGP proposal in July 2016, just a few days before a new government took office in Peru and Martin Vizcarra became Minister of Transport and Communications.914\n\n**Exhibit C-21,** *Oficio Circular No. 039-16-SCD-OSITRAN*, 22 July 2016. OSITRAN approved the EGP proposal on 20 July 2016; the new government, headed by Pedro Pablo Kuczynski, took office on 28 July 2016.\n\n740.\n\nThe new government asked for reports from the *Contralor\u00eda* and the CAF on Kuntur Wasi's financing proposal, leading the MTC to suspend the deadline for EGP approval.915 The *Contralor\u00eda* issued its report in mid-October 2016, recommending negotiation of the discount rate \"i.\"916 This led to Kuntur Wasi's making amended proposals consistent with the recommendation of the *Contralor\u00eda*.917 The State's rejection of these proposals resulted in a counterproposal that ultimately became Addendum No. 1.918\n\n**Exhibit R-39**, *Oficio No. 3144-2016-MTC/25*, 9 August 2016.\n\n**Exhibit C-22**, *Oficio No. 4268-2016 MTC/25*, 27 October 2016. The subsequent CAF report recommended a reduction in the quarterly PAO. **Exhibit C-23**, *Reporte de Conclusiones y Recomendaciones*, CAF, 7 November 2016.\n\n**Exhibit C-62**, Letter No. 183-2016-KW, 28 October 2016.\n\n**Exhibit C-63**, *Oficio No. 4362-2016-MTC/25*, 7 November 2016.\n\n741.\n\nIt is worth re-emphasizing that Addendum No. 1 materially changed the concept for the State's financial support of the Project in the construction phase. Instead of paying quarterly quotas (\"*cuotas trimestrales*\")under the FPAO/PAO scheme*,* the State would advance the cost of the work in a pay-as you-go (PPO)scheme, similar to the approach taken in prior phase of site preparation.\n\n742.\n\nDespite the issues raised with the EGP from the time it was re-proposed in May 2016 through the finalization of Addendum No. 1 and its approval by OSITRAN, the Ministry of Economy and Finance, the MTC, the Council of Ministers, and the President himself,919 the Tribunal is aware of no evidence during this period that any authority claimed that Kuntur Wasi was \"gaming the system.\" This includes the MTC's rejection of the EGP proposal.920\n\n*See* **Exhibit C-72**, *Oficio Circular No. 006-17-SCD-OSITRAN*, attaching the *Acuerdo No. 2009-607-17-CD-OSITRAN*, 20 January 2 017; **Exhibit C-73**, *Informe No. 016-2017-EF/68.01,* 27 January 2017; **Exhibit C-74**, Video published by Latina Noticias, *Aeropuerto de Chinchero: Pedro Pablo Kuczynski se pronunica tras suspensi\u00f3n de proyecto*,\" 30 January 2017; **Exhibit C-75**, News article published by RPP NOTICIAS, *Vizcarra: \"PPK viajar\u00e1 este Viernes al Cusco para iniciar obras en Chinchero,\"* 1 February 2017; **Exhibit C-76**, *Informe No. 105-2017-MTC/25*, 2 February 2017.\n\n**Exhibit C-67,** *Oficio No. 4601-2016-MTC*, 25 November 2016. In its *Oficio No. 4601-2016-MTC*, the MTC provided the reasons for rejecting the EGP proposal, concluding it would cause economic prejudice to the Grantor, *i.e.*, the State. The MTC did not claim the proposal was an attempt to \"game the system.\"\n\n743.\n\nTo be sure, there were criticisms made of the proposal. The CAF opined that the method of calculation used by Kuntur Wasi was at variance with those used in the financial markets and those markets' understanding of the cost of financing.921 The MTC picked up these criticisms in its rejection of Kuntur Wasi's proposal.922 OSITRAN, on the other hand found it to be \"in accordance with the requirements of the Concession Contract.\"923\n\n*See* para. 153 *supra.*\n\n*See* para. 156 *supra.*\n\n*See* para. 143 *supra.*\n\n744.\n\nMost significant, however, to the Tribunal is the report of the *Contralor\u00eda* in relation to the proposal. As set forth above and in the Tribunal's discussion of these issues in relation to the Claimant's contractual claims,924 it noted that the Concession Contract did not set out any limits to the variable \"i\" and did not identify the assumptions used to calculate that variable. They also flagged the question whether bidders had access to the calculations of \"i\" by Peru's outside consultants, ALG, during the bidding process.925 Subsequently, it emerged that they did not and that material was confidential.926\n\n*See* paras. 363 *et seq. supra.*\n\n*See* para. 148 *supra.*\n\n*See* para. 366 *supra.*\n\n745.\n\nThe lack of definition of the variable \"i\" in the Contract and the public unavailability of certain other documents that might have raised additional questions about the calculation of \"i,\" suggest that the EGP proposal may well have arisen from a simple lack of communication and consequent misunderstanding about this issue on the part of the parties.\n\n746.\n\nIndeed, Addendum No. 1\u2014signed by the MTC and approved by other Government agencies -- states in its preamble that:\n\n*\u2026The vagueness of the terms of the Contract, as it has been drafted and without any limits having been set for the indebtness rate, does not allow to identify the inputs applicable for estimating the \"i\" Rate, so that the approval of such rate, estimated by the Concessionaire, could be different from the cofinancing levels estimated by the Peruvian State during the process for the promotion of the Tender of Integral Projects for awarding the concession of the new International Airport Chinchero-Cuzco\u2026*927 *[Tribunal's translation]*\n\nThe Spanish original reads: \"*la generalidad del Contrato de Concesi\u00f3n, tal como ha quedado redactado y sin haberse planteado l\u00edmites a la tasa de endeudamiento, no permite identificar los supuestos aplicables para la estimaci\u00f3n de la Tasa \"I\", por lo que la aprobaci\u00f3n de dicha tasa, estimada por el Concesionario, podr\u00eda diferir de los niveles de confinaciamiento estimado por el Estado Peruano durante el proceso de promoci\u00f3n del Concurso de Proyectos Integrales para el otorgamiento en concesi\u00f3n del nuevo Aeropuerto Internacional de Chinchero \u2013 Cusco\u2026*\" **Exhibit C-24**, Addendum No. 1, Cl. 1, para. 3.\n\n747.\n\nThe Addendum thus squarely points to lack of a definition of the variable \"i\" in the Concession Contract, and indicates that it opened the door to differences in the estimates prepared by the Peruvian State during the bidding process versus proposals from the Concessionaire regarding the levels of co-financing that would be required. Had the Peruvian State believed at the time of Addendum No. 1\u2014with full information about the Concessionaire's EGP proposal in hand\u2014that the Concessionaire had effectively participated in the tender or otherwise acted in bad faith\u2014not only would such a clause not appear in Addendum No. 1, but it is hard to imagine that the State would have even been willing to negotiate an alternative financing structure at that time.\n\n748.\n\nThe Tribunal therefore concludes that there is insufficient evidence on which to conclude that Kuntur Wasi was seeking to \"game the tender process\" with its EGP proposal. The Tribunal is well aware that some bidders do seek to game such processes in various ways. But that behavior is not proven here, in its judgment, and is negated by the State's own contemporaneous conduct. As the Addendum itself says, given the Contract provisions and the lack of information given to bidders about Peru's assumptions, different bidders could have come to different conclusions about what would be permitted by the Contract's formula. The procurement process and the Contract terms were developed by Peru, not by bidders such as Kuntur Wasi. If they were unclear or ambiguous, the fault for that cannot be put on the bidders. While the Peruvian State may have had certain expectations about how the variable \"i\" should be calculated, as previously analyzed by the Tribunal, it appears these expectations were not conveyed to bidders.928 Given those expectations, the Tribunal can appreciate that the MTC would have been concerned and even surprised by the financial burden on the State under the PAO/FPAO scheme resulting from Kuntur Wasi's EGP proposal. But there is a difference between \"gaming the tender process,\" which implies something close to bad faith, and simply utilizing what might be characterized as a loophole or a lack of clarity in the original scheme.929\n\n*See* para. 366 *supra.*\n\nThe Tribunal notes that Minister Vizcarra, in his 21 May announcement that the Contract would be left *sin efecto* criticized the predecessor government and characterized the contract as a bad contract. *See* **Exhibit C-120**, News clip from Buenos D\u00edas Per\u00fa, \"*Vizcarra sobre Chinchero: Decidimos dejar sin efecto contrato que desde el inicio parti\u00f3 mal*,\" 22 May 2017.\n\n749.\n\nIn any event \"gaming the tender process\" was not the stated basis for termination. Consistent with the prior analysis, if a concern that Kuntur Wasi was doing so was the underlying motivation for termination, then the real reason for termination diverged even further than has previously been analyzed from the publicly stated reason, which is problematic for the same reasons as already indicated. And if it was not, then the issue would seem to be irrelevant to the question of arbitrariness.\n\n750.\n\nThe Tribunal also notes the efforts of Kuntur Wasi to find a solution to the Project construction financing problem. When the EGP proposal was rejected by the MTC as being unduly burdensome for the State, as was its prerogative, Kuntur Wasi engaged in a dialogue to try to develop an alternative approach. It made proposals to the MTC and continued with the efforts to find an alternative when the MTC rejected its proposals. It agreed to Addendum No. 1, the State's alternative proposal. It agreed to suspend the Contract's performance after the *Contraloria* issued its report on Addendum No. 1 and agreed to an extension of that suspension when requested by the MTC. It engaged in negotiations with newly installed Minister Giuffra to try to identify an alternative financing approach for the Airport's construction and agreed to his June 1 *Hoja de Ruta.* Nor, as the Tribunal has previously determined, would it have been unreasonable for Kuntur Wasi to indicate to Minister Giuffra, as he alleges, that it would need six months to finalize construction financing for the Project under whatever scheme was to emerge from the June 1 negotiations. All of these actions, in the view of the Tribunal, showed the good faith of Kuntur Wasi in trying to find a mutually agreeable alternative financing approach for the Project, and cut against any finding that the Claimants were simply trying to \"game the tender process.\"\n\n***(d)Conclusion on FET***\n--------------------------\n\n751.\n\nThe Tribunal appreciates that by mid-2017 the State might have felt frustration with the limited progress on the Project, and therefore with the Concessionaire, especially given the political situation at the time. But while the failed EGP proposal undoubtedly cost the Project in terms of time, it was not, in the Tribunal's view, a product of Kuntur Wasi\u00b4s trying to \"game the tender process.\" Nor did it demonstrate that Kuntur Wasi could not arrange construction financing under any scenario. Whatever concerns the episode may have raised, the State was not justified in simply acting in an arbitrary manner to abruptly and unilaterally terminate the Contract. The Claimants had legitimate expectations based on the Contract and the Guarantee Agreement, fortified by the overall public interest in building the Project as a matter of priority, that any such extreme action would be properly justified through the same type of deliberative processes that had previously occurred in relation to the Contract and Addendum No. 1. This required, as the Tribunal has set forth earlier, a clearer, more consistent, and reasoned basis for the termination than that which has been put before this Tribunal.\n\n752.\n\nAccordingly, the Tribunal finds that the BIT's FET standard has been violated.\n\n**(iii)The Negative Obligation of Article 2(3): Unjustified Conduct**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n753.\n\nThe conclusion that the positive FET obligation set forth in Article 2(3)has been violated makes the analysis of whether the Respondent engaged in unjustified conduct in terms of the negative obligation of Article 2(3)quite straightforward.\n\n754.\n\nIt is not disputed that the termination undoubtedly affected the use, enjoyment, etc., of the investment in the terms of Article 2(3)'s negative obligation. The only question, therefore, is whether it was \"unjustified.\"\n\n755.\n\nAs indicated above, the parties are in agreement that for purposes of this matter, the terms \"arbitrary,\" \"unreasonable\" and \"unjustified\" are essentially the same thing.930 \"Arbitrary\" or \"unreasonable\" are the most common descriptors of the relevant factors in an FET context; \"unjustified\" is the language used by the negative obligation of 2(3).931 In the Tribunal's view, while the three terms might not always be coterminous, in this case, they coincide.\n\nThe Respondent has not only accepted that the relevant terms are synonymous, it has essentially conflated the analysis of the two provisions in its submissions. *See* Respondent's Counter-Memorial, paras. 269-281 (arguing that Respondent has not acted in either an arbitrary or unjustified manner)and Respondent's Rejoinder, paras. 381-383.\n\nThe \"discriminatory\" element of this provision is not at issue here and is therefore not considered further.\n\n756.\n\nWhile not all conduct violative of FET would necessarily implicate this negative obligation, in this case, the basis of the Tribunal's finding that FET has been violated readily carries over into this provision. The lack of a proper justification for the termination as set forth in detail in the preceding section is in fact the basis of the finding that FET was breached in this case. It is the converse of the *Lemire v. Ukraine* situation cited by the Claimants,932 but that distinction is of no import since the Tribunal could equally have considered the two provisions of Article 2(3) in reverse order and reached the same conclusion.\n\nClaimants' Memorial, para. 532, citing **Exhibit CL-64**, *Jos\u00e9ph Charles Lemire v. Ukraine II*, ICSID case No. ARB/06/18, Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability, 14 January 2010.\n\n757.\n\nAccordingly, the Tribunal finds that the termination also breached the negative obligation of Article 2(3)of the BIT.\n\n**(2)Expropriation**\n--------------------\n\n***a. The Parties' Positions***\n-------------------------------\n\n**(i)The Claimants' Position**\n------------------------------\n\n758.\n\nThe Claimants' third claim is that Peru expropriated its investment, without \"prompt, adequate and effective\" compensation, in breach of Article 4(2)of the BIT.933\n\n*None of the Contracting Parties shall take nationalization or expropriation measures or any other measure having the same effect, against investments that are in its territory and that belong to investors of the other Contracting Party, unless such measures are taken for reasons of national security or public utility, on a non-discriminatory basis and under due process of law. The measures will be accompanied by provisions for the payment of prompt, adequate and effective compensation.934*\n\nClaimants' Memorial, para. 553, citing **Exhibit C-50**, Per\u00fa-Argentina BIT, art. 4(2).\n\nThis is an English translation taken from Respondent's Counter-Memorial, para. 297. The Spanish original reads: \"*Ninguna de las Partes Contratantes tomar\u00e1 medidas de nacionalizaci\u00f3n o expropiaci\u00f3n ni ninguna otra medida que tenga el mismo efecto, contra inversiones que se encuentren en su territorio y que pertenezcan a inversores de la otra Parte Contratante, a menos que dichas medidas sean tomadas por razones de seguridad nacional o utilidad p\u00fablica, sobre una base no discriminatoria y bajo el debido proceso legal. Las medidas ser\u00e1n acompa\u00f1adas de disposiciones para el pago de una compensaci\u00f3n pronta, adecuada y efectiva.*\" **Exhibit C-50**, Per\u00fa-Argentina BIT, art. 4(2).\n\n759.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, it is well settled in the jurisprudence that both tangible and intangible assets may be the subject of an expropriation, including economic rights derived from contracts. In this case, the Claimants argue that Peru expropriated its rights to and under the Concession Contract and the EDI, which constitutes Kuntur Wasi's intellectual property.935\n\nClaimants' Memorial, paras. 555-558.\n\n***(a)Expropriation of the Concession Contract***\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n760.\n\nFirst, the Claimants argue that Peru directly and illegally expropriated their economic rights under the Concession Contract. In particular, through the Concession Contract, Peru granted to the Claimants, the following rights, to be enjoyed for a period of 40 years: (i)the right to Airport and non-Airport related income; and (ii)the access tariffs, which constitute \"[e]conomic concessions granted by law or by contract\" (\"*[c]oncesiones econ\u00f3micas conferidas por ley o por contrato*\")[Tribunal's translation] under the BIT's definition of protected investments.936 In the Claimants' view, Peru expropriated these economic rights when it declared the unilateral termination of the Concession Contract, as this terminated all of the economic rights thereunder, and Peru never paid any compensation.937\n\nClaimants' Memorial, para. 560, citing **Exhibit C-50**, Per\u00fa-Argentina BIT, art. 1(1)(e).\n\nClaimants' Memorial, para. 561.\n\n***(b)Expropriation of the EDI***\n---------------------------------\n\n761.\n\nSecondly, the Claimants allege that the EDI, which Kuntur Wasi prepared to comply with its obligations under the Concession Contract and which contains the shop drawings of the Project, as well as sufficient details to begin the construction works, qualifies as \"intellectual property rights\" (\"*derechos de propiedad intelectual*\")protected under the BIT. The Claimants explain that Kuntur Wasi incurred significant costs \u2013 of more than US$27 million \u2013 to prepare the EDI and that Peru is currently benefiting from the EDI without having paid for it. In particular, the Claimants point out that Peru used Kuntur Wasi's EDI as the basis for the new tender process which it opened to find a new concessionaire.938\n\nClaimants' Memorial, paras. 562-564.\n\n762.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, these expropriations were, in addition, illegal because Peru has not paid any \"prompt, adequate and effective\" compensation to Kuntur Wasi. The Claimants suggest that it is not disputed by Peru that it has never paid Kuntur Wasi for the expropriation of the Claimants' investment and that this alone is enough to prove that the expropriation was unlawful.939\n\nClaimants' Memorial, paras. 566, 567.\n\n763.\n\nThe Claimants also argue that the fact that Peru offered to pay for the EDI does not take away that Peru expropriated the Claimants' investments. According to the Claimants, the Respondent's offer was only made once this arbitration had begun, and it was conditioned on the Claimants' waiver of all claims under this arbitration.940 The Claimants argue that they were not obligated to waive their right to claim for US$ 248 million and accept the mere US$27 million that Peru offered to pay for the EDI. According to the Claimants, the fact that the EDI has not been paid in full to PyC is irrelevant because PyC is a company within Kuntur Wasi's group, and the fact that Kuntur Wasi currently has a debt with a sister company does not justify Peru's lack of payment or preclude the EDI from qualifying as an investment.941\n\nClaimants' Reply, para. 805.\n\nClaimants' Reply, paras. 802-806, 820.\n\n764.\n\nAlthough the Claimants acknowledge that they received another offer from Peru between June and July 2017, the Claimants consider that this offer was also not acceptable or made in good faith because Peru was trying to coerce the Claimants into agreeing to the mutual termination of the Concession Contract. According to the Claimants, this offer was not acceptable because all of the costs to be compensated would have had to be approved by OSITRAN and because it excluded compensation for the damages caused for the termination of the Concession Contract, and as such, it breached the Claimants' rights under the Contract.942\n\nClaimants' Reply, para. 819.\n\n765.\n\nThe Claimants further allege that while the BIT only allowed Peru to expropriate for legitimate public reasons, no such reasons exists in this case. It is the Claimants' case that Peru has not provided a single public interest reason that justified the termination of the Concession Contract and that the MTC formal notice which informed Kuntur Wasi of the termination contains no reasoning to that effect. According to the Claimants, Minister Vizcarra's statement of May 2017 indicating that there was no public interest reason that could allow the State to exit the Contract proves that the termination was not supported by a real public interest concern. With respect to the EDI, the Claimants argue that Peru has not even attempted to provide any explanation as to why it was expropriated.943\n\nClaimants' Memorial, paras. 568-572.\n\n766.\n\nFinally, the Claimants allege that the expropriation was not made in accordance with due process.944 According to the Claimants, the fact that Peru contradicted itself on several occasions meant that the whole process that led to the expropriation of their economic rights was not transparent. Furthermore, the Claimants were not given an opportunity to be heard before Peru took the decision to terminate the Concession Contract; and even when it did, Peru gave no explanations to the Claimants as to why it had reached the conclusion to terminate the Concession Contract.945\n\nClaimants' Memorial, para. 574; Claimants' Reply, para. 825.\n\nClaimants' Memorial, para. 576.\n\n767.\n\nIn response to the Respondent's argument that the termination was not an *act iure imperii* that could constitute an expropriation, the Claimants argue that Peru did not act as a mere contracting party when it terminated the Concession Contract. The Claimants point to the following acts of authority and circumstances which, on its case, support its case for expropriation:946\n\n1. The stark contrast between the exhaustive process that led to Addendum No. 1 (in which OSITRAN, MTC, MEF, Council of Ministers participated)and the termination of the Concession Contract on the other hand, in which only the MTC participated;\n\n2. The fact that the termination of the Concession Contract was not based on the *Contralor\u00eda*'s report but was rather based on political motivation;\n\n3. The repeated statements by the President of the Republic and the Ministers in relation to the Concession Contract;\n\n4. The impeachment process before the Congress in relation to the Concession Contract;\n\n5. The State's threat to the Claimants that their other investments in the country might be prejudiced or in relation to the return of the Concession area; and\n\n6. The seizure of the Claimants' offices and the commencement of criminal investigations, which ultimately destroyed the Project.\n\nClaimants' Reply, para. 790*.* The Claimants also strongly oppose the comparison with the *Convial Callao* case (*see* Claimants' Reply, paras. 791-795).\n\n**(ii)The Respondent's Position**\n---------------------------------\n\n768.\n\nThe Respondent argues that it did not expropriate the Claimants' investment for three reasons:\n\n***(a)Expropriation of the Concession Contract***\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n769.\n\nFirst, according to the Respondent, the MTC terminated the Concession Contract with Kuntur Wasi pursuant to the express terms of that Contract, which allowed the MTC to unilateral terminate for \"well-founded public interest reasons.\" It did so in its capacity as a contracting party, not as a sovereign entity (as evidenced by the fact that the termination was notified to the Claimants through a letter, not through a formal decree or a law).947 On the Respondent's case, tribunals have consistently held that the cancellation of concession contracts by States, when done as contracting parties, do not constitute an expropriation.948 Relying on *Convial Callao v. Peru, Biwater Gauff v. Tanzania* and *Malicorp v. Egypt*, the Respondent argues that the fact that the Concession Contract was terminated for a public interest reason does not imply that the State was exercising some sovereign power, given that the Contract itself is the source of the State's power to terminate for public interest reasons.949\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, para. 305.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, para. 299, citing, among others, **Exhibit RL-43**, *Convial Callao v. Peru*, paras. 496-555; **Exhibit CL-66**, *Biwater Gauff v. Tanzania*, paras. 458-60, 492-93.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, para. 300; **Exhibit RL-43**, *Convial Callao v. Peru*, para. 537.\n\n***(b)Expropriation of the EDI***\n---------------------------------\n\n770.\n\nSecondly, the Respondent argues that it did not expropriate the Claimants' intellectual property rights in the EDI (which the Claimants acquired from PyC)because the Respondent offered to pay to the Claimants the full costs that the Claimants paid to PyC for the EDI, as long as the Claimants could substantiate those costs in accordance with the contractual procedures. The Claimants refused Peru's offer and now claim that the Respondent has not paid any compensation. Furthermore, according to the Respondent, the Claimants have never even paid the full costs to PyC (PyC invoiced US$27 million to Kuntur Wasi for the EDI, and Kuntur Wasi has only paid US$9 million).950\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, para. 306.\n\n771.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, even if the Tribunal were to find that an expropriation occurred, the Respondent would still not have breached the BIT, because the Claimants cannot satisfy the test for proving that an illegal expropriation occurred. The test is three-fold: the Claimants would have to show that the State did not act for a public purpose; that the State did not act in accordance with due process of law; and that the State did not provide prompt, adequate and effective compensation.951\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, para. 307.\n\n772.\n\nWith respect to the first of these elements, the Respondent argues that the MTC terminated the Contract for public interest reasons, namely, to press forward with the construction of the Chinchero Airport that had stalled for years due to the Claimants' inability to finance the project.952\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, para. 308.\n\n773.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, investment treaty tribunals have limited their inquiry into whether a State's actions were actually taken pursuant to the stated public interest, and should not second-guess a State's determination of what is in the public interest and whether the actions taken are the best strategy for achieving that public purpose. In this case, the Claimants have not demonstrated that the MTC's public-interest rationale for terminating the Concession Contract was a mere pretext that concealed a different, actual rationale.953\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, para. 308.\n\n774.\n\nThe Respondent points out that the Claimants do not argue that building the Chinchero Airport was in the public interest; rather, the Claimants' argument is that terminating the Contract was not the best means of achieving that purpose. But the Tribunal is not tasked with determining whether the Respondent's actions best fulfilled the public interest goal: it should only analyze whether there was a public interest and the actions were taken to address that goal. In this case, the facts show that the MTC terminated the Contract because it believed that the Claimants were never going to be able to complete the Project.954\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, para. 309.\n\n775.\n\nWith respect to the Claimants' argument that Minister Vizcarra admitted in 2017 that there was no public-interest reason for terminating the Concession Contract, the Respondent argues that Minister Vizcarra's statements before Congress do not bind Peru. According to the Respondent, the Tribunal cannot attribute to the State the statement of an individual minister debating policy. Moreover, the Respondent argues that Minister Vizcarra's statements were made in May 2017, when the MTC still hoped that it could continue with the Project with the Claimants. In fact, precisely for this reason, Minister Giuffra sat down with the Claimants to try to negotiation a solution to the problem; and it was not until after this unsuccessful negotiation that it became clear to the MTC that the Project could not progress with the Claimants and therefore, the State decided to terminate the Contract for public interest reasons.955\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, para. 310.\n\n776.\n\nThe second criterion of a lawful expropriation under the BIT is that the State takes measures \"in accordance with due process of law.\" The Respondent denies falling short of this requirement. First, contrary to what the Claimants suggest, they were afforded an opportunity to be heard prior to the termination of the Contract. In fact \u2013 the Respondent argues \u2013 the Contract was terminated only after substantial negotiations with the Claimants. These began on 1 June 2017, when Minister Giuffra met with Mr. Vargas and documented certain broad terms (in the *Hoja de Ruta*)that would serve as a basis for moving the Project forward; they also agreed that, if the Parties were unable to reach an agreement on the basis of those broad terms, they would terminate the Contract by mutual agreement. The Claimants thus had sufficient opportunity to explain to the MTC why the best option was to move the Chinchero Airport forward.956\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, paras. 312, 313.\n\n777.\n\nSecondly, the Respondent argues that the Claimants were made aware of the Respondent's reasoning in terminating the Contract. In particular, the 13 July 2017 notification that the MTC sent to Kuntur Wasi explained that the situation was seriously impeding the State's goal of building a new airport for Cuzco, and the Claimants were well aware of the context in which the Contract was being terminated.957\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, para. 314.\n\n778.\n\nFinally, the Respondent argues that it offered to pay the Claimants compensation. According to the Respondent, the Tribunal must look to the circumstances of the negotiations and the Respondent's offer to determine whether the Respondent has complied with the obligation to provide prompt, adequate and effective compensation. In this case, the Respondent argues that it offered the Claimants compensation at least as generous as the explicit terms of the Contract on more than one occasion, including during the June and July 2017 negotiations and again in November 2019 after the MTC had unilaterally terminated the Concession Contract. As to the actual compensation offer, the Respondent explains that it offered to pay: (a)US$8.6 million of the performance bond (*Garant\u00eda de Fiel Cumplimiento*); (b)the cost of the EDI; and (c)the costs of any reasonable and verified amounts invested.958\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, paras. 316, 317.\n\n***b. The Tribunal's Analysis***\n--------------------------------\n\n779.\n\nGiven the Tribunal's determination that the termination of the Concession Contract constituted a breach of both the positive and negative obligations contained in Article 2(3)of the BIT, the Tribunal considers that judicial economy renders it unnecessary for it to decide whether the decision to terminate and subsequent termination also constituted an expropriation of that Contract. This is particularly the case since the Claimants' damage position does not rely on a separate analysis for unlawful expropriation and a breach of FET.\n\n780.\n\nThe Claimants have also asserted that Peru expropriated the EDI. As a result of the Tribunal's decision that Article 2(3)of the BIT has been breached by the Respondent's conduct, the Claimants will be entitled, as discussed *infra* in connection with Damages Section VI.C.(4), to recover damages that are a consequence of those breaches. Inasmuch as the loss of the EDI was a consequence of Peru's unlawful termination of the Concession Contract, as Peru has effectively conceded,959 the Tribunal sees no need to examine whether the EDI was expropriated, either.\n\nPeru has admitted use of the EDI and maintained its offer to compensate the Claimants for it. *See, e.g.,* paras. 515, 516, *supra.*\n\n**(3)Full protection and security**\n-----------------------------------\n\n***a. The Parties' Positions***\n-------------------------------\n\n**(i)The Claimants' Position**\n------------------------------\n\n781.\n\nThe Claimants' fourth claim under the BIT is that Peru breached its obligation to provide the Claimants' investment full protection and legal security at all times.960 According to the Claimants, given that Article 4(1)of the BIT expressly refers to \"*seguridad jur\u00eddica*,\" there is no doubt that this obligation is meant to protect the investment not only from physical harm but also to provide legal security.961\n\nClaimants' Memorial, para. 578.\n\nClaimants' Memorial, para. 580.\n\n782.\n\nThe Claimants further argue that \"seguridad jur\u00eddica\" implies a certain notion of \"protection, pedictability and due reparation within a certain legal framewok, that is, the state undertakes the obligation to guarantee the integrity of the rights acquired by the investor in the legal framework of the state receiving the investment\" [Tribunal's translation];962it implies protection against \"the arbitrary application of the law\" (\"*la aplicaci\u00f3n arbitraria de las leyes*\")[Tribunal's translation];963 and requires certainty in the application of the legal system.964\n\nClaimants' Memorial, para. 581. The original Spanish reads: \"*protecci\u00f3n, previsibilidad y debida reparaci\u00f3n dentro de un marco jur\u00eddico determinado, esto es, el estado adquiere la obligaci\u00f3n de garantizar la integridad de los derechos adquiridos por el inversor en el marco del ordenamiento jur\u00eddico del pa\u00eds que recibe la inversi\u00f3n*.\"\n\nClaimants' Memorial, para. 582.\n\nClaimants' Memorial, para. 582.\n\n783.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, Peru failed to provide legal security and protection to their investments by: (i)terminating the Concession Contract in a manner that was \"sudden, contradictory and arbitrary\" (\"*intempestiva, contradictoria, injustificada y arbitraria*\")[Tribunal's translation];965 (ii)proposing, negotiating and supporting Addendum No. 1 and then later terminating the Concession Contract;966 and (iii)illegally appropriating Kuntur Wasi's EDI, which is its intellectual property, without paying compensation.967\n\nClaimants' Memorial, para. 583.\n\nClaimants' Memorial, para. 584.\n\nClaimants' Memorial, para. 585. *See also* Claimants' Reply, paras. 844-847.\n\n784.\n\nThe Claimants reject the Respondent's argument that, absent an allegation that there is a systemic defect or wrongful change in the State's legal system, State actions that are not discriminatory and consistent with the host State's laws cannot violate the legal security standard.968 According to the Claimants, the purpose of the FPS clause is precisely to impose limits on the State's capacity to take decisions that, albeit consistent with the country's legal framework, breach the State's obligations towards investors.969\n\nClaimants' Reply, paras. 837 *et seq*.\n\nClaimants' Reply, para. 843.\n\n**(ii)The Respondent's Position**\n---------------------------------\n\n785.\n\nThe Respondent does not deny that the BIT's full protection and security standard expressly covers \"legal security\" (\"*seguridad jur\u00eddica*\"). However, the Respondent denies that it failed to provide legal security to the Claimants' investment.970\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, paras. 319, *et seq*.\n\n786.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, there is substantial overlap between the standards for a legal security claim under the FPS provision and the FET provision. The Respondent argues that the Claimants' claim for breach of FPS mirrors their FET claim, and must, consequently, fail for the same reason the FET claim must fail.971\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, paras. 320, 321.\n\n787.\n\nSecondly, the Respondent points out that the Claimants acknowledge that a BIT's promise of legal security does not preclude a host State from taking action that is consistent with the country's legal framework. In the Respondent's view, absent an allegation that there is a systemic defect or wrongful change in a State's legal system itself, State actions that are non-discriminatory and consistent with the host-State's law cannot violate the legal security standard.972 The Respondent further alleges that if a claimant does not challenge the law as such, and if the claimant cannot show that the State's action misapplied the law, there is no violation of the legal security standard, whether or not the State's action was detrimental to the investor. According to the Respondent, investments entail some risks, including the risk that the State may legitimately apply its laws in a manner that is detrimental to the investor's interest.973\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, para. 322.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, para. 324.\n\n788.\n\nIn the Respondent's view, the Claimants cannot make out a legal security claim under this framework, as they cannot show that Peru applied its own laws in a manner that was unfair. Rather, the Respondent argues that Peru acted in accordance with Peruvian law with respect to the Claimants' investment at all times.974\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, para. 325.\n\n***b. The Tribunal's Analysis***\n--------------------------------\n\n789.\n\nThe parties agree that this provision of the BIT extends, by its express terms, to juridical as well as physical, security, but disagree as to the proper interpretation of this standard, including its relationship to the BIT's FET standard. Given the findings of the Tribunal with respect to Article 2(3), the Tribunal considers that for reasons of judicial economy it need not address this claim.\n\n**(4)Umbrella clause**\n----------------------\n\n***a. The Parties' Positions***\n-------------------------------\n\n**(i)The Claimants' Position**\n------------------------------\n\n790.\n\nThe Claimants' final claim under the BIT is that Peru breached the umbrella clause. Given that the Argentina-Peru BIT does not contain an umbrella clause, the Claimants rely on Article 3(1)of the BIT, which sets out the so-called most-favoured-nation provision (\"**MFN provision**\")to import an umbrella clause into the BIT.975 Article 3(1)of the BIT reads as follows:\n\n*Each Contracting Party, once it has admitted in its territory investments of investors of the other Contracting Party, shall provide treatment no less favorable than that granted to investments of its own national investors or of third-country investors, considering whichever is more favorable for investments of investors of the other Contracting Party.*976\n\nClaimants' Memorial, para. 588; Claimants' Reply, para. 848.\n\nThis an English translation taken from Respondent's Counter-Memorial. The Spanish original reads: \"*Cada Parte Contratante, una vez que haya admitido en su territorio inversiones de inversores de la otra Parte Contratante, les acordar\u00e1 un tratamiento no menos favorable que el otorgado a las inversiones de sus propios inversores nacionales o de inversores de terceros Estados, considerando el que sea mas favorable para las inversiones de inversores de 1a otra Parte Contratante*.\" **Exhibit C-50**, Per\u00fa-Argentina BIT, art. 3(1).\n\n791.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, the BIT's MFN clause is particularly wide, in the sense that it does not set out any limitations in relation to the type of standards that may be invoked through its application.977 Furthermore, according to the Claimants, the Respondent's argument that by virtue of the *ejusdem generis* principle, investors may only rely on standards contained in other treaties that are of the same nature as those contained in the BIT in question, leads to absurdity because there would be no benefit in claiming the MFN clause at all.978\n\nClaimants' Reply, para. 851.\n\nClaimants' Reply, para. 854.\n\n792.\n\nOn the basis of the MFN provision, the Claimants argue that Peru breached Article 4(e) of the bilateral investment treaty between Thailand and Peru (the **Umbrella Clause**), pursuant to which:\n\n*Each Contracting Party shall observe any obligation, additional to those specified in this Agreement, into which it may have entered with regard to investments of nationals or companies of the other Contracting.*979\n\nClaimants' Memorial, para. 589, citing **Exhibit CL-112**, Peru-Thailand BIT, art. 4(e): \"*Cada parte contratante cumplir\u00e1 cualquier otra obligaci\u00f3n, adicional a lo especificado en este Convenio, que haya contra\u00eddo con relaci\u00f3n a las inversiones de los nacionales o sociedades de la otra Parte Contratante*.\"\n\n793.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, the aim of umbrella clauses such as this is to extend the BIT protection to obligations that would otherwise not be covered by the BIT, for their contractual nature. In the Claimants' view, the scope of the umbrella clause in the Thailand-Peru BIT is particularly wide, given that it expressly refers to \"any obligation, additional to\" (\"*cualquier otra obligaci\u00f3n, adicional*\"), and covers any commitments the State has entered into with investors.980\n\nClaimants' Memorial, para. 590.\n\n794.\n\nIn this case, the Claimants argue, Peru's breaches of the Concession Contract, including Addendum No. 1 and the Guarantee Agreement are \"*obligaciones*\" entered into by Peru and the Claimants, and amount, pursuant to the umbrella clause, to breaches of the BIT.981\n\nClaimants' Memorial, para. 595; Claimants' Reply, paras. 867 et seq.\n\n**(ii)The Respondent's Position**\n---------------------------------\n\n795.\n\nThe Respondent argues that the Claimants' umbrella clause claim must fail for several reasons:\n\n796.\n\nFirst, there is no umbrella clause in the Argentina-Peru BIT and therefore, there is no basis for asserting an umbrella clause claim. Had the contracting parties wanted to include an umbrella clause in their treaty, they would have done so \u2013 as they did with other treaties that predate the Argentina-Peru BIT.982\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, para. 327.\n\n797.\n\nSecond, the Respondent argues that investment treaty tribunals must determine, on a case-by-case basis, whether the parties to the treaty intended for \"treatment no less favorable\" to reach, and to permit the importation of, an umbrella clause from another BIT. According to the Respondent, an interpretation of the treaty pursuant to Article 31(1)of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties should lead the Tribunal to conclude that it is not possible to introduce an umbrella clause into the BIT through the BIT's MFN provision. In particular, the Respondent points to the absence of an umbrella clause as evidence of the contracting parties' intent that the MFN provision should not extend to umbrella clauses.983\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, para. 330-332.\n\n798.\n\nFurthermore, according to the Respondent, the MFN provision may, at most, be used to import provisions dealing with the same subject matter that is included in the original BIT, according to the well-known *ejusdem generis* principle. In other words, in the Respondent's view, both international treaties would have to contain a provision dealing with the same subject matter.984\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, para. 334.\n\n799.\n\nFinally, the Respondent argues that the Claimants have failed to analyze the specific MFN provision at issue in the BIT. Instead, the Claimants rely on two other investment treaty cases to support their arguments, when in fact, neither of those cases support the Claimants' assertions; and fail to distinguish, or even acknowledge the existence of, cases in which tribunals have declined to import umbrella clauses into a BIT that lacks one via an MFN provision.985\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, para. 336-342.\n\n***b. The Tribunal's Analysis***\n--------------------------------\n\n800.\n\nIn light of the Tribunal's finding that both sentences of Article 2(3)of the BIT have been breached, as well as its decisions regarding jurisdiction and certain claims based on the Concession Contract, the Tribunal considers that there is no need to address the question whether the BIT's MFN clause permits the importation of an umbrella clause from the Peru/Thailand bilateral investment treaty.\n\n**VI. DAMAGES**\n---------------\n\n**Claimants' Damages Submissions**\n----------------------------------\n\n**(1)Compensation under the Contract provisions**\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n***a. The applicable standard***\n--------------------------------\n\n801.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, they are entitled to *full* reparation for Peru's breaches of the BIT, the Concession Contract and the Guarantee Agreement under both Peruvian law *and* international law.986 This was, in the Claimants' view, first and foremost acknowledged by the former Transport Minister, Mart\u00edn Vizcarra, who made the following statement:\n\n*To unilaterally breach the contract would have taken the Government of Peru to an arbitration proceeding at the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID). In the event Peru did not prevail in such proceedings, compensation to be paid to Kuntur Wasi would amount, at least, to USD 8 million plus lost profit under the contract (USD 264.8 million), among other items.987[Tribunal's translation]*\n\nClaimants' Memorial, para. 600; Claimant's Reply, para. 877.\n\n**Exhibit C-33**, *Respuestas al pliego interpelatorio de 83 preguntas formuladas por los Congresistas de la Rep\u00fablica en relaci\u00f3n al proyecto Aeropuerto Internacional de Chinchero \u2013 Cusco*, 18 May 2017, p. 24. The original Spanish reads: \"*Haber roto unilateralmente el contrato hubiese implicado que el Estado incurra en un arbitraje en el Centro Internacional de Arreglo de Diferencias Relativas a Inversiones (CIADI). De perder el caso, la indemnizaci\u00f3n a Kuntur Wasi incluir\u00eda, por lo menos, US$ 8 millones por indemnizaci\u00f3n, m\u00e1s el lucro cesante del contrato (US$264.8mm)entre otros*.\" Claimants' Memorial, paras. 597-599; Claimants' Reply, para. 879.\n\n802.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, compensation for breach of the Concession Contract is to be determined by Peruvian law.988 In this regard, the Claimants argue that the legal basis on which Kuntur Wasi terminated the Concession Contract on 7 February 2018 is Articles 1428 and 1429 of the Peruvian Civil Code and not the termination clauses of the Concession Contract.989 On the Claimants' case, this implies that they are entitled to seek reparation under Article 1321 of the Peruvian Civil Code, which provides that in cases of breach of contract, the standard of compensation is *full* reparation, including the right to claim lost profits;990 and that they are not limited by the compensation provided for under Clause 15 of the Concession Contract.991\n\nClaimants' Memorial, paras. 606, 615. According to the Claimants, Peruvian law is not, however, applicable to the issue of damages resulting from the Respondent's breach of the BIT.\n\nClaimants' Memorial, para. 607; Claimants' Reply, para. 888.\n\nClaimants' Memorial, paras. 603-606, 609, 614; Claimants' Reply, paras. 894, 895, 897. According to the Claimants, Peru does not deny that Peruvian law requires full reparation (Claimants' Reply, para. 897).\n\nClaimants' Memorial, para. 607.\n\n803.\n\nIn relation to Clause 15 of the Concession Contract, the Claimants further argue that even if the Tribunal were to find it applicable, they would not be precluded from claiming lost profits because Clause 15.4.3 only establishes the specific procedure to determine the amounts payable to Kuntur Wasi for costs incurred in the Project in case the contract termination takes place before the commencement of the works; it does not refer to or limit the right to claim for lost profits.992\n\nClaimants' Memorial, paras. 608, 609; Claimants' Reply, para. 889.\n\n804.\n\nFurthermore, even if the Tribunal were to consider that Clause 15.4.3 of the Concession Contract limits the amounts that Peru owes Kuntur Wasi for breach of contract, said clause would not be applicable in cases of *dolo* or *culpa inexcusable* by virtue of Article 1328 of the Peruvian Civil Code.993\n\nClaimants' Memorial, paras. 610-615; Claimants' Reply, paras. 890, 891.\n\n805.\n\nFinally, the Claimants assert that even if the Tribunal considers that Peru's responsibility for breach of the Concession Contract is limited by Clause 15, the Claimants would be entitled to full reparation for Peru's breach of the Guarantee Agreement, which does not contain a similar limitation.994\n\nClaimants' Reply, para. 896.\n\n***b. Assessment of damages***\n------------------------------\n\n806.\n\nThe Claimants and its experts chose not to submit a separate calculation of damages for the breaches based on the Contract terms. Instead, they presented one single assessment of damages based on an income approach which includes lost profits. However, in their second report, the Claimants' quantum experts, Compass Lexecon, responded to the Respondent's damages calculation based on a cost approach.\n\n807.\n\nIn particular, Compass Lexecon argued that the cost valuation of the Respondent's expert, Mr. Kaczmarek, is incomplete and contains errors. In Compass Lexecon's view, these errors are due to the fact that Mr. Kaczmarek fails to properly take into account Kuntur Wasi's historic operating costs based on several asserted grounds for exclusion: that it is either not possible to ascertain whether the costs claimed have contributed to the Concession or to determine whether the costs correspond to investments that are \"compensable\" under the Concession Contract; or the Claimants have not submitted supporting documentation, other than Kuntur Wasi's financial statements.995\n\n**Exhibit CER-4,** Second Compass Lexecon Report, para. 115.\n\n808.\n\nIn response, Compass Lexecon argues that the Concession Contract does not require that payments would have had to \"contribute to the value of the Concession,\" inasmuch as Clause 15.4.3.a of the Contract only refers to \"general expenses\" (\"*gastos generales*\").996 Moreover, in the Claimants' view, a company's financial statements constitute sufficient evidence of the costs incurred, and the fact that they are expressed in a currency other than US$ is not a problem given that the historical exchange rates are publicly available.997\n\n**Exhibit CER-4,** Second Compass Lexecon Report, para. 116.\n\n**Exhibit CER-4,** Second Compass Lexecon Report, para. 119.\n\n809.\n\nTaking the above considerations into account, the Claimants\u2019 experts calculate that if the Tribunal were to apply Clause 15.4.3 of the Concession Contract, the compensation due to the Claimants would amount to US$ 51.2 million, plus US$ 4.9 million for costs related to the construction delays (the recoverability of which, in Compass Lexecon\u2019s view, is a legal issue that falls to be determined by the Tribunal). This amount would have to be updated as of the date of the award, using either the Project\u2019s WACC (7.18%)or the interest rate of the Peruvian Central Bank (average of 4.4%), which would result in US$ 70.3 million or US$ 63.3 million, respectively.998\n\n**Tabla 6: Compensaci\u00f3n Contractual: Terminaci\u00f3n por Culpa de Per\u00fa (millones de US$ nominales)**\n\n|  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|  | **Kaczmarek** | **Corregido** |\n|  |\n| **Garant\u00eda de Fiel Cumplimiento** |\n| **Pago por Garant\u00eda a la Fecha de Resoluci\u00f3n** | **no Incluye** | **8,7** |\n| **Subtotal** | **0,0** | **8,7** |\n| **Gastos Operativos** |\n| **Gastos de Explotaci\u00f3n** | **4,3** | **4,3** |\n| **Mobiliario** | **0,1** | **0,1** |\n| **Subtotal** | **4,4** | **4,4** |\n| **Gastos operativos capitalizados** |\n| **Costos de Asesor\u00eda de Construcci\u00f3n - PROINVERSI\u00d3N** | **no Incluye** | **6,1** |\n| **Impuesto General a las Ventas** | **1,3** | **1,3** |\n| **Costos de Supervisi\u00f3n y Otros - OSITRAN** | **1,1** | **1,1** |\n| **Subtotal** | **2,4** | **8,5** |\n| **Gastos de Capital** |\n| **Estudio Definitivo de Ingenier\u00eda - EDI** | **27,6** | **27,6** |\n| **Gastos de Estructuraci\u00f3n Financiera** | **2,0** | **2,0** |\n| **Subtotal** | **29,5** | **29,5** |\n| **Total** | **36,4** | **51,2** |\n\n*Fuente: Primer Informe Abdala-L\u00f3pez Zadicoff, Secci\u00f3n III.4, Tabla 5, Estados Contables*\n\n*Kuntur Wasi 2014, p. 20; 2015, pp. 5-6, 21, 27; 2016, pp. 5, 29; 2017, pp. 6, 29, 30, 36*\n\n*(CLEX-029).

The applicable standard***\n--------------------------------\n\n820.\n\nWith respect to international law \u2013 which according to the Claimants is applicable to the compensation for breach of the BIT \u2013 the Claimants argue that the BIT does not set out any rule regarding the appropriate redress for any breach of the BIT other than a lawful expropriation. Therefore, the rules that will govern the issue of compensation are to be found in customary international law, which establishes that a State must make *full reparation* if it commits an international wrong. Reparation must wipe out all the consequences of the illegal act and re-establish the situation which would, in all probability, have existed if that act had not been committed.1011 In this particular case, the Claimants argue that the Respondent must pay damages sufficient to compensate them in full for the loss caused by the Respondent's violations of the BIT, including compensation for lost profits.1012\n\nClaimants' Memorial, paras. 616-619, citing among others: **Exhibit CL-122**, *Factory at Chorz\u00f3w* (*Germany v. Poland*), Award, 1927 P.C.I.J. (ser. A)N.\u00b0 13, p. 47; Claimants' Reply, para. 898.\n\nClaimants' Reply, paras. 901, 902.\n\n821.\n\nIn the Claimants' view, the Respondent acknowledges that the Contract's termination clauses do not apply to breaches of the BIT.1013\n\nClaimants' Reply, para. 884, citing Respondent's Counter-Memorial, para. 378, where the Respondent states as follows: \"Unless Claimants can prove that the MTC acted in a sovereign capacity and not as a contractual counterparty exercising rights under the Concession Contract, the termination clauses in the Contract must prevail.\"\n\n822.\n\nThe Claimants and their expert, Compass Lexecon, suggest that the Claimants' lost profits should be calculated on an income approach using the discounted cash flow (\"**DCF**\")methodology. According to the Claimants, the income approach is best suited for this case because, among other reasons, (1)the value of the Concession Contract does not depend on the amounts invested into the Project over the years, but rather on its capacity to generate profits; (2)PROINVERSI\u00d3N itself used a DCF method when assessing the viability of the Project in 2003;1014 (3)the Chinchero Airport will replace the Velasco Airport, which had been operating since 1964 with a track record of air traffic that is particularly useful to calculate this variable for the Chinchero Airport; (4)the cash flows of a concession are easily ascertainable given the regulated tariffs; and (5)the Project had already secured government financing for the initial work required for the construction.1015\n\nClaimants' Memorial, para. 630.\n\nClaimants' Memorial, paras. 631 *et seq.*\n\n823.\n\nIn the Claimants' view, the fact that the Project was at an early stage is no impediment to using the DCF methodology to calculate damages, as is evidenced by the fact that the only two investment treaty cases that have concerned disputes over airport concessions (namely *ADC v. Hungary* and *Flughafen Z\u00fcrich v. Venezuela*)have applied this methodology.1016 The Claimants also find support in the fact that the income from the Concession was guaranteed by the Contract terms, which set out the particular tariffs that Kuntur Wasi would have been able to charge.1017\n\nClaimants' Memorial, para. 632, citing **Exhibit CL-107**, *ADC Affiliate Limited v.

Assessment of damages***\n------------------------------\n\n825.\n\nThe Claimants rely on their economic experts, Dr. Manuel A. Abdala and Mr. Pablo L\u00f3pez Zadicoff of Compass Lexecon LLC, for their assessment of the quantum of the damages caused by Peru's breaches of the BIT, the Concession Contract and the Guarantee Agreement. The Claimants also retained Mr. Rossi of Mott MacDonald as an industry expert for the calculation of air traffic projections.\n\n826.\n\nThe Claimants argue that they are entitled to two categories of damages based on Peru's breaches of the BIT, the Concession Contract and the Guarantee Agreement:\n\n(i)US$244.8 million (plus interest)in lost profits that they would have earned had they been able to complete the Chinchero Airport and related termination expenses;1020 and\n\n(ii)an additional 20% of the principal amount in \"moral damages\" for the harm caused to Corporaci\u00f3n Am\u00e9rica's reputation, due to the termination of the Contract and the alleged harm to certain Kuntur Wasi officers who were subject to criminal investigations in Peru.1021\n\nClaimants' Reply, paras. 877-951\n\nClaimants' Reply, paras. 952-965.\n\n827.\n\nTo quantify damages under category (i), Compass Lexecon calculates the difference between the value of the Concession Contract in a counter-factual scenario under which the Concession Contract has not been breached and the Project's value as of the valuation date of 13 July 2017 (the \"**Present Value**\"). To calculate the hypothetical value of the Claimants' investment, Compass Lexecon estimates the Project's anticipated cash flows and discounts those future cash flows to present value using a discount rate of 7.68% (equivalent to Kuntur Wasi's WACC). Compass Lexecon also deducts the debts toward third-parties (*i.e.,* costs of financing and short-term debt).1022 To calculate the present value, Compass Lexecon adds the costs that the Claimants have incurred or will incur since the date of valuation because of the Contract breach (at present, the Project does not generate any income).1023\n\n**Exhibit CER-1,** First Compass Lexecon Report, para. 77.\n\nClaimants' Memorial, para. 625; **Exhibit CER-1**, First Compass Lexecon Report, paras. 68, 122.\n\n828.\n\nThe following aspects of Compass Lexecon's DCF calculation are either disputed by the Parties or \u2013 as will be explained below \u2013 in the Tribunal's view, too speculative to be determined with sufficient certainty:\n\n**(iii)Aeronautical projections and revenues**\n----------------------------------------------\n\n829.\n\nCompass Lexecon estimated that the main source of income of an airport are the regulated tariffs to be received for a period of 40 years (*i.e.*, 80.9% of the Project's income).1024 To estimate the expected aeronautical revenues of the Chinchero Airport during the term of the Concession Contract, the Claimants rely on Mott MacDonald's estimates for air traffic (flight and passenger)projections.\n\n**Exhibit CER-1,** First Compass Lexecon Report, para. 89.\n\n830.\n\nMott MacDonald's projections are based primarily on historical data of airport traffic to the Velasco Airport (*i.e.,* Cuzco's current airport), with certain adjustments which seek to reflect the information available as of the valuation date (*i.e*., 13 July 2017). In particular, Mott MacDonald's projections consider two limits to the \"unrestrained projections\": (1)the limitations imposed by Peru on the maximum number of tourist visits to certain sites (such as Macchu Picchu); and (2)the capacity restrictions of the projected Airport.1025\n\nClaimants' Memorial, para. 633(b); **Exhibit CER-2,** First Mott MacDonald Report, pp. 16, 17, Figure 10.\n\n831.\n\nBased on these projections, Mott MacDonald estimates that the Chinchero Airport would have received 8.787.927 million passengers (6.175.398 domestic and 2.612.529 international)by the end of the Concession term in 2054.1026\n\nClaimants' Memorial, para. 633 (b); **Exhibit CER-1,** First Compass Lexecon Report, para. 9.\n\n832.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, Mr. Ricover \u2013 the Respondent's air traffic expert \u2013 relies on PROINVERSI\u00d3N's 2013 projections, instead of incorporating data from 2017, leading to methodological flaws. In particular, Mott MacDonald points out that between 2013 and 2016, the observed number of passengers and flights to Cuzco significantly increased by 28.4% above the September 2013 PROINVERSI\u00d3N projections.1027 For these reasons, the Claimants reject the Respondent's \"cap\" of 5.07 million annual passengers starting in 2027.1028\n\n**Exhibit CER-4,** Second Compass Lexecon Reportt, para. 3; **Exhibit RER-4**, First Ricover Report, paras. 7, 8.\n\nClaimants also point out that the PROINVERSI\u00d3N 2013 report projected up to 7.5 million passengers in its optimistic scenario.\n\n833.\n\nMott MacDonald also projects a higher number of international flights as compared to the PROINVERSI\u00d3N 2013 report. The difference, according to Mott MacDonald, is explained by the fact that the Chinchero Airport would not be affected by the operational limitations affecting the current Velasco Airport (related to the occupancy and the types of airplanes that can land in and depart from Cuzco).1029 This would, in Mott MacDonald's view, increase the chances for international flights as opposed to flights arriving from Lima.\n\n**Exhibit CER-1**, First Compass Lexecon Report, para. 87.c); **Exhibit CER-4,** Second Compass Lexecon Report, paras. 4, 44 *et seq*; **Exhibit CER-3**, Second Mott MacDonald Report, Executive Summary, pp. 4-8.\n\n834.\n\nTo calculate the aeronautical revenue of the Chinchero Airport, Compass Lexecon applied the tariffs set out in the Concession Contract to the passenger and flight estimates.\n\n**(iv)Operating costs and operating margin**\n--------------------------------------------\n\n835.\n\nIn the counterfactual scenario, Compass Lexecon includes the operating costs that Kuntur Wasi would have had to pay. Among those costs are administration, maintenance, and surveillance costs, costs associated with the guarantees under Clause 10 of the Concession Contract, fire-fighting costs, and operating costs during the construction phase, etc..1030 According to Compass Lexecon:\n\n\u2022 Its calculation of operating costs is based on PROINVERSI\u00d3N's 2013 estimates included in the feasibility study, adjusted to the valuation date to account for inflation. For the operating costs that are dependent on air-traffic projections, Compass Lexecon adjusted the 2013 PROINVERSI\u00d3N estimates to those of Mott MacDonald;1031\n\n\u2022 Kuntur Wasi had recurrent costs related to the three financial guarantees set out in Clause 10 of the Concession Contract, which amount to US$8.7 million; US$11.6 million and US$19.3 million, respectively, all of which form part of Kuntur Wasi's operating costs throughout the duration of the Concession Contact;1032\n\n\u2022 The calculation should also take into account the operating costs during the construction phase (calculated in the EDI), which amount to US$2.8 million between 2017 and 2021; US$7.8 million in 2022; US$12.6 million in 2023 and up to US$14.7 million in 2032;1033\n\n\u2022 In response to the Respondent's argument that Compass Lexecon's calculations show an operating margin that far exceeds the market standard, Compass Lexecon argues that when interpreted correctly, its damages calculation yields an EBITDA for the Project of 54% for the entire duration of the concession, which is considered a well-accepted margin for other similar airports (as cited by Mr. Ricover)and is below the EBITDA that was considered by PROINVERSI\u00d3N in 2013 (of 63.1%).1034 In particular, the Claimants' experts argued that Mr. Ricover's calculation overstated the EBITDA by not deducting the amounts payable by Kuntur Wasi to Peru for income from the concession rights exceeding US$35 million.1035 The Claimants also allege that, under the Concession Contract, there was no cap on the margins that Kuntur Wasi could earn and that margins across airports vary greatly.1036\n\n**Exhibit CER-1**, First Compass Lexecon Report, para. 97.\n\n**Exhibit CER-1**, First Compass Lexecon Report, para. 98.\n\n**Exhibit CER-1**, First Compass Lexecon Report, para. 99.\n\n**Exhibit CER-1**, First Compass Lexecon Report, paras. 100, 101.\n\n**Exhibit CER-4,** Second Compass Lexecon Report, para. 5.\n\n**Exhibit CER-4,** Second Compass Lexecon Reportt, para. 41.\n\n**Exhibit CER-4,** Second Compass Lexecon Report, para. 41.\n\n**(v)Debts with PyC and other providers**\n-----------------------------------------\n\n836.\n\nTo estimate Kuntur Wasi's net value as of the valuation date, Compass Lexecon deducted the debt obligations that Kuntur Wasi had at the valuation date. In particular, Compass Lexecon explains that at the valuation date, Kuntur Wasi had the following debt obligations for works carried out before Addendum No. 1: (A)US$23.4 million vis-\u00e1-vis PyC for the EDI; (B)US$4.2 million (for consulting services, supplies and working-capital related financing)with other entities related to Kuntur Wasi's shareholders (other than PyC); and (C)US$0.3 million in commercial debt, all of which should be deducted to calculate Kuntur Wasi's net value.1037\n\n**Exhibit CER-1,** First Compass Lexecon Report, paras. 117, 118.\n\n**(vi)NPV**\n-----------\n\n837.\n\nThe Claimants' experts argue that the net present value (\"**NPV\"**)of the Project cannot be zero or close to zero for at least four reasons:\n\n\u2022 In any bidding process, the winning proposal will undoubtedly include the costs incurred to participate in the bid (which for the Chinchero Airport took over 3 years), and that would require the rate of return to be above the cost of capital;\n\n\u2022 In December 2013, PROINVERSI\u00d3N itself acknowledged that the IRR of the Project for a private investor would need to be 10.12% (equivalent to a NPV of US$158.4 million), far higher than the cost of capital, to attract investment;\n\n\u2022 The industry standard is to provide higher rates of returns to entice investments in the sector (especially in cases of greenfield or brownfield investments); and\n\n\u2022 Two relevant changes in market conditions between the bidding process in 2014 and the valuation date (in 2017)increased the Chinchero Airport's profitability and the Project's value: (1)a steady increase in air traffic between 2013 and 2017; and (2)the depreciation of the Peruvian *Sol*.1038\n\n**Exhibit CER-4,** Second Compass Lexecon Report, paras. 58 *et seq*.\n\n838.\n\nTaking all of these factors into account, Compass Lexecon calculates that Kuntur Wasi's net present value in the counterfactual scenario would have been US$ 174 million.\n\n**(vii)Costs incurred after the valuation date**\n------------------------------------------------\n\n839.\n\nTo account for Kuntur Wasi's net present value in the actual scenario (*i.e.,* where the Concession Contract has been terminated), Compass Lexecon adds certain debt obligations that represent costs that have been incurred by Kuntur Wasi because of the breach of the Concession Contract.1039\n\nClaimants' Memorial, paras. 625, 636- 665; **Exhibit CER-1**, First Compass Lexecon Report, paras. 77, 122-124, Table 8.\n\n840.\n\nThe \"real scenario\" includes:\n\n(i)Operational costs for the period between 13 July 2017 to the date when the Concession was transferred back to Peru (US$0.7 million);\n\n(ii)Costs for the EDI and other services by PyC (for a total of US$23.4 million);\n\n(iii)Debts that Kuntur Wasi has with related companies for a value of US$4.2 million and short-term obligations resulting from costs of labor for a total of US$322,000, which together result in a total of US$4.5 million in commercial debts); and\n\n(iv)The \"derivative\" PyC claim, for a total of US$48.5 million, as will be explained in the following section.\n\n**(viii)The derivative PyC Claim**\n----------------------------------\n\n841.\n\nThe Claimants argue that under the Construction Contract with PyC, if Kuntur Wasi were to prevail in this arbitration and receive compensation for lost profits, Kuntur Wasi would be under an obligation to pay lost profits to PyC. To the extent that this obligation only materializes as a result of Peru's wrongful termination of the Concession Contract, in the Claimants' view, Peru should pay for the lost profits potentially due to PyC.1040 The amounts that Kuntur Wasi would have to pay PyC for lost profits under the construction contract total US$48.5 million as of the date of valuation.1041\n\nClaimants' Memorial, paras. 638, 639.\n\nClaimants' Memorial, para. 638; Claimants' Reply, paras. 123, 124.\n\n842.\n\nBased on all of the above considerations, the Claimants valued their damages at US$244.8 million as of the valuation date.1042\n\nClaimants' Reply, para. 951.\n\n**(ix)Interest**\n----------------\n\n843.\n\nFinally, the Claimants submit that interest in this case should be calculated on the basis of Kuntur Wasi's cost of financing in relation to the Chinchero Airport, and that the best way to value that cost of financing is by using its WACC.1043 This results in an interest rate of 7.18%, compounded annually.1044 According to the Claimants, Peru has not denied that it has to pay interest, nor does it object to Compass Lexecon's proposed interest rate in its Counter-Memorial (only Mr. Kaczmarek does)and therefore, this issue is not disputed between the Parties.1045\n\nClaimants' Memorial, para. 669; **Exhibit CER-1**, First Compass Lexicon Report, paras. 129-131.\n\nClaimants' Memorial, para. 671; Claimants' Reply, para. 968.\n\nClaimants' Reply, para. 969. *But see* Claimants' Rejoinder on Jurisidiction, para. 622.\n\n844.\n\nAlternatively, the Claimants ask that the Tribunal uses the average US dollar lending rate in Peru as a \"normal interest rate\" \u2013 as referred in Article 4.3 of the Treaty for expropriation \u2013 which in this case would be 4.4% average between the valuation date and 5 May 2022.1046\n\n**Exhibit CER-4,** Second Compass Lexecon Report, para. 108.\n\n845.\n\nFinally, the Claimants submit that its proposed interest rate is \"within range\" of the alternative interest rates proposed by Mr. Kaczmarek, which result in a rate of 6.35% (in case of the LIBOR + 4 percent)and 6.91% for the US preferential rate + percent.1047\n\n**Exhibit CER-4,** Second Compass Lexecon Report, para. 110.\n\n**(x)Tax Gross Up**\n-------------------\n\n846.\n\nAccording to the Claimants' experts, their calculations are net of the income taxes that the Project would have had to pay in Peru and therefore, any compensation determined by the Tribunal would have to be net of taxes. Were that not the case (*i.e.,* if the compensation to be received by the Claimants is subject to taxes in Peru), the Tribunal would have to award a tax gross up equivalent to the amount of tax levied on the award.1048\n\n**Exhibit CER-1,** First Compass Lexecon Report, para. 13.\n\n**(xi)Moral damages**\n---------------------\n\n847.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, Peru's actions harmed their image, honor and reputation and as such the Respondent must compensate Kuntur Wasi for moral damages under both Peruvian and international law.1049\n\nClaimants' Memorial, paras. 641, 642; Claimants' Reply, paras. 952 *et seq*.\n\n848.\n\nIn the Claimants' view, under Peruvian law, a claim for damages would, in general have to show: (1)the breach of contract or illicit act; (2)the damage; (3)the causal link; and (4)*culpa* or *dolo*.1050 However, in case of damage to the Claimants' reputation, it would be enough to prove the existence of defamatory acts, as this would in itself prove the illicit conduct, the harm and the causal relation.1051\n\nClaimants' Memorial, para. 643.\n\nClaimants' Memorial, para. 643.\n\n849.\n\nUnder international law, the Claimants argue that the principle of *full* reparation, as embodied in Article 31(2)of the Articles on State Responsibility, in the jurisprudence of the ICJ and of investment treaty tribunals, requires payment of moral damages.1052\n\nClaimants' Memorial, paras. 647-653.\n\n850.\n\nTurning to the facts of the case, the Claimants argue that Peru committed at least two acts which should give rise to moral damages in this case:\n\n\u2022 The *Fiscal\u00eda*'s criminal investigations into Kuntur Wasi's employees, which according to the Claimants were abstract and not very clear and which were later found by the judiciary to not to be sufficiently specific.1053 The Claimants argue that through or as a result of these investigations, Peru harassed Kuntur Wasi's employees and limited the rights of Kuntur Wasi's employees;\n\n\u2022 Secondly, the Claimants complain that Peru's \"arbitrary\" termination of the Concession Contract will have a negative impact on future tender processes in which Corporaci\u00f3n Am\u00e9rica decides to participate. That is because most tender processes require a confirmation that the bidder has never had a contract cancelled by a State.1054\n\nClaimants' Memorial, paras. 656-659; Claimants' Reply, paras. 955, 961.\n\nClaimants' Memorial, para. 662; Claimants'Reply, para. 956.\n\n851.\n\nBased on these arguments, the Claimants claim moral damages for a total of 20% of the total damages calculated by Compass Lexecon.1055\n\nClaimants' Reply, para. 964.\n\n**B. Respondent's Damages Submissions**\n---------------------------------------\n\n**(1)Compensation under the Contract provisions**\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n***a. The applicable standard***\n--------------------------------\n\n852.\n\nThe Respondent argues that the Concession Contract contemplated six different ways in which the Contract could be terminated and for each of those scenarios the Contract set out the consequences that would follow.1056 Out of those six scenarios, only three are relevant in this case (explained below)and none contemplated that Kuntur Wasi could claim for lost profits.\n\nRespondents' Counter-Memorial, paras. 256 *et seq*; Respondent's Rejoinder, paras. 560*,* 566-571.\n\n853.\n\nAs explained above, the Respondent's case on the merits is that the MTC terminated the Concession Contract for reasons of public interest. Pursuant to the express terms of the Contract, in case of termination for a public purpose, the compensation that the State would have to provide to Kuntur Wasi would be limited to (i)an amount equivalent to the performance guarantee bond in place at the time of termination (and in this case, the MTC terminated the Concession Contract during the pre-operational stage of the Project when the performance guarantee bond in place was US$8,687,826); and (ii)return to Kuntur Wasi any outstanding performance bonds.1057\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, paras. 352, 358-361; Respondent's Rejoinder, para. 554; **Exhibit C-4**, Concession Contract, Cl. 15.5.3, 15.5.5 and 10.2.2; **Exhibit RER-1**, First Kaczmarek Repor**t**, para. 70.\n\n854.\n\nEven if the Tribunal accepts that Kuntur Wasi terminated the Concession Contract due to the MTC's contractual breach \u2013 as Kuntur Wasi alleges \u2013 the Concession Contract specified that Kuntur Wasi would only be entitled to the reasonable and verified amounts invested in the Project that OSITRAN had assessed and approved pursuant to Clause 15.1058\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, paras. 352, 362; Respondent's Rejoinder, para. 554; **Exhibit C-4,** Concession Contraact, Cl. 15.4.1, 15.4.3(a); **Exhibit RER**-1, First Kaczmarek Report, paras. 229, 239.\n\n855.\n\nThe third potential scenario which could be of relevance in this case is one in which Kuntur Wasi and the MTC terminated the Concession Contract by mutual agreement, in which case the compensation would be any amounts agreed between the parties and reviewed and approved by OSITRAN.1059\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, para. 560.\n\n856.\n\nTherefore, none of the potentially applicable termination clauses gave the Claimants the right to demand lost profits for the Chinchero Airport following termination of the Concession Contract.1060\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, paras. 352, 356-357; Respondent's Rejoinder, para. 560.\n\n857.\n\nIn Respondent's view, the Claimants have presented no legitimate reason why the Tribunal should set aside these contractual limitations and instead order Peru to pay US$248 million in lost profits:1061\n\n(i)The Claimants have not shown that the Respondent has committed wilful misconduct or acted in a grossly negligent manner, as defined in Peruvian law, such as to allow excluding the limitations of liability contained in the Contract.1062 In particular, the Respondent argues that to circumvent the contractual limitations, the Claimants would have to show that the MTC intentionally breached the Concession Contract and terminated knowing that it had no public interest rationale to terminate, which they have not done.1063\n\n(ii)The Respondent also takes issue with the Claimants' characterization of Mr. Vizcarra's statement as an admission that Peru would have to pay lost profits. In Respondent's view, Mr. Vizcarra's statement was \"merely defending a policy position that Addendum No. 1 would help to advance the stalled Project\" and \"cannot represent a definitive interpretation of the Concession Contract or Peruvian law and should hold no persuasive value before this Tribunal.\"1064\n\n(iii)According to the Respondent, the Claimants argue that they can claim lost profits because the Respondent also breached the Guarantee Agreement, which contains no limitation on damages. In response, the Respondent argues that: (i)in the Guarantee Agreement, Peru renounced its right to use its sovereign capacity to breach the Concession Contract and Peru never implicated its State sovereignty in terminating the Contract; and (ii)in any event, the Guarantee Agreement is nothing more than an affirmation that Peru would abide by the terms of the Concession Contract, but cannot be used to repudiate Clause 15 of the Concession Contract.1065\n\n(iv)Finally, the Respondent disputes the Claimants' contention that the legal basis invoked for the termination was Peruvian civil law rather than the Contract, and that the Contract does not expressly prohibit Kuntur Wasi from seeking lost profits. In Respondent's view, the obvious intent of the Parties, as evidenced by the plain language of the Contract, was to limit and specify any compensation owed for Contract termination and the Claimants cannot circumvent these merely by invoking Peruvian law.1066\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, para. 554, 561;\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, para. 375; Respondent's Rejoinder, paras. 578 *et seq*.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, paras. 578, 579.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, para. 376. *See also* Respondent's Rejoinder, para. 582.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, para. 581.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, para. 580.\n\n***b. Assessment of damages***\n------------------------------\n\n**(i)Compensation in case of termination for public purpose**\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n858.\n\nRespondent's main case is that the MTC terminated the Contract for public interest reasons in accordance with the terms of the Contract. In that scenario, Clauses 15.5.1 and 15.5.3 of the Contract provide that Kuntur Wasi would be paid for the value of the performance bond. The performance bond during the pre-construction and construction stages was US$ 8.7 million, which Peru has offered to pay Kuntur Wasi.1067\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, para. 567; **Exhibit RER-1,** First Kaczmarek Report, Table 4 (p. 49).\n\n859.\n\nIn addition, because Peru intends to use the EDI developed by Kuntur Wasi for the Project, it has also offered (and has expressed that it is still willing to pay for)the costs incurred by Kuntur Wasi to develop the EDI.1068 However, the Respondent argues that although the documentation submitted by Kuntur Wasi shows that PyC invoiced US$27 million for the EDI, Kuntur Wasi has only paid US$9 million for it; and therefore, Claimants are only entitled to the US$9 million actually paid (or else, it would be unjust enrichment).1069\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, para. 568.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, para. 569.\n\n860.\n\nIf the Tribunal were to accept, however, that the Respondent also has to pay for the remaining amounts allegedly due to PyC for the EDI (*i.e.,* US$18.6 million), and the Claimants submitted proof of these costs, then, according to the Respondent's calculation, the total amount of compensation due to Kuntur Wasi would be US$36.3 million for the unilateral termination of the Concession Contract by the Respondent plus the performance bond.1070\n\n**Exhibit RER-1,** First Kaczmarek Report, Table 4 (p. 49); **Exhibit RER-5,** Second Report Kaczmarek, para. 178.\n\n**(ii)Compensation in case of breach by the MTC**\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n861.\n\nThe Respondent argues that even if the Tribunal were to find that Kuntur Wasi terminated the Concession Contract due to the MTC's breaches, the appropriate compensation is clearly defined in Clauses 15.4.1 and 15.4.3(a)of the Contract: amounts invested as proven to and approved by OSITRAN.1071\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, para. 362; Respondent's Rejoinder, paras. 572 *et seq*.\n\n862.\n\nYet, the Respondent asserts, Kuntur Wasi never submitted its investment costs to OSITRAN for review and approval, not has Kuntur Wasi submitted them to this Tribunal to assess and adjudicate. According to the Respondent, OSITRAN's review was crucial because it sought to ensure that the costs submitted by Kuntur Wasi were reasonably substantiated and actually incurred. Therefore, if the Tribunal were to award damages on the basis of investment costs, it would need to assess these factors itself, standing in the shoes of OSITRAN.1072\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, para. 363.\n\n863.\n\nFurthermore, turning to the actual calculation of costs, the Respondent complains that Kuntur Wasi has not provided adequate documentation to support its alleged expenses.1073 In this sense, the Respondent emphasizes that Kuntur Wasi's financial statements are not sufficient proof to substantiate the costs incurred. To illustrate this, the Respondent points out that although the amount of the total costs claimed by Kuntur Wasi appear as liabilities on Kuntur Wasi\u2019s accounting records for the year 2017, the balance sheet reflects accounts payable related to these expenditures for US$27.9 million only. This leads the Respondent to conclude that Kuntur Wasi would only have made payments for nearly 60 percent of its alleged expenses.1074 Furthermore, Mr. Kaczmarek also takes issue with the absence of evidence on the exchange rates utilized to convert costs to US dollars.1075\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, paras. 364-366.\n\n**Exhibit RER-1,** First Kaczmarek Report, para. 75.\n\n**Exhibit RER-1,** First Kaczmarek Report, paras. 150, 182.\n\n864.\n\nIn light of this, the Respondent explains that its assessment of costs incurred is preliminary and would need to be updated once the Claimants present further proof. In Respondent\u2019s view, this documentation would be crucial to assessing whether each of the claimed cost items contributed to the value of the concession and whether each reflects an investment consistent with the definition of the terms set out in the Concession Contract.1076\n\n**Exhibit RER-1,** First Kaczmarek Report, para. 148.\n\n865.\n\nBearing these preliminary objections in mind, the below table summarizes the Respondent\u2019s preliminary views on the costs incurred by the Claimants:1077\n\n**Table 2 - Summary of Kuntur Wasi\u2019s Alleged Investment (2014-2017)**\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| US$ millions **Cost Description** | **Claimed Investment** | **compensable Under Contract** | **Compensation for Peru's Braech** | **Costs Paid to Advance Project** | **Compensation Under BIT** |\n| Operating Costs |  |  |  |  |  |\n| Operating Expenses | 4.3 | Possibly | 4.3 | Possibly | 4.3 |\n| Furniture | 0.1 | Possibly | 0.1 | Possibly | 0.1 |\n| **Total Operating costs** | **4.4** |  | **4.4** |  | **4.4** |\n| Capitalized Operating Costs |  |  |  |  |  |\n| Advisory Costs Related to Tender Process | 6.1 | No | 0 | No | **0** |\n| Sales Taxes | 1.3 | Possibly | 1.3 | Possibly | 1.3 |\n| OSIIRAN Supervision Costs | 1.1 | Possibly | 1.1 | Possibly | 1,1 |\n| **Total Capitalized Operating Costs** | **8.5** |  | **2.4** |  | **2.4** |\n| Capital Expenditures |  |  |  |  |  |\n| Engineering Study | 27.6 | Possibly | 27.6 | Possibly | 27.6 |\n| Financial Structuring Costs | 2.0 | Possibly | 2.0 | No | 0 |\n| Construction Delay Related Costs | 4.9 | No | 0 | No | 0 |\n| **Total Capital Expenditures** | **34.5** |  | **29.6** |  | **27.6** |\n| **Total Investment** | **47.4** |  | **36.4** |  | **34.4** |\n\n**Exhibit RER-5,** Second Repoty Kaczmarek, Table 2.\n\n866.\n\nOut of the total of US$47.4 million (later updated to US$51.2 million)of operating expenses and capital expenditures calculated by Compass Lexecon between 2014 and 2017, the largest component is the US$27.6 million that Kuntur Wasi allegedly owed to PyC in relation to the engineering study produced in 2014 and 2015.1078 In relation to this item, Respondent alleges that although it would in principle be willing to pay Kuntur Wasi for the incurred engineering costs (if and when substantiated), only approximately US$9 million of those were actually paid by Kuntur Wasi to PyC for the EDI. The remaining amounts were invoiced by PyC to Kuntur Wasi for the EDI, but Kuntur Wasi has not provided evidence of having paid them.1079\n\n**Exhibit CER-1,** First Compass Lexecon Report, Table 5.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, paras. 360 (footnote 677), 368; **Exhibit RER-1,** First Kaczmarek Report, paras. 75, 151; **Exhibit RER-5,** Second Kaczmarek Report, paras. 177-178; **Exhibit CLEX-11**, PyC, Letter 2019-PIC, 20 February 2019, pp. 2, 3 as support for the proposition that Kuntur Wasi has only paid USD 9 million. Although these authorities put the paid amount at USD 9 million, the amount actually appears to be USD 9.3 million. *See* Respondent's Counter-Memorial, para. 369, footnote 693, citng to **Exhibit RER-1**, First Kaczmarek Report, para. 151.\n\n867.\n\nThe remaining US$ 20 million in expenditures listed in Compass Lexecon's First Report consists of:\n\n(i)US$6.1 million for \"*consulting and structuring costs of the company and the tender offer*\" which, according to the Respondent, are costs associated with the tender process that are not compensable under the bidding terms and which, in any event, predate the investment and cannot be considered related to work on the Project;1080\n\n(ii)US$4.9 million in amounts owed to PyC for \"*other construction costs payable to PyC*\" which according to the Respondent are not compensable because they correspond to construction delays that Claimants have not proven to be attributable to Peru and which Kuntur Wasi and the MTC already agreed would not be passed on to Peru.1081 Furthermore, according to the Respondent, these costs appear to be costs that PyC has recorded but have not been paid by Kuntur Wasi, \"such that they are likely subsumed under the total US$27.9 million of accounts payable\" (see para. 859 *supra*).1082\n\n(iii)US$ 2 million of \"financial structuring costs,\" which, according to the Respondent appeared to have been incurred in connection with the original construction financing package that the MTC rejected. In the Respondent's view, this is not a legitimate and justified cost because it relates to a financing package that was unreasonable and ultimately rejected and it ultimately did not add any value to the Project.1083 However, Mr. Kaczmarek includes it as an item that might \"possibly\" be compensable under the Contract.1084\n\n(iv)US$4.4 million of operating costs; US$ 1.1 million of OSITRAN Supervisory costs; US$1.3 million of unrecoverable sales taxes. Although the Respondent's expert accepts that these might \"possibly\" be compensable under the Contract in case of breach, it argues that the Claimants have not submitted proof to show that these amounts were actually paid.1085\n\n(v)Taking into account all of the above adjustments, the Respondent submits that the Claimants would be entitled to damages of approximately US$ 34.4 million for costs incurred in the Project in case of breach of the Concession Contract, provided that they submit sufficient supporting documentation of these costs.1086\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, para. 367; **Exhibit RER-5**, Second Kaczmarek Report, para. 179. **Exhibit C-18**, Final Bidding Terms, Cl. 4.5.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, para. 366; **Exhibit RER-5**, Second Kaczmarek Report, para. 179. **Exhibit C-31**, *Acta de Acuerdo, Suspensi\u00f3n Temporal de Obligaciones Contractuales*, 2 March 2017, p. 4.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, para. 366.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, para. 367.\n\n**Exhibit RER-1,** First Kaczmarek Report, para. 149 and Table 3 (p. 47).\n\n**Exhibit RER-1**, First Kaczmarek Report, paras. 75, 147.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, para. 368; **Exhibit RER-1,** First Kaczmarek Report, Table 4 (p. 49); **Exhibit RER-5,** Second Kaczmarek Report, Table 2 (p. 54).\n\n868.\n\nFinally, in its Second Report, Compass Lexecon provided an alternative calculation under Clause 15.4.3 of US$51.2 million, in which they excluded US$4.9 million in construction delay costs \u2013 because this is an issue of legal interpretation that would require determination by the Tribunal \u2013 but included the performance guarantee bond of US$8.7 million as an additional cost.1087 In Mr. Kaczmarek's view, however, the performance guarantee bond US$8.7 million is not compensable under Clause 15.4.3.1088\n\n**Exhibit CER-4,** Second Compass Lexecon Report, para. 120.\n\n**Exhibit RER-1,** First Kaczmarek Report, para. 182.\n\n**(2)Compensation for breach of the BIT and international law**\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\n***a. The applicable standard***\n--------------------------------\n\n869.\n\nWith respect to international law, the Respondent's argument is twofold: First, that there is no need in this case to resort to the standard for compensation under international law at all because even if the Tribunal were to determine that the MTC's termination of the Contract breached the BIT, the Concession Contract already provides remedies for termination of the Contract in such scenario.1089 Therefore, according to the Respondent, unless the Claimants can prove that the MTC acted in a sovereign capacity, the termination clauses in the Contract must prevail.1090\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, para. 378.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, para. 378; Respondent's Rejoinder, para. 583.\n\n870.\n\nSecondly, even if the Tribunal considered that international law warrants a departure from the contractually-mandated compensation, the Respondent argues that the standard of *full* reparation does not require the Tribunal to award lost profits as the standard compensation for a breach of international law.1091 In fact, according to the Respondent, awarding damages based on Claimants' income approach would risk awarding Claimants a windfall and speculative profits and would put the Claimants in a better position than they originally were in *but for* the breach.1092 According to the Respondent, at the time of termination, the Claimants did not have an operational business venture and substantial doubts existed as to whether the Claimants would ever be able to complete the Chinchero Airport and earn profits because Kuntur Wasi had neither obtained adequate financing to complete the Project, nor had it begun construction of the Chinchero Airport (and even if Kuntur Wasi had obtained construction financing, that does not mean that the MTC would have approved the package).1093\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, para. 377; Respondent's Rejoinder, para. 583.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, para. 379; Respondent's Rejoinder, paras. 555, 562, 584 *et seq*.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, paras. 379, 380; Respondent's Rejoinder, para. 562, 584-587. On the Respondent's case, the terms of the Concession Contract do not contain any binding contractual revenue obligation that establish the expectation of profit at a certain level. The terms of the Concession Contract do not reduce the uncertainty in this case that Kuntur Wasi would never obtain the financing to begin the construction.\n\n871.\n\nInstead, the appropriate valuation approach in this case would be the cost approach, which calculates the value that Claimants invested into the Project and adds a reasonable profit.1094 According to the Respondent, the cost approach is a more straight-forward and accurate measure of the fair market value of the Concession Contract on the date it was terminated given the limited progress that had been made to advance the Project.1095\n\n**Exhibit RER-5**, Second Kaczmarek Report, para. 12.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, para. 564.\n\n***b. Assessment of damages***\n------------------------------\n\n**(i)Income approach**\n----------------------\n\n872.\n\nMoreover, the Respondent argues that the Claimants' DCF lost profits model is not an appropriate measure of damages in this case because of the fundamental conceptual errors described below.1096\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, para. 381; Respondent's Rejoinder, paras. 589, 593 *et seq*.\n\n***(a)Aeronautical projections and revenues***\n----------------------------------------------\n\n873.\n\nOn Respondent's case, the Claimants overestimate the number of international and domestic passenger flights that would utilize the Chinchero Airport.1097 Mr. Ricover points out that the projections from the MTC studies in 2017 on which Claimants rely were subsequently revised downward by 700,000 passengers per year.1098\n\n**Exhibit RER-4**, First Ricover Report, paras. 48-81.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, para. 610.\n\n874.\n\nMoreover, Mr. Ricover also considers that it is speculative and unlikely that international traffic would increasingly route through the Chinchero Airport because, in his view, most international travelers would still enter Peru through Lima, which is not only a regional \"hub,\" but also a gateway for travelers from North and South America.1099\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, para. 611.\n\n875.\n\nIn Mr. Ricover's view, the Claimants overestimate the number of visitors who would be permitted to visit the Macchu Picchu historical site, given the restrictions imposed by Peru on visitors. According to Mr. Ricover, because Macchu Picchu remains the driving force for tourism in the Cuzco region, government restrictions would limit travel to the Chinchero Airport.\n\n876.\n\nAdapting for these flaws, and using Mr. Ricover's projections, results in a fair market value of US$48.4 million under the DCF approach.1100\n\n**Exhibit RER-5**, Second Kaczmarek Report, paras. 12, 139.\n\n***(b)Operating costs and operating margin***\n---------------------------------------------\n\n877.\n\nIn the Respondent's view, Compass Lexecon has underestimated the Chinchero Airport's operating costs. Mr. Ricover explains in this report that it is common practice in the industry to compare operating margins to assess whether the operating costs have been properly accounted for.1101 In this case, the operating margin that results from Compass Lexecon's model is between 71.8% and 90.0% in 2053 (due both to the overestimation of the number of flights and the aeronautical revenues resulting therefrom and to the underestimation of costs).1102 According to Mr. Kaczmarek and Mr. Ricover, a comparison of the operating margins of 56 different airport operators and 200 different airports show that the average operating costs are 45.8%; Corporaci\u00f3n Am\u00e9rica's operating margin for its other airports between 2013 and 2016 was 29.5%. Therefore, in Respondent's view, the operating costs estimated by Compass Lexecon are not reasonable.1103\n\n**Exhibit RER-4,** First Ricover Report, paras. 18, 19.\n\n**Exhibit RER-5,** Second Kaczmarek Report, paras. 127-137.\n\n**Exhibit RER-4,** First Ricover Report, para. 20.\n\n878.\n\nAssuming an operating margin of 45%, Mr. Ricover calculated that the Chinchero Airport would have the following operating costs:\n\n**Figura 13 - Comparaci\u00f3n de las proyecciones de costos operativos de CL y Ricover**\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Costos operativos (USD m) | **2023** | **2029** | **2035** | **2041** | **2047** | **2053** |\n| *Compass Lexecon* | 12,6 | 13,9 | 15,7 | 17,7 | 19,9 | 22,2 |\n| *Ricover* | 23,5 | 32,7 | 37,3 | 42,5 | 48,4 | 55,2 |\n\nFuente: Anexo CLEX-08, Medelo de Valuaci\u00f3n CL; Ricover Business Model\n\nNota: no se incluyen los montos de los a\u00f1os 2022 y 2054 al tratarse de periodos con \u00fanicarnente 6 meses de operaci\u00f3n\n\n879.\n\nResponding to the Claimants, Mr. Ricover argues that it would not be appropriate to account for the regulatory costs that Kuntur Wasi was obligated to pay to the Peruvian State under the Concession Contract when comparing airport operations because those costs will vary greatly across different countries.1104 Furthermore, according to Mr. Kaczmarek, Compass Lexecon confuses EBITDA margin (a comparison of revenues with operating costs and regulatory costs)with \"operating margin\" (which is a comparison of operating costs and revenues), whereas only the second is relevant, given that regulatory costs between airports vary greatly for reasons that have no connection to market conditions.1105\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, paras. 613-615.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, paras. 613-615; **Exhibit RER-8,** Second Ricover Report, paras. 269-277.\n\n***(c)NPV***\n------------\n\n880.\n\nAccording to Mr. Kaczmarek, correcting Compass Lexecon's air-traffic and operating cost projections with those of Mr. Ricover (as described above), Compass Lexecon's projections yield a logical NPV result (at US$51.4 million as of the valuation date), which approximates Claimants' expenditures in the Project.1106 This, in Respondent's view, is further evidence that the cost approach would be the proper valuation technique to adopt in this case.\n\n**Exhibit RER-1,** First Kaczmarek Report, paras. 183 *et seq*. In fact, all other aspects of Compass Lexecon's model were left unchanged.\n\n881.\n\nHowever, absent these corrections to the air-traffic and operating cost projections, the Respondent and Mr. Kaczmarek argue that the Claimants' valuation of the Concession (at US$195.6 million)significantly overstates the fair market value of the Project. According to Mr. Kaczmarek, Compass Lexecon seeks to justify its calculation by suggesting that the Concession already had a value of US$158.4 million on the date it was awarded. This, in Mr. Kaczmarek's view fails for reasons of basic economic logic.\n\n882.\n\nIn particular, Mr. Kaczmarek takes the view that it is undisputed that the Concession was uneconomic and loss-making (thus, with a negative NPV), but given that Peru wanted the Airport to be built (for other non-economic reasons), it agreed to subsidize the Project.1107 It is logical to assume that Kuntur Wasi's winning bid required the smallest subsidy needed to convert the negative NPV project into a zero or near-zero NPV project. According to the Respondent, Mr. Kaczmarek's calculation is backed by a September 2013 report from PROINVERSI\u00d3N, which concluded that the Project's NPV was negative US$272 million and with the subsidies provided by Peru, the NPV would reach zero or near zero.1108 Any private investor would undertake a Project with an NPV of zero, given that it would need to earn an acceptable profit, or an IRR on the Project, equal to its WACC.1109\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, para. 593; **Exhibit RER-5**, Second Kaczmarek Report, para. 8.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, para. 596, citing **Exhibit CLEX-21**, PROINVERSI\u00d3N, *Perfil Aeropuerto Chincheri, An\u00e1lisis T\u00e9cnico,* Vol. 3, September 2013, pp. 50, 51, 67.\n\n**Exhibit RER-5**, Second Kaczmarek Report, para. 9.\n\n883.\n\nCompass Lexecon's reliance on a December 2013 PROINVERSI\u00d3N study to argue that the Project's initial NPV was US$158.4 million is inapposite, as that analysis cited by the Claimants refers to the combined NPV for private investors and the State (whereas the NPV for the private investor alone in that report was estimated at US$71).1110 In any event, Mr. Kaczmarek suggest that the December 2013 study was prepared before the bidding took place; and that the results of the bidding process would only be reflected in the bid model prepared by Kuntur Wasi, which the Claimants have chosen not to disclose.1111\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, para. 597; **Exhibit RER-5**, Second Kaczmarek Report, paras. 9, 51.\n\n**Exhibit RER-5**, Second Kaczmarek Report, para. 9.\n\n884.\n\nGiven his conclusion that the initial NPV of the Project was close to zero, Mr. Kazmarek argues that Compass Lexecon has failed to explain how the value of the Concession Contract increased to the extent submitted by Claimants.1112 Mr. Kazmarek explains that the NPV would have increased as the Claimants invested in the Project, yet Claimants' investment costs only amount to US$34 million. Even adding in Claimants' costs during the bidding process (US$6.1 million, as discussed below)and the improved market factors (which allegedly increased the NPV by US$8 million, also as discussed below), would leave approximately US$ 150 million as the extra subsidies that Peru provided to Claimants to take on the Project.1113 This would mean that the Claimants presume that Peru needed to give Kuntur Wasi a \"free\" US$158 million in profits as a subsidy to entice Kuntur Wasi to take on the Project, something which the Respondent regards as \"entirely unjustified.\"1114\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, paras. 594, 595.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, para. 595.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, para. 563. Mr. Kaczmarek also points out that when modeling a hypothetical sale of the Concession as of 13 July 2017, Compass Lexecon assumes the buyer would not require any free value (*see* **Exhibit RER-5**, Second Kaczmarek Report, para. 10).\n\n***(d)Bidding costs***\n----------------------\n\n885.\n\nThe Respondent and Mr. Kaczmarek also dispute Compass Lexecon's assumption that bidding costs should be reimbursed as part of the value of the Concession.1115 According to the Respondent, the bidding terms expressly state that the costs to prepare the bid were to be borne by the bidders.1116\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, para. 601. **Exhibi**t **RER-5**, Second Kaczmarek Report, para. 11.\n\n**Exhibit RER-5**, Second Kaczmarek Report, para. 11.\n\n***(e)Impact of market changes***\n---------------------------------\n\n886.\n\nFinally, Mr. Kaczmarek concludes that the two market conditions that the Claimants identify as having increased the Project's NPV do not affect his analysis. According to Mr. Kaczmarek, the relevant point of comparison for the increase in air traffic is not what Peru expected in the bidding process, but rather what Kuntur Wasi included in its financial proposal, of which the Claimants' have not submitted any proof.1117 With respect to the change in value of the Peruvian *Sol,* Respondent argues that the Claimants have not explained how this change reduced Kuntur Wasi's operating costs.1118\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, para. 606.\n\n**Exhibit RER-5**, Second Kaczmarek Report, para. 11.\n\n***(f)Costs incurred after the valuation date***\n------------------------------------------------\n\n887.\n\nRespondent's arguments in relation to the costs incurred after the valuation date included in Compass Lexecon's calculation have been summarized above (*supra*, paras. 877 *et seq*.).\n\n**(ii)The derivative PyC Claim**\n--------------------------------\n\n888.\n\nIn relation to the derivative PyC Claim, the Respondent argues that the Claimants have not identified any obligation that would require Peru to compensate Kuntur Wasi for a contractual debt that Kuntur Wasi might owe to its contractor, PyC. Kuntur Wasi cannot bind the Peruvian State to pay its contractor, nor can it increase the alleged harm it suffered by promising to compensate a third party and demand money from Peru. The Respondent also points out that the construction contract explicitly states that Kuntur Wasi's obligation to pay PyC US$48.5 million would only arise if these funds were \"specifically included in the compensation granted to Kuntur Wasi.\"1119\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, para. 618.\n\n889.\n\nFinally, the Respondent points out that this contingent liability is particularly problematic in light of the Claimants' revelation that PyC is a company exclusively owned by the two shareholders in Kuntur Wasi. The Respondent reads this as a manipulation by Kuntur Wasi, which seeks to increase its damages claim by exchanging promises between related entities and passing on the bill to Peru.1120\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, para. 619.\n\n**(iii)Cost approach**\n----------------------\n\n890.\n\nAs explained above, the Respondent's view is that if the Tribunal were to find that Peru breached the BIT, damages should be assessed using a cost approach in which the Concession is valued according to the amounts invested to advance the Project, plus a reasonable entrepreneurial profit. The entrepreneurial profit refers to the profit a project developer would expect as reimbursement for moving the Project three years closer to operation.1121\n\n**Exhibit RER-5,** Second Kaczmarek Report, para. 12.\n\n891.\n\nMr. Kaczmarek calculates that the fair market value of the Project under the cost approach is US$43.6 million, which results from expenditures of US$34.4 million (albeit not substantiated), plus US$9.2 million in entrepreneurial profit.1122\n\n**Exhibit RER-5**, Second Kaczmarek Report, paras. 12, 140. Mr. Kaczmarek argues, however, that the Claimants have not provided sufficient evidence to substantiate the amounts Claimants allegedly invested (**Exhibit RER-5**, Second Kaczmarek Report, para. 13.)*See also* Respondent's Rejoinder, para. 621.\n\n892.\n\nThe entrepreneurial profit calculation is based on the average of two calculations: the Claimants' WACC over the three years they managed the Project, and a revised DCF comparison.1123 The first of these calculations yields a total profit of 25.62%, which, applied to US$34.4 million, amounts to an entrepreneurial profit of US$8.8 million (and a market value conclusion of US$43.2 million).\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, para. 621.\n\n893.\n\nAs to the second calculation, Mr. Kaczmarek relied on the DCF approach, making one adjustment to his DCF model (which includes Mr. Ricover's corrections): Mr. Kaczmarek assumed that the Chinchero Airport would have opened on schedule and therefore, all cash flows would affectively be discontinued by three fewer years as of 14 July 2017 (compared with 4 July 2014)given that the Project would have been three years closer to being operational.1124 Under this approach, the entrepreneurial profit element would be calculated as the difference between the two DCF model results, which is US$9.7 million. Adding that amount to the costs (US$34.4 million), yields a market value conclusion of US$44.1 million.\n\n**Exhibit RER-5,** Second Kaczmarek Report, paras. 142, 147.\n\n894.\n\nThe average profit margin in the two approaches is US$ 9.2 million, yielding a final market value conclusion of US$ 43.6 million.1125 However, recognizing that a willing buyer would also utilize a DCF approach to value the Concession, Mr. Kaczmarek also calculated the average results of the (adjusted)DCF approach and the cost approach, and reach a market value conclusion of US$ 46 million.1126\n\n**Exhibit RER-5,** Second Kaczmarek Report, para. 148.\n\n**Exhibit RER-5,** Second Kaczmarek Report, paras. 149, 150; Respondent's Rejoinder, para. 621.\n\n**(iv)Interest**\n----------------\n\n895.\n\nThe Respondent does not appear to contest that the Claimants would be entitled to pre-award interest for breach of the BIT.1127 For breach of the Concession Contract, the Respondent's case is that if the Tribunal awards Claimants the specific compensation provided for in the Concession Contract, it should not award interest because the Claimants refused the compensation that Peru offered to pay for the termination of the Contract.1128\n\n**Exhibit RER-5,** Second Kaczmarek Report, paras. 188, 189.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, para. 623.\n\n896.\n\nThe Respondent also objects to the interest rate claimed by the Claimants, which is equal to Kuntur Wasi's WACC.1129 In Respondent's and Mr. Kaczmarek's views, the WACC is a long-term interest rate, whereas the interest rate in this case will only be applied for a few years and is therefore inappropriate.1130 Instead, the Respondent's expert proposes the following alternatives: (1)the 10-year US government bond yield; (2)the average US dollar lending rate in Peru (which is also endorsed by the Claimants' experts, see above); (3)LIBOR (12 months)+4 percent; or (4)US Prime+2 percent.1131 According to the Respondent, Compass Lexecon has endorsed the use of the average US dollar lending rate in Peru.1132\n\nThe Respondent's main case is that if the Tribunal awards the Claimants the specific compensation provided for in the Concession Contract, it should not award interest because the Claimants refused the compensation that Peru offered to pay for the termination of the Contract. If Peru's offer is upheld as the only compensation to which the Claimants are entitled, then the Claimants are responsible for any delay in payment.

Ukraine*).\n\n898.\n\nRelying on the *Lemire* case, the Respondent argues that both Parties agree that the Claimants would have to prove the following three elements to be awarded moral damages:\n\n*[1] the State's actions imply physical threat, illegal detention or other analogous situations in which the ill-treatment contravenes the norms according to which civilized nations are expected to act;*\n\n*[2] the State's actions cause a deterioration of health, stress, anxiety, other mental suffering such as humiliation, shame and degradation, or loss of reputation, credit and social position; and*\n\n*[3] both cause and effect are grave or substantial.*1135\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, para. 625; citing **Exhibit RL-70**, para. 333 and Claimants' Reply, para. 954.\n\n899.\n\nYet the Claimants present no evidence that these elements are met. In particular, with respect to the Claimants' two claims that allegedly justify an award of moral damages, the Respondent argues that:\n\n(i)the preliminary investigations of certain of the Claimants' representatives following the issuance of the *Contralor\u00eda*'s final conclusions about Addendum No. 1 did not involve a \"physical threat, illegal detention or other analogous situation\" that would justify an award of moral damages.1136 On Respondent's case, the investigations complained of were justified and in any event, did not involve the arrest or detention of anyone, were conducted in accordance with due process of law and have been dropped.1137 Even if Claimants were to prevail on their contractual claims, the Respondent argues that the claim of moral damages can only succeed under Peruvian law if they can show that the *Fiscalia's* investigations against certain individuals caused harm to the Claimants, which they have failed to do with any specificity.1138\n\n(ii)the claim that the termination of the Contract resulted in reputational loss is entirely speculative and, in any case, does not support a finding of moral damages because: (i)the Claimants present no evidence of any bids where this issue has been raised, much less resulted in harm; and (ii)this case could not logically cause moral harm to the Claimants because even if the Tribunal finds in favor of the Claimants, the Tribunal would then have recognized their complaints with respect to the termination of the Contract or the State's treatment of Claimants or their investments; and (iii)if, as Claimants argue, Kuntur Wasi terminated the Concession Contract (and not Peru), then it is unclear how Claimants would even suffer reputational harm on account of an act of Peru.1139 In any event, the Respondent argues that an award of moral damages requires far more than merely a showing that an investor's reputation was harmed.1140\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, para. 400.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, para. 400; Respondent's Rejoinder, paras. 626-634.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, para. 634; citing **Exhibit RER-6**, Second Ferrando Report, para. 209.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, para. 401; Respondent's Rejoinder, paras. 635-637.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, paras. 402-405; Respondent's Rejoinder, para. 636.\n\n900.\n\nWith respect to the Claimants' reliance on Peruvian law to claim moral damages, the Respondent alleges that Peruvian law is only relevant for Claimants' contract law claims, not Claimants' treaty-based claims. And even with respect to Claimants' contract claims, the Respondent argues that under Peruvian law, moral damages are only available to companies to the extent that they prove that their commercial reputation \u2013 not that of their employees \u2013 was impaired by illegal conduct against the company itself.1141\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, para. 406, citing **Exhibit RER-2**, First Ferrando Report, paras. 250-258, 261; Respondent's Rejoinder, para. 634.\n\n901.\n\nFinally, the Respondent argues that the amount Claimants are requesting in moral damages is unjustifiable because it is based on a single arbitral decision issued in accordance with Peruvian procurement law with very different facts from the ones at hand (*i.e.*, in that case, a public entity had publicly accused the claimant of corruption without conducting a previous investigation, whereas here, the *Fiscal\u00eda*, acting within its competence, conducted preliminary investigations respecting individual due process rights).1142\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, para. 407, citing **Exhibit CL-144**, *Gobierno Regional de Cusco vs Ingenieros Civiles y Contratistas Generales S.A.*, Award, 31 March 2016, p. 125; Respondent's Rejoinder, para. 638.\n\n**C. The Tribunal's Analysis**\n------------------------------\n\n902.\n\nAt the outset, the Tribunal recalls the decisions it has reached on the merits that have an impact on the damages to be awarded in this case. These are that:\n\n(i)the Respondent breached the Concession Contract as a result of the manner in which it decided to terminate, and ultimately terminated, the Concession Contract;\n\n(ii)such conduct also constituted a breach of the Guarantee Agreement;\n\n(iii)neither breach, however, was characterized by *dolo* or *culpa inexcusable* as those terms are defined in Peruvian law;\n\n(iv)the Respondent's termination of the Contract constituted a violation of the FET standard set forth in Article 2(3)of the BIT, first sentence, as well as the proscription against unjustified treatment set forth in Article 2(3)of the BIT, second sentence.\n\n903.\n\nThe Tribunal has also determined that it has jurisdiction over the claims asserted by Kuntur Wasi. As a result, any damage claims that it rather than Corporacion America is in a position to assert (such as claims under the Concession Contract), can be asserted.\n\n904.\n\nRespondent has not contested its liability to compensate Claimants for the EDI, subject to verification and approval of the amount by OSITRAN.1143 The amount claimed for the EDI is US$23.4 million plus taxes, for a total of US$27.6 million.1144 The Tribunal will return to this issue below. Prior to doing so, however, consideration needs to be given to the overall approach to be taken to questions of damages.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, para. 360.\n\n**Exhibit CLEX-1**, Concession Contract, para. 56.\n\n905.\n\nRespondent has argued that the contractual damage provisions should provide the only measure of damages, even for treaty breaches. In the Tribunal's view, this is not the appropriate approach. In its view, to the extent the Claimants have prevailed on contractual claims, the Contract should govern such claims, with Peruvian law playing any gap-filling or other role that is appropriate. To the extent that Claimants have prevailed on treaty claims, on the other hand, the provisions of the treaty or principles of international law (in the absence of treaty provisions)should govern. To the extent these approaches result in overlapping or duplicative compensation, it will be necessary for the Tribunal to decide what steps should be taken to avoid double recovery. Accordingly, the Tribunal will consider first the issue of contractual damages, and then the issue of damages under the BIT.\n\n**(1)Contract Claims \u2013 Damages Under Peruvian Law Versus the Contract**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n906.\n\nThe effect of the Tribunal's decision that the termination was not done with *dolo* or *culpa inexcusable* means that the liability limitations of the Contract remain applicable (*supra*, paras. 565 *et seq*.). As a result, Kuntur Wasi has no right to recover lost profits under the Contract. As discussed further below, the Tribunal agrees with the Respondent that reading Section 15.4.3 of the Concession Contract as only prescribing a process for addressing out-of-pocket costs and permitting by silence the recovery of lost profits based on Peruvian law is not a logical construction, especially taking into account the detailed scheme set forth in the Contract for damages under different termination scenarios. It also agrees with the Respondent that former Minister's Vizcarra's statements to the Peruvian Congress about the amount of damages that could arise from the termination of the Concession Contract should not be taken as constituting binding admissions of the State as to the amount of damages under any standard of measurement.\n\n907.\n\nThe Tribunal already established that the Contract was effectively terminated by Kuntur Wasi under the rules of the Peruvian Civil Code (*supra,* paras. 460 *et seq*.). The issue therefore becomes whether the Contract's termination provisions govern to determine damages, and particularly which damages are recoverable under the relevant provisions.\n\n908.\n\nRespondent has cited to three termination-related provisions of the Concession Contract: Clause 15.4 (providing for termination by the Concessionaire for MTC's breach); Clause 15.5 (providing for unilateral termination by MTC for public interest reasons); and Section 15.2 (providing for mutual termination).1145\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, paras. 345 *et seq*. *See* **Exhibit C-4**, Concession Contract. The Contract's other termination provisions are: termination upon the expiration of the term of the Concession (Cl. 15.1); termination due to the Concessionaire's breach (Cl. 15.3); and termination for force majeure or unforeseen events (Cl. 15.6).\n\n909.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that the facts of this matter do not support the hypothesis that the termination was by mutual agreement under Clause 15.2. Although it was identified as a possibility in the June 1 *Hoja de Ruta*, and was also the basis on which the Respondent announced the Concession Contract's termination on June 4, that is not what the evidence shows ultimately transpired.\n\n910.\n\nKuntur Wasi did not invoke the grounds specified in the Contract to terminate it,1146 but couched its termination in 2018 under Section 1429 of the Civil Code.1147 However, as noted in paragraph 906 *supra*, the Tribunal agrees with Respondent that notwithstanding the conclusion that Kuntur Wasi was justified in terminating the Concession Contract, damages upon any termination should be governed by the provisions of the Concession Contract, which were negotiated and agreed by the Parties, rather than generally applicable provisions of Peruvian law. Under Clause 15.4.4, the payments specified in the Contract are the exclusive damages to which the Concessionaire is entitled in the event of termination under this provision.\n\n*See* **Exhibit C-4**, Concession Contract Cl. 15.4.1.\n\n*See* para. 802 *supra.*\n\n911.\n\nClause 15.4.3 sets forth different compensation alternatives depending on the stage of the Project at the time of termination, with a lesser measure where the construction phase has not begun, *i.e*., only \"the general expenses incurred up to the date of the effective termination of the Contract, which expenses shall be duly evidenced and admitted by OSITRAN,\" than the measure applicable after that phase has been initiated or after operations have begun. Under these other scenarios, the Concessionaire is entitled to additional compensation, including in relation to the *Valor Neto del Intangible,* as provided in Clause 15.7.\n\n912.\n\nGiven this detailed contractual scheme, in which the amount of compensation for termination is carefully calibrated according to the stage of the Project at which termination occurs, and the Contract's exclusivity provision (Clause 15.4.4), the Tribunal cannot accept Claimants' argument that Clause 15.4.3 is only a process provision for determining costs and does not limit a Concessionaire's ability to claim for lost profits. The provisions the parties agreed would apply to determine damages in the event of termination by breach of the MTC before the beginning of construction (which ultimately occurred)are the ones under Clause 15.4.3 subclause a). Therefore, the Tribunal considers that these are the relevant provisions on which to assess damages in this case.\n\n913.\n\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, the Tribunal agrees with the Claimants that the Concessionaire has also the right to be paid the value of the performance bond (Clause 15.5.3, \"*Garant\u00eda de Fiel Cumplimiento del Contrato de Concesi\u00f3n*\")in addition to the amount payable under Clause 15.4.3. This conclusion has been reached after analyzing (i)the termination-related provisions of the Contract, and (ii)the Respondent's conduct in this matter during the Parties' dispute.\n\n914.\n\nAlthough Peru accepted that Clause 15.5 gives the Concessionaire the right to receive the value of the performance bond (*i.e.*, US$ 8.6 million)in case of unilateral termination for public interest reasons,1148 the Tribunal finds that the scope of the provision is broader. According to the clear text of such clause, a termination for public interest reasons would force Peru to pay all costs incurred (\"*gastos generales en que haya incurrido*\")according to Clause 15.4.3 (Clause 15.5.4), plus the value of the performance bond (Clause 15.5.3). In contrast, a termination resulting from MTC's breach would only force Peru to pay the amounts indicated in Clause 15.4.3, without the payment of the value of the performance bond. This would lead to a result under which the unilateral termination of the Contract for public interest reasons would be more convenient for Peru than breaching the Contract. The Tribunal finds this interpretation unacceptable, as it would create a perverse incentive to undermine the Contract, rather than to fulfill in good faith the requirements to terminate the Contract for public interest reasons.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, para. 567.\n\n915.\n\nThe Tribunal also considers that this interpretation is in accordance with the Respondent's conduct during the Parties' dispute. Peru offered from the beginning of the dispute to pay the costs incurred by Kuntur Wasi in relation to the investment, plus the value of the performance bond.1149 Moreover, Peru has never disputed awarding damages to Kuntur Wasi for this latter concept.\n\n**Exhibit R-108,** *Oficio No. 583-2019-MTC/02*, November 6, 2019.\n\n916.\n\nThe Tribunal thus concludes that the maximum damages Kuntur Wasi could obtain for its contractual claims would be its duly proven costs (including the EDI), plus the value of the performance bond.\n\n917.\n\nThere is no basis, as Claimants appear to concede at least implicitly, for the recovery of lost profits under the Contract. Assuming for the moment all costs have been sufficiently proven, the maximum amount of damages that could be awarded as a matter of contract is: US$ 47.4 million for *gastos incurridos,* plus US$8,687,826 million for the performance bond, for a total of approximately US$56 million, plus interest.1150\n\n**Exhibit CER-4,** Second Compass Lexecon Report, para. 122.\n\n918.\n\nThere are two categories of dispute between the parties with respect to the *gastos incurridos* claimed by Claimants: The first is whether these expenses have been incurred or are recoverable under the Contract; the second is whether their recovery is precluded by Kuntur Wasi's failure to submit them to OSITRAN for approval.\n\n919.\n\nThe Tribunal does not consider that Kuntur Wasi's non-submission of its out-of-pocket costs to OSITRAN constitutes a waiver of its right to recover such costs or otherwise precludes their recovery in these proceedings given the Parties' dispute. The question is whether they fall within the Contract provisions and are established in these proceedings to the reasonable satisfaction of the Tribunal.\n\n920.\n\nWith respect to the first question, the US$ 47.4 million in claimed *gastos incurridos* breaks down into the following components:\n\n(i)EDI costs: US$27.6 million, of which US$9 million has been paid to PyC and the balance is pending (leaving a balance of US$18.6 million);\n\n(ii)Bidding and structuring costs for Kuntur Wasi: US$6.1 million;\n\n(iii)Construction delay costs (payable to PyC): US$4.9 million;\n\n(iv)Financial structuring costs: US$2.0 million;\n\n(v)Operating Costs: US$4.4 million;\n\n(vi)OSITRAN supervisory costs: US$1.1 million; and\n\n(vii)Unrecoverable sales tax: US $1.3 million.1151\n\n*See* **Exhibit CER-1**, First Compass Lexecon Report, Table 5 at p. 33.\n\n921.\n\nThe Respondent, in its Rejoinder, also questioned what it characterized as US$9.3 million in amounts payable.1152 However, at the hearing, Respondent did not include this amount, which in any event does not appear to tally with the numbers put forward by its expert.1153 The Tribunal considers that this position has either been abandoned by the Respondent, or in the alternative not proven.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, para. 576.\n\n*See* **Exhibit RD-1**, Respondent's Opening Statement Presentation, p. 91; Transcript, Day 1 (English), 247:4-8.\n\n922.\n\nThe Tribunal understands that the Respondent does not dispute the recoverability of the costs in categories (v), (vi)and (vii)(operating costs, OSITRAN supervisory costs and unrecoverable sales tax), totaling US$6.8 million, subject to their verification.1154 It does, however, dispute the recoverability of the costs in categories (ii), (iii)and (iv)(bidding and structuring costs, construction delay costs, and financial structuring costs).1155 Regarding the EDI costs in category (i), the Respondent raises a question about the recoverability of the full amount claimed, given that only a portion of the amounts invoiced (US$9 million)has been paid out to PyC.1156\n\n*See* **Exhibit RER-1**, First Kaczmarek Report, para. 150, Table 3, \"Compensable Under Contract\" column with respect to these expenses.\n\nId.\n\n**Exhibit RER-1**, First Kaczmarek Report, para. 151.\n\n923.\n\nTurning first to the cross-cutting issue of substantiation, Respondent argues that if the Tribunal awards damages on the basis of costs, it needs to stand in the shoes of OSITRAN and assess these costs. The Tribunal understands from Respondent's submissions that OSITRAN would verify that the claimed costs had been incurred in relation to the Project and were reasonable.1157 While the Tribunal does not consider that it is its role to stand in the shoes of OSITRAN, a Peruvian government agency, the above principles equally apply to the appropriate decision-making standard for the Tribunal regarding the claimed damages.\n\n*See* **Exhibit RD-1**, Respondent's Opening Statement Presentation, p. 86.\n\n924.\n\nThe Tribunal also considers that the financial statements of Kuntur Wasi establish a *prima facie* verification of the amounts and character of expenses incurred. In taking this view, the Tribunal considers it relevant that the financial statements for all the years in question have been subject to independent audits by Ernst & Young.1158 Below the Tribunal addresses additional issues that are presented with respect to the asserted items of cost below.\n\n*See* **Exhibit CLEX-029**, Kuntur Wasi Financial Statements, 2017, a-d, and f.\n\n925.\n\nWith respect to the EDI (item (i)above), the fact that only a portion has been paid out to date does not make the cost any less of an obligation, in the view of the Tribunal. Although PyC is a related entity, there has not been any showing that the costs have been in any way inflated. Respondent has admitted use of the EDI and there is no question it was prepared and delivered. Thus, the Tribunal considers that this cost is fully recoverable by Kuntur Wasi based on the invoiced amounts.\n\n926.\n\nWith respect to the construction delay cost of US$4.9 million (item (iii)above), which Claimants indicate is owed to PyC, and which Respondent says should be excluded given that Peru did not cause any construction delays and Claimants have not justified why these costs were incurred,1159 the Tribunal does not consider that these particular costs have been sufficiently established by Claimants. While this expense may appear in the audited financial statements of Kuntur Wasi,1160 it presents additional issues that have not been sufficiently addressed. The Tribunal has been provided with no information by Claimants, who bear the burden of proof on damages, as to the basis for this delay charge, which, as a charge between related entities, requires careful scrutiny. Moreover, Respondent has pointed out that in the document suspending the Project signed by the Parties on March 2, 2017, it was expressly agreed that the suspension would not give rise to any additional costs to the MTC.1161 Thus, to the extent the delay charge is attributable to the period during which the Project was suspended\u2014which cannot be discerned from the evidence before the Tribunal\u2014there is no basis for assessing damages against Respondent. To the extent it arises from pre-suspension delays, the Tribunal considers that such delays were the result of the absence of finalized construction financing and the EGP approval process, and were not therefore the result of any breach by Respondent. Accordingly, this element of asserted cost is non-recoverable in these proceedings.\n\n**Exhibit RER-1**, Kaczmarek, First Report, para. 150, table 3; Respondent's Rejoinder, paras. 576-77.\n\n**Exhibit CER-4,** Second Compass Lexecon Report, para. 119; **Exhibit RER-1,** First Kaczmarek Report, paras. 147-148.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, para. 576, note 1239, citing to **Exhibit C-31**, *Acta de Acuerdo, Suspension Temporal de Obligaciones Contractuales*, 2 March 2017.\n\n927.\n\nAs to the other claimed costs (items (ii)(bidding and structuring costs)and (iv)(financial structuring costs)above), the Tribunal notes that Clause 15.4.3 of the Concession Contract is written in very general terms, providing for compensation for \"the general expenses incurred up to the date of the effective termination of the Contract\u2026\" It does not appear on its face to exclude any costs that are related to the Project. In particular, even if the bidding and structuring costs could not be recovered via the FPAO scheme, that would not necessarily mean they were excluded from recovery under this provision. Clause 4.5 of the bidding terms is written in broad terms,1162 but given that the Bases are not to be interpreted on an equal basis with the terms of the Contract,1163 the Tribunal considers that they do not have the effect of creating an implied exclusion from the concept of damages in the Contract's termination provisions.\n\nThis Clause states in part that \"[U]nder no circumstances, shall the State or any agency, body or official thereof, or PROINVERSION, the Committee, or its advisors, be liable for any such costs regardless of the form of the bidding process or the outcome thereof.\" **Exhibit C-18**, Final Bidding Terms, Cl. 4.5. [Tribunal's translation] The original Spanish reads: \"*El Estado o cualquier dependencia, organismo o funcionario de este, or POINVERSION, el Comite, o sus asesores, no seran responsables en ningun caso por dichos costos cualquiera sea la forma en que se realize el concurso o su resultado.*\"\n\nThe Bases do not control the interpretation of the Contract; however, rather in any interpretive dispute, it is the Contract terms that rank in priority, followed by the circulars referenced in the Bases, with the Bases occupying the final rank. **Exhibit C-4**, Concession Contract, Cl. 16.3.1.\n\n**(2)Damages Arising from the Guarantee Agreement**\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n928.\n\nThe Tribunal now turns to consideration of the effects, if any, of the Guarantee Agreement has on the scope of Respondent's damages liability as a matter of Peruvian law. Through the Guarantee, the State guaranteed performance of the Contract by the MTC.1164 The Guarantee does not contain any damage provisions of its own, but simply backs up the Contract obligations.1165 Nonetheless, the Guarantee operated to oblige the State to ensure that any termination by the MTC was carried out in accordance with the Contract's terms, something that the Tribunal has found did not occur. The Tribunal in its analysis of liability considered this breach to constitute a sovereign act, albeit one that, for the reasons set forth earlier,1166 provides no basis as a matter of Peruvian law for the award of any additional damages as a consequence of this breach. The Tribunal will consider this point further in connection with its consideration of damages as a matter of international law.\n\n**Exhibit CL-35**, *Decreto Supremo No. 185-2014-EF*, 27 June 2014, art. 1.\n\n**Exhibit CL-35**, *Decreto Supremo No. 185-2014-EF*, 27 June 2014, art. 2.\n\n*See* para. 929 *supra.*\n\n929.\n\nTo summarize, the damages that can be claimed for breach of the Concession Contract are those provided under Section 15.5 of that Contract, the *gastos incurridos* claimed by Claimants (other than the US$4.9 million delay charge), *i.e.,* US$42.5 million, plus the value of the performance bond, *i.e.,* US$8,687,826 million, for a total of US$51,187,826 million, together with interest as discussed *infra* at paragraph 985 from the date of termination to the date of the award.\n\n**(3)Treaty Claims**\n--------------------\n\n***a. Income Versus Cost Approach***\n------------------------------------\n\n930.\n\nThe Parties do not dispute that the Treaty does not provide the standard of compensation for any BIT breaches other than expropriation. Accordingly, with respect to the violations of Article 2(3)of the BIT that the Tribunal has determined have taken place, the Parties are in agreement that the *Chorzow Factory* standard should be applied. It is the application of that standard to this case that they dispute, for although *Chorzow Factory* dictates a full reparation standard,1167 tribunals over the years have found multiple approaches to the calculation of damages to be consistent with that standard.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that Claimants has not sought restitution, presumably because it is materially impossible.\n\n931.\n\nThe contesting approaches in this case are an income-based approach, relying on a DCF calculation based on the parameters of a \"but-for\" scenario, and a cost approach, which is based on a concept of costs incurred to the date of termination plus a reasonable entrepreneurial profit. The income approach assumes that the Airport would have been built by Kuntur Wasi, and that the Project would have become operational and remained so for the term of the Concession.\n\n932.\n\nThe Tribunal, after extensive deliberation, has concluded that the cost approach is the more suitable one in this case. Although Corporaci\u00f3n America undeniably has significant experience with the construction and operation of airports in Latin America, the state of the Project and unresolved questions regarding fundamental terms of the Concession Contract at the time of termination, as well as uncertainties regarding key assumptions in the Claimants' \"but for\" scenario, make the income approach too speculative, in the Tribunal's judgement, to provide reasonable certainty as to the amounts that calculation yields.\n\n933.\n\nIn terms of the status of the Project at the time of Peru's termination of the Contract, not only was the Airport not built, but the construction phase had not even begun. Substantial site preparation work had been done, primarily involving earthworks, but financing for the construction phase had not been approved, and the financing scheme for this phase was in doubt at the time of termination. This was due to MTC's rejection of Kuntur Wasi's EGP proposal, and the issues raised with respect to Addendum No. 1, the new financing plan for that phase, which had caused the MTC to declare shortly before termination that Addendum No. 1 was \"not effective\" (\"*sin efecto\"*)*.* While Addendum No. 1 had greatly simplified the scheme for construction financing over the original PAO/FPAO scheme, it was in the Tribunal's view unclear at the time of termination what the construction financing scheme would ultimately be. Not only did that scheme need to be determined, but then financing for the construction phase needed to be secured based on the subsidy scheme ultimately adopted, and construction had to be completed before the Airport would become operational. Only once all of those steps occurred would there be an income stream from the Project to take into account. Thus, notwithstanding Corporaci\u00f3n America's experience in building and operating airports in Latin America, at the time of the breach, there was significant uncertainty as to not only the timing of, but also the prospects for, Project completion.\n\n934.\n\nMoreover, at the time of MTC's attempted unilateral termination, in July 2017, substantial uncertainty surrounded other key terms of the Contract going forward as well. The June 1 *Hoja de Ruta*, a document agreed to by Kuntur Wasi, indicated that the concession might be shortened from 40 to 25 years, a significant reduction of the period during which the Concessionaire would realize income from the Project. Addendum No. 1 changed the financing scheme, simplifying it substantially, but its viability was thrown in doubt by the report of the *Contraloria*. A \"but for\" calculation on an income basis is based on projected cash flows over the life of the investment. But with a key variable, the term of the Concession, in play at the time of the breach, it can no longer reasonably be assumed in the Tribunal's view that the Concession term would have been 40 years. Twenty-five years, a significantly shorter term, was on the table, but the Tribunal considers that it was by no means certain that 25 years would ultimately have been agreed to, either. Whether the appropriate \"but for\" assumption would be a term of 25 or 40 years or something in between consequently becomes a matter of speculation. Yet that term alone could have material implications for the damages calculation.\n\n935.\n\nOther assumptions that are important to the DCF calculation invite speculation as well. In the following paragraphs the Tribunal discusses three such assumptions disputed by the Parties that have a material effect on the calculation:\n\n(i)NPV and rate of return;\n\n(ii)Aeronautical revenue key assumptions (number of visitors and number of international flights); and\n\n(iii)Operating costs and net margins.\n\n**(i)NPV and IRR**\n------------------\n\n936.\n\nThe Parties have argued extensively over what the NPV of the Project at the time of the Concession should be. The issue of the NPV is distinct from, but also connected to, the Project's anticipated internal rate of return (IRR)over the life of the Concession, and is significant in the \"but for\" calculation of the value of the Project.\n\n937.\n\nThe Respondent's expert, Mr. Kaczmarek, has argued that the NPV at the time of the bid should be zero or close to zero because of the state subsidies being provided. He has contended, with some force of logic and support in the evidence, that without such subsidies the Project had a negative NPV. Although the subsidies were designed to eliminate the negative NPV, thereby attracting bidders, that State would not have wanted to provide subsidies in excess of what was necessary to do so.1168 In response to the Claimants' arguments about the PROINVERSI\u00d3N assumptions on these matters, Respondent and its expert have indicated that the Claimants have relied on the wrong study for their position.1169 They have also asserted that the IRR calculated by the Claimant's experts is 20.4%, which they consider to be excessive.1170\n\n**Exhibit RER-1**, First Kaczmarek Report, para. 165; **Exhibit RER-5,** Second Kaczmarek Report, paras. 37, 38.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, para. 596; **Exhibit RER-5,** Second Kaczmarek Report, paras. 43-50.\n\n**Exhibit RER-1**, First Kaczmarek Report, para. 163; Respondent's Rejoinder, para. 594; Transcript, Day 1 (English), 244:2-8.\n\n938.\n\nThe Claimants in response have made several arguments: They have indicated that the NPV at the time of bid acceptance has to be above zero because the IRR has to be greater than the cost of capital to a bidding firm, to enable it to cover its bidding costs. They have also argued that market changes in the 2013-2017 period increased the Project's value in several ways, particularly by decreasing costs due to the depreciation of the Peruvian *Sol* and increasing traffic. They have further submitted that the IRR expected from an airport project is necessarily greater than the financing costs, as PROINVERSI\u00d3N recognizes,1171 and that the mere fact of having won the tender creates value. Finally, they have disagreed that the IRR calculated by their experts is 20.4%, submitting instead that it is 12.45% when all relevant years are included.1172\n\n**Exhibit CD-1**, Claimants' Opening Statement Presentation, p. 195. *See also* Claimants' Reply para. 923.\n\n**CD-1**, Compass Lexecon Presentation, P. 15.\n\n939.\n\nThe Tribunal accepts the proposition that a State would not want to subsidize a project in excess of what was needed to attract bidders. That conclusion strongly argues for an NPV being zero or close to zero at the time of bid acceptance. At the same time, in constructing a \"but for\" scenario, it would seem appropriate and, indeed, less speculative, to take into account market conditions post-bid in calculating the likely rate of return. The Tribunal also considers that the Contract itself is a valuable asset and that, if bidding costs are excluded from subsidies, a bidder would want a rate of return that would cover those costs.\n\n940.\n\nOn balance, therefore, the Tribunal considers that while the NPV at the time of the bid's acceptance may have been zero or close to zero, the Contract, once entered into, would have value. Even so, it is difficult to imagine that the signing of a Contract and the subsequent events that Claimants have put forward would result in an increase in the NPV at the time of bid acceptance to the extent Claimants' model posits, given that the Airport still had to be financed, constructed, and enter into operation.\n\n941.\n\nTurning to the question what is a reasonable rate of return for the Project in the \"but for\" scenario, the Tribunal agrees with Respondent that a rate greater than 20% would appear to be excessive; however, if Claimants are correct, this is not what the \"but for\" model proposes; rather, Claimants have indicated the IRR is 12.45% when all relevant years are taken into account. The Tribunal notes that PROINVERSI\u00d3N, in its report of 1 December 2013, indicated that \"[p]revious concessions of airports in Peru accounted between 12% and 14% IRR.\"1173 The Tribunal considers this evidence highly probative on what a reasonable IRR would be. It also considers that if bid costs are not recoverable from the State, bidders would want to recover those costs through the returns earned on the Project. This leads to the conclusion that the IRR should logically be greater than a bidder's cost of capital.\n\n**Exhibit R-31,** ALG Report, Deliverable 4-B: Financial Economic Model, December 2013, p. 163.\n\n942.\n\nThe Tribunal further observes that the second expert report of Mr. Kaczmarek, after criticizing the Claimants' experts' reliance on the overall project-level scenario in the December 2013 PROINVERSI\u00d3N study, points to the second cash flow analysis of that study, which focused on cash flows to the equity investor, which apparently found an IRR of 12.35%.1174 This rate is very close to the 12.45% IRR that Claimants indicate to be the true IRR in their calculation and also falls within the range cited by PROINVERSI\u00d3N in the December 2013 report.\n\n**Exhibit RER-5,** Second Kaczmarek Report, paras. 56-59, discussing **Exhibit R-31**, ALG Report, Deliverable 4-B: Financial Economic Model, December 2013.\n\n943.\n\nGiven the public interest in building the new Airport, it seems clear to the Tribunal that Peru would have wanted to offer a sufficiently robust rate of return to attract strong bidders. The evidence of PROINVERSI\u00d3N's views on what was an appropriate rate of return are, in the Tribunal's view, the most relevant in terms of any expectations the Claimants might have had regarding the appropriate IRR for the Project, not the bidders' internal calculations.\n\n944.\n\nBut what is a reasonable assumption regarding the life of the Project? This question harks back to the issue of what the duration of the Concession would have been had the Project gone forward instead of being terminated. A material shortening of the term of the Concession would presumably affect the rate of return that would be needed to attract investors. However, the cited PROINVERSI\u00d3N IRR figures appear to assume a 40-year concession.1175 The PROINVERSI\u00d3N calculations are therefore ultimately not probative on what the IRR should be under a scenario in which the Concession has a materially shorter term.\n\n**Exhibit R-31,** ALG Report, Deliverable 4-B: Financial Economic Model, December 2013, p. 22.\n\n945.\n\nThis analysis underscores the challenges of constructing a \"but for\" scenario that is not speculative. But these are not the only key assumptions that materially affect valuation of the Project using an income model.\n\n**(ii)Number of Visitors and Flights**\n--------------------------------------\n\n946.\n\nThe assumptions regarding the number of visitors and flights, especially international flights, once the Airport becomes operational, also have a significant impact on revenues from aeronautical activities in the \"but for\" income-based scenario. These aeronautical revenues represent more than 80% of estimated revenues from the new Airport, with non-aeronautical revenues (the estimate of which there does not seem to be in dispute)representing the remainder.\n\n947.\n\nRespondent contends that aeronautical revenues are vastly overestimated in the \"but-for scenario, increasing damages using the income approach by US$42.3 million.\n\n948.\n\nWith respect to visitors, Respondent and its expert, Mr. Ricover, argue that a ceiling on visitors to Macchu Picchu, which would be triggered beginning in 2027, limits the growth potential of the area, which is principally driven by tourism. Claimants in response criticize Mr. Ricover's reliance on 2013 rather than 2017 data,1176 and argue that his position ignores both the optimistic version put forward by PROINVERSI\u00d3N as well as real data. They also emphasize the existence of other tourist attractions in the Sacred Valley besides Macchu Picchu that in their view would bring in visitors.\n\nClaimants' Reply, para. 930.\n\n949.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, it would be illogical for Peru to support building a new airport as strongly as it did if it did not believe that a better facility would result in an increase in the number of visitors, especially tourists. At the same time, the visitor limitation to Macchu Picchu cannot simply be ignored; even though it is of Peru's making and therefore could be changed; the reasons for that limitation presumably relate to the cultural and historical significance, environmental sensitivity, and carrying capacity of the Macchu Picchu site that would remain factors to be considered in any objective assessment.1177 Claimants' highlighting of Choquequeirao and other attractions that are increasingly drawing visitors to the Sacred Valley also has merit, however. In particular, with new sites being developed and attracting an increasing number of tourists, it is reasonable to assume that, while Macchu Picchu would remain an important and even perhaps still the principal attraction to the region, the increasing diversity of attractions would bring in additional visitors.\n\nMacchu Picchu is a UNESCO World Heritage site, having been so designated in 1983.\n\n950.\n\nFor all these reasons, the Tribunal is of the view that the projections of Mr. Ricover, Respondent's aviation expert, are too conservative. They are not consistent with the Respondent's own projections at the time. While reliance on the most optimistic scenario envisioned by PROINVERSI\u00d3N may not be fully justified, the Tribunal considers that Mott McDonald's expectation of continued growth, based on the expert opinion of Mr. Rossi, represents the more likely scenario. But whether the right number is 6 million, 6.5 million, or some other number again becomes a matter of some degree of speculation on the part of the Tribunal.\n\n951.\n\nWith respect to flights, the major issue concerns the number of international flights with a new airport. This is because the revenue contribution of international flights is significantly greater than that of domestic flights. Respondent asserts that tourists would continue to travel to the region primarily through Lima, a low-cost airport that functions as a major hub in the region. Its expert Mr. Ricover therefore projects that international flights to Chinchero would not represent more than 10% of the total number of flights and in fact would decline progressively starting in 2022. Claimants consider that the proper percentage would be between 25 and 30% starting around 2030, hovering just above 25% in 2039. Claimants have submitted that there would be sufficient demand to justify nonstop flights from certain international destinations, such as Miami, once the new infrastructure was in place.1178 It relies not only on its own experts, but studies done by Peru which have projected growth with a new facility.\n\nClaimants' Closing Statement Presentation, pp. 134-136.\n\n952.\n\nAgain the Tribunal considers that neither party's position is fully justified. It agrees with the Respondent that considerable traffic will continue to be routed through Lima, both for the attractions of Lima itself and because of its hub status and favorable cost structure. It also accepts that new infrastructure does not necessarily mean a growth in international traffic. At the same time, the Tribunal is persuaded that there will be sufficient demand for some new international flights that bypass Lima and go directly to the tourist area. A 10% ceiling therefore seems unrealistic. Although the Claimants' scenario also appears unduly optimistic, an assumption that international flights would grow after the new airport became operational, either due to the addition of some new routes or to the possibility of introducing wide-bodied planes (fleet evolution), and would over a period of several years increase, seems reasonable based on all the evidence.1179 Again, however, fixing a number becomes a somewhat speculative exercise.\n\nIt appears PROINVERSION also considered in its studies that with the new airport, there would also come new direct international routes. *See* **Exhibit CD-2**, Mott MacDonald Presentation, p. 11.\n\n**(iii)Operating Costs and Margins**\n------------------------------------\n\n953.\n\nRespondent criticizes the level of operating costs assumed in Claimants' DCF model, indicating that at 13.6%, they are too low, and should be 55% of total revenues. Claimants submit that their model takes PROINVERSI\u00d3N's numbers which were specifically tailored to local circumstances, adjusted to make them current. They also say that the 13.6% cost level is consistent with the operating costs of the Lima airport, and criticize Respondent and its expert for picking airport facilities around the world that may not be comparable in fact in terms of regulation, the cost environment, and other relevant factors. Claimants also criticize the calculations for some airports used by Respondent as comparators, *e.g.*, Montevideo, where they say operating costs have been miscalculated.\n\n954.\n\nIn the view of the Tribunal, PROINVERSI\u00d3N's assumptions at the time of the bid regarding the level of likely operating expenses are highly probative. Not only were they prepared by a government agency in relation to this bid, but they are based on information about the cost structure of airport operations in Peru and draw on the numbers from the existing Cuzco airport. They therefore provide the best evidence of reasonable expectations regarding the level of relevant operating costs at least at the time of the bid.\n\n955.\n\nWith respect to the issue of operating margin, the Tribunal agrees with Mr. Ricover that operating margin is the proper benchmark to use when comparing projections for Chinchero to other airports, rather than EBIDTA which brings in non-comparable local factors such as regulatory charges. In terms of which airports should be compared to Chinchero to assess the reasonableness of the operating margin projected for Chinchero, the Tribunal agrees that comparability is key. It doubts whether an airport such as Lima, which is a major international as well as domestic hub, is a reasonable comparator. Rather, other regional airports in Latin America, recognizing that there may need to be adjustments for relevant factors, and especially those operated by Corporaci\u00f3n Am\u00e9rica, would appear to the Tribunal to be the best comparators.\n\n956.\n\nWhile the Parties' disagreement with respect to the cost side of the DCF projection thus appears to the Tribunal to be more susceptible to being resolved with reasonable certainty than the other factors discussed above, it is subject to the overall uncertainty discussed earlier regarding the term of the Concession, the rate of return, and revenues.\n\n957.\n\nIn sum, a detailed consideration of the key assumptions underlying the Claimants' DCF model have convinced the Tribunal that given the number of key variables in play, a DCF model is simply too speculative given the state of the Project and the unresolved questions concerning its future at the time of termination that make the construction of a \"but for\" scenario particularly fraught.\n\n958.\n\nIn addition to the terms of the Contract, Claimants have relied upon the *Stati v. Kazakhstan* decision for the proposition that when there is an existing facility with established and predictable traffic and binding contractual revenue obligations, an income approach is appropriate.1180 Notably, however, the tribunal in the *Stati* case found that the claimants had not met their burden of proof and that \"a high level of sufficient probability must be applied to a claim for lost opportunity.1181\n\n**Exhibit CL-246**, *Anatolie Stati, Gabriel Stati, Ascom Group SA and Terra Raf Trans Traiding Ltd v. Republic of Kazakhstan*, SCC Case No. V 116/2010 1688, Award, 19 December 2013 (hereinafter *Antolie Stati et al v. Kazakhstan*), para. 1688; *see* Claimants' Reply para. 910; **Exhibit CD-1**, Claimants' Opening Statement Presentation, p. 192.\n\n**Exhibit CL-246**, *Antolie Stati et al v. Kazakhstan*, para. 1689.\n\n959.\n\nTwo other cases on which the Claimants have relied, involving airport contracts or concessions where the DCF method was applied to calculate damages following a finding of unlawful expropriation, *ADC v. Hungary* and *Flughafen Z\u00fcrich v. Venezuela*,1182 both involved airports that were operational. They therefore did not present the issues that the circumstances of the Project at the time of termination present to this Tribunal.\n\n**Exhibit CL-107**, *ADC v. Hungary*; **Exhibit CL-128**, *Flughafen Z\u00fcrich v. Venezuela*.\n\n960.\n\nWhile it is true that the Contract provides a solid basis for making assumptions about certain key variables in a but-for analysis, ultimately the Tribunal must be convinced that damages based on an income approach have been sufficiently proven, have been caused by the breach, are reasonable in amount, and are not too speculative or remote. The Tribunal considers that the Claimant has not met its burden of persuasion when all of these factors are taken into account in relation to the proposed DCF model. It therefore agrees with the expert of the Respondent that the cost rather than the income approach is the most appropriate approach for calculating damages for the breaches of Article 2(3)of the BIT on the facts and circumstances of this case.\n\n***b. Cost approach***\n----------------------\n\n961.\n\nAs noted earlier (*supra*, paras. 827 through 829), the Claimants have not submitted calculations of damages for a violation of international law using the cost approach. They have responded to the calculation of damages based on a cost approach prepared by the Respondent's quantum expert. It is to that approach, which seeks to establish a market value for the Project at the time of termination based on costs incurred plus an entrepreneurial profit, to which the Tribunal will now turn.\n\n962.\n\nAccording to the Claimants' experts, based on Kuntur Wasi's audited financial statements, the Claimants' investment in the Project totaled approximately US$47.4 million.1183 The Tribunal in its analysis of contractual damages considered each of the components of this amount*.* It concluded that the Claimants had not met their burden of persuasion as to the construction delay costs of US$4.9 million, but found that the other expenses were appropriate and sufficiently justified. Accordingly, the total amount of out-of-pocket expenditures found to have been validly incurred was US$42.5 million.\n\n**Exhibit CER-1**, First Compass Lexcon Report, paras. 63-65.\n\n963.\n\nThe Respondent's quantum expert maintains that a market value approach to costs would not result in US$2.0 million of these expenses, for financial structuring, being compensable.1184 In the Tribunal's view, however, it is reasonable to assume that any party in the position of the Claimants would seek to recover their full investment, which would include these costs. The Tribunal therefore considers that US$42.5 million is the appropriate number for purposes of the BIT's damages calculation under the cost approach. This is the amount, in the Tribunal's view, on which the entrepreneurial profit needs to be calculated.\n\n*See, e.g*., **Exhibit RER-1**, First Kazcmarek Report, para. 149.\n\n964.\n\nThe Respondent's expert did not set forth any calculation of entrepreneurial profit in his initial report, but addressed this in his second report.1185 As a result of the Tribunal's conclusions that the market value of the Concession at the time of the breach was US$42.5 million, rather than US$34.4 million, however, a new calculation of entrepreneurial profit needs to be made. The Tribunal therefore instructs the parties to prepare a new calculation based on this decision.\n\n**Exhibit RER-5**, Second Kazcmarek Report, paras. 141-148.\n\n965.\n\nThe *Chorzow Factory* standard also requires the inclusion of any consequential damages in order to achieve full reparation. Had there not been the unlawful termination, Kuntur Wasi's performance bond would not have been forfeit. Accordingly, the value of that bond, US$8,687,826, should be treated as consequential damages.\n\n***c. Moral Damages***\n----------------------\n\n966.\n\nThe Claimants seek moral damages based on both Peruvian and international law of 20% of the compensatory damages arising from alleged damage to the image, honour and good reputation of Kuntur Wasi and its shareholders from the Respondent's wrongful termination of the Concession Contract.\n\n967.\n\nThey admit that moral damages under Peruvian law requires the establishment of financial prejudice.1186 Given that the Tribunal has determined that the Claimants have not sustained their burden of demonstrating this claim (*supra*, paras. 184 *et seq.*), there is no moral harm and, therefore, no basis for an award of damages in relation to this claim under Peruvian law.\n\nSee, para. 595 *supra*.\n\n968.\n\nThat leaves the question of whether they are justified under international law. Both parties rely on the standard articulated in *Lemire v. Ukraine,* which has three prongs:\n\n\u2022 the State's actions imply physical threat, illegal detention or other analogous situations in which the ill-treatment contravenes the norms according to which civilized nations are expected to act;\n\n\u2022 the State's actions cause a deterioration in health, stress, anxiety, or other mental suffering such as humiliation, shame and denigration, or loss of reputation, or social position; and\n\n\u2022 both cause and effect are grave and substantial.1187\n\n**Exhibit RL-70**, *Lemire v. Ukraine,* para. 333. [Referenced in **Exhibit RD-1**, Respondent's Opening Statement Presentation, p. 94].\n\n969.\n\nThis is a high standard, which the Tribunal does not consider has been met on the facts and circumstances put forward by the Claimants in this case. The Claimants rely on two sets of facts and circumstances: first, the criminal measures taken by the State against certain Kuntur Wasi personnel detailed earlier; and second, the effects of termination on future procurement opportunities of Corporaci\u00f3n America based on a tendering requirement to disclose instances of contract termination.1188\n\n*See* para. 580 *supra.*\n\n970.\n\nAs to the first, it does not, in the Tribunal's view, provide a basis for moral damages. The criminal measures were not taken against a Claimant, but against individual personnel. It is not clear to the Tribunal whether there could have been criminal action taken against Kuntur Wasi as a corporate entity, as the Tribunal does not have evidence on the record as to whether Peru recognizes corporate criminal liability. But in any event, while the Tribunal appreciates the seriousness of the criminal measures taken against Kuntur Wasi personnel, Peru's actions, even if taken against the individuals as proxies for the company, did not satisfy the first element of the *Lemire* test.\n\n971.\n\nThe Tribunal has not been provided with evidence that demonstrates that the measures were taken in bad faith. The Tribunal takes judicial notice of the fact that during this period, Peru faced numerous accusations of significant corruption in public procurement, including in the construction sector. While corruption allegations can be misused, and it is particularly troubling that allegations similar to those made against Minister Vizcarra and arising from the same events were archived one month before he assumed the Presidency of Peru, while those against Kuntur Wasi's personnel were not, there is nonetheless insufficient evidence of abuse of the State's investigative and penal machinery for this element to be met. The fact that an investigation did not ultimately lead to charges having been made does not mean there was no basis for the inquiry and therefore cannot be the test. If there was a reasonable basis for concern regarding potential criminal conduct, Peru was entitled \u2014perhaps even internationally obligated- to investigate. It has not been shown to have been acting contrary to the norms according to which civilized nations are expected to act. But those same norms also compel Peru to act with dispatch and non-arbitrariness; the Tribunal can well appreciate that the prolonged nature of these investigations would be extremely troubling to the individuals involved.\n\n972.\n\nAs to the second, the Tribunal recognizes that tenders for other airport projects pursued by Corporaci\u00f3n Am\u00e9rica may require disclosure of Peru's termination of the Chinchero Airport contract and the potential for reputational harm arising from the termination. The fact that this act was disputed and this Tribunal has found that the termination was wrongful and gives rise to damages should, however, allow Corporacion America to mitigate any effects of this disclosure in future tenders and to its reputation more generally. Moreover, the Claimants have not demonstrated that the effects of disclosure or the reputational damages up to this point are \"grave and substantial\" as the *Lemire* test requires. They have not provided any examples of bids that were rejected on this basis, or other deleterious effects of a specific nature, but have only made a general allegation of harm.\n\n973.\n\nAccordingly, the Tribunal finds no basis for the award of moral damages.\n\n***d. Contingent PYC Claim***\n-----------------------------\n\n974.\n\nKuntur Wasi and Proyecta & Construye, S.A. (\"PyC\")entered into an EPC contract for the Project (*Contrato de Ingenieria, Aprovisionamiento y Construccion (EPC)a Suma Alzada*)(the \"EPC\" Contract\")on 26 June 2014.1189 By its terms, the EPC Contract would terminate automatically upon the termination of the Concession.1190 If construction had begun, then PyC would have the right to be compensated for the work performed as well as its duly verified expenses and costs up to the termination. This same clause goes on to provide that:\n\n*Nonetheless, in the event that KUNTUR WASI prevails over the Grantor and is paid compensation by the latter as a result of having challenged the termination of the Concession, KUNTUR WASI undertakes to recognize in favour of THE CONTRACTOR, as loss of profits, any profit lost by the latter for the unfinished WORK, provided that such item is expressly included in the compensation granted to KUNTUR WASI.1191*\n\n**Exhibit C-104**, EPC Contract*,* 26 June 2014.\n\n**Exhibit C-104**, EPC Contract*,* 26 June 2014, Cl.18.4.\n\nId. [Tribunal's translation] The original Spanish reads: \"*No obstante, en caso que KUNTUR WASI logre percibir por parte del Concedente una indemnizacion a su favor como consecuencia de haber cuestionado la caducidad de la Concesion, KUNTUR WASI se compromete a reconocer a favor de EL CONTRATISTA, a titulo de lucro cesante, la utilidad dejada de percibir por este ultimo respecto de LA OBRA inconclusa, siempre que dicho concepto este especificamente comprendido en la indemnizacion que se otorgue a KUNTUR WASI.*\"\n\n975.\n\nThis provision thus appears to establish a contingent liability of Kuntur Wasi to PyC for lost profits from the EPC Contract, provided that this element is specifically provided for in any award to Kuntur Wasi.1192\n\nIt is not entirely clear to the Tribunal whether this liability would arise by virtue of an award of lost profits generally, or whether it requires that there be an award the specifically provides for lost profits under this contract. Claimants have identified this as a separate head of damages, so the Tribunal assumes they understand it to be the latter.\n\n976.\n\nThe Claimants argue that this obligation, quantified at US$48.5 million, would not have arisen without Peru's unlawful conduct, and that this contingent liability needs to be part of an award in order to put the Claimants in the same position they would have been in absent the violation.1193 The Respondent disputes the validity of this claim, highlighting the sister relationship between Kuntur Wasi and PyC.1194\n\nClaimants' Memorial, para. 639.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, paras. 617-619.\n\n977.\n\nThe Tribunal finds this claim puzzling. It observes that, had the Concession not been terminated and the EPC Contract been performed, Kuntur Wasi would presumably have paid PyC for its work under the Contract, and any profit earned by PyC from the Contract would have been derived from the payments received from Kuntur Wasi. Thus, in the Tribunal's view, in the \"but for\" scenario, taking an income approach, the EPC contract would have been performed and the cost of that Contract should therefore be an expense of Kuntur Wasi, without there being a separate obligation to compensate PyC for its profits. The Tribunal understands that Claimants' experts have included this item in its real scenario. Although the real scenario assumes termination, the flaw in this approach is that as a contingent liability, it only qualifies as an element of out-of-pocket loss to Kuntur Wasi if the contingency is satisfied. Based on the terms of the EPC Contract, this would only occur if the Tribunal specifically recognizes this amount as a component of a damages award.\n\n978.\n\nThe Tribunal does not consider it appropriate to include this contingent liability in its damages award and specifically declines to do so. It is one thing to include in damages an unpaid liability for work that has been demonstrated to have been performed, such as the balance of the invoice relating to the EDI. It is quite another to saddle the Respondent, which was not a party to the EPC Contract and has not been shown to have been aware of or consented to its provisions, with a potential significant contingent liability of Kuntur Wasi to a third party, especially one that is related. Accordingly, this claim shall be excluded from any further damages calculations.\n\n***e. Interest***\n-----------------\n\n979.\n\nAs noted earlier, Claimants' damages calculation includes interest from 13 July 2017 until the date of payment of any award, compounded annually.1195 They submit that interest is an integral part of providing full reparation and that the interest rate in this case should be its weighted average cost of capital (WACC)of 7.18%. Respondent did not address these submissions in its Counter-Memorial, although its quantum expert, Mr. Kaczmarek, proposed that the Tribunal consider two alternative rates, LIBOR plus 4% and the US Prime Rate of Interest plus 2%.1196 Mr. Kaczmarek also suggested that interest should not run on any period which is attributable to delay by Kuntur Wasi in proving its expenses.1197\n\nClaimants' Memorial paras. 666 *et seq*.\n\n**Exhibit RER-1**, First Kaczmarek Report, paras. 200, 201. Since then, of course, LIBOR has ceased to exist.\n\n**Exhibit RER-1**, First Kaczmarek Report, para. 198.\n\n980.\n\nIn Reply, Claimants reiterated the position that interest should be based on the WACC and submitted that Respondent's alternatives were \"within range\" of 7.18%.1198 Respondent continued to maintain in its Rejoinder that the WACC is not appropriate and put forward two additional alternatives to the two put forward in its Counter-Memorial: 1)a ten-year US government bond yield; 2)the average US dollar lending rate in Peru.1199 The latter, Respondent submitted, was endorsed by Claimants' damages experts.1200 Respondent does not appear to contest the requested annual compounding.\n\nClaimants' Reply, para. 971.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, para. 622.\n\n*Id.*, citing to **Exhibit CER-4**, Second Compass Lexecon Report, paras. 111.\n\n981.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees with Claimants that interest from the date of breach to the date of payment of the award is appropriate to provide full compensation. The Tribunal found no delays attributable to Kuntur Wasi after that date (*i.e.*, 13 July 2017).\n\n982.\n\nWith respect to the question of what the appropriate interest rate would be, the Respondent's objection to the WACC appears to be that it considers the WACC to be a long-term interest rate, which is not appropriate on the facts of this case. Since there appears to be agreement between the Parties' experts that the average US dollar lending rate in Peru is an appropriate alternative rate, the Tribunal requests that the parties prepare a calculation based on that rate for the Tribunal's consideration.\n\n983.\n\nAs there appears to be no disagreement on the appropriateness of annual compounding, the calculation should proceed on this basis.\n\n984.\n\nGiven that the Tribunal has determined that it has jurisdiction over Kuntur Wasi, the question arises as to whether damages for a treaty breach should be made payable to Corporaci\u00f3n Am\u00e9rica or Kuntur Wasi. The Tribunal invites submissions of the Parties on this question. It also invites submissions on the taxability of the award in Peru under the two alternatives.\n\n**(4)Summary of Decisions and Further Instructions**\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n985.\n\nWith respect to the issues of quantum in this case, the Tribunal has decided as follows:\n\n(i)Damages for contractual breaches will be governed by the terms of the Concession Contract and/or Peruvian law, as appropriate, while damages for treaty breaches shall be governed by the terms of the BIT or international law, as appropriate;\n\n(ii)The damages that can be claimed for breach of the Concession Contract are those provided under Section 15.5 of that Contract, the *gastos incurridos*, *i.e.*, US$42.4 million, plus the value of the performance bond, US$8,687,826, with interest from the date of valuation, *i.e.,* 13 July 2017.\n\n(iii)The Guarantee Agreement does not augment the damages that are payable as a matter of contract or Peruvian law.\n\n(iv)For the FET breach, the *Chorzow Factory* standard of full reparation shall be applied, using the cost approach of calculating damages, which will value the Claimant's investment in the Project plus an entrepreneurial profit, plus any consequential damages that are not taken into account in the investment figure\n\n(v)in relation to the claimed costs:\n\na. no damages shall be paid in relation to the construction delay claim of US$4.9 million;\n\nb. the claims for the EDI of $27.6 million, bidding and structuring costs of US$6.1 million, financial structuring costs of US$2.0 million; supervisory costs of US$1.1 million payable to OSITRAN; taxes of US$1.3 million not associated with EDI, and operating expenses of US$4.4 million, shall be recoverable by Kuntur Wasi, for a total of US$42.5 million.\n\nc. entrepreneurial profit shall be calculated on the above damages by use of the same methodology as is described in paragraphs 892, 893 above (*i.e.*, the average of the two calculations described in paras. 892 and 893).\n\nd. The performance bond of US$8,687,826 million shall be treated as consequential damages.\n\ne. no damages shall be paid in relation to the PyC contingent claim of US$48.5 million for lost profits.\n\n(vi)no moral damages shall be due and owing.\n\n(vii)interest calculations on damages (including consequential damages as well as damages calculated under the costs approach)from the date of valuation shall be based on the average US dollar lending rate in Peru, compounded annually.\n\n986.\n\nThe Parties are instructed to make further submissions on the following questions:\n\n(i)First, as set forth in paragraph 964, a new calculation of damages under the cost approach, taking into account the items of cost this Decision has found to be admissible and no others, and applying the interest rate set forth in this Decision, needs to be performed.\n\n(ii)Second, as set forth in paragraph 982, the Tribunal requests that the parties provide a submission as to the average US dollar lending rate in Peru for the relevant period to date for the Tribunal's consideration.\n\n(iii)Third and finally, as set forth in paragraph 984, the Tribunal instructs the Parties to make submissions of the Parties on whether damages should be awarded to Kuntur Wasi, Corporaci\u00f3n Am\u00e9rica, or some combination of the two. It also instructs the Parties to make submissions on the taxability of the award in Peru under the two alternatives.\n\n987.\n\nThe additional submissions requested by the Tribunal should be made within thirty (30)days of the date this Decision is dispatched to the Parties. To the extent possible, the submissions should be made on a joint basis; the Parties are asked to use every reasonable effort to reach agreement. If, however, agreement cannot be reached between the Parties, the Parties may make separate submissions on the date specified, explaining any reasons for disagreement. The Tribunal will determine whether any follow-up submissions are required.\n\n988.\n\nThe Tribunal also instructs the Parties to make submissions on costs within fifteen (15)days of the submission(s)made pursuant to the preceding paragraph. A decision on costs will be reserved for the final Award.\n\nDate: 11 August 2023"}, {"Title": "Award", "Type": "Award (Final)", "Date": "2024-05-09T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "INTERNATIONAL CENTRE FOR SETTLEMENT OF INVESTMENT DISPUTES\n\nIn the arbitration proceeding between\n\nSociedad Aeroportuaria Kuntur Wasi S.A. and Corporaci\u00f3n Am\u00e9rica S.A.\n\nClaimants\n\nand\n\nRepublic of Peru\n\nRespondent\n\nICSID Case No. ARB/18/27\n\nAWARD\n\nMembers of the Tribunal Lucinda Low, President of the Tribunal Enrique Barros Bourie, Arbitrator Jos\u00e9 Emilio Nunes Pinto, Arbitrator\n\nSecretary of the Tribunal Patricia Rodr\u00edguez Mart\u00edn\n\nDate of dispatch to the Parties:\n\n9 May 2024\n\nRepresentation of the Parties\n\nRepresenting Sociedad Aeroportuaria Kuntur Representing the Republic of Peru:\n\nWasi S.A. and Corporaci\u00f3n Am\u00e9rica S.A.:\n\nMr. Henry G.

Republic of Peru. It follows from the Decision on Jurisdiction, Liability and Certain Aspects of Quantum, with Further Directions on Quantum, issued by the Tribunal on 11 August 2023 (the \u201cDecision\u201d), and now sets out in the form of an award that earlier Decision and the Tribunal\u2019s decisions relating to quantum and costs.\n* 2. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In its Decision, the Tribunal set out its decisions on jurisdiction and liability, together with its reasoning and with summaries of the procedural history and the factual background to the case as it stood at the time. The Decision is incorporated in this Award by reference and is attached as Appendix 1.1 Defined terms used in this Award shall have the same meaning as set forth in the Decision, unless otherwise expressly indicated herein.\n* 3. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In summary, in the Decision, the Tribunal decided that the Respondent breached the Concession Contract and the Guarantee Agreement as a result of the manner in which it decided to terminate, and ultimately terminated, the Concession Contract. Neither breach, however, was characterized by dolo or culpa inexcusable as those terms are defined in Peruvian law. The Tribunal further found that the Respondent\u2019s termination of the Contract constituted a violation of the FET standard set forth in Article 2(3) of the BIT, first sentence, as well as the proscription against unjustified treatment set forth in Article 2(3) of the BIT, second sentence.2\n* 4. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In relation to quantum, in paragraph 985 of the Decision \u2013 which set the background for this final stage in these proceedings \u2013 the Tribunal determined that the Claimants are entitled to: (A) a total of US$51,087,826 as Contract Damages, plus interest from the date of valuation;3 (B) and, for Treaty Damages: (i) costs invested in the Project in an amount of US$42.5 million;4 (ii) an entrepreneurial profit on the amount invested to be calculated by the Parties;5 (iii) US$8,687,826 million, representing the value of the performance bond, which is treated as consequential damage;6 and (iv) interest on the total amount of damages from the date of valuation, i.e., 13 July 2017, based on the average US dollar lending rate in Peru, compounded annually.7\n* 5. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In light of these decisions on quantum, in paragraph 986 of the Decision, the Tribunal requested the Parties to seek to use every reasonable effort to try to reach an agreement on the remaining issues relating to quantum and to make joint submissions to the Tribunal.8Failing agreement, the Parties were asked to make separate submissions on these points and explain any reasons for disagreement.\n* 6. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On 3 October 2023, the Parties informed the Tribunal that they had been able to reach agreement on the following matters (the \u201cParties\u2019 Joint Agreement\u201d):\n\n* 1. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Damages should be awarded to Sociedad Aeroportuaria Kuntur Wasi S.A. (\u201cKuntur Wasi\u201d).\n* 2. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Parties agree that the amounts awarded to Kuntur Wasi for the following category of damages shall not be subject to taxation by Peru:\n\nCosts (gastos incurridos) awarded to Kuntur Wasi under paragraph 985 (ii), (iv), (v)b and pursuant to paragraphs 929 and 963 of the Decision (i.e., US $42.5 million), and its corresponding interest.\n\n3. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Parties agree that the amounts awarded to Kuntur Wasi for the following categories of damages shall be subject to income tax by Peru at a rate of 29.5%:\n\n* a. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Entrepreneurial profit awarded under paragraph 985 (iv) and (v)c and pursuant to paragraphs 963 and 964 of the Decision, and its corresponding interest; and\n* b. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The value of the performance bond awarded to Kuntur Wasi under paragraph\n* 985 (ii) and (v)d, and pursuant to paragraphs 929 and 965 of the Decision (i.e., US $8,687,826), and its corresponding interest.9\n\n7. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On that same date, the Parties filed their supplemental submissions which sought to address the remaining issues raised by the Tribunal in its Decision. The Claimants\u2019 submission was accompanied by an \u201cOpinion on the Tribunal\u2019s Questions on Quantum\u201d of the same date signed by the Claimants\u2019 quantum experts Mr. Manuel A. Abdala and Mr. Pablo D. L\u00f3pez Zadicoff and two annexes. The Respondent\u2019s submission was accompanied by one Supplemental Expert Report prepared by its quantum expert Mr. Brent C. Kaczmarek and two attachments.\n\n### THE REMITS OF THE DECISION\n\n8. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As stated above, in paragraph 986 of the Decision, the Tribunal requested the Parties to try to reach agreement, and failing their agreement, to make separate submissions on the following three issues:\n\n* (i) \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0First, as set forth in paragraph 964, a new calculation of damages under the cost approach, taking into account the items of cost this Decision has found to be admissible and no others, and applying the interest rate set forth in this Decision, needs to be performed.\n* (ii) \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Second, as set forth in paragraph 982, the Tribunal requests that the parties provide a submission as to the average US dollar lending rate in Peru for the relevant period to date for the Tribunal\u2019s consideration.\n* (iii) \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Third and finally, as set forth in paragraph 984, the Tribunal instructs the Parties to make submissions of the Parties on whether damages should be awarded to Kuntur Wasi, Corporaci\u00f3n Am\u00e9rica, or some combination of the two. It also instructs the Parties to make submissions on the taxability of the award in Peru under the two alternatives.\n\n9. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Paragraph 964 of the Decision referenced in subparagraph (i) quoted above, states as follows:\n\n964. The Respondent\u2019s expert did not set forth any calculation of entrepreneurial profit in his initial report but addressed this in his second report. As a result of the Tribunal\u2019s conclusions that the market value of the Concession at the time of the breach was US$42.5 million, rather than US$34.4 million, however, a new calculation of entrepreneurial profit needs to be made. The Tribunal therefore instructs the parties to prepare a new calculation based on this decision. [internal footnotes omitted]\n\n10. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In paragraph 985, the Tribunal provided guidance on the approach that should be taken for the calculation of entrepreneurial profit:\n\nc. entrepreneurial profit shall be calculated on the above damages by use of the same methodology as is described in paragraphs 892, 893 above (i.e., the average of the two calculations described in paras. 892 and 893).\n\n11. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Paragraphs 892 and 893, referenced in the preceding paragraph, in turn read as follows: 892. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The entrepreneurial profit calculation is based on the average of two calculations: the Claimants\u2019 WACC over the three years they managed the Project, and a revised DCF comparison. The first of these calculations yields a total profit of 25.62%, which, applied to US$34.4 million, amounts to an entrepreneurial profit of US$8.8 million (and a market value conclusion of US$43.2 million). [internal footnotes omitted] (\u201cmethodology 1\u201d)\n\n893. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As to the second calculation, Mr. Kaczmarek relied on the DCF approach, making one adjustment to his DCF model (which includes Mr. Ricover\u2019s corrections): Mr. Kaczmarek assumed that the Chinchero Airport would have opened on schedule and therefore, all cash flows would [effectively] be discontinued by three fewer years as of 14 July 2017 (compared with 4 July 2014) given that the Project would have been three years closer to being operational. Under this approach, the entrepreneurial profit element would be calculated as the difference between the two DCF model results, which is US$9.7 million. Adding that amount to the costs (US$34.4 million), yields a market value conclusion of US$44.1 million. [internal footnotes omitted] (\u201cmethodology 2\u201d)\n\n12. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Finally, in relation to the interest rate, paragraph 982 of the Decision reads: 982. With respect to the question of what the appropriate interest rate would be, the Respondent\u2019s objection to the WACC appears to be that it considers the WACC to be a long-term interest rate, which is not appropriate on the facts of this case. Since there appears to be agreement between the Parties\u2019 experts that the average US dollar lending rate in Peru is an appropriate alternative rate, the Tribunal requests that the parties prepare a calculation based on that rate for the Tribunal\u2019s consideration.\n\n### \u0448 RELIEF SOUGHT\n\n13. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In its Memorial, the Claimant sought the following relief in these

Compass Lexecon suggests that the better approach is to calculate a single average rate for the entire relevant period, which yields an annual compound factor of 1.33x.21 The amounts that result from applying interest are reflected in the table below depending on the DCF method adopted.\n\nTable 4: FET Damages Results (US$)\n\n|  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | Abdala - L\u00f3pez Zadicoff DCF | Model Based on Decision Interpretation | Abdala - L\u00f3pez Zadicoff and Kaczmarek DCFs |\n| Costs Incurred | 42,500,000 | 42,500,000 | 42,500,000 |\n| Performance Bond | 8,687,286 | 8,687,286 | 8,687,286 |\n| Entrepreneurial Profit | 23,607,287 | 21,616,435 | 16,837,040 |\n| Total as of 7/13/2017 | 74,794,573 | 72,803,721 | 68,024,326 |\n| Compound Factor | 1.33x | 1.33x | 1.33x |\n| Interest | 24,670,806 | 24,014,129 | 22,437,657 |\n| Total as of 2/28/2024 | 99,465,379 | 96,817,849 | 90,461,983 |\n\n* ##### (3) \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Tax gross up\n\n22. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Claimants request that the Tribunal gross up the categories of damages that Peru admitted in the Parties\u2019 Joint Agreement that it would tax (i.e., the Performance Guarantee Bond, the entrepreneurial profit and interest), by 29.5%.22 According to the Claimants and their experts: (i) the calculations on the entrepreneurial profit are net of the income tax Kuntur Wasi would have had to pay in Peru and by taxing it, Peru is effectively reducing damages; (ii) the performance bond seeks to compensate the Claimants for Peru\u2019s improper conduct and Peru should therefore not benefit from the reduced amount that the Claimants would receive by collecting taxes on it; and (iii) interest seeks to compensate the Claimants for the delay in payment, which should not be reduced through a tax. 23\n\n* #### B. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0THE RESPONDENT\u2019S SUBMISSION\n\n* ##### (1) \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Entrepreneurial profit\n\n* 23. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Respondent and its expert, Mr. Kaczmarek, submitted an updated valuation of the entepreneurial profit using the two methodologies referred to in paragraphs 892 and 893 of the Decision:\n* 24. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Methodology 1 took the 7.59% discount rate found in the 2013 ProInversi\u00f3n study and applied this rate for three years (which resulted in a total profit of 24.5%). This profit was then applied to Kuntur Wasi\u2019s allowable costs accepted by the Tribunal in the Decision (in the amount of US$42.5 million), totalling US$10,430,336 in entrepreneurial profit.24\n* 25. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As to methodology 2, Mr. Kaczmarek submits that the calculation is unaffected by the Tribunal\u2019s decisions related to allowable cost, as the decision as to which costs are compensable does not factor into the anticipated cash flows for the Concession.25Therefore, the estimate of entrepreneurial profit under the second methodology remained at US$9,703,250.26\n* 26. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The result of averaging the two approaches is an entrepreneurial profit of US$10,066,793.27\n\nTable 3 - Revised Calculation of Claimants\u2019 Damages Using the Cost Approach\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Component | Value |\n| Costs Incurred | 42,500,000 |\n| Entrepreneurial Profit | 10,066,793 |\n| Consequential Damages | 8,687,826 |\n| Total | 61,254,619 |\n\n* 27. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Respondent and Mr. Kaczmarek take issue with the fact that Compass Lexecon recreated its own DCF model based on an interpretation of the Tribunal\u2019s comments on the various inputs used in the Income Approach.28 According to the Respondent and its expert, the Tribunal merely asked the Parties to recalculate the entepreneurial profit using the same methodology presented by Mr. Kaczmarek in his Second Report but using a higher cost figure identified by the Tribunal in its Decision.29\n* 28. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Furthermore, the Respondent\u2019s expert also critizices Compass Lexecon\u2019s calculation because: (i) it does not make any adjustments to costs or non-aeronautical revenues; (ii) it produces a valuation of US$163.6 million, which is inconsistent with the Tribunal\u2019s decision that the value of the Concession at the time of termination was approximately US$42.5 million; and (iii) because it suggests that the Concession was worth US$130.8 million as of the bid acceptance date, which is also inconsistent with the Tribunal\u2019s decision that the value of the Concession was near zero as of the date when the Claimants\u2019 bid was accepted.30\n\n* ##### (2) \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Calculation of interest\n\n29. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Respondent\u2019s expert confirmed that the data source and the historical figures for the interest rate calculations are agreed with the Claimants\u2019 experts. The only difference with the Claimants\u2019 experts in relation to interest lies in the fact that the Respondent applies the U.S. dollar lending rate in Peru for each full year, at which point interest is compounded and the interest rate as of that date is applied for the following year \u2013 as opposed to averaging the rate for the entire relevant period.31 According to Mr. Kaczmarek, the Respondent\u2019s approach is more consistent with the economic reality of how the Claimants would have been affected by changes in short-term (one year) borrowing rates. Moreover, given the current rising interest rate environment, a single average interest rate is likely to increase the interest due in past years even though interest rates were lower historically.32 Based on his methodology, the Respondent\u2019s expert calculates the Claimants\u2019 loss, including interest through 28 February 2024, to be US$80,847,255.33\n\n* ##### (3) \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Tax Gross up\n\n30. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Respondent contends that a tax gross up for applicable Peruvian taxes is not required to provide full compensation. As to the entrepreneurial profit, the Respondent argues that the analysis that the Tribunal is entrusted to carry out is akin to a simulated transaction on the valuation date in that it compensates the Claimants for the amounts they would have obtained had they sold their interest in the Concession on the valuation date. Under normal circumstances, when a company receives a profit for the sale of its assets, the company is required to pay taxes on that profit.34 As to the performance bond, the Respondent argues that the Concession Contract does not provide that that value would be granted \u201cfree of tax\u201d and therefore there is no reason to exempt the Claimants from their tax obligations under Peruvian law.35\n\n* ### v. THE TRIBUNAL\u2019S DECISIONS ON QUANTUM\n\n* 31. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At the outset, the Tribunal notes the Parties\u2019 agreement that all damages awarded to the Claimants should be awarded to Kuntur Wasi. 36\u00a0In order to avoid any risk of double recovery, the Claimants have requested that the Tribunal order payment to Kuntur Wasi of Treaty damages only. 37\u00a0They have further confirmed that they will not seek recovery of contract damages or damages under the Guarantee Agreement, if the Tribunal agrees with this request and \u201cPeru effectively pays\u201d. 38\u00a0The Tribunal accepts the Parties\u2019 agreement on payment to Kuntur Wasi and directs the Claimants not to seek to collect damages under the Contract or the Guarantee Agreement.\n* 32. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0There are three issues remaining to be determined by the Tribunal: (1) the amount of entrepreneurial profit for Treaty damages; (2) the method by which interest is to be calculated; and (3) whether there should be any gross-ups for Peruvian taxes levied on Kuntur Wasi in relation to the entrepreneurial profit, performance bond, or interest.\n\n#### Entrepreneurial profit\n\n33. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0With respect to the issue of the amount of entrepreneurial profit for Treaty damages, the Tribunal considers that the Respondent\u2019s calculation is the more appropriate one. The Tribunal agrees with the Respondent that the calculation of the Claimants under their interpretation of the \u201crevised DCF comparison\u201d is inconsistent with the Decision in its implied valuation of the Contract and would provide the Claimants with a windfall. Accordingly, the Tribunal determines that the entrepreneurial profit to be used in the calculation of damages is US$10,066,793.\n\n#### \u0432. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0INTEREST\n\n34. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0With respect to the calculation of interest, the Tribunal likewise considers the approach taken by the Respondent to be the more appropriate one. Calculating interest based on the average lending rate for each calendar year from the date of valuation, 13 July 2017 (taking into account the current average rate in July, i.e., the month in which the Contract was terminated), rather than an average for the entire period, is more consistent not only with the instructions of the Tribunal but also with economic reality and general practice. Furthermore, it avoids the distortive effect, in a period of rising interest rates, that a calculation for the entire period would produce. Accordingly, the Tribunal determines that interest should be calculated starting on the date of breach and continuing to the date of payment based on the average U.S. dollar lending rate in July of each year based on the average rate for the preceding 12 months. Using this approach, total damages through 28 February 2024 amount to US$80,847,255.\n\n#### Tax Gross-Up\n\n* 35. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0With respect to the third issue, the tax gross-up, the parties are in agreement that the entrepreneurial profit and the performance bond are subject to income tax in Peru at the rate of 29.5%. They disagree, however, as to whether each of those categories of damage should be grossed up for such taxes.\n* 36. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the Tribunal\u2019s view, the entrepreneurial profit has the character of ordinary income and it would therefore be logical to subject receipts of this nature to taxation in Peru when received by Kuntur Wasi. However, it appears to the Tribunal that the calculations of the amount of entrepreneurial profit to Kuntur Wasi were in fact reduced by both parties\u2019 experts to take into account income taxes, such that not grossing up this element would effectively penalize Kuntur Wasi.\n* 37. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Second Report of the Respondent\u2019s expert, Mr. Kaczmarek, contains a calculation of entrepreneurial profit under Methodology 1 based on the WACC for the Project. The formula adopted by Mr. Kaczmarek includes the element of income tax under the variable \u201cT\u201d, which in September 2013 was apparently 33.3%.39 Thus, it appears to the Tribunal that his calculation reduced the amount of entrepreneurial profit by the amount of anticipated income tax.\n* 38. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Under methodology 2, Mr. Kaczmarek calculated the entrepreneurial profit based on the DCF between 2014 and 2017. Mr. Kaczmarek\u2019s calculation, using figures from Compass Lexecon which were also confirmed by Mr. Ricover, explicitly took into account income taxes of 29.5% in his calculation of \u201cFlujo Libre de Caja \u2013 Kuntur Wasi\u201d.40\n* 39. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Indeed, Compass Lexecon notes in its Opinion on the Tribunal\u2019s Questions on Quantum dated 3 October 2023 that \u201cthe entrepreneurial profit calculations, both in ours and Mr. Kaczmarek\u2019s models, have been computed net of the income tax the Project would have had to pay in Peru.\u201d41\n* 40. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Thus, both methods of calculating entrepreneurial profit appear to reduce the amount for anticipated taxes in Peru, at the same 29.5% rate that the parties now agree is the relevant tax rate. It therefore appears to the Tribunal that not grossing up this amount correspondingly would inappropriately reduce the amount of damages payable to Kuntur Wasi in relation to this element. Accordingly, the Tribunal has determined that the amount of entrepreneurial profit it has awarded in paragraph 30 above, namely, US$10,066,793, should be grossed up for income taxes at the agreed rate.\n* 41. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As for the amount payable in respect of the value of the performance guarantee bond (valor de la garantia de fiel cumplimiento), while the Concession Contract does not define the legal character of the bond\u2019s value, the Tribunal accepts the Claimants\u2019 submission that it represents a kind of penalty designed as compensation for the improper termination of the Contract.42 From the perspective of international law, the Chorzow Factory principles state that the Claimants are entitled to full compensation for the losses incurred as a result of the Treaty violations, including consequential damages such as the value of the performance bond.43\n* 42. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Parties seem to agree on the taxability in Peru of the value of the performance bond. The Tribunal therefore determines that, to the extent payment of this bond\u2019s value by the Respondent generates income tax consequences to Kuntur Wasi, the amount payable should be grossed up to ensure that Kuntur Wasi receives the full value established in the Decision (i.e., US$8,687,826).\n* 43. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0With respect to the interest payable on the various components of damages, the Tribunal is of the view that whether to gross up any interest turns on the concept to which it is attached. If the concept is taxable, and subject to gross-up under the decisions of this Tribunal, so interest on that concept should be subject to gross-up to the date of payment of the amounts established in this Award, to ensure full compensation. Accordingly, both interest on the entrepreneurial profit and the performance bond, to the extent taxable in the case of the latter, should be correspondingly grossed up from the Valuation Date of 13 July 2017 to the date of payment of the amounts established in this Award.\n* 44. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Claimants have submitted that 29.5% would be the rate at which any income deemed to accrue to Kuntur Wasi would be taxed by Peru at this time, a rate that has not been disputed by the Respondent. Accordingly, unless any taxation of this element is renounced by Peru, the value of the entrepreneurial profit, performance bond, and any interest associated with these concepts should be grossed up by that amount.\n* 45. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In summary, the Tribunal decides with respect to the remaining damage issues as follows:\n\n* a. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0With respect to entrepreneurial profit, the Tribunal awards damages to Kuntur Wasi, in an amount of US$10,066,793, plus interest, to be grossed up by 29.5% for Peruvian income taxes.\n* b. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0With respect to interest, it shall be calculated from the date of breach, 13 July 2017, to the date of full payment of the amounts established in this Award, based on the average U.S. dollar lending rate in force in July of each year averaged for the preceding 12 months, as calculated by the Respondent.\n* c. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The value of the performance bond, if subject to taxation in Peru upon payment to Kuntur Wasi, plus interest, shall be grossed up for such taxes, at the rate of 29.5% for any Peruvian income taxes.\n\n46. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Together with the damages established in the Decision, the total damages payable to Kuntur Wasi are therefore as follows:\n\n### VI \u00a0\u00a0COSTS\n\n#### A. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0THE CLAIMANTS\u2019 COSTS\n\n* 47. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Claimants submit that they incurred a total of US$7,942,938.81 in costs, fees and expenses in connection with the present arbitration (excluding advances made to ICSID).

Such decision shall form part of the award.\n\n* 54. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This provision gives the Tribunal discretion to allocate all costs of the arbitration, including attorney\u2019s fees and other costs, between the Parties as it deems appropriate.\n* 55. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As the Parties\u2019 cost submissions reflect, this was a complex case, with 10 contract claims and 4 Treaty claims. Although the Claimants prevailed on several of their claims, they did not prevail on all aspects of those claims, in particular with respect to the contract claims, that the termination was carried out with dolo or culpa inexcusable (gross negligence). They asserted a number of claims on which they did not prevail. The applicable arbitration rules give the Tribunal discretion regarding whether and how to allocate costs. After deliberation, the Tribunal has determined that each Party should bear its own legal and expert costs and share in the costs of the proceeding equally.\n\n### VIL DECISIONS AND AWARD\n\n56. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As reflected in the Decision, the Tribunal has decided as follows:\n\n* a. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0that it has jurisdiction over Kuntur Wasi\u2019s Treaty claims under both the ICSID Convention and the BIT;49\n* b. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0with respect to the contractual claims of the Claimants, that:\n\n* i. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Peru breached the Concession Contract by terminating it without a well- founded reason of public interest;50 however, in doing so, Peru did not act in bad faith and in violation of the doctrine of actos propios;51\n* ii. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0the termination communicated by Peru on 13 July 2017 did not have the effect of terminating the contractual relationship and that the latter remained in force until the termination communicated by Kuntur Wasi on 7 February 2018;52\n* iii. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Peru\u2019s failure to make the Advance Payment did not constitute a breach of its obligations under the Concession Contract, as amended; 53\n* iv. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Peru\u2019s demand for early return of the Concession area did not constitute a contractual breach; 54\n* v. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Peru did not breach the Concession Contract by failing to pay for the EDI (without prejudice to full compensation for the EDI as an element of damage for wrongful termination);55\n* vi. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Peru did not repudiate the Concession Contract by its statements regarding non-compliance;56\n* vii. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Peru\u2019s conduct was a violation of the Guarantee Agreement as well as of the Concession Contract, albeit one without further consequences as a matter of Peruvian law; 57\n* viii. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Peru did not act with dolo or culpa inexcusable in connection with its contractual breach;58\n* ix. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Peru is not liable for asserted damage to the image, honor and good reputation of Kuntur Wasi and its shareholders. 59\n\n* c. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0With respect to the Treaty claims asserted by the Claimants, that Peru\u2019s conduct violated the positive obligation set forth in Article 2(3) of the BIT to provide fair and equitable treatment to the Claimants\u2019 investments,60 as well as the negative obligation set forth in that same article not to engage in conduct prejudicing the management, maintenance, use, enjoyment or disposition through unjustified measures. 61\u00a0The Tribunal considered it unnecessary, in light of its determination that these provisions were violated, to decide the Claimants\u2019 remaining Treaty claims, for expropriation, and failure to provide full protection and security, as well as its claim under an umbrella clause it sought to have imported by virtue of the Treaty\u2019s MFN provision.62\n* d. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0With respect to damages, the Tribunal\u2019s decisions were set out in paragraph 985 of the Decision, as follows:\n\n985. With respect to the issues of quantum in this case, the Tribunal has decided as follows:\n\n* (i) \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Damages for contractual breaches will be governed by the terms of the Concession Contract and/or Peruvian law, as appropriate, while damages for treaty breaches shall be governed by the terms of the BIT or international law, as appropriate;\n* (ii) \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The damages that can be claimed for breach of the Concession Contract are those provided under Section 15.5 of that Contract, the gastos incurridos, i.e., US$42.4 million, plus the value of the performance bond, US$8,687,826, with interest from the date of valuation, i.e., 13 July 2017.\n* (iii) \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Guarantee Agreement does not augment the damages that are payable as a matter of contract or Peruvian law.\n* (iv) \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For the FET breach, the Chorzow Factory standard of full reparation shall be applied, using the cost approach of calculating damages, which will value the Claimant\u2019s investment in the Project plus an entrepreneurial profit, plus any consequential damages that are not taken into account in the investment figure.\n* (v) \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0in relation to the claimed costs:\n\n* a. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0no damages shall be paid in relation to the construction delay claim of US$4.9 million;\n* b. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0the claims for the EDI of $27.6 million, bidding and structuring costs of US$6.1 million, financial structuring costs of US$2.0 million; supervisory costs of US$1.1 million payable to OSITRAN; taxes of US$1.3 million not associated with EDI, and operating expenses of US$4.4 million, shall be recoverable by Kuntur Wasi, for a total of US$42.5 million.\n* c. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0entrepreneurial profit shall be calculated on the above damages by use of the same methodology as is described in paragraphs 892, 893 above (i.e., the average of the two calculations described in paras. 892 and 893).\n* d. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The performance bond of US$8,687,826 million shall be treated as consequential damages.\n* e. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0no damages shall be paid in relation to the PyC contingent claim of US$48.5 million for lost profits.\n\n* (vi) \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0no moral damages shall be due and owing.\n* (vii) \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0interest calculations on damages (including consequential damages as well as damages calculated under the costs approach) from the date of valuation shall be based on the average US dollar lending rate in Peru, compounded annually.\n\ne. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Tribunal instructed the parties to make further submissions on the following questions relating to damages:\n\n* (i) \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0First, as set forth in paragraph 964, a new calculation of damages under the cost approach, taking into account the items of cost this Decision has found to be admissible and no others, and applying the interest rate set forth in this Decision, needs to be performed.\n* (ii) \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Second, as set forth in paragraph 982, the Tribunal requests that the parties provide a submission as to the average US dollar lending rate in Peru for the relevant period to date for the Tribunal\u2019s consideration.\n* (iii) \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Third and finally, as set forth in paragraph 984, the Tribunal instructs the Parties to make submissions of the Parties on whether damages should be awarded to Kuntur Wasi, Corporaci\u00f3n Am\u00e9rica, or some combination of the two.\n\nIt also instructs the Parties to make submissions on the taxability of the award in Peru under the two alternatives. 63\n\n57. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0These decisions are incorporated into this Award as noted earlier and reaffirmed. With respect to the remaining damages issues not addressed by the Joint Agreement, the Tribunal has decided as follows:\n\n* a. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0the entrepreneurial profit to be used in the calculation of damages is US$10,066,793;\n* b. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0interest should be calculated starting on the date of breach, 13 July 2017, and continuing to the date of payment based on the average U.S. dollar lending rate in July of each year based on the average rate for the preceding 12 months; and\n* c. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Entrepreneurial profit and the performance bond, and accrued interest thereon, should be grossed up for Peruvian taxes at the rate of 29.5%.\n\n* 58. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In light of the Claimants\u2019 undertaking to seek damages for Treaty breaches only, to avoid double recovery, and the parties\u2019 agreement that damages should be paid to Kuntur Wasi, the Tribunal orders that damages in the amount of US$91,205,056 (including interest to 28 February 2024) should be paid to Kuntur Wasi, together with any additional interest that has accrued at the rate established in this Award to the date of payment; compounded annually.\n* 59. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Each Party shall bear its own legal and expert costs in this matter and shall share equally in the administrative costs of the proceedings.\n\nIt is so ordered.\n\nIssued in English and Spanish on 9 May 2024, with both versions being equally authentic.\n\n[Signed]\n\nEmique Barros Bourie Arbitrator\n\nDate: MAY 06 2024\n\n[Signed]\n\nJose Emilio Nunes Pinto Arbitrator\n\nDate: MAY O 6 2024\n\n[Signed] Lucinda Low President of the Tribunal\n\nDate: MAY O 9 202,\n\nAPPENDIX 1\n\n  \n\nDecision on Jurisdiction, Liability and Certain Aspects of Quantum, with Quantum\n\n  \n  \n  \n\nDirections on\n\n  \n\n1\n\nThe Tribunal has made a correction to paragraph 914 of the Decision.
