Procedure**\n----------------\n\n1.\n\nOn April 17, 2003, the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (\"ICSID\" or \"the Centre\") received a Request for Arbitration (\"the Request\") against the Argentine Republic (\"the Respondent\" or \"Argentina\") from Aguas Provinciales de Santa Fe S.A. (\"APSF\"), Suez, Sociedad General de Aguas de Barcelona S.A. (\"AGBAR\") and InterAguas Servicios Integrates del Agua S.A. (\"InterAguas\" together, \"the Claimants\"). APSF is a company incorporated in Argentina. Suez, incorporated in France, and AGB AR and InterAguas, both incorporated in Spain, were major shareholders in APSF. The Request concerned the Claimants\u2019 investments in a concession for water distribution and waste water treatment in the Argentine Province of Santa Fe and a series of alleged acts and omissions by Argentina, including Argentina\u2019s alleged failure or refusal to apply previously agreed adjustments to the tariff calculation and adjustment mechanisms.1\n\nOn the same date, the Centre received two further requests for arbitration under the ICSID Convention regarding water concessions in Argentina from (i) Aguas Cordobesas S.A., Suez, and Sociedad General de Aguas de Barcelona S.A. and (ii) Aguas Argentinas S.A., Suez, Sociedad General de Aguas de Barcelona S.A. and Vivendi Universal S.A. regarding similar investments and disputes. As explained below, these requests would later be registered by the Centre and submitted by agreement of the parties to one same Tribunal.\n\n2.\n\nIn the Request, the Claimants invoked Argentina\u2019s consent to dispute settlement through ICSID arbitration provided in the 1991 Bilateral Investment Treaty between France and the Argentine Republic (the \"Argentina-France BIT\")2 and in the 1991 Bilateral Investment Treaty between the Argentine Republic and the Kingdom of Spain (the \"Argentina-Spain BIT\").3\n\nAccord entre le Gouvernement de la R\u00e9publique fran\u00e7aise et le Gouvernement de la R\u00e9publique Argentine sur T encouragement et la protection r\u00e9ciproques des investissements (Agreement between the Argentine Republic and the Republic of France for the Promotion and Reciprocal Protection of Investments), signed on July 3, 1991 and in force since March 3, 1993; 1728 UNTS 298.\n\nAcuerdo para la promoci\u00f3n y protecci\u00f3n rec\u00edprocas de inversiones entre el Reino de Espa\u00f1a y la Rep\u00fablica Argentina (Agreement on the Promotion and Reciprocal Protection of Investments between the Kingdom of Spain and the Argentine Republic), signed in Buenos Aires on October 3, 1991 and in force since September 28, 1992; 1699 UNTS 202.\n\n3.\n\nOn April 17, 2003, the Centre, in accordance with Rule 5 of the ICSID Rules of Procedure for the Institution of Conciliation and Arbitration Proceedings (Institution Rules), acknowledged receipt and transmitted a copy of the Request to the Argentine Republic and to the Argentine Embassy in Washington D.C.\n\n4.\n\nOn July 17, 2003, the Acting Secretary-General of the Centre registered the Request, pursuant to Article 36(3) of the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of other States (the \"ICSID Convention\" or \"the Convention\"). The case was registered as ICSID Case No. ARB/03/17 with the formal heading of Aguas Provinciales de Santa Fe S.A., Suez, Sociedad General de Aguas de Barcelona S.A. and Interagua Servicios Integrates del Agua S.A. v. Argentine Republic.4 On that same date, the Acting Secretary-General, in accordance with Institution Rule 7, notified the parties of the registration of the Request and invited them to proceed, as soon as possible, to constitute an Arbitral Tribunal.\n\nAs noted in footnote 1 supra, on this same date the Centre registered two further requests for arbitration regarding water concessions in Argentina: ICSID Case No. ARB/03/18 (Aguas Cordobesas S.A., Suez, and AGBAR v. Argentine Republic) and ICSID Case No. ARB/03/19 (Aguas Argentinas S.A., Suez, AGBAR and Vivendi Universal S.A. v. Argentine Republic).\n\n5.\n\nThe parties could not reach an agreement on the number of arbitrators to comprise the arbitral tribunal nor on the method for their appointment. Accordingly, on 22 September 2003, the Claimants requested the Tribunal to be constituted in accordance with the formula set forth in Article 37(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention; i.e. one arbitrator appointed by each party, and the third arbitrator, who would serve as president of the tribunal, to be appointed by agreement of the parties. The Claimants appointed Professor Gabrielle Kaufmann-Kohler, a Swiss national, as arbitrator. The Argentine Republic in turn appointed as arbitrator Professor Pedro Nikken, a national of Venezuela.\n\n6.\n\nIn the absence of an agreement between the parties on the name of the presiding arbitrator, on October 21, 2003 the Claimants, invoking Article 38 of the ICSID Convention and Rule 4 of the ICSID Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings (Arbitration Rules), requested the Centre to make this appointment. With the agreement of both parties, the Centre appointed Professor Jeswald W. Salacuse, a national of the United States of America, as the President of the Tribunal.\n\n7.\n\nOn February 17, 2004, the Deputy Secretary-General of ICSID, in accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 6(1), notified the parties that all three arbitrators had accepted their appointments and that the Tribunal was therefore deemed to be constituted and the proceedings to have begun on that date.5 On the same date, pursuant to ICSID Administrative and Financial Regulation 25, the parties were informed that Mr. Gonzalo Flores, Senior Counsel, ICSID, would serve as Secretary of the Arbitral Tribunal.\n\nThe parties agreed that this same Tribunal would decide ICSID Cases Nos. ARB/03/18 and ARB/03/19. The parties also agreed that this same Tribunal would decide the dispute between AWG Group Pic., a company incorporated in the United Kingdom, and the Argentine Republic. The proceedings in this last case, instituted under the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules, are also being administered by ICSID following the parties\u2019 agreement and the Tribunal\u2019s consent.\n\n8.\n\nUnder ICSID Arbitration Rule 13, the Tribunal shall hold its first session within 60 days after its constitution or such other period as the parties may agree. The parties could not agree on a suitable date for the first session within the prescribed time limits. The Tribunal accordingly held its first session without the parties via telephone conference on April 19, 2004.\n\n9.\n\nOn June 7, 2004, the Tribunal held a session with the parties at the seat of the Centre in Washington, D.C. During the session the parties confirmed their agreement that the Tribunal had been properly constituted in accordance with the relevant provisions of the ICSID Convention and the ICSID Arbitration Rules and that they did not have any objections in this respect.\n\n10.\n\nDuring the session the parties also agreed on a number of procedural matters reflected in written minutes signed by the President and the Secretary of the Tribunal.6 The Tribunal, after consultation with the parties, fixed the following timetable for the written and oral pleadings in this case:\n\n*(1)*  ***Merits***  *(in the event Argentina raised no objections to jurisdiction):*\n\na. The Claimants would file a memorial on the merits within one hundred and five (105) days from the date of the session, i.e., no later than September 20, 2004;\n\nb. The Respondent would file a counter-memorial on the merits within one hundred and twenty (120) days from its receipt of the Claimants\u2019 memorial;\n\nc. The Claimants would file a reply on the merits within sixty (60) days from their receipt of the Respondent\u2019s counter-memorial;\n\nd. The Respondent would file its rejoinder on the merits within sixty (60) days from its receipt of the Claimants\u2019 reply; and\n\ne. The Tribunal would thereafter hold a hearing on the merits. The Tribunal envisaged holding this hearing on July 11-20, 2005, which dates the parties agreed to reserve for this purpose.\n\n*(2)*  ***Jurisdiction***  *(in the event Argentina raised objections to jurisdiction) :*\n\na. If the Respondent decides to file objections to jurisdiction, it would do so within sixty (60) days from its receipt of the Claimants\u2019 memorial on the merits;\n\nb. Thereafter the proceedings on the merits would be suspended in accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 41(3);\n\nc. The Claimants would file their counter-memorial on jurisdiction within sixty (60) days from their receipt of the Respondent\u2019s objections to jurisdiction; and\n\nd. The Tribunal would thereafter hold a hearing on jurisdiction. The Tribunal envisaged holding this hearing on May 9, 2005, which date the parties agreed to reserve for this purpose.\n\n*(3)* If the Tribunal decides that it has jurisdiction or to join the question of jurisdiction to the merits of the dispute, the proceedings on the merits would be resumed and:\n\na. The Respondent would have for the filing of its counter-memorial on the merits the number of days equal to the original one hundred and twenty (120) less the number of days used for the filing of its objections to jurisdiction;\n\nb. The Claimants would then file their reply on the merits within sixty (60) days from their receipt of the Respondent\u2019s counter-memorial;\n\nc. The Respondent would file its rejoinder on the merits within sixty (60) days from its receipt of the Claimants\u2019 reply; and\n\nd. The Tribunal would then, in consultation with the parties as far as possible, fix a date for a hearing.\n\nDuring the session the parties agreed on a series of procedural matters related to the present case, ICSID Cases Nos. ARB/03/18 and ARB/03/19 and the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules instituted by AWG Group Pic. These agreements included a staggered schedule of written and oral submissions. A copy of the minutes of the session is enclosed as Annex. No. 1 to this Decision.\n\n11.\n\nIn accordance with the agreed timetable, on September 20, 2004, the Claimants filed their Memorial on the Merits with accompanying documentation. On November 26, 2004 Argentina filed its Memorial with objections to jurisdiction.\n\n12.\n\nBy letter of December 3, 2004, the Tribunal confirmed the suspension of the proceedings on the merits in accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 41(3). On February 1, 2005, the Claimants filed their Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction.\n\n13.\n\nAs agreed upon during the June 7, 2004 session, a hearing on jurisdiction was held at the seat of the Centre in Washington, D.C. on May 9, 2005. Messrs. Nigel Blackaby and Lluis Paradell and Ms. Noiana Marigo, from the law firm of Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer LLP, Mr. Bernardo Iriberri, from the Buenos Aires-based law firm of Estudio Cardenas Cassagne y Asociados, Messrs. Jean-Paul Minette and Patrice Herbert from Suez Environment and Mr. Miquel Gri\u00f1o, from AGBAR, attended the hearing on behalf of the Claimants. Messrs. Jorge Barraguirre and Ignacio Torterola from the Procuraci\u00f3n del Tesoro de la Naci\u00f3n Argentina, attended the hearing on behalf of the Respondent. Also present on behalf of the Respondent were Ms. Liliana Campomanes from CEARINSA (Comisi\u00f3n de Estudio de Arbitrajes Internacionales de la Provincia de Santa Fe), Mr. Carlos Reyna from the Ente Regulador de Servicios Sanitarios de la Provincia de Santa Fe and Mr. F\u00e9lix L\u00f3pez Amaya, of the Fiscal\u00eda de Estado of the Province of C\u00f3rdoba. During the hearing Messrs. Blackaby and Paradell addressed the Tribunal on behalf of the Claimants. Messrs. Barraguirre and Torterola addressed the Tribunal on behalf of the Argentine Republic. The Tribunal posed questions to the parties, as provided in Rule 32(3) of the Arbitration Rules.\n\n14.\n\nOn June 22, 2005, a *Petici\u00f3n de Participaci\u00f3n como Amicus Curiae* (Petition for Participation as Amicus Curiae) was submitted to the Tribunal by *Fundaci\u00f3n para el Desarrollo Sustentable,* a Santa Fe-based non-governmental organization, and three individuals. Following the filing of the *Petici\u00f3n,* the Tribunal invited the parties to file any observations they may have in this regard, and both parties submitted their views on this matter. On March 17, 2006, the Tribunal issued an Order in Response to a Petition for Participation as Amicus Curiae (available online at ICSID\u2019s web site at www.worldbank.org/icsid) setting out the conditions under which the Tribunal would consider amicus curiae submissions.7\n\nThis request follows a similar request filed by four non-governmental organization in ICSID Case No.ARB/03/19. The Tribunal\u2019s Order of May 19, 2005, is available online at ICSID\u2019s website www.worldbank.org/icsid.\n\n15.\n\nFollowing the hearing on jurisdiction, the Respondent at various times filed unsolicited documents and arguments further contesting the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction. On each occasion, the Tribunal requested the Claimants views on these arguments and documents, and the Claimants totally rejected them each time. Finding that the Respondent had a full and complete opportunity to present their objections to jurisdiction in their memorial and oral arguments at the hearing on jurisdiction and finding further that the arguments presented in these unsolicited filing duplicated those that the Respondents had submitted in their oral arguments and memorial, the Tribunal by letter of March 24, 2006 requested the parties to refrain from making any new unsolicited submissions.\n\n16.\n\nBy letter of January 11, 2006, counsel for the Claimants informed the Tribunal that APSF \"in compliance with a condition imposed by the province of Santa Fe for its approval of the sale of Claimant Shareholders\u2019 interest in APSF to Alberdi Aguas S.A.... has decided to withdraw its claim in the above-referenced arbitration\" but that such withdrawal was expressly without prejudice to the Claimant Shareholders\u2019 claims in this proceeding. Upon invitation of the Tribunal, the Respondent filed its observations to this withdrawal by letter of February 8, 2006. The Respondent did not object to the withdrawal of APSF but requested that APSF provide copies of the minutes of the shareholders\u2019 meeting *(Asamblea de Accionistas de APSF)* with respect to the decision authorizing such withdrawal. At the same time, Respondent advanced further arguments objecting to the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction and claiming that APSF\u2019s decision to withdraw extinguished the claims of the other claimants in this case. At the invitation of the Tribunal, counsel for APSF provided copies of the minutes of the APSF\u2019s shareholders\u2019 meeting of May 4, 2005 and of the APSF\u2019s board of directors\u2019 meeting of January 10, 2006, authorizing the discontinuance of its claim before this Tribunal. At the same time, counsel for the Claimants rejected each of the Respondent\u2019s arguments challenging the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction with respect to the other Claimants. The Tribunal provided copies of these documents to the Respondent and requested its observation concerning APSF\u2019s withdrawal. By letter of March 31, 2006, the Respondent informed the Tribunal that \"... the Argentine Republic does not oppose the proposed cessation by the Concessionaire... APSF...\" in ICSID arbitration ARB/03/17 (\"... *la Rep\u00fablica Argentina no se opone al desistimiento planteado por la[s] Concesionaria[s] APSF...* \"), (para. 9) but argued that such withdrawal had legal consequences with respect to the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction over the Shareholder Claimants and their claims.\n\n17.\n\nIn its deliberations on this request, the Tribunal found that neither the ICSID Convention nor the Rules specifically provide for the withdrawal of one party from an arbitration proceeding that is to continue thereafter. ICSID Arbitration Rule 44, the provision of closest relevance to the action requested by the Claimant APSF, allows the discontinuation of an arbitration proceeding at the request of a party when the other party does not object. But Arbitration Rule 44 by a strict reading of its terms does not apply to the withdrawal of a single party. Nonetheless, the Tribunal, relying on Article 44 of the ICSID Convention, which grants ICSID tribunals the power to decide procedural questions not covered by the Convention or the Rules, concluded that it had the power to order the discontinuance of proceedings with respect to one party at its request when the other party did not object. The Tribunal found that permitting such discontinuance in the conditions presented by this case was in accordance with the basic objective of the ICSID Convention of facilitating the settlement of investment disputes, of which ICSID Arbitration Rule 44 is a specific manifestation. It also was of the view that the continued participation of APSF in this proceeding would serve no useful purpose in bringing about a fair and correct resolution of the present arbitration.\n\n18.\n\nOn April 14, 2006, the Tribunal therefore entered Procedural Order No. 1 Concerning the Discontinuance of Proceedings with Respect to Aguas Provinciales de Santa Fe S.A. (available online at www.worldbank.org/icsid), directing that: (i) the proceedings in ICSID Case No. ARB/03/17 with respect to the Claimant Aguas Provinciales de Santa Fe S.A. be discontinued and that the said Claimant Aguas Provinciales de Santa Fe cease to be a party with effect from April 14, 2006; and (ii) that the proceedings in ICSID Case No ARB/03/17 continue in all other respects. With respect to the Respondents arguments that the withdrawal of APSF from the case had implications for the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction over the Shareholder Claimants and their claims, the Tribunal concluded that these objections were more appropriately addressed in its decision on jurisdiction. They are in fact considered in subsequent sections of the present decision.\n\n19.\n\nThe Tribunal has deliberated on the parties\u2019 written submissions on the question of jurisdiction and on the oral arguments delivered in the course of the May 9, 2005 hearing. Having considered the relevant facts and evidence, the ICSID Convention, the Argentina-France BIT, the Argentina-Spain BIT, as well as the written and oral submissions of the parties\u2019 representatives, the Tribunal has reached the following decision on the question of jurisdiction.\n\n**II. Factual Background**\n--------------------------\n\n20.\n\nThe Respondent is a federal republic consisting of the autonomous city of Buenos Aires and twenty-three provinces, one of which is the Province of Santa Fe, located in the north of the country. From 1980 until 1995, the Province of Santa Fe, through its *Direcci\u00f3n Provincial de Obras Sanitarios* (DIPOS), had the responsibility of providing water and waste water services to the principal urban areas in the Province.8\n\nClaimants\u2019 Memorial on the Merits of September 20, 2004. para. 9 and Exhibit C2\n\n21.\n\nIn 1989, Argentina enacted the State Reform Law9 that launched a broad program of privatization by which the Argentine government proposed to transfer to private and primarily foreign investors the assets, operations, and functions of various designated State-owned companies and entities. The State Reform Law also invited the country\u2019s provinces to participate in the privatization process. Subsequently, Argentina took certain other measures to encourage private and foreign investment. Less than two years after the State Reform Law, Argentina adopted the Convertibility Law10 by which it tied or \"pegged\" the value of the Argentine Peso to the United States Dollar and established a currency board requiring that the amount of Argentine currency in circulation be equivalent to the foreign currency reserves held by the State. Starting in 1990, it also began to conclude bilateral treaties \"for the reciprocal promotion and protection of investments\" with various countries. By the year 2000, it had concluded 57 such bilateral investment treaties, commonly known as BITs, including the July 1991 Argentine-France BIT and the October 1991 Argentina-Spain BIT.\n\nLaw No. 23,696 of 18 August 1989 (the State Reform Law).\n\nLaw No. 23,928 of March 27, 1991.\n\n22.\n\nBeginning in 1989, almost immediately after the federal government had launched its privatization program, the Province of Santa Fe took a series of measures to facilitate the privatization of certain provincial services and entities. Accordingly, Santa Fe adopted its own Emergency and State Reform Law11 which designated the specific services and entities to be privatized and defined the rules by which the privatization would be conducted. The general approach was to enact specific laws for each entity to be privatized. The Santa Fe Emergency and State Reform Law listed DIPOS as one of the provincial entities to be privatized, and in 1994 Law No. 11,220 was enacted to govern the privatization of the water distribution and waste water services in the Province of Santa Fe. This law provided for an international bidding procedure to enable private investors to obtain a thirty-year concession for the operation and development of specified water and waste water systems in the province. A model contract, annexed to the bidding rules, specified certain provisions governing the financial aspects of the proposed concession, including investment commitments, tariff adjustments, and the equilibrium to be maintained between the costs of operation and the financial returns to the eventual successful concessionaire. The Province, in cooperation with the federal authorities, actively publicized its desire to privatize these systems, preparing and distributing a prospectus aimed at private investors, both foreign and national.12\n\nLaw No. 10,472, as amended by Law No. 10,798 of January 22, 1990.\n\nThe \"Information Memorandum,\" Claimants\u2019 Exhibit C-28.\n\n23.\n\nIn response to these measures, Suez (then known as Lyonnaise des Eaux) and AGBAR, together with Argentine companies Banco de Galicia y Buenos Aires S. A., Sociedad Comercial del Plata S. A., and Meller S. A., formed a consortium in January 1995 to participate in the bidding for the concession to operate specified water distribution and waste water systems in the Province of Santa Fe. On August 30, 1995, this consortium was awarded the concession. Pursuant to the bidding rules, the consortium on November 8, 1995 formed an Argentine company, Aguas Provinciales de Santa Fe S.A, (APSF) to hold and operate the concession. On November 27, 1995, APSF formally concluded a thirty-year concession contract and on December 5, 1995 it assumed control and management of the water distribution and waste water systems in the fifteen most important urban areas in the Province of Santa Fe. According to the Claimants\u2019 Memorial on the Merits, by December 31, 2001 APSF had invested a total of US$257.7 million in the concession, consisting of US$60 million in APSF\u2019s initial capital, US$67.3 million of cash flows generated by APSF, and US$130.4 million primarily from the international financial market.13\n\nClaimants\u2019 Memorial, para. 161.\n\n24.\n\nIn 1999, the Argentine Republic began to experience a severe economic and financial crisis that had serious consequences for the country, its people, and its investors, both foreign and national. In response to this continuing crisis, the government adopted a variety of measures to deal with its effects in the following years. In 2002, it enacted a law14 that abolished the currency board that had linked the Argentine Peso to the U.S. dollar, resulting in a significant depreciation of the Argentine Peso. Claiming that these measures injured their investments in violation of the commitments made to them in securing the concession, the Claimants sought to obtain from the provincial government adjustments in the tariffs that APSF could charge for water distribution and waste water services, as well as modifications of other operating conditions.\n\nLaw No. 25,561 (Ley de Emergencia P\u00fablica y de Reforma del R\u00e9gimen Cambiado) of 6 January 2002.\n\n25.\n\nAfter a fruitless period of negotiations, the Claimants in April 2003 submitted their dispute with the Argentine Republic for settlement by arbitration to ICSID under the ICSID Convention pursuant to the Argentina-France and the Argentina-Spain BITs. In their Memorial, the Claimants allege that the Argentine Republic is legally responsible under the above-mentioned BITs for the Province of Santa Fe\u2019s wrongful actions, which expropriated Claimants\u2019 investment in violation of Article 5(2) of the Argentina-France BIT and Article V of the Argentina-Spain BIT and which failed to treat Claimants\u2019 investment fairly and equitably in breach of Article 3 and 5(1) of the Argentina-France BIT and Article IV(1) of the Argentina-Spain BIT. As a result, pursuant to both BITs, Claimants seek compensation for their alleged loss. The Claimants at the initiation of this proceeding consisted of APFS (now withdrawn), the concession company, and three of its non-Argentine shareholders: Suez, a French company holding 51.69% of APSF shares; AGBAR, a Spanish Company holding 10.89% of APSF shares, and InterAguas, a Spanish company holding 14.92% of APSF shares.15\n\nClaimant\u2019s Memorial, para. 41.\n\n26.\n\nIn response to the Claimants\u2019 Memorial, the Respondent submitted a Memorial with objections to jurisdiction on November 26, 2004, alleging six specific grounds as to why ICSID and the present Tribunal are without jurisdiction to hear and decide Claimants\u2019 claim for damages. The purpose of the present decision is to consider and decide upon each of the objections to jurisdiction raised by the Respondent. In undertaking this task, the Tribunal is mindful of the fact that other ICSID tribunals in other cases involving the Respondent have decided similar, if not identical jurisdictional issues. While these decisions are not binding upon the present Tribunal, they are nonetheless instructive.\n\n**III. Consideration of Jurisdictional Objections**\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n***First Jurisdictional Objection: The Dispute Does Not Arise Directly Out of an*** ***Investment***\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n27.\n\nArticle 25 (1) of the ICSID Convention provides:\n\n*\"The jurisdiction of the Centre shall extend to any legal dispute arising*  *directly*  *out of an investment, between a Contracting State (or any constituent subdivision or agency of a Contracting State designated to the Centre by that State) and a national of another Contracting State, which the parties to the dispute consent in writing to submit to the Centre \"* (emphasis supplied).\n\nThe Respondent challenges ICSID\u2019s and this Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction on the ground that the underlying dispute between the Claimants and the Respondent does not arise directly out of an investment, as the ICSID Convention requires. The Respondent argues that in reality this dispute is about the wisdom of general economic measures taken by the government of Argentina to deal with the economic and financial crisis it was facing. In that light, according to the Respondent, the dispute in this case does not arise directly out of an investment, but rather out of the general measures adopted by the government. Further, Respondent argues that the word \"directly\" could also be \"translated\" as meaning \"specifically\" and that since none of the measures complained of were directed specifically at the Claimants\u2019 investments, but rather were measures of general applicability, it cannot be said that the dispute in the present case arises \"directly\" out of the Claimants\u2019 investment.16 In support of its position, the Respondent cites certain language from the NAFTA/UNCITRAL case of *Methanex Corporation v. United States of America.17*\n\nRespondent\u2019s Memorial on Jurisdiction, para. 18.\n\nMethanex Corporation v. United States of America. 1st Partial Award, August 7, 2002, Respondent\u2019s Exhibit AL RA 3.\n\n28.\n\nThe Claimants assert that the Respondent errs when it states that they complain of general economic measures and that, in these circumstances, the dispute cannot arise directly out of investments as required by Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention. Indeed, the Claimants complain that Argentine measures specifically, concretely and directly violated commitments made to them as foreign investors in the privatized water industry, in particular Argentina\u2019s failure to reestablish the concession\u2019s financial equilibrium and to adjust tariffs. The Claimants further argue *that Methanex.* though not directly relevant to this case, actually supports their position in that the words \"relating to\" in Article 1101(1) of the NAFTA were interpreted to mean that \"there must be a legally significant connection between the measure and the claimant investor or its investment\". Moreover, this holding should be interpreted in conjunction with the rejection in *Pope & Talbot v. Canada,* another NAFTA case, of Canada\u2019s submission that\n\n\"a measure can only relate to an investment if it is primarily directed at that investment and that a measure aimed at trade in goods ipso facto cannot be addressed as well under *Chapter* 77.\"18\n\nClaimants\u2019 Counter Memorial on Jurisdiction, para. 51 with citation.\n\n29.\n\nThe Tribunal does not accept the Respondent\u2019s interpretation of Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention. Article 25(1) requires a connection of a sufficient degree of directness between a *dispute* submitted to ICSID and a claimant\u2019s *investment.19* The International Court of Justice has defined the word \"dispute\" to mean \"a disagreement on a point of law or fact, a conflict of legal views or interests between parties.\"20 That a disagreement exists between the Claimants and the Respondent about law, facts, and legal views is beyond doubt. It is also beyond doubt (which the Respondent does not contest) that the Claimants have made an investment in certain water distribution and waste water systems in the Province of Santa Fe. The disagreement between Claimants and the Respondent arises directly out of Claimants\u2019 investments in the water distribution and waste water systems in the Province of Santa Fe, since the disagreement is specifically about the legality under international law of the treatment accorded to those investments by the measures taken by the Respondent and its subdivisions. The Claimants allege that the treatment they have received violates Argentina\u2019s treaty obligations towards those investments, while the Respondent takes a different view. That disagreement arises directly out of the investment impacted by governmental measures, not out of the measures themselves. The Tribunal is not concerned with the wisdom, legality, or soundness of the policy measures taken by Argentina to deal with the economic crisis. Rather, the Tribunal\u2019s task is to judge, at the merits stage of this case, whether the effect of Respondent\u2019s actions on the Claimants\u2019 investments violates the Respondent\u2019s international legal obligations contained in the Argentina-France and the Argentina-Spain BITs. In short, the core of the dispute centers on a basic question: Did the Respondent by its actions violate the rights granted to the Claimants and their investment under international law?\n\nSee Christoph H. Schreuer, *The ICSID Convention: A Commentary* 114 (2001).\n\nSee *Case concerning East Timor,* 1995 ICJ Reports 89, 99.\n\n30.\n\nThe Respondent\u2019s proposed interpretation of the ICSID treaty that jurisdiction only exists if the measure in question was aimed or directed \"specifically\" at the investment finds no basis in the plain language of the treaty. First, the jurisdictional element demanded by the ICSID Convention is a dispute arising directly out of an investment. The Convention makes no reference to governmental measures as a jurisdictional element. To infer that requirement without justification in the face of the plain meaning of Article 25 of the Convention would do violence to the arbitral regime that was carefully put in place by its founders. Second, it would lead to results that were clearly not intended by the drafters of the Convention. For example, such an interpretation would exclude from ICSID jurisdiction disputes caused by a governmental act of general expropriation while a governmental act expropriating a specific investment would be within the jurisdiction of the Centre. The Respondent cites language from *Methanex v. United States of America* in support of its position. In the *Methanex* case, the tribunal was interpreting Article 1101(1) of the NAFTA whose fundamental jurisdictional requirement, unlike Article 25 of the ICSID Convention, applies the dispute settlement provisions of Chapter 11 to \" measures adopted or maintained by a Party relating to: (a) investors of another Party [or] investments of investors of another party in the territory of a Party\" (emphasis supplied). An interpretation of that provision requires quite a different analysis from that required by Article 25 of the ICSID Convention. Whereas NAFTA requires by its terms a connection between the investments and contested governmental measures, Article 25 of the ICSID Convention requires a direct connection between the investment and the dispute. As a result, the language from the *Methanex* case advanced by the Respondent is not relevant to an interpretation of Article 25.\n\n31.\n\nThe Tribunal finds support for its conclusion that the dispute in the present case is directly related to an investment in the ICSID case of *CMS v. Argentina21* which also addressed the question of whether the dispute in question arose directly out of an investment. In that case, the claimant, which had invested in the context of Argentina\u2019s privatization program in a gas distribution system, brought a claim in ICSID arbitration under the Argentina-U.S. bilateral investment treaty on the grounds that various economic measures taken by the government violated its rights under that BIT. In that case, as in the present dispute, Argentina challenged the jurisdiction of the Tribunal and ICSID on grounds, *inter alia,* that the dispute did not arise directly out of an investment and that the claimant was asking the tribunal to judge the validity of general economic measures. The tribunal in *CMS v. Argentina* rejected that objection to jurisdiction, stating that while it does \"not have jurisdiction over measures of general economic policy and could not pass judgment on whether they were right or wrong\", it did have jurisdiction \"...to examine whether specific measures affecting Claimant\u2019s investments or measures of general economic policy having a direct bearing on such investment have been adopted in violation of legally binding commitments given to the investor in treaties, legislation or contracts\"22. It further clarified its position by stating: \"[w]hat is brought under the jurisdiction of the Centre is not the general measures in themselves but the extent to which they may violate those specific commitments.\"23\n\nCMS Gas Transmission Co. v. The Republic of Argentina (ICSID Case No. ARB/01/8), Decision of the Tribunal on Objections to Jurisdiction (July 17, 2003), 42 ILM 788 (2003); also available online at www.worldbank.org/icsid; Claimants\u2019 Legal Authorities No. 85.\n\nIbid at para. 33.\n\nIbid at para. 27\n\n32.\n\nOn the basis of its foregoing analysis, the Tribunal holds that the dispute between the Claimants and the Respondent arises directly out of the Claimants\u2019 investment in the water distribution and waste water systems of the Province of Santa Fe and that therefore the Respondent\u2019s first objection to jurisdiction must fail.\n\n***Second Jurisdictional Objection: The Dispute is not a Legal Dispute***\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n33.\n\nArticle 25 not only requires as a jurisdictional element that a dispute arise directly out of an investment but it also requires that the dispute be a \"legal\" dispute. The Respondent objects to the jurisdiction of ICSID and of the Tribunal on the grounds that the dispute which the Claimants have submitted to arbitration is not \"legal\" in nature. It supports this position by pointing out that the Claimants\u2019 case is based upon Argentina\u2019s failure to adjust the tariff regime and to respect the equilibrium principle whereby Claimants would be assured a fair return on their investment, but that neither Argentine law nor the Respondent\u2019s contract with the Claimants imposes a legal obligation to do so. Consequently, the Respondent asserts that the dispute between the Claimants and the Respondent is a business or commercial dispute rather than a \"legal\" dispute required to establish ICSID jurisdiction. The Respondent further alleges that the dispute over the effects of the devaluation measures on the concession is one over policy and fairness (\"una cuesti\u00f3n de pol\u00edtica p\u00fablica y de equidad\", Memorial on Jurisdiction, para. 46), hence not legal in nature.\n\n34.\n\nA legal dispute, in the ordinary meaning of the term, is a disagreement about legal rights or obligations. In its Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, the Claimants assert that their claim is indeed based on legal rights - the legal rights granted to them under the Argentina-France and the Argentina-Spain BITs. They allege that, by failing to make tariff adjustments and to respect the equilibrium principle, the Respondent violated its legal obligations under the Argentina-France BIT to accord \"just and equitable treatment, in accordance with the principles of international law\" to the Claimants and their investments and \" not [to] take, directly or indirectly, any expropriation or nationalization measures or any other equivalent measures having a similar effect of dispossession\" without payment of prompt and adequate compensation (Art. 3, 5(1), and 5(2)). They further allege that the Respondent also violated its legal obligations under the Argentina-Spain BIT to guarantee \"fair and equitable treatment of investments made\" by the Claimants and to pay compensation for \"the nationalization, expropriation or any other measures having similar characteristics or effects\" taken by Respondent (Art. IV(1) and V).\n\n35.\n\nAt this stage of the proceedings, the task of the Tribunal is not to judge the merits of these claims but to determine whether the claims made by the Claimants are legal in nature and therefore constitute a basis for establishing ICSID jurisdiction. Furthermore, although the ICSID Convention itself does not define the meaning of \"legal\" dispute, the accompanying Report of the Executive Directors of the World Bank gives some clarification:\n\n*\"The expression \"legal dispute \" has been used to make clear that while conflicts of rights are within the jurisdiction of the Centre, mere conflicts of interests are not. The dispute must concern the existence or scope of a legal right or obligation, or the nature or extent of the reparation to be made for breach of a legal obligation. \"24*\n\nReport of the Executive Directors on the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States, 1 ICSID Reports 28; also available online at www.worldbank.org/icsid.\n\n36.\n\nIn his commentary on the ICSID Convention, Professor Schreuer characterizes legal disputes as follows:\n\n*\"The dispute will only qualify as legal if legal remedies such as restitution or damages are sought and if legal rights based on, for example, treaties or legislation are claimed. Consequently, it is largely in the hands of the claimant to present the dispute in legal terms. \"25*\n\nChristoph H. Schreuer, *The ICSID Convention: A Commentary* 105 (2001).\n\n37.\n\nIn the present case, the Claimants clearly base their case on legal rights which they allege have been granted to them under the bilateral investment treaties that Argentina has concluded with France and Spain. In their written pleadings and oral arguments, the Claimants have consistently presented their case in legal terms. Bilateral investment treaties are not mere statements of good will or declarations of benevolent intent toward the investors and investments of the two countries concerned. They are international legal instruments by which sovereign states make firm commitments under international law concerning the treatment they will accord to investors and investments from the other state. A basic purpose of the Argentina-France BIT and the Argentina-Spain BIT, as their titles indicate, is the \"protection of investments.\" They seek to achieve this goal by granting investors and investments from the treaty partner certain legal rights and to provide a legal means for their enforcement. In the present case, the Claimants have invoked both BITs as a basis for their claim and have based their claims on the specific legal rights enumerated in specific treaty provisions, which they allege have been granted to them by the treaties in question. Whether they will prevail in establishing their legal rights and the Respondent\u2019s violation thereof remains to be seen and is for a subsequent stage of this proceeding. What is certain at this stage, however, is that the dispute as presented by the Claimants is legal in nature. As a result, the Tribunal concludes that Respondent\u2019s second objection to jurisdiction must also fail.\n\n***Third Objection to Jurisdiction (now moot): APSF does not qualify as a foreign investor under the applicable treaty and, in any event, has not consented to the jurisdiction of ICSID and of the Tribunal***\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n38.\n\nAPSF, one of the original Claimants in this dispute, is an Argentine corporation which formally holds the concession for water distribution and waste water treatment in the Province of Santa Fe and through which the other Claimants made their investments. Since APSF is not a foreign entity, but a national entity, the Respondent asserted that APSF is not entitled to bring a case to ICSID.\n\n39.\n\nIn response, the Claimants argued that APSF must be deemed a French investor, as Suez, a French company, holds 51.69% of its shares, majority shareholding being evidence of control, the relevant test, under Article 25 of the ICSID Convention and Article (1)(2)(c) of the Argentina-France BIT.\n\n40.\n\nSince the Tribunal, at the request of APSF and without opposition from the Respondent, has ordered the discontinuance of the proceedings in this case with respect to APSF in Procedural Order No. 1, discussed above, and since this third objection to jurisdiction relates to and affects only APSF and none of the other claimants, the Tribunal has concluded that it need not consider and decide upon this objection to jurisdiction.\n\n***Fourth Jurisdictional Objection: Claimants\u2019 Right to Bring an Action in Arbitration is Precluded by the Dispute Resolution Clause in the Concession Contract Concluded by*** ***APSF***\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n41.\n\nThe contract granting APSF a concession to operate the water distribution and waste water systems in specified urban areas in the Santa Fe Province contained a dispute resolution clause whereby the parties to the contract agreed to submit all disputes relating to its interpretation and execution to the local courts of the Province of Santa Fe.26 From this fact, the Respondent draws two implications challenging ICSID and the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction. First, the dispute resolution clause, according to the Respondent, shows that APSF did not agree to ICSID jurisdiction, thus vitiating a fundamental element of ICSID jurisdiction: consent. Second, by agreeing to settle all disputes arising out of their transaction, including those that are the basis for the present arbitration, in the courts of Argentina, not before an ICSID tribunal, both the Claimants and the Respondent agreed to settle their disputes in a manner which necessarily excludes recourse to ICSID.\n\nContrato de Concesi\u00f3n, dated November 27, 1995, between the Province of Santa Fe and APSF. Art\u00edculo 15.4 (Jurisdicci\u00f3n): Sin petjuicio de lo establecido en el art\u00edculo 115 de la Ley 11,220, en caso de cualquier controversia relativa a la interpretaci\u00f3n y ejecuci\u00f3n del Contrato, las partes se someten a la jurisdicci\u00f3n local de la Provincia de Santa Fe, con renuncia expresa a cualquier otro fuero o jurisdicci\u00f3n que pudiera corresponder por cualquier causa.\n\n42.\n\nThe Claimants object that arbitral tribunals have consistently rejected arguments relating to the preclusive effect of contractual dispute resolution clauses providing for the jurisdiction of local courts where breaches of the BITs were alleged, and that they do not claim any contractual right or assert any cause of action under the concession contract. In support of their first objection, the Claimants rely in particular on decisions in other ICSID cases involving Argentina, namely *CMS v. Argentina, Enron v. Argentina, Azurix v. Argentina, Campania de Aguas del Aconquija S.A.* and *Compagnie G\u00e9n\u00e9rale des Eaux* v. *Argentina,* as well as on other decisions such as *Salini v. Morocco and CME Czech Republic B. V. v. The Czech Republic.* As regards their second argument, the Claimants specify that their claims are for breach of the treaty protection and not for breach of contract. In this respect, they gave particulars of the principles and provisions of the concession contract solely to explain the investment regime that Santa Fe established in order to attract foreign investments.\n\n43.\n\nIn order to assess the Respondent\u2019s jurisdictional objections on this point, one must consider the nature and implications of the dispute settlement clause concluded by APSF and the Province of Santa Fe. By its terms, the dispute resolution clause covers all controversies arising out of the concession contract. The dispute resolution clause makes no mention of Claimants\u2019 rights under the Argentina-France BIT, the Argentina-Spain BIT, or their right to seek recourse in arbitration for violation of those rights. In the present case, the Claimants, as they rightly point out, do not allege any violation of their rights under the concession contract. Rather, the basis of their claim is that the Respondent has violated the Claimants\u2019 rights under the BITs. BIT claims and contractual claims are two different things. As the ICSID Annulment Committee stated in *Vivendi,* which involved one of the BITs at the center of the present dispute:\n\n*\"A state may breach a treaty without breaching a contract, and vice versa [...]\";*\n\n*\"[...] whether there has been a breach of the BIT and whether there has been a breach of contract are different questions. Each of these claims will be determined by reference to its own proper or applicable law - in the case of the BIT, by international law; in the case of the Concession Contract by the proper law of the contract27*\n\nCompa\u00f1\u00eda de Aguas del Aconquija SA and Vivendi Universal (formerly Compagnie G\u00e9n\u00e9rale des Eaux) v. Argentine Republic (ICSID Case No. ARB/97/3), Decision on Annulment (July 3, 2002) paras. 95 and 96. Available online at www.worldbank.org/icsid.\n\n44.\n\nMany other international arbitral tribunals have taken the position that a dispute resolution clause in an underlying contract whereby contractual disputes are within the exclusive jurisdiction of local courts or arbitrations does not preclude an investor who is a party to such contract from bringing an arbitration proceeding to enforce its rights under a bilateral investment treaty.28\n\nE.g., Lanco International Inc. v. The Argentine Republic, (ICSID Case No. ARB/97/6), Preliminary Decision on Jurisdiction, at sections 39-40; Salini Costruttori SpA and Italstrade v. Kingdom of Morocco, ICSID Case No. ARB/00/4, Decision on Jurisdiction, (July 23, 2001) at para. 62; Azurix Corp, v. Argentine Republic (ICSID Case No. ARB/01/12), Decision on Jurisdiction (December 8, 2003), at para. 76.\n\n45.\n\nIt follows from the above discussion that, contrary to Argentina\u2019s argument, the execution of a dispute resolution clause in the concession agreement does not mean that the parties have waived ICSID jurisdiction. Certainly, the execution of a dispute settlement clause, like the one in the Santa Fe concession contract, which makes no reference to the BIT or to the treatment that the BIT guarantees investors, cannot support any inference that such dispute resolution clause is a waiver of the investors\u2019 rights under a BIT. The Tribunal concludes that the existence of the dispute resolution clause in the concession contract does not preclude the Claimants from bringing the present action. Consequently, Respondent\u2019s fourth objection to the ICSID\u2019s and this Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction must fail.\n\n***Fifth Jurisdictional Objection: Suez, AGBAR, and InterAguas, as mere shareholders of APSF are not legally qualified to bring claims in ICSID arbitration for alleged injuries done to APSF***\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n46.\n\nThe Respondent contends that the three shareholders in APSF, Suez, AGBAR, and InterAguas, have no standing to bring a claim in arbitration for alleged injuries done to APSF. In support of this position, the Respondent, drawing analogies to domestic corporation law, argues that any injury to the shareholders is derivative of the alleged injury to the company in which they hold shares, as opposed to a direct injury to the shareholders themselves. The alleged injury is done to the corporation, not to the shareholders whose shares, because of an alleged wrongful action done to the corporation, may have diminished in value. Thus, the shareholders have no right to bring an action on grounds that they have sustained a direct injury by virtue of the alleged wrongful actions of the Respondent. The right to bring an action for any alleged injury lies with the corporation itself, not its shareholders. The Respondent further pointed out that to award a monetary recovery to the Claimants in their capacity as shareholders, as well as to APSF as the entity directly wronged, would result in an unjust double recovery and moreover would grant a recovery to specific shareholders, thus prejudicing other APSF shareholders as well as its creditors. The Respondent also reiterated this argument at the time that the Tribunal, at the request of APSF to withdraw from this case and without objection from the Respondent, ordered the discontinuance of the proceedings with respect to APSF. In its submissions of 31 March 2006, the Respondent argued that the Shareholder Claimants\u2019 claims were dependent or derivative of APSF\u2019s claim and that since APSF was no longer a party, the Claimant Shareholders had no right to bring a claim in ICSID arbitration in the absence of APSF.\n\n47.\n\nIn response, the Claimants argue that the basis for a shareholder having standing to bring a case because of an alleged injury is to be found in international law, not domestic law. Specifically, it is to be found in the Argentina-France and Argentina-Spain BITs which were concluded by the countries concerned to protect the investors and investments of one State in the territory of another State. Suez is a French national under the Argentina-France BIT and as such falls within the definition of the term \"investor\" in Article l(2)(b). Under Article 8 of the Argentina-France BIT, an \"investor\" may have recourse to ICSID arbitration with respect to \"... any disputes relating to an investment under this Treaty.\" Article 1(1) contains a quite detailed definition of investment. It provides in part:\n\n*1. The term \"investment\" shall apply to assets such as property, rights and interests in any category, and particularly but not exclusively to:...*\n\n*b) Shares, issue premiums and other forms of participation, albeit minority or indirect, in companies constituted in the territory of either Contracting Party... \"29*\n\nUnited Nations Treaty Series, volume 1728, p. 298. The official Spanish text of the above-quoted provisions is as follows:  \n 1. El t\u00e9rmino \"inversiones\" designa los activos tales como los bienes, derechos e intereses de cualquier naturaleza y, en particular, aunque no exclusivamente:  \n b) las acciones, primas de emisi\u00f3n y otras formas de participaci\u00f3n a\u00fan minoritarias o indirectas, en las sociedades constituidas en el territorio de una de las Partes Contratantes.  \n The official French text of the quoted provision is as follows:  \n 1. Le terme \u00abinvestissement\u00bb d\u00e9signe des avoirs tels que les biens, droits, et int\u00e9r\u00eats de toute nature, et plus particuli\u00e8rement mais non exclusivement:  \n b) Les actions, primes d\u2019\u00e9mission et autres, formes de participation, m\u00eame minoritaires ou indirectes aux soci\u00e9t\u00e9s constitu\u00e9es sur le territoire de l\u2019une des Parties contractantes;\n\n48.\n\nThe Claimants likewise refer to Article I(2) of the Argentina-Spain BIT which defines investments as \"any kind of assets, such as property and rights of every kind [...]\", including \"shares and other forms of participations in companies.\"30\n\nIbid.\n\n49.\n\nAccordingly, under the plain language of these BITs, the Tribunal finds that Suez\u2019s as well as AGBAR\u2019s and InterAguas\u2019 shares in APSF are \"investments\" under the Argentina-France and Argentina-Spain BITs. These shareholders thus benefit from the treatment promised by Argentina to investments made by French and Spanish nationals in its territory. Consequently, under Article 8 of the French treaty and Article X of the Spanish treaty, these shareholder Claimants are entitled to have recourse to ICSID arbitration to enforce their treaty rights. Neither the Argentina-France BIT, the Argentina-Spain BIT, nor the ICSID Convention limit the rights of shareholders to bring actions for direct, as opposed to derivative claims. This distinction, present in domestic corporate law of many countries, does not exist in any of the treaties applicable to this case.\n\n50.\n\nDuring the oral arguments, the Respondent relied heavily on the International Court of Justice case *Barcelona Traction31* in which Belgium sought damages against Spain for injuries done to Belgian shareholders in a Canadian corporation that was operating an electricity distribution system in Barcelona. The Court held that Belgium lacked *jus standi* to exercise diplomatic protection of shareholders in a Canadian company with respect to measures taken against that company in Spain. In this Tribunal\u2019s opinion, *Barcelona Traction* is not controlling in the present case. That decision, which has been criticized by scholars over the years, concerned diplomatic protection of its nationals by a State, an issue that is in no way relevant to the current case. Unlike the present case, *Barcelona Traction* did not involve a bilateral treaty which specifically provides that shareholders are investors and as such are entitled to have recourse to international arbitration to protect their shares from host country actions that violate the treaty. In this regard, it is interesting to note the Id\u2019s commentary on the underdeveloped state of international investment law in 1970, the year of the Barcelona Traction decision:\n\n*\"Considering the important developments of the last half-century, the growth of foreign investments and the expansion of international activities of corporations, in particular of holding companies, which are often multinational, and considering the way in which the economic interests of states have proliferated, it may at first sight appear surprising that the evolution of the law has not gone further and that no generally accepted rules in the matter have crystallized on the international plane. \"32*\n\nAt that time, the movement to conclude bilateral investment treaties was in its infancy. Today, over 2200 bilateral investment treaties exist in the world, and Argentina alone has concluded fifty seven. Moreover, there exists today a growing jurisprudence of arbitral decisions interpreting treaty provisions, something which hardly existed in 1970. The applicable international law on investment between Argentina and France and Argentina and Spain found in the relevant BITs is much more specific and far reaching than was the case in 1970.\n\nCase Concerning the Barcelona Traction, Light and Power Company (Belgium v. Spain), Judgment of February 5, 1970, 1970 I.C.J. 3.\n\nBarcelona Traction Company (Belgium v. Spain), 1970 I.C.J. 3, 46-47 (1970).\n\n51.\n\nRelying on the specific language of the Argentina-France BIT, as well as that of the Argentina-Spain BIT which also gives shareholders standing to have recourse to arbitration to protect their shares, the Tribunal finds that Suez, AGBAR, and InterAguas have standing to bring this arbitration. Many other decisions in ICSID cases, including a good number involving Argentina, have made similar holdings.33 While the Respondent\u2019s concern about the danger of double recovery to the corporation and to the shareholders for the same injury is to be noted, the Tribunal\u2019s decision at this point relates only to jurisdiction. Moreover, the Tribunal believed that any eventual award in this case could be fashioned in such a way as to prevent double recovery. In any event, the withdrawal of APSF from the case vitiates any concerns about a possible double recovery to the shareholders and the corporation for the same injury. Finally, the Tribunal believes that the discontinuance of these proceedings with respect to APSF does not affect the rights of the Shareholder Claimants to bring a claim in ICSID arbitration under the two BITs in question. The Claimant Shareholders would have had a right to bring such claims independently without the participation of APSF in first instance. The initial participation of APSF and its subsequent withdrawal do not alter the Claimant Shareholders\u2019 rights. According to Art. l(l)(b) of the Argentina-France BIT and 1(2) of the Argentina-Spain BIT (quoted above, para. 47.48), shares fall within the definition of investments protected by the BITs. APSF\u2019s withdrawal cannot erase the legal effects of the shareholders\u2019 investment nor affect their *ius standi* under the BITs. As a consequence, the Tribunal concludes that the Respondent\u2019s fifth objection to jurisdiction fails.\n\nE.g., CMS Gas Transmission Company v. The Republic of Argentina (ICSID Case No. ARB/01/8). Decision of the Tribunal on Objections to Jurisdiction (July 17, 2003); Enron Corporation & Ponderosa Assets, LP v. Argentine Republic (ICSID Case No. ARB/01/3), Decision on Jurisdiction (January 14, 2003); Siemens A.G. v. The Argentine Republic (ICSID No ARB/02/8), Decision on Jurisdiction (August 3, 2004).\n\n***Sixth Jurisdictional Objection: Since Claimants InterAguas and AGBAR have not complied with the provisions of the Argentina-Spain BIT requiring submission of an investment dispute to local courts before invoking international arbitration, they have no standing to have recourse to ICSID arbitration at this time***\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n52.\n\nClaimants InterAguas and AGBAR, both nationals of Spain, seek to assert their claims under the Argentina-Spain BIT. Unlike Article 8(2) of the Argentina-France BIT, which allows an investor to have recourse to international arbitration after a period of six months of negotiation from the time it asserts its claim, Article X of the Argentina-Spain BIT requires the investor, at the end of the same six month period, to bring a judicial proceeding in the local courts and allows it to have recourse to arbitration only after a further period of eighteen months in the local courts. InterAguas and AGBAR have not pursued their claims by litigation in Argentina\u2019s courts. As a result, the Respondent argues that these two Claimants have no standing at the present time to pursue this case before an ICSID tribunal. In response, the Claimants argue that by virtue of the most-favored-nation clause in the Argentina-Spain BIT they may take advantage of the more favorable treatment provided in the Argentina-France BIT with respect to dispute resolution and that therefore they may bring their action to ICSID without first pursuing their claims in the local courts of Argentina. The Respondent opposes this interpretation of the Argentina-Spain BIT, arguing that the most-favored-nation clause does not include matters relating to investment dispute settlement.\n\n53.\n\nA decision on this objection requires the Tribunal, as with Respondent\u2019s other objections, to begin with an interpretation and analysis of the relevant BIT provisions. Article IV of the Argentina-Spain BIT, entitled *\"Tratamiento\"* (Treatment) is relied upon by the Claimants InterAguas and AGBAR as obviating the need to have recourse to Argentine courts before bringing an international arbitration. The first three paragraphs of Article IV provide as follows:\n\n*1. Cada Parte garantizar\u00e1 en su territorio un tratamiento justo y equitativo a las inversiones por inversores de la otra Parte.*\n\n*2. En todas las materias regidas por el presente Acuerdo, este tratamiento no ser\u00e1 menos favorable que el otorgado por cada Parte a las inversiones realizadas en su territorio por inversores de un tercer pa\u00eds.*\n\n*3. Este tratamiento no se extender\u00e1, sin embargo, a los privdegios que una Parte conceda a los inversores de un tercer Estado en virtud de su participaci\u00f3n en:*\n\n*\\* Una zona de libre cambio*\n\n*\\* Una uni\u00f3n aduanera*\n\n*\\* Un mercado com\u00fan*\n\n*\\* Un acuerdo de integraci\u00f3n regional, o*\n\n*\\* Una organizaci\u00f3n de asistencia econ\u00f3mica mutual en virtud de un acuerdo firmado antes de la entrada en vigor del presente Acuerdo que prevea disposiciones an\u00e1logas a aquellas que son otorgadas por esa Parte a los participantes de dicha organizaci\u00f3n. \"*\n\nThe English translation of this provision in the United Nations Treaty Series is as follows:\n\n*1. Each Party shall guarantee in its territory fair and equitable treatment of investments made by investors of the other Party.*\n\n*2. In all matters governed by this Agreement, such treatment shall be no less favorable than that accorded by each Party to investment made in its territory by investors of a third country.*\n\n*3. Such treatment shall not, however, extend to the privileges which either Party may grant to investors of a third State by virtue of its participation in:*\n\n*A free trade area;*\n\n*A customs union:*\n\n*A common market;*\n\n*A regional integration agreement; or*\n\n*An organization of mutual economic assistance by virtue of an agreement concluded prior to the entry into force of this Agreement, containing terms similar to those accorded by that Party to participants of said organization. \"*\n\n54.\n\nIn interpreting these provisions, the Tribunal is guided by established principles of treaty interpretation as provided by Article 31 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, pursuant to which treaty language is to be interpreted in accordance with its \"ordinary meaning.\" In that respect, the text of the treaty is presumed to be the authentic expression of the parties\u2019 intentions. The starting place for any exercise in interpretation is therefore the treaty text itself.\n\n55.\n\nThe text quoted above clearly states that \"in all matters\" *(en todas las materias)* a Contracting party is to give a treatment no less favorable than that which it grants to investments made in its territory by investors from any third country. Article X of the Argentina-Spain BIT specifies in detail the processes for the \"Settlement of Disputes between a Party and Investors of the other Party.\" Consequently, dispute settlement is certainly a \"matter\" governed by the Argentina-Spain BIT. The word \"treatment\" is not defined in the treaty text. However, the ordinary meaning of that term within the context of investment includes the rights and privileges granted and the obligations and burdens imposed by a Contracting State on investments made by investors covered by the treaty. In the present situation, Argentina concluded a BIT with France which permits aggrieved investors, after six months\u2019 of attempting to resolve their disputes to have recourse to international arbitration without the necessity of first bringing a case in the local courts of a contracting State. Consequently, French investors in Argentina, as a result of the Argentina-France BIT, receive a more favorable treatment than do Spanish investors in Argentina under the Argentina-Spain BIT. That being the case, by virtue of Article IV, para. 2, Spanish investors are entitled to a treatment with respect to dispute settlement no less favorable than the one accorded to French investors. In specific terms, granting a treatment to Spanish investors that is no less favorable than that granted to French investors would mean that Spanish investors would be able to invoke international arbitration against Argentina on the same terms as French investors. That is to say, Spanish investors, like French investors, may have recourse to international arbitration, provided they comply with the six months negotiation period but without the need to proceed before the local courts of Argentina for a period of eighteen months.\n\n56.\n\nArgentina contests this interpretation on various grounds. First it argues that the Contracting States did not intend the most-favored-nation clause in Article IV of the Argentina-Spain BIT to cover dispute settlement. The Tribunal finds no evidence in the text or elsewhere to support that conclusion. The text of the Argentina-Spain BIT strongly implies just the opposite. Paragraph 3 of Article IV contains a definite list of \"matters\" that the Contracting States specifically *excluded* from the most-favored-nation clause in paragraph 2. Dispute settlement is not among them. The failure to refer among these excluded items to any matter remotely connected to dispute settlement reinforces the interpretation that the term \"all matters\" in paragraph 2 includes dispute settlement matters. In negotiating the Argentina-Spain BIT, the Contracting States considered and decided that certain matters should be excluded. The fact that dispute settlement was not covered among the excluded matters must be interpreted to mean that dispute settlement is included within the term \"all matters\" in paragraph 2.\n\n57.\n\nMoreover, after an analysis of the substantive provisions of the BITs in question, the Tribunal finds no basis for distinguishing dispute settlement matters from any other matters covered by a bilateral investment treaty. From the point of view of the promotion and protection of investments, the stated purposes of the Argentina-Spain BIT, dispute settlement is as important as other matters governed by the BIT and is an integral part of the investment protection regime that two sovereign states, Argentina and Spain, have agreed upon. In this context, the Respondent further argues that this Tribunal should apply the principle of *ejusdem generis* in interpreting the Argentina-Spain BIT so as to exclude dispute settlement matters from the scope of the most-favored-nation clause, because the category \"dispute settlement\" is not of the same *genus* as the matters addressed in the clause. The Tribunal finds no basis for applying the *ejusdem generis* principle to arrive at that result.\n\n58.\n\nSimilarly, Argentina contends that the Tribunal should interpret the most-favored-nation clause strictly because such an approach would restrict the principle of *res inter alios acta,* so as to limit the effects of the treaty to the parties. The Tribunal cannot follow this argument. The BIT in question contains mutual promises by Argentina and Spain to treat each others\u2019 nationals in the same way that they treat nationals from any third State. The principle of *res inter alios acta* has no application, because the Tribunal is not applying the Argentina-France BIT (presumably the alleged act between third parties) to this case. Rather it is applying the Argentina-Spain BIT\u2019s provisions on equality of treatment.\n\n59.\n\nFurther, the Respondent seems to argue that the Tribunal should interpret a most-favored-nation provision strictly. Here too, the Tribunal finds no rule and no reason for interpreting the most-favored-nation treatment clause any differently from any other clause in the Argentina-Spain BIT. The language of the treaty is clear. Applying the normal interpretational methodology to Article IV of the Argentina-Spain BIT, the Tribunal finds that the ordinary meaning of that provision is that matters relating to dispute settlement are included within the term \"all matters\" and that therefore InterAguas and AGBAR may take advantage of the more favorable treatment provided to investors in the Argentina- France BIT with respect to dispute settlement.\n\n60.\n\nThe Tribunal finds strong support for this conclusion in previous ICSID cases. In particular, *Maffezini v. Spain*34 applied the Argentina-Spain BIT, the very treaty at issue in the present case, to find that the most favored-nation-clause allowed the Claimant, a national of Argentina, to take advantage of Spain\u2019s BIT with Chile to avoid the necessity of having recourse to the local courts in Spain before bringing an ICSID action. The most relevant passages of Maffezini are worth quoting in full because they well show the rationale behind the application of the most-favored nation clause to dispute settlement:\n\n\"The Tribunal considers that there are good reasons to conclude that today dispute settlement arrangements are inextricably related to the protection of foreign investors, as they are also related to the protection of rights of traders under treaties of commerce. Consular jurisdiction in the past, like other forms of extraterritorial jurisdiction, were considered essential for the protection of rights of trader and, hence, were regarded not merely as procedural devices but as arrangements designed to better protect the rights of such person abroad. It follows that such arrangements, even if not strictly a part of the material aspect of the trade and investment policy pursued by treaties of commerce and navigation, were essential for the adequate protection of the rights they sought to guarantee.\n\nInternational arbitration and other dispute settlement arrangements have replaced these older and frequently abusive practices of the past. These modern developments are essential, however, to the protection of the rights envisaged under the pertinent treaties; they are also closely linked to the material aspects of the treatment accorded. \"35\n\nThese considerations then lead the *Maffezini* tribunal to conclude with the following words:\n\n\"[I]f a third-party treaty contains provisions for the settlement of disputes that are more favorable to the protection of the investor's rights and interests than those in the basic treaty, such provisions may be extended to the beneficiary of the most favored nation clause as they are fully compatible with the ejusdem generis principle.\"36\n\nEmilio Agust\u00edn Maffezini v. The Kingdom of Spain (ICSID Case No. ARB/97/7), Decision of the Tribunal on Objections to Jurisdiction (January 25, 2000); available online at www.worldbank.org/icsid.\n\nIbid., para. 54-55.\n\nIbid. para. 56.\n\n61.\n\nOther cases that have considered and rejected arguments similar to the ones raised by Argentina in the present case and which found that the most-favored-nation-clause allows a claimant to take advantage of more favorable dispute resolution provisions found in other treaties are in particular *Siemens A.G. v. The Argentine Republic37* and *MTD Equity Sdn. Bhd and MTD Chile SA v. Republic of Chile.38*\n\nICSID Case No. ARB/02/8, Decision on Jurisdiction, August 3, 2004, in particular para. 102: \"Access to these [dispute settlement] mechanisms is part of the protection offered under the Treaty.

ARB/01/7, Award of May 25, 2004.\n\n62.\n\nIn opposition to this line of cases, the Respondent referred during oral argument to *Plama Consortium Limited v. the Republic of Bulgaria39* In that case, the Claimant, a Cypriot company, sought to establish ICSID jurisdiction on the basis of the Energy Charter Treaty and of a BIT between Cyprus and Bulgaria. The tribunal affirmed ICSID jurisdiction under the Energy Charter Treaty; for various reasons, it also considered whether it had jurisdiction under the Bulgaria-Cyprus BIT. Such BIT contained a very limited international dispute settlement offer. In essence, it provided that only the measure of compensation for expropriation could be submitted to an UNCITRAL arbitration. It contained no offer for ICSID arbitration. It did, however, embody an MFN clause. Since other BITs concluded by Bulgaria provide for ICSID arbitration, the Claimant relied upon such MFN clause to take advantage of the ICSID dispute settlement mechanism included in the other BITs. The tribunal did not follow the Claimant and ruled that it lacked jurisdiction under the Bulgaria-Cyprus BIT.\n\nPlama Consortium Limited (Claimant) and Republic of Bulgaria (ICSID Case No. ARB/03/24), Decision on Jurisdiction (February 8, 2005), available online at www.worldbank.org/icsid\n\n63.\n\nHaving duly considered the reasons set forth in the **Plama** decision, this Tribunal comes to the conclusion that, whatever its merits, it is in any event clearly distinguishable from the present case on a number of grounds. First, at a basic level, it must be noted that the most-favored-nation-clause in the Argentina-Spain BIT is much broader in scope than was the language of the Bulgaria-Cyprus BIT in *Plama.* Whereas the Argentina-Spain BIT states that *\"In all matters governed by this Agreement,*...treatment shall be no less favorable than that accorded by each Party to investment made in its territory by investors of a third country\" (emphasis supplied), the comparable clause in the Bulgaria-Cyprus BIT stated \"Each Contracting Party shall apply to the investments in its territory by investors of the other Contracting Party a treatment which is not less favorable than that accorded to investments by investors of third states.\" As noted above, the use of the expression \"in all matters\" when coupled with a list of specific exceptions that does not include dispute resolution, leaves no doubt that dispute resolution is covered by the MFN clause. Second, and perhaps more important, the **Plama** tribunal was guided by the actual intent of the contracting States. Indeed, subsequent negotiations between Bulgaria and Cyprus showed the \"two Contracting Parties to the BIT themselves did not consider that the MFN provision extends to the dispute settlement provisions in other BITs\"40. This was in line with the fact that, at the time of conclusion of the BIT, *\"Bulgaria was under a communist regime, which favored bilateral investment treaties with limited protection for foreign investors and very limited international dispute resolution provisions* \"41. No evidence of any comparable intent has been suggested in this case. Third, as a further distinguishing factor, one may refer to the effect of the MFN provision. In *Plama,* the Claimant attempted to replace the dispute settlement provisions in the applicable Bulgaria-Cyprus BIT *in toto* by a dispute resolution mechanism \"incorporated\" from another treaty.42 Without expressing an opinion on whether an MFN clause may achieve such a result, this Tribunal distinguishes that radical effect from the much more limited one caused here, which merely consists in waiving a preliminary step in accessing a mechanism, i.e., ICSID arbitration, offered in both the Spanish and the French treaties.\n\nIbid., para. 195.\n\nIbid., paras. 196.\n\nIbid., para. 210.\n\n64.\n\nThe *Plama* tribunal also stated, in its reasons, that an arbitration agreement must be clear and unambiguous, especially where it is incorporated by reference to another text.43 This Tribunal does not share this statement. As stated above, it believes that dispute resolution provisions are subject to interpretation like any other provisions of a treaty, neither more restrictive nor more liberal.\n\nIbid., paras. 198ff.\n\n65.\n\nBe this as it may, at the end of its reasoning, the **Plama** tribunal suggested what could be called a \"non-sense exception to the non application of the MFN clause.\" Addressing the very requirement at issue here, i.e., that the dispute be tried in local courts during eighteen months, which it called \"a curious requirement,\" the **Plama** tribunal said that it \"sympathize[d] with a tribunal that attempts to neutralize such a provision that is nonsensical from a practical point of view\".44 It therefore concluded that \"[t]he decision in Maffezini is perhaps understandable.\"45\n\nIbid., para. 224.\n\nIbid., para. 224.\n\n66.\n\nFor all these reasons, the Tribunal concludes that Claimants InterAguas and AGBAR, relying on Article IV of the Argentina-Spain BIT, may invoke the more favorable treatment afforded in the Argentina-France BIT and may therefore bring an ICSID arbitration without the necessity of first having recourse to the local courts of Argentina. The Respondent\u2019s sixth objection to jurisdiction therefore fails.\n\n**IV. Decision on Jurisdiction**\n--------------------------------\n\n67.\n\nAfter having considered each and every jurisdictional objection raised by the Respondent, the Tribunal finds that it must reject them all, except for the fourth objection based on the status of APSF as an Argentine corporation, which objection has now become moot because of the discontinuance of the proceedings in the case with respect to APSF. The Tribunal thus decides that ICSID and this Tribunal have jurisdiction over this case, and it therefore directs that the case proceed on the merits in accordance with the ICSID Convention, the ICSID Rules, and the applicable bilateral investment treaties. The Tribunal has, accordingly, made the necessary Order for the continuation of the procedure pursuant to Arbitration Rule 41(4)."}, {"Title": "Decision on the Proposal for the Disqualification of Gabrielle Kaufmann-Kohler", "Type": "Arbitrator & Judge Challenge", "Date": "2007-10-22T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Decision on the Proposal for the Disqualification of Gabrielle Kaufmann-Kohler\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**I. Background**\n-----------------\n\n1.\n\nOn 17 April 2003, the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (\"ICSID\" or \"the Centre\") received a Request for Arbitration (\"the Request\" or \"the first Request\") against the Argentine Republic (\"the Respondent\" or \"Argentina\") from Aguas Argentinas S.A.(\"AASA\"), Suez, Sociedad General de Aguas de Barcelona S.A. (\"AGBAR\"), Vivendi Universal S.A. (\"Vivendi\") and AWG Group Ltd (\"AWG\"), (together, \"the Claimants\"). AASA was a company incorporated in Argentina. Suez, and Vivendi, both incorporated in France, AGBAR, incorporated in Spain, and AWG, incorporated in the United Kingdom, were shareholders in AASA. The Request concerned the Claimants' investments in a concession for water distribution and waste water treatment services in the city of Buenos Aires and some surrounding municipalities and a series of alleged acts and omissions by Argentina, including Argentina's alleged failure or refusal to apply previously agreed adjustments to the tariff calculation and adjustment mechanisms.1\n\nOn the same date, the Centre received a further request for arbitration under the ICSID Convention regarding water concessions in Argentina from Aguas Cordobesas S.A., Suez, and Sociedad General de Aguas de Barcelona, S.A. As explained below, this request would later be registered by the Centre and submitted by agreement of the parties to one same Tribunal, but that proceeding would eventually be discontinued following an agreement between the parties.\n\n2.\n\nAlso on April 17, 2003, the Centre received a second Request for Arbitration (\"the Request\" or \"the second Request\") against the Argentine Republic from Aguas Provinciales de Santa Fe S.A. (\"APSF\"), Suez, Sociedad General de Aguas de Barcelona S.A. (\"AGBAR\") and InterAguas Servicios Integrales del Agua S.A. (\"InterAguas\" together, \"the Claimants\"). APSF was a company incorporated in Argentina. Suez, incorporated in France, and AGBAR and InterAguas, both incorporated in Spain, were major shareholders in APSF. This second Request concerned the Claimants' investments in a concession for water distribution and waste water treatment in the Argentine Province of Santa Fe and a series of alleged acts and omissions by Argentina, including Argentina's alleged failure or refusal to apply previously agreed adjustments to the tariff calculation and adjustment mechanisms.\n\n3.\n\nIn the first Request, Claimants Suez and Vivendi, invoked Argentina's consent to dispute settlement through ICSID arbitration provided in the 1991 Bilateral Investment Treaty between France and the Argentine Republic (the \"Argentina-France BIT\")2 and AGBAR relied on Argentina's consent in the 1991 Bilateral Investment Treaty between the Argentine Republic and the Kingdom of Spain (the \"Argentina-Spain BIT\")3. Claimant AWG invoked Argentina's consent to arbitrate investment disputes under the 1990 Bilateral Investment Treaty between the Argentine Republic and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland (the \"Argentina-UK BIT\")4, which provides in Article 8(3) that in the event an investment dispute is subject to international arbitration Argentina and the investor concerned may agree to refer their dispute either to ICSID arbitration or to arbitration under the Arbitration Rules of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (\"UNCITRAL Rules\") and that failing such agreement after a period of three months the parties are bound to submit their dispute to UNCITRAL Rules arbitration. Although the required three months had elapsed without agreement, AWG in its Request for Arbitration invited Argentina to agree to extend ICSID arbitration to AGW's claims under the Argentina-UK BIT.\n\nAccord entre le Gouvernement de la R\u00e9publique Francaise et le Gouvernement de la R\u00e9publique Argentine sur l'encouragement et la protection r\u00e9ciproques des investissements (Agreement between the Gevernment of the Republic of France and the Government of the Republic of Argentina for the Promotion and Reciprocal Protection of Investments), signed on 3 July 1991 and in force since 3 March 1993; 1728 UNTS 298.\n\nAcuerdo para la promoci\u00f3n y protecci\u00f3n rec\u00edprocas de inversiones entre el Reino de Espa\u00f1a y la Rep\u00fablica Argentina (Agreement on the Promotion and Reciprocal Protection of Investments between the Kingdom of Spain and the Argentine Republic), signed in Buenos Aires on 3 October 1991 and in force since 28 September 1992; 1699 UNTS 202.\n\nAgreement between the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the Government of the Republic of Argentina for the Promotion and Protection of Investments, signed 11 December 1990, and in force since 19 February 1993; Treaty Series No. 41 (1993).\n\n4.\n\nIn the second Request, the Claimants invoked Argentina's consent to dispute settlement through ICSID arbitration provided in the 1991 Bilateral Investment Treaty between France and the Argentine Republic (the \"Argentina-France BIT\")5 and in the 1991 Bilateral Investment Treaty between the Argentine Republic and the Kingdom of Spain (the \"Argentina-Spain BIT\").6\n\nAccord entre le Gouvernement de la R\u00e9publique francaise et le Gouvernement de la R\u00e9publique Argentine sur l'encouragement et la protection r\u00e9ciproques des investissements (Agreement between the Argentine Republic and the Republic of France for the Promotion and Reciprocal Protection of Investments), signed on 3 July 1991 and in force since 3 March 1993; 1728 UNTS 298.\n\nAcuerdo para la promoci\u00f3n y protecci\u00f3n rec\u00edprocas de inversiones entre el Reino de Espa\u00f1a y la Rep\u00fablica Argentina (Agreement on the Promotion and Reciprocal Protection of Investments between the Kingdom of Spain and the Argentine Republic), signed in Buenos Aires on 3 October 1991 and in force since 28 September 1992; 1699 UNTS 202.\n\n5.\n\nOn April 17, 2003, the Centre, in accordance with Rule 5 of the ICSID Rules of Procedure for the Institution of Conciliation and Arbitration Proceedings (Institution Rules), acknowledged receipt and transmitted a copy of both Requests to the Argentine Republic and to the Argentine Embassy in Washington D.C.\n\n6.\n\nOn July 17, 2003, the Acting Secretary-General of the Centre registered both Requests, pursuant to Article 36(3) of the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of other States (the \"ICSID Convention\" or \"the Convention\"). The case relating to the first Request was registered as ICSID Case No. ARB/03/19 with the formal heading of Aguas Argentinas, Suez, Sociedad General de Aguas de Barcelona S.A. and Vivendi Universal S.A. v. Argentine Republic. On that same date, the Acting Secretary-General, in accordance with Institution Rule 7, notified the parties of the registration of the Request and invited them to proceed, as soon as possible, to constitute an Arbitral Tribunal. Argentina did not agree to extend ICSID jurisdiction to the claims of AWG but it did agree to allow the case, although subject to UNCITRAL rules, to be administered by ICSID. Also on July 17, 2003, the Acting Secretary-General of the Centre registered the second Request, pursuant to Article 36(3) of the Convention. This case was registered as ICSID Case No. ARB/03/17 with the formal heading of Aguas Provinciales de Santa Fe S.A., Suez, Sociedad General de Aguas de Barcelona S.A. and Interagua Servicios Integrales del Agua S.A. v. Argentine Republic.\n\n7.\n\nThe parties could not reach an agreement on the number of arbitrators to comprise the arbitral tribunals in these cases nor on the method for their appointment. Accordingly, on September 22, 2003, the Claimants requested the relevant Tribunals to be constituted in accordance with the formula set forth in Article 37(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention; *i.e.* one arbitrator appointed by each party, and the third arbitrator, who would serve as president of the tribunal, to be appointed by agreement of the parties. The Claimants appointed Professor Gabrielle Kaufmann-Kohler, a Swiss national, as arbitrator. The Argentine Republic in turn appointed as arbitrator Professor Pedro Nikken, a national of Venezuela.\n\n8.\n\nIn the absence of an agreement between the parties on the name of the presiding arbitrator, on October 21, 2003 the Claimants, invoking Article 38 of the ICSID Convention and Rule 4 of the ICSID Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings (Arbitration Rules), requested the Centre to make this appointment. With the agreement of both parties, the Centre appointed Professor Jeswald W. Salacuse, a national of the United States of America, as the President of the Tribunal. The Parties agreed that the same Tribunal would hear all three cases indicated above, in addition to a fourth case7 against Argentina involving the privatization of the water system in the Province of Cordoba, which was subsequently discontinued following an agreement between the parties.\n\nICSID Case No. ARB/03/18.\n\n9.\n\nOn February 17, 2004, the Deputy Secretary-General of ICSID, in accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 6(1), notified the parties that all three arbitrators had accepted their appointments and that the Tribunal was therefore deemed to be constituted and the proceedings to have begun on that date. In connection with their appointment, each member of the Tribunal made declarations pursuant to Rule 6 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules with respect to circumstances affecting reliability for exercising independent judgment.\n\n10.\n\nOn June 7, 2004, the Tribunal held a session with the parties at the seat of the Centre in Washington, D.C. During the session the parties in the ICSID cases confirmed their agreement that the Tribunal had been properly constituted in accordance with the relevant provisions of the ICSID Convention and the ICSID Arbitration Rules and that they did not have any objections in this respect. Similarly, in the case governed by the UNCITRAL Rules, AWG and Argentina also agreed that the Tribunal had been properly constituted.\n\n11.\n\nHaving been duly constituted, the Tribunal under both ICSID and UNCITRAL Rules proceeded to hear the above entitled cases and to make a series of important decisions concerning their timetables and procedures on submission of documents, the jurisdiction of the tribunal8, requests by a group of non-governmental organization to participate as amicus curiae9, the withdrawal of certain parties, and various other matters concerning the orderly management and processing of the arbitral proceedings. From May 28 to June 1, 2007, the Tribunal with the full participation of the parties held a hearing on the merits in ICSID Case No. ARB/03/17. With respect to ICSID Case No. ARB/03/19 and the case subject to UNCITRAL Rules, with the completion of the various phases for the submission of documents, the Tribunal with the agreement of the parties fixed the dates for a hearing on the merits in these cases for the period October 29 to November 8, 2007 at the offices of the Centre in Washington, DC.\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction, May 16, 2006.\n\nOrder in response to a Petition for Participation as *Amicus Curiae*, March 17, 2006.\n\n**II. The Proposal for the Disqualification of Professor Gabrielle Kaufmann-Kohler**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n12.\n\nOn October 12, 2007, the Respondent filed with the Secretary of the Tribunal a Proposal (hereinafter \"Respondent's Proposal\") under Article 57 of the Convention and Rule 9 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules to disqualify Professor Gabrielle Kauffman-Kohler as a member of the Tribunal by virtue of the objective existence of justified doubts with respect to her impartiality.\" (para. 1) (\"...en virtud de la existencia objetiva de dudas justificadas respecto de su imparcialidad.\") The alleged basis for this request arose out of the fact that Professor Kaufman-Kohler had been a member of an ICSID tribunal in the case of *Compa\u00f1\u00eda de Aguas del Aconquija S.A. and Vivendi Universal S.A. v. Argentine Republic*10, hereinafter referred to as the *Aguas del Aconquija* case, which had rendered an award against Argentina on August 20, 2007.\n\n*Compa\u00f1ia de Aguas del Aconquija S.A. and Vivendi Universal S.A. v. Argentine Republic,* ICSID Case No. ARB/97/3.\n\n13.\n\nThe *Aguas del Aconquija* case, which concerned a conflict between the parties arising out of the privatization of the water and sewage system in the Argentine province of Tucum\u00e1n in 1995, had a protracted history beginning with an ICSID arbitration initiated in 1996 which resulted in a an award in 2000, which was subsequently subject to a decision on annulment in 200211 which in turn led to the constitution of a new tribunal in April 2004, of which Professor Kaufmann-Kohler, having been appointed by the claimants in the case, was a member. It was this tribunal that would render an award of $105,000,000, plus interests and costs, in favor of the claimants and against Argentina on August 20, 2007, and which has caused Argentina to seek to disqualify Professor Kaufmann-Kohler as an arbitrator in the three cases being considered by the present Tribunal. Argentina's Proposal, which will be discussed at length later in this decision, argues that the award in the *Aguas del Aconquija* case is so flawed, particularly in its findings of fact and its appraisal of the evidence, that Professor Kaufmann-Kohler's very participation in that decision \"... reveals a prima facie lack of impartiality of the above mentioned arbitrator, made evident through the most prominent inconsistencies of the award that result in the total lack of reliability towards Ms Gabrielle Kaufmann-Kohler.\" (Respondent Proposal para. 8).\n\nDecision on Annulment, July 3, 2002 (English) (Spanish)\n\n14.\n\nOnce the Tribunal became aware of the Respondent's Proposal, Professor Kaufmann-Kohler immediately withdrew from Tribunal deliberations, and the two remaining members suspended proceedings in three above-entitled cases pursuant to Rule 9 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules on October 15, 2007, forwarded the Respondent's Proposal to the Claimants with a request for their observations, and invited Professor Kaufmann-Kohler to furnish any explanations that she wished to make, in accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 9(3).\n\n15.\n\nBy letter of October 16, 2007, Professor Kaufmann-Kohler responded in part as follows:\n\n\"I do not wish to comment on the merits of the proposal, but to state that I have always considered it my duty as an arbitrator to be impartial and exercise independent judgment and that I intend to comply with such duty in these arbitrations as in all others in which I serve.\"\n\nThe Tribunal also forwarded Professor Kaufmann-Kohler's explanation to the parties for any comment they wished to make.\n\n16.\n\nOn October 17, 2007, the Claimants submitted a letter in which they requested that Argentina's challenge be dismissed and that the scheduled dates for the hearings on the merits be maintained. On October 17, 2007, Argentina submitted a new letter reaffirming its Proposal in the light of Professor Kaufmann-Kohler's statement.\n\n17.\n\nICSID Arbitration Rule 9(4) requires that in the event of a challenge to one member of an arbitral tribunal, \"...the other members shall promptly consider and vote on the proposal in the absence of the arbitrator concerned.\" Professor Kaufman-Kohler having withdrawn from all deliberations of the Tribunal until the matter of the challenge against her is resolved, the undersigned other Tribunal members have considered the various documents submitted in this case, as well as the relevant legal authorities, and have arrived at the following decision.\n\n**III. Timeliness of the Respondent's Proposal**\n------------------------------------------------\n\n18.\n\nAn orderly and fair arbitration proceeding while permitting challenges to arbitrators on specified grounds also normally requires that such challenges be made in a timely fashion. As Prof. Albert Jan van den Berg has stated in his Report on Challenge Procedure, cited by Argentina in its proposal (footnote 39), handling challenges involves a balancing of interests the first of which is that \"... the arbitration should take place with due dispatch and the possibility of delaying tactics should be reduced to a minimum.\"12 Recognizing that such challenges may be abused, arbitration rules normally provide that challenges that are not timely should not be considered. In the three cases for which this Tribunal is responsible, two different sets of rules are applicable: the ICSID Convention and Rules in Case Nos. ARB/03/17 and ARB/03/19 and the UNCITRAL Rules in *Anglian Water Limited (AWG) v. The Argentine Republic*. We consider first the application of the UNCITRAL rules to the last-mentioned case.\n\nReprinted in T. Varady *et al*., *International Commercial Arbitration: A Transnational Perspective* (2nd ed, 2003) p. 381.\n\n19.\n\nArticle 11 of the UNCITRAL Rules governs challenges to arbitrators. Paragraph 1 of that article provides:\n\nA party who intends to challenge an arbitrator shall send notice of his challenge with fifteen days after the appointment of the challenged arbitrator has been notified to the challenging party or within fifteen days after the circumstances mentioned in articles 9 and 10 became known to the party.\n\n20.\n\nThe circumstances referred to in articles 9 and 10 are \"... any circumstances likely to give rise to justifiable doubts as to his [ *i.e.* the challenged arbitrator's] impartiality or independence.\"\n\n21.\n\nAccording to Argentina's Proposal, the circumstance that gave rise to such doubts was the issuance of the award in the *Aguas del Aconquija* case on August 20, 2007. It is undisputed that Argentina had knowledge of that award on that date. Therefore, under UNCITRAL Rules, the very latest that Argentina might have lodged a challenge against Professor Kaufmann-Kohler based on knowledge of that circumstance was September 4, 2007. Since the Tribunal did not receive Argentina's Proposal to challenge Professor Kaufmann-Kohler until October 12, 2007, some fifty-two days after Argentina had knowledge of the decision in the *Aguas del Aconquija* case and some thirty-eight days after the deadline specified by article 11(1) of the UNCITRAL Rules, its Proposal may not be considered under the UNCITRAL Rules and we therefore dismiss its challenge in the *Anglian Water Group (AWG) v. Argentina* case as being untimely.\n\n22.\n\nWith respect to the two ICSID cases to be decided by the Tribunal, neither the ICSID Convention nor the ICSID Rules specify a definite, quantifiable deadline beyond which a challenge is not to be considered. However, ICSID Rules are not without limits with respect to time. Article 9(1) of the ICSID Rules provides that:\n\nA party proposing the disqualification of an arbitrator pursuant to Article 57 of the Convention shall promptly, and in any event before the proceeding is declared closed, file its proposal with the Secretary-General stating its reasons therefore. (emphasis supplied)\n\nThe Spanish language version of Rule 9 requires the challenging party to file its proposal *\"sin demora,*\" *i.e.* without delay. In the same vein, according to the French version of Rule 9, the proposal should be filed *\"dans les plus brefs d\u00e9lais.\"* The application of Rule 9(1) raises the question of whether Argentina filed its proposal \"promptly\" or \"without delay.\"\n\n23.\n\nThe word \"promptly\" is defined by the Oxford English Dictionary as \"readily, quickly, directly at once, without a moment's delay.\"13 Webster's Unabridged Dictionary (2nd ed) in similar vein defines the term as \"readily, quickly, expeditiously.\"14 In his authoritative work on the ICSID Convention, Prof. Christoph Schreuer specifically addresses the question of the meaning of \"promptly\" with respect to challenges to disqualify an arbitrator. He states:\n\nPromptly means that the proposal to disqualify must be made as soon as the party concerned learns of the grounds for a possible disqualification.15\n\nUnder the ICSID Rules, the sanction for the failure to object promptly is waiver of the right to make an objection. Thus, Schreuer also writes:\n\nUnder Arbitration Rule 27, a party that fails to object promptly to a violation of a relevant rule is deemed to have waived its rights to object.16\n\nOxford English Dictionary (Oxford: Clarendon Press; New York: Oxford University Press, 1989) p. 620.\n\nWebster's Unabridged Dictionary (New World Dictionaries/Simon and Schuster, 2nd ed, 1979) p. 1441.\n\nC.H. Schreuer, *The ICSID Convention: A Commentary* (Cambridge, Cambridge University Press, 2001) p.1198 (\u00a710).\n\nIbid. \u00a710.  \n Article 27 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules provides:  \n A party which knows or should have known that a provision of the Administrative and Financial Regulations, of these Rules, of any other rules or agreement applicable to the proceeding, or of an order of the Tribunal has not been complied with and which fails to state promptly its objections thereto, shall be deemed\u2014subject to Article 45 of the Convention\u2014to have waived its right to object.\n\n24.\n\nDid Argentina act promptly in making its proposal to disqualify Professor Kaufman-Kohler as an arbitrator in the two cases governed by ICSID Rules? In paragraph 3 of its Proposal, Argentina defends the timing of its submission in the following terms:\n\n\"In spite of its submission being timely, the Republic of Argentina asserts that it attempted to make this proposal more time in advance. But one thing is the simple understanding of the arbitrariness committed in the award that concludes proceeding by some one who participates therein, and a very different one is to prepare a written submission for that understanding to be reached with certainty by someone who has not known the case.\"\n\n25.\n\nIn its letter of October 17 2007, Argentina added, as justification for its delay in filing the Proposal, that it needed some time for the analysis of the *Aguas del Aconquija* award and that:\n\n\"\u2026 the Argentine Republic had to file the request for challenge while, at the same time, preparing for the hearing of this case, which entailed a major effort.\"\n\n26.\n\nWe can appreciate that an analysis of the award in the *Aguas del Aconquija* case, a decision of 265 pages, as well as a review of the transcript and other documents, is a task that might require more than a day or two. On the other hand, Argentina's delay of fifty-three days in submitting its Proposal, a document of just 23 pages, does not constitute acting promptly given the nature of the case and the fact that hearings on the merits were scheduled to take place within two weeks of the submission. The Respondent's proposal does not develop elaborate legal arguments that would have necessitated extensive legal research and the selection of various errors from the hearing transcript is also not a task that would reasonably require nearly two months to be achieved. Moreover, to facilitate the efficient functioning of the arbitration, Argentina might have notified the Tribunal much earlier than it did of its intention to challenge one of the arbitrators, setting out its basic case on that issue, with supporting documents to follow at a later time. Taking all of these factors into consideration, we conclude that Argentina did not file its Proposal to disqualify Professor Kaufmann-Kohler \"promptly\" within the meaning of Article 9(1) of the ICSID rules and that therefore it has waived such objection under Article 27.\n\n**IV. A Consideration of the Substance of the Respondent's Proposal of Disqualification**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n27.\n\nArticle 56 of the ICSID Convention governs the process of challenging arbitrators. It provides that a party may propose the disqualification of a member of the Tribunal on account of any fact indicating a *manifest* lack of the qualities required by paragraph (1) of Article 14. (Emphasis added). Article 14 (1) states the qualities that an ICSID arbitrator must meet. It provides:\n\nPersons designated to serve on the Panels shall be persons of high moral character and recognized competence in the fields of law, commerce, industry or finance, *who may be relied upon to exercise independent judgment.* (Emphasis added)\n\n28.\n\nThus, for purposes of deciding on Argentina's Proposal, it is essential to determine whether Professor Kaufmann-Kohler manifestly lacks the quality of being a person who may be relied upon to exercise independent judgment, as Argentina seems to allege. Although Argentina did not point to this fact, the Spanish language version of the Convention Article 14(1) appears to be slightly different from that of the English language version. The Spanish version of Article 14(1) refers to a person who \".inspira[r] plena confianza en su imparcialidad de juicio. (*i.e.* who inspires full confidence in his impartiality of judgement.) Since the treaty by its terms makes both language versions equally authentic, we will apply the two standards of independence and impartiality in making our decisions. Such an approach accords with that found in many arbitration rules which require arbitrators to be both independent and impartial.17\n\nThe Rules of the London Court of International Arbitration (LCIA) state that arbitrators \"shall be and remain at all times impartial and independent of the parties.\" The International Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (AAA) state that \"[a]rbitrators acting under these rules shall be impartial and independent.\" The UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules also emphasize the importance of both concepts, in relation to the appointing authority's obligations concerning selection of arbitrators, an arbitrator's duty of disclosure, and in relation to grounds for challenge.\n\n29.\n\nThe concepts of independence and impartiality, though related, are often seen as distinct, although the precise nature of the distinction is not always easy to grasp.18 Generally speaking independence relates to the lack of relations with a party that might influence an arbitrator's decision. Impartiality, on the other hand, concerns the absence of a bias or predisposition toward one of the parties. Thus Webster's Unabridged Dictionary defines'impartiality' as \"freedom from favoritism, not biased in favor of one party more than another.\"19 Thus it is possible in certain situations for a judge or arbitrator to be independent of the parties but not impartial.\n\nOn this point, see Jean-Francois Poudret and S\u00e9bastien Besson, *Comparative Law of International Arbitration* (Sweet and Maxwell, 2007 (translated by Berti & Ponti)), p. 348.\n\nWebster's Unabridged Dictionary (\\New World Dictionaries/Simon and Schuster, 2nd ed, 1979), p. 911.\n\n30.\n\nIndependence and impartiality are states of mind. Neither the Respondent, the two members of this tribunal, or any another body is capable of probing the inner workings of any arbitrator's mind to determine with perfect accuracy whether that person is independent or impartial. Such state of mind can only be inferred from conduct either by the arbitrator in question or persons connected to him or her. It is for that reason that Article 57 requires a showing by a challenging party of any fact indicating a manifest lack of impartiality or independence.\n\n31.\n\nWhat is the fact that Respondent alleges that manifestly demonstrates Professor Kaufmann-Kohler's lack of independence and impartiality? The only fact alleged in support of that conclusion is that Professor Kaufmann-Kohler participated in and signed the award in the *Aguas del Aconquija* case, which was rendered on August 20, 2007. In that respect, Argentina's challenge to an arbitrator in this case is unlike such challenges in other many other cases.\n\n32.\n\nMany, if not most, prior ICSID cases concerning challenges to arbitrators are based on some alleged professional or business relation between the challenged arbitrator or one of his or her associates and a party in the case.20 That situation does not exist in the present case. The Respondent does not allege and certainly does not offer any evidence that Professor Kaufmann-Kohler, her legal and professional associates, or anyone connected to her have or had any kind of a relationship at all with any of the parties in the case, let alone a relationship that might taint her independence as an arbitrator. As recognized by the other members of this Tribunal, as well as her professional associates, Professor Kaufman-Kohler is known as a distinguished university academic, lawyer, and arbitrator of the highest professional standing, and the Respondent offers no evidence or facts to challenge her reputation and standing, except for the fact that she was a member of the tribunal that unanimously rendered an award in the *Aguas del Aconquija* case.\n\nSee for example Decision on the Challenge to the President of the Committee, Compa\u00f1\u00eda de Aguas del Aconquija S.A. and Vivendi Universal v. Argentine Republic (ICSID Case No. ARB/97/3), available online at http://www.worldbank.org/icsid/cases/9deci-e.pdf\n\n33.\n\nMoreover, it should also be noted that the Tribunal in the present case was constituted on February 17, 2004 and has functioned without objection from any of the parties for nearly four years in what was originally four and ultimately became three complicated cases. During that time, the Tribunal has held three hearings with the parties, made decisions on numerous requests and petitions, and has had countless interactions together and with the parties in order to carry out its functions according to the treaties and rules that govern its operations. Argentina offers no evidence whatsoever with respect to Professor Kaufman-Kohler's comportment during that period of time of any act or fact that would bring into question her independence or impartiality. Indeed, there can be none. On that score, the undersigned member of the Tribunal affirm in the strongest possible way based on their own knowledge and observation throughout that time that since the constitution of the Tribunal on February 17, 2004 Professor Gabrielle Kaufmann-Kohler has conducted herself in accordance with the highest professional standards and with absolutely strict and uncompromising independence and impartiality.\n\n34.\n\nThus the only fact from which Argentina seeks to draw an inference of lack of impartiality and independence is that Professor Kaufmann-Kohler participated in and signed the award against Argentina in the *Aguas del Aconquija*. We turn now to consider the implications of that fact. At the outset, it must be recalled that Article 57 of the ICSID Convention requires a \"manifest lack of the qualities required\" of an arbitrator. The term \"manifest\" means \"obvious\" or \"evident.\" Christoph Schreuer, in his *Commentary*, observes that the wording *manifest* imposes a \"relatively heavy burden of proof on the party making the proposal.\" to disqualify an arbitrator.21 Thus, in order to conclude that Professor Kaufmann-Kohler lacks independence or impartiality, we would have to find that participation in the award was in and of itself obvious evidence of such a state of mind. We have reviewed the award in the *Aguas del Aconquija* case but can find no evidence from its text of a lack of impartiality or independence by Professor Kaufmann-Kohler. The award was a unanimous decision rendered by three distinguished arbitrators, including one appointed by Argentina. In its Proposal, Argentina contests many of the findings of fact by that tribunal and it argues that because the tribunal's interpretations of the facts and evaluation of the evidence is, in the Argentinean view, so wrong, the tribunal, or at least Professor Kaufmann-Kohler, could not have acted independently and impartially in arriving at such a decision.\n\nC.H. Schreuer, *The ICSID Convention: A Commentary* (Cambridge, Cambridge University Press, 2001) p.1200 (\u00a716).\n\n35.\n\nWith respect to the basis of Argentina's argument, it must be pointed out that a difference of opinion over an interpretation of a set of facts is not in and of itself evidence of lack of independence or impartiality. It is certainly common throughout the world for judges and arbitrators in carrying out their functions honestly to make determinations of fact or law with which one of the parties may disagree. The existence of such disagreement itself is by no means manifest evidence that such judge or arbitrator lacked independence or impartiality. Even if an appellate body should ultimately reverse such determination, that reversal in and of itself would by no means be evidence of a failure of impartiality or independence. A judge or arbitrator may be wrong on a point of law or wrong on a finding of fact but still be independent and impartial. We are in no way suggesting that we accept or dismiss any of Argentina's various challenges to the facts determined by the tribunal in the *Aguas del Aconquija* case. We are not equipped to make such a determination. We have not reviewed the thousands of pages of documents in that case, and we have not listened to the testimony of witnesses over eleven days as did the tribunal in the case. Determinations of facts in an arbitral or judicial proceeding are crucially dependent on an evaluation of the credibility of witnesses. The only persons capable of making that determination in the *Aguas del Aconquija* case were the three arbitrators who participated in the hearings and actually listened to the witnesses. While we, as two members of the Tribunal, have jurisdiction to judge the independence and impartiality of Professor Kaufmann-Kohler, we have no jurisdiction to review the substance of the *Aguas del Aconquija* award.\n\n36.\n\nEven though Professor Kaufman-Kohler is independent of the parties, is it still possible to conclude that she is not impartial toward the parties, and specifically Argentina, because of her participation in the *Aguas del Aconquija* award? In more general terms, does the fact that an arbitrator or a judge has made a decision that a party in one case interprets as against its interests mean that such judge or arbitrator cannot be impartial to that party in another case? Further, does the fact that a judge or arbitrator had made a determination of law or a finding of fact in one case mean that such judge cannot decide the law and the facts impartially in another case? We believe that the answer to all three questions is no. A finding of an arbitrator's or a judge's lack of impartiality requires far stronger evidence than that such arbitrator participated in a unanimous decision with two other arbitrators in a case in which a party in that case is currently a party in a case now being heard by that arbitrator or judge. To hold otherwise would have serious negative consequences for any adjudicatory system.\n\n37.\n\nIt is also important to underscore that although the *Aguas del Aconquija* case and the cases being heard by the present Tribunal all involve Argentina as a respondent and arose out of the privatization of water and sewage systems in that country, the two situations are distinctly different. For one thing, the cases being heard by the present Tribunal are linked to the measures and actions taken by the Argentine government to deal with the serious crisis that struck the country in 2001. Those measures and actions were not in any way involved in the *Aguas del Aconquija* case, which arose out of events some five years earlier. Secondly, the present Tribunal will be required to apply Argentina's bilateral investment treaties with Spain and the United Kingdom, neither of which was applicable in the *Aguas del Aconquija.* And finally, the application of general international legal principles, as well as the determination of damages (if any), are highly fact-specific, and the facts in the cases being heard by the present Tribunal are far different from those found in the *Aguas del Aconquija* case.\n\n38.\n\nAfter analyzing Argentina's various contentions in its Proposal, we find only Argentina's belief, unsubstantiated by objective evidence, that the award in the *Aguas del Aconquija* case, because of alleged improper findings of fact, is sufficient to demonstrate Professor Kaufmann-Kohler's lack of independence and impartiality. Paragraph 47 of Argentina's Proposal states: \"Based on all the considerations hereinabove stated, the Republic of Argentina asserts that it is manifest that Mrs. Kaufmann-Kohler may not be relied upon to exercise independent judgment with respect to the Claimants' claim.\"\n\n39.\n\nAlthough Argentina does not ask the question specifically in its Proposal, the above-quoted statement raises the question of whether, in applying the standards of Article 14 of the Convention to challenges, one is to use a subjective standard based on the belief of the complaining party or an objective standard based on a reasonable evaluation of the evidence by a third party. In other words, when the English version of article 14 calls for a person \".who may be relied upon to exercise independent judgment\" and the Spanish versions requires one \"...who inspires full confidence in his impartiality of judgment\" are we to look only to the challenger's belief or lack thereof in the presence of that quality or are we to require a showing of evidence that a reasonable person would accept as establishing the absence of the qualities required by Article 14? We have concluded that an objective standard is required by the Convention.\n\n40.\n\nImplicit in Article 57 and its requirement for a challenger to allege a fact indicating a *manifest* lack of the qualities required of an arbitrator by Article 14, is the requirement that such lack be proven by objective evidence and that the mere belief by the challenge of the contest arbitrator's lack of independence or impartiality is not sufficient to disqualify the contested arbitrator. Previous ICSID decisions on challenges to arbitrators support our position. For example, the Challenge Decision in the *SGS v. Pakistan* case22 confirmed this view in the following terms:\n\n[T]he party challenging an arbitrator must establish facts, of a kind or character as reasonably to give rise to the inference that the person challenged clearly may not be relied upon to exercise independent judgment in the particular case where the challenge is made.\"23\n\n*SGS Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale de Surveillance S.A. v. Islamic Republic of Pakistan* (ICSID Case No. ARB/01/13). Decision on Claimant's Proposal to Disqualify Arbitrator of December 19, 2002, 8 *ICSID Rep.* 398 (2005)\n\nSGS Challenge Decision, page 5.\n\n41.\n\nTwo arbitrators in *Amco Asia Corp. v. Indonesia*24 held that mere appearance of partiality was not a sufficient ground for disqualification of the arbitrator. The challenging party must prove not only facts indicating the lack of independence, but also that the lack is 'manifest' or 'highly probable', not just 'possible' or 'quasi-certain'.25 The decision on the challenge to the President of the annulment committee in *Compa\u00f1\u00eda de Aguas del Aconquija S.A. and Vivendi Universal v. Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/97/3) took a similar approach in stating that that the challenging party shall rely on established facts and \"not on any mere speculation or inference.\"26\n\nIndeed, the application of a subjective, self-judging standard instead of an objective would enable any party in arbitration who becomes discontented with the process for any reason to end it at any time at its sole discretion simply by claiming that an arbitrator is not independent or impartial, a result that would undermine and indeed destroy the system of investor-State arbitration that was so carefully established by the states that have agreed to the Convention.\n\nICSID Case ARB/81/1, Decision on the Proposal to Disqualify an Arbitrator (June 24, 1982) (unreported). Referred to in M.W. Tupman, *\"Challenge and Disqualification of Arbitrators in International Commercial Arsitration\"* 38 Int'l & Comp. L.Q. 44 (1989) p.44. The case is also referred to in C.H. Schreuer, *The ICSID Convention: A Commentary* (Cambridge, Cambridge University Press, 2001) p.1200 (\u00a718).\n\nIbid. p.45 (Decision at p.8).\n\nCompa\u00f1\u00eda de Aguas del Aconquija S.A. and Vivendi Universal v. Argentine Republic (ICSID Case No. ARB/97/3), Decision on Challenge to the President of the Committee, para. 25.\n\n42.\n\nAfter carefully examining the various allegations contained in Argentina\u2019s Proposal, we find no evidence whatsoever that indicates in any way that Professor Gabrielle Kaufmann-Kohler is not independent and impartial in the above-entitled cases. We therefore hold that the Proposal by Argentina to disqualify her is without foundation.\n\n**V. Conclusion**\n-----------------\n\n43.\n\nWe conclude that the Proposal by Argentina to disqualify Professor Gabrielle Kaufmann-Kohler must be dismissed because it was not filed in a timely manner and because it failed to prove any fact indicating a manifest of lack of independence or impartiality. In making this decision, we have been mindful both of the sincerity with which Argentina has advance and argued its Proposal and the duty imposed on us by the ICSID Convention and Rules to decide this matter fairly and promptly in accordance with the prevailing law,\n\n44.\n\nAs from today, we terminate the state of suspension of the proceedings in the above entitled cases and affirm the schedule of hearings fixed by agreement of the parties to be held from October 28, 2007 through November 8, 2007 at the offices of the Centre in Washington, D.C."}, {"Title": "Decision on a Second Proposal for the Disqualification of Gabrielle Kaufmann-Kohler", "Type": "Arbitrator & Judge Challenge", "Date": "2008-05-12T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Decision on a Second Proposal for the Disqualification of Gabrielle Kaufmann-Kohler\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**I. Background**\n-----------------\n\n1.\n\nThis decision responds to a second proposal, filed by the Respondent on 29 November 2007, to disqualify Professor Gabrielle Kaufmann-Kohler as a member of the Tribunal. The Respondent's first proposal, filed on October 20, 2007 and alleging different grounds for disqualification from the ones raised in the present proposal, was rejected by the Tribunal in its Decision on the Proposal for the Disqualification of a Member of the Arbitral Tribunal of October 22, 2007.1\n\nSee Decision on the Proposal for the Disqualification of a Member of the Arbitral Tribunal, October 22, 2007, available at www.worldbank.org/icsid\n\n2.\n\nThat Decision recited at length the procedural background of the cases being heard by this Tribunal; consequently, it is not necessary to repeat that background in all its detail in the present decision. The following paragraphs will merely summarize the procedural steps in these cases to the extent that they are relevant to the issues raised by the Respondent's proposal.\n\n3.\n\nFollowing registration with the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (\"ICSID\" or \"the Centre\") on July 17, 2003 of the above entitled ICSID cases, the Claimants appointed Professor Gabrielle Kaufmann-Kohler, a Swiss national, as arbitrator, and the Respondent Argentine Republic in turn appointed as arbitrator Professor Pedro Nikken, a national of Venezuela. In the absence of an agreement between the parties on the presiding arbitrator, on October 21, 2003 the Claimants, invoking Article 38 of the Convention for the Settlement of Investment Disputes Between States and the Nationals of Other States (hereinafter the \"ICSID Convention\") and Rule 4 of the ICSID Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings (Arbitration Rules), requested the Centre to make this appointment. With the agreement of both parties, the Centre appointed Professor Jeswald W. Salacuse, a national of the United States of America, as the President of the Tribunal. The parties agreed that the same Tribunal would hear all three cases indicated above, in addition to a fourth case2 against Argentina involving the privatization of the water system in the Province of Cordoba, which was subsequently settled.\n\nICSID Case No. ARB/03/18.\n\n4.\n\nOn February 17, 2004, the Deputy Secretary-General of ICSID, in accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 6(1), notified the parties that all three arbitrators had accepted their appointments and that the Tribunal was therefore deemed to be constituted and the proceedings to have begun on that date. In connection with their appointment, each member of the Tribunal made declarations pursuant to Rule 6 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules with respect to circumstances affecting their reliability for independent judgment.\n\n5.\n\nOn June 7, 2004, the Tribunal held a session with the parties at the seat of the Centre in Washington, D.C. During the session, the parties in the ICSID cases confirmed their agreement that the Tribunal had been properly constituted in accordance with the relevant provisions of the ICSID Convention and the ICSID Arbitration Rules and that they did not have any objections in this respect. Similarly, in the case of *AWG Group Limited v. The Argentine Republic*, governed by the Arbitration Rules of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL), the parties also agreed that the Tribunal had been properly constituted.\n\n6.\n\nHaving been duly constituted, the Tribunal under both ICSID and UNCITRAL Rules proceeded to hear the above entitled cases and to make a series of decisions concerning their timetables and procedures on submission of documents, the jurisdiction of the tribunal3, requests by a group of nongovernmental organization to participate as amicus curiae4, the withdrawal of certain parties, and various other matters concerning the orderly management and processing of the arbitral proceedings. From May 28 to June 1, 2007, the Tribunal, with the full participation of the parties, held a hearing on the merits in ICSID Case No. ARB/03/17. With respect to ICSID Case No. ARB/03/19 and the case of *AWG Group Limited v. the Argentine Republic*, subject to UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules, upon the completion of the various phases for the submission of documents, the Tribunal with the agreement of the parties fixed the dates for a hearing on the merits in these cases for the period October 29 to November 8, 2007, at the offices of the Centre in Washington, DC.\n\nDecisions on Jurisdiction of May 16 (ICSID Case No. ARB/03/17) and August 3, 2006 (ICSID Case No. ARB/03/19 and UNCITRAL Arbitration), available at www.worldbank.org/icsid.\n\nOrder in Response to a Petition by Five Non-Governmental Organizations for Permission to make an *Amicus Curiae* Submission of February 12, 2007 (ICSID Case No. ARB/03/19) and Order in Response to a Petition for Participation as *Amicus Curiae* of March 17 2006 (ICSID Case No. ARB/03/17), available at www.worldbank.org/icsid.\n\n7.\n\nOn October 12, 2007, the Respondent filed with the Secretary of the Tribunal a Proposal (hereinafter \"Respondent's First Proposal\") under Article 57 of the Convention and Rule 9 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules to disqualify Professor Gabrielle Kauffman-Kohler as a member of the Tribunal by virtue of the objective existence of justified doubts with respect to her impartiality.\" (para. 1) *(\"...en virtud de la existencia objetiva de dudas justificadas respecto de su imparcialidad.*\") The alleged basis for this request arose out of the fact that Professor Kaufman-Kohler had been a member of an ICSID tribunal in the case of *Compa\u00f1\u00eda de Aguas del Aconquija S.A. and Vivendi Universal S.A. v. Argentine Republic*5, hereinafter referred to as the *Aguas del Aconquija* case, which had rendered an award against Argentina on August 20, 2007.\n\n*Compa\u00f1\u00eda de Aguas del Aconquija S.A. and Vivendi Universal S.A. v. Argentine Republic,* ICSID Case No. ARB/97/3.\n\n8.\n\nOnce the Tribunal became aware of the Respondent's First Proposal, Professor Kaufmann-Kohler immediately withdrew from Tribunal deliberations, and the two remaining Tribunal members suspended proceedings in the three above-entitled cases on October 15, 2007, forwarded the Respondent's Proposal to the Claimants with a request for their observations, and invited Professor Kaufmann-Kohler to furnish any explanations that she may have wished to make. After receiving submissions from the parties and from Professor Kaufmann-Kohler, the two remaining members of the Tribunal deliberated and, on October 22, 2007, made a Decision in Response to the Proposal to Disqualify a Member of the Tribunal, rejecting the Respondent's First Proposal, directing that the state of suspension of the proceedings in the above entitled cases be terminated, and affirming the schedule of hearings fixed by agreement of the parties to be held from October 28, 2007 through November 8, 2007 at the offices of the Centre in Washington, D.C. The hearings on the merits in Case No.ARB/03/19 and the arbitration under the UNCITRAL Rules between AWG Group Limited and the Argentine Republic did in fact take place during that specified period.\n\n**II. Respondent's Second Proposal to Disqualify Professor Kaufmann-Kohler**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n9.\n\nOn November 29, 2007, before the time for the filing of the parties' post-hearing submissions in Case No. ARB/03/19 and the UNCITRAL Arbitration Proceeding had passed, the Respondent filed with the Tribunal a second proposal to disqualify Professor Kaufmann-Kohler (hereinafter \"Respondent's Second Proposal\") under Article 57 of the Convention and Rule 9 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules \"\\_on the basis that Mrs. Kaufmann-Kohler does not meet the conditions required to be an arbitrator in the above mentioned proceedings, pursuant to the provisions set forth in Article 14(1) of the ICSID Convention.\" Specifically, the Respondent alleged that \"..Mrs. Kaufmann-Kohler cannot be'relied upon to exercise independent judgment,'... since [she] holds the position of Director of the UBS group.\" Moreover, the Respondent asserted that Professor Kaufmann-Kohler failed to disclose this fact to the parties and to ICSID as is required by the ICSID Rules. The Respondent's Second Proposal also extended to two other ICSID cases, not subject to the jurisdiction of this Tribunal, in which Professor Kaufmann-Kohler is also serving as an arbitrator.6\n\n*Electricidad Argentina S.A. and EDF International S.A. v. Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/03/22) and *EDF International S.A., SAUR International S.A. and Le\u00f3n Participaciones Argentinas S.A. v. Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/03/23).\n\n10.\n\nThe UBS Group, with headquarters in Switzerland, is among the world's largest financial services companies, with operations in over fifty countries, some 80,000 employees, and over 200,000 registered shareholders.7 Among its multifaceted financial activities, UBS is the market leader in commercial and retail banking in Switzerland, a major participant in investment banking on an international scale, and one of the world's leading asset managers.\n\nFor information on the UBS group, see its web site at www.ubs.com.\n\n11.\n\nOn April 19, 2006, some two years after the Tribunal in the above-entitled cases was constituted, the annual meeting of the shareholders of UBS elected Professor Gabrielle Kaufmann-Kohler a member of the corporation's board of directors for a three-year term. Professor Kaufmann-Kohler did not inform the parties or her co-arbitrators of the fact of her election to that position. The Respondent states that it learned of this fact on November 22, 2007 and that immediately thereafter it promptly filed this Second Proposal to disqualify Professor Kaufmann-Kohler.\n\n12.\n\nThe Respondent alleges that Professor Kaufmann-Kohler's impartiality and independence of judgment are negatively affected because of the activities of UBS with respect to the parties in this case. In particular, UBS is a shareholder in two of the Claimants, Suez and Vivendi. According to the Vivendi web site, UBS was a \"main investor\" in the corporation, holding 2.38% of its registered voting stock as of March 31, 2007. UBS also held some 2.1% of the voting shares of Suez as of March 7, 2007. In addition to share ownership, the Respondent points to other UBS activities that affect the parties: UBS does research on and makes recommendations with respect to investments in the water sector, a sector in which the Claimants operate, and UBS has developed financial products that it sells to investors to permit them to invest in the water sector on a global basis. Moreover, pursuant to corporate policy, UBS pays Professor Kaufmann-Kohler a portion of her director's compensation in UBS stock. She is therefore a shareholder in UBS, which in turn owns stock in two of the Claimants in these cases. Moreover, the Respondent alleges that Professor Kaufmann-Kohler failed to disclose these relationships as is required by both the ICSID and UNCITRAL arbitration rules.\n\n13.\n\nUpon the receipt by the Tribunal of the Respondent's Second Proposal, Professor Kaufmann-Kohler withdrew from Tribunal deliberations, and the two remaining members suspended proceedings (including the date for the filing of post-hearing submissions) in the three above-entitled cases on December 4, 2007, forwarded the Respondent's Second Proposal to the Claimants with a request for their observations, and invited Professor Kaufmann-Kohler to furnish any explanations that she wished to make. By letter of December 4, 2007 to the parties, the two remaining members of the Tribunal expressed their understanding that in keeping with the parties' agreement that a single tribunal was to hear all three of the above-entitled cases the parties were bestowing on the remaining members the authority to decide the challenge under the UNCITRAL Rules in the case of *AWG Group Limited v. the Argentine Republic*. Neither party expressed any objection to the Tribunal's proceeding on this basis.\n\n14.\n\nBy letter of December 21, 2007, Professor Kaufmann-Kohler, while declining to comment on the merits of the Respondent's Second Proposal, offered certain \"factual clarifications.\" She stated: 1) that she had no knowledge of the business relations alleged to exist between the Claimants and UBS before reading the Respondent's Second Proposal; 2) that after reading the Respondent's Second Proposal she requested UBS to verify the accuracy of the UBS shareholdings in the Claimants and was informed by the UBS Corporate Group General Counsel that UBS held 2.38% of the shares and voting rights of Vivendi Universal on March 31, 2007 and 2.13% of Suez' share capital on March 7, 2007 and 1.3% on April 18, 2006, submitting a copy of the UBS communication of December 20, 2007 to her; 3) that UBS, as a global financial institution, has many business relationships with many corporations and states worldwide but that she as an independent, non-executive director has no involvement in individual investment decisions and did not receive any information about such individual investment decisions; 4) that as a result she always considered that the business relationships of UBS did not affect her impartiality and independence as an arbitrator; 5) that at the time of her appointment as a UBS director she submitted on a confidential basis a list of all her arbitrations to UBS and was subsequently informed by UBS that there were no conflicts of interest, except with respect to her position as a member of the America Cup Jury (since UBS sponsored a yacht in that competition), from which she resigned; and 6) that non-executive directors do not deal with individual UBS client matters or transactions. With respect to UBS shareholdings in the Claimants, which are a fundamental basis for the Respondent's challenge to Professor Kaufmann-Kohler, the communication of December 20, 2007 to Professor Kaufmann-Kohler signed by UBS' General Counsel and another Legal Advisor stated:\n\n\"We would like to add that all these shareholdings are fairly small, if not fractional. They do not have a strategic meaning of any kind. UBS would invest in hundreds, if not thousands of commercial enterprises around the globe in a similar way. Investment of this magnitude lies within the ordinary course of business of our bank.\"\n\n15.\n\nOn December 24, 2007, the Claimants filed their comments on the Respondent's Second Challenge to Professor Kaufmann-Kohler, in which they rejected each of the Respondent's arguments and requested the Tribunal to dismiss this Second Proposal. The Claimants' arguments may be summarized as follows: 1) Professor Kaufmann-Kohler is a fully independent, non-executive director of UBS, without any material involvement or interest in UBS's financial performance; 2) UBS participation in Suez and Vivendi is mainly indirect as an investment manager and is in any case immaterial;\n\n3) the Respondent made no allegations with regard to UBS participation or relationships with Claimants Sociedad General de Aguas S.A., Interaguas Servicios Integrales de Agua S.A. or AWG Group Limited, and therefore the challenge must fail as to those Claimants;\n\n4) UBS's investment research reports with regard to some of the Claimants are independent and not based on any financial interest in those companies; 5) UBS also gave advice to and had a client relationship with the Respondent Argentina; 6) the Respondent did not address the standard required for a successful challenge to an arbitrator, *i.e.* whether there is a real risk that Professor Kaufmann-Kohler may be truly biased and that Argentina failed to show that Professor Kaufmann-Kohler's independence and impartiality is affected by her directorship in UBS; and 7) Professor Kaufmann-Kohler had no duty to disclose her appointment as a UBS director since that fact was notorious and in any case irrelevant to her independence and impartiality in the present cases.\n\n16.\n\nSubsequent to the dates established by the Tribunal for the submission of pleadings on this Second Proposal, and while the remaining members of the Tribunal were in the process of deliberation, the Respondent filed on February 29, 2008 an Expert Report of Professor Charles W. Wolfram, Frank Reavis, Sr. Professor Emeritus of Law at Cornell University Law School, supporting the Respondent's proposal to disqualify Professor Kaufman-Kohler, which Expert Report had been prepared in connection with the case of *EDF International S.A., SAUR International S.A. and Le\u00f3n Participaciones Argentinas S.A. v. Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/03/23). By letters of March 5 and 10, 2008, the Claimants protested the introduction of this document on grounds that its submission was untimely, that it was prepared in connection with another case in which the Claimants were not parties, and that the Expert made various legal and factual errors. The remaining members of the Tribunal informed the parties on March 12, 2008 that they would withhold judgment on the admissibility of the Wolfram report until they had considered all the pleadings in the matter of this Second Proposal.\n\n17.\n\nIn the meanwhile, the remaining members of the Tribunal determined that they would like additional clarifications from Professor Kaufmann-Kohler. The President of the Tribunal therefore requested the Secretary to invite Professor Kaufmann-Kohler, by letter of March 3, 2008, to further elaborate on a) the reasons why she disclosed certain information on her arbitrations to UBS and b) the reasons why she did not disclose the fact of her appointment as a UBS director to the parties in the above-entitled cases.\n\n18.\n\nProfessor Kaufmann-Kohler responded to these questions in a letter of March 13, 2008. With regard to the first question, she stated that she provided the information as part of the process of her selection as a UBS board member. Relevant rules of corporate governance established by the Swiss Stock Exchange, the New York Stock Exchange, and the Swiss Code of Best Practices require that UBS ascertain that a prospective director meets specified independence and disclosure requirements. The submission of the list of her arbitrations was also intended to ascertain whether any connection existed between UBS and any parties in those arbitrations. With regard to the second question, she responded that she did not disclose the fact of her appointment as a UBS director to the parties because the Swiss banking law imposed a strict separation between the management and supervision of a bank through two distinct bodies - one for management and one for supervision and control \u2014 and that as a director her responsibilities were limited to supervision and control. As a member of the supervisory body, she was not involved in the management of the bank's business, had no indication of any connections between the bank and a party in any of her arbitrations, and had never come across any indication of such a connection in her activities as a UBS director. She therefore saw no reason to advise all the parties in her pending arbitrations of an unrelated appointment as a UBS board member.\n\n19.\n\nSubsequent to receiving this letter, the remaining members of the Tribunal asked for observations on the letter from the parties. The parties did provide such observations but they were to a significant extent based in the same arguments that they had previously advanced in earlier pleadings, reformulated in the light of Professor Kaufmann-Kohler's letter. The Respondent included in its observations a document entitled \"Reply Expert Report of Charles W. Wolfram\" in which Professor Wolfram commented on Professor Kaufmann-Kohler's letter of March 13, 2008. The Claimants objected to the admission of such document as being outside the scope of the Tribunal's request for observations from the parties. The remaining members of the Tribunal reserved the right to decide on the admissibility of the Wolfram Reports and directed both parties to cease filing submissions on the Respondent's Second Proposal to disqualify Professor Kaufmann-Kohler since the remaining members considered that all issues relating to the challenge had been fully argued.\n\n20.\n\nICSID Arbitration Rule 9(4) requires that in the event of a challenge to one member of an arbitral tribunal, \".the other members shall promptly consider and vote on the proposal in the absence of the arbitrator concerned.\" Professor Kaufman-Kohler having withdrawn from all deliberations of the Tribunal until the matter of the challenge against her is resolved, the undersigned remaining Tribunal members have considered the various documents submitted in this case, including the \"Wolfram Reports\" as well as the relevant legal authorities, and have arrived at the following decision.\n\n21.\n\nThe Respondent has made a single proposal requesting the disqualification of Professor Kaufmann-Kohler in all three of the cases that the Tribunal was constituted to hear. In deciding on the proposal to disqualify Professor Kaufmann-Kohler, it is necessary to treat the case of *AWG Group Limited v. The Argentine Republic* separately from the other two cases. Such separate treatment is justified for two reasons. First, the *AWG Case* is governed by the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules, while the other two cases are governed by the ICSID Convention and Arbitration Rules. Second, the facts alleged with respect to Professor Kaufmann-Kohler's independence and impartiality differ from those alleged in the other two cases in that UBS is not a shareholder in the Claimant AWG Group Limited. At the same time, we recognize the possibility of a connection between the *AWG case* and the other two cases in the sense that if it were established that Professor Kaufmann-Kohler were predisposed to favor the Claimants in the ICSID cases such predisposition would also favor AWG Group Limited which is a partner with the other Claimants in the Buenos Aires water privatization that is at the heart of the dispute in both ICSID Case no. ARB/03/19 and the *AWG Case*. We deal first with the *AWG Case*.\n\n**III. The Challenge in the Case of** ***AWG Group Limited v. The Argentine Republi*****c**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n22.\n\nUnder Article 10(1) of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules: \"An arbitrator may be challenged if circumstances exist that give rise to justifiable doubts as to the arbitrator's impartiality or independence.\" The words \"justifiable doubt\" clearly indicate that Article 10(1) establishes an objective, rather than a subjective standard for determining the existence of a circumstance that creates justifiable doubts as to an arbitrator's impartiality and independence.8 Thus, as we stated in our previous Decision in Response to a Proposal to Disqualify a Member of the Arbitral Tribunal, it is not sufficient that such doubt exist in the mind of a party. Such doubt must be justifiable from an objective point of view. The application of such standard in the particular case requires an answer to the following question: Would a reasonable, informed person viewing the facts be led to conclude that there is a justifiable doubt as to the challenged arbitrator's independence and impartiality?9 Moreover, the party challenging the arbitrator has the burden of proving that such justifiable doubt exists.\n\nSee David D. Caron, Lee M Caplan, and Matti Pellonpaa, *The UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules: A Commentary* (2005), who state at page 210:  \n \"The inclusion of the word \"justifiable in Article 10(1) to define the kind of doubt required to sustain a challenge reflects UNCITRAL's clear intention of establishing an objective standard for impartiality and independence.\"\n\nIbid., citing Challenge Decision of January 11, 1995, para 23, reprinted in (1997) XXII YCA 227, 234.\n\n23.\n\nWhat then is the \"circumstance\" in the case of *AWG Group Limited v. The Argentine Republic* that the Respondent alleges gives rise to a justifiable doubt as to the impartiality or independence of Professor Kaufmann-Kohler? The Respondent's submissions, which it must be acknowledged tend to focus more heavily on the circumstances in the other two cases, point to the fact that Professor-Kauffman-Kohler is a director of UBS and that UBS has engaged in certain research activities in the water sector and has developed financial products to allow its clients to invest in the water sector. At paragraph 29 of its Second Proposal, the Respondent refers to one such product, the UBS Global Water Utilities Index TR-Index-Zertificat (UBOWAS), which includes \"... 12 companies, mostly British..\"; however, the Respondent does not allege that AWG Group Limited is among the twelve or even that companies in which UBS conducts research or the financial products developed by UBS include investments in AWG Group Limited. Indeed, the Respondent does not specifically allege the existence any sort of a business relationship, direct or indirect, between UBS and AWG Group Limited. In particular, the Respondent does not assert that UBS owns shares in or has any other type of financial connection to AWG Group Limited. Moreover, as will be discussed more extensively below, Professor Kaufmann-Kohler states that as a director of UBS she is not involved in the management of UBS business, does not participate in the development and management of the company's financial products or its research activities, and indeed was unaware of its activities with respect to the water sector. The Respondent offers no evidence to the contrary.\n\n24.\n\nThus the only connection, if one may call it that, between Professor Kaufmann-Kohler and the Claimant AWG Group Limited is the fact that she is a director of UBS and that UBS, among its many other activities and interests throughout the world, conducts research and develops financial products related to the water sector. The existence of such purported connection is not enough to establish a \"circumstance\" giving rise to justifiable doubts as to an arbitrator's independence and impartiality. Such a connection must be significant and direct, such as an economic relationship causing an arbitrator to be dependent in some way on a party. Such connection between Professor Kaufmann-Kohler and AWG Group Limited, as suggested though not specifically alleged by the Respondent, is too remote and tenuous as to hardly be called a connection or relationship at all. An objective analysis of the facts as alleged by the Respondent does not establish a circumstance that would lead a reasonable, informed person to conclude that a justifiable doubt exists as to Professor Kaufmann-Kohler's impartiality or independence in the case of *AWG Group Limited v. The Argentine Republic.*\n\n25.\n\nThe Respondent also alleges that Professor Kaufmann-Kohler had a duty to disclose to the parties in the *AWG Case* that she was a director of UBS and that UBS carried out certain activities relating to the international water sector. Does her failure to disclose these facts also create a \"circumstance\" that raises a justifiable doubt as to her impartiality or independence? Article 9 of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules states an arbitrator's obligations of disclosure to the parties. It provides: \"A prospective arbitrator shall disclose to those who approach him in connexion with his possible appointment any circumstances likely to give rise to justifiable doubts as to his impartiality or independence. An arbitrator, once appointed or chosen, shall disclose such circumstances to the parties unless they have already been informed by him of these circumstances.\" Thus, Article 9 makes clear that Professor Kaufmann-Kohler, once appointed in the *AGW Case*, had a continuing obligation to disclose to the parties any circumstances that may subsequently arise, which would be likely to give rise to justifiable doubts as to her impartiality.\n\n26.\n\nWe interpret Article 9 to require disclosure of such facts that if disclosed might give rise to justifiable doubts as to impartiality and that an arbitrator has no obligation to disclose facts which do not meet this test.10 Having decided that Professor Kaufmann-Kohler's appointment as a director of UBS did not create a circumstance giving rise to justifiable doubts as to her impartiality or independence in the *AWG Case*, because of the lack of any business relationship between UBS or Professor Kaufmann-Kohler on the one hand and AWG Group Limited on the other, we also conclude that she had no obligation under Article 9 of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules to disclose the fact of her directorship in UBS to the parties in the *AWG Case*. In view of the foregoing, the remaining members of the Tribunal have concluded that the Respondent has not established the existence of circumstances in the *AWG Case* that give rise to justifiable doubts as to Professor Kaufmann-Kohler's impartiality and independence and that Respondent's proposal to disqualify her as an arbitrator in that case must be dismissed.\n\nSee also David D. Caron, Lee M Caplan, and Matti Pellonpaa, *The UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules: A Commentary* (2005), who state at page 202: \"The circumstances which should be disclosed are those which are'likely' to give rise to'justifiable doubts as to his impartiality or independence,' and thus constitute the bases for challenge under Article 10(1) of the Rules. Article 9 thus implicitly recognizes that although there can be many relationships between the arbitrator and the parties, the duty to disclose does not require disclosure of *all* circumstances which might support a challenge under Article 10. Rather the duty extends only to those circumstances which more likely than not would support a challenge.\"\n\n**IV. The Challenges in ICSID Cases No. ARB/03/17 and ARB/03/19**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n27.\n\nWith respect to the two ICSID cases, the applicable rules and standards governing the independence and impartiality of arbitrators are to be found in the ICSID Convention and Arbitration Rules. Article 57 of the ICSID Convention provides that a party may \"propose...the disqualification of any arbitrator on account of any fact indicating a manifest lack of the qualities required by paragraph (1) of Article 14.\" (emphasis added). Article 14 of the ICSID Convention requires as a quality of an arbitrator that he or she be a person \"who may be relied upon to exercise independent judgment.\" Thus, the English version of the ICSID Convention makes no specific reference to the requirement of impartiality: however, the Spanish-language version of ICSID Convention Article 14(1) does embody the concept of impartiality, for it refers to a person who \"... *inspira[r] plena confianza en su imparcialidad de juicio.* (*i.e.* who inspires full confidence in his impartiality of judgment.) Since the treaty by its terms makes both language versions equally authentic, in deciding on this challenge as in the previous challenge, we will apply the two standards of independence and impartiality of judgment in making our decisions. Such an approach accords with that found in many arbitration rules which require arbitrators to be both independent *and* impartial.11\n\nThe Rules of the London Court of International Arbitration (LCIA) state that arbitrators \"shall be and remain at all times impartial and independent of the parties.\" The International Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (AAA) state that \"[a]rbitrators acting under these rules shall be impartial and independent.\" The UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules also emphasize the importance of both concepts, in relation to the appointing authority's obligations concerning selection of arbitrators, an arbitrator's duty of disclosure, and in relation to grounds for challenge.\n\n28.\n\nThe concepts of independence and impartiality, though related, are often seen as distinct, although the precise nature of the distinction is not always easy to grasp.12 Generally speaking, independence relates to the lack of relations with a party that might influence an arbitrator's decision. Impartiality, on the other hand, concerns the absence of a bias or predisposition toward one of the parties. For example, Webster's *Unabridged Dictionary* defines'impartiality' as \"freedom from favor *itism,* not biased in favor of one party more than another *.*\"13 Thus it is theoretically possible in certain situations for a judge or arbitrator to be independent of the parties but not impartial.\n\nOn this point, see Jean-Francois Poudret and S\u00e9bastien Besson, *Comparative Law of International Arbitration* (Sweet and Maxwell, 2007 (translated by Berti & Ponti)), p. 348. See also, David D. Caron, Lee M Caplan, and Matti Pellonpaa, *The UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules: A Commentary* 215 (2005).\n\nWebster's Unabridged Dictionary (New World Dictionaries/Simon and Schuster, 2nd ed, 1979), p. 911.\n\n29.\n\nThe Respondent has the burden of proof to establish the existence of the required fact or facts and to prove that such fact or facts indicate a \"manifest lack\" of the quality required of an arbitrator, that is, that such arbitrator lacks the quality of being a person who can be relied upon to exercise independent judgment and impartiality of judgment. The term \"manifest\" means \"obvious\" or evident. Christoph Schreuer, in his *Commentary* on the ICSID Convention observes that the word manifest imposes \"... a relatively heavy burden on the party making the proposal...\" to disqualify an arbitrator.14 In our Decision on the Respondent's First Proposal to Disqualify Professor Kaufmann-Kohler, we stated at paragraph 40:\n\nImplicit in Article 56 and its requirement for a challenger to allege a fact indicating a *manifest* lack of the qualities required of an arbitrator by Article 14 is the requirement that such lack be proven by objective evidence and that the mere belief by the challenger of the contested arbitrator's lack of independence or impartiality is not sufficient to disqualify the contested arbitrator. Previous ICSID decisions on challenges to arbitrators support our position. For example, the Challenge Decision in the *SGS v. Pakistan* case15 [Footnote 22 in original] confirmed this view in the following terms:\n\n[T]he party challenging an arbitrator must establish facts, of a kind or character as reasonably to give rise to the inference that the person challenged clearly may not be relied upon to exercise independent judgment in the particular case where the challenge is made.\"16 [Footnote 23 in original]\n\nOther ICSID cases support this interpretation of the burden of proof imposed upon a party who challenges an arbitrator. Two arbitrators in *Amco Asia Corp. v. Indonesia17* held that mere appearance of partiality was not a sufficient ground for disqualification of the arbitrator. The challenging party must prove not only facts indicating the lack of independence, but also that the lack is'manifest' or'highly probable', not just'possible' or'quasi-certain'.18 The decision on the challenge to the President of the Annulment Committee in *Compa\u00f1\u00eda de Aguas del Aconquija S.A. and Vivendi Universal v. Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/97/3) took a similar approach in stating that the challenging party shall rely on established facts and \"not on any mere speculation or inference.\"19 Thus, in this Second Proposal to Disqualify Professor Kaufmann-Kohler, the Respondent to succeed must prove such facts that would lead an informed reasonable person to conclude that Professor Kaufmann-Kohler *clearly* or *obviously* lacks the quality of being able to exercise independent judgment and impartiality in the two above entitled ICSID cases. It is important to emphasize that the language of Article 57 places a heavy burden of proof on the Respondent to establish facts that make it obvious and highly probable, *not just possible*, that Professor Kaufmann-Kohler is a person who may not be relied upon to exercise independent and impartial judgment.\n\nC.H.

Argentine Republic (ICSID Case No. ARB/97/3), Decision on Challenge to the President of the Committee, para. 25\n\n30.\n\nWhat, then, are the facts alleged by the Respondent that indicate a manifest lack on the part of Professor Kaufmann-Kohler of the qualities needed of an ICSID arbitrator? Basically there are two such facts: 1) that Professor Kaufman-Kohler is a director of UBS, which is a shareholder in two of the Claimants and also engages in certain activities relating to the water sector, a business area in which the Claimants are involved; and 2) that Professor Kaufmann-Kohler failed to disclose the fact of her UBS directorship to the Tribunal and the parties as she is required to do under ICSID rules. We shall examine the existence and implication of each of these facts in turn.\n\n**A. The Effect of Professor Kaufmann-Kohler's Directorship in UBS**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n31.\n\nProfessor Kaufmann-Kohler is a member of the board of directors of UBS, but that fact, in and of itself, would not raise concerns about her impartiality or independence as an arbitrator. The essence of the problem, according to Respondent's Second Proposal, is the *connection* between Professor Kaufman-Kohler and the Claimants by reason of the fact that she is a UBS directors and that UBS is a shareholder in the Claimants Suez and Vivendi and engages in certain other activities in the water sector, including, as alleged at paragraph 33 of the Respondent's Second Proposal, recommending the purchase of Claimant Vivendi's shares to its clients. It is that connection, according to the Respondent, that raises doubts about her impartiality or independence.\n\n32.\n\nBut the fact of an alleged connection between a party and an arbitrator in and of itself is not sufficient to establish a fact that would establish a manifest lack of that arbitrator's impartiality and independence. Arbitrators are not disembodied spirits dwelling on Mars, who descend to earth to arbitrate a case and then immediately return to their Martian retreat to await inertly the call to arbitrate another. Like other professionals living and working in the world, arbitrators have a variety of complex connections with all sorts of persons and institutions. It has been asserted by some scholars that there are only \"six degrees of separation\" between one person and any other person on earth. The theory of six degrees of separation holds that if a person is one step or \"degree\" away from each person he or she knows and two steps or two degrees away from each person known by one of the people he or she knows, then everyone is an average of six steps or six degrees away from each person on the globe. While the validity of this theory certainly remains to be proven, its application does demonstrate how easily one may make connections between one person and another through the process of identifying real or alleged links (It is interesting to note that Respondent, at paragraph 30 of its Second Proposal, seems to be using this same approach in creating a chain linking Professor Kaufmann-Kohler to Claimant Agbar by asserting that UBS recommended investment in Inversiones Aguas Metropolitanas, Chile, in which Agbar owns a 56.6% interest).\n\n33.\n\nSuch connections are increasingly easy to make as globalization of modern life rapidly advances and countless institutions engage in activities that are global in scope. At the same time, it is perfectly possible for a person to be unaware of the links that connect him or her to others or at least to be unaware of their full implications. For example, arbitrators in this case might unknowingly have a connection to UBS by virtue of the fact that their law firms have bank accounts with a UBS foreign branch, that their university pension fund is managed by UBS, or that they or their family members own shares in mutual funds which in turn hold UBS securities. In each of these situations, a resourceful party might challenge an arbitrator on the grounds that such arbitrator had a connection to UBS and therefore to the Claimants Vivendi and Suez since in theory the financial fortunes of UBS would have some consequence on the financial standing of the arbitrator; however, none of these facts would reasonably lead to the conclusion that such arbitrator is unable to exercise independent and impartial judgment. Thus, the fact of an alleged connection between Professor Kaufmann-Kohler and two of the Claimants is not sufficient, in and of itself, to establish a fact that manifestly impairs her ability to act independently and impartially. That alleged connection must be evaluated *qualitatively* in order to decide whether it constitutes a fact indicating a manifest lack of the quality of independence of judgment and impartiality required of an ICSID arbitrator.\n\n34.\n\nThe ICSID Convention and Arbitration Rules do not provide guidance, let alone a rigorous methodology, for evaluating such connections. The Respondent has offered none but rather seems to suggest that the very existence of such connections suffices to disqualify an arbitrator. The five reported ICSID cases (in addition to our own decision on the Respondent's First Proposal) that have applied the relevant provisions of the Convention and Rules are limited in number and deal with situations dissimilar from the one we are facing. None of them deals with an arbitrator who is a director of a firm that is a portfolio investor in a party.\n\n35.\n\nIn seeking criteria for the evaluation of such alleged connection between a party and an arbitrator and its effect on that arbitrator's independence and impartiality, we identify four that we think are particularly important. They are as follows:\n\n**Proximity** : How closely connected is the challenged arbitrator to one of the parties by reason of the alleged connection? The closer the connection between an arbitrator and a party, the more likely that the relationship may influence an arbitrator's independence of judgment and impartiality;\n\n**Intensity** : How intense and frequent are the interactions between challenged arbitrator and one of the parties as a result of the alleged connection? The more frequent and intense the interaction by virtue of the relationship between an arbitrator and a party the more probable that such relationship will affect the arbitrator's independence of judgment and impartiality;\n\n**Dependence:** To what extent is the challenged arbitrator dependent on one of the parties for benefits as a result of the connection? The more an arbitrator is dependent on a relationship for benefits or advantages the more likely that the relationship may influence the arbitrator's independence of judgment and impartiality; and\n\n**Materiality:** To what extent are any benefits accruing to the challenged arbitrator as a result of the alleged connection significant and therefore likely to influence in some way the arbitrator's judgment? Obviously significant benefits derived from a relationship will be more likely to influence an arbitrator's judgment and impartiality than negligible or insignificant benefits.\n\n36.\n\nAn application of these criteria in the present case requires first a clear understanding of the facts of the situation which allegedly impair the independence of judgment of Professor-Kaufmann-Kohler. UBS is indeed a shareholder in Claimants Vivendi and Suez. While the market value of such shareholdings may seem large in absolute terms, they are not significant in relative terms, bearing in mind that UBS manages hundred of billions of dollars in assets. At paragraph 53 of its Second Proposal, Respondent alleges that by virtue of its shareholdings UBS \".. is an active part of Suez and Vivendi..\" and that UBS is a \"strategic investor.\" We do not agree. Despite the size of its holdings, UBS is a passive, portfolio investor in both companies. It does not have representation on the board of directors of either company and does not participate in any way in their management. While a part of such shares are held for UBS's own account, a large portion is managed on behalf of clients. Moreover, the precise amount of shares held by UBS is subject to change and depends on such factors as market conditions, client objectives and needs, and the existence of other investment opportunities, among others. As a portfolio investor, UBS and its clients profit from their holdings in the two claimants largely in two ways: through the receipt of dividends and by market changes in the share price. While the Respondent would argue that the market price of those shares and therefore the fortunes of UBS are crucially dependent on the results of this arbitration, they have not offered convincing evidence to support that contention. Indeed, the Respondent, having had ample opportunity to present its arguments on this matter, offered no quantitative evidence at all as to the potential effect of an award in favor of the Claimants on the price of their shares or the nature of their dividend distributions. Indeed, given the size and scope of activities of both companies and the countless factors that may influence share prices on a stock market, it is more likely that this arbitration, whatever its outcome, will have a negligible effect on the share price of Vivendi and Suez and certainly on the financial fortunes of UBS. With respect to any alleged benefit flowing to UBS as a result of this arbitration, it should be pointed out that UBS's holding in Suez and Vivendi would have an insignificant effect on UBS profitability given the enormous size and scope of UBS global operations. Thus we do not find that the relationship between UBS and the Claimants is as strong and direct as the Respondent contends.\n\n37.\n\nIt is also necessary to understand the role of Professor Kaufmann-Kohler as a member of the board of directors of UBS. The Swiss Code of Obligations governs the organization and operation of Swiss corporations. \u00a7716 of the Code provides that the Board of Directors has authority to manage the business of the company insofar as it has not delegated it to the management. But UBS as a bank is also subject to the Swiss Banking Law. Article 3.2.a.of the Swiss Banking Law prescribes that where the scope or the importance of the business activities is significant, the bank must create separate bodies for the management of its activities on the one hand and for the direction, supervision and control of the corporation on the other. Moreover, the authorities of these bodies must be segregated in a manner so as to ensure the effective supervision of the bank's management. Swiss law therefore requires the establishment of two separate bodies.\n\n38.\n\nIn compliance with Swiss law, UBS established a corporate structure to institutionalize this prescribed separation of functions. The UBS Articles of Association provide for four \"corporate bodies\" to carry out the corporation's activities: A) the General Meeting of Shareholders; B) the Board of Directors; C) the Group Executive Board; and D) Statutory and Group Auditors. According to Article 23 of UBS Articles of Association, \"the Board of Directors has (A) ultimate responsibility for the management of the Corporation20 and (B) the supervision and control of its executive management21,\" whereas the responsibility for the management of the UBS is delegated to the Group Executive Board. According to Article 30 of the Articles of Association, the Group Executive Board is \"the \"supreme executive body\" as defined by the Swiss Federal Law on Banks and Savings Banks.\" It implements the Group strategy decided by the Board of Directors and ensures the execution of the decisions of the Board of Directors and the Chairman's Office. Moreover, pursuant to the Implementing Ordinance on Banks and Savings Banks, no member of the board of directors may belong to the bank's management. Furthermore, various stock exchange rules require directors to be independent of a corporation's management. Because of these requirements concerning a director' independence from management, it was important for UBS to confirm Professor Kaufman-Kohler's independent status prior to her appointment as a director. It was as part of that process that she submitted her list of arbitrations to UBS for a determination of possible conflicts of independence.\n\nArticle 24 of the Articles of Association specifies that the ultimate responsibility for the management of the corporation comprises among other things:  \n \"\u2026  \n d) *Decisions on Group strategy* and other matters reserved to the Board of Directors under the Organization Regulations.  \n \u2026  \n f) Decisions on increasing the share capital, to the extent this falls within the authority of the Board of Directors (Art. 651 paragraph 4 of the Swiss Code of Obligations), on the report concerning an increase in capital (Art. 652e of the Swiss Code of Obligations) and on the ascertainment of capital increases and the corresponding amendments to the Articles of Association.\"\n\nAccording to Article 25 of the Articles of Association supervision and control of the business management comprises in particular the following:  \n a) Review of the annual report, consolidated and parent company financial statements as well as quarterly financial statements;  \n b) Acceptance of regular reports covering the course of business and the position of the Group, the status and development of country, counter-party and market risks and the extent to which equity and risk capital are tied up due to business operations;  \n c) Consideration of reports prepared by the Statutory and Group Auditors concerning the annual financial statements.\n\n39.\n\nThus pursuant to Swiss law and UBS Articles of Association, UBS has a Board of Directors consisting of independent directors - that is, persons who are not part of UBS corporate management, and a Group Executive Board consisting a full-time managers. The directors are not full-time employees of the corporations, are not in continuous session, and exercise largely a supervisory function over the activities of the corporation. As a result, Professor Kaufmann-Kohler is not involved in the day-to-day management of the corporation, such as selecting investments or preparing research reports, does not have responsibilities over the investment and management of corporate or client assets, and in fact was unaware until reading the Respondent's Second Proposal for her disqualification that UBS owned shares in Vivendi or Suez. Professor Kaufmann-Kohler does not participate in the selection and monitoring of individual UBS investments, nor was she kept informed of individual UBS securities holdings. Respondent offered no evidence to the contrary with regard to Professor Kaufmann-Kohler's specific duties and responsibilities as a member of the UBS board of directors.\n\n40.\n\nWith the above understanding of the facts, we now proceed to evaluate the alleged connection between Professor Kaufmann-Kohler and the Claimants by applying the four criteria suggested above: proximity, intensity, dependence, and materiality. First, with regard to proximity, the facts as discussed above indicate that any connection between Professor Kaufmann-Kohler and the Claimants Vivendi and Suez is remote and certainly not direct. Professor Kaufmann-Kohler has no direct relationship with the claimants by reason of her directorship. She was unaware of the shareholdings and did not participate in their selection and monitoring. Second, the alleged connection does not demonstrate or represent any frequency of interaction or contact between Professor Kaufmann-Kohler and the Claimants. Indeed, there is no interaction at all between Professor Kaufmann-Kohler and the Claimants by virtue of her UBS directorship. Third, Professor Kaufmann-Kohler derives no benefits or advantages from and is in no way dependent on the Claimants as a result of the alleged connection. Fourth, UBS shareholdings in Claimants Vivendi and Suez are not material to UBS financial performance, profitability, or share price and in no way affect the compensation that Professor Kaufmann-Kohler earns as a director of UBS. Professor Kaufmann-Kohler derives no economic benefit from the alleged connection between her and the Claimants. We therefore conclude that the alleged connection asserted by Respondent between Professor Kaufmann-Kohler and the Claimants does not create a fact indicating a manifest lack of the quality of being a person of independent judgment and impartiality of judgment.\n\n**B. The Effect of Professor Kaufman-Kohler's Failure to Disclose the Fact of her UBS Directorship to the parties and the Tribunal**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n41.\n\nThe Respondent alleges that Professor Kaufmann-Kohler had a duty to disclose the fact of her UBS directorship to the Tribunal and the parties, and that her failure to do so is a fact indicating a manifest lack of being a person of independent judgment. The Claimants contend that she had no duty to inform the parties of her appointment as a director since this fact was \"notorious\" and in any case irrelevant to her independence and impartiality.\n\n42.\n\nThe version of ICSID Arbitration Rule 6 applicable to the above-indicated cases requires arbitrators at the time the tribunal is constituted to make a declaration concerning: \"...any past and present professional, business, and other relationships (if any) with the parties and (b) any other circumstance that might cause [their] reliability for independent judgment to be questioned by a party.\" This provision contains no specific language requiring disclosure of facts, such as the election of Professor Kaufmann-Kohler to the UBS board in April 2006, that arise after t he constitution of a tribunal.\n\n43.\n\nSubsequent to the commencement of the proceedings in the above-entitled cases, ICSID Arbitration Rule 6 was amended to provide that arbitrators, once appointed, have \".a continuing obligation promptly to notify the Secretary-General of the Centre of any such relationship or circumstance that subsequently arises during.[a] proceeding..\" While this amendment does not itself apply to this case, it does raise an interpretation question with respect to the prior version of the Rule. Specifically, are we to interpret old Rule 6 as implicitly containing an obligation of continuing disclosure and that the new version of Rule 6 has simply made that obligation explicit? Or, are we to interpret the old version of Rule 6 as not including a continuing obligation of disclosure? We think that the correct approach is to hold that the old version contained implicitly a continuing obligation of disclosure and that Professor Kaufmann-Kohler and the other members of the Tribunal had a continuing obligation of disclosure in the above-entitled cases.22 Commentators agree with this interpretation of the original Arbitration Rule 6.23\n\nSee *Compa\u00f1\u00eda de Aguas del Aconquija S.A. and Vivendi Universal v. Argentine Republic* :   \n... Arbitration Rule 6 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules. imposes the obligation to declare \"past and present *professional*, *business* and *other relationships* (if any) with the parties\". The *fundamental principle* is that arbitrators *shall be* and *remain* independent and impartial; in terms of Article 14 (1) of the Convention, they must be able to be \"relied on to exercise independent judgment\".\n\nSee C.H. Schreuer, *The ICSID Convention: A Commentary* (2001), p.516, \u00a723; \"Arbitrators have an affirmative duty to inform themselves of any possible conflicting interests or relationships. This duty of disclosure is an ongoing duty for an arbitrator that continues throughout the proceedings.\" See also, I. Shihata, \"*The Experience of ICSID and the Selection of Arbitrators,\"* News from ICSID, Vol.6/1 (1989) 5-6. \"If the facts that could cast doubt on the arbitrator's independence and impartiality arise during the course of the proceeding, the arbitrator is to reveal them promptly.\"\n\n44.\n\nThe ICSID Arbitration Rules also do not state the consequence of the arbitrator's failure to disclose a relevant fact affecting independence or impartiality of judgment. According to one source commenting on the UNCITRAL Rules, \"a failure to disclose *may give rise* to justifiable doubts but does not, per se, establish such justifiable doubts.\"24 According to another, also discussing the UNCITRAL Rules, failure to disclose *may nonetheless give rise to doubts* as to an arbitrator's impartiality,25 however, whether nondisclosure raises such doubts depends on whether the failure to disclose was inadvertent or intentional, whether it was the result of an honest exercise of discretion, whether the facts that were not disclosed raised obvious questions about impartiality and independence, and whether the nondisclosure is an aberration on the part of the conscientious arbitrator or part of a pattern of circumstances raising doubts as to impartiality, and this balancing is for the deciding authority (in the present case, the remaining arbitrators) to perform in each particular case.26\n\nD. Caron, L. Caplan, M. Pellonpaa, *The UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules: a Commentary* (2006) 226\n\nS. Baker, M Davis, *The UNCITRAL arbitration rules in practice: the experience of the Iran-United States Claims Tribunal* (1992) 50.\n\nIbid.\n\n45.\n\nDid Professor Kaufmann-Kohler have a duty to disclose to the parties and the Tribunal her election as director of UBS at the time she accepted that position? We do not accept the Claimants' contention that the fact of her directorship was \"notorious,\" by which the Claimants mean that the Respondent knew or should have known of this fact. While the identity of directors of a publicly traded company, such as UBS, is a matter of public record, the knowledge of the fact that Professor Kaufmann-Kohler was a UBS director is not so public and wide-spread that one can reasonably assume that the Respondent actually knew or should have known of that fact.\n\n46.\n\nA reasonable interpretation of ICSID Arbitration Rule 6 is that an arbitrator is required to disclose a fact only if he or she reasonably believes that such fact would reasonably cause his or her reliability for independent judgment to be questioned by a reasonable person. The ground of the Respondent's challenge is not Professor Kaufmann-Kohler's directorship, but the fact that UBS is a shareholder in Suez and in Vivendi. If UBS did not have shareholdings in the Claimants, Professor Kaufmann-Kohler would not have been required to disclose her appointment as director since the mere fact of her directorship in UBS would be irrelevant as to her independence. It is the fact that UBS holds shares in the Claimants that causes the Respondent to challenge her. But Professor Kaufmann-Kohler states that she did not know that UBS held shares in the Claimants. Can she be required to disclose a fact that she does not know? The answer to that question is plainly \"no.\" But one may ask a further question: Even though Professor Kaufmann-Kohler may not have actually known of UBS shareholdings *, should* she have known about them? Or at least did she have an obligation to inquire as to whether UBS had shareholdings in or relationships with the Claimants at the time she became a director? Did she make sufficient efforts to determine the existence of possible compromising relationships between UBS on the one hand and Suez and Vivendi on the other?\n\n47.\n\nOn this question, the ICSID Arbitration Rules offer little guidance. They require only the making of a declaration. They contain no specific requirement that an arbitrator is to make an investigation of possible compromising circumstances and they prescribe no standards as to the extent and nature of such investigation. However, if an arbitrator has no reasons to conjecture that a possible compromising situation exists, it would not be reasonable to impose on him or her the duty to disclose. Moreover, in this case, Professor Kaufmann Kohler informed UBS, as part of the process of determining her status as a potentially independent director, of the arbitrations in which she was engaged to determine whether any of such arbitrations conflicted with her future responsibilities as a UBS director. After reviewing this information, UBS informed her that only her position as an arbitrator for the America Cup races presented a problem. As a result, she resigned her position as an America Cup arbitrator. That resignation was reasonable as was her abstention from any other action related to potential incompatibilities of which she was not aware.\n\n48.\n\nWe believe that she had reason to rely on the UBS examination of this question since UBS, under Swiss banking law and the corporate and stock exchange rules to which it is subject, had a strong incentive to ascertain her independence because the company would have encountered legal and regulatory difficulties should it represent her as an independent director and later find that a court, regulatory agency, or stock exchange had determined her to be non-independent director of the UBS board of directors. It was therefore reasonable to rely on the investigation by UBS that no conflict existed between Professor Kaufmann-Kohler and the parties in any of her arbitrations (with the exception of the America Cup) as a result of becoming a UBS director. Consequently, we do not believe that she had a duty to inquire further. Moreover, even if it were established that she did have such an obligation (which we do not believe is the case), her failure to do was in our opinion the result of an honest exercise of judgment and was not part of a pattern of circumstances raising doubts about impartiality. We therefore conclude that Professor-Kaufmann-Kohler did not violate ICSID Arbitration Rule 6 with respect of her obligations of disclosure to the parties in these cases.\n\n**V. Conclusion**\n-----------------\n\n1.\n\nWe conclude that the Respondent's Second Proposal by Argentina to disqualify Professor Gabrielle Kaufmann-Kohler must be dismissed because it failed to prove any fact indicating a manifest lack of independence or impartiality.\n\n2.\n\nAs from today, we terminate the state of suspension of the proceedings in the above entitled cases."}, {"Title": "Decision on Liability", "Type": "Liability", "Date": "2010-07-30T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [{"Title": "Separate Opinion of Arbitrator Pedro Nikken (Decision on Liability)", "Type": "Dissenting Opinion", "Date": "2010-07-30T00:00:00Z", "Content": "Separate Opinion of Arbitrator Pedro Nikken (Decision on Liability)\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1.\n\nI agree that the State violated the standard of fair and equitable treatment when it failed to adjust tariffs for services provided by APSF, from the time of the consolidation of the recovery from the economic and social crises suffered by Argentina that started in late 2001 and early 2002.\n\n2.\n\nHowever, I disagree with the reasoning in the Tribunal\u2019s conclusions that the violation of fair and equitable treatment was due to the frustration of the legitimate expectations of the Claimants, the modification of the regulatory framework, and the renegotiation of the Concession decided by the State against the background of the 2001-2003 crisis. Despite the fact that my disagreement is in part only and does not exonerate Argentina for the violation of the fair and equitable treatment standard, and despite the scholarly rank and renowned intellectual and moral quality of my colleagues in this Tribunal, for whom I have the utmost respect and esteem, I believe the points on which I dissent are sufficiently relevant to justify this vote. My disagreement with the reasoning in this Decision on Liability (the Decision) extends to recent awards that identify fair and equitable treatment with the protection of so-called \"legitimate expectations of the investor,\" which, in my opinion, goes beyond the normal meaning of the terms of the BITs and the intention of the parties.\n\n3.\n\nThe assertion that fair and equitable treatment includes an obligation to satisfy or not to frustrate the legitimate expectations of the investor at the time of his/her investment does not correspond, in any language, to the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms \"fair and equitable.\" Therefore, *prima facie,* such a conception of fair and equitable treatment is at odds with the rule of interpretation of international customary law expressed in Article 31.1 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (VCLT). In addition, I think that the interpretation that tends to give the standard of fair and equitable treatment the effect of a legal stability provision has no basis in the BITs or in the international customary rules applicable to the interpretation of treaties.\n\n4.\n\n\"Fair and equitable treatment\" is primarily a \"treatment,\" that is, a behavior, a conduct of each State Party when in the position of recipient of investment. That conduct must be \"fair and equitable.\" *In essence* fair and equitable treatment is a standard of *conduct* or *behavior* of the State *vis a vis* foreign investment. The conduct that each State Party to a BIT is willing and obliged to adopt for the promotion and protection of investments and, conversely, what each State is entitled to expect and does expect from the behavior of the other Party in the same situation.1\n\nI consider this a key aspect of fair and equitable treatment, which is not included in the characteristics as described in the Decision (para. 180), with which, incidentally, I agree: a) it is a vaguely and ambiguously defined standard, the scope of which is not defined in investment promotion and protection of foreign bilateral investment treaties (BITs); b) it is a standard widely used in hundreds of BITs worldwide; c) the terms defining the standard are flexible and apply to all types of investments and ventures; d) it is a factual standard, because its implementation is closely linked to the particular facts of each case so that judgment about what is fair and equitable cannot be formulated in the abstract but depends on the particular facts of the case; e) its extensive use in BITs, its generality and flexibility suggest that this is a standard developed by the Contracting States as the basic standard of treatment they are obliged to mutually grant to foreign investments protected under the BITs.\n\n5.\n\nWhat is the \"ordinary meaning\" that States could attribute to their obligation to behave in a \"fair and equitable\" manner with respect to investments from the other Party? Some arbitral tribunals have sought to adhere to the normal meaning, the ordinary meaning of what is \"fair and equitable\" in accordance with authoritative dictionaries. The *Azurix* Tribunal, following the *Oxford Dictionary,* concluded that *\"the terms fair\u2019 and \u2018equitable \u2019 used in Article 3(1) of the BIT mean \u2018just, \u2019 \u2018even-handed, \u2019 \u2018unbiased, \u2019 \u2018legitimate.\"* In the Spanish version of the award, the expressions are taken from the Dictionary of the Real Academia Espa\u00f1ola, with the same result: *fair and equitable* means *\" \u2018que obra con justicia y raz\u00f3n \u2019, \u2018arreglado a justicia y raz\u00f3n \u2019, \u2018que tiene equidad \u2019 y de ah\u00ed \u2019que obra con igualdad de \u00e1nimo \u2019. \"2* In relation to the same concept, the *MTD* Tribunal added that this obligation regarding behavior of the host State should not be construed as being merely passive or negative, but should include *\"treatment in an even-handed and just manner conducive to fostering the promotion of foreign investment. Its terms are framed as a pro-active statement \u2018to promote, \u2019 \u2018to create, \u2019 \u2018to stimulate \u2019 rather than prescriptions for a passive behavior of the State or avoidance of prejudicial conduct to the investors\"3*\n\n*Azurix Corp. v. Argentina* (ICSID Case No. ARB/01/12), Award of July 14, 2006, para. 360. Similarly: *MTD Equity Sdn Bhd and MTD Chile S.A. v. Republic of Chile* (ICSID Case No ARB/01/7), Award of May 25, 2004, para. 113; *Siemens AG v. Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No ARB/02/8), Award of February 6, 2007, para. 290\n\n*MTD v. Chile,* para. 113. Professor Schreuer, however, suggests that the fair and equitable treatment does not include positive obligations:  \n*As a matter of substance, the content of two standards is distinguishable. The fair and equitable standard consists mainly of an obligation of the host State\u2019s part to desist from a certain course of action. By contrast, by promising full protection and security the host assumes an obligation to actively create a framework that grants security. The necessary measures must be capable of protecting the investment against adverse action by private persons as well as by State organs. In addition to physical protection, this requires the provision of legal remedies against adverse action affecting the investment and the creation of mechanisms of effective vindication of investors\u2019 rights.*  \n (C. Schreuer: *Fair and Equitable Treatmente (FET): Interactions with other Standards.* Transnational Disputes Management. Volume 4, issue #05 - September 2007.  \n However, while suggesting a reservation, the Ad Hoc Committee that decided on the annulment of the MTD award considered acceptable that part of the reasoning of the Tribunal:  \n*\"...a standard formulated in the[se] terms[..j is defensible [...] the extent to which a State is obliged under the fair and equitable treatment standard to be pro-active is open to debate, but that is more a question of application of the standard than it is of formulation.*  ***In any event, the emphasis in the Tribunal\u2019s formulation is on \u2018treatment in an even-handed and just manner\u2019. \"***  *(**MTD v. Chile,* Decision on Annulment of February 16, 2007, para. 71. Emphasis added)\n\n6.\n\nThe NAFTA State Parties, for their part, made an interpretative statement on the scope of their obligation to accord a \"fair and equitable treatment\" to foreign investments they receive. That statement was a reaction to what they considered an incorrect interpretation by some arbitral tribunals, which went beyond what those States had considered the extent of their obligations under the treaty. This resulted in the binding interpretation of the NAFTA Free Trade Commission of July 21, 2001, which specifically stated that the concept of \"fair and equitable\" does not require treatment in addition to or beyond that which is required by the ***customary international law minimum standard of treatment of aliens.*** The practice of some States is in line with this approach, as seen in their model BITs, as in the case of the United States (2004), Canada (2004), and Norway (2007). This has been reflected, for example, in free trade agreements of the United States with Singapore (Art.15.5.2), Chile (Article 10.4), Australia (Art. 11.5), Central America and Dominican Republic (CFTA-DR (Article 10.5), and Morocco (Art. 10.5). Moreover, the US-Rwanda BIT 2008 includes a clarification in \"Annex A,\" the eloquence of which can only be explained as a prevention against the extravagance of arbitral jurisprudence on fair and equitable treatment and on the crystallization of customary international law:\n\n*The Parties confirm their shared understanding that \"customary international law \" generally and as specifically referenced in Article 5 and Annex B results from a general and consistent practice of States that they follow from a sense of legal obligation. With regard to Article 54, the customary international law minimum standard of treatment of aliens refers to all customary international law principles that protect the economic rights and interests of aliens.5*\n\nWhere it is established that the FET does not require additional treatment or a treatment that goes beyond the minimum standard under customary international law.\n\nFootnote omitted.\n\n7.\n\nIt is safe to assume that many developing countries agree with this interpretation. Conversely, no other State has made any statement to the effect of giving fair and equitable treatment a meaning different from the international minimum standard (let alone linking it to the \"legitimate expectations\" of investors and the stability of the legal environment for investment). In any event, the importance of NAFTA and of the economies of the United States and Canada cannot be underestimated when it comes to defining the issue. Nor should it be dismissed that the BITs to be negotiated in the future will be in line with the formulation of U.S. and Canadian models.\n\n8.\n\nI believe this point is of particular importance in this case, considering the language used in the BIT between France and Argentina. Under Article 3 of that treaty, the Parties undertook to give the investment they received *\"...just and equitable treatment, in accordance with the principles of international law... \" (\"un tratamiento justo y equitativo conforme a los principios de Derecho International\"', \"un traitement juste et \u00e9quitable conform\u00e9ment aux principes du droit international\").* This expression does not appear explicitly in the Argentina-Spain BIT, but cannot be neglected, as it is, in my opinion, a clear reference to the minimum standard, the only standard on \"treatment of aliens\" in general international law at the time when the treaty was concluded.\n\n9.\n\nArgentina relied on that interpretation in general terms. In its Rejoinder, Argentina argued that *\"the obligation of a fair and equitable treatment corresponds to the international minimum standard\"* (para. 764 et seq), and, referring to the Argentina-France BIT, said the reference to *\" \u2018* *fair and equitable treatment in accordance with principles of international law* even *\"on Claimants\u2019 own analysis, this would appear explicitly to tie the fair and equitable treatment standard in that Treaty to customary international law and the minimum standard. \"* (para. 764). Argentina found no special significance in the difference in language between the two treaties because, although admitting that the Tribunal could conclude that *\"the standard of* fair and equitable treatment *requirement is somehow distinct from* the international minimum standard \" but even doing so, *\"it must still locate the objective content of that requirement by reference to standards that pertain in customary international law. \"6* Although this is a general statement and the Tribunal did not get the help it would have obtained if Argentina had developed a more comprehensive argument on the subject, I think the Tribunal should have not ignored this argument.\n\nRejoinder, para. 765.\n\n10.\n\nThe Tribunal dismissed the argument based on two reasons that I do not share. The Decision states that the French Treaty *\"refers simply to \u2018the principles of international law, \u2019 not to \"the minimum standard under customary international law \u2019. \"7* Accordingly, continues the Decision, *\" \u2018in accordance with the principles of international law \u2019 means just what it says: that the tribunal is to interpret fair and equitable treatment under Article 3 of the Argentina-France BIT in accordance with all relevant sources of international and that it is not limited in its interpretation to the international minimum standard. \"8*\n\nDecision, para. 178.\n\nDecision, para. 178.\n\n11.\n\nI disagree with that reasoning. Admittedly, with the exception of the latest USA, Canada and Norway model BITs, the generality of these treaties, including those that apply to this case, omit a specific relationship between the fair and equitable treatment and the minimum standard in general international law. This has led to the interpretation somewhat *a contrario,* applied by the Tribunal to this case, according to which that omission would prove that both standards are different, since the concept of minimum standard is well known and well established in international law, so that if the parties had intended to refer to it, would have explicitly mentioned.9\n\nThis line of reasoning is suggested by Professor Schreuer: *\"...it is inherently implausible that a treaty would use an expression such as \"fair and equitable treatment\" to denote a well-known concept such as the \u2018minimum standard of treatment in customary international law \u2019. If the parties to a treaty want to refer to customary international law, it must be presumed that they will refer to it as such rather than using a different expression. \" (C. Schreuer, \"Fair and Equitable Treatment in Arbitral Practice, \" 6 J. World Investment and Trade 357 (2005), p. 360, also in F. Ortino, L. Liberti. A. Sheppard and H. Warner (Ed.), Investment Treaty Law. Current Issues II. Nationality and Investment Treaty Claims. Fair and Equitable Treatment in Investment Treaty Law.* British Institute of International and Comparative Law. London 2007, pp. 94-95.\n\n12.\n\nHowever, this reasoning does not mind the painful history of the minimum standard for weaker States. Indeed, the question of why in the BITs (except in recent U.S., Canadian and Norwegian models) of the international minimum standard cannot be answered properly if the historical controversy on the concept of minimum standard is completely ignored, as done in the Decision. The concept of minimum standard was rejected by the Latin American countries since the nineteenth century and, in general, by all developing countries that emerged from Decolonization. It should be remembered that Latin America, most notably Argentina, was the birthplace of the Calvo Doctrine10 under which foreigners would enjoy in a country the same rights as nationals, but not superior rights. The same doctrine was accepted throughout the twentieth century by most developing nations, as evidenced by the Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States, approved overwhelmingly by the General Assembly of the United Nations on December 12, 1974,11 which accepted national treatment (and not the minimum standard), as applicable to the treatment of foreign investment (Art. 2.2.a) and cases of expropriation (Art. 2.2.c). The underlying claim of weaker States was well expressed, even in 1979, by Judge Padilla Nervo in his Separate Opinion in *Barcelona Traction:*\n\n*The history of the responsibility of States in respect of the treatment of foreign nationals is the history of abuses, illegal interference in the domestic jurisdiction of weaker States, unjust claims, threats and even military aggression under the flag of exercising rights of protection, and the imposing of sanctions in order to oblige a government to make the reparations demanded.12*\n\nC.

Separate Opinion of Judge Padilla Nervo, p. 246:  \n*L\u2019histoire de la responsabilit\u00e9 des Etats, en mati\u00e8re de traitement des \u00e9trangers, est une suite d\u2019abus, d\u2019ing\u00e9rences ill\u00e9gales dans l\u2019ordre interne des Etats faibles, de r\u00e9clamations injustifi\u00e9es, de menaces et m\u00eame d\u2019agressions militaires sous le couvert de l\u2019exercice des droits de protection, et de sanctions impos\u00e9es en vue d\u2019obliger un gouvernement \u00e0 faire les r\u00e9parations demand\u00e9es.*\n\n13.\n\nOne of the consequences or elements of the Calvo Doctrine was the *Calvo Clause,* which according to a contemporary author has been a \"hobbyhorse\" of Latin American countries for a long time.13 Another prominent present-day scholar has recognized that the *Calvo Doctrine* and the *Drago Doctrine* (both of Argentine origin) represented efforts by the Latin American countries \"to restrain the domination of the Great Powers.\"14 Similarly, a distinguished European professor has referred to the minimum standard as \"a legal disguise under which to protect the interests of powerful countries.\"15 The ICSID Convention and the widespread involvement of Latin American countries in BITs can be seen, in a way, as an implicit abandonment of the *Calvo Clause,* which is not entirely accurate, since that Clause was directed against diplomatic protection, which in the Latin American experience always resulted in an expression of domination by powerful countries of weaker countries. Theoretically, the system of ICSID and of the BITs is based on a relationship between equals that would not justify the fears that motivated Calvo, Drago, and their followers in Latin America, since in its conceptual design it is the result of treaties negotiated between equal States that agree in advance to submit investment disputes to arbitration.\n\nD.

It certainly was for the capital-exporting countries, but not for the rest of the world. The changes that took place in the last decades of the twentieth century, including the establishment of the internationalization of human rights and its applicable standards irrespective of nationality, well over Neer in 1926, outpaced the relevance of that debate, so the concept of international minimum standard as such, is no longer unacceptable to developing countries.\n\n15.\n\nHowever, although from the late twentieth century the debate on this concept could be considered overcome, the historical burden of its phrasing has not vanished. Clauses on the treatment of foreign investment referring to the \"international minimum standard\" could hardly be agreed upon, as some of the Parties to those treaties were not willing to accept it *expressis verbi.* \"International minimum standard\" was a \"forbidden phrase\" in a treaty for the very many countries that had rejected that standard, because it was associated with unjust international relations, as has been recognized by scholars who have addressed the issue.16 The explanation suggested by the NAFTA Free Trade Commission interpretation, which reveals the intention of the NAFTA Parties to consider fair and equitable treatment and international minimum standard as identical, was that a formula had to be found for saying the same thing but with different words, neutral words, which were not historically demonized. The phrase \"fair and equitable treatment\" is a neutral expression in relation to which there was no controversy and it had been used in another context in the Havana Charter signed in 1948 and in the Economic Agreement of Bogota, also signed in 1948.\n\nThe difficulty of developing countries, especially in Latin America, in accepting that the minimum standard is incorporated from customary international law, is noted by S. Vasciannie: *The Fair and Equitable Treatment Standard in International Investment Law and Practice,* BYIL, Vol. 70, 1999, p. 105. Also: A. Newcombe, L.

The Netherlands, 2009, p. 269.\n\n16.\n\nI also disagree with the reasoning in the Decision regarding the link between the fair and equitable treatment standard and the principles of international law referred to in Article 3 of the Argentina-France Treaty. According to the Decision, this is only a general reference to international law and only tells the Tribunal that this standard should be interpreted according to all sources of international law, in the same sense as specified in article 8.4 of the treaty.\n\nThis ruling negates the effectiveness *(effet utile)* of the reference to principles of international law in Article 3 of that BIT and is consequently unreasonable. Indeed, as the Decision mentions when considering the applicable law to this case, Article 8.4 of the Argentina-France Treaty includes in the applicable law by the Tribunal *\"the relevant principles of international law\" (\"los principios del Derecho International en la materia\"; \"des principes de droit international en la mati\u00e8re\").* This expression is to be read as a reference that ***all of the Argentina-France treaty must be construed in accordance with legal principles derived from all sources of international law.*** Therefore, the reference to the principles of international law contained in Article 3 cannot be interpreted as a simple and useless repetition of the general rule contained in Article 8.4, but should find a logical reason why the parties made such a specific reference. The most reasonable explanation is that the Parties considered fair and equitable treatment as a standard existing in international law at the time they signed and ratified the BIT, and the only one that existed at the time was the international minimum standard.\n\n17.\n\nThe significance of type of wording used in Article 3 of the BIT has been noted in arbitral cases17 and also in legal doctrine.18 Even an author cited by the Claimants in their *Reply* concurs with the above reasoning:\n\n*It cannot be excluded that a state, which has entered into a [fair and] equitable treatment commitment, would be firmly opposed to any reference to the minimum standard, given the ambiguous analogies this notion has at times allowed. If two states wish to refer to customary law, there is no dearth of established formulations to do so, as we have noted. In this way, a number of Conventions refer to a [fair and] equitable treatment in accordance with the law of nations;*  ***the mutual intention is in this case manifest, and does not present the same difficulties.***19 (Emphasis added).\n\n*Biwater Gauff (Tanzania) Limited v.

This could be the result of the interaction between investment treaty law and customary law, provided of course that the conditions for crystallization of the latter have been met. In fact, some arbitral tribunals, such as the *Saluka* Tribunal, have suggested that the theoretical discussion on the relationship between the two standards is, in practice, superfluous, and *\"when applied to the specific facts of a case,*  ***may be more apparent than real.*** \"21 (Emphasis added). More recently, in *Biwater Gauff,* the tribunal concluded that *\"the actual content of the treaty standard of fair and equitable treatment is not materially different from the content of the minimum standard of treatment in customary international* law. \"22\n\nAs the *Mondev* Tribunal stated: *\"To the modern eye, what is unfair or inequitable need not equate with the outrageous or the egregious. In particular, a State may treat foreign investment unfairly and inequitably without necessarily acting in bad faith.\" (Mondev International Ltd. v. United States of America,* ICSID Case No. ARB(AF) 99/2. Award, October 11, 2002, para. 116)\n\n*Saluka BV (The Netherlands) v. Czech Republic,* Partial Award of March 17, 2006, para. 291.\n\n*Biwater Gauff vs. Tanzania,* cit., para. 592\n\n19.\n\nHowever, even as a *current minimum standard,* and even within the concept that has prevailed in recent doctrine and in decided cases in the sense that fair and equitable treatment is different from and independent of the customary minimum standard, it could never lose its essence as ***a standard of conduct or conduct of the State with respect to foreign investments,***  which should not automatically translate into a source of subjective rights for investors. The BITs contain a list of the States\u2019 obligations regarding their respective investments, not a declaration of rights for investors. Regardless of what is considered the autonomy of fair and equitable treatment with respect to the minimum standard, fair and equitable treatment represents the degree of *due diligence* that the States Parties to the BIT mutually pledged to observe with respect to the investments from nationals of both States. The language used in the French Treaty reinforces this interpretation, since the reference to the principles of international law can only be understood, at least, by prescribing an obligation of due diligence.\n\n20.\n\nHow far does the commitment of the States Parties in the BIT to treat the investments of the other Party in a fair and equitable manner go? It is unreasonable to assume that the States would have been willing to commit themselves beyond what the canons of ***good governance***  would require. With the propriety of the government *\"of a reasonably well-organized modern* *State. \"23* On the contrary, it is illogical to understand that the intention of the Parties was to extend the protection of fair and equitable treatment that they undertook to give to the investments ***(not investors)*** of the other Party, above what is implied in good governance, just as it would be if treatment below what is expected from good governance were offered. The expectations of investors are not the appropriate instrument for measuring whether a government acted correctly or not according to the canons of a well-organized state. I think it is out of all proportion to interpret the fact that States committed to fair and equitable treatment to mean that they were going to compel their governments to submit to such a *test.*\n\n*\"...a reasonably well organized modern State.\" Asian Agricultural Products Ltd v Sri Lanka,* ICSID Case No ARB/87/3. Final Award on Merits and Damages. June 27, 1990;) para. 170.\n\n21.\n\nSimilarly, the *object and purpose* of BITs is not useful, in my opinion, to give the fair and equitable treatment meaning that is not present in the *terms of the treaty* in accordance with its *ordinary meaning.* Moreover, the international law on investment, as a whole has a purpose of protection which, therefore, invites an interpretation favorable to the protected object, but this does not allow to abandon the wording of the treaties or to redraft them. In my opinion, within the reasoning of the Decision, as with other cases that have followed a similar argumentation, there is an important link missing, because it does not explain why the object and purpose of the BITs can authorize the introduction therein of the concept of *legitimate expectations of investors,* which does not appear in any way, shape or form in the *terms of the treaty* according to its ordinary meaning. In interpreting an international treaty, the primary object of interpretation is to elucidate the meaning of the terms of the treaty so that when doing so in the light of its object and purpose the interpreter should not give these terms a meaning that is clearly outside their normal meaning, without any evidence that the intention of the Parties was to give a *special meaning* to the terms of the treaty (VCLT, Art. 31.4).\n\n22.\n\nThe concept of legitimate expectations is no stranger to the different legal systems, which, to varying degrees and on the basis of good faith, consider the party to a legal relationship that engages in self-contradiction to the detriment of the other party reprehensible. In human relationships, in general, your word is your bond and whoever betrays the trust of another must be penalized. However, the specific formulation of this concept varies in the different legal systems. Not even the English law concept of estoppel has a uniform wording or matches the same principle in other Anglo-Saxon countries. Neither is the doctrine of *actos propios* (close to estoppel) in the contract law of some civil law countries identical nor the doctrine of *confianza legitima (confiance legitime)* in the administrative law of those same countries. One of the areas where there are differences is in the threshold of trust that has to be achieved before the conduct of the party generating it is regarded as having betrayed that trust, for which damages must be paid insofar as the other party is injured thereby. In international law, in relations between States, this principle is embodied in *estoppel,* with which concept attempts have been made to connect fair and equitable treatment. I do not think indispensable to consider here whether, under international law, estoppel may be invoked by an individual who is not a subject of international law, against the State, or whether estoppel is confined to relations between the subjects of international law.24 Accepting for the sake of argument that estoppel could be invoked in the context of investment protection, the threshold required by international law is higher than a mere expectation. This has been established time after time by the jurisprudence of the International Court of Justice. The Court has referred repeatedly to the general requirements for *estoppel* to be invoked, one of these being the *conduct, statements, etc. of a State, that have clearly and consistently (d\u2019une mani\u00e8re claire et constante) evinced the State\u2019s acceptance of a particular regime.25* Or, as the Tribunal in Duke said:\n\n*... for the conduct or declaration of a state entity to he invoked as grounds for estoppel, it must he*  ***unequivocal,***  *that is to say, it must he the result of an action or conduct that,*  ***in accordance with the normal practice and good faith,***  *is perceived by third parties as an expression of the State's position, and as being incompatible with the possibility of being contradicted in the future.26* (Emphasis in original))..\n\nIn *Duke v. Peru (Duke Energy International Peru Investments No. 1, ltd. v. Republic of Peru.* ICSID Case No. ARB/03/28. Award of August 18, 2008), the Tribunal applied the principle of estoppel, but the problem to which I refer did not arise because, in the opinion of the Parties (and the Tribunal) in the case, the estoppel was complete correspondence in the *doctrina de los actos propios* applicable in Peruvian domestic law, particularly in Peruvian civil law, which governed the legal stability agreement on which the claim of the Claimants was founded (see para. 231).\n\n*North Sea Continental Shelf: Judgment, I. C. J. Reports 1969,* p. 26, para. 30; *Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua (Nicaragua* v. *United States of America), Jurisdiction and Admissibility, Judgment, I.C.J.

Peru,* cit.; para. 249.\n\n23.\n\nI believe that in some cases, ICSID tribunals have applied this principle without explicitly mentioning it,27 but I find that the doctrine of so-called \"legitimate expectations\" is inconsistent or incorrect with respect to estoppel. If those expectations came from acts that reach the threshold required by international law to compel the State because of estoppel, the concept of legitimate expectations is irrelevant, but if they do not reach that threshold, there would be no basis in international law to assert a State obligation, because arbitral tribunals have no power to create a kind of *soft* estoppel, nor to assume that the *representation* of the Common Law is a general principle of international law.\n\nAlthough estoppel was not mentioned explicitly in *MTD* or *SPP (Southern Pacific Properties (Middle East) Limited v. Arab Republic of Egypt* (ICSID Case No ARB/84/3) Award of May 20, 1992), both cases involve the principle of estoppel. In *MTD,* the investor and the Chairman of the Foreign Investment Committee on behalf of Chile, had executed a contract for a housing development at a given site, after which the investor started the activity in question, but then the government denied permission as not being in conformity with its urban planning policy. In *SPP,* after the investor and Egypt had signed a contract for tourism development in a given site in the Pyramids area, the government canceled the permit because antiquities had been discovered at the site (which should have been foreseen by the government of Egypt, had it acted with due diligence). In both cases the investor had a vested right (not an expectation), which was destroyed for reasons exclusively attributable to the determination of the State. Furthermore, both cases present an inconsistency in the acts of the State in contravention of the general principle *nemo potest mutare consilium suum in alterius injuriam.*\n\n24.\n\nThe Decision is largely based on recent arbitral jurisprudence, which has identified fair and equitable treatment with safeguarding the \"legitimate expectations\" of investors. I disagree with the reasoning of the Decision according to which that jurisprudence falls within the provisions of Article 38.1.d of the Statute of the International Court of Justice, as *\"subsidiary means for the determination of rules of right\",* since it cannot be assumed that The Hague Court will accept as such the investment arbitral jurisprudence. I agree, however, with the notion that like cases should be resolved in the same manner or, as stated by a distinguished scholar and member of this Tribunal, although there is no legal obligation to follow decided cases there is indeed a moral obligation to follow decided cases in order to promote a predictable legal environment.28 However, great caution is needed when identifying cases as alike, especially when dealing with factual issues like fair and equitable treatment and when, moreover, the BITs often contain significant differences despite their similarity. Furthermore, I understand that moral obligation includes looking critically at decided cases, precisely because they are not binding. Or rather, because of that reason they are not binding.\n\n*Cfi* G. Kaufmann-Kohler: *Arbitral Precedent: Dream, Necessity or Excuse?* Arbitration International, Volume 23 Issue 3; p. 374.\n\n25.\n\nIn my opinion, arbitral awards linking fair and equitable treatment to the concept of \"legitimate expectations\" have not substantiated or explained how such an interpretation results from the application of the rules of international law contained in Article 31.1 of the VCLT. This notion arose from the *Teemed* award in a *dictum* that has been severely criticized, and has been repeated with variations in several decisions of ICSID tribunals in the past five years, as indicated in the Decision. This is not the time or the place to do a detailed critique of that jurisprudence, so I will limit myself to pointing out that, in my opinion, none of these decisions gives convincing reasons why the protection of investors\u2019 legitimate expectations can be considered included in the expression \"fair and equitable treatment\" by application of Article 31.1 of the VCLT. Neither the term, nor the concept of \"legitimate expectations\" appears in either BIT. The practice of States has been directed, rather, to rejecting the concept and to identifying fair and equitable treatment with the international minimum standard, as evidenced by the new model BITs of the United States, Canada and Norway as well as the binding interpretation of the NAFTA Free Trade Commission. I cannot find any arbitral decision that enquired about the intention of the parties when they made the commitment to give fair and equitable treatment to investments covered by BITs.\n\n26.\n\nMoreover, the very expression \"legitimate expectations\" is misleading and lends itself to confusion.29 If it means to refer to specific investment-related commitments that are later disavowed or disputed by the State, the violation of fair and equitable treatment is based on the improper conduct of the State with regard to the consistency of its actions, which is required by the canons of *good governance.* But if it refers to expectations with regard to general statements or general foreign investment promotion policy, there is no basis in the BITs or in general international law to consider them as a source of legally enforceable obligations.\n\nIn my opinion the definition attempted in *LG&E* *(LG&E Energy Corp., LG&E Capital Corp, and LG&E International Inc. v. Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/02/1), Decision on Liability of October 3, 2006, para. 130), which the Award seems to accept in this case is far from satisfactory, since it falls into new ambiguities, tautologies, and *petito principii.*\n\n27.\n\nI find, indeed, that the development of the doctrine of legitimate expectations is the result of the interaction of the claims of investors and their acceptance by arbitral tribunals, buttressed by the presumed moral authority of the decided cases. I believe that the standard of fair and equitable treatment has been interpreted so broadly that it results in arbitral tribunals imposing upon the Parties obligations that do not arise in any way from the terms that the Parties themselves used to define their commitments. Indeed, more attention has been paid to what the claimants have considered the scope of their rights than what the Parties defined as the extent of their obligations.30 Unfortunately, I have not had the intelligence or the ability to convince my colleagues in this Tribunal, in discussions that have been comprehensive, respectful and that have enriched our joint opinions, about the irrationality and the weakness of this jurisprudence, of which I am convinced.\n\nArgentina raised the issue as follows: *\"This is an overly broad approach. It would establish a novel obligation unrecognisable to the drafters of the Treaties\",* Rejoinder, para. 765.\n\n28.\n\nOn another matter, the Decision, also following some earlier decisions, concludes that the standard of fair and equal treatment was infringed because Argentina changed the regulatory framework of the concession as part of the Emergency Law enacted to address the serious economic, social and political crisis that erupted in late 2001 and early 2002. In my opinion, the interpretation that fair and equitable treatment includes an obligation of stability of the legal environment for investment is even more excessive than the doctrine of legitimate expectations.\n\n29.\n\nSome Tribunals have concluded that fair and equitable treatment includes stability of the legal framework of the investment, based on an extremely broad interpretation of the Preamble of some BITs concluded by the United States.31 I do not intend to formulate in this opinion my specific criticisms of that interpretation of the Preamble of the aforementioned BITs.32 I just emphasize that that interpretation is limited to the BITs whose preamble contains terms such as those that support the findings of those tribunals, which is not the case with Argentina\u2019s BITs with France and Spain, which govern this case.33\n\nFor example: *Occidental Exploration and Production Company v. Republic of Ecuador.* London Court of International Arbitration. Administered Case No. UN 3467. Final Award of July 1, 2004, para. 183; *CMS Gas Transmission Company v. Rep\u00fablica Argentina* (ICSID Case No.ARB/01/18), Award of May 12, 2005, para. 274.\n\nAs did the Tribunal in *Continental Casualty Company v. Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/03/9), Award of September 5, 2008):  \n*Stability of the legal framework for investments is mentioned in the Preamble of the BIT.*  ***It is not a legal obligation in itselffor the Contracting Parties, nor can it be properly defined as an object of the Treaty.***  *It is rather a precondition for one of the two basic objects of the Treaty, namely the* *promotion of the investment flow, rather than being related to its other objective, that of granting protection for investments on a reciprocal basis. Stability of the legal framework is undoubtedly conducive to attracting foreign investments, especially direct investments where business plans can extend over a number of years; and even more so in respect of those where initial investments are substantial and are recouped only over a long period of time. On the other hand,*  ***it would be unconscionable for a country to promise not to change its legislation as time and needs change, or even more to tie its hands by such a kind of stipulation in case a crisis of any type or origin arose.***  *Such an implication as to stability in the BIT\u2019S Preamble would be contrary to an effective interpretation of the Treaty; reliance on such an implication by a foreign investor would be misplaced and,*  ***indeed, unreasonable.***  *In any case, it is uncontested that the legal and regulatory regime for CNA\u2019s insurance business in general remained stable throughout the crisis.* (para. 258; Emphasis added).\n\nSurprisingly, one of those decisions, despite being explicitly based on the Preamble of the Argentina-USA BIT, has gone so far as to assert that *\"the stability of the legal and business framework in the State is an essential element in the standard for what is fair and equitable treatment\"* and that *\"the Tribunal considers this interpretation to be an emerging standard of fair and equitable treatment in international law.\" (LG&EEnergy Corp. v. Argentina,* cit., para. 125).\n\n30.\n\nIt is possible for a State to explicitly assume the obligation of legal stability, particularly when domestic law so permits and the State conclude a \"legal stability agreement\" with the investor, as in the case of Peru for example.34 In other situations, the State assumes as a contractual obligation, through the concession contract for example, not to apply for an investment certain legislative amendments, such as those relating to income tax.35 But these are cases of specific and explicit obligations whose infringement is, by itself, a wrongful act which does not require invoking the fair and equitable treatment, let alone the \"legitimate expectations\", to explain the violation.\n\n*Cf. Duke Energy International Peru Investments No. 1, ltd. C. Republic of Peru.* ICSID Case No. ARB/03/28 of August 18, 2008.\n\nThat was the case of *Revere* *Copper & Brass Inc. v. Overseas Private Investment Corporation,* Award August 24, 1978. (Claimants Legal Authorities No. 34). According to the Award, *\"(t)he 1967 Agreement prescribed the amount of taxes and royalties which were to be payable to the Government by RJA and provided, inter alia that*  ***no further taxes or financial burdens would be imposed on RJA and that the Government would do nothing to derogate from RJA's rights concerning the project. \"*** It was, therefore, an express contractual obligation.\n\n31.\n\nHowever, an international obligation that includes the State declining to exercise its regulatory power cannot be presumed, considering, as the Tribunal in *Myers* stated, *\"the high measure of deference that international law generally extends to the right of domestic authorities to regulate matters within their own borders.\"36* The regulatory power is essential to the achievement of the goals of the State, so to renounce to exercise it is an extraordinary act that must emerge from an unequivocal commitment; more so when it is at stake its ability to deal with a serious crisis. As stated by the *Continental* Tribunal, *\"it would he unconscionable for a country to promise not to change its legislation as time and needs change, or even more to tie its hands by such a kind of stipulation in case a crisis of any type or origin arose37* That commitment would touch on core competencies of the State, which it is inconceivable the State would impliedly renounce. A treaty obligation, whereby the State guarantees the stability of its legal order by renouncing the exercise of regulatory power must be explicit and cannot be assumed through an implicit declaration, diluted in general and ambiguous expressions about a treatment of investment standard (nor even by the way, through the preamble of a treaty).\n\n*S.D. Myers vs. Canada. First Partial Award.* Ad hoc\u2014UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules, IIC 249 (2000). November 13, 2000; para. 263.\n\n*Continental Casualty Company v. Argentine Republic,* cit.; para. 258.\n\n32.\n\nBITs do not contain any clause in which Argentina agrees to be bound not to exercise its regulatory power, when necessary, particularly if it arose a pressing social necessity to do so, which in fact did occur. There is no basis in the BITs to conclude that Argentina could only exercise its regulatory power in accordance with international law, if the requirements for a state of necessity were met. In this connection, I believe that the subsidiary defense advocated by Argentina based, on necessity, is inappropriate and unnecessary given that the BITs do not contain any explicit commitment to legal stability and a commitment of that nature cannot be inferred or presumed to be implied in any international convention. As already pointed out, such a commitment must be express or, at least, unambiguous. That is not the case in the BITs under review in this case.\n\n33.\n\nIt is true that the Decision does not state that the requirement of stability of the legal environment of the concession was absolute. Citing paragraph 306 of *Saluka,* it states that the legitimate regulatory interests of the host State must be borne in mind. I consider that paragraph 307 of the *Saluka* award helps to clarify the concept expressed, for in that case it is said that one should expect that the host State will\n\n*[implement] its policies bona fide by conduct that is, as far as it affects the investors\u2019 investment, reasonably justifiable by public policies and that such conduct does not manifestly violate the requirements of consistency, transparency, even-handedness and nondiscrimination. In particular, any differential treatment of a foreign investor must not he based on unreasonable distinctions and demands, and must he justified by showing that it hears a reasonable relationship to rational policies not motivated by a preference for other investment over the foreign-owned investment.38*\n\nFootnote omitted.\n\n34.\n\nThe paragraph quoted from *Saluka* is, in my opinion, beyond reproach. It shows that fair and equitable treatment is a standard of behavior, the emphasis of which is on the duties to the State rather than the rights of investors. Fair and equitable treatment, according to the above *dictum,* does not impose on the State an obligation not to alter the legal environment of the investment, but to require that the exercise of its regulatory power in matters connected with the foreign investment comply with the requirements in a way that is timely, consistent, reasonable, proportionate, even-handed, and non-discriminatory. In other words, what should be subject to scrutiny is whether these measures conform to the canons of good governance in a modem and we 11-organized State.\n\n35.\n\nArgentina, like any other State, had a duty to take exceptional measures, without excluding the modification of the legal regime of the Concession, to address a situation that was also exceptional. These measures were unforeseeable and unpredictable when the BITs were adopted, as was the severity of the emergency which Argentina underwent in 2001-2003. The BITs, as well as general international law provided no basis for concluding that in such a crisis situation taking unpredictable action or measures affecting the predictability of a regulatory framework would constitute a violation of an international obligation subject to reparation under international law.\n\n36.\n\nThe experience of the recent international financial crisis shows how States are compelled to adopt emergency measures that never entered the minds of leaders who had instead fought their entire lifetime against State intervention in certain areas of the economy. But that unpredictability neither determines the illegitimacy of such measures, nor can it be a legal basis for those who may be adversely affected by them to invoke acquired rights or to claim compensation. What might take away their legitimacy is if they were unreasonable, disproportionate, discriminatory, or in any way arbitrary. Again, what should be verified is whether the government\u2019s measures conform to the canons of a modem and well-organized State.\n\n37.\n\nIn this context, what the Tribunal should determine was whether the various measures taken by Argentina were such that any reasonably good government of a well-organized modem State could have adopted if it had to deal with a crisis of the proportions faced by Argentina, or whether, on the contrary, and to what extent, they were unreasonable, disproportionate, discriminatory, or in any way arbitrary. However, it is not for the Tribunal to determine the alternative measures that could have been adopted, because it cannot ex post facto substitute itself for the Argentine Government when it had to address the serious crisis that hit the country.\n\n38.\n\nThe Tribunal did not enter into the analysis of each of the Argentine measures in particular, but concluded that they breached the fair and equitable treatment, because they altered the Regulatory Framework on issues that fell under the legitimate expectations of investors.\n\n39.\n\nAccording to the Decision, the mere alteration of the Regulatory Framework violated the fair and equitable treatment, because Argentina could only exercise their legitimate right to regulate, within the mles of the detailed legal framework that Argentina had established for the Concession (para. 217). This assertion is not unreasonable, provided that is referred to situations of relative normalcy, but it is not wise when a serious situation arise requiring adaptation of the legal system to the new situation. In that context, what is reasonable is precisely the exercise of regulatory power in the most suitable for the common good.\n\n40.\n\nIn that sense, I find some contradiction in the Decision, because, while asserting that Argentina retained its legitimate regulatory power, also affirms that such power could not be exercised it in any way to change the regulatory framework, not even to address the requirements of the common good in an emergency situation in a way that was or could be timely, consistent, reasonable, proportionate, even-handed, and non-discriminatory. This would mean that the state cannot, by itself, exercise its regulatory power. Then, one could conclude, accordingly, that the regulatory power exists, but that does not exist at the same time.\n\n41.\n\nThe Tribunal did not enter into the analysis of each of the Argentine measures in particular, but concluded that they violated the fair and equitable treatment, because they altered the Regulatory Framework on issues which fell within the legitimate expectations of the investors. Nevertheless, the Decision refers to various measures enacted by Argentina, directing the regulatory authorities not to respect important elements of the legal framework, identifying those measures by the number of the Exhibits (Para. 217). Such actions, according to the Decision, were beyond the scope of its legitimate right to regulate and in effect constituted an abuse of regulatory discretion. These measures are:\n\n\u2022 C-78 and R-76: Emergency Law (Federal): Law No. 25,561.\n\n\u2022 C-90 and R-82: Decree 221/02 of March 1, 2002, creating the Renegotiation Commission.\n\n\u2022 C-89: ENRESS Resolution 55/02 of March 1, 2002, rejecting a request for extraordinary traiffs review, for failure to submitt the required supporting documents.\n\n\u2022 C-93: Decree 391/02 of March 18, 2002, rejecting a request for extraordinary review of tariffs, for default of information and because it involved a modification to the contract, subject to renegotiation.\n\n\u2022 C-95: ENRESS Resolution 116/02 of February 18, 2002, again rejecting the same claim, adding that the repeal of the convertibility was not foreseen and that the request involved an automatic adjustment on the dollar.\n\n\u2022 C-100 and R-88: Decree 1252/1202 of June 13, 2002, refusing to approve the provisional agreement of May 8, 2002, signed by APSF and the Ministry of Public Works of the Province and setting a deadline of 180 days for the presentation, by the Renegotiation Commission of a project of amendment of the regulatory and contractual regime.\n\n\u2022 C-105 and R-93: Letter from the Renegotiation Commission to APSF of August 23, 2002, which rejected again the same request, stating that the contract was amended by Decree 1252/1202 of 06.13.2002, invoking the emergency regime and the renegotiation as the current framework, and rejecting the objections raised by APSF and the concept of \"insurance exchange\" invoked by the company.\n\n\u2022 C-l 15: Decree 3789/02 of December 30, 2002 extending the renegotiation for 180 days.\n\n\u2022 C-123 and R-120: Decreee 1855/03 July 11, 2003 extending the renegotiation for 180 days.\n\n\u2022 R-137: Decree 2362/04 of November 18, 2004, which opens a new period of renegotiation, responding to a request for APSF, according to communication GAL 1880 of April 27, 2004 (Annex C-l 3 6).\n\n42.\n\nSome of these measures point to the temporary freezing of tariffs, while others refer to the renegotiation of the contract (to which I refer below), refer to the renegotiation of the contract.). It cannot be argued that the measures referred to the temporary freezing of tariffs, by themselves and at the time when they were adopted, were disproportionate, unreasonable, discriminatory or arbitrary, or that they were not within the range of decisions that any reasonable government could have adopted under the same circumstances.\n\n43.\n\nNevertheless, precisely for being exceptional, those measures should be implemented for the period strictly necessary to address the emergency. Temporality is an essential part of the reasonableness of this type of measure. Argentina did not comply with this requirement since some of the measures that severely affected APSF, particularly the freezing of tariffs, were extended indefinitely, which did not comply with the conduct that good governance would follow at all times. It is not reasonable to keep tariffs frozen for a public service provided by a party through the grant of an unsubsidized concession when there is evidence that its operating costs have risen significantly, for reasons unrelated to the concessionaire. The freezing could be explained for a short time\u2014while a reasonable degree of economic and social normalcy could be reestablished. Although efficiency was one of the components of the tariff system, there was evidence of enough causes external to the concession\u2014many of them having to do with the emergency measures adopted by the Government\u2014to offer solutions to the concessionaire that would be likely to restore the economic and financial balance of the concession, especially as it was under a legal duty to review the tariffs. By failing to take concrete actions that would make that result viable, Argentina departed from the canons of good governance in a modem State that is reasonably well-organized and, therefore, did not give the Claimants\u2019 investment the fair and equitable treatment imposed by the BITs.\n\n44.\n\nIn this regard, a breach of fair or equitable treatment does not arise, in my opinion, as an immediate consequence of the enactment of the Emergency Law or the other related measures adopted by the Government immediately after said Law, but from the moment when the minimum degree of normalcy required to also address the normalization of the Concession was reached.\n\n45.\n\nI also disagree with the Decision in the conclusion that the renegotiation decided upon unilaterally by the State constitutes another violation of fair and equitable treatment.\n\n46.\n\nThe renegotiation provided for under the Emergency Law and other acts of the Province, was a general measure that affected all contracts for public works and services. As a matter of principle, it could  not be regarded as unreasonable in the context of the abolition of the regime for convertibility of the peso against the dollar\u2014which had been an essential component of the privatization policy undertaken by Argentina in the nineties\u2014 of which the APSF Concession was a part.\n\n47.\n\nRenegotiation of long-term concession contracts is far from exceptional. To the contrary, the original terms of such contracts should be renegotiated often, when faced with new and unforeseen events. In the case of APSF\u2019s Concession, before the crisis of 2001-2003, two processes for renegotiation were opened to address many problems that the Concessionaire had been facing in the early years of performing the contract. Also, regarding the renegotiation provided for under the Emergency Law, there are statements by representatives of the Claimants, in which there has not been alleged or demonstrated any coercion whatsoever, expressing their agreement with the renegotiation, always requiring, however, that the economic and financial equilibrium of the Concession be preserved.\n\n48.\n\nI do not agree with the assumption expressed in the Decision (para. 223) that APSF was coerced into acceding to the renegotiation because, had it refused, it could have been accused of violating Article 4.1 of the Concession Agreement, which obligated both sides to *\"use all means available to establish and maintain a fluid relationship which would facilitate the discharge of this Concession Agreement\"* Rather, I believe that this clause is evidence that the obligation to renegotiate did not have as its sole source the Emergency Law, but the Concession Contract itself and that APSF could not lawfully refuse to renegotiate (as in fact it did not refuse). Moreover, the international standard for such contracts in the event of *\"hardship\"* aims to impose an obligation on the parties to negotiate an adaptation of the contract to the changed circumstances or the termination of the contract,39 which is moreover, in my opinion, a corollary of the good faith that should prevail in the execution of any contract.\n\n*Cfi Principles of European Contract Law* (developed by the Commission on European Contracts Law), ***Article 6:111: Change of Circumstances',***  *UN1DRO1T Principles of International Commercial Contracts 2004:*  ***Article 6.2.2 (Definition of hardship); Article 6.2.3 (Effects of hardship).***\n\n49.\n\nWhat, to my way of thinking, has no satisfactory explanation is that while that prolonged negotiation process was being extended tariffs were kept frozen without arbitrating even a temporary remedy for the well-known financial difficulties that APSF was undergoing, as was requested by the latter repeatedly and insistently. That fact constitutes, without doubt, a violation of the obligation of fair and equitable treatment of the Claimants\u2019 investment. But that offense is not due to the renegotiation itself, but to Argentina\u2019s refusal to revise the tariffs, in contravention of its obligations under the BITs. From the foregoing, I conclude that the renegotiation process was not per se a violation of the State\u2019s obligations under the standard of fair and equitable treatment."}], "Content": "Decision on Liability\n---------------------\n\n**Table of Abbreviations**\n--------------------------\n\nASSA Aguas Santafesinas S.A.\n\nAPSF Aguas Provinciales de Santa Fe S.A.\n\nBIT Bilateral Investment Treaty\n\nDIPOS Direcci\u00f3n Provincial de Obras Sanitarias\n\nENRESS Ente Regulador de Servicios Sanitarios\n\nICSID International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes\n\nOSN Obras Sanitarias de la Naci\u00f3n\n\nPGMDS Plan General de Mejoras y Desarrollo de Servicios\n\nProvince Province of Santa Fe\n\nUNCITRAL United Nations Commission on International Trade Law\n\nVCLT Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties\n\n**I Procedural Background**\n---------------------------\n\nA. *Commencement of the Arbitration*\n------------------------------------\n\n1.\n\nOn 17 April 2003, the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (\"ICSID\" or \"the Centre\") received a Request for Arbitration (\"the Request\") against the Argentine Republic (\"the Respondent\" or \"Argentina\") from Aguas Provinciales de Santa Fe S.A. (\"APSF\"), Suez, Sociedad General de Aguas de Barcelona S.A. (\"AGBAR\") and InterAgua Servicios Integrales del Agua S.A. (\"InterAgua\"), (together, \"the Claimants\"). APSF was a company incorporated in Argentina. Suez, incorporated in France, and AGBAR and InterAgua, both incorporated in Spain, are major shareholders in APSF. The Request concerned the Claimants\u2019 investments in a concession for water distribution and waste water treatment in the Argentine Province of Santa Fe and a series of alleged acts and omissions by Argentina, including Argentina\u2019s alleged failure or refusal to apply previously agreed adjustments to the tariff calculation and adjustment mechanisms.1\n\nOn the same date, the Centre received two further requests for arbitration under the ICSID Convention regarding water concessions in Argentina from (i) Aguas Cordobesas S.A., Suez, and Sociedad General de Aguas de Barcelona S.A. and (ii) Aguas Argentinas S.A., Suez, Sociedad General de Aguas de Barcelona S.A. and Vivendi Universal S.A. regarding similar investments and disputes. As explained below, these requests would later be registered by the Centre and submitted by agreement of the parties to one same Tribunal. The first of the above-mentioned proceedings, involving Aguas Cordobesas S.A., would eventually be discontinued following an agreement between the parties.\n\n2.\n\nIn the Request, the Claimants invoked Argentina\u2019s consent to dispute settlement through ICSID arbitration provided in the 1991 Bilateral Investment Treaty between France and the Argentine Republic (the \"Argentina-France BIT\")2 and in the 1991 Bilateral Investment Treaty between the Argentine Republic and the Kingdom of Spain (the \"Argentina-Spain BIT\").3\n\nAccord entre le Gouvernement de la R\u00e9publique fran\u00e7aise et le Gouvernement de la R\u00e9publique Argentine sur l\u2019encouragement et la protection r\u00e9ciproques des investissements (Agreement between the Argentine Republic and the Republic of France for the Promotion and Reciprocal Protection of Investments), signed on 3 July 1991 and in force since 3 March 1993; 1728 UNTS 298.\n\nAcuerdo para la promoci\u00f3n y protecci\u00f3n rec\u00edprocas de inversiones entre el Reino de Espa\u00f1a y la Rep\u00fablica Argentina (Agreement on the Promotion and Reciprocal Protection of Investments between the Kingdom of Spain and the Argentine Republic), signed in Buenos Aires on 3 October 1991 and in force since 28 September 1992; 1699 UNTS 202.\n\n3.\n\nOn 17 April 2003, the Centre, in accordance with Rule 5 of the ICSID Rules of Procedure for the Institution of Conciliation and Arbitration Proceedings (Institution Rules), acknowledged receipt and transmitted a copy of the Request to the Argentine Republic and to the Argentine Embassy in Washington D.C.\n\n4.\n\nOn 17 July 2003, the Acting Secretary-General of the Centre registered the Request, pursuant to Article 36(3) of the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of other States (the \"ICSID Convention\" or \"the Convention\"). The case was registered as ICSID Case No. ARB/03/17 with the formal name of *Aguas Provinciales de Santa Fe S.A., Suez, Sociedad General de Aguas de Barcelona S.A., and InterAgua Servicios Integrates del Agua S.A. v. Argentine Republic4* On that same date, the Acting Secretary-General, in accordance with Institution Rule 7, notified the parties of the registration of the Request and invited them to proceed, as soon as possible, to constitute an Arbitral Tribunal.\n\nAs noted in footnote 1 supra, on this same date the Centre registered two further requests for arbitration regarding water concessions in Argentina: ICSID Case No. ARB/03/18 (Aguas Cordobesas S.A., Suez, and AGBAR v. Argentine Republic) and ICSID Case No. ARB/03/19 (Aguas Argentinas S.A., Suez, AGBAR and Vivendi Universal S.A. v. Argentine Republic).\n\nB. *Constitution of the Tribunal*\n---------------------------------\n\n5.\n\nThe parties could not reach an agreement on the number of arbitrators to comprise the arbitral tribunal nor on the method for their appointment. Accordingly, on 22 September 2003, the Claimants requested that the tribunal be constituted in accordance with the formula set forth in Article 37(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention; *i.e.* one arbitrator appointed by each party, and the third arbitrator, who would serve as president of the tribunal, to be appointed by agreement of the parties. The Claimants appointed Professor Gabrielle Kaufmann-Kohler, a Swiss national as arbitrator. The Argentine Republic in turn appointed as arbitrator Professor Pedro Nikken, a national of Venezuela.\n\n6.\n\nIn the absence of an agreement between the parties on the name of the presiding arbitrator, on 21 October 2003 the Claimants, invoking Article 38 of the ICSID Convention and Rule 4 of the ICSID Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings (Arbitration Rules), requested the Centre to make this appointment. With the agreement of both parties, the Centre appointed Professor Jeswald W. Salacuse, a national of the United States of America, as the President of the Tribunal.\n\n7.\n\nOn 17 February 2004, the Deputy Secretary-General of ICSID, in accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 6(1), notified the parties that all three arbitrators had accepted their appointments and that the Tribunal was therefore deemed to be constituted and the proceedings to have begun on that date. On the same date, pursuant to ICSID Administrative and Financial Regulation 25, the parties were informed that Mr. Gonzalo Flores, Senior Counsel, ICSID, would serve as Secretary of the Arbitral Tribunal. The parties agreed that the same tribunal would hear and decide ICSID Case No. ARB/03/17 along with three other cases involving water concessions in the provinces of Buenos Aires (ICSID Case No. ARB/03/19 and the arbitration instituted by AWG against the Argentine Republic under the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL) Arbitration Rules), and Cordoba (ICSID Case No. ARB/03/18). The proceedings instituted under the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules are also being administered by ICSID following the parties\u2019 agreement and the Tribunal\u2019s consent.\n\nC. *Preliminary Session and Scheduling*\n---------------------------------------\n\n8.\n\nUnder ICSID Arbitration Rule 13, the Tribunal shall hold its first session within 60 days after its constitution or such other period as the parties may agree. The parties could not agree on a suitable date for the first session within the prescribed time limits. The Tribunal accordingly held its first session without the parties via telephone conference on 19 April 2004.\n\n9.\n\nOn 7 June 2004, the Tribunal held a session with the parties at the seat of the Centre in Washington, D.C. During the session the parties confirmed their agreement that the Tribunal had been properly constituted in accordance with the relevant provisions of the ICSID Convention and the ICSID Arbitration Rules and that they did not have any objections in this respect.\n\n10.\n\nDuring the session the parties also agreed on a number of procedural matters reflected in written minutes signed by the President and the Secretary of the Tribunal.5 The Tribunal, after consultation with the parties, also fixed a timetable for the written and oral pleadings in this case.\n\nDuring the session the parties agreed on a series of procedural matters related to the present case, ICSID Cases Nos. ARB/03/19 and ARB/03/18 and the UNCITRAL arbitration instituted by AWG. These agreements included a staggered schedule of written and oral submissions. A copy of the minutes of the session was enclosed as Annex No. 1 to the Tribunal\u2019s Decision on Jurisdiction.\n\nD. *Respondent\u2019s Challenge to Jurisdiction*\n-------------------------------------------\n\n11.\n\nIn accordance with the agreed timetable, on 20 September 2004, the Claimants filed their Memorial on the Merits with accompanying documentation. On 26 November 2004 Argentina filed a Memorial with objections to jurisdiction.\n\n12.\n\nBy letter of 3 December 2004, the Tribunal confirmed the suspension of the proceedings on the merits in accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 41(3). On 1 February 2005, the Claimants filed their Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction.\n\n13.\n\nAs agreed upon during the 7 June 2004 session, a hearing on jurisdiction was held at the seat of the Centre in Washington, D.C. on 9 May 2005. Mr. Nigel Blackaby, Mr. Lluis Paradell and Ms. Noiana Marigo from Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer LLP, Mr. Bernardo Iriberri, from the Buenos Aires-based law firm Estudio Cardenas Cassagne y Asociados, Messrs. Jean-Paul Minette and Patrice Herbert from Suez Environment and Mr. Miquel Gri\u00f1o, from AGBAR, attended the hearing on behalf of the Claimants. Messrs. Jorge Barraguirre and Ignacio Torterola from the *Procuraci\u00f3n del Tesoro de la Naci\u00f3n Argentina,* attended the hearing on behalf of the Respondent. Also present on behalf of the Respondent were Ms. Liliana Campomanes from CEARINSA *(Comisi\u00f3n de Estudio de Arbitrajes Internacionales de la Provincia de Santa Fe),* Mr. Carlos Reyna from the *Ente Regulador de Servicios Sanitarios de la Provincia de Santa Fe* and Mr. F\u00e9lix L\u00f3pez Amaya, of the *Fiscal\u00eda de Estado of the Province of C\u00f3rdoba.* During the hearing Messrs. Blackaby and Paradell addressed the Tribunal on behalf of the Claimants. Messrs. Barraguirre and Torterola addressed the Tribunal on behalf of the Argentine Republic. The Tribunal posed questions to the parties, as provided in Rule 32(3) of the Arbitration Rules.\n\n14.\n\nFollowing the hearings on jurisdiction, the Respondent at various times filed unsolicited documents and arguments further contesting the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction. On each occasion, the Tribunal requested the Claimants views on these arguments and documents, and the Claimants totally rejected them each time. Finding that the Respondents had a full and complete opportunity to present their objections to jurisdiction in their memorial and oral arguments at the hearing on jurisdiction and finding further that the arguments presented in these unsolicited filings duplicated those that the Respondents had submitted in their oral arguments and memorial, the Tribunal by letter of March 24, 2006 requested the parties to refrain from making any new unsolicited submissions.\n\nE. *Petition for Participation as Amicus Curiae*\n------------------------------------------------\n\n15.\n\nOn 25 June 2005, a non-governmental organization, *Fundaci\u00f3n para el Desarrollo Sustentable,* based in Rosario in the Province of Santa Fe, and three individuals filed with the tribunal a *Petici\u00f3n de Participaci\u00f3n como Amicus Curiae* (Petition for Participation as *Amicus Curiae).* Following the filing of the *Petici\u00f3n,* the Tribunal invited the parties to make any observations they might have in this regard, and both parties submitted their views on this matter. On 17 March 2006 the Tribunal issued an *Order in Response to a Petition for Participation as Amicus Curiae* setting out the conditions under which the Tribunal would consider *amicus curiae* submissions.6 No such petition was ever fried.\n\nAvailable at ICSID\u2019s website icsid.worldbank.org. A similar request had previously been filed with the same tribunal by five non-governmental organizations (NGOs) in ICSID Case No. ARB/03/19. The Tribunal\u2019s *Order in Response to a Petition for Transparency and Participation as Amicus Curiae* in that case, of 19 May 2005, is available at icsid.worldbank.org.\n\nF. *Withdrawal of APSF as a Claimant*\n-------------------------------------\n\n16.\n\nBy letter of 11 January 2006, counsel for Claimants informed the Tribunal of the decision of APSF to withdraw its claim in case No. ARB/03/17. Upon invitation of the Tribunal, the Respondent fried its observations to this withdrawal by letter of 8 February 2006. The Respondent did not object to the withdrawal of APSF but requested that APSF provide copies of the minutes of the shareholders\u2019 meeting at which this decision was made. At the same time, Respondent advanced further arguments objecting to the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction and claiming that APSF\u2019s decision to withdraw somehow extinguished the claims of the other Claimants in this case. At the invitation of the Tribunal, counsel for APSF provided copies of the minutes of the APSF\u2019s shareholders\u2019 meeting of 4 May 2005 and of the APSF\u2019s board of directors\u2019 meeting of 10 January 2006, authorizing the discontinuance of its claim before this Tribunal. At the same time, counsel for the Claimants rejected each of the Respondent\u2019s arguments challenging the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction with respect to the other Claimants. The Tribunal provided copies of these documents to the Respondent and requested its observation concerning APSF\u2019s withdrawal.\n\n17.\n\nBy letter of 31 March 2006, the Respondent informed the Tribunal that \"... the Argentine Republic does not oppose the proposed cessation by the Concessionaire... APSF...\" in ICSID arbitration ARB/03/17 (\"... *la Rep\u00fablica Argentina no se opone al desistimiento planteado por la[s] Conce sionaria[s] APSF..\"),* but argued that such withdrawal had legal consequences with respect to the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction over the shareholder Claimants and their claims.\n\n18.\n\nIn its deliberations on this request, the Tribunal found that neither the ICSID Convention nor the Rules specifically provided for the withdrawal of one party from an arbitration proceeding which is to continue thereafter. ICSID Arbitration Rule 44, the provision of closest relevance to the action requested by the Claimant APSF, allows the discontinuation of an arbitration proceeding at the request of a party when the other party does not object. But Arbitration Rule 44 by a strict reading of its terms does not apply to the withdrawal of a single party. Nonetheless, the Tribunal, relying on Article 44 of the ICSID Convention, which grants ICSID tribunals the power to decide procedural questions not covered by the Convention or the Rules, concluded that it had the power to order the discontinuance of proceedings with respect to one party at its request when the other party did not object. The Tribunal found that permitting such discontinuance in this case was in accordance with the basic objective of the ICSID Convention of facilitating the settlement of investment disputes, of which ICSID Arbitration Rule 44 is a specific manifestation. It also was of the view that the continued participation of APSF in this proceeding would serve no useful purpose in bringing about a fair and correct resolution of the present arbitration.\n\n19.\n\nOn 14 April 2006, the Tribunal therefore entered Procedural Order No. 1 *Concerning the Discontinuance of Proceedings with Respect to Aguas Provinciales de Santa Fe S.A.*, directing that: (i) the proceedings in ICSID Case No. ARB/03/17 with respect to the Claimant APSF be discontinued and that the said Claimant APSF cease to be a party with effect from 14 April 2006; and (ii) that the proceedings in ICSID Case No ARB/03/17 continue in all other respects. With respect to the Respondent\u2019s arguments that the withdrawal of APSF from the case had implications for the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction over the shareholder Claimants and their claims, the Tribunal concluded that these objections were more appropriately addressed in its decision on jurisdiction.\n\nG. *The Tribunal\u2019s Decision on Jurisdiction*\n--------------------------------------------\n\n20.\n\nAfter having considered each and every jurisdictional objection raised by the Respondent, the Tribunal rejected them all, except for the fourth objection based on the status of APSF as an Argentine corporation, which objection had become moot because of the discontinuance of the proceedings in the case with respect to APSF. In its Decision on Jurisdiction of 16 May 2006,7 the Tribunal thus decided that ICSID and this Tribunal had jurisdiction over ICSID case No. ARB/03/17. The Tribunal therefore directed the case to proceed on the merits in accordance with the ICSID Convention, the ICSID Rules, and the applicable bilateral investment treaties. The Tribunal accordingly made the necessary Order for the continuation of the procedure pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule 41(4). Subsequently, with the consultation of the parties, the Tribunal scheduled dates for a hearing on the merits.\n\nAvailable at icsid.worldbank.org.\n\nH. *Hearing on the Merits*\n--------------------------\n\n21.\n\nA hearing on the merits took place from 28 May 2007 through 1 June 2007 at the seat of the Centre in Washington, D.C. Each side in the case presented a number of witnesses for examination by the other side and questions from the Tribunal. Mr. Nigel Blackaby, Mr. Lluis Paradell and Ms. Noiana Marigo from Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer LLP; Mr. Bernardo Iriberri, from Estudio Cardenas, Di Ci\u00f3, Romero, Tarsitano & Lucero, Abogados in Buenos Aires; Mr. Julio Durand from Estudio Cassagne, Abogados in Buenos Aires; Ms. Maria Victoria Stratta, from Estudio Jur\u00eddico Stratta in Buenos Aires, Mr. Jean-Marie Guvain, Ms. Isabelle Froment-Meurice and Mr. Jean Bernard Lemire from Suez Environment; Mr. Miquel Gri\u00f1o, from AGBAR attended the hearing on behalf of the Claimants. Messrs. Adolfo Gustavo Scrinzi, Jos\u00e9 Luis Cassinerio, Jorge Barraguirre, Fabi\u00e1n Rosales Markaida, Mauricio D\u2019alessandro Longhin, Alejandro Turyn, Facundo Perez Aznar, Diego Gosis Nicolas Grosse, Javier Pargament, and Carlos Winograd and Ms. Adriana Busto, Ms. Mercedes Balado and Ms. Alejandra Mackluf, from the *Procuraci\u00f3n del Tesoro de la Naci\u00f3n Argentina,* Mr. Ignacio Torterola, from the Embassy of the Argentine Republic in Washington D.C., and Mr. Francisco Iturraspe and Ms. Liliana Campomanes, from *Fiscal\u00eda del Estado* of the Province of Santa Fe, attended the hearing on behalf of the Respondent. The Tribunal posed questions to the parties, as provided in Rule 32(3) of the Arbitration Rules. At the end of the hearing, the Tribunal directed the parties to simultaneously file post-hearing briefs by 6 July 2007.\n\nI. *Respondent\u2019s First Arbitrator Challenge*\n--------------------------------------------\n\n22.\n\nOn 12 October 2007, after the filing of post-hearing submissions by both parties, the Respondent filed with the Secretary of the Tribunal a Proposal pursuant to Article 57 of the Convention and Rule 9 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules to disqualify Professor Gabrielle Kaufmann-Kohler as a member of the Tribunal \"...by virtue of the objective existence of justified doubts with respect to her impartiality.\" (para. 1) (\"... *en virtud de la existencia objetiva de dudas justificadas respecto de su imparcialidad\u2019* \u2019). The alleged basis for this request arose out of the fact that Professor Kaufmann-Kohler had been a member of an ICSID tribunal in the case of *Compa\u00f1\u00eda de Aguas del Aconquija S.A. and Vivendi Universal S.A. v. Argentine Republic,*8 which had rendered an award against Argentina on 20 August 2007.\n\n*Compa\u00f1\u00eda de Aguas del Aconquija S.A. and Vivendi Universal S.A v. Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/97/3); hereinafter \"Vivendi II.\"\n\n23.\n\nOnce the Tribunal became aware of the Respondent\u2019s Proposal, Professor Kaufmann-Kohler immediately withdrew from Tribunal deliberations, and the two remaining Tribunal members suspended proceedings in the three cases pending before it on 15 October 2007, forwarded the Respondent\u2019s Proposal to the Claimants with a request for their observations, and invited Professor Kaufmann-Kohler to furnish any explanations that she wished to make. After receiving submissions from the parties and from Professor Kaufmann-Kohler, the two remaining members of the Tribunal deliberated and, on 22 October 2007, made a *Decision on the Proposal for the Disqualification of a Member of the Tribunal,9* rejecting the Respondent\u2019s Proposal and directing that the state of suspension of the proceedings be terminated.\n\nAvailable at icsid.worldbank.org.\n\nJ. *Respondent\u2019s Second Arbitrator Challenge*\n---------------------------------------------\n\n24.\n\nOn 29 November 2007, the Respondent fried with the Tribunal a second Proposal to disqualify Professor Kaufmann-Kohler (hereinafter \"Respondent\u2019s Second Proposal\") under Article 57 of the Convention and Rule 9 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules \"...on the basis that Professor Kaufmann-Kohler does not meet the conditions required to be an arbitrator in the above mentioned proceedings, pursuant to the provisions set forth in Article 14(1) of the ICSID Convention.\" Specifically, the Respondent alleged that \"... Mrs. Kaufmann-Kohler cannot be \u2018relied upon to exercise independent judgment,\u2019... since [she] holds the position of Director of the UBS group...\", which held shares in Suez and engaged in certain other activities relating to the international water sector. Moreover, the Respondent asserted that Professor Kaufmann-Kohler failed to disclose this fact to the parties and to ICSID as is required by the ICSID Arbitration Rules. The Respondent\u2019s Second Proposal also extended to two other ICSID cases, not subject to the jurisdiction of this Tribunal, in which Professor Kaufmann-Kohler is also serving as an arbitrator.10\n\n*Electricidad Argentina S.A. and EDF International SA. v. Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/03/22) and *EDF International S.A., SAUR International SA. and Le\u00f3n Participaciones Argentinas S.A. v. Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/03/23).\n\n25.\n\nOn receipt by the Tribunal of the Respondent\u2019s Second Proposal, Professor Kaufmann-Kohler withdrew from Tribunal deliberations, and the two remaining members suspended the proceedings on 4 December 2007, forwarded the Respondent\u2019s Second Proposal to the Claimants with a request for their observations, and invited Professor Kaufmann-Kohler to furnish any explanations that she wished to make.\n\n26.\n\nAfter receiving an explanation from Professor Kaufmann-Kohler and an exchange of observations on the matter from the parties, the remaining members of the Tribunal in a Decision dated May 12, 200811 determined that Professor Kaufmann-Kohler\u2019s position as a non-executive director of UBS did not affect her independence as an arbitrator in the above-entitled case and that she had no obligation to disclose her UBS directorship to the parties or to the Tribunal, thus terminating the suspension of the present case.\n\nDecision on a Second Proposal for the Disqualification of a Member of the Arbitral Tribunal of 12 May 2008.\n\n27.\n\nThe Tribunal has now considered and deliberated upon the parties\u2019 various written submissions and the oral arguments presented during the course of the hearing on the merits. Having considered the relevant facts and evidence, the ICSID Convention, the Argentina-France BIT, the Argentina-Spain BIT, as well as the written and oral submissions of the parties\u2019 representatives, the Tribunal has reached the following decision.\n\n**II The Facts of This Case**\n-----------------------------\n\nA. *Background*\n---------------\n\n28.\n\nThis investment dispute arises out of the privatization of the water and waste water services in the Province of Santa Fe, Argentina. To accomplish the privatization, the Provincial authorities granted a Concession to an entity, Aguas Provinciales de Santa Fe S.A. (APSF), organized and managed by the Claimants, all of whom had significant interests and experience in the water business. The Respondent is a federal republic consisting of the autonomous city of Buenos Aires and twenty-three provinces, one of which is the Province of Santa Fe, located in the north of the country.\n\n29.\n\nPrior to the granting of the Concession in this case, the provision of water and waste water services in Argentina had been the responsibility of state-owned and managed entities. From 1912 until 1980, *Obras Sanitarias de la Naci\u00f3n* (OSN), an entity owned and operated by the federal government, provided water and sewage services throughout most of the territory of Argentina. In 1980, the government of Argentina decentralized water and sewage services, transferring these functions to provincial authorities. From 1980 until 1995, the Province of Santa Fe, through its *Direcci\u00f3n Provincial de Obras Sanitarias* (DIPOS), a provincially-owned entity, had the responsibility of providing water and waste water services to the principal urban areas in the Province.\n\n30.\n\nDuring the 1980s, the Argentine economy and particularly the country\u2019s public enterprises suffered severe problems. Argentina experienced extremely high inflation, steep budgetary and fiscal deficits, a serious lack of investment capital, and no less than four currency crises, each resulting in a currency devaluation of over 90%. Its public enterprises, such as DIPOS, also ran large deficits, suffered from under-investment in their plants and services, and in general were not managed efficiently. With respect to DIPOS, the result of this situation was the deterioration in the quality of water and sewage services provided to the public, and the inability to expand the service to all inhabitants of the area, a situation that raised significant public concern.\n\nB. *The Privatization of the Santa Fe Water and Sewage Systems*\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\n31.\n\nTo address the situation at a national level, in 1989 Argentina enacted the State Reform Law,12 which declared the country\u2019s public services to be in a state of emergency and proposed to launch a broad program of privatization to remedy the situation, by which the Argentine government would transfer the assets, operations, and functions of various designated State-owned companies and entities to private and primarily foreign investors in accordance with certain specified legal arrangements. The State Reform Law also invited the country\u2019s provinces to participate in the privatization process. Subsequently, Argentina took certain other measures attractive for private and foreign investment to its territory. Less than two years after the State Reform Law, Argentina adopted the Convertibility Law by which it tied or \"pegged\" the value of the Argentine Peso to the United States Dollar and established a currency board requiring that the amount of Argentine currency in circulation be equivalent to the foreign currency reserves held by the State.13 Starting in 1990, it also began to conclude bilateral treaties \"for the reciprocal promotion and protection of investments\" with various countries. By the year 2000, it had concluded 57 such bilateral investment treaties, commonly known as BITs, including the July 1991 Argentina-France BIT, and the October 1991 Argentina-Spain BIT, under which the Claimants assert various rights in this case.\n\nLaw No. 23,696 of 18 August 1989 (the State Reform Law).\n\nLaw No. 23,928 of 27 March 1991.\n\n32.\n\nIn 1989, almost immediately after the federal government had launched its privatization program, the Province of Santa Fe took measures to facilitate the privatization of certain provincial services and entities. Accordingly, Santa Fe adopted its own Emergency and State Reform Law14 which designated the specific services and entities to be privatized and defined the rules by which the privatization would be conducted. The general approach was to enact specific laws for each entity to be privatized. The Santa Fe Emergency and State Reform Law listed DIPOS as one of the provincial entities to be privatized\n\nLaw No. 10,472, as amended by Law No. 10,798 of 22 January 1990\n\n33.\n\nDespite this measure, the Province of Santa Fe would not actually privatize its water and sewage services for over six years. In order to give impetus to the privatization project, in January 1994 it selected two international consulting firms, William Halcrow & Partners Ltd. and Grupo Consultor Interbonos Capital Markets S.A., to advise it on the economic and technical aspects of water and sewage privatization. Subsequently, in November 1994, the Province enacted Law No. 11,220, known as the *Santa Fe Water Law,* to govern the privatization by concession of the water distribution and waste water services in the Province. This law provided for an international bidding procedure to enable private investors to obtain a thirty-year concession for the operation and development of specified water and waste water systems in the province. A model contract, annexed to the bidding rules, specified certain provisions governing the financial aspects of the proposed concession, including the tariff regime, investment commitments, and financial guarantees. The Province, in cooperation with the federal authorities, actively publicized its desire to privatize these systems, preparing and distributing a prospectus aimed at private investors, both foreign and national.15 Throughout the process, various international institutions, particularly the World Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank, strongly supported Argentina\u2019s privatization program with advice, financing, and encouragement.\n\nThe \"Information Memorandum,\" Claimants\u2019 Exh. C-28.\n\nC. *The Selection of the Claimants\u2019 Consortium as Concessionaire*\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n34.\n\nIn response to these measures, Claimants Suez (then known as Lyonnaise des Eaux) and AGBAR, together with Argentine companies Banco de Galicia y Buenos Aires S. A., Sociedad Comercial del Plata S.A., and Meller S. A., formed a consortium in January 1995 to participate in the bidding for the concession to operate specified water distribution and waste water systems in the Province of Santa Fe. Claimant InterAgua was not a member of the bidding consortium. It would subsequently acquire 9.47 % of APSF shares in 1996 and additional 5.45% in 1998.\n\n35.\n\nOn 30 August 1995, the Province of Santa Fe awarded this consortium the Concession by Decree No. 2141/95. Claimants Suez and AGBAR were also members of the consortium that had been awarded the concession to operate the water and sewage system of Buenos Aires in 1993. The Buenos Aires consortium would also result in an investment dispute subject to ICSID arbitration over which the present Tribunal also has jurisdiction and in which Suez and AGBAR are claimants.\n\n36.\n\nPursuant to the Santa Fe bidding rules, the consortium formed on 8 November 1995 an Argentine company, Aguas Provinciales de Santa Fe S.A. (APSF), to hold and operate the Concession. On 27 November 1995, APSF formally concluded a thirty-year Concession Contract with the Province, and on 5 December 1995 assumed control and management of the water distribution and waste water systems in the fifteen most important urban areas in the Province of Santa Fe. The Concession Contract, which will be discussed at length below in the Tribunal\u2019s consideration of the Concession\u2019s legal framework, not only specified the tariff regime but also mandated service quality standards and expansion and investment goals that the Concessionaire was required to meet. Pursuant to the Concession Contract, the Concessionaire did not own the assets of the water and sewage service it was to manage and develop, nor its investments in them, and it was required at the end of the Concession to return the service to the Argentine State in good operating condition. Following the legal requirements, Claimant Suez was designated as the operator of the Concession, for which it was to receive a management fee, and its rights and responsibilities in that capacity were defined in a Management Contract annexed to the Concession Contract.\n\nD. *The First Six Years of Operation (1995-2001)*\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n37.\n\nDue to the poor state of the water and sewage system subject to the Concession, the Concessionaire was obligated under the Concession Contract to undertake major investments for expansion and improvement. The investment requirements exceeded the amounts that might be gained immediately from tariff revenues; consequently, the Concessionaire sought loans from local and international sources, primarily from multilateral lending agencies whose loans were denominated and payable in U.S. dollars. The multilateral agencies required as a condition for lending that the shareholders in APSF promise to provide financial support to APSF in the event it was unable to make scheduled payments under the loans. In addition, the consortium members were required to secure a bank guarantee in favor of the Provincial Government to guarantee their promised performance and investments under the consortium. According to the Claimants\u2019 Memorial on the Merits, by 31 December 2001, APSF had invested a total of US$257.7 million in the Concession, consisting of US$60 million in APSF\u2019s initial capital, US$67.3 million of cash flows generated by APSF, and US$130.4 million primarily from the international loans provided by multilateral lending agencies.16\n\nClaimants\u2019 Memorial, para. 161.\n\n38.\n\nIn pursuit of agreed upon plans, APSF began to expand the service network. As a result of these investments, substantial improvement and expansion of the water distribution and sewage systems appears to have taken place. Evidence offered by the Claimants and not challenged by the Respondent indicates that between 1995, when APSF assumed the Concession, and 2000 the population with access to drinking water increased from 1,600,000 persons to 1,809,000 persons (an increase of 13%) and the population with access to sewage services increased from 865,000 persons to 1,234,000 persons (an increase of 43%). Moreover during that same period, the production of drinking water increased from 469,000 cubic meters a day to 860,000 cubic meters a day (an increase of 73%), the sewage treatment capacity increased from 9,300 cubic meters a day to 37,925 cubic meters a day (an increase of 308%), and installed water meters increased from approximately 20,000 to 80,000 (an increase of 300%). It would therefore seem that as a result of the Concession the Province achieved at least some of the goals that it had sought in undertaking the privatization of the provincial water and waste water treatment systems. Although the Respondent made various allegations at the hearing on the merits concerning APSF\u2019s poor performance, it does not appear from the evidence that the Provincial authorities raised serious performance issues with APSF during the first six years of the Concession. Indeed, the Governor of the Province, in a speech to the provincial legislature, praised the privatization of water services as \"...inevitable and turned out to be positive...\", noting that the investments by APSF in the period 1995-2000 was US$250 million, an increase of 620% over the $40 million investment by the Province during 1990-1995 and that \"all investment made became part of the assets of the Province.\"17\n\nGovernor\u2019s speech to the provincial legislature, 1 May 2000, Claimants\u2019 Hearing Exh. H-A-8.\n\n39.\n\nAs APSF expanded service to new customers, it would require them to pay an \"infrastructure charge,\" as permitted by the Concession regulatory framework, to defray the costs of connection to the service. This charge generated significant negative public reaction. As a result, the Province by letter of 15 April 1997 requested APSF to suspend the invoicing of infrastructure charges to consumers, and, at the same time, asked APSF to temporarily cease expansion works. The Province and APSF almost immediately entered into negotiations to resolve this problem. Ultimately, in April 1999, APSF and the Province made an agreement providing for cross-subsidization whereby all users would contribute to finance the costs of expansion and the individual infrastructure charge would be reduced, a solution that was embodied in Law 11,665 of 28 April 1999.\n\nE. *The Argentine Financial Crisis (2001-2003)*\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n40.\n\nIn 1999, the Argentine Republic began to experience a severe economic and financial crisis that had serious consequences for the country, its people, and its investors, both foreign and national. In response to this continuing crisis, the government adopted a variety of measures to deal with its effects in the following years. The early manifestation of this impending crisis was the increasing difficulty that Argentina was experiencing in paying its foreign debts. The government\u2019s early response to this situation was the institution of an austerity program that tightened fiscal policies, reduced public spending, and raised taxes. These measures did not reverse the deteriorating situation, which had a negative impact on the economy of the Province and the finances of APSF.\n\n41.\n\nTo confront this situation, APSF and the Provincial authorities engaged in a series of negotiations with respect to the tariffs to be permitted under the Concession and APSF\u2019s investment obligations. As a first step, the Province of Santa Fe and APSF agreed to open formal negotiations with a view to preserving the financial equilibrium of the Concession, while instituting transitory measures to assist underprivileged users of the service. By Decree No. 1691/00 of 14 June 2000, the Province formally launched a renegotiation to adjust the tariff regime in view of the new economic circumstances facing the Province. The results of this process were three *'Adas\"* or agreements. The first of these was *Acta I,* signed 25 August 2000, creating a social or subsidized tariff for low-income consumers. The second, *Acta II,* signed 6 December 2000, provided for a methodology to calculate the economic and financial equilibrium of the Concession. *Acta II* was then send for comments to ENRESS, the provincial regulatory authority. As a result of ENRESS\u2019s comments, certain changes were made in the agreement which in modified form became *Acta III,* signed on 20 December 2000. In March 2001, the Provincial Minister of Public Works transferred **Acta III** to the Provincial Governor for his signature, but **Acta III** was never approved by the Governor.\n\n42.\n\nIn the meanwhile, as the crisis deepened at the end of 2001 and the beginning of 2002, the Argentine national government adopted a series of measures of increasing severity. In December 2001, it enacted Decree No 1570/01 of 3 December 2001, which imposed a \"corralito\" or \"little fence\" upon bank accounts, limiting the amounts of cash withdrawals by account holders. The resulting negative public reaction and disturbances prompted by this measure forced then President de la Rua to resign on 20 December. There followed in succession the appointment of four presidents during the following ten days until the election of President Eduardo Duhalde who would serve out the remainder of the presidential term, which lasted until the end of 2003.\n\nF. *Attempts to Renegotiate the Concession*\n-------------------------------------------\n\n43.\n\nUnder President Duhalde, Argentina enacted a series of emergency legislative measures that to a significant extent repealed or modified previously important provisions of Argentine law. One of the most important of these was the Emergency Faw18 No. 25,561 of 6 January 2002, which: i) abolished the currency board that had linked the Argentine Peso to the U.S.. dollar, resulting in a significant depreciation of the Argentine Peso; ii) abolished the adjustment of public service contracts according to agreed upon indexations; and iii) authorized the Executive branch of government to renegotiate all public service contracts. Under Article 9 of the Law, the renegotiation of public service contracts was to take account of the following criteria: 1) the impact of tariffs on economic competiveness and income distribution; 2) the quality of service and investment plans; 3) the interests of the consumers and the accessibility of services; 4) the safety of the system; and 5) the profitability of the enterprises. Article 10 stated that in no case were the provisions of the Law to authorize a suspension or alteration of the contractual obligations incurred by the affected public services.\n\nLaw No. 25,561 *(Ley de Emergencia P\u00fablica y de Reforma del R\u00e9gimen Cambiario)* of 6 January 2002. (the \"Emergency Law\") Exh. C-78.\n\n44.\n\nThe effect of the depreciation of the Peso, which would eventually fall to 3 Argentine Pesos to one U.S.. Dollar, was to substantially increase APSF\u2019s costs, especially those arising from its obligations to service its dollar-denominated foreign loans. Claiming that the government\u2019s measures destroyed the profitability of their investments in violation of the commitments made to them in securing the Concession, the Claimants in January 2002 sought to obtain from the provincial government adjustments in the tariffs that APSF could charge for water distribution and waste water services, as well as modifications of other operating conditions.19 On March 1, 2002, ENRESS formally rejected APSF\u2019s request for a tariff revision,20 and on the same day the Provincial authorities ordered a renegotiation of the Concession Contract.21\n\n*E.g.,* Letter from APSF to ENRESS, dated 10 January 2002, Exh. C-79; Letter from APSF to the Secretary of Public Services of the Province of Santa Fe, dated 15 January 2002, Exh. C-80; Letter from APSF to the Secretary of Public Works and Services, dated 17 January 2002, Exh. C-83.\n\nENRESS Resolution 55/02, dated 1 March 2002, Exh. C-89.\n\nDecree 221/02, dated 1 March 2002, Exh. C-90.\n\n45.\n\nIn May 2002, APSF defaulted on its foreign debt payment obligations. Because of their existing agreements with the multilateral lenders, the Claimants as shareholders of APSF were required to inject funds into the company to repay a portion of APSF\u2019s debts. Throughout the remainder of 2002, APSF persisted in seeking tariff revisions from the provincial authorities as means of returning its operations to profitability, but it had no success in this endeavor, while the Province continued to insist on a renegotiation of the Concession Contract.\n\n46.\n\nAfter a further period of fruitless negotiations, the Claimants submitted in April 2003 a Request for Arbitration of their dispute with the Argentine Republic to ICSID under the ICSID Convention, pursuant to the Argentina-France and the Argentina-Spain BITs. In their subsequent Memorial of 20 September 2004, the Claimants alleged that the Argentine Republic was legally responsible under the above-mentioned BITs for the Province of Santa Fe\u2019s wrongful actions, which expropriated Claimants\u2019 investment in violation of Article 5(2) of the Argentina-France BIT and Article V of the Argentina-Spain BIT, and which failed to treat Claimants\u2019 investment fairly and equitably in breach of Article 3 and 5(1) of the Argentina-France BIT and Article IV(1) of the Argentina-Spain BIT. As a result, pursuant to both BITs, Claimants sought compensation for their alleged loss. At that time, the Claimants in this case consisted of APSF, the concession company, and three of its non-Argentine shareholders: Suez, a French company holding 51.69% of APSF shares; AGBAR, a Spanish Company holding 10.89% of APSF shares, and InterAgua, a Spanish company holding 14.92% of APSF shares.22\n\nClaimants\u2019Memorial, para. 41\n\n47.\n\nFurther negotiations continued thereafter between APSF and the Province for the next two years without result. In general, APSF insisted on a tariff revision in accordance with the terms of the Concession Contract to account for the devaluation of the country\u2019s currency and the significant cost increases incurred in the operation of the Concession situation; however, the Provincial government resisted any tariff revisions while insisting that APSF meet its investment and other commitments under the Concession Contract. In the meanwhile, as a result of APSF\u2019s default on its foreign loans, the Claimants, as shareholders of APSF who had entered into support agreements with the lenders as a condition for the loans, purchased a portion of the outstanding loans from international lenders. Economic conditions in the Province were further worsened by the occurrence of serious flooding in 2003 caused by unusually heavy rains.\n\n48.\n\nIn December 2003, a new provincial administration took office, and this event appears to have led to a new phase in the renegotiation process. Under the newly elected governor, the Provincial authorities became more adamant in their refusal to consider a tariff revision and increased their demands on APSF to augment their investments and to complete other onerous obligations. At the same time, the Governor expressed approval in the press for the idea that the Provincial water and water systems be renationalized. Also, the Province granted a 129% tariff increase to the provincially owned electricity company. Eventually, in late 2005, the Province proposed to APSF modest tariff increases but coupled them with substantially increased investment obligations. Judging this proposal as failing to provide a solution to APSF\u2019s financial problems, the Claimants sought to sell their shares for US$1 to local investors, but the Province refused to approve the transfer.\n\nG. *The Termination of the Concession*\n--------------------------------------\n\n49.\n\nIn a claimed state of insolvency, APSF issued a notice of termination of the Concession to the Santa Fe Provincial authorities on 16 March 2005 and proposed to transfer the service to the Province. On 29 April 2005, in response, the Ministry rejected the proposal.\n\n50.\n\nOn May 26, 2005, APSF notified the Province of its decision to terminate the Concession Contract and asked the Province to receive the water and waste water service that was subject to the Concession. The following day, the Province, by Decree No. 1024, declared that the Concession Contract remained in force and ordered the execution of the performance bonds that the Claimants\u2019 consortium had made at the time that APSF entered into the Concession Contract. In August 2005, the Province executed the performance bond. It nonetheless continued to reject any tariff adjustment and it also declined to receive the service. It also rejected APSF\u2019s request to sell its shares in APSF to a group of local investors.\n\n51.\n\nUltimately, on 13 January 2006, APSF entered into liquidation and asked the Province to retake the service within 5 days as provided in the Concession Contract.\n\n52.\n\nOn 31 January 2006, by Decree No. 243/06, the Province of Santa Fe terminated the Concession Contract because of the liquidation and the following week, on 8 February 2006, assumed operation of the water and sewage services that had been the subject of the APSF Concession Contract. Later in the year, by Resolution No. 513/06, the Provincial authorities confirmed that the Province would pay the Claimants no compensation and that the Province would also pursue claims against APSF shareholders for failure to fulfill APSF\u2019s obligations under the Concession Contract. In the meanwhile the Province created a new state company *Aguas Santafesinas S.A.* (ASSA), to operate the service previously entrusted to APSF. In 2006, according to one of the Respondent\u2019s witnesses, ASSA operated at a loss of 1,353 million Argentine Pesos. The Province provided subsidies to cover the operating loss and in addition furnished 42.3 million Argentine Pesos for new investments in the system.23\n\nTestimony of Ms. Belotti, Hearing Transcipt (Spanish) D4:P1169:L6-8, and D4:P1216:L4-18.\n\n53.\n\nAs a result of the Respondent\u2019s actions, the Claimants allege that they have lost their entire investment in APSF which, valued as of December 2006, amounted to US$199,370,699 in the case of Claimant Suez, US$35,113. 434 in the case of Claimant Agbar, and $19,177,028 in the case of Claimant Interagua.\n\n**III The Law Applicable to This Dispute**\n------------------------------------------\n\n54.\n\nArticle 42(1) of the ICSID Convention states the rule governing the applicable law that this tribunal is to follow in deciding this dispute. It provides: \"The Tribunal shall decide a dispute in accordance with such rules of law as may be agreed by the parties. In the absence of such agreement, the Tribunal shall apply the law of the Contracting State party to the dispute (including its rules on conflict of law) and such rules of international law as may be applicable.\"\n\n55.\n\nIn this case, the Claimants are asserting certain rights accorded to them by reason of individual bilateral investment treaties concluded by the Argentine Republic with the Claimants\u2019 respective home countries. Thus, Claimant Suez, incorporated in France, asserts rights under the Argentina-France BIT and Claimants AGBAR and InterAgua, both incorporated in Spain, claim rights under the Argentina-Spain BIT. The two treaties contain relatively similar provisions specifying the law that a tribunal is to apply in deciding a dispute arising there under. The governing laws specified in the treaties can be regarded as the \"rules of law agreed by the parties\" under Article 42(1) of the ICSID Convention. Indeed, when accepting to arbitrate under the terms of a treaty, the investor also accepts the choice of law provided in such treaty.\n\n56.\n\nThe purpose of both BITs is the promotion and protection of investments by investors of one Contracting State in the territory of the other Contracting State. They seek to achieve this purpose by defining the legal obligations under international law of each Contracting State toward the investments of investors from the other Contracting State with respect to their treatment of those investments. Following the pattern of hundreds of other BITs that have been concluded throughout the world, the BITs in question in the present case guarantee specific treatment to investors from other Contracting Parties, including protection from expropriation, fair and equitable treatment, and full protection and security, among others.\n\n57.\n\nWhile the rights of the parties under Argentine law were, according to the legal framework governing the Concession, to be judged by Argentine courts, the rights of the Claimants under the above-mentioned BITs are to be judged by this Tribunal. As this Tribunal emphasized in its Decision on Jurisdiction in this case, treaty claims under a BIT are separate and distinct from any contract claims that the Claimants may have under Argentine Law.24 This Tribunal has jurisdiction only to judge treaty claims, not contract claims. In judging those treaty claims, the tribunal must apply the law specified by such treaties.\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction, 16 May 2006, paras. 44-45.\n\n58.\n\nArticle 8.4 of the Argentina-France BIT provides: \"The ruling of the arbitral body shall be based on the provisions of this Agreement, the legislation of the Contracting Party which is a party to the dispute, including rules governing conflict of laws, the terms of any private agreements concluded on the subject of the investment, and the relevant principles of international law.\"\n\n59.\n\nArticle X(5) of the Argentina-Spain BIT provides: \"The arbitral tribunal shall make its decision on the basis of this Agreement and, where appropriate, on the basis of other treaties in force between the Parties, the domestic law of the Party in whose territory the investment was made, including its norms of private international law, and the general principles of international law.\"\n\n60.\n\nWhile the above quoted language lists the various legal sources from which a tribunal may draw in deciding an investor-State dispute arising under a specific BIT, it does not establish a hierarchy of norms to be followed by a tribunal. Nor does it determine how the individual listed elements are to relate one to another in the formulation of a tribunal decision. Those issues are to be determined by individual tribunals in deciding specific cases.\n\n61.\n\nThese provisions make clear that Argentine domestic law is applicable to the extent relevant, together with international law. In the present case, the provisions of the respective BITs are paramount, except where the treaty itself allows the application of domestic law or private agreements. The various Contracting Parties through bilateral investment treaties, which are solemn instruments of international law, have made specific commitments and promises to one another as to the treatment that they shall accord to investments of the other Contracting Party. In accordance with Article 27 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (VCLT), a party may not invoke the provisions of its internal law as justification for its failure to perform its treaty obligations. Thus, Argentina may not avoid its treaty commitments with respect to the treatment to be accorded the Claimants by invoking the provisions of its internal laws, regulations, or administrative acts.\n\n62.\n\nThe question that the Tribunal must answer is whether Argentina\u2019s treatment of the Claimants through its legislation, regulations, and administrative actions violated its commitments under the BITs. In order to assess such treatment, for example Argentina\u2019s actions to deal with its financial crisis, the Tribunal must make reference to and analyze Argentine law in order to judge whether those acts comply with or violate Argentina\u2019s international obligations under the BITs. But such internal legislation and regulations by themselves cannot legally override or modify Argentina\u2019s commitments and obligations in treaties to which it is a party.\n\n63.\n\nThe provisions of the Argentina-France BIT also allow for the application of the private and/or specific agreements concluded in relation to investments, which certainly includes the Concession Contract. However, claims for breach of the Concession Contract are not within the jurisdiction of the Tribunal, whose jurisdiction is limited to claims arising under the BITs. In assessing these latter claims, the Tribunal will therefore resort primarily to the text of the BITs themselves as well as to any relevant rules of international law. But it may also refer to domestic laws or to the provisions of the Concession Contract relevant for the evaluation of the claims arising under the BITs, for instance as a reflection of the Claimants\u2019 expectations. It must be noted, in this connection, that not every breach of the domestic regulatory framework may amount to a breach of any of the applicable BITs.25\n\n*Elettronica Sicula SpA (ELSI), ICJ Reports 1989,* p. 15 at p. 51 73; *El Paso Energy* *International Company v. Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/03/15), Decision on Jurisdiction (26 April 2006), para. 168.\n\n**IV The Legal Framework of the APSF Concession**\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n64.\n\nAn analysis of this investment dispute must begin with an understanding of the legal framework of the Concession granted to APSF, the company created by the Claimants, since that framework is an important source of the rights, obligations, and expectations of the parties to the dispute. Moreover, the Concession Contract at the heart of this dispute expressly provides that certain legal rules, notably those of the Santa Fe Water Law and the Concession Bidding Rules, to be discussed below, take precedence over the terms of the Concession Contract itself. Thus, Article 1.9 of the Concession Contract states that the rules applicable to the Concession are, in order or precedence, 1) the Santa Fe Water Law (Law 11,220), 2) the Bidding Rules *(El Pliego),* with its annexes and clarifying and modifying resolutions and circulars, 3) the offer submitted by the winning bidder in the tender, 4) the Concession Contract, and 5) the rules set down by the Regulatory Entity created by the Santa Fe Water Law and other regulations that might be issued in the future.26 We therefore shall now proceed to examine briefly the various individual elements of that legal framework as it existed under Argentine law. One may group the elements of the legal framework into two parts: 1) the legislative and regulatory measures establishing the legal framework; and 2) the Concession Contract between the Province of Santa Fe and APSF. The Argentina-France BIT and the Argentina-Spain BIT, which form an important part of the international legal framework of this dispute, will be considered in subsequent sections of this decision.\n\nArticle 1.9 of the Concession Contract (Exh. C-49):  \n \"Las normas aplicables a la Concesi\u00f3n ser\u00e1n, en el orden de prelaci\u00f3n que se indica:  \n 1.9.1 La Ley 11,220.  \n 1.92 El Pliego, sus anexos, y las resoluciones y circulares aclaratorias y modificatorias del mismo.  \n 1.9.3 La Oferta.  \n 1.9.4 El Contrato.  \n 1.9.5 Las normas que dicte El Ente Regulador y otras normas reglamentarias que en el futuro se dicten.\"\n\nA. *Legislative and Regulatory Measures*\n----------------------------------------\n\n65.\n\n**The State Reform Law.** The legal impetus and foundation for the Concession that is the subject of this case was **Law No. 23,696** ***(Ley de Emergencia Administrativa y Reforma del Estado)*** **of 23 August 1989,27** an act of the Argentine State declaring public services and enterprises to be in a state of emergency (Art. 1) and authorizing the Argentine President, referred to in the text as the National Executive Power *(Poder Ejecutivo Nacional),* to take specified remedial actions, particularly the privatization of State enterprises by various means, including the granting of concessions to private and foreign investors and to enterprises to operate individual public services (Art. 17). This law did not directly affect the water and sewage services of Santa Fe, which remained under provincial authority, but it did invite the provinces to \"adhere to the regime of the present law\"28 and thus engage in its own privatization process.\n\nExh. C-5.\n\nArticle 68, State Reform Law.\n\n66.\n\n**The Santa Fe Reform Law.** Within a few months of the enactment of the State Reform Law, the Province of Santa Fe enacted its own Emergency and State Reform Law (Law No. 10,472, dated 22 January 1990, as amended by Law No. 10798, dated 30 January 1992)29 by which the Province \"adhered\" to the principles and norms of the State Reform Law and specifically authorized the transformation or privatization of certain provincial services and works, including DIPOS. The Santa Fe Reform Law also stated that specific laws would provide for the transformation or privatization of each specified provincial entity.30\n\nExhs. C-6 and C-13 to Claimants\u2019 Memorial.\n\nArticles 29 and 30.\n\n67.\n\n**The Convertibility Law.** Although Argentina and the Province had thus initiated a privatization process, the envisioned regulatory framework was not to emerge for nearly five years. In the meanwhile, Argentina continued to experience severe inflation and monetary instability, factors which negatively affected the investment climate in the country. In an effort to curb inflation, Argentina, at the initiative of a new Minister of the Economy (Domingo Cavallo), enacted **Law No. 23,928** ***(Ley de la Convertibilidad del Austral)*** **of 28 March 1991.31** Known as the **\"Convertibility Law,\"** this legislative act, effective from 1 April 1991, basically did two things. First, under Article 1, the law tied or \"pegged\" the exchange rate of Argentine currency to the U.S.. dollar by guaranteeing that the Central Bank of Argentina would exchange a fixed amount of Argentine currency for a fixed amount of U.S.. dollars. At the time of its enactment, the law provided that the Central Bank would exchange 10,000 Argentine Australs for one U.S.. dollar. Shortly thereafter, **Decree No. 2128/91 of 17 October 199132** replaced the Austral with the Peso as the national currency, so that until the financial crisis of 2001 the Peso was pegged to the U.S.. dollar at a rate of one peso per dollar. Second, the Convertibility Law placed various limitations on the actions of the Central Bank in an effort to prevent it from increasing the monetary supply to meet internal government fiscal needs, which in the past had led to severe inflation in the country. Thus, the Convertibility Law required the Central Bank to hold an amount of dollars, gold, or foreign exchange at least equivalent to 100% of Argentina\u2019s domestic monetary base, the effect of which was to strictly limit the legal authority of the Central Bank to increase the supply of pesos, a limitation intended to reduce inflation and foster the monetary stability necessary to encourage investment. As these measures began to have effect and inflation in the country began to abate, work on the privatization program in various parts of the country accelerated.\n\nBolet\u00edn Oficial, 28 March 1991, p. 6 (Exh. C-12).\n\nExh. C-17.\n\n68.\n\n**Santa Fe Water Law.** Nearly five years would pass before the Province enacted a law to privatize DIPOS, the provincial entity charged with providing water and sewage services to the public. In November 1994, the provincial legislature enacted Law No. 11,220, dated 24 November 1994, (the Santa Fe Water Law), which authorized and defined the procedure and conditions for the privatization of the service that was then being provided by DIPOS. Its effect was to establish a legal framework for the Concession that is central to this case. The regulatory framework thus created had, according to Article 2 of the Water Law, five basic objectives: 1) to guarantee the maintenance and to promote the improvement and development of the service in the entire area of the Province of Santa Fe; 2) to establish legal rules that assure quality and efficiency levels in accordance with the nature of the Service; 3) to establish a legal framework which reconciles an effective and efficient provision of the service by the provider, with the adequate exercise of state faculties relating to the protection of public health, the well being of the population, the environment, and the natural resources in the Province of Santa Fe; 4) to protect the rights of consumers and reconcile the action, rights, and attributions of the regulatory authorities and the service providers; and 5) to safeguard the public health, the water resources, and the environment as specified in the law.\n\n69.\n\nIn order to achieve these objectives, the Water Law, which was divided into six basic \"Titles\" *(T\u00edtulos),* provided for the objectives, the nature and extent of the service and its area, (Title I), the transformation process of the service and particularly the dissolution of DIPOS and the creation of an independent governmental authority *Ente Regulador de Servicios Sanitarios,* (ENRESS), under the Ministry of Public Works, Public Services and Housing, to regulate the provision of water and waste water services in the province (Title II); the privatization process of water services by means of a concession (Title III); the creation of a regulatory framework for the provision of such services (Title IV); special rules to protect against the contamination of the environment and natural resources (Title V) and complementary rules (Title VI).\n\n70.\n\nAs a public service, the concessionaire and the water and sewage service were subject to the control of ENRESS, whose organization, duties, and powers were specified in Chapter IV of Title I of the Water Law.33 ENRESS was granted \"comprehensive police, regulatory, and control powers over the provisions of the service throughout the province of Santa Fe... and in particular to verify and control the fulfillment of the Concessionaire\u2019s obligations under the applicable rules.\"34 For purposes of this dispute, Titles III and IV have the greatest significance. We shall therefore focus on some of their principal provisions.\n\nArticles 19-31 of the Santa Fe Water Law.\n\nArticle 20 of the Santa Fe Water Law.\n\n71.\n\nTitle III defined the process by which the water services of the Province would be privatized. Article 33 of the Water Law authorized the Executive Power of the Province, the Governor, to a grant a public service concession for a period of thirty years in accordance with the provisions of the law. Toward this end, the law envisioned a public tender process which was to be conducted according to rules approved by the Executive Power. Article 34 stipulated a long list of elements that the contemplated \"Bidding Rules and Conditions\" *(Pliego de Bases y Condiciones)* were to encompass, including the minimum required investment, the parameters for the formulation of proposed tariffs, required guarantees for contract performance, the required experience of the operator of the concession, and the modalities of the concession contract. It provided for a three-step process for selecting the concessionaire, including 1) prequalification of the bidders and an evaluation of the technical aspects of their offers; 2) an analysis of the economic aspects of the offer and a preliminary decisions; and 3) a final decision *(adjudicaci\u00f3n)* on the award of the Concession.\n\n72.\n\nTitle IV of the Santa Fe Water Law defined the \"regulatory framework for the provision of the service\" *(marco regulatorio de la prestaci\u00f3n del servicio).* It stipulated that the service was to be provided in conditions that assure the continuity, regularity, quality, and generality in such a way that it guaranteed an efficient supply to the consumers and the protection of the environment, the natural resources, and the health of the population. It then proceeded to specify in some detail various rules about the provision of service to particular types of consumers and in particular situations.\n\n73.\n\nENRESS had the responsibility to see that the Concessionaire conducted the water and sewage services in accordance with the rules of the legal and regulatory framework. Chapter III of Title IV of the Santa Fe Water Law defines in some detail the specific powers that ENRESS possesses to accomplish its task. In general, its regulatory powers were comprehensive and broad, and they included assuring the implementation of the regulatory framework, approving the tariff and pricing schedule of the service, approving the concessionaire\u2019s proposed improvement and development plans, investigating complaints of consumers, and assuring that the concessionaire complied with regulations governing the service, among others.\n\n74.\n\nChapter IV of the Santa Fe Water Law listed the responsibilities and obligations of the Concessionaire in operating the water and sewage system and also specified the procedure by which the Concession Contract with the Concessionaire was to be made.\n\n75.\n\nChapter V of the Water Law sought to provide for the legal protection of the users of the water and sewage services operated by the Concessionaire by defining the rights of both actual and potential users, including the right to service according to the provisions of the Water Law, the right to required levels of service quality, the right to make claims against the Concessionaire for inadequate service, and the right to bring complaints against the Concessionaire before the Regulatory Entity, among others.35 In order to give effect to complaints by users, the concessionaire would be required to maintain a Complaints Office *(Oficina de Reclamos)* staffed by competent persons and accessible to users.\n\nArticle 73 of the Santa Fe Water Law.\n\n76.\n\nService quality being an important goal of the Water Law, Chapter VI defined in general terms the quality obligations of the Concessionaire with respect to the operation of the service. The principal objective of the quality provisions of the Water Law was to assure the provision of adequate service with respect to population and area coverage, water quality, water pressure, continuity of service, minimal service interruptions, effective treatment of sewage effluents, and responsiveness to the needs of the users.36\n\nArticle 80 of the Santa Fe Water Law.\n\n77.\n\nThe principles of the tariff regime, an issue fundamental to this dispute, were set out in Chapter VII of Title IV, as well as in the Concession Contract. With respect to the price that the Concessionaire was entitled to charge consumers, Article 81(d) of the Santa Fe Water Law, on which Claimants rely, states the fundamental rule: \"The total invoicing by the each Provider for prices and tariffs must reflect the economic cost of an efficient service, including the achievement improvements, expansion plans, and profits, taking into account in all cases the terms of the concession or service provision.\"\n\n78.\n\nIn view of the fact that the Concession was to continue over thirty years, it was important and expected that the Water Law authorize the revision of tariffs in the light of changing circumstances. Article 88 did so in general terms, stating \"Modifications: The Tariff regime and the schedule of prices and tariffs shall be revised and modified in accordance with the applicable rules.\" This provision contained few specifics on either the process or the conditions justifying a tariff revision. Its function was a legislative authorization allowing such revisions. The applicable rules concerning the specifics of the tariff revision process were to be enunciated in the Bidding Rules and the Concession Contract, both of which will be discussed below. On the other hand, the Santa Fe Water Law was clear that tariff revisions were not to be used to protect the Concessionaire from decreased revenues attributable to commercial risks. The last sentence of Article 88 states: \"In no case will the revision be a means to compensate for results arising from business risk *(riesgo empresario)* or to validate inefficiencies in the provided Service.\"\n\n79.\n\nChapter VIII of Title IV of the Water Law concerned the principles governing payment for service. In general terms, the Concessionaire had the right and obligation to collect payment for services provided, and the Water Law imposed an obligation on users, including the State, its subdivisions, and state entities, to pay for services. If the Concessionaire were directed by the government to provide free or subsidized services to certain classes of consumers, then the entity making such orders was to pay for such service to those consumers.\n\n80.\n\nChapter IX deals with the preparation, approval, and implementation of plans for expanding and improving water and waste water service. The Water Law required that the applicable rules impose an obligation on the Concessionaire to improve and extend the service throughout the Province. In developing plans for this purpose, the Concessionaire was to consult with users, local authorities, and ENRESS. ENRESS approved all such plans and supervised their implementation by the Concessionaire, which had an obligation to implement approved plans.\n\n81.\n\nChapter X of the Water Law governed the Property Regime of the Concessionaires and other service providers. It applied to all property transferred to the Concessionaire, as well as to property that the Concessionaire later acquired or constructed for the purpose of meeting its obligations arising out of the Concession Contract, which became part of the service. Authorized service providers and Concessionaires were to administer them according to the applicable rules, but they would not own them. They also had an obligation to maintain and protect such property. At the end of the Concession, the Concessionaire was required to transfer to the State without charge, all property and assets used in the service in good condition *(buenas condiciones)* for use and operation.\n\n82.\n\nChapter XI treated the termination of the service providers\u2019 rights to operate the Service. According to the Water Law, such termination was to take place in three ways: 1) upon completion of the contractual period, 2) by recovery of the service *(rescate del Servicio)* by the provincial authorities, or 3) or for other reasons established by the \"Applicable Rules\" *(Normas Aplicables),* a term that presumably referred to the contemplated bidding rules and concession contracts. Contract rescission could only be effected by the \"competent authority with the intervention of ENRESS.\"\n\n83.\n\nChapter XII of Title IV established the \"sanction regime\" *(r\u00e9gimen sancionatorio)* applicable to Concessionaires, a means to ensure the service provider\u2019s respect of the rules governing the Concession. It provided that Concessionaires are subject to the permanent control and disciplinary power of ENRESS, which is to be exercised according to the Applicable Rules. Article 111 defined the disciplinary procedure and the rights of the Concessionaire or service provider during that process. Article 112 defined the types of sanctions that ENRESS might impose for rule violations, including warnings *(apercibimiento),* and preventive intervention *(intervenci\u00f3n cautelar),* whereby ENRESS might take over all or part of the Service in cases of extreme seriousness and urgency endangering the health of the population of the continuity of the provision of the Service.\n\n84.\n\nChapter XIII of Title IV dealt with dispute resolution, specifically those arising out of decisions of ENRESS and from complaints by consumers. ENRESS, in addition to acting to enforce the rules against service providers, had the authority to decide consumer complaints. ENRESS decisions, however, were subject to judicial review.\n\n85.\n\nThe final two titles in the Water Law concerned rules to protect of the environment and natural resources from contamination (Title V) and \"complementary rules\" *(\"normas complementarias\")* (Title VI).\n\n86.\n\n**The Bidding Rules.** To put in motion the required public international competitive bidding process to select a concessionaire, the Province of Santa Fe, by Decree 3927/94 dated 29 December 199437, enacted bidding rules to govern the procedure and conditions for selecting the Concessionaire to provide water and sewage service to the Province. Divided into eight chapters, the bidding rules contained twelve annexes dealing the details of important requirements as well as a model concession contract (Annex XII, *normas contractuales)* that was to be the basis of the Concession Contract between the eventual concessionaire and the Province.\n\nExh. C-36\n\n87.\n\nChapter 1 of the Bidding Rules provided for basic provisions of the proposed Concession, including its objective, period, basic applicable norms, definitions of important terms, and rules of interpretation, most of which were ultimately integrated directly and verbatim into the Concession Contract, to be discussed below.\n\n88.\n\nChapter 2 of the Bidding Rules defined the general procedure for the bidding and tendering process that was to determine the future concessionaire. It provided that the bidding was to consist of a \"triple envelope system\" *(el sistema de triple sobre).38* Subsequent Chapters of the Bidding Rules would define in detail the documentary and informational requirements for each envelope and the standards for evaluating them. The first envelope was to consist of a prequalification phase to determine whether an interested party had the necessary financial and technical qualifications. Only potential bidders that were judged to have such qualifications could participate in subsequent stages of the bidding. The second \"envelope\" was to consist of the technical aspects of the bid in which the bidder would specify the means and technology by which it proposed to carry out the concession. Finally, the third envelope in the bidding process addressed the financial and economic aspect of the bidder\u2019s proposal. A key element in this \"economic-financial offer\" was the cost of water to the consumer. Article 5.41 therefore required each bid to contain the price of a cubic meter of water, referred to as the \"Pq\" which would be maintained through the entire period of the Concession, but without prejudice to the provisions on tariff modifications contained in the various annexes.\n\nArticle 2.2, Bidding Rules\n\n89.\n\nIn the evaluation process, the economic-financial bids received were to be ranked in descending order, according to the least price proposed for a cubic meter of water.\n\n90.\n\nThe Bidding Rules further stipulated in some detail the nature of the documentation and information required to accompany the bid, the procedure by which the bid would be analyzed and evaluated, the method by which a decision would be made to decide on the winning bid, and the process for resolving any challenges to such decision. They also stipulated that the winning bidder must form a company *(sociedad anonima)* under Argentine law to enter into the concession contract and carry out the concession. To ensure the performance of its obligations under the contract, the concessionaire had to post a bank guarantee of US$50,000,000 in favor of the Province, and maintain such guarantee throughout the entire period of the concession. Similarly, the entity designated as operator of the concession had to establish a guarantee of US$10,000,000 to guarantee the performance of its operational duties under the Concession.\n\n91.\n\nThe Bidding Rules specified the provisions to be included in the concession contract, particularly the obligations of the Concessionaire with regard to service quality, development and investment in the water and waste water system, relations with the ENRESS, the regulatory entity, studies and plans for the development of the system, five year investment plans, the property regime, the regimes governing concession property and personnel, and the tariff regimes. These principles were for the most part incorporated into the concession contract, usually verbatim, and will be discussed in detail below. Annexed to the Bidding Rules was a Model Concession Contract which embodied in contractual language the principles stated in the Bidding Rules. In particular, the Model Contract contained provisions concerning the revision of tariffs. It provided for two types of tariff revisions: 1) revisions because of increases in costs and 2) extraordinary revisions caused by specified economic factors. In deciding on revisions for increases in costs, the regulatory authority was to consider operating cost increases caused by changes in such factors as fuel, construction materials, and cost projections for investments. Extraordinary revisions could be prompted by changes in water quality rules, modification of the Argentine Peso-U.S. Dollar exchange rate, and the creation, substitution or modification of taxes.\n\nB. *The Concession Contract*\n----------------------------\n\n92.\n\n**The Concession Contract.** A lengthy and detailed document of over 100 pages, plus annexes, the Concession Contract between the Province of Santa Fe, represented by the Governor and referred to in the Concession Contract as \"the Conceding Authority\" (\"el Concedente\"), and Aguas Provinciales de Santa Fe S.A., referred to as \"the Concessionaire\" (\"el Concesionario\"), was signed on 27 November 1995. On 5 December 1995, APSF took possession of the conceded water and waste water systems in specified municipalities of the Province of Santa Fe. The Concession was to last for a minimum of thirty years, that is, until at least until the year 2025. The purpose of the Concession Contract was to specify the respective rights and responsibilities of the parties concerning the transfer, operation, and development of that system during the term of the Concession. As indicated above, the Concession by its terms was to be interpreted and applied within a stated hierarchy of legal norms set down in Article 1.9. These norms included: 1) Law No. 11,220 (the Santa Fe Water Law); 2) the Bidding Rules and their annexes and clarifying and modifying circulars, including the Model Contract; 3) the Offer presented by APSF during the bidding process; 4) the Concession Contract; and 5) the rules enacted by ENRESS and other regulatory rules that might be set down in the future.\n\n93.\n\nThe Concession Contract is divided into fifteen chapters and contains fifteen annexes. Chapter 1 on General Aspects states the purposes of the Concession, defines important terms used in the Contract, sets down rules of interpretation, and specifies the duration of the Concession as thirty years from the date of APSF\u2019s taking possession of the system with the possibility of extending it for further periods of time as provided in the Water Law and the Concession Contract itself. It is also to be noted that the Concession Contract states that the Concession is granted to APSF free of any required payment or \"canon\" by APSF.39 Many of the provisions in the Concession Contract are particularized versions of the principles stated in the Santa Fe Water Law and the Bidding Rules.\n\nArticle 1.7 of the Concession Contract.\n\n94.\n\nChapter 2 entitled \"The Concessionaire\" *(El Concesionario)* concerns the concessionary company and, as required by the Bidding Rules, established basic principles concerning its minimum capital (US$60,000,000), required its domicile to be the city of Santa Fe, and stated that the purpose of the company throughout the period of the Concession to be exclusively the performance of the Concession Contract. Moreover, it requires the Operator (then Lyonnaise des Eaux, now Suez) to hold 25% of the Company\u2019s capital, in addition to other rules affecting its shareholders. An annexed Management Contract governed the rights and responsibilities of the Operator.\n\n95.\n\nIn Chapter 3, the Concession Contract stated the service norms to be followed by APSF in carrying out the Concession. These norms dealt with the continuity, regularity, quality, and generality of service to be provided by the Concessionaire to the users. Specific provisions concerned area coverage of the systems, specified water pressure requirements, required water flow volumes, service cuts, waste water overflows, treatment of effluents, and required levels of customer relations.\n\n96.\n\nAs a public service, the Concession was subject to close regulation by the Regulatory Entity (ENRESS), and Chapter 4 of the Concession Contract sought to define the principles governing the relationship between the Concessionaire and the Regulatory Entity. As a general principle, the two parties were \"... to establish and maintain a fluid relationship that facilitates the performance of this Concession Contract.\"40 The Concessionaire by the terms of the Concession Contract had an obligation to cooperate with the Regulatory Entity, and the nature of that required cooperation was specified in some detail. At the same time, the Concession Contract required the Regulatory Entity to cooperate with the Concessionaire by among other things \"... exercising its police, regulatory, and control powers in a manner that does not interfere with the management of the Concessionaire.\"41\n\nArticle 4.1 of the Concession Contract.\n\nArticle 4.3 of the Concession Contract.\n\n97.\n\nThroughout the period of the Concession, the Concessionaire had an obligation to undertake studies, develop expansion and improvement plans, maintain records, and make information available on the details of the service it was providing. Chapter 5, entitled \"Studies, Plans and Reports\" *(Estudios, Planes, e Informes)* specified in detail the nature of the Concessionaire\u2019s obligations with respect to these matters. In particular, it had to prepare and execute the General Plan for Improvement and Development of the Service *(Plan General de Mejoras y Desarrollo Servicio),* known as a PGMDS, to guide the development of the water and waste water systems so as to meet the needs of the area served.\n\n98.\n\nThe fact that the Concessionaire was to be transferred the possession of an existing water and sewage system with its personnel for which it would have the responsibility for effective management, development, and expansion during a fixed period of time and further that it had the obligation to transfer that system back to the Province upon the termination of the Concession required special rules concerning the property and personnel of the system and any contracts made by the Concessionaire during the life of the Concession. Accordingly, Chapter 6 of the Concession Contract defines the rules governing the property regime *(r\u00e9gimen de bienes),* specifying the various categories of property subject to the Concession and the rules governing their acquisition, use, protection, amortization, and disposal. Among other things, it provided that at the end of the Concession the Concessionaire was to transfer without financial payment back to the Province all assets of the Concession, including those it had subsequently acquired or constructed.42 Chapter 7 on the Personnel Regime *(R\u00e9gimen de Personal)* governs basic rights of Concession employees. Chapter 8 on the Tax Regime *(R\u00e9gimen Tributario)* makes the Concessionaire liable for the payment of various taxes and government charges, while Chapter 9 on Contracts and Contracting Procedures *(Contratos y Procedimientos de Contrataci\u00f3n)* provided for a system by which the Concessionaire, a public service, is to make contracts with third parties\n\nArticle 6.8.2 of the Concession Contract.\n\n99.\n\nIn order to assure the performance of the Concession and the provision of the crucial public services it governs, the Concession Contract in Chapter 10 required the Concessionaire to establish a bank guarantee of US$50,000,000, subject to periodic readjustments on the basis of inflation and changes in investment plans, in favor of the Province of Santa Fe.43 Chapter 10 of the Concession Contract, entitled \"Guarantees and Insurance Regime\" *(\"R\u00e9gimen de Garant\u00edas y Seguros \"),* defined the nature of this guarantee, the contingencies and risks that it covered, and the conditions under which it might be executed. Chapter 10 also specified the type of insurance, primarily liability insurance, worker accident insurance, property damage, and life insurance, which the Concessionaire must maintain throughout the period of the Concession Contract.\n\nArticle 10.1.1 of the Concession Contract\n\n100.\n\nThe Concession Contract\u2019s provisions on tariffs, contained in Chapter 11 (\"Tariff Values, Prices, and Their Modifications\" *(Valores Tarifarios, Precios y sus Modificaciones),* as well as in Annex IX, are central to the present dispute between the parties. The first part of Chapter 11, and its related Annex IX, established the tariffs to be charged to users at the beginning of the Concession. Article 11.3 stipulates that such tariff shall remain in force throughout the period of the Concession, without prejudice to the application of Article 11.4 which concerned tariff revisions. Article 11.4 authorized and defined the procedures for revising tariffs by the Regulatory Entity. Under the Concession Contract, tariff revisions could not be used to penalize the Concessionaire for past profits earned nor might it be used to compensate the Concessionaire for losses arising out of business risks.44\n\nArticle 114.. 1.2 of the Concession Contract\n\n101.\n\nThe Concession Contract specifically stated in article 11.4.1.3: \"The Concession is based on the principle of business risk.\"45 However, the Concession Contract also provided for the possibility of a tariff revision on the happening of events that were deemed to be outside the control of the Concessionaire. The principal specified events justifying a tariff revision were 1) modifications of the investment plan, known as PGMDS; 2) changes in costs related to the operation of the Concession; 3) changes in quality standards required of the Concession; 4) changes in the Argentine Peso-U.S. Dollar exchange rate; 5) changes in taxes; and 6) changes in environmental legislation. In considering requests for tariff revisions, the Regulatory Authority was always to take into account the principles of Article 81 the Santa Fe Water Law,46 discussed above. A Tariff Revisions for Change in Costs was to take place whenever an increase or decrease of more than 4% occurred in the costs of a specified and exclusive list of elements needed in the operation of the Concession, as follows: fuel, chemical products, electricity, personnel, construction materials, and the exchange rate.47 Article 11.11.4.2 specifies the methods for calculating such increases or decreases in the cost of these items, usually by reference to particular indices. With respect to determining changes in costs due to exchange rate changes, the Concession Contract specifically states that applicable basis for such calculation is the Dollar-Peso parity fixed by Law No. 23,928.\n\n\"La Concesi\u00f3n est\u00e1 basada en el principio del riesgo empresario.\"\n\nArticle 11.4.1.5 of the Concession Contract.\n\nArticle 11.11.4.2 of the Concession Contract.\n\n102.\n\nThe Concession Contract also provides for \"Extraordinary Tariff Revisions\" on the happening of certain specified events in Article 11.4.5.1. These include changes in water quality standards, changes in norms for the protection of the environment, and most important for purposes of this case a \"modification of the convertibility relation in relation to the United States Dollar fixed by National Law No. 23,928.\"48 For both ordinary and extraordinary tariff revisions, the Concession Contract required the provincial authorities to make a decision within thirty days.49\n\nArticle 11.4.5.1 of the Concession Contract.\n\nArticle 11.4.6 of the Concession Contract.\n\n103.\n\nChapter 12 of the Concession Contract dealt with the obligations of the Concessionaire in providing service under the Concession, with non-performance, and resulting sanctions that may be imposed on the Concessionaire. Article 12.1 stated the basic nature of the Concessionaire\u2019s responsibility: the Concessionaire was to assume the Concession at its own technical, economic, and financial risk and was responsible to the Province and to third parties for the obligations and requirements from the beginning of the service as of the time it took possession. Neither the Conceding Authority *(i.e.* the Province) nor the Regulatory Entity was responsible to third persons for the obligations assumed by the Concessionaire. Failure to meet its obligations could result in one of two sanctions: warning *(apercibimiento)* or fines *(multas),* which the Regulatory Entity was empowered to impose.50 Chapter 12 defined the norms to be applied in judging and sanctioning the Concessionaire, the procedure to be followed, and the nature of warnings and fines to be imposed by the Regulatory Entity in particular cases.\n\nArticle 13.3 of the Concession Contract.\n\n104.\n\nChapter 13 concerned the Termination and Extension of the Concession *(Extinci\u00f3n y Pr\u00f3rroga de la Concesi\u00f3n).* Article 13.1 stated that termination of the Concession Contract may be caused by the expiration of the period of the Contract, cancellation due to the fault of the Concessionaire, cancellation due to the fault of the Conceding Authority *(Concedente),* cancellation for act of God *(caso fortuito)* or force majeure, bankruptcy *(concurso preventivo),* dissolution or liquidation of the Concessionaire or recovery *(rescate)* of the service. It then defines in detail the nature of each of these causes for termination. For example, among the sixteen specified faults of the Concessionaire justifying termination of the Concession Contract are service failures to carry out the legal provisions or regulatory provisions either of the Regulatory Entity or of the Concession Contract and repeated and unjustified delays in making agreed annual or projected investments51\n\nArticles 13.3 and 13.4 of the Concession Contract.\n\n105.\n\nAt the same time, the Concession Contract gave the Concessionaire the right to terminate the Concession Contract for fault committed by the Conceding Authority. On this point, Article 13.4 provided as follows: \"The Concessionaire may rescind the contract for fault of the Conceding Authority whenever a normative provision, legal action, act or omission of the Regulatory Entity, the Conceding Authority *(Concedente),* or any other organ of the Province of Santa Fe results in a serious failure to perform an obligation assumed by the Conceding Authority, which causes serious prejudice to the Concessionaire or which impedes the reasonable continuation of the execution of this Contract.\"52\n\nThe original Spanish version of Article 13.4 reads as follows:  \n \"13.4 Culpa del Concedente  \n El Concesionario podr\u00e1 rescindir este Contrato de Concesi\u00f3n por culpa del Concedente, cuando de una disposici\u00f3n normativa, acto, hecho o omisi\u00f3n del Ente Regulador, del proprio Concedente, o de alg\u00fan otro \u00f3rgano de la Provincia de Santa Fe, resulte un incumplimiento grave de las obligaciones asumidas por el Concedente que cause un grave perjuicio al Concesionario o que impida la razonable continuaci\u00f3n de la ejecuci\u00f3n del Contrato.\"\n\n106.\n\nThe consequences of termination by fault of the Concessionaire and termination by fault of the Conceding Authority are set out in Articles 13.8.2 and 13.8.3 of the Concession Contract, respectively.\n\n107.\n\nChapter 14, entitled \"Transitional Regime,\" established the rules to be followed during the time that APSF took possession and assumed the management of the system that up to that point had been under the control of DIPOS.\n\n108.\n\nChapter 15, the last chapter in the Concession Contract, concerned \"Final Provisions\" *(Disposiciones Finales).* Of note here is that the parties to the Concession Contract agreed to submit any matter concerning the interpretation and application of the Concession Contract to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the Province of Santa Fe, and specifically renounce recourse to any other forum or jurisdiction whatsoever.53\n\nArticle 15.4 of the Concession Contract. The original Spanish text of Article 15.4 reads as follows:  \n \"15.4 Jurisdicci\u00f3n  \n Sin perjuicio de lo establecido en el art\u00edculo 115 de la Ley 11,220, en caso de cualquier controversia relativa a la interpretaci\u00f3n y ejecuci\u00f3n del Contrato, las partes de someten a la jurisdicci\u00f3n local de la Provincia de Santa Fe, con renuncia expresa a cualquier otro fuero o jurisdicci\u00f3n que pudiera corresponder por cualquier causa.\"\n\n109.\n\n**Subsequent Revisions.** The legal framework of the Concession, as described in the preceding paragraphs, remained stable from the date that the Claimants assumed responsibility for the water and waste water system in the Province of Santa Fe in November 1995, until the Argentine crisis of 2001-2003. Throughout those more than five years, the parties appeared to accept that framework as the basis of their relationship. As noted above, because of public opposition to the infrastructure charge, the Provincial authorities and APSF negotiated an agreement in 1999 which allowed an increase in tariffs of 13.85% and an end to the infrastructure charge for specific consumers, thus providing in effect a cross-subsidization whereby all users would contribute to finance the costs of expansion and the individual infrastructure charge would be reduced, a solution that would be embodied in Law No. 11,665 of 28 April 199954. This solution sought to maintain the level of total tariff revenue collected by APSF and at the same alleviate the burden of certain charges on particular consumers. Its effect, according to the Claimants, was to preserve the \"equilibrium principle,\" whereby revenues would be balanced by costs and a profit, which they argue was the basis of the Concession.\n\nExh. C-58.\n\n110.\n\nIn the year 2000, faced with a deteriorating situation, the Provincial authorities became concerned about the inability of certain elements of the population to pay for water and waste water services. It therefore requested APSF to enter into discussions to find a solution to this problem. The two sides subsequently made an agreement on 7 February 2000, providing for temporary measures to alleviate the burden on segments of the population that could not afford to pay and to begin formal negotiation to establish a mechanism that would allow the equilibrium principle to be preserved in the new situation. The Preamble of their agreement specifically stated that their aim was \"to adopt a mechanism ensuring the economic and financial equilibrium of the Concession.\"55\n\nAgreement between the Province of Santa Fe and APSF on transitory measures for the Concession, 7 February 2000, Exh. C-61.\n\n111.\n\nThe contemplated negotiations did take place and resulted in three agreements or *actas. Acta I,* concluded on 25 August 2000, provided for some measures to alleviate the burden on consumers, who could not afford to pay for water and waste water services, and at the same time adjusted some of the Concessionaire\u2019s investment and performance obligations so as not to worsen APSF\u2019s financial situation. On 6 December 2000, the parties agreed to a second agreement, *Acta II,* which established an economic model to assure the maintenance of the Concession\u2019s financial equilibrium. Two weeks later, on 20 December 2000, the Ministry and APSF made a third agreement, *Acta III,* which sought to implement *Acta II* by setting out new regulations for low-income users of the service, defining the equilibrium principle by establishing a mathematical formula for calculating tariffs, and settling various other claims between the parties. In order to be implemented, *Acta III* had to secure the Provincial Governor\u2019s approval. Although it was submitted to his office, the Governor never ratified it. The crisis of 2001-2003 would cause it to become side tracked.\n\nC. *General Considerations*\n---------------------------\n\n112.\n\nViewed as a whole, the legal framework of the Concession sought to achieve and balance two basic objectives. First, it sought to attract private and foreign capital and know-how to the management and development of the Santa Fe water and sewage systems, a sector that had previously been a governmental service exclusively. In order to attract the large amounts of capital needed, the framework had to assure private investors the opportunity to earn a reasonable profit. Given the fact that such investors would have to commit massive amounts of capital in the early years of the Concession, and would only be repaid with an adequate return over a thirty-year period from the Concession\u2019s revenues, the tariff system was a key factor for enabling an investor to make a profit. An important element of the tariff system, in view of Argentina\u2019s volatile economic history and the length of the Concession period, was the mechanism for revising the tariff to take account of changing circumstances during those thirty years. Thus, in order to attract the interest of investors, Santa Fe created a legal framework that assured investors the possibility of making a profit and of dealing with changes that might seriously affect the profitability of the enterprise. Argentina\u2019s conclusion of some fifty-seven bilateral investment treaties, two of which are applicable to this case, sought to bolster its efforts at investment promotion by using international law to further assure foreign investors, like the Claimants, of their rights if they chose to invest in the country.\n\n113.\n\nA second important objective of the legal framework was to assure the efficient provision of water and sewage service at low cost. Toward this end, the legal framework gave the Provincial governmental authorities a certain degree of regulatory discretion in setting tariffs and in determining other important matters relating to APSF\u2019s activities. Although the Claimants assert that the tariff regime of the Water Law was based on the \"Equilibrium Principle\", guaranteeing the Concessionaire a recovery of all costs plus a return on invested capital, it is important to note three features of the legal framework: 1) the term \"Equilibrium Principle\" appears nowhere in the text of the Santa Fe Water Law, although it was used in certain government documents; 2) the Water Law conditions tariffs on the attainment of service efficiency by the Concessionaire; and 3) the Concessionaire was to assume the business risks of the operation.\n\n114.\n\nMoreover, the Concession\u2019s legal framework did not contain certain elements that were found in Argentina\u2019s privatized concessions in other economic sectors. Thus, the legal framework to which APSF was subject: 1) did not allow the payment or conversion of tariffs in U.S.. Dollars or other convertible currencies; 2) did not provide for the adjustment of tariffs at fixed times according to an agreed upon index; and 3) did not specifically exempt the Concession from price controls.56 Moreover, instead of specifically mandating that the tariff was to provide for all costs and reasonable return to the investors, Article 81 of the Santa Fe Water Law provided: \"The total invoicing by the each Provider for prices and tariffs must reflect the economic cost of an efficient service, including the achievement of improvements, expansion plans, and profits, taking into account in all cases the terms of the concession or service provision.\"\n\nSee, *e.g.* *LG&E Energy Corp., LG&E Capital Corp, and LG&E International Inc. v. Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/02/1), Decision on Liability (3 October 2006), for a discussion of the legal framework applicable to a gas transmission project.\n\n115.\n\nOn the other hand, it is clear that the legal framework of the Concession sought to protect the Concessionaire from changes in the legal parity of the Argentine Peso with the U.S.. Dollar and from significant increases in costs. The operation and development of a water and sewage system in a large province in a country that had experienced significant economic and financial difficulties in the past involved numerous risks. The Concession\u2019s legal framework sought to apportion those risks between the private investors and the Province of Santa Fe. That is to say, neither the Claimants nor Santa Fe alone assumed all of the risks that such an enterprise would face.\n\n**V The General Nature of the Claimants\u2019 Claims and Argentina\u2019s Defenses**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n116.\n\nIn submitting their case to this Tribunal, the Claimants rely on specific treaty rights which they claim that Argentina has failed to respect. In effect, they allege that Argentina\u2019s treatment of the Claimants\u2019 investments violates three specific treaty provisions: 1) guarantees against direct and indirect expropriation of their investments; 2) guarantees to accord their investments full protection and security; and 3) guarantees to accord their investments fair and equitable treatment. In response, Argentina argues that none of its actions violate treaty provisions. Moreover, it advances two affirmative defenses based on international law: 1) that the defense of necessity under international law excuses any failure to satisfy its BIT commitments, and 2) that measures of which the Claimants complain, arising as they did out of the Argentine crisis, were with within the legitimate police powers of the Respondent and therefore did not constitute a violation of either of the BITs. The Tribunal will next examine the nature and validity of the three alleged treaty violations, as well as Argentina\u2019s affirmative defenses under international law.\n\n**VI Responsibility for Direct or Indirect Expropriation**\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\nA. *The Applicable Treaty Provisions*\n-------------------------------------\n\n117.\n\nBoth BITs applicable to this case provide for the protection of investments by investors of one Contracting Party from acts of direct or indirect expropriation by the other Contracting Party in fairly similar terms.\n\nArticle 5(2) of the Argentina-France BIT states:\n\n\"2. *The Contracting Parties shall not take, directly or indirectly, any expropriation or nationalization measures or any other measures having a similar effect of dispossession, except for reasons of public necessity and on condition that the measures are not discriminatory or contrary to a specific undertaking.*\n\n*Any such dispossession measures taken shall give rise to the payment of prompt and adequate compensation the amount of which, calculated in accordance with the real value of the investments in question, shall be assessed on the basis of the normal economic situation prior to any threat of dispossession. \"*\n\nArticle V of the Argentina-Spain BIT provides:\n\n*\"Nationalization and Expropriation*\n\n*Nationalization, expropriation, or any other measure having similar characteristics or effects that might he adopted by the authorities of one Party against investments made in its territory by investors of the other Party shall he effected only in the public interest, in accordance with the law, and shall in no case he discriminatory. The Party adopting such measures shall pay the investor or his assignee appropriate compensation, without undue delay, and in freely convertible currency. \"*\n\n118.\n\nFor these provisions to apply to this case, and thus enable the Claimants to obtain compensation for the loss of their investments, this Tribunal must find, guided by the interpretation rules set forth in Articles 31 and 32 of the VCLT, that such losses resulted from *\"measures \" (\"imesures\"* in French or *\"medidas\"* in Spanish) taken by Argentina that resulted in the expropriation of Claimants\u2019 investment or had the effect of such expropriation. The application of the above-quoted treaty provisions therefore requires the existence of three elements: 1) an expropriable investment of a Claimant; 2) a measure taken by Argentina; and 3) an expropriation of that investment as a result of that measure.\n\n119.\n\nA first question then is whether the Claimants had an investment susceptible of expropriation under the two BITs applicable to this case. In its Decision on Jurisdiction in this case, this Tribunal held that the Claimants had made an investment for purposes of both Article 25 of the ICSID Convention and the relevant provisions of the applicable BITs.57 For the purpose of assessing the Claimants\u2019 expropriation claim, the Tribunal must now determine the specific assets allegedly expropriated. The Claimants, as shareholders in APSF, had an indirect interest in the Concession to operate the water and sewage system of Santa Fe for a period of thirty years. Neither APSF nor its shareholders owned or had any legal interest in the physical assets of the system. Those assets, whether existing at the time of the granting of the Concession or constructed or introduced into the system thereafter, were the property of the Province of Santa Fe. APSF as holder of the Concession had only a legal right to receive a stream of revenue from the operation of the system for a period of time under the conditions specified in the legal framework of the Concession described above. That right owned by APSF falls within the treaty definition of \"investment\", which by the terms of the applicable BIT, includes \"claims and rights to any benefit having any economic value\" (Article 1.1(c)) of the French Treaty) and \"rights derived from any kind of contribution made with the intention of creating economic value\" (Article 1.2 of the Spanish Treaty). As shareholders in APSF, the Claimants had an indirect interest in those same rights. Company shares are considered \"investments\" under the Argentina-France BIT (Article 1 (b)) and the Argentina-Spain BIT (Article 1(b)(2)). The economic value of such shares would be directly affected by any action taken against the assets of APSF. Thus, the Claimants had investments capable of protection from expropriation.\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction, 16 May 2006, paras. 29 and 49.\n\n120.\n\nNone of the treaties applicable to this case defines the noun \"measure.\"58 A dictionary definition of the term states that a measure is \"a plan or course of action taken to achieve a particular purpose.\"59. Thus, the various legislative, regulatory, and administrative actions taken by the Provincial and Federal Argentine authorities prior to, during, and following the country\u2019s financial crisis certainly qualify as \"measures.\" Such measures undoubtedly had an effect on the Concession. Many may have complicated and made difficult the Claimants\u2019 operation of the Concession and reduced the profitability of their investment. Others, such as Article 2 of Law No. 25,790 of 1 October 2003, which among other things directed that decisions of the executive branch not be limited by the regulatory framework of the Concession, may have abrogated or limited APSF\u2019s and the Claimants rights under Argentine law. But whether any or all of such measures constitute expropriation or have the effect of expropriation is quite a different matter. It is that question that this tribunal must address. It should also be noted, although Argentina never disputed it, that measures taken by the provincial authorities are attributable to the Argentine State under international law.\n\nCompare section 201 of the North American Free Trade Agreement, which states that **\"measure** includes any law, regulation, procedure, requirement or practice.\"\n\nOxford English Dictionary.\n\n121.\n\nThe treaty provisions quoted above cover both direct expropriations and indirect expropriation. In the former situation, a host government uses its sovereign powers to seize assets by depriving an investor of its title to or control over those assets. In case of an indirect expropriation, sometimes referred to as a \"regulatory taking,\"60 host states invoke their legislative and regulatory powers to enact measures that reduce the benefits investors derive from their investments but without actually changing or canceling investors\u2019 legal title to their assets or diminishing their control over them.61 While determining the existence of a direct expropriation is usually not difficult because of the usually obvious physical manifestations that come with depriving an investor of title and control, identifying an indirect expropriation is often a much more complicated matter which requires an inquiry into whether a regulatory measure has the effect of an expropriation on an investment or is a valid exercise of a State\u2019s regulatory power. As the tribunal in the NAFTA case of *Feldman v. Mexico* acknowledged, recognizing a direct expropriation is not difficult but \u2018... it is much less clear when governmental action that interferes with broadly-defined property rights... crosses the line from valid regulation to a compensable taking, and it is fair to say that no one has come up with a fully satisfactory means of drawing this line.\u201962 As will be seen below, the Claimants assert that Argentina took both direct and indirect expropriatory measures.\n\nS.R. Ratner, *Regulatory Takings in Institutional Context: Beyond the Fear of Fragmented International Law,* 102 AJIL 475 (2008).\n\nSee *e.g.* R Dolzer & Ch Schreuer, *Principles of International Investment Law* (2007) 89-92; A. Reinisch, *Expropriation* in P. Muchlinski et al.(eds) The Oxford Handbook of International Investment Law (2008) 407-412.\n\n*Marvin Roy Feldman Karpa v. United Mexican States* (ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/99/l); Award (16 December 2002), at para. 100.\n\n122.\n\nAn initial problem in applying the above-quoted treaty provisions to this case is that neither of the BITs specifically defines the term \"expropriation.\" However, Article 5(2) of the Argentina-France BIT, quoted above, provides some elaboration of the term when it refers to \"...similar acts of dispossession...\" and \"...such dispossession measures...\" Thus, expropriation, at least in the Argentina-France BIT, requires a \"dispossession\" of the investor. The requirement of \"dispossession\" as an element of expropriation is supported by scholars and jurisprudence in previous cases in which tribunals had to determine whether an expropriation had taken place. That inquiry is directed particularly at the \"effects\" of the measure on an investment, rather than at the intent of the government enacting the measure. Each of the BIT articles quoted above specifically refers to the \"effects\" of an expropriation measure and thus affirms the importance of evaluating the effects of a measure on the investment in determining whether an expropriation has taken place.\n\n123.\n\nInternational tribunals treat the severity of the economic impact caused by a regulatory measure as an important element in determining if the measure constitutes an expropriation requiring compensation. One question often asked is whether the challenged governmental measure resulted in \"substantial deprivation\" of the investment or its economic benefits. Thus, the tribunal in *Occidental v. Ecuador63* applied \"the criterion of substantial deprivation\" in determining whether the imposition of an Ecuadorian tax constituted an indirect expropriation. In *CMS* v. *Argentina,*64 which also relates to the Argentine crisis of 2001-2003, the claimant, an investor in a gas transportation company, alleged that Argentina\u2019s decision to suspend a tariff adjustment formula for gas transportation during the crisis constituted an indirect expropriation. In evaluating this claim, the tribunal, after reviewing the relevant arbitral jurisprudence, stated that \u2018the essential question is to establish whether the enjoyment of the property has been effectively neutralized,\u2019 because \u2018the standard where indirect expropriation is contended is that of *substantial deprivation.\u2019* (emphasis added) Moreover, such deprivation must have permanent or lasting results. For example, in *LG&E v. Argentina,* the tribunal found that the effects of Argentina\u2019s measures on the claimants\u2019 investment were not permanent, stating that such measures could not constitute expropriation \"without a permanent, severe deprivation of LG&E\u2019s rights with regard to its investment, or almost complete deprivation of the value of LG&E\u2019s investment.\"65 Thus, in applying the provisions of the three BITs applicable to this case, this Tribunal will have to determine whether they effected a substantial, permanent deprivation of the Claimants\u2019 investments or the enjoyment of those investments\u2019 economic benefits.\n\n*Occidental Exploration and Production Company v. the Republic of Ecuador,* LCIA Case No UN3467 (Final Award) (1 July 2004), at para. 89.\n\n*CMS Gas Transmission Company v. the Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No ARB/01/8) (Award) (12 May 2005), at para. 262.\n\n*LG&E supra* note 56 at para. 200.\n\n124.\n\nThe Claimants in their pleadings complained against Argentina\u2019s \"Measures,\" referring collectively to numerous actions taken by Argentina from the time that the crisis began to emerge in 1999 until the Concession was terminated in 2006. Specifically, the Claimants cite eight specific measures taken by the Province. They include a) rejection of APSF\u2019s requests for tariff adjustments; b) abandonment of the tariff regime; c) halting the renegotiation process and imposing more onerous conditions; d) abusively demanding that APSF comply with its obligations under the Concession Contract when it was already operating at a loss; e) abusive demands that APSF commit more funds and increase its capital; e) refusal of the Claimants\u2019 attempt to sell their shares to local investors; e) unilateral termination of the Concession after driving the APSF into liquidation; and f) refusal to compensate the Claimants for the loss of their investment as required by the Concession Contract.66 In order to evaluate the expropriatory nature of these numerous measures, the Tribunal must examine them individually. Basically, the measures of which the Claimants complain fall into three categories: 1) acts of a general legal or regulatory nature, not directed specifically at APSF or the Claimants, enacted to cope with the financial crisis and its aftermath; 2) the failure of the Provincial in response to APSF\u2019s repeated requests to revise the tariff charged to users by the Concession during and after the crisis; and 3) the actions taken by the Provincial authorities at the time of the termination of the Concession. The Tribunal will examine the nature of these three categories of measures to determine whether they constituted measures of expropriation under the applicable BITs.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Post Hearing Brief para. 198.\n\nB. *Measures Taken to Cope with the Crisis*\n-------------------------------------------\n\n125.\n\nBeginning in 2001, the Argentine government enacted various measures in an effort to cope with the financial crisis descending on the country. Among these measures of which the Claimants complain are Decree No 1570/01 of 3 December 2001 which imposed a \"corralito\" or \"little fence\" upon bank accounts so as to limit the amounts of cash withdrawals by account holders, the imposition of new taxes, and most of Emergency Law67 No. 25, 561 of 6 January 2002, which i) abolished the currency board that had linked the Argentine Peso to the U.S.. dollar, resulting in a significant depreciation of the Argentine Peso; ii) abolished the adjustment of public service contracts according to agreed upon indexations; and iii) authorized the Executive branch of government to renegotiate all public service contracts and led to various other measures surrounding the efforts by the Argentine government to renegotiate public service contracts. These measures certainly made the operation of the Concession more difficult, reduced its profitability significantly, and appear to have abrogated or modified certain acquired rights of the Claimants. However, they did not affect the possession by APSF of the Concession. APSF remained in possession of the Concession through this period and continued to provide water and sewage services to the Province of Santa Fe. Moreover, the Claimants as APSF shareholders continued to control APSF and to retain possession of their APSF shares undisturbed. Thus, the Tribunal finds that no overt taking of the Concession\u2019s rights during this period occurred as a result of these measures and therefore no direct expropriation, as that term is understood under the BITs and in international law, took place.\n\n*Supra* note 18.\n\n126.\n\nDid these measures constitute an indirect expropriation or a measure tantamount to expropriation? The fact that the effect of such measures may have diminished the value of an investment does not in and of itself constitute an indirect expropriation. In *LG&E,68* which considered the effect on investors in the gas sector of the measures that Argentina took to deal with the crisis, the tribunal found that such measures did not constitute either a direct or an indirect expropriation under the Argentina-U.S. BIT. Citing *CME Czech Republic B. V. v. Czech Republic,* the **LG&E** tribunal stated that a measure tantamount to expropriation occurs when governmental measures \"effectively neutralize[d] the benefit of the property of the foreign owner.\" It then stated: \"Ownership or enjoyment can be said to be \"neutralized \"where a party no longer is in control of the investment or where it cannot direct the day-to-day operations of the investment.\"69 The **LG&E** tribunal ultimately found that no expropriation, direct or indirect, had taken place as a result of the measures taken by Argentina. Similarly in *CMS,* noted above, although the tribunal recognized that the measures under dispute had an important effect on the investor\u2019s business, it found no substantial deprivation and thus no breach of the expropriation provision of the Argentina-U.S BIT. It also pointed out that \"the investor is in control of the investment; the government does not manage the day-to-day operations of the company... and the investor has full ownership and control of the investment.\"70 The same can be said of the Claimants in the present case with respect to the measures taken by Argentina to cope with the crisis. The events surrounding the termination of the APSF Concession are a different matter that will be discussed below.\n\n*LG&E supra* note 56, Award (25 July 2007).\n\n*Ibid.,* at para. 188. Citing *Pope & Talbot, Inc. v. Canada,* Interim Award (26 June 2000), at para. 100.\n\n*CMS supra* note 64 at para. 263.\n\n127.\n\nClaimants in several other investor-State arbitrations arising out of the 2001-2003 crisis have alleged that Argentina\u2019s measures to deal with the crisis constituted acts of indirect expropriation. In nearly all of those cases, the tribunals rejected that claim on the grounds that those measures did not amount to a permanent, substantial deprivation of the economic substance of the investment.71 In only one case, *Siemens v. Argentina72* did a tribunal find that Argentina\u2019s actions constituted expropriation. In that case, the tribunal did not find that general measures enacted by Argentina to deal with the crisis were expropriations but rather that a specific government decree terminating Siemens\u2019 contract with the Argentine government was an expropriation.\n\n*LG&E supra* note 56; *CMS supra* note 64; *Azurix Corp* v. *Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/01/12), Award (14 July 2006); *Enron Corp, and Ponderosa Assets S.A. v. Argentine Republic* (ICSID case No. ARB/01/3), Award, (22 May 2007).\n\n*Siemens AG v. Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/02/8), Award (6 February 2007).\n\n128.\n\nAs numerous cases have pointed out, in evaluating a claim of expropriation it is important to recognize a State\u2019s legitimate right to regulate and to exercise its police power in the interests of public welfare and not to confuse measures of that nature with expropriation. The *American Law Institute\u2019s Restatement (Third) of the Foreign Relations Law of the United States* underscores this point when it states that \"... a State is not responsible for loss of property or for other economic disadvantage resulting from *bona fide* general taxation, regulation, forfeiture for crime, or other action that is commonly accepted as within the police power of States, if it is not discriminatory...\"73In the context of investment disputes, the doctrine of police powers has been referred to, for instance, in *Methanex v. United States74* and *Saluka v. the Czech Republic.75* In this latter decision, the tribunal noted that \"the principle that a State does not commit an expropriation and is thus not liable to pay compensation to a dispossessed alien investor when it adopts general regulations that are 'commonly accepted as within the police power of States' forms part of customary law today.\"\n\nAmerican Law Institute, Restatement (Third) of the Foreign Relations Law of the United States, Vol. 1, sec. 712, comment g.\n\n*Methanex Co.* v. *United States of America* (UNCITRAL), Award (3 August 2005), pt. IV, ch. D, para. 7\n\n*Saluka Investments B.V.* v. *the Czech Republic* (UNCITRAL), Partial Award (17 March 2006), at para. 262.\n\n129.\n\nIn analyzing the measures taken by Argentina to cope with the crisis, the Tribunal finds that they did not constitute a permanent and substantial deprivation of the Claimants' investments. Although they may have negatively affected the profitability of the APSF Concession, they did not take or reduce the property rights of APSF or its investors and did not affect the ability of APSF to hold the Concession and to direct its operations and activities. The Tribunal therefore concludes that such measures did not violate the above quoted BIT articles with respect to direct or indirect expropriation; however, that is not to say that they have not violated other treaty commitments.\n\nC. *The Province's Refusal to Revise the Tariff*\n------------------------------------------------\n\n130.\n\nThe Claimants also assert that the Province's failure to revise the tariff in response to APSF's repeated requests constitutes direct or indirect expropriation. In making a literal interpretation of the BITs, one encounters an initial question with respect to the Claimants' assertion. Both treaties require the existence of a governmental \"measure\" in order to found a claim for expropriation. Can a *failure* to take action, such as to revise a tariff, constitute a \"measure\"? In *Olguin v. Paraguay,* the tribunal expressed the opinion that \"[e]xpropriation therefore requires a teleologically driven action for it to occur; omissions, however egregious they may be, are not sufficient for it to take place.\"76 A \"measure,\" which is not defined in any of the two BITs, is usually interpreted to mean an action taken to achieve a particular purpose. In this case, although Argentina refused to revise the tariff, that action of refusal was not an omission but the result of a carefully considered decision formally communicated to APSF and that decision constitutes a measure within the meaning of both treaties. The decision not to revise the tariff in response to APSF\u2019s requests was certainly teleologically driven.\n\n*Eudoro A. Olguin* v. *Republic of Paraguay* (ICSID Case No ARB 96/5), Award, (26 January 2001), at para. 84.\n\n131.\n\nThe Claimants argue that the Province\u2019s failure to revise the tariff according to the terms of the legal framework deprived them of the economic benefit of their investment and therefore constituted an indirect expropriation. The economic value of the investment was the tariff income that APSF was to receive from payments by consumers for water and sewage services. That income, according to the legal framework described above, was dependent on the tariff which was in turn to be determined in such a way as to allow APSF to earn a profit on its operations. The Concession, according to the Claimants, was based on the principle of financial equilibrium, the principle that the applicable tariff would be set at a level to assure that the income from consumer payments would cover all costs of operation, including debt service, and provide APSF a reasonable profit. By refusing to apply the legal framework to revise the tariff in the presence of steeply rising costs, the provincial and federal authorities\u2019 measures prevented APSF from achieving the required financial equilibrium and therefore destroyed the economic value of the Concession, resulting in an indirect expropriation.\n\n132.\n\nArgentina denies that the Province\u2019s refusal to revise the tariff was a measure of expropriation or constituted a regulatory taking. It argues that it was not obligated to increase the tariff under the legal framework of the Concession, that the principle of financial equilibrium was not embodied in the Concession, that APSF, as Concessionaire, had assumed certain risks incident to the operation of the Concession which the Province, as the conceding authority was not obligated to protect APSF against. It points to the fact that its refusal to revise the tariff did not result in a taking necessary for an expropriation and that any complaints by APSF concerning the application of the tariff regime were in effect contract claims to be settled according to the dispute resolution mechanism of the Concession, not treaty claims to be resolved in international arbitration.\n\n133.\n\nIn support of its expropriation claims arising out of Argentina\u2019s exercise of its regulatory powers or failure thereof, the Claimants rely particularly on the cases of *CME* and *Vivendi II.* In both of those cases, the Claimants had lost their investments as a result of State measures, and the tribunals in both cases found that expropriations had taken place. With respect to the former case, the present Tribunal notes that *Lauder v. Czech Republic77* which the Claimants did not discuss in their pleadings, dealt with identical facts to those of the *CME case* and a similar BIT, but concluded that the Czech government\u2019s measures in that case did not constitute an expropriation, thus significantly diminishing the precedential value of *CME.* Moreover, in *CME,* the challenged Czech government action was an affirmative action by the government whereas in the present case the Claimants are complaining of Argentina\u2019s failure to exercise its regulatory powers affirmatively in favor of APSF. With respect to *Vivendi II,* which did not arise out of the Argentine crisis of 2001-2003, the provincial government undertook a series of deliberate actions, such as forbidding the collection of unpaid waters and sewage bills in the courts, which had the effect of depriving the concessionaire of the means of enforcing legitimate monetary claims necessary for the economic viability of its enterprise. In the present case, the governmental authorities took no such similar actions against AASA or the Claimants.\n\n*Ronald S. Lauder v. the Czech Republic* (UNCITRAL), Final Award, (3 September 2001).\n\n134.\n\nAn indirect expropriation requires a substantial deprivation of an investment. No such substantial deprivation occurred as a result of Santa Fe\u2019s refusal to revise the tariffs to be applied by APSF. Throughout the period 1999-2006, APSF remained in control of the Concession and its authority to manage and direct the operation of the water and sewage system was undiminished. The Tribunal therefore concludes that the Province\u2019s failure to revise the tariff, despite APSF\u2019s repeated requests during this period, did not constitute either a direct or indirect expropriation of the Claimants\u2019 investment in APSF.\n\nD. *The Province\u2019s Termination of the Concession*\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n135.\n\nOn January 31, 2006, the Provincial authorities took measures, described above, to terminate the Concession granted to APSF in 1995 and to retake possession of the water distribution and waste water systems that had been the subject of the Concession. Moreover, the Province also liquidated the performance bond which APSF and the Claimants had established to guarantee their performance under the Concession and it refused to pay the unamortized value of APSF\u2019s investments pursuant to the Concession Contract. Did such measures constitute either a direct or indirect expropriation of the Concession?\n\n136.\n\nThe Claimants assert that such measures which resulted in a complete deprivation of APSF\u2019s rights in the Concession constituted a clear case of not just an indirect expropriation but also a direct expropriation. They argue that such termination makes their situation different from the situations that prevailed in *CMS v. Argentina, LG&E v. Argentina, Azurix v. Argentina,* and the other cases cited above in which tribunals deciding cases arising out of the Argentine crisis determined that the measures taken by Argentina to cope with the crisis did not constitute either a direct or indirect expropriation. The key difference, according to the Claimants, was that in those cases, the investors remained in ownership and control of their investments but that the Claimants in the present case, because of the Province\u2019s abrupt termination of the Concession, did not. As a result of the termination, the Claimants assert that Santa Fe gained a much improved and expanded water and sewage system without having to pay compensation for it. In support of their position, the Claimants cite the cases of *CM1-78* and *Vivendi II.79* In both of those cases, the Claimants had lost their investments as a result of State measures and the tribunals in both cases found that expropriations had taken place.\n\n*CME Czech Republic BV (The Netherlands) v. the Czech Republic,* (UNCITRAL), Partial Award, (13 September 2001).\n\n*Supra* note 8, Award (20 August 2007).\n\n137.\n\nIn order to determine whether an expropriation has taken place as a result of the Province\u2019s termination of the Concession, the Tribunal must examine and analyze the rights held by APSF in the Concession. Neither APSF nor its shareholders owned or had any property rights in the physical assets of the water and sewage system of the Province of Santa Fe. Had they owned the system, a seizure of that system by the Province would have constituted an expropriation and the Claimants would have been entitled to protection under the expropriation provisions of the BITs applicable to this case. Instead, APSF held contractual rights as a Concessionaire to operate that system and to derive income from that operation. That Concession gave APSF certain rights, which included the right to collect revenues generated by tariffs paid by consumers during a period of thirty years. But APSF\u2019s rights to that revenue and to continue to operate the water and sewage system of the Province were by no means absolute, as the Claimants seem to suggest in their pleadings. Those rights were subject to various conditions concerning such matters as efficiency, adequacy of service, and achievement of investment commitments for improvement and expansion of the system, among others. Moreover, as discussed above, the Concession Contract specifically granted the Argentine government the right to terminate the Concession due to the fault of the Concessionaire and to retake possession of the water and sewage system.\n\n138.\n\nIn the fall of 2005, APSF itself had sought transfer its shares to local investors and, when that failed, to transfer the system back to the Province. The Province denied both requests. APSF\u2019s request placed a certain pressure on Argentina to plan for the eventuality of APSF\u2019s unilateral withdrawal. Subsequently, faced with a deteriorating situation and confronted with the overwhelming need and public duty to assure the continued provision of water and waste water services to millions of people in a vast provincial area, the provincial government invoked its rights under the Concession Contract and terminated the Concession. Argentina argues that under the Concession Contract it had the right to terminate the Concession for serious fault and that such a serious fault existed in this case. During the attempt to renegotiate the Concession Contract, the Argentine regulatory authorities had also imposed various high fines on APSF for certain deficiencies in operation.\n\n139.\n\nIn response, the Claimants assert that the Province\u2019s abusive actions had driven APSF into liquidation and that their plight was due entirely to the illegal and unjustified actions of the Provincial authorities. They suggest that the aim of the Province was to drive APSF out of business and renationalize the water and waste water systems of the province.\n\n140.\n\nInternational law has recognized that contractual rights may be the subject of expropriation at least since the *Norwegian Shipowners\u2019 Claims case.80* The *Chorzow Factory* case would come to a similar conclusion.81 Although the two treaties applicable to the present case do not specifically so state, the inference is clear from the fact that their definitions of investments include concessions conferred by law or contract that contractual rights in a concession, like rights in physical assets, are protected from expropriation. But just as in a case of the expropriation of physical assets, a tribunal must first understand the nature of the rights allegedly expropriated before proceeding to determine whether they have been expropriated under international law. To assess the nature of these rights in a case of alleged expropriation of contractual rights, one must look to the domestic law under which the rights were created. APSF\u2019s and the Claimants\u2019 contractual rights in the Concession, which the Claimants allege were expropriated, were created by the legal framework and the Concession Contract described above.\n\n*Norwegian Shipowners\u2019 Claims (Nor v U.S..),* (Perm Ct Arb 1922) 1 RIAA 307.\n\n*Case Concerning the Factory at Chorzow (FRG v. Pol)* (1927) PCIJ Series A No 9.\n\n141.\n\nUnder that legal framework, the Province of Santa Fe had a right to terminate the Concession Contract upon certain conditions, mentioned above. In January 2006, it purported to exercise its contractual rights when it terminated the Concession with APSF. In this regard, the situation was different from that existing in *the Norwegian Shipowners Claims Case,* the *Chorzow Factory Case,* and the *CME* v. *Czech Republic* Case on which the Claimants rely. In those cases, the respondent State was interfering in a contract between the claimants and a third party. In the present case, the Respondent was taking action with respect to a contract to which it was a party and whose terms gave it a right to terminate under certain conditions. The Tribunal also notes that *Lauder v. Czech Republic82* which the Claimants did not discuss in their pleadings, dealt with identical facts to those of the *CME case* and a similar BIT, but which concluded that the Czech government\u2019s measures in that case did not constitute an expropriation.\n\n*Supra* note 77.\n\n142.\n\nIn investor-State arbitrations which involve breaches of contracts concluded between a claimant and a host government, tribunals have made a distinction between *acta iure imperii* and *acta iure gestionis,* that is to say, actions by a State in exercise of its sovereign powers and actions of a State as a contracting party. It is the use by a State of its sovereign powers that gives rise to treaty breaches, while actions as a contracting party merely give rise to contract claims not ordinarily covered by an investment treaty. As pointed out in *Siemens v. Argentina,* \"... for the behavior of the State as a party to a contract to be considered a breach of an investment treaty, such behavior must be beyond that which an ordinary contracting party could adopt and involve State interference with the operation of the contract.\"83 In *Siemens,* the tribunal found that Argentina took a series of measures based not on its contract with the Siemens subsidiary but on the exercise of its public authority, one of which was a governmental decree not based on contract but which terminated the contract. It therefore found that Argentina had expropriated Siemens\u2019 contractual rights. A similar finding was reached in *Vivendi II,* where the tribunal concluded that the measures taken by the Province of Tucuman amounted to an expropriation of the investor\u2019s contractual rights.84 However, the mere fact that there is some government involvement in the events that lead to the termination of a contract does not necessarily mean that such termination is the result of an exercise of sovereign powers, as noted recently by the tribunal in *Bayindir v. Pakistan.85*\n\n*Supra* note 72, at para. 248.\n\n*Supra* note 8, Award (20 August 2007), at para. 7.5.34.\n\n*Bayindir Insaat Turizm Ticaret ve Sanayi A \u015f v Islamic Republic of Pakistan* (ICSID Case No ARB/03/29), (hereafter *\"Bayindir v. Pakistan\")* Award (27 August 2009), at paras. 128-129, 315.\n\n143.\n\nIn the present case, did the Province act in the exercise of its sovereign powers *(acta iure imperii)* or as an ordinary contracting party *(acta iure gestionis)* when it terminated the Concession Contract with APSF? If the former, then Argentina may have expropriated the contractual rights of APSF and the Claimants. If the latter, then no expropriation has taken place and the Claimants have only contractual claims under the legal framework described above. While Argentina exercised its public authority on various occasions during the crisis, the Tribunal does not consider that the Province\u2019s termination of the Concession Contract was an exercise of such authority. Rather, its actions were taken according to the rights it claimed under the Concession Contract and the legal framework. Indeed, the provincial authorities\u2019 behavior in ending the Concession Contract seems not unlike the behavior of a private contracting party faced with the threatened termination of an important long-term supply contract: it quickly made other provisions for supply of the needed commodity or service and then took steps to end the deteriorated contractual relationship itself.\n\n144.\n\nThis Tribunal views the dispute between the Claimants and the Province concerning the termination of the Concession as essentially contractual in nature. Indeed, Argentina\u2019s action in terminating the Concession purportedly in accordance with the Concession\u2019s terms was not an act of expropriation but rather the exercise of its alleged contractual rights. Even its liquidation of the Performance Bond was based on an alleged contractual right since Argentina was the beneficiary of that bond. Whether such alleged exercise of contractual rights was legally in accord with the Concession Contract and the Performance Bond is a matter for the dispute settlement processes applicable to that Contract and the Performance Bond. The Tribunal does not ignore that, under certain circumstances, the unlawful exercise of a contractual remedy may support the conclusion that there has been a treaty breach. As noted in an award recently rendered by another ICSID tribunal:\n\n\"[...] in assessing whether there has been a treaty breach a tribunal may review contract matters [... ] These considerations do not imply that the assessment of a treaty breach in the context of a contractual relationship requires a determination that the contract has been breached. Breach of contract and breach of treaty are separate questions giving rise to separate enquiries [... ] Because the enquiries are different, the fact that a State exercises a contract right or remedy does not in and of itself exclude the possibility of a treaty breach.\"86\n\n*Id,* par. 136-138\n\n145.\n\nIn its assessment of the existence of a treaty breach, the Tribunal has taken into account, insofar as relevant, the contractual conduct of the Province. It concludes, however, that measures taken by the Province to terminate the Concession were ostensibly an exercise of its contractual rights but not measures of expropriation. Therefore, irrespective of the conclusions that the dispute settlement processes applicable to the Concession Contract and the Performance Bond may yield, the Tribunal concludes that Argentina\u2019s conduct in this regard was not in breach of the expropriation clauses of the BITs.\n\nE. *Argentina\u2019s Police Powers Defense*\n--------------------------------------\n\n146.\n\nArgentina asserts that the actions of the Province of Santa Fe with respect to APSF and the Claimants were a legitimate exercise of its police powers both under international law and Argentine law and that such police powers are therefore a complete defense to any alleged treaty violations, not only with respect to the Claimants\u2019 expropriation claims but also with respect to their claims of Argentina\u2019s denial of full protection and security and fair and equitable treatment. In making this argument, it relies particularly on Article 10(5) of the Harvard Draft Convention on the International Responsibility of States For Injuries to Aliens, particularly its provision that an \"uncompensated taking of an alien property or a deprivation of the use or enjoyment of property which results from... a general change in the value of currency....shall not be considered wrongful...\" if such measure is non- discriminatory, not the result of a violation of Draft provisions on the right to a fair trial, not an unreasonable departure from generally recognized principles of justice, and not an abuse of powers.87\n\nThe 1961 Convention on the International Responsibility of States for Injuries to the Economic Interests of Aliens, *55 American Journal of International Law* 545 (1961).\n\n147.\n\nWhile this Tribunal does not pronounce on the legal authority of the Draft, it does acknowledge that States have a legitimate right to exercise their police powers to protect the public interest and that the doctrine of police powers, as the above-quoted excerpt from the Draft clearly states, has been particularly pertinent in cases of expropriation where tribunals have had to balance an investor\u2019s property rights with the legitimate and reasonable need for the State to regulate. Those cases and the police powers doctrine are inapplicable in the present dispute because the Tribunal has already ruled that the Claimants have not suffered an expropriation because they have not been deprived of their property rights by Argentina\u2019s measures.\n\n148.\n\nThe police powers doctrine is a recognition that States have a reasonable right to regulate foreign investments in their territories even if such regulation affects investor property rights. In effect, the doctrine seeks to strike a balance between a State\u2019s right to regulate and the property rights of foreign investors in their territory. However, the application of the police powers doctrine as an explicit, affirmative defense to treaty claims *other* than for expropriation is inappropriate, because in judging those claims and applying such principles as full protection and security and fair and equitable treatment, both of which are considered in subsequent sections of this Decision, a tribunal must take account of a State\u2019s reasonable right to regulate. Thus, if a tribunal finds that a State has violated treaty standards of fair and equitable treatment and full protection and security, it must of necessity have determined that such State has exceeded its reasonable right to regulate. Consequently, for that same tribunal to make a subsequent inquiry as to whether that same State has exceeded its legitimate police powers would require that tribunal to engage in an inquiry it has already made. In short, a decision on the application of the police powers doctrine in such circumstance would be duplicative and therefore inappropriate.\n\n149.\n\nIn its pleadings with respect to the police powers defense, Argentina has also argued that international law grants it sovereignty over its own currency and that no international wrong can result from actions which it takes to manage that monetary system. It asserts that its failure to revise the APSF tariff is protected by the powers that international law grants it over its sovereignty. The problem with the Respondent\u2019s argument on this point is that the Claimants are not challenging Argentina\u2019s right to regulate its currency. What they challenge is the Province\u2019s failure to fulfill its obligations under the Concession Contract once Argentina had exercised its police power to regulate its currency. The police power doctrine does not protect Argentina from liability for treaty violations in that circumstance. A measure by a State of general currency devaluation and its deliberate refusal to respect a specific commitment made to a foreign investment are two very different matters.\n\n150.\n\nAt one point in the pleadings, the Respondent seemed to argue that the Respondent\u2019s police powers *under Argentine law* also constituted a defense to liability under the applicable BIT. The nature of police powers under Argentine law is not relevant in the present proceeding since, as discussed in paragraph 61 of this decision, Article 27 of the VCLT specifically provides that \"[a] party may not invoke provisions of its internal law as justification for its failure to perform a treaty.\"\n\nF. *The Tribunal\u2019s Conclusions*\n-------------------------------\n\n151.\n\nAfter examining the various measures taken by Argentina from the onset of the crisis in 1999, until the termination of the Concession in 2006, the Tribunal concludes that none of them, either individually or collectively, violated the BIT provisions governing direct and indirect expropriations.\n\n**VII Responsibility for Failure to Provide Protection and Security**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nA. *The Applicable Treaty Provisions*\n-------------------------------------\n\n152.\n\nThe Claimants also allege that Argentina has breached the provisions of the BITs in that they have denied the Claimants protection and security. The specific treaty provision on which they rely are as follows: Article 5(1) of the Argentina-France BIT states:\n\n*Investments made by investors of one Contracting Party shall be fully and completely protected and safeguarded in the territory and maritime zone of the other Contracting Party, in accordance with the principle of just and equitable treatment mentioned in article 3 of this Agreement.*\n\nArticle III. 1 of the Argentina-Spain BIT provides:\n\n*Article III PROTECTION*\n\n*Each Party shall protect within its territory investments made in accordance with its legislation by investors of the other Party and shall not obstruct, by unjustified or discriminatory measures, the management, use, enjoyment, extension, sale and, where appropriate, liquidation of such investments.*\n\n153.\n\nAt the outset, it should be noted that whereas the Claimants\u2019 pleadings refer to these treaty provisions as guaranteeing \"full protection and security,\" a term found in many bilateral investment treaties, that specific phrase appears nowhere in the two BITS applicable to this case. The Argentina-France BIT promises that investments will be \"fully and completely protected and safeguarded...\" and the Argentina-Spain BIT promises only that the Contracting Parties \"shall protect\" investments. It remains to be seen whether the BITs are in effect promising differing levels of protection and whether the level of protection they provide is different from that offered by the many treaties employing the terminology of \"full protection and security\".\n\nB. *Analysis and Jurisprudence*\n-------------------------------\n\n154.\n\nIn seeking to apply these provisions, this Tribunal is confronted initially with two basic questions: Protection from whom? Protection against what? In other words, from whom is a Contracting Party to protect an investor and against what specific actions by such person is a Contracting Party to secure protection? The Claimants argue that in withdrawing certain alleged guarantees made to the Concessionaire and its investors Argentina withdrew \"...the legal protection and security previously granted to an investment... \".88 Thus, Claimants\u2019 interpretation of the above-quoted treaty provisions is that Argentina promised to protect the investments of the other Contracting Party from actions that Argentina itself might take in the exercise of its legal and regulatory authority. The Respondent, on the other hand, takes the position that the provisions on protection and security apply primarily to protection from physical acts against an investor or investment and that only in exceptional circumstances should they be applied to other situations.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Reply, para. 361.\n\n155.\n\nThe origin of the terms \"full protection and security\", \"constant protection and security,\" or simply \"protection and security\" appears to lie in the bilateral commercial treaties that countries concluded in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, such as the friendship, commerce and navigation (FCN) treaties made by the United States during that period.89 For example, of twenty-two early commercial treaties concluded by the United States before 1920, fourteen contained reference to \"special protection\" and the remaining eight specified \"full and perfect protection\" of persons\u2019 private property.90 As an illustration, Article 3 the FCN treaty that the United States concluded with Brunei in 1850 provided that His Highness the Sultan of Borneo \"...engages that such Citizens of the United States of America shall as far as lies within in his power, within his dominions enjoy *full and complete protection and security* for themselves and for any property which they may acquire...\" (emphasis added).91 A number of bilateral treaties of other countries also employed this term.92\n\nK. Vandevelde, *\"The Bilateral Investment Treaty Program of the United States, \"* 21 Cornell Int\u2019l L.J. 203, 204. (1988).\n\nW. Wilson, R., *\"Property-protection Provisions in United States Commercial Treaties, \"* 45 Am. J. Int\u2019l L. 84, 92-96(1951).\n\nTreaty of Friendship, Commerce and Navigation with Brunei, 10 Stat. 909; Treaty Series 331 (entered into force July 11, 1853).\n\nSee for example the bilateral treaty between Italy and Venezuela, stating that \"citizens of each State should enjoy in the territory of the other \u2018the fullest measure of protection and security of person and property, and should have in this respect the same rights and privileges accorded to nationals. \u2019 Quoted in the *Sambiaggio* case, Italy-Venezuela Mixed Claims Commission, U.N. Reports of International Arbitral Awards, vol.X, p. 512.\n\n156.\n\nTraditionally, courts and tribunals have interpreted the content of this standard of treatment as imposing a positive obligation upon a host State to exercise due diligence to protect the investor and his property from physical threats and injuries, not as imposing an obligation to protect covered investments and all investors from all injuries from whatever sources. In the *ELSI case,93* in which the United States brought a claim against Italy on grounds that the requisition of a U.S.. investor\u2019s factory by the Mayor of Palermo, Italy, violated Article V(1) of the United States-Italy FCN treaty obligating the Contracting Parties to provide investors \"the most constant protection and security,\" the International Court of Justice Chamber stated that: \"The reference in Article V to the provision of \u2018constant protection and security\u2019 cannot be construed as the giving of a warranty that property shall never in any circumstances be occupied or disturbed.\"94\n\n*Elettronica Sicula S.p.A. (ELSI),* (U.S.. v. Italy), I.C.J. Reports 1989.\n\n*Ibid.* \u00a7 108, p.65.\n\n157.\n\nWith the development of bilateral investment treaties, whose texts were influenced by the language of the earlier of FCN treaties, the drafters of BITs incorporated the term \"full protection and security,\" or some variation thereof, in this new legal instrument designed to protect and promote foreign investment in a new era. Early interpretations of BIT provisions on full protection and security applied them essentially to protect investors and investments from physical injuries and threats, particularly from actions, usually unauthorized, by a country\u2019s army units or individual soldiers, or from disgruntled workers.95 In each of these cases, the tribunals stressed that the treaty provision was not a guarantee against all injuries that might befall an investment but only required the host country to exercise due diligence. On the meaning of due diligence, tribunals and scholars have often referred to the statement of Professor A.V. Freeman in his lectures at the Hague Academy of International Law: \"The \u2018due diligence\u2019 is nothing more nor less than the reasonable measures of prevention which a well-administered government could be expected to exercise under similar circumstances.\"96 The late Professor Ian Brownlie observed that the decisions of tribunals give no definition of \u2018due diligence\u2019, but that \u2018obviously no very dogmatic definition would be appropriate, since what is involved is a standard which will vary according to the circumstances.\u201997\n\nSee *e.g.,* Asian Agricultural Products Limited v. Sri Lanka (ICSID Case No. ARB/ 87/3) Award (27 June 1990); *American Manufacturing and Trading, Inc. v. Zaire* (ICSID Case No. ARB/93/1) Award (21 February 1997).\n\nAV Freeman, *Responsibility of States for the Unlawful Acts of Their Armed Forces',* 88 Recueil des Corns (1956) 261.\n\nI. Brownlie, *Principles of Public International Law* (1990) 454.\n\n158.\n\nThe fact that the \"full protection and security\" standard implies only an obligation of due diligence, as opposed to strict liability, has also been widely recognized in more recent arbitral case decisions.98 On the other hand, there seems to exist no consensus as to the extent to which the full protection and security standard may exceed the State\u2019s obligation to provide mere physical security to the investor and his assets.\n\nSee, among others, *Saluka supra* note 75; at para. 483; *Rumeli Telekom A.S and Telsim Mobil Telekomunikasyon Hizmetleri A.S v. Republic of Kazakhstan* (ICSID Case No. ARB/05/16) Award (29 July 2008), at para. 668; *Waguih Elie George Siag & Clorinda Vecchi v. the Arab Republic of Egypt* (ICSID Case No. ARB/05/15), Award (I June 2009), at para.447.\n\n159.\n\nTraditionally, the cases applying full protection and security have dealt with injuries to physical assets of investors committed by third parties where host governments have failed to exercise due diligence in preventing the damage or punishing the perpetrators. In the present case, the Claimants are attempting to apply the protection and security clause to a different type of situation. They do not complain that third parties have injured their physical assets or persons, as in the traditional protection and security case. They are instead asserting that Argentina denied it protection and security by dint of the actions which Argentina itself took in exercise of its governmental powers against APSF\u2019s contractual rights under the Concession Contract and the governing legal framework. This Tribunal must therefore decide whether the treaty provisions apply to the Claimants\u2019 situation.\n\n160.\n\nIn recent years, a few arbitral tribunals have sought to expand the scope and content of the \"full protection and security\" clause beyond protection from physical injury, and have interpreted it to apply to unjustified administrative and legal actions taken by a government or its subdivisions that injured an investment\u2019s alleged legal rights. It is on these decisions that the Claimants rely, particularly *CME v. the Czech Republic99 and Azurix Corp. v. Argentina.100* For example, in *CME,* which Claimants cite in support of their argument, the tribunal stated: \"The host State is obligated to ensure that neither by amendment of its laws nor by actions of its administrative bodies is the agreed and approved security and protection of the foreign investor\u2019s investment withdrawn or devalued.\"101\n\n*Supra* note 78.76\n\n*Supra* note 71.\n\n*Supra* note 78 at para. 613.\n\n161.\n\nHowever, the precedential effect of the **CME** case might be reduced by the fact it was not a unanimous decision, and that the tribunal did not conduct a detailed analysis of this particular point. Furthermore, as is well known, the tribunal in the **Lauder** case, which was very closely related to the **CME** case, reached a diametrically different conclusion. With respect to the application of the full protection and security clause in the U.S.-Czech BIT, the tribunal in **Lauder** held that. none of the facts alleged by the Claimants constitutes a violation by the Respondent of the obligation to provide full protection and security under the Treaty.\"102\n\n*Supra* note 77, at para.309.\n\n162.\n\nThe *CME* tribunal was interpreting Article 3(2) of the Netherlands-Czech Republic BIT, stipulating that \"each Contracting Party shall provide to such investments full security and protection\" (emphasis added). That treaty formulation is somewhat different from the BIT provisions applicable to the present case. Notably the Argentina-Spain BIT refers only to \"protect\" without the qualifying word \"full\" or \"fully,\" while the Argentina-France BITs states that investors shall be \"fully protected.\" Does the difference in formulation affect the scope of protection afforded by the BITs? The tribunal in *Azurix Corp. v. Argentina* implied that it did, for it justified on that basis a finding that the Argentina-United States BIT providing for \"full protection and security\" applied to measures taken by a government and was not limited to physical actions. It stated: \"However when the terms 'protection and security' are qualified by full and no other adjective or explanation, they extend, in their ordinary meaning, the content of this standard beyond physical security.\"103 Thus, *Azurix* seemed to suggest that the omission of \"full\" or \"fully,\" as is the case with the Argentina-Spain BITs in the present case, restricted the scope of protection only to physical security and protection. The tribunal in *Biwater* adhered to the same line of argument and noted that full protection and security \"implies a State\u2019s guarantee of stability in a secure environment, both physical, commercial and legal. It would in the Arbitral Tribunal\u2019s view be unduly artificial to confine the notion of \"full security\" only to one aspect of security, particularly in light of the use of this term in a BIT, directed at the protection of commercial and financial investments.\"104\n\n*Supra* note 71, at para. 408.\n\n*Biwater Gauff (Tanzania) Ltd. v. United Republic of Tanzania* (ICSID Case No. ARB/05/22), Award, (24 July 2008), at para. 729.\n\n163.\n\nOther tribunals have given less weight to the precise language used in the treaty when determining the scope of the full protection and security standard. For example, in *Parkerings v. Lithuania105* the tribunal found that: \"It is generally accepted that the variation of language between the formulation \u2018protection\u2019 and \u2018full protection and security\u2019 does not make a difference in the level of protection a State is to provide.\"106\n\n*Parkerings-Compangiet AS v. the Republic of Lithuania* (ICSID Case No. ARB/05/08), Award (August 14, 2007).\n\nPara. 354, citing Rubins N., Kinsella S., *International Investment, Political Risk and Dispute Resolution* (2005) to justify this proposition.\n\n164.\n\nWith regard to the Argentina-France BIT, Article 5(1), which provides that \"[i]nvestments made by investors of one Contracting Party shall be fully and completely protected and safeguarded in the territory and maritime zone of the other Contracting Party, in accordance with the principle of just and equitable treatment mentioned in Article 3 of this Agreement,\" the interpretation of this treaty provision raises questions as to the interplay and scope of the two standards of \"full and completely protected\" and \"fair and equitable treatment.\" If the Tribunal should find that a breach of the fair and equitable treatment standard has taken place, does that mean that a breach of the guarantee of full and complete protection has also taken place? Some tribunals in the presence of a formulation like the language employed in Article 5(1) quoted above have found that both breaches take place simultaneously.107\n\n*National Grid pic v. Argentine Republic* (UNCITRAL), Award (3 November 2008).\n\n165.\n\nThe present Tribunal, however, takes the view that under Article 5(1), quoted above, the concept of full protection and security is included within the concept of fair and equitable treatment, but that the scope of full protection and security is narrower than fair and equitable treatment. Thus State action that violates the full protection and security clause would of necessity constitute a violation of fair and equitable treatment under the Argentina-France BIT. On the other hand, all violations of fair and equitable treatment are not automatically also violations of full protection and security. Under the Argentina-France BIT, it is possible for Argentina to violate its obligation of fair and equitable treatment toward the Claimants without violating its duty of full protection and security. In short, there are actions that violate fair and equitable treatment that do not violate full protection and security.\n\n166.\n\nThe fact that the Argentina-France BIT employs the fair and equitable treatment standard and the full protection and security standard in two distinct articles and refers to them as separate and distinct standards leads to the conclusion that the Contracting Parties must have intended them to mean two different things. Thus in interpreting these two standards of investment treatment, it is desirable to give effect to that intention by giving the two concepts distinct meanings and fields of application.\n\n167.\n\nIn this respect, this Tribunal is of the view that the stability of the business environment and legal security are more characteristic of the standard of fair and equitable treatment, while the full protection and security standard primarily seeks to protect investment from physical harm. This said, this latter standard may also include an obligation to provide adequate mechanisms and legal remedies for prosecuting the State organs or private parties responsible for the injury caused to the investor.\n\n168.\n\nThe *Enron* tribunal discussed the more limited scope of the full protection and security standard by noting that \"there might be cases where a broader interpretation could be justified, but then it becomes difficult to distinguish such situation from one resulting in the breach of fair and equitable treatment, and even from some form of expropriation.\"108 Generally, this Tribunal also believes that an overly extensive interpretation of the full protection and security standard may result in an overlap with the other standards of investment protection, which is neither necessary nor desirable.\n\n*Supra* note 71, at para. 286; see also *PSEG Global et al. v. Republic of Turkey* (ICSID Case No. ARB/02/5), Award (19 January 2007), at para. 259.\n\n169.\n\nAs far as this Tribunal is concerned, it is inclined to think that the absence of the word \"full\" or \"fully\" in the full protection and security provisions in the Argentina-Spain BIT supports this view of an obligation limited to providing physical protection and related legal remedies for the Spanish Claimants and their assets.\n\n170.\n\nThe importance of the precise legal formulation used in a BIT provision is further illustrated in the *Siemens* award.109 In that case, the investor initiated the arbitration under the German-Argentina BIT, alleging *inter alia* that Argentina breached its obligation to accord full protection and security through the conduct that led to the frustration of the investor\u2019s contract. The respondent and the claimant had opposing positions on the scope of the protection under the BIT standard. According to Argentina, \"security\" implied only physical security, while the investor attributed to this term a wider meaning, in particular because the Treaty referred to \u2018legal security.\u2019 Thus, the Tribunal had to interpret whether \u2018security\u2019 referred merely to physical security or to security in a wider sense. Having noted that the definition of investment included tangible and intangible assets, the Tribunal said that \"the obligation to provide full protection and security is wider than \u2018physical\u2019 protection and security.\" It provided the following reasoning:\n\nIt is difficult to understand how the physical security of an intangible asset would be achieved. In the instant case, \"security\" is qualified by \"legal\". In its ordinary meaning \"legal security\" has been defined as \"the quality of the legal system which implies certainty in its norms and, consequently, their foreseeable application.\" It is clear that in the context of this meaning the Treaty refers to security that it is not physical. In fact, one may question given the qualification of the term \"security\", whether the Treaty covers physical security at all.\n\nArguably it could be considered to be included under \"full protection\", but that is not an issue in these proceedings. [\u00a7303]\n\nBased on this understanding of \u2018full protection and security\u2019, the tribunal concluded that Argentina\u2019s initiation of the renegotiation of the contract for the sole purpose of reducing its costs, unsupported by any declaration of public interest, affected the legal security of Siemens\u2019 investment, and thus constituted a violation of its obligations under the BIT. In the present case, neither of the BITs concerned refers to \"legal security.\" Therefore, this Tribunal is of the opinion that the formulations of protection and security employed in the present BITs do not extend to an obligation to maintain a stable and secure legal and commercial environment.\n\n*Supra* note 72\n\n171.\n\nWhile strict textual interpretation of the treaty language would lead this Tribunal to conclude that the applicable BITs in the present case do not have the expansive scope on which the Claimants are basing their claim, there is another reason for the Tribunal not to follow the interpretation made in, *inter alia, CME* and *Azurix.* Neither the *CME* nor *Azurix* awards provide a historical analysis of the concept of full protection and security or give any clear reason as to why it was departing from the historical interpretation traditionally employed by courts and tribunals and expanding that concept to cover non-physical actions and injuries.\n\n172.\n\nA few awards since *CME* have maintained the more traditional approach to interpreting the notion of full protection and security. In *Saluka,110* the tribunal determined that the Czech Republic did not violate the Czech Republic-Netherlands BIT which promised investors \"full security and protection\" when it took measures to stop trading in the claimant\u2019s securities. The tribunal stated: \"The practice of arbitral tribunals seems to indicate however that the \u2018full protection and security clause\u2019 is not meant to cover just any kind of impairment of an investor\u2019s investment but to protect more specifically the physical integrity of an investment against interference by the use of force.\"111 More recently, a similar rationale has been applied by arbitral tribunals in *BG v. Argentina, PSEG v. Turkey* and *Rumeli v. Kazakhstan.112*\n\n*Supra* note 75.\n\n*Ibid, at* para. 484.\n\n*BG Group Pic v. the Argentine Republic* (UNCITRAL), Award (24 December 2007), at paras. 323-328; *PSEG v. Turkey, supra* note 128, at paras. 258-259; *Rumeli v Kazakhstan, supra* note 98, at para. 669.\n\nC. *The Tribunal\u2019s Conclusions*\n-------------------------------\n\n173.\n\nHaving considered the specific language of both of the applicable BITs and the historical development of the \"full protection and security\" standard under international law, as well as the recent jurisprudence, this Tribunal is not persuaded that it needs to depart from the traditional interpretation given to this term. Consequently, the Tribunal concludes that under the applicable BITs, Argentina is obliged to exercise due diligence to protect investors and investments primarily from physical injury, and that in any case Argentina\u2019s obligations under the relevant provisions do not extend to encompass the maintenance of a stable legal and commercial environment. As a result, in the instant case Argentina has not violated its obligations under the respective BIT provisions.\n\n**VIII Responsibility for Failure to Accord Fair and Equitable Treatment**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nA. *The Applicable Treaty Provisions*\n-------------------------------------\n\n174.\n\nThe Claimants further allege that Argentina has breached the applicable BITs in that it has failed to accord the Claimants\u2019 investments \"fair and equitable treatment\" as required by the treaties. Specifically they assert that Argentina has breached Articles 3 and 5(1) of the Argentina France-BIT which provide:\n\nArticle 3\n\nEach Contracting Party shall undertake to accord in its territory and maritime zone just and equitable treatment, in accordance with the principles of international law, to the investments of investors of the other Party and to ensure that the exercise of the right so granted is not impeded either *de jure* or *de facto.*\n\nArticle 5(1)\n\nInvestments made by investors of one Contracting Party shall be fully and completely protected and safeguarded in the territory and maritime zone of the other Contracting Party, in accordance with the principle of just and equitable treatment mentioned in article 3 of this Agreement.\n\n175.\n\nThey also allege that Argentina has violated Article IV(1) of the Argentina-Spain BIT:\n\n*Article IV TREATMENT*\n\nEach Party shall guarantee in its territory fair and equitable treatment of investments made by investors of the other Party\n\n176.\n\nThe applicable BITs require Argentina to accord \"fair and equitable\" (Argentina-Spain BIT) or \"just and equitable\" treatment (Argentina-France BIT) to the investments of the Claimants. For purposes of this case, the Tribunal finds that \"fair and equitable\" treatment and \"just and equitable treatment\" mean the same thing, and it therefore will use the term \"fair and equitable treatment\" to refer to both treaty formulations of the standard. The Tribunal notes however that the relevant provision of the Argentina-France BIT differs from that of the Argentina-Spain BIT in that Article 3 of the former BIT requires the Contracting Parties to accord to protected investments \"...just and equitable treatment, in accordance with the principles of international law...\" *traitement juste et \u00e9quitable, conform\u00e9ment aux principes du droit international... \"un tratamiento justo y equitativo conforme a los principios de Derecho Internacional...* \"), but that the Argentina-Spain BIT does not include a similar reference to \"the principles of international law.\" None of the Parties in either their written or oral pleadings has suggested that this difference in treaty language requires the Tribunal to give a different meaning to the fair and equitable standard in applying the Argentina-France BIT from that reached in applying the Argentina-Spain BIT. The Respondent has argued, however, that the reference to \"the principles of international law\" in the Argentina-France BIT explicitly limits the content of the fair and equitable treatment obligation to the international minimum standard and that such limitation is also implicit in the Argentina-Spain BIT.113 The Respondent\u2019s argument raises two questions that the Tribunal must answer: 1) Does the reference in the Argentina-France BIT to \"the principles of international law\" mean that the fair and equitable treatment standard is limited to the minimum international standard? and 2) Even though the Argentina-Spain BIT contains no specific reference to international law or the minimum international standard, should the term \"fair and equitable treatment\" in that BIT be also limited to the international minimum standard?\n\nRejoinder Memorial By the Argentine Republic, para. 764.\n\n177.\n\nAs this Decision will later discuss, the meaning of \"fair and equitable treatment\" has been the subject of extensive and differing commentary by scholars and arbitral tribunals. A threshold question in its interpretation concerns the legal sources to which a tribunal should look in applying the concept of fair and equitable treatment to a specific fact situation. A survey of practice and scholarship on this question reveals three views: 1) that fair and equitable treatment must be measured only against the minimum standard required by customary international law; 2) that it must be measured against international law including all sources; and 3) that it must be measured against an independent self-contained treaty standard.114 In making a decision on this question in the present case, the Tribunal is of course bound by the specific language of each of the applicable BITs. With respect to the Argentina-France BIT, it is to be noted that the text of the treaty refers simply to \"the principles of international law,\" not to \"the minimum standard under customary international law.\"\n\nOECD, *Fair and Equitable Treatment Standard in International Investment Law* (Working Paper on International Investment 2004/3, September 2004) p. 8.\n\n178.\n\nFollowing accepted principles of treaty interpretation, particularly Article 31(1) of the VCLT which requires that treaty terms be interpreted in accordance with their \"ordinary meaning,\" the Tribunal concludes that \"in accordance with the principles of international law\" means just what it says: that the tribunal is to interpret fair and equitable treatment under Article 3 of the Argentina-France BIT in accordance with all relevant sources of international and that it is not limited in its interpretation to the international minimum standard. The ordinary meaning of the words \"principles of international law\" is \"the legal principles derived from all sources of international law.\" Authoritative documents employing the term \"international law\" contain no implication that the term is limited to the international minimum standard and amply support the Tribunal\u2019s interpretation of the term \"international law.\" Thus, Article 38 of the Statute of the International Court of Justice states that the function of the Court is to \"decide in accordance with international law...\" and then proceeds in the broadest terms to list the basic sources of international law. Similarly, the Restatement (Third) of the Foreign Relations Law of the United States, para. 101, provides that \"international law...consists of rules and principles of general application dealing with the conduct of states and of international organizations and with their relations inter se, as well as with some of their relations with persons, whether natural or juridical.\" The Tribunal therefore rejects the Respondent\u2019s argument that the content of the fair and equitable treatment standard in the Argentina-France BIT is limited to the international minimum standard.\n\n179.\n\nWith regard to the Argentina-Spain BIT, there is even less plausible justification to limit the interpretation of fair and equitable treatment to the international minimum standard, as Article IV(1) of such treaty does not even contain a specific reference to the principles of international law. Consequently, the Tribunal rejects the Respondent\u2019s argument that the fair and equitable treatment standard as embodied in the Argentina-Spain BIT is implicitly limited by minimum international standard. The Tribunal also concludes that the reference to \"the principles of international law\" included in the Argentina-France BIT does not entail a different content in said treaty from that found in the Argentina-Spain BIT. In interpreting the words \"fair and equitable treatment\" and \"just and equitable treatment\" found in the two BITs and in applying them to determine the responsibility of the Respondent, the Tribunal is required to apply the principles of international law.\n\n180.\n\nThe term \"fair and equitable treatment\" has certain characteristics that must be recognized in applying it in this case. First, it is a vague and ambiguous expression on its face and is not defined in any of the treaties applicable to this case. Second, it has been widely used in hundreds of investment treaties throughout the world over the years with the result that numerous arbitral tribunals have interpreted and applied it to investor-State disputes arising in a wide variety of circumstances. Third, it is a flexible term that applies to all kinds of investments in all industries and economic endeavors.115 Indeed, it is invoked so often in contemporary investor-State arbitration that one scholar has labeled it \"an almost ubiquitous presence\" in investment litigation.116\n\nSee C. Schreuer, *Fair and Equitable Treatment in Arbitral Practice,* 6 JWIT 3, pp. 357-386.\n\nRudoph Dolzer, *Fair and Equitable Treatment: A Key Standard in Investment Treaties,* 39 The International Lawyer 87 (2005).\n\n181.\n\nA fourth important characteristic of the term is that its application is crucially dependent on an evaluation of the facts of each case. As the tribunal in *Mondev* pointed out \"[a] judgment of what is fair and equitable cannot be reached in the abstract; it must depend on the facts of the particular case\"117 Similarly, the tribunal in *Waste Management (II)* stated \"the standard is to some extent a flexible one which must be adapted to the circumstances of each case.\"118 A fifth and final characteristic, evidenced by its wide use, generality, and flexibility, is that the term \"fair and equitable treatment\" seems to be viewed by Contracting States as a basic standard of treatment to be accorded to investors. The fundamental purposes of investment treaties, as stated in their titles, are to promote and protect investments. Certainly, neither of those purposes could be achieved if treaties promised foreign investors treatment that was less than fair and less equitable. Indeed, to borrow the terminology of Hans Kelsen,119 it is no exaggeration to say that the obligation of a host State to accord fair and equitable treatment to foreign investors is the *Grundnorm* or basic norm of international investment law.\n\n*Mondev International Ltd. v. United States of America* (ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/99/2), Award, (11 October 2002), at para 118, 6 ICSID Reports 192,at para. 118.\n\n*Waste Management Inc. v. United Mexican States,* (ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/00/3) Award (30 April 2004), at para. 99.\n\nHans Kelsen, *The Pure Theory of Law* (1934).\n\n182.\n\nIn interpreting this vague, flexible, basic, and widely used treaty term, this Tribunal has the benefit of decisions by prior tribunals that have struggled strenuously, knowledgeably, and sometimes painfully, to interpret the words \"fair and equitable\" in a wide variety of factual situations and investment relationships. Many of these cases arose out of Argentina\u2019s economic crisis of 2001-2003. Although this tribunal is not bound by such prior decisions,120 they do constitute \"a subsidiary means for the determination of the rules of [international] law.\"121 Moreover, considerations of basic justice would lead tribunals to be guided by the basic judicial principle that \u2018like cases should be decided alike,\u2019 unless a strong reason exists to distinguish the current case from previous ones. In addition, a recognized goal of international investment law is to establish a predictable, stable legal framework for investments, a factor that justifies tribunals in giving due regard to previous decisions on similar issues. Thus, absent compelling reasons to the contrary, a tribunal should always consider heavily solutions established in a series of consistent cases.\n\nArticle 53(1) of the ICSID Convention states: \u2018The award shall be binding on the parties...\u2019 Schreuer suggests that this provision may be interpreted as \"...excluding the applicability of the principle of binding precedent to successive ICSID cases.\" He also notes that there is nothing in the preparatory work of the Convention suggesting that the doctrine of precedent should be applied to ICSID arbitration. C Schreuer, *A Doctrine of Precedent?\u2019* in P. Muchlinksi *et al* The Oxford Handbook of International Investment Law (2008) 1190.\n\nStatute of the International Court of Justice, Article 38(1)(d).\n\nB. *The Claimants\u2019Position*\n---------------------------\n\n183.\n\nThe Claimants assert that Argentina failed to accord their investments fair and equitable treatment as required by the applicable BITs. Drawing on several arbitral decisions, many of which arose out of the Argentine crisis, as did the present dispute, the Claimants argue that the principle of fair and equitable treatment protects foreign investors from the fundamental alteration of the investment framework which defeats the investor\u2019s legitimate expectations. The bedrock concepts advanced by the Claimants are that Argentina actions: (1) made fundamental alterations of the investment framework; and (2) defeated the legitimate expectations of the Claimants as investors. They argue that Argentina actively encouraged the Claimants to invest in the water and sewage systems of the Province of Santa Fe and that important elements of that inducement were the various commitments that the Province made to them in the legal framework governing the investment. For the Province to make unilateral, fundamental alterations in that framework and thereby frustrate the legitimate expectations of the Claimants is a denial of the fair and equitable treatment that Argentina promised to accord to investors in the BITs applicable to this dispute. They note that fair and equitable treatment is separate from the international minimum standard which in any case also sanctions conduct altering the investment framework in breach of legitimate investor expectations. Bad faith or malicious intent by a respondent State is not required to establish violation of the fair and equitable treatment standard.\n\n184.\n\nAs noted above in the discussion of the alleged measures of expropriation, the Claimants point in particular to three general areas in which Argentina\u2019s actions violated fair and equitable treatment with respect to the Claimants\u2019 investments: 1) the Province\u2019s failure to assure respect for the equilibrium principle and to revise the Concession\u2019s tariff in accordance with its legal framework, thereby altering the legal framework of the investment contrary to the Claimants\u2019 legitimate expectations; 2) the Province\u2019s efforts to force the renegotiation of the Concession Contract; and 3) Province\u2019s unilateral termination of the Concession Contract in 2006. The Tribunal will consider each of these three types of actions in turn.\n\n**1. Failure to Revise Tariff**\n-------------------------------\n\n185.\n\nThe Claimants assert that Argentina took numerous measures in 2002 that were fundamental alterations of the investment framework contrary to their legitimate expectations. These measures include in summary: (i) the Province\u2019s delays in responding to and ultimately its repeated rejections of APSF\u2019s requests for a tariff revision pursuant to the regulatory framework122; (ii) the Province\u2019s abandonment of the tariff regime, particularly its refusal to increase tariffs in response to the devaluation of the Peso as required by the Concession Contract, and imposing an onerous renegotiation process, subject to numerous extensions in order to modify the Concession\u2019s Regulatory Framework;123 (iii) halting renegotiations and imposing more onerous operating conditions upon APSF as a condition for recommencing negotiations;124 iv) requiring APSF to observe all obligations under the relevant contractual and regulatory frameworks and to commit its reduced revenues to expansion while it was operating at a loss;125 and (v) insisting that APSF fulfill all investment obligations, commit to additional investments, and to increase its capital.126\n\n*E.g.* Resolution 55/02 of 1 March 2002, confirmed by Decree 391/02 of 18 March 2002 (Exh.

H-490).\n\n186.\n\nThe Claimants also allege that Argentina placed a disproportionate and discriminatory burden on APSF, contrary to its duty to actively protect the Claimants\u2019 investments under the fair and equitable treatment standard. For example, the Province granted 129% increases in tariffs to the provincially owned electricity company.\n\n**2. Imposed Renegotiation**\n----------------------------\n\n187.\n\nThe Claimants also assert that numerous actions taken during the imposed process to renegotiate the APFS Concession violated the Respondent\u2019s obligation to accord the Claimants\u2019 investments fair and equitable treatment. According to the Claimants, the Province took numerous actions to use this process to force changes in the Concession Contract against the will of the Claimants actions taken during this process, which became increasingly harsh and abusive and that ultimately its purpose was to drive APSF and the Claimants from the Province.\n\n**3. Unilateral Termination of the Concession**\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n188.\n\nThe Claimants also assert that the abrupt termination by the Province of the Concession in 2006 violated the Respondent\u2019s treaty promises of fair and equitable treatment. Specifically, they argue that the Province\u2019s unilaterally and under false pretences terminated the Concession without compensation, ignoring its responsibility for the repudiation of the Equilibrium Principle. They point to the fact that after the termination the Province created a provincial owned company (ASSA) to operate the water and sewage system and that the Province has subsidized that new company company\u2019s deficit of over 1.3 million pesos in 2006 and has in addition provided it with 42 million pesos in investment funds, in contrast to its previous assertions of an inability to revise the tariff for reasons of financial stringency. They allege that under the fair and equitable treatment standard, the Province and Argentina were required actively to protect the Claimants and their investments but that instead, the Province refused to cooperate with APSF and its shareholders for over four years, and then terminated the Concession unilaterally and without any regard for the losses incurred by APSF and its shareholders. In particular, Provincial authorities refused APSF\u2019s request to transfer services to another operator and prevented Claimants from transferring their shares to local investors. Having driven APSF into liquidation, the Province unilaterally terminated the Concession127 and refused to provide any compensation to the Claimants for the loss of their investment while abusively calling the performance bond.128\n\nDecree 243/06, 31 January 2006 (Exh. H-518).\n\nENRESS Resolution 513/06, 11 October 2006 (Exh. H-581).\n\nC. *The Respondent\u2019s Position*\n------------------------------\n\n189.\n\nArgentina argues that the Claimants have not shown that its alleged acts and omissions amounted to conduct that falls below the fair and equitable treatment standard\u2019s threshold. Moreover, it denies that its actions toward the Claimants\u2019 investments violated the standard of fair and equitable treatment. Argentina asserts that it fulfilled its obligations in the light of the circumstances of the case. In any event, even if there were a failure to comply with the Concession Contract, such shortcoming would not amount to unfair and inequitable treatment. A showing of a treaty violation must be clear, but according to Argentina the Claimants\u2019 case fails to clearly establish such a finding. In addition they argue that while Claimants can invoke their shareholdings in APSF to establish that they have an investment for jurisdictional purposes, they cannot seek the substantive protection of the BITs with respect to a contractual relationship to which they are not a party.\n\n190.\n\nArgentina argues that the Tribunal must analyze the conduct of the parties, taking into account all the circumstances of the case. In view of all the circumstances, it asserts that the Province acted in a reasonable, responsible, non discriminatory and proportionate manner in the light of its responsibility to the population within APSF\u2019s Concession area in the extraordinary economic circumstances that prevailed, the provision of drinking water and sewage services being of the highest of public purposes. It therefore argues that all the measures it took during the financial crisis were within its police powers as a sovereign State. Specifically, with respect to the termination of the Concession, Argentina asserts that the Province acted reasonably in the circumstances, that the Claimants had declared their intention to abandon the Concession, and that the Province had a responsibility to assure the continuation of a public service that was vital to the health and well-being of its population.\n\n191.\n\nSecondly, Argentina argues that its actions were entirely foreseeable and that it therefore did not frustrate the legitimate expectations of the investors. According to Argentina, it was foreseeable that the Argentine government would adopt special measures in the event of a crisis, that in a crisis situation Argentina would seek to renegotiate concession contracts and that in the face of the Claimants\u2019 threat to abandon the Concession it would have to take measures to assure the continuation of a vital public service. Further, regarding the Claimants\u2019 legitimate expectations, Argentina argues that if the State made any representations or commitments, it was to APSF and not to its shareholders. The fair and equitable standard cannot generate expectations that have no grounding in the contractual documents regulating the relation between the State and the investor. Since there were no extra contractual guarantees regarding automatic tariff adjustment either to APSF or to the Claimants, it was wholly unreasonable for the Claimants to expect that the Republic would endorse a massive tariff increase given the severity of the crisis. As discussed by the *ad hoc* committee in *MTD v. Chile,129* and as confirmed in *MCI v. Ecuador,130* the *Tecmed131* standard that converts investor\u2019s expectations into international obligations is questionable.\n\n*MTD Equity Sdn. Bhd.and MTD Chile S.A. v. Republic of Chile* (ICSID Case No. ARB/01/7), Decision on Annulment (21 March 2007), at para. 67.\n\n*M.C.I. Power Group L.C. and New Turbine Inc. v.Republic of Ecuador* (ICSID Case No. ARB/03/6), Award (July 31, 2007) at para. 278.\n\n*T\u00e9cnicas Medioambientales TECMED S.A. v. United Mexican States* (ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)00/2), Award (29 May 2003).\n\n192.\n\nWith respect to the efforts to renegotiate the Concession Contract in light of the crisis, Argentina contends that the Province acted reasonably and that APSF and the Claimants were unreasonable and uncooperative during that process. Indeed, it asserts that the Claimants had decided even before the crisis to extricate themselves from the Concession because it was insufficiently profitable.\n\n193.\n\nIn general, Argentina asserts that the renegotiation process was open and transparent. It did not entail an obligation of result but simply one of means. It also pursued an equitable outcome. Toward this end, Argentina made concessions and proposals to APSF to resolve their dispute.\n\nD. *Analysis*\n-------------\n\n194.\n\nIn order to evaluate the arguments of the Claimants and the Respondent, this Tribunal must interpret and apply the above-quoted BIT provisions concerning Argentina\u2019s obligations to accord covered investments fair and equitable treatment. In this task, it is guided by Article 31(1) of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties pursuant to which: \"(1) [a] treaty shall be interpreted in good faith in accordance with the *ordinary meaning* to be given the terms of the treaty *in their context* and in *light of its object and purpose\"* (emphasis added).Thus three elements are of particular importance in interpreting the relevant treaty provisions: (1) the ordinary meaning of the term \"fair and equitable,\" (2) the context in which the term \"fair and equitable\" is used; and (3) the object and purpose of the two relevant BITs.\n\n195.\n\nAn effort to determine the ordinary meaning of \"just\" or \"fair and equitable treatment\" does not result in an answer of great precision and specificity. At the outset, it should be noted that neither of the BITs applicable to this case define the three key words: \"fair,\" \"equitable,\" and \"treatment.\" \"Treatment,\" according to the Oxford English Dictionary, is \"Conduct, behaviour; action or behaviour towards a person.\" In its Decision on Jurisdiction in this case, the Tribunal stated the following with respect to the meaning of \"treatment:\" \"The word \"treatment\" is not defined in the treaty text. However, the ordinary meaning of that term within the context of investment includes the rights and privileges granted and the obligations and burdens imposed by a Contracting State on investments made by investors covered by the treaty.\"132 The Tribunal will continue to employ that definition for purposes of this decision on the merits of the Claimants\u2019 case. It should also be noted that under the terms of the two BITs the subject of the promised fair and equitable treatment is not the investor, but rather the investments made by the investor.\n\nSuez, Sociedad General de Aguas de Barcelona S.A., and InterAguas Servicios Integrales del Agua S.A., Decision on Jurisdiction, May 16, 2006, at para. 55.\n\n196.\n\nDefining the words \"fair and equitable,\" given their generality, vagueness, and the diverse ways in which those terms may be understood in various cultures and countries creates an especially difficult challenge. As the tribunal in *Saluka* stated after making its own strenuous efforts in this regard:\n\nThe \"ordinary meaning\" of the \"fair and equitable treatment\" standard can only be defined by terms of almost equal vagueness. In *MTD,* the tribunal stated that: \"In their ordinary meaning, the terms \"fair\" and \"equitable\" [... ] mean \"just\", \"even handed\", \"unbiased\" \"legitimate.\" On the basis of such and similar definitions, one cannot say more than the tribunal did in *S.D. Myers* by stating that an infringement of the standard requires \"treatment in such an unjust or arbitrary manner that the treatment rises to a level that is unacceptable from an international perspective.133\n\nAs a result, analyzing the ordinary meaning of the terms \"fair and equitable treatment\" as they are used in the two BITs applicable to the present dispute yields little additional enlightenment.\n\n*Supra* note 75, at paragraph 297.\n\n197.\n\nThe context of the term \"fair and equitable\" largely depends upon the contents of the treaty in which it is employed. Thus, the term must be interpreted not as three words plucked from the BIT text but within the context of the various rights and responsibilities, with all their various conditions and limitations, to which the Contracting Parties agreed. However, conducting such analysis *in abstracto,* namely without addressing specific relations between specific provisions of the BITs, would not take us further than the analysis of the ordinary meaning of the terms \"fair and equitable\".\n\n198.\n\nAnd finally, following the directives of Article 31(1) of the VCLT, the Tribunal must take account of the objects and purposes of the applicable BITs. Here, one must turn to the BIT preambles which express those objects and purposes. Each of the two BITs states those objects and purposes in slightly different language with slightly different emphasis. For example, the Preamble of the Argentina-France BIT states:\n\nDesiring to develop economic cooperation between the two States and to create favorable conditions for French investments in Argentina and Argentine investments in France,\n\nConvinced that the promotion and protection of such investments are likely to stimulate transfers of capital and technology between the two countries in the interest of their economic development...\n\nThus the purpose of the treaty is not merely to protect investments but to advance economic cooperation between France and Argentina and to achieve economic development of the two states by stimulating transfers of capital and technology.\n\n199.\n\nThe Preamble of the Argentina-Spain BIT provides as follows:\n\nDesiring to intensify economic cooperation for the economic benefit of both countries,\n\nIntending to create favorable conditions for investments made by investors of either State in the territory of the Other State,\n\nRecognizing that the promotion and protection of investments in accordance with this Agreement will encourage initiatives in this field...\n\nHere, too, the BIT seeks broad objectives beyond just investor protection in that its stated goal is to intensify economic cooperation between the two states so that both states may benefit from that economic intensification.\n\n200.\n\nWhen one examines the stated purposes of both BITs, one sees that they have broader goals than merely granting specific levels of protection to individual investors. In the case of Argentina-France BIT and the Argentina-Spain BIT, the Contracting States are seeking to further economic cooperation between them. The protection and promotion of foreign investment, while important to attaining that goal, are only a means to that end. The Contracting States through these treaties pursue the broader goals of heightened economic cooperation between the two States concerned with a view toward achieving increased economic prosperity or development. The Tribunal must take those broader goals into consideration when it interprets and applies the term \"fair and equitable treatment\" in this case.\n\n201.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that the goal of \"economic cooperation,\" stated in the Argentina-France and the Argentina-Spain BITs, reaffirms and indeed strengthens, rather than diminishes, the importance of \"fair and equitable treatment\" in the treaty structure created by the Contracting Parties. The word cooperation, interpreted by reference to its Latin origins, means the action of working together. Economic cooperation refers to working together in the economic domain. Implicit in the notion of economic cooperation between States is the commitment to give fair and equitable treatment to important economic actors, such as investors, of a Contracting Party with which a State has committed to cooperate. Indeed, it is difficult to see how cooperation in the economic and investment domain could ever take place unless such fair and equitable treatment is accorded by each State to protected investors and investments from the other state. Thus, this Tribunal considers that fair and equitable treatment of investments is the *sine qua non* of the economic cooperation envisaged by France, Spain, and Argentina in the two BITs applicable to this case.\n\n202.\n\nWhat, then, is the meaning of \"fair and equitable treatment\" with respect to the investments undertaken by the Claimants? Philosophers and scholars have devoted tomes to the subject of fairness.134 While their work is helpful in understanding the abstract concept and its implications, it does not answer a fundamental and practical question that every arbitral tribunal must answer: By what criteria, standard, or test is an arbitral tribunal to determine whether the specific treatment accorded to the investments of a particular foreign investor in a given context is or is not \"fair and equitable.\"? To say that \"fair and equitable\" means \"just,\" \"even-handed,\" \"unbiased,\" or \"legitimate,\" as some tribunals have done,135 is quite frankly to state a tautology. Such formulations are not judicially operational in the sense that they lend themselves to being readily applied to complex, concrete investment fact situations, like those found in the present case.\n\nSee, e.g. John Rawls, *Justice as Fairness* (2001); Thomas Franck, *Fairness in International Law* (1995).\n\nSee for example the tribunal in *MTD v. Chile (supra* note 129) stating the standards as follows \"... in terms of the BIT, fair and equitable treatment should be understood to be treatment in an even-handed and just manner, conducive to fostering the promotion of foreign investment.\" para. 113; approved by the Annulment Committee, Decision on Annulment, 21 March 2007, para. 71 (\"Thirdly, a standard formulated in the terms of paragraph 113 is defensible.\")\n\n203.\n\nIn an effort to develop an operational method for determining the existence or nonexistence of fair and equitable treatment, arbitral tribunals have increasingly taken into account the legitimate expectations that a host country has created in the investor and the extent to which conduct by the host government subsequent to the investment has frustrated those expectations. When an investor undertakes an investment, a host government through its laws, regulations, declared policies, and statements creates in the investor certain expectations about the nature of the treatment that it may anticipate from the host State. The resulting reasonable and legitimate expectations are important factors that influence initial investment decisions and afterwards the manner in which the investment is to be managed. The theoretical basis of this approach no doubt is found in the work of the eminent scholar Max Weber, who advanced the idea that one of the main contributions of law to any social system is to make economic life more calculable and also argued that capitalism arose in Europe because European law demonstrated a high degree of \"calculability.\"136 An investor\u2019s expectations, created by law of a host country, are in effect calculations about the future.\n\nMax Weber, *Economy and Society* 847, 855 (1922). See also David Trubek, *\"Max Weber and the Rise of Capitalism\"* Wisconsin Law Review 720-53 (1971) and Richard Swedberg, *\"Max Weber\u2019s Contribution to the Economic Sociology of Law\"* 2 Annu. Rev. Law Soc. Sci..61-81 (2006).\n\n204.\n\nWhere a government through its actions subsequently frustrates or thwarts those legitimate expectations, arbitral tribunals have found that such host government has failed to accord the investments of that investor fair and equitable treatment. For example in *Saluka,* the tribunal stated:\n\nAn investor\u2019s decision to make an investment is based on an assessment of the state of the law and the totality of the business environment at the time of the investment as well as on the investor\u2019s expectation that the conduct of the host State subsequent to the investment will be fair and equitable.\n\nThe standard of \u2018fair and equitable treatment\u2019 is therefore closely tied to the notion of legitimate expectations which is the dominant element of that standard.\n\nBy virtue of the \"fair and equitable treatment\" standard included in [the treaty] the Czech Republic must therefore be regarded as having assumed an obligation to treat foreign investors so as to avoid the frustration of investors\u2019 legitimate and reasonable expectations.137\n\n*Supra* note 75, at paras.301-302.\n\n205.\n\nMany other tribunals have also linked the concept of fair and equitable treatment to the host State\u2019s respect of the legitimate expectations which the investor had at the time of the investment. For example, in the *Tecmed* award, cited by subsequent cases,138 the tribunal stated:\n\nThe Arbitral Tribunal considers that this provision of the Agreement, in light of the good faith principle established by international law, requires the Contracting Parties to provide to international investments treatment that does not affect the basic expectations that were taken into account by the foreign investor to make the investment.\n\nIt is true that certain elements of the *Tecmed* standard have come under criticism for being too broad. Yet, its main components, and especially the importance of the parties\u2019 legitimate and reasonable expectations have been confirmed in later decisions. For example, the Annulment Committee in *MTD v. Chile,* which questioned certain aspects of *Tecmed,* specifically stated: \"...legitimate expectations, generated as a result of the investor\u2019s dealings with the competent authorities of the host State may be relevant to the application of the guarantees contained in an investment treaty.\"139 The *MTD* Annulment Committee criticized the *Tecmed* decision for its \"apparent reliance on the foreign investor\u2019s expectations as the source of the host State\u2019s obligations (such as the obligation to compensate for expropriation)\" as being \"questionable,\" stating the obvious fact in any investor-State dispute under a BIT that \"[t]he obligations of the host State towards foreign investors derive from the terms of the applicable investment treaty and not from any set of expectations investors may have or claim to have.\"140 In the present case, this Tribunal affirms that the source of Argentina\u2019s obligations toward the Claimants reside only in the BITs and that the Tribunal\u2019s task is to interpret the nature and scope Argentina\u2019s obligation to accord the Claimants\u2019 investments \u2018fair and equitable treatment\" within the context of the facts presented in this case.\n\n*E.g. LG&E supra* note 56, at para. 127; *MTD supra* note 129, at para 114; *Occidental supra* note 63 at para. 185; *CMS supra* note 64, at para 279.\n\n*Supra* note 129 at para. 69.\n\n*Ibid* at para. 67.\n\n206.\n\nOther tribunals have also taken into account investor expectations in interpreting the fair and equitable treatment standard. For instance, the tribunal in *Bayindir v. Pakistan* noted that:\n\n\"The Tribunal agrees with Bayindir when it identifies the different factors which emerge from decisions of investment tribunals as forming part of the FET standard. These comprise the obligation to act transparently and grant due process, to refrain from taking arbitrary or discriminatory measures, from exercising coercion or from frustrating the investor's reasonable expectations with respect to the legal framework affecting the investment\"141\n\n*Bayindir v. Pakistan,* para. 141, and references cited therein.\n\n207.\n\nIn examining the various cases that have justifiably considered the legitimate expectations of investors and the extent to which the host government has frustrated them, this Tribunal finds that an important element of such cases has not been sufficiently emphasized: that investors, deriving their expectations from the laws and regulations adopted by the host country, *acted in reliance upon those laws and regulations and changed their economic position as a result.* Thus it was not the investor\u2019s legitimate expectations alone that led tribunals to find a denial of fair and equitable treatment. It was the existence of such expectations created by host country laws, coupled with the act of investing their capital in reliance on them, and a subsequent, sudden change in those laws that led to a determination that the host country had not accorded protected investments fair and equitable treatment.\n\n208.\n\nIn the instant case, it should be emphasized that the expectations of the Claimants with respect to their investment in the water and sewage system of Santa Fe did not suddenly and surprisingly come into their minds the way Athena sprang from the head of Zeus. Argentina through its laws, the treaties it signed, its government statements, and especially the elaborate legal framework which the Province designed and enacted, deliberately and actively sought to create those expectations in the Claimants and other potential investors in order to obtain the capital and technology that it needed to revitalize and expand the Province\u2019s water and sewage system.\n\n209.\n\nHowever, in keeping with the BITs\u2019 basic goal of fostering economic, one must not look single-mindedly at the Claimants\u2019 subjective expectations. The Tribunal must rather examine them from an objective and reasonable point of view. It must ask a fundamental question: What would have been the legitimate and reasonable expectations of a reasonable investor in the position of the Claimants, at the time they made their investment in 1995, about a proposed water and sewage concession investment that was to continue over a period of thirty years in Argentina, in view of the Concession\u2019s legal framework and bearing in mind that country\u2019s history and its political, economic, and social circumstances?\n\n210.\n\nOf course, a Contracting Party under a BIT\u2019s fair and equitable treatment standard is not required to satisfy all of an investor\u2019s expectations. It is required to respect only those expectations that are legitimate and reasonable in the circumstances. What specifically are the characteristics of such expectations? The tribunal in *LG&E v. Argentina* tried to answer that question. It stated: \"It can be said that the investor\u2019s fair expectations have the following characteristics: they are based on the conditions offered by the host State at the time of the investment; they may not be established unilaterally by one of the parties; they must exist and be enforceable by law; in the event of infringement by the host State, a duty to compensate the investor for damages arises except for those caused in the event of state of necessity; however, the investor\u2019s fair expectations cannot fail to consider parameters such as business risk or industry\u2019s regulatory patterns.\"142\n\n*LG&E supra* note 56, at para. 130.\n\n211.\n\nIn a similar vein, the tribunal in *Duke v. Ecuador* stated that \"[t]he stability of the legal and business environment is directly linked to the investor\u2019s justified expectations. The Tribunal acknowledges that such expectations are an important element of fair and equitable treatment. At the same time, it is mindful of their limitations. To be protected, the investor\u2019s expectations must be legitimate and reasonable at the time when the investor makes the investment. The assessment of the reasonableness or legitimacy must take into account all circumstances, including not only the facts surrounding the investment, but also the political, socioeconomic, cultural and historical conditions prevailing in the host State. In addition, such expectations must arise from the conditions that the State offered the investor and the latter must have relied upon them when deciding to invest.\"143\n\n*Duke Energy Electroquil Partners and Electroquil SA. v. Republic of Ecuador* (ICSID Case No. ARB/04/19), Award (18 August 2008), at para. 340.\n\n212.\n\nThe Concession Contract and the legal framework of the Concession described above clearly meet the conditions proposed in the cases just referred to. They set down the conditions offered by the Province at the time that Claimants made their investment; they were not established unilaterally but by the agreement between the Provincial authorities and the Claimants; and they existed and were enforceable by law. Like any rational investor, the Claimants attached great importance to the tariff regime stipulated in the Concession Contract and the regulatory framework. Indeed, their ability to make a profit was crucially dependent on it. The importance of the tariff regime was underscored even before the bidding took place, as shown *inter alia* by the \"clarifying circulars *(circulares aclaratorias)* issued by the Province in response to questions raised by bidders concerning the terms of the Article 11.4.4.2 of the Model Contract concerning tariff revisions, particularly with respect to changes in exchange rates and financial costs.144 These expectations of the Claimants were later included in the Concession Contract, a document which certainly reflects in detail the Claimants\u2019 legitimate expectations, as well as those of the Province. In view of the central role that the Concession Contract and legal framework placed in establishing the Concession and the care and attention that the Province devoted to the creation of that framework, the Claimants\u2019 expectations that the Province would respect the Concession Contract throughout the thirty-year life of the Concession was legitimate, reasonable, and justified. It was in reliance on that legal framework that the Claimants invested substantial funds in the Province of Santa Fe. And the Province certainly recognized at the time it granted the Concession to the Claimants that without such belief in the reliability and stability of the legal framework the Claimants - indeed no investor - would ever have agreed to invest in the water and sewage system of Santa Fe.\n\nSee *e.g.* Circular Aclaratoria No. 10, dated 10 April 1995 (Exh. C-45).\n\n**1. Santa Fe\u2019s Refusal to Revise the Tariff**\n----------------------------------------------\n\n213.\n\nSanta Fe\u2019s persistent refusal to revise the tariff in accordance with the legal framework and the Concession Contract frustrated the expectations of the Claimants. Beyond the specific words and commitments of the regulatory framework and the Concession Contract, the Claimants, having entered into a thirty-year relationship with the Province, were entitled to expect that the Provincial authorities would manage that relationship in a cooperative manner, that is to say, that they would \"work together\" so that the relationship was mutually advantageous. Indeed, Article 4.1 of the Concession Contract required the Concessionaire and the Regulatory Entity \"...to use all means at their disposal to establish and maintain a fluid relationship that facilitates the performance of the Contract.\"145 In effect, the legal framework seemed to envision a relationship between the Concessionaire and the Provincial authorities that would be a concrete example of the economic cooperation that the BITs sought to promote. During the first six years, such a cooperative relationship seemed to prevail. With the economic crisis and subsequent changes in government and in policies, that cooperative relationship clearly evaporated and all signs of fluidity disappeared. Indeed, as is further discussed below, the Provincial authorities demonstrated extreme rigidity in their dealings with APSF and the Claimants.\n\n\"El Concesionario y el Ente Regulador deber\u00e1n arbitrar todos los medios a su alcance para establecer y mantener una relaci\u00f3n fluida que facilite el cumplimento del Contrato.\"\n\n214.\n\nThe Respondent\u2019s argument that the Claimants should have expected that in the context of an economic and financial crisis Argentina would act as it did in the light of the history of economic instability of the country is not compelling. It was largely because of the country\u2019s history of instability that the Claimants required the incorporation of the specific clauses on extraordinary tariff adjustment reviews mentioned above. Moreover, a country cannot persuasively allege its historic instability to avoid its responsibility to foreign investors, when it specifically endeavored to remove this disincentive to foreign investment by providing specific assurances in a Concession Contract and in bilateral investment treaties. Indeed, one can say without exaggeration that Argentina\u2019s various actions toward foreign investments and investors in the 1990s were intended to overcome its negative economic history in the minds of the international financial and business community.\n\n215.\n\nMoreover, there is strong evidence that the Province might have employed more flexible means that would have protected both its interests and those of the Claimants. For example, if the Province\u2019s concern was to avoid an increase in tariffs during a time of crisis, it might have relieved APSF, at least temporarily, of investment commitments that were placing a crippling burden on the Concession so long as tariffs did not increase. If Santa Fe\u2019s concern was to protect the poor from increased tariffs, it might have allowed tariff increases for other consumers while applying a social tariff or a subsidy to the poor, a solution clearly permitted by the regulatory framework. Indeed, Article 81 of the Water Law and Article 11.5.3 of the Concession Contract specifically recognized the possibility of setting the tariff levels to take account of social objectives, in which case the Concessionaire was to be compensated for the resulting reduction of revenues. APSF suggested these options on several occasions to the Provincial Authorities,146 but none of them were accepted. In short, there appears to have been very little desire or effort after the outbreak of the crisis for Argentina to \"work together\" with APSF and the Claimants. On the contrary, there is evidence that Provincial authorities engaged in a public criticisms of APSF, an effort that had the effect of diminishing public willingness to pay APFS invoices in view of the clear suggestion that APSF\u2019s future was in question. At the same time, by contrast, the Provincial authorities demonstrated a clear desire to cooperate with the provincially-owned electric company by authorizing an increase in electricity tariffs of 129%.147 Beginning in late 2001, the Province experienced significant and sustained economic growth148 and by 2002 Provincial finances ceased to be in deficit.149 Once the crisis had ended and economic growth returned to the Argentine economy, the government showed no greater willingness to find a way to work together with APSF and the Claimants. While Argentina seems to suggest that there was nothing else that the Province could have done in its relationship with APSF and the Claimants, the Tribunal is not persuaded that an amicable solution could not have been reached.\n\n*E.g.* Letter from APSF to the Governor of Santa Fe, dated 19 March 2002 (Exh. C-94); Letter from APSF to ENRESS, dated 12 February 2002 (Exh. C-88); Letter from APSF to the Renegotiation Commission, dated 11 December 2002 (Exh. C-109).\n\nTranscript(English) D3:P676:L15-14.\n\nStatistics of the *Instituto Provincial de Estad\u00edsticas y Censos',* Claimants\u2019 Post-Hearing Brief, para. 179.\n\nTestimony of Walter Alfredo Agosto, Minister of Economy of Santa Fe, Transcript (English) D4:p984:L19-P985:L15.\n\n216.\n\nIn interpreting the concept of fair and equitable treatment, the Tribunal must also bear in mind that the Concession by its terms was subject to the regulatory authority of the Province, which had a reasonable right to regulate. Thus in interpreting the meaning of \"just\" or \"fair and equitable treatment\" to be accorded to investors, the Tribunal must balance the legitimate and reasonable expectations of the Claimants with Argentina\u2019s and particularly the Province\u2019s right to regulate the provision of a vital public service. As the *Saluka* tribunal stated, \"[t]he determination of a breach of Article 3.1 by the Czech Republic [which required fair and equitable treatment of investors] therefore requires a weighing of the Claimant\u2019s legitimate and reasonable expectations on the one hand and the Respondent\u2019s legitimate regulatory interests on the other.\"150 What this means in the context of the present case is that the legitimate and reasonable expectations of the investors in APSF must have included the expectation that the Provincial government would exercise its legitimate regulatory interests with respect to the APSF Concession throughout the period of thirty years and in response to unpredictable circumstances that might arise during that time.\n\n*Supra* note 75, at para. 306.\n\n217.\n\nThere is no question that under the legal framework Argentina and the Province had the right to regulate the activities of the Concession concerning a broad range of matters, including the tariff structure, investment standards, and performance. But APSF and the Claimants, as participants in any regulated industry, had the legitimate expectation that the Argentine authorities would exercise that regulatory authority and discretion within the rules of the detailed legal framework that the Province had established for the Concession. But when faced with the crisis, Santa Fe refused to do so. It still refused once the crisis had abated. Indeed, it enacted various measures directing the regulatory authorities not to respect important elements of the legal framework. These measures, which followed the adoption by the Argentine Federal Government of Emergency Law No. 25,561, in January 2002, include Decree 221/02 of 1 March 2002,151 ENRESS Resolution 55/02 of 1 March 2002,152 Decree 391/02 of 18March 2002,153 ENRESS Resolution 116/02, of 27 March 2002,154 Decree 1252/02 of 13June 2002,155 the letter from the Renegotiation Commission to APSF, of 23 August 2002,156 Decree 3789/02 of 30 December 2002,157 Decree 1855/03, of 11 July 2003,158and Decree 2362/04, of 18 November 2004159. Such actions, considered together and in the light of the legal framework governing the Concession, particularly in connection with tariff adjustment, were outside the scope of Santa Fe\u2019s legitimate right to regulate and in effect constituted an abuse of regulatory discretion.\n\nExh. C-90.\n\nExh. C-89.\n\nExh. C-93.\n\nExh. C-95.\n\nExh. C-100.\n\nExh. C-105.\n\nExh. C-115.\n\nExh. C-123.\n\nAnnex R-137.\n\n218.\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, this Tribunal finds that the Province\u2019s persistent and rigid refusal to revise the tariff in accordance with the Concession Contract and the regulatory framework, particularly once the crisis had abated and economic growth returned, violated its commitments under both BITs to treat the Claimants\u2019 investments fairly and equitably.\n\n**2. Santa Fe\u2019s Measures to Renegotiate the Concession**\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n219.\n\nThe Claimants also assert that Argentina denied them fair and equitable treatment when it forced them to engage in a renegotiation of the Concession. The Claimants allege that the Province unilaterally imposed a renegotiation process starting in 2002 and that they could not oppose such process. Argentina, on the other hand, argues that APSF had participated and indeed had requested previous renegotiation before the crisis, that it agreed to participate in the renegotiation process begun in 2002, and also that it did not object to that process.\n\n220.\n\nThere is reason to believe that APSF did willingly participate at first in the renegotiation process and that, while it might have objected to the process, in fact it did not. However, the Tribunal does not believe that these factors override the argument that, taken as a whole, Santa Fe\u2019s treatment of the Claimants during that process was unfair and inequitable, or that by participating in the process without objection the Claimants somehow waived their right under the treaty to fair and equitable treatment by Argentina. Indeed, if APSF had refused to participate in the renegotiation process launched by the provincial government, APSF might have been accused of failing to meet the requirements of Article 4.1 of the Concession Contract, quoted above, requiring parties \"...to use all means at [its] disposal to establish and maintain a fluid relationship that facilitates the performance of [the] Contract.\"\n\n221.\n\nIn examining the nature of the renegotiation process, the Tribunal finds that it differs significantly from the various revisions or renegotiation processes provided by the Concession\u2019s legal framework and from the Concession renegotiations and revisions, mentioned in paragraph 39 above, in which APSF had previously participated.\n\n222.\n\nIn light of the severity of these measures, the Tribunal questions whether the process thus established constituted a genuine \"renegotiation\" or whether it was actually an effort to compel fundamental changes in the Concession under that label. The essence of a renegotiation is that the parties freely agree to revise or amend an existing agreement. As the tribunal in *Enron* stated, \"[a]ny process of negotiation requires of course that the parties genuinely agree on the outcome and this cannot be imposed or forced upon one party\"160 It appears that Santa Fe sought to structure the \"renegotiation\" process in such a way as to severely limit or indeed curtail the contractual freedom of APSF in order to arrive at a predetermined result desired by the provincial authorities. Indeed, through measures such as Decree 221/02 of 1 March 2002,161 Decree 391/02 of 18 March 2002,162 ENRESS Resolution 116/02 of 27 March 2002,163 Decree 1252/02 of 13 June 2002,164 Decree 3789/02 of 30 December 2002,165 Decree 1855/03, of 11 July 2003,166 Resolution 313/03, of 11 November 2003,167 ENRESS Resolutions 125/04 and 126/04, of 4 March 2004,168 Resolution 174/04, of 9 August 2004,169 Decree 2362/04, of 18 November 2004,170 Resolution 50/05, of 15 March 2005,171 and the letter from the Province to APSF of 7 February 2005,172 considered all together and under the factual circumstances of the case, the Province unfairly curtailed APSF\u2019s reasonable freedom to negotiate the terms of the Concession Contract. In the opinion of the Tribunal, such a process cannot in fairness be said to constitute a renegotiation as that term is generally understood. It was certainly not the kind of renegotiation or revision process that APSF and the Claimants were led to expect by the legal framework of the Concession and the events of the first six years of the Concession.\n\n*Supra* note 71, at para. 186\n\nExh. C-90..\n\nExh. C-93.\n\nExh. C-95.\n\nExh. C-100..\n\nExh. C-115.\n\nExh. C-123.\n\nExh. C-128.\n\nExh.s C-134 and C-135, respectively.\n\nExh. C-140.\n\nAnnex R-137.\n\nExh. C-319.\n\nExh. C-291.\n\n223.\n\nThe Tribunal finds that Argentina\u2019s treatment of APSF and the Claimants during the renegotiation process that began in 2002 was a breach of its promise of fair and equitable treatment under both BITs in question. It finds support for this conclusion in the decision in *BG Group* v. *Argentina,* in which the Tribunal noted, in this regard, that \"Argentina also breached the international minimum standard in relation to UNIREN\u2019s authorization to renegotiate the Government agreements with public service providers. As stated at paragraph 80 above, the Emergency Law and subsequent legislation were enacted to promote a new deal with the licensees, impeding the application and execution of the original Regulatory Framework.\"173\n\n*Supra* note 112, para. 309.\n\n**3. Santa Fe\u2019s Termination of the Concession**\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n224.\n\nSanta Fe\u2019s termination of the Concession was abrupt, and its reasons for such action are not completely clear. The Province not only ended the Concession but it also demanded payment of the Performance Bond posted by the Claimants to guarantee APSF\u2019s performance and later refused to pay APSF the value of its unamortized investments received by the Province as a result of the termination.\n\n225.\n\nOn the other hand, the Tribunal is not unmindful of the difficult position in which the Province found itself as a result of the Claimants\u2019 own request to terminate the Concession in the fall of 2005. Santa Fe\u2019s refusal to allow a termination of the Concession at that time was no doubt prompted in part by the fact that, while it had the ultimate responsibility to provide vital water and waste water services to the population of the Province, it was not in position at that time to actually assume operational responsibility for those services. At that time and in those circumstances, it was not beyond the realm of possibility from the Province\u2019s perspective that the Claimants might abruptly quit the country, leaving an unprepared Provincial government to provide a basic service to fifteen cities in a large metropolitan area. It is likely that Santa Fe felt that it had to prepare for that eventuality while still causing APSF to provide the needed service under the Concession. Thus, to a certain extent it may be said that APSF\u2019s request to terminate the Concession may have been a factor in prompting the Province\u2019s decision to act suddenly to terminate the Concession itself a few months later. At the same time, it must be noted that it was the actions of the Provincial authorities in refusing to revise the tariff according to the legal framework and in forcing a renegotiation of the Concession - actions which this Tribunal has judged to be a violation of the fair and equitable standard - that put the Claimants in the position where they felt that had to give up the Concession.\n\n226.\n\nArgentina\u2019s termination of the Concession was done pursuant to its Concession Contract with APSF. This Tribunal, as stated above, has no jurisdiction to judge whether Argentina\u2019s termination of the Concession breached the Concession Contract. Whether the Province breached the Concession Contract by terminating it is a matter for the dispute resolution procedures provided in the Concession Contract itself. In viewing the circumstances as a whole and the situation that existed at the time of the termination, the Tribunal finds that the record is insufficient to establish that Argentina\u2019s treatment of the Claimants\u2019 investments in terminating the Concession attained the level of violating the fair and equitable standards required by either one of the applicable BITs.\n\nE. *The Tribunal\u2019s Conclusions.*\n--------------------------------\n\n227.\n\nThe Tribunal concludes that the Province\u2019s actions in refusing to revise the tariff according to the legal framework of the Concession and in pursing the forced renegotiation of the Concession Contract contrary to that legal framework violated its obligations under the applicable BITs to accord the investments of the Claimants fair and equitable treatment. The date of both breaches can reasonably be deemed to be 18 March 2002, the date of Decree 391/02 by which the Province formally refused to revise the tariff, which APSF had been requesting during the previous two months. It can be considered as the first of a series of measures, when considered together, which frustrated the legitimate expectations of the Claimants and thus amounted to a violation of the fair and equitable treatment standards in the BITs.\n\n228.\n\nA State may violate an investment treaty\u2019s fair and equitable treatment standard in many ways and with many differing consequences. The majority\u2019s finding in the present case that Argentina\u2019s various actions violated the fair and equitable treatment standard by frustrating the Claimants\u2019 legitimate and reasonable expectations is by no means a rejection of the conclusions of our esteemed colleague Professor Nikken in his separate opinion to the effect that Argentina failed to exercise due diligence in certain elements of its treatment of the Claimants\u2019 investments. The majority agrees that Argentina failed to exercise due diligence, as that concept is generally understood, and that such failure resulted in a violation of the treaties\u2019 fair and equitable treatment standard. As discussed earlier in this Decision, the Tribunal finds that Argentina\u2019s actions also frustrated the Claimants\u2019 legitimate expectations and it has concluded that it is more appropriate to base its decision on that rationale.\n\n**IX Argentina\u2019s Defense of Necessity**\n---------------------------------------\n\nA. *The Nature of the Defense*\n------------------------------\n\n229.\n\nArgentina argues that even if certain of its actions may have breached individual BIT provisions applicable to this case it is absolved of liability by virtue of the defense of necessity under customary international law. Both the Claimants and Argentina agree that the current state of the law on the defense of necessity is reflected in Article 25 of the International Law Commission\u2019s (ILC) Articles on the Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts (2001), which provides as follows:\n\n**Article 25 Necessity**\n\n1. Necessity may not be invoked by a State as a ground for precluding the wrongfulness of an act not in conformity with an international obligation of that State unless the act:\n\na) Is the only way for the State to safeguard an essential interest against a grave and imminent peril; and\n\n(b) Does not seriously impair an essential interest of the State or States towards which the obligation exists, or of the international community as a whole.\n\n2. In any case, necessity may not be invoked by a State as a ground for precluding wrongfulness if:\n\n(a) The international obligation in question excludes the possibility of invoking necessity; or\n\n(b) The State has contributed to the situation of necessity.\n\nIt is to be noted that the ILC Articles do not define the nature of the necessity defense in positive terms. Rather they limit themselves to stating the situations in which the defense of necessity may *not* be raised.\n\nB. *Argentina\u2019s Position*\n-------------------------\n\n230.\n\nArgentina argues that it took the actions it did affecting the Claimants\u2019 investments out of the necessity of dealing with the financial crisis in order to safeguard essential interests of the State. It alleges that the crisis did not result from its own actions but from the crises that had previously struck other parts of the world, namely the financial and economic emergencies in Indonesia, Mexico, Brazil, and Russia. In order to protect its essential interests, it had to take the various measures that it did and that no other means of protecting those interests were available to it.\n\n231.\n\nIn support of its contentions, it cites the Decision on Liability in *LG&E v. Argentina* in which the tribunal accepted Argentina\u2019s defense of necessity, stating:\n\nThe essential interests of the Argentine State were threatened in December 2001.\n\nIt faced an extremely serious threat to its existence, its political and economic survival, to the possibility of maintaining its essential services in operation and to the preservation of its internal peace. There is no serious evidence in the record that Argentina contributed to the crisis resulting in the state of necessity. In these circumstances an economic recovery package was the only means to respond to the crisis. Although there may have been a number of ways to draft the economic recovery plan, the evidence before the Tribunal demonstrates that an across-the-board response was necessary, and the tariffs on public utilities had to be addressed.174\n\n*Supra* note 56 at para. 257.\n\n232.\n\nArgentina argues that it adopted the measures in order to safeguard the human right to water of the inhabitants of the country. Because of its importance to the life and health of the population, Argentina states that water cannot be treated as an ordinary commodity. Because of the fundamental role of water in sustaining life and health and the consequent human right to water, it maintains that in judging the conformity of governmental actions with treaty obligations this Tribunal must grant Argentina a broader margin of discretion in the present case than in cases involving other commodities and services. In order to judge whether a treaty provision has been violated, for example the provision on fair and equitable treatment, Argentina argues that this Tribunal must take account of the context in which Argentina acted and that the human right to water informs that context.\n\nC. *The Claimants\u2019 Position*\n----------------------------\n\n233.\n\nThe Claimants reject Argentina\u2019s defense of necessity as not being grounded in either law or fact. According to the Claimants\u2019 interpretation of the ILC Articles and customary international law, three conditions must be present before a State may invoke necessity as a defense to liability for an international obligation: 1) the possibility of invoking the defense must not be excluded by the international obligation that the State is seeking to avoid; 2) the State must not have contributed to the situation of necessity; and 3) the State\u2019s measures in question must have been the only way for the state to safeguard an essential interest against a grave or imminent risk. Moreover, the Claimants remind the Tribunal of the admonition of the International Court of Justice in the *Gabcikovo-Nagymaros Project Case* that Article 25 \"...is a most exceptional remedy subject to the very strict conditions because otherwise it would open the door to elude any international obligation.\"175\n\n*Gabcikovo-Nagymaros Project* (Hungary/Slovakia) Judgment, 25 September 1997, ICJ at paras. 51-52.\n\n234.\n\nClaimants further argue that in fact Argentina satisfies none of the three conditions necessary to invoke the defense of necessity. They assert that the BITs in question were intended to protect investors in times of economic difficulties and thus excluded the invocation of the doctrine of necessity. Secondly, they argue that by its policies and actions Argentina contributed to the economic crisis that struck the country, thus further preventing it from raising the defense of necessity. And finally, they assert that the measures Argentina took to deal with the crisis, and of which the Claimants complain, were not the only means to safeguard an essential interest of the country from a grave or imminent peril. Indeed it argues that while the crisis was severe it did not compromise the existence of the State, as Argentina argues, and did not constitute a threat to an essential interest. Moreover the crisis was not a grave and imminent peril as evidenced by the fact that the Argentine economy began to recover in the second quarter of 2002. Further, the Claimants assert that there were a variety of other measures that Argentina and the Province might have taken with respect to the Concession, such as cross subsidies, temporary relief of APSF\u2019s investment obligations, or differentiated freezing of certain tariffs among different categories of consumers, which would have allowed it to deal with the crisis and still respect its commitments to APSF\u2019s investors.\n\nD. *Analysis*\n-------------\n\n235.\n\nThe crisis into which Argentina fell in 2001-2003 was undoubtedly one of the most severe in its history. It was characterized by extreme social disturbance, riots, violence, and almost total breakdown of the political system. Evidence in the record in the present case clearly shows its severity. Previous tribunals deciding disputes arising out of the crisis have also recognized and underscored its severity. For example, the tribunal in *CMS v. Argentina,* which would ultimately deny Argentina\u2019s plea of necessity, stated that it was \"convinced that the crisis was indeed severe and the argument that nothing happened is not tenable.\"176 The tribunal in *LG&E* v. *Argentina* found that \"... from 1 December 2001 until 26 April 2003, Argentina was in a period of crisis during which it was necessary to enact measures to maintain public order and to protect its essential security interests,\"177 describing the conditions in the country at the time as \"devastating.\"178\n\nPara. 320.\n\nPara. 226.\n\nPara. 237.\n\n236.\n\nThe severity of a crisis, no matter the degree, is not sufficient to allow a plea of necessity to relieve a state of its treaty obligations. The customary international law, as restated by Article 25 of the ILC Articles, quoted above, imposes additional strict conditions. The reason of course is that given the frequency of crises and emergencies that nations, large and small, face from time to time, to allow them to escape their treaty obligations would threaten the very fabric of international law and indeed the stability of the system of international relations. It is for this reason that the International Court of Justice, other tribunals, and scholars have warned of the defense\u2019s exceptional nature and of the strict conditions surrounding its application.\n\n237.\n\nArticle 25 imposes four conditions on the application of the defense of necessity. The first two relate to the nature of the State\u2019s act in violation of its obligations. Thus such act (1) must be the only way for it to safeguard an essential interest from grave and imminent peril and (2) must not seriously impair an essential interest of the State toward which the obligation exists or toward the international community as a whole. The other two conditions relate to the nature of the international obligation affected by such act and the contribution of such state in causing the situation of necessity. Thus, the third condition is that the obligation in question must not exclude the possibility of the defense of necessity and the fourth condition is that the State must not have contributed to the situation of necessity. We examine each of these four conditions within the context of the present case.\n\n238.\n\n*The first condition for the defense of necessity: Only way to safeguard an essential interest.* The provision of water and sewage services to the Province of Santa Fe certainly was vital to the health and well-being of a large population and was therefore an essential interest of the Argentine State and of the Province. On the other hand, the Tribunal is not convinced that the only way that Argentina and the Province could satisfy that essential interest was by adopting measures that would subsequently violate the treaty rights of the Claimants\u2019 investments to fair and equitable treatment. As discussed above, the Province could have attempted to apply more flexible means to assure the continuation of the water and sewage services to the people of Santa Fe and at the same time respected its obligations of fair and equitable treatment. The two were by no means mutually exclusive. Thus the Tribunal finds that Argentina has not satisfied the first condition for the defense of necessity.\n\n239.\n\n*The second condition for the defense of necessity: Non-impairment of other more important interests.* In failing to accord the Claimants\u2019 investments fair and equitable treatment, Argentina may have injured the Claimants\u2019 interests, but it is difficult to see how Argentina\u2019s and the Province\u2019s actions impaired an essential interest of France, Spain, or the international community. The Tribunal therefore finds that Argentina has satisfied the second condition for the defense of necessity.\n\n240.\n\n*The third condition for the defense of necessity: Treaty obligation does not exclude the necessity defense.* The texts of the two BITs in question do no specifically exclude or allow the admissibility of a defense of necessity. The *LG&E* case, upon which Argentina relies, involved the application of the U.S.-Argentina BIT which contained a clause stating that nothing in the treaty precluded a Contracting Party from taking \"...measures necessary for the maintenance of public order, the fulfillment of its obligations with respect to the maintenance or restoration of international peace or security, or the protection of own essential security interests\"179 Neither of the BITs applicable to the present case contains such a \"non-precluded measures clause.\"180 Argentina has suggested that its human rights obligations to assure its population the right to water somehow trumps its obligations under the BITs and the existence of the human right to water also implicitly gives Argentina the authority to take actions in disregard of its BIT obligations. The Tribunal does not find a basis for such a conclusion either in the BITs or international law. Argentina is subject to both international obligations, *i.e.* human rights *and* treaty obligations, and must respect both of them. Under the circumstances of this case, Argentina\u2019s human rights obligations and its investment treaty obligations are not inconsistent, contradictory, or mutually exclusive. Thus, as was discussed above, Argentina could have respected both types of obligations. Viewing each treaty as a whole, the Tribunal does not find that any of them excluded the defense of necessity. Therefore Argentina must be deemed to have satisfied the third condition for the defense of necessity.\n\nArticle XI.\n\nSee WW Burke-White & A von Staden, \u2018Investment Protection in Extra-Ordinary Times: The Interpretation and Application of Non-Precluded Measures Provisions in Bilateral Investment Treaties\u2019 48 *Virginia J of Inti L* 307 (2008).\n\n241.\n\n*The fourth condition for the defense of necessity: Non-contribution to the situation of necessity.* To invoke the defense of necessity, a State must not have contributed to its situation of necessity. The operative word of this condition is \"contribute\", not \"cause\" or \"create.\" Thus, the fact that other actors, besides the State in question, may have contributed to that State\u2019s situation of necessity does not automatically mean that such State has not contributed to it. The Commentary to the ILC Articles makes it clear that such contribution must \"...be sufficiently substantial and not merely incidental or peripheral.\" Thus, an important question is whether Argentina contributed to the crisis of 2001-2003 to an extent sufficiently substantial to rule out a necessity defense in compliance with international law. This being said, the Claimants in their pleadings viewed the crisis as created primarily by endogamous factors, primarily the economic policies of various Argentine governments. The Respondent, on the other hand, portrayed the crisis as caused by exogenous factors, primarily the various global crises, such as the one which struck Russia in 1999.\n\n242.\n\nThe Tribunal finds that a combination of endogenous and exogenous factors contributed to the Argentine crisis at the beginning of this century. Among Argentina\u2019s contributing factors to the crisis were excessive public spending, inefficient tax collection, delays in responding to the early signs of the crisis, insufficient efforts at developing an export market, and internal political dissension and problems inhibiting effective policy making. In listing these factors, the Tribunal does not by any means intend to minimize the substantial external forces that were buffeting the Argentine economy. Its intent is to show that Argentina itself contributed to its situation of emergency. In this regard, this Tribunal must agree with the tribunal in *CMS v. Argentina,* which stated that \"[t]he issue, however, is whether the contribution to the crisis by Argentina has or has not been sufficiently substantial. The Tribunal, when reviewing the circumstances of present dispute, must conclude that this was the case. The crisis was not of the making of one particular administration and found its roots in the earlier crisis of the 1980s and evolving governmental policies of the 1990s that reached a zenith in 2002 and thereafter. Therefore, the Tribunal observes that government policies and their shortcomings significantly contributed to the crisis and the emergency and while exogenous factors did fuel additional difficulties they do not exempt the Respondent from its responsibility in the matter.\"181 One might also suggest if external, global factors alone had created Argentina\u2019s crisis, it is surprising that other countries did not experience a crisis of equal magnitude at the time.\n\nPara. 329.\n\n243.\n\nIn sum then, the Tribunal denies Argentina\u2019s plea of the defense of necessity against the Claimants\u2019 claims of BIT violations, because Argentina\u2019s and the Province\u2019s measures in violation of the BITs were not the only means to satisfy its essential interests and because Argentina itself contributed to the emergency situation that it was facing in 2001-2003.\n\n**X Further Procedure; Cost and Expenses**\n------------------------------------------\n\n244.\n\nThe Tribunal has decided to render a decision on liability before arriving at an award on damages. It has chosen to adopt this procedure for reasons of judicial economy. Given the complexity of this case and the extraordinarily voluminous nature of the record, the Tribunal by rendering a decision on liability now and thereby defining the scope of its investigation with respect to a determination of damages will be able more efficiently to define the mission of the independent expert that will assist the Tribunal in this determination.\n\n245.\n\nThe Tribunal is aware that a bifurcation of the merits phase of an ICSID case into determination of liability and a determination of damages is not common. On the other hand, the ICSID Rules do not preclude such an approach. Indeed, Article 44 of the ICSID Convention, which this Tribunal invoked to allow the withdrawal of APSF as a party to this dispute, specifically states: \"If any question of procedure which is not covered by this Section or the Arbitration Rules or any rules agreed upon by the parties, the Tribunal shall decide the question.\" The Tribunal relies on Article 44 in deciding on bifurcating the merits phase of this case for the reasons outlined above.\n\n246.\n\nThe Tribunal has specifically asked the advice of the parties with respect to the selection and role of an independent expert on damages in this case, and the parties have responded in the post-hearing submissions. The Tribunal will take account of the parties\u2019 views in carrying out the damages phase of this case.\n\n247.\n\nBecause important procedural matters remain to take place in this case, the Tribunal defers any decision on costs and expenses until the completion of the damages phase of these proceedings.\n\n**XI The Tribunal\u2019s Conclusions with Respect to the Respondent\u2019s Liability**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n248.\n\nAfter examining the respective cases of the Claimants and the Respondent, the Tribunal:\n\na. Rejects the Claimants\u2019 claim that the Respondent has directly or indirectly expropriated the investments of the Claimants;\n\nb. Rejects the Claimants\u2019 claim that the Respondent has denied the Claimants\u2019 investments full protection and security;\n\nc. Finds that the Respondent has denied the Claimants\u2019 investments fair and equitable treatment;\n\nd. Rejects the Respondent\u2019s defense of necessity to the claims of the Claimants;\n\ne. Defers a decision on damages for breach of fair and equitable treatment and a decision on costs to the Tribunal\u2019s award on damages; and\n\nf.

REGISTRATION AND CONSTITUTION**\n------------------------------------\n\n4.\n\nArgentina submitted its Application on September 16, 2016. It also requested that enforcement of the Award be stayed until the Application was decided.\n\n5.\n\nOn September 21, 2016, the Secretary-General registered Argentina's Application. The Parties were also notified that the enforcement of the Award was provisionally stayed pursuant to Rule 54(2) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules.\n\n6.\n\nBy letter dated December 15, 2016, the Parties were notified that, in accordance with Rule 52(2) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules, an *ad hoc* Committee composed of Professor Donald M. McRae (a national of Canada and New Zealand), Tan Sri Dato' Cecil W.M. Abraham (a national of Malaysia), and Professor Doug Jones (a national of Australia and Ireland) (the \"**Committee**\") had been constituted. The Parties were also informed that Professor McRae would be the President of the Committee and Mr. Francisco Grob, Legal Counsel at ICSID, would serve as Secretary.\n\n**B. FIRST SESSION**\n--------------------\n\n7.\n\nAs agreed by the Parties, the first session of the Committee was held on February 1, 2017, by telephone conference (the \"**First Session**\").\n\n8.\n\nFollowing the First Session, the Committee issued on February 7, 2017, Procedural Order No. 1 concerning various procedural matters. The Parties confirmed, among others, that the 2006 ICSID Arbitration Rules would apply to the annulment proceedings.\n\n**C. STAY OF THE ENFORCEMENT**\n------------------------------\n\n9.\n\nBefore the First Session, the Parties agreed on a schedule for written pleadings concerning the stay of enforcement of the Award.

No hearing was convened.\n\n11.\n\nOn June 21, 2017, the Committee issued its Decision on the Stay of Enforcement of the Award. The Committee lifted the stay without conditions and deferred the decision on costs to a later stage of the proceeding.\n\n**D.

THE ARBITRATION PROCEEDING**\n---------------------------------\n\n21.\n\nThe arbitration proceeding was heard by a tribunal composed of Professor Jeswald W. Salacuse (President), a national of the United States of America, Professor Gabrielle Kaufmann-Kohler, a national of Switzerland, and Professor Pedro Nikken, a national of Venezuela (the \"**Tribunal**\"). It concerned a series of measures adopted by Argentina in respect of the water and waste management concession held (indirectly) by the Claimants. An identically composed tribunal was constituted by agreement of the respective parties to hear the claims brought by two other Suez-led consortia in respect of water and waste management concessions for the cities of Buenos Aires and Cordoba. These other cases are *Suez et al v. Argentina*, ICSID Case No. 03/18, *Suez et al v. Argentina*, ICSID Case No. 3/19 and *AWG v. Argentina*, an UNCITRAL (1976) proceeding (*Suez 3/18*, *Suez 3/19* and *AWG*, respectively). *Suez 3/18* was discontinued by agreement of the parties on January 24, 2007.2*Suez 3/19* and *AWG* were handled together by agreement of the parties and produced two awards. Argentina sought vacatur of the *AWG* award before US courts, an application that was denied by a decision issued on September 30, 2016.3 Meanwhile, Argentina requested the annulment of the *Suez 3/19* 's award. This application was also rejected by an ICSID committee in a decision rendered on May 5, 2017.4\n\nSee *Aguas Cordobesas S.A., Suez and Sociedad General de Aguas de Barcelona S.A. v.

DECISION ON JURISDICTION**\n-------------------------------\n\n22.\n\nIn its Decision on Jurisdiction of May 16, 2006, the Tribunal rejected all the objections raised by Argentina, except for one, which had become moot because of the discontinuance of the proceedings in respect of the claimant against which it was addressed. The Tribunal found the dispute to be of legal nature and to arise directly out of Claimants' investments in the water distribution and waste water services of the Province of Santa Fe in Argentina. It considered that the existence of a dispute settlement clause in the concession contract concluded by Aguas Provinciales de Santa Fe S.A. (\"**APSA**\"), an Argentinian corporation in which the Claimants had shares and other interests, and the Province of Santa Fe for the operation of the water services in that Province did not preclude the Claimants from bringing this arbitration based on breaches of the Argentina-France and the Argentina-Spain BITs. It also found that the Claimants Interagua and AGBAR were entitled, by operation of the most-favored-nation (\"**MFN**\") clause of the Argentina-Spain BIT, to avail themselves of the more favorable treatment of the Argentina-France BIT and did not, therefore, need to resort to the local courts of Argentina before initiating this arbitration.\n\n**C. DECISION ON THE DISQUALIFICATION PROPOSAL**\n------------------------------------------------\n\n23.\n\nBy a decision dated May 12, 2008, Professors Salacuse and Nikken, the two unchallenged members of the Tribunal, rejected Argentina's (second) proposal to disqualify Professor Kaufmann-Kohler. They found no conflict that could result in Professor Kaufmann-Kohler manifestly lacking independence and impartiality to hear this case. In their view, considering the size and scope of UBS's operations, the outcome of the arbitration would at best have a negligible financial effect on Suez and, consequently, an insignificant effect on UBS. Professor Kaufmann-Kohler's financial position would not thus be altered by the result of this arbitration in any material form. Nor did they believe that Professor Kaufmann-Kohler's nondisclosure of her UBS directorship demonstrated lack of independence or impartiality. They concluded that she was unaware of UBS's shareholdings in Suez and did not participate \"in the day-to-day management of the corporation.\"5 Moreover, she had reason to rely on the UBS's conflict review after having submitted a list of her arbitrations to the company for that purpose. They therefore rejected the disqualification proposal.\n\nDecision on a Second Proposal for the Disqualification of a Member of the Arbitral Tribunal (\"**Second Challenge Decision**\"), May 12, 2008, para. 39.\n\n**D. DECISION ON LIABILITY**\n----------------------------\n\n24.\n\nThe Tribunal determined in its Decision on Liability that Argentina did not expropriate Claimants' investment and did not deny them full protection and security under the applicable investment treaties. It did, however, conclude that Argentina denied the Claimants fair and equitable treatment (\"**FET**\") in that its \"...actions in refusing to revise the tariff according to the legal framework of the Concession and in pursuing the forced renegotiation of the Concession Contract contrary to that legal framework violated its obligations under the applicable BITs.\".6 Although the Claimants had argued that Argentina's unilateral termination of the Concession also violated their rights under the investment treaties, the Tribunal rejected that claim, stating that it had no jurisdiction to judge whether Argentina's actions breached the Concession Contract since \"[w]hether [Argentina] breached the Concession Contract by terminating it is a matter for the dispute resolution procedures provided in the Concession Contract itself.\"7 The Tribunal rejected Argentina's necessity defense, including its allegation that Article 5(3) of the Argentina-France BIT, as well as international law, exempted it from its BIT obligations during times of emergency.\n\nDecision on Liability, July 30, 2010, para. 227.\n\n*Ibid*., para. 226.\n\n**E. AWARD**\n------------\n\n25.\n\nThe Tribunal awarded damages for USD 211,661,453 to the Claimants, plus interest. This included damages to Suez for losses on guaranteed (sponsored) debt including contingency debt losses, equity, management fees, and loans to APSF; to AGBAR for losses on guaranteed debt including contingency debt losses, and equity; and to Interagua for losses on guaranteed debt including contingency debt losses, and equity. On the issue of costs, the Tribunal determined that each party should bear its own costs and that the cost of the proceedings shall be divided equally.\n\n**F. DECISION ON RECTIFICATION**\n--------------------------------\n\n26.\n\nUpon Claimants' request, the Tribunal corrected two errors in its calculation of losses with respect to one of the items, the so-called contingency debt. As a result, the total amount of the Award came to USD 225,696,464, plus interest.\n\n**V. THE PARTIES' POSITIONS ON THE INTERPRETATION OF ANNULMENT GROUNDS**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**A. THE SCOPE OF ANNULMENT**\n-----------------------------\n\n**a. Summary of Argentina's Position**\n--------------------------------------\n\n27.\n\nFor Argentina, the annulment mechanism is an essential part of the ICSID regime without which States would have been unlikely to join the ICSID Convention. Its essential purpose is to safeguard the integrity of the arbitral process in all its facets, including the integrity of the tribunal, the process and the award.\n\n28.\n\nAlthough annulment is not an appeal, as it does not authorize substituting the annulled decision with another, this does not mean that annulment grounds should be construed strictly. As with any other provision of the ICSID Convention, they must be interpreted in accordance with their ordinary meaning, in good faith, with due regard to context, and in the light of the object and purpose of the Convention.\n\n29.\n\nIn this case, the flaws of the underlying proceeding and Award could not have been addressed during the arbitration through the remedies of rectification, interpretation or supplementation. Rectification only allows a tribunal to \"rectify any clerical, arithmetical or similar error\"8; interpretation only enables a tribunal to clarify the \"meaning or scope of an award.\"9; and a supplemental decision is available \"only in the case of inadvertent omissions of a technical character but not in the case of a considered omission affecting a fundamental aspect of the tribunal's reasoning.\"10 None of the issues raised in this annulment proceeding fall within the limited scope of application of these remedies.\n\nICSID Convention, Article 49(2).\n\n*Ibid*., Article 50.\n\nArgentina's Reply, para. 10, citing to Christoph Schreuer *et al.*, *The ICSID Convention: A Commentary*, 2009, AL A RA 56, p. 860.\n\n30.\n\nArgentina's request is not frivolous or dilatory. Argentina has not sought annulment of all the ICSID awards rendered against it as the Claimants suggest. Also, where it has done so, its applications have been based on well-grounded reasons. That is why it has succeeded in annulling several awards.11 Even where the requests for annulment have been unsuccessful, committees have stopped short of finding Argentina's applications frivolous or dilatory.\n\nArgentina's Reply, para. 3. Argentina cites to the following decisions: *CMS Gas Transmission Company v. Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/01/8), Decision on Annulment, September 25, 2007, AL A RA 39; *Sempra Energy International v. Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/02/16), Decision on Annulment, June 29, 2010, AL A RA 40; *Enron Creditors Recovery Corp. & Ponderosa Assets, L.P. v. Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/01/3), Decision on Annulment, July 30, 2010, AL A RA 41.\n\n**b. Summary of Claimants' Position**\n-------------------------------------\n\n31.\n\nThe Claimants consider that Argentina misapprehends the proper scope and role of ICSID annulment proceedings. All its claims seek an impermissible *de novo* review of points on which it lost.\n\n32.\n\nAnnulment, however, is not an appeal. It is an extraordinary remedy reserved for \"egregious violations of certain basic principles\"12, which threaten the very legitimacy of the decisionmaking process. Article 52's annulment grounds provide a narrow exception to the principle that an ICSID tribunal's decision is final. These grounds are exhaustive and must be interpreted strictly, permitting no form of substantive review. Any complaint falling short of this exceptionally high standard cannot form the basis of an annulment.\n\nClaimants' Counter-Memorial, para. 71, citing *Tulip Real Estate and Development Netherlands BV v. Republic of Turkey* (ICSID Case No. ARB/11/28), Decision on Annulment, December 30, 2015, AL A RA 78, para. 39.\n\n33.\n\nAnnulment is premised on deference to a tribunal's decision. Therefore, even when a tribunal has committed errors of fact or law (which is not the case here), annulment committees cannot substitute their own views for those of the tribunal. Annulment is not a remedy against an incorrect decision.\n\n34.\n\nMoreover, not all annullable errors justify annulment. Article 52(3) of the Convention provides that \"[t]he Committee shall have the authority to annul the award\" if a ground under Article 52(1) is found to have been met.13 Article 52(3) does not require a committee to do so. Among other considerations, committees must assess whether an otherwise annullable error had a material impact on the outcome of an award before deciding whether to exercise its annulment powers.\n\nClaimants' Counter-Memorial, para. 73.\n\n**B. IMPROPER CONSTITUTION OF THE TRIBUNAL (ARTICLE 52(1)(A) OF THE ICSID CONVENTION)**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**a. Summary of Argentina's Position**\n--------------------------------------\n\n35.\n\nArticle 52(1)(a) of the ICSID Convention provides that either party may request annulment of an award on the basis \"that the Tribunal was not properly constituted.\" To determine this, regard must be had to Chapter IV, Section 2 of the ICSID Convention, which regulates the \"Constitution of the Tribunal\" (Articles 37 to 40). In accordance with Article 40, arbitrators must \"possess the qualities stated in paragraph (1) of Article 14.\" Such qualities are: (a) \"be persons of high moral character,\" (b) \"with recognized competence in the fields of law, commerce, industry or finance,\" and (c) \"who may be relied upon to exercise independent judgment. \"14 Article 57 of the ICSID Convention provides that a party may propose the disqualification of an arbitrator on account of any fact indicating \"the lack of the qualities required by of Article 14(1) of the ICSID Convention\" or \"on the ground that he was ineligible for appointment to the tribunal under Section 2 of Chapter IV.\"15\n\nArgentina's Reply, para. 19.\n\nArgentina's Memorial, paras. 28-34.\n\n36.\n\nThe text and context of Article 52(1)(a) make it clear that the manifest lack of the qualities required by Article 14(1) of the ICSID Convention authorizes a party to propose the disqualification of an arbitrator and, once the award is rendered, to request its annulment as a result of the improper constitution of the tribunal. So too does the object and purpose of the ICSID annulment procedure, which is to ensure the integrity of ICSID tribunals, and the principle of *effet utile* interpretation. If a party could not question the constitution of a tribunal under Article 52(1)(a), despite having timely submitted a disqualification proposal, then Article 52(1)(a) would be meaningless.\n\n37.\n\nSupplementary means of interpretation confirmed this conclusion. As Professor Schreuer has explained based on the preparatory works of the ICSID Convention, if a party requesting disqualification in the original arbitral proceeding is unsuccessful, its right to challenge the constitution of the tribunal as a ground for annulment under Article 52(1)(a) of the ICSID Convention \"remains unaffected.\"16\n\nArgentina's Reply, para. 23, citing Christoph Schreuer *et al.*, *The ICSID Convention: A Commentary*, 2009, AL A RA 56, Art. 52, para. 129.\n\n38.\n\nThis interpretation is also supported by case law. Unlike the incorrect approach followed by the *Azurix* decision, the *EDF* committee accepted that annulment is available where an arbitrator does not meet the qualifications required under Article 14(1) (it erred, however, in that it unduly limited the scope of review in deference to the unchallenged arbitrator's decision on the disqualification proposal, a restriction that is nowhere to be found in the ICSID Convention). The same can be said about the *Suez 3/19* committee's decision.\n\n39.\n\nAlthough the existence of a decision on disqualification in the original arbitration proceeding may be an element of judgment for the annulment committee when verifying the proper constitution of the tribunal, it is not binding on the committee nor should it limit its jurisdiction to determine the proper constitution of the tribunal. Article 52 of the ICSID Convention does not provide for any such limitation.\n\n40.\n\nIn addition, there is an \"essential difference\" between a request for annulment under Article 52(1)(a) and the other annulment grounds.17 Whether a tribunal is properly constituted is expressly subject to the decision of an annulment committee under Article 52(1)(a). The limitations imposed on an *ad hoc* committee in connection with the merits of the dispute are inapplicable to its analysis on this ground. While \"\u2018an *ad hoc* committee does not have the jurisdiction to review the merits of the original award,\u2019 insofar as \u2018[t]he annulment system is designed to safeguard the integrity, not the outcome, of ICSID arbitration proceedings,\u2019 as the guardian of \u2018the fundamental integrity of the ICSID arbitral process in all its facets,\u2019 \u2018[a]n *ad hoc* committee is empowered to verify [...] the integrity of the tribunal - its proper constitution (Article 52(1)(a)) [...].\u2019\"18\n\nArgentina's Reply, para. 27.\n\n*Ibid*., para. 29, citing *Hussein Nuaman Soufraki v. United Arab Emirates* (ICSID Case No. ARB/02/7), Decision on Annulment of June 5, 2007, AL A RA 51, paras. 20-23.\n\n**b. Summary of Claimants' Position**\n-------------------------------------\n\n41.\n\nClaimants contend that Argentina's Memorial proceeds on the wrong assumption that an annulment committee is empowered to determine, afresh, whether the requirements of Article 14(1) have been met, and, if not, the committee must annul the award under Article 52(1)(a). This approach ignores, however, that where an annulment committee is called to consider an arbitrator challenge that was decided during the underlying arbitration, the committee does not \"write on a blank sheet.\"19 Previous annulment committees have consistently held that, in such circumstances, a committee's scope of review is very limited. Two lines of authority have emerged from these decisions.\n\nClaimants' Counter-Memorial, para. 81, citing *EDF International SA and others v. Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No ARB/03/23), Decision on Annulment, February 5, 2016, AL A RA 67, para. 145.\n\n42.\n\nThe first approach is that followed by the annulment committee in *Azurix v. Argentina*. The *Azurix* committee held that the inquiry under Article 52(1)(a) is a purely procedural one, restricted to verifying whether the procedure for constituting a tribunal and for resolving a challenge to an arbitrator have been complied with. If they have, an annulment application cannot succeed. The second approach was articulated by the committee in *EDF v. Argentina*, later followed by the *Suez 3/19* committee. Under this approach, a committee may inquiry into the substance of a disqualification decision. However, annulment under Article 52(1)(a) or (d) is not possible \"unless the decision not to disqualify the arbitrator in question is so plainly unreasonable that no reasonable decision-maker could have come to such a decision.\"20\n\nClaimants' Counter-Memorial, para. 89, citing *EDF International SA and others v. Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No ARB/03/23), Decision on Annulment, February 5, 2016, AL A RA 67, para 145.\n\n43.\n\nContrary to Argentina's position, Article 14(1) does not empower an *ad hoc* committee to scrutinize a tribunal's handling of an arbitrator challenge, as if it were a matter of first impression. Article 14(1) says nothing about the standard of review to be applied by an annulment committee. This is to be found in the architecture of the ICSID system and in its object and purpose. As noted above, the annulment mechanism acts as a safeguard against \"egregious violations of certain basic principles\".21 The ICSID Convention charges the unchallenged members of the tribunal (or, in extraordinary circumstances, the Chairman of the Administrative Council) with responsibility for ensuring that only impartial, independent, and expert tribunals are constituted to hear claims. The purpose of this is that any challenge is resolved as early and efficiently as possible during the proceedings, rather than many years later, once an award is rendered. Neither Article 58 nor Article 52 contains any indication that an ICSID tribunal's power to resolve pre-award arbitrator challenges should be shared with (much less displaced by) an *ad hoc* committee. Raising an arbitrator challenge during the arbitration is not simply a procedural formality designed to preserve a party's ability to raise the argument once again during an annulment. A pre-award challenge is *the* opportunity for a party to present an arbitrator challenge and to have that challenge resolved on a full evidentiary record. That is why the *EDF* committee did not contradict itself by, on the one hand, acknowledging that it is possible for an award to be annulled under Article 52(1)(a) on the basis of an arbitrator's lack of the requisite qualities under Article 14(1), while on the other hand, holding that where a tribunal has previously decided an arbitrator challenge, an *ad hoc* committee cannot annul unless the tribunal's decision is \"plainly unreasonable\".22 Moreover, it is Argentina's interpretation of Article 52(1)(a) that runs contrary to the object and purpose of annulment in the ICSID system.\n\nClaimants' Rejoinder, para. 16; Claimants' Counter-Memorial para. 71, citing *Tulip Real Estate and Development Netherlands BV v. Republic of Turkey* (ICSID Case No ARB/11/28), Decision on Annulment, December 30, 2015, AL A RA 78, para. 39.\n\nClaimants' Rejoinder, para. 25, citing *EDF International SA and others v. Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No ARB/03/23), Decision on Annulment, February 5, 2016, AL A RA 67, para. 145.\n\n44.\n\nThis being clear, there is no need to resort to supplementary means of interpretation. The treaty text is neither ambiguous nor does it lead to absurd or unreasonable results. In any event, the supplementary sources that Argentina cites fail to support its view of Article 52(1)(a). The drafting history of Article 52 confirms that the Convention's framers did not intend for an annulment application under Article 52(1)(a) (or under any ground) to trigger *de novo* review so much so that the drafters of the Convention considered and rejected a proposal to permit annulment \"on the grounds that a member of the Tribunal lacked the qualities listed under Article 14(1)\" by 16 votes to 4.23\n\n*Ibid*., para. 22, citing *History of the ICSID Convention*, Volume II, Part 2, Documents 44-146 (1968), A RA 111, p. 852.\n\n45.\n\nArgentina's distinction between Article 52(1)(a) and all other grounds for annulment is flawed. There is no \"essential difference\" between them. Every issue addressed by Article 52 is \"expressly subject to the decision of the annulment committee\" and is likewise subject to a deferential standard of review.24\n\nClaimants' Rejoinder, para. 29.\n\n**C. MANIFEST EXCESS OF POWERS (ARTICLE 52(1)(B) OF THE ICSID CONVENTION)**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**a. Summary of Argentina's Position**\n--------------------------------------\n\n46.\n\nAccording to Argentina, a manifest excess of powers may relate to: (a) the scope of the tribunal's jurisdiction, (b) the applicable law, and (c) the issues raised by the parties.\n\n47.\n\nIn respect of the first category, Argentina contends that it does not propose a *de novo* review of the Tribunal's jurisdictional findings as the Claimants suggest. What it seeks is that the Committee examines whether the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers when it exercised jurisdiction in this case. Although this may require a degree of argumentation and analysis, it does not prevent a finding of manifest excess of powers.\n\n48.\n\nOn the second category, Argentina claims that it has not invoked an erroneous application of the law in the present case. Its application on this point is based on the Tribunal's failure to apply the law. Even so, annulment committees have accepted that an error of law may in some circumstances constitute a manifest excess of power under Article 52(1)(b) of the ICSID Convention where it is tantamount to a failure to apply the law, regardless of its general or specific nature. Examples can be found in the decisions of the *Enron* and *Sempra* committees. The former annulled the award because the tribunal failed to specify the legal standards applicable to the necessity defense, thus omitting to apply the applicable law, whereas the latter set aside the award \"on the basis of manifest excess of powers (Article 52(1)(b) of the ICSID Convention) in respect of failure to apply Article XI of the BIT\" invoked in this case.25\n\nArgentina's Reply, para. 42, citing *Sempra Energy International v. Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/02/16), Decision on the Argentine Republic's Application for Annulment of the Award, June 29, 2010, AL A RA 40, para. 159.\n\n49.\n\nWith respect to the third category, Argentina argues that both parties agree that a tribunal manifestly exceeds its powers where it decides questions not submitted to it or refuses to decide questions properly before it.\n\n**b. Summary of Claimants' Position**\n-------------------------------------\n\n50.\n\nFor the Claimants, annulment on any Article 52(1) ground requires a committee to conclude that an annullable error had a material impact on the outcome of a case, Article 52(1)(b) being no exception.\n\n51.\n\nContrary to Argentina's suggestions, an excess of powers cannot be \"manifest\" if it is discernible only through elaborate interpretation or requires a committee to decide between competing positions on a debatable legal issue. It must be obvious, self-evident, clear, flagrant and discernable without great effort or extensive analysis to satisfy this standard. An error of law, even a serious error of law, is not an excess of powers under Article 52(1)(b) let alone a manifest one.\n\n52.\n\nThe weight of authority agrees also that the manifest requirement applies equally to both jurisdictional and merits decisions. Thus, any suggestion that a jurisdictional error is by its very nature manifest must be rejected.\n\n53.\n\nTo find an excess of power for failure to apply the applicable law, there must have been a failure to apply the law *in toto*. ICSID annulment committees have consistently held that only a complete failure to apply the correct law may amount to a manifest excess of powers. The reason is very straightforward. As Professor Schreuer has put it, \"\u2018[p]artial nonapplication and erroneous application are indistinguishable\u2019 - and neither is a ground for annulment\".26 The decisions Argentina cites in support of this claim are no more than outliers in an otherwise constant jurisprudence.\n\nClaimants' Reply, para. 67, citing Christoph Schreuer *et al*, *The ICSID Convention: A Commentary*, 2009 (2nd Edition), A/CLA-61, p. 964.\n\n**D. SERIOUS DEPARTURE FROM A FUNDAMENTAL RULE OF PROCEDURE (ARTICLE 52(1)(D) OF THE ICSID CONVENTION)**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**a. Summary of Argentina's Position**\n--------------------------------------\n\n54.\n\nArgentina contends that Article 52(1)(d) means that a set of minimal standards of procedure must be observed in ICSID proceedings, which includes the right to an independent and impartial tribunal. These standards, however, are not confined to the rules of procedure provided for in the arbitration rules, but they also embrace principles of natural justice such as due process, the right to be heard, proper treatment of evidence, among others.\n\n55.\n\nContrary to Claimants' position, an application for annulment must simply demonstrate the impact that the situation could have had on the award, that is to say, that observance of the rule departed from had the potential of causing the tribunal to render a substantially different award from the one it actually rendered. It need not prove that the tribunal would have effectively reached a different decision.\n\n56.\n\nWhere applied to the resolution of a disqualification proposal, this standard is not confined to verifying that the applicable procedures have been followed. It also includes reviewing whether an arbitrator possesses the requisite qualifications to serve as such. The *EDF* committee accepted this, though it unduly limited the scope of review in deference to the two unchallenged members' initial decision on the disqualification proposal.\n\n**b. Summary of Claimants' Position**\n-------------------------------------\n\n57.\n\nThe Claimants agree that Article 52(1)(d) is intended to ensure that minimal standards of procedure are observed in the arbitral proceedings. They stress, however, that the applicant bears the burden of proving both that the tribunal committed a serious departure from a procedural rule, and that the rule was fundamental.27\n\nClaimants' Counter-Memorial, para. 201.\n\n58.\n\nIn order to be serious, the violation of the rule must have caused the tribunal to reach a result substantially different from what it would have decided had such a rule been observed.28\n\n*Ibid.*, para. 202.\n\n59.\n\nIn respect of a disqualification proposal, arbitrators are subject to a duty to investigate and disclose true conflicts, but that duty is not in and of itself a fundamental rule of procedure; it is at most a reflection of the requirement that arbitrators must remain independent and impartial. As recognized by Professors Salacuse and Nikken, as well as the *EDF* tribunal and *ad hoc* committee, nondisclosure in itself cannot be a ground for disqualification where, as here, the facts not disclosed do not evidence a conflict of interest.29\n\nClaimants' Rejoinder, para. 60.\n\n**E. FAILURE TO STATE REASONS IN THE AWARD (ARTICLE 52(1)(E) OF THE ICSID CONVENTION)**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**a. Summary of Argentina's Position**\n--------------------------------------\n\n60.\n\nThe requirement that tribunals state reasons for their decisions is an essential aspect of the ICSID system.30\n\nArgentina's Memorial, para. 52.\n\n61.\n\nAs several committees have pointed out, a failure to state reasons may lead to annulment where there has been a total absence of reasons, which encompasses cases in which merely frivolous reasons have been stated; where a tribunal's reasoning is contradictory; or where the reasoning is lacking in coherence that a reader cannot follow it (i.e. incomplete or inadequate reasons). Moreover, as the *TECO* committee recently noted, the omission to address certain evidence relevant to the assessment of damages may also amount to a failure to state reasons under Article 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention.31\n\n*Ibid.*, paras. 55-59.\n\n62.\n\nIt is not for a committee to substitute its determination on the merits for that of the tribunal, nor should give the reasons that were not stated by the tribunal; \"[a]ll it can do is annul the decision of the tribunal.\"32 The ICSID Convention requires that the reasons be stated.\n\nArgentina's Reply, para. 59.\n\n**b. Summary of Claimants' Position**\n-------------------------------------\n\n63.\n\nThe Claimants argue that the purpose of Article 52(1)(e) is to ensure that ICSID awards are the result of reasoned decision-making. It is not for an *ad hoc* committee to assess the quality, persuasiveness, or correctness of a tribunal's reasoning.33 Only the complete absence of reasoning on an outcome determinative point, or the statement of reasons that are so genuinely contradictory so as to cancel each other out may lead to annulment under Article 52(1)(e).34\n\nClaimants' Counter-Memorial, para. 219.\n\nClaimants' Rejoinder, para. 147.\n\n64.\n\nAlthough a tribunal is required to decide every question put before it, there is no duty to comment on every argument raised, or piece of evidence submitted, by the parties. As the *TECO* committee, whose decision Argentina cites to on this point, made clear a tribunal cannot be required to address within its award each and every piece of evidence in the record.35\n\n*Ibid*., para. 149.\n\n65.\n\nNeither Article 48(3) nor Article 52(1)(e) specifies the manner in which tribunals must state their reasons. A tribunal's reasons may also be implicit as long as they are understandable.36 Where a tribunal fails to address a question raised by one of the parties or the parties desire a further clarification of a tribunal's decision, they can request that the tribunal supplements its award or interprets its ruling. Annulment is not the proper avenue to address these issues.37\n\nClaimants' Counter-Memorial, para. 225.\n\nClaimants' Rejoinder, para. 151.\n\n**VI. THE PARTIES ARGUMENTS FOR AND AGAINST ANNULMENT**\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n**A. REPRODUCTION BY THE TRIBUNAL OF THE FINDINGS MADE IN OTHER ARBITRATIONS**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**a. Summary of Argentina's Position**\n--------------------------------------\n\n66.\n\nArgentina contends that the Tribunal reproduced in this case the findings of the *Suez 3/19* and *AWG* decisions, disregarding the factual differences between these cases, the distinct legal frameworks, the behavior of the parties and the specific geographic and socioeconomic circumstances pertaining to each of the concession areas.38 In some parts of the Decision on Liability, the Tribunal did not even substitute the correct name of the participating agencies, or the number of parties and BITs involved, let alone the specific terms of the concession agreements. This had a clear and decisive impact on the outcome of the present case and particularly on the fate of the FET claim, the necessity defence and the valuation of damages.39 It also constitutes a manifest excess of powers, a serious departure of fundamental rules of procedure and a failure to state reasons.40\n\nArgentina's Memorial, para. 64.\n\nFor instance, Argentina claims that \"[o]ut of the 248 paragraphs that make up the Decision on Liability in the present case *Suez 3/17*, a total of 217 correlate to the paragraphs in the decision on liability issued in the *Suez 3/19* and *AWG* cases, which represents 87.5% of them.\"\n\nArgentina's Reply, para. 126.\n\n67.\n\nIn relation to the FET claim, the Decision on Liability suggests that the Tribunal's conclusions would have been different had the Province \"relieved [the Concessionaire], at least temporarily, of investment commitments\" to \"avoid an increase in tariffs during a time of crisis\", or if the Province had been willing to renegotiate the concession terms in good faith instead of forcing the concessionaire to accept \"imposed\" terms. The problem is that this is exactly what the Province of Santa Fe did.41 Unlike the Federal Government in the *Suez 3/19* and *AWG* cases, the Province authorized the Concessionaire (APSF) to suspend and reduce investments significantly below what was required under the Contract without imposing any fines in an effort to keep the Concession afloat.42 Moreover, there was nothing \"forced\" or compulsory about this process as the decision wrongly suggests.43 Nor did the Province \"abruptly\" terminate the Concession relying on \"serious fault\" by APSF; rather, the contract was terminated due to dissolution of APSF. All of these are misplaced findings belonging to a different case.44\n\n*Ibid.*, para. 91.\n\nAgreement between APSF and the Province of Santa Fe on transitory measures to enable the conduct of the renegotiation process, October 29, 2002, R-98, C-106, Exhibit A RA 141, Art. 1.\n\nArgentina's Reply, para. 98.\n\nArgentina's Memorial, paras. 72-74.\n\n68.\n\nWith respect to Argentina's necessity defence, the Tribunal limited its discussion to 15 paragraphs out of which only 9 are really devoted to analysis, and it yet copied almost word by word from the decision on liability in the *Suez 3/19* and *AWG* cases. This led the Tribunal to ignore the critical situation of the Province of Santa Fe, which was even more serious than that experienced at a national level and was subsequently aggravated by floods in 2003. The Tribunal only mentions the floods in passing in its general account of the facts, but does not really take them into account in its analyses of Argentina's necessity defence. This is particularly evident when the Tribunal states that the Province \"could have attempted to apply more flexible means\", another statement copied from the *Suez 3/19* decision, which does not apply to this case. As noted above, the Province allowed the Concessionaire to hold and reduce investments substantially below the contractual targets.45\n\nArgentina's Memorial, paras. 171-172, citing Decision on Liability, para. 238.\n\n69.\n\nOn damages, the Tribunal used *Acta III*, a proposal for amending the existing regulatory framework prepared in 2000 by the provincial Government and never formally adopted, to build its valuation model considering it \"strong evidence of how a reasonable regulator would act.\" The Tribunal reproduced this statement *verbatim* from the *Suez 3/19* case where the tribunal used Resolution 602/99 as a basis for its counter-factual scenario. But unlike Resolution 602/99, which the regulator in the *Suez 3/19* case did in fact follow at some point (although it was never formally adopted), *Acta III* was explicitly rejected by the regulator in this case and never used for any purpose. Moreover, Argentina presented an alternative scenario, but it was ignored by the Tribunal which simply substituted *Acta III* for Resolution 602/99 providing no explanation for this approach. The Tribunal failed also to address Argentina's objections to Claimants' initial capital base and economic bids, neither of which had been raised in the *Suez 3/19* and *AWG* cases. The Claimants alleged that the Tribunal was unconvinced by Argentina's arguments but this is mere speculation because no reasons are offered in the decision. Nor is it true that Argentina's counterfactual scenario was unrealistic or that it did not reflect a productive and cooperative working relationship between the parties. It did contain modifications to the applicable regulatory framework as well as concrete adjustment proposals with respect to various assumptions.46\n\nArgentina's Memorial, paras. 89-91.\n\n70.\n\nThe parties' agreement to submit these proceedings to identically composed tribunals did not entail an authorization for the arbitrators to resolve them as if they were one and the same, by transposing the findings made in one into the other, while overlooking their differences. This was a decision adopted out of procedural economy concerns - nothing else. Nor does the fact that some of the arguments contained in Argentina's pleadings are similar mean that the cases are identical. As a matter of fact, Argentina spent a great deal of effort showing the particularities of this case both in its pleadings on the merits and in its submissions on *quantum*. Following the Decision on Liability, for instance, Argentina reiterated the flexibility measures adopted by the Province of Santa Fe in relation to the Concession, although to no avail.47\n\nSee measures listed in Argentina's Reply, para. 96.\n\n71.\n\nIn reproducing the findings of the *Suez 3/19* and *AWG* cases, the \"Tribunal failed to apply the applicable law to the facts of *this* case\" and therefore manifestly exceeded its powers.48 Similarly, by transposing the findings of *Suez 3/19* and *AWG* cases into the present case, instead of adopting a decision based on the facts and arguments of this case, the Tribunal infringed upon the right of the parties to be heard by an open-minded tribunal and prejudged the facts and issues raised by the parties in this arbitration. This constitutes a serious departure from fundamental rules of procedure. Finally, the Tribunal failed to state reasons because it merely reproduced another case's findings. Neither did the Tribunal address all the issues submitted for decision as required by Article 48(3) of the ICSID Convention, which is a reason for annulment under any and all of the foregoing annulment grounds.\n\nArgentina's Reply, para. 128.\n\n72.\n\nContrary to Claimants' suggestions, Argentina could not have remedied this problem while the arbitration was pending. As noted above, the remedies of annulment, rectification and supplementation are not available in respect of pre-award decisions. Nor is it possible to file a request for reconsideration against any such decision, as the *Perenco* and *ConocoPhillips* cases have shown. This is not to say that Argentina never expressed any concerns, which it did. In view of the Decision on Liability, Argentina took special care to point out the facts and circumstances that substantially differed in this case from the *Suez 3/19* and *AWG* cases, and it warned that the decisions reached in the *Suez 3/19* and *AWG* cases could not be copied into this arbitration.49\n\nLetter SPTN No. 92/AI/15 from the Argentine Republic to the Members of the Tribunal, May 22, 2015, A RA 154; see also Argentina's Response to Dr. Deep's Request for Additional Information, May 9, 2012, A RA 173, p. 1.\n\n**b. Summary of Claimants' Position**\n-------------------------------------\n\n73.\n\nThe Claimants argue that the Tribunal did not exceed its powers when making common findings in this and the *Suez 3/19* arbitration. Nor did the Tribunal depart from a fundamental rule of procedure or fail to state reasons.50\n\nSee Claimants' Counter-Memorial, paras. 193-199.\n\n74.\n\nOn the first annulment ground, Argentina has not really identified a single instance of the Tribunal failing to apply the governing law or exceeding its power.51 That many of the Tribunal's findings are consistent is not an excess of powers nor is it evidence of any impropriety; it is just the natural consequence of the substantial factual and legal parallels between the cases and the parties' desire for consistency by appointing the same tribunal, something to which Argentina consented from the outset.52\n\n*Ibid.*, para. 196.\n\n*Ibid.*, para. 198.\n\n75.\n\nIndeed, this case and *Suez 3/19* concerned the same type of investments, made by essentially the same companies, and governed by virtually identical terms; the same kinds of unlawful acts by Argentina and its instrumentalities; and the same political and economic background. Additionally, both cases were litigated by the same counsel teams, which presented substantially similar arguments on the many overlapping facts and legal principles relevant to the disputes. Large tracts of Argentina's own pleadings in the two cases are identical. In these circumstances, it is by no means surprising that the Tribunal reached the same or similar conclusions on certain disputed issues. Had Argentina wanted the decision-makers in *Suez 3/17* isolated from the facts and arguments in *Suez 3/19*, Argentina should have insisted on the appointment of different tribunal s.53\n\nClaimants' Rejoinder, para. 124.\n\n76.\n\nNeedless to say, Argentina has grossly overstated the extent to which the Tribunal adopted common factual findings. Its arguments are replete with inaccuracies and exaggerations.54 Contrary to Argentina's suggestions, the Tribunal regularly accounted for differences between these cases. Argentina's own figures reveal this. For instance, the 42.3% overlap that Argentina calculates can hardly be considered a blind copy and paste exercise of which the Tribunal is accused. In any event, this is all beside the point because Argentina has not stated an excess of powers case: The Tribunal's findings of fact, even if they overlapped with its findings in the liability decision of *Suez 3/19* case, are unreviewable on annulment.55\n\nSee, e.g., Claimants' Rejoinder, paras. 128-130.\n\n*Ibid.*, para. 123.\n\n77.\n\nInsofar as Argentina's second ground for annulment is concerned (i.e. departure from a fundamental procedural rule), the Committee need not even consider it. This claim is clearly time-barred under ICSID Arbitration Rules 9(1) and 27. Argentina's complaints stem mostly from the content of the Decision on Liability, which was issued over five and a half years before the Award. This is not about whether Argentina could or could not have sought the annulment of that decision or its reconsideration by the original Tribunal as Argentina wrongly suggests. Even if it was clear (which it is not) that reconsideration of pre-award decisions is impermissible, the point is that Argentina had the chance to raise this allegation before; it was required to do so and yet it never did until now. Indeed, a review of the evidence relied on by Argentina to show that it did protest reveals actually that it merely argued that differences existed in the two cases that the Tribunal had to take into account at the *quantum* phase.56 That is it. Argentina therefore waived its right to object.\n\nSee Claimants' Rejoinder, paras. 143-146.\n\n78.\n\nAs for Argentina's allegations concerning the Tribunal's lack of reasoning in respect of its findings on Claimants' FET claim, Argentina's necessity defence and the Tribunal's valuation of damages, they do not really have anything to do with missing reasons. Rather, Argentina seeks to question the quality or correctness of the Tribunal's reasons, which is not a proper basis for annulment.\n\n79.\n\nFirst, the Tribunal's liability and FET findings are clearly supported by reasons. The Tribunal did not \"overlook\" Argentina's arguments; it rejected them. The Tribunal assessed the evidence submitted by the parties and found that the Province did not reduce APSF's investment commitments after the crisis; it actually increased them and refused to adjust tariffs.57 It also found that the renegotiation process had not been \"genuine\" as the \"Province unfairly curtailed APSF's reasonable freedom to negotiate the terms of the Concession Contract.\"58 In coming to these conclusions, the Tribunal addressed the specific facts of this case and the actions of the Province of Santa Fe. That the ultimate conclusion is aligned with that in the *Suez 3/19* case is unremarkable: the actions of both the Federal Government and the Province were consistent, and both violated the Claimants' rights. Whether the Tribunal favored one piece of evidence over another, or did not address a specific document is simply irrelevant.59\n\n*Ibid.*, para.189.\n\n*Ibid.*, para. 192, citing Decision on Liability, para. 222.\n\nClaimants' Counter-Memorial, paras. 254-255.\n\n80.\n\nSecond, the Tribunal's reasoning for rejecting Argentina's necessity defense is also stated in the Award. Far from uncritically reproducing findings from *Suez 3/19*, the Tribunal considered the issues specific to the Province of Santa Fe, such as flooding, but found that the Province could still have adopted more flexible means for dealing with the Claimants' rights. The Tribunal concluded therefore that Argentina failed to satisfy the \"only way\" requirement. Argentina also failed to satisfy the \"non-contribution\" requirement, which is alone sufficient to reject Argentina's necessity defense. Even if Argentina were correct in the sense that the Tribunal should have done more to establish the full contours of the necessity defense's legal standard, that would go to the extent or quality of the Tribunal's reasons and still not be an annullable error.60\n\nClaimants' Rejoinder, paras. 195-198.\n\n81.\n\nFinally, the Tribunal also stated reasons when deciding common damages issues in this case and *Suez 3/19*. The Tribunal stated in clear terms that it did not find Argentina's arguments sufficiently detailed or convincing to undermine Dr. Deep's analysis on the but-for scenario. The Tribunal did not repeat its findings from *Suez 3/19* in the Award; it rejected Argentina's position. That this is consistent with the *Suez 3/19* 's conclusions is of no surprise. The Tribunal had good reason (in both cases) to disregard Argentina's damages arguments. Argentina never mentions how a reasonable regulator would have fairly and equitably treated APSF and its investments. It instead advocated for a strict and unyielding application of the terms of the Concession in the hypothetical but-for scenario, an approach which the Tribunal rejected altogether.61\n\n*Ibid.*, paras. 199-214.\n\n**B. PROFESSOR KAUFMANN-KOHLER'S APPOINTMENT AS DIRECTOR OF UBS AND HER FAILURE TO DISCLOSE AND INVESTIGATE**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**a. Summary of Argentina's Position**\n--------------------------------------\n\n82.\n\nArgentina claims that Professor Kaufmann-Kohler had a clear conflict of interest for which she should have been disqualified. She was a member of the Board of Directors of UBS, a company holding shares and other interests in Suez, during the arbitration proceedings. Not only did she fail to investigate and disclose this fact to the parties but also she refused to resign. This undermined the integrity of the Tribunal and warrants annulment of the Award for improper constitution of the Tribunal and serious departure from fundamental rules of procedure.62\n\nArgentina's Reply, para. 138.\n\n83.\n\nProf. Kaufmann-Kohler accepted her position in UBS in April 2006. During the three years in which Prof. Kaufmann-Kohler was part of UBS's Board, the parties submitted all their briefs on the merits, a hearing was held in which all relevant evidence was produced on liability, and the arbitrators' deliberations began.63\n\n*Ibid.*, para. 146.\n\n84.\n\nArgentina learned about Prof. Kaufmann-Kohler's engagement in UBS in November 2007 and filed a proposal for disqualification as soon as she confirmed that UBS had indeed shareholdings in Suez of which she was unaware.64 UBS also encouraged investment in water concessionaires, mentioning among them the businesses of Suez Environment and AGBAR and during 2006 and 2007 it marketed and commercialized investments in water concessionaires, including Suez.65\n\nLetter from Gabrielle Kaufmann-Kohler to UBS, December 17, 2007, attached to Letter from Gabrielle Kaufmann-Kohler to the ICSID, December 21, 2007, A RA 116.\n\nArgentina's Reply, para. 140, citing Disqualification Proposal, Exhibit A RA 115, paras. 30-33.\n\n85.\n\nWith the support of an expert opinion prepared by ethics Professor Charles W. Wolfram, Argentina conclusively established that Prof. Kaufmann-Kohler had at least two distinct interests, which were incompatible with her duty to the parties to exercise independent and impartial judgment. First, she was legally bound by a fiduciary duty to the company that she was a director of, which required her to put the company's interests ahead of her own. Secondly, she had a personal economic interest in the performance of UBS, since she received a significant percentage of her remuneration in UBS shares. She had to accept at least 50% of her remuneration in USB shares, and could accept up to 100% thereof.66\n\nSee Report of expert Charles W. Wolfram, February 29, 2008, Exhibit A RA 118, paras. 11-15.\n\n86.\n\nNotwithstanding this evidence, the unchallenged members of the Tribunal rejected the Proposal for Disqualification and Prof. Kaufmann-Kohler remained as a director of UBS. In doing so, they only performed a *quantitative* analysis of Professor Kaufmann-Kohler's economic self-interest, and did not refer to the fiduciary duty to protect UBS's interests in Suez or her natural inclination to do so, or her institutional duty to advance such interests.67 As the *Vivendi* committee noted, such fiduciary duty exists regardless of the value at stake, \"however small it may be\".68 A similar approach was endorsed by the Chairman of ICSID's Administrative Council in the *Blue Bank v. Venezuela* case.69\n\nArgentina's Reply, para. 144.\n\n*Compa\u00f1\u00eda de Aguas del Aconquija S.A. and Vivendi Universal S.A. v. Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/97/3), Decision on the Argentine Republic's Request for Annulment of the Award rendered on August 20, 2007, August 10, 2010, AL A RA 52, para. 218.\n\n*Blue Bank International & Trust (Barbados) Ltd. v. Venezuela* (ICSID Case No. ARB/12/20), Decision on the Parties' Proposals to Disqualify a Majority of the Tribunal, November 12, 2013, AL A RA 53, para. 40.\n\n87.\n\nAs a result of this, the integrity of the proceedings was irreversibly broken and the Tribunal stayed improperly constituted.70 Two fundamental rules of procedure were also breached: (i) the right to be heard by an impartial and independent tribunal, and (ii) the arbitrators' duty to investigate and disclose.\n\nArgentina's Reply, para. 151.\n\n88.\n\nAs noted by the *Vivendi* committee, Professor Kaufmann-Kohler should have: (a) properly investigated whether the bank had any connections with the parties to the pending arbitrations; (b) disclosed any such connections to the parties to such arbitrations; and (c) notified the parties of the appointment, regardless of any existing connections, so that they may be properly informed.71 Professor Kaufmann-Kohler did none of this. Providing UBS with a list of pending matters at the time of her appointment is certainly insufficient. If the *Vivendi* committee did not annul the award in that case it is only because it found that \"Professor Kaufmann-Kohler had no actual knowledge of the connection between UBS and the Claimants until after the Award was rendered,\" and so it decided that the conflict could not have had any material impact on the decision.72\n\n*Compa\u00f1\u00eda de Aguas del Aconquija S.A. and Vivendi Universal S.A. v. Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/97/3), Decision on the Argentine Republic's Request for Annulment of the Award rendered on August 20, 2007, August 10, 2010, AL A RA 52, para. 204.\n\n*Ibid.*, para. 234.\n\n89.\n\nClaimants rely on the *EDF*, *Suez 3/19*, *AWG* and *Azurix* decisions to contest Argentina's arguments. However, the first two tribunals considered that their review was limited, which is not supported by the text of Article 52. Moreover, in *EDF v. Argentina*, the conflict of interest was much less significant, something that weighed heavily in the committee's decision. EDF and UBS had common interests in subsidiary companies and EDF had entered into a financial agreement with a group of companies including UBS. Similarly, the *AWG* award was reviewed under a much higher standard of \"manifest lack of impartiality\" set out in the US federal Arbitration Act and UBS had no stock in AWG. Finally, the *Azurix* decision is unduly restrictive and its reasoning has been rejected, including by Prof. Schreuer and the *EDF* and *Suez 3/19* committees.73\n\nArgentina's Reply, paras. 167-170.\n\n**b. Summary of Claimants' Position**\n-------------------------------------\n\n90.\n\nThe Claimants contend that Argentina's case is based on the incorrect premise that the Second Challenge Decision was wrongly decided. Even if that were the case, which it is not, this Committee is not tasked with determining whether Argentina's challenge was correctly decided. The Committee's role under either Article 52(1)(a) (i.e. tribunal's improper constitution) or (d) (i.e. serious departure of fundamental rule of procedure) is restricted to determining whether the Second Challenge Decision constituted such an egregious violation of certain basic principles that the Award issued by that Tribunal nine years later cannot stand. Argentina's Application, however, fails under either annulment ground.74\n\nClaimants' Rejoinder, paras. 8-9.\n\n91.\n\nFirst of all, the Tribunal's factual determinations and legal conclusions are not open to challenge and, even if they were, they are correct. Argentina misrepresents facts and contends various legal findings that were conclusively established by the Decision on Disqualification, which are not subject to review or reassessment at this stage. A factual record exists, which is binding upon this Committee. Based on such record, the unchallenged arbitrators found that the links between the Claimants and Professor Kaufmann-Kohler were both indirect and highly immaterial. Argentina's biased account omits to mention, for instance, that UBS investments were \"passive, portfolio\" investments, with a \"large portion [being] managed on behalf of clients\", whose total value represented a very small fraction of UBS's worldwide investments - only 0,056% considering both UBS's investments in Suez and in Vivendi.75 Nor had Prof. Kaufmann-Kohler neglected to investigate potential conflicts. She submitted a list of her arbitrations to UBS to ensure that no conflicts existed before accepting her directorship, which the unchallenged arbitrators viewed as a reasonable effort to investigate potential conflicts.76\n\n*Ibid.*, para. 39, citing Second Challenge Decision, para. 36; see also Claimants' Counter-Memorial, para. 103 and footnote 159.\n\nClaimants' Counter-Memorial, para. 113.\n\n92.\n\nIt is not true that the Decision on Disqualification performed a mere *quantitative* analysis of Professor Kaufmann-Kohler's economic interest. Although they did not have to, the unchallenged arbitrators evaluated in detail Argentina's allegations with reference to four *qualitative* criteria: proximity, intensity, dependence, and materiality. If they did not address Argentina's allegations concerning Professor Kaufmann-Kohler's fiduciary duty and institutional loyalties, it is because they had already concluded that the interests of UBS in the Claimants were immaterial and could thus have had no potential impact on Professor Kaufmann-Kohler whatsoever.77 It is therefore of no surprise that Prof. Wolfram's extreme views on conflicts, which are based on US law, have been rejected by no fewer than four different sets of arbitrators in cases involving Argentina's attempted removal of Professor Kaufmann-Kohler. Not even the US District Court, applying US law, in the *AWG* proceeding, was persuaded by them.78\n\nClaimants' Rejoinder, para. 44.\n\n*Ibid.*, para. 48.\n\n93.\n\nThe decisions in *Suez 3/19*, *EDF*, and *AWG* are directly relevant and highly persuasive for this Committee. For instance, not only did the *Suez 3/19* committee consider identical arguments on whether the tribunal was properly constituted, the committee's decision was founded on the very same factual and legal record, including the Second Challenge Decision that is now before this Committee. Yet Argentina makes no attempt to address the *Suez 3/19* committee's conclusions to disregard Argentina's application for annulment. The only thing Argentina does is force a distinction between the *EDF* case and this case. But, if anything, there is a great similarity in the two cases insofar as UBS's interests in the claimants were, as both tribunals found, *de minimis*. Argentina also misrepresents the US legal standard of evident partiality in its attempts to distinguish the US District Court's decision in *AWG*. In any event, this case represented yet another instance of an independent decision-maker examining and upholding the same facts and Decision on Disqualification that is now before this Committee.79\n\n*Ibid.*, paras. 52-57.\n\n94.\n\nLastly, Argentina does not dispute that the Tribunal followed the proper procedures for hearing and deciding an arbitrator challenge. Nor does Argentina claim that it was denied an opportunity to present its case on Professor Kaufmann-Kohler's independence and impartiality. While arbitrators are subject to a duty to investigate and disclose true conflicts, that duty is not in and of itself a fundamental rule of procedure; it is at most a reflection of the requirement that arbitrators must remain independent and impartial. Nondisclosure in itself cannot be a ground for disqualification where, as here, the facts not disclosed do not evidence a conflict of interest. Therefore, Argentina's Application under Article 52(1)(b) must likewise fail.80\n\n*Ibid.*, paras. 58-61.\n\n**C. FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH THE 18 MONTHS' LOCAL LITIGATION REQUIREMENT**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**a. Summary of Argentina's Position**\n--------------------------------------\n\n95.\n\nAccording to Argentina, the Tribunal committed two annullable errors when it permitted AGBAR and Interagua to rely on the MFN clause of the Argentina-Spain BIT to import the dispute settlement provision contained in the Argentina-France BIT and circumvent the otherwise applicable 18-month local court litigation requirement of Article X of the Argentina-Spain BIT.81 It manifestly exceeded its powers because it exercised jurisdiction without Argentina's consent and in doing so it also failed to state supporting reasons.82\n\nThis provision requires an investor to bring a judicial proceeding in the local courts and allows it to have recourse to arbitration only after a further period of eighteen months in the local courts.\n\nArgentina's Memorial, para. 137; Argentina's Reply, para. 171.\n\n96.\n\nThe Tribunal \"manifestly\" exceeded its powers because it went far beyond the parties' consent, something that is readily apparent from a mere reading of the Award. The Tribunal, on the one hand, recognized the 18-month local litigation requirement as a mandatory condition and, on the other hand, it acknowledged that such requirement had not been satisfied by AGBAR and Interagua.83 Yet, it concluded that AGBAR and Interagua were nonetheless permitted by virtue of the MFN clause to bring an ICSID arbitration without having to resort first to the local courts of Argentina. But, as the *ICS v. Argentina* tribunal concluded, an MFN clause cannot be applied to jurisdictional matters unless clear and unambiguous consent to that effect is established. Similarly, a Swedish Court of Appeal recently set aside one of the *Yukos* decisions because the tribunal improperly applied an MFN clause to grant an investor access to arbitration in excess of its jurisdiction.84\n\nArgentina's Reply, para. 189.\n\nArgentina's Reply, para. 192, citing *Russian Federation v. GBI 9000 SICAV S.A., ALOS 34 S.L., Orgor de Valores SICAV S.A. and Quasar de Valors SICAV S.A.*, Case No. 9128-14, Judgment of the SVEA Court of Appeal, January 18, 2016, AL A RA 124, p. 10.\n\n97.\n\nThe Tribunal made another annullable error where it failed to explain how jurisdictional issues, which are clearly different from substantive issues, may fall within the scope of \"all matters\" relating to the term \"treatment\" in Article IV.85 Although it alluded to the wording of this provision and said it was guided by \"established principles of treaty interpretation\",86 the Tribunal did not really apply such rules when interpreting Article X of the Argentina-Spain BIT. Nor did the Tribunal consider Argentina's subsequent treaty practice despite Argentina's arguments both in its written submissions and in oral pleadings.87 The evidence, which, according to Claimants was not submitted to the Tribunal, was attached by Claimants themselves.88 Therefore, the issue was discussed and addressed at the jurisdictional phase and the Tribunal had all the necessary evidence before it to give due regard to Argentina's subsequent practice.\n\nSee Argentina's Memorial, para. 147.\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction, para. 54.\n\nSee Argentina's Memorial, para. 154 (\"the State Parties did not intend the MFN Clause contained in Article IV of the Argentina-Spain BIT to apply to the settlement of disputes... [t]his is evidence of the practice subsequently followed in applying the treaty.\"). See also Argentine Republic's Memorial on Jurisdiction of November 26, 2004, paras. 157-158 and Tr. Hear.

Exhibit C-148 filed by Claimants together with their Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, Exhibit A RA 228.\n\n**b. Summary of Claimants' Position**\n-------------------------------------\n\n98.\n\nFor the Claimants, Argentina's arguments on this point are no more than an impermissible attempt to have the Committee revisit the merits of the Tribunal's interpretation and application of the MFN clause in the Spanish treaty. The relevant question, however, is not whether the Tribunal was right or wrong, but whether the Tribunal's decision is supported by reasons and/or constituted a flagrant jurisdictional overreach.89\n\nClaimants' Counter-Memorial, paras. 133-135.\n\n99.\n\nIt is clear from the Decision on Jurisdiction that the Tribunal gave due consideration to this issue. It devoted an entire section of nearly 10 pages to it. The Tribunal explained that access to dispute settlement, a \"matter\" governed by Article X of the Spanish treaty, is a right or privilege covered by the notion of \"treatment\" that authorizes application of the MFN clause pursuant to the ordinary meaning of the term treatment. Whether Argentina agrees or not with this conclusion, that is irrelevant; reasons were given.90\n\nClaimants' Rejoinder, para. 156, citing Decision on Jurisdiction, paras. 52-66.\n\n100.\n\nArgentina never argued before the Tribunal any subsequent treaty practice concerning the Spanish treaty. Nor did it submit the evidence on the record upon which it now seeks to rely. As the *Suez 3/19* committee held, a tribunal cannot be faulted for failing to address an issue which the parties themselves never raised during the arbitration proceedings.91 Leaving aside that a tribunal is under no obligation to address every conceivable argument that anyone can think of, in this case Argentina's invocation of the Contracting State's alleged subsequent practice by reference to other arbitrations is simply misguided. A position taken by a disputing State in its defensive brief in a specific international arbitration does not amount to State practice under the Vienna Convention. The tribunal in *Telef\u00f3nica v. Argentina* rejected the same argument from Argentina.92\n\nClaimants' Counter-Memorial, para. 235.\n\n*Telef\u00f3nica SA v. Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/03/20), Decision of the Tribunal on Objections to Jurisdiction, May 25, 2006, A/CLA-76, paras. 112-114. See also *Suez 3/19*, Annulment Decision, A/CLA-56, para. 258.\n\n101.\n\nArgentina's second annulment ground should also be dismissed. As noted above, a jurisdictional error is by no means a *per se* manifest excess of powers. This position not only contradicts extensive authority in ICSID arbitrations, but it would also remove all content from the Article 52 requirement that an excess of powers be \"manifest.\" The few authorities that Argentina seeks to rely on are of no avail. The *Quasar de Valores* case (formerly *Renta 4*) concerned a domestic proceeding before the Swedish Court of Appeal and was based on a different treaty. In any event, Sweden is a Model Law jurisdiction, which means that Swedish courts are permitted to review a tribunal's jurisdictional decisions *de novo*, something ICSID annulment committees do not have the power to do.93\n\nSee Claimants' Counter-Memorial, paras. 136-142.\n\n102.\n\nAs several committees have held, for an excess of powers to be \"manifest,\" the underlying issue cannot be subject to more than one reasonable interpretation or otherwise be open to debate.94 In this case, the Tribunal's jurisdictional decision was at the very least reasonable and, in fact, consistent with all prior and subsequent decisions on the scope of the MFN clause in the Spanish treaty. Yet, even if a full merits review were available, Argentina has failed to show any jurisdictional error at all. Extensive case law supports the use of MFN clauses in the present circumstances.95\n\nSee e.g., *Impregilo*, *Suez 3/19* and *Daimler*.\n\nSee Claimants' Counter-Memorial, para. 143 and the cases cited by the Claimants therein.\n\n**D. NECESSITY UNDER CUSTOMARY INTERNATIONAL LAW**\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n**a. Summary of Argentina's Position**\n--------------------------------------\n\n103.\n\nArgentina contends that the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers and failed to state reasons when it rejected Argentina's necessity defence without identifying the applicable legal standards, or analyzing Argentina's concurrent obligation to guarantee the human right to water to its population, or otherwise considering the voluminous evidence submitted by Argentina into the record.96\n\nArgentina's Memorial, para. 165.\n\n104.\n\nFirst of all, the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers by failing to apply the proper law because it did not establish the legal standards applicable in respect of the \"only way\" and \"non-contribution\" requirements of the necessity defence. It also failed to state reasons for its decision on this point. Instead, it simply asserted that it was \"not convinced\" that the first of these requirements had been met as the Province \"could have attempted to apply more flexible means\", a statement that is a mere copy of the decision on liability in the *Suez 3/19* and *AWG* cases, and that Argentina did in fact contribute to the crises to the extent that it was brought about by a combination of endogenous and exogenous factors. As noted by the *Enron* committee and more recently by the *Urbaser* tribunal that reasoning is insufficient to make a legal determination on this contentious point. That is the key reason for which the *Enron* committee annulled the award in that case.97\n\nArgentina's Reply, paras. 197, 199-206; Argentina's Memorial, paras. 167-176.\n\n105.\n\nSecondly, the Tribunal failed to offer support for its decision to disregard Argentina's arguments in connection with its obligation to guarantee the human right to water. Unlike the lengthy analysis of the *Urbaser* decision, the Tribunal in this case simply stated that Argentina could have complied with both obligations under the applicable BITs and the human right to water without offering any analyses or providing any further guidance with regard to how the Province could have done so in the circumstances.98\n\nArgentina's Reply, paras. 197, 207-213; Argentina's Memorial, paras. 186-188.\n\n106.\n\nLastly, the Tribunal disregarded all the documentary, witness and expert evidence offered by Argentina in support of its necessity defence, without stating the reasons for which such evidence was considered insufficient, unpersuasive or otherwise unsatisfactory. The evidence included 14 witness statements provided by 9 witnesses; 13 reports prepared by 9 experts, and further documentary evidence comprising dozens of academic papers and newspaper articles from Argentina and the rest of the world, as well as indicators clearly showing the emergency situation and the crisis in Argentina and, particularly, the Province of Santa Fe. As noted above, the few passages in which the Tribunal refers to this matter are copied from the *Suez 3/19* and *AWG* decisions.99 This led the Tribunal to overlook the particular situation of the Province of Santa Fe, which was one of the most affected by the crisis, with much higher unemployment and poverty rates. In addition, severe floods hit the Province in 2003, further aggravating the crisis. As the *TECO v. Guatemala* committee pointed out in annulling the award in that case, a tribunal cannot ignore evidence which is relevant for a party and has the \"potential\", which is all that is required, to affect the outcome of the case without a proper analysis or explanation.100 That case is similar to the present one to the extent that both the *TECO* tribunal and the Tribunal in this case ignored significant evidence and, as a result, found against the party who had filed it, following a line of reasoning that is hard to comprehend. It is not true that this evidence was irrelevant. In any event, the Claimants cannot substitute their own analysis for that of the Tribunal.101\n\nArgentina's Reply, para. 219.\n\n*TECO Guatemala Holdings LLC v. Guatemala* (ICSID Case No. ARB/10/23), Decision on Annulment, April 5, 2016, AL A RA 61, paras. 131, 135 and 138.\n\nArgentina's Reply, paras. 214-238.\n\n**b. Summary of Claimants' Position**\n-------------------------------------\n\n107.\n\nThe Claimants denied that the Tribunal had manifestly exceeded its powers or failed to state reasons when dismissing Argentina's necessity defense.102\n\nClaimants' Rejoinder, para. 162; Claimants' Counter-Memorial, para. 238.\n\n108.\n\nThe Tribunal did state the legal standards it purported to apply and provided reasons for its interpretation. Argentina does not deny that Section IX of the Award and the reasons stated therein exist; it protests instead that those reasons are insufficient. However, paragraph 238 of the Decision on Liability shows that the Tribunal took the words \"only way\" to mean that a measure must be the sole available response for addressing a situation of necessity, an interpretation that is reasonable and which it was entitled to make. The Tribunal concluded then that the measures adopted by Argentina were not the \"only way\" to preserve its essential interests because Argentina \"could have attempted to apply more flexible means to assure the continuation of the water and sewage services to the people of Santa Fe and at the same time respected its obligations of fair and equitable treatment.\"103 Although at this point the Tribunal need not address the non-contribution requirement (since both requirements are cumulative), it did so anyway finding that Argentina \"substantial[ly] contributed\" to the situation of necessity, a statement that was likewise supported by reasons. It is evident that the Tribunal reached this conclusion after interpreting this requirement to mean precisely what those words say, i.e. that \"a State must not have contributed to its situation of necessity\".104 Argentina may not like this conclusion and may have wished instead that the Tribunal followed an approach similar to that suggested by the much-criticized *Enron* committee. However, such disagreement does not amount to an annullable error.105\n\nClaimants' Rejoinder, para. 164, citing Decision on Liability, para. 238.\n\nClaimants' Rejoinder, para. 165, citing Decision on Liability, para. 241.\n\nClaimants' Rejoinder, paras. 167-168.\n\n109.\n\nNor did the Tribunal fail to consider Argentina's evidence on necessity. As noted above, tribunals are the sole finders of fact, and do not have an obligation to address each and every piece of evidence submitted by a party. The analogy that Argentina seeks to make with the *TECO* decision is misguided. In the *TECO* case, the tribunal affirmatively found that there was insufficient evidence on a central *quantum* issue, even though the parties had in fact introduced such evidence, as a result of which the committee \"struggled to understand the Tribunal's line of reasoning.\"106 None of that happened here. It is plain from the Decision on Liability that the Tribunal weighed the evidence submitted with respect to the \"only way\" and \"non-contribution\" requirements.107 Even Argentina and its experts, Professors Ratti and Roubini, conceded that it had contributed at least in part to the situation of necessity, an admission that disposes of the necessity defense altogether.\n\nClaimants' Counter-Memorial, para. 247, citing *TECO Guatemala Holdings LLC v. Republic of Guatemala* (ICSID Case No ARB/10/23), Decision on Annulment, April 5, 2016, AL A RA 61, para. 128.\n\nSee Claimants' Rejoinder, paras. 171-174; and Decision on Liability, paras. 215 and 242.\n\n110.\n\nThe Tribunal also gave reasons to reject Argentina's attempt to shield its actions under the cover of the human right to water. The Tribunal found that Argentina was obliged to respect both its human rights obligations and its treaty obligations and that it could have done so.108 To support this the Tribunal identified various specific measures that the Province could have taken \"that would have protected both its interests and those of the Claimants,\" including \"reliev[ing] APSF, at least temporarily, of investment commitments that were placing a crippling burden on the Concession,\" and \"allow[ing] tariff increases for other consumers while applying a social tariff or a subsidy to the poor,\" consistent with Article 81 of the Water Law and Article 11.5.3 of the Concession Contract. Argentina, however, did none of this.109\n\nSee Decision on Liability, para. 240: \"Argentina could have respected both types of obligations.\"\n\nClaimants' Rejoinder, para. 174, citing Argentina's Reply, para. 209 and Decision on Liability para. 215.\n\n111.\n\nConsequently, neither did the Tribunal fail to state reasons nor did it exceed its powers. Argentina simply disagrees with how the Tribunal applied the law to the facts, which is not a ground for annulment.\n\n**E. VALUATION OF DAMAGES**\n---------------------------\n\n**a. Summary of Argentina's Position**\n--------------------------------------\n\n112.\n\nThe Tribunal committed several annullable errors in determining damages in this case: (1) it awarded damages for a measure that was not found to violate the applicable BITs; (2) it valued damages by reference to principles that are at odds with the applicable legal framework as established in the Decision on Liability; (3) it ruled that compensation should be awarded in relation to management fees, even though it did not hold the management contract to be a protected investment nor did it determine the nature of such claim, and ordered compensation for services not rendered; and (4) it applied interest rates that exceeded those requested by the Claimants.110\n\nArgentina's Reply, para. 240.\n\n113.\n\nFirst, the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers and contradicted itself (thus failing to provide reasons) when it awarded damages for claims arising out of the termination of the Concession Contract. Although the Claimants argued in the original proceedings that the termination was in violation of Argentina's BITs, the Tribunal disagreed and dismissed this claim. In doing so, it also confirmed that it could only compensate Claimants for losses resulting from wrongful acts. When determining damages, however, the Tribunal compensated the Claimants for cash flows until the scheduled end of the Concession in 2025; this is, well beyond the Contract's (lawful) termination in 2006. The Tribunal thus treated the termination as if it had violated applicable BITs. This is not an issue of selecting the right valuation date, as the Claimants contend, but one concerning the valuation period used by the Tribunal. The Tribunal's approach could only be justified in case of an expropriation, a finding that the Tribunal never made.111\n\n*Ibid.*, paras. 241-244.\n\n114.\n\nConscious that the 2006 termination had to be considered in its valuation, the Tribunal stated that the termination risk would be factored in as part of the discount rate.112 However, this risk was not really accounted for by the Tribunal's expert. Moreover, this was not even a risk but a fact that actually occurred. A premium should thus have been added to the discount rate applied in respect of cash flows projected after 2006, or the Beta should have been raised; neither of which was done. It cannot be simply assumed that such a consideration was included in the rate absent any indication.113\n\nAward, para. 41 (\"the risk of termination was always present in the Concession; however, that risk, along with other risks, would be accounted for in the discount rate applied to discount to present value the remaining twenty-three years of projected cash flows.\")\n\nArgentina's Reply, para. 253.\n\n115.\n\nSecondly, the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers, seriously departed from a rule of procedure, and failed to state reasons when it endorsed the valuation proposed by the Tribunal's expert, Dr. Akash Deep. Dr. Deep relied on a proposal to modify the Concession Contract, known as *Acta III*, to build its valuation. This proposal, however, was not part of the applicable framework. The Tribunal explicitly ruled it out in its Decision on Liability stating that no equilibrium principle existed under the Concession Contract. Apart from never being in force, *Acta III* was also at odds with basic principles underlying the Concession Contract, an agreement that was based on targets and objectives subject to business and financial risk. *Acta III*, by contrast, turned the Concession Contract into a rate-of-return arrangement, which ensured the Concessionaire a minimum return at all events. In other words, the Tribunal ended up applying the very same principles that it had excluded and rejected before. In doing so, it manifestly exceeded its powers by failing to apply the proper law and contradicted itself to such an extent that no supporting reasons exist for its decision on this point.114\n\nArgentina's Memorial, paras. 211-222.\n\n116.\n\nAdditionally, the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers and seriously departed from fundamental rules of procedure where it considered the sponsored debt to be a protected investment for the first time in the Award. This prevented the parties from having the chance to discuss this issue during the arbitration. The Tribunal also exceeded its powers and failed to state reasons where, in contradiction of its own previous findings, it concluded that the Province would only have acted fairly and equitably if it had reviewed tariffs so as to enable APSF to repay the secured debt in full regardless of any other consideration such as the level of financial leverage, thereby effectively removing any financial risk from the Concessionaire.115\n\nArgentina's Reply, paras. 274-278.\n\n117.\n\nThirdly, the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers and failed to state reasons by compensating Suez for management fees through 2025. It exceeded its powers because, as with the sponsored debt, it only defined management fees as a protected investment in the Award. It failed to state reasons because it followed conflicting reasoning by which, on the one hand, it determined that the operator's fees were a protected investment and, at the same time, it applied the damages calculation prepared by the expert, which assumed that such fees were a rendered service, not a return on investment. Moreover, such fees were awarded to Claimants for services never provided, after the Contract was terminated in 2006. This in and of itself amounts also to an excess of powers and a failure to state reasons as discussed under Section V(c) and (e) above.\n\n118.\n\nFinally, the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers and failed to state reasons by using interest rates higher than those suggested, and agreed to, by the parties. At the merits phase, the parties' experts agreed that the applicable rate for all purposes should be the 6-month United States Treasury Bill rate. Such rate was, on average, lower than that proposed by the independent expert and finally used by the Tribunal: the six-month Eurodollar rate. This finding is *ultra petita* and therefore imports a manifest excess of powers. It is also unsupported by any analysis, which constitutes a failure to state reasons.116\n\n*Ibid.*, paras. 296-306.\n\n**b. Summary of Claimants' Position**\n-------------------------------------\n\n119.\n\nFor the Claimants, Argentina's criticisms of the Tribunal's valuation methodology amount to no more than complaints that the Tribunal calculated damages incorrectly. That, however, is not a basis for annulment.\n\n120.\n\nThe Tribunal acted within its powers and provided copious reasons when calculating damages. Argentina mischaracterizes how the Tribunal valued the Claimants' loss. The Tribunal stated very clearly that it did not attribute any damages to the termination of the Concession. Instead, it based its damages calculation on Argentina's treaty breaches that preceded the termination. It thus measured compensation \"at a point in time just before those actions took place\" to provide the Claimants with full compensation.117 The subsequent termination of the Concession was considered an event incapable of relieving Argentina of liability. The risk that Argentina would prematurely terminate the Concession was accounted for in the discount rate used by Dr. Deep to reduce to present value the future expected cash flows and, specifically, in his \"market risk premium,\"118 which incorporates the \"systematic risk coefficient (or \u2018beta')\" applied to the discount rate calculation and expressed \"the riskiness of a regulated water and sewerage utility such as APSF.\"119 Argentina's criticism in this regard is simply misplaced. But even if Argentina were right, this would have, at most, resulted in a miscalculation of the discount rate applied to hypothetical cash flows, for which annulment is no remedy. No excess of powers or failure to state reasons exists.\n\nClaimants' Rejoinder, para. 81, citing Award, para. 41.\n\nClaimants' Rejoinder, para. 88. See also Award, para. 41 and Final Report of the Financial Expert to the Tribunal, May 21, 2014, A RA 151, paras. 367-379.\n\nSee Final Report of the Financial Expert to the Tribunal, May 21, 2014, A RA 151, para. 221.\n\n121.\n\nThe Tribunal also acted within its powers and provided reasons when constructing the \"but-for\" scenario. During the arbitration, the Tribunal considered and rejected arguments against the use of *Acta III* as one of the parameters to build the but-for scenario. It found that *Acta III* provided the best available guidance of \"mutual sacrifice\" and cooperative spirit as it reflected policies that had actually been developed and considered by the Provincial government in order to deal with APSF's financial difficulties. Argentina fails to appreciate the difference between the \"actual\" and \"but-for\" (hypothetical) worlds. In making its calculation, the Tribunal was not bound by the actual conditions prevailing in Argentina at the time. The Tribunal found that answer in the principles underlying *Acta III*, and in the fact that the investors would have received some liquidity relief in exchange for making financial sacrifices of their own. While Argentina has stated many disagreements with the Tribunal's reasoning, it has not identified any genuine contradictions or other failures to state reasons in the Tribunal's decision. Nor has it been able to articulate any basis for an excess-of-powers claim.120\n\nClaimants' Rejoinder, paras. 91-98.\n\n122.\n\nThe Tribunal did not breach any rule of procedure or exceed its powers when determining that APSF's secured or \"sponsored\" debt constituted an investment. The status of that debt as a protected investment was not decided for the first time in the Award as Argentina contends; it was just never in question. During the arbitration, the Claimants consistently argued that APSF's secured debt was a covered investment, and consistently sought damages for that investment. The Claimants' Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction specifically identified their debt participation as an investment.121 Argentina never objected to this characterization and cannot therefore do so now. That is why the *Suez 3/19* committee did not hesitate to dismiss this eleven-hour argument. Argentina's claim that it should not bear any of the financial consequences sustained as a result of APSF's inability to service its international loan obligations should likewise be rejected. There is no principle of law which requires the inclusion or exclusion of certain hypothetical facts in the determination of a \"but-for\" valuation scenario. Argentina may disagree with the Tribunal's decision on this point but this is not a base for annulment. As noted by other committees, the evaluation of damages falls within the discretionary power of tribunals in light of the circumstances of the case.122\n\nClaimants' Counter-Memorial, para. 162, referring to Claimants' Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, February 1, 2005, A/C-17, para. 8.\n\nSee Claimants' Rejoinder, para. 101 and references cited thereunder.\n\n123.\n\nThe Tribunal also acted within its powers when awarding compensation for management fees and supported this finding by lengthy reasons. The Tribunal explained that it agreed with Dr. Deep's \"middle ground\" approach including its decision not to apply interest to unpaid management fees, because this was what a reasonable regulator would have probably done in the circumstances. The Tribunal and Dr. Deep took a consistent view on the characterization of management fees as compensation for services rendered, and not as an \"expected return,\"123 as Argentina alleges. Argentina may not share these conclusions but it cannot deny that they are clearly stated in the Award and are well within the Tribunal's powers.124\n\nClaimants' Counter-Memorial, paras. 269-270.\n\n*Ibid.*, para. 271.\n\n124.\n\nThe Tribunal did not overstep its powers nor did it fail to state reasons when selecting the applicable interest rate for calculating damages. Contrary to Argentina's contentions, no party agreement existed on the applicable interest rate. The Claimants sought pre-award interest at three different rates; one for the period between Argentina's main breach in 2001 and the termination of the Concession in January 2006; another for the 9-month period immediately thereafter and another for the remainder time until the date of the Award (e.g. 2015-2016). Save for a brief period of 9-month overlap where both parties asked for a riskfree rate based on 6-month US T-Bills, the Claimants and their experts never \"agreed\" with Argentina on interest. In fact, the Eurodollar rate proposed by Dr. Deep, and adopted by the Tribunal was lower than the one proposed by the Claimants.125 Notwithstanding the vast discretion that tribunals have in selecting interest rates, the Tribunal took the time to explain its decision on this point. It cannot thus be seriously argued that the Tribunal failed to state reasons or that it acted *ultra petita*.126\n\nSee Claimants' Rejoinder, paras. 112-116.\n\nClaimants' Counter-Memorial, paras. 178-182.\n\n125.\n\nNor did the Tribunal exceed its powers or fail to state reasons in relation to the figures it used and the interest rate it applied in the Decision on Rectification. The Claimants argued during the arbitration that they should be compensated for the amount payable to the Inter-American Development Bank (\"**IDB**\") and International Finance Corporation (\"**IFC**\") under the Debt Restructuring Agreement as a result of Argentina's breaches. The Tribunal agreed with the Claimants and determined that the Claimants' loss on this point was USD 29.0 million, including interest until December 31, 2012. The Tribunal inadvertently failed, however, to allocate this amount among the individual Claimants and to update it to the date of the Award. In its Decision on Rectification, the Tribunal corrected these clerical mistakes and it applied to this portion of the Award the interest rate provided for in the Debt Restructuring Agreement (i.e. the interest rate effectively paid to the IDB and IFC) by the Claimants in their capacity as co-guarantors, something that is entirely within its powers. The parties had again ample opportunity to discuss this matter. Argentina may not like this conclusion but the Tribunal did provide reasons and in doing so it did not overstate its mandate in any way.127\n\nClaimants' Counter-Memorial, paras. 183-191.\n\n**VII. THE COMMITTEE'S ANALYSIS**\n---------------------------------\n\n126.\n\nAlthough the Parties both start from the common position that annulment is governed by the terms of Article 52 of the ICSID Convention, they paint the powers of an annulment committee in somewhat different terms. The Respondent quotes from the *Azurix* decision that annulment is there to preserve \"the integrity of the ICSID arbitration system and a state party participant's continued confidence in it\".128 This leads the Respondent to see a rather broad role for an *ad hoc* annulment committee. It adopts the words of the *Soufraki* committee, which turned the words \"integrity of the system\" into the \"fundamental integrity of the ICSID arbitral process in all its facets\".129 This means, according to the Respondent, integrity in terms of the tribunal, the proceedings and the award.130\n\nArgentina's Memorial, para. 22, citing *Azurix Corp. v. Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/01/12), Decision on the Argentine Republic's Request for a Continued Stay of Enforcement of the Award, December 28, 2007, AL A RA 1, para. 30.\n\nArgentina's Memorial, para. 23, citing *Hussein Nuaman Soufraki v. United Arab Emirates* (ICSID Case No. ARB/02/7), Decision on Annulment, June 5, 2007, AL A RA 51, para. 23.\n\nArgentina's Memorial, para. 23.\n\n127.\n\nThe Claimants see it differently. The Claimants describe annulment as an \"extraordinary remedy,\" concerned with \"egregious violations of certain basic principles\" which \"threaten the very legitimacy of the decision-making process\". Only a complaint that reaches this \"exceptionally high\" standard can justify annulment.131 Accordingly, there is a \"heavy burden placed on a party seeking annulment\".132\n\nClaimants' Counter-Memorial, para. 71.\n\n*Ibid.*, para. 74.\n\n128.\n\nThe Committee sees no value in engaging in an essentially abstract debate about the scope of Article 52 of the ICSID Convention. It agrees with the *Klockner* committee that Article 52 is to be interpreted neither narrowly nor expansively. Article 52 is a treaty provision and must be interpreted in accordance with the ordinary meaning of the words used, in their context and in light of the object and purpose of the Convention. Article 31(1) of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties requires no less. Where particular issues of interpretation arise that require a consideration of the objectives of annulment, the Committee will deal with them at that time.\n\n**A. REPRODUCTION BY THE TRIBUNAL OF THE FINDINGS MADE IN OTHER ARBITRATIONS**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n129.\n\nArgentina argues that the Tribunal has manifestly exceeded its powers (Article 52(1)(b)), seriously departed from a fundamental rule of procedure (Article 52(1)(d)) and failed to state reasons (Article 52 (1)(e)), by reproducing in its Award substantial portions of what was included in the *Suez 3/19* and *AWG* decisions.\n\n130.\n\nThis reproduction from other awards means that the Tribunal has ignored the factual differences between the cases and the different legal frameworks that are applicable, as well as the particularities of each case including socio-economic differences and the different actions of the parties.133 The magnitude of the overlap between the Award in the present case and the other cases is illustrated, Argentina claims, by the fact that of the 248 paragraphs in the Decision on Liability, 217 of those paragraphs correlate to the decisions in *Suez 3/19* and *AWG*. Thus, Argentina argues, up to 87% of the Decision on Liability was drawn from the decisions in the other cases.\n\nArgentina's Reply, para. 61.\n\n131.\n\nArgentina argues that the approach of the Tribunal had an impact on its finding of a violation of the fair and equitable treatment standard, on the application of the necessity defence and the valuation of damages. In each instance, by reproducing the analysis applicable to the other cases, the Tribunal disregarded the specific factual differences in the present case.\n\n132.\n\nThe Claimants take issue with the factual allegation of the extent of copying by the Tribunal. In their view the alleged copying is not as extensive as Argentina alleges it to be and there is no evidence that the Tribunal failed to apply the applicable law. Thus there is no foundation to the claim that there had been a manifest excess of power by the Tribunal.\n\n133.\n\nThe Claimants also argue that there was no departure from a fundamental rule of procedure in part on the ground that such a claim should have been raised much earlier and not at this late stage as part of the annulment process. Argentina has thus waived its right to make this claim. In any event, the Claimants argue, consistency between the decisions is to be expected when a common tribunal is formed to hear similar cases. As regards the claim that copying the decisions in other cases amounted to a failure to state reasons, the Claimants argue that the Tribunal did give reasons for its decision on damages as well as on the necessity defence.\n\n134.\n\nThe Committee observes that the parties had agreed to have a common tribunal for the three cases and that the parties themselves recognized that there were issues that were in common in the three cases by reproducing the same legal arguments for all of the cases on some issues before the Tribunal. In those circumstances it could have been expected that the Tribunal would have common answers on some issues and the volume of common extracts is not a decisive factor. Therefore, the Committee does not consider that the fact that the language in each case was identical of itself shows that there had been a manifest excess of power, or a violation of a fundamental rule of procedure. Nor does it give any indication that there has been a failure to state reasons.\n\n135.\n\nHowever, the Committee observes that the fact that cases have been placed before a common tribunal is not a license for the tribunal to treat them as if they were a single case. The parties to each of the cases are entitled to a separate consideration of the issues applicable to them. Thus, a tribunal must take care that when it repeats the same reasoning in each of the cases it has also made clear that each case has been considered on its own merits. Failure to identify the facts and circumstances of a case correctly can readily lead to the impression that the tribunal has not devoted the necessary care to the substantive analysis applicable in each case separately. It is not surprising, therefore, that the extent of repetition identified by the Respondent in this case as well as the errors in identifying facts and circumstances raised concerns that the Tribunal had not given full consideration to the particular issues of this case.\n\n136.\n\nThe substantive question, therefore, is whether the reproduction from other awards in this case was inappropriate because the extracts related to the other awards were not relevant to *Suez 3/17*. In this regard, the Committee notes Argentina's argument that some of the extracts contained references to facts and circumstances that related to the other cases and not to the claims in the present case.\n\n137.\n\nThe Committee observes that the reproduction of the text from the other awards appears to fall into three categories.\n\n138.\n\nFirst there are examples where the Tribunal used a term that was applicable to the other cases but not to the present case. These included references to AASA instead of APSF, or to Argentina or the Argentine State when it should have been a reference to Santa Fe Province, or references to a \"metropolitan area\" when it should have been a reference to the \"Santa Fe Concession Area\".\n\n139.\n\nSecond, there are examples where the Tribunal appears to refer to arguments that are relevant to the other cases but not to the present case. These include the use of the terms \"abrupt\" and \"suddenly\" with respect to termination which did not apply in the case of the Santa Fe Concession, or references to \"serious fault\" and \"heavy fines\", which were not part of the present case, or a \"revenue stream of 21 years\" which was not applicable in the present case, or a \"five year tariff review\" which did not apply in the present case.\n\n140.\n\nThird, there were examples of reproduction inapplicable to the Santa Fe concession that Argentina argued directly influenced the decision of the Tribunal on fair and equitable treatment, on the necessity defence and on valuation. These include references to a \"consistent refusal to revise the tariff\" (FET), which had not occurred in the present case, or omissions of references to the harshness of the impact on the Santa Fe area and the flooding that affected that area (necessity) and the failure to provide alternative valuation scenarios which may have been so in the other cases but was not true of the present case.\n\n141.\n\nWith regard to the first category of reproductions, the Committee observes that there is some laxity by the Tribunal in ensuring that it was referring to the correct entities and to facts relevant to this case. However, the Committee does not consider that this goes far enough to constitute a manifest excess of powers, violation of a fundamental rule of procedure or a failure to state reasons. There would have to be more evidence than this to give some indication that the Tribunal had failed to give due consideration to the arguments of the parties or ignored relevant evidence. There is no evidence that the errors in this category meet that test.\n\n142.\n\nWith regard to the second and third categories of reproductions, the question is whether they indicate a failure by the Tribunal to consider properly the arguments of Argentina and that this would amount to a manifest excess of power, a violation of a fundamental rule of procedure or a failure to state reasons. The Claimants argue that there could be no manifest excess of powers because there is no allegation that the Tribunal failed to apply the applicable law and that the claim that there was a violation of a fundamental rule of procedure has been made much too late.\n\n143.\n\nThe Committee agrees with the Claimants that there is no manifest excess of powers. There is no serious allegation of a failure to apply the applicable law or any evidence that the Tribunal in fact failed to apply the applicable law.\n\n144.\n\nHowever, the Committee is not convinced by the Claimants' argument that Argentina is prevented from arguing a violation of a fundamental rule of procedure by failing to raise its concerns about the Decision on Liability at an earlier stage. As Argentina correctly points out a decision of a tribunal cannot be annulled; only an award can be annulled.134 And while rectification or reconsideration may be a possibility, it was hardly a realistic possibility when Argentina was not claiming that there were errors that could be rectified; its challenge is to the reasoning and analysis of the Decision of Liability that were much more fundamental. The consequence of the Claimants' argument is that a party that believes that an annullable error has been committed must disclose its arguments on annulment long before the opportunity for bringing a request for annulment arises. Such an approach is inconsistent with the equality that the parties must have in being able to manage their claims in arbitration.\n\nArgentina's Reply, paras. 74-75. See *EDF International S.A, SAUR International S.A. and Le\u00f3n Participaciones Argentinas S.A. v. Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/03/23), Decision on Annulment, February 5, 2016, AL A RA 67, para. 62. See also Christoph Schreuer *et al.*, *The ICSID Convention: A Commentary*, 2009, AL A RA 56. p. 921.\n\n145.\n\nThere remains nonetheless the question whether the second and third category reproductions in the Award result in a departure from a fundamental rule of procedure or constitute a failure to state reasons. In this regard, while recognizing that it is not satisfactory for a tribunal to rely on the reasoning from the decision in another case without differentiation, the Committee has difficulty seeing what rule of procedure has been violated by the reproduction of text from the other arbitrations in this case. Argentina makes no claim that it has been denied due process or denied equal treatment or that its claim has been affected by some procedural irregularity. Argentina asserts that reproduction of text from the other cases constitutes a denial of its right to be heard by an open-minded tribunal, but its objection relates less to being heard than to the reasons advanced by the Tribunal in support of its conclusions.\n\n146.\n\nIndeed, the more substantial argument advanced by Argentina relates to the failure to state reasons, specifically in relation to fair and equitable treatment, the necessity defence and valuation. Yet, even here, the Committee is unable to conclude that the Tribunal failed to state reasons or that it had ignored arguments made by Argentina.\n\n147.\n\nFor example, Argentina claims that the Tribunal concluded on the basis of arguments made in the other cases that \"more flexible means\"135 could have been adopted to relieve the burden on the Concessionaire but that this conclusion is irrelevant in the context of the Santa Fe Concession and some temporary relief was granted. However, in the Committee's view, rather than a failure to state reasons this constitutes a rejection of the arguments of Argentina that this relief was sufficient. Equally, in respect of the arguments of Argentina regarding the Tribunal's comments on the \"persistent refusal to revise the tariff\"136 and \"forced renegotiation\"137, the complaints in substance are about the fact that the arguments of Argentina were rejected rather than they were not considered. In the Committee's view, there was no failure to state reasons.\n\nArgentina's Memorial, para. 80.\n\n*Ibid*., para. 81.\n\n*Ibid*., para. 82.\n\n148.\n\nThe Committee reaches the same conclusion with respect to Argentina's arguments regarding the defence of necessity and valuation. The Tribunal did not give the weight to the harshness of the effects on the Province of Santa Fe or that flooding that took place there that Argentina would have liked138, although both were mentioned in the Decision on Liability, but that does not constitute a failure to state reasons. The conclusion of the Tribunal that there was no \"equally detailed and convincing scenario\"139 for valuation put forward constitutes a rejection of the scenarios proposed by Argentina for the Santa Fe Concession, not a failure to state reasons. Furthermore, the arguments of Argentina against the adoption by the Tribunal of a valuation model based on *Acta III* are arguments that go to the merits of the decision in respect of valuation; they do not demonstrate a failure to state reasons.\n\n*Ibid*., paras. 87-88.\n\n*Ibid*., para. 92.\n\n149.\n\nThus, there is no evidence that the Tribunal failed to consider the arguments of Argentina. An inference is sought on the basis of the fact that language has been reproduced from the other awards that the Tribunal had not considered the specific facts of the Santa Fe Concession. But such an inference is not supported by any evidence. And in any event it is beyond the scope of annulment for a committee to reweigh the evidence considered by the tribunal.\n\n150.\n\nIn short, the Tribunal relied on reasons with which Argentina did not agree and did not agree with arguments made by Argentina. In substance, Argentina's argument is that the Tribunal was wrong in its conclusions on the merits. But, even if it could be shown that a tribunal is in error on the merits, this is not the basis for the annulment of an award.\n\n151.\n\nAccordingly, the Committee rejects Argentina's claim that the reproduction from texts of other awards constitutes a manifest excess of powers (Article 52(1)(b)), a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure (Article 52(1)(d)) or a failure to state reasons (Article 52(1)(e)).\n\n**B. PROFESSOR KAUFMANN-KOHLER'S APPOINTMENT AS DIRECTOR OF UBS AND HER FAILURE TO DISCLOSE AND INVESTIGATE**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n152.\n\nThe Respondent argues that the Tribunal was not properly constituted because one of the arbitrators, Professor Kaufmann-Kohler, did not meet the requirements of the ICSID Convention for appointment as arbitrator. Specifically, during the course of the arbitration Professor Kaufmann-Kohler accepted an appointment as a member of the Board of Directors of UBS, a company that held shares in one of the claimant companies, Suez. This, the Respondent argues, meant that Professor Kaufmann-Kohler could not \"be relied upon to exercise independent judgment\" contrary to the specific requirement of Article 14(1) of the ICSID Convention.140 Professor Kaufmann-Kohler failed to disclose this appointment to the parties and once it heard about the appointment the Respondent proposed her disqualification.\n\n*Ibid.*, para. 30.\n\n153.\n\nThe two unchallenged members of the Tribunal rejected the proposal for disqualification. However, the Respondent argues, the two arbitrators focused on the question of economic interest and failed to consider the obligation of institutional loyalty that Professor Kaufmann-Kohler had to UBS which created a conflict when she had to consider the interests of Suez in which UBS held shares.141\n\n*Ibid*., para. 129.\n\n154.\n\nThe Claimants argue that the Respondent's challenge under Article 52(1)(a) is based on an assumption that a tribunal may decide anew whether the requirements of Article 14(1) have been met. Moreover, in this case the challenge under Article 52(1)(a) has already been determined by the Tribunal. The Claimants refer to a body of annulment decisions dealing with similar circumstances which, they say, the Respondent has failed to mention, and state that what the Respondent is trying to do is draw the Committee into a *de novo* review of the decision in disqualification.142\n\nClaimants' Counter-Memorial, para. 82.\n\n155.\n\nThe Claimants identify two lines of reasoning in the annulment cases so far relating to annulments in cases where there has been a decision on disqualification of an arbitrator, neither of which permits a *de novo* consideration of whether the challenged arbitrator should be disqualified. One, based on the *Azurix* decision envisages only a review of the procedure under which that decision was made.143 The other decision, *EDF*, contemplates annulment of a decision relating to disqualification only where the decision is \"so plainly unreasonable that no reasonable decision-maker could have come to such a decision\".144 That approach was endorsed in the *Suez 3/19* case.145\n\n*Ibid.*, para. 85.\n\n*Ibid.*, para. 91, citing *Suez 3/19*, Decision on Annulment, May 5, 2017, A/CLA-56, para. 94 (quoting the *EDF* Decision on Annulment).\n\nClaimants' Counter-Memorial, paras. 90-91.\n\n156.\n\nThe Respondent argues that neither the approach in *Azurix* nor the approach in *EDF* find support in the wording of Article 52(1)(a).146 They both impose limitations on the powers of an annulment committee without explaining how these limitations are justified under the terms of Article 52(1)(a). The fact that there has been a decision on disqualification in the context of the original proceedings does not limit the jurisdiction of an annulment committee \"to determine the proper constitution of the tribunal\".147\n\nArgentina's Reply, paras. 18 and 26.\n\n*Ibid*., para. 30.\n\n157.\n\nIn response, the Claimants object again to the Respondent's perception of the standard of review and argue that the Respondent's interpretation of Article 52(1)(a) is incorrect and that decision of *EDF* was based on a \"meticulous analysis\" of the annulment provisions of the Convention.148 In any event, the Claimants argue, the Respondent has not shown that the Second Challenge Decision was so plainly unreasonable that no reasonable decision-maker could have come to that decision.\n\nClaimants' Rejoinder, paras. 21-28.\n\n158.\n\nThe disagreement of the Parties on the standard of review comes to the fore in their consideration of Article 52(1)(a). The Respondent's position is that since it is the responsibility of the committee to protect the integrity of the process in relation to the constitution of the tribunal in the case for which annulment is sought, it can review whether the tribunal was properly constituted. That to the Claimants constitutes *de novo* review. In short, the Claimants see the Respondent's approach as essentially an appeal from the Second Challenge Decision.\n\n159.\n\nIt is widely recognized that the power of annulment under Article 52 of the Convention does not extend to an appeal on facts or law. The question is where the distinction between appeal and annulment should be drawn. The Respondent claims that annulment should not be opposed to an appeal; the scope of annulment is determined by reference to the wording of Article 52 interpreted in accordance with the rules for the interpretation of treaties.149 The Claimants do not disagree with that assertion, although it disagrees with the Respondent's interpretation of Article 52(1)(a) which it considers amounts to mandating a *de novo* consideration of the issues. Rather, in the view of Claimants, the Committee must approach the interpretation of Article 52(1)(a) with a \"deferential standard of review\".150\n\nArgentina's Reply, para. 6.\n\nClaimants' Rejoinder, para. 30.\n\n160.\n\nThe Committee sees neither party as capturing accurately the standard of review when annulment is requested under Article 52(1)(a). That provision does not permit an annulment committee to consider the question whether a tribunal has been properly constituted as if it were deciding the matter for the first time. Further, the existence of a Decision on Disqualification by the original tribunal has to be something more than \"an element of judgment\" for an annulment committee to consider.151\n\nArgentina's Reply, para. 30.\n\n161.\n\nBut, equally, there is nothing in Article 52(1)(a), or elsewhere in Article 52, that prescribes a deferential standard of review. The Committee has to construe Article 52(1)(a) in light of the facts on which the claim to annulment takes place. Here the facts are that there has been a Decision on Disqualification by the unchallenged members of the original Tribunal and that must be addressed in any request for annulment on the basis that the Tribunal was not properly constituted.\n\n162.\n\nIn *EDF*, the committee made an important distinction between annulment requests under Article 52(1)(a) where no decision has already been made on disqualification and requests for annulment where a decision has already been made on disqualification by the original tribunal. This case falls into the latter category - a decision has already been made rejecting the request for disqualification.\n\n163.\n\nIn such a case, an annulment committee cannot take on itself the task of deciding whether the tribunal has been properly constituted. Article 58 has assigned that task to the unchallenged members of the tribunal and when those members have exercised that function an annulment committee is faced with findings of fact, an assessment of those facts and an application of law to those facts.152 The role of an annulment committee in these circumstances, the *EDF* committee said, is not to act as if it were sitting in appeal on those findings; it can only find that a ground of annulment exists if the decision is \"so plainly unreasonable that no reasonable decision-maker could come to such a decision\".153\n\n*EDF International SA and others v. Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No ARB/03/23), Decision on Annulment, February 5, 2016, AL A RA 67, para. 145.\n\n*Ibid*\n\n164.\n\nThe request before the Committee is for the annulment of the decision of the original Tribunal on disqualification and it is the decision of the Tribunal that must be looked at. In this case the Tribunal made a decision on its constitution. It considered the challenge to an arbitrator in accordance with Article 58 and concluded that the challenge could not be sustained. Thus, the request before this Committee is not whether in the abstract the Tribunal was properly constituted but whether the decision to reject the request for disqualification and accordingly that the Tribunal was properly constituted meets the appropriate standard of review.\n\n165.\n\nThe *EDF* committee, and subsequently the *Suez 3/19* committee, considered that the appropriate standard to apply was whether the decision was \"so plainly unreasonable that no reasonable decision-maker could come to such a decision\". This limited standard of review, set forth in *EDF,* is not derived expressly from an interpretation of Article 52(1)(a); it is derived from the view that annulment involves review of a limited nature; it does not operate as an appeal.154\n\n*EDF International SA and others v. Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No ARB/03/23), Decision on Annulment, February 5, 2016, AL A RA 67, para. 145.\n\n166.\n\nThe Committee is of the view that the approach in *EDF* and *Suez 3/19* should be followed. It is consistent with the more limited role that annulment plays in the ICSID system, but at the same time it appropriately protects the integrity of ICSID dispute settlement. The integrity of that system depends not on whether decisions are right or wrong - arbitrators may differ in their conclusions - but the integrity of the system will be under challenge if tribunals reach decisions that no reasonable decision-maker would reach.\n\n167.\n\nIn their Decision on Disqualification the unchallenged members of the Tribunal carefully reviewed the request made, the facts and arguments on which it was based, the law applicable to disqualification and how that applied to the request in respect of Professor Kaufmann-Kohler. They identified the criteria to be considered in determining whether an arbitrator's independence or impartiality would be affected. They considered the particular context in which Professor Kaufmann-Kohler operated as a director of UBS. Ultimately, they concluded that the alleged connection between the Claimants and Professor Kaufmann-Kohler did not lead to the conclusion that there was a manifest lack of the qualities of independence and impartiality that an arbitrator must have. Accordingly, they dismissed the request for the disqualification of Professor Kaufmann-Kohler.\n\n168.\n\nAs other committees have pointed out, there may be disagreements over the assessment of or weight to be given to particular facts or the application of the criteria for determining whether independence or impartiality can be called into question. But, on the basic question of whether the decision on disqualification was so plainly unreasonable that no reasonable decision-maker could have reached such a decision, the answer is clear. The decision on disqualification in the present case could not be regarded as so plainly unreasonable that no decision-make could have reached that decision. Indeed, decision-makers in other cases have reached precisely the same decision on essentially the same grounds in respect of attempts to disqualify Professor Kaufmann-Kohler as was reached in the present case.\n\n169.\n\nAccordingly, the Committee rejects the claim that the Tribunal was not properly constituted on the ground that Professor Kaufmann-Kohler manifestly lacked the necessary independence and impartiality required by Article 14 of the ICSID Convention.\n\n170.\n\nIn the Committee's view, this conclusion that the Tribunal was not improperly constituted covers equally the contention of Argentina that its right to an impartial and independent tribunal was contravened, leading to a breach of a fundamental rule of procedure pursuant to Article 52(1)(d). The conclusion of the unchallenged members on disqualification that the allegations against Professor Kaufmann-Kohler did not compromise her independence and impartiality was a decision that the Tribunal as composed was an independent and impartial Tribunal. Their conclusions also exonerated Professor Kaufmann-Kohler from breaching any obligation to investigate and disclose which could have amounted to a breach of a fundamental rule of procedure. The question for the Committee is whether that decision was so plainly unreasonable that no decision-maker could have reached it. Again, it must be answered that it was not.\n\n171.\n\nHaving said this, the Committee notes the generally unsatisfactory nature of the process for dealing with challenges to arbitrators, which poses a particular burden on the unchallenged members who are required to determine whether the other member of the tribunal should be disqualified. The difficulty of this role extends to formulating the appropriate test for deciding on disqualification in the absence of clear guidance in the Convention. In this regard, the Committee has some reservations about certain aspects of the test applied by the unchallenged arbitrators in deciding on the issue of disqualification in this case. The test, the Tribunal said, is whether the facts show that an \"informed reasonable person\" would conclude that the person in question \"clearly or obviously lacks the quality of being able to exercise independent judgment and impartiality\".155 Yet, when it comes to their analysis, the unchallenged members show that a quite detailed understanding of the nature of a director's interest, the way UBS functions and the implications of UBS's holding shares in other companies is required to assess whether there is a manifest lack of independence and impartiality. In other words, in practice the reasonably informed observer has to be a well-informed observer capable of understanding a level of detail not readily ascertained by the reasonable observer.\n\nSecond Challenge Decision, para. 29.\n\n172.\n\nThe Committee's concern, therefore, is that in establishing the level of knowledge that needs to be had to understand whether there is manifest lack of independence or impartiality, insufficient attention may be given to the question of the perception of lack of independence or impartiality. In this respect there may be a difference between commercial arbitration, for which the IBA rules were developed, and investment arbitration where there is much greater a degree of public interest in the process and outcomes. In the Committee's view, these are matters that might be taken into account in the future when challenges are made to arbitrators on the basis of a conflict of interest.\n\n**C. FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH THE 18 MONTHS' LOCAL LITIGATION REQUIREMENT**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n173.\n\nArgentina argues that the decision of the Tribunal to allow AGBAR and Interagua, through the application of the MFN provision in Article IV(2) of the Argentina-Spain BIT, to be relieved from the obligation under Article X(3)(a) to commence litigation and pursue it for 18 months before bringing their claim should be annulled. The provisions of the Argentina-France BIT, which had no 18-month local litigation requirement, were invoked as a justification for not complying the 18-month litigation rule. This decision is claimed by Argentina as annullable both on the basis that it constitutes a manifest excess of power and on the basis that there has been a failure to state reasons.\n\n174.\n\nThe Committee observes that the question of whether an MFN provision in an investment agreement can be invoked in order to obtain the benefits of dispute settlement provisions in another investment agreement, and specifically an 18-month local litigation requirement, has arisen in a good many cases and inspired a substantial scholarly literature. Arbitrators have divided on the question, but there is a considerable body of jurisprudence supporting the position taken by the Tribunal in this case. At the same time there have been a number of cases, including more recent decisions, which have interpreted MFN clauses not to include a reference to dispute settlement provisions.\n\n175.\n\nIn the Committee's view, the matter depends on the interpretation of the MFN provision in question. The MFN provision in this case, Article IV(2) of Argentina-Spain BIT, provides:\n\nIn all matters governed by this Agreement, such treatment shall be no less favorable than that accorded by each Party to investments made in its territory by investors of a third country.\n\n176.\n\nProvisions with essentially identical wording have been interpreted to permit the importation of dispute settlement provisions from other BITs and used as a basis for permitting a claimant to bypass the 18-month local litigation requirement.156 In light of the fact that there is a body of jurisprudence that supports using MFN clauses in this way, the Committee has difficulty seeing how the Tribunal in this case has \"manifestly exceeded its powers\". It is true that there are contrary decisions, but even if there were a divided jurisprudence with strong support for the view contrary to that taken by the Tribunal, a claimed excess of power could not be \"manifest\". In saying this, the Committee takes no position in the debate over MFN clauses and their application to procedural or dispute settlement provisions.\n\nSee *Emilio Agust\u00edn Maffezini v. Kingdom of Spain* (ICSID Case No. ARB/97/7), Decision of the Tribunal on Objections to Jurisdiction, January 25, 2000, AL A RA 91.\n\n177.\n\nArgentina argues that there was a manifest excess of power because the Tribunal established that there was a mandatory rule in the BIT that there must be an 18-month resort to local jurisdiction but then disregarded that mandatory rule. But here Argentina is begging the question. The 18-month local litigation requirement stands only if it is not superseded by application of the MFN clause. The Tribunal decided that it was so superseded. There can be no manifest excess of power here.\n\n178.\n\nIn respect of both its claim that there has been a manifest excess of powers and the failure to state reasons, Argentina invokes the argument that the decision of the Tribunal is contrary to the consent that it gave on entering into the Argentina-Spain BIT. But this is an argument on the merits of the use of MFN clauses to incorporate procedural or dispute settlement provisions and it is commonly raised by the parties in cases where the MFN clause has been invoked in respect of such dispute settlement provisions. It is beyond the mandate of an annulment committee to consider the merits of the case and thus these arguments cannot support a claim to annulment.\n\n179.\n\nArgentina refers to other instances where it considers that the Tribunal did not take its arguments into account, including its subsequent practice in concluding bilateral investment treaties and other indications of its intent on agreeing to the MFN provision. In this regard, Argentina seeks to build an inference of failing to consider evidence on the basis that there was no specific mention of it. But the Tribunal interpreted the MFN provision on the basis of Article 31 of the Vienna Convention and concluded that it did not find evidence of the intent of the parties for the position claimed by Argentina. It is not possible to draw from this conclusion the supposition that the Tribunal must have ignored arguments for the contrary position. Moreover, Argentina's arguments essentially go to the merits of the interpretation of the MFN clause. Argentina does not agree with the Tribunal's interpretation of the MFN provision in this case, but because there is disagreement with a tribunal's conclusions does not mean that the tribunal has failed to state reasons. In the present case, the Tribunal discussed the arguments of Argentina and reviewed relevant case law. It stated reasons for its decision and disagreement with those reasons or with the result reached cannot lead to the conclusion that the Tribunal failed to state reasons.\n\n180.\n\nAccordingly, the Committee rejects Argentina's claim for annulment on the basis that the wrongful application of the MFN provision constituted a manifest excess of power or a failure to state supporting reasons.\n\n**D. NECESSITY UNDER CUSTOMARY INTERNATIONAL LAW**\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n181.\n\nArgentina argues that the Tribunal exceeded its powers by failing to establish the legal standards applicable to the \"only way\" and \"non-contribution\" requirements for the defence of necessity. It also argues that the Tribunal failed to state reasons for its conclusions on these matters, or provide reasons for its rejection of Argentina's arguments on the human right to water. Further, Argentina claims, the Tribunal ignored large volumes of documentary, expert and witness evidence submitted to it by Argentina. It claims that the Tribunal did not meet the standards set out by the *Enron* annulment committee for the consideration and analysis of evidence and arguments.\n\n182.\n\nThe Tribunal identified the four conditions that must be met to sustain a defence of necessity, on the basis of ILC Article 25(1), and then analyzed each in turn.157 In respect of the \"only way\" condition, the Tribunal stated that it was not convinced that the only way for Argentina to satisfy its essential interest in the health and well being of the population was to adopt a measure that violated Argentina's treaty obligations. It stated that more flexible means could have been adopted. In respect of the \"non-contribution\" condition the Tribunal noted that the word \"contribution\" was not the same as \"cause\". The question then was whether Argentina's contribution to the crisis was sufficiently substantial to rule out the defence of necessity. It concluded that government policies and shortcomings were sufficiently substantial contributions to the crisis and as a result rejected the defence of necessity.\n\nDecision on Liability, paras. 237-242.\n\n183.\n\nThe Committee notes that the *ad hoc* committee in *Enron*, identified a number of questions that on the facts of that case should have been asked before determining the application of the \"only way\" test. In the present case, however, it is clear that the Tribunal took the view that if there were other available measures that could have been taken then the \"only way\" condition would not be satisfied. And it found on the facts that there were other and more flexible means that could have been resorted to. The Committee does not see any failure to articulate the applicable law or any other manifest excess of power here.\n\n184.\n\nIn respect of the \"non-contribution\" condition, the Tribunal identified the relevant legal requirement that the contribution be sufficiently substantial to prevent the defence of necessity from being relied on. It made a determination on the facts that the contribution by the Argentine government both through its policies and its failure to act when it might have done so to be sufficiently substantial within the meaning of the test so identified. The Tribunal established the legal standard and applied the facts to it. For the Committee to go behind this would be to engage in an analysis of the substantive issues in the case, something beyond the mandate of an *ad hoc* committee. In short, the Committee does not consider that the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers in the application of the \"non-contribution\" condition in considering the defence of necessity.\n\n185.\n\nAccordingly, the Committee rejects Argentina's contention that the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers, contrary to Article 52(1)(b) of the Convention.\n\n186.\n\nArgentina's further argument is that the Tribunal failed to state reasons in its treatment of the necessity defence. According to Argentina, the Tribunal failed to provide reasons for its rejection of Argentina's argument relating to the human right to water, drawing a comparison with the treatment of that issue in the *Urbaser* decision. It further argued that the Tribunal had disregarded a substantial body of documentary, expert and witness evidence put forward by Argentina. In this respect Argentina invokes the decision of the annulment committee in *TECO v. Guatemala*.\n\n187.\n\nThe Tribunal indicated in its Decision on Liability that it did not find any basis in international law or the BIT for the view that the human right to water somehow overrode Argentina's obligations under its BIT or gave it a right to disregard those obligations.158 Those obligations had to exist alongside each other and the Tribunal considered that it was possible to comply with both.\n\nDecision on Liability, para. 240.\n\n188.\n\nThe Committee does not find here a failure to state reasons. While it is true that the *Urbaser* tribunal put much more weight on the human right to water, that is a difference in assessing the strength of legal argument, not a failure to provide reasons. The Tribunal stated reasons albeit they were reasons with which Argentina does not agree.\n\n189.\n\nArgentina's argument that the Tribunal disregarded a substantial body of documentary, expert and witness evidence is also difficult to sustain. Clearly a tribunal does not have to provide an analysis and conclusions on every piece of evidence before it. Thus, the absence of mention of a specific document or report cannot lead to the conclusion that it was necessarily ignored. As mentioned in the conclusions on the reproduction issue, for example, the Tribunal did refer to the flooding that took place in the Province of Santa Fe. It had before it all of the materials in the pleadings and it was for the Tribunal to assign the appropriate weight to that material. This is not a case like *TECO v. Guatemala* where the tribunal proceeded on the basis that there was no evidence when in fact there was evidence before it on the issue.159 Again, Argentina is seeking to draw from the fact that the Tribunal disagreed with its arguments an inference that it had failed to consider the evidence in support of those arguments.\n\n*TECO Guatemala Holdings LLC v. Guatemala* (ICSID Case No. ARB/10/23), Decision on Annulment, April 5, 2016, AL A RA 61, para. 133.\n\n190.\n\nIn short, what Argentina is attacking is the substance of the issue. It does not agree with the Tribunal on the merits of its decision. But that is not a ground on which there can be annulment. The Committee thus rejects Argentina's contention that the Tribunal failed to state reasons in respect of the necessity defence contrary to Article 52(1)(e) of the Convention.\n\n**E. VALUATION OF DAMAGES**\n---------------------------\n\n191.\n\nArgentina identifies four bases for the annulment of the Award of the Tribunal in relation to the valuation of damages. The Committee will deal with each of these separately.\n\n192.\n\nArgentina argues that the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers, and failed to provide reasons, by awarding damages for termination of the Concession Contract, even though it had found in its Decision on Liability that there had been no breach of the BIT through the termination of the Concession Contract.\n\n193.\n\nThe Tribunal dealt with this issue when considering the length of the valuation period. Indeed, Argentina had made precisely the same argument to the Tribunal. However, the Tribunal took the view that it was not providing damages as if there had been a termination of the Concession Contract. Rather, it was recognizing that the Claimants were entitled to recover the full extent of their loss, which could not be reduced because of some potential future termination of the Concession Contract. The risk of termination was a factor taken into account in the discount rate applied to the twenty-three years of projected cash flows.160 Argentina argues that there is no proof that the risk of termination was factored into the discount rate. However, the Claimants argue that a market risk premium included the risk of termination.\n\nAward, December 4, 2015, paras. 40-42.\n\n194.\n\nThe Committee notes that the arguments made by Argentina here were precisely those raised by Argentina before the Tribunal and rejected. Thus, Argentina is essentially asking for a reconsideration of the Tribunal's decision on the merits of the damages award. There can be no manifest excess of power where a tribunal makes a decision on a matter that is within its jurisdiction to make - the length of the valuation period for determining loss. In addition, the Tribunal stated reasons for not limiting the period to the date on which termination had taken place. It considered that such a limitation would undercompensate the Claimants for their loss.\n\n195.\n\nFurthermore the Tribunal said that the risk of termination had been factored into the discount rate. Argentina queries whether this was so since there was no specific mention on that fact in the Report of the Expert, but in the face of the Tribunal's statement that the risk of termination had been included in the discount rate, there is no basis for speculating otherwise.\n\n196.\n\nThe Committee thus concludes that the Tribunal did not manifestly exceed its powers or fail to state reasons in respect of the length of the period chosen for the valuation of loss and the treatment of the risk of termination within the discount rate for the twenty-three year period of cash flows.\n\n197.\n\nArgentina also argues that the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers and seriously departed from fundamental rules of procedure and failed to state reasons in relying on the report of the expert Dr. Deep who had based his valuation on a proposal known as *Acta III*, which had never been adopted and was not part of the applicable framework. The principles behind *Acta III*, Argentina contends, had been rejected by the Tribunal in its Decision on Liability.161\n\nDecision on Liability, para. 119.\n\n198.\n\nWhether it was appropriate to rely on *Acta III* was argued before the Tribunal, which considered the arguments made by Argentina and concluded that the expert Dr. Deep had relied appropriately on *Acta III*, not because it was part of the applicable legal framework, but because it was \"strong evidence of how a reasonable regulator would act\" in circumstances at the time of the Argentinian crisis.162 In short, the Tribunal considered the arguments of Argentina opposing reliance on *Acta III* and rejected them giving reasons for doing so. Argentina's complaint is with the decision reached by the Tribunal, but that is not a basis for annulment.\n\nAward, para. 58.\n\n199.\n\nOn this basis the Committee can see no manifest excess of power or any serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure or a failure to state reasons in the reliance placed on *Acta III*.\n\n200.\n\nArgentina also argues that the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers and seriously departed from a fundamental rule of procedure by including sponsored debt as a recoverable loss even though it did not identify it as a protected investment earlier in the proceedings. Equally, it manifestly exceeded its powers and failed to state reasons in concluding that Argentina would have provided fair and equitable treatment if it had reviewed tariffs to allow APSF to repay the secured debt.\n\n201.\n\nThe Tribunal rejected Argentina's view that sponsored debts should not be recoverable because they were highly risky on the basis that all investment contains some risk. The reason for allowing recovery was that losses on sponsored debt were a \"direct consequence of Argentina's treaty violations\".163\n\n*Ibid*., para. 66.\n\n202.\n\nThe Committee cannot see how the inclusion of losses on sponsored debt constituted a manifest excess of power. It was part of the process of assessing and quantifying loss, something that is clearly within the power of a tribunal. The Tribunal provided reasons for so doing - it was a loss that flowed from Argentina's breach of the BIT. Accordingly, the Committee does not find the Tribunal's treatment of sponsored debt as an annullable error.\n\n203.\n\nArgentina further argues that including management fees within the recoverable loss constitutes a manifest excess of power and a failure to state reasons, claiming that management fees were only defined as a protected investment in the decision on damages in the Award. The Tribunal took the view that the management contract, which provided for the payment of fees, was an integral part of the Claimants' investment164 and thus the loss of management fees was an appropriate item to include in the loss suffered by Suez as a result of Argentina's failure to provide fair and equitable treatment.\n\n*Ibid.*, para. 72.\n\n204.\n\nThe Committee considers that whether management fees were to be recovered fell clearly within the power of the Tribunal to determine damages and thus there can be no manifest excess of power. Thus, Argentina's complaint that recovery should not be allowed for management fees is a complaint about the substantive conclusion of the Tribunal on the merits of the case, which is not a matter for annulment.\n\n205.\n\nIn concluding that management fees were recoverable, the Tribunal considered extensively the justification in the Management Contract for the payment of such fees and the report of the expert on how those fees and interest were to be calculated. The Committee considered that this ample treatment of the issue fully responds to the need to state reasons.\n\n206.\n\nArgentina argues in addition that the treatment of interest by the Tribunal in actualizing damages constituted a manifest excess of power by the Tribunal and a failure to state reasons in that the Tribunal used an interest rate that was higher than that agreed between the parties. It also argued that the Tribunal rectified the decision on contingency debt with an interest rate higher than that suggested by the parties. Thus, the decision of the Tribunal on interest was *ultra petita*. The Claimants deny that there was agreement on an interest rate and argued that what the Tribunal awarded was within the range put forward by the Claimants.\n\n207.\n\nThe Tribunal had to determine the amount payable on sponsored debt as a result of the APSF's default which was a consequence of Argentina's measures. That default had triggered contingent obligations to pay to the lenders. The losses to the Claimants were determined by the Tribunal to be the amounts actually paid and then actualized to December 31, 2012, on the basis of the interest rate proposed by the expert Dr. Deep of a compounded six-monthly Eurodollar rate. The Claimants had proposed instead a rate based on the APSF's weighted cost of capital. The Tribunal rejected this rate because it was based on treating the amounts payable as an investment rather than as a debt and the Tribunal simply followed Dr. Deep's recommendation of the compounded six-monthly Eurodollar rate.\n\n208.\n\nIn respect of the rate applied to the rectification of the decision on contingency debt, the Tribunal applied the rate that was stipulated in the Debt Restructuring Agreement of March 3, 2005.\n\n209.\n\nThe Committee notes that the position of the Claimants on the applicable interest rate did vary in respect of different periods for which damages were payable and that at one point the parties both proposed a risk free rate based on 6-month US Treasury Bills for the period February-November 2006. But for the rest the parties differed. However, as the Claimants point out in Appendix II to their Rejoinder, overall their position on interest was for an amount higher than that of Argentina and than that ultimately adopted by the Tribunal.165 Argentina produces no evidence to support its proposition that the parties had agreed on the interest rate.\n\nClaimants' Rejoinder, paras. 113-115.\n\n210.\n\nAccordingly, the Committee does not see any basis for a claim that the decision of the Tribunal on interest was *ultra petita*. A Tribunal has some discretion in the determination of interest166 and there is no indication that the decision on interest here exceeded the powers of the Tribunal. Equally, the Committee does not see the adoption of the interest rate set out in the Debt Restructuring Agreement to exceed the powers of the Tribunal. The Committee also considers that the decision of the Tribunal is reasoned. It adopts the analysis of the expert Dr. Deep and explains fully its position on the claims made. There is thus no failure to state reasons.\n\n*Wena Hotels LTD. v.

DECISION ON COSTS**\n---------------------------\n\n**A. ARGENTINA'S STATEMENT OF COSTS**\n-------------------------------------\n\n212.\n\nArgentina requests that the \"Claimants bear all of [the] attorneys' fees and any costs arising from this proceeding.\"167 These costs are broken down in Argentina's Statement of Costs as follows:\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Description | Dollars (USD) |\n| ICSID Costs | 675,000.00 |\n| Treasury Attorney-General's Office personnel costs | 103,801.31 |\n| Airline tickets, hotel and travel expenses | 21,850.00 |\n| Translations | 6,626.10 |\n| Courier | 4,235.24 |\n| Stationary | 850.00 |\n| Communication expenses | 300.00 |\n| Total | 812,662.65 |\n\nArgentina's Memorial, para. 251; Argentina's Reply, para. 307.\n\n**B. CLAIMANTS' STATEMENT OF COSTS**\n------------------------------------\n\n213.\n\nClaimants request that \"Argentina bear all costs and expenses incurred by the Claimants in connection with the present annulment proceedings, including the fees of the Centre, the costs and fees of the *ad hoc* Committee, and the Claimants' legal fees and expenses.\"168 These costs are broken down in Annex A to the Claimants' Statement of Costs as follows:\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Legal Fees and Expenses | Totals |\n| Legal Fees | $1,250,783.08 |\n| Translations | $23,468.89 |\n| Travel | $13,542.84 |\n| Printing | $9,618.69 |\n| Courier | $3,428.87 |\n| Online Research | $1,072.73 |\n| Total | $1,301,915.10 |\n\nClaimants' Counter-Memorial, para. 301.\n\n214.\n\nClaimants refer to Article 52(4) of the Convention, which grants annulment committees the power to require losing parties \"to pay their opponents' expenses in appropriate circumstances\". Claimants argue that the circumstances in these proceedings justify Argentina bearing the Claimants' costs because:\n\na. Annulment committees have ordered unsuccessful applicants to pay part or all of the prevailing party's costs in comparable cases, particularly where applications for annulment have been rejected in their entirety;169\n\nb. Cost-shifting is the only check on the losing party's temptation to commence annulment proceedings as a matter of course, and holding Argentina accountable for the costs of this proceeding will discourage future abusive requests for annulment. In this regard, the Claimants observe that \"it should not be overlooked that Argentina has sought the annulment of every ICSID award rendered against it\"170 and argue that costs should be awarded \"to disincentive [sic.] the reflexive use of the annulment mechanism\"171 by Argentina.\n\n*Ibid.*, para. 304.\n\n*Ibid.*, para. 306.\n\n*Ibid*.\n\n215.\n\nClaimants further observe that \"the practice of dividing arbitration costs and legal fees evenly has increasingly fallen out of favor\"172 and that the question before the Committee in this proceeding is \"less whether the costs of the proceeding should remain with Argentina and more whether Argentina should also pay the Claimants' legal fees and expenses.\"173 Claimants submit that most committees have simply applied the rule that \"costs follow the event\", even when they have not cited the weakness of an annulment application as a reason for allocating costs.\n\nClaimants' Rejoinder, para. 217.\n\n*Ibid.*, para. 218.\n\n**C. COMMITTEE'S DECISION**\n---------------------------\n\n216.\n\nArticle 61(2) of the ICSID Convention provides:\n\nIn the case of arbitration proceedings the Tribunal shall, except as the parties otherwise agree, assess the expenses incurred by the parties in connection with the proceedings, and shall decide how and by whom those expenses, the fees and expenses of the members of the Tribunal and the charges for the use of the facilities of the Centre shall be paid. Such decision shall form part of the award.\n\n217.\n\nThis provision, together with Arbitration Rule 47(1)(j) (applied to these proceedings by virtue of Arbitration Rule 53) gives the Committee discretion to allocate all costs of the arbitration.\n\n218.\n\nIn accordance with Administrative and Financial Regulation 14(3)(e), Argentina, as the Party seeking annulment of the Award, has been responsible to date for all the advance payments required to cover the costs of the proceeding, including the fees and expenses of the members of the Committee.\n\n219.\n\nThe costs of the proceeding, including the fees and expenses of the Committee, ICSID's administrative fees and direct expenses, amount to:\n\nCommittee's fees and expenses:\n\nProfessor Donald M. McRae USD 72,811.90\n\nProfessor Doug Jones USD 119,653.71\n\nTan Sri Dato' Cecil W.M. Abraham USD 87,141.65\n\nICSID's administrative fees USD 116,000.00\n\nDirect expenses174 USD 52,710.80\n\n**Total USD 448,318.06**\n\nThis amount includes charges relating to court reporting and interpretation, catering and courier, and estimated charges relating to the dispatch of this Decision (courier, printing and copying).\n\n220.\n\nThe Committee notes that the Claimants were successful in opposing the annulment in this case and that success by a party should have an impact on costs. Nonetheless, the Committee does not consider that the request for annulment in this case can be regarded as an abusive request for annulment as the Claimants assert. As the Committee has pointed out, the extent to which the Award of the Tribunal reproduced reasoning from other arbitrations and errors made in identifying facts and circumstances created an understandable apprehension on the part of Argentina, although in the end it did not justify annulment.\n\n221.\n\nAccordingly, the Committee decides that the parties should each bear their own costs and share equally the costs and expenses of these proceedings. The Claimants shall thus pay half of the costs of the annulment proceeding, including the fees and expenses of the Members of the Committee and the costs of the Centre.175\n\nThe remaining balance of the advances will be reimbursed to Argentina. The ICSID Secretariat will provide the Parties with a detailed financial statement of the case account as soon as all invoices are received, and the account is final.\n\n**IX. DECISION**\n----------------\n\n222.\n\nFor the reasons set out above, the Committee decides as follows:\n\n1. Argentina's request for annulment is denied.\n\n2. Each Party shall bear its own legal costs and expenses incurred in connection with this annulment proceeding.\n\n3. Each Party shall bear half of ICSID's administrative fees and expenses incurred in connection with this proceeding, including the fees and expenses of the Members of the Committee.\n\n4. All other requests by the Parties are dismissed."}]}
