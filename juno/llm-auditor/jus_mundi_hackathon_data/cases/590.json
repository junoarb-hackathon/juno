SUBJECT MATTER OF THIS DECISION**\n--------------------------------------\n\n1.\n\nThe present decision deals with a Request for Provisional Measures (\"Claimants\u2019 RPM\") filed by Claimants Quiborax S.A. (\"Quiborax\"), Allan Fosk and Non Metallic Minerals S.A. (\"NMM\") on 14 September 2009, by which Claimants request that the Arbitral Tribunal:\n\n(1) Order Bolivia and/or Bolivia\u2019s agencies or entities to refrain from engaging in any conduct that aggravates the dispute between the parties and/or alters the *status quo*, including any conduct, resolution or decision related to criminal proceedings in Bolivia against persons directly or indirectly related to the present arbitration;\n\n(2) Order Bolivia and/or Bolivia\u2019s agencies or entities to discontinue immediately and/or to cause to be discontinued all proceedings in Bolivia, including criminal proceedings and any course of action relating in any way to this arbitration and which jeopardize the procedural integrity of these proceedings;\n\n(3) Order Bolivia and/or Bolivia\u2019s agencies or entities to discontinue immediately and/or to cause to be discontinued all proceedings in Bolivia, including criminal proceedings and any course of action relating in any way to this arbitration and which threaten the exclusivity of the ICSID arbitration.1\n\nClaimants\u2019 RPM, p. 22.\n\n2.\n\nIn their Reply on Provisional Measures (\"Claimants\u2019 Reply\"), Claimants supplemented this request with a fourth request for relief:\n\n(4) Order Bolivia and/or Bolivia\u2019s agencies or entities to deliver to Claimants the corporate administration of NMM sequestered in the course of the criminal proceedings.2\n\nClaimants\u2019 Reply, \u00b6 126.\n\n3.\n\nThe Plurinational State of Bolivia (\"Bolivia\" or \"Respondent\") has objected to Claimants\u2019 Request for Provisional Measures and has requested the Tribunal to:\n\n(1) Reject Claimants\u2019 Request for Provisional Measures;\n\n(2) Refrain from adopting the measures that have been requested; and\n\n(3) Order Claimants to pay the expenses that Bolivia has had to incur because of their groundless and reckless request.3\n\nRespondent\u2019s Rejoinder, \u00b6 81.\n\n**II. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND**\n-----------------------------------------\n\n**A. Origin of the Dispute and Procedural History**\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n4.\n\nThe dispute between the Parties originates from the revocation by Presidential Decreto Supremo 27,589 of 23 June 2004 (\"D.S. 27,589\"), of eleven mining concessions allegedly held by Claimants in Bolivia (the \"Bolivian Concessions\"). The concessions were held by investment vehicle and co-Claimant NMM. Co-Claimants Quiborax and Allan Fosk, both Chilean nationals, claim to have a 51% majority interest in NMM and a 100% interest in the Bolivian Concessions.\n\n5.\n\nClaimants allege that the revocation of the Bolivian Concessions was a confiscatory measure. Claimants state that D.S. 27,589 revoked the Bolivian Concessions for alleged violations of Bolivian law, on the basis of Law 2,564 of 9 December 2003 (\"Law 2,564\"), which Claimants allege was tailor-made to authorize the Executive to annul Claimants\u2019 concessions retroactively. Claimants also claim that D.S. 27,589 applied Law 2,564 incorrectly, because the Executive\u2019s authority to annul had expired on 9 February 2004, and thus D.S. 27,589 is unlawful under domestic Bolivian law.\n\n6.\n\nClaimants allege that D.S. 27,589 violates Claimants\u2019 rights as foreign investors in Bolivia under the *Acuerdo entre la Rep\u00fablica de Bolivia y la Rep\u00fablica de Chile para la Promoci\u00f3n y Protecci\u00f3n Rec\u00edproca de Inversiones* (the \"BIT\"). On 22 July 2004, Claimants requested friendly consultations in accordance with Art. X of the BIT. This request did not lead to a resolution of the dispute, and on 4 October 2005, Claimants filed a Request for Arbitration before ICSID, which was registered on 6 February 2006.\n\n7.\n\nIn their Request for Arbitration, Claimants asked the Tribunal to declare that Bolivia breached: (i) Art. VI of the BIT by depriving Claimants of their investment in Bolivia; (ii) Art. IV of the BIT by not providing Claimants fair and equitable treatment; and (iii) Art. III of the BIT by not protecting Claimants\u2019 investment in Bolivia and submitting Claimants to unreasonable and discriminatory measures. Claimants requested compensation of all damages suffered as a consequence of these violations, plus interest, as well as all costs of arbitration and all other costs incurred as a consequence of Bolivia\u2019s allegedly unlawful acts.\n\n8.\n\nThe dispute continued to escalate after Claimants\u2019 request for friendly consultations. Bolivia set up an inter-ministerial task force to evaluate the merits of Claimants\u2019 claims. In an internal memorandum dated 8 December 2004 (the \"2004 Memo\"), the task force concluded that D.S. 27,589 suffered serious legal defects and that the case was about to become an international predicament for Bolivia.4 The task force outlined different scenarios to aid Bolivia\u2019s defense strategy, recommending as the \"best alternative\" to try to demonstrate the existence of flaws in the processing of the concessions.5\n\n*See* 2004 Memo (Annex CPM-5), p. 11.\n\n*Id*., pp. 10-11.\n\n9.\n\nOn 28 October 2004, the Bolivian Mining Superintendency annulled the already revoked concessions.6 At the same time, Claimants allege that Bolivia submitted NMM to multiple tax investigations. By November 2007, Claimants state that NMM had been ordered to pay approximately US$ 1,200,000 in alleged taxes and fines.\n\n*See* Writs of Annulment (Annex CPM-6).\n\n10.\n\nDuring this period, the Parties engaged in prolonged negotiations. Following constitution of the Tribunal on 19 December 2007, on the day of the first Procedural Session on 20 March 2008, the Parties communicated to the Tribunal that they had reached an oral settlement agreement. Upon request from the Parties, the proceedings were suspended.\n\n11.\n\nNine months later, Bolivia initiated criminal actions against several persons related directly or indirectly to the present arbitration, including co-Claimant Allan Fosk. Claiming that Bolivia had repudiated the oral agreement, on 14 January 2009 Claimants requested the Tribunal to resume the arbitration.\n\n12.\n\nBy Procedural Order No. 1 of 5 March 2009, the Tribunal set the calendar for the Parties\u2019 presentations. After certain changes requested or agreed by the Parties, by letter of 17 September 2009 the Tribunal amended the procedural schedule as follows:\n\n1. On or before **14 September 2009**, the Claimants shall file their Memorial.\n\n2. At its option, the Respondent shall file either:\n\n2.1 Objections to the jurisdiction of the Tribunal by no later than **15 January 2010** ; or\n\n2.2 A Counter-memorial on the merits by no later than **15 January 2010**.\n\n**Proceedings following paragraph 2.1 above:**\n\n3. On or before **16 April 2010**, the Claimants shall file their Counter-memorial on jurisdiction.\n\n4. On or before **18 June 2010**, the Respondent shall file its Reply on jurisdiction.\n\n5. On or before **20 August 2010**, the Claimants shall file their Rejoinder on jurisdiction.\n\n6. On **23 September 2010**, the Tribunal will hold a hearing on jurisdiction in Paris, at a location to be later specified. On a date to be later determined but at least two weeks before the hearing on jurisdiction, the Tribunal will hold a pre-hearing telephone conference to address any outstanding issues relating to the forthcoming hearing.\n\n7. Thereafter, the Tribunal will issue a decision or award on jurisdiction and, if applicable, a procedural order on the continuance of the proceedings on the merits, it being specified that, in this latter case, the Respondent will be required to submit its Counter-memorial on the merits no later than four months from the date of the said procedural order.\n\n**Proceedings following paragraph 2.2 above:**\n\n8. On or before **15 March 2010**, the Claimants shall file their Reply on the merits.\n\n9. On or before **17 May 2010**, the Respondent shall file its Rejoinder on the merits.\n\n10. On **22 to 26 June 2010** (the exact number of days being determined during the pre-hearing telephone conference), the Tribunal will hold a hearing on the merits and, if applicable on jurisdiction, in Paris, at a location to be later specified. On a date to be later determined but at least two weeks before said hearing, the Tribunal will hold a pre-hearing telephone conference to address any outstanding issues relating to the forthcoming hearing.\n\n13.\n\nOn 14 September 2009, Claimants submitted their Memorial, simultaneously with a Request for Provisional Measures.\n\n14.\n\nBy letter of 22 September 2009, the Tribunal invited Respondent to submit its observations on Claimants\u2019 Request for Provisional Measures by 13 October 2009. On 23 September 2009, Respondent requested an extension to submit its observations. The Tribunal invited Claimants to comment on this request by 5 October 2009.\n\n15.\n\nOn 2 October 2009, Claimants filed a request for a \"temporary restraining order.\" On that same date, the Tribunal invited Respondent to provide its observations by 5 October 2009.\n\n16.\n\nOn 5 October 2009, after receiving Respondent\u2019s observations, the Tribunal denied Claimants\u2019 request for a \"temporary restraining order\" and, based on the circumstances surrounding Claimants\u2019 latest request, denied Respondent\u2019s request for an extension to submit its observations on Claimants\u2019 Request for Provisional Measures. The Tribunal invited the Parties to submit brief rebuttals on 21 October 2009 and 29 October 2009, respectively.\n\n17.\n\nOn 14 October 2009, Respondent filed its Objection to Claimants\u2019 Request for Provisional Measures (\"Respondent\u2019s Objection\"). On 21 October 2009, Claimants filed their Reply, and on 29 October 2009 Respondent filed its Rejoinder.\n\n18.\n\nOn 24 November 2009, the Tribunal and the Parties participated in a telephone conference where the Parties supplemented their written submissions. The following persons participated in the telephone conference:\n\n*Members of the Tribunal*\n\nProfessor Gabrielle Kaufmann-Kohler, President of the Tribunal Professor Brigitte Stern, Arbitrator Hon. Marc Lalonde, Arbitrator\n\n*ICSID Secretariat*\n\nMs. Natal\u00ed Sequeira, Secretary of the Tribunal\n\n*Representing Claimants* Mr. Allan Fosk, Claimant\n\nMr. Andr\u00e9s Jana, Bofill Mir & \u00c1lvarez Hinzpeter Jana Mr. Jorge Bofill, Bofill Mir & \u00c1lvarez Hinzpeter Jana\n\nMs. Johanna Klein Kranenberg, Bofill Mir & \u00c1lvarez Hinzpeter Jana\n\nMs. Dyal\u00e1 Jim\u00e9nez F., Bofill Mir & \u00c1lvarez Hinzpeter Jana\n\nMr. Sebasti\u00e1n Yanine, Bofill Mir & \u00c1lvarez Hinzpeter Jana\n\n*Representing Respondent*\n\nMs. Mar\u00eda Cecilia Rocabado Tubert, Minister of Legal Defense of the State\n\nMr. Javier Antonio Viscarra, Vice-Minister of Legal Defense of the State Mr. Alfredo Mamani, Director for Jurisdictional and Arbitral Defense\n\nMr. Paul Reichler, Foley Hoag LLP Mr. Ronald E.M. Goodman, Foley Hoag LLP Mr. Alberto Wray, Foley Hoag LLP Mr. Diego Cadena, Foley Hoag LLP\n\n19.\n\nAt the telephone conference, the Tribunal heard the Parties' oral arguments. A transcript was made and distributed to the Parties.\n\n20.\n\nBy letter of 5 January 2010, Foley Hoag LLP informed the Tribunal that it no longer represented Respondent.\n\n21.\n\nOn 15 January 2010, Respondent requested a 30-day extension to submit its Objections to jurisdiction or its Counter-memorial on the merits, which the Tribunal granted. Respondent requested another 60-day extension to submit either of these pleadings on 12 February 2010. This time the Tribunal granted an extension only until 24 March 2010. At the date of issuance of this Decision, the procedural calendar described in paragraph 12 above had been extended approximately 2 months.\n\n**B. Facts Underlying the Request for Provisional Measures**\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n22.\n\nThe facts described below are based on the Parties' submissions but reflect the Tribunal's review of the record. As a result, they are presented in the manner that the Tribunal considers most intelligible. The findings of fact are made on the basis of the record as it presently stands; nothing herein shall preempt any later finding of fact or conclusion of law.\n\n**1. NMM's corporate audit**\n----------------------------\n\n23.\n\nOn 18 January 2005, six months after Claimants\u2019 request for friendly consultations and one month following the issuance of the 2004 Memo, the *Superintendencia de Empresas* ordered a corporate audit of NMM. The audit was carried out by employees of the *Superintendencia*, Ms. Lorena Fern\u00e1ndez and Mr. Yury Espinoza. According to the testimony of Lorena Fern\u00e1ndez, this audit was directed to establish whether NMM\u2019s shareholders were Chilean nationals.7 The audit appears to have been ordered at the request of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.8\n\n*See* Minutes of Informative Declaration before the Prosecutor as Means of Defense of Ms. Mar\u00eda M\u00f3nica Lorena Fern\u00e1ndez Salinas, Case No. 9394/08, 14 January 2009 (\"Declaration of Lorena Fern\u00e1ndez\", Annex CPM-37).\n\n*See* Declaration of Lorena Fern\u00e1ndez (Annex CPM-37) and correspondence between the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the *Superintendencia de Empresas* regarding NMM\u2019s corporate inspection (Annex CPM-48).\n\n24.\n\nDuring the course of the audit, Ms. Fern\u00e1ndez and Mr. Espinoza reviewed copies of the shareholders\u2019 registry and other corporate documents, including copies of minutes of board and shareholders' meetings. The company had stated that the original corporate documents were not available because they were in Chile, and the *Superintendencia* allowed the company to provide copies. The report that ensued from the audit (\"Informe 001/2005\" of 11 February 2005) noted that, according to NMM\u2019s shareholders' registry, NMM\u2019s shareholders were Quiborax, with 13,636 shares, David Moscoso, with 13,103 shares, and Allan Fosk, with one share.9 With respect to investment by Chilean nationals, the report concluded that the Chilean company Quiborax had acquired 26,680 shares in NMM from Compa\u00f1\u00eda Minera R\u00edo Grande Sur S.A. (\"RIGSSA\") on 17 August 2001 (part of which were later transferred to David Moscoso), and thus this investment was protected by the BIT.10 The report also concluded that the corporate documentation showed signs of improper handling and care.11 Finally, the report contained certain recommendations with respect to Bolivia\u2019s defense strategy in the ICSID arbitration triggered by the revocation of NMM\u2019s mining concessions (that is, the present arbitration). These recommendations included: (i) analyzing the potential unconstitutionality of Law 1854, which would render the granting of the mining concessions null and void; (ii) establishing whether Quiborax had paid for the acquisition of its shares in NMM from RIGSSA, and thus made an effective investment in Bolivia, and (iii) taking the necessary steps to declare the annulment of the public deed whereby RIGSSA - original owner of the Bolivian Concessions - had contributed those Concessions to NMM, thus rendering Quiborax\u2019s purchase of RIGSSA\u2019s shares in NMM invalid as well.12\n\nInforme 001/2005 (Annex CPM-14), p. 3.\n\n*Id*., p. 6.\n\n*Id*., p. 6.\n\n*Id*., pp. 6-7.\n\n25.\n\nInforme 001/2005 does not appear to have been questioned by the *Superintendencia de Empresas* at the time of its issuance. Nonetheless, on 10 October 2008, the Minister of the State\u2019s Legal Defense requested the *Superintendente* to once again review the file on NMM and certify if there were any irregularities that could give rise to the annulment of NMM\u2019s corporate acts or the annulment of the company\u2019s incorporation.13\n\n*See* Letter from H\u00e9ctor E. Arce, Ministry of State\u2019s Legal Defense to Rolando Morales, *Superintendencia de Empresas*, 10 October 2008 (Annex CPM-49).\n\n26.\n\nOn 17 October 2008, the *Superintendente de Empresas* confirmed the findings of Informe 001/2005 and denied the existence of any irregularities that could give rise to the annulment of the company\u2019s acts, certifying, among other things, the shareholder composition of NMM, consisting of Quiborax, David Moscoso and Allan Fosk.14\n\n*See* Letter from Rolando Morales, *Superintendencia de Empresas*, to H\u00e9ctor E. Arce, Ministry of State\u2019s Legal Defense *,* and the attached certification dated 17 October 2008. (Annex CPM-49).\n\n**2. The criminal proceedings**\n-------------------------------\n\n27.\n\nDespite the certification issued by the *Superintendencia de Empresas* on 17 October 2008, Bolivian authorities continued to review Claimants\u2019 corporate documentation registered in Bolivia\u2019s Commercial Register, and noted the existence of certain irregularities in NMM\u2019s corporate documentation.15\n\nRespondent\u2019s Objection, \u00b6\u00b6 21-29.\n\n28.\n\nSpecifically, the Bolivian government discovered the existence of the minutes of a shareholders' meeting of NMM dated 11 September 2001,16 which had not been provided during the audit, and which contained a different list of shareholders from that included in the minutes of a meeting allegedly held 2 days later, on 13 September 2001.17 Both minutes had almost identical content, but while the minutes of 11 September 2001 stated that the shareholders of NMM were Fernando Rojas, Gilka Salas, Dolly Paredes and RIGSSA, the minutes of 13 September 2001 stated that the shareholders of NMM were Allan Fosk, Empresa Qu\u00edmica Industrial del B\u00f3rax S.A. (currently Quiborax) and David Moscoso Ruiz.\n\nMinutes of NMM\u2019s Shareholders Meeting dated 11 September 2001 (Annex 8 to Respondent\u2019s Objection).\n\nMinutes of NMM\u2019s Shareholders Meeting dated 13 September 2001 (Annex 7 to Respondent\u2019s Objection).\n\n29.\n\nAccording to Bolivia, the existence of these two contradictory documents, seen jointly with other corporate documents of NMM, suggests that the minutes of 13 September 2001 may have been forged.18 Based on this suspicion, on 8 December 2008, the *Superintendente de Empresas* presented a criminal complaint against the following persons:19\n\n(i) Co-Claimant Allan Fosk;\n\n(ii) David Moscoso, Claimants\u2019 Bolivian business partner;\n\n(iii) Fernando Rojas and Mar\u00eda del Carmen Ballivi\u00e1n, former legal counsel of Claimants;\n\n(iv) Daniel Gottschalk, attorney at Guevara & Guti\u00e9rrez, current legal counsel of Claimants;\n\n(v) Dolly Teresa Paredes de Linares and Gilka Salas Orozco, employees of Estudio Rojas;\n\n(vi) Mar\u00eda M\u00f3nica Lorena Fern\u00e1ndez Salinas and Yury Alegorio Espinoza Zalles, the two (now former) employees of the *Superintendencia de Empresas* who authored Informe 001/2005; and\n\n(vii) Tatiana Giovanna Ter\u00e1n de Velasco and Ernesto Ossio Aramayo, two Notaries Public whose services NMM had used.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Objection, \u00b6 29.\n\n*See* for all accusations, Criminal Complaint of 8 December 2008, Case N\u00b0 9394/08 (\"Querella Criminal\", Annex CPM-09). Mar\u00eda del Carmen Ballivi\u00e1n was added to the list of persons under investigation on 14 April 2009. *See* Correction of Extension of Criminal Complaint, 14 April 2009 (\"Querella Modification,\" Annex CPM-10).\n\n30.\n\nThe accusation underlying the criminal prosecutions (which have been identified as Case N\u00b0 9394/08) is that some of the persons listed above forged the minutes of 13 September 2001 (replacing what Bolivia deems to be the real minutes, those of 11 September 2001), while others improperly used such forged document. Specifically, Bolivia accuses the persons listed above of the following crimes:20\n\n(i) Allan Fosk, David Moscoso, Fernando Rojas, and Dolly Paredes are accused of four different crimes: (i) *falsedad ideol\u00f3gica* (forgery) in accordance with Art. 199 of the Bolivian Penal Code (\"BPC\"); (ii) *uso de instrumento falsificado* (use of forged document); Art. 203 BPC; (iii) *estafa* (fraud), Art. 335 BPC; and (iv) *destrucci\u00f3n de cosas propias para defraudar* (destruction of personal property to defraud), Art 339 BPC;\n\n(ii) Mar\u00eda del Carmen Ballivi\u00e1n is accused of *falsedad ideol\u00f3gica* and *uso de instrumento falsificado;*\n\n(iii) Daniel Gottschalk was accused of *uso de instrumento falsificado* only;\n\n(iv) Isaac Frenkel of *destrucci\u00f3n de cosas propias para defraudar* ;\n\n(v) Lorena Fern\u00e1ndez, Yury Espinoza, Ernesto Ossio, and Tatiana Ter\u00e1n are all accused of *incumplimiento de deberes* (dereliction of duties), Art. 154 BPC;\n\n(vi) Gilka Salas is mentioned among the persons accused but has not been accused of any crime in particular.\n\n*See* Querella Criminal (Annex CPM-9) and Querella Modification (Annex CPM-10).\n\n31.\n\nBolivia\u2019s reasons to suspect this forgery are, among others:21\n\n(i) The minutes of 11 September 2001 were inserted into a public deed and used several times in the following years to grant powers of attorney for the company, which suggests that the minutes of 11 September 2001 are the real minutes, while the minutes of 13 September 2001 were created *ex post facto*.22\n\n(ii) The minutes of 11 September 2001 indicate that one of the shareholders was RIGSSA, which according to the Shareholders\u2019 Registry had transferred its shares to Quiborax on 17 August 2001. Bolivia also claims that this transfer was in breach of NMM\u2019s corporate bylaws, as they provided for a right of first refusal to the remaining shareholders that Bolivia claims was not respected.23\n\n(iii) According to Bolivia, Dolly Paredes\u2019s signature in the minutes of 13 September 2001 does not match her signature in other documents.24\n\n(iv) Bolivia also asserts that co-Claimant Allan Fosk was not in Bolivia on 13 September 2001.25\n\nRespondent\u2019s Objection, \u00b6\u00b6 22-29. *See* Public Instrument No. 523/2001, September 20, 2001 (Exhibit 9 to Respondent\u2019s Objection) Public Instrument 291/2002, July 1, 2002 (Exhibit 10 to Respondent\u2019s Objection); NMM\u2019s Shareholders Registry dated January 27, 2009 (Exhibit 11 to Respondent\u2019s Objection); NMM\u2019s Bylaws (Exhibit 12 to Respondent\u2019s Objection).\n\n*See, e.g.,* Annexes 9 and 10 of Respondent\u2019s Objection.\n\nThere is contradictory evidence on this point - Claimants attach the minutes of a shareholders meeting held 17 August 2001 that authorizes the transfer in the presence of all shareholders. *See* Minutes of NMM\u2019s shareholders meeting dated 17 August 2001 (Annex CPM-40).\n\n*See* Querella Criminal (Annex CPM-9), p. 6.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Rejoinder, \u00b6 5.\n\n32.\n\nBolivia finds support for this allegation of forgery in other inconsistencies found in NMM\u2019s corporate documentation that shed doubts on the validity of Quiborax\u2019s acquisition of shares, namely:\n\n(i) Quiborax allegedly acquired its shares from RIGSSA on 17 August 2001.26 This acquisition was reflected in the minutes of NMM\u2019s shareholders' meeting of 17 August 2001.27 However, the minutes of such meeting were formalized in the presence of a notary only on 26 November 2004, more than three years after the meeting was supposedly held.28\n\n(ii) In addition, RIGSSA had only recently acquired the shares it allegedly transferred, and Bolivia contends that such acquisition was not legally complete when RIGSSA transferred those shares to Quiborax. Bolivia\u2019s argument in this respect can be summarized as follows, although it must be noted that Bolivia\u2019s statement of the facts contains certain errors, in particular with respect to dates:\n\n(a) NMM\u2019s shareholders approved RIGSSA\u2019s entry as a new shareholder and NMM\u2019s capital increase by means of RIGSSA\u2019s contribution in kind of seven mining concessions on 3 August 2001.29 This capital increase was formalized by public deed dated 10 August 2001.30 Bolivia alleges that NMM requested the Commercial Registry to record this capital increase on 21 August 2001, when allegedly RIGSSA was no longer a shareholder in NMM.31\n\n(b) Bolivia also alleges that, pursuant to Bolivian law, NMM\u2019s capital increase had to be authorized by the Commercial Registry. This authorization, which according to Bolivia was a prerequisite for the issuance of NMM\u2019s shares, was only granted on 28 August 2001.32 In other words, the alleged transfer of shares from RIGSSA to Quiborax on 17 August 2001 could not have happened because the shares could not have been issued prior to 28 August 2001.\n\n(iii) Bolivia also alleges that, under Bolivian Law, the title that contains transfers of mining concessions must be recorded in the Real Property Register in order to become effective, which Bolivia claims was not done.\n\n(iv) Bolivia claims that NMM\u2019s Financial Statements filed with the National Revenue Service of Bolivia continued to reflect RIGSSA\u2019s shareholder stake in NMM, with an interest of 99.75% of the stock package.33 Similarly, RIGSSA\u2019s Financial Statements at 30 September 2003 show that its shareholder stake in NMM at that date amounted to Bs 2,793,000.34\n\n*See* NMM\"s Shareholders\u2019 Registry (Exhibit 11 to Respondent\u2019s Objection).\n\n*See* Minutes of NMM\u2019s shareholders meeting dated 17 August 2001 (Annex CPM-40).\n\n*See* Exhibit 14 to Respondent\u2019s Objection and Exhibit 2 to Respondent\u2019s Rejoinder.\n\nBolivia states that RIGSSA contributed its mining concessions on 17 August 2001, but the record shows that such contribution was approved on 3 August 2001. (Respondent\u2019s Objection to the RPM, \u00b6 25).\n\nBolivia alleges that the public deed is dated 16 August 2001 and thus was issued only one day prior to RIGSSA\u2019s transfer to Quiborax (*See* Respondent\u2019s Observations to the RPM \u00b6 25). However, the public deed attached as Annex 16 to Respondent\u2019s Objection is dated 10 August 2001.\n\n*See* Respondent\u2019s Objection, \u00b6 25. Respondent cites to Annex 16 of its Objection, but this document does not support this allegation.\n\n*See* Exhibit 18 to Respondent\u2019s Objection.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Objection, \u00b6 24. Respondent does not attach NMM\u2019s Financial Statements nor indicates their date.\n\n*See* Exhibit 15 to Respondent\u2019s Objection. Bolivia mistakenly states that the shareholder stake was Bs 2,770,000 (Respondent\u2019s Objection, \u00b6 24).\n\n33.\n\nClaimants maintain that what Bolivia claims is forgery is merely the result of a clerical error. Claimants argue that the minutes of 11 September 2001 were incorrectly prepared by one of NMM\u2019s lawyers using old models that listed previous shareholders, and when the error was discovered, a new shareholders' meeting was held on 13 September with the correct shareholders. Claimants also insist that the minutes of 11 September were used by mistake to grant powers of attorney for the company.35\n\nClaimants\u2019 Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 60-63.\n\n34.\n\nIn this regard, Claimants maintain that in 2004, Claimants\u2019 legal counsel at the time of their investment, Mar\u00eda del Carmen Ballivi\u00e1n of Estudio Rojas, informed Claimants of an error she had detected in the issuance of powers of attorney upon revision of NMM\u2019s corporate administration. According to Ms. Ballivi\u00e1n, the powers of attorney incorporated the 11 September 2001 draft minutes of a shareholders' meeting instead of the definitive 13 September 2001 minutes which are part of the company\u2019s book of shareholders' meetings.36\n\nClaimants\u2019 Reply, \u00b6 61.

(Annex CPM-36).\n\n35.\n\nClaimants allege that, based on this information, on 21 January 2005 the Board of Directors of NMM acknowledged the mistake and ratified all acts performed by virtue of the powers of attorney that incorporated the 11 September 2001 draft minutes to avoid any challenge of these acts.37 Later that same day, the Board of Directors revoked the powers of attorneys and issued new ones.38\n\nClaimants\u2019 Reply, \u00b6 62. *See also* Minutes of NMM\u2019s Board Meeting dated 21 January 2005.

Fernando Rojas, former legal counsel and one of the accused persons within the criminal proceedings, was also interrogated (*See* Annex CPM-35).\n\n37.\n\nOn 16 March 2009, formal charges were presented against David Moscoso, Fernando Rojas, Dolly Paredes, Lorena Fern\u00e1ndez, and Yury Espinoza.41\n\n*See* Formal Indictment, 16 March 2009 (Annex CPM-11).\n\n38.\n\nThe proceedings regarding David Moscoso, Claimants\u2019 Bolivian business partner, moved swiftly. At a hearing on preventive measures held on 4 June 2009 before Judge Margot P\u00e9rez, Moscoso was ordered to report to the court on a weekly basis, not to leave the country and to present two witnesses as sureties. The *Superintendencia* was not satisfied with this decision and appealed. As a result of this appeal, a bail of US$300,000 was set on David Moscoco\u2019s personal liberty, to be deposited within seventy-two hours.42\n\n*See* Resolution No. 179/2009 of the Third Criminal Chamber, 8 August 2009 (Annex CPM-57).\n\n39.\n\nOn 7 August 2009, on notice that bail would be set, David Moscoso wrote to Allan Fosk informing him that, as of the date of the notice he would have 72 hours to pay such bail or risked going to prison. Mr. Moscoso asked Allan Fosk for the bail money in compliance with the \"gentlemen\u2019s agreements\" reached with him and Fosk\u2019s father that they would cover all expenses related to the arbitration, and announced that if the money was not forthcoming, he would have to look for ways to preserve his freedom. Mr. Moscoso stated that \"[o]ne way could be to ask for summary judgment in my condition as director of the company and be punished with a sanction that would allow me not going to prison...\", and added that, if Allan Fosk did not provide him with the bail money, he would immediately start negotiations for the summary judgment.43\n\n*See* E-mail from David Moscoso to Allan Fosk, 7 August 2009 (Annex CPM-58). (Original in Spanish).\n\n40.\n\nOn 11 August 2009, the *Fiscal* (Prosecutor) presented a request for a summary judgment against David Moscoso sentencing him to two years of imprisonment, stating that this was done at David Moscoso\u2019s request.44\n\n*See* Resolution No. 01/2009, 11 August 2009, Request for Abbreviated Proceeding (Annex CPM-19).\n\n41.\n\nThe hearing on David Moscoso\u2019s summary proceeding took place on 14 August 2009. The decision rendered as a result of that hearing indicated that Mr. Moscoso had confessed his participation in the forgery of the minutes NMM\u2019s shareholders' meeting of 13 September 2001.45 The decision noted that such forgery had caused a harm to the Bolivian State by allowing Quiborax to initiate an arbitration against Boliva and that the existence of harm was a an essential requirement for the crimes alleged, but that Mr. Moscoso had not known of the harm that his actions could cause.46 As a result of Mr. Moscoso\u2019s confession, he was sentenced to two years of imprisonment, receiving immediate judicial pardon based on his previous clean record.47 Following his judicial pardon, Mr. Moscoso expressly waived his right to appeal.48\n\nThe decision does not cite explicitly to the confession, but rather states that \"regarding the existence of the act and the participation of the accused in the same, the Prosecutor has proved clearly with all the literal proof that he has presented to this judicial chamber that the accused has participated in the fabrication [ *facci\u00f3n* ] of these minutes that are accused as false...\" and that \"the accused... has acknowledged his guilt on the illegal acts that the prosecutor accuses him of.\" *See* Resolution No. 313/2009 dated 14 August 2009, pp. 3-4.

On 2 October 2009, Claimants filed a request for a \"temporary restraining order\" to prevent the continuation of criminal proceedings related to this arbitration.57 The Tribunal rejected this request, holding that the request did not meet the urgency requirement, and that at that stage it lacked sufficient information to assess whether the requirement of necessity was met or to determine whether any of Claimant\u2019s rights required preservation.58\n\n*See* Annex CRO-1.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Request for a Temporary Restraining Order, 2 October 2009.\n\n*See* ICSID letter dated 5 October 2009.\n\n45.\n\nThe hearing on preventive measures that was supposed to take place on 6 October 2009 did not take place. Dolly Paredes submitted a challenge against Judge Margot P\u00e9rez for alleged lack of impartiality as a consequence of the criminal proceedings initiated against her by the Minister of the State\u2019s Legal Defense.59 Judge P\u00e9rez accepted the challenge, declaring that her acts \"are being controlled within the proceedings for *prevaricato*, since any decision of this judge may result in further criminal charges as they have done before...\"60\n\n*See* Challenge filed by Dolly T. Paredes, 5 October 2009 (Annex CPM-54).\n\n*See* Resolution No. 389/2009, Decision on challenge, 7 October 2009 (Annex CPM-55). (Original in Spanish).\n\n**III. POSITIONS OF THE PARTIES**\n---------------------------------\n\n**A. Claimants' Position**\n--------------------------\n\n46.\n\nClaimants contend that the criminal proceedings are motivated by and aimed at the present arbitration, that they have no self-standing merit, and are instrumental to Bolivia\u2019s defense strategy to avoid arbitration on the merits. Specifically, Claimants allege that \"[t]he criminal proceedings are merely instrumental to Bolivia\u2019s goals in the arbitration, which are to (i) deny the condition of Claimants as foreign investors under the BIT; (ii) obtain, manipulate and fabricate evidence that supports Bolivia\u2019s defense strategy, and (iii) ultimately, force Claimants to give up their claims in the arbitration.\"61\n\nClaimants\u2019 RPM, \u00b6 18.\n\n47.\n\nClaimants also argue that this is a unique case, because Bolivia is prosecuting Claimants and persons related to them for a crime that consists in presenting a claim in an international arbitration.62 Claimants support this allegation by asserting that Bolivia has claimed within the criminal proceedings that the harm which is a constituent element of the crimes attributed to the accused persons consists of Bolivia\u2019s exposure to this international arbitration.63\n\nTranscript, p. 30, lines 15-20.\n\nTranscript, p. 17, lines 2-6; p. 76, lines 18-22; p. 77, lines 1-12.\n\n48.\n\nFinally, Claimants submit that, just as investors must pass certain tests in order to fall under the protection of the ICSID Convention, States too must abide by certain basic notions of behavior and act in accordance with ICSID rules and guiding principles. Claimants argue that \"States cannot be allowed to avail themselves of their intrinsically superior powers under their own domestic legal systems in order to obstruct [an] investor\u2019s legitimate access to ICSID arbitration\", and that coercing Claimants and persons related to their investment in Bolivia by criminal prosecution is an unacceptable means of boycotting the ICSID system that must not be permitted.64\n\nClaimants\u2019 RPM, \u00b6 64.\n\n**1. Rights that require preservation**\n---------------------------------------\n\n49.\n\nClaimants submit that, in accordance with Art. 47 of the ICSID Convention, provisional measures can only be requested to preserve the rights of either party. Claimants allege that the criminal proceedings initiated by Bolivia impair the following rights that need preservation: (1) the right to preservation of the *status quo* and non-aggravation of the dispute; (2) the right to the procedural integrity of the arbitration proceedings; and (3) the right to exclusivity of the ICSID proceedings in accordance with Art. 26 of the ICSID Convention.65\n\nClaimants\u2019 RPM, \u00b6 34.\n\n50.\n\nClaimants reject Bolivia\u2019s argument that the Tribunal may only order provisional measures if Bolivia\u2019s actions impair the rights \"in dispute\". Claimants argue that identity between the object of the coercive measures and the rights in dispute is not required, and that in any event Bolivia\u2019s actions do affect the rights \"in dispute\", because Claimants are not only requesting compensation for the unlawful expropriation but also moral damages for the acts of harassment perpetrated by Bolivia against Claimants, in particular by way of criminal proceedings.66\n\nClaimants\u2019 Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 78-79.\n\n***a. Right to the preservation of the status quo and non-aggravation of the dispute***\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n51.\n\nClaimants submit that the right to preservation of the *status quo* and the nonaggravation of the dispute is a self-standing right under international law.67 Claimants rely on *Burlington v.

Indonesia*\"), Decision on Request for Provisional Measures of 9 December 1983, p. 412.\n\n52.\n\nClaimants allege that the criminal proceedings have aggravated, and continue to aggravate, the dispute between the Parties. Claimants assert that Bolivia is doing everything in its power to obstruct the ICSID proceedings, and is using the criminal proceedings and other forms of harassment to ultimately force the Claimants to give up their claims.\n\n53.\n\nClaimants note as an example that the court issued an order of restraint prohibiting David Moscoso from contacting the other accused, including his former legal counsel Fernando Rojas. Claimants allege that \"the direct pressure placed on David Moscoso by the government of Bolivia has made him turn against his own business partners, as well as virtually eradicated him as a source of information and a buttress for the cause of Claimants in the arbitration.\"71\n\nClaimants\u2019 RPM, \u00b6 38.\n\n54.\n\nClaimants allege that Bolivia\u2019s course of action has changed the *status quo* of the dispute, as Claimants have become defendants in Bolivia, and has created serious obstacles for Claimants\u2019 presentation of their claim. Claimants contend that at the time they submitted their Request for Arbitration, the Parties were equal in arms as to their possibility to present their case, but since December 2008 Claimants\u2019 position has been weakened as the persons involved in the criminal proceedings have been forced out from the ICSID proceedings as potential witnesses or sources of information.72\n\nClaimants\u2019 RPM \u00b6 39, Claimants\u2019 Reply on PM, \u00b6 88-90.\n\n55.\n\nClaimants argue that the criminal proceedings are aimed at avoiding discussion on the merits of the dispute and put intolerable pressure on Claimants to drop their claim. As support for this allegation, they cite declarations in the Bolivian press by Bolivian authorities, including Oscar C\u00e1mara, former Vice-Minister of the State\u2019s Legal Defense and Executive Director of the *Autoridad de Fiscalizaci\u00f3n y Control Social de Empresas* (the agency that has since replaced the *Superintendencia de Empresas*), claiming the existence of an agreement between the Parties without any payment of compensation by Bolivia to Claimants, allegedly due to Claimants acceptance of the criminal accusations against them.73\n\nClaimants\u2019 Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 91, 33. *See* Press Article, \"Quiborax withdrew arbitration because the Government found alleged fraud\" [\"*Quiborax levant\u00f3 arbitraje porque el Gobierno hall\u00f3 presunto fraude*\"], La Raz\u00f3n - Bolivia, 10 September 2009 (Annex CPM-65).\n\n***b. Right to the procedural integrity of the arbitration proceedings***\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n56.\n\nClaimants assert that the criminal proceedings impair their right to the procedural integrity of the arbitration proceedings, in particular with respect to their access to evidence and the integrity of the evidence produced.\n\n57.\n\nIn particular, Claimants allege that Bolivia is impairing Claimants\u2019 access to evidence by sequestering corporate documents and intimidating potential witnesses (including Claimants\u2019 former and current legal counsel) who now fear to testify.74 Claimants note that the persons involved in the criminal proceedings have been defined by Bolivia as \"indispensable witnesses to reach the historic truth of the facts\"75 but that, fearing for their situation in Bolivia, they are not prepared to participate in this arbitration.76 As a result, Claimants claim they have been left without indispensable witnesses for their case.77\n\nClaimants\u2019 RPM,\u00b6\u00b6 40, 42; Claimants\u2019 Reply on PM, \u00b6\u00b6 98-102.\n\nFormal Indictment, p. 10 (Annex CPM-11). (Original in Spanish).\n\nClaimants\u2019 Reply, \u00b6 99.\n\n*Id*.\n\n58.\n\nClaimants specifically point to the fact that David Moscoso is now legally impeded to act as a witness for Claimants, as he has made a confession within the criminal proceedings and any testimony to the contrary in the ICSID proceedings would allow Bolivia to prosecute him for false testimony or false self-incrimination (*autocalumnia*).78\n\nClaimants\u2019 Reply, \u00b6 97.\n\n59.\n\nClaimants allege that by forcing confessions such as that of David Moscoso, Bolivia is manipulating and fabricating *ex post facto* evidence to be used in the ICSID proceedings (in particular with respect to the Claimants\u2019 standing as investors under the BIT).79 Claimants contend that \"[i]f the criminal proceedings are allowed to continue, there is every reason to fear that other potential witnesses will find themselves forced to make false statements to save themselves from imprisonment or otherwise face Bolivia\u2019s persecution.\"80\n\nClaimants\u2019 RPM, \u00b6 41; Claimants\u2019 Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 101-102.\n\nClaimants\u2019 RPM, \u00b6 42.\n\n60.\n\nClaimants also claim that, by questioning Informe 001/2005 and harassing its authors, Bolivia has destroyed information that supports Claimants\u2019 status under the BIT. Claimants maintain that \"[t]he intricate maneuvers deployed by Bolivia to diminish the value of the report are only within the means of a sovereign State with investigative and coercive powers and not permissible in international arbitration.\"81\n\n*Id*.\n\n61.\n\nClaimants reject Bolivia\u2019s contention that no harm is done because the Tribunal is free to weigh the evidence as it deems appropriate, arguing that this faculty will be contaminated by Bolivia because the persons involved in the criminal proceedings will no longer be able to render candid testimony.82\n\nClaimants\u2019 Reply, \u00b6 95.\n\n***c. The right to the exclusivity of the ICSID proceedings under Art. 26 of the ICSID Convention***\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n62.\n\nClaimants contend that the criminal proceedings are aimed at destroying Claimants\u2019 status as foreign investors under the Bolivia-Chile BIT and are thus parallel proceedings on jurisdiction prohibited by the exclusivity of ICSID jurisdiction under Art. 26 of the ICSID Convention, which provides in relevant part:\n\nConsent of the parties to arbitration under this Convention shall, unless otherwise stated, be deemed consent to such arbitration to the exclusion of any other remedy.\n\n63.\n\nClaimants submit that \"Bolivia is raising and discussing in an alternate forum issues that are aimed at attacking the jurisdiction of the Centre\", and that it \"has construed the mere existence of being subject to the present arbitration as the object of its domestic criminal prosecution.\"83 Claimants argue that, as a consequence, the criminal proceedings initiated by Bolivia constitute what Art. 26 of the ICSID Convention calls \"other remedy\".84 Claimants rely on *City Oriente v. Ecuador*, where the Tribunal ordered the Ecuadorian General Prosecutor to refrain from pursuing the criminal investigation of three of City Oriente\u2019s executives on charges closely related to the subject of the arbitration.85\n\nClaimants\u2019 RPM, \u00b6 50.\n\nClaimants\u2019 RPM, \u00b6 51.\n\n*City Oriente Ltd. v.

Ukraine*, Claimants submit that parallel proceedings are prohibited under Art. 26 of the ICSID Convention, if they \"relate to the subject matter of the case before the tribunal and not to separate, unrelated issues or extraneous matters.\"86 Relying on *CSOB v. Slovak Republic*, Claimants also argue that it is not necessary for the criminal proceedings to deal with the same subject matter as the ICSID proceeding to constitute such \"other remedy\", and that it is sufficient that the proceedings refer to matters under consideration by the Tribunal.87\n\n*Tokios Tokel\u00e9s v.

Requirements for provisional measures**\n--------------------------------------------\n\n65.\n\nClaimants state that provisional measures must be urgent and necessary for the rights invoked to be protected, and that both requirements are fulfilled in the present case.88\n\nClaimants\u2019 RPM, \u00b6 35.\n\n***a. Urgency***\n----------------\n\n66.\n\nCiting *Burlington v. Ecuador* and Prof. Schreuer, Claimants submit that \"the criterion of urgency is satisfied when [\u2026] \"a question cannot await the outcome of the award on the merits\u2019\".89\n\n*Burlington v.

Schreuer. *The ICSID Convention: A Commentary* (2001), p. 751, \u00b6 14.\n\n67.\n\nAccording to Claimants, what is essential is that the harm is likely to be produced before the date of the award.90 For that reason, the urgency requirement must be assessed in the context of the case, as stated by the tribunal in *Biwater Gauff v. Tanzania* :\n\nIn the Arbitral Tribunal\u2019s view, the degree of \"urgency\" which is required depends on the circumstances, including the requested provisional measures, and may be satisfied where a party can prove that there is a need to obtain the requested measure at a certain point in the procedure before the issuance of an award. [\u2026] The Arbitral Tribunal also considers that the level of urgency required depends on the type of measure which is requested.91\n\nClaimants\u2019 Reply, \u00b6 115.\n\n*Biwater Gauff (Tanzania) Ltd. v. United Republic of Tanzania*, ICSID Case No. ARB/05/22 (\"*Biwater Gauff v, Tanzania*\"), Procedural Order No. 1 of 31 March 2006, \u00b6 76.\n\n68.\n\nClaimants argue that the requirement of urgency is met in this case.92 Specifically, Claimants contend that because the provisional measures are intended to protect against the aggravation of the dispute and to safeguard the jurisdictional powers of the Tribunal and the integrity of the arbitration, they are urgent by definition.93\n\nClaimants RPM \u00b6\u00b6 52-55.\n\nClaimants rely on *Burlington v.

Ecuador,* Decision on Provisional Measures of 19 November 2007, \u00b6 69.\n\n69.\n\nClaimants argue that the urgency of the provisional measures is evidenced by the conviction of David Moscoso,94 and that it has become evident that the passage of time in the present case only makes the threat of irreparable harm to Claimants\u2019 rights more imminent.95\n\nClaimants\u2019 RPM, \u00b6 54.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Reply, \u00b6 119.\n\n***b. Necessity***\n------------------\n\n70.\n\nClaimants submit that \"[t]he necessity requirement requires the Tribunal to consider the proportionality of the requested provisional measures to the harm Claimants have already suffered and will continue to suffer in consequence of the actions of Bolivia.\"96\n\nClaimants\u2019 RPM, \u00b6 53.\n\n71.\n\nAccording to Claimants, the appropriate standard to assess the necessity of Claimants\u2019 request for provisional measures is that established in Art. 17A of the UNCITRAL Model Law, which requires the party requesting an interim measure to satisfy the tribunal that:\n\nHarm not adequately repaired by an award of damages is likely to result if the measure is not ordered, and such harm substantially outweighs the harm that is likely to result to the party against whom the measure is directed if the measure is granted.\n\n72.\n\nFollowing this standard, Claimants argue that the provisional measures requested are necessary because the harm caused would not be adequately repaired by an award on damages. Specifically, Claimants allege that \"[t]he harm to Claimants caused by the criminal proceedings, consisting of restrictions on the personal liberty of co-Claimant Allan Fosk and the other persons accused, as well as the corruption of evidence relevant to the present arbitration, is not the kind of harm that can be adequately repaired by an award of damages\", and that \"[i]t can only be avoided by immediate termination of the criminal proceedings in Bolivia.\"97 In contrast, Claimants assert that Bolivia suffers no harm if the criminal proceedings are stayed.98\n\nClaimants\u2019 RPM, \u00b6 62.\n\nClaimants\u2019 RPM, \u00b6 63.\n\n**B. Respondent's Position**\n----------------------------\n\n73.\n\nRespondent notes at the outset that provisional measures are exceptional in nature and should not be granted lightly. Respondent cites *Occidental Petroleum Corporation v. Ecuador*, where the Tribunal held:\n\nIt is not contested that provisional measures are extraordinary measures that cannot be recommended lightly. In other words, the circumstances under which provisional measures are required under Article 47 of the ICSID Convention are those in which the measures are necessary to preserve a party\u2019s rights and where the need is urgent in order to avoid irreparable harm. The jurisprudence of the International Court of Justice dealing with provisional measures is well-established: a provisional measure is necessary where the actions of a party \"are capable of causing or of threatening irreparable prejudice to the rights invoked\u2019 [\u2026]99\n\n*Occidental Petroleum Corporation and Occidental Exploration and Production Company v. Republic of Ecuador*, ICSID Case No. ARB/06/11 (\"*Occidental v. Ecuador\")*, Decision on Provisional Measures of 17 August 2007, \u00b6 59.\n\n74.\n\nIn Respondent\u2019s view, Claimants\u2019 request for provisional measures must fail because it meets none of these requirements.\n\n**1. Rights for which protection is sought**\n--------------------------------------------\n\n75.\n\nAs a preliminary matter, Respondent contends that provisional measures may not be granted in this case because the criminal proceedings do not affect any of Claimants\u2019 rights in the dispute.100 Specifically, Respondent claims that \"[a] criminal proceeding initiated with full factual and legal justification, exclusively to establish the existence of crimes that affect legal rights protected by Bolivian Law, does not constitute a threat to the arbitral proceeding, its development and its results.\"101\n\nRespondent\u2019s Objection, \u00b6\u00b6 5-7.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Objection, \u00b6 6.\n\n76.\n\nRespondent also asserts that Claimants have not established \"the existence of even a single objective element from which it could be determined that the rights that are significant to this dispute, including the procedural rights that they invoke, may have been affected or could be affected in an imminent and irreparable manner by the legitimate exercise of the powers that Bolivia can engage in as a sovereign state in order to demand compliance with its legislation and to apply current criminal laws in observation of the principle of due process.\"102\n\n*Id*.\n\n77.\n\nIn addition, Respondent states that the dispute in this arbitration proceeding would be limited to establishing whether the Claimants have the right to the monetary compensation that they are demanding as a result of the revocation of the mining concessions they claim to have held.103 In contrast, the criminal proceedings deal with the prosecution of crimes, specifically the alteration and falsification of documents, the use of a falsified instrument and dereliction of duty by public officers.104\n\nRespondent\u2019s Objection, \u00b6 7.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Objection, \u00b6 8, 30.\n\n78.\n\nRespondent relies on precedent from the International Court of Justice, in particular the *Case Concerning Certain Criminal Proceedings in France (Republic of Congo v.**France*), according to which the power of the Court to indicate provisional measures to maintain the respective rights of the parties is to be exercised only if there is an urgent need to prevent irreparable prejudice to the rights that are the subject of the dispute before the Court has had an opportunity to render its decision.105\n\n*Case Concerning* *Certain Criminal Proceedings in France (Republic of the Congo v. France),* Order of June 17, 2003 *,* ICJ Reports 2003, \u00b6 22.\n\n79.\n\nRespondent objects to each of Claimants\u2019 specific grounds for requesting provisional measures, as described below.\n\n***a. With respect to the right to the preservation of the*** **status quo** ***and non-aggravation of the dispute***\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n80.\n\nAs noted above, Respondent contends that there is no aggravation of the dispute or need to preserve the *status quo*, because the criminal proceedings do not affect the rights in dispute. Respondent argues that the fact that the criminal proceedings cause inconveniences and suffering to Claimants does not prove that they interfere with the rights in dispute.106\n\nRespondent\u2019s Objection, \u00b6 45.\n\n81.\n\nIn this regard, Respondent submits that there is no self-standing right to the preservation of the *status quo* or the non-aggravation of the dispute. Such right exists only when there is an imminent threat that a right in dispute will suffer irreparable harm.107\n\nRespondent\u2019s Objection, \u00b6\u00b6 11; 46-48.\n\n82.\n\nEven if such self-standing right existed, as held by the tribunal in *Burlington v. Ecuador*, Respondent argues that the sole existence of this right does not necessarily mandate the adoption of provisional measures. Claimants would have to demonstrate that: (a) the initiation of the criminal proceeding alters the *status quo* of the dispute as it was submitted to the Tribunal; (b) the existence of the criminal proceeding produces a threat of irreparable harm that may affect the disputed rights; and (c) if the requested measures are not adopted, harm would be imminent.108\n\nRespondent\u2019s Objection, \u00b6 51.\n\n83.\n\nRespondent argues that Claimants\u2019 reliance on *Burlington v. Ecuador* is misguided because the circumstances of that case were totally different from those of the present arbitration. In *Burlington*, Ecuador\u2019s actions giving rise to the provisional measures related to the same monetary obligations being examined by the arbitral tribunal, there was an ongoing business relationship between the parties that the tribunal deemed worth protecting, and the contract governing that relationship gave rise to an obligation of specific performance that also merited protection. None of those elements is present here.\n\n84.\n\nIn any event, Respondent claims that there is no change to the *status quo*, because claimant Allan Fosk has not been formally accused and his procedural status has not changed since December 2008. Respondent also notes that none of the persons involved in the criminal proceedings has been called as a witness by Claimants, so their procedural status is not relevant to this arbitration.109\n\nRespondent\u2019s Objection, \u00b6\u00b6 54-61.\n\n85.\n\nIn addition, Respondent claims that there has been no aggravation of the dispute because Claimants have not identified any measure by Bolivia that could exercise a prejudicial effect on the execution of the decision or aggravate or extend the dispute.110\n\nRespondent\u2019s Objection, \u00b6\u00b6 64-69.\n\n86.\n\nRelying on *Pulp Mills on the River Uruguay (Argentina v. Uruguay)*,111 Respondent also argues that even when the conduct of one of the parties allegedly aggravates or prolongs the dispute, provisional measures may only be ordered if there is evidence of some irreparable harm to the rights of the other party. As this is not the case here, provisional measures may not be granted.\n\n*Pulp Mills on the River Uruguay, (Argentina* v. *Uruguay),* Order of January 23, 2007, ICJ Reports 2007, \u00b6 50.\n\n***b. With respect to the right to the integrity of the arbitral proceedings***\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n87.\n\nRespondent contends that there is no threat to the integrity of the proceedings, particularly with respect to the production of evidence.\n\n88.\n\nRespondent notes that Claimants have already presented substantial evidence, including corporate documentation, both in their Request for Provisional Measures and in their Memorial on the merits. Thus, provisional measures directed to protect Claimants\u2019 right to present evidence would serve no purpose.112\n\nRespondent\u2019s Objection, \u00b6\u00b6 12, 72.\n\n89.\n\nIf Claimants refer to the evidence that may be presented by Bolivia, Respondent claims that there is no urgency or necessity to support the granting of provisional measures because any evidence that Bolivia presents will be examined, criticized and verified by Claimants and freely evaluated by the Tribunal.113 Indeed, Respondent argues that any provisional measure intended to prevent such evidence from being presented would be equivalent to ruling on and rejecting such evidence without having examined it, which would affect Bolivia\u2019s right to defense.114\n\n*Id*.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Objection, \u00b6 72.\n\n90.\n\nIn this regard, Respondent states that provisional measures directed to prevent the \"contamination\" of evidence are appropriate only where such evidence is likely to disappear, be destroyed or become unavailable. In these cases, provisional measures are appropriate because they protect the Tribunal\u2019s ability to examine evidence in the future. Respondent argues that what Claimants seek is the opposite, that is, the issuance of provisional measures that would prevent particular evidence from ever being submitted to the Tribunal.115\n\nRespondent\u2019s Objection, \u00b6\u00b6 70, 73.\n\n91.\n\nRespondent rejects Claimants\u2019 accusation that the criminal proceedings were artificially instituted by Bolivia to destroy or distort the evidentiary value of certain documents relevant to proving their condition as investors. This would imply falsely accusing Bolivia of a crime. Respondent asserts that the Bolivian State is governed by the principle of separation of powers and that the Executive branch does not interfere in the administration of justice. Respondent contends that the factual circumstances that motivated the criminal proceedings fully justify such proceedings.116\n\nRespondent\u2019s Objection, \u00b6 12\n\n***c. With respect to the exclusivity of the ICSID proceedings***\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n92.\n\nRespondent maintains that the exclusivity of the ICSID proceedings may only be threatened by a parallel proceeding, i.e., one that deals with the same matter. Respondent relies on *Tokios Tokel\u00e9s v. Ukraine*117 and *City Oriente v. Ecuador*118, where the rights subject to the parallel proceedings were the same rights submitted to the consideration of the tribunal in the ICSID proceedings.119\n\n*Tokios Tokel\u00e9s* v. *Ukraine*, Order No. 1, July 1, 2003, \u00b6 3.\n\n*City Oriente v. Ecuador,* Decision on Provisional Measures of 19 November 2007, \u00b6\u00b6 49- 54.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Objection, \u00b6\u00b6 74-76.\n\n93.\n\nRespondent rejects Claimants\u2019 argument that the criminal proceedings are directed to denying Claimants\u2019 condition as investors protected by the BIT or deciding on the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction. To the contrary, Respondent argues that the purpose of the criminal proceedings is to establish whether the individuals prosecuted committed certain crimes and, if so, to sanction such criminal conduct. Thus, the criminal proceedings do not interfere with the sphere of jurisdiction and competence of the Tribunal.120\n\nRespondent\u2019s Objection, \u00b6\u00b6 76-77.\n\n94.\n\nAs a result, Respondent contends that the criminal proceedings are not parallel to the ICSID proceedings. While the criminal proceedings seek to sanction crimes that may have been committed, the ICSID arbitration is directed to determining whether the Claimants have the right to the relief they invoke and the compensation they are claiming. Respondent argues that \"[t]he circumstance that the documents whose falsification is being investigated are related to the Claimants' status as shareholders in a Bolivian company does not transform the criminal proceeding into a proceeding that is parallel to the ICSID arbitration, because the results of the criminal proceeding will be the application, or not, of penalties for falsification pursuant to Bolivian law, regardless of the decision of the Arbitral Tribunal regarding the relevance of the claims under the BIT with Chile.\"121\n\nRespondent\u2019s Rejoinder, \u00b6 22.\n\n95.\n\nIn addition, Respondent claims that the proceedings are legitimate *per se*, and not motivated by the ICSID arbitration. Indeed, Respondent argues that by requesting provisional measures Claimants seek to prevent Bolivia from exercising its sovereign right to prosecute crimes within its own territory.122 Respondent asserts that the existence of documentation with indications of forgery offers sufficient grounds to merit the initiation of criminal proceedings. In addition, Respondent claims that public officials are required by law to report the commission of a crime.123 The fact that Bolivia paid more attention to NMM\u2019s corporate structure after Claimants filed their Request for Arbitration and thereby discovered irregularities does not mean that the criminal proceedings are a reaction to the ICSID arbitration.124\n\nRespondent\u2019s Rejoinder, \u00b6 6.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Rejoinder, \u00b6 6. Respondent\u2019s Rejoinder is accompanied by the Expert Report of Dr. Mary Elizabeth Carrasco Condarco, which describes the principles of Bolivian criminal procedure.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Rejoinder, \u00b6 28.\n\n**2. Requirements for provisional measures**\n--------------------------------------------\n\n96.\n\nRespondent submits that provisional measures may be granted only in situations in which there exists an urgent need to safeguard rights that are in imminent danger of irreparable harm, in such a way that the party could find the party\u2019s rights irreparably affected before a decision is made on the merits.125 Respondent relies on *Occidental v. Ecuador*,126*Tokios Tokel\u00e9s v. Ukraine127* and the *Aegean Sea Continental Shelf Case (Greece v. Turkey).*128\n\nRespondent\u2019s Objection, \u00b6 40.\n\n*Occidental v. Ecuador*, Decision on provisional measures of 17 August 2007, \u00b6 61\n\n*Tokios Tokel\u00e9s v. Ukraine*, Order No. 3, January 18, 2005, \u00b6 8.\n\n*Aegean Sea Continental Shelf Case (Greece* v. *Turkey),* Order of September 11 *,* 1976, ICJ Reports 3, \u00b6\u00b6 25, 33.\n\n97.\n\nIn this case, Respondent claims that the provisional measures requested are neither urgent nor necessary, because there is no imminent threat of an irreparable harm.\n\n***a. Urgency***\n----------------\n\n98.\n\nWith respect to the urgency requirement, Respondent states that the threat of irreparable harm must be present and imminent. If the threat is not present or the harm is not imminent, there is no need to decide anything before the award or decision is issued. The urgency must be assessed at the time of the request, and should not be a speculation on the future.129 Respondent relies on the *Case Concerning Certain Criminal Proceedings in France (Republic of Congo v. France*).130\n\nRespondent\u2019s Rejoinder, \u00b6 38\n\n*Certain Criminal Proceedings in France* (*Republic of the Congo v. France, 2003),* Order of June 17, 2003, ICJ Reports 2003, \u00b6 35.\n\n99.\n\nAccording to Respondent, Claimants\u2019 allegations that they will not be able to access key documents or witnesses to present their case on jurisdiction (particularly their fear that key witnesses will be deprived of their liberty) are mere speculations conditional on future events, and thus are incompatible with the notion of urgency.131\n\nRespondent\u2019s Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 34-37, 41, 44.\n\n***b. Necessity***\n------------------\n\n100.\n\nRespondent denies that the measures are necessary to prevent irreparable harm to Claimants\u2019 rights. As a preliminary matter, Respondent claims that the requirement of necessity is premised on the existence of a right that requires protection from an irreparable harm. As explained above, Respondent denies that such a right exists in this case.\n\n101.\n\nIn any event, as outlined in the preceding section, Respondent denies that there is any threat of harm to any of the rights invoked by Claimants. Thus, the requirement of necessity is not met.\n\n102.\n\nNotwithstanding the above and to support its claims that no provisional measures are necessary, Respondent has committed to:\n\n(a) Provide certified copies of the corporate documentation sequestered by the Bolivian authorities; and\n\n(b) Collaborate so the persons involved in the criminal proceedings can be called as witnesses in the arbitration.\n\n103.\n\nWith respect to documents, Respondent stated in its Rejoinder that \"as a clear sign that it has no intention of putting obstacles in the way of the Claimants\u2019 probative task, Bolivia has agreed to obtain from the Prosecutor\u2019s Office certified copies of any documents identified by the Claimants, if they should have any difficulty in doing so.\"132 During the telephone conference that took place on 24 November 2009, Respondent stated that more than a commitment, this was an expression of Claimants\u2019 unrestricted right to access to documents under Bolivian law.133 This said, after being specifically asked by the President of the Tribunal, Respondent confirmed the commitment undertaken in the Rejoinder with respect to access to documents.134\n\nRespondent\u2019s Rejoinder, \u00b6 33.\n\nTranscript, p. 81, lines 16-22; p. 82, lines 1-11.\n\nTranscript, p. 86, lines 10-22; p. 87, lines 1-14; p. 92, lines 12-22.\n\n104.\n\nWith respect to access to witnesses, Respondent stated in its Rejoinder that the persons involved in the criminal proceedings \"could be witnesses if they wanted. In fact, since Respondent would certainly be interested in questioning them to see if it would finally be possible to clarify the famous issue of the \"formal errors\u2019, it would cooperate as necessary so that they could offer their testimony to the Tribunal.\"135 This commitment was confirmed by Respondent during the telephone conference.136\n\nRespondent\u2019s Rejoinder, \u00b6 35.\n\nTranscript, p. 89, lines 13-16; p. 90, lines 2-22; p. 91, line 1, 18-22.\n\n**IV. DISCUSSION**\n------------------\n\n**A. Applicable Standards**\n---------------------------\n\n**1. Legal framework**\n----------------------\n\n105.\n\nThe relevant rules are found in Article 47 of the ICSID Convention and Rule 39 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules, which are generally considered to grant wide discretion to the Arbitral Tribunal on the issue of provisional measures.\n\n106.\n\nArticle 47 of the ICSID Convention provides that:\n\nExcept as the parties otherwise agree, the Tribunal may, if it considers that the circumstances so require, recommend any provisional measures which should be taken to preserve the respective rights of either party.\n\n107.\n\nRule 39 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules (effective as of January 1, 2003) provides in relevant parts:\n\n(1) At any time during the proceeding a party may request that provisional measures for the preservation of its rights be recommended by the Tribunal. The request shall specify the rights to be preserved, the measures the recommendation of which is requested, and the circumstances that require such measures.\n\n(2) The Tribunal shall give priority to the consideration of a request made pursuant to paragraph (1).\n\n(3) The Tribunal may also recommend provisional measures on its own initiative or recommend measures other than those specified in a request. It may at any time modify or revoke its recommendations.\n\n(4) The Tribunal shall only recommend provisional measures, or modify or revoke its recommendations, after giving each party an opportunity of presenting its observations.\n\n[...]\n\n**2.** ***Prima facie*** **jurisdiction**\n-----------------------------------------\n\n108.\n\nIt is undisputed by the Parties that the Arbitral Tribunal has the power to order provisional measures prior to ruling on its jurisdiction. The Tribunal will not exercise such power, however, unless there is a *prima facie* basis for jurisdiction.\n\n109.\n\nThe Tribunal is satisfied that it has *prima facie* jurisdiction for the purposes of rendering this decision. The Request for Provisional Measures was filed by Claimants in this arbitration. Claimants claim to be Chilean nationals, and Chile is a signatory to the ICSID Convention. At the date when Claimants\u2019 Request for Arbitration was filed, as well as at the date when the Request for Arbitration was registered by the ICSID Secretariat, Bolivia was still a signatory to the ICSID Convention. Thus, the Tribunal has *prima facie* jurisdiction *ratione personae*.\n\n110.\n\nClaimants claim that the disputes brought before this Tribunal arise from breaches by Bolivia of its obligations with respect to Claimants\u2019 investments in Bolivia under the Chile-Bolivia BIT. To this date, Bolivia has not contested this allegation. Thus, the Tribunal has *prima facie* jurisdiction *ratione materiae*.\n\n111.\n\nFurther, Claimants allege that the dispute arose in June 2004, long after the entry into force of the BIT in 1999. Bolivia has not contested this allegation. The Tribunal therefore also has *prima facie* jurisdiction *ratione temporis.*\n\n112.\n\nFinally, by ratifying the Chile-Bolivia BIT, Bolivia consented in writing to the jurisdiction of the Centre over disputes such as those brought by Claimants. Claimants consented in writing to the jurisdiction of the Centre by filing their Request for Arbitration. Consequently, the Tribunal has *prima facie* jurisdiction *ratione voluntatis,* on the basis of the Parties' consent.\n\n**3. Requirements for provisional measures**\n--------------------------------------------\n\n113.\n\nThere is no disagreement between the Parties, and rightly so, that provisional measures can only be granted under the relevant rules and standards, if rights to be protected do exist (Section B below), and the measures are urgent (Section C below) and necessary (Section D below), this last requirement implying an assessment of the risk of harm to be avoided by the measures. By contrast, the Parties disagree on the type and existence of the rights to be protected. The Parties further disagree on whether the measures are urgent and/or necessary. The Tribunal will now review the different requirements for provisional measures set out and the Parties\u2019 divergent positions in this respect.\n\n**B. Existence of Rights Requiring Preservation**\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n114.\n\nClaimants allege that the following three rights need preservation by way of provisional measures: (i) the right to preservation of the *status quo* and non-aggravation of the dispute; (ii) the right to the procedural integrity of the arbitration proceedings, and (iii) the right to exclusivity of the ICSID proceedings in accordance with Art. 26 of the ICSID Convention.\n\n115.\n\nAs a preliminary matter, the Tribunal will deal first with Bolivia\u2019s contention that the rights that may be protected by provisional measures may only be the rights \"in dispute\", and specifically whether under the circumstances of this case the rights invoked by Claimants may be preserved by provisional measures (Section 1 below). The Tribunal will then review the right to exclusivity of the ICSID proceedings (Section 2 below); then the right to preservation of the *status quo* and non-aggravation of the dispute (Section 3 below); and finally the right to the procedural integrity of the arbitration proceedings (Section 4 below).\n\n**1. Rights that may be protected by provisional measures**\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n116.\n\nBolivia contends that provisional measures may not be granted in this case because the criminal proceedings do not affect any of Claimants\u2019 rights \"in dispute\", understood as the rights that are the subject matter of the ICSID arbitration. In contrast, Claimants argue that identity between the object of the coercive measures from which protection is sought and the rights in dispute is not required.\n\n117.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees with Claimants\u2019 position. In the Tribunal's view, the rights to be preserved by provisional measures are not limited to those which form the subject matter of the dispute, but may extend to procedural rights, including the general right to the preservation of the *status quo* and to the non-aggravation of the dispute. As stated by the Tribunal in *Burlington v. Ecuador*, these latter rights are self-standing rights.137 The Tribunal in *Biwater Gauff v. Tanzania* reached a similar conclusion.138\n\n*Burlington v. Ecuador,* \u00b6 60.\n\nSee *Biwater Gauff v. Tanzania*, Procedural Order No. 1, 31 March 2006, \u00b6 71 (\"The type of rights capable of protection by means of provisional measures are not only substantive rights but also procedural rights\").\n\n118.\n\nIn the Tribunal\u2019s view, the applicable criterion is that the right to be preserved bears a relation with the dispute. This was the standard adopted by the tribunal in *Plama v. Bulgaria* :\n\nThe rights to be preserved must relate to the requesting party's ability to have its claims and requests for relief in the arbitration fairly considered and decided by the arbitral tribunal and for any arbitral decision which grants to the Claimant the relief it seeks to be effective and able to be carried out. Thus the rights to be preserved by provisional measures are circumscribed by the requesting party's claims and requests for relief. They may be general rights, such as the rights to due process or the right not to have the dispute aggravated, but those general rights must be related to the specific disputes in arbitration, which, in turn, are defined by the Claimant's claims and requests for relief to date.139\n\n*Plama Consortium Limited* v. *Republic of Bulgaria*, ICSID Case No. ARB/03/24 (\"Plama v. Bulgaria\"), Order, 6 September 2005, \u00b6 40.\n\n119.\n\nIt is evident from the record that the criminal proceedings are related to, and may even be motivated by, the ICSID arbitration. Most of the documents in the criminal proceedings refer expressly to the ICSID arbitration. To cite one example, when David Moscoso made his alleged confession, such confession specifically stated to be issued \"within the Request for Arbitration initiated by [Quiborax].\"140\n\nAffidavit of David Moscoso (Annex CPM-21). (Original in Spanish).\n\n120.\n\nAlthough the subject matter of the criminal proceedings is the prosecution of crimes of forgery, use of forged documents, fraud, destruction of personal property to defraud and dereliction of duties, the factual accusation underlying these proceedings is that the minutes of 13 September 2001 of NMM were forged to support Claimants\u2019 contention that they were shareholders of NMM at the time the dispute brought before this Tribunal arose, thus allowing them to gain access to ICSID arbitration under the Chile-Bolivia BIT.141 This access to ICSID arbitration is expressly deemed to constitute the harm caused to Bolivia that is required as one of the constituent elements of the crimes prosecuted.142 Thus, the criminal proceedings are related to this arbitration because both the conduct alleged and the harm allegedly caused relate closely to Claimants\u2019 standing as investors in the ICSID proceeding.\n\n*See, e.g.* Request for Abbreviated Proceeding (Annex CPM-19), p. 5 (\"For the above reasons [and] the existing evidence Mr. David Moscoso recognizes freely and spontaneously the falsity introduced in the minutes of 13 September of 2001, whose only objective was to make the Chilean company QUIBORAX a participant in the incorporation of the company N.M.M. and to use this to benefit from the Bolivia-Chile bilateral treaty and in this way sue the Bolivian State and cause a harm to it.\") (Original in Spanish).\n\n*See* Querella Criminal (Annex CPM-9) pp. 1209-1210; Formal Indictment (Annex CPM-11), pp. 4-5; Request for Abbreviated Proceeding (Annex CPM-19), p. 5; Resolution No. 313/2009 (Annex CPM-20), p. 3; Complaint for crimes committed by competent authority (Annex CPM-23), p. 2.\n\n121.\n\nIn addition, although the Tribunal has every respect for Bolivia\u2019s sovereign right to prosecute crimes committed within its territory, the evidence in the record suggests that the criminal proceedings were initiated as a result of a corporate audit that targeted Claimants *because* they had initiated this arbitration. Indeed, the *Querella Criminal* expressly states that the alleged irregularities in Claimants\u2019 corporate documentation were detected in consideration of (\"en atenci\u00f3n a\") the Request for Arbitration filed by Claimants against Bolivia.143 Lorena Fern\u00e1ndez, one of the authors of Informe 001/2005, testified that the corporate audit was made at the request of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in the context of an arbitration proceeding and was aimed at establishing whether the shareholders in NMM were Chilean nationals.144 Indeed, the very content of Informe 001/2005 suggests that the underlying motivation for the audit was to serve Bolivia in the defense of this arbitration claim, as it contained specific recommendations for such defense.145\n\n*See* Querella Criminal (Annex CPM-9), p. 1209 (\"In consideration of the request for arbitration filed by the company Qu\u00edmica e Industrial del B\u00f3rax Ltda., Non Metallic Minerals S.A. and Mr. Allan Isaac Fosk Kapl\u00fan, against the Bolivian State, a series of irregularities had been detected because certain documentation appeared to have been fabricated in order to mislead the *Superintendencia de Empresas*, during audits carried out to such company due to the incomplete documentation that was presented to the auditing entity, so that it would certify that the company Non Metallic Minerals had foreign capital so that it could benefit from the Bilateral Investment Treaty signed with the Republic of Chile and thus not [have to] go before Bolivian courts.\"). (Original in Spanish)\n\n*See* Declaration of Lorena Fern\u00e1ndez (Annex CPM-37), pp. 2, 4.\n\n*See* Informe 001/2005 (Annex CPM-14), pp. 6-7.\n\n122.\n\nThe Tribunal cannot fail to note that these actions were taken after an inter-ministerial committee specifically recommended in the 2004 Memo that Bolivia should try to find flaws in Claimants\u2019 mining concessions as a defense strategy for the ICSID arbitration.146 Seen jointly with the 2004 Memo, the corporate audit and the criminal proceedings appear to be part of a defense strategy adopted by Bolivia with respect to the ICSID arbitration.\n\n*See* 2004 Memo (Annex CPM-5).\n\n123.\n\nWhether such defense strategy amounts to harassment, as Claimants allege, is not clear to the Tribunal. Bolivia has the sovereign power to prosecute conduct that may constitute a crime on its own territory, if it has sufficient elements justifying prosecution. Bolivia also has the power to investigate whether Claimants have made their investments in Bolivia in accordance with Bolivian law and to present evidence in that respect. But such powers must be exercised in good faith and respecting Claimants\u2019 rights, including their *prima facie* right to pursue this arbitration.\n\n124.\n\nWhat is clear to the Tribunal is that there is a direct relationship between the criminal proceedings and this ICSID arbitration that may merit the preservation of Claimants\u2019 rights in the ICSID proceeding. The Tribunal will now examine specifically whether any or all of the three rights invoked by the Claimant merit such protection in the specific circumstances of the case.\n\n**2. Right to exclusivity of the ICSID proceedings in accordance with Art. 26 of the ICSID Convention**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n125.\n\nClaimants argue that provisional measures are necessary to preserve the exclusivity of the ICSID proceedings under Article 26 of the ICSID Convention, which provides in relevant part:\n\nConsent of the parties to arbitration under this Convention shall, unless otherwise stated, be deemed consent to such arbitration to the exclusion of any other remedy.\n\n126.\n\nClaimants argue that the criminal proceedings are aimed at destroying their status as foreign investors under the Bolivia-Chile BIT and thus constitute \"other remedy\" for purposes of Art. 26 of the ICSID Convention. Bolivia rejects this argument by pointing out that the subject matter of the ICSID proceeding (determining whether Bolivia has breached its obligations under the BIT and Claimants are entitled to the relief sought) is distinct from the subject matter of the criminal proceedings (prosecuting and punishing crimes in accordance with Bolivian law).\n\n127.\n\nThe Tribunal has no doubt that the right to exclusivity of the ICSID proceedings is susceptible of protection by way of provisional measures. In the words of the *Tokios Tokel\u00e9s v. Ukraine* tribunal:\n\nAmong the rights that may be protected by provisional measures is the right guaranteed by Article 26 to have the ICSID arbitration be the exclusive remedy for the dispute to the exclusion of any other remedy, whether domestic or international, judicial or administrative.147\n\n*Tokios Tokel\u00e9s v. Ukraine,* Order No. 3 of 18 January 2005, \u00b6 7, citation omitted.\n\n128.\n\nThe question that arises is whether the continuation of the criminal proceedings referred to in this decision threatens the exclusivity of the ICSID proceedings. The Tribunal considers that it does not. Although it finds that the criminal proceedings are related to the ICSID arbitration, that does not *per se* threaten the exclusivity of the arbitration proceedings under Article 26 of the ICSID Convention. Pursuant to Article 25 of the ICSID Convention, the Centre has jurisdiction to resolve investment disputes. Thus, the exclusivity of the ICSID proceedings applies only to investment disputes, i.e. here to the determination of whether Respondent has breached its international obligations under the BIT and whether Claimants are entitled to the relief they seek.\n\n129.\n\nConsequently, the exclusivity of the ICSID proceedings does not extend to criminal proceedings. Criminal proceedings deal with criminal liability and not with investment disputes, and fall by definition outside the scope of the Centre\u2019s jurisdiction and the competence of this Tribunal. Neither the ICSID Convention nor the BIT contain any rule enjoining a State from exercising criminal jurisdiction, nor do they exempt suspected criminals from prosecution by virtue of their being investors.\n\n130.\n\nThus, the Tribunal finds that the criminal proceedings initiated by Respondent do not threaten the exclusivity of the ICSID proceedings. Even if the criminal proceedings result in evidence that is later used by Respondent in this arbitration, that would not undermine the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction to resolve Claimants\u2019 claims, if such jurisdiction is established at the appropriate procedural instance.\n\n131.\n\nIn this respect, the Tribunal notes that the practice of ICSID tribunals has been to consider that other proceedings are parallel for purposes of Art. 26 of the ICSID Convention when such proceedings deal with the same subject matter as the ICSID dispute. This was the criterion adopted by the tribunal in *Perenco v. Ecuador*148*,* for instance.\n\n*Perenco Ecuador Limited v. Republic of Ecuador and Empresa Estatal Petr\u00f3leos del Ecuador (Petroecuador)* (ICSID Case No. ARB/08/6) (\"*Perenco v. Ecuador*\"), Decision on Provisional Measures, 8 May 2009, \u00b6 61.\n\n**3. The right to the preservation of the** ***status quo*** **and the non-aggravation of the dispute**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n132.\n\nClaimants allege that the criminal proceedings are aggravating the dispute because they put intolerable pressure on them to abandon their claim and are thus aimed at avoiding the resolution of the dispute. Claimants also allege that the criminal proceedings have changed the *status quo* of the dispute, as they have become defendants in Bolivia, and have created serious obstacles for Claimants\u2019 presentation of their claim. Respondent opposes that there is no self-standing right to the preservation of the *status quo* or the non-aggravation of the dispute and that, in any event, there is no aggravation of the dispute or need to preserve the *status quo*, because the criminal proceedings do not affect the rights in dispute.\n\n133.\n\nAs noted above, the Tribunal considers that although the criminal proceedings do not deal with the same subject matter as the ICSID proceeding, they are sufficiently related to merit the protection of Claimants\u2019 rights to the non-aggravation of the dispute and the preservation of the *status quo*, which the Tribunal considers to be self-standing rights.\n\n134.\n\nThe existence of the right to the preservation of the *status quo* and the non-aggravation of the dispute is well-established at least since the case of the *Electricity Company of Sofia and Bulgaria.*149 In the same vein, the *travaux pr\u00e9paratoires* of the ICSID Convention referred to the need *\"to preserve the status quo between the parties pending* [the] *final decision on the merits*\" and the commentary to the 1968 edition of the ICSID Arbitration Rules explained that Article 47 of the Convention *\"is based on the principle that once a dispute is submitted to arbitration the parties should not take steps that might aggravate or extend their dispute or prejudice the execution of the award.*\"150\n\n*Electricity Company of Sofia and Bulgaria (Belgium v. Bulgaria)*, Judgment of 5 December 1939, PCIJ series A/B, No 79, p.199. *See also* the *LaGrand case (Germany v. United States)*, Judgment of 27 June 2001, \u00b6 103, ICJ Reports 2001, p. 466.\n\n1 ICSID Reports, p. 99.\n\n135.\n\nIn ICSID jurisprudence, this principle was first affirmed in *Holiday Inns v. Morocco*151 and then reiterated in *Amco v. Indonesia*. In the latter case, the tribunal acknowledged *\"the good and fair practical rule, according to which both Parties to a legal dispute should refrain, in their own interest, to do anything that could aggravate or exacerbate the same, thus rendering its solution possibly more difficult\"152.*\n\n*Holiday Inns S.A. and others v. Kingdom of Morocco* (ICSID Case No. ARB/72/1), Order of 2 July 1972, not public but commented in Pierre Lalive, \"The First \"World Bank\u2019\" Arbitration (*Holiday Inns v. Morocco*) - Some Legal Problems\", BYIL, 1980.\n\n*Amco Asia v. Indonesia*, Decision on request for provisional measures of 9 December 1983, ICSID Reports, 1993, p. 412.\n\n136.\n\nThe principle was re-affirmed in *Plama v. Bulgaria*153 (although with a somewhat more limited approach), *Occidental v. Ecuador*154, *City Oriente v. Ecuador*155, and *Burlington v. Ecuador*.156\n\n*Plama v. Bulgaria*, Order of 6 September 2005, \u00b6 40.\n\n*Occidental v. Ecuador*, Decision on provisional measures of 17 August 2007, \u00b6 96.\n\n*City Oriente v. Ecuador*, Decision on provisional measures of 19 November 2007, \u00b6 55.\n\n*Burlington v. Ecuador*, Procedural Order No, 1 of 29 June 2009, \u00b6\u00b6 61-68.\n\n137.\n\nHaving established the existence of these rights, the question that arises is whether the criminal proceedings are in fact aggravating the ICSID dispute or have changed the *status quo*.\n\n138.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees with Claimants that the criminal proceedings exacerbate the climate of hostility in which the dispute is unfolding. However, it also notes that Claimants have no more activities or presence in Bolivia. Their mining concessions have been revoked, so there is no ongoing investment to protect. Co-Claimant Allan Fosk - the only Claimant implicated in the criminal proceedings - has not been formally accused and does not live in Bolivia. Thus, the Tribunal cannot agree with Claimants that the criminal proceedings place \"intolerable pressure\" on Claimants to drop their claims. Likewise, the Tribunal cannot concur with Claimants\u2019 argument that the criminal proceedings have changed the *status quo* of the dispute because they have turned them into defendants in Bolivia. If there are legitimate grounds for the criminal proceedings, Claimants must bear the burden of their conduct in Bolivia.\n\n**4. Right to the procedural integrity of the arbitration proceedings**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n139.\n\nClaimants assert that the criminal proceedings impair their right to the procedural integrity of the arbitration proceedings, in particular with respect to their access to evidence and the integrity of the evidence. Specifically, Claimants claim that through the criminal proceedings Respondent has obstructed their access to indispensable evidence by sequestering their corporate records and alienating potential witnesses; that Respondent has fabricated *ex post facto* evidence by forcing false confessions out of a potential witness and thus making him unavailable to testify, and seeks to do the same with other potential witnesses; and that Respondent attempts to destroy the probative value of certain documents, such as Informe 001/2005.\n\n140.\n\nRespondent denies that the criminal proceedings pose a threat to the procedural integrity of the arbitration proceedings, in particular with respect to the production of evidence. If Claimants\u2019 allegation refers to the evidence to be presented by Claimants, Respondent submits that Claimants have already presented substantial evidence, and that Respondent is in no way restricting its access to documentary evidence or potential witnesses. To the contrary, Respondent submits that granting provisional measures would deprive it of the possibility to present its own case, because the criminal proceedings may result in evidence that could be submitted to this Tribunal. Respondent also rejects Claimants\u2019 accusation that the criminal proceedings were artificially instituted by Bolivia to destroy or distort the evidentiary value of certain documents relevant to proving their condition as investors.\n\n141.\n\nThe Tribunal has no doubt that it has the power to grant provisional measures to preserve the procedural integrity of the ICSID proceedings, in particular the access to and integrity of the evidence. Such measures were granted in *Biwater Gauff v. Tanzania*157 and *Agip v. Congo*158 with respect to documentary evidence.\n\n*Biwater Gauff v. Tanzania*, \u00b6\u00b6 84- 98.\n\n*Agip SpA v. People's Republic of Congo*, ICSID Case No. ARB/77/1, Decision, 18 January 1979, reported in the Award of 30 November 1979, 1 ICSID Reports, p. 310.\n\n142.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that the criminal proceedings may indeed be impairing Claimants\u2019 right to present their case, in particular with respect to their access to documentary evidence and witnesses. Claimants have been deprived of their corporate records and, although it appears from the record that Claimants have had access to copies of certain documents, it is unclear whether they are still missing relevant documentation that might assist them in presenting their case on jurisdiction or the merits.\n\n143.\n\nThe Tribunal is also troubled by the effect that the criminal proceedings may have on potential witnesses. The record shows that Respondent has pressed formal charges against several persons involved in Claimants\u2019 operation in Bolivia, including its business partner, former counsel, the authors of Informe 001/2005, and the judge who refused to order the preventive detention of Mr. Moscoso. It is true that Claimants have already produced evidence with their Memorial and that these persons have not been named as witnesses. However, Claimants have not answered any possible objections to jurisdiction yet nor submitted their Reply to Respondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial on the merits, if any. If such objections are raised, then the record as its stands seems to indicate that these persons may indeed be privy to relevant facts and be asked to give evidence.\n\n144.\n\nRespondent denies that it has exercised any undue pressure on these persons that could prevent them from acting as witnesses in this arbitration. However, at least one of them - David Moscoso - is as a result of the criminal proceedings legally prevented from testifying for Claimants in the ICSID proceedings because he cannot testify against his own confession.\n\n145.\n\nIn addition, the way in which the criminal proceedings against David Moscoso developed suggests that Respondent indeed may be exercising undue pressure against potential witnesses. The record shows that David Moscoso had first denied participation in the crimes charged and confessed only after bail of US$300,000 was set on his personal liberty. Such bail had first been denied by the competent judge, and was only set after that judge was charged with malfeasance in office for having neglected to consider the importance of the case for the State of Bolivia. The Tribunal also finds it troubling that although the Bolivian authorities first insisted on Mr. Moscoso\u2019s preventive detention, once he had confessed he was immediately pardoned, which seems to suggest that the restriction on his personal liberty was meant as an intimidation measure and not because the nature or circumstances of the crime required Mr. Moscoso\u2019s detention.\n\n146.\n\nEven if no undue pressure is exercised on potential witnesses, the very nature of these criminal proceedings is bound to reduce their willingness to cooperate in the ICSID proceeding. Given that the existence of this ICSID arbitration has been characterized within the criminal proceedings as a harm to Bolivia, it is unlikely that the persons charged will feel free to participate as witnesses in this arbitration.\n\n147.\n\nThe Tribunal is not persuaded by Respondent\u2019s argument that if provisional measures are granted this would affect Respondent\u2019s ability to present its case in this ICSID arbitration. Somewhat paradoxically, Respondent itself has argued that the criminal proceedings are not directed to determine the jurisdiction of this Tribunal. In any event, whether Claimants made an investment in Bolivia that is covered by the Chile-Bolivia BIT will not be proved or disproved by criminal proceedings, but by evidence related to ownership and to the manner in which the investment was made, among others. Even if the criminal proceedings could potentially result in evidence of facts related to this Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction, the Tribunal would not be bound by it.\n\n148.\n\nThus, the Tribunal finds that Claimants have shown the existence of a threat to the procedural integrity of the ICSID proceedings, in particular with respect to their right to access to evidence through potential witnesses. In the words of the *Plama* tribunal, the Tribunal finds that, under the particular circumstances of this case, the rights invoked by Claimants and analyzed in this Section relate to Claimants\u2019 \"ability to have [their] claims and requests for relief in the arbitration fairly considered and decided by the arbitral tribunal\".159\n\n*Plama v. Bulgaria*, Order, 6 September 2005, \u00b6 40.\n\n**C. Urgency**\n--------------\n\n149.\n\nThe Parties agree that there is urgency when there is a need to safeguard rights that are in imminent danger of irreparable harm before a decision is made on the merits. They disagree, however, on whether the present facts meet the urgency requirement.\n\n150.\n\nThe Arbitral Tribunal agrees with Claimants that the criterion of urgency is satisfied when \"a question cannot await the outcome of the award on the merits\"160. This is in line with the practice of the International Court of Justice (\"ICJ\")161. The same definition has also been given in *Biwater Gauff v. Tanzania* :\n\nIn the Arbitral Tribunal\u2019s view, the degree of \"urgency\" which is required depends on the circumstances, including the requested provisional measures, and may be satisfied where a party can prove that there is a need to obtain the requested measures at a certain point in the procedure before the issuance of an award.162\n\nChristoph Schreuer, *The ICSID Convention: A Commentary*, Cambridge University Press, 2001, p. 751, \u00b6 14.\n\nIn the words of the ICJ, \"[w]hereas the power of the Court to indicate provisional measures will be exercised only if there is urgency in the sense that there is a real risk that action prejudicial to the rights of either party might be taken before the Court has given its final decision (see, for example, *Passage through the Great Belt (Finland v. Denmark)*, Provisional Measures, Order of 29 July 1991, ICJ Reports 1991, p. 17, \u00b6 23; *Certain Criminal Proceedings in France (Republic of the Congo v. France)*, Provisional Measures, Order of 17 June 2003, ICJ Reports 2003, p. 107, \u00b6 22 *;* *Pulp Mills on the River Uruguay (Argentina v. Uruguay)*, Preliminary Objections, Order of 23 January 2007, p. 11, \u00b6 32), and whereas the Court thus has to consider whether in the current proceedings such urgency exists\", *Case Concerning Application of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (Georgia v. Russian Federation),* Order of 15 October 2008, \u00b6 129.\n\n*Biwater Gauff v. Tanzania*, Procedural Order No. 1 of 31 March 2006, \u00b6 76.\n\n151.\n\nClaimants argue that the requirement of urgency is met in this case. Specifically, Claimants contend that because the measures are intended to protect against the aggravation of the dispute and to safeguard the jurisdictional powers of the Tribunal and the integrity of the arbitration, they are urgent by definition.\n\n152.\n\nBy contrast, Respondent argues that there is no imminent threat to any of Claimants\u2019 rights because the alleged harm to such rights is mere speculation.\n\n153.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees with Claimants that if measures are intended to protect the procedural integrity of the arbitration, in particular with respect to access to or integrity of the evidence, they are urgent by definition. Indeed, the question of whether a Party has the opportunity to present its case or rely on the integrity of specific evidence is essential to (and therefore cannot await) the rendering of an award on the merits.\n\n**D. Necessity**\n----------------\n\n154.\n\nThe Tribunal has found that the criminal proceedings threaten the procedural integrity of the ICSID proceeding, and that provisional measures are urgent. The Tribunal will now examine if provisional measures such as those requested by Claimants are necessary.\n\n155.\n\nThe Parties agree that provisional measures must be necessary, in other words, that they must be required to avoid harm or prejudice being inflicted upon the applicant. However, they disagree on the qualification of the harm, whether serious or irreparable, and also whether the criminal proceedings present a harm to Claimants\u2019 rights that requires avoidance by granting provisional measures.\n\n156.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that an irreparable harm is a harm that cannot be repaired by an award of damages. Such a standard has been adopted by several ICSID tribunals and embodied in Art. 17A of the UNCITRAL Model Law.163 That provision requires the party requesting an interim measure to satisfy the tribunal that:\n\nHarm not adequately repaired by an award of damages is likely to result if the measure is not ordered, and such harm substantially outweighs the harm that is likely to result to the party against whom the measure is directed if the measure is granted.\n\n*See* *City Oriente v. Ecuador*, Decision on Revocation of Provisional Measures, 13 May 2008, \u00b6 72, n. 21; *Sergei Paushok v. Republic of Mongolia*, Order on Interim Measures of 2 September 2008 \u00b6\u00b6 68-69; *Burlington v. Ecuador*, Procedural Order No. 1 of 29 June 2009, \u00b6\u00b6 81-82.\n\n157.\n\nFollowing this standard, Claimants submit that the provisional measures requested are necessary because the harm caused would not be adequately repaired by an award of damages. The Tribunal agrees with Claimants in this respect: any harm caused to the integrity of the ICSID proceedings, particularly with respect to a party\u2019s access to evidence or the integrity of the evidence produced could not be remedied by an award of damages.\n\n158.\n\nHowever, Claimants have accurately pointed out that the necessity requirement requires the Tribunal to consider the proportionality of the requested provisional measures. The Tribunal must thus balance the harm caused to Claimants by the criminal proceedings and the harm that would be caused to Respondent if the proceedings were stayed or terminated.\n\n159.\n\nRespondent claims that its sovereignty would be harmed if the Tribunal orders the provisional measures sought by Claimants, as this would unduly interfere with its right to prosecute crimes committed on its territory. Respondent also argues that the criminal proceedings may provide evidence that it could present in the ICSID proceedings, and that granting the measures requested by Claimants would prevent such evidence from ever reaching the Tribunal and would thus affect its right to present its case.\n\n160.\n\nIn addition, Respondent has committed to collaborate with Claimants\u2019 access to documentary evidence and witnesses. Specifically, it has committed to:\n\n(a) \"obtain from the Prosecutor\u2019s Office certified copies of any documents identified by the Claimants, if they should have any difficulty in doing so\";164\n\n(b) \"cooperate as necessary so that [the persons charged in the criminal proceedings] could offer their testimony to the Tribunal\".165\n\nRespondent\u2019s Rejoinder \u00b6 33; *see also* Transcript, p. 81, lines 16-22; p. 82, lines 1-11.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Rejoinder \u00b6 35; *see also* Transcript, p. 86, lines 10-22; p, 87, lines 1-14; p. 92, lines 12-22.\n\n161.\n\nIn Claimants\u2019 view, these commitments are not sufficient. Claimants insist that they require the entire set of original documents sequestered by Bolivia, and that they have serious difficulties accessing documents from the criminal proceedings, so Respondent\u2019s assurance that the criminal documents are available to them is an empty promise.166\n\nTranscript, p. 86-88.\n\n162.\n\nWith respect to witnesses, Claimants contend that Respondent\u2019s assurances are insufficient because it is not in Respondent\u2019s power to grant them access to the witnesses. Claimants assert that the persons involved in the criminal proceedings cannot or are not willing to appear as witnesses in this arbitration, either because they are legally impeded from rendering testimony contrary to their prior testimony in the criminal proceedings (as is the case of David Moscoso), or because they fear that their participation in the arbitration will worsen their status in the criminal proceedings. Thus, Claimants argue that the only way to make these persons available would be to stop the criminal proceedings so that these persons can testify freely and without fear.167\n\nTranscript, p. 93-95.\n\n163.\n\nThe Tribunal takes due notice of Respondent's commitments set out in paragraph 160 above. Nonetheless, the Tribunal agrees with Claimants that in the particular circumstances of this case the commitment with respect to witnesses is insufficient. Regardless of whether the criminal proceedings have a legitimate basis or not (an issue which the Tribunal is not in a position to determine), the direct relationship between the criminal proceedings and this ICSID arbitration is preventing Claimants from accessing witnesses that could be essential to their case. No assurance of cooperation from Respondent can guarantee that persons who are being prosecuted for having allegedly caused harm to Respondent by permitting Claimants to present this arbitration will be willing to participate as witnesses in this very same arbitration. Under these circumstances, the Tribunal considers that Claimants\u2019 access to witnesses may improve if the criminal proceedings are stayed until this arbitration is finalized or this decision is reconsidered.\n\n164.\n\nThe Tribunal has given serious consideration to Respondent\u2019s argument that an order granting the provisional measures requested by Claimants would affect its sovereignty. In this respect, the Tribunal insists that it does not question the sovereign right of a State to conduct criminal cases. As mentioned in paragraph 129 above, the international protection granted to investors does not exempt suspected criminals from prosecution by virtue of their being investors. However, the situation encountered in this case is exceptional. The Tribunal has been convinced that there is a very close link between the initiation of this arbitration and the launching of the criminal cases in Bolivia. It has become clear to the Tribunal that one of the Claimants is being subjected to criminal proceedings precisely because he presented himself as an investor with a claim against Bolivia under the ICSID/BIT mechanism. Likewise, the Tribunal has been convinced that the other persons named in the criminal proceedings are being prosecuted because of their connection with this arbitration (be it as Claimants\u2019 business partners or counsel, or as authors of a report ordered by a state agency). Although Bolivia may have reasons to suspect that the persons being prosecuted could have engaged in criminal conduct, the facts presented to the Tribunal suggest that the underlying motivation to initiate the criminal proceedings was their connection to this arbitration, which has been expressly deemed to constitute the harm caused to Bolivia that is required as one of the constituent elements of the crimes prosecuted.\n\n165.\n\nIn addition, the Tribunal is of the opinion that a mere stay of the criminal proceedings would not affect Respondent\u2019s sovereignty nor require conduct in violation of national law. Respondent\u2019s expert in criminal procedure, Dr. Mary Elizabeth Carrasco Condarco, notes that the prosecutor may request the competent judge to refrain from prosecuting a criminal action in certain cases, such as when the event is of little social relevance or judicial pardon is foreseeable.168 The fact that David Moscoso was immediately pardoned, allegedly on the basis of a clean record, suggests that others in a similar situation may be pardoned as well, and that Respondent does not consider them a threat to society. In any event, the harm that such a stay would cause to Bolivia is proportionately less than the harm caused to Claimants if the criminal proceedings were to continue their course. Once this arbitration is finalized, Respondent will be free to continue the criminal proceedings, subject to the Tribunal terminating or amending this Decision prior to the completion of this arbitration.\n\nDr. Carrasco Condarco states: \"The exercise of the public criminal action may not be suspended, interrupted, nor ceased, except in the cases expressly provided by law. The prosecutor\u2019s office shall have the obligation to exercise the public criminal action in all the cases where it applies, however, it may request the Judge that exercises jurisdictional control to dispense with criminal persecution of one or more of the events prosecuted, with respect to one or more participants, only in the following cases: 1.- When it is an event of little social relevance due to its minimal effect on the legally protected interest, 2.- When the prosecuted person has suffered as a consequence of the event a physical or moral damage more serious than the sentence to be imposed; 3.- When the sentence that is expected for the crime which prosecution is dispensed with lacks importance in consideration of a sentence that has already been imposed for another crime, 4.- When judicial pardon is foreseeable and 5.-When the expected sentence lacks importance considering those of other crimes, or that which would be imposed in a proceeding taking place abroad and the requested extradition may be granted (article 21 of the [Code of Criminal Procedure]).\" Expert Report of Mary Elizabeth Carrasco Condarco, p. 3. (Original in Spanish).\n\n**V. DECISION**\n---------------\n\n[166].\n\nOn this basis, the Arbitral Tribunal makes the following decision:\n\n1. Respondent shall take all appropriate measures to suspend the criminal proceedings identified as Case N\u00b0 9394/08, initiated against Allan Fosk, David Moscoso, Fernando Rojas, Mar\u00eda del Carmen Ballivi\u00e1n, Daniel Gottschalk, Dolly Teresa Paredes de Linares, Gilka Salas Orozco, Mar\u00eda M\u00f3nica Lorena Fern\u00e1ndez Salinas, Yury Alegorio Espinoza Zalles, Tatiana Giovanna Ter\u00e1n de Velasco and Ernesto Ossio Aramayo, and any other criminal proceedings directly related to the present arbitration, until this arbitration is completed or until reconsideration of this decision, whether at the request of a Party or of the Tribunal\u2019s own motion.\n\n2. Respondent shall also refrain from initiating any other criminal proceedings directly related to the present arbitration, or engaging in any other course of action which may jeopardize the procedural integrity of this arbitration.\n\n3. Claimants\u2019 other requests for provisional measures are denied.\n\n4.

INTRODUCTION**\n-------------------\n\n**A. THE PARTIES**\n------------------\n\n**1. The Claimants**\n--------------------\n\n1.\n\nThe Claimants are Quiborax S.A. (\"Quibora\"x), a Chilean mining company, Mr. Allan Henry Isaac Fosk Kapl\u00fan (\"Allan Fosk\"), a Chilean national, and Non-Metallic Minerals S.A. (\"NMM\"), a Bolivian mining company (collectively, the \"Claimants\").\n\n2.\n\nQuiborax, a corporation created under the laws of Chile, is a mining company dedicated in particular to the extraction of ulexite, a non metallic mineral, and to the manufacture of products derived from this mineral, including boric acid. It operates in the northern part of Chile, near the border with Bolivia, and it is mostly owned by members of the Fosk family. Allan Fosk is the Chief Financial Officer of Quiborax. NMM, a corporation created under the laws of Bolivia, is a mining company that operates in the R\u00edo Grande Delta in Bolivia. Who actually owns NMM is one of the issues lying at the heart of this jurisdictional dispute.\n\n3.\n\nThe Claimants are represented in this arbitration by Andr\u00e9s Jana, Jorge Bofill, Johanna Klein Kranenberg, Ximena Fuentes, Rodrigo Gil, and Constanza Onetto of BOFILL MIR & ALVAREZ JANA.\n\n**2. The Respondent**\n---------------------\n\n4.\n\nThe Respondent is the Plurinational State of Bolivia (\"Bolivia\" or the \"Respondent\").\n\n5.\n\nThe Respondent is represented in this arbitration by Mr. Hugo Montero, Attorney General of Bolivia; Ms. Elizabeth Arismendi Chumacero, Minister of Legal Defense of the State; Mr. Danny Javier L\u00f3pez Solis, General Director of Investment Arbitration Defense (Attorney General's Office); and by Mr. Pierre Mayer, Mr. Eduardo Silva Romero, Mr. Jos\u00e9 Manuel Garc\u00eda Represa, Ms. Ana Carolina Sim\u00f6es E Silva, Mr. Francisco Paredes-Balladares, Ms. Anna Vald\u00e9s Pascal, and Mr. Pac\u00f4me Ziegler of DECHERT (PARIS) LLP.\n\n**II. THE FACTS**\n-----------------\n\n6.\n\nThis Section summarizes the facts of this dispute insofar as they bear relevance to rule on Bolivia's objections to jurisdiction.\n\n7.\n\nQuiborax is the largest supplier of borates in South America. Borates are minerals which contain boron, a semi-metallic element which is always combined with oxygen and other chemical compounds, such as arsenic and chloride. Few of the two hundred existing borates are commercially relevant: ulexite, the borate that the Claimants exploit, is one of them. Borates are used for a variety of products and manufacturing processes, such as the production of fibreglass, detergents, cleaning products, and fertilizers.1\n\nMem., \u00b6\u00b6 25-26, 29, 36.\n\n8.\n\nQuiborax was created in Chile in the 1980s by the Fosk and Fux families. Co-claimant Allan Fosk is the Chief Financial Officer of Quiborax. The company's operations were centred in the North of Chile, with its headquarters in the city of Arica. From its inception, Quiborax obtained its boron from a boron mine located in a dry salt lake in the Salar de Surire, Chile. Deposits of boron minerals are very rare, as they are formed only in extremely dry regions. In point of fact, most commercially relevant boron deposits are located in a handful of countries: Turkey and the United States concentrate over half of the world boron reserves2, followed by Russia, China, Chile, Peru, and Bolivia. As a result, the borates market is naturally oligopolistic.3\n\nAs a matter of fact, the Turkish state-owned company Eti Mine and the American privately-owned company R\u00edo Tinto are the main suppliers of borates worldwide (Mem., \u00b6 34).\n\nMem., \u00b6\u00b6 18, 20, 22-23, 33-34, 36.\n\n9.\n\nThe borates market appears to have the greatest potential for growth in the production of fertilizers for agricultural uses. Pursuing an expansion strategy from the mid-1990s, Quiborax resolved to diversify borate production in order to enter the borate market for agricultural uses. The ulexite resources from the Salar de Surire, however, proved insufficient to meet Quiborax's growing boron demands resulting from this expansion strategy. Eventually, searching for additional sources of ulexite, Quiborax turned its attention to neighbouring Bolivia, where the ulexite-rich Salar de Uyuni is located.4\n\n*Id*., at \u00b6\u00b6 30, 40, 44.\n\n10.\n\nThe Salar de Uyuni, in Bolivia, is the largest dry salt lake in the world. It contains about 9.5 million tons of ulexite of admittedly outstanding quality, *i.e.* high boron concentration and low content of impurities such as arsenic. The highest concentration of minerals in the Salar de Uyuni is located in the R\u00edo Grande area. At the time Quiborax became interested in acquiring ulexite from Bolivia in 1999-2000, Bolivian company Compa\u00f1\u00eda Minera R\u00edo Grande Sur S.A. (\"R\u00edo Grande\" or \"RIGSSA\"5) owned the mining concessions that authorized the exploitation of the boron deposits in the Salar de Uyuni.6\n\nThe Claimants refer to this company as \"RIGSSA\"; the Respondent as \"R\u00edo Grande.\"\n\nMem., \u00b6\u00b6 45, 47.\n\n11.\n\nR\u00edo Grande is a mining company that was incorporated under the laws of Bolivia in December 1997. When R\u00edo Grande and Quiborax first came into contact, the shareholders of R\u00edo Grande were David Moscoso, a Bolivian national (50% of shares); Edsal Finance Inc., a corporation created under the laws of Panama and represented by Alvaro Ugalde, a Bolivian national (49.5%); and Gonzalo Ugalde, a Bolivian national and brother of Alvaro Ugalde (0.5%).7\n\n*Id*., at \u00b6 46, n.72.\n\n12.\n\nIt is common ground between the Parties that in 2001 Quiborax made commercial arrangements with R\u00edo Grande in order to secure for itself the supply of ulexite from the Salar de Uyuni. The precise nature of those arrangements, though, is vigorously contested by the Parties and constitutes the key factual issue in dispute in this arbitration. Part and parcel of this factual issue is the role played by the third and last co-claimant in this arbitration: Non-Metallic Minerals S.A. (\"NMM\"). NMM is a corporation created under the laws of Bolivia on 25 July 2001, and has its legal domicile in La Paz. The Parties' conflicting factual accounts are recounted below.\n\n13.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, Quiborax and Allan Fosk became shareholders of NMM in 2001. Whereas in January 2001 Quiborax and R\u00edo Grande initially entered into an exclusive contract whereby R\u00edo Grande would supply ulexite to Quiborax (the \"Exclusive Supply Contract\"), this contract was soon left without effect because the Ugalde brothers offered to sell their 50% shareholding in R\u00edo Grande to Quiborax in March of that same year. Quiborax, however, was solely interested in the mining concessions, not in the shares of R\u00edo Grande. Thus, it was agreed that R\u00edo Grande would transfer its mining concessions into a new vehicle corporation of which Quiborax would become a shareholder.8\n\n*Id.*, at \u00b6\u00b6 55-62. The Claimants note that this Exclusive Supply Contract already provided (i) that Quiborax had a right of first refusal to acquire R\u00edo Grande's mining concessions should R\u00edo Grande decide to sell them, and (ii) that Quiborax had the right to purchase the mining concessions in case the Exclusive Supply Contract was breached by R\u00edo Grande.\n\n14.\n\nThe Claimants allege that the Ugalde brothers agreed to sell their 50% interest in the mining concessions to Quiborax for USD 400,000. By August 2001, Quiborax paid the full purchase price. In the meantime, on 25 July 2001, Non Metallic Minerals S.A. (\"NMM\") a new vehicle corporation was founded under Bolivian law. The original shareholders of NMM were Mr. Fernando Rojas (58 shares), Ms. Dolly Paredes (1 share) and Ms. Gilka Salas (1 share). Fernando Rojas was Quiborax's counsel in Bolivia. Dolly Paredes and Gilka Salas were members of the administrative staff of Mr. Rojas's law firm.9\n\n*Id.*, at \u00b6\u00b6 63-64.\n\n15.\n\nThe Claimants further maintain that the following transfers took place in August and September of 2001. On 3 August 2001, R\u00edo Grande transferred its mining concessions to NMM, receiving NMM shares in return (26,680 shares). On 17 August 2001, R\u00edo Grande transferred the totality of its NMM shares to Quiborax (26,680 shares). On 4 September 2001, Quiborax in turn transferred 50% of the total NMM shares to David Moscoso (13,370 shares).10 Also on 4 September 2001, following an agreement that Quiborax would be the majority shareholder of NMM, David Moscoso sold 1% of its NMM shares (267 shares) to Quiborax for USD 9,985. Finally, on 10 September 2001, Fernando Rojas and Dolly Paredes transferred their shares to Quiborax (59 shares), and Gilka Salas transferred her one share to Allan Fosk.11 As a result, according to the Claimants, the shareholders of NMM are Quiborax (50,995%), David Moscoso (49%), Allan Fosk (0,005%).12\n\nNMM issued a total of 26,740 shares: 60 original shares issued to Fernando Rojas, Dolly Paredes and Gilka Salas, and 26,680 shares issued to R\u00edo Grande following the contribution of the seven mining concessions.\n\nThe Claimants argue that this one share was transferred to Allan Fosk in order to comply with Bolivian law requirement that a corporation must have at least three shareholders.\n\nMem., \u00b6\u00b6 65-66.\n\n16.\n\nIn contrast, the Respondent contends that Quiborax and Allan Fosk *never* became shareholders of NMM. Instead, Quiborax and R\u00edo Grande had merely an exclusive distribution relationship, as reflected in the Exclusive Supply Contract. Once this dispute arose between the Claimants and the Respondent, the Claimants fabricated evidence purporting to show that Quiborax and Allan Fosk were shareholders of NMM solely to gain access to ICSID arbitration under the Chile-Bolivia BIT (the \"Treaty\"). In reality, however, the shareholders of NMM were Bolivian nationals at all relevant times.\n\n17.\n\nIn 2002 and 2003, NMM secured four additional mining concessions for a boron deposit adjacent to the original concession area. Therefore, by August 2003, NMM held eleven mining concessions in the Salar de Uyuni.13 The rate of NMM sales grew substantially between 2001 and mid-2004. On 23 June 2004, Bolivia revoked NMM's eleven mining concessions. In July 2004, the Claimants requested the initiation of friendly consultations with Bolivia under Article X of the Bolivia-Chile BIT. As these consultations did not prosper, the Claimants initiated these arbitration proceedings against Bolivia in October 2005.\n\n*Id.*, at \u00b6 76.\n\n18.\n\nIn December 2008, Bolivia initiated criminal proceedings against Allan Fosk, David Moscoso and others on the ground that the accused allegedly fabricated evidence that allowed the Claimants to establish jurisdiction in this arbitration (the \"domestic criminal case\" or the \"domestic criminal proceedings\").14 As explained in the Procedural History below, the criminal case prompted the Claimants to file a request for provisional measures and a request for a \"temporary restraining order.\" In August 2009, Mr. Moscoso pleaded guilty of the criminal charges and admitted that the minutes of 13 September 2001 were fabricated.15\n\nExh. CD-82.\n\nExh. R-76, Exh. CPM-20.\n\n**III. PROCEDURAL HISTORY**\n---------------------------\n\n**A. INITIAL PHASE**\n--------------------\n\n19.\n\nOn 4 October 2005, the Claimants filed a Notice of Arbitration with the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (\"ICSID\") pursuant to Article 36 of the ICSID Convention and the Bolivia-Chile BIT. In the Notice of Arbitration, the Claimants requested the following relief:\n\n\"a) Declare that Bolivia breached Article III of the Bolivia-Chile BIT by failing to protect the Claimants' investments on Bolivian soil;\n\nb) Declare that Bolivia breached Article III of the Bolivia-Chile BIT by adopting measures that impaired [...] Claimants' investments on Bolivian soil, and that such impairment was carried out by means of arbitrary and discriminatory measures;\n\nc) Declare that Bolivia has breached Article IV of the Bolivia-Chile BIT by failing to accord fair and equitable treatment to Claimants' investments;\n\nd) Declare that Bolivia has breached Article IV of the Bolivia-Chile BIT by directly or indirectly depriving Claimants of their investments on Bolivian soil;\n\ne) Order Bolivia to compensate the Claimants for all the damages sustained by each of them as a consequence of the violations committed by Bolivia, including payment of appropriate interests;\n\nf) Order Bolivia to bear the full costs of these arbitral proceedings, as well as all those costs that have been incurred as a result of Bolivia's violations (Tribunal's translation).\"16\n\nNoA, \u00b6 74.\n\n20.\n\nDespite the commencement of the arbitration, the Parties continued to hold settlement negotiations, without however reaching an agreement. Thus, on 21 November 2006, the Claimants appointed as arbitrator Hon. Marc Lalonde, a Canadian national. On 6 April 2007, the Respondent appointed as arbitrator Prof. Brigitte Stern, a French national. On 18 December 2007, the Chairman of the ICSID Administrative Council appointed Prof. Gabrielle Kaufmann-Kohler, a Swiss national, as President of the Tribunal, in accordance with Article 38 of the ICSID Convention. All three arbitrators accepted their appointments. Further, the Centre designated Ms. Natal\u00ed Sequeira as Secretary of the Tribunal. Thus, the Arbitral Tribunal was constituted and the proceedings commenced in late December 2007.\n\n21.\n\nOn 20 March 2008, the Tribunal and the Parties held a first procedural session at the World Bank's office in Paris. At the beginning of the first session, the Parties informed the Tribunal that they had reached a \"preliminary oral settlement agreement\"17 and that they expected to set it in writing within the next fifteen days.18 Nevertheless, the Parties decided to conduct the first session as scheduled lest a final agreement were ultimately not reached. Thus, the Parties and the Tribunal discussed and agreed on a number of procedural issues. Thereafter, the arbitration proceedings were suspended pending the conclusion of the settlement agreement between the Parties.\n\nMFS, p. 2.\n\n*Id*.\n\n22.\n\nThe Parties requested multiple time extensions to finalize the settlement agreement. Eventually, on 13 January 2009, the Claimants requested that the arbitration be resumed on the alleged ground that the Respondent's conduct was \"inconsistent\" with settlement negotiations. As a result, on 17 February 2009, the Tribunal issued the final minutes of the first session, attaching a draft timetable upon which the Parties would be able to comment. On 5 March 2009, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 1, including a final timetable of the proceedings. This timetable was amended on various occasions at the request of both Parties.\n\n**B. WRITTEN PHASE ON JURISDICTION**\n------------------------------------\n\n23.\n\nOn 14 September 2009, the Claimants filed their Memorial, enclosing ninety-nine exhibits19 and thirty-two legal exhibits.20 In the Statement of Claim, the Claimants requested the following relief:\n\n\"(1) Declaring that Bolivia violated its obligations under Article VI of the BIT by expropriating Claimants' investment in Bolivia, in an unlawful manner and not in accordance with the requirements of Article VI;\n\n(2) Declaring that Bolivia violated its obligations under Article IV of the BIT by failing to accord Claimants fair and equitable treatment, by unlawfully expropriating Claimants' investment in Bolivia;\n\n(3) Declaring that Bolivia violated its obligations under Article III of the BIT by failing to protect Claimants' investment in Bolivia [...] by unreasonable and discriminatory measures consisting of the unlawful expropriation of Claimants' investment in Bolivia;\n\n(4) Declaring that Bolivia violated its obligations under international law by aggravating the dispute between the parties, by submitting Claimants to acts of harassment intended to obstruct Claimants' rights under the BIT;\n\n(5) Declaring that Bolivia violated its obligations under Article IV of the BIT by failing to accord Claimants fair and equitable treatment, by submitting Claimants to acts of harassment intended to obstruct Claimants' rights under the BIT;\n\n(6) Declaring that Bolivia violated its obligations under Article III of the BIT by submitting Claimants to unreasonable and discriminatory measures, consisting of acts of harassment intended to obstruct Claimants' rights under the BIT;\n\n(7) Declaring that Bolivia violated its obligations under Art. 26 of the ICSID Convention by initiating parallel criminal proceedings in Bolivia;\n\n(8) Ordering Bolivia to pay Claimants full compensation in an amount not less than US$ 61,481,461 as of 1 August 2009 for damages suffered due to the loss of their investment in Bolivia, plus compound interest at the commercial rate on such amount from such date until the date of actual payment;\n\n(9) Ordering Bolivia to pay compensation in an amount not less than US$ 5,000,000 for moral damages suffered by Claimants due to the unlawful acts of harassment by Bolivia, subsequent to the loss of Claimants' investment in Bolivia;\n\n(10) Ordering Bolivia to pay all costs, fees and expenses incurred by Claimants as a result of Bolivia's violations of the BIT, including all cost, fees and expenses of these arbitration proceedings.\"21\n\nExhs. CD-1 to CD-99.\n\nExhs. CL-1 to CL-32.\n\nMem., \u00a7 X.\n\n24.\n\nTogether with the Memorial, the Claimants also submitted a request for provisional measures, asking that the Respondent refrain from engaging in any conduct that could aggravate the dispute and requesting that the Bolivian criminal proceedings be discontinued. On 2 October 2009, the Claimants requested a \"temporary restraining order\" with immediate effect, asking that the Respondent discontinue the Bolivian criminal proceedings pending the Tribunal's decision on the request for provisional measures. The Respondent opposed this request on 5 October 2009. The Tribunal denied the Claimants' request for a \"temporary restraining order.\"\n\n25.\n\nOn 13 and 29 October 2009, Bolivia filed briefs opposing the Claimants' request for provisional measures. On 21 October 2009, the Claimants submitted a second brief in support of their request for provisional measures. On 24 November 2009, the Tribunal and the Parties held a conference call to address the request for provisional measures. On 26 February 2010, the Tribunal issued its Decision on Provisional Measures, according to which the Respondent was to \"take all appropriate measures to suspend\"22 the Bolivian criminal proceedings against Allan Fosk, David Moscoso and others, and \"refrain from initiating\"23 new criminal proceedings which could \"jeopardize the procedural integrity of this arbitration.\"24\n\nDPM, p. 46\n\n*Id*.\n\n*Id*.\n\n26.\n\nOn 7 April 2010, the Respondent filed a proposal to disqualify the Tribunal (the \"Proposal\"), the effect of which was to temporarily suspend the proceedings. On 19 April 2010, the Claimants submitted observations opposing the Respondent's Proposal. Each Party then presented an additional brief in support of its position. On 6 July 2010, the Secretary-General of ICSID dismissed the Respondent's Proposal. The proceedings resumed shortly thereafter and the procedural calendar was amended accordingly.\n\n27.\n\nOn 12 July 2010, the Respondent informed that it would file objections to the jurisdiction of the Tribunal by no later than 30 July 2010. At the same time, the Respondent requested an order from the Tribunal directing the Claimants to produce the documents identified in the Redfern schedule dated 28 May 2010. On 19 July 2010, the Claimants presented objections to the Respondent's requests for document production. On 26 July 2010, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 2, partially granting the Respondent's requests for document production, as specified in the Redfern schedule attached to the order.\n\n28.\n\nOn 30 July 2010, the Respondent filed Objections to the Jurisdiction of the Tribunal, together with ninety-eight exhibits25 and the expert report of Prof. Iv\u00e1n Salame. In the Objections to Jurisdiction, the Respondent requested that the Tribunal:\n\n\"a. Declare that it has no *ratione personae* jurisdiction over the Claimants;\n\nb. Declare that it has no *ratione materiae* jurisdiction over the claims brought by the Claimants;\n\nc. Declare that Claimants' claims are inadmissible;\n\nd. Order, in any event, the Claimants to fully reimburse the State for the costs it has incurred in the defense of its interests in the present arbitration, together with interests at a commercially reasonable rate in the view of the Tribunal, from the time the State incurred those costs until the time of effective payment (Tribunal's translation).\"26\n\nExhs. R-84 to R-181.\n\nOJ, \u00b6 274.\n\n29.\n\nOn 29 October 2010, the Claimants submitted a Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, enclosing forty-two exhibits27, eleven legal exhibits28, the expert report of Carlos Rosenkrantz, and the report of Juan Pablo de Luca. In the Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, the Claimants requested that the Tribunal:\n\n\"(1) Dismiss the Respondent's Objections to Jurisdiction;\n\n(2) Declare it has jurisdiction to hear Claimants' claims;\n\n(3) Proceed to the merits phase of the proceeding;\n\n(4) Order the Respondent to pay all costs, fees and expenses incurred by Claimants as a result of the Respondent's presentation of Objections to Jurisdiction.\"29\n\nExhs. CD-100 to CD-141.\n\nExhs. CL-33 to CL-43.\n\nCM, \u00a7 IX.\n\n30.\n\nOn 13 January 2011, the Respondent submitted its Reply on Jurisdiction, together with thirty-five exhibits30 and the second expert report of Prof. Iv\u00e1n Salame. In the Reply on Jurisdiction, the Respondent reiterated the requests made in the Objections to Jurisdiction, and requested in addition that the Tribunal \"declare inadmissible the De Luca Report\" and \"order the Claimants to submit the original share certificates of NMM in order that they may be inspected by an expert, under the supervision of the Tribunal, for purposes of determining their authenticity and date.\"31\n\nExhs. R-182 to R-216.\n\nReply, \u00b6 259 (Tribunal's translation).\n\n31.\n\nIn the Reply on Jurisdiction and a letter of 4 February 2011, the Respondent requested the Claimants to produce the original share certificates Nos. 1 to 11 of Non Metallic Minerals S.A. (the \"original share certificates\") for inspection by an expert under the supervision of the Tribunal in order to determine their authenticity and date. On 25 January 2011, the Claimants objected to the Respondent's request for document inspection, but stated that they would make the original share certificates available if the Tribunal deemed it necessary.\n\n32.\n\nOn 8 February 2011, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 3, granting Respondent's request for document inspection and ordering the Claimants to make the original share certificates available for inspection. Since the Parties failed to agree on the practicalities of the inspection, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 4 on 10 March 2011, providing specific directions on the time, place and logistics of the inspection and setting a timetable for the submission of expert reports. In accordance with this timetable, the Respondent submitted its expert report on the document inspection on 8 April 2011 and the Claimants on 22 April 2011.\n\n33.\n\nOn 1 April 2011, the Claimants filed their Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, together with eighteen exhibits32, five legal exhibits33, the second expert report of Carlos Rosenkrantz, and the second report of Juan Pablo de Luca. In the Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, the Claimants reiterated the requests made in the Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, and requested in addition that the Tribunal \"[r]eject the Respondent's request to declare the De Luca Report inadmissible.\"34\n\nExhs. CD-142 to CD-159.\n\nExhs. CL-44 to CL-48.\n\nRej., \u00a7 XI, p. 99.\n\n34.\n\nOn 12 April 2011, the Tribunal and the Parties held an audio-recorded, pre-hearing conference call. Two days later, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 5, containing directions for the hearing. By letter of 15 April 2011, the Respondent made a request to cross-examine Mr. Allan Fosk and Mr. Ricardo Ramos at the hearing on jurisdiction. By letter of 19 April 2011, the Claimants opposed Respondent's request. In Procedural Order No. 6, the Tribunal declared, *inter alia*, the admissibility of the De Luca Report, granted the Respondent's request to cross-examine Mr. Allan Fosk and reserved its decision on the admissibility of Mr. Ramos's witness statement. As stated in that order, the Tribunal does not consider that Mr. Ramos's evidence is relevant for purposes of jurisdiction and will thus not rely on it in this decision; at the same time, it does not perceive any good reason to declare the witness statement of Mr. Ramos inadmissible should this arbitration proceed to the merits phase. In Procedural Order No. 7, the Tribunal issued hearing directions on pending procedural logistical matters.\n\n**C. HEARING ON JURISDICTION**\n------------------------------\n\n35.\n\nOn 12-13 May 2011, the Arbitral Tribunal held a hearing on jurisdiction in Paris. In attendance at the hearing were the members of the Arbitral Tribunal, the Secretary and the Assistant, and the following party representatives, witnesses and experts:\n\n(i) On behalf of the Claimants\n\n\u2022 Mr. Andr\u00e9s Jana, Bofill Mir & Alvarez Jana\n\n\u2022 Mr. Jorge Bofill, Bofill Mir & Alvarez Jana\n\n\u2022 Ms. Johanna Klein Kranenberg, Bofill Mir & Alvarez Jana\n\n\u2022 Mr. Rodrigo Gil, Bofill Mir & Alvarez Jana\n\n\u2022 Ms. Ximena Fuentes, Bofill Mir & Alvarez Jana\n\n\u2022 Ms. Constanza Onetto, Bofill Mir & Alvarez Jana Claimant's Witness:\n\n\u2022 Mr. Allan Henry Isaac Fosk Kapl\u00fan\n\nClaimant\u2019s Experts:\n\n\u2022 Mr. Albert Lyter III\n\n\u2022 Mr. Carlos Rosencrantz\n\n(ii) On behalf of the Respondent\n\n\u2022 Mr. Hugo Montero Lara, Attorney General of the State\n\n\u2022 Ms. Elizabeth Arismendi Chumacero, Deputy Attorney General of Legal Defense and Representation of the State\n\n\u2022 Mr. Danny Javier L\u00f3pez Soliz, General Director of the Jurisdictional and Arbitral Defense of Investments (Attorney General's Office)\n\n\u2022 Mr. Pierre Mayer, Dechert (Paris) LLP\n\n\u2022 Mr. Eduardo Silva Romero, Dechert (Paris) LLP\n\n\u2022 Mr. Jos\u00e9 Manuel Garc\u00eda Represa, Dechert (Paris) LLP\n\n\u2022 Ms. Ana Carolina Sim\u00f6es E Silva, Dechert (Paris) LLP\n\n\u2022 Mr. Francisco Paredes-Balladares, Dechert (Paris) LLP\n\n\u2022 Ms. Anna Vald\u00e9s Pascal, Dechert (Paris) LLP\n\n\u2022 Mr. Pac\u00f4me Ziegler, Dechert (Paris) LLP\n\nRespondent\u2019s Expert:\n\n\u2022 Mr. Iv\u00e1n Salame Gonz\u00e1lez-Aramayo\n\n36.\n\nMr. Andr\u00e9s Jana and Ms. Johanna Klein Kranenberg presented oral arguments on behalf of the Claimants; Mr. Hugo Montero Lara, Prof. Pierre Mayer, Mr. Eduardo Silva Romero and Mr. Jos\u00e9 Manuel Garc\u00eda Represa, in turn, presented oral arguments on behalf of the Respondent.\n\n37.\n\nThe hearing was sound and video recorded. A *verbatim* transcript of the hearing on jurisdiction was produced and subsequently distributed to the Parties. After the hearing, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 8, confirming, as discussed at the end of the hearing, that there would be no post-hearing briefs and setting a calendar for the filing of submissions regarding the Claimants' request that the Tribunal issue a declaration pursuant to Article 37 of the Articles on State Responsibility. The Claimants filed these submissions on 27 May 2011, and the Respondent filed its reply on 10 June 2011.\n\n38.\n\nThe Tribunal, having deliberated and carefully considered the arguments presented by the Parties in their written and oral submissions, renders the present decision on jurisdiction. The Tribunal will first briefly summarize the positions of the Parties (Section IV), then analyze the arguments in support of those positions (Section V), and finally render a decision on jurisdiction (Section VI).\n\n**IV. POSITIONS OF THE PARTIES**\n--------------------------------\n\n**A. THE RESPONDENT'S POSITION**\n--------------------------------\n\n39.\n\nIn its written and oral submissions, Bolivia has raised the following objections:\n\n(i) The Claimants are not \"investors\" within the meaning of the Treaty. The Claimants have committed a serious breach of the principle of good faith by fabricating evidence showing that Quiborax and Allan Fosk are shareholders of NMM for the sole purpose of gaining access to ICSID arbitration.\n\n(ii) The Claimants did not make an \"investment\" within the meaning of Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention because the Claimants (a) made no contribution in the territory of Bolivia, and (b) the alleged investment has not contributed to the economic development of the area.\n\n(iii) In the alternative, the Claimants' alleged investment was made in breach of Bolivian laws and regulations.\n\n(iv) In the further alternative, Claimants' claims are inadmissible because Quiborax and Allan Fosk concealed their participation in NMM, thereby committing an abuse of nationality contrary to the principle of good faith.\n\n40.\n\nFor these reasons, Bolivia requests that the Tribunal:\n\n\"a. Declare that it has no *ratione personae* jurisdiction over the Claimants;\n\nb. Declare that it has no *ratione materiae* jurisdiction over the claims brought by the Claimants;\n\nc. Declare that Claimants' claims are inadmissible;\n\nd. In any event, order the Claimants to fully reimburse the State for the costs it has incurred in the defense of its interests in the present arbitration, together with interests at a commercially reasonable rate in the view of the Tribunal, from the time the State incurred those costs until the time of effective payment.\"35\n\nOJ, \u00b6 274 (Tribunal's translation).\n\n**B. THE CLAIMANTS' POSITION**\n------------------------------\n\n41.\n\nIn their written and oral submissions, the Claimants have replied to Bolivia's objections as follows:\n\n(i) All three Claimants are \"investors\" within the meaning of the Treaty.\n\n(ii) The Claimants acted at all times in good faith and did not fabricate evidence showing that Quiborax and Allan Fosk were shareholders of NMM in order to gain access to ICSID arbitration.\n\n(iii) The Claimants made an \"investment\" in Bolivia, consisting of shares and eleven mining concessions in the R\u00edo Grande area, within the meaning of the Treaty and the ICSID Convention.\n\n(iv) The Claimants' investment was made \"in accordance with the laws of the host State\" as required by the Treaty.\n\n(v) Quiborax and Allan Fosk did not conceal their condition of shareholders in NMM prior to Respondent's expropriation.\n\n(vi) The Respondent's objections to jurisdiction constitute an abuse of process and must be declared inadmissible.\n\n42.\n\nFor these reasons, the Claimants request the Tribunal to:\n\n\"(1) Dismiss the Respondent's Objections to Jurisdiction;\n\n(2) Declare it has jurisdiction to hear Claimants' claims;\n\n(3) Proceed to the merits phase of the proceeding;\n\n(4) Order the Respondent to pay all costs, fees and expenses incurred by Claimants as a result of the Respondent's presentation of Objections to Jurisdiction.\"36\n\nCM, \u00a7 IX.\n\n43.\n\nThe Tribunal will expand on the Parties' positions and arguments in the course of its analysis.\n\n**V. ANALYSIS**\n---------------\n\n**A. THRESHOLD MATTERS**\n------------------------\n\n44.\n\nPrior to entering the merits of the Parties' positions, the Tribunal will address the following threshold matters: the relevance of previous decisions or awards (1); the law applicable to the jurisdiction of the Tribunal (2); matters that are undisputed by the Parties (3); and the test for establishing jurisdiction (4).\n\n**1. The Relevance of Previous Decisions or Awards**\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n45.\n\nBoth Parties have relied on previous decisions or awards in support of their positions, either to conclude that the same solution should be adopted in the present case, or in an effort to explain why this Tribunal should depart from that solution.\n\n46.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that it is not bound by previous decisions.37 At the same time, it is of the opinion that it must pay due consideration to earlier decisions of international tribunals. Specifically, it deems that, subject to compelling contrary grounds, it has a duty to adopt solutions established in a series of consistent cases. It further deems that, subject to the specifics of the Treaty and of the circumstances of the actual case, it has a duty to contribute to the harmonious development of investment law, with a view to meeting the legitimate expectations of the community of States and investors towards the certainty of the rule of law. Arbitrator Stern does not analyze the arbitrator's role in the same manner, as she considers it her duty to decide each case on its own merits, independently of any apparent jurisprudential trend.\n\n*See e.g.*, *Saipem S.p.A. v. the People's Republic of Bangladesh* (hereafter \" *Saipem* \"), Decision on Jurisdiction and Recommendation on Provisional Measures, 21 March 2007, \u00b6 67; *AES Corporation v. Argentine Republic* (hereafter \" *AES* \"), Decision on Jurisdiction, 13 July 2005, \u00b6 30-32.\n\n**2. Law Applicable to the Jurisdiction of the Tribunal**\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n47.\n\nBoth Parties agree, and rightly so, that the Tribunal's jurisdiction is governed by the ICSID Convention, by the Bolivia-Chile BIT (the \"Treaty\" or the \"BIT\") and, to the extent the latter refers to it, by Bolivian law. It is equally common ground between the Parties that the interpretation of both the ICSID Convention and the Treaty is governed by customary international law as codified by the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties. The relevant provisions of the ICSID Convention and the BIT are quoted below.\n\n48.\n\nJurisdiction under the ICSID Convention is governed by Article 25(1), which reads as follows:\n\n\"The jurisdiction of the Centre shall extend to any legal dispute arising directly out of an investment between a Contracting State (or any constituent subdivision or agency of a Contracting State designated to the Centre by that State) and a national of another Contracting State, which the parties to the dispute consent in writing to submit to the Centre. When the parties have given their consent, no party may withdraw its consent unilaterally.\"\n\n49.\n\nIn accordance with the terms of Article II of the Bolivia-Chile BIT, the dispute must fall within the Treaty's scope of application, *ratione personae*, *ratione materiae* and *ratione temporis* :\n\n\"The present Agreement shall apply to investments made before and after its entry into force by investors of a Contracting Party, in accordance with the legal provisions of the other Contracting Party, in the territory of the latter. However, it shall not apply to disputes or controversies that would have arisen before its entry into force.\"38\n\nExh. CL-1 (Tribunal's translation).\n\n50.\n\nIn the event that a dispute arises between a Contracting Party and an investor of the other Contracting Party, Article X provides for the following dispute settlement mechanism:\n\n\"1. Disputes arising within the scope of this Treaty between one of the Contracting Parties and an investor of the other Contracting Party who has made investments in the territory of the former shall, to the extent possible, be settled through friendly consultations.\n\n2. If a solution was not reached through those consultations within a period of six months from the date when the request for settlement was made, the investor may submit the dispute:\n\na) to the competent court of the Contracting Party on whose territory the investment was made; or\n\nb) to international arbitration under the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID), created by the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of other States, signed in Washington on 18 March 1965.\"39\n\n*Id*. (Tribunal's translation). The original in Spanish reads as follows:  \n \"1. Las controversias que surjan en el \u00e1mbito de este Acuerdo, entre una de las Partes Contratantes y un inversionista de la otra Parte Contratante que haya realizado inversiones en el territorio de la primera, ser\u00e1n, en la medida de lo posible, solucionadas por medio de consultas amistosas.  \n 2. Si mediante dichas consultas no se llegare a una soluci\u00f3n dentro del plazo de seis meses a contar de la fecha de solicitud de arreglo, el inversionista podr\u00e1 remitir la controversia:  \n (a) al tribunal competente de la Parte Contratante en cuyo territorio se efectu\u00f3 la inversi\u00f3n; o  \n (b) a arbitraje internacional del Centro Internacional de Arreglo de Diferencias Relativas a Inversiones (CIADI), creado por la Convenci\u00f3n para el Arreglo de Diferencias Relativas a Inversiones entre Estados y Nacionales de otros Estados, firmada en Washington el 18 de marzo de 1965.\"\n\n51.\n\nUnder Article I(2) of the Bolivia-Chile BIT, \"investment\" is defined as \"any kind of assets or rights related to as \"investment\" made in accordance with the \"laws and regulations\" of the host State, which includes shares in corporations:\n\n\"For purposes of this Agreement:\n\n[...]\n\n2. The term \"investment\" means any kind of assets or rights related to an investment as long as this has been made in accordance with the laws and regulations of the Contracting Party in whose territory the investment was made, and shall comprise in particular, albeit not exclusively:\n\n[....]\n\nb) Shares, debentures, and any other kind of participation in corporations\" (emphasis added).\"40\n\n*Id.* (Tribunal's translation).\n\n52.\n\nTherefore, Bolivian law applies to determine (i) whether Quiborax and Allan Fosk were shareholders of NMM at the time the dispute arose in June 2004, and (ii) whether the Claimants' purported investment was made \"in accordance with the laws and regulations\" and the \"legal provisions\" of Bolivia (henceforth, \"in accordance with Bolivian law\" or \"the legality requirement\"). Both Parties agree that these issues are governed by Bolivian law.41\n\nOJ, \u00b6 58; CM, \u00a7 II(2).\n\n**3. Undisputed Facts**\n-----------------------\n\n53.\n\nThe following facts are undisputed: (i) NMM was constituted under Bolivian law42; (ii) R\u00edo Grande contributed seven mining concessions to NMM and became the majority shareholder of NMM43; (iii) NMM subsequently acquired four additional mining concessions.44\n\n*Id.*, at \u00b6 6; CM, \u00b6 34.\n\n*Id.*, at \u00b6 6; CM, \u00b6\u00b6 40-43.\n\n*Id.*, at \u00b6 6; Rej., \u00b6\u00b6 2, 78, 187.\n\n**4. Test for Establishing Jurisdiction**\n-----------------------------------------\n\n54.\n\nAt the jurisdictional stage, the Claimants must establish (i) that the jurisdictional requirements of Article 25 of the ICSID Convention and of the Treaty are met, which includes proving the facts necessary to meet these requirements, and (ii) that they have a *prima facie* cause of action under the Treaty, that is, that the facts they allege are susceptible of constituting a breach of the Treaty *if* they are ultimately proven.45 The Tribunal finds that this test strikes a proper balance between a more exacting standard which would call for examination of the merits at the jurisdictional stage, and a less exacting standard which would confer excessive weight to the Claimants' own characterization of their claims.\n\nOn the *prima facie* test of treaty breach for purposes of jurisdiction, *see* among others *United Parcel Services (UPS) v. Government of Canada*, UNCITRAL (NAFTA), Award on Jurisdiction, 22 November 2002 **,** \u00b6\u00b6 33-37; *Siemens v. Argentine Republic*, Decision on Jurisdiction, 3 August 2004, \u00b6 180; *Plama Consortium Limited v.

ADMISSIBILITY OF THE OBJECTIONS TO JURISDICTION AND EVIDENCE**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**1. The Claimants' Position**\n------------------------------\n\n55.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, the Tribunal must declare the objections to jurisdiction inadmissible on account of Respondent's conduct in this arbitration. In addition, the Tribunal must declare the inadmissibility of any evidence obtained in violation of international law, *i.e.* through the conviction of David Moscoso. This is because Respondent's objections to jurisdiction constitute an abuse of process, and because Respondent should not be able to profit from its own wrongful conduct (*nemo auditur propriam turpitudinem allegans*). The Tribunal has the inherent power to dismiss Respondent's objections in order to preserve the integrity of the proceedings.46\n\nCM, \u00b6\u00b6 199, 218, 222-223; Rej., \u00a7 IX.\n\n56.\n\nFirst, the Respondent created a case on jurisdiction. Second, it has harmed the integrity of this arbitration by initiating criminal proceedings against persons involved in this matter. As a result, key fact witnesses for the Claimants are unwilling to testify, and no Bolivian attorney is willing to give evidence on behalf of the Claimants. Third, in continuing to pursue the criminal claims despite the Tribunal's Decision on Provisional Measures, the Respondent has breached international law. Fourth, the Respondent, whilst availing itself of different procedural opportunities, has failed to pay its share of the advance on costs, in an effort to discourage the Claimants from pursuing this arbitration. For these reasons, the Respondent has forfeited its right to object to the Tribunal's jurisdiction.47\n\nCM, \u00b6\u00b6 200-221; Rej., \u00b6\u00b6 244-255.\n\n**2. Bolivia's Position**\n-------------------------\n\n57.\n\nAccording to Bolivia, the Claimants' request that its objections to jurisdiction be dismissed without consideration is stunning and preposterous for the following five reasons.48\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 247-250.\n\n58.\n\nFirst, the Respondent's objections are sound in fact and in law. Second, the Claimants have failed to explain why the Respondent's pursuance of the criminal case in Bolivia and its failure to comply with the recommended provisional measures should result in the forfeiture of its right to present objections to jurisdiction. Third, the *KompetenzKompetenz* principle prevails over any inherent power of the Tribunal to dismiss a party's objection to jurisdiction when such party commits an abuse of process. In any event, the Respondent committed no abuse of process.49\n\n*Id.*, at \u00b6\u00b6 251-253.\n\n59.\n\nFourth, the Claimants' reliance on the *nemo auditur* principle is inapposite as the Respondent's right to object to the jurisdiction of the Tribunal arises from the Treaty. Fifth, evidence arising from the Bolivian criminal proceedings, on which the Claimants themselves rely, should not be declared inadmissible. Disregarding this evidence would not only constitute a misapplication of the *nemo auditur* principle, but would also be contrary to the principle that the Tribunal has full discretion to assess the evidence under Arbitration Rule 34(1). The real purpose of this request is to confer jurisdiction where there is none.50\n\n*Id.*, at \u00b6\u00b6 254-258.\n\n**3. Analysis**\n---------------\n\n3.1. Admissibility of jurisdictional objections\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n60.\n\nThe Claimants request that the Respondent's objections to jurisdiction be declared inadmissible, as the Respondent has forfeited its right to object to jurisdiction through its conduct in the arbitration. The Respondent opposes this request.\n\n61.\n\nJurisdiction in ICSID treaty arbitration depends on a number of objective requirements (nationality, legal dispute, investment) which are set forth in Article 25 of the ICSID Convention and in the relevant BIT and on one subjective requirement, consent, which is required under Article 25(1) and generally given by the State in the BIT and by the investor through filing a request for arbitration.\n\n62.\n\nArticle 41(1) of the ICSID Convention provides that \"[t]he Tribunal shall be the judge of its own competence.\" In other words, it is up to the Tribunal to determine whether the jurisdictional requirements set in the treaties are met or not.\n\n63.\n\nThis is an expression of the well-established principle of *Kompetenz-Kompetenz*.51 That principle implies the power to rule on one's jurisdiction as well as the duty to do so. As a consequence, the Tribunal cannot abdicate the task of ascertaining whether the jurisdictional requirements are met.\n\n*Sociedad An\u00f3nima Eduardo Viera v. Republic of Chile,* (hereafter *\"Pey\"*), Award, 21 August 2007, \u00b6 203 (Tribunal's translation).\n\n64.\n\nThe Claimants rely on the International Court of Justice's (\"ICJ\") judgment in the *Nuclear Tests* case to argue that the Tribunal has the inherent power to preserve the integrity of the proceedings.52 That is certainly right. Yet, the ICJ expressly stated that the purpose of this inherent power was to \"ensure that the exercise of its jurisdiction, *if and when established*, shall not be frustrated\"53 (emphasis added). In other words, such inherent power does not allow a tribunal to dispense with establishing whether it has jurisdiction. This confirms this Tribunal's duty to review whether the treaty requirements for jurisdiction are met, irrespective of the procedural conduct of the Respondent. Thus, the Tribunal cannot but deny the Claimants' request that the Respondent's objections to jurisdiction be declared inadmissible.\n\n*Nuclear Tests case (New Zealand v. France)*, 15 June 1962, ICJ Reports 1974, p. 457.\n\n*Id*.\n\n3.2. Admissibility of evidence\n------------------------------\n\n65.\n\nThe Parties also disagree on whether evidence emanating from the Bolivian criminal proceedings should be admitted or not. The Claimants request that evidence arising from the Bolivian criminal proceedings be declared inadmissible. The Respondent opposes this request.\n\n66.\n\nArbitration Rule 34(1) reads as follows:\n\n\"The Tribunal shall be the judge of the admissibility of any evidence adduced and of its probative value.\"\n\n67.\n\nUnder this Rule, the Tribunal has ample discretion to rule on the admissibility of any evidence adduced. The Tribunal does not consider that declaring the evidence gathered in the Bolivian proceedings admissible would give the Respondent an undue advantage. Neither does it believe that admitting this evidence would harm the integrity of this arbitration. If and when it will have to consider any such evidence, the Tribunal will weigh its probative value taking into account other evidences on record as well as the circumstances surrounding this very evidence. In the exercise of its discretion under Arbitration Rule 34(I), it will then give this evidence more or less weight, or no weight at all.\n\n68.\n\nTherefore, the Tribunal concludes that the evidence from the Bolivian proceedings is admissible, being specified that its probative value will be addressed if and when necessary for the resolution of the issues before the Tribunal.\n\n**C. OBJECTIONS TO JURISDICTION**\n---------------------------------\n\n69.\n\nBolivia objects to the jurisdiction of the Tribunal on the following three grounds:\n\n(i) The Tribunal lacks *ratione personae* jurisdiction over the Claimants;\n\n(ii) The Tribunal lacks *ratione materiae* jurisdiction over the dispute;\n\n(iii) In the alternative, the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction because the Claimants' alleged investment was made in breach of Bolivian laws and regulations.\n\n70.\n\nThere is no dispute between the Parties regarding the other requirements for jurisdiction under the ICSID Convention and the BIT. Specifically, it is not disputed that Bolivia was an ICSID Contracting State at the relevant time, that Quiborax and Allan Fosk are nationals of Chile - another ICSID Contracting State - and that there is a legal dispute. Likewise, there is no dispute that Bolivia consented to submit to arbitration disputes falling within the framework of application of the BIT. The Tribunal agrees that these requirements are met, and will next examine those requirements which are disputed.\n\n**1. First Objection: The Tribunal Lacks** ***Ratione Personae*** **Jurisdiction Over the Claimants**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1.1. Bolivia's Position\n-----------------------\n\n71.\n\nBolivia contends that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction because Quiborax and Allan Fosk are not \"investors\" and NMM is not a Chilean national within the meaning of the Treaty. At the time the dispute arose in June 2004, Quiborax and Allan Fosk were not shareholders of NMM54, and NMM, not being under the control of Chilean investors, was accordingly not a Chilean national under the ICSID Convention and the Treaty.55 Hence, the Tribunal lacks *ratione personae* jurisdiction over Quiborax, Allan Fosk, and NMM.\n\nOJ, \u00b6 14.\n\n*Id.*, at \u00b6 19.\n\n72.\n\nIn actuality, the Claimants have fabricated evidence in order to create the impression that NMM was under the control of Chilean nationals Quiborax and Allan Fosk. In so doing, the Claimants have unduly sought to avail themselves of the Bolivia-Chile BIT. This improper conduct constitutes a serious breach of the principle of good faith.56\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 133-136.\n\n73.\n\nThe facts and documents preceding the revocation of the mining concessions show that Quiborax and Allan Fosk were *not* shareholders of NMM at the time the dispute arose in June 2004 (1.1.1 below). The only documents submitted by the Claimants showing that Quiborax and Allan Fosk were shareholders of NMM are post-June 2004 internal documents without any probative value (1.1.2 below).57\n\nOJ, \u00b6\u00b6 27-29.\n\n1.1.1. The facts and documents preceding the revocation of the mining concessions show that Quiborax and Allan Fosk were not shareholders of NMM\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n74.\n\nThe Claimants' account of how Quiborax and Allan Fosk became shareholders of NMM lacks credibility and logic. On the same date, Quiborax sold to and bought from David Moscoso 267 NMM shares and David Moscoso would have paid USD 9,985 for 267 NMM shares, the same price Allan Fosk would have paid for only one share of NMM.58\n\n*Id.*, at \u00b6 33.\n\n75.\n\nAlthough the Claimants bear the burden of proof, they have submitted no evidence predating the dispute to show that Quiborax and Allan Fosk acquired shares of NMM in August and September 2001.59 They have failed to submit the most elemental proof of their allegations, such as the contract/s for the purchase and proof of payment of the shares.60\n\n*Id.*, at \u00b6\u00b6 39-46.\n\n*Id.*, at \u00b6\u00b6 47-57.\n\n76.\n\nThe Claimants' account of events lacks evidentiary support. The transfer of the shares must have left some physical trace, *i.e.* an endorsement of the original share certificates and explanatory entries in the shareholders registry or a contract for the sale of shares. Further, in order for Quiborax to have validly acquired shares of NMM, the power of attorney of the agent acting on its behalf should have been registered in the Commercial Register. However, there is no evidence that Quiborax registered any power of attorney. Moreover, the bylaws of NMM require that the shares be offered to its own shareholders before they are offered to third parties. There is no evidence on record that this procedure was followed. There is no evidence either that Quiborax and Allan Fosk filed tax returns or made tax payments, which they should have done if they had received dividends from NMM. What is more, the 2003 balance sheet of R\u00edo Grande, which was filed with the Commercial Register, shows that R\u00edo Grande was still the owner of NMM's shares.61 Lastly, if, as it appears, R\u00edo Grande transferred its NMM shares to Quiborax for free, there should be evidence of payment of the tax on gratuitous transfers.62 There are no such records. Similarly, if this transfer entailed most of R\u00edo Grande's capital, R\u00edo Grande's capital reduction should have been recorded in the Commercial Register. However, there is no record of any such registration.63\n\n*Id.*, at \u00b6\u00b6 58-70; Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 48-49.\n\nReply, \u00b6 206; Tr. 67:16:68:14.\n\nReply, \u00b6 49.\n\n77.\n\nIn contrast, the documents that do exist and predate the dispute show that Quiborax and Allan Fosk did not acquire shares of NMM in August and September 2001. R\u00edo Grande could not have transferred to Quiborax shares of NMM on 17 August 2001, because on that date R\u00edo Grande did not own any shares of NMM. Under Bolivian law, a corporation increases its capital by issuing new shares only after obtaining approval from the Commercial Register. In this case, the Commercial Register approved NMM's capital increase only on 28 August 2001 *-* 11 days *after* R\u00edo Grande's alleged transfer of NMM shares to Quiborax. And *before* the Commercial Registry's approval, R\u00edo Grande should have entered the transfer of its seven mining concessions to NMM in the Mining Register and in the Real Property Register, which was not done until December 2001. In sum, Quiborax could not have acquired shares of NMM from R\u00edo Grande on 17 August 2001.64\n\nOJ, \u00b6\u00b6 73-83; Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 43-45.\n\n78.\n\nIn addition, NMM's bylaws prohibited the sale of shares to a competing company such as Quiborax. Therefore, Quiborax could not acquire NMM shares without breaching NMM's bylaws. Further, the 2001 balance sheet of NMM and the 2003 balance sheet of R\u00edo Grande show that the shareholders of NMM were exclusively Bolivian - and that R\u00edo Grande was one of them. Similarly, the powers of attorney to represent NMM, which were registered in the Commercial Register, show that the shareholders of NMM were exclusively Bolivian and that one of them was R\u00edo Grande.65\n\nOJ, \u00b6\u00b6 84-98; Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 39-42, 46-47.\n\n1.1.2. The internal documents submitted by the Claimants to show that Quiborax and Allan Fosk were shareholders of NMM have no probative value\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n79.\n\nBolivia first notes that Claimants acted in bad faith in producing evidence of their alleged \"investment\" in a piecemeal and fragmented fashion. In any event, attaching probative value to these internal documents, composed of simple private documents, would violate the principle according to which no party may procure its own evidence. The Claimants in this case have failed to produce the key document on which its entire case is based: the contract for the sale of shares between R\u00edo Grande and Quiborax.66\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 72-78.\n\n80.\n\nThe existence of the internal documents on which the Claimants rely became apparent only after the dispute arose in June 2004. Only on 22 July 2004 did Bolivia learn, for the first time and to its great surprise, that NMM would have Chilean shareholders. On 13 August 2004, Bolivia requested Allan Fosk to provide evidence that Quiborax and Allan Fosk himself were shareholders of NMM. As Allan Fosk's response was insufficient, Bolivia decided to look into the matter.67\n\nOJ, \u00b6\u00b6 105-119.\n\n81.\n\nThe Claimants rely on three types of internal documents, all of which fail to support the Claimants' allegations: (i) the shareholders registry, (ii) the share certificates of NMM, and (iii) the minutes of the shareholders' meetings of 17 August and 13 September 2001.\n\n82.\n\nIn the first place, the Claimants allege that shareholder status is to be proven exclusively by reference to the shareholders registry. For the Respondent, this proposition is untenable as a matter of Bolivian law. As Prof. Salame notes, the shareholders registry merely creates a presumption of shareholder status, which may be rebutted by any evidence that shows who the real shareholders are.68 This is consistent with previous ICSID decisions, which take into account various elements of proof when it comes to determining shareholder status. In the case of nominative or registered shares - which is the case of NMM's shares - the appropriate proof is proof of purchase by endorsement and proof of payment.69\n\nThis is why Bolivia argues that the conclusions that *Superintendencia* reached in February 2005 are to be disregarded: the *Superintendencia* only took into account the shareholders registry.\n\nOJ, \u00b6\u00b6 120-123, 127-128.\n\n83.\n\nNMM's shareholders registry presents multiple irregularities: (i) there are blank spaces, which are proscribed; (ii) information is missing, *e.g.* regarding the issuance of new shares; and (iii) there are inconsistencies in the manner in which the transfer of shares is reported.70\n\n*Id.*, at \u00b6 124.\n\n84.\n\nContrary to what the Claimants argue, registration in the shareholders registry is not the essential prerequisite to acquire shareholder status. In so arguing, the Claimants improperly rely on Article 251 of the Commercial Code, which governs the relationship between the corporation and its shareholders, when they should rely on Article 254 of the Commercial Code, which governs the relationship between shareholders and third parties. Under Article 254 of the Commercial Code, the prerequisite to become a shareholder is the transfer of the shares by endorsement. The shareholders registry only serves to give notice of that status to third parties.71\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 87-96.\n\n85.\n\nMoreover, the Claimants confuse the *legal effects* of the registration in the shareholders registry with the issue of its *probative value*. Even assuming for a moment that registration in the shareholders registry were the essential prerequisite to become shareholder, this would not mean that such registration would constitute irrebuttable proof of shareholder status. Otherwise the holder of the shareholders registry would turn into a notary public. Moreover, such irrebuttable presumption would facilitate fraud by denying any value to other evidence which would indicate that fraud is afoot. It would be contrary to the Tribunal's power to assess the evidence under Arbitration Rule 34. It would equally go against Bolivian law for which the shareholders registry does not constitute irrebuttable evidence of shareholder status, being noted that on this point Bolivian law is in accord with the laws of other countries such as Spain, England, and Argentina. Finally, the Respondent's interpretation would not jeopardize the certainty of legal transactions.72\n\n*Id.*, at \u00b6\u00b6 82, 85; \u00b6\u00b6 97-111.\n\n86.\n\nIn the second place, the share certificates produced by the Claimants have scant, if any, probative value for the following seven reasons. First, it is remarkable that the share certificates were newly issued when they could have been transferred simply by endorsement, and that share certificates 1-7 are missing.73 Second, there is no evidence that the share certificates existed before the dispute arose. Indeed, share certificates 1-7 were first produced after the dispute had arisen. Third, these are merely internal documents. Fourth, the documents produced are not the originals.74 Fifth, it is absurd that share certificates 1-5 were transferred by endorsement, and then were, on the same day, voided and reissued. Sixth, the sequence of transactions between Quiborax and David Moscoso is equally absurd: Quiborax transferred to David Moscoso two different batches of NMM shares (one of 267 shares and another of 13,103 shares); and whereas David Moscoso did not pay anything for these shares, he received USD 9,985 when he returned the batch of 267 shares to Quiborax on the same date. Seventh and last, Dolly Paredes' signature on these certificates is different from her signature on other documents.75\n\nIt should be noted that the Respondent made this argument in the Objections to Jurisdiction, at a time when the Claimants had only produced copies of share certificates Nos. 8-11. Subsequently, however, the Claimants did produce share certificates Nos. 1-3, 5 and 7. Therefore, this argument appears to be moot except for share certificates Nos. 4 and 6.\n\nThe Claimants did produce the original of the share certificates, except for share certificates Nos. 4 and 6. These originals were the subject of a document inspection in Paris, following which each Party submitted expert reports (Mr. Lyter, on behalf of the Claimants, and Mr. Cl\u00e9ment, on behalf of the Respondent). Thus, except for share certificates Nos. 4 and 6, this argument appears to be moot.\n\nOJ, \u00b6\u00b6 129-135; Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 112-122.\n\n87.\n\nIn the third place, the minutes of the shareholders' meetings of 17 August and 13 September 2001 were forged. By 17 August 2001, NMM had not yet requested the approval to increase its capital from the Commercial Register. Therefore, R\u00edo Grande could not have participated in a shareholders' meeting of NMM, and the sale of NMM shares to Quiborax could not have been approved. Furthermore, the minutes of the 17 August meeting were not registered in the notary's record book and in the Commercial Register until *after* the dispute arose in 2004. This is specially suspicious when one considers that the minutes of the shareholder *s'* meeting of NMM of 3 August 2001 were registered in the notary's record book and in the Commercial Register within a few weeks. Finally, NMM's minute book contains serious irregularities insofar as it consists of loose pages being affixed to the book. Within the context of the criminal trial taking place in Bolivia, the authenticity expert concluded that the minutes of 17 August 2001 are not the ones originally included in NMM's minute book.76\n\nOJ, \u00b6\u00b6 136-147.\n\n88.\n\nThe Claimants also fabricated the minutes of the shareholders' meeting of 13 September 2001. This becomes clear when one takes into account the following observations.\n\n89.\n\nFirst, the minutes of 13 September 2001, which list Quiborax and Allan Fosk as shareholders of NMM, are inconsistent with the minutes of 11 September 2001, which do not list them. Whilst the minutes of 11 September 2001 were registered in the Commercial Register in 2001, the minutes of 13 September 2001 were never registered and were first sent to the *Superintendencia* in January 2005 after this dispute arose. Second, Allan Fosk, whose presence is mentioned in the minutes, was not in Bolivia on 13 September 2001 and therefore could not have been in attendance. Third, Mr. David Moscoso admitted that the minutes of 13 September 2001 were fabricated. Fourth, Dolly Paredes' signature on these minutes is different from her signature on other documents. Fifth, the authenticity expert also concluded that the minutes of 13 September 2001 are not the ones originally included in NMM's minute book. Sixth, the minutes of 13 September 2001, signed by Allan Fosk, refer to Quiborax \"S.A.\". However, the corporate name is Quiborax \"Ltd.\"; surprisingly, Allan Fosk did not notice this mistake at the time he signed the minutes.77\n\nOJ, \u00b6\u00b6 148-159; Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 123-129.\n\n90.\n\nThe Claimants have also submitted three certificates issued by Chilean authorities. These certificates, however, do not predate the dispute and were indeed expressly issued for purposes of this arbitration. These certificates merely demonstrate that Quiborax declared to have invested in NMM to the Chilean authorities.78\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 51-52.\n\n1.1.3. NMM has solely Bolivian shareholders and thus it is not a Chilean national under the ICSID Convention and the Treaty\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n91.\n\nNMM is owned solely by Bolivian shareholders. It follows that NMM may not be considered a Chilean national either under Article 25(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention or under Article X(4) of the the Bolivia-Chile BIT.79 Therefore, as is the case with respect to Quiborax and Allan Fosk, NMM is not an \"investor\" within the meaning of the Treaty.80\n\nArticle X of the Bolivia-Chile BIT is entitled \"Settlement of Disputes Between a Contracting Party and an investor of the Other Contracting Party.\" Article X(4) in turn provides: \"For purposes of this Article, any legal person constituted under the laws of one of the Contracting Parties and whose shares, before the time the dispute arises, are majority-owned by an investor of the other Contracting Party, shall be considered as a legal person of the other Contracting Party, pursuant to Article 25 2) b) of the aforementioned Washington Convention\" (Tribunal's translation; Exh. CL-1).\n\nOJ, \u00b6\u00b6 161-186; Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 130-132.\n\n1.1.4. Claimants' evidence suggests that Quiborax acquired 50% of the shares of R\u00edo Grande, not NMM\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n92.\n\nIn the Reply, Bolivia asserted for the first time that the Claimant's evidence, in particular the registered contract for the purchase of R\u00edo Grande (the \"R\u00edo Grande Contract\"81), and the payments to Alvaro Ugalde and Edsal Finance82, suggests that what Quiborax purchased in reality was 50% of the shares of R\u00edo Grande - not of NMM. While the Claimants argue that the R\u00edo Grande Contract was left without effect by the Leonardo Fosk-David Moscoso contract (the \"Fosk-Moscoso Contract\"), this contract is not valid because: (i) the parties to this contract are different from the parties to the R\u00edo Grande Contract; (ii) the Fosk-Moscoso Contract was not registered in a notary's record book unlike the Rio Grande Contract; (iii) the Fosk-Moscoso Contract is of dubious authenticity because it falsely states in its third clause that the R\u00edo Grande Contract \"was not executed by the parties\"; (iv) payments were indeed made in accordance with the R\u00edo Grande Contract; and (v) the Fosk-Moscoso Contract was only produced with the Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction.83\n\nExh. CD-17.\n\nExh. CD-116.\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 59-64.\n\n93.\n\nNevertheless, even if the Fosk-Moscoso Contract were valid, this would not confirm Claimants' version of the facts because under this contract Quiborax would acquire 50% of R\u00edo Grande's *mining concessions*, not of NMM; further, under the Fosk-Moscoso Contract, the parties considered the possibility of creating a corporation where each contracting party would own 50% of the shares, not one where Quiborax would be the majority shareholder.84\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 65-69.\n\n1.2. The Claimants' Position\n----------------------------\n\n94.\n\nThe Claimants argue that they have made a protected \"investment\", and therefore all three Claimants are \"investors\" within the meaning of both the Treaty and the ICSID Convention. They contend that Chilean nationals Quiborax and Allan Fosk acquired mining concessions in Bolivia, that Quiborax and Allan Fosk are shareholders of NMM as a matter of Bolivian law, and that NMM is deemed to hold Chilean nationality because it is controlled by Chileans.85 The Respondent has never questioned that NMM is the 100% owner of eleven mining concessions in the R\u00edo Grande area, but claims that Quiborax and Allan Fosk never became shareholders of NMM.86\n\nCM, \u00a7\u00a7 II, V.\n\nRej., \u00b6 2.\n\n1.2.1. Chilean nationals Quiborax and Allan Fosk acquired mining concessions in Bolivia\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n95.\n\nIn 1999, David Moscoso and Alvaro Ugalde, owners of R\u00edo Grande, contacted Quiborax with a proposal to jointly develop a project concerning seven mining concessions in the R\u00edo Grande area. The shareholders of R\u00edo Grande were Moscoso (50%); Edsal Finance Inc. (\"Edsal Finance\"), a company incorporated under the laws of Panama and represented by Alvaro Ugalde (49.5%); and Gonzalo Ugalde, brother of Alvaro Ugalde (0.5%). R\u00edo Grande's only assets were the seven mining concessions. Messrs. Moscoso and Ugalde were looking for a strategic partner that would provide know-how and capital to develop their business.87\n\nCM, \u00b6\u00b6 14-15.\n\n96.\n\nAfter examining the viability of the project and the investor-friendly Bolivian legislation, Quiborax accepted to negotiate. Thus, Quiborax, on the one hand, and Messrs. Moscoso and Ugalde, on the other, began to explore ways in which to structure their cooperation. Proposals for a joint venture and a lease were discussed and eventually discarded. In the end, on 12 January 2001, R\u00edo Grande and Quiborax entered into an exclusive supply contract for a period of 15 years (the \"Exclusive Supply Contract\"). Under the Exclusive Supply Contract, Quiborax had a right of first refusal over R\u00edo Grande's mining concessions, and a right to purchase the mining concessions in the event that an arbitrator found that R\u00edo Grande had breached the contract.88\n\nCM, \u00b6\u00b6 16-24.\n\n97.\n\nA month after the Exclusive Supply Contract was executed, Alvaro and Gonzalo Ugalde offered to sell their 50% shareholding in R\u00edo Grande to Quiborax because Alvaro Ugalde was looking to raise capital for other projects. Quiborax accepted the offer. On 12 March 2001, Quiborax, on the one hand, and Edsal and Gonzalo Ugalde, on the other, entered into an agreement whereby Edsal and Gonzalo Ugalde would sell their combined shares in R\u00edo Grande (50%) to Quiborax (the \"Share Transfer Agreement\"). The agreed purchase price was USD 400,000, to be paid in six instalments.89\n\n*Id.*, at \u00b6\u00b6 25-27.\n\n98.\n\nEventually, to avoid the risks inherent to an existing corporation, Quiborax decided to structure the operation through a new company, rather than as shareholders of R\u00edo Grande. For this reason, on 12 May 2001, Leonardo Fosk, on behalf of Quiborax, and David Moscoso, on behalf of R\u00edo Grande, annulled the Share Transfer Agreement and entered into a new agreement to create either a joint venture or a new corporation (the \"Fosk-Moscoso Contract\"). Quiborax retained Fernando Rojas, of C.R. & F. Rojas Abogados (the \"Rojas law firm\"), as its local counsel to implement the Fosk-Moscoso Contract.90\n\n*Id.*, at \u00b6\u00b6 27-31.\n\n99.\n\nThe Rojas law firm devised a scheme to implement the Fosk-Moscoso Contract in three steps. First, Mr. Moscoso and the Ugalde brothers would contribute the R\u00edo Grande mining concessions to a new corporation. Second, Quiborax would replace the Ugalde brothers as shareholders of the new corporation. Third, Quiborax would acquire an additional 1% share capital from Mr. Moscoso to secure control of the new corporation, and Allan Fosk would receive one share to comply with the Bolivian law requirement that there be a minimum of three shareholders.91\n\n*Id.*, at \u00b6\u00b6 32-34.\n\n100.\n\nOn 25 July 2001, the Rojas law firm incorporated NMM. The founding shareholders of NMM were Fernando Rojas (with 58 shares), Ms. Dolly Paredes (1 share) and Ms. Gilka Salas (1 share). Ms. Paredes and Ms. Salas are secretaries at the Rojas law firm. NMM was registered with the Internal Revenue Service and with the Commercial Register. On 3 August 2001, after R\u00edo Grande's and NMM's approvals, R\u00edo Grande transferred its seven mining concessions to NMM. On 8 August 2001, Alvaro Ugalde received the last payment for the sale of his 50% interest in the mining concessions, thereby completing payment of the USD 400,000 total purchase price.92\n\n*Id.*, at \u00b6\u00b6 35-42, 44.\n\n101.\n\nOn 17 August 2001, R\u00edo Grande received 26,680 NMM shares in exchange for the seven mining concessions it had transferred to NMM. On that very day, R\u00edo Grande transferred all of its NMM shares (26,680) to Quiborax by endorsement, as reflected in share certificate No. 4. Whilst Mr. Moscoso was entitled to 50% of these shares, Quiborax and Mr. Moscoso had agreed that Quiborax would own 51% of the shares of NMM and Mr. Moscoso 49%. Therefore, on 4 September 2001, Quiborax transferred 50% of the NMM shares to Mr. Moscoso in two batches: a batch of 13,013 shares (equal to 49% of the shares of NMM) and a batch of 267 shares (equal to 1% of the shares of NMM). On the same day, Mr. Moscoso sold the batch of 267 shares to Quiborax for USD 9,985. These transfers are reflected in share certificates 4, 5, and 6, 10 and 11. Finally, on 10 September 2001, the founding shareholders transferred their shares to Quiborax and Allan Fosk: Fernando Rojas and Dolly Paredes transferred their shares to Quiborax, while Gilka Salas transferred her one share to Allan Fosk. These transfers are documented in share certificates Nos. 8 and 9.93\n\n*Id.*, at \u00b6\u00b6 43-55.\n\n102.\n\nAs a result, the shareholder composition of NMM as of 10 September 2001 was the following: Quiborax held 50,995% of the shares; David Moscoso held 49%; and Allan Fosk held 0,005%. Thus, Chilean national Quiborax became the majority shareholder of NMM as of that date.94\n\n*Id.*, at \u00b6\u00b6 56-57.\n\n103.\n\nIn the Reply on Jurisdiction, the Respondent has alleged for the first time that the evidence would show that Quiborax acquired 50% of the shares of R\u00edo Grande, and not 50% of the shares of NMM. The Respondent acknowledges that R\u00edo Grande owned 99% of the shares of NMM. Thus, even if Respondent's theory were true, Quiborax would own 49.5% of the shares of NMM, only 1.5% less of the 51% it has always claimed to own. This would suffice to confer standing on Quiborax to bring this arbitration.95\n\nRej., \u00b6 40.\n\n1.2.2. Quiborax and Allan Fosk are shareholders of NMM as a matter of Bolivian law\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n104.\n\nUnder Bolivian law, in particular Articles 251 and 268 of the Commercial Code (\"CC\"), shareholder status is proven exclusively by the shareholders registry.96 Otherwise stated, those appearing in the shareholders registry *are* the shareholders of the company. Quiborax and Allan Fosk are registered in the NMM shareholders registry. Therefore, the Claimants have met the only requirement they need to meet to prove their shareholder status under Bolivian law.97\n\n*Id.*, at \u00b6 46.\n\nCM, \u00b6\u00b6 58-70\n\n105.\n\nContrary to what the Respondent and Prof. Salame assert, registration in the shareholders registry does not merely give rise to a rebuttable presumption of shareholder status. Rather, registration itself creates the status of shareholder. This has been confirmed by a legal commentator, by expert Prof. Rosenkrantz, and by the Bolivian government itself. Prof. Salame simply misinterprets or ignores Art. 268 CC.98\n\n*Id.*, at \u00b6\u00b6 62-74; Rej. \u00b6\u00b6 149-152.\n\n106.\n\nAt any rate, there is plenty of additional evidence showing that Quiborax and Allan Fosk are shareholders of NMM: the certificates from the Chilean authorities; Quiborax's financial statements audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers in Chile; all the minutes of shareholders' meeting of NMM celebrated from September 2001; the field study of Mr. Juan Pablo de Luca and the expert report of Prof. Rosenkrantz.99\n\nCM, \u00b6\u00b6 75-82.\n\n1.2.3. NMM is to be deemed a Chilean national because it is under Chilean control\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n107.\n\nSince Quiborax is the majority shareholder of NMM, NMM is a Chilean national for purposes of the Treaty. As a Chilean national, NMM has standing to act as a claimant in this arbitration.100\n\n*Id.*, at \u00b6\u00b6 159-166.\n\n1.3. Analysis\n-------------\n\n108.\n\nThe Tribunal must determine whether Quiborax, Allan Fosk and NMM are \"investors\" within the meaning of the Treaty. In order to reach this determination, the Tribunal must ascertain (1.3.1) whether Quiborax and Allan Fosk were shareholders of NMM at the time when the dispute between the Parties arose in June 2004; and, if so, (1.3.2) whether NMM was to be considered a Chilean national at the time as a result of its being majority-owned by Chilean nationals Quiborax and Allan Fosk.\n\n1.3.1. Were Quiborax and Allan Fosk shareholders of NMM at the time the dispute arose in June 2004?\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n109.\n\nFor the purpose of ascertaining whether Quiborax and Allan Fosk were shareholders of NMM at the time the dispute arose in June 2004, the Tribunal will examine (i) what party bears the burden of proof with respect to the various allegations put forward; (ii) how shareholder status is to be established under Bolivian law; (iii) the Claimants' account and evidence of the events; and (iv) the Respondent's account and evidence of the events. On the basis of the preceding analysis, (v) the Tribunal will then state its conclusion.\n\n*(i) Burden of proof*\n---------------------\n\n110.\n\nThe main issue in this jurisdictional dispute is whether Quiborax and Allan Fosk were shareholders of NMM in June 2004. The Claimants allege that Quiborax and Allan Fosk collectively acquired 51% of the shares of NMM in August and September 2001, and have been the majority shareholders of NMM ever since. The Respondent, on the other hand, argues that the Claimants fabricated evidence showing that Quiborax and Allan Fosk were shareholders of NMM at the time the dispute arose solely to gain access to ICSID jurisdiction.\n\n111.\n\nIt is common ground between the Parties, and rightly so, that the burden of proving that Quiborax and Allan Fosk acquired shares of NMM in August and September 2001 rests upon the Claimants. At the hearing, Counsel for the Respondent stated that in order \"to establish the jurisdiction of the tribunal, [the Claimants] have to discharge a certain burden of proof. They have to establish that, first, they are investors and, second, that there is an investment.\"101 Counsel for the Claimants concurred: \"We accept, as we always did, that the burden of proof regarding the proof of investment is on [the Claimants].\"102\n\nTr. 19:11-13.\n\n*Id.*, at 535:20-22.\n\n112.\n\nYet, there is no common ground with respect to the Respondent's allegations that the Claimants fabricated evidence to initiate this arbitration. At the hearing, Counsel for the Respondent argued: \"Although we think that the Tribunal will be fully convinced [...] that Quiborax and Mr. Fosk have not acquired these shares, we would say that even if we only had raised a doubt, that should suffice because they are [the] Claimants, they bear the burden of proof, and when there is room for doubt, the burden is not discharged. [I]n *Cementownia v. Turkey,* [...] the tribunal conclude[d] that the transaction which would have constituted the investment [...] 'never took place' and 'the claim is a sham.' And that's what we think. The claim here is a sham.\"103 In other words, the Respondent does not consider that it must prove its allegations of fraud; it is enough if those allegations \"raise[] a doubt.\"104\n\n*Id.*, at 21:7-14, 22:15-20.\n\n*Id.*, at 21:11; *see also* Reply, p. 10, n. 23: \"it is not necessary for the State to prove that the Claimants have fraudulently fabricated their condition of investors for the Tribunal to find that it has no jurisdiction; it is enough if it [the Tribunal] deems that the evidence submitted is insufficient.\"\n\n113.\n\nBy contrast, the Claimants maintain that the Respondent bears the burden of proving its allegations of fraud. During oral argument, counsel for the Claimants submitted that while \"the burden of proof regarding the proof of investment is on [the Claimants], [...] the burden of proof on the fraud allegation is on the Respondent, and [...] they have never accepted that. That's the difference. It is not sufficient [...] just to create doubts on the Tribunal.\"105 Counsel for the Claimants further stated that the \"Respondent has not just the burden of proof, but also the responsibility and [...] the duty to proceed to prove their accusations, and these accusations and the evidence produced shall be subject to a strict standard of proof.\"106\n\nTr., 533:21-534:5.\n\n*Id.*, at 113:20-114:3.\n\n114.\n\nThe question which the Tribunal must answer is whether the Claimants are \"investors\" under the Treaty and, more specifically, whether Quiborax and Allan Fosk became majority shareholders of NMM in August and September 2001. Thus, it will first examine whether the Claimants have discharged their burden of proving that they are \"investors\". Assuming the answer is positive, it will then review whether the Respondent has disproven or raised sufficient doubts on the Claimants' allegations that they are \"investors\". Finally, on the basis of this overall analysis, it will conclude whether or not the Claimants are \"investors\".\n\n*(ii) Proof of shareholder status under Bolivian law*\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n115.\n\nThe Parties disagree on what needs to be proven to show shareholder status under Bolivian law. According to the Claimants, shareholders status under Bolivian law is proven solely by reference to the shareholders registry:\n\n\"The only and sufficient proof of the condition of shareholder is [...] the Shareholders Registry.107 Given that Quiborax and Allan Fosk are registered in the NMM Shareholders Registry, it is undisputable that, according to Bolivian law, Quiborax and Allan Fosk are shareholders of NMM [...]. For this reason, any additional evidence the Respondent has requested is immaterial and serves no purpose.\"108\n\nRep. PM, \u00b6 5.\n\nCM, \u00b6\u00b6 65, 73.\n\n116.\n\nThe Respondent, by contrast, contends that the shareholders registry merely creates a presumption of shareholder status, which can be rebutted by \"any means which allows to establish who the real shareholder is.\"109 Thus, the Claimants are wrong to argue that the shareholders registry gives rise to an irrebuttable presumption (*presumptio iuris et de iure*). Even if it were true, that registration in the shareholders registry is an essential requirement to acquire shareholder status, *quod non*, this would still not mean that the evidentiary value of the shareholders registry is unquestionable.110\n\nOJ, \u00b6 121 (Tribunal's translation).\n\nRej., \u00b6\u00b6 85, 97-111.\n\n117.\n\nThe relevant provisions of the Bolivian Commercial Code (\"BCC\") reads as follows:\n\nArt. 251\n\n\"The corporation deems as owner of the shares whoever is registered as such in the certificates and in the shareholders reg istry.\"111\n\nArt. 268\n\n\"It has shareholder status whoever is registered in the corporation's shareholders registry, if the shares are nominative; and whoever is the holder, if the shares are bearer shares.\"112\n\nCM, p. 28, n. 76; missing from Annex CD-1 (Tribunal's translation).\n\nAnnex CD-1.\n\n118.\n\nOn the basis of these provisions, the Tribunal is not convinced that proof of shareholder status is established exclusively on the basis of the shareholders registry. First, Article 251 refers not only to the shareholders registry but also to the share certificates. Even if this provision focuses on the relationship between the corporation and its shareholders113, its plain terms appear to defeat any claim that the shareholders registry is the sole source by which to ascertain shareholder status.\n\nCM, \u00b6\u00b6 147, 149.\n\n119.\n\nSecond, it is true that Article 268 of the BCC, on which the Claimants chiefly rely, provides that \"whoever is registered in the corporation's shareholders registry\" is a shareholder.114 However, it does not necessarily follow that the shareholders registry is the *sole* source of evidence to determine who enjoys shareholder status. Article 268 of the BCC does not exclude other means to establish shareholder status. The Tribunal therefore agrees with the Respondent's legal expert, Prof. Salame, that the shareholders registry \"merely creates a rebuttable presumption [...] in favour of the person therein registered\"115, and \"does not exhaust the discussion over who really is the shareholder of the corporation.\"116\n\n*Supra*, at \u00b6 117.\n\nSalame ER I, \u00b6 75 (Tribunal's translation).\n\n*Id*., at \u00b6 81.\n\n120.\n\nThird, the legal effects of registration in the shareholders registry must be distinguished from the probative value of the registry. Even assuming *arguendo* that registration in the shareholders registry for nominative shares were a requirement to acquire shareholder status, it would not imply that the facts recorded in the registry are not open to challenge. To this extent, the Tribunal agrees with Prof. Salame, who explains that:\n\n\"The legal effect of registration in the shareholders registry and its probative value [are] two different issues [...]. Whereas in the first scenario we are situated on a legal plane, in the second scenario we are situated on a plane of facts and presumptions.\n\nEven if [...] registration in the shareholders registry serves a constitutive function, this does not mean that the facts recorded in such a registry cannot be disproven by other evidence [...].\"117\n\nSalame ER II, \u00b6\u00b6 9, 13 (Tribunal's translation).\n\n121.\n\nFourth, as the Claimants acknowledge, the \"shareholders registry reflects the ownership of the shares; it cannot change it.\"118 Yet, as the Claimants further concede, this \"reflection\" may be inaccurate: there could be a \"discrepancy between the [share] titles and the registry\"119 - in short, between the registry and reality. Perhaps for this reason, the Claimants accept that the shareholders registry would have no effect \"in case of fraud, force, deceit or any other cause of annulment of legal acts.\"120 In this case, Bolivia is precisely alleging fraud. In these circumstances, it is difficult to see why Quiborax and Allan Fosk's shareholders status would need to be ascertained exclusively on the basis of the registry.\n\nRej., \u00b6 151.\n\n*Id*., at \u00b6 141 (Tribunal's translation).\n\n*Id*., at \u00b6 144 (Tribunal's translation).\n\n122.\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, the Tribunal will examine whether Quiborax and Allan Fosk became shareholders of NMM not only on the basis of the shareholders registry, but on the basis of the entire record before it.\n\n*(iii) The Claimants' account and evidence of the events*\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n123.\n\nIn this sub-section, the Tribunal will examine the Claimants' statements of facts and supporting documentation.\n\n124.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, in 1999, David Moscoso and Alvaro Ugalde, owners of R\u00edo Grande, approached Quiborax \"to develop a business project involving [R\u00edo Grande's] seven mining concessions\"121 in Bolivia. The first documented contact between Quiborax and R\u00edo Grande is allegedly a letter from David Moscoso and Alvaro Ugalde to Eng. Carlos Shuffer of Quiborax, dated 26 January 2000 but seemingly faxed on the following day from Bolivia to Chile:\n\n\"Dear Sirs,\n\nRatifying the terms of the recent telephone conversations, we hereby confirm our interest in participating with you in the development, exploitation and sale of our ulexite deposit in R\u00edo Grande, executing an association or joint venture contract, by which Quiborax could assume the management and 50% or more of the shares and rights in our Company in exchange for the economic and financial resources required to implement and set in motion [the] project [...].\n\nTaking into account that our mining concessions are more than 50 kilometres away from the border, there is no restriction of any kind preventing a foreign company from acquiring the entirety of those concessions, or eventually 100% of the shares of our Company.\n\nWe look forward to your comments. Very truly yours,\n\nDavid Moscoso Ruiz - Alvaro Ugalde Canedo\" (emphasis added).122\n\nCM, \u00b6 15.\n\nExh. CD-9 (Tribunal's translation).\n\n125.\n\nAt that time, Quiborax and R\u00edo Grande were purportedly in the process of exploring \"different alternatives\"123 to give form to their plans for the joint exploitation of the ulexite deposits in the R\u00edo Grande area. As part of that process, David Moscoso sent a letter to Allan Fosk and Eng. Shuffer, dated 29 March 2000 and seemingly faxed on the same day from Bolivia:\n\n\"Dear Sirs,\n\nIn the first place, we would like to express our satisfaction for the fruitful and worthy exchange of opinions with the esteemed Alan Fosk and Carlos Shuffer in relation to the exploitation of the R\u00edo Grande deposit owned by our Company.\n\nOur agreement was, in principle, that the most suitable procedure to reach an agreement for the exploitation of the ulexite would be a property lease with a purchase option within a three-year period at a pre-determined price. Following a discussion and review between partners [...], we have agreed to submit the following proposal to you:\n\n[...].\n\nWe look forward to your useful comments. Truly yours,\n\nDavid Moscoso\" (emphasis added).124\n\nCM, \u00b6 19.\n\nExh. CD-103 (Tribunal's translation).\n\n126.\n\nHowever, the proposal for a lease and purchase option did not prosper. Eventually, on 12 January 2001, Quiborax and R\u00edo Grande finally reached an agreement, formalized in a notarized contract, whereby Quiborax would acquire ulexite from R\u00edo Grande on an exclusive basis (the \"Exclusive Supply Contract\").125 Under the Exclusive Supply Contract, Quiborax, the \"buyer\", committed to buy specified quantities of ulexite from R\u00edo Grande, the \"seller\" or \"supplier\", on an exclusive basis for a 15-year period beginning in January 2001.126\n\nExh. CD-16.\n\n*Id*., at clause 1, \"Definitions\"; clause 5, \"Contract Term.\"\n\n127.\n\nThe Exclusive Supply Contract is significant because its terms are not disputed by the Parties. The Claimants and the Respondent accept that Quiborax and R\u00edo Grande entered into this contract in early 2001. It is only from that point onwards that their disagreement begins to emerge. According to the Claimants, the Exclusive Supply Contract was terminated \"shortly thereafter\"127 because it had \"lost its purpose\".128 According to the Respondent, however, this contract \"was never terminated\"129, as \"there is no document in the record that shows that.\"130\n\nTr. 127:6-7.\n\n*Id.*, *at* 561:20.\n\n*Id.*, at 105:17-18.\n\n*Id.*, at 28:19-20.\n\n128.\n\nThe uncontested, notarized Exclusive Supply Contract contained the following relevant provisions for purposes of this dispute:\n\n\"Clause nineteenth - Covenants: [...] In case this contract were rescinded on account of the supplier's [R\u00edo Grande's] breach of its obligations, as declared in an award issued by the arbitrator appointed in accordance with clause sixteen, such an award shall provide that RIGSSA [R\u00edo Grande] grants to Quiborax, for a 60-day period, an exclusive and irrevocable option to purchase all the mining concessions specified in clause three of this instrument [...].\n\nClause twentieth - Sale Prohibition and Right of First Refusal: The supplier may not transfer the mining concessions it owns and which are specified in clause three. After five years have elapsed from this date, RIGSSA [R\u00edo Grande] may offer such concessions for sale, but in that case, should there be a definite purchase offer, the supplier shall refer to Quiborax said offer [...]. Quiborax will have a 90-day period to match the offer referred by RIGSSA [R\u00edo Grande] and in this case the latter [R\u00edo Grande] irrevocably commits to sell and transfer to the former [Quiborax] the concessions with priority over any other potential buyer \" (emphasis added).131\n\nExh. CD-16, clauses 19 and 20 (Tribunal's translation).\n\n129.\n\nIn sum, the Exclusive Supply Contract contemplated two different scenarios under which Quiborax would enjoy an exclusive option to acquire R\u00edo Grande's mining concessions: (i) in the event that an arbitral tribunal constituted under the arbitration clause in the contract were to \"rescind\" the contract for a breach by R\u00edo Grande, and (ii) in the event that R\u00edo Grande decided to sell the mining concessions after a five-year period. In other words, the possibility that Quiborax could acquire a participation in the mining concessions was envisaged as early as 2001. This undisputed provisions lend credence to the previous correspondence of 26 January and 29 March 2000, where this possibility appears to have been discussed as well.\n\n130.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, a \"month after signing\"132 the Exclusive Supply Contract, the Ugalde brothers \"offered to sell their 50 percent participation\"133 in R\u00edo Grande, with Mr. Moscoso keeping his participation. Quiborax accepted this offer and, on 12 March 2001, exactly two months after concluding the Exclusive Supply Contract, entered into a Share Purchase Agreement (\"SPA\") with Edsal Finance Inc. - represented by Alvaro Ugalde - and Gonzalo Ugalde in order to acquire 50% of the shares of R\u00edo Grande.134 The SPA is consistent with the already-entertained possibility that Quiborax could acquire an interest in the mining concessions. Under the SPA, Quiborax would acquire such an interest by purchasing shares in R\u00edo Grande.\n\nMem., \u00b6 59.\n\n*Id*.\n\nExh. CD-17, p. 1.\n\n131.\n\nThe SPA is documented in a notarized contract.135 It was signed by Alvaro Ugalde, on behalf of both Edsal Finance Inc. and Gonzalo Ugalde, and by Leonardo Fosk, father of Allan136, on behalf of Quiborax.137 As collateral to ensure payment of the purchase price and also seemingly to secure the transfer of the shares, the shares were pledged for the benefit of both parties to the transaction.138 Quiborax agreed to pay USD 400,000 for 50% of the shares of R\u00edo Grande in accordance with the following payment schedule:\n\n**Date Payment**\n\nExecution SPA USD 90,000\n\n21 March 2001 USD 110,000\n\n21 April 2001 USD 50,000\n\n21 May 2001 USD 50,000\n\n21 June 2001 USD 50,000\n\n21 July 2001 USD 50,000\n\n*Id*.\n\nTr. 32:10-11.\n\nExh.

CD-101, pp. 8-11.\n\n132.\n\nQuiborax seems to have made the first payment under the SPA by issuing two checks in favor of Edsal Finance Inc. on 9 March 2001: a check for USD 50,000 and another check for USD 40,000, totaling USD 90,000.139 Indeed, the 9 March 2001 checks tally in timing and amount with the first scheduled payment under the SPA, stipulated to occur at the time of the execution of the SPA. This suggests that Quiborax did make these payments. Nevertheless, according to the Claimants, \"the transfer was never performed and Quiborax never became a shareholder in RIGSSA [R\u00edo Grande]\"140 because \"Quiborax preferred to avoid the risk of participating in an existing company and started exploring alternatives to structure its investment.\"141 These alternatives would presumably change the legal form but not the substance of the transaction.142\n\nExh. CD-116, p. 1.\n\nMem., \u00b6 60.\n\nCM, \u00b6 27.\n\nRej., \u00b6 77.\n\n133.\n\nAt one point, Bolivia appears to have alleged that the SPA was evidence that Quiborax acquired shares of R\u00edo Grande, as opposed to NMM.143 However, at the hearing, Counsel for the Respondent clarified that \"Bolivia does not accept\" that Quiborax acquired a \"50 percent shareholding in R\u00edo Grande.\"144 Thus, Bolivia agrees with the Claimants that the SPA was never implemented and that Quiborax never became a shareholder of R\u00edo Grande, albeit for different reasons. Whereas for the Claimants the SPA was not implemented in order to change the \"legal form\", but not the substance, of the transaction, for Bolivia the SPA was not implemented because the Exclusive Supply Contract was and remained in force.145\n\nReply, \u00a7 3.1.3, p. 19 (\"The evidence submitted by the Claimants suggests that what Quiborax acquired in reality was 50% of the shares in R\u00edo Grande\") (Tribunal's translation).\n\nTr. 30:8-11.\n\nTr. 105:17-18 (The Exclusive Supply Contract \"was never terminated\").\n\n134.\n\nAt this juncture, the Parties' diverging factual accounts take diametrically opposed paths. According to the Claimants, on 10 May 2001, nearly two months after the execution of the SPA, Quiborax, again represented by Leonardo Fosk, and R\u00edo Grande, this time represented by David Moscoso, entered into a new contract (the \"May 2001 Contract\"). This contract was intended to \"substitute and replace\" the SPA.146 The May 2001 Contract, which unlike the SPA was not notarized, stipulated the following in its relevant parts:\n\n\" **Third.-** [...] [I]t was agreed to sell and transfer all of the shares that EDSAL FINANCE, represented by Mr. Alvaro Ugalde, and Mr. Gonzalo Ugalde hold in [R\u00edo Grande] to Quiborax. The price agreed is US$ 400,000, of which the buyer has already paid to the sellers the sum of USD 250,000 [...]. The [SPA] has not yet been executed between the parties.\n\n**Fourth**.- [...] It was agreed to substitute and replace the [SPA] referred in clause 3 with another one by virtue of which [R\u00edo Grande] sells and transfers to Quiborax 50% of all the perfected mining concessions, and of any other that is in the process of being awarded, under the same economic terms and conditions provided for in the substituted agreement [the SPA].\n\n**Fifth.-** For its part [R\u00edo Grande] shall transfer 50% of the same perfected mining concessions or in the process of being awarded to Mr. David Moscoso Ruiz.\n\n**Sixth.-** The goal of the transactions specified in the last two preceding clauses is to facilitate the creation of a corporation or a joint venture contract [...] in order to associate both owners in the mining exploitation and commercial development of this property\" (emphasis added).\"147\n\nExh. CD-104, clauses third and fourth, pp. 1-2.\n\n*Id*., at clauses third to sixth, pp. 1-2.\n\n135.\n\nIt thus appears that whilst the May 2001 Contract was intended to \"substitute and replace\" the SPA, the \"economic terms and conditions\" of the SPA would remain unchanged.148 Indeed, the payments made until the time of the execution of the May 2001 Contract again tally with the schedule of payments under the SPA: (i) two 9 March 2001 checks payable to Edsal Finance for a total of USD 90,000149 (tallying with the first SPA installment); (ii) two 27 March 2001 checks - one of which had the word \"Quibora\"x printed on it - and one 29 March 2001 check, all payable to Edsal Finance, for a total of USD 110,000150 (tallying with the second SPA installment151); and lastly, (iii) two 20 April 2001 checks payable to Edsal Finance Inc. for a total of USD 50,000152 (tallying with the third SPA installment).\n\n*Id*., at clause fourth, p. 2.\n\nExh. CD-116, p. 1.\n\n*Id*., at pp. 2-3.\n\nWith a few days of delay, as the second installment was due on 21 March 2001.\n\n*Id*., at p. 4.\n\n136.\n\nHence, it appears that, by the time the May 2001 Contract was executed, Quiborax had already made payments to Edsal Finance Inc. for a total of USD 250,000. This accords not only with the terms of the SPA, but also with the plain terms of the May 2001 Contract, which specifies in its third clause that Quiborax had already paid \"the sum of USD 250,000\"153 to Edsal Finance Inc. and Gonzalo Ugalde. On the other hand, although the \"economic terms and conditions\" of the May 2001 Contract were no different from those of the SPA, the legal terms and the form of the transaction were different.\n\nExh. CD-104, pp.1-2.\n\n137.\n\nClause No. 4 of the May 2001 Contract stipulates that R\u00edo Grande would \"sell[] and transfer[] to Quiborax 50% of all [the] mining concessions.\"154 But contrary to the impression this clause read in isolation might convey, this contract is not a mere asset purchase. Rather, the fourth clause must be read in conjunction with the sixth clause, according to which the goal of the transfers stipulated in the fourth and fifth clauses \"is to facilitate the creation of a corporation or a joint venture contract.\"155 It thus seems that the substance of both the SPA and the May 2001 Contract was the same and consisted in the transfer of 50% of the mining concessions to Quiborax. What would change was the structure of the transaction: under the SPA, the transfer of the mining concessions was to take place through the purchase of shares in R\u00edo Grande; under the May 2001 Contract, by contrast, the transfer would be effected through the creation of a new \"corporation or a joint venture contract.\"\n\n*Id*.\n\n*Id*., at clause sixth, p. 2.\n\n138.\n\nIn this regard, it should be noted that, although Alvaro Ugalde did not execute the May 2001 Contract156, clause eleven stipulates that its terms \"bind Alvaro Ugalde in all of its parts\"157, as they were \"previously agreed\"158 with him. On 14 May 2001, only four days after the execution of the May 2001 Contract, it appears that Alvaro Ugalde wrote the following to Quiborax, Leonardo Fosk, David Fux \"and others\"159 with regard to the \"[t]ransfer of the R\u00edo Grande shares\"160:\n\n\"Dear friends\n\n[\u2026]\n\nIn accordance with the commitments undertaken with Quiborax, | have previously faxed the certificates showing the transfer of shares of EDSAL FINANCE INC. and Gonzalo Ugalde Canedo in favor of Quiborax. The originals have been sent to Santiago via Courier.\n\nIf your decision is to become shareholders of RIGSSA [R\u00edo Grande], you should complete the \"definitive registration\" in the shareholders registry [\u2026]\n\nIf your decision is *not* to become shareholders of RIGSSA [R\u00edo Grande], you should create a new corporation [...].\n\nTruly yours,\n\nAlvaro Ugalde\" (emphasis added).161\n\nAlvaro Ugalde did, however, execute the SPA on behalf of both Edsal Finance Inc. and Gonzalo Ugalde (*see* Exh. CD-17, p. 4).\n\n*Id*., at clause eleventh, p. 5.\n\n*Id*.\n\nExh. CD-18.\n\n*Id*.\n\n*Id*. (Tribunal's translation).\n\n139.\n\nOn 17 May 2001, Alvaro Ugalde again wrote to the addressees of his preceding letter:\n\n\"Dear friends\n\nAs I am still unaware of the decision you have made with respect to the type of company that will devote itself to the exploitation of ulexite in R\u00edo Grande, I attach a report [...] describing that the share transfer is perfected, being only required that it be registered in the corporate books for it to become valid as against the corporation and third-parties.\n\nRegards,\n\nAlvaro Ugalde [Report attached]\" (emphasis added).162\n\nExh. CD-144 (Tribunal's translation).\n\n140.\n\nThese two letters tend to suggest that Alvaro Ugalde was aware of and in agreement with the terms of the May 2001 Contract. Just as important, the letters suggest that Mr. Ugalde was not concerned about the particular legal structure or form the transaction would adopt, but was on the contrary willing to let Quiborax make that decision (\"[i]f your decision is to become shareholders of RIGSSA [R\u00edo Grande] [\u2026] [i]f your decision is *not* to become shareholders of RIGSSA [R\u00edo Grande]\"163). The letters also appear to reveal that the terms of the SPA were close to being fully performed (\"the share transfer is perfected, being only required that [\u2026]\"164).\n\nExh. CD-18.\n\nExh. CD-144.\n\n141.\n\nConsistent with one of the options envisioned in the May 2001 Contract, it appears that Quiborax opted for the \"creation of a [new] corporation\" as the vehicle through which to accomplish the transfer of the mining concessions. In June 2001, the Claimants allege that they retained Fernando Rojas, \"a reputed and well known lawyer within and outside Bolivia\"165 and partner of the Rojas law firm, to structure this operation.166 The plan was allegedly to create a new company, to which the mining concessions would be transferred, and to replace the Ugalde brothers - or, more precisely, Edsal Finance and Gonzalo Ugalde - with Quiborax. Allan Fosk would, in turn, receive one share \"in order to comply with the minimum three shareholders' requirement under Bolivian corporate law.\"167\n\nMem., \u00b6 62.\n\n*Id.*, at \u00b6 62; CM, \u00b6 31.\n\nCM, \u00b6 34.\n\n142.\n\nPresumably also on the advice of Mr. Rojas, Quiborax would also acquire an additional 1% of the shares from Mr. Moscoso to secure \"control of the new company.\"168 For jurisdictional purposes, this additional 1% participation is fundamental insofar as NMM can only act as claimant in this arbitration if it is majority-owned by Quiborax. This additional step would also entail an amendment of the May 2001 Contract, which provided that Quiborax and Mr. Moscoso would each own a \"50%\" participation in the new corporation.169 On examination from the Tribunal, Allan Fosk offered the following reason as to why it was decided that Quiborax would become the majority shareholder of the new corporation:\n\n**\"[Tribunal]** : It is unclear from the record [\u2026] why at some point it was decided that Quiborax would have 51 percent of the shares of NMM when before that there are documents that say it would be shared 50/50 [the May 2001 Contract], and there is no document [\u2026] [or] explanation for the change to 51. Can you explain this?\n\n**[Allan Fosk]** : Yes [\u2026]. At first, what we agreed was 50 percent for Quiborax and 50 percent for Moscoso, but we came to realize over the months that that could give rise to [...] corporate governance problems over time [...]. [T]herefore [...] we came to an agreement that he was willing to sell us the 1 percent of the shares at a price of $ 9,985, and then we [...] transferred] the shares and ma[de] the corresponding payment \" (emphasis added).170\n\nRej., \u00b6 92(e).\n\nExh. CD-104, clause seventh, p. 3.\n\nTr. 238:9-239:7.\n\n143.\n\nThe Tribunal finds this explanation plausible. It is well-known and easy to understand that 50-50 joint ventures are a source of difficulties. Moreover, the change from a 50-50 to a 51-49 joint venture (\"the 51/49 agreement\") was but the latest of a series of changes in the contractual arrangements between Quiborax, R\u00edo Grande and R\u00edo Grande's shareholders. Originally, after exploring different collaborative schemes171, Quiborax and R\u00edo Grande concluded the Exclusive Supply Contract in January 2001.172 Two months later, the Exclusive Supply Contract would have given way to the SPA173, which in turn was soon replaced by the May 2001 Contract.174 Thus, this additional change appears to have been unexceptional in light of the preceding chain of events.\n\nExhs. CD-9 and CD-103.\n\nExh. CD-16.\n\nExh. CD-17.\n\nExh. CD-104.\n\n144.\n\nIn any event, it is undisputed that, on 25 July 2001, Fernando Rojas, Dole Paredes and Gilka Salas constituted NMM.175 This was the \"new corporation\" referred to in the May 2001 Contract, created to complete the transfer of 51% of the mining concessions to Quiborax. The timing of the incorporation of NMM, about two and a half months after the execution of the May 2001 Contract and the two letters from Alvaro Ugalde, is consistent with the Claimants' preceding account of the facts. On the same day, NMM was registered with the Bolivian Internal Revenue Service.176 As of 27 July 2001, NMM was also registered with the Commercial Registry (the \" *Senarec* \" at the time).177\n\nExh. CD-23; CM, \u00b6 35; Rej., \u00b6 93.\n\nExh. R-137; CM, \u00b6 37; Rej., \u00b6 93.\n\nExh. R-139.\n\n145.\n\nThe Claimants allege that Dole Paredes and Gilka Salas were staff members of the Rojas law firm, and that they acted as founding shareholders of NMM together with Fernando Rojas in order to spare Quiborax \"the trouble of dealing with the necessary administrative formalities.\"178 The records issued by the Commercial Registry (currently \" *Fundempresa* \"), showing the multiple corporations with which Fernando Rojas, Dole Paredes and Gilka Salas have had \"commercial links\" as shareholders, tend to bolster this allegation.179 Fernando Rojas would have received 58 shares, and Dolly Paredes and Gilka Salas would each have received one share, presumably to comply with the Bolivian law requirement that the corporation be composed of at least three shareholders.\n\nCM, \u00b6 36.\n\nExh. CD-130 (1 to 3). The Tribunal notes that whilst Prof. Salame testified that having lawyers incorporate companies for the clients was not \"common practice\", he did not argue that this was unheard of, merely limiting himself to declare that \"out of personal ethics, [he] wouldn't do that [but i]f Dr. Rojas or any other lawyer does so, that is their opinion, and that requires no comment on my part\" (Tr. 326:10-20, 327:12-18).\n\n146.\n\nThe initial shares issued to Fernando Rojas, Dole Paredes and Gilka Salas are documented both in the shareholders registry180, which seems to have been formally opened on 27 July 2001, and on the NMM share certificates Nos. 1 to 3 of the same date. Thus, the dates of the shareholders registry and the NMM share certificates Nos. 1 to 3 tally with each other, with the date of incorporation of NMM and, more generally, with the previous sequence of events. In the meantime, Quiborax continued making payments under the May 2001 Contract, whose \"economic terms and conditions\" reproduced those of the SPA; by the time NMM was constituted on 25 July 2001, Quiborax had disbursed USD 380,000 of the total USD 400,000 purchase price.\n\nExh. CD-24, pp. 1, 3 and 5.\n\n147.\n\nAs of May 2001, Quiborax ceased making payment for the balance of the USD 400,000 purchase price to Edsal Finance, and instead began to issue payments in favor of Alvaro Ugalde. This is one of the reasons why the Respondent took \"issue [\u2026] with these checks.\"181 Indeed, Quiborax made payments to Edsal Finance for a total of USD 250,000, whereas it paid the balance of USD 150,000 to Alvaro Ugalde.182 The Tribunal sees no issue here because, first and foremost, the key point is that Quiborax continued making the payments due under the May 2001 Contract for the purpose of acquiring the mining concessions that would be transferred to a new corporation. To whom exactly Quiborax made the payments is not relevant so long as it is clear that the payments were made pursuant to the May 2001 Contract.\n\nTr. 29:20-30:6.\n\nExh. CD-116, payments to Edsal Finance Inc. (pp. 1-4) and payments to Alvaro Ugalde (pp. 59).\n\n148.\n\nAdditionally, there appears to be no contradiction between the change of payee and the evidence on record. In fact, Edsal Finance was a party to the SPA, but not to the May 2001 Contract. Alvaro Ugalde was not a party to the SPA, but was bound by the terms of the May 2001 Contract.183 This may well explain why all the payments made after the 10 May 2001 Contract were made to Alvaro Ugalde and not to Edsal Finance. It is true that under the May 2001 Contract the seller was R\u00edo Grande, not Alvaro Ugalde.184 However, the record suggests that Alvaro Ugalde was the ultimate seller and thus the ultimate beneficiary of the payments - except for the 0.5% of shares held by his brother Gonzalo.185\n\nExh. CD-104, clause eleventh, p. 5.\n\n*Id.*, at clause fourth, p. 2.\n\nThere appears to be ample evidence on record that Alvaro Ugalde was the ultimate seller and the person with whom Quiborax dealt throughout the transaction. Alvaro Ugalde signed the letter that constitutes the first documented contact between R\u00edo Grande and Quiborax (letter of 26 January 2000). It was also him who executed both the Exclusive Supply Agreement of 12 January 2001 - on behalf of R\u00edo Grande - (Exh. CD-16) and the SPA of 12 March 2001 - this time on behalf of Edsal Finance Inc. and of his brother Gonzalo (Exh. CD-17). Although not a signatory of the May 2001 Contract, clause eleventh provides that its terms \"bind Alvaro Ugalde in all of its parts\" (Exh. CD-104). Within days of the execution of the May 2001 Contract, Alvaro Ugalde wrote to Quiborax to follow up on the terms of the new contract and with the apparent goal of completing the transaction. The fact that Alvaro Ugalde, rather than Edsal Finance Inc., began to receive Quiborax payments for the balance of the purchase price as of May 2001 is but one additional piece of evidence corroborating that he was the ultimate seller and beneficiary of the sale of the mining concessions to Quiborax. It also appears that Alvaro Ugalde received payment from Quiborax on behalf of his brother Gonzalo, who owned 0.5% of the shares of R\u00edo Grande.\n\n149.\n\nBetween 2 and 17 August 2001, R\u00edo Grande and NMM supposedly adopted the corporate steps necessary to complete the transfer of the mining concessions to Quiborax, in accordance with the terms of the May 2001 Contract as modified by the 51/49 agreement. Specifically, on 2 August 2001, R\u00edo Grande approved the transfer of its seven mining concessions to NMM, as shown by the minutes and a notarized version of the concessions.186 On that same day in the afternoon, R\u00edo Grande allegedly \"decided to sell and transfer in favor of [Quiborax] the share certificates to be issued by [NMM] in favor of [R\u00edo Grande] as a result of the latter's contribution of seven mining concessions.\"187\n\nExhs. CD-107 and CD-108.\n\nExh. CD-109. There seems to be a contradiction between the May 2001 Contract (as modified by the 51-49 Agreement) and R\u00edo Grande's minutes of 2 August 2001 (14:30 PM) (Exh. CD-109). Indeed, under the May 2001 Contract, R\u00edo Grande would \"sell[] and transfer[] to Quiborax 50% of all [\u2026] mining concessions.\" Yet, the minutes of 2 August 2001(14:30 PM) suggest that R\u00edo Grande would \"sell and transfer\" to Quiborax virtually 100% of the mining concessions, as Quiborax would receive, as it eventually did, all \"the share certificates to be issued by [NMM] in favor of [R\u00edo Grande]\", representing nearly 100% of the NMM shares (26,680 out of a total of 26,740 shares). However, the contradiction is apparent only: whilst Quiborax would receive nearly 100% of the NMM shares, it eventually redistributed them in a way that was consistent with the terms of the May 2001 Contract, as modified by the 51-49 Agreement. The Tribunal does not consider that this is in any way an indication that Quiborax or Allan Fosk fabricated their status as shareholders of NMM.\n\n150.\n\nOn 3 August 2001, NMM approved R\u00edo Grande's contribution of the seven mining concessions and authorized a capital increase of 26,680 shares, as evidenced by both a copy and a notarized version of the minutes.188 This brought the total number of NMM shares to 26,740 - 60 original shares plus the approved 26,680 shares. In the meantime, on 8 August 2001, less than a week after R\u00edo Grande approved the sale of its NMM shares to Quiborax, Quiborax would have made the last payment of the total USD 400,000 purchase price stipulated in the May 2001 Contract.189 Again, the timing of this payment tallies with the Claimants' general account of the facts.190\n\nExhs. CD-110 and CD-25.\n\nExh. CD-116, p. 9.\n\nIndeed, this last payment took place after R\u00edo Grande's 2 August afternoon approval of the sale of its NMM shares to Quiborax, but before that transfer materialized on 17 August 2001. While the last payment for USD 20,000 on 8 August (preceded by a USD 30,000 payment on 18 July) was not exactly in accordance with the payment schedule reflected in the SPA and later adopted in the May 2001 Contract, which would have called for a USD 50,000 payment on 21 July, this change in the payment schedule appears to be of no consequence; indeed none of the Parties has raised any issue with it.\n\n151.\n\nOn 15 August 2001, the minutes show that NMM issued 26,680 shares in favor of R\u00edo Grande.191 As a result, on 17 August 2001, R\u00edo Grande received 26,680 shares of NMM, a transfer reflected in both the shareholders registry192 and on share certificate No. 4.193 It is not in dispute that R\u00edo Grande received 26,680 shares of NMM. On the contrary, the Respondent's position is that R\u00edo Grande *did* receive those NMM shares194, but that those shares were never transferred to Quiborax - an allegation which by implication challenges the veracity of R\u00edo Grande's decision taken in the afternoon of 2 August to \"sell and transfer\" the NMM shares to Quiborax.\n\nExh. CD-111.\n\nExh. CD-24.\n\nExh. CD-105. This is one of the share certificates for which only a copy is available.\n\nThis is presumably the reason why the Respondent has contended that the 2001 balance sheet of NMM and the 2003 balance sheet of R\u00edo Grande, which would show that R\u00edo Grande still holds all these NMM shares even after the alleged transfer to Quiborax, \"have considerable probative value\" (Reply, \u00b6 39).\n\n152.\n\nAs soon as R\u00edo Grande received the newly issued shares from NMM, it purportedly transferred them in their entirety to Quiborax on the same day, as documented in the minutes of the extraordinary shareholders' meeting of NMM dated 17 August 2001, the shareholders registry, and the endorsement on share certificate No. 4 in favor of \"Qu\u00edmica e Industrial del B\u00f3rax Ltd.\"195 The Respondent has questioned the authenticity of all three documents: the NMM minutes of 17 August 2001196, the shareholders registry197 and the share certificates.198 These allegations of fraud will be examined later in greater detail.\n\nExh. CD-105, p. 7.\n\nOJ, \u00b6 141.\n\nReply, \u00b6 100.\n\n*Id*., at \u00b6 122.\n\n153.\n\nOn 21 August 2001, NMM applied to the Commercial Registry - *Senarec* at the time -to obtain approval for the capital increase following R\u00edo Grande's contribution of the seven mining concessions.199 The *Senarec* approved NMM's capital increase as well as \"the admission as new shareholder of R\u00edo Grande.\"200 The Respondent claims that Quiborax should have been mentioned in NMM's application because, by that time, R\u00edo Grande's shares had supposedly been transferred to Quiborax.201 The Tribunal cannot agree. The purpose of NMM's application to the *Senarec* was to request approval of its capital increase, not of R\u00edo Grande's share transfer to Quiborax.202 Thus, there was no reason for NMM to mention Quiborax in its application to the *Senarec*.\n\nNMM's application stated that \"it was resolved to increase the capital of [NMM] with the contribution of seven mining concessions [\u2026] by the new shareholder [R\u00edo Grande]\" (Exh. R-125).\n\nExh. R-126.\n\nOJ, \u00b6 80; Reply, \u00b6 44.\n\nIn fact, the share transfer between R\u00edo Grande and Quiborax was a private transaction for which no government approval appeared to be required.\n\n154.\n\nOn 4 September 2001, Quiborax allegedly transferred to David Moscoso 50% of the total NMM shares (26,740 shares) in two sets: one set of 267 shares (1% of the total NMM shares) and one set of 13,103 shares (49% of the total). These transfers are documented in two endorsements on share certificate No. 4, and in the issuance of new certificates Nos. 5 (for 267 shares) and 6 (for 13,103 shares). On the same day, Mr. Moscoso would have transferred the set of 267 shares back to Quiborax in exchange for USD 9,985, as reflected in the endorsement of share certificate No. 5 and in a check dated 27 September 2001. Allan Fosk, on behalf of Quiborax, apparently attached this check to the following letter addressed to Mr. Moscoso on 28 September 2001:\n\n\"Dear Mr. Moscoso,\n\nWe hereby enclose [a] check [\u2026] in the amount of USD 9,985.00 to pay the balance [for] endorsement of shares of [NMM].\n\nAllan Fosk\n\n[Quiborax].\"203\n\nExh. CD-117.\n\n155.\n\nThe Respondent has referred to this series of operations as \"absurd\" because Quiborax first transferred two sets of shares to Mr. Moscoso for free, only for Mr. Moscoso to transfer the set of 267 shares back to Quiborax for a fee of USD 9,985. The Tribunal cannot agree. These operations are consistent with both the May 2001 Contract and the 51/49 agreement. Under the May 2001 Contract, R\u00edo Grande was to transfer 50% of the mining concessions to David Moscoso204 - as it turned out, via the shares of a newly-created corporation.205 Thus, Mr. Moscoso was entitled to receive 50% of the shares of NMM, that is, 13,370 shares - the exact amount of shares he received from Quiborax combining the two sets.206 By the same token, Quiborax had no right to keep those NMM shares. Thus, it does not appear that the Claimants' version of the facts is absurd or even inconsistent on this point.\n\nExh. CD-104, fifth clause, p. 2.\n\nAs previously analyzed, the May 2001 Contract contemplated that ownership over the mining concessions would be transferred via a new corporation or a joint venture contract (Exh. CD-104, clause sixth).\n\nCM, \u00b6\u00b6 47-48.\n\n156.\n\nOn the other hand, under the 51/49 agreement, Quiborax was to acquire an additional 1% from Mr. Moscoso to become the majority shareholder of NMM. This would explain why Quiborax transferred the NMM shares to David Moscoso in two sets: the 1% set of shares was presumably \"earmarked\" for purposes of completing the 51/49 agreement. One may wonder why R\u00edo Grande transferred all of its NMM shares to Quiborax rather than allocating 50% of them directly to David Moscoso. This question, however, bears no relevance for purposes of ascertaining the key issue under examination: whether Quiborax and Allan Fosk acquired shares in NMM. In sum, the Tribunal finds that the series of share transfers between Quiborax and Moscoso are consistent with the Claimants' account of events and the evidentiary record.\n\n157.\n\nOn 10 September 2001, the final steps in the shareholding configuration of NMM took place, with five new share certificates - 7 to 11 - being issued on that day. The new certificate No. 7 appears to have been issued to Quiborax for a total of 13,577 shares.207 In addition, Gilka Salas endorsed her one share to Allan Fosk, as shown in new share certificate No. 8208 (1 share), whereas Fernando Rojas (58 shares) and Teresa Paredes (1 share) endorsed their NMM shares to Quiborax, as shown in new certificate No. 9 (59 shares). The new share certificate No. 7 was then cancelled and replaced by two new share certificates: share certificates No. 10 (for 13,310 shares) and No. 11 (for 267 shares).209\n\nThis figure was presumably the sum of two different transfers: one from R\u00edo Grande (endorsement of 13,310 shares) and one from David Moscoso (endorsement of 267 shares). As share certificate No. 4 shows, R\u00edo Grande endorsed 26,680 shares to Quiborax, which in turn endorsed 13,103 shares (49%) and 267 (1%) to David Moscoso, keeping for itself the balance of 13,310 shares (resulting from the following arithmetical operation: 26,680 - 13,103 -267 = 13,310).\n\nWhilst the Claimants stated in their letter to ICSID of 5 January 2006 that Allan Fosk had paid USD 9,985 for his one and only NMM share, the Claimants later clarified that this was the sum Quiborax paid to David Moscoso for 1% of the shares in NMM. Allan Fosk, by contrast, does not appear to have made any payment to receive his one share in NMM (Exh. R-93; CM, p. 22, n. 70).\n\nThe Respondent submitted that cancelling new share certificate No. 7 in order to issue two new share certificates - 10 and 11 - is \"one of a number of irregularities\" that would call into question the authenticity of the NMM share certificates (Tr. 55:13-16). It is unclear why exactly share certificate No. 7 was cancelled and two new share certificates issued instead. It could be that it was to \"earmark\" the one percent set of shares that would confer a majority position to Quiborax, as happened with the transfers between Quiborax and David Moscoso. At any rate, in the absence of additional evidence, the Tribunal is not persuaded that this is a sign that the share certificates are not authentic. This issue, however, will be examined at greater length in the section dealing with Respondent's account of events.\n\n158.\n\nTherefore, the Claimants allege that the final shareholding composition of NMM as of 10 September 2001 was the following: Quiborax held 16,636 shares (50,995% of NMM shares); David Moscoso held 13,103 shares (49%); and Allan Fosk held 1 share (0,005%).210 Thus, Quiborax and Allan Fosk would collectively have become majority shareholders of NMM. It would appear that, contrary to the Respondent's allegation, the Claimants present one - not three211 - versions of the facts: that Quiborax purchased shares in NMM, and Allan Fosk received one share in NMM, in order to obtain, as shareholders of NMM, a participation in R\u00edo Grande's mining concessions.\n\nCM, \u00b6 56.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, \"[t]he Claimants' pleadings include up to three different factual accounts\": (i) Quiborax acquired NMM shares from R\u00edo Grande, (ii) Quiborax acquired shares in R\u00edo Grande, and (iii) Quiborax acquired 50% of the mining concessions (Reply, \u00b6 9). The Claimants' account is in fact a mixture of (i) and (iii): Quiborax acquired shares in NMM from R\u00edo Grande in order to secure an ownership interest in the mining concessions - its ultimate goal. The Respondent's suggestion that the evidence would show that Quiborax acquired shares in R\u00edo Grande seems to disregard evidence that this transaction was subsequently left without effect (Exhs. CD-145, CD-146, CD-105, CD-18, CD-144).\n\n159.\n\nIn October 2001, Quiborax declared to the Chilean Internal Revenue Service (the \"Chilean IRS\") its \"investments\" in Bolivia.212 The Chilean IRS issued a certificate, dated 27 October 2010, stating that \"on 29 October 2001\"213 Quiborax advised of its \"investments in the company [NMM] [\u2026] located in [Bolivia].\"214 These \"investments\" correspond exactly, in both dates and amounts, with the previously examined checks that Quiborax issued in favor of Edsal Finance, Alvaro Ugalde and David Moscoso.215 On 13 December 2001, R\u00edo Grande's transfer of its seven mining concessions to NMM was registered with the Mining Registry216 and on 19 December 2001 with the Real Property Registry.217\n\nExh. CD-141. The Claimants allege that at the time Quiborax would also have registered its investment with the Central Bank of Chile (Exh. CD-138; CM, \u00b6 76). However, because the Central Bank's certificate does not state *when* Quiborax provided the information reflected in that certificate, it is not possible to determine whether it is contemporaneous or post-dispute evidence, which considerably reduces its probative value.\n\n*Id*.\n\n*Id*.\n\nExhs. CD-116, CD-117 and CD-141.\n\nSalame ER I, Annex 12.\n\nExh. R-181.\n\n160.\n\nOn the basis of this examination, the Tribunal cannot but observe that the Claimants' account of events and evidence appear consistent and plausible. Having reached this preliminary assessment, it will now turn to review Bolivia's understanding of the facts and related evidence before reaching a definitive conclusion.\n\n*(iv) Respondent's account and evidence of the events*\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n161.\n\nBolivia argues that the Claimants' account of events is a \"sham\" and that, as in *Cementownia v. Turkey*, the transaction which allegedly constituted the investment \"never took place.\"218 In other words, Quiborax and Allan Fosk did not become shareholders of NMM in August and September 2001, were not shareholders of NMM at the time the dispute arose in June 2004, and are thus not \"investors\" under the Treaty. Instead, the Claimants fabricated evidence purporting to show that Quiborax and Allan Fosk became shareholders of NMM in 2001 in order to fraudulently create the conditions to gain access to ICSID jurisdiction.219\n\nTr. 22:16-20.\n\nOJ, \u00b6 14; Reply, \u00b6 13.\n\n162.\n\nThe Respondent argues (i) that there is no evidence that Quiborax and Allan Fosk acquired the majority of NMM shares in August and September 2001220; (ii) that the facts and documents that predate the origin of the dispute in June 2004 show that Quiborax and Allan Fosk did not become majority shareholders of NMM in August and September of 2001221; and (iii) that the evidence upon which the Claimants rely has no probative value because it consists of internal documents that were fabricated after the dispute arose.222 The Claimants have, in short, failed to shoulder their burden of proving that they are \"investors\" under the Treaty.\n\nOJ, \u00a7\u00a7 2.1.1.2 - 2.1.1.3.\n\n*Id.*, at \u00a7 2.1.2.\n\n*Id.*, at \u00a7 2.2.\n\n163.\n\nIn the first place, Bolivia asserts that the Claimants have failed to submit evidence that Quiborax and Allan Fosk acquired shares in NMM. In particular, there is no evidence of \"registrations, declarations and payments that should have been produced, had Quiborax and Allan Fosk really acquired the majority of the shares of NMM in August and September of 2001.\"223\n\n*Id.*, at \u00a7 2.1.1.3, p. 19 (Tribunal's translation).\n\n164.\n\nThe Respondent maintains that there is no \"physical trace\" of the share transfers, either in the form of endorsements of the original share certificates or of registrations and explanatory annotations in the shareholders registry.224 However, the Tribunal notes that the Claimants have submitted copies of the shareholders registry225 and, since Bolivia filed its objections to jurisdiction, both copies226 and originals of the endorsed and new NMM share certificates. Hence, it appears that the Claimants have submitted evidence and \"physical traces\" of the process by which Quiborax and Allan Fosk would have acquired the NMM shares.\n\n*Id.*, at \u00b6 60.\n\nExh. CD-24.\n\nExh. CD-105.\n\n165.\n\nBolivia further argues that Quiborax should have registered the power of attorney of its legal representative with the Commercial Registry in order to validly acquire shares in NMM, but that there is no evidence that it did so.227 In the Tribunal's view, whilst this issue could be relevant to determine whether Quiborax made its investment in accordance with Bolivian law, it is indifferent to determine whether Quiborax *as a matter of fact* acquired shares in NMM.\n\nOJ, \u00b6\u00b6 61-62.\n\n166.\n\nBolivia also contends that there is no evidence that the Claimants complied with the bylaws of NMM. According to these bylaws, NMM shares must first be offered in writing to its own shareholders before being sold to third parties such as Quiborax or Allan Fosk; yet, there is no evidence that this procedure was followed. The Respondent appears to rely on Article 14 of NMM's bylaws.228 In the Tribunal's view, the application of this right of first refusal to a transaction that both predated the bylaws229 and constituted the very purpose for the creation of NMM would make little sense.230 In addition, whether the procedure for a right of first refusal was followed or not has no impact on the question of whether Quiborax and Allan Fosk as a matter of fact acquired shares in NMM.\n\nRFA, Exh. C-9, Art. 14, p. 13.\n\nThe May 2001 Contract (Exh. CD-104) was executed before the date on which NMM was incorporated and its bylaws passed on 25 July 2001 (RFA, Exh. C-9).\n\nThe same considerations would apply with respect to Bolivia's argument that R\u00edo Grande's transfer of NMM shares to Quiborax would also have breached Article 14 of NMM's bylaws because it was a sale to a third-party with a \"competing activity\" (RFA, Exh. C-9, Art. 14, p. 15.). Since the purpose of NMM would have been precisely to enable Quiborax to become the majority shareholder as a result of a pre-existing agreement, this internal rule would have no effect on R\u00edo Grande's transfer to Quiborax.\n\n167.\n\nAs a further argument, the Respondent maintains that there is no evidence that the Claimants paid the taxes to which they would have been subject had Quiborax and Allan Fosk become shareholders of NMM in 2001. Specifically, Quiborax and Allan Fosk should have paid taxes on any dividends received from NMM, but there is no evidence of these payments.231 The record, however, shows otherwise. NMM first declared dividends on 3 December 2003.232 Taxes on dividends distributed to Quiborax appear to have been paid on 21 July and 21 October 2004, and taxes on dividends distributed to Allan Fosk appear to have been paid on 21 July 2004.233 Hence, these allegations do not tend to disprove that Quiborax and Allan Fosk acquired shares of NMM in 2001.234\n\nOJ, \u00b6\u00b6 64-68.\n\nExh. CD-118.2; Rej., \u00b6\u00b6 37(o), 62, 121-122.\n\nExh. CD-149, attaching form F-54 dated 21 July 2004; Exh. CD-150, attaching form F-54 dated 21 October 2004. On a letter to Quiborax dated 18 August 2004, PricewaterhouseCoopers noted that the F-54 form of 21 July 2004 included the taxes on dividends of both Quiborax and \"A. Fosk\" (Exh. CD-149).\n\nThe Respondent further asserts that, had R\u00edo Grande transferred its shares in NMM to Quiborax for free, there should be a record of the payment of the Free Transfer Tax - but there is no such record (Reply, \u00b6 49). The Tribunal does not understand the Claimants to be alleging that R\u00edo Grande transferred its shares in NMM for free, but rather for a price of USD 400,000 (Exh. CD-17 and CD-104). Since the transfer was for a price, this would dispose of the Respondent's argument that a free transfer would amount to fraud to R\u00edo Grande's creditors (Reply, p. 20; Tr. 39:8-15). At any rate, the Tribunal considers that any allegation that the Claimants failed to pay taxes or committed fraud may be relevant for the analysis of the legality requirement, but not to determine whether in actuality Quiborax and Allan Fosk acquired shares in NMM.\n\n168.\n\nIn the second place, the Respondent states that the facts and documents that predate the origin of the dispute in June 2004 show that Quiborax and Allan Fosk did not become majority shareholders of NMM in August and September of 2001.\n\n169.\n\nBolivia alleges that NMM could only have issued new shares to R\u00edo Grande after the transfer of the mining concessions to NMM had been registered with the Mining Registry and the Real Property Registry, and after NMM's capital increase had been authorized by the Commercial Registry.235 However, because none of these steps had taken place by 17 August 2001, R\u00edo Grande's transfer of NMM shares to Quiborax was \"legally\" and \"materially impossible.\"236 In the Tribunal's opinion, the legal effects of these requirements might be relevant in the context of the illegality objection. They are by contrast not relevant for the purpose of ascertaining whether Quiborax and Allan Fosk acquired shares in NMM or whether these transactions were fraudulently fabricated after the dispute arose.237\n\nOJ, \u00b6\u00b6 74-83.\n\n*Id.*, at \u00b6\u00b6 79, 83.\n\nThe Respondent has argued that, on account of these alleged registration and approval deficiencies, Quiborax acquired \"inexistent shares\" (OJ, \u00b6 79). This raises the issue whether the shares that Quiborax acquired from R\u00edo Grande have *legal* existence, *i.e*. whether the legal effects of this transaction are recognized under Bolivian law. This is different from the factual and antecedent question of whether the parties in actuality entered into such a transaction -which is disputed by the Respondent and is the gist of its fraud allegation. This is a *factual* inquiry: whether Quiborax genuinely entered into the May 2001 Contract with R\u00edo Grande, subsequently into the 51/49 Agreement, issued checks in favor of Edsal Finance Inc., Alvaro Ugalde and David Moscoso, and received endorsed and new share certificates of NMM - in short, whether Quiborax and Allan Fosk acquired shares in NMM.\n\n170.\n\nBolivia also points out that NMM's audited balance sheet for the year 2001, as well as R\u00edo Grande's audited balance sheet of September 2003, show that R\u00edo Grande still owned the NMM shares that it was supposed to have transferred to Quiborax on 17 August 2001.238 In Bolivia's submissions, this disproves that Quiborax and Allan Fosk acquired shares of NMM in 2001. The Claimants retort that this was \"just a mistake.\"239 The record also shows that Quiborax's financial statements for 2001240, 2002241, 2003242 and 2004243, audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers, indicate that Quiborax held a 50.99% participation in NMM. More specifically, Quiborax's 2001 and 2002 financial statements expressly note that it \"acquired 50.99% of Bolivian corporation [NMM]\" during the fiscal year 2001.244 This would suggest that NMM's and R\u00edo Grande's balance sheets were simply mistaken. The Tribunal will for the time being flag this issue and only reach a definitive conclusion at the end of its analysis.\n\nExhs. R-124, R-127; OJ, \u00b6\u00b6 69-70, 88-91.\n\nAt the hearing, Counsel for the Claimants stated that they bore no responsibility for R\u00edo Grande's mistake, as the Claimants neither controlled nor managed R\u00edo Grande (Tr. 538:6-12; CM, p. 22, n. 67). With respect to NMM's alleged mistake, Counsel argued that the balance sheets recorded the capital increase, but not the change in shareholding composition (Tr. 538:13-18), and that the \"purpose of financial statements is not to reflect\" who the shareholders are (Rej., \u00b6 63).\n\nNavigant Report, Annex NCI-30.\n\n*Id*., at Annex NCI-31.\n\n*Id*., at Annex NCI-32.\n\n*Id*., at Annex NCI-33.\n\n*Id*., at Annexes NCI-30 and NCI-31.\n\n171.\n\nBolivia posits that NMM's two powers of attorney registered with the Commercial Registry between 2001 and 2003 show that NMM only had Bolivian shareholders.245 The reason would be that these powers of attorney incorporate the minutes of NMM's ordinary shareholders' meeting of 11 September 2001, where R\u00edo Grande - and not Quiborax or Allan Fosk - appears as shareholder of NMM. Nevertheless, those very same powers of attorney lend substantial support to the Claimants' version that Quiborax and Allan Fosk acquired shares of NMM in 2001. The first power of attorney of 27 September 2001 is in favor of Allan Fosk246; the second power of attorney of 1 July 2002 is in favor of Omar Le\u00f3n247, a Chilean national and employee of Quiborax.248 Again, the Tribunal flags this matter and will return to it at the end of its analysis.\n\nExhs. R-129 and R-130.\n\nExh. R-129, pp. 7-9.\n\nExh. R-130, pp. 2-4.\n\nExh. CD-27 shows that Omar Le\u00f3n has a \"Chilean passport\"; Exh. CD-59 demonstrates that Omar Le\u00f3n has indeed acted on behalf of NMM. The Respondent has not otherwise denied the Claimants' allegation that Omar Le\u00f3n was an employee of Quiborax.\n\n172.\n\nThird, Bolivia contends that the evidence upon which the Claimants rely has no probative value because it consists of purely internal documents that only became known after the dispute arose. The Claimants fabricated this evidence after the dispute arose in order to fraudulently manufacture the conditions for ICSID jurisdiction.\n\n173.\n\nDespite the Respondent's allegations to the contrary, the Tribunal notes that the Claimants do rely on public evidence predating the origin of the dispute in June 2004. On 15 April 2004, NMM updated its registration file with the Commercial Register, and the updated file shows Allan Fosk as legal representative of NMM.249 On 31 May 2004, NMM registered with the Commercial Registry a power of attorney which incorporates the minutes of a shareholders' meeting of 27 January 2003 where Quiborax, Allan Fosk and David Moscoso feature as the shareholders of NMM.250 In addition, the notarized version of this power of attorney bears a stamp of the Commercial Register dated 2 June 2004.251\n\nExh. CD-119.\n\nExh. CD-158 and CD-118.1. While it may be that Allan Fosk was not physically present in Bolivia on 27 January 2003 as the minutes represent, the essential point is that there is a public record, predating the dispute where Quiborax and Allan Fosk are mentioned as the shareholders of NMM.\n\nExh. CD-120, p. 6.\n\n174.\n\nThe Respondent maintains that the shareholders registry does not constitute the only means of proving shareholder status252 - an argument the Tribunal has already accepted. Specifically, it alleges that the NMM shareholders registry is a purely internal document that did not become known until 31 January 2005 and whose only \"authenticated\" version was issued by Isaac Frenkel, a shareholder of Quiborax and the Fosk family lawyer, on 27 January 2009.253 Moreover, the shareholders registry presents \"various irregularities\": blank spaces, missing information, and inconsistent entries.254 Finally, the *Superintendencia's* conclusion that Quiborax and Allan Fosk were shareholders of NMM is wrong because its analysis was based exclusively on the faulty shareholders registry.255\n\nOJ, \u00b6 123; Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 97-99, 102-111.\n\nOJ, \u00b6 122.\n\n*Id*., at \u00b6 124; Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 100-101.\n\nOJ, \u00b6 126.\n\n175.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, the probative value of the NMM shareholders registry is equivocal. On the one hand, Bolivia's own *Superintendencia* concluded that the NMM shareholders registry \"complies with all the requirements provided for in Article 250 of the Commercial Code.\"256 On the other hand, it is true that the NMM shareholders registry is an intra-corporate document over whose content the Claimants had unfettered control, at least until the onset of the criminal case. Furthermore, the originals of this registry have never been produced and its whereabouts appear to be unknown.257 Lastly, the shareholders registry has not been certified by an independent third-party, but by Isaac Frenkel, a \"minority shareholder of Quiborax and the Fosk family lawyer\" according to the Claimants' own description.258\n\nExh. CD-72, p. 3.\n\nThe Claimants have alleged that Bolivia is in possession of NMM shareholders registry (Tr. 299:8-14, 301:10-16); Respondent \"dispute[d] that\" allegation (Tr. 301:5-8). Whilst the record would suggest that the shareholders registry is part of the Bolivian criminal case, it is ultimately unnecessary to determine who currently holds the shareholders registry in order to decide the issues before the Tribunal.\n\nRej., \u00b6 37(e). This does not mean that the Claimants were required to have the shareholders registry certified by an independent third party, but only that the \"in-house\" certification of a document over which they had full control did not bolster its probative value.\n\n176.\n\nTaking these considerations into account, the Tribunal will attach limited intrinsic probative value to the NMM shareholders registry. At the same time, it considers that it remains a piece of evidence that may serve to confirm or disprove the other evidence on record. From this perspective, the Tribunal considers that the NMM shareholders registry generally tallies with the Claimants' account of events and evidence and, in particular, with the May 2001 Contract, the 51/49 agreement, the checks issued to Edsal Finance, Alvaro Ugalde, and David Moscoso, and the NMM share certificates. On the whole, the Tribunal deems that the NMM's shareholders registry tends to confirm the Claimants' thesis.\n\n177.\n\nLikewise, Bolivia disputes the veracity of the NMM share certificates, which were subject to document inspection upon its request, on a number of grounds.259 Bolivia supports its allegation on the following grounds: (i) there is no evidence that the share certificates were created before the dispute arose in June 2004260; (ii) the share certificates are purely internal documents261; (iii) the signature of Dolly Paredes does not tally with her signature on other documents - a \"sign of fraud\"262; (iv) oddly enough, the share certificates were first endorsed, and then cancelled and reissued on the same day263; (v) finally, it is perplexing that Quiborax transferred two sets of shares (267 and 13,103 shares) to David Moscoso for free, only for Mr. Moscoso to then transfer the set of 267 shares back to Quiborax for a price of USD 9,985.264\n\nWith respect to the share certificates, Bolivia also argued (i) that it was telling that the Claimants had not submitted the original share certificates Nos. 1-7, and (ii) that it was similarly telling that Quiborax and Allan Fosk had acquired the shares via new share certificates when they could have acquired them by endorsement (OJ, \u00b6\u00b6 131-132). Since then, however, the Claimants have submitted share certificates Nos. 1-7, which show that Quiborax and Allan Fosk initially acquired their share by endorsement. Thus, the Tribunal considers that this argument has become moot.\n\nOJ, \u00b6 133. Bolivia objected that the original share certificates had not been submitted (Reply, \u00b6 118). Since then, however, the Claimants submitted the original share certificates of NMM - except for share certificates Nos. 4 and 6. The Claimants explained that they did not submit the originals of share certificates Nos. 4 and 6 because they did not \"have possession, control or custody\" of these certificates (Claimants' letter to ICSID of 17 February 2011). Considering that the Claimants produced the originals of the other nine share certificates, and that share certificates Nos. 4 and 6 were issued in the name of R\u00edo Grande and David Moscoso, respectively, the Tribunal finds this explanation acceptable and Bolivia's objection moot.\n\nReply, \u00b6 117.\n\nOJ, \u00b6 134; Reply, \u00b6 121.\n\nReply, \u00b6 119.\n\n*Id.*, at \u00b6 120.\n\n178.\n\nUpon the Respondent's request, the NMM share certificates were subject to inspection by document experts in order to ascertain their authenticity and date. With respect to the authenticity of the paper, Jean-Louis Cl\u00e9ment, the Respondent's own document expert, concluded that the \"authenticity of the paper of the [NMM] share certificates is unquestionable.\"265 In consonance with this conclusion, Albert Lyter III, the Claimants' document expert, concluded that \"[n]o evidence was found that the paper [of the share certificates] had been altered, manipulated, erased or in any way fabricated among all of the examined documents.\"266\n\nCl\u00e9ment, \u00a7 2.3 (Tribunal's translation).\n\nLyter ER, \u00a7 2.2, pp. 4-5.\n\n179.\n\nWith respect to the ink entries on the share certificates, Mr. Cl\u00e9ment deemed that the signature of the secretary, Dolly Paredes, was not the result of the emulation of an \"authentic signature\", a finding that tends to exclude the Respondent's forgery hypothesis.267 At the same time, he found that Dolly Paredes used \"three different pens\" to sign share certificates Nos. 7 to 11 on the same day, \"which would seem unlikely.\"268 It should be noted that although the Respondent also had the share certificates examined by handwriting expert Christine Jouishomme, her expert report was not filed into the record.\n\nCl\u00e9ment ER, \u00a7 3.2.1, p. 3.\n\n*Id.*, at \u00a7 3.3, p. 5.\n\n180.\n\nAlbert Lyter III in turn concluded that the \"ink formulations\" on the share certificates \"compare with a high degree of identity to standard ink formulations that were commercially available at the dates appearing on the documents, *i.e.* 2001.\"269 Mr. Lyter countered that Mr. Cl\u00e9ment's assertion to the effect that it \"would seem unlikely\" that the secretary would sign share certificates Nos. 7-11 on the same day using three different pens, \"is not based upon any scientific examinations, but on [his] personal assessment.\"270 Finally, Linda James, the Claimants' handwriting expert, concluded with \"the highest degree of confidence expressed by document examiners\" that the signatures of Fernando Rojas, Dolly Paredes, Gilka Salas and David Moscoso on the NMM share certificates were authentic.271\n\nLyter ER, \u00a7 4.2, p. 11. On cross-examination, Mr. Lyter admitted that these ink formulations were commercially available \"at any point after\" 2001, which would thus not exclude the possibility that the share certificates could have been fabricated after the dispute arose in June 2004 (Tr. 475:1-7). This piece of evidence is thus only relevant if examined in context.\n\n*Id.*, at \u00a7 4.3, p. 12.\n\nJames ER, p. 42.\n\n181.\n\nWith respect to the date on which the share certificates were created, Mr. Cl\u00e9ment concluded that \"it is impossible to date them\" because, being no more than 10 years old at most, \"they are too recent\" to ascertain that information.272 For his part, Mr. Lyter testified that there was no evidence that the NMM share certificates were not prepared in 200 1273, nor evidence suggesting they are inauthentic.274 Specifically, based on the commercial availability of ink formulations and the degree of dryness of the ink on the share certificates at the time of the examination275, Mr. Lyter testified that the share certificates could have been created anywhere between 2001 and 2006, but that they were \"probably\" created in 2001:\n\n**[Mr. Bofill]** : Mr. Silva Romero [Counsel for the Respondent] asked you whether it was possible that these shareholder titles were prepared in 2006 rather than in 2001, and your answer was that it was possible but not probable. What do you mean by that?\n\n**[Mr. Lyter]** : As an expert, we deal in probabilities [...] in asking the question is it possible these documents were prepared in 2006, the short answer is yes, that's possible [...] [b]ut we deal in probabilities, and the more appropriate question would be is it probable that these documents were prepared in 2006? And my answer to that would be no, it is not probable that they were done in 2006, based on all of the examination results [...].\n\n**[Mr. Bofill]** : Would this also be your answer if I ask you whether these documents were prepared in any year after 2001 ?\n\n**[Mr. Lyter]** : The answer would be yes, giving attention to the fact that the documents state on their face that they were done in 2001 [...] the inks, their formulas, their \"dryness\" [...] the pattern by which the various authors used ink formulations from one document to the next [...]\" (emphasis added).276\n\nCl\u00e9ment ER, \u00a7 4.2, p. 6.\n\nTr. 479:13-16.\n\n*Id.*, at 487:13-16.\n\nSince the ink formulations on the share certificates present a \"high degree of identity\" with standard ink formulations commercially available in 2001, that appears to be the earliest time in which the share certificates could have been created (Lyter ER, \u00a7 4.2, p. 11). Moreover, Mr. Lyter testified that a \"five-year time span\" would be the appropriate span to determine the dryness of the ink formulations on the NMM share certificates (Tr. 473:3-10). As the ink on the share certificates was fully dry by the date of their examination on 21 March 2011, this would mean that the share certificates could have been created at any time before 21 March 2006.\n\nTr. 480:2-481:13.\n\n182.\n\nThus, the Tribunal is satisfied that the expert inspection of the NMM share certificates has established (i) that the paper of the share certificates is authentic; (ii) that the signatures of Fernando Rojas, Dolly Paredes, Gilka Salas and David Moscoso are authentic with the highest degree of confidence expressed by document examiners; (iii) that they were probably created in 2001 and that there is no evidence suggesting otherwise; and (iv) that there is no evidence suggesting that the share certificates are spurious, as the finding that Dolly Paredes used three different ink formulations to sign the share certificates is insufficient to overcome the probative merits of the previous evidence. In sum, the weight of the expert evidence suggests that the NMM share certificates are authentic.\n\n183.\n\nAccordingly, contrary to what Bolivia argues, the expert evidence suggests that the NMM share certificates have probative value even though they are not public documents, in the sense of documents available in a public registry or database. In addition, as previously observed, Quiborax's transfer of shares to David Moscoso in two sets and Mr. Moscoso's transfer back to Quiborax of one of the set of 267 shares was consistent with the 51/49 agreement between them. Finally, although it may appear unnecessary to issue new share certificate No. 7, only to then cancel it and reissue two new share certificates in its stead (new share certificates Nos. 10 and 11), it is difficult to apprehend why this would be evidence of fraud, especially where all three share certificates were issued in favour of Quiborax.\n\n184.\n\nFurthermore, the Respondent claims that the minutes of the extraordinary shareholders' meeting of 17 August 2001, which would reflect the sale of R\u00edo Grande's shares in NMM to Quiborax, were fabricated for the following reasons277: (i) because NMM's capital increase had not been approved by that date, it was \"materially impossible\" for R\u00edo Grande to transfer its shares in NMM to Quiborax278; (ii) unlike the minutes where R\u00edo Grande was accepted as a new shareholder, notarized within two weeks from the date of their preparation279, the 17 August 2001 minutes were only notarized and registered in the Commercial Registry years later, once the Parties were in dispute280; (iii) and lastly, both the *Superintendencia*281 and the document expert in the Bolivian criminal proceedings282 found \"serious irregularities\"283 in NMM's minute book.\n\nOJ, \u00b6 143.\n\n*Id*., at \u00b6 144.\n\nExh. CD-25.\n\nExhs. R-140 and R-141; OJ, \u00b6\u00b6 145-146.\n\nExhs. CD-72 and R-143; OJ, \u00b6 147.\n\nExh. R-146.\n\nOJ, \u00b6 147.\n\n185.\n\nIn the first place, as the Tribunal previously remarked, what is relevant for purposes of this objection is whether R\u00edo Grande transferred shares to Quiborax, not whether that transfer was legally valid. In the second place, it is unclear to the Tribunal why having the minutes of 17 August 2001 notarized after the dispute arose would signal fraud, especially when the notarized copy itself does not purport to mislead in any way about the date on which those minutes were actually notarized. Finally, whilst the *Superintendencia* and the document expert in the Bolivian criminal proceedings found that NMM had mishandled the minute books, because individual pages had been torn out and glued, this is by far insufficient to prove fraud. All in all, the Tribunal is unconvinced that the minutes of 17 August 2001 were fabricated.284\n\nAs Bolivia conceded, the *Superintendencia* declined to penalize NMM for the mishandling of its minutes book, which would suggest that the irregularities committed were not so serious that they could not be rectified (Exh. R-143, p. 7; OJ, \u00b6 147(b)).\n\n186.\n\nSimilarly, the Respondent argues that the minutes of the ordinary shareholders' meeting of 13 September 2001 were fabricated because285: (i) these minutes do not tally with the minutes of 11 September 2001, which only lists Bolivian shareholders and was registered with the Commercial Register in 2001286; (ii) the records of the Chilean immigration authorities show that Allan Fosk was not in Bolivia on 13 September 2001 and thus could not have participated in that meeting287; (iii) Mr. Moscoso himself confessed in the Bolivian criminal case that these minutes were fabricated288; (iv) the signature of Dolly Paredes would appear to be forged; (v) Allan Fosk signed on behalf of Quiborax \"S.A.\" when it should have read \"Ltda.\"289; (vi) and finally, the document expert in the Bolivian case concluded that the minutes of 13 September 2001 did not tally with the document that was originally affixed to the minute book.290\n\nOJ, \u00b6 148.\n\n*Id*., at \u00b6\u00b6 150-153.\n\n*Id*., at \u00b6 154.\n\nExh. R-76; OJ, \u00b6 155.\n\nOJ, \u00b6\u00b6 156, 158.\n\n*Id.*, at \u00b6 157.\n\n187.\n\nThe Tribunal initially notes that, while the 11 September 2001 minutes include R\u00edo Grande rather than Quiborax as shareholder, the purpose of that meeting was to appoint the directors and trustees of NMM. Tellingly, the 11 September 2001 minutes show that two out of the three directors appointed to serve on the board of directors were directly related to Quiborax: Allan Fosk291 and Isaac Frenkel.292 Likewise, the substitute director, Carlos Shuffer, is also directly related to Quiborax.293 The only director who was *not* related to Quiborax was David Moscoso. This is consistent with the Claimants' factual account and would suggest that the mention of R\u00edo Grande as shareholder was merely a mistake, not the product of a fraudulent scheme.\n\nAllan Fosk is the \"Chief Financial Officer of Quibora\" and part of one of the two families that founded Quiborax (Mem., \u00b6\u00b6 20, 22).\n\nIsaac Frenkel \"is minority shareholder of Quiborax and the Fosk family lawyer\" (Rej., 37(e)).\n\nCarlos Shuffer is \"Manager of the Agrochemical Division at Quibora\" (Shuffer WS, \u00b6 1).\n\n188.\n\nOn the other hand, whilst Allan Fosk appears not to have been in Bolivia on 13 September 2001 according to the report of the Chilean immigration authorities, he was in Bolivia before, on 6-7 September, and thereafter, on 1-3 October, according to that same report.294 Mr. Fosk testified that \"perhaps [that] wasn't the precise date [13 September], but at some point in that period was when all the documentation was presented.\"295 Thus, although the minutes of 13 September were possibly misdated, the Tribunal does not believe this indicates fraud. Moreover, handwriting expert Linda James concluded that Dolly Paredes' signature was \"executed swiftly [...] which is a sign of genuineness\"296, and that her signature on these minutes presented \"common patterns\"297 with her other signatures on the NMM share certificates, which were found to be authentic \"with the highest degree of confidence expressed by document examiners.\"298\n\nExh. R-20.\n\nTr. 222:4-7.\n\nJames ER, pp. 31, 33.\n\n*Id*.\n\n*Id*., at p. 42.\n\n189.\n\nSimilarly, the Tribunal accepts that the document expert in the Bolivian criminal proceedings may be right in stating that some pages of NMM's minutes books were torn and that the 13 September minutes were glued. Yet, he does not consider that this in itself proves fraud. Nor does the Tribunal believe that the reference in the minutes to Quiborax \"S.A.\" as opposed to \"Ltda.\" suggests fraud. All these apparent or real deficiencies in the documents seem to reflect a somewhat careless but not unusual handling of documents, rather than a deliberate scheme to perpetrate fraud.\n\n190.\n\nIn addition, it is true that David Moscoso confessed that the minutes of 13 September were fabricated. However, considering the circumstances of this confession and the fact that Mr. Moscoso did not appear as a witness in this arbitration for crossexamination, the Tribunal considers that this confession carries little, if any, probative weight, especially when the other elements on record so solidly support the Claimants' account of events. All in all, the Tribunal is unconvinced that the minutes of 13 September 2001 were fabricated.\n\n191.\n\nFinally, in its Objections to Jurisdiction, the Respondent asserted that \"the appropriate evidence\" was the \"endorsement of the NMM shares and the resulting payment\"299: the Tribunal is satisfied that the Claimants have submitted adequate evidence of both. On the one hand, the NMM share certificates, which the weight of the expert evidence has shown to be authentic, provide adequate proof of the endorsements to Quiborax and Allan Fosk.300 On the other hand, the checks issued to Edsal Finance, Alvaro Ugalde and David Moscoso301, which match with the Claimants' factual account and evidence, constitute adequate proof of Quiborax's payment of the NMM shares.302\n\nOJ, \u00b6 123.\n\nExh. CD-105.\n\nExh. CD-116.\n\nIn the Reply, the Respondent also stated that the Claimants had failed to submit the \"fundamental document\" on which their entire factual account is based: the share purchase agreement between R\u00edo Grande and Quiborax (Reply, \u00b6 78). This appears to be inconsistent with its position in the Objections to Jurisdiction, where the Respondent advanced the proposition that the \"appropriate evidence\" was the endorsements and the payments. Be this as it may, the Tribunal believes that the May 2001 Contract (Exh. CD-104), the endorsements (Exh. CD-105) and the payments (Exh. CD-116) provide adequate documentary proof for the transfer of NMM shares from R\u00edo Grande to Quiborax on 17 August 2001.\n\n*(v) Conclusion*\n----------------\n\n192.\n\nOn the basis of its review of the entire record, the Tribunal finds that the Claimants' account of facts is consistent and well-documented. Whilst there are some documentary discrepancies - primarily the NNM's and R\u00edo Grande's balance sheets of 2001 and 2003, respectively, and the 11 September 2001 minutes -, these do not prove fraud nor suffice to overcome the plentiful evidence in support of the Claimants' case. For these reasons, the Tribunal is persuaded that Quiborax acquired and Allan Fosk received, respectively, 13,636 shares (50,995%) and 1 share (0,005%) of NMM in August and September of 2001, and that they did not engage in fraud or fabricate evidence to gain access to ICSID arbitration.\n\n1.3.2. Was NMM a Chilean national by reason of foreign control at the time the dispute arose in June 2004?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n193.\n\nThe Tribunal must now address whether NMM, which was incorporated in Bolivia, was a Chilean national at the time the dispute arose in June 2004. In accordance with Article 25(1) of the Convention, ICSID tribunals have jurisdiction over investment disputes between a Contracting State and \"a national of another Contracting State.\" Article 25(2) in turn provides that a \"national of another Contracting State\" includes:\n\n\"[A]ny juridical person which had the nationality of the Contracting State party to the dispute on that date [the date on which the parties consented to submit the dispute to arbitration] and which, because of foreign control, the parties have agreed should be treated as national of another Contracting State for the purposes of this Convention.\"\n\n194.\n\nThe Parties agree that Article X(4) of the Treaty further specifies who is a \"national of another Contracting State\" in the sense of Article 25(2) of the ICSID Convention. Article X(4) of the Treaty provides:\n\n\"For purposes of this Article, any legal person created in accordance with the laws of one of the Contracting Parties, and whose shares are majority-owned by investors of the other Contracting Party, shall be regarded, in accordance with Article 25.2).b) of the [ICSID] Convention, as a legal person of the other Contracting Party.\"\n\n195.\n\nHence, NMM shall be regarded as a Chilean national provided that it was majority-owned by Chilean investors at the time the dispute arose and at the time the parties consented to submit the dispute to arbitration. As the Tribunal previously concluded, Chilean nationals Quiborax and Allan Fosk collectively acquired 51% of the shares of NMM in August and September 2001 and still own these shares. Since a majority of the shares in NMM was held by Chilean investors at all relevant times, NMM must be deemed to be a Chilean national for jurisdictional purposes. Accordingly, NMM may act as a claimant in this arbitration.\n\n196.\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, the Tribunal has *ratione personae* jurisdiction over all three Claimants: Quiborax, Allan Fosk and NMM.\n\n**2. Second Objection: The Tribunal Lacks** ***Ratione Materiae*** **Jurisdiction Over the Dispute**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n2.1 Bolivia's Position\n----------------------\n\n2.1.1 The definition of \"investment\" under Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n197.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the Tribunal has no jurisdiction over the dispute because the Claimants have not made an \"investment\" in Bolivia within the meaning of Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention.303\n\nReply, \u00a7 5.\n\n198.\n\nThe meaning of the term \"investment\" is to be found in the BIT and the ICSID Convention.304 Thus, the definition of \"investment\" is subject to a double-test. The ICSID tribunals in *Salini v. Morocco*, *Saba Fakes v. Turkey* and *Global Trading v. Ukraine* have all endorsed the double-test.305 At any rate, \"the 'double test' issue is a false issue\"306 because \"there must be an objective definition of 'investment'\"307 in the field of international investment law. The rationale for an objective definition of \"investment\" is rooted in the need for legal certainty: \"[s]imply put, investors and [...] States need to know what investment means.\"308 In *Saba Fakes*, *GEA Group v. Ukraine*, *Romak v. Uzbekistan* and *Alps Finance v. Slovak Republic*, the tribunals endorsed an objective definition of \"investment.\"309\n\nROSS, p. 93.\n\n*Id*., at pp. 94-96.\n\nTr. 78:7-8.\n\n*Id.*, at 78:5-6.\n\n*Id.*, at 78:13-14.\n\nROSS, pp. 100-104.\n\n199.\n\nIn accordance with the Vienna Convention, this objective definition of \"investment\" is composed of the following six elements: (i) a contribution in money or other assets; (ii) duration; (iii) risk; (iv) a contribution to the economic development of the host State or an operation made in order to develop an economic activity in the host State; (v) made in accordance with the laws of the host State; and (vi) in good faith. All six elements must be cumulatively met.310 The elements of this objective definition derive from the decisions of ICSID tribunals in *Salini v. Morocco*, *Jan de Nul v. Arab Republic of Egypt* and *Phoenix v. Czech Republic*.311\n\n*Id*., at p. 109.\n\n*Id*., at pp. 106-108.\n\n2.1.2 The Claimants have not made an \"investment\" within the meaning of Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n200.\n\nThe Claimants have not met any of the six elements of the definition of investment. In particular, the Claimants have failed to prove that (i) they have made a contribution in money or assets, and that (ii) they have contributed to the economic development of the host State or an operation to develop an economic activity in the host State. Since the Respondent alleges that the Claimants did not make any contribution in Bolivia, \"the elements of duration and risk are indirectly also put into question.\"312 Finally, the Respondent also alleges that the Claimants have failed to comply with the laws of Bolivia and that they have acted in bad faith.313\n\nTr. 85:4-7.\n\nOJ, \u00a7 4.1; Reply, \u00a7 6; Tr. 85:17-19.\n\n201.\n\nSpecifically, the Claimants did not prove that they have made a contribution of money or assets in the territory of Bolivia - an element which both Parties agree is part of the objective definition of \"investment.\"314 The record is devoid of evidence that either Quiborax or Allan Fosk paid for the NMM shares they allegedly own. Similarly, there is no evidence that the Claimants contributed either know-how of the borate mining industry or a commercial network. As a matter of fact, a \"forensic analysis\" of the documents upon which the Claimants have relied shows that none of those documents establish a contribution of money or assets.315\n\nAt the hearing, Counsel for the Respondent stated that \"it is common ground between the Parties that a contribution in money or other assets is an element of the objective definition of 'investment'\" (Tr. 85:12-16).\n\nTr. 87:17-94:20.\n\n202.\n\nAdditionally, the Claimants have not proven that they contributed to the economic development of the area - an element which most ICSID tribunals recognize as part of the objective definition of \"investment.\"316 The video evidence and the \"forensic analysis\" show (i) that the Claimants made no investment in infrastructure and means of production; (ii) that the workers had no employment contracts, were employed on a temporary basis, often failed to receive salary payments, and used their own working tools; (iii) that the methods of operation were rudimentary; and (iv) that there was no contribution to the development of the community of Salar de Uyuni.317\n\nOJ, \u00b6 229.\n\n*Id.*, at \u00b6 230; Reply, \u00b6\u00b6190-191; Tr. 100:10-105:9.\n\n2.2 The Claimants' Position\n---------------------------\n\n2.2.1 Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention does not create a double-test and, at any rate, its meaning is not the one Respondent alleges\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n203.\n\nThe Claimants disagree with the Respondent's interpretation of Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention, but argue that they meet the definition of \"investment\" in any event under both the BIT and the ICSID Convention.\n\n204.\n\nThe Claimants posit that the \"investment\" test turns solely on the BIT. By contrast, Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention establishes no requirements \"over and above\" those of the BIT - there is no additional or double test.318 In the overwhelming majority of cases, the definition of \"investment\" in BITs will lie within the boundaries set by the ICSID Convention.319 Accordingly, the term \"investment\" in Article 25(1) provides at most a minimum threshold to determine whether the definition of \"investment\" in the BIT is \"so off the chart\" as to escape a common sense understanding of that term.320 In short, the definition of \"investment\" under the ICSID Convention defers to the BIT's definition of that term.321\n\nCM, \u00a7 III(2).\n\nRej., \u00b6 174.\n\n*Id*., at \u00b6\u00b6 165, 173.\n\nCM, \u00b6 109.\n\n205.\n\nIn the alternative, if the Tribunal considers that the ICSID Convention establishes an additional test, the Claimants argue that this test consists of only three elements: contribution in money or other assets, duration and risk.322 Specifically, the contribution to the economic development of the host State is not an element of the definition of \"investment\" under Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention. The recent case-law and scholarly writings show that this element is increasingly omitted from the *Salini* test.323 The decisions in *Saba Fakes* and *LESI v. Algeria,* for instance, disregarded this requirement, while focusing on the other three elements of the *Salini* test.324\n\nRej., \u00b6 186.\n\n*Id*., at \u00b6\u00b6 177-178.\n\n*Id*., at \u00b6\u00b6 181-182.\n\n2.2.2 The Claimants have made an \"investment\" within the meaning of the Treaty and of the ICSID Convention\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n206.\n\nIn any event, even if Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention contains an independent test, the Claimants argue that they have made an investment both under the BIT and under the ICSID Convention.325\n\nCM, \u00b6 122; Rej., \u00b6 186.\n\n207.\n\nFirst, the Claimants have made an investment under the BIT. Under Article I(2)(b) of the Treaty, Quiborax's and Allan Fosk's shares in NMM constitute an \"investment.\" Likewise, under Article I(2)(e) of the Treaty, the mining concessions owned by NMM, also constitute an investment.326 The Respondent does not dispute these conclusions - rather, it disputes the premise that Quiborax and Allan Fosk own shares in NMM or the mining concessions.327 Hence, Quiborax's and Allan Fosk's shares in NMM and the mining concessions owned by NMM, are an investment within the meaning of the BIT.328\n\nCM, \u00b6 94.\n\n*Id*., at \u00b6 95.\n\n*Id*.\n\n208.\n\nSecond. the Claimants have also made an \"investment\" under the ICSID Convention. As an initial matter, the Claimants made a contribution of money and assets: they purchased the initial seven mining concessions, subsequently obtained four additional concessions, committed resources and personnel to exploit these concessions, contributed their know-how of the borate mining industry and a global sales network.329 Furthermore, the Claimants' investment also met the elements of duration and risk. The Claimants exploited the mining concessions for three years and, had it not been for Bolivia's intervention, they would have exploited them for a forty-year period. As with any mining project, this project ran the risk of not being profitable.330\n\nCM, \u00b6 115; Rej., \u00b6\u00b6 187-190.\n\nCM, \u00b6\u00b6 116-117; Rej., \u00b6 191.\n\n209.\n\nFinally, the Claimants' investment also made a contribution to the development of the R\u00edo Grande area. It provided the area with an economic activity that resulted in the creation of stable jobs with regular pay, the execution of local transportation contracts, and the exploitation and exportation of natural resources.331 Even Respondent's video evidence shows that NMM provided employment opportunities.332 Further, the Claimants purchased a granulation plant, which they would have installed had it not been for Bolivia's intervention.333 NMM was also committed to establish good relations with the local community; it for instance helped to renovate the village church.334 In brief, the Claimants were committed to improve the standards of living of the workers and their families.335\n\nCM, \u00b6 119; Rej., \u00b6 197.\n\nCM, \u00b6 119.\n\nRej., \u00b6 197.\n\n*Id.*, at \u00b6 202.\n\n*Id.*, at \u00b6 203.\n\n2.3 Analysis\n------------\n\n210.\n\nBolivia does not contest that the Claimants have made an \"investment\" within the meaning of the BIT. Accordingly, the Tribunal must determine (i) whether Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention includes an investment test independent from, and thus additional to, the investment test of the BIT (2.3.1); (ii) in the affirmative, what the elements of the \"investment\" test of the ICSID Convention are (2.3.2); and finally, (iii) whether the Claimants meet the elements of this test (2.3.3).\n\n2.3.1 Does Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention include an investment test independent from, and thus additional to, the investment test of the BIT?\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n211.\n\nSince it is not disputed that the Claimants made an \"investment\" within the meaning of the BIT, the Tribunal must only ascertain whether Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention contains a definition of \"investment\" that is independent from and thus additional to the definition of \"investment\" in the BIT. For the following three reasons, the Tribunal's conclusion is that the ICSID Convention contains an objective definition of \"investment\", which must be met regardless of whether that same test is also inherent to the term \"investment\" used in the BIT or whether it is additional to the BIT definition.\n\n212.\n\nFirst, as both Parties accept, the ICSID Convention must be construed in accordance with the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties. The Claimants note that the drafting history of the Convention shows that \"[n]o attempt was made to define the term 'investment'.\"336 Yet, as the Respondent correctly points out, this does not mean that this term has no meaning. Rather, in the Tribunal's view, it means that the Contracting States to the ICSID Convention intended to give to the term \"investment\" an \"ordinary meaning\" as opposed to a \"special meaning.\"337 This ordinary meaning is an objective one - an observation that finds support in the *Saba Fakes* award.338\n\n*Id*., at \u00b6 166.\n\n\"A special meaning shall be given to a term if it is established that the parties so intended.\" Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (\"VCLT\"), Article 31(4). This \"special meaning\" stands in contrast to the \"ordinary meaning\" referred to in Article 31(1) of the VCLT.\n\nThe *Saba Fakes* tribunal reached the following conclusion: \"The Tribunal believes that an *objective definition* of the notion of investment was contemplated within the framework of the ICSID Convention [...]\" (emphasis added), *Saba Fakes v. Republic of Turkey* (hereafter \" *Saba Fakes* \"), Award, 14 July 2010, \u00b6 108.\n\n213.\n\nSecond, the Claimants' own position implicitly accepts that the ICSID Convention contains a definition of investment. The Claimants concede that ICSID tribunals must review whether the definition of investment in the BIT is \"so off the chart that [it] cannot reasonably be considered an investment under Art. 25 of the Convention.\"339 Yet, to ascertain whether the BIT's definition of investment is \"off the chart\", it is necessary to determine what the chart is in the first place. The objective definition of investment in Article 25(1) provides that chart.\n\nRej., \u00b6 173.\n\n214.\n\nThird, investor-state cases have indeed given substance and content to an objective meaning of \"investment\". Past awards have considered that this objective meaning was independent from those contained in BITs. This is illustrated, for instance, by the award in *Global Trading v. Ukraine* (\" *Global Trading* \"), where the tribunal made the following statement:\n\n\"[F]or the Tribunal, it is now beyond argument that there are two independent parameters that must both be satisfied [to establish that there is an \"investment\"] : what the parties have given their consent to, as the foundation for submission to arbitration, and what the Convention establishes as the framework for the competence of any tribunal set up under its provisions. The Tribunal need do no more than refer in this connection to a long line of previous decisions starting with *Alcoa Minerals v. Jamaica* in 1975 through *Salini* [...] *v*. [...] *Morocco* (and the various subsequent cases in which tribunals have discussed [...] the so called *Salini* test [...]), and culminating most recently in *Saba Fakes v*. [\u2026] *Turkey* \" (emphasis added).340\n\n*Global Trading Resource Corp. and Globex International, Inc. v. Ukraine*, (hereafter *\"Global Trading\"*), Award, 1 December 2010, \u00b6 43.\n\n215.\n\nMore recent decisions have considered that the objective meaning was inherent to the term investment, irrespective of the application of the ICSID Convention. This inherent meaning was addressed in the *GEA v. Ukraine* case in the following terms:\n\n\"However, it is not so much the term \"investment\" in the ICSID Convention than the term \"investment\" *per se* that is often considered as having an objective meaning in itself, whether it is mentioned in the ICSID Convention or in a BIT.\"341\n\n*GEA Group Aktiengesellschaft v. Ukraine* (hereafter *\"GEA\"*), Award, 31 March 2011, \u00b6 141.\n\n216.\n\nThe tribunal in *Romak v. Uzbekistan*, an arbitration conducted under the UNCITRAL Rules in which the ICSID Convention had no application, also held in favour of an objective meaning of the term investment:\n\n\"The term 'investment' has a meaning in itself that cannot be ignored when considering the list contained in Article 1(2) of the BIT..... The Arbitral Tribunal therefore considers that the term 'investments' under the BIT has an inherent meaning (irrespective of whether the investor resorts to ICSID or UNCITRAL arbitral proceedings) entailing a contribution that extends over a certain period of time and that involves some risk [...]. By their nature, asset types enumerated in the BIT's non-exhaustive list may exhibit these hallmarks. But if an asset does not correspond to the inherent definition of 'investment', the fact that it falls within one of the categories listed in Article 1 does not transform it into an 'investment'\" (emphasis added).342\n\n*Romak S.A. v. The Republic of Uzbekistan*, Award, 9 November 2009, \u00b6 207. The Tribunal also finds mention of an objective definition of investment existing equally under the ICSID Convention and BITs in *Abaclat and Others* (formerly, *Giovanna Beccara and Others*) *v. The Argentine Republic*, Decision on Jurisdiction and Admissibility, 4 August 2011, \u00b6 371.\n\n217.\n\nWhether the objective test under the ICSID Convention is independent from and additional to the definition found in the BIT, or whether the same objective test is inherent to the term investment used in the BIT, the Tribunal must in any event review the elements of the objective definition to ascertain the existence of an investment. These elements are found in ICSID cases interpreting Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention. In sum, the Claimants must show that they have made an \"investment\" under the objective definition developed in the framework of the ICSID Convention in order to establish that the Tribunal has *ratione materiae* jurisdiction over the dispute.\n\n2.3.2 What are the elements of the investment test of Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention?\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n218.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, there are three elements to the definition of investment under Article 25(1): a contribution of money or assets, risk and duration. According to the Respondent, there are six elements: in addition to the three just referred to, a contribution to the economic development of the host State or an operation made in order to develop an economic activity in the host State, conformity to the laws of the host State, and good faith.\n\n219.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees with the Parties that a contribution of money or assets (that is, a commitment of resources), risk and duration are all three part of the ordinary definition of investment. It understands risk to include the expectation of a commercial return. By contrast, the Tribunal is of the view that the additional elements upon which the Respondent relies are not part of such definition.\n\n220.\n\nThe Tribunal appreciates that the element of contribution to the development of the host State is generally regarded as part of the well-known four-prong *Salini* test. Yet, such contribution may well be the consequence of a successful investment; it does not appear as a requirement. If the investment fails, it may end up having made no contribution to the host State development. This does not mean that it is not an investment. For this reason and others, tribunals have excluded this element from the definition of investment. This evolution is illustrated by the following four decisions.\n\n221.\n\nIn July 2006, the tribunal in *LESI v. Algeria* held that there was an investment within the meaning of the ICSID Convention when the first three components of the *Salini* test were met, namely, contribution of money or assets, duration and risk. It further stated that it did not appear necessary to also meet the element of contribution to the economic development of the country, \"a requirement that is any event difficult to establish and implicitly covered by the other elements reviewed.\"343\n\n*LESI Spa et Astaldi S.p.A. v. People's Democratic Republic of Algeria* (hereafter \" *LESI* \"), Decision on Jurisdiction, 12 July 2006, \u00b6 72.\n\n222.\n\nSimilarly, in May 2008, the tribunal in *Victor Pey Casado v. Chile* (\" *Pey Casado* \") held that the contribution to the development of the host State was not an element of the definition of investment. The contribution to the economic development of the host State was an expected consequence of an investment - and not the other way around:\n\n\"It is true that the Preamble to the ICSID Convention mentions contribution to the economic development of the host State. However, this reference is presented as a consequence and not as a condition of the investment : by protecting investments, the Convention facilitates the development of the host State. This does not mean that the development of the host State becomes a constitutive element of the concept of investment. \" (emphasis added).344\n\n*V\u00edctor Pey Casado and President Allende Foundation v. Republic of Chile* (hereafter *\"Pey\")*, Award, 8 May 2008, \u00b6 232.\n\n223.\n\nIn April 2009, the tribunal in *Phoenix Action v. Czech Republic* adopted a similar view, according to which what matters is the contribution to the *economy* of the host State, a contribution subsumed in the other three elements of the *Salini* test:\n\n\"[T]he contribution of an international investment to the development of the host State is impossible to ascertain. A less ambitious approach should therefore be adopted, centered on the contribution of an international investment to the economy of the host State, which is indeed normally inherent in the mere concept of investment as shaped by elements of contribution/duration/risk, and should therefore in principle be presumed\" (emphasis in original).345\n\n*Phoenix Action Ltd. v. Czech Republic* (hereafter *\"Phoenix\")*, Decision on Jurisdiction, 15 April 2009, \u00b6 85.\n\n224.\n\nFinally, in July 2010, the tribunal in *Saba Fakes v. Turkey* held in unequivocal terms that the element of contribution to the economic development of the host State was not part of the definition of investment pursuant to the ICSID Convention:\n\n\"[T]he present Tribunal considers that the criteria of (i) a contribution, (ii) a certain duration, and (iii) an element of risk, are both [sic] necessary and sufficient to define an investment within the framework of the ICSID Convention [...]. The Tribunal is not convinced, on the other hand, that a contribution to the host State's economic development constitutes a criterion of an investment within the framework of the ICSID Convention [...] [W]hile the economic development of a host State is one of the proclaimed objectives of the ICSID Convention, this objective is not in and of itself an independent criterion for the definition of an investment\" (emphasis added).346\n\n*Saba Fakes*, at \u00b6\u00b6 110-111.\n\n225.\n\nIn line with this trend, the Tribunal considers that a contribution to the economic development of the host State or an operation made in order to develop an economic activity in the host State is not an element of the objective definition of investment.\n\n226.\n\nLikewise, the Tribunal is of the view that neither conformity to the laws of the host State nor respect of good faith are elements of the definition of investment. The Contracting Parties to the BIT have limited the protections of the treaty to investments made in accordance with the law of the host State. This limitation may be a bar to jurisdiction, *i.e.* to the procedural protections under the Treaty, or to the application of the substantive treaty guarantees as a matter of merits. In addition, recourse to treaty arbitration and substantive treaty protections may in certain circumstances breach the prohibition of abuse of rights which is an emanation of the principle of good faith. That does not mean that these elements are part of the *definition* of investment. An illegal or bad faith investment remains an investment. It may not be a protected investment, *i.e.* deserve protection in the sense that access to treaty arbitration and/or substantive treaty guarantees may not be granted, but that is a different matter.\n\n227.\n\nIn sum, for the previous reasons, the Tribunal concludes that the objective definition of investment under Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention comprises the elements of contribution of money or assets, risk and duration.\n\n2.3.3 Does the Claimants' investment meet the objective test of Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention?\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n228.\n\nThe Tribunal must examine whether the Claimants meet the definition of investment of Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention. The Claimants maintain that they meet all the elements of this definition, including - despite not being part of the definition - the element of contribution to the economic development of the host State; the Respondent denies that the Claimants meet any of these elements. The Tribunal will address each of these elements in turn.\n\n229.\n\nFirst, the Respondent alleges that none of the Claimants has made a contribution of money or assets. However, as the Tribunal previously concluded, the evidence shows that Quiborax paid for 51% of the shares of NMM.347 Regardless of where payment was made, this qualifies as a contribution of money because the object of the payment and *raison d'\u00eatre* of the transaction - the mining concessions - were located in Bolivia. In addition, whereas NMM did not strictly speaking \"purchase\" the original seven mining concessions, as the Claimants have alleged348, the record shows that it did issue 26,680 shares in exchange for them. Accordingly, Quiborax made a monetary contribution and NMM a contribution of assets.\n\n*See supra*, \u00a7\u00a7 1.3.1(iii) and (iv), and \u00b6 192.\n\n\"Claimants purchased their initial seven mining concessions from Bolivian company [R\u00edo Grande]\" (Rej., \u00b6 187).\n\n230.\n\nThe Respondent further argues that the Claimants did not make a contribution to obtain the four additional mining concessions in 2002, since no such payment was required under Bolivian law.349 The Claimants, in turn, assert that these mining concessions are \"titles to property\" for which \"NMM paid a yearly license [...] in accordance with Article 10 of the Mining Code.\"350 The Tribunal finds evidence that NMM paid the corresponding mining license fees for these four concessions, as shown in the title deeds \"Pococho\"351, \"La Negra\"352; \"Cancha I\"353 and \"Cancha II.\"354\n\n\"[T]he fact that NMM received these mining concessions does not mean that there was a contribution in any manner\" (Tr. 92:14-16).\n\nTr. 569:6-9.\n\nExh. CD-31.\n\nExh. CD-32.\n\nExh. CD-36.\n\nExh. CD-37.\n\n231.\n\nApart from these initial contributions, Quiborax's financial statements for 2002-2004355 and NMM's financial statements for 2002-2003356 show that additional contributions were made in order to operate the mining concessions. In the aggregate, the Tribunal is satisfied that Quiborax's and NMM's original and subsequent contributions meet the contribution requirement for the \"investment\" test of Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention.\n\nExh. NCI-31, NCI-32 and NCI-33.\n\nExh. NCI-53.\n\n232.\n\nBy contrast, there is no evidence that Allan Fosk made a contribution of money or assets. As the Claimants have readily conceded, Allan Fosk did not pay for his one share but rather \"received\"357 it \"in order to comply with the minimum three shareholders requirement under Bolivian corporate law.\"358 There is thus no evidence of an original contribution. Nor is there evidence that he personally made a subsequent contribution to exploit the mining concessions. In short, it is not established that Mr. Fosk made any contribution whatsoever. While on one occasion Mr. Fosk received dividends for his one share359, this only demonstrates that he benefited from the investment, not that he made a contribution.\n\nCM, \u00b6 48, n. 70.\n\n*Id.*, at \u00b6 34; *see also* Mem., \u00b6 63.\n\nExh. CD-149.\n\n233.\n\nAccording to Bolivia, a distinction should be made between the objects of an investment, \"such as shares or concessions [...] and the action of investing.\"360 The Tribunal agrees. While shares or other securities or title may be the legal materialization of an investment, mere ownership of a share is, in and of itself, insufficient to prove a contribution of money or assets. In the present case, the record shows that Mr. Fosk received a share to comply with a formality under Bolivian corporate law, and that at no point did he make a personal contribution to the investment. In the circumstances, the Tribunal finds that Mr. Fosk does not hold an investment under Article 25(1).\n\nTr. 79:1-8.\n\n234.\n\nSecond, Bolivia submits that, to the extent it has argued \"that Claimants didn't do anything in Bolivia, the elements of duration and risk are indirectly also put into question.\"361 Yet, the Tribunal found that Quiborax and NMM did make a contribution of money and assets. Thus, this indirect objection, contingent upon a finding that no contribution was made, does not apply to them. At any rate, Quiborax's and NMM's contributions did meet the elements of duration and risk. Quiborax's and NMM's contributions and operations in R\u00edo Grande ran from 2001 to June 2004. Had it not been for the onset of the dispute, there is no reason to consider that these operations would not have extended beyond that date. It is also apparent that these operations were subject to risks, including market, financial and political risks. Furthermore, it is not disputed that Quiborax and NMM made their contributions with the expectation of receiving a commercial return. Conversely, the objection does apply to Allan Fosk, who made no contribution. Nevertheless, since Allan Fosk has failed to meet the element of contribution, it is unnecessary to examine whether he has also failed the investment test of Article 25(1) on additional grounds.\n\n*Id.*, at 85:4-7.\n\n235.\n\nThird, Bolivia claims that the Claimants did not meet the element of contribution to the economic development of the host State or an operation made in order to develop an economic activity in the host State. The Claimants maintain that the opposite is true. As previously explained, the Tribunal considers that this element is not part of the definition of \"investment\" under Article 25(1), but rather an aspiration informing the system of international investment protection. In any event, the Tribunal deems that Quiborax and NMM have met this aspiration in this case.\n\n236.\n\nThe evidence shows that the exploitation of the mining concessions generated a growing level of economic activity that only came to an end with this dispute. Specifically, NMM's sales of ulexite experienced a growth rate of 250% between 2002 and 2003362; this growth necessarily increases the economic activities that make those sales possible in the first place - labour, transportation, logistics. Further, NMM sold around 64,000 tons of ulexite to Quiborax in 2003 and 2004 combined.363 The Respondent's video evidence is insufficient to rebut evidence of this contribution.364 Thus, the Tribunal considers that Quiborax and NMM met the aspiration that their investment should contribute to the economic development of Bolivia.\n\nExh. NCI-53; Navigant ER, \u00b6 73 n. 129.\n\nExh. NCI-62; Navigant ER, \u00b6 111 n. 155. This evidence shows that Quiborax's and NMM's exploitation generated real economic activity, to the benefit of the R\u00edo Grande area. In its Reply on Jurisdiction, however, the Respondent noted that it was enough for the investor to \"potentially\" contribute to the economic development of the host State (Reply, \u00b6 176). Since the Tribunal considers that Quiborax's and NMM's investment as a matter of fact contributed to the economic development of the host State, it is all the more clear that Quiborax and NMM met this lower standard.\n\nExh. R-169.\n\n237.\n\nFor these reasons, the Tribunal finds that Quiborax and NMM made an investment in the objective sense developed under Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention. The same is not true of Allan Fosk. Accordingly, the Tribunal does not have *ratione materiae* jurisdiction over Allan Fosk's claim. Hence, the \"Claimants\" shall henceforth refer only to Quiborax and NMM, to the exclusion of Mr. Fosk. On the other hand, in order for the Tribunal to conclusively ascertain whether or not it has *ratione materiae* jurisdiction over Quiborax and NMM, it must examine Bolivia's next objection.\n\n**3. Third Objection: The Tribunal Lacks Jurisdiction Because Claimants' Alleged Investment Was Made in Breach of Bolivian Laws and Regulations**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n3.1. The Respondent's Position\n------------------------------\n\n238.\n\nAccording to Bolivia, the Tribunal has no *ratione materiae* jurisdiction because the Claimants' investment was made in breach of the Treaty's legality requirement.365 The Treaty's scope is indeed limited to investments \"made in accordance with the laws and regulations\"366 of the host State. ICSID case law shows that the legality requirement is an element of *ratione materiae* jurisdiction. Thus, if this requirement is not met, the Tribunal has no jurisdiction over the dispute, a proposition endorsed in *Inceysa v. El Salvador, Saba Fakes v. Turkey* and *Alasdair Ross Anderson v. Costa Rica*.\n\nOJ, \u00b6\u00b6 194-195.\n\nArticle II of the Treaty. By the same token, Article I(2) of the Treaty defines \"investment\" as \"any kind of assets or rights related to an investment so long as the latter has been made in accordance with the laws and regulations\" of the host State (Tribunal's translation). The legality requirement is again reiterated in Article III(2) of the Treaty. Thus, the legality requirement is included \"in no less than three provisions of the Treaty\" (Tr. 63:8-9).\n\n239.\n\nBolivia specifically submits that (i) the legality requirement covers any breach of Bolivian law, regardless of its seriousness and regardless of when the breach is committed; (ii) at any rate, the Claimants violated \"fundamental provisions of Bolivian laws and regulations, including tax and criminal laws\"367; and (iii) it is not *estopped* from raising the illegality of the Claimants' investment. Each of these submissions is expanded below.\n\nROSS, p. 80.\n\n240.\n\nFirst, the legality requirements covers any breach of Bolivian law regardless of its seriousness. The Treaty does not draw a distinction between serious and non-serious breaches of the laws; it covers both alike.368 The very use of the terms \"laws and regulations\" shows that the legality requirement covers the entire Bolivian legal order, without regard to the significance of the rule breached.369 This broad construction of the legality requirement is consistent with the Treaty's broad definition of \"investment.\" The broader the definition of \"investment\", the greater is the need for investors to comply with the legal order of the host State.370\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 199, 201-205.\n\n*Id*.\n\n*Id*., at \u00b6 200.\n\n241.\n\nAdditionally, the legality requirement covers any breach of Bolivian law regardless of when the breach occurred, *i.e.* regardless of whether the breach is committed at the time of the establishment of the investment or thereafter. Unlike the situation in *Saba Fakes*, this Treaty requires that the investments \"be effected\" in conformity with the legal order of the host State. This language covers breaches committed at the time of the establishment of the investment and during its performance.371 In any event, the Claimants breached Bolivian law at the time when they established their investment. Specifically, on account of these breaches, Quiborax and Allan Fosk could not validly become shareholders of NMM.372\n\n*Id*., at \u00b6 209.\n\n*Id*., at \u00b6 210.\n\n242.\n\nSecond, regardless of whether the legality requirement covers only serious breaches, the Claimants violated \"fundamental provisions of Bolivian laws and regulations, including tax and criminal laws.\"373 The Respondent alleges that the transfer of NMM shares from R\u00edo Grande to Quiborax on 17 August 2001 \"was in breach of Bolivian law for no less than six reasons\"374: (i) NMM made a capital increase without obtaining the prior approval of the Commercial Registry in breach of the Commercial Code375; (ii) the Claimants committed fraud against R\u00edo Grande's creditors, as R\u00edo Grande received no payment for the transfer376; (iii) if the transfer was a gift, Quiborax should have paid a tax on gratuitous transfers and recorded the gift in a notarized document377; (iv) if the transfer was not a gift, Quiborax and Allan Fosk should have paid the transfer tax378; (v) Quiborax failed to register a duly empowered legal representative379; and (vi) R\u00edo Grande failed to reduce its capital as required by the Commercial Code.380\n\nROSS, p. 80.\n\nTr. 66:4-6.\n\nOJ, \u00b6 203; Tr. 66:7-67:3.\n\nOJ, \u00b6 203; Tr. 67:4-15.\n\nReply, \u00b6 206; Tr. 67:16:68:14.\n\nTr. 68:15-21.\n\nOJ, \u00b6 203; Tr. 68:22-69:3.\n\nTr. 69:4-10.\n\n243.\n\nThese six violations also apply to the transfer of NMM shares of 4 and 10 September 2001.381 In addition, Bolivia submits that the Claimants committed the following four breaches of Bolivian law (the numbering continues that of the preceding paragraph): (vii) Mr. Fosk misrepresented that he was in La Paz in the minutes of 27 January 2003382; (viii) the Claimants failed to pay the corporate income tax for foreign beneficiaries383; (ix) the Claimants breached the rules concerning the registration of mining concessions384; (x) they also breached the rules concerning the accuracy of financial statements385, and (xi) the rules concerning the contents of the shareholders registry.386\n\n*Id.*, at 69:14-17.\n\n*Id.,* at 529:16-22.\n\nOJ, \u00b6 203.\n\n*Id*.\n\n*Id*.\n\n*Id*.\n\n244.\n\nThird, Bolivia maintains that it is not *estopped* from objecting to the legality of the Claimants' investment. The Bolivian authorities never accepted that the Claimants' investment was legal. While the *Superintendencia* concluded that Quiborax and Allan Fosk were shareholders of NMM, this conclusion was based on the shareholders registry, not on a thorough analysis of the record. Moreover, the fact that the Parties entered into settlement negotiations does not mean that Bolivia accepted the Claimants' allegations. Contrary to what the Claimants allege, the decisions in *SwemBalt v. Latvia* and *Kardassopoulos v. Georgia* do not support their position.\n\n245.\n\nIn sum, Bolivia submits that, because the Claimants' investment \"was tainted with illegality under Bolivian laws and regulations\"387, the Tribunal has no *ratione materiae* jurisdiction over this dispute.\n\nTr. 70:4-5 and 8-9.\n\n3.2. The Claimants' Position\n----------------------------\n\n246.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, their investment was made \"in accordance with the laws and regulations\" of Bolivia and the Respondent's allegations to the contrary are unfounded.388 The Claimants specifically submit that (i) the legality requirement has a limited scope: it applies only to violations of the host State's fundamental principles or investment regime, and only at the time the investment is established389; (ii) they did not breach the legality requirement because the alleged violations of Bolivian law either did not occur or fall outside the scope of this requirement390; and (iii) the Respondent is *estopped* from raising the illegality of the Claimants' investment.391\n\nCM, \u00b6 123.\n\n*Id.*, at \u00b6\u00b6 125-131, 136-137; Rej., \u00b6\u00b6 205, 209-210, 214-220.\n\nCM, \u00b6\u00b6 132-137; Rej., \u00b6\u00b6 104-124, 206.\n\nCM, \u00b6\u00b6 148-158; Rej., \u00b6\u00b6 222-229.\n\n247.\n\nFirst, with respect to the scope of the legality requirement, Bolivia has cited no precedent or doctrine that supports its broad interpretation of the legality requirement392; on the contrary, the precedents on which it relies support a narrow interpretation of this requirement.393 In sum, host States should not be able to invoke the legality requirement as an excuse to avoid their international responsibility.394 With respect to the burden of proof, any act which is alleged to be legally flawed remains valid until it is voided by a court decision at the request of an interested party.395\n\nRej., \u00b6 205.\n\n*Id*., at \u00b6\u00b6 209-210.\n\nCM, \u00b6\u00b6 130-131.\n\nRej., \u00b6 207.\n\n248.\n\nOn the substantive scope of the legality requirement, the tribunal in *Saba Fakes v. Turkey* stated that it was \"not convinced\"396 by the State's position \"that any violation of any of the host State's laws would result in the illegality of the investment [...] and preclude such investment from\"397 BIT protection. In *Tokios Tokel\u00e9s v. Ukraine*, the tribunal held that it would be \"inconsistent with the object and purpose of the Treaty\"398 to deny protection to an investment on the basis of \"minor errors\"399 or other formal irregularities.400 Similarly, the tribunal in *Desert Line v. Yemen* held that the legality requirement excludes \"investments made in breach of fundamental principles of the host State's law.\"401 The decisions in *Phoenix Action*, *World Duty Free*, *Inceysa*, *Alasdair Ross Anderson* and *Fraport* also support a limited reading of the legality requirement.402\n\n*Saba Fakes*, at \u00b6 119.\n\n*Id*.\n\n*Tokios Tokel\u00e9s v. Ukraine* (hereafter *\"Tokios Tokel\u00e9s\")*, Decision on Jurisdiction, 29 April 2004, \u00b6 86.\n\n*Id*.\n\nCM, \u00b6 128.\n\n*Desert Line Projects LLC v. Republic of Yemen* (hereafter *\"Desert Line\")*, Award, 6 February 2008, \u00b6 104.\n\nRej, \u00b6 210, n. 321.\n\n249.\n\nOn the time-aspect of the legality requirement, the tribunal in *Hamester v. Ghana* stated that a distinction had to be \"drawn between (1) legality as at the *initiation* of the investment (\"made\") and (2) legality *during the performance* of the investment\"403 (emphasis in the original). Pursuant to this distinction based on the Treaty language, the *Hamester* tribunal held that the legality requirement only applied to the \"initiation of the investment.\"404 Likewise, the *Saba Fakes* tribunal held that the legality requirement governed the \"admission of the investment in the host State.\"405 The same conclusion should be reached in this case, as the Bolivia-Chile BIT employs the past tense in connection with the legality requirement, *i.e.* investments \"made\" in accordance with the laws and regulations of the host State.406\n\n*Gustav Hamester GmbH & Co. KG v. Republic of Ghana* (hereafter \" *Hamester* \"), Award, 18 June 2010, \u00b6 127.\n\n*Id.*\n\n*Saba Fakes*, at \u00b6 119.\n\nRej., \u00b6\u00b6 217-218.\n\n250.\n\nSecond, the Claimants did not breach the legality requirement because the alleged violations of Bolivian law either did not occur or fall outside the scope of this requirement. In response to Bolivia's specific allegations407, the Claimants argue that: (i) NMM was not required to obtain *prior* approval from the Commercial Registry to make a capital increase, and the subsequent approval sufficed408; (ii) \"[a]ll of the accusations of fraud are false\"409, including the allegation of fraud against R\u00edo Grande's creditors; (iii) the transfer of NMM shares from R\u00edo Grande to Quiborax was not a gift and thus no gift tax was due410; (iv) there is no tax evasion as a result of these transfers because the Commercial Registry itself - the *Senarec* - certified that the \"legal and tax requirements\" of the transfer were met.411\n\nThe Claimants did not specifically respond to Bolivia's allegation that they did not meet the legality requirement because R\u00edo Grande failed to reduce its capital, as would have been required by the Commercial Code, following the transfer of NMM shares to Quiborax - an allegation first made at the hearing (Tr. 69:4-10).\n\nTr. 544:5-17.\n\n*Id.*, at 113:17.\n\nRej., \u00b6\u00b6 123-124.\n\nTr. 542:8-12.\n\n251.\n\nThe Claimants further maintain that (v) Quiborax had no obligation to register a legal representative in Bolivia412; (vi) Mr. Fosk's signature of the minutes of 27 January 2003 on a date different than the one represented in the minutes \"is normal corporate practice\"413; (vii) the Claimants paid the income tax for foreign beneficiaries414; (viii) the belated registration of the mining concessions did not affect the validity of the transfer, but only delayed its effects vis-\u00e0-vis third-parties415; (ix) there is no provision under Bolivian law whereby errors in the financial statements are illegal416; (x) the shareholders registry complied with the requirements of Bolivian law, as the *Superintendencia* concluded in its report dated 11 February 2005.417\n\nRej., \u00b6\u00b6 111-118.\n\nTr. 560:18-19.\n\nCM, \u00b6 135; Rej., \u00b6\u00b6 121-122.\n\nRej., \u00b6\u00b6 104-110.\n\n*Id*., at \u00b6\u00b6 119-120.\n\nTr. 555:5-559:17.\n\n252.\n\nOn the other hand, if there has been any formal breach of Bolivian law, this only shows the Claimants' good faith.418 Indeed, none of these breaches helped the Claimants to secure the investment - as was the case in *Plama, World Duty Free* and *Inceysa* - or made the investment more profitable.419 Likewise, no attempt was made to cover up these alleged breaches of Bolivian law: when the Claimants discovered, for instance, that the minutes of 11 September 2001 - which wrongly listed Fernando Rojas, Dolly Paredes and Gilka Salas as still being shareholders of NMM - had been incorporated into other documents, the NMM Board of Directors took formal notice of the mistake and issued new documents to rectify the mistake.420\n\nCM, \u00b6\u00b6 138-147.\n\n*Id*., at \u00b6\u00b6 140-141.\n\n*Id*., at \u00b6\u00b6 142-143.\n\n253.\n\nThird, the Respondent is *estopped* from disputing the legality of Claimants' investment. As a matter of fact, the Respondent has engaged the Claimants in negotiations for almost three years and, in the context of those negotiations, has had the opportunity to examine the relevant documentation on multiple occasions.421 At no point, however, did Bolivia call into question the legality of the Claimants' investment; as the *Superintendencia* report shows, the opposite was the case.422 In these circumstances, the Respondent is *estopped* from raising objections on the ground that the Claimants' investment fails to meet the legality requirement. The decisions in *Swembelt v. Latvia* and *Kardassopoulos v. Georgia* lend support to this conclusion.423\n\n*Id*., at \u00b6\u00b6 148-149, 152-153.\n\n*Id*., at \u00b6\u00b6 154-155.\n\n*Id*., at \u00b6\u00b6 150-151; Rej., \u00b6\u00b6 228-229.\n\n254.\n\nFor these reasons, the Claimants submit that they met the legality requirement and that the Tribunal has thus jurisdiction over this dispute.\n\n3.3. Analysis\n-------------\n\n255.\n\nThe Parties are in dispute as to whether the Claimants have met the Treaty's legality requirement. Article II of the Bolivia-Chile BIT limits its scope of application to investments made \"in accordance with the legal provisions\" of the host State.424 Similarly, Article I(2) of the Treaty defines \"investment\" as one that was made \"in accordance with the laws and regulations\"425 of the host State. The definition of investment is relevant to determine the scope of the Contracting Parties' - and thus Bolivia's - consent to arbitration under Article X of the Treaty. Hence, under the Bolivia-Chile BIT, the legality requirement is relevant to determine both the Treaty's scope of application and the scope of Bolivia's consent to arbitration.\n\nExh. CL-1, Art. II.\n\n*Id*., at Art. I(2).\n\n256.\n\nTo rule on Bolivia's jurisdictional objection, the Tribunal must determine (i) whether the Respondent is *estopped* from contesting the legality of Claimants' investment under the Treaty; if the Respondent is not so *estopped*, the Tribunal must ascertain (ii) the burden of proof concerning alleged violations of the legality requirement, (iii) the scope of the legality requirement, and (iv) whether the Claimants have breached the legality requirement.\n\n3.3.1 Is Bolivia *estopped* from contesting the legality of Claimants' investment under the Treaty on account of its previous conduct?\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n257.\n\nThe Claimants allege that Bolivia is *estopped* from contesting the legality of their investment on account of its previous conduct. The Tribunal is not convinced that this is the case. As Bolivia's apposite reliance on *Vieira v. Chile426* suggests, the fact that the Parties have entertained prolonged settlement discussions, extending well beyond the initiation of this arbitration, does not mean by itself that Bolivia has accepted the Claimants' jurisdictional allegations, at least not absent specific evidence to the contrary. A different conclusion could have a chilling effect on the host State's willingness to entertain settlement negotiations. In this case, neither the *Superintendencia* report nor the remaining evidence shows that Bolivia accepted that the Claimants' investment complied with the legality requirement.427\n\n*Sociedad An\u00f3nima Eduardo Vieira v. Republic of Chile* (hereafter \" *Vieira* \"), Award, 21 August 2007, \u00b6 200.\n\nThe *Superintendencia* report concluded that further inquiries and studies were necessary to \"structure the defense of the Bolivian State in the face of potential ICSID proceedings\" (Exh. CD-72, p. 6). Thus, by its own terms, the *Superintendencia* report was neither comprehensive nor exhaustive.\n\n258.\n\nThus, the Tribunal is duty-bound to conclude that Bolivia is not *estopped* from contesting the legality of the Claimants' investment.\n\n3.3.2 What party bears the burden of proof concerning alleged violations of the legality requirement?\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n259.\n\nWhile the Parties have not explicitly addressed this issue, the Tribunal considers that the party alleging a breach of the legality requirement, *i.e.* the host State, bears the burden of proof. The contrary proposition would be unrealistic: the investor would have to somehow prove that it has complied with the myriad laws and regulations of the host State. Hence, the burden of proof must naturally rest with the party alleging a breach of the legality requirement. This view is confirmed by the cases, doctrine, and Respondent's own position.\n\n260.\n\nIn *Desert Line*, the tribunal held that the respondent had \"not come close to satisfying [it] that the Claimant's] investment [...] was inconsistent with Yemeni laws or regulations.\"428 In *Saba Fakes*, the tribunal held that the respondent's allegation that the investment was illegal could fall within the scope of the legality requirement \"if demonstrated.\"429 And in *Hamester*, the tribunal held that the respondent did \"not fully discharge its burden of proof\" regarding its allegation that the claimant's investment was illegal.430 Likewise, Zachary Douglas has written that the host State's allegation that \"the claimant has violated its law in the acquisition of its investment [...] must be fatal\" to jurisdiction \"[i]f that allegation is substantiated before the investment treaty tribunal.\"431\n\n*Desert Line*, at \u00b6 105.\n\n*Saba Fakes*, at \u00b6 120.\n\n*Hamester*, at \u00b6 132.\n\nZ. Douglas, *The International Law of Investment Claims*, Cambridge University Press 2009, p. 53, \u00b6 106.\n\n261.\n\nIn line with these authorities, the Respondent appeared to concede that, although the Claimants bear the burden of proving the primordial jurisdictional facts, it bears the burden of proving breaches of the legality requirement:\n\n\"The first comment on evidence [...] We say to you that we have established, for instance, that, if any, the investment made by Claimants is illegal [...] but regarding the questions of the existence of investors and the question of existence of an investment, this is something that has to be established by Claimants\" (emphasis added).432\n\nTr. 497:14-498:2.\n\n262.\n\nContrary to what the Claimants assert, this does not mean that their investment can only be declared to have breached the law \"by court decision\"433, *i.e.* by the decision of a Bolivian court in this case. It is the Tribunal's duty to determine whether it has jurisdiction over the dispute and, to that end, to examine whether the legality requirement is met. But it does mean that the Respondent must prove to the satisfaction of the Tribunal that the Claimants' investment breached the legality requirement.\n\nRej., \u00b6 207.\n\n3.3.3 What is the scope of the legality requirement?\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n263.\n\nThe Parties disagree about the scope of the legality requirement. The Claimants advocate a narrow reading of this requirement limited to breaches of fundamental legal principles or of the investment regime. The Respondent opposes an expansive construction encompassing any breach of its legal order irrespective of its seriousness or timing. The Tribunal is of the opinion that neither interpretation is entirely correct, the interpretation of the Claimants being too narrow and that of the Respondent too broad. The Claimants' interpretation goes beyond the terms of the BIT, in an attempt to further the investor's protection without due regard for the State's interests. By contrast, the Respondent's expansive view neglects the investor's interests with the result that an investment could be deprived of any treaty protection for any breach of the host State's legal order - however slight - committed at any time. This approach would create deleterious incentives, as host States would be in a position to strip investors of treaty protection by finding any minor breach at any time.\n\n264.\n\nNeither view is consistent with the objectives of the BIT, the Preamble of which states that the Parties \"recogniz[e] the need to promote and protect foreign investments in order to support the economic prosperity of both States\" and \"wish[] to strengthen the economic cooperation to benefit both States.\"434 Accordingly, within the limits set by the applicable treaty interpretation rules, the Tribunal favours a balanced interpretation that takes account of the need to protect foreign investments, on the one hand, and of the State's other responsibilities, on the other. Or in the words of the *El Paso* tribunal:\n\n\"This Tribunal considers that a balanced interpretation is needed, taking into account both State sovereignty and the State's responsibility to create an adapted and evolutionary framework for the development of economic activities, and the necessity to protect foreign investment and its continuing flow.\"435\n\nExh. CL-1 (Tribunal's translation).\n\n*El Paso*, at \u00b6 70.\n\n265.\n\nBearing this in mind, construction of the legality requirement calls for a line-drawing exercise in which the Tribunal must determine what violations are covered by the legality requirement. Or, differently stated, what violations of the legality requirement exclude the investment from the scope of the Treaty and the jurisdiction of the Tribunal. Other tribunals have already grappled with the question of the scope of similarly- or identically-worded legality requirements. The Tribunal will draw guidance from these cases, which, while still in a relatively emerging state, already outline the contours of the legality requirement.\n\n266.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that the BIT's legality requirement has both subject-matter and temporal limitations. The subject-matter scope of the legality requirement is limited to (i) non-trivial violations of the host State's legal order (*Tokios Tokel\u00e9s*436, *LESI*437 and *Desert Line*438), (ii) violations of the host State's foreign investment regime (*Saba Fakes*439), and (iii) fraud - for instance, to secure the investment (*Inceysa*440, *Plama*441*, Hamester*442) or profits (*Fraport*443). Additionally, under this BIT, the temporal scope of the legality requirement is limited to the establishment of the investment; it does not extend to the subsequent performance. Indeed, the Treaty refers to the legality requirement in the past tense by using the words investments \"made\" in accordance with the laws and regulations of the host State and, in Spanish, \"haya efectuado\"444 (*Fraport*445*, Hamester*446*, Saba Fakes*447*).*\n\n*Tokios Tokel\u00e9s*, at \u00b6 86.\n\n*LESI*, at \u00b6 83(iii).\n\n*Desert Line*, at \u00b6 104.\n\n*Saba Fakes*, at \u00b6 119.\n\n*Inceysa Vallisoletana v. Republic of El Salvador* (hereafter \" *Inceysa* \"), Award, 2 August 2006, \u00b6\u00b6 236-238.\n\n*Plama*, at \u00b6\u00b6 133-135.\n\n*Hamester*, at \u00b6\u00b6 129, 135.\n\n*Fraport AG Frankfurt Airport Services Worldwide v. Republic of Philippines* (hereafter \" *Fraport* \"), Award, 16 August 2007, \u00b6 396.\n\nArt. I(2) and Art. II (in Spanish \"efectuadas\").\n\n*Fraport*, at \u00b6 345.\n\n*Hamester*, at \u00b6 127.\n\n*Saba Fakes*, at \u00b6 119.\n\n267.\n\nAccordingly, the Tribunal finds that the legality requirement has both subject-matter and temporal limitations.\n\n3.3.4 Did the Claimants breach the legality requirement?\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n268.\n\nThe Tribunal will examine each of Bolivia's allegations that the Claimants breached the legality requirement, taking into account the foregoing considerations regarding the burden of proof and the limited scope of the legality requirement.\n\n269.\n\nFirst, Bolivia alleges that one of the \"main illegalities\"448 is that NMM's capital increase of August 2001 was made without the prior approval of the Commercial Registry, in breach of Articles 343 and 131 of the Bolivian Commercial Code (the \"Commercial Code).449 According to Respondent's expert, Prof. Salame, this results in the \"absolute nullity\"450 of the NMM shares issued pursuant to said capital increase. The Tribunal is not convinced that this is the case. Neither Article 343 nor 131 of the Commercial Code provides that the Commercial Registry's approval of a capital increase must be given \"prior\" to said increase - nor is there any authority in support of this interpretation. Therefore, it does not appear that the Commercial Registry's *prior* approval is an essential element for the validity of the capital increase.451\n\nTr. 528:5.\n\n*Id.*, at 66:7-67:3.\n\n*Id.*, at 341:12.\n\nIn light of this conclusion, there is no need to have recourse to Article 822 of the Commercial Code and to Article 549 of the Civil Code, as Prof. Salame has argued (Tr. 341:14-342:8).\n\n270.\n\nOn the contrary, the Commercial Registry provided authoritative confirmation that *prior* approval is not essential: it approved NMM's capital increase on August 28, 2001 despite having full knowledge that NMM had increased its capital *before* obtaining its -the Commercial Registry's - approval to do so.452 Indeed, Resolution No. 1174/2001 refers explicitly to the minutes of 3 August 2001 and to public deed 210/2001, both of which plainly show that NMM had already increased its capital.453 Had the Commercial Registry considered that *prior* approval was an essential requirement for the capital increase, it would have refused NMM's request for approval.454\n\nExh. R-126.\n\nExhs. CD-25 and CD-110.\n\nIn accordance with Article 131 of the Commercial Code, the Commercial Registry had the power to \"approve or deny\" the request for a capital increase. If the request is denied, the Commercial Registry must provide reasons so that the applicant may correct any deficiencies.\n\n271.\n\nSecond, Bolivia alleges that another main illegality455 is that the Claimants committed fraud against R\u00edo Grande's creditors, as R\u00edo Grande received no payment for the transfer of its shares in NMM. However, there is no evidence to support this allegation. In its second Expert Report, Prof. Salame stated that this transfer \"could\"456 amount to fraud to creditors \"if\"457 its purpose was to avoid paying off R\u00edo Grande's debts; however, he noted that he did not have \"sufficient information\"458 to determine whether there was fraud under the facts of this case. No such evidence has, indeed, been submitted. It is even a matter of speculation whether R\u00edo Grande had creditors in the first place.459\n\nTr. 528:11-20.\n\nSalame ER II, \u00b6 44 (4th bullet point).\n\n*Id*.\n\n*Id*.\n\nIn its Second Report, Prof. Salame professed that he \"ignor[ed]\" whether R\u00edo Grande \"had debts at the time of the events\" (Tribunal's translation) (Salame ER II, \u00b6 44 (4th bullet point)). Furthermore, at the hearing, Counsel for the Respondent stated that: \"[T]here were *apparently* concerns about liabilities of R\u00edo Grande. That's why *apparently* they [the Claimants] did not want to buy shares in R\u00edo Grande\" (emphasis added)(Tr. 528:15-18).\n\n272.\n\nThird, Bolivia alleges that, if the transfer was a gift, Quiborax should have paid the tax on gratuitous transfer pursuant to Article 99 of Law No. 843, and recorded the gift in a notarized document.460 Yet, as the Tribunal previously concluded, Quiborax did not receive the NMM shares gratuitously but rather for a fee.461 Since the condition upon which the Respondent's allegation is predicated is not met, the Tribunal finds no illegality here.\n\nTr. 67:16-68:14; ROSS, pp. 85-87.\n\n*See supra*, \u00a7\u00a7 1.3.1(iii) and (iv), and Tribunal's conclusion at \u00b6 192.\n\n273.\n\nFourth, Bolivia argues in the alternative that, if the transfer was *not* a gift, Quiborax and Allan Fosk should have paid the transaction tax. However, the point is moot with respect to Allan Fosk, over whom the Tribunal has already concluded that it has no jurisdiction, and there is no evidence that Quiborax was subject to this tax. At the hearing, the Respondent relied on Article 72 of Law No. 843, which provides that certain economic activities and gratuitous transfers are \"subject to the [transaction] tax [...] under the conditions provided for in the following Articles.\"462 But no evidence was submitted that the transfer of NMM shares to Quiborax met those \"conditions\" and was subject to the transaction tax. Thus, the Respondent has not substantiated this allegation.\n\nSalame ER I, Annex 22, Art. 72.\n\n274.\n\nFifth, the Respondent alleges that Quiborax failed to register a duly empowered legal representative to act in Bolivia, in breach of Article 420 of the Commercial Code. The Respondent's argument is that this failure rendered the *transfer* of the shares invalid. However, as Respondent's own legal expert acknowledged, Quiborax was not required to register a legal representative to acquire shares in Bolivia.463 Whether Quiborax was, on the other hand, required to register a legal representative in order to exercise its rights as a shareholder is a question that lies outside the temporal scope of the legality requirement, as this is a question which concerns a period of time subsequent to that in which the investment was made. Thus, the Tribunal finds no relevant illegality here.\n\nOn the issue of whether Quiborax was required to be registered with the Commercial Registry, Prof. Salame \"agree[d] that the answer was in the negative\" (Salame ER II, \u00b6 66).\n\n275.\n\nSixth, the Respondent alleges that R\u00edo Grande failed to reduce its capital following the transfer of the NMM shares in breach of Article 354 of the Commercial Code.464 However, any such breach would have been R\u00edo Grande's breach, not the Claimants'. Hence, no breach of the legality requirement is found here.\n\nTr. 69:4-10; Salame ER II, \u00b6 44 (3rd bullet point).\n\n276.\n\nAs a result, none of the six reasons the Respondent has advanced shows that the transfer of NMM shares from R\u00edo Grande to Quiborax on 17 August 2001 was in breach of Bolivian law. By the same token, none of these reasons shows that the transfers of NMM shares dated 4 and 10 September 2001 were in breach of Bolivian law. The Tribunal will examine the Respondent's additional illegality allegations.\n\n277.\n\nSeventh, the Respondent alleges that Mr. Fosk misrepresented that he was in La Paz in the minutes of 27 January 2003. The Respondent has not explained what rule this misrepresentation would have breached. In addition, any such breach would lie outside the temporal scope of the legality requirement, as it would have been committed *after* the investment was established. Lastly, this allegation is moot because the Tribunal already concluded that it has no jurisdiction over Allan Fosk.\n\n278.\n\nEighth, the Respondent alleges that the Claimants failed to pay the corporate income tax for foreign beneficiaries. However, the evidence disproves this allegation. As a matter of fact, the evidence shows that NMM first declared dividends on 3 December 2003465, and subsequently paid the applicable corporate income tax for foreign beneficiaries - Quiborax and Allan Fosk - upon distribution of those dividends in 2004.466 Therefore, the evidence negates any allegation of illegality in this respect.\n\nExh. CD-118.2.\n\nExhs. CD-149 and CD-150, attaching the completed F-54 tax forms.\n\n279.\n\nNinth, the Respondent alleges that the Claimants breached the rules concerning the registration of mining concessions. Yet, the Claimants did register the mining concessions with the Mining Registry and the Real Property Registry in December 2001467, and there is no evidence that pre-transfer registration is required. On the contrary, the Tribunal agrees with Claimants' legal expert, Prof. Rosenkrantz, that, pursuant to Article 823 of the Commercial Code468, registration of the mining concessions is not required for the validity of the transfer, but only to ensure its third-party effects, *i.e.* that third parties have notice of the transfer.469 In other words, failure to register the transfer in advance breaches no rule, but merely deprives the transfer of third-party effects as long as it is not effected. Accordingly, no illegality is found here.\n\nSalame ER I, \u00b6 68.\n\nIn line with Prof. Rosenkrantz's evidence, Prof. Salame also declared that Article 823 of the Commercial Code governs the issue of the third-party effects of registration (Salame ER I, \u00b6 63).\n\nTr. 430:20:431:1, 434:2-5.\n\n280.\n\nTenth, the Respondent alleges that the Claimants breached the rules concerning the accuracy of R\u00edo Grande's and NMM's financial statements. The Respondent has failed to explain what provision of Bolivian law the Claimants would have breached in this regard, and thus to substantiate this allegation. In addition, the Claimants were not responsible for the financial statements of R\u00edo Grande, and thus for any mistake contained therein. Finally, while the Claimants admitted that NMM's financial statement for 2001 contained a mistake470, the evidence suggests that this mistake was not deliberate but rather the product of inadvertence. Hence, the Tribunal deems that, to the extent that such mistake had still constituted a breach of Bolivian law, it would have been a trivial one and thus outside the subject-matter scope of the legality requirement.\n\n*Id*., at 538:13-18.\n\n281.\n\nEleventh and lastly, the Respondent alleges that the Claimants would have breached rules concerning the contents of the shareholders' registry. The Respondent has alleged for instance that, in addition to the secretary, NMM's chairman should also have signed each entry in the shareholders' registry. On the basis of Article 9 of the NMM bylaws471, the Tribunal believes that only the secretary's signature was required. More importantly, however, the Tribunal believes that, even if the Claimants had breached a rule concerning the handling of the shareholders' registry, an admittedly internal document with scant intrinsic probative value, any such breach would have been trivial and thus beyond the subject matter scope of the legality requirement.\n\nExh. R-12, Article 9. The Tribunal does not consider that Article 46 of NMM's bylaws provides otherwise.\n\n282.\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, the Tribunal concludes that Bolivia has not established that the Claimants breached the legality requirement. Accordingly, the Tribunal has *ratione materiae* jurisdiction over the Claimants' investment.\n\n**D. OBJECTION TO ADMISSIBILITY**\n---------------------------------\n\n283.\n\nIn addition to the jurisdictional objections, the Respondent also objects to the admissibility of the Claimants' claims on the ground that Quiborax and Allan Fosk concealed their participation in NMM, which it submits it is an abuse of nationality contrary to the principle of good faith. The Claimants deny that Quiborax and Allan Fosk concealed their condition of shareholders in NMM prior to the revocation of the mining concessions. The positions of the Parties are expanded upon below.\n\n**1. The Respondent's Position**\n--------------------------------\n\n284.\n\nEven if the Tribunal found *par impossible* that it has jurisdiction over the Claimants' claims, these claims are nonetheless inadmissible because the Claimants breached the principle of good faith in two different ways. First, the Claimants engaged in an abuse of nationality because they concealed that NMM's controlling shareholders -Quiborax and Allan Fosk - were Chilean. Second, the Claimants engaged in an abuse of process because they fabricated the conditions to establish ICSID jurisdiction. Since both abuses are contrary to the principle of good faith, the Claimants' claims are inadmissible.472\n\nOJ, \u00b6\u00b6 231-237.\n\n285.\n\nIn connection with the first argument, the Claimants had a duty under international law to disclose the Chilean nationality of NMM's shareholders.473 Nevertheless, the Claimants concealed Quiborax's and Allan Fosk's controlling participation in NMM. The newspaper articles upon which the Claimants rely do not disprove the allegations of concealment because these articles merely refer to \"connections\" between Quiborax and NMM not to shares or participation in the company. Notably, the absence of any evidence from the public registries that Quiborax and Allan Fosk were shareholders of NMM confirms that the Claimants concealed their nationality.474\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 238-246.\n\n*Id.*, at \u00b6\u00b6 232-237.\n\n286.\n\nBecause the Claimants concealed their nationality, they have lost the ability to rely on the Treaty for three reasons. First, international tribunals have consistently held that, when nationality is a requirement to bring an international claim, abuse of such nationality leads to the inadmissibility of the claims (*Flegenheimer v. The Italian Republic*). Second, ICSID tribunals have acknowledged that concealing one's nationality is contrary to good faith (*Desert Line v. Yemen*). Third, because of Claimants' concealment, the Respondent was unable to adapt its conduct to the disciplines of the Treaty (*Aucoven v. Venezuela*, *Saluka v. Czech Republic* and *Burlington v. Ecuador*).475\n\nOJ, \u00b6\u00b6 238-252; Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 243-244.\n\n287.\n\nSecond, the claims are inadmissible because Claimants engaged in an abuse of process. On the one hand, the Claimants fabricated evidence in order to be able to invoke the protections of the Treaty. These actions constitute fraud to the Treaty. On the other hand, the Claimants abused the ICSID system by concealing the participation of Quiborax and Allan Fosk in NMM, by revealing this participation only after the dispute arose, and by failing to show that they made any contribution whatsoever in NMM. In brief, the Claimants abused the system of ICSID arbitration.476 As a result, the claims must be declared inadmissible.\n\nOJ, \u00b6\u00b6 253-271.\n\n**2. The Claimants' Position**\n------------------------------\n\n288.\n\nContrary to the Respondent's allegations, the Claimants had no international law obligation to inform the Respondent that NMM shareholders Quiborax and Allan Fosk were Chilean. In any event, the evidence shows that the Claimants did not conceal the Chilean nationality of NMM's majority shareholders. Remarkably, the Respondent's assertion is directly contrary to the theory that led to David Moscoso's criminal conviction in Bolivia.477 Moreover, the Claimants have not fabricated the conditions to gain access to ICSID arbitration.478 It therefore follows that the claims are admissible.\n\nCM, \u00b6\u00b6 168, 180. The Claimants state that Mr. Moscoso's conviction was based on the theory that Quiborax and Allan Fosk *were not* shareholders of NMM and that they had fabricated evidence to create the opposite impression; by contrast, Respondent's allegation of concealment is based on the polar opposite factual premise: that Quiborax and Allan Fosk *were* shareholders of NMM.\n\n*Id.*, at \u00b6\u00b6 167-168.\n\n289.\n\nFirst, the Claimants had no obligation under international law to inform Bolivia that Quiborax and Allan Fosk were Chilean nationals.479 The Claimants acquired their investments through a series of private transactions. As such, the Respondent's approval or intervention was not required and the Claimants had \"no occasion or obligation\"480 to inform the Respondent of the nationality of NMM's majority shareholders. The *Aucoven* and *Saluka* cases upon which the Respondent relies are inapposite because in those cases the investment depended on conditions set by the host State. This is not the case here.\n\nRej., \u00b6 65.\n\n*Id*., at \u00b6 66.\n\n290.\n\nAt any rate, the facts show that the Claimants did not conceal the Chilean nationality of NMM's majority shareholders. It was widely known that Chilean nationals held a participation in NMM, as attested by numerous newspaper articles published in the Bolivian press. The Claimants further registered their investment in Chile, both with the Central Bank and with the Internal Revenue Service. Lastly, far from being unknown, the Chilean involvement was well known as Bolivia expropriated the Claimants' investment precisely because NMM had Chilean shareholders.481 Therefore, the cases on which the Respondent relies (*Flegenheimer*, *Desert Line*) are inapposite because the Claimants did not conceal their nationality.482\n\nCM, \u00b6\u00b6 169-171.\n\n*Id.*, at \u00b6\u00b6 174-176.\n\n291.\n\nSecond, the Claimants did no fabricate the conditions to gain access to international investment arbitration. The Claimants could only have fabricated the conditions to gain access to ICSID jurisdiction by acting in connivance with the Chilean Central Bank, the Chilean tax authorities, PricewaterhouseCoopers, Bolivian public notaries, attorneys and administrative personnel of Rojas law firm, Quiborax's employees, R\u00edo Grande, the Ugalde brothers, and David Moscoso. This is just implausible.483 No less implausible is Respondent's strategy to call into question and find fault with any document showing that Quiborax and Allan Fosk are shareholders of NMM, *e.g.* the NMM's shareholders registry, the NMM share certificates and the minutes of 17 August and 13 September 2001.484\n\nRej., \u00b6 38.\n\nCM, \u00b6\u00b6 181-193.\n\n**3. Analysis**\n---------------\n\n292.\n\nThe Tribunal must determine whether the Claimants' claims are inadmissible on the alleged ground that they breached the principle of good faith by committing an abuse of nationality and an abuse of process.\n\n293.\n\nFirst, Bolivia alleges that Claimants engaged in an abuse of nationality because they breached their international law obligation to disclose the Chilean nationality of NMM's majority shareholders, Quiborax and Allan Fosk. In support of this allegation, it relies on *Flegenheimer v. The Italian Republic*485, a decision on which both Parties have focused, and where the Italy-United States Conciliation Commission stated:\n\n\"In international jurisprudence one finds decisions [\u2026] allow[ing] a Respondent State to object to the admissibility of a legal action directed against it by the national State of the allegedly injured party, when the latter has neglected to indicate his true nationality, or has concealed it, or has invoked another nationality at the time the fact giving rise to the dispute occurred [...]\" (emphasis added).486\n\n*Albert Flegenheimer v. The Italian Republic*, Decision, 20 September 1958, pp. 378-379.\n\n*Id*., at p. 378.\n\n294.\n\nThe Tribunal is not convinced that this statement supports the proposition that an investor has a positive obligation to inform the host State of its nationality before - and thus regardless of whether - a dispute arises. It supports the view that an investor should not misrepresent its nationality (\"neglect[] to indicate his true nationality\") or take active steps to hide it (\"conceal[] it\"). This does not mean that the investor has a positive duty to advise the host State of its nationality. In addition, the statement focuses on \"the time [when] the fact giving rise to the dispute occurred.\"487\n\n*Id.*\n\n295.\n\nThe Respondent's reliance on *Burlington v. Ecuador* is likewise inapposite. In *Burlington*, the tribunal held that, once a dispute arises, the specificities of the Treaty required the investor to inform the host State of any allegations of Treaty breach before submitting the dispute to international arbitration, in order to afford the State an opportunity to take remedial action to avoid potential international responsibility.488 This holding presupposed a \"dispute\" between the parties.489 Bolivia's allegation that the investor should as a matter of principle inform the host State of its nationality even before a dispute arises, and regardless of the specific wording of the Treaty, finds no support in the considerably narrower *Burlington* holding. Moreover, the Claimants in this case did make allegations of Treaty breach as soon as the dispute arose, thereby affording Bolivia an opportunity to take remedial action and avoid potential international responsibility.490\n\n*Burlington Resources Inc. v. Republic of Ecuador*, Decision on Jurisdiction, 2 June 2010, \u00b6\u00b6 335, 338.\n\n*Id.*, at \u00b6 331.\n\nAllan Fosk's letter to Bolivia's President (Exh. CD-58).\n\n296.\n\nAt any rate, there is no evidence that the Claimants concealed Quiborax's or Allan Fosk's participation in NMM. As previously noted, the Claimants have submitted evidence predating the origin of the dispute from Bolivia's Commercial Register. This publicly-available record includes a file showing Allan Fosk as the legal representative of NMM491, and minutes of a shareholders' meeting featuring Quiborax, Allan Fosk and David Moscoso as shareholders of NMM.492 Furthermore, the Bolivian press articles of June 2004 suggest a degree of public awareness of the close connection between Quiborax and NMM, as shown by the references to \"Chilean capital\", \"Chilean shareholders\" and \"Chilean partners.\"493 the following terms: the \"alliance between company [NMM] and Chilean company [Quiborax]\"; \"[NMM] has Chilean capital\"; \"the representative of [NMM] is Chilean Allan Henry Isaac Fosk Kaplun, whilst the board of directors was appointed in a meeting carried out in the offices of Chilean corporation [Quiborax]\"; \"Chilean company Non Metallic\"; NMM is a Bolivian corporation \"even though it has Chilean minority shareholders related to the company Quibora\"; NMM operates with \"Chilean and Bolivian partners\" (Exh. CD-148).\n\nExh. CD-119.\n\nExhs. CD-158 and CD-118.1.\n\nThe Bolivian press articles referred to the relationship between NMM and Quiborax or Chile in\n\n297.\n\nSecond, Bolivia alleges that the Claimants engaged in an abuse of process because they fabricated the conditions to establish ICSID jurisdiction. In Section V(C)(1), the Tribunal already concluded that the Claimants did not fabricate evidence or engage in fraud for the purpose of gaining access to ICSID arbitration. Since Bolivia relies on the same facts and evidence to support its allegation in the context of this objection, the analysis of Section V(C)(1) applies here as well. Thus, in conformity with the its earlier conclusion, the Tribunal is satisfied that the Claimants did *not* abuse the ICSID investment arbitration system.\n\n298.\n\nIn conclusion, the Tribunal holds that the Claimants did not engage in either an abuse of nationality or an abuse of process. Accordingly, the Claimants did not breach the principle of good faith and their claims are thus admissible.\n\n**E. THE REQUEST FOR A DECLARATORY JUDGMENT PURSUANT TO ARTICLE 37 OF THE ARTICLES ON STATE RESPONSIBILITY**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**1. The Claimants' Position**\n------------------------------\n\n299.\n\nThe Claimants request the Tribunal to formally declare, pursuant to Article 37 of the Articles on State Responsibility (the \"Articles\"), that \"Respondent's conduct in the present arbitration violates its obligations under the [ICSID Convention] as well as its general obligation under international law to arbitrate fairly and in good faith.\"494 This is a permissible form of satisfaction under Article 37 of the Articles, and one that also lies within the Tribunal's inherent powers.\n\nCDJ, \u00b6 1.\n\n300.\n\nThe request is based on the following facts: (i) the Respondent's failure to suspend the criminal case in Bolivia; (ii) the Respondent's use of the criminal case to its own advantage in this arbitration; (iii) the Respondent's refusal to pay its share of the arbitration costs; and (iv) the Respondent's false accusations that the Claimants engaged in fraud.495\n\n*Id.*, at \u00a7 II.\n\n301.\n\nThe Respondent has committed an internationally wrongful act within the meaning of Article 2 of the Articles. That provision requires that (i) the act be attributable to the State, and (ii) the act constitute a breach of an international obligation of the State. Both elements are met in this case. First, the acts of the Respondent in this arbitration are attributable to the State of Bolivia. Second, Bolivia has breached its international obligations under the ICSID Convention and its obligation to arbitrate fairly and in good faith.496 Thus, the Claimants are entitled to full reparation for the injury caused under Articles 31 and 34 of the Articles.\n\n*Id.*, at \u00b6\u00b6 63-65.\n\n302.\n\nFull reparation shall take the form of either restitution, compensation or satisfaction. However, restitution and compensation are not appropriate remedies in this case. Rather, the proper remedy is satisfaction in the form of a declaration that Bolivia's conduct in this arbitration constitutes an internationally wrongful act. As a result of this declaration, the Respondent would have to cease its unlawful conduct.497 At the same time, because the arbitration is still ongoing, amidst other circumstances, the Claimants \"accept that it is for the Tribunal to determine whether it shall decide on Claimants' request for a declaratory judgment as part of its Decision on Jurisdiction, or as part of its final Award.\"498\n\n*Id.*, at \u00b6\u00b6 66-90.\n\n*Id.*, at \u00b6 91.\n\n303.\n\nIn sum, the Claimants request the Tribunal to declare that \"Respondent's conduct in the present arbitration is in breach of its international obligations under the ICSID Convention and its duty to arbitrate fairly and in good faith.\"499\n\n*Id.*, at \u00b6 92.\n\n**2. The Respondent's Position**\n--------------------------------\n\n304.\n\nBolivia argues that the Claimants' request for a declaration under Article 37 of the Articles is premature. The Tribunal cannot entertain the Claimants' request \"before an award on the merits.\"500 In addition, because the Tribunal only granted the Claimants leave to make submissions under Article 37 of the Articles, any request for relief exceeding the scope of Article 37 is inadmissible.501\n\nRDJ, \u00b6 21.\n\n*Id.*, at \u00b6\u00b6 24-28.\n\n305.\n\nFurthermore, even if the Tribunal entertained the Claimants' request at this juncture, it should conclude that (i) it lacks the power to grant the punitive relief requested by the Claimants, and (ii) relief under Article 37 is not available to investors.502\n\n*Id.*, at \u00a7 3.\n\n306.\n\nAt any rate, the Claimants' request is unsupported by the evidence. Specifically, the Claimants have failed to demonstrate that the criminal proceedings in Bolivia somehow breached Article 47 of the ICSID Convention, prevented the Claimants from accessing potential witnesses or were unlawfully used by Bolivia to produce evidence for this arbitration. Neither did they substantiate that Bolivia's non-payment of part of the advance on arbitration costs breaches the ICSID Convention and that Bolivia's jurisdictional objections breach its duty of good faith.503\n\n*Id.,* at \u00a7 4.\n\n307.\n\nIn sum, the Claimants' request (i) is premature and (ii) inadmissible to the extent that it exceeds the scope of satisfaction under Article 37 of the Articles. In the alternative, (iii) the Tribunal does not have the power to grant this punitive relief, and (iv) investors have no access to satisfaction under Article 37 of the Articles In the further alternative, (v) the evidence fails to support the Claimants' request, and (vi) Bolivia has not breached any international obligation, nor caused any damage to the Claimant that would not be compensable though monetary relief.504\n\n*Id.*, at \u00b6 157.\n\n**3. Analysis**\n---------------\n\n308.\n\nThe Claimants accept that \"it is for the Tribunal to determine whether it shall decide on Claimants' request for a declaratory judgment as part of its Decision on Jurisdiction, or as part of its final Award.\"505 The Respondent in turn maintains that entertaining this request \"before an award on the merits\"506 would be premature. Since this arbitration will proceed to the merits phase, and taking into account the Parties' positions on the matter, the Tribunal finds that it would indeed be more appropriate to entertain the Claimants' request for a declaratory judgment pursuant to Article 37 of the Articles in the final award.\n\nCDJ, \u00b6 91.\n\nRDJ, \u00b6 21.\n\n**VI. DECISION ON JURISDICTION**\n--------------------------------\n\n309.\n\nFor the reasons set forth above, the Arbitral Tribunal:\n\nA. On jurisdiction:\n\n1. Declares that it has jurisdiction over the claims of Quiborax and NMM;\n\n2. Declares that it has no jurisdiction over Allan Fosk's claims;\n\nB. On admissibility:\n\n1. Declares that the witness statement of Ricardo Ramos is admissible;\n\n2. Declares that Bolivia's objections to jurisdiction and the evidence arising from the Bolivian criminal proceedings are admissible;\n\n3. Declares that the claims of Quiborax and NMM are admissible;\n\nC. On further procedural steps:\n\n1. Will take the necessary steps for the continuation of the proceedings toward the merits phase by way of a procedural order to be issued after consultation with the Parties;\n\n2. Defers consideration of the Claimants' request for a declaratory judgment pursuant to Article 37 of the Articles on State Responsibility for subsequent adjudication;\n\n3. Reserves the decision on costs for subsequent decision."}, {"Title": "Award", "Type": "Award (Final)", "Date": "2015-09-16T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [{"Title": "Partially Dissenting Opinion of Professor Brigitte Stern", "Type": "Dissenting Opinion", "Date": "2015-09-07T00:00:00Z", "Content": "Partially Dissenting Opinion of Professor Brigitte Stern\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n1.\n\nAlthough I greatly respect and esteem my distinguished colleagues and although I generally agree with the outcome of the award, I could not concur with them on important legal findings, which have, in my view, far reaching consequences for the overall balance of the system of international investment arbitration, and as such, are important to the Parties.\n\n2.\n\nTo be clear, I agree with the majority that there has been an unlawful expropriation, because it did not follow due process and was discriminatory. This opinion is not written in order to take a position on the amount granted to the expropriated investor, an issue it does not address, but has to do with the method used to calculate it.\n\n3.\n\nIndeed, as stated by Lao-Tseu, \" *le but n'est pas seulement le but, mais le chemin qui y* *conduit* \", (\"the aim is not only the goal but the way to it.\"). I fundamentally disagree with both the theoretical approach followed and its concrete application to the facts of the case as performed by the majority.\n\n4.\n\nIn order to deal with an alleged expropriation, any tribunal has to follow three steps:\n\n- the legal qualification of the expropriation (I);\n\n- the establishment of the standard of compensation (II);\n\n- the method for the quantification of compensation (III).\n\n5.\n\nMy main disagreement with my colleagues concentrates on the method used to quantify the proper amount of compensation for unlawful expropriation. I will however briefly comment on the two other steps in order to present a coherent analysis.\n\n**I. The legal qualification of the expropriation**\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n6.\n\nAs far as the legal qualification of the expropriation is concerned, I agree that in this concrete case, the Tribunal was faced with an unlawful expropriation. However, I would be more peremptory than the Award concerning the theoretical dividing line between a lawful and an unlawful expropriation. There is indeed a complex on-going debate relating to the standards of compensation in case of a \"lawful expropriation\" and an \"unlawful expropriation\", resulting from some uncertainties concerning the distinction between these two concepts.\n\n7.\n\nIn this regard, it is stated in the Award, that \"(t)he Tribunal agrees with the Claimants that the BIT does not establish the standard of compensation for internationally wrongful acts. Article VI(2) of the BIT sets out the standard of compensation for lawful expropriations, possibly including expropriations that comply with all legality requirements but for the payment of compensation.\"1 Although the main focus of this dissent is not to dwell on the distinction between lawful and unlawful expropriation, I want to indicate here that I would have deleted the word \"possibly\" in the just cited sentence of the Award. Indeed, in doing so, I am faithful to the findings of the *Chorz\u00f3w* case2 in which the PCIJ explained the difference between a lawful and an unlawful expropriation, in the following way:\n\nThe action of Poland which the Court has judged to be contrary to the Geneva Convention is **not an expropriation** - **to render which lawful only the payment of fair compensation would have been wanting***;* it is **a seizure of property**, rights and interests which **could not be expropriated even against compensation***.* \"3\n\nAward, \u00a7 326.\n\n*Factory at Chorz\u00f3w,* Judgement on the Merits, 13 September 1928, *P.C.I.J. Reports*, Series A, No. 17 (\" *Chorz\u00f3w\"*), p. 46.\n\nThe Award indeed acknowledges the existence of such a distinction in its \u00a7 370, where it is stated that the ICJ in the *Chorz\u00f3w* case was \"faced with an expropriation that is unlawful not merely because compensation is lacking.\"\n\n8.\n\nIt should indeed not be lost of sight that States have in principle the sovereign power to expropriate. Such an expropriation has to respect certain conditions - public interest, due process of law, non-discrimination - and if performed in accordance with such conditions, entails, as a consequence, an obligation to compensate. This appears quite clearly from Resolution 1803 of the General Assembly of the United Nations, which states:\n\nNationalization, expropriation or requisitioning shall be based on grounds or reasons of public utility, security or the national interest which are recognized as overriding purely individual or private interests, both domestic and foreign. **in such cases the owner shall be paid appropriate compensation**, in accordance with the rules in force in the State taking such measures in the exercise of its sovereignty and in accordance with international law.4\n\nThis reflects the idea that some expropriations are not authorized and others are authorized. If the conditions for an authorized expropriation are not fulfilled or if the expropriation itself is forbidden by an international treaty, as was the situation in the *Chorz\u00f3w* case, the expropriation has to be deemed unlawful.\n\nGeneral Assembly Resolution 1803 (XVII) of 14 December 1962, \"Permanent sovereignty over natural resources\". Emphasis added\n\n9.\n\nIn sum, it results from *Chorz\u00f3w* that on one side of the dividing line there are unlawful expropriations which are not authorized and on the other side there are lawful expropriations including expropriations to render which lawful only the condition of payment of fair compensation is wanting.\n\n10.\n\nThe fact that an expropriation only lacking fair compensation should be treated in the same manner as a lawful expropriation, has indeed been recognized recently by the tribunal in *Mobil v. Venezuela*, where it is stated:\n\nHowever, the mere fact that an investor has not received compensation does not in itself render an expropriation unlawful.5\n\n*Mobil Corporation, Venezuela Holdings, B.V., Mobil Cerro Negro Holding, Ltd., Mobil Venezolana de Petr\u00f3leos Holdings, Inc.,* *Mobil Cerro Negro, Ltd., and Mobil Venezolana de Petr\u00f3leos, Inc. v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela*, ICSID Case No. ARB/07/27, Award of the Tribunal, 9 October 2014, \u00a7 301.\n\n11.\n\nIt has again been asserted, even more recently, in *Tidewater v. Venezuela* :\n\nFor present purposes, it suffices to conclude that the present expropriation was lawful, since it wants only compensation, a matter vouchsafed by the Parties to this Tribunal to determine according to the standards prescribed in the BIT.6\n\n*Tidewater Investment Srl, Tidewater Caribe, CA v. The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela*, ICSID Case No. ARB/10/5, ICSID Case No. ARB/10/5, Award, 13 March 2015, \u00a7 146.\n\n12.\n\nThe same analysis had also been performed earlier in the *ConocoPhillips v. Venezuela* Decision on Liability and Merits, where a lawful expropriation is described as an expropriation which only lacks the payment of the value of the investment at the time of the expropriation:\n\n... the cases cited by the Respondent in which the Tribunal fixed the compensation by reference to the value of the property at the time of the taking are cases where the taking was lawful and the only allegedly wrongful act was the claimed failure to pay the value of the investment to be fixed, either in terms of the relevant treaty or customary international law, at the time of the taking.7\n\n*ConocoPhillips Petrozuata B.V., ConocoPhillips Hamaca B.V. and ConocoPhillips Gulf of Paria B.V. v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela*, ICSID Case No. ARB/07/30, Decision on Jurisdiction and the Merits, 3 September 2013, (\" *ConocoPhillips\"),* \u00a7 342.\n\n13.\n\nAnd once such distinction has been clarified, the PCIJ presented \"the guiding principles according to which the amount of compensation due may be determined\"8 and explained that the compensation was not to be the same under both situations.\n\n*Chorz\u00f3w, op. cit*., note 2, p. 46.\n\n**II. The establishment of the standard of compensation**\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n14.\n\nAs far as the standard of compensation is concerned, the PCIJ indicated clearly in *Chorz\u00f3w* that such standard is different in case of lawful or unlawful expropriation.\n\n15.\n\nIf the conditions for an authorized expropriation are fulfilled, the expropriation has to be deemed a legal expropriation. In fact, whether compensation or reparation is due can only be ascertained when there is a qualification of the allegedly expropriatory act, either by agreement (rare), by a national court or by an international tribunal. This has important theoretical consequences. One of it is that, as long as it has not been finally determined whether there is or is not an expropriation, and whether it is or is not illegal, the obligation to compensate or repair does not arise. Therefore, it is only after it has been determined whether the expropriation is lawful or unlawful that the appropriate standard of compensation can be applied.\n\n16.\n\nIn case of a lawful expropriation including an expropriation to render which lawful only the payment of fair compensation would have been wanting, the standard of compensation is a **just compensation** :\n\nIt follows that the compensation due to the German government is not necessarily limited to the value of the undertaking at the moment of dispossession, plus interest at the date of payment. This limitation would only be admissible if the Polish Government had had the right to expropriate, **if the wrongful act consisted merely in not having paid** to the two Companies **the just price of what was expropriated** ; in the present case such a limitation... would be tantamount to rendering lawful liquidation and unlawful dispossession indistinguishable in so far as their financial results are concerned.9\n\n*Chorz\u00f3w, op. cit*., note 2, p. 47. Emphasis added. In the same vein in the *Amoco* case, the tribunal found that the expropriation was lawful but for the lack of compensation and endeavoured therefore to determine the amount of compensation due by a thorough analysis of the *Chorz\u00f3w Factory* case. In this case, the Iran-US Claims Tribunal made clear that \"the compensation to be paid in case of **a lawful expropriation (or of a taking which lacks only the payment of a fair compensation to be lawful)** is limited to **the value of the undertaking at the moment of dispossession.** \" *Amoco International Finance Corporation v. Islamic Republic of Iran,* reprinted in 15 Iran-US Claims Tribunal, Case No. 189, Partial Award No. 310-56-3, July 24, 1987, with a Concurring Opinion of Judge Brower \u00a7 196, Emphasis added.\n\n17.\n\nThis just compensation is the value of the undertaking at the date of the expropriation plus interests. In other words, an expropriation, which only lacks fair compensation to be lawful has to be treated as a **potentially lawful expropriation (or a provisionally unlawful expropriation until the tribunal has awarded the compensation due for the expropriation to be legal)** : this is so, because, as soon as the fair compensation needed for a lawful expropriation is granted, the situation has been reestablished and that condition for a lawful expropriation has been fulfilled.\n\n18.\n\nIn case of an unlawful expropriation, the standard of compensation is **full reparation** :\n\nThe essential principle contained in the actual notion of an illegal act... is that reparation must, as far as possible, wipe out all the consequences of the illegal act and re-establish **the situation which would, in all probability**, **have existed** if that act had not been committed. **Restitution in kind, or, if this is not possible, payment of a sum corresponding to the value which a restitution in kind would bear** ; the award, if need be, of damages for loss sustained which would not be covered by restitution in kind or payment in place of it - such are the principles which should serve for an act contrary to international law.10\n\n*Chorz\u00f3w, op. cit*., note 2, p. 47. Emphasis added. The tribunal in *Amoco* adopted the exact same reasoning, following step by step the PCIJ statements.\n\n19.\n\nThis being stated, the Award rightly indicates the standard of compensation in case of unlawful expropriation:\n\nThe Tribunal agrees with the Claimants that the BIT does not establish the standard of compensation for internationally wrongful acts.\n\n\u2026\n\nThis reparation must be \"full\", i.e., it must eliminate all consequences of the internationally wrongful act and restore the injured party to the situation that would have existed if the act had not been committed. If restitution in kind is impossible or not practicable, the compensation awarded must wipe out all of the consequences of the wrongful act. In this respect, ILC Article 36 provides that \"[t]he State responsible for an internationally wrongful act is under an obligation to compensate for the damage caused thereby.11\n\nAward, \u00a7 326 and \u00a7 328. Footnotes omitted\n\n20.\n\nI agree with these statements, with one *caveat*. The *caveat* is that this paragraph does not mention the expression \"in all probability\", which I consider of utmost importance, as will be elaborated on later in this opinion.\n\n21.\n\nAs a matter of fact, the majority also stated later in paragraph 372 of the Award, citing the exact wording of the *Chorz\u00f3w* case that\n\n... on the basis that \"reparation must, as far as possible, wipe out all the consequences of the illegal act and re-establish the situation which would, in all probability, have existed if that act had not been committed\", the Court concluded that an unlawful expropriation \"involves the obligation to restore the undertaking and, if this be not possible, to pay its value *at the time of the indemnification*, which value is designed to take the place of restitution which has become impossible.\"12\n\nAward, \u00a7 372. Emphasis in the Award, footnotes omitted. The two citations are respectively from pp. 47-48 and p. 48 of *Chorz\u00f3w.*\n\n22.\n\nI would like to cite the same excerpts of the *Chorz\u00f3w* decision, but with a different emphasis:\n\n... on the basis that \"reparation must, as far as possible, wipe out all the consequences of the illegal act and re-establish the situation which would, *in all probability*, have existed if that act had not been committed\", the Court concluded that an unlawful expropriation \"involves the obligation to restore the undertaking and, if this be not possible, to pay its value at the time of the indemnification, which value is designed to take the place of restitution which has become impossible..\n\n23.\n\nIn sum, and in a simplified way, what comes out of the *Chorz\u00f3w* case is that the compensation for a lawful expropriation is a just compensation represented by the value of the undertaking at the moment of dispossession and the reparation in case of unlawful expropriation, is restitution in kind or what would have been **in all probability** its value at the time of the indemnification, *i.e*. the time of the judgment.\n\n24.\n\nIt could therefore be said that the Tribunal is unanimous in considering that \"full reparation\" is due in case of an illegal expropriation. The main difference between my analysis and that of my two co-arbitrators is that I consider that this full reparation is the one foreseen in all probability at the time of the expropriation, while the majority considers that it is the full reparation as reconstructed in the world existing at the time of the award, which might be a completely different world than the one existing at the time of the expropriation, as will be explained in more details now.\n\n**III. The method for the quantification of compensation**\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n25.\n\nOnce the distinction between lawful and unlawful expropriation is accepted, this theoretical approach has to be translated into figures, in other words the damages have to be quantified. It is as far as the method for quantification of the damages is concerned, that my analysis diverges fundamentally from the approach of the Award. First, and foremost, I disagree with the theoretical approach on which the analysis of the majority is based, but - as already indicated - also with the concrete application of the theoretical premises to the different elements of the case, which appears contradictory and incoherent to me.\n\n1. The theoretical approach\n---------------------------\n\n26.\n\nThe majority had stated its approach in the following way: \"The Tribunal has determined by majority that *ex post* valuation is generally appropriate in this case, which entails assessing the value on the date of the Award, in principle using *ex post data*.\"13 However, my colleagues did not elaborate on what made the adopted approach \"generally appropriate\" in the case at hand.\n\nAward, \u00a7 422.\n\n27.\n\nStarting from the idea - which is uncontested - that in case of unlawful expropriation, there should be full reparation (which in *Chorz\u00f3w* meant simply that the probable profits until the date of the judgment had to be added to the value lost on the date of the expropriation), the majority adopted in fact a \"double\" *ex post* analysis, meaning an analysis performed at the date of the Award AND using hindsight, in other words data postdating the expropriation.\n\n28.\n\nThe majority attempts to justify its approach based on what is referred to as a careful analysis of the *Chorz\u00f3w* case14 as well as on the positions adopted by \"several investment arbitration tribunals.\"15\n\nAward, \u00a7 371: \"The majority has arrived at this conclusion after carefully analyzing the PCIJ's reasoning in *Chorz\u00f3w*.\" See, more generally, \u00a7\u00a7 371-378.\n\nAward, \u00a7 378.\n\n29.\n\nIn my view, a careful analysis of *Chorz\u00f3w* does not support the approach of the majority and it cannot be contested that there are extremely few awards having adopted an *ex post* analysis as has been used here. These two points will now be developed.\n\n***A careful analysis of the Chorz\u00f3w case***\n--------------------------------------------\n\n30.\n\nI will start by a review of the findings of the PCIJ, put in the legal and economic framework of the beginning of the twentieth century. First, I think that it is worth noting - to put things in perspective - that if the Court indeed considered that in case of an unlawful expropriation, the full reparation implied the payment of a compensation including what was called then the *damnum emergens* and the *lucrum cessans*, it has not considered any \"future\" lost profits, taking only into consideration probable profits lost between the date of the expropriation and the date of the judgment **. In other words, in no case did** ***Chorz\u00f3w*** **take into account any lost profits AFTER the date of the judgment.**\n\n**The basic principle stated in** ***Chorz\u00f3w*****, as already indicated, is that the reparation should reestablish the situation that would** ***in all probability*** **have existed in the absence of the illegal act.**\n\n31.\n\nThis basic principle has to be translated into monetary terms. In order to achieve this, *i.e*. trying to ascertain the compensation to be granted to the expropriated claimant in case of unlawful expropriation, the PCIJ decided to have recourse to an expert enquiry. It posed two questions which are the following:\n\nI. - A. **What was the value**, on July 3rd, 1922, expressed in Reichsmarks current at the present time, of the undertaking for the manufacture of nitrate products of which the factory was situated at Chorz\u00f3w in Polish Upper Silesia, in the state in which that undertaking (including the lands, buildings, equipment, stocks and processes at its disposal, supply and delivery contracts, goodwill and future prospects) was, on the date indicated, in the hands of the Bayerische and Oberschlesische Stickstoffwerke?\n\nB. **What would have been** the financial results, expressed in Reichsmarks current at the present time (**profits or losses**), which would **probably** have been given by the undertaking thus constituted from July 3rd, 1922, to the date of the present judgment, if it had been in the hands of the said Companies?\n\nII. - **What would be the value** at the date of the present judgment, expressed in Reichsmarks current at the present time, of the same undertaking (Chorz\u00f3w) if that undertaking (including lands, buildings, equipment, stocks, available processes, supply and delivery contracts, goodwill and future prospects) had remained in the hands of the Bayerische and Oberschlesische Stickstoffwerke.16\n\n*Chorz\u00f3w*, *op. cit*., note 2, pp. 51-52. Emphasis added.\n\n32.\n\nTo develop what was the underlying predicates of the valuation at the time of the judgment, the PCIJ indicated clearly that contrary to the first valuation at the time of the expropriation to which lost profits should be added, no such lost profits should in principle be added to a valuation performed at the date of the judgment, in unambiguous terms:\n\nAs regards the *lucrum cessans*, in relation to Question II, it may be remarked that the cost of upkeep of the corporeal objects forming part of the undertaking and even the cost of improvement and normal development of the installation and of the industrial property incorporated therein, are bound to absorb in a large measure the profits, real or supposed, of the undertaking. Up to a certain point, therefore, **any profit may be left out of account, for it** **will be included in the real or supposed value of the undertaking at the present moment.**17\n\n*Id*., p. 53. Emphasis added.\n\n33.\n\nIt is interesting to note that in fact the PCIJ has used two methods of calculation of the compensation due to replace restitution in case of unlawful expropriation:\n\n- one on the date of the taking, considering that compensation should be calculated as including the assets-based value of the undertaking at the moment of the interference plus the hypothetical probable lost profits until the date of the judgment;\n\n- one on the date of the judgment, this hypothetical assets-based valuation being supposed to include *ipso facto* most of the hypothetical probable lost profits up to the date of the judgment.18\n\nThe Court indeed did mention that some lost profits that would not be covered by the book value at the time of the award could be added.\n\n34.\n\nThe tribunal in *Amoco* has reiterated the same idea as the one expressed by the PCIJ:\n\nThe Court deems that, in this second hypothesis [evaluation at the date of the judgment] **the** **profits, real or supposed, accrued between the taking and the judgment would be for the most part incorporated in the supposed value of the undertaking at the time of the** **judgment**, since they would have been absorbed by the cost of upkeep of the corporeal properties and of improvement and normal development of the installation. If, however, there remains \"a margin of profit\", it \"should be added to the compensation to be awarded.\" On the contrary, if an investment of fresh capital would have been required for the normal development of the undertaking, the amount of such sums should be deducted.19\n\n*Amoco*, op. cit., note 8, \u00a7 204.\n\n35.\n\nTo simplify, the approach of the PCIJ in the the *Chorz\u00f3w* case, followed by a majority decision of the Iran-US Claims Tribunal in the *Amoco* case, considered that in case of lawful expropriation, all what was due was the value of what was lost at the time of the expropriation, while for an unlawful expropriation what was due was full reparation, which implied to compensate for what was lost at the time of the expropriation plus what could probably have been earned until the time of the judgement or award.\n\n36.\n\nIt is interesting to note that Judge Brower's in a Concurring Opinion in *Amoco* disagreed with the holdings of *Chorz\u00f3w* and *Amoco*, two decisions which do not consider that lost profits should be granted in case of lawful expropriation, as just mentioned:\n\nIn my view *Chorz\u00f3w Factory* presents a simple scheme: If an expropriation is lawful, the deprived party is to be awarded damages equal to the \"value of the undertaking\" which it has lost, including any potential future profits, as of the date of taking; in the case of an unlawful taking, however, either the injured party is to be actually restored to enjoyment of his property, or, should this be impossible or impractical, he is to be awarded **damages equal to the greater of** (i) the value of the undertaking at the date of the loss (again including lost profits), judged on the basis of information available as of that date, and (ii) its value (likewise including lost profits) as shown by its probable performance subsequent to the date of loss and prior to the date of the award, based on actual post-taking experience, plus (in either alternative) any consequential damages.20\n\nConcurring Opinion in Amoco, *op. cit.,* note 8, \u00a7\u00a7 17-18. Emphasis added.\n\n37.\n\nIt appears that the solution later adopted in *ADC*, which will be mentioned below, was already outlined in this Concurring Opinion of Judge Brower.\n\n38.\n\nUnfortunately, the PCIJ had never to deal with the results of the expert enquiry, as the parties entered into a settlement and the case did not go to the quantum phase. This has facilitated many inaccurate readings of the *Chorz\u00f3w* case. However, a certain number of elements can be underlined.\n\n39.\n\nIt appears that, according to the Court, **both valuations were hypothetical** : the first one included the probable profits as foreseeable at the date of the expropriation (\"the financial results... which would probably have been given by the undertaking...\"), the second one searched for the probable value at the date of the judgment (\"What would be the value at the date of the present judgement...\"). This last point has been underscored by the tribunal in *Amoco* :\n\nThe other method used by the Court in order to \"wipe out\" the consequences of the wrongful taking consists of an estimation of the value of the undertaking at the time of the judgment. The valuation of the undertaking is exactly the same, with the same components. Only the date changes. Furthermore, **the valuation is hypothetical**, since it refers to the undertaking as it would have been if it had remained in the hands of the expropriated owners.21\n\n*Amoco*, *op. cit*., note 8, \u00a7 204. Emphasis added.\n\n40.\n\nMoreover, I think that, if the PCIJ clearly suggested that a possible method was to use the date of the award to evaluate the expropriated property, it does not seem that the PCIJ had considered the possibility to use *ex post* information. It always insisted on the fact that the evaluations were to be made \"in all probability\", which to me, might well exclude the taking into account of real data **. The purpose of the reparation is to compensate the consequences of the illegal act of the state, as appreciated at the time of such expropriation, not the consequences of some posterior evolution of prices or evolution of demand or other circumstances.**\n\n41.\n\nTo summarize it in a simple way, the PCIJ in the *Chorz\u00f3w* case as well as the *Amoco* tribunal following the directions given by the PCIJ, considered that in case of lawful expropriation, all what is due is a fair compensation equivalent to the *damnum emergens*, while in case of unlawful expropriation the compensation has to cover both the *damnum emergens* and the *lucrum cessans.*\n\n42.\n\nThe problem is that the evolution of economic analysis and economic tools has rendered the distinction between *damnum emergens* and *lucrum cessans* very different. Indeed, the use of the DCF method22 which has been generalized in order to calculate the fair market value of an enterprise, introduces so to say the *lucrum cessans* into the calculation of the *damnum emergens*. The vocabulary has changed, but this does not mean that in case of unlawful expropriation, lost profits until the time of the award should not be added to the value of the enterprise at the time of the expropriation. I will revert later to this question.\n\nThe discounted cash flow (DCF) analysis is a method of valuing a project or a company using the concepts of the time value of money. All future cash flows are estimated and discounted to give their present values. The sum of all future cash flows, both incoming and outgoing (the result of these incoming and outgoing cash flow representing the profits), is the net present value, which is taken as the value or price of the cash flows in question: *\"\u2018Discounted cash flow value' means the cash receipts realistically expected from the enterprise in each future year of its economic life as reasonably projected minus that year's expected cash expenditure, after discounting this net cash flow for each year by a factor which reflects the time value of money, expected inflation, and the risk associated with such cash flow under realistic circumstances.* World Bank (eds): \"Legal Framework for the Treatment of Foreign Investment. Report to the Development Committee and Guidelines on the Treatment of Foreign Direct Investment\", 31 *I.L.M*. (1992), 1382, p. 7.\n\n***An analysis of the case law***\n---------------------------------\n\n43.\n\nThe majority relies on case law to support its approach. But, an analysis of the case law of investment arbitral tribunals shows that, in the overwhelming majority of cases having dealt with an unlawful expropriation, the date of the expropriation was adopted in order to calculate damages, based on what was foreseeable at that date. It cannot be contested that the decisions adopting an *ex post* valuation - in the extensive interpretation used by the majority -are extremely few: as a matter of fact, the majority itself, in the footnote relating to the \"several investment arbitration tribunals\", mentions only four treaty cases: *ADC v. Hungary, Siemens v. Argentina, ConocoPhilips v. Venezuela* and *Yukos v. Russia.* These are - to the best of my knowledge - the ONLY cases23 in almost thirty years of investment arbitration adopting the date of the award and *ex post* data, compared to the hundreds of cases relying on the date of expropriation and what was foreseeable on that date, in other words, the **hundreds of awards which have granted, in case of expropriation, both lawful and unlawful, the fair market value of the expropriated property, evaluated at the date of the expropriation, with the knowledge at that time.**\n\nTo these, one case has to be added, as mentioned in the Award, which is the case of *AMCO* decided in 1990, which was a contract case.\n\n44.\n\nIn other words, the approach adopted by the majority appears to me as an **ultraminority position**.\n\n45.\n\nThe extremely limited number of decisions having adopted the approach chosen by the majority would not be, in my view, a sufficient reason not to adopt it, if these decisions were convincing. But, according to me, this is not the case, as appears from a quick survey of the mentioned cases, which I will now briefly review.\n\n46.\n\nAn *ex post* valuation was performed in *ADC v. Hungary*24, in 2006, but the decision itself acknowledged that the immense majority of cases adopt the date of the expropriation as the valuation date. It should be noted at the outset that, in *ADC*, the tribunal stated that a valuation at the date of the award is an exceptional situation to be applied only when the value of the property has considerably increased between the date of the expropriation and the date of the award:\n\nThe present case is **almost unique** among decided cases concerning the expropriation by States of foreign owned property, since the value of the investment after the date of expropriation (1 January 2002) has risen very considerably while other arbitrations that apply the *Chorz\u00f3w Factory* standard all invariably involve scenarios where there has been a decline in the value of the investment after regulatory interference. **it is for this reason that** **application of the restitution standard by various arbitration tribunals has led to use of the date of the expropriation as the date for the valuation of damages.** 25\n\n*ADC v. Hungary*, ICSID Case No. ARB/03/16, Award of the Tribunal, 2 October 2006.\n\n*Id*., \u00a7\u00a7 496-497. Emphasis added.\n\n47.\n\nThus, the *ADC* tribunal itself recognizes that **the valuation at the date of the expropriation is the mainstream solution**, **even in case of unlawful expropriation**. In this sense, it supports more the solution advocated in this opinion than the minority position adopted by the majority in the Award.\n\n48.\n\nThe second case mentioned by the majority - *Siemens v. Argentina*26 - is even less convincing, and does not support the position of the majority, as - if read carefully - it uses indeed a valuation at the date of the expropriation. Although it is true that the *Siemens* tribunal has made some theoretical statements adopting the *ADC* approach27, the practical calculations were made on the date of the expropriation, as can be seen from the following extracts:\n\n... the Tribunal has the task to value the investment of Siemens at May 17, 2001. [Note that the date of the expropriation was 18 May 2001]\n\n\u2026\n\nThe Tribunal considers that the amount profits is very unlikely to have ever materialized\n\n\u2026\n\nFor these reasons, the Tribunal concludes that Siemens is not entitled to any compensation on account of profit loss.28\n\n*Siemens v. Argentina,* ICSID Case No. ARB/02/8, Award, 6 February 2007.\n\n*Id*., \u00a7 360.\n\n*Id*., \u00a7\u00a7 377, 379, 385.\n\n49.\n\nThe tribunal in *Siemens* thus considered the value at the date of the award to be the value at the date of expropriation plus lost profits until the date of the award if applicable, which were not considered to be so in the case at hand. As a consequence, this case cannot therefore be counted among the \"several\" decisions adopting the same approach as the majority.\n\n50.\n\nThe same theoretical position was then adopted in 2013 in *ConocoPhillips v. Venezuela*29 by a majority with a dissent of Georges Abi-Saab: \"The Tribunal, on the basis of principle and the authorities reviewed above, concludes that if the taking was unlawful, the date of valuation is in general the date of the award.\"30\n\n*ConocoPhillips*, *op. cit*., note 6.\n\n*Id.*, \u00a7 343.\n\n51.\n\nIt is unclear on which authorities exactly the tribunal bases itself, as it mentions mainly awards which said that full reparation shall be granted, but which used a valuation at the date of the expropriation to grant such full reparation. Moreover, although the tribunal has declared that the date of valuation is the date of the award, it has not yet proceeded to the calculation.\n\n52.\n\nFinally, in 2014, in *Yukos v. Russia*31, again, the date of the award was used, or rather the tribunal considered that the claimants had the right to choose between the valuation at the date of the expropriation and the valuation at the date of the award, a solution already mentioned in *ADC*. Although it is not the place to enter into the extremely complex specific aspects of this case, it can be mentioned however that as a first step the expert for the claimants has proceeded to a valuation on the date the claimants considered to be the date of expropriation, 21 November 2007. This valuation was then adjusted to the date considered by the tribunal to be the date of expropriation - 19 December 2004 and to the date of the award -30 June 2014, by the use of an \"index\" applied to the initial valuation, and not by any autonomous calculation. The point of departure was therefore the date of the expropriation, with the data available on that date.32\n\n*Yukos v. The Russian Federation*, PCA Case No. AA 227, Final Award, (\" *Yukos* \"), 18 July 2014.\n\n*Id*., \u00a7 1714: \"With regard to the DCF method, Claimants describe their approach as an attempt to reconstruct the \"pro-forma financial statements\" that the relevant Yukos entity would have presented in November 2007, based on the financial and operational data published by Rosneft and Gazprom Neft, which held the majority of Yukos' assets **at that point in time**.\" Emphasis added.\n\n53.\n\nBut the more interesting point, from my perspective, is to analyze how the tribunal tries to justify that the claimant can have the \"best of\" both worlds - the date of expropriation or the date of the award - a free choice which I consider as inacceptable, as I will explain.\n\n1763. The Tribunal also holds that, in the case of an unlawful expropriation, as in the present case, Claimants are entitled to select either the date of expropriation or the date of the award as the date of valuation. \u2026\n\n1767.... First, investors  must enjoy the benefits of **unanticipated events that increase the value** of an expropriated asset up to the date of the decision \u2026\n\n1768. Second, investors do not bear the risk of **unanticipated events decreasing the value** of an expropriated asset over that time period.... If the asset could be returned to the investor on the date where a decision is rendered, but its value had decreased since the expropriation, the investor would be entitled to the difference in value **, the reason being that in the absence of the expropriation the investor could have sold the asset at an earlier date** at its previous higher value....\n\n1768.... The Tribunal finds support for this conclusion in the fact that this approach has been adopted by tribunals in **a number of recent decisions** dealing with illegal expropriation.33\n\nEmphasis added. It is also worth mentioning the reference to unanticipated events, which clearly interfere with the link of causality between the unlawful expropriation and the enhanced damages claimed, as will be explained later.\n\n54.\n\nInterestingly, just as the majority in this Award mentioning several decisions, the \"number of recent decisions\" quoted under paragraph 1768 of the *Yukos* Final Award are limited to the following: \" *ADC* \u00b6\u00b6 496-97; *Siemens* \u00b6 352; *Amoco*, pp. 300-301.\" It has already been mentioned that *ADC* and *Siemens* do not really support the majority's analysis. As for the reference to *Amoco*, the note wrongly implies that it is a reference to the decision in *Amoco*, while the mentioned pages indeed are a reference to the Concurring Opinion of Judge Brower, mentioned earlier.\n\n55.\n\nWhat is the reasoning of the *Yukos* tribunal on that point? On the one hand, if the value has increased due to changed economic or other conditions, says the tribunal, the claimant has the right to reap the benefits of such increase, although this change is an unexpected fact unrelated to the expropriation. On the other hand, if the value has decreased due to unexpected changed economic or other conditions, says the tribunal, the claimant has the right to the higher value, because he could have sold its property before the decrease. One wonders why the same reasoning was not adopted in case of increase, as the claimant could have, just as well, sold its property before the increase...\n\n56.\n\nI consider that the solution suggested by *ADC* and *Yukos* is biased in favor of the investors and that the solution which systematically applies the harshest damages on the Respondent State resembles punitive damages, which are excluded in international law. A legal solution cannot just be based on what is more favorable to one of the parties.\n\n57.\n\nThe majority seemed uneasy about this issue and stated:\n\nSome authorities also suggest that such valuation date only applies if the value of the asset increased after the taking, not when it decreased. For present purposes, this issue can be left open.34\n\nAward, \u00a7 378. Footnote omitted.\n\n58.\n\nI do not think that the issue can just be ignored and left open, as did the majority. Indeed, there are only two possible options for the use of the date of the award with *ex post* information, and in my view none of them is satisfactory.\n\n59.\n\nIf the date of the award with *ex post* information is **only** used when it is in favor of the expropriated investor, I consider that this would be **against a fair interpretation** of international investment law. If, in order to be coherent, the date of the award with *ex post* information is **always** used, I consider that this can result in **injustice** for the expropriated investor.\n\n60.\n\nThis comforts my view that the fair solution is to be based on what was foreseeable at the date of the expropriation, which is indeed in line with the respect of the investor's legitimate expectations. This does not mean that the investor should not receive full compensation, which for the PCIJ in the *Chorz\u00f3w* case was not restricted to *damnum emergens*, but had also to include the probable *lucrum cessans*, until the time of the judgment. The vocabulary has changed, but the basic ideas remain.\n\n2. The concrete application in the case\n---------------------------------------\n\n61.\n\nOnce the majority had stated that it finds that in this particular case an *ex post* valuation is appropriate, which entails assessing the value on the date of the Award, in principle using *ex post data*, it did not apply such approach consistently for different reasons: data not certain enough, not appropriate, not available.\n\n62.\n\nIn my view, the difficulties faced by the majority in applying the DCF method at the time of the Award are inherent in their choice to use *ex post* information, which is not adapted to such method.\n\n63.\n\nHere, it is worth trying to understand more precisely how the DCF method works for the evaluation of a going concern. It is clear that this method is based on the projection into the future of the past results as well as the business plan for the future of the going concern which has been expropriated. The further in the future, the less reliable the forecasts are: many enterprises do not fulfill their business plan, their directors can change, their board can make wrong strategic decisions and so on. This uncertainty is so to say compensated by the fact that the further in the future a cash flow is considered, the more it will be discounted. This is a form of mathematical stability of this hypothetical method of valuation of an enterprise: data which are possibly erroneous are heavily discounted, so that the added errors do not drastically modify the final outcome. This is the beauty of the DCF method and explains its wide adoption. In other words, the internal equilibrium and the economic acceptability of the system is based on the fact that a cash flow which is far from the date of the expropriation will not have a major impact on the value of the enterprise. If however, the date of the evaluation is shifted to the date of the award - and in our case it is a projection of almost 10 years from the expropriation - the data concerning the enterprise is of very little reliability. And to apply to this probable data concerning the enterprise in a \" *but for* \" world elements of the real general economic world does not make that data more reliable. It just confuses the \" *but for* \" world and the real world, without rendering the \" *but for* \" world more real. In his book entitled 1Q84, the Japanese writer, Haruki Murakami, clearly explained that the rules of our real world with one moon could not apply in his imaginary world with two moons. The same is true here. And the fact that two brilliant arbitrators could not perform the exercise in a coherent manner - as will be indicated - results in my view from the inherent problems with the method they choose.\n\n64.\n\nThe majority indeed made a series of \"pragmatic\" adjustments to their chosen theoretical method in order to render it acceptable. This creates in the end a complete patchwork, which I consider contrary to the necessary previsibility of the law. I will now illustrate the different choices made by the majority in the Award, which, in my opinion, render the result somehow unpredictable.\n\n65.\n\nIn order to evaluate the enterprise, different elements have to be determined: production profile, cash flows - which implies a determination of prices, costs, capital expenditures and exchange rates - discount rate - which depends on the risk free rate of return, the equity risk premium, the country risk premium, the micro-cap size premium, and the cost of debt. In order to follow easily the technicalities presented, I indicate here that Navigant was the Claimants' expert and Econ One the Respondent's expert.\n\n**Concerning the production profile, the Award used** ***ex ante*** **data from 2001.**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n66.\n\nNavigant had presented an *ex ante* evaluation of the production profile, going from 59,861MT in 2004 to 171,022 Mt in 2014 and an *ex post* evaluation of 65,386 Mt in 2004 to 224,145 Mt in 2014 (in \u00a7 419 of the Award). Econ One has only presented an *ex ante* evaluation of 64,000 Mt in 2004 and 68,000 Mt in 2006, this figure remaining the same until 2029 (in \u00a7 421 of the Award). The majority considered that \"Navigant's relying solely on market growth to forecast production is speculative\" (in \u00a7 422 of the Award). In other words, the majority disregarded the real *ex post* information of the market growth and decided to use rather *ex ante* information dating back to figures projected in the 2001 Supply Contract between Quiborax and RIGSSA, which resulted in taking the Respondent's expert *ex ante* figures of a production profile of 64,000 Mt in 2004 reaching 68,000 Mt in 2006 and remaining stable (in \u00a7 439 of the Award).\n\n**Concerning the cash flows, the Award used** ***ex post*** **data, for prices, costs as well as exchange rates, while it used** ***ex ante*** **data for capital expenditures**.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n67.\n\nFor the ***prices***, Navigant used as prices for ulexite that would have been mined in Bolivia the *ex post* prices of ulexite mined in Chile, based on the average prices for the period 2009-2012 (in \u00a7 445 of the Award), while Econ One projected the prices of ulexite that would have been mined in Bolivia based on the *ex ante* prices of that Bolivian ulexite in 2004 (in \u00a7 447 of the Award). The majority retained the *ex post* Chilean prices for the longer period of 2004-2012, meaning prices based on *ex post* data (in \u00a7 450 of the Award).\n\n68.\n\nFor the ***costs***, Navigant used the actual *ex post* costs for water, fuel and transportation costs (in \u00a7\u00a7 452-453 of the Award), while Econ One has taken the *ex ante* prices in 2004 and has projected them by applying to them the long term inflation rate expected in the United States at the date of expropriation (in \u00a7 454 of the Award). The majority used Navigant's *ex post* costs, stating that it must be \"consistent with the pricing rationale chosen\" (in \u00a7 455 of the Award).\n\n69.\n\nFor ***capital expenditures***, Navigant has projected a big increase, based on *ex post* data of the evolution of the market (in \u00a7 457 of the Award), while Econ One was more conservative, basing its projection on *ex ante* data (in \u00a7 458 of the Award). The majority adopted Econ One capital expenditures as it had adopted the latter's *ex ante* production profile (in \u00a7 459 of the Award).\n\n70.\n\nFor the ***exchanges rates***, the majority \"has used the exchange rates used by Navigant in its *ex post* valuation, to which Econ One does not appear to object.\" (in \u00a7 462 of the Award).\n\n**Concerning the discount rate, the Award used sometimes** ***ex post*** **data and sometimes** ***ex ante*** **data for the different constituent elements.**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n71.\n\nEcon One has calculated the WACC in 2004 at 22.99 %, while Navigant calculated the WACC in 2013, at 14.61 % in its First Report and 10.78 % in its Second Report (in \u00a7 466 of the Award). The majority found a WACC of 18.4 % (in \u00a7 501 of the Award) based on an *ex post* risk free rate of return, an *ex post* equity risk premium, an *ex ante* country risk premium, an *ex ante* micro-cap size premium and finally an *ex post* cost of debt.\n\n72.\n\nFor the ***risk free rate of return***, Navigant based its calculation on the 10-year US Treasury bond which had a yield of 2.52 % in 2013 (in \u00a7 469 of the Award), while Econ One calculated the risk free rate based on the yield of a 20-year US Treasury bond in June 2004, which amounted to 5.43 % (in \u00a7 472 of the Award). The majority considered it more appropriate to choose the *ex post* calculation of Navigant based on data of 2013 (in \u00a7 474 of the Award).\n\n73.\n\nFor the ***equity risk premium***, Navigant calculated such premium to be 5 % as of 2009 (in \u00a7 476 of the Award), while Econ One calculated it at 7.2 % as of 2004 (in \u00a7 478 of the Award). The majority retained Navigant's *ex post* calculation, based on data of 2009, noting that these \"figures are more current than Econ One, and thus more appropriate for an *ex post* valuation.\" (in \u00a7 479 of the Award), i.e. 5 %.\n\n74.\n\nFor the ***country risk premium***, Navigant measured the country risk premium at 4.24 % for 2009 in its First Report and at 2.67 % for 2013 in its Second Report (in \u00a7 480 of the Award), Econ One considered that the country risk premium should be 13.83%, being the average between data published by Professor Damodaran in 2004, which was 9.75 % and data published the same year by Ibbotson, which was 17.91 % (in \u00a7 481 of the Award). Although the majority had at its disposal figures of 2013, it choose to use the 2004 *ex ante* figures, with the following explanation: \"Given both Parties' reliance on Prof. Damodaran's writings, the Tribunal is persuaded to use the country risk premium according to the data published by this source, i.e. 9.75%. The Tribunal is aware that this premium relates to 2004 and that the chosen *ex post* analysis calls for the use of a figure from 2013. However, the 2013 figure is not in the record, and the Tribunal considers that the 2004 data better reflects actual risk than the low premium proposed by the Claimant's expert.\" (in \u00a7 488 of the Award).\n\n75.\n\nFor the ***micro-cap size premium***, Econ One included a micro-cap size premium, based on 2004 data of 4.01 % (in \u00a7 489 of the Award), while Navigant did not present a figure, as it considered that such a factor was not applicable to the Claimants (in \u00a7 491 of the Award). The majority decided to use the 2004 *ex ante* figure, stating that \"(t)he Tribunal is aware that this premium relates to 2004 and that the chosen *ex post* analysis calls for the use of a figure from 2013. However, the 2013 figure is not in the record, and the Tribunal considers that the 2004 data is reasonable and thus may be applied in the present valuation\" (in \u00a7 493 of the Award).\n\n76.\n\nFor the ***cost of debt***, the majority reverted to *ex post* data. Navigant has proposed a cost of debt of 9.44 % in Bolivianos in its First Report and of 7.44 % again in Bolivianos in its Second Report, containing its adjusted *ex post* calculation (in \u00a7 496 of the Award), while Econ One proposed 11.93 %, based on *ex ante* data (in \u00a7 497 of the Award). The majority concluded: \"Navigant... has concluded that the appropriate rate is 7.44%. The Tribunal finds this rate reasonable for 2013. By contrast, it finds Econ One's rate of 11.93% (which was calculated for 2004) inappropriate.\" (in \u00a7 500 of the Award).\n\n77.\n\nTo summarize, the calculations performed by the majority are based on the following parameters, which I consider inconsistent:\n\n- Production profiles based on *ex ante* data of 2001\n\n- Prices based on *ex post* prices during the period 2004-2012\n\n- Costs based on *ex post* costs of 2013\n\n- Capital expenditures based on *ex ante* data of 2004\n\n- Exchange rates based on *ex post* data of 2013\n\n- Risk free rate of return based on *ex post* data of 2009\n\n- Equity risk premium based on *ex post* data of 2013\n\n- Country risk premium based on *ex ante* data of 2004\n\n- Micro size-cap premium based on *ex ante* data of 2004\n\n- Cost of debt based on *ex post* data of 2013.\n\n78.\n\nThis hazardous choice of dates makes the calculation unpredictable, and is not in line with a fair application of the rule of law, although I reiterate that, if I disagree with the random fashion in which the compensation was calculated by a majority composed of the President and my other colleague arbitrator, I have no specific quarrel in this case with the concrete amount. In other words, I don't have a problem with figures, I have a problem with the principles that were applied (or not applied) to reach these figures. Again, to be clear, I do not question the competence of my colleagues, I think that the difficulties they encountered in the application of the unusual method of valuation retained are so to say embedded in that method.\n\n79.\n\nI will try to explain why, in my view, **the valuation should always be made with the expectations of the claimant at the time of the expropriation**.\n\n***3. Valuation should reflect the claimant's legitimate expectations existing at the time of expropriation.***\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n80.\n\nThe PCIJ in the *Chorz\u00f3w* case has indeed made a reference to the date of the judgment, but it has to be clear that there is a difference with the method adopted by the majority in the Award: in *Chorz\u00f3w*, the valuation at the date of the judgment was used as an alternate method to a valuation at the time of the expropriation and the PCIJ made it clear that it was free to use one or the other method or to make its own calculations.35\n\nOf course, it is well known that financial expertise is not a mathematical science, and the Court considered therefore that it was wise to use two methods to determine the value of the expropriated property at the time of the award, and preferred to approach the question from two different angles: \"The Court does not fail to appreciate the difficulties presented by these two questions, difficulties which are however inherent in the special case under consideration, and closely connected with the time that elapsed between the dispossession and the demand for compensation, and with the transformations of the factory and the progress made in the industry with which the factory is concerned. In view of these difficulties, the Court considers it preferable to endeavour to ascertain the value to be estimated by several methods, in order to permit of a comparison and if necessary of completing the results of one by those of the others. The Court, therefore, reserves every right to review the valuations referred to in the different formulae: basing itself on the results of the said valuations and of facts and documents submitted to it, it will then proceed to determine the sum to be awarded to the German Government, in conformity with the legal principles set out above.\", *Chorz\u00f3w, op. cit*., note 2, pp. 53-54.\n\n81.\n\nIn my view, the calculation of the due compensation **should always assess the damage as seen at the time of the expropriation**. Such damages should be limited to what has been lost in case of a lawful expropriation, but to this has to be added damages for **what the investor expects at the time of the expropriation** in terms of future profits and expansion, in case of an unlawful expropriation. **The evaluation of damages takes place in a** ***but for*** **scenario, in which I consider that real data should not be introduced.** This is also entirely coherent with the *Chorz\u00f3w* decision.\n\n82.\n\nFirst, it appears to me that the facts known at the date of the expropriatory act should always be the reference.\n\n83.\n\nAn *ex post* valuation meaning a valuation taking into account events and evolutions that took place after the illegal act is arbitrary. The facts existing after the date of the award have nothing to do with the facts of the case. The date of expropriation is the only one that is objectively related to the dispute.\n\n84.\n\nSecond, if *ex post* information is used, **the amount of damages granted will vary with the date of the award**.\n\n85.\n\nIf the valuation is made using *ex post* information, the use of hindsight is arbitrary in that it considers all facts up to a fixed point in time - the time of the award - that bears no relation to the events in issue (except that it is later). If the award had been rendered a year earlier or three years later, the facts would likely have been different, and the award different in amount.\n\n86.\n\nTo illustrate this, let us just imagine a plant which has been expropriated. Shortly before the time of the award, it has been destroyed by a hurricane. Using *ex post* information and valuing the compensation that would replace restitution, would result in refusing any compensation to the expropriated investor, which does not seem fair.\n\n87.\n\nThird, **a basic rule on reparation is causation** : the damage that has to be compensated has to be the result of the illegal act.\n\n88.\n\nArticle 31 of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility points clearly to the necessity of a causal link between the damage and the illegal act.\n\n*Article 31. Reparation*\n\n1. The responsible State is under an obligation to make full reparation for the injury **caused** by the internationally wrongful act.\n\n2. Injury includes any damage, whether material or moral, **caused** by the internationally wrongful act of a State.36\n\nEmphasis added.\n\n89.\n\nThe majority has indeed recognized the necessity of a causal link and has stated as follows:\n\nThe harm for which reparation is sought must be caused by the wrongful act. It is generally accepted that factual causation is not sufficient. An additional element linked to the nature of the cause, sometimes called \"cause in law\" or adequate causation is required. It is in this context that foreseeability is sometimes resorted to. The Commentary to Article 31 to the ILC Articles expresses this additional requirement for an adequate cause as follows:\n\n[C]ausality in fact is a necessary but not a sufficient condition for reparation. There is a further element, associated with the exclusion of injury that is too \"remote\" or \"consequential\" to be the subject of reparation. In some cases, the criterion of \"directness\" may be used, in others \"foreseeability\" or \"proximity\".37\n\nAward, \u00a7 381. Footnotes omitted.\n\n90.\n\nThe citation on foreseeability found in paragraph 381 of the Award deals in my view only with the consequences flowing from an illegal act in an uninterrupted chain of events, while the present situation is one of the interplay of complementary events, an illegal act and a fluctuation of the market. The distinction between these two types of situations - not always well perceived - has been extensively developed in my thesis:38\n\n*Pour savoir dans quels cas le lien de causalit\u00e9 entre l'acte illicite et le dommage est consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme suffisant pour ouvrir un droit \u00e0 r\u00e9paration, nous allons \u00e9tudier successivement ce que l'on peut appeler d'une part le lien de causalit\u00e9 simple, d'autre part le lien de causalit\u00e9 complexe.*  \n*L'\u00e9tude du lien de causalit\u00e9 simple implique la d\u00e9termination de l'ensemble des faits qui* *peuvent \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9s comme des cons\u00e9quences d'un seul acte illicite...*  \n*L'\u00e9tude du lien de causalit\u00e9 complexe englobe par contre tous les probl\u00e8mes soulev\u00e9s par* *l'interf\u00e9rence de plusieurs causes - parmi lesquelles se trouve un acte illicite - dans la production d'un dommage...*\n\nFree translation:\n\nTo know in which cases the causal link between the unlawful act and the damage is deemed sufficient to give rise to a right to reparation, we will successively analyze what can be called, on the one hand, the simple causal link, and on the other hand, the complex causal link.  \n The analysis of the simple causal link involves determining the set of facts that can be considered a consequences of a single unlawful act...  \n The analysis of the complex causal link, by contrast, includes all the issues arising from the interference of several causes - among which is an unlawful act - in the production of damage \u2026\n\nAll this has been discussed at length in my thesis, Brigitte Bollecker-Stern, *Le pr\u00e9judice dans la th\u00e9orie de la responsabilit\u00e9 internationale*, Paris, Pedone, 1973.\n\n91.\n\nIt is my view that the majority has reasoned in terms of what I called \" *un lien de causalit\u00e9 simple* \" [\"a simple causal link\"], while the situation is one of a \" *lien de causalit\u00e9 complexe* \" [\"complex causal link\"]. In order to visualize the two situations I am referring to, I can provide the following schemes:\n\nForeseeability deals with the causal link, as illustrated in the following chart:\n\n92.\n\nComplementary intervention deals with the intervention of several causes of damages and is illustrated in the following chart:\n\n93.\n\nForeseeability like proximity is a test to determine the consequences that can be considered as resulting from an illegal act and thus attributable to the author of this illegal act. This appears quite clearly if the citation relied on by the majority is reintroduced in its full context:\n\n94.\n\nThe Commentary to Article 31, indeed, states:\n\n(9) Paragraph 2 addresses a further issue, namely the question of a causal link between the internationally wrongful act and the injury. It is only \"[i]njury. caused by the internationally wrongful act of a State\" for which full reparation must be made. This phrase is used to make clear that the subject matter of reparation is, globally, the injury resulting from and ascribable to the wrongful act, rather than any and all consequences flowing from an internationally wrongful act.\n\n(10) The allocation of injury or loss to a wrongful act is, in principle, a legal and not only a historical or causal process. Various terms are used to describe the link which must exist between the wrongful act and the injury in order for the obligation of reparation to arise. For example, reference may be made to losses \"attributable to [the wrongful] act as a proximate cause\", or to damage which is \"too indirect, remote, and uncertain to be appraised\", or to \"any direct loss, damage including environmental damage and the depletion of natural resources or injury to foreign Governments, nationals and corporations as a result of \" the wrongful act. Thus, causality in fact is a necessary but not a sufficient condition for reparation. There is a further element, associated with the exclusion of injury that is too \"remote\" or \"consequential\" to be the subject of reparation. In some cases, the criterion of \"directness\" may be used, in others \"foreseeability\" or \"proximity\".39\n\nCommentary to the ILC Articles on State Responsibility, Text adopted by the International Law Commission at its fifty-third session, in 2001, and submitted to the General Assembly as a part of the Commission's report covering the work of that session (A/56/10). The report, which also contains commentaries on the draft articles, appears in the *Yearbook of the International Law Commission, 2001*, vol. II, Part Two, pp. 92-93.\n\n95.\n\nForeseeability therefore does not deal with the question of the role played by external causes. Indeed, it is always \"foreseeable\" that others causes than the illegal act can happen and enhance or diminish the damage.\n\n96.\n\nA complementary intervention imposes to distinguish what is the foreseeable damage resulting from an illegal act and what damages result from other causes like the fluctuations in the market:\n\n*En cas d'intervention compl\u00e9mentaire d'un acte illicite et d'une autre cause, une ventilation doit \u00eatre op\u00e9r\u00e9e et r\u00e9paration ne peut \u00eatre exig\u00e9e de la part de l'Etat \u00e0 qui est imputable l'acte illicite, qu'\u00e0 concurrence de la quote-part du pr\u00e9judice aff\u00e9rente audit acte illicite seul*.40\n\nFree translation:\n\nIn the event of complementary intervention of an unlawful act and any other cause, a distinction should be made, and compensation can only be required from the State to which the unlawful act is attributable in proportion to the share of the damage caused by that unlawful act only.\n\n*Id*., p. 285.\n\n97.\n\nTwo arbitration cases can illustrate this solution. First, the case of *Yuille & Shortridge v. Portugal*41, in which the applicant was complaining from an illegal act performed by the Portuguese authorities, but where its profits had also diminished because of a general decline in the market. It has been clearly stated in the award, that the damage to be compensated by Portugal was only the damage caused by its own illegal act and not the damage resulting from the general economic situation:\n\n*Il va sans dire que les pertes dues \u00e0 la situation g\u00e9n\u00e9rale des affaires et \u00e0 d'autres causes ext\u00e9rieures ne pouvaient entrer en ligne de compte dans le calcul des dommages et int\u00e9r\u00eats.*\n\nFree translation:\n\nIt goes without saying that the losses attributed to the general business climate and other external causes cannot be taken into account in the calculation of damages.42\n\nRecueil des arbitrages internationaux, *Lapradelle et Politis*, II, Award, 21 October 1861. p. 94.\n\n*Id.*, p. 110.\n\n98.\n\nThe same solution in the case of *Lacaze v. Argentina*,43 where a distinction was made between the consequences of the illegal behavior of the Argentine authorities and the consequences of the general economic situation.\n\n*Id*., p. 290.\n\n99.\n\nIt is quite clear that the fluctuations of the market do not flow from the illegal act, it is an independent event, although it might indeed aggravate - or diminish - the injury. But in such a situation, only the injury foreseen at the time of the illegal act and unanticipated events - to use the vocabulary of *Yukos* cited earlier - can be attributed to the author of the wrongful act. The question here is the combined existence of an illegal act and of fluctuations in the market. Also if the \"fluctuations of the market are objectively foreseeable\", as stated by the majority, this would be true both for increases and decreases of the lost profits and would give credit to the solution consisting of denying any reparation for lost profits if the market has collapsed, which I do not consider to be an appropriate solution. The fluctuations of the market are not a foreseeable consequence of the illegal act, they constitute an external event, which indeed is foreseeable, just as is foreseeable the ever changing nature of human life.\n\n100.\n\nUsing *ex post* data clearly introduces an **externality** as far as the consequences of the illegal act is concerned.\n\n101.\n\nThis means that evolutions posterior to the illegal act (*ex post* information) that might cause a diminution or an increase of the damage suffered, are not caused by the illegal act and therefore should not be taken into account when calculating the reparation due.\n\n102.\n\nFourth, I want to repeat that the solution **to use alternatively** ***ex post*** **information or** ***ex ante*** **information**, depending on what is more favorable to the investor, as has been suggested in *ADC* and *Yukos,* **is not in line with the certainty of the rule of law.**  Such a solution is against a fair interpretation of investment law, which should be a balanced interpretation, as noted in *El Paso v. Argentina* :\n\nThis Tribunal considers that a balanced interpretation is needed, taking into account both State sovereignty and the State's responsibility to create an adapted and evolutionary framework for the development of economic activities, and the necessity to protect foreign investment and its continuing flow..44\n\n*El Paso Energy International Company v. The Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/03/15, Award on Jurisdiction, 27 April 2006, \u00a7 70.\n\n103.\n\nAnd if it would be said that the ***ex post*** **evaluation should always be used in case of illegal expropriation**  (which would at least be more coherent), the result might be unfair, and **would not be in line with justice**. Indeed, if the formula \"to reinstate the investor in the situation it would have been in the absence of an illegal act\" is taken to mean to do this at the time of the award, and implies an *ex post* valuation, it should result as a consequence, that if *ex post* valuation is accepted, in case of a complete collapse in the price of a commodity, the investor could see its compensation reduced to *nil*, while the investor had reasonable expectations of future profits at the time of the expropriation. This is a supplementary - and quite fundamental - reason why I am reluctant to accept *ex post* information.\n\n104.\n\nIn other words, for all these reasons, I think that the use of *ex post* information is not in line both with legal and economic principles. This does not mean that the expropriated investor is not entitled to receive the value, as foreseen at the date of expropriation, which its property would, in all probability, have at the time of the award. This does therefore mean that, in case of unlawful expropriation, the damages should not be restricted to the value of the expropriated property at the time of expropriation. Lost profits to the date of the award should indeed be added.\n\n105.\n\nAgain, I regret to have felt compelled to write this long Opinion, but I consider that the principles at stake are extremely important and were in need of clarification."}], "Content": "Award\n-----\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| **TABLE OF ABBREVIATIONS** |\n| BIT or Treaty | Bilateral Investment Treaty; specifically \"Agreement between the Republic of Bolivia and the Republic of Chile on the Encouragement and Reciprocal Protection of Investments,\" signed on 22 September 1994 and in force since 21 July 1999 |\n| CCSS | Claimants' Closing Statement Slides for the hearing on merits of 28-30 October 2013 |\n| CDJ | Claimants' Request for Declaratory Judgment of 27 May 2011 |\n| Claimants | Quiborax S.A.

INTRODUCTION**\n-------------------\n\n**A. The Parties**\n------------------\n\n**1. The Claimants**\n--------------------\n\n1.\n\nThe Claimants are Quiborax S.A. (\"Quibora\"x), a Chilean mining company, and NonMetallic Minerals S.A. (\"NMM\"), a Bolivian mining company (collectively, the \"Claimants\").\n\n2.\n\nQuiborax, a corporation created under the laws of Chile, is a mining company dedicated in particular to the extraction of ulexite, a non metallic mineral, and to the manufacture of products derived from this mineral, including boric acid. It operates in the northern part of Chile, near the border with Bolivia, and it is mostly owned by members of the Fosk family. NMM, a corporation created under the laws of Bolivia, is a mining company that operated in the R\u00edo Grande delta in Bolivia.

The Respondent**\n---------------------\n\n4.\n\nThe Respondent is the Plurinational State of Bolivia (\"Bolivia\" or the \"Respondent\").\n\n5.\n\nBy letter dated 3 April 2007, the Respondent designated Mr. Paul S. Reichler and the law firm Foley Hoag LLP as external counsel in these proceedings. By letter of 5 January 2010, Foley Hoag LLP announced that as of that date it would no longer serve as counsel for the Respondent. By letter dated 18 March 2010, the Respondent informed the Tribunal that it appointed Prof. Pierre Mayer, Dr. Eduardo Silva Romero and Mr. Jos\u00e9 Manuel Garc\u00eda Represa of the law firm Dechert (Paris) LLP, as external counsel in this case. On 7 December 2012, the Respondent updated the contact information of the government officials acting in this case and confirmed that Dechert (Paris) continued to act as external counsel. On 29 March 2013, Dechert updated the contact information of the government officials and Dechert's counsel (in Paris and Washington DC) representing the Respondent. On 12 September 2013, Dechert informed the Tribunal that in view that its contract expired on 30 June 2013, it would no longer serve as counsel for the Respondent. Dechert attached a letter of the same date from the then Attorney General, Mr. Hugo Ra\u00fal Montero Lara, authorizing Dechert's communication. By letter of September 30, 2013, the Respondent informed the Tribunal that it appointed Mr. Diego Brian Gosis of the law firm Gomm & Smith, P.A. (Miami) as its external counsel. By email of 23 October 2013, the Centre informed both parties that at the request of the Respondent, the email addresses of Bolivia's external counsel had been updated. Until 21 March 2014, the Respondent was represented in this arbitration by Mr. Hugo Ra\u00fal Montero Lara, Attorney General of Bolivia, Ms. Elizabeth Arismendi, Deputy Defense Attorney of Bolivia, Mr. Edgar Pozo, General Director of Investment Litigation and Arbitration Defense and Mr. Leonardo Anaya (Attorney General's office), and by Mr. Diego Gosis of Gomm & Smith P.A.\n\n6.\n\nOn 21 March 2014, Bolivia submitted a letter to ICSID informing that Dr. H\u00e9ctor Arce Zaconeta and Dr. Pablo Menacho Diederich had been appointed Attorney General and Deputy Attorney of Defense and Legal Representation of the State, respectively. By emails of 3 and 4 June 2014, the Respondent updated the contact information of the government officials and its external counsel. On 13 March 2015 and 30 May 2015, counsel for the Respondent updated its contact information. On 8 June 2015 the Respondent submitted an email updating the contact information of the government officials acting in this case (further clarified on 16 June 2015). On 7 September 2015, the Respondent informed that as of that date all communications concerning these proceeding should be only notified to the following persons:\n\nDr. Hector Arce Zaconeta, Attorney General of Bolivia (*Procurador General del Estado Plurinacional de Bolivia*)\n\nDr. Pablo Menacho Diederich, Deputy Attorney for the Defense and Legal Representation of the State (*Sub-Procurador de Defensa y Representaci\u00f3n Legal del Estado*)\n\nDr. Franz Zubieta Mariscal, General Director of Arbitral and Jurisdictional Defense (Director General de Defensa Arbitral y Jurisdiccional)\n\nDra.

THE FACTS1**\n------------------\n\n*See also* Decision on Jurisdiction of 27 September 2012 (\"Decision on Jurisdiction\"), \u00b6\u00b6 6-18.\n\n7.\n\nThe Salar de Uyuni (also referred to as the \"Gran Salar de Uyuni\") is the largest dry salt lake in the world. It is located in the Bolivian region of Potos\u00ed and is a fiscal reserve since 1965 (*Decreto Supremo*, \"D.S.\" or \"Decree\" 7,150).2 According to the Mining Code issued on the same year, mining operations in a fiscal reserve area could only be authorized through a special legal provision.3\n\nExh. R-232. In 1986, Decree 21,260 declared the Salar de Uyuni's basin a fiscal reserve as well and established 13 coordinates for its delimitation (Exh. R-235).\n\nArticle 20 (Exh. R-233).\n\n8.\n\nIn 1985, Law 719 created the *Complejo Industrial de los Recursos Evapor\u00edticos del Salar de Uyuni* (\"CIRESU\"),4 the only entity authorized to manage the operations of the mineral resources of the Salar de Uyuni's basin. On 3 April 1992, CIRESU entered into a mining concession lease agreement with *Sociedad Colectiva Minera R\u00edo Grande* (\"SOCOMIRG\"). An addendum was signed in 1997.5\n\nExh. R-234.\n\nMentioned in Decree 27,548 (Exh. CD-41).\n\n9.\n\nIn 1993, Italian companies Aquater S.p.a. and EniChem S.p.a., commissioned by the Bolivian government and sponsored by Italy, carried out a study of the mineral reserves of a part of the fiscal reserve of the Salar de Uyuni.6 The results of this study were presented in a report to the Ministry of Mining in May 1993, under the title *Informe Final de Explotaci\u00f3n de Minerales Met\u00e1licos y no Met\u00e1licos en el Sudoeste de Bolivia*.7\n\nThe sampled surface was 21.6 km.\n\nExh. R-236. This report will be discussed in detail in Section VII below, when addressing the Claimants' claim for reparation and in particular the estimates of proven and probable reserves of the concessions.\n\n10.\n\nIn 1998, Bolivia enacted Law 1,854 (also known as *Ley Valda*), which reduced the fiscal reserve area of the Salar de Uyuni. Its sole article reads as follows:\n\nThe fiscal reserve of the *Gran Salar de Uyuni* is hereby declared, comprised within the perimeter that corresponds to the salt crust.8\n\nExh. CD-7, Tribunal's translation. The original states: \"Se declara la reserva fiscal del Gran Salar de Uyuni, comprendida en el per\u00edmetro que corresponde a la costra salina.\"\n\n11.\n\nThe *Servicio Nacional de Geolog\u00eda y Miner\u00eda* (\"SERGEOMIN\") determined the perimeter corresponding to the salt crust under a system of coordinates in 2002.9\n\nDecree 26,574 (Exh. R-239).\n\n12.\n\nAs a result of the *Ley Valda*, 43 new mining concessions were requested between 1998 and 2004 in an area that had previously been a fiscal reserve. Seven of these concessions10 were granted to the Bolivian company *Compa\u00f1\u00eda Minera R\u00edo Grande Sur S.A*. (\"RIGSSA\"), owned by Bolivian businessmen (and former officials of the Ministry of Mining) Messrs. David Moscoso and \u00c1lvaro Ugalde.\n\nDo\u00f1a Juanita, Borateras de Cuevitas, Tete, Basilea, Inglaterra, Don David and Sur.\n\n13.\n\nThe granting of these concessions caused discomfort to the local communities and in 2001 and 2003 Potos\u00ed representatives presented bills to Congress to reverse the *Ley Valda* and revert the mining concessions to the Bolivian State.11\n\nExhs. CD-28 and CD-38.\n\n14.\n\nIn 1999, Messrs. David Moscoso and \u00c1lvaro Ugalde approached Mr. Carlos Shuffer at Quiborax to inform him of a business project involving mining concessions in the R\u00edo Grande area.12 As a consequence of negotiations between Quiborax and RIGSSA, both companies entered into an Exclusive Supply Contract for fifteen years on 12 January 2001.13 This contract gave Quiborax the right of first refusal regarding the concessions, should RIGSSA decide to sell them.\n\nShuffer WS, \u00b6\u00b6 16, 18; Fosk WS, \u00b6 31.\n\nExh. CD-16.\n\n15.\n\nOn 12 March 2001, Mr. \u00c1lvaro Ugalde, his brother Gonzalo Ugalde and Quiborax executed a stock purchase agreement regarding shares in RIGSSA.14 The shares were, however, never transferred and, instead, Quiborax decided to create a new Bolivian company (Non-Metallic Minerals S.A., \"NMM\") that would act as its investment vehicle.\n\nExh. CD-17.\n\n16.\n\nIn June 2001, Quiborax contacted Mr. Fernando Rojas, a partner in the law firm C., R. & F. Rojas Abogados, who was retained as Quiborax's legal counsel in Bolivia shortly afterwards. A month later, NMM was constituted by Mr. Fernando Rojas and two of his employees, Ms. Dolly Paredes and Ms. Gilka Salas.15\n\nExh. CD-23.\n\n17.\n\nOn 3 August 2001, RIGSSA contributed seven mining concessions to NMM, with a resulting capital increase equivalent to 26,680 shares.16 RIGSSA thus became the majority shareholder of NMM.\n\nExh. CD-25\n\n18.\n\nLater that month, RIGSSA transferred all of its newly acquired shares in NMM to Quiborax, 13,103 of which were transferred in turn by Quiborax to Mr. David Moscoso on 4 September 2001. On that same day, Quiborax transferred to Mr. David Moscoso an additional 267 shares, which were immediately sold back to Quiborax for US$ 9,985. On 10 September 2001, Mr. Fernando Rojas and Ms. Dolly Paredes transferred their shares in NMM (58 and one, respectively) to Quiborax, while Ms. Gilka Salas transferred her sole share to Mr. Allan Fosk. As a consequence, the definitive shareholder configuration of NMM was set.17 Three days later, the NMM Board of Directors was elected, with Mr. David Moscoso as Chairman, Mr. Allan Fosk as Vice Chairman and Mr. Isaac Frenkel as Secretary.18 The corporate structure of Quiborax's investment vehicle in Bolivia was therefore concluded by 13 September 2001, and did not change until the events giving rise to this dispute.19 The shareholders of NMM are Quiborax (50,995%), Mr. David Moscoso (49%) and Mr. Allan Fosk (0,005%).\n\nExh. CD-24.\n\nExh. CD-26.\n\nThe Tribunal came to this conclusion during the jurisdictional phase. *See* Decision on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 192.\n\n19.\n\nNMM obtained four additional mining concessions, two on 18 April 2002,20 and two additional ones on 20 July 2003,21 ultimately owning a total of eleven.22\n\nPococho and La Negra (Exhs. CD-32 and CD-31).\n\nCancha I and Cancha II (Exhs. CD-36 and CD-37).\n\nExhs. R-244 to R-254.\n\n20.\n\nOn 9 December 2003, President Mesa issued Law 2,564, which abrogated the *Ley Valda* and Decree 26,574 (by which the perimeter established in the *Ley Valda* was determined) and redefined the perimeter of the fiscal reserve of the Salar de Uyuni.23\n\nExh. CD-39.\n\n21.\n\nIn addition, Article 3 of Law 2,564 enabled the Executive power to annul the mining concessions granted under the *Ley Valda*, as follows:\n\nThe Executive Power is authorized, after the evaluation of audits, technical, legal, economic and financial, tax, social and labor legislation and environmental and ecological preservation, to declare null the concessionaires' mining rights that are liable to sanctions provided by the Laws and regulations in force, within a deadline of 60 days calculated from the enactment of this Law, with the consequent recovery of such concessions and non-metallic resources originally belonging to the State.24\n\nExh. CD-39, Tribunal's translation. The original Spanish text reads as follows:  \n Facultase al Poder Ejecutivo, luego de la evaluaci\u00f3n de auditor\u00edas, t\u00e9cnica, jur\u00eddico legal, econ\u00f3mico financiera, regalitario - tributaria, legislaci\u00f3n sociolaboral y preservaci\u00f3n ecol\u00f3gica y medioambiental, a declarar la nulidad de los derechos concesionarios mineros que, sean pasibles a sanciones establecidas por las Leyes y disposiciones vigentes, en un plazo perentorio de 60 d\u00edas a computar a partir de la promulgaci\u00f3n de la presente Ley, con la consiguiente recuperaci\u00f3n de tales concesiones y recursos no met\u00e1licos a propiedad originaria del Estado.\n\n22.\n\nThe Parties dispute the political context in which these events unfolded. According to the Claimants, \"Law 2,564 was adopted in the midst of intense social and political events that shook Bolivia during the years 2003 and 2004. The political instability in the country had been triggered by the Government's public energy policies and, in particular, the possibility to export Bolivian gas through Chilean pipelines.\"25 The Claimants assert that the discussions regarding the construction of a pipeline to transport Bolivian gas over Chilean territory to a Chilean port was a highly controversial topic: \"the possibility that Chile might benefit from the Bolivian gas reserves gave rise to heated protests\" under the slogan \" *gas por mar*,\" which referred to the historical controversy between the two countries since Bolivia's landlocked situation following the Pacific War (*Guerra del Pac\u00edfico*) in the late nineteenth century.26 As a consequence of the strong protests, on 18 October 2003, Bolivian President S\u00e1nchez de Losada was forced to resign and leave the country. Vice-President Carlos Mesa stepped into power and submitted the construction of the pipeline to a popular vote in July 2004.27\n\nReply, \u00b6 123.\n\nReply, \u00b6 124.\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 124-125.\n\n23.\n\nThe Respondent contests the Claimants' version of the facts, alleging that it is fraught with chronological errors. According to Bolivia, both the protests deriving from the \" *gas por mar* \" movement and the referendum took place in July 2004, long after the abolition of the *Ley Valda*, which had given rise to protests since the end of the 90s.28\n\nCounter-Mem., \u00b6 47, footnote 46.\n\n24.\n\nFollowing the promulgation of Law 2,564, Decree 27,326 specified the modalities of the audits mentioned in that law and ordered the corresponding national ministries and Potos\u00ed department to execute the audits.29\n\nExh. CD-40.\n\n25.\n\nFrom February 2004 onwards, several audits of various mining concessions in the Salar de Uyuni took place, including the following:\n\na. In February 2004, SERGEOMIN and the *Corporaci\u00f3n Minera de Bolivia* (\"COMIBOL\") submitted their technical audit on a number of the concessions in the R\u00edo Grande delta, owned by companies Copla and NMM and mining cooperative Socomin. Their conclusions included the following:\n\nThey do not have a Geological mining study and therefore [neither a] quantification of reserves that allows to plan an exploitation method in large volumes.\n\nThere is no rational and systematic administration from a technical, economic and social standpoint by the operating companies.\n\nThe exploitation method applied continues to be manual with a slight tendency towards semi-mechanization.\n\nThe mining companies and cooperatives that are in the process of exploiting ulexite such as: Copla S.A., Non Metallic Minerals S.A. and the Mining Cooperative \"Socomin\" must work in a rational and systematic fashion in all their exploitation activities.30\n\nb. In March 2004, the Environmental Directorate of the Ministry of Sustainable Development finalized its environmental audit after an on site inspection of companies NMM, Copla, Tecno Qu\u00edmica and Socomin. While the document submitted by the Respondent seems to be incomplete, the conclusions are available and read as follows:\n\nThe referred companies at the time of the inspection are operating in the R\u00edo Grande Cant\u00f3n Nor Lipez Province of the Department of Potos\u00ed without the approved environmental documentation as stipulated by Environmental Law No. 1333 and its Regulations.\n\nThe operations of [NMM and other companies] at the time of inspection are operating, regardless of the Prefectural Resolution of the Department of Potos\u00ed that determines the suspension of operations.31\n\nc. In April 2004, the Prefecture of the Department of Potos\u00ed completed its legal audit on the concessions granted under the *Ley Valda*. Again, the document submitted by the Respondent appears incomplete, but the last pages provide the following:\n\nIn the case before us, Moscoso Ruiz or the Mining Company Rio Grande Sur S.A. have not complied with the mining obligation to pay the licenses, within the time limit of art. 133 and the extension of art. 134 of the Mining Code, losing its \"mining priority,\" in other words, due to the imperative mandate of the cited articles, the applicant had a time limit to cancel the mining patents and consolidate its concession within 45 days from 15 November 1999 and ending on 30 December of the same year, without having complied with its mining obligation to pay the corresponding patents thereby causing the loss of its priority and the rejection of the application [...].\n\nRECOMMENDATION.- Request the same Superintendent to issue a specific resolution declaring the expiration due to the non-payment of the patents, with the consequent loss of priority and the resulting reversion to the original property of the State or alternatively request that the file is referred to the Potos\u00ed Mining Superintendent due to loss of competence.\n\n[...] [T]he proceedings should be terminated, with the cancellation of the filing fees and the loss of priority of the following mining requests: [among others, 7 of NMM's concessions: Do\u00f1a Juanita, La Negra, Don David, Cancha I, Cancha II, Tete and Pococho].\n\n[...]\n\nDECIDES:\n\nFIRST.- The proceedings are terminated, with the cancellation of the filing fees and the loss of the priority of the mining request. For breach of Art. 134 of law 1777 in accordance with Administrative Resolution N\u00b0 18/03 [...].\n\nSECOND.- To ensure that the mining regulations are no longer tampered with, nullifying the mining administrative process, the Tupiza and Tarija Regional Mining Superintendent, having lost its competence, is to send the proceedings to the superintendent of the closest jurisdiction, in accordance with Art. 118 of the Mining Code.32\n\nExh.

R-240, Tribunal's translation.\n\n26.\n\nOn 9 June 2004, the Ministry of Sustainable Development granted NMM's environmental license for the concession \"Borateras de Cuevitas.\"33 The granting of this environmental license triggered strong protests from civic organizations (in particular, the *Comit\u00e9 C\u00edvico Potosinista*, \"Comcipo\") in Potos\u00ed and La Paz, as reflected by several press articles.34 This \"war to death\"35 included hunger strikes and the blockade of roads and railways between Uyuni and the city of Oruro. As a consequence of this popular reaction, the same Ministry first suspended all activities in \"Borateras de Cuevitas\" on 17 June 200436 and subsequently revoked NMM's license on 22 June.37\n\nExh.

The letter which accompanied the handover stated:\n\n[\u2026] [W]e hereby formally make physical handover of our concessions [\u2026] notwithstanding their physical handover [\u2026] [several thousand tons of different types of ulexite] that have been previously extracted and are the property of [NMM] are collected in those concessions, which we will remove shortly together with other goods of our property that are found there.42\n\nExh, CD-59, Tribunal's translation.

The 2004 Inter-Ministerial Memo is an internal document which was included in the criminal file prepared by the *Superintendencia de Empresas* in December 2008.\n\nThe scenarios envisaged by the memorandum and its main conclusions are the following:\n\nFIRST SCENARIO - The Bolivian Government may try to reach an amicable and mutually satisfactory agreement with the company. However it is clear that the only settlement possible with the company would be an indemnity or recovery of its concessions. For the Government, said option would involve a significant political cost and the generation of new social and regional conflicts in the Potos\u00ed Department.\n\nSECOND SCENARIO - The Bolivian Government may attempt to defend its decisions. Unfortunately, the Mining Code makes no provisions for the revocation of mining concessions. Therefore, this option has a great weakness. Another alternative would be to try to prove irregularities in the processing of the original mining concessions of Non Metallic Minerals S.A., so as to demonstrate that these are and always have been invalid. For the time being, this has been considered the best alternative.\n\n[...]\n\n[CONCLUSIONS]\n\n1. By means of Supreme Decree N\u00b0 27,589, of 23 June 2004, the revocation of the mining concessions granted in favor of the company Non Metallic Minerals S.A. was ordered. This Supreme Decree was enacted due to the social and political pressure exercised by the authorities of Potos\u00ed and, in particular, of the locality of Uyuni. [ *This Supreme Decree* ] suffers from serious legal problems.\n\n[\u2026]\n\n[NMM] has submitted documentation that supports that [Quiborax], incorporated under Chilean laws, has a direct participation higher than 50% of [NMM's capital] and therefore, in accordance with [the Bolivia-Chile BIT], has effective control of [NMM].\n\n[\u2026]\n\n10. The Bolivian Government may try to reach an amicable and mutually satisfactory agreement with the company. However, this option would imply significant political costs and the creation of new conflicts in the Department of Potos\u00ed. On the other hand, the Bolivian Government may try to defend its decision to revoke the mining concessions or try to prove defects in the granting of the original concessions of [NMM].46\n\nExh. CD-68, Tribunal's translation.\n\n34.\n\nOn 16 December 2005, Decree 27,589, (the Revocation Decree), was abrogated by Decree No. 28,527, which reads as follows:\n\n[The Revocation Decree] suffers from irreparable legal defects because the Mining Code does not provide in any of its legal provisions the revocation of mining concessions, but provides rather for the legal figures of *caducidad* or annulment of mining concessions after an administrative proceeding under the competence and jurisdiction of the Superintendence of Mines.47\n\nExh. CD-74, Tribunal's translation.\n\n35.\n\nIn December 2008, Bolivia initiated criminal proceedings against Messrs. Allan Fosk, David Moscoso and others on the ground that these individuals allegedly fabricated evidence for the purpose of allowing the Claimants to establish jurisdiction in this arbitration.48\n\nExh. CD-82. Criminal proceedings were brought against Messrs.Daniel Gottschalk, David Moscoso, Allan Fosk, Fernando Rojas, Gilka Salas, Dolly Paredes, M\u00f3nica Fern\u00e1ndez, Yuri Espinoza, Ernesto Ossio and Tatiana Ter\u00e1n.\n\n**III. PROCEDURAL HISTORY**\n---------------------------\n\n**A. Initial phase**\n--------------------\n\n36.\n\nOn 4 October 2005, the Claimants filed a Notice of Arbitration with the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (\"ICSID\") pursuant to Article 36 of the ICSID Convention and to the Bolivia-Chile BIT.\n\n37.\n\nDespite the commencement of the arbitration, the Parties continued to hold settlement negotiations, without however reaching an agreement. Thus, it is only on 21 November 2006 that the Claimants appointed as arbitrator the Hon. Marc Lalonde, a Canadian national. On 6 April 2007, the Respondent appointed as arbitrator Professor Brigitte Stern, a French national. On 18 December 2007, the Chairman of the ICSID Administrative Council appointed Professor Gabrielle Kaufmann-Kohler, a Swiss national, as President of the Tribunal, in accordance with Article 38 of the ICSID Convention. All three arbitrators accepted their appointments. Further, the Centre designated Ms. Natal\u00ed Sequeira as Secretary of the Tribunal. Consequently, the Arbitral Tribunal was constituted and the proceedings commenced in late December 2007.\n\n38.\n\nOn 20 March 2008, the Tribunal and the Parties held a first procedural session in Paris. At the beginning of the first session, the Parties informed the Tribunal that they had orally reached a preliminary settlement and that they expected to put it in writing within the next fifteen days. Nevertheless, the Parties and the Tribunal decided to conduct the first session as scheduled in case a final agreement were ultimately not reached. Thus, the Parties and the Tribunal discussed and agreed on a number of procedural issues. Thereafter, the arbitration proceedings were suspended pending the conclusion of a settlement agreement between the Parties.\n\n39.\n\nThe Parties requested multiple time extensions to finalize the settlement agreement. Eventually, on 13 January 2009, the Claimants requested that the arbitration be resumed on the alleged ground that the Respondent's conduct was \"inconsistent\" with settlement negotiations. As a result, on 17 February 2009, the Tribunal issued the final minutes of the first session, attaching a draft timetable upon which the Parties would be able to comment. On 5 March 2009, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 1, including a final timetable of the proceedings. This timetable was amended on various occasions upon the request of both Parties.\n\n**B. Jurisdictional phase**\n---------------------------\n\n40.\n\nOn 14 September 2009, the Claimants filed their Memorial, together with expert reports of Behre Dolbear & Company (USA), Inc. and Navigant Consulting, Inc., as well as witness statements from Messrs. Allan Fosk, Carlos Shuffer, Ricardo Ramos and Osvaldo Astudillo. On the same date, the Claimants also submitted a request for provisional measures, asking that the Respondent refrain from engaging in any conduct that could aggravate the dispute and requesting that the Bolivian criminal proceedings against Messrs. Allan Fosk, David Moscoso and others be discontinued. On 2 October 2009, the Claimants requested a \"temporary restraining order\" with immediate effect, asking that the Respondent discontinue the Bolivian criminal proceedings pending the Tribunal's decision on the request for provisional measures. The Respondent opposed this request on 5 October 2009. The Tribunal denied the Claimants' request for a \"temporary restraining order\" in a letter of the same date.\n\n41.\n\nOn 13 and 29 October 2009, Bolivia filed briefs opposing the Claimants' request for provisional measures. On 21 October 2009, the Claimants submitted a second brief in support of their request for provisional measures. Following a conference call held on 24 November 2009, the Tribunal issued its Decision on Provisional Measures on 26 February 2010, according to which the Respondent was to take all appropriate measures to suspend the Bolivian criminal proceedings against Messrs. Allan Fosk, David Moscoso and others, and refrain from initiating new criminal proceedings which could jeopardize the procedural integrity of this arbitration.\n\n42.\n\nOn 7 April 2010, Bolivia filed a proposal to disqualify the Tribunal, which suspended the proceedings. On 19 April 2010, the Claimants submitted observations opposing the Respondent's proposal. Each Party then presented an additional brief in support of its position. On 6 July 2010, the Chairman of the Administrative Council of the World Bank, conveying his decision through the Secretary-General of ICSID, dismissed the proposal for disqualification. The arbitration resumed shortly thereafter and the procedural calendar was amended accordingly.\n\n43.\n\nOn 12 July 2010, Bolivia informed that it would file objections to the jurisdiction of the Tribunal by no later than 30 July 2010. At the same time, the Respondent requested an order from the Tribunal directing the Claimants to produce the documents identified in the Redfern schedule dated 28 May 2010. On 19 July 2010, the Claimants presented objections to the Respondent's requests for document production. On 26 July 2010, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 2, partially granting the Respondent's requests for document production, as specified in the Redfern schedule attached to the order.\n\n44.\n\nThe Respondent filed Objections to the Jurisdiction of the Tribunal on 30 July 2010, together with the expert report of Mr. Iv\u00e1n Salame. The Claimants submitted their Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction on 29 October 2010, together with the expert report of Mr. Carlos Rosenkratz and the report of Mr. Juan Pablo de Luca. The Respondent submitted its Reply on Jurisdiction, together with the second expert report of Mr. Iv\u00e1n Salame, on 13 January 2011.\n\n45.\n\nOn 8 February 2011, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 3, granting the Respondent's request for document inspection, contained in the Reply on Jurisdiction and a letter of 4 February 2011. The Tribunal ordered the Claimants to make the original share certificates Nos. 1 to 11 of NMM available for inspection and provided directions on the inspection in Procedural Order No. 4, dated 10 March 2011. In accordance with the timetable set in Procedural Order No. 4, the Respondent submitted its expert report on the document inspection on 8 April 2011 and the Claimants did the same on 22 April 2011.\n\n46.\n\nThe Claimants filed their Rejoinder on Jurisdiction on 1 April 2011, together with the second expert report of Mr. Carlos Rosenkratz and the second report of Juan Pablo de Luca.\n\n47.\n\nFollowing the pre-hearing telephone conference held between the Tribunal and the Parties on 12 April 2011, the Tribunal issued Procedural Orders Nos. 5, 6 and 7 with directions for the hearing.\n\n48.\n\nOn 12 and 13 May 2011, the Tribunal held a hearing on jurisdiction in Paris. In attendance at the hearing were the members of the Arbitral Tribunal, the Secretary and the Assistant, Mr. Gustavo Laborde, and the following party representatives, witnesses and experts:\n\n**On behalf of the Claimants**\n\nAndr\u00e9s Jana, Bofill Mir & Alvarez Jana\n\nJorge Bofill, Bofill Mir & Alvarez Jana\n\nJohanna Klein Kranenberg, Bofill Mir & Alvarez Jana\n\nRodrigo Gil, Bofill Mir & Alvarez Jana\n\nXimena Fuentes, Bofill Mir & Alvarez Jana\n\nConstanza Onetto, Bofill Mir & Alvarez Jana\n\nClaimants' witness\n\nAllan Fosk\n\nClaimants' experts\n\nAlbert Lyter III\n\nCarlos Rosencrantz\n\n**On behalf of the Respondent**\n\nHugo Montero Lara, Attorney General of the State Elizabeth Arismendi Chumacero, Deputy Attorney General\n\nDanny Javier L\u00f3pez Soliz, General Director of the Jurisdictional and Arbitral Defense of Investments (Attorney General's Office)\n\nPierre Mayer, Dechert (Paris) LLP\n\nEduardo Silva Romero, Dechert (Paris) LLP\n\nJos\u00e9 Manuel Garc\u00eda Represa, Dechert (Paris) LLP\n\nAna Carolina Sim\u00f6es e Silva, Dechert (Paris) LLP\n\nFrancisco Paredes-Balladares, Dechert (Paris) LLP\n\nAnna Vald\u00e9s Pascal, Dechert (Paris) LLP Pac\u00f4me Ziegler, Dechert (Paris) LLP\n\nRespondent's expert\n\nIv\u00e1n Salame\n\n49.\n\nMr. Andr\u00e9s Jana and Ms. Johanna Klein Kranenberg presented oral arguments on behalf of the Claimants; Messrs. Hugo Montero Lara, Pierre Mayer, Eduardo Silva Romero and Jos\u00e9 Manuel Garc\u00eda Represa, in turn, presented oral arguments on behalf of the Respondent.\n\n50.\n\nAfter the hearing, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 8 confirming, as discussed at the end of the hearing, that there would be no post-hearing briefs and setting a calendar for the filing of submissions regarding the Claimants' request that the Tribunal issue a declaration pursuant to Article 37 of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility. The Claimants filed these submissions on 27 May 2011 and the Respondent filed its reply on 10 June 2011.\n\n51.\n\nThe Tribunal issued its Decision on Jurisdiction on 27 September 2012, which forms an integral part of this Award. In its dispositive, the Tribunal declared and decided as follows:\n\nA. On jurisdiction:\n\n1. Declares that it has jurisdiction over the claims of Quiborax and NMM;\n\n2. Declares that it has no jurisdiction over Allan Fosk's claims;\n\nB. On admissibility:\n\n1. Declares that the witness statement of Ricardo Ramos is admissible;\n\n2. Declares that Bolivia's objections to jurisdiction and the evidence arising from the Bolivian criminal proceedings are admissible;\n\n3. Declares that the claims of Quiborax and NMM are admissible;\n\n4. On further procedural steps:\n\n1. Will take the necessary steps for the continuation of the proceedings toward the merits phase by way of a procedural order to be issued after consultation with the Parties;\n\n2. Defers consideration of the Claimants' request for a declaratory judgment pursuant to Article 37 of the Articles on State Responsibility for subsequent adjudication;\n\n3. Reserves the decision on costs for subsequent decision.\n\n52.\n\nOf note, in its Decision on Jurisdiction, the Tribunal found that the Respondent's claim that the Claimants or their employees or advisors had fabricated evidence in order to establish jurisdiction in this arbitration was unfounded:\n\nOn the basis of the review of the entire record, the Tribunal finds that the Claimants' account of facts is consistent and well-documented. Whilst there are some documentary discrepancies [\u2026] these do not prove fraud nor suffice to overcome the plentiful evidence in support of the Claimants' case. For these reasons, the Tribunal is persuaded that [\u2026] [Quiborax] did not engage in fraud or fabricate evidence to gain access to ICSID arbitration.49\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 192.\n\n**C. Merits phase**\n-------------------\n\n53.\n\nOn 9 November 2012, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 9 regarding the merits phase and setting the corresponding calendar for written memorials. The calendar was amended by letter of the Tribunal dated 21 March 2013 and again in a letter of 5 April 2013, following the Parties' correspondence.\n\n54.\n\nAccordingly, the Respondent filed its Counter-Memorial on 10 May 2013, together with the expert report of Econ One Research Inc.\n\n55.\n\nThe Claimants submitted their Reply on 13 August 2013, together with the second expert reports of Behre Dolbear Company (USA), Inc. and Navigant Consulting, Inc.\n\n56.\n\nOn 4 October 2013, the Parties submitted a list of the witnesses and experts they wished to examine at the hearing.\n\n57.\n\nOn 7 October 2013, the Parties and the Tribunal held a telephone conference to discuss the preparation of the hearing. Subsequently, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 10, reflecting the agreements reached by the Parties with respect to the conduct of the hearing and the Tribunal's decision regarding those issues on which the Parties did not reach an agreement.\n\n58.\n\nFollowing the Tribunal's letter of 18 September 2013 granting the Respondent an extension of the time limit to submit its Rejoinder, the Respondent filed its Rejoinder on 11 October 2013, together with the second expert report of Econ One Research Inc.\n\n59.\n\nOn 28, 29 and 30 October 2013, the Tribunal held a hearing on the merits in Paris. In attendance at the hearing were the members of the Arbitral Tribunal, the Secretary and the Assistant, Ms. Leonor D\u00edaz-C\u00f3rdova,50 and the following party representatives, witnesses and experts:\n\n**On behalf of the Claimants**\n\nAndr\u00e9s Jana, Bofill Mir & Alvarez Jana\n\nJohanna Klein Kranenberg, Bofill Mir & Alvarez Jana\n\nRodrigo Gil, Bofill Mir & Alvarez Jana\n\nDaniela Arrese, Bofill Mir & Alvarez Jana\n\nMar\u00eda Victoria Demarchi, Bofill Mir & Alvarez Jana\n\nDiego P\u00e9rez, Bofill Mir & Alvarez Jana\n\nClaudio Inostroza, Bofill Mir & Alvarez Jana\n\nJorge Luis Inchauste, Bofill Mir & Alvarez Jana\n\nClaimants' witnesses\n\nAllan Fosk\n\nCarlos Shuffer\n\nRicardo Ramos\n\nClaimants' experts\n\nBernard Guarnera, Behre Dolbear & Company (USA), Inc.\n\nBrent Kaczmarek, Navigant Consulting, Inc.\n\n**On behalf of the Respondent**\n\nHugo Montero Lara, Attorney General of the State\n\nElizabeth Arismendi Chumacero, Deputy Attorney General\n\nEdgar Luis Pozo Goytia, General Director of the Jurisdictional and Arbitral Defense of Investments\n\nLeonardo Alejandro Anaya Leigue (Attorney General's Office)\n\nDiego Brian Gosis, Gomm & Smith, P.A.\n\nQuinn Smith, Gomm & Smith, P.A.\n\nClovis Trevi\u00f1o, Gomm & Smith, P.A.\n\nBernardo Wayar Caballero, Wayar & von Borries Abogados, S.C.\n\nBernardo Wayar Ocampo, Wayar & von Borries Abogados, S.C.\n\nFlavio Javier Loza Vargas, Wayar & von Borries Abogados, S.C.\n\nAgustina Alvarez Olaizola, consultora de Gomm & Smith P.A.\n\nAlfredo de Jes\u00fas O., consultor de Gomm & Smith P.A.\n\nRespondent's experts\n\nDaniel Flores, Econ One Research\n\nAndrea Cardani, Econ One Research\n\nIvan Lopez, Econ One Research\n\nMs. Leonor D\u00edaz-Cordova replaced Mr. Gustavo Laborde as assistant to the Tribunal with the consent on the Parties prior to the hearing on the merits.\n\n60.\n\nMr. Andr\u00e9s Jana and Ms. Johanna Klein Kranenberg presented oral arguments on behalf of the Claimants; Mr. Hugo Montero Lara, Ms. Elisabeth Arismendi Chumacero and Mr. Diego Brian Gosis, in turn, presented oral arguments on behalf of the Respondent.\n\n61.\n\nAt the end of the hearing, the Tribunal and the Parties agreed that there would be no post-hearing briefs.\n\n62.\n\nOn 5 November 2013, in accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 28(2), the Tribunal invited the Parties to file statements of costs by 10 January 2014 and their comments on the other Party's statement by 24 January 2014. Following an extension requested by the Respondent and granted by the Tribunal, the statements of costs were circulated to the Tribunal on 3 February 2014. The Respondent's comments on the Claimants' statement of costs were submitted on 10 February 2014. The Claimants' comments on Bolivia's statement of cost were submitted on 13 February 2014.\n\n63.\n\nOn 21 March 2014, the Respondent submitted a letter to ICSID informing that Mr. H\u00e9ctor Arce and Mr. Pablo Menacho had been appointed Attorney General and Deputy Defense Attorney of Bolivia, respectively.\n\n64.\n\nOn 23 May 2014, the Claimants wrote to the Tribunal to inform of recent developments in the criminal proceedings against Allan Fosk, David Moscoso and others in Bolivia. In particular, they informed of invitations sent by Bolivia to Mr. Allan Fosk and to Claimants' counsel for a \"coordination meeting\" scheduled for 22 May 2014 at the Bolivian Consulate in Chile, which they described as \"an ambush to have Mr. Allan Fosk and his legal counsel attend at a formal taking of evidence in the criminal case.\"51\n\nClaimants' letter of 23 May 2014, p. 3.\n\n65.\n\nFollowing the Tribunal's invitation, on 2 June 2014, the Respondent replied to the Claimants' letter, stating that its actions had complied with diplomatic standards, international regulations and local legal proceedings.52\n\nRespondent's letter of 2 June 2014.\n\n66.\n\nOn 29 May 2015, the Claimants informed the Tribunal that Mr. Allan Fosk had been indicted on 11 November 2014, and that the Bolivian prosecutor had requested that he be declared in default and that an Interpol Red Notice be issued against him. The Claimants also noted that the prosecutor had summoned Mr. Moscoso and Claimants' counsel in Bolivia to testify as witnesses in the criminal case, and informed of measures taken against a Bolivian notary public in the context of the criminal proceedings.53\n\nClaimants' letter of 29 May 2015.\n\n67.\n\nOn 12 June 2015, the Respondent replied emphasizing Bolivian law prevented it from suspending the criminal proceedings, and asserted that all procedural actions taken in the context of these criminal proceedings complied with Bolivian law. The Respondent also noted that, although Mr. Fosk could make use of procedural guarantees in Bolivia to defend himself, he had chosen not to exercise them. The Respondent added that, in any event, Mr. Fosk was no longer a party to these proceedings.54\n\nRespondent's letter of 12 June 2015.\n\n68.\n\nOn 17 August 2015, ICSID declared the proceedings closed.\n\n**IV. OVERVIEW OF THE PARTIES' POSITIONS**\n------------------------------------------\n\n69.\n\nThe purpose of this Section is to provide an overview of the Parties' positions. The Parties' detailed positions with respect to each claim are described in Sections VI and VII below.\n\n**A. Overview of the Claimants' Position**\n------------------------------------------\n\n70.\n\nThe Claimants argue that Bolivia has violated its obligations under the BIT by the revocation and *ex post* annulment of the Claimants' mining concessions. They claim that the Revocation Decree unlawfully deprived them of their investment in Bolivia and characterize the revocation of their concessions as \"unlawful, unreasonable, arbitrary and discriminatory.\"55 The Claimants further contend that everything that occurred after the revocation of their concessions (in particular, the initiation of the criminal case in Bolivia) is part of Bolivia's defense strategy in this arbitration. According to the Claimants, the Respondent has tried to avoid a discussion on the merits of its own actions by launching unsubstantiated accusations against the Claimants and attempting to place the burden of proof upon the Claimants to establish that they did not indulge in fraud, corruption or trivial errors. However, when required to justify its own actions, the Respondent stands empty-handed. It has tried to find support in the auditing reports that allegedly prove the irregularity of the Claimants' investment. The Claimants argue they do not. Moreover, the Claimants contend that \"the Respondent's defense on the merits is limited to its re-litigation of jurisdiction.\"56\n\nReply, \u00b6 552.\n\nReply, \u00b6 17.\n\n71.\n\nThe Claimants contend that Bolivia has breached Articles III, IV and VI of the Bolivia-Chile BIT as well as certain obligations under the ICSID Convention and international law. They claim, in particular, that:\n\na. The revocation of the Claimants' mining concessions constitutes an unlawful expropriation under Article VI of the BIT.\n\nb. The revocation and *ex post* annulment of the Claimants' mining concessions and Bolivia's post-expropriation acts of harassment constitute unreasonable, arbitrary and discriminatory measures that breach the fair and equitable standard of Article IV of the BIT, as well as the prohibition to impair the free administration, maintenance, use, enjoyment, extension, transfer, sale and liquidation of their investments with unreasonable or discriminatory measures, contained in Article III of the BIT.\n\nc. By refusing to suspend the criminal case, as directed in the Decision on Provisional Measures, and through its conduct in this arbitration, Bolivia has breached its treaty obligation to accord fair and equitable treatment to the Claimants' investments, as well as its procedural obligations under the ICSID Convention and under general principles of international law.\n\n72.\n\nThe Claimants' specific arguments with respect to the alleged treaty breaches are discussed in Sections VI (Claims for Violation of the BIT) and VII (Reparation) below.\n\n73.\n\nIn terms of reparation, the Claimants request \"material and non-material\" damages,57 as well as a declaratory judgment, as explained in Section VII below. The Tribunal understands that, for each breach of the BIT or of international law that they allege, the Claimants request the following relief:\n\na. For the loss of their investments in Bolivia, whether such loss was caused by Bolivia's unlawful expropriation of those investments, by Bolivia's unfair and inequitable treatment or by its impairment of their investments through unreasonable or discriminatory measures, the Claimants request compensatory damages in an amount of US$ 146,848,827 as of 30 June 2013, plus compound interest from that date. This claim for compensatory damages covers all of their financially assessable damage arising from the loss of their investments in Bolivia, regardless of the treaty breach that caused them.\n\nb. For the consequences of Bolivia's post-expropriation acts of harassment, which the Claimants submit qualify as unfair and inequitable treatment by Bolivia, as well as an impairment of their investments by unreasonable and discriminatory measures,58 the Claimants request moral damages in an amount of US$ 4 million. The Claimants also request a declaratory judgment in respect of these breaches.\n\nc. For Bolivia's failure to comply with the Decision on Provisional Measures and its conduct in this arbitration, which the Claimants argue is in breach of Bolivia's obligation of fair and equitable treatment under the BIT, as well as its procedural obligations under the ICSID Convention and under general principles of international law, the Claimants request a declaratory judgment.\n\nReply, \u00b6 555.\n\nAlthough in their Reply the Claimants link this request to Bolivia's expropriation of their concessions (Reply, Section IX(6), that link is not made in their arguments.\n\n74.\n\nThe Claimants also request the Tribunal to order Bolivia to pay all costs, fees and expenses incurred by the Claimants during the arbitration, given the manner in which the Respondent has conducted itself during the proceedings.\n\n75.\n\nOn the basis of the foregoing, in their Memorial the Claimants requested the following relief:\n\n[\u2026] Claimants request the Tribunal to render an award in favor of Claimants:\n\n(1) Declaring that Bolivia violated its obligations under Article VI of the BIT by expropriating Claimants' investment in Bolivia, in an unlawful manner and not in accordance with the requirements of Article VI;\n\n(2) Declaring that Bolivia violated its obligations under Article IV of the BIT by failing to accord Claimants fair and equitable treatment, by unlawfully expropriating Claimants' investment in Bolivia;\n\n(3) Declaring that Bolivia violated its obligations under Article III of the BIT by failing to protect Claimants' investment in Bolivia and obstructing its free administration, maintenance, use, enjoyment, extension, transfer, sale and liquidation, by unreasonable and discriminatory measures consisting of the unlawful expropriation of Claimants' investment in Bolivia;\n\n(4) Declaring that Bolivia violated its obligations under international law by aggravating the dispute between the parties, by submitting Claimants to acts of harassment intended to obstruct Claimants' rights under the BIT;\n\n(5) Declaring that Bolivia violated its obligations under Article IV of the BIT by failing to accord Claimants fair and equitable treatment, by submitting Claimants to acts of harassment intended to obstruct Claimants' rights under the BIT;\n\n(6) Declaring that Bolivia violated its obligations under Article III of the BIT by submitting Claimants to unreasonable and discriminatory measures, consisting of acts of harassment intended to obstruct Claimants' rights under the BIT;\n\n(7) Declaring that Bolivia violated its obligations under Art. 26 of the ICSID Convention by initiating parallel criminal proceedings in Bolivia;\n\n(8) Ordering Bolivia to pay Claimants full compensation in an amount not less than US$ 61,481,461 as of 1 August 2009 for damages suffered due to the loss of their investment in Bolivia, plus compound interest at the commercial rate on such amount from such date until the date of actual payment;\n\n(9) Ordering Bolivia to pay compensation in an amount not less than US$ 5,000,000 for moral damages suffered by Claimants due to the unlawful acts of harassment by Bolivia, subsequent to the loss of Claimants' investment in Bolivia;\n\n(10) Ordering Bolivia to pay all costs, fees and expenses incurred by Claimants as a result of Bolivia's violations of the BIT, including all cost, fees and expenses of these arbitration proceedings.59\n\nMem., pp. 98-99.\n\n76.\n\nIn their Reply, the Claimants updated their relief (and in particular their claim for monetary damages) as follows:\n\n[...] [T]he Claimants request the Tribunal to render an award in favor of the Claimants:\n\n(1) Declaring that Bolivia violated its obligations under Article VI of the BIT by expropriating Claimants' investment in Bolivia, in an unlawful manner and not in accordance with the requirements of Article VI;\n\n(2) Declaring that Bolivia violated its obligations under Article IV of the BIT by failing to accord Claimants' investment fair and equitable treatment by unlawfully expropriating Claimants' investment in Bolivia and by measures subsequent to the expropriation of the Claimants' investment;\n\n(3) Declaring that Bolivia violated its obligations under Article III of the BIT by failing to protect Claimants' investment in Bolivia and by impairing its free administration, maintenance, use, enjoyment, extension, transfer, sale and liquidation, by unreasonable and discriminatory measures consisting of the unlawful expropriation of Claimants' investment in Bolivia and by measures subsequent to the expropriation of the Claimants' investment;\n\n(4) Ordering Bolivia to pay the Claimants full compensation to an amount of US$ 146,848,827 as of 30 June 2013 for damages suffered due to the loss of their investment in Bolivia, plus compound interest at the commercial rate on that amount from such date until the date of actual payment;\n\n(6) Ordering Bolivia to pay compensation to an amount of US$ 4,000,000 for moral damages for Quiborax due to the unlawful expropriation and acts of harassment by Bolivia, subsequent to the loss of Claimants' investment in Bolivia;\n\n(7) Declaring that the Respondent's conduct in the present arbitration is in breach of its international obligations under the ICSID Convention and its duty to arbitrate fairly and in good faith;\n\n(8) Ordering Bolivia to pay all costs, fees and expenses incurred by the Claimants as a result of Bolivia's violations of the BIT, including all costs, fees and expenses of these arbitration proceedings.\n\n(9) Granting the Claimants any other relief the Tribunal considers adequate.60\n\nReply, p. 170. The Tribunal notes that there is no request No. 5 in the Claimant's request for relief.\n\n**B. Overview of the Respondent's Position**\n--------------------------------------------\n\n77.\n\nBolivia rejects each of the Claimants' claims and contends that it has not violated its obligations under the BIT and international law.\n\n78.\n\nAccording to Bolivia, \"the mining concessions are the result of an abuse perpetrated by Mr. \u00c1lvaro Ugalde and Mr. David Moscoso who, having had access because of their public functions to a geological study carried out in 1993 that showed a wealth of minerals in a small area of the fiscal reserve, acquired concessions there and in all the surrounding areas.\"61\n\nCounter-Mem., \u00b6 7, Tribunal's translation.\n\n79.\n\nSubsequently, Messrs. Ugalde and Moscoso offered these concessions to the highest bidder. Quiborax paid US$ 400,000 in 2001 for over 50% of the mining concessions through NMM, of which Mr. Moscoso holds part of the remaining capital. From then on, the Claimants have not invested any additional capital.\n\n80.\n\nThe audits carried out by Bolivian authorities in 2004 of all mining concessions in the Gran Salar de Uyuni detected serious irregularities in the Claimants' concessions. This led to their revocation and annulment.\n\n81.\n\nFor the Respondent, since the Claimants have obtained their investment in violation of Bolivian law, they are not entitled to the protection of the BIT and international law. However, even if these protections were available, Bolivia submits that it has not breached any of its international obligations by revoking and annulling the mining concessions. In particular:\n\na. The Respondent denies having expropriated the Claimants' investments. If the Tribunal were to find that there has been such an expropriation, it contends that that this expropriation has been lawful.\n\nb. The Respondent denies having breached the fair and equitable treatment standard of the BIT.\n\n82.\n\nThe Respondent advances further arguments with respect to each of the Claimants' claims, which will be addressed in the specific analysis in Section VI.\n\n83.\n\nAs discussed in Section VII below, the Respondent also challenges the Claimants' case on quantum. Bolivia stresses that this claim bears no connection with reality. Following the Claimants' contention, an alleged investment of US$ 400,000 in 2001 would have produced a value of US$ 60 million only three years later, and over US$ 140,000,000 in 2013. The additional claim for moral damages is punitive and inadmissible under international law. In any event, the damage claimed is nonexistent.\n\n84.\n\nIn conclusion, the Tribunal should confirm that the Claimants \"abuse these proceedings to denigrate the State and attempt to unjustly enrich themselves.\"62 The Tribunal should thus reject all the claims and order the Claimants to repair the harm its accusations have done to the Bolivian State.\n\nCounter-Mem., \u00b6 15, Tribunal's translation.\n\n85.\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, in its Counter-Memorial the Respondent requested the following relief:\n\n[...] Bolivia respectfully requests the Tribunal to:\n\nDeclare:\n\na. That the Treaty and international law do not protect the Claimant's investment because it was not carried out in accordance with the laws and regulations of Bolivia;\n\nb. Alternatively, that Bolivia's conduct was justified and that it has complied with each and every one of its obligations under the Treaty and international law;\n\nc. In the further alternative, if the Arbitral Tribunal found that Bolivia should pay any compensation to the Claimants, order the payment of no more than the Net Investment Realized by the Claimants, i.e. US$ 622,492;\n\nd. Alternatively, if the Tribunal decides to compensate the Claimants based on the DCF method, order the payment of no more than US$ 2.1 million; and\n\nOrder:\n\na. the Claimants to entirely reimburse Bolivia for the costs it has incurred to defend its interests in the present arbitration, together with interest at a reasonable commercial rate in the Tribunal's opinion from the moment in which the State incurred in said costs until the date of actual payment; and\n\nb. any other compensation to the State that the Tribunal deems appropriate.63\n\nCounter-Mem., \u00b6 450-452, Tribunal's translation. The original Spanish text reads as follows:  \n [\u2026] Bolivia solicita respetuosamente al Tribunal Arbitral que:  \n Declare:  \n a. Que el Tratado y el derecho internacional no protegen la inversi\u00f3n de las Demandantes por no haber sido realizada de conformidad con las leyes y reglamentos de Bolivia;  \n b. Que, subsidiariamente, la conducta de Bolivia era justificada y ha cumplido todas y cada una de sus obligaciones bajo el Tratado y el derecho internacional;  \n c. Que, a t\u00edtulo subsidiario tambi\u00e9n, en caso de que el Tribunal Arbitral considere que Bolivia debe pagar alguna compensaci\u00f3n a las Demandantes, ordene el pago de, como m\u00e1ximo, la Inversi\u00f3n Neta Realizada por las Demandantes, esto es US$ 622,492;  \n d. Que, a t\u00edtulo subsidiario, si el Tribunal Arbitral decidiera compensar a las Demandantes con base en el m\u00e9todo FFD, ordene el pago de, como m\u00e1ximo, US$ 2.1 millones; y  \n Ordene:  \n a. a la Demandante reembolsarle \u00edntegramente a Bolivia los costos en los que ha incurrido en la defensa de sus intereses en el presente arbitraje, junto con intereses a una tasa comercial razonable a juicio del Tribunal Arbitral desde el momento en que el Estado incurri\u00f3 en dichas costas hasta la fecha de su pago efectivo; y  \n b. cualquier otra medida de satisfacci\u00f3n al Estado que el Tribunal Arbitral estime oportuna.\n\n86.\n\nIn its Rejoinder, the Respondent updated its prayers for relief as follows:\n\n[\u2026] [T]he Plurinational State of Bolivia formally requests the Tribunal to:\n\nReject all of the claims submitted by the Claimants under the Bolivia-Chile Bilateral Treaty, because the alleged investments are not protected under this Treaty since they were made or carried out in violation of the applicable norms, laws and regulations and, alternatively, because they lack merits and have not been proven;\n\nReject all of the claims submitted by the Claimants under customary international law because these fall outside the competence of the Tribunal and, alternatively, because they lack merit and have not been proven;\n\nReject all of the sums claimed as a consequence of the violations alleged by the Claimants, because they lack merit and have not been proven; and\n\nOrder the Claimants to reimburse all costs and expenses incurred in defending Bolivia's interests in this proceeding, and to provide compensation in the manner the Tribunal deems appropriate regarding the misconduct of the Claimants harmful to the Plurinational State of Bolivia.64\n\nRejoinder, pp. 79-80, Tribunal's translation. The original Spanish text reads as follows:  \n [\u2026] [E]l Estado Plurinacional de Bolivia formalmente solicita al Tribunal que:  \n A. Rechace la totalidad de los reclamos presentados por las Demandantes bajo el Tratado Bilateral Bolivia-Chile, por carecer las inversiones pretendidas de protecci\u00f3n bajo ese Tratado por haberse realizado o desarrollado en violaci\u00f3n de las normas, leyes y reglamentos aplicables, y, en la alternativa, por carecer de m\u00e9rito, y no haber sido probados;  \n B.

PRELIMINARY MATTERS**\n--------------------------\n\n**A. The Tribunal's task**\n--------------------------\n\n87.\n\nThe Tribunal's task is to resolve the investment dispute brought before it. Specifically, it must determine whether the Respondent breached the provisions of the Bolivia-Chile BIT in its treatment of the Claimants' investments, as alleged by the Claimants.\n\n88.\n\nDuring the hearing on the merits, Bolivia's Attorney General, Mr. Montero Lara, addressed the Tribunal and explained that in 2006 Bolivia had started \"a process of change,\" a \"veritable transformation\" that \"no longer allowed for companies from other countries to define, control and command economic structures in Bolivia [\u2026] So we now say where investment goes, and why, how our natural resources are to be used.\"65\n\nTr., Day 1, 93:2-94:12.\n\n89.\n\nThe Tribunal wishes to reassure the Government of Bolivia that by no means does it intend to interfere with the policies that Bolivia sets and implements as a sovereign State. The Tribunal agrees with the Respondent that the ICSID arbitration system \"should not be used as a sword of Damocles to hang over [host States'] heads but as a means of ensuring everybody abides by their obligations.\"66 The Tribunal is well aware that it is tasked solely with deciding whether those commitments which Bolivia in its sovereign power chose to undertake in the Bolivia-Chile BIT are respected in accordance with the rule of law.\n\nTr., Day 1, 98:17-19.\n\n**B. Law applicable to the merits**\n-----------------------------------\n\n90.\n\nThe claims before the Tribunal are brought on the basis of the Bolivia-Chile BIT, which is the primary source of law for this Tribunal. With respect to matters not covered by the BIT, the latter contains no choice of law. The Tribunal must thus resort to Article 42(1) of the ICSID Convention, which reads as follows:\n\nThe Tribunal shall decide a dispute in accordance with such rules of law as may be agreed by the parties. In the absence of such an agreement, the Tribunal shall apply the law of the Contracting State party to the dispute (including its rules on the conflict of laws) and such rules of international law as may be applicable.\n\n91.\n\nExcept for the undisputed application of the BIT, the Parties have not agreed on the rules of law that govern the merits of this dispute. Consequently, the Tribunal shall apply Bolivian law and international law when appropriate. The Tribunal is of the view that the second sentence of Article 42(1) of the ICSID Convention does not allocate matters to either law. It is thus for the Tribunal to determine whether an issue is subject to national or international law.67\n\n*See, e.g.*, *Burlington Resources Inc. v. Republic of Ecuador*, ICSID Case No. ARB/08/5 (\" *Burlington v. Ecuador* \"), Decision on Liability of 14 December 2012, \u00b6 179.\n\n92.\n\nWhen applying the law (whether national or international), the Tribunal is of the view that it is not bound by the arguments and sources invoked by the Parties. The principle *iura novit curia* - or better, *iura novit arbiter* - allows the Tribunal to form its own opinion of the meaning of the law, provided that it does not surprise the Parties with a legal theory that was not subject to debate and that the Parties could not anticipate.68\n\n*See, e.g.,* *Daimler Financial Services A.G. v. Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/05/1, Decision on Annulment of 7 January 2015, \u00b6 295 (\"[\u2026] an arbitral tribunal is not limited to referring to or relying upon only the authorities cited by the parties. It can, *sua sponte*, rely on other publicly available authorities, even if they have not been cited by the parties, provided that the issue has been raised before the tribunal and the parties were provided an opportunity to address it\"). *See also Fisheries Jurisdiction Case* (Federal Republic of Germany v. Iceland), Merits, Judgment of 25 July 1974, \u00b6 18 (\"[i]t being the duty of the Court itself to ascertain and apply the relevant law in the given circumstances of the case, the burden of establishing or proving rules of international law cannot be imposed upon any of the Parties, for the law lies within the judicial knowledge of the Court.\"); *Albert Jan Oostergetel and Theodora Laurentius v. The Slovak Republic*, UNCITRAL Case, Award of 23 April 2012, \u00b6 141; *Metal-Tech Ltd. v. Republic of Uzbekistan*, ICSID Case No. ARB/10/3, Award of 4 October 2013, \u00b6 287.\n\n**C. Witness statement of Mr. Osvaldo Astudillo**\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n93.\n\nThe Claimants informed the Tribunal in their letter of 21 August 2013 that Mr. Osvaldo Astudillo, whose witness statement had been submitted together with the Claimants' Memorial, had passed away in July 2011. The Claimants \"respectfully request[ed] the Tribunal to grant Mr. Osvaldo Astudillo's witness statement of 10 August 2009 proper probative value, based on that statement's reliability and coherence with the other evidence presented by the Claimants.\"\n\n94.\n\nThe Respondent, in its letter of 2 September 2013, \"reserve[d] its right to submit its argument on the inadmissibility of the testimony of Mr. Astudillo in its Rejoinder taking into account, among other aspects, Bolivia's right to cross-examine the witnesses put forward by its counter-party in accordance with Rule 34 of the Arbitration Rules\" (Tribunal's translation). The Respondent did not address this matter in its Rejoinder, but explained at the hearing on the merits that \"Bolivia opposed giving value of proof to Mr Astudillo's written documents in light of the fact that he would not be able to participate in the actual hearings.\"69\n\nTr., Day 1, 150:4-7.\n\n95.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that Section 18 of the Minutes of the First Session provides the following:\n\nIt was agreed that if a witness called by one party is not made available for examination at the oral hearing, his/her statement will remain on record and the Tribunal will assess the probative value of that statement taking into account the record and all relevant circumstances, including the fact that the statement was not confirmed orally and that the witness was not cross-examined.\n\n96.\n\nThis provision must be read together with Rule 34(1) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules:\n\nEvidence: General Principles\n\nThe Tribunal shall be the judge of the admissibility of any evidence adduced and of its probative value.\n\n97.\n\nTaking these rules in consideration, the Tribunal shall attempt to rely on the remainder of the evidence presented by the Parties to reach its decision. Should the Tribunal need to rely on the evidence submitted by Mr. Astudillo when carrying out its analysis, it will clearly state so.\n\n**VI. THE CLAIMS FOR VIOLATIONS OF THE BIT**\n--------------------------------------------\n\n**A. The expropriation claim**\n------------------------------\n\n**1. Overview of the Parties' positions**\n-----------------------------------------\n\n98.\n\nThe Claimants argue that the revocation of its concessions through Decree 27589 (the Revocation Decree) constitutes an unlawful expropriation under Article VI of the BIT. They claim that \"the expropriation is both direct and indirect, as it affected the concessions held by NMM and the shares of Quiborax [in NMM].\"70 Specifically, they submit that the expropriatory act is illegal and does not serve the public interest, and discriminated against NMM on the basis of the Chilean nationality of Quiborax, its majority shareholder. Further, the Claimants have received no compensation for this expropriation.\n\nMem., \u00b6 137.\n\n99.\n\nFor its part, the Respondent denies that either the Revocation Decree or the subsequent writs of annulment of the concessions constitute an expropriation.\n\na. First, the Respondent contends that the Claimants' investments (specifically, their mining concessions) were illegal (and invalid) under Bolivian law from the outset, and thus were not entitled to the protection of the BIT or international law. The Respondent submits that the protection of the BIT is conditioned upon the validity of the Claimants' investments, not only as a matter of jurisdiction but also as a matter of merits. Specifically, in the context of expropriation, as the Claimants' concessions were illegally acquired and were thus null and void *ab initio*, they do not constitute rights that may be subject to expropriation.\n\nb. Second, the Respondent contends that the revocation and subsequent annulment of the Claimants' concessions was a consequence of the Claimants' defective acquisition and administration of the concessions and does not amount to an expropriation. Bolivia's actions were a legitimate and proportionate response to the illegality of the concessions, and thus cannot be characterized as a violation of the BIT or international law. In the Respondent's view, there can be no substantive violation of the BIT when the host State takes measures in response to a situation of illegality of the investment.71\n\nc. Third, the Respondent alleges that the claims have been presented prematurely and as a result cannot constitute an expropriation.\n\nCounter-Mem., \u00b6 131.\n\n100.\n\nIf the Tribunal were to find that the measures do amount to an expropriation, the Respondent argues that such expropriation is not unlawful either under the BIT or under international law.\n\n101.\n\nIn response to the Respondent's allegations, the Claimants contend that their claims are not premature and have been presented in accordance with Article X of the BIT. As regards the legality requirement on which Bolivia relies, the Claimants argue that the Respondent attempts to re-litigate issues that have already been resolved in the jurisdictional phase. In any event, they contend that the legality requirement does not apply regarding trivial breaches of domestic law.\n\n102.\n\nThe Tribunal will first address the Respondent's argument that the Claimants' investments were illegal and are thus not protected by the BIT (Section 2). It will then address the Respondent's argument that the Claimants' claims are premature (Section 3). The Tribunal will subsequently address whether the Respondent's actions constituted an expropriation of the Claimants' investments and, in the affirmative, whether that expropriation was unlawful (Section 4).\n\n**2. The Respondent's argument that the Claimants' investments were illegal**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**a. The Respondent's position**\n--------------------------------\n\n103.\n\nThe Respondent argues that there were serious irregularities in the acquisition and administration of the Claimants' concessions, which are sufficient to deny the Claimants' investments the protection of the BIT and international law. These same illegalities justify the revocation and annulment of the Claimants' concessions.\n\n104.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the BIT and international law do not offer substantive protection to investments that were not made in conformity with the internal law of the host State. This rule is expressly set out in the BIT, in Articles I(2), II and III(2). Specifically, pursuant to Article I(2) of the BIT, only investments made in accordance with the laws and regulations of the host State qualify under the definition of investment. In turn, Article II of the BIT, which defines the scope of application of the BIT, limits it to investments made in conformity with the host State's law. Finally, Article III(2) of the BIT provides that each Contracting Party shall protect the investments made in its territory in accordance with its laws and regulations. The effect of these provisions is to exclude from the substantive protection of the BIT investments that have not been made in accordance with the host State's laws.\n\n105.\n\nCiting decisions of investment tribunals, the Respondent submits that the substantive protections of a treaty do not apply to an illegal investment (*World Duty Free v. Kenya*,72*Plama Consortium Ltd. v. Bulgaria*73) and that, consequently, the measures taken by a State in response to illegalities in an investor's investments cannot violate the substantive protections of a treaty (*Genin v. Estonia*,74*Thunderbird v. Mexico*75). The Respondent contends that, in this case, \"the measures adopted by Bolivia were proportional and legitimate responses to the illegalities that vitiated the Mining Concessions from their origin and cannot, therefore, be characterized as violations of the Treaty or international law.\"76\n\n*World Duty Free Company Limited v. Republic of Kenya*, ICSID Case No. ARB/00/7 (\" *World Duty Free v. Kenya* \"), Award of 4 October 2006.\n\n*Plama Consortium Limited v. Bulgaria*, ICSID Case No. ARB/03/24 (\" *Plama v. Bulgaria* \"), Award of 27 August 2008.\n\n*Alex Genin, Eastern Credit Limited, Inc. and A.S. Baltoil v. Estonia*, ICSID Case No. ARB/99/2 (\" *Genin v. Estonia* \"), Award of 25 June 2001.\n\n*International Thunderbird Gaming Corporation v. United Mexican States*, UNCITRAL Case (\" *Thunderbird v. Mexico* \"), Award of 26 January 2006.\n\nCounter-Mem., \u00b6 131, Tribunal's translation.\n\n106.\n\nThe Respondent notes that, in its Decision on Jurisdiction, the Tribunal found that \"under the Bolivia-Chile BIT, the legality requirement is relevant to determine both the Treaty's scope of application and the scope of Bolivia's consent to arbitration.\"77 Other tribunals have confirmed that the legality of an investment is an element to be considered by the tribunal when applying the relevant treaty's substantive provisions (*i.e.*, at the time of a decision on the merits). Even if the legality requirement is not expressly included in the relevant treaty, tribunals have found it to be an implicit requirement deriving from the international law principle of good faith (*Plama*,78*Phoenix79*).\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 255.\n\n*Plama v. Bulgaria*, Award of 27 August 2008.\n\n*Phoenix Action, Ltd. v. Czech Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/06/5 (\" *Phoenix Action v. Czech Republic* \"), Award of 15 April 2009.\n\n107.\n\nThus, the validity of the investment under the law of the host State is an element that determines the substantive protection of investment treaties and concerns all substantive obligations of the State under the treaty with respect to the investment.80 This applies irrespective of whether the illegalities were known to the State when taking certain measures in relation to the investment (*Genin81*).\n\nThe Respondent also notes that the Tribunal is authorized to apply Bolivian law in accordance with the second sentence of Article 42(1) of the ICSID Convention, which provides that \"[i]n the absence of [the parties' agreement on the applicable law], the Tribunal shall apply the law of the Contracting State party to the dispute (including its rules on conflict of laws) [\u2026]\" (Counter-Mem., \u00b6 130, Tribunal's translation).\n\n*Genin v. Estonia*, Award of 25 June 2001.\n\n108.\n\nIn addition to this general legality requirement, the Respondent contends that the legality of the investment under the law of the host State is fundamental to characterize a State measure as an \"expropriation\" (*EnCana,82 Generation Ukraine,83 Thunderbird84*). Indeed, only property rights whose existence and validity are recognized by the law of the host State may be subject to expropriation.\n\n*EnCana Corporation v. Ecuador*, LCIA, Award of 3 February 2006.\n\n*Generation Ukraine, Inc. v. Ukraine*, ICSID Case No. ARB/00/9, Award of 16 September 2003.\n\n*Thunderbird v. Mexico*, Award of 26 January 2006.\n\n109.\n\nIn the present case, the Claimants' investments were illegal and invalid under Bolivian law from the start. Therefore, they do not constitute properly acquired property rights and cannot be subject to expropriation. The Tribunal should apply Bolivian law to these matters and conclude that the revocation and annulment of the Claimants' mining concessions is not an expropriation, and thus the State owes no compensation.\n\n110.\n\nWith respect to the nature of the alleged illegality, the Respondent argues that the Claimants' mining concessions were vitiated by two types of illegality: an \"original illegality\" and an \"ongoing illegality.\" As summarized by the Respondent:\n\n[T]he illegality incurred by the Claimants in this case has two dimensions: original and ongoing. The illegality incurred in establishing the investment (original illegality) is an obstacle to the implementation of the substantive guarantees of the Treaty, while the illegality incurred by the Claimants in the subsequent administration and operation of the alleged investment (ongoing illegality) prevents the verification of the factual requirements of the alleged violations, and justifies the challenged measures.85\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 52, p. 19. Tribunal's translation.\n\n111.\n\nWith respect to the alleged original illegality, the Respondent contends that RIGSSA and NMM, through Mr. David Moscoso, obtained the eleven mining concessions irregularly under Bolivian law, for the following reasons:86\n\na. The applications submitted by RIGSSA for seven of the concessions did not comply with the legal requirements regarding the legal status of the principal (RIGSSA) and the agent (Mr. Moscoso). This constitutes a violation of the procedure to obtain mining concessions established in Article 126 of the Mining Code,87 as well as of the rules on capacity contained in Article 33 of the Code of Commerce.88\n\nb. The four mining concessions obtained by NMM in 2002 were granted despite the fact that the applicant did not present proper authority to act in this procedure. In fact, the Tupiza and Tarija Regional Mining Superintendent, Ms. Pilar Vila Cort\u00e9s, who was responsible for granting the concessions to NMM, was investigated and consequently removed from her post due to the serious irregularities in the granting of those concessions.89\n\nc. The constitutive resolutions of some of those mining concessions were issued beyond the time limit established by Article 134 of the Mining Code.90\n\nd. Neither RIGSSA nor NMM were registered with the Technical Mining Service (*Servicio T\u00e9cnico de Minas*, \"SETMIN\"), as required by Article 122 of the Mining Code.\n\ne. The Cancha I and Cancha II concession files were tampered with, because the date of the resolutions that granted the concessions predates the payment of the mining patents.91 Bolivia also argues that since the Cancha I and Cancha II resolutions granted the concessions to Mr. David Moscoso instead of NMM, these administrative acts are invalid.92\n\nExhs. R-244 to R-254.\n\nExh. CD-6.\n\nExh. R-255.\n\nExh. R-259.\n\nExh. CD-6.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 38-40.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 34.\n\n112.\n\nThe Respondent also suggests that Mr. Moscoso and Mr. Ugalde abused their former positions in the Ministry of Mining in order to push for the adoption of the *Ley Valda*, with the ultimate purpose of obtaining the concessions.93\n\nCounter-Mem., \u00b6\u00b6 36-51, 123.\n\n113.\n\nWith respect to the alleged ongoing illegality, Bolivia asserts that the audits carried out in accordance with Law 2,564 identified irregularities in the operation of some of the Claimants' concessions. Specifically, the Respondent asserts that the Claimants' concessions breached domestic law in matters of tax, customs, industrial safety, environment and labor.94\n\nCounter-Mem., \u00b6 84.\n\n114.\n\nMoreover, the Respondent argues that the Claimants operated the mining concessions until 2004 without carrying out investments or prospects. According to the Respondent, during the two and a half years when NMM operated at the Salar de Uyuni, the Claimants made no investments to improve the production of ulexite and limited themselves to running the production fronts that already existed. The extraction, processing and transportation of the ulexite was artisanal, supported by the local means and did not involve any investment in infrastructure. In addition, Bolivia alleges that the Claimants did not carry out any of the investments mentioned in their economic expert's first report.95 With respect to exploration, the Respondent argues that the Claimants failed to carry out any reserve prospecting or study. Instead, they based themselves exclusively on the Aquater-EniChem Report that Mr. Moscoso handed to them.\n\nNavigant First ER, \u00b6\u00b6 124-127.\n\n**b. The Claimants' position**\n------------------------------\n\n115.\n\nThe Claimants contend that the Respondent's illegality arguments attempt to establish that the Claimants did not make an investment (or at least, an investment protected by the BIT) and that such arguments were already dismissed in the Decision on Jurisdiction. In any event, the Claimants reject the Respondent's allegations of illegality.\n\n116.\n\nWith respect to the Respondent's arguments of original illegality, the Claimants deny that the concessions were obtained through fraud, corruption or in breach of Bolivian law. The Respondent's accusations of fraud and corruption against Mr. Moscoso and Mr. Ugalde are false. First, Mr. Moscoso and Mr. Ugalde left public office long before setting up RIGGSA and obtaining an interest in the concessions. Second, the Respondent has not provided evidence of any connection between Mr. Moscoso and Mr. Ugalde and the adoption of the *Ley Valda*. Indeed, according to the Claimants, \"the facts seem to indicate that the *Ley Valda* was adopted to facilitate the operation of the giant San Crist\u00f3bal silver mine, located in the southern tip of the former fiscal reserve of the Salar de Uyuni.\"96\n\nReply, \u00b6 25.\n\n117.\n\nThe Claimants also deny that they committed breaches of Bolivian law in the acquisition of the concessions that could render them null and void. Specifically:\n\na. Regarding the first seven concessions, the Claimants maintain that Mr. Moscoso and RIGGSA complied with all relevant legal requirements when they requested them before the Tupiza and Tarija Regional Mining Superintendent.97 In particular, they claim that Mr. Moscoso presented all the necessary powers of attorney. Although they acknowledge that those powers of attorney were not registered in the Registry of Commerce at the time, they argue that their registration was not a requirement for the validity of the legal act, and in any event the powers of attorney were subsequently filed and registered before the Registry of Commerce. The Claimants also allege that Mr. Moscoso complied with the obligation to submit information related to the petitioner in accordance with Bolivian legal practice, and that the Superintendent of Mines was satisfied with the information provided. The requirements of Administrative Resolution 18/04 did not apply, as this resolution was issued four years after the concessions were granted. Finally, Article 33 of the Commercial Code creates an obligation for judges, not for administrative authorities nor for the Claimants.\n\nb. With regard to the four concessions acquired directly by NMM, the Claimants argue that the power of attorney which Mr. Moscoso submitted for himself and for Mr. Omar Le\u00f3n was sufficient.98 As for the destitution of the Tupiza and Tarija Regional Mining Superintendent in connection with the granting of these concessions, they point out that any errors made by her are not attributable to the Claimants and stress that the Respondent \"accuses its own administrative authorities of breaches of law and even fraud, in order to deny the legality of the Claimants' Concessions.\"99 In any event, the Claimants argue that they \"can also not be held accountable for possible errors in the administrative decisions by the Superintendent of Mines of Tupiza, the Respondent's own administrative authority.\"100\n\nc. Regarding the delay in the issuance of the constitutive resolutions of some of the concessions beyond the legal time limit, the Claimants allege that the delays were caused by the Director of the Technical Mining Service (SETMIN). In any case, Article 134 of the Mining Code imposes a 15-day time limit on the Superintendent of Mines, not on the applicants for a concession. Moreover, they argue that delays in the procedure and issuance of petitions for new concessions are very common and are not sanctioned with the nullity of the administrative act.101\n\nd. Finally, the Claimants argue that the Respondent tries to mislead the Tribunal by asserting that neither RIGSSA nor NMM were registered before the SETMIN, in breach of Article 122 of the Mining Code. The Claimants explain that, pursuant to Article 122 of the Mining Code, the SETMIN must keep a register of mining concessions, mining acts and contracts, but does not register mining companies. Therefore, NMM and RIGSSA could not have been registered with the Mining Registry.102\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 52-61.\n\nReply, \u00b6 62; Exhs.

According to the Claimants, \"these alleged \u2018irregularities' were first invoked in the *ex post* writs of annulment, as part of Bolivia's defense strategy.\"103\n\nReply, \u00b6 50.\n\n119.\n\nThe Claimants also note that the Respondent did not refer to these alleged formal irregularities in its Objections to Jurisdiction. Bolivia \"now attempts to use them to a double purpose: to deny the Tribunal's jurisdiction and to justify the *ex post* annulment of the Concessions. Both are moot points: the Tribunal has already confirmed its jurisdiction and the Concessions were revoked before they were annulled. Indeed, the Concessions could not have been \u2018revoked' if they were \u2018null and void' from the very beginning.\"104\n\nReply, \u00b6 51.\n\n120.\n\nIn any event, the Claimants contend that, as the Tribunal found in its Decision on Jurisdiction, the BIT's legality requirement does not extend to trivial breaches of domestic law. In particular, the Claimants argue that these alleged irregularities \"could not possibly be indicative of a carefully planned attempt by the Claimants to circumvent the requirements of Bolivian law.\"105\n\nReply, \u00b6 73.\n\n121.\n\nAs for the claims of ongoing illegality, the Claimants contend that \"the alleged breaches of mining, commercial or administrative law are either non-existent or utterly trivial.\"106 Regarding the alleged environmental breaches, the Claimants maintain that NMM complied \"at all times with all environmental regulations\"107 and criticizes Bolivia's use of a circular argument, \"[b]ecause the Respondent tried to persuade us and the Tribunal that the alleged non-existence of environmental licences would justify the expropriatory act when the environmental licence was illegally revoked by the same government the very same day of the expropriation.\"108\n\nReply, \u00b6 220, footnote omitted.\n\nTr., Day 3, 18:1-2.\n\nTr., Day 3, 22:2-7.\n\n122.\n\nFinally, the Claimants reject Bolivia's assertion that they operated the mining concessions until 2004 without carrying out investments or prospects, as follows:\n\nThe Tribunal declared itself \"satisfied that Quiborax's and NMM's original and subsequent contributions meet the contribution requirement for the \"investment\" test of Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention.\" The Tribunal's Decision on Jurisdiction leaves no room for doubt that the Claimants made an investment in Bolivia. There is also no room for the Respondent to, once again, argue to the contrary in its presentations on the merits.109\n\nReply, \u00b6 80.\n\n123.\n\nIn sum, the Claimants submit that the Respondent's claims of illegality do not pass the threshold set by the Tribunal in its Decision on Jurisdiction,110 nor do any of the cases cited by the Respondent interpret the legality requirement more broadly than the Decision on Jurisdiction. The trivial breaches of domestic law alleged by the Respondent should not therefore leave the Claimants without treaty protection nor justify an otherwise unlawful confiscation of their rights.\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 237.\n\n**c. Analysis**\n---------------\n\n124.\n\nThe Respondent argues that the Claimants' investments were affected by two types of illegality: an illegality in connection with the establishment of the investment (*i.e.*, an original illegality) and an illegality in its subsequent administration and operation (*i.e.*, an ongoing illegality). The Tribunal understands that the Respondent's argument has three prongs:\n\na. First, the Claimants did not make and operate an investment in accordance with Bolivian law and, hence, cannot benefit from the substantive protections of the BIT.\n\nb. Second, the acquisition of the Claimants' mining concessions was illegal and therefore the concessions were null and void *ab initio*. As a result, the Claimants had no right to those concessions that could be subject to expropriation.\n\nc. Third, the revocation and subsequent annulment of the Claimants' concessions were justified by the Claimants' breaches of Bolivian law in the establishment and operation of these concessions. Such measures are therefore punitive measures applied in the legitimate exercise of the State's police powers, rather than expropriations.\n\n125.\n\nThe Tribunal will now address the first two arguments. It will address the third argument in the context of its analysis of whether there has been an expropriation (Section VI.A.4 below).\n\n**i. Bolivia's argument that the Claimants' investments are not protected by the BIT**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n126.\n\nThe first prong of Bolivia's argument of illegality is that the Claimants' investments were not made nor operated in accordance with Bolivian law and that, as a result, they cannot benefit from the substantive protections of the BIT.\n\n127.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, an investment may benefit from the substantive protections of the BIT if it qualifies as an investment under the BIT and under the ICSID Convention, if the investment meets the legality requirement of the BIT, and is not denied the benefits of the BIT as a result of a specific provisions in the BIT (by virtue of a \"denial of benefits\" clause). In the Decision on Jurisdiction, the Tribunal found that Quiborax's and NMM's investments qualified as investments both under the BIT111 and under Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention.112 Bolivia did not invoke at that stage (nor does it do so now) the denial of benefits clauses contained in Articles I.1.c and II of the Protocol to the Bolivia-Chile BIT.\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 210-211.\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 237.\n\n128.\n\nWith respect to the legality requirement, in the Decision on Jurisdiction, the Tribunal found that it had both subject-matter and temporal limitations, as follows:\n\nThe subject-matter scope of the legality requirement is limited to (i) nontrivial violations of the host State's legal order [...], (ii) violations of the host State's foreign investment regime [...], and (iii) fraud - for instance, to secure the investment [\u2026] or profits [\u2026]. Additionally, under this BIT, the temporal scope of the legality requirement is limited to the establishment of the investment; it does not extend to the subsequent performance. Indeed, the Treaty refers to the legality requirement in the past tense by using the words investments \"made\" in accordance with the laws and regulations of the host State and, in Spanish, \"haya efectuado\" [\u2026].113\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 266. Footnotes omitted.\n\n129.\n\nTo the extent that the Respondent's allegations refer to the operation or performance of the investment (Bolivia's allegations of \"ongoing illegality\"), they are not relevant to the availability of the BIT's substantive protections. Instead, they are matters for the merits which the Tribunal will address when determining whether the Respondent breached its BIT obligations.114 By contrast, to the extent that the Respondent's allegations of illegality refer to the establishment of the investment (Bolivia's allegations of \"original illegality\") they fall under the temporal scope of the BIT's legality requirement. However, these allegations seek to reopen an issue that was resolved during the jurisdictional phase\n\n*See, e.g.,* *Urbaser S.A. and Consorcio de Aguas Bilbao Biskaia, Bilbao Biskaia Ur Partzuergoa v. Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/07/26, Decision on Jurisdiction of 19 December 2012, \u00b6 260. *See also* *Jan Oostergetel and Theodora Laurentius v. Slovak Republic*, UNCITRAL, Decision on Jurisdiction of 30 April 2010, \u00b6 176.\n\n130.\n\nThat the Tribunal's inquiry at that juncture was directed to establishing jurisdiction does not detract from the fact that the Tribunal ascertained that the Claimants' investments were made in accordance with Bolivian law. This conclusion also applies to the application of the substantive protections of the BIT. Only the allegation of an illegality that was unknown to Bolivia during the jurisdictional phase may justify reopening the matter at the merit stage.\n\n131.\n\nBolivia now argues that the Claimants' mining concessions were originally obtained by Mr. David Moscoso and Mr. \u00c1lvaro Ugalde through an abuse of their position as former officers of the Ministry of Mining. Specifically, Bolivia argues that the Claimants' concessions \"were the result of an irregular process that unduly benefitted public officers that knew, due to their functions, the nature and precise location of the Salar [de Uyuni]'s mineral wealth, \u00c1lvaro Ugalde and David Moscoso, who had been in office in the Ministry of Mining (Vice-minister and Legal Director, respectively).\"115 Indeed, Bolivia claims that the *Ley Valda* was adopted in dubious circumstances and suggests that Mr. Moscoso may have played a part in its adoption:\n\nThe personal interest of senator Valda in redefining the extension of the Fiscal Reserve of the Gran Salar de Uyuni is unclear. We understand that senator Valda's sister was (or had been), Mr. David Moscoso's personal secretary, therefore he could have promoted the bill.116\n\nCounter-Mem., \u00b6 123, Tribunal's translation.\n\nCounter-Mem., \u00b6 45, Tribunal's translation, footnote omitted.\n\n132.\n\nBolivia did not advance these arguments during the jurisdictional phase, although it had all the necessary elements to do so. As such, the objection could be rejected outright. Nevertheless, due to the gravity of the accusation, the Tribunal has considered the Respondent's allegation and has analyzed the evidence adduced to support it.\n\n133.\n\nHaving done so, the Tribunal finds that the evidence to which Bolivia refers in support of its contention117 is inconclusive. Specifically:\n\na. Bolivia cites former senator Mart\u00edn Quir\u00f3s Alcal\u00e1's \"Commentary on the Mining Code of 1997\" to claim that \"criminal hands\" were behind the adoption of the *Ley Valda*. The document, however, simply mentions that part of the media argued that there had been a \"criminal hand\" behind the \"adulteration\" of Quiros's bill, which contained a different proposal from that finally adopted in the *Ley Valda*.118 There is no mention of either Mr. Moscoso or Mr. Ugalde, nor any other indication of who this \"criminal hand,\" if any, might be.\n\nb. The Claimants have persuasively rebutted the existence of a connection between Mr. Moscoso and Senator Valda: Senator Valda's sister worked as a secretary at a gold mine company where Mr. Moscoso was a legal director between July 1994 and January 2001. However, they worked at offices located in different cities, she was never Mr. Moscoso's secretary, and it is not established that they worked at the company at the same time.119\n\nc. It seems undisputed that Messrs. Moscoso and Ugalde left public office long before obtaining an interest in the concessions (1985 and 1979, respectively). According to Articles 18 and 19 of the Mining Code,120 the restrictions on public officials to obtain an interest in mining concessions are limited to the first three months after leaving public office.\n\nExhs. R-227, CD-10, CD-28, CD-38, R-243, R-22 and R-240.\n\nExh. R-227, p. 272.\n\nReply, \u00b6 37.\n\nExh. CD-6.\n\n134.\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, the Tribunal cannot but dismiss the Respondent's argument that the Claimants' investments should be denied the substantive protection of the BIT because they were not made or operated in accordance with the law.\n\n**ii. Bolivia's argument that the Claimants' concessions were null and void** ***ab initio*** **and thus cannot be subject to expropriation**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n135.\n\nThe second facet of the Respondent's illegality argument is that, because the Claimants' concessions were obtained irregularly, they are null and void *ab initio*. As a result, the Claimants did not hold a right that could be subject to expropriation. The Tribunal agrees with the Respondent that, in order for a right to be expropriated, it must first exist under the relevant domestic law (in this case, Bolivian law).\n\n136.\n\nHere, the Tribunal stresses that it already held that the Claimants' investments were validly made under Bolivian law in the Decision on Jurisdiction. The Tribunal cannot but note that the Respondent did not make these allegations during the jurisdictional phase, when the legality of the Claimants investments was being discussed.\n\n137.\n\nBe this as it may, the Tribunal cannot follow the Respondent's argument as a matter of merits. The alleged illegalities that the Respondent now brings to the Tribunal's attention were first raised in the writs of annulment of the concessions. Indeed, on 28 October 2004, the concessions were annulled for failure to comply with Articles 126 and 128 of the Mining Code, on the grounds of \" *impersoner\u00eda en el mandante y mandatario* \" (*i.e.*, lack of legal capacity or sufficient representation of the principal and agent).121 This annulment took place four months after the revocation of the concessions on different grounds. As the Claimants point out, had the concessions been improperly granted they would have been annulled or declared null and void in the first place, not revoked.\n\nExh. R-276; *see* \u00b6 31 *supra*.\n\n138.\n\nAs discussed in Section VI.A.4 below, the annulment of the concessions on these formal grounds appears to have been a form of \"damage control\" by the Respondent in order to make the cancellation of the concessions definitive after the legality of the Revocation Decree was questioned. Indeed, in the 2004 Inter-Ministerial Memo, members of the Bolivian Government were considering precisely this defense strategy in connection with the Claimants' BIT case:\n\nSECOND SCENARIO - The Bolivian Government may attempt to defend its decisions. Unfortunately, the Mining Code makes no provisions for the revocation of mining concessions. Therefore, this option has a great weakness. Another alternative would be to try to prove irregularities in the processing of the original mining concessions of Non Metallic Minerals S.A., so as to demonstrate that these are and always have been invalid. For the time being, this has been considered the best alternative.122\n\nExh. CD-68, Tribunal's translation.\n\n139.\n\nThis strongly suggests that the annulment of the concessions on the formal grounds cited above was an *ex post* attempt to improve Bolivia's defense in this arbitration, not a *bona fide* exercise of Bolivia's police powers. It also suggests that the alleged irregularities were either fabricated or trivial breaches that would not normally justify the annulment of a concession. Although the 2004 Inter-Ministerial Memo postdates the writs of annulment, it confirms the course of action adopted by the Government by stating that \"[f]or the time being, this has been considered the best alternative.\"123\n\nExh. CD-68, Tribunal's translation.\n\n140.\n\nIn any event, the Tribunal finds that the Claimants have established that the flaws alleged by Bolivia are either non-existent or are not subject to the sanction of annulment of the concessions. They did so with respect to the first seven concessions obtained by RIGSSA as follows:\n\na. The Claimants have shown that the petitions for each concession all contain the powers of attorney from RIGSSA to Mr. Moscoso.124\n\nb. The Claimants acknowledge that these powers of attorney were not registered in the Registry of Commerce. However, although Article 29(5) of the Commercial Code imposes the obligation to register \"any acts that grant, modify, substitute or revoke the general or special authority to administer goods or businesses of the merchant,\"125 failure to do so is not sanctioned by the nullity of the power of attorney. Instead, Article 34 of the Commercial Code provides that failure to register acts and documents subject to registration is a fine imposed by the Registry.126 Further, Article 31 provides that acts or documents subject to registration are effective *vis-\u00e0-vis* third parties only from the moment of their registration.127\n\nc. The Claimants claim that Mr. Moscoso presented the powers of attorney, duly registered, to the Superintendent of Mines in January 2002.128 The Tribunal notes that Exh. R-256, upon which the Claimants rely for this assertion, appears to be a request to add certain powers of attorney to the original concession files. However, the powers of attorney themselves are not attached, nor is a copy of their registration in the Commercial Registry, so the Tribunal cannot confirm the veracity of this statement. That said, as the failure to register is not sanctioned by the nullity of the power of attorney, the Tribunal does not find this fact determinative.\n\nd. The Tribunal finds that the Claimants otherwise complied with the general practice at the Superintendence of Mines with respect to Article 126 of the Mining Code, which requires the applicant to submit general information regarding the law of the applicant (\" *datos* [\u2026] *generales de ley del peticionario* \"). The Respondent has not shown that this expression required specific documents, and the Superintendent of Mines could have requested further documents if it had considered that the documents submitted were insufficient. In addition, Administrative Resolution 18/04, which requires the submission of a company's certificate of incorporation, was passed in November 2004. In any event, that Administrative Resolution grants the applicant the opportunity to correct the omission within 15 days before archiving the petition.129\n\ne. Finally, although Article 33 of the Commercial Code provides that judges must require merchants to show their registration before the Registry of Commerce, this is an obligation imposed upon judges, not on the Claimants.130\n\nExhs. R-244 to R-250.\n\nTribunal's translation. The original Spanish text provides: \"Art. 29.- (ACTOS Y CONTRATOS SUJETOS A INSCRIPCION).

R-255).\n\n141.\n\nSimilarly, the record does not substantiate the defects alleged with regard to the four concessions acquired directly by NMM:\n\na. The Claimants have shown that Mr. Moscoso did submit a power of attorney for himself to act on behalf of NMM, which was granted by NMM's general manager, Mr. Omar Le\u00f3n.131 Although the power of attorney for Mr. Omar Le\u00f3n is not attached, the notary before whom such power of attorney 631/2001 (Exh. R-251) was granted certified that Mr. Le\u00f3n duly represented NMM on the basis of \"General Management Power of Attorney\" (\" *Poder Especial de Administraci\u00f3n* \") No. 531/2001 issued on 2 October 2001 and granted at that same notary.132 Given the notary public's role as certifying officer (\" *ministro de fe* \"), the Tribunal finds that this suffices to establish Mr. Le\u00f3n's authority to represent NMM.\n\nb. With respect to the destitution of the Tupiza and Tarija Regional Mining Superintendent, the Tribunal agrees with the Claimants that any errors made by her are not attributable to the Claimants.\n\n*See* Power of attorney 631/2001 of 19 November 2011, included in Exhs. R-251 (pp. 35-36), R-252 (pp. 34-35), R-253 (pp. 11-12) and R-254 (pp. 12-13).\n\nPower of attorney 631/2001 states that \"\"OMAR ANDRES LEON PEREZ [\u2026] en su condici\u00f3n de APODERADO ESPECIAL ESPECIAL [sic] de [NMM] [\u2026] y debidamente facultado para este acto en m\u00e9rito a los incisos f) y h) del poder General de Administraci\u00f3n N\u00b0 531/2001 de fecha 2 de Octubre de 2001 [\u2026] confiere PODER ESPECIAL Y SUFICIENTE, cual por derecho se requiere en favor del se\u00f1or DAVID MOSCOSO RUIZ [...] para que en nombre y representaci\u00f3n de [NMM] para su legal representaci\u00f3n act\u00fae con plena capacidad y poder para solicitar concesiones mineras conforme al C\u00f3digo de Miner\u00eda vigente, a nombre de la sociedad mandante, ubicadas en la jurisdicci\u00f3n de la provincia Nor Lipez del departamento de Potos\u00ed [\u2026].\"\n\n142.\n\nFurther, the Tribunal finds that the delay in the issuance of the constitutive resolutions of the concessions \"Tete,\" \"Pococho\" and \"La Negra\" beyond the time limit set in Article 134 of the Mining Code cannot have the effect of rendering the concessions null and void for the following reasons:\n\na. The Law on General Administrative Procedure invoked by the Respondent dates from 23 April 2002 and entered into force twelve months later in 2003,133 while the relevant concessions were granted in the years 2000 and 2002.134\n\nb. Assuming *arguendo* that the provisions of this act were applicable to the situation at hand, the failure of the Superintendent of Mines to meet the time limit imposed in Article 134 of the Mining Code does not appear to trigger the nullity of the concession. While that provision states that if the Superintendent does not comply with the 15 day time limit to grant the concessions following the preparation of the definitive concession plan by the SETMIN, the Superintendent ceases to be competent,135 the granting of the concessions is not automatically null and void. Pursuant to Article 35 of the Law on General Administrative Procedure, administrative acts issued by an incompetent administrative authority are only automatically null and void (\" *nulos de pleno derecho* \") if that incompetence relates to subject matter or territory.136 Here, however, the defect stems from failure to meet a deadline, so the appropriate sanction is that provided in Article 36(III): \"Performance of administrative acts outside of the established time limits shall be voidable when the nature of the term or deadline so imposes it.\"137 Given that the time limit is imposed to accelerate the procedure to the benefit of the applicants, the Tribunal does not believe that the nature of the time limit vitiates the grant of the concession.\n\nc. Even if the failure by the Superintendent to meet the time limit established in Article 134 of the Mining Code had arguably made the concessions voidable, voidable acts (\" *actos anulables* \") as opposed to acts that are (automatically) null and void (\" *actos nulos de pleno derecho* \") may be validated by a subsequent act of the administrative authority.138 The Tribunal considers that the fact that the Superintendent granted the concessions despite the expiration of the time limit constitutes such a validation.\n\nd. Even assuming further that the concessions had remained voidable after having been granted by the Superintendent, voidable acts are deemed to be valid until they are declared void by a competent authority.139 There is no dispute that the concessions were not declared null and void until October 2004 after their revocation in June 2004. Hence, the concessions were valid at the time when they were revoked.\n\nExh. R-258, Second Final Provision, p. 17.\n\nExhs. R-244, R-251 and R-252.\n\nArticle 134 of the Mining Code (Exh. CD-6) provides: \"Once the requirement indicated in the preceding article has been complied with [the preparation of the definitive plan of the concession by the Technical Mining Service] and within a maximum period of fifteen calendar days from said compliance, subject to loss of competence, the Mining Superintendent [\u2026] will grant the mining concessions through an express constitutive resolution [\u2026].\"[\u2026],\" Tribunal's translation. The original Spanish text reads as follows: \"Cumplido el requisito se\u00f1alado en el art\u00edculo precedente y en el plazo m\u00e1ximo de quince d\u00edas calendario desde dicho cumplimiento, bajo sanci\u00f3n de p\u00e9rdida de competencia, el Superintendente de Minas [\u2026] otorgar\u00e1 la concesi\u00f3n minera mediante resoluci\u00f3n constitutiva expresa [\u2026].\"\n\nThe original Spanish text of Article 35(1) of the Law on General Administrative Procedure (Exh.

R-258, Tribunal's translation. The original Spanish text of Article 36(III) of the Law on General Administrative Procedure provides: \"La realizaci\u00f3n de actuaciones administrativas fuera del tiempo establecido para ellas s\u00f3lo dar\u00e1 lugar a la anulabilidad del acto cuando as\u00ed lo imponga la naturaleza del t\u00e9rmino o plazo.\"\n\nThe original Spanish text of Article 37(I) of the Law on General Administrative Procedure (Exh. R-258) provides: \"Los actos anulables pueden ser convalidados, saneados o rectificados por la misma autoridad administrativa que dict\u00f3 el acto, subsanando los vicios de que adolezca.\"\n\nThe original Spanish text of Article 36(IV) of the Law on General Administrative Procedure (Exh. R-258) provides that \"[l]as anulabilidades podr\u00e1n invocarse \u00fanicamente mediante la interposici\u00f3n de los recursos administrativos previstos en la presente Ley.\"\n\n143.\n\nBolivia also claims that RIGSSA and NMM were not registered with the SETMIN and thus did not comply with Article 122 of the Mining Code. Article 122 of the Mining Code spells out SETMIN's responsibilities, including the responsibility to keep a national data base with all mining documentation (122(c)) and to manage a Mining Registry recording all mining acts and contracts.140 Article 122 makes no specific reference to mining companies.\n\nArticle 122(e) of the Mining Code (Exh. CD-6) provides that the SETMIN's responsibilities include \"[o]rganizar y mantener el Registro Minero en el cual deber\u00e1n inscribirse obligatoriamente todos los actos y contratos mineros.\"\n\n144.\n\nFinally, the Tribunal notes that one of the guiding principles of the General Law on Administrative Procedure is the principle of informality, whereby \"failure by the applicant to comply with non-essential formal requirements that can be complied with in the future may be excused, and that circumstance shall not interrupt the administrative procedure\" (Article 4(l)).141 Although this text did not enter into force until after the concessions had been granted, it suggests that Bolivian administrative law is more flexible with breaches of formal requirements than what the Respondent argues. Based on this provision, the Tribunal cannot accept the Respondent's argument that the Claimants could not subsequently correct the errors in the constitution of the concessions, because this is not allowed under Bolivian law (\" *no* *existen en la legislaci\u00f3n boliviana procedimientos correctivos de la naturaleza invocada por las Demandantes* \").142\n\nArticle 4(I) of the General Law on Administrative Procedure (Exh. R-258) provides: \"Principio de informalismo: La inobservancia de exigencias formales no esenciales por parte del administrado, que puedan ser cumplidas posteriormente, podr\u00e1n ser excusadas y ello no interrumpir\u00e1 el procedimiento administrativo.\"\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 30.\n\n145.\n\nThe Tribunal has also considered the Respondent's claim that the concession files for Cancha I and Cancha II had been tampered with.143 Bolivia's argument is that the date of the resolutions that granted the concessions (10 July 2003144) predates the payment of the mining patents (25 July 2003145). However, the Tribunal notes that the title deeds for both concessions specify that the date of the resolutions is 30 July 2003.146 In the absence of more compelling evidence, the Tribunal attaches more weight to the title deeds, which are documents issued before a public notary.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 38-40, with reference to Exhs. R-253 and R-254.\n\nExhs. R-253 and R-254, pp. 39-40 of the original numbering of both files.\n\n*See* p. 36 of the original numbering of both files.\n\nExhs. CD-36 and CD-37, p. 9 of the original numbering of both files.\n\n146.\n\nBolivia also argues that since the Cancha I and Cancha II resolutions granted the concessions to Mr. David Moscoso instead of NMM, these administrative acts are invalid.147 While the resolutions included at the end of Exhibits R-253 and R-254 indeed do not mention NMM, the same resolutions recorded in the relevant title deeds state that the concessions are granted to NMM (Exhs. CD-36 and CD-37). As Mr. Moscoso was acting on behalf of NMM, the discrepancy may be due to a clerical error which was subsequently corrected in the title deeds. As before, in its assessment of the evidence, the Tribunal considers that the official deeds carry more weight.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 34.\n\n147.\n\nAs a final matter in respect of Cancha I and Cancha II, the Tribunal observes that these concessions were drying fields not used to extract ulexite. Thus, even if the Claimant had not acquired these concessions validly, their damage claim would not be affected.\n\n148.\n\nThe Tribunal has also noted that the legal audit reported that the Claimants had not paid the compulsory mining fees.148 As the Claimants have acknowledged, failure to pay the yearly mining fees (\" *patentes* \") is sanctioned with the expiry (\" *caducidad* \") of the concessions (Article 65 of the Mining Code). Having examined the legal audit report,149 the Tribunal notes that the Prefect of Potos\u00ed stated that the Claimants had failed to pay the required mining fees within the relevant time limit before the concessions were acquired.150 However, the concession files submitted by the Respondent show that the Claimants did in fact pay the required mining fee when applying for the concessions, after which the concessions were granted.151 A concession can only be sanctioned with expiry once it has been granted. As the flaw was corrected before the concessions were granted, the Tribunal considers that the sanction of expiry cannot apply in this case. The Claimants have alleged that they paid all yearly mining fees,152 and the Respondent has not disputed this.\n\nExh.

The Respondent's argument that the Claimants' claims are premature**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**a. The Respondent's position**\n--------------------------------\n\n150.\n\nThe Respondent argues that the Claimants have not made reasonable efforts to obtain the revocation of Bolivia's alleged breaches of the BIT before local courts, and that their claims are therefore premature. More specifically, Bolivia contends that the Claimants have failed to make reasonable efforts to obtain the revocation of the Revocation Decree, thereby depriving the State of an opportunity to remedy its allegedly wrongful conduct.153\n\nCounter-Mem., \u00b6 105.\n\n151.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, such reasonable efforts are a constitutive element of a breach of treaty and international law. It specifies that \"[t]his requirement cannot and should not be confused with a procedural requirement to exhaust local remedies before resorting to an international tribunal. On the contrary, it provides that an international illicit act can only be established through a definitive decision of the State that affects the investor's rights.\"154\n\nCounter-Mem., \u00b6 107, Tribunal's translation (emphasis in original).\n\n152.\n\nIn this respect, the Respondent alleges that the Claimants notified the existence of a dispute under the BIT before the mining concessions had been returned to the State.155 It claims that RIGSSA filed an appeal regarding seven of the concessions, which was dismissed because it was not timely.156 Other than that, the Claimants made no attempt or reasonable effort to challenge the legislative and administrative acts which they now describe as violations of the BIT and international law. Consequently, so the Respondent submits, this Arbitral Tribunal must dismiss all of the Claimants' claims as premature.\n\nExhs. CD-58 and CD-59.\n\nExh. R-277.\n\n**b. The Claimants' position**\n------------------------------\n\n153.\n\nThe Claimants argue that their claims are not premature and were submitted in accordance with Article X of the Bolivia-Chile BIT.\n\n154.\n\nIn particular, the Claimants submit that they were \"under no obligation under the BIT to seek redress in domestic courts\"157 before bringing a claim to international arbitration, and reject the notion of \"a general obligation to seek redress in domestic courts before resorting to international arbitration\" entertained by the Respondent.158 On the contrary, in accordance with Article X of the Bolivia-Chile BIT, the Claimants may either pursue their claims in domestic proceedings or in international arbitration, but may not do both. Here, the Claimants argue that they chose to resort to ICSID arbitration because their experience in Bolivia and the social and political climate in the country at the time of the expropriation led them to believe that they could not obtain an impartial judgment in Bolivia. NMM's right to resort to domestic proceedings to challenge Decree 27589 is irrelevant for the Claimants' right to initiate international arbitration under the BIT.\n\nReply, \u00b6 201.\n\nReply, \u00b6 203.\n\n155.\n\nThe Claimants assert that Bolivia attempts to impose an obligation to exhaust local remedies, which may be a requirement for a claim of denial of justice, but not for one of expropriation. Moreover, under Article 26 of the ICSID Convention, Contracting States have waived the requirement of exhaustion of local remedies as a precondition to the submission of disputes to ICSID, unless otherwise stated. Bolivia has made no reservation under Article 26 and is thus fully bound by it.\n\n**c. Analysis**\n---------------\n\n156.\n\nThe Respondent argues that the Tribunal should dismiss all of the claims as premature because the Claimants made no reasonable efforts to obtain the revocation of the act complained of. The Claimants, in turn, deny that they should have sought redress in local courts prior to initiating international arbitration.\n\n157.\n\nThe Tribunal does not believe that the claims brought before it are premature. Indeed, the wording of Article X(4) of the Bolivia-Chile BIT is unambiguous:\n\nOnce the investor has referred the dispute to the competent court of the Contracting Party on whose territory the investment was made or to the arbitral tribunal, the choice of one or other proceeding will be final.\n\n(Tribunal's translation)\n\n158.\n\nThis Article contains a fork-in-the-road provision that would have prevented the Claimants from bringing their case to an arbitral tribunal if they would have first gone through the local judicial channels.\n\n159.\n\nMoreover, the Tribunal is not persuaded by the Respondent's argument that the alleged expropriatory measure, Decree 27589, was not a \"definitive decision of the State.\" It was a Presidential Decree, issued by the State's highest executive authority, it was not, as the Claimants have pointed out, \"an act of maladministration by some lower administrative authority.\"159 In addition, its wording is clear: it revoked the Claimants' concessions and ordered them to be returned to the State within the next thirty days. To the Tribunal's mind, Decree 27589 was definitive enough.\n\nReply, \u00b6 211.\n\n160.\n\nConsequently, the Tribunal does not consider that the claims are premature.\n\n**4. Was there an unlawful expropriation of the Claimants' investments?**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**a. The Claimants' position**\n------------------------------\n\n161.\n\nThe Claimants contend that the Revocation Decree expropriated their investments in Bolivia (i), and that this expropriation was unlawful under the BIT (ii).\n\n**i. Decree 27,589 expropriated the Claimants' investments**\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n162.\n\nThe Claimants submit that the Revocation Decree expropriated their investments in Bolivia. In their Memorial on the Merits, the Claimants argued that the expropriation was both direct and indirect:160\n\na. On the one hand, the Revocation Decree revoked NMM's concessions and ordered NMM to deliver them to the authorities of Potos\u00ed within a period of thirty days. The Claimants see this order as a case of a \"formal or obligatory transfer of title in favour of the host State\" in accordance with the definition of direct expropriation found in particular in *Metalclad Corp* v. *United Mexican States*.161 In other words, there has been a direct expropriation of NMM's investments.\n\nb. As a consequence of the expropriation of the concessions, Quiborax's shares in NMM became worthless overnight. Although Quiborax is still nominally the owner of 51% of NMM's shares, it has lost the economic use and enjoyment of its investments. Relying on *Metalclad*,162*Starret Housing Corporation v. Iran,*163 and *Tecmed*,164 the Claimants argue that the revocation of NMM's concessions has had the effect of depriving Quiborax of the benefits of its property in a manner equivalent to an expropriation. As a result, there has been an indirect expropriation of Quiborax's investments.\n\nMem., \u00b6 137.\n\n*Metalclad Corporation v. United Mexican States*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/97/1 (\" *Metalclad v. Mexico* \"), Award of 30 August 2000, \u00b6 103.\n\n*Metalclad v. Mexico*, Award of 30 August 2000, \u00b6 103.\n\n*Starrett Housing Corporation v. Islamic Republic of Iran* (1983) (\" *Starrett Housing v.

Mexico* \"), Award of 29 May 2003.\n\n163.\n\nIn their Reply and during the hearing, the Claimants focused solely on the direct expropriation of the NMM's investments, without seeking to establish the diminution in value of Quiborax's shares in NMM.\n\n164.\n\nThe Claimants add that, while it is not necessary for the State to benefit from the expropriation, in this case Bolivia has obtained important benefits from the confiscation of the concessions, as the related land contains valuable natural resources such as borates, potassium and lithium.165\n\nBehre Dolbear, First ER, \u00b6 111.\n\n165.\n\nThe Claimants submit that, despite the fact that the Revocation Decree does not present itself as an expropriation, it is expropriatory in nature. The Respondent's attempts to characterize it as an act of revocation do not detract from the unlawfulness of the deprivation of property suffered by the Claimants.\n\n166.\n\nThe Claimants further contend that the expropriatory act was the Revocation Decree, not the *ex post* writs of annulment of the concessions. According to the Claimants, \"[t]he *ex post* annulment of the Concessions constitutes a breach of Bolivia's treaty obligations to provide fair and equitable treatment and refrain from taking arbitrary or discriminatory measures,\" but they \"are not an expropriation. The Claimants had already been expropriated, directly and definitively, by DS 27,589 of 23 June 2004.\"166\n\nReply, \u00b6 82.\n\n167.\n\nCiting *Santa Elena167* and other authorities, the Claimants argue that the date of the expropriation is the date on which the owner has been deprived of its property rights or of their economic use. In this case, the Claimants contend that this occurred when the concessions were revoked on 23 June 2004, and when they were forced to return them to the Prefect of Potos\u00ed on 23 July 2004. After that date, they never operated the concessions again. The fact that NMM was able to export accumulated ulexite until 24 September 2004 does not alter this fact, as NMM's property right of previously extracted ulexite is separable from its entitlement to the concessions.168\n\n*Compa\u00f1\u00eda del Desarrollo Santa Elena S.A. v. Republic of Costa Rica*, lCSID Case No. ARB/96/1 (\" *Santa Elena v. Costa Rica* \"), Final Award of 17 February 2000.\n\nMem., \u00b6\u00b6 83, 86-95.\n\n168.\n\nThe Claimants emphasize that they were victims of a direct expropriation through the revocation of the concessions by the Revocation Decree; they were not victims of a creeping expropriation that started on 23 June 2004 and became definitive on 28 October 2004, the date on which the writs of annulment were issued. The Claimants argue that the concepts of direct expropriation and creeping expropriation are mutually exclusive, and that there cannot be a \"repeat\" expropriation once the first expropriation has deprived the owner of its property. Citing *Burlington v. Ecuador*,169 they argue that \"there cannot be a creeping expropriation where there is direct expropriation,\" and that \"later \u2018expropriatory' measures are irrelevant if they merely formalize an already existing state of affairs.\"170 According to the Claimants, the revocation of their concessions was definitive, and the subsequent annulment of these concessions did not alter this state of affairs.171\n\n*Burlington v. Ecuador*, Decision on Liability of 14 December 2012.\n\nReply, \u00b6 105.\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 95-105.\n\n169.\n\nFurther, the Respondent cannot increase the burden of proof upon them, so say the Claimants, by having them defend themselves from two direct expropriations.172\n\nReply, \u00b6 85.\n\n170.\n\nFinally, the Claimants argue that the writs of annulment (as well as the subsequent revocation of the Revocation Decree) are part of the Respondent's defense strategy in this arbitration.173\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 85, 106-120.\n\n**ii. The expropriation was unlawful**\n--------------------------------------\n\n171.\n\nThe Claimants argue that Article VI prohibits all forms of deprivation of property, except by lawful expropriation under the following conditions: the expropriation must be (i) for a public purpose or in the national interest; (ii) in accordance with the law; (iii) non-discriminatory and (iv) accompanied by immediate, adequate and effective compensation. The Claimants contend that none of these conditions were met.\n\n*(a) The Revocation Decree was not issued in accordance with the law and did not serve the public interest*\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n172.\n\nFirst, the Claimants assert that the Revocation Decree was not issued in accordance with the law and did not serve the public interest. Although it is allegedly founded on Law 2,564, this law was \"targeted legislation and the first step in the *iter expropriatorio* that culminated in DS. 27,589 and the forced delivery of the concessions as ordered under the same Presidential Decree.\"174 Indeed, according to the Claimants, Law 2,564 was \"tailor made to annul the concessions in area of Rio Grande,\"175 was \"adopted under pressure of political organizations of the Department of Potosi,\" and \"was specifically designed to provide the Executive with the power to annul concessions in the Rio Grande area.\"176\n\nMem., \u00b6 143.\n\nMem., \u00b6 146.\n\nMem., \u00b6 143, Exh. CD-65.\n\n173.\n\nThe Claimants allege that Article 3 of Law 2,564 \"created an extraordinary power, vested in the Executive, to annul previously constituted concessions.\"177 They argue that this power to annul was \"very broadly defined, under the only condition that the annulment must take place within a peremptory period of sixty days.\"178\n\nMem., \u00b6 147.\n\nMem., \u00b6 147.\n\n174.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, Law 2,564 is unconstitutional and violates fundamental principles of international law, in particular because it overruled established procedures under administrative law and expanded the causes for annulment in the Mining Code retroactively. Specifically, the Claimants contend that Law 2,564 violates the principles of non-retroactivity and legal certainty set forth in Articles 33 and 7(a) the 1967 Bolivian Constitution, which was in force when Law 2,564 was enacted.179\n\nMem., \u00b6\u00b6 147-149; Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 129-133; Exh. R-286.\n\n175.\n\nMore specifically, the Claimants argue that Law 2,564 and any annulments pronounced under it fail to meet the minimum requirements of due process of law under both international law and Bolivian law. Citing *ADC v. Hungary*,180 the Claimants submit that \"due process of law\" requires an actual and substantive legal procedure, providing for certain basic procedural mechanisms such as advance notice and a fair hearing, in which the investor has a reasonable chance to claim its rights and be heard.181\n\n*ADC Affiliate Limited and ADC & ADMC Management Limited v. Republic Hungary*, ICSID Case No. ARB/03/16 (\" *ADC v. Hungary* \"), Award of 2 October 2006.\n\n*ADC v. Hungary*, Award of 2 October 2006, \u00b6 435, cited by the Claimants at Mem., \u00b6 149.\n\n176.\n\nBolivian law also requires certain minimum standards of due process. Citing provisions of the Law of General Administrative Procedure182 and of the Mining Code,183 the Claimants submit that:\n\nUnder Bolivian administrative law, the party affected by the annulment of an administrative act must be notified of the initiation of any procedure that may affect their [ *sic* ] interests or rights. The administrative act is considered lawful until established otherwise by a judge. The affected party must be given an opportunity to present evidence within a certain period of time or even at any time during the procedure. The administrative decision must state its reasons and legal cause. The affected party can challenge the administrative decision before the administrative authorities and in court. Mining concessions particularly can only be annulled for the limited causes established under Articles 17 and 18 of the Mining Code.184\n\nExh. R-258.\n\nExh. CD-6.\n\nReply, \u00b6 132 (footnotes omitted).\n\n177.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, none of these procedural requirements was respected by either Law 2,564 or the Revocation Decree, as neither of these instruments provided for a notification of the initiation of the audits, an opportunity to present evidence or participate in the proceedings, or means to challenge the decisions. Nor did Law 2,564 explain what breaches would be serious enough to justify the annulment of the concessions.185\n\nReply, \u00b6 133 (footnotes omitted.\n\n178.\n\nThe Claimants assert that \"they were never informed of any auditing procedures nor participated in any of them.\"186 They claim that the first time that they were able to review the four audit reports submitted by the Respondent as evidence was in the context of this arbitration and, except for the SERGEOMIN-COMIBOL audit, until now they are not even in a position to confirm that these audits had actually occurred.187\n\nReply, \u00b6 135.\n\nReply, \u00b6 136.\n\n179.\n\nIn any event, the Claimants argue that the Revocation Decree was not issued in accordance with Law 2,564. First, the Revocation Decree was issued after the 60-day period set in Law 2,564. Nor were the audits (with the possible exception of the SERGEOMIN-COMIBIL audit) finalized within that 60-day period.\n\n180.\n\nSecond, although the revocation of the Claimants' concessions was allegedly based on the auditing procedures established by Law 2,564, the grounds invoked in the decree have no support in the auditing reports to which it refers. With the exception of the legal audit conducted by the Prefect of Potos\u00ed, all the audits made general recommendations that applied to all investigated companies. Specifically:\n\na. The SERGEOMIN-COMIBOL report188 is a document that describes the concessions in the R\u00edo Grande Delta and the operating companies in that area (NMM, SOCOMIRG and Copla) in general terms. It does not specify environmental damages, it only states that the environmental situation is deficient because of a lack of control and makes general observations applicable to all three companies. It makes no recommendations specific to NMM.\n\nb. The report by the Ministry of Sustainable Development189 concludes that all four investigated companies (Copla, NMM, Tecno Qu\u00edmica and SOCOMIRG) were operating without proper environmental documentation. The Claimants assert that NMM had presented a request for an environmental license in January 2003, but that a decision was still pending one year later.190 The Claimants argue that, pursuant to Article 107 of the Environmental Regulations for Mining Activities,191 NMM was allowed to operate the concession pending the license request. In any event, NMM submitted an updated *Manifiesto Ambiental* for its concession Borateras de Cuevitas in May 2004192 and received its environmental license on 9 June 2004.193\n\nc. The report provided by the Customs Service194 also referred to all companies in the area that exploited or exported minerals between 1998-2003, and likewise did not contain conclusions or recommendations specific to NMM.\n\nd. Finally, the legal audit authored by Ms. Ludy Moscoso (a legal consultant of the Prefect of Potos\u00ed, unrelated to Mr. David Moscoso), recommends the annulment of thirty requests for concessions, only seven of which were the ones requested by Mr. David Moscoso. The four concessions granted to NMM are not included in that list.195\n\nExh. R-261.\n\nExh. R-267.\n\nExh. CCD-169.\n\nExh. CD-191.\n\nExh. CD-170.\n\nExh. CD-42.\n\nExh. R-270.\n\nThe Claimants also emphasize that, contrary to the Respondent's suggestions, neither NMM nor Mr. Moscoso were notified of the legal audit conducted by the Prefect of Potos\u00ed. The signature on the notice performed by the Superintendence of Mines is not his but Ms. Ludy Moscoso's. In addition, nothing in the document indicates that it is a notification of an auditing procedure conducted by the Prefect of Potos\u00ed. The Claimants insist that they had no knowledge of this audit until the Respondent's presentation in its Counter-Memorial (Reply, \u00b6 143).\n\n181.\n\nBy contrast, the Revocation Decree refers to an alleged refusal to cooperate with the Bolivian Revenue and Customs Services and to discrepancies in the amounts of ulexite declared and cargo volumes transported in breach of provisions of the Tax Code.196 The Claimants assert that NMM was never approached by the Customs Services or the Internal Revenue Service, nor was it requested to provide information for the purpose of an auditing procedure under Law 2,564. The Claimants also highlight that the SERGEOMIN-COMIBOL report does not refer to any alleged discrepancies between exported and declared amounts of ulexite; does not make any specific recommendation with respect to NMM; and that the Customs Service's report does not do so either. The Claimants assert that they were able to review these reports in order to verify the accuracy of this accusation for the very first time after the Respondent submitted them as evidence in this arbitration.197 The Claimants also note that the National Railway Company (ENFE) mentioned in the Decree has not been operative since 1996 and could therefore not possibly have been involved in any transport of ulexite by NMM.\n\nExh. CD-50.\n\nTr., Day 1, 39:7-17.\n\n182.\n\nFinally, the Claimants argue that Bolivia itself recognizes that the revocation of the concessions was unlawful: the 2004 Inter-Ministerial Memo acknowledged that \"the Mining Code makes no provisions for the revocation of mining concessions.\"198 This is why President Rodr\u00edguez revoked the Revocation Decree in December 2005.199\n\nExh. CD-68, Tribunal's translation.\n\nExh. CD-74.\n\n*(b) The Revocation Decree discriminated against the Claimants*\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\n183.\n\nThe Claimants contend that the Revocation Decree and *ex post* annulment of the concessions discriminated NMM on the basis of the Chilean nationality of its majority shareholder, Quiborax, \"at a time of resurfacing anti-Chilean sentiments.\"200\n\nMem., \u00b6 175. The Tribunal has taken into account the Claimants' position on discrimination regarding both the expropriation and the FET claims.\n\n184.\n\nOther foreign investors operating within the Salar de Uyuni were spared from the effects of the Law 2546 and other concessionaires subjected to the same audit proceedings were not deprived of their investments. While they recognize that \"[t]he auditing procedures in and of themselves did not discriminate against NMM,\"201 the Claimants argue that the Revocation Decree singled out NMM among all other mining companies similar to NMM, but for NMM's Chilean connection. Copla and Tecno Qu\u00edmica, both Bolivian owned companies, exploited concessions in the Salar de Uyuni, as did NMM. Both were fined for alleged discrepancies in their customs declarations, as was NMM. Copla obtained and lost its environmental license, just like NMM. But only NMM lost its concessions.202\n\nReply, \u00b6 174; Tr., Day 1, 39:22-23.\n\n*See* COSS, slides 35 and 36; Tr., Day 1, 40:9-41:24.\n\n185.\n\nContrary to Bolivia's contention, the Claimants argue that they are not required to prove that the contested measures were driven by a discriminatory intent. Nevertheless, the Claimants interpret the Bolivian government's analysis of possible defense strategies in the 2004 Inter-Ministerial Memo as sufficient proof of the State's intent to sacrifice the interests of the Claimants for political gain, showing that the actions of the central government against the Claimants were motivated by political calculation in the context of an internal regional conflict.203\n\nExh. CD-68, p. 9.\n\n186.\n\nSimilarly, they claim that the *ex post* annulment of the concessions was motivated by the intent to avoid the application of the Bolivia-Chile BIT and the protection of the Claimants as Chilean investors.\n\n*(c) The Revocation Decree did not offer compensation*\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n187.\n\nFinally, the Claimants note that the Revocation Decree did not provide immediate, adequate and effective compensation for the revocation of the concessions. According to the Claimants, \"[t]his is not surprising, since DS 27,589 never pretended to be an expropriation but a \u2018sanction' for alleged breaches of law.\"204\n\nReply, \u00b6 232.\n\n**b. The Respondent's position**\n--------------------------------\n\n188.\n\nThe Respondent argues that its actions were legitimate and proportionate responses to the illegalities committed in relation to the mining concessions. In this context, it argues that \"the revocation and annulment of the mining concessions that were not obtained in accordance with the laws and regulations of Bolivia cannot qualify as an expropriation under the Treaty or international law\"205 (i). If the Tribunal were to find that they do qualify as an expropriation, the Respondent argues that the expropriation does not violate the BIT or international law (ii).\n\nCounter-Mem., \u00b6 175, Tribunal's translation.\n\n**i. Bolivia's measures were not an expropriation**\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n189.\n\nBolivia argues that the Revocation Decree was adopted on the basis of Law 2,564 and is not illegal. Both the Revocation Decree and the writs of annulment of the concessions \"are part of the same reaction by the State. They are legitimate acts adopted in application of Bolivian law in response to the illegalities in the [Claimants'] Mining Concessions.\"206 It adds that \"merely alleging that Bolivia has 'recognized' the illegality of DS 27,589 and that, as a consequence, this act is equivalent to an illicit expropriation of the mining concessions under the Treaty is insufficient to prove that Decree 27,589 is contrary to Bolivian law and to the BIT.\"207\n\nCounter-Mem., \u00b6 150, Tribunal's translation.\n\nCounter-Mem., \u00b6 149, Tribunal's translation (emphasis in original).\n\n190.\n\nThe Respondent contends that the enactment of the *Ley Valda* was extremely controversial. In Bolivia's view, it undeservedly benefitted certain private interests (among others, those of Mr. Moscoso) to the detriment of the general interest of the Bolivian people. The concessions were thus questioned by Bolivia from the beginning, as shown by several bills which members introduced in the national Parliament to protect the Salar.208 Law 2,564 was issued in this context.\n\nCounter-Mem., \u00b6 151.\n\n191.\n\nThe Respondent denies that the Revocation Decree qualifies as an unlawful expropriation of the Claimants' investments. Specifically, the Respondent argues:\n\na. That the Revocation Decree was issued on the basis of Law 2,564 is not in dispute. However, Law 2,564 is not illegal *per se* under international law, nor does it amount to a denial of justice. This law \"does not revert, annul or revoke the concessions. On the contrary, it provides the execution of audits to verify the existence of illegalities and the adoption of the sanctions legally established. There is no \u2018extraordinary power, vested in the Executive', but a legislative mandate to inspect the concessions [...] and, if appropriate, sanction the illegalities committed.\"209\n\nb. It is not true that the Revocation Decree did not respect the time limit set in Law 2,564. The 60-day time period provided in Law 2,564 applies to the performance of the audits specified in said law, and is not related to the exercise of the power to declare the concessions null. It is undisputed that the audits began within this 60-day time period.\n\nc. The Claimants submit no proof to support their accusation of alleged falsity in the recitals of the Revocation Decree. Bolivia has proved that (i) Mr. Moscoso was notified of the audits under Law 2,564;210 (ii) these audits were carried out,211 and (iii) the audited companies were allowed to submit documentation and disclaimers before the audits were concluded.212 The audits were not a mere pretext for annulment: other companies were audited under Law 2,564 and, when no significant breaches were found, their concessions were neither revoked nor annulled.\n\nd. The Claimants' allegations of lack of due process are unsubstantiated. The Claimants have not proved that they did not have the opportunity to challenge the revocation before an impartial judge. Indeed, they recognize that they could have made use of their rights under Bolivian law. The fact that they did not do so shows that the claims are premature (*see* Section VI.A.3 above).\n\ne. Under Bolivian law, the acts of the administration are presumed legal, unless an express judicial statement to the contrary is made.213\n\nCounter-Mem., \u00b6 158, Tribunal's translation.\n\nExh.

R-258), Tribunal's translation.\n\n192.\n\nAfter their revocation, Bolivia declared the mining concessions null and void on legal grounds. The Claimants are wrong when they state that the annulment was irregular under Bolivian law because the grounds relied upon differ from those specified in the Mining Code. The fact that the Mining Code provides two grounds for annulment214 does not exclude the application of the general regime on the annulment of administrative acts under Bolivian law and in particular the Law on General Administrative Procedure.215 The grounds for which the concessions were annulled are grounds for the annulment of any administrative act under that law.\n\nArts. 66, 17 and 18, Exh. CD-6. In accordance with Article 66 of the Mining Code, concessions can only be annulled for the causes contained in Articles 17 and 18. Article 17 of the Mining Code prohibits foreign individuals or companies from taking an economic interest in mining concessions within 50 kilometers of international frontiers. Article 18 prohibits certain public officials and their next of kin to take any kind of economic interest in mining concessions.\n\nArt. 4 g) (Exh. R-258).\n\n193.\n\nThe Respondent denies that it has recognized the illegality of the Revocation Decree by revoking it through Decree 28,527 in 2005. The Respondent contends that Decree 28,527, issued during the government of President Rodr\u00edguez, is irrelevant. Decree 28,527 is exclusively based on the Mining Code and does not even mention Law 2,564, the only legal foundation of the Revocation Decree. When Decree 28,527 refers to irreparable legal errors contained in the Revocation Decree, the reference aims at the inexistence of revocation grounds under the Mining Code; it does not consider Law 2,564, which has the same rank as the Decree. Thus, Decree 28,527 does not imply the illegality of the Revocation Decree under Bolivian law. Further, Decree 28,527 confirms the legality of the annulment of the mining concessions.216\n\nRecital No. 2 (Exh. CPM-7).\n\n194.\n\nFinally, the Respondent argues that, irrespective of the legality of the Revocation Decree, the Claimants' business model was not viable. Indeed, as a result of the export ban introduced by Decree 27,590 (the validity of which is not questioned by the Claimants), the Claimants' business model would have been substantially affected.217\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 73-75.\n\n**ii. The requirements for an unlawful expropriation are not met**\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n195.\n\nBolivia submits that, even if, *par impossible*, the Tribunal were to conclude that there was an expropriation in the present case, the Claimants have not established that such expropriation was contrary to the BIT or international law. Article VI of the BIT only prohibits unlawful expropriations and the Claimants have not shown that the requirements for an unlawful expropriation are met. Specifically:\n\na. First, the revocation and annulment were measures taken for reasons of public or national interest and in accordance with the law, as required by the BIT. The objective of these measures was to recover the mining concessions illegally granted in the area of the fiscal reserve of the Gran Salar de Uyuni to the detriment of national interests.\n\nb. Contrary to what the Claimants suggest, the unlawfulness of the deprivation of property is in dispute. Neither the recitals of Decree 28,527 nor the 2004 InterMinisterial Memo can be characterized as Bolivia's recognition of the alleged illegality of the revocation and annulment of the mining concessions. Like Decree 28,527, the 2004 Inter-Ministerial Memo is exclusively based on the Mining Code and makes no reference to Law 2,564.\n\nc. Second, there was no discrimination.218 According to Bolivia, the Claimants have failed to submit compelling evidence to support their claim that the revocation and annulment of the concessions was motivated by the investor's Chilean nationality. In particular, the Claimants have failed to show that other similar cases were treated in a different way without a reasonable justification.219 To the contrary, the record shows that the Claimants were treated in the same manner as the rest of the mining concessionaires in the Salar de Uyuni. All of the companies that were granted concessions under the *Ley Valda* were subject to the same auditing procedures in accordance with Article 3 of Law 2,564.220 Additionally, no distinction was made in Law 2,564 between concessions owned by Chileans or by other foreigners. Likewise, the 2004 Inter-Ministerial Memo contains no indication that the revocation and annulment of the mining concessions were motivated by a desire to harm the investor by reason of its nationality. As summarized by the Respondent:\n\nLaw 2,564 was applied to all of the concessions granted within the fiscal reserve area of the Salar de Uyuni. It was not, therefore, a measure \"focused\" on the Claimants or motivated by an alleged \"anti-Chilean sentiment.\" If the revocation and annulment following the audits only affected the [Claimants'] Mining Concessions that is because their factual circumstances were unique.221\n\nd. Finally, Bolivia has not breached the obligation to compensate for an expropriation under the Treaty, for two reasons (already discussed): (i) the concessions were obtained illegally, and (ii) the Claimants' claim is premature.\n\nThe Tribunal has taken into account Bolivia's position on discrimination regarding both the expropriation and the FET claim.\n\n*Saluka Investments BV (Netherlands) v. Czech Republic*, UNCITRAL (\" *Saluka v. Czech Republic* \"), Partial Award of 17 March 2006, \u00b6 313: \"State conduct is discriminatory, if (i) similar cases are (ii) treated differently (iii) and without reasonable justification\" (Exh. R-176).\n\nExh. CD-39.\n\nCounter-Mem., \u00b6 184, Tribunal's translation (emphasis in original).\n\n**c. Analysis**\n---------------\n\n196.\n\nArt. VI.1 of the BIT provides:\n\n1. Neither of the Contracting Parties shall take measures depriving, directly or indirectly, an investor of the other Contracting Party of its investment unless the following conditions are met:\n\na) the measures are taken for reasons of public purpose or national interest and in accordance with the law;\n\nb) the measures are not discriminatory;\n\nc) the measures are accompanied by provisions for payment of immediate, adequate and effective compensation.\n\n197.\n\nThe Claimants contend that the Revocation Decree effected a direct expropriation of NMM's investments in Bolivia. Although they did not reassert this claim in the latter part of the proceedings (*see* paragraphs 162-163 above), they also argued that the Revocation Decree resulted in an indirect expropriation of Quiborax's investments in Bolivia.\n\n198.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, it is the Revocation Decree that constituted the expropriatory act because that is the measure that deprived them permanently of their investments. The subsequent annulment of the concessions is not part of the *iter expropiatorio*, say the Claimants. Bolivia could not take a second time what it had already taken. Nor do the writs of annulment constitute the culmination of a creeping expropriation, when the Revocation Decree qualified as a direct expropriation. The Tribunal will therefore focus on whether the Revocation Decree was an expropriatory measure.\n\n199.\n\nThe Tribunal will first address whether the disputed measure qualifies as a direct expropriation of NMM's investments and/or as an indirect expropriation of Quiborax's investments. In the affirmative, it will assess whether such expropriation(s) were unlawful.\n\n**i. Was there a direct expropriation of the Claimants' investments?**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n200.\n\nThe tribunal in *Burlington* which the Claimants cite, articulated the standard for a direct expropriation as follows: \"a State measure constitutes expropriation under the Treaty if (i) the measure deprives the investor of its investment; (ii) the deprivation is permanent; and (iii) the deprivation finds no justification under the police powers doctrine.\"222 This Tribunal agrees with this enunciation of the relevant standard. Tribunals dealing with direct expropriations have emphasized the need for a deprivation of property which must amount to a forcible taking or transfer to the State,223 and its permanent nature.224 Case law also insists on the fact that the taking must not qualify as the legitimate exercise of the State's police powers.225 The Tribunal will start by reviewing the third component of this standard before addressing the other two.\n\n*Burlington v. Ecuador*, Decision on Liability, \u00b6 506.\n\n*See also* *LG&E Energy Corp., LG&E Capital Corp. and LG&E International Inc. v. Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/02/1 (\" *LG&E v.

Dolzer and C. Schreuer, Principles of International Investment Law (2008), p. 92 (\"The difference between a direct and formal expropriation and an indirect expropriation turns on whether the legal title of the owner is affected by the measure in question.\")\n\nAlthough the requirement of permanence has been addressed mostly in the context of indirect expropriations, its rationale also applies to direct expropriations. *See, e.g.*, *LG&E v. Argentina*, Decision on Liability of 3 October 2006, \u00b6 193 (\"Generally, the expropriation must be permanent, that is to say, it cannot have a temporary nature, unless the investment's successful development depends on the realization of certain activities at specific moments that may not endure variations\"); *Fireman's Fund Insurance Company v. United Mexican States*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/02/01, Award of 17 July 2006, \u00b6 176(d) (holding that one of the elements of an expropriation is that \"[t]he taking must be permanent, and not ephemeral or temporary\").\n\n*See* Section (a) below.\n\n*(a) Does the deprivation find a justification under the police powers doctrine?*\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n201.\n\nThe Respondent argues that the Revocation Decree was a legitimate and proportionate response to the illegalities in the Claimants' concessions and therefore cannot qualify as an expropriation. The Respondent claims that \"direct expropriation is a concept, revocation is another concept,\" and that \"Decree 27,589 is clearly an act of revocation and it can in no way be deemed as an act of direct expropriation.\"226 The Tribunal understands that the Respondent's argument is that the measures taken by Bolivia are sanctions imposed upon the Claimants in the legitimate exercise of the State's police powers, and as such are not a compensable taking under international law.\n\nTr., Day 1, 133:13-14 and 135:6-7; ROSS, slide 54.\n\n202.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees with the Respondent that, if the Revocation Decree was the legitimate exercise of its sovereign right to sanction violations of the law in its territory, it would not qualify as a compensable taking. International law has generally understood that regulatory activity exercised under the so-called \"police powers\" of the State is not compensable. In this regard, Comment (g) to \u00a7712 of the American Law Institute's *Restatement (Third) of the Foreign Relations Law* provides:\n\nA state is not responsible for loss of property or for other economic disadvantage resulting from bona fide general taxation, regulation, forfeiture for crime, or other action of the kind that is commonly accepted as within the police power of states, if it is not discriminatory, [...] and is not designed to cause the alien to abandon the property to the state or sell it at a distress price.227\n\nRestatement (Third) of The Foreign Relations Law (1986), \u00a7 712(g).\n\n203.\n\nThe Reporters' Note 6 to \u00a7712 of the *Restatement* adds:\n\n\"It is often necessary to determine, in the light of all the circumstances, whether an action by a state constitutes a taking and requires compensation under international law, or is a police power regulation or tax that does not give rise to an obligation to compensate, even though a foreign national suffers loss as a consequence.\n\n204.\n\nThe tribunal in *Tecmed* confirmed this approach by holding that\n\n[t]he principle that the State's exercise of its sovereign powers within the framework of its police power may cause economic damage to those subject to its powers as administrator without entitling them to any compensation whatsoever is undisputable.228\n\n*Tecmed v. Mexico*, Award of 29 May 2003, \u00b6119.\n\n205.\n\nSimilarly, the tribunal in *CME v. Czech Republic* noted that \"deprivation of property and/or rights must be distinguished from ordinary measures of the State and its agencies in proper execution of the law. Regulatory measures are common in all types of legal and economic systems in order to avoid use of private property contrary to the general welfare of the (host) State.\"229\n\n*CME Czech Republic B.V. v. Czech Republic*, UNCITRAL, Partial Award of 13 September 2001, \u00b6 603.\n\n206.\n\nThis is particularly true in the case of rights of exploitation (such as licenses or concessions) that depend on the fulfillment of certain requirements by the foreign investor. If a State cancels a license or a concession because the investor has not fulfilled the necessary legal requirements to maintain that license or concession, or has breached the relevant laws and regulations that are sanctioned by the loss of those rights, such cancellation cannot be considered to be a taking by the State.230\n\n*See, e.g., Genin v. Estonia,* Award of 25 June 2001, \u00b6\u00b6 348-373 (holding that the cancellation of a banking license resulting from the legitimate exercise of the State's regulatory and supervisory functions cannot be regarded as a breach of the relevant treaty or international law). *See also* *Swisslion DOO Skopje v. The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia*, ICSID Case No. ARB/09/16, Award of 6 July 2012, \u00b6\u00b6 312-314 (holding that a court's confirmation that a contract had been legitimately terminated due to non-compliance by the investor was not an expropriation: \"The internationally lawful termination of a contract between a State entity and an investor cannot be equated to an expropriation of contractual rights simply because the investor's rights have been terminated [...]\").\n\n207.\n\nThe Tribunal must thus consider whether, in light of all the circumstances, the Revocation Decree was a legitimate cancellation of the Claimants' concessions in the exercise of Bolivia's sovereign power to sanction violations of Bolivian law and is therefore not a compensable taking or whether it is a veritable taking disguised as the exercise of the State's police powers. This will depend on whether (i) the Revocation Decree is based on actual violations of Bolivian law by the Claimants; (ii) whether those violations of Bolivian law are sanctioned with the termination of the concessions (whether by revocation, cancellation, annulment or otherwise), and (iii) whether the revocation was carried out in accordance with due process.231\n\n*Metalclad v. Mexico,* Award of 30 August 2000, \u00b6\u00b6 106-107 (\"[T]he Municipality's denial of the construction permit without any basis in the proposed physical construction or any defect in the site, and extended by its subsequent administrative and judicial actions regarding the Convenio, effectively and unlawfully prevented the Claimant's operation of the landfill. These measures, taken together with the representations of the Mexican federal government, on which Metalclad relied, and the absence of a timely, orderly or substantive basis for the denial by the Municipality of the local construction permit, amount to an indirect expropriation\").\n\n208.\n\nThe Revocation Decree issued by the President of Bolivia, Mr. Carlos Mesa, reads as follows:\n\nWHEREAS:\n\nMining Company Non Metallic Minerales [sic] S.A., which operates the mining concessions object of the present Supreme Decree, has systematically refused to provide information both to the National Tax Service and to the National Customs, thus preventing the audits mandated by Law No. 2,564 of 9 December 2003.\n\nIt has been shown that the exports of ulexite minerals declared by Mining Company Non Metallic Minerales [sic] S.A. do not match the cargo volumes transported by the National Railways Company - ENFE, as shown in the audit performed by SERGEOMIN and COMIBOL of February 2004 and the Preliminary Report of the Revenue Service.\n\nThese facts evidence economic damage to the State, contravening, in addition, provisions of the Tax Code currently in force, in compliance with the provisions of the Law of the Public Reserve of the *Gran Salar de Uyuni.*\n\nTHE CABINET COUNCIL\n\nDECREES:\n\nSOLE ARTICLE.- I. The revocation of the constitutive resolutions and loss of the mining concessions Cancha I, Do\u00f1a Juanita, Tete, Borateras de Cuevitas, Basilea, Inglaterra, Don David, Sur, Pococho, La Negra, Cancha II, located at the R\u00edo Grande Delta of the Gran Salar de Uyuni, Nor Lipez Province of the Region of Potos\u00ed, is hereby ordered.\n\nII. Mining Company Non Metallic Minerales [sic] S.A., which operates the abovementioned concessions, is granted a period of thirty days to physically hand over the concessions to the Prefecture of the Potos\u00ed Region, without prejudice to the criminal and civil actions that may be appropriate.\n\nIII. All provisions contrary to the present Supreme Decree are abrogated and derogated.232\n\nExh. CD-50, Tribunal's translation (*see* note 38 for Spanish original).\n\n209.\n\nAccordingly, the Revocation Decree is grounded on two alleged violations:\n\na. A systematic refusal to provide information to the National Tax Service and the National Customs Service, thus preventing the audits mandated by Law 2,564 of 9 December 2003;\n\nb. Discrepancies in the amount of ulexite declared and actually transported in violation of the Tax Code.\n\n210.\n\nWith respect to (a), as discussed further below, the record shows that the Claimants were not notified and thus could not participate in the audits mandated by Law 2,564 before the revocation. There is one document that suggests that the Claimants participated in the customs audit, but this was six months after the revocation. The first ground invoked by the Revocation Decree is therefore not supported by the facts.\n\n211.\n\nWith respect to (b), neither the SERGEOMIN-COMIBOL report nor the report of the Customs Service concluded that there were discrepancies in the amount of ulexite declared and exported. Hence, the second ground invoked by the Revocation Decree is not supported by the facts either.\n\n212.\n\nEven if NMM had failed to provide information to the tax and customs services and even if there had been discrepancies in the amounts of ulexite declared and exported, the Respondent has not directed the Tribunal to a single provision of Bolivian law that could justify the revocation of the concessions on such grounds.\n\n213.\n\nIt is true that the Respondent has relied on Law 2,564. However, such reliance appears misconceived. As the Respondent itself acknowledges, Law 2,564 \"requires the performance of audits to verify the existence of illegalities and apply the sanctions provided by the law. There is no \u2018extraordinary power, vested in the Executive', but a legislative mandate to inspect the concessions [\u2026] and, ***if appropriate***, sanction any illegalities committed.\"233 The text of Article 3 of Law 2,564 confirms this understanding:\n\nThe Executive Power is authorized, after the evaluation of audits, technical, legal, economic and financial, tax, social and labor legislation and environmental and ecological preservation, to declare null the concessionaires' mining rights ***that are liable to sanctions provided by the Laws and regulations in force***, within a deadline of 60 days calculated from the enactment of this Law, with the subsequent recovery of such concessions and non-metallic resources originally belonging to the State.234\n\nOr, in the original Spanish text:\n\nFacultase al Poder Ejecutivo, luego de la evaluaci\u00f3n de auditor\u00edas, t\u00e9cnica, jur\u00eddico legal, econ\u00f3mico financiera, regalitario - tributaria, legislaci\u00f3n sociolaboral y preservaci\u00f3n ecol\u00f3gica y medioambiental, a declarar la nulidad de los derechos concesionarios mineros que, ***sean pasibles a sanciones establecidas por las Leyes y disposiciones vigentes***, en un plazo perentorio de 60 d\u00edas a computar a partir de la promulgaci\u00f3n de la presente Ley, con la consiguiente recuperaci\u00f3n de tales concesiones y recursos no met\u00e1licos a propiedad originaria del Estado.\n\nCounter-Mem., \u00b6 158., Tribunal's translation (emphasis added by the Tribunal). The original Spanish text reads as follows: \"El art\u00edculo 3 de la Ley 2564 no revierte, anula o revoca concesiones. Por el contrario, prev\u00e9 la realizaci\u00f3n de auditor\u00edas para verificar la existencia de ilegalidades y adoptar las sanciones previstas legalmente. No se trata de un \" *extraordinary power, vested in the Executive*,\" sino de un mandato legislativo para fiscalizar las concesiones (cuya regularidad fue, de hecho, cuestionada desde su origen) y, en su caso, sancionar las ilegalidades cometidas.\" Footnotes omitted.\n\nExh. CD-39, Tribunal's translation (emphasis added by the Tribunal).\n\n214.\n\nIn the Tribunal's understanding, Law 2,564 did not provide a blanket authorization to the Executive to annul concessions if the audits verified the existence of any breaches of Bolivian law. It only allowed the Executive to annul concessions if the audits established breaches that were sanctioned by nullity pursuant to the laws and regulations in force. As the Revocation Decree determines the termination of the concessions for alleged violations of Bolivian law that do not appear to be sanctioned with termination under that law (at least the Respondent has not proved that this was the case), the Tribunal cannot but conclude that the Revocation Decree finds no justification in Bolivian law.\n\n215.\n\nBolivian government officials appear to have shared this view. For instance, a report issued by Ministry of Mining made the following comment on the audits mandated by Law 2,564:\n\nIt is necessary to clarify that all of the conclusions and recommendations reached by the abovementioned audits, will identify breaches that might have been committed by the mining concessionaires of the area in question, reparable breaches that do not necessarily identify grounds to annul the concessions.235\n\nExh. CD-65, Tribunal's translation.\n\n216.\n\nThe government that took power after the issuance of the Revocation Decree also concluded that the latter did not comply with Bolivian law, although on more formal grounds. Indeed, on 16 December 2005, President Rodr\u00edguez issued Supreme Decree 28,527, which abrogated the Revocation Decree as a result of \"irreparable legal defects,\" namely the fact that the Mining Code did not provide for the \"revocation\" of mining concessions, but rather their *caducidad* or annulment.236\n\nExh. CD-74, *see* \u00b6 34 above. (\"[The Revocation Decree] suffers from irreparable legal defects because the Mining Code does not provide in any of its legal provisions for the revocation of mining concessions, but provides rather for the legal figures of *caducidad* or annulment of mining concessions after an administrative proceeding under the competence and jurisdiction of the Superintendence of Mines,\" Tribunal's translation)).\n\n217.\n\nEven if Law 2,564 did intend to provide a blanket authorization, the revocation of the concessions on the grounds cited in the Revocation Decree appears unjustified on the facts, for the reasons set out in paragraphs 210 and 211 above.\n\n218.\n\nIn addition, although the Tribunal does not attach decisive weight to this circumstance because of its formalistic nature, it notes that the Revocation Decree did not meet the time limit set in Law 2,564. Article 3 of Law 2,564 provided that the Executive was authorized to annul the concessions \"within a deadline of 60 days calculated from the enactment of this Law\" (\" *en un plazo perentorio de 60 d\u00edas a computar a partir de la promulgaci\u00f3n de la presente Ley* \"). It is undisputed that the Revocation Decree was issued on 23 July 2004, more than 60 days from the enactment of Law 2,564 on 9 December 2003.\n\n219.\n\nOther than the tax and customs violations allegedly identified in the audits, which the Tribunal has addressed above, the Respondent has also submitted that the illegalities brought to light in the audits include breaches in matters of industrial safety, environment and labor, as well as a lack of mining certificates.237 Bolivia relies on the technical audit report to support its allegation.238 Having reviewed this report, the Tribunal concludes that the irregularities identified therein were minor breaches of law. Indeed, Bolivia has not pointed to any legislative or regulatory provision that would trigger the termination of concessions on these grounds. Thus, to the extent relevant at all in light of the reasons stated in the Revocation Decree,239 the Tribunal finds that they could not have served as basis for the revocation of the concessions.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 58.\n\nExh. R-261.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that these non-compliances were not invoked in the Revocation Decree.\n\n220.\n\nIn addition, although the Claimants acknowledge that on the date of the revocation none of the concessions had environmental licenses, Bolivia has not established that a lack of environmental licenses would warrant the termination of the concessions. The concession of Borateras de Cuevitas had previously been granted an environmental license, but this license was revoked by an administrative resolution one day before the Revocation Decree was enacted;240 that revocation seemed to respond to pressure of the local community rather than breaches of the law by NMM.241\n\nExh. CD-173.\n\n*See* Section iii.(b) below.\n\n221.\n\nFinally, the Tribunal finds that the revocation of the Claimants' concessions did not comply with minimum standards of due process, whether under international law or Bolivian law. The standard of due process under international law, and more specifically in the expropriation context, has been summarized in *ADC* v. *Hungary* as demanding \"an actual and substantive legal procedure for a foreign investor to raise its claims against the depriving actions already taken or about to be taken against it.\"242\n\n*ADC v. Hungary*, Award of 2 October 2006, \u00b6 435. The tribunal in *ADC* continues explaining:  \n Some basic legal mechanisms, such as reasonable advance notice, a fair hearing and an unbiased and impartial adjudicator to assess the actions in dispute, are expected to be readily available and accessible to the investor to make such legal procedure meaningful. In general, the legal procedure must be of a nature to grant an affected investor a reasonable chance within a reasonable time to claim its legitimate rights and have its claims heard.  \n*See also* *Ioannis Kardassopoulos v. Georgia*, ICSID Case No. ARB/05/18, Award of 3 March 2010, \u00b6\u00b6 395, 396, 404). *See also* *AIG Capital Partners, Inc. and CJSC Tema Real Estate Company v. Republic of Kazakhstan*, ICSID Case No. ARB/01/6, Award of 7 October 2003, \u00b6 10.5.1 (\"Expropriation of alien property is not itself contrary to international law provided certain conditions are met, and perhaps the most clearly established condition is that expropriation must not be arbitrary (*i.e.*, must not be contrary to \"the due process of law\") and must be based on the application of duly adopted laws. [\u2026] The requirement that expropriation should be in a non-discriminatory manner (*i.e.*, as between alien and national) and in accordance with due process is also widely accepted, and is relevant to the assessment whether the expropriation was or was not arbitrary and in furtherance of the public interest.\").\n\n222.\n\nBolivian law also establishes certain basic procedural guarantees that must be respected in judicial and administrative proceedings. In particular, Article 16 of the Law on General Administrative Procedure243 establishes the right (i) to participate in an ongoing proceeding whenever the individual's legitimate interests are concerned; (ii) to be informed of the status of a proceeding to which he or she is a party; (iii) to submit allegations and evidence; (iv) to receive a reasoned response to any request or application; (v) to demand that the terms and time limits of the proceedings be respected; and (vi) to be treated with dignity, respect, equality and without discrimination.244\n\nExh. R-258.\n\n*See also* Arts. 4.g, 33, 46, 47, 54 and 70.\n\n223.\n\nThe auditing procedures that were the basis for the Revocation Decree failed many of these requirements. Although the final report of the customs authorities (*Informe Final de Fiscalizaci\u00f3n Aduanera Posterior a la empresa Non Metallic Minerals S.A.* of 18 February 2005245) suggests that NMM was notified of and participated in the customs audit, the report states that NMM was notified of the initiation of the audit on 22 June 2004 (*i.e.*, the day before the concessions were revoked).246 The Claimants have denied that this notification took place, but even if it had, it would not have allowed the Claimants to participate in the audit prior to the revocation of the concessions. The final report also suggests that NMM was notified of the issuance of the Preliminary Report on 28 December 2004,247 (six months *after* NMM's concessions were revoked), and that NMM's defense memorial (\" *memorial de descargos* \"248) was submitted on 28 January 2005, long after the concessions were revoked. As a result, NMM's alleged notification and participation in the audit does not show that due process was respected in the revocation of the concessions.\n\nExh. R-270, pp. 56 et seq.\n\nExh. R-270, p. 56.\n\nExh. R-270, p. 58.\n\nExh. R-270, p. 58.\n\n224.\n\nThere is no other evidence in the record showing that the Claimants were notified of the audits. Relying on Exh. R-266, the Respondent, claims that Mr. David Moscoso was notified of the audits under Law 2,564. Having examined the notification contained in Exh. R-266, the Tribunal observes that it is a certificate issued by the Superintendence of Mines of Tupiza-Tarija that indicates that certain copies have been handed over to a Ms. Ludy Moscoso, a consultant of the Prefect of Potos\u00ed (unrelated to Mr. David Moscoso). There is no indication that the copies are meant for an audit, nor is the document signed by any person related to NMM.\n\n225.\n\nThe record also shows that the Claimants unsuccessfully attempted to obtain information on the audits. Exh. CD-56 contains several letters between mid-June to end of July 2004 from NMM to *Corporaci\u00f3n Minera de Bolivia* (COMIBOL), *Servicio Geol\u00f3gico Minero* (SERGEOMIN), *Empresa Nacional de Ferrocarriles* (ENFE) and the National Customs of Bolivia. In those letters, NMM refers to the Revocation Decree and the audits carried out under Law 2,564 and requests that the reports be sent to NMM together with the legalized copies of the notifications informing NMM of the audits and requesting information.249 Apart from a reply from COMIBOL directing NMM to the Vice Ministry of Mining250 (from which the record contains no answer) there does not appear to have been any response to NMM's reiterated requests.\n\nExhs.

CD-56-H.\n\n226.\n\nOnce the audits were concluded, the Claimants contend that they were not given the opportunity to challenge their findings due to the fact that \"Law 2,564 does not provide for any kind of appeal against the outcome of the audits or the annulment decision.\"251 As the Respondent has noted, Bolivian law provides for several constitutional or administrative actions252 that the Claimants may have attempted. That being said, the availability of domestic actions to challenge the Revocation Decree does not change the Tribunal's conclusion that the revocation did not comply with due process, the determinative factors being that the Claimants were not heard during the audits and that the revocation lacked valid reasons.\n\nReply, \u00b6 133.\n\nROSS, slide 30.\n\n227.\n\nAs a result, the Tribunal finds that the Revocation Decree was not a legitimate exercise of Bolivia's police powers. It will therefore proceed to review whether the remaining requirements for a direct expropriation are fulfilled, namely the Claimants are deprived of their investment (b), and whether the deprivation was permanent (c).\n\n*(b) Did the Revocation Decree deprive NMM of its investment?*\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n228.\n\nAs noted above, for a direct expropriation to occur, there must be a forcible taking or transfer of title to the State that deprives the investor of its investment.253\n\n*See* \u00b6 200 above.\n\n229.\n\nHere, it is undisputed that the Revocation Decree had the effect of transferring the title of NMM's mining concessions to the State. The Decree clearly orders (\" *dispone* \") the revocation of the constitutive resolutions of NMM's mining concessions, as well as their loss (\" *p\u00e9rdida* \"), directing NMM to physically hand over the concessions to the Prefecture of the Potos\u00ed Region within thirty days.\n\n230.\n\nIn compliance with this clear order, issued by the President of Bolivia himself, it is undisputed that NMM returned its concessions to Bolivia on 23 July 2004. In the Tribunal's view, this amounts to a deprivation of NMM's investments in Bolivia.\n\n231.\n\nThe fact that NMM exported ulexite that had previously been extracted until 23 September 2004 does not change this conclusion. What gave value to the investment were the concessions; without them, the investment was lost in its entirety. The fact that some product of the investment was still sold may reduce the damage, but cannot undo the economic deprivation of the investment.\n\n232.\n\nNor does the introduction of an export ban by Decree 27,590 on the day of the Revocation Decree change the fact of the deprivation. That export ban, which came into force 90 days after its enactment (*i.e.*, on 21 September 2004), did indeed prohibit exports of non metallic minerals, such as unprocessed boron and unprocessed or partly processed ulexite.254 However, Decree 27,590 was revoked in October 2004 through Decree 27,799, as a result of which the export ban was lifted.255 The Respondent argued during the hearing that Decree 27,799 was in turn revoked in 2008, but did not submit evidence to support this assertion.256 In any event, the Claimants have shown that there were significant exports of ulexite from Bolivia to Brazil between 2003 and 2012,257 which shows that there was no effective export ban in place during those years.\n\nArticles 1 and 2, Exh. CD-51.\n\nExh. CD-195.\n\nTr., Day 1, 12-15.\n\nExh. CD-196.\n\n*(c) Was the deprivation permanent?*\n------------------------------------\n\n233.\n\nFinally, the Tribunal must determine if the deprivation had permanent effects. It is undisputed that, after NMM returned the concessions to Bolivia on 23 July 2004, it never again exploited those concessions. Indeed, subsequent acts by Bolivia confirmed that deprivation. On 28 October 2004, the concessions that had already been \"revoked\" were also \"annulled.\" Decree 28,527, which revoked the revocation about a year and a half thereafter in December 2005, did not undo the deprivation. To the contrary, Decree 28,527 expressly recognized that the concessions were annulled and the writs of annulment were definitive.258\n\nExh. CD-74 (\"Considerando [...] Que las Resoluciones Administrativas dictadas por la Superintendencia de Minas anulan las resoluciones constitutivas de las concesiones mineras de la Empresa Non Metallic Minerals S.A. y en la actualidad se encuentran ejecutoriadas y causan estado\").\n\n234.\n\nHence, the date on which NMM was deprived of the economic benefits of its concessions was 23 July 2004. In the Tribunal's view, this is the date of the expropriation, as this was the date on which due to the governmental interference the legal and economic use of the concessions was definitively lost.\n\n**ii. Was there an indirect expropriation of Quiborax's investment?**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n235.\n\nIn their Memorial, the Claimants argued that, as a consequence of the expropriation of NMM's concessions, Quiborax's shares in NMM became worthless overnight. As a result, although Quiborax is still nominally the owner of approximately 51% of NMM's shares, it has lost the economic use and enjoyment of its investments. For the Claimants, this had the effect of depriving Quiborax of its property in a manner equivalent to an expropriation, thus constituting an indirect expropriation.259\n\nMem., \u00b6\u00b6 137-141.\n\n236.\n\nThe Claimants did not repeat this claim in their Reply or during the hearing. As a result of this silence, the Respondent argued that the Claimants had not advanced a claim for indirect expropriation.260 The Claimants did not rebut these assertions; neither did they expressly withdraw their indirect expropriation claim. At the hearing, they mentioned that their written submissions were reiterated even if not expressly repeated orally.261 The Tribunal thus understands that the claim for indirect expropriation has not been withdrawn and will address it here.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 71-72; Tr., Day 1, 131-132; Tr., Day 3, 88.\n\nTr., Day 3, 51.\n\n237.\n\nIt is undisputed that expropriation does not need refer solely to the overt taking of a physical asset or formal transfer of title (direct expropriation). Measures other than actual takings or formal transfers of title may amount to indirect expropriation or measures tantamount to expropriation. This is expressly recognized in Article VI of the BIT and has been accepted by numerous tribunals.262\n\n*See, e.g.*, *Tippetts, Abbett, McCarthy, Stratton v. TAMS-AFFA*, 6 Iran-US CTR, Award of 22 June 1984, at 225; *Starrett Housing v. Iran,* 16 Iran-US CTR, Award of 14 August 1987, p. 154; *Metalclad v. Mexico,* Award of 30 August 2000, \u00b6 103; *Glamis Gold, Ltd. v. The United States of America,* UNCITRAL, Award of 8 June 2009, \u00b6 355; *Tecmed v. Mexico,* Award of 29 May 2003, \u00b6\u00b6 113-114.\n\n238.\n\nFor an indirect expropriation to exist, it is generally accepted that the State measure must have the effect of substantially depriving the investor of the economic value of its investment. For instance, the *Pope & Talbot* tribunal considered \"whether [the State's] interference is sufficiently restrictive to support a conclusion that the property has been \u2018taken' from its owner,\" adding that \"under international law, expropriation requires a \u2018substantial deprivation.\"263 Similarly, according to the first *Occidental* tribunal, the question is whether there has been a \"substantial deprivation\" of \"the use of reasonably expected economic benefit of the investment.\"264 In addition, as noted in *Burlington*, the deprivation must be permanent and must not be justified by the police powers doctrine.265\n\n*Pope & Talbot Inc. v. The Government of Canada*, UNCITRAL, Interim Award of 26 June 2000, \u00b6 102.\n\n*Occidental Exploration and Production Company v. The Republic of Ecuador (\"Occidental v. Ecuador I\"),* LCIA Case No. UN3467, Award of 1 July 2004, \u00b6 89.\n\n*Burlington v. Ecuador*, Decision on Liability, \u00b6\u00b6 471-473.\n\n239.\n\nQuiborax qualifying as an investor holding an investment under the BIT,266 the question is thus whether the revocation of the concessions had the effect of substantially depriving Quiborax of the value of its investment in Bolivia, *i.e.*, of its shares in NMM. Although the Claimants have not submitted proof of that diminution in value, the Tribunal agrees that, in the absence of the concessions, which were NMM's *raison d'\u00eatre*, the Claimants' investment in NMM was virtually worthless. Indeed, NMM has been repeatedly described by the Claimants as Quiborax's investment vehicle,267 and appears to have no other business than the concessions.268 The Tribunal has already determined that this deprivation was permanent and was not justified by the police powers doctrine. Accordingly, the Tribunal finds that the revocation of the concessions indirectly expropriated Quiborax of the value of its investments.\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 192, 196, 210, 237, 282.\n\nMem., \u00b6\u00b6 1, 67, 106, 109.\n\n*See* NMM's financial statements for the years 2003 and 2004 (Exh. NCI-62), which show that virtually all of NMM's assets related to the exploitation of the concessions.\n\n**iii. Was the expropriation unlawful under the BIT?**\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n240.\n\nHaving concluded that Bolivia expropriated the NMM's investment, the Tribunal will now determine whether the expropriation complied with the requirements of Article IV(1) of the BIT or, in other words, whether it was a lawful or an unlawful expropriation. Article IV(1) of the BIT provides:\n\nExpropriation and compensation\n\n1. Neither of the Contracting Parties will take measures that deprive, directly or indirectly, an investor of the other Contracting Party of its investment unless the following conditions are met:\n\na. the measures are adopted for the public or national interest and in accordance with the law;\n\nb. the measures are not discriminatory;\n\nc. the measures are accompanied by provisions for the payment of an immediate, sufficient and effective compensation.\n\n(Tribunal's translation)\n\n241.\n\nOr, in the original Spanish text:\n\nExpropiaci\u00f3n y compensaci\u00f3n\n\n1. Ninguna de las Partes Contratantes adoptar\u00e1 medidas que priven, directa o indirectamente, a un inversionista de la otra Parte Contratante, de su inversi\u00f3n, a menos que se cumplan los siguientes requisitos:\n\na. las medidas se adopten por causa de utilidad p\u00fablica o inter\u00e9s nacional y de conformidad con la ley;\n\nb. las medidas no sean discriminatorias;\n\nc. las medidas vayan acompa\u00f1adas de disposiciones para el pago de una compensaci\u00f3n inmediata, suficiente y efectiva.\n\n242.\n\nAccordingly, the Tribunal will assess whether the expropriation served the public or national interest and was in accordance with the law (a), whether the measure discriminated against NMM (b), and whether the expropriation was accompanied by the appropriate compensation (c). The Tribunal will then reach its conclusion on the legality of the expropriation (d).\n\n*(a) Did the expropriatory measure serve the public or national interest? Was it in accordance with the law?*\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n243.\n\nThe Tribunal has found that the Revocation Decree was not a legitimate exercise of Bolivia's police powers. That does not necessarily prevent the possibility that the motive for which it was issued was in the public or national interest.\n\n244.\n\nBolivia argues that the revocation and annulment of the concessions were measures adopted \"for the public or national interest and in accordance with the law,\" as required by the BIT. Specifically, the purpose of these measures (which were in accordance with Bolivian law) was to recover concessions granted illegally in the Gran Salar de Uyuni Fiscal Reserve.269 They were based on the national interest of the State to protect the Gran Salar de Uyuni Fiscal Reserve.270\n\nCounter-Mem., \u00b6 182, Tribunal's translation.\n\nCounter Mem., \u00b6 98\n\n245.\n\nThe Tribunal defers to Bolivia's sovereign right to determine what is in the national and public interest. It accepts that Bolivia may have had a legitimate interest in protecting the Gran Salar de Uyuni Fiscal Reserve. That being said, the Tribunal has already determined that the revocation was not carried out in accordance with Bolivian law, whether as a matter of substance or procedure (*see* Section (i) above). Hence, even if the expropriation was in the national or public interest, it was not carried out in accordance with the law, as Article IV of the BIT requires. The Tribunal cannot but conclude that the expropriation was unlawful in this regard.\n\n*(b) Was the expropriatory measure discriminatory?*\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n246.\n\nThe Claimants allege that the Revocation Decree discriminated NMM on the basis of the Chilean nationality of its majority shareholder, Quiborax. Bolivia claims that the Revocation Decree was not discriminatory and describes it as a fair, reasonable and proportional act, stressing that there is \"no evidence to the contrary.\"271\n\nROSS, slide 59; Tr., Day 1, 138:12-139:6.\n\n247.\n\nTo determine whether the Revocation Decree discriminated against NMM, the Tribunal will apply the three-pronged test formulated in *Saluka*, cited by the Respondent: \"State conduct is discriminatory, if (i) similar cases are (ii) treated differently (iii) and without reasonable justification.\"272 As to the third element, the Tribunal agrees with *Parkerings* that there are situations that may justify differentiated treatment, a matter to be assessed under the specific circumstances of each case.273 In this case, other mining companies operating in the R\u00edo Grande Delta were audited under Law 2,564. Other mining companies, such as Copla and Tecno Qu\u00edmica, were fined for alleged errors in their export declarations, like NMM.274 Additionally, Copla obtained and lost its environmental license at the same time as NMM. However, NMM was the only one that lost its concessions. The record thus shows that NMM received different treatment than other companies in like circumstances.\n\n*Saluka v. Czech Republic*, Partial Award of 17 March 2006, \u00b6 313. Other tribunals (whether dealing with the prohibition of discriminatory treatment, or with national treatment provisions, which prohibit nationality-based discrimination), have applied a similar standard. *See, e.g.*, *Joseph C. Lemire v. Ukraine*, ICSID Case No. ARB/06/18 (\" *Lemire v. Ukraine* \"), Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability of 21 January 2010, \u00b6 261 (footnotes omitted) (\"Discrimination, in the words of pertinent precedents, requires more than different treatment. To amount to discrimination, a case must be treated differently from similar cases without justification; a measure must be \"discriminatory and expose[s] the claimant to sectional or racial prejudice\"; or a measure must \"target[ed] [sic] Claimant's investments specifically as foreign investments\"); *Champion Trading Company and Ameritrade International, Inc. v. Arab Republic of Egypt*, ICSID Case No. ARB/02/9, Award of 27 October 2006, \u00b6 130 (\"The national treatment obligation does not generally prohibit a State from adopting measures that constitute a difference in treatment. The obligation only prohibits a State from taking measures resulting in different treatment in like circumstances\"); *Total S.A. v. Argentine Republic,* ICSID Case No. ARB/04/01 (\" *Total v. Argentina* \"), Decision on Liability of 27 December 2010, \u00b6 344 (\"This standard requires, as a rule, a comparison between the treatment of different investments, usually within a given sector, of different national origin or ownership [\u2026] The purpose is to ascertain whether the protected investments have been treated worse without any justification, specifically because of their foreign nationality. The similarity of the investments compared and of their operations is a precondition for a fruitful comparison.\").\n\n*Parkerings-Compagniet AS v. Republic of Lithuania*, ICSID Case No. ARB/05/8, Award of 11 September 2007, \u00b6 368 (\"Discrimination is to be ascertained by looking at the circumstances of the individual cases. Discrimination involves either issues of law, such as legislation affording different treatments in function of citizenship, or issues of fact where a State unduly treats differently investors who are in similar circumstances. Whether discrimination is objectionable does not in the opinion of this Tribunal depend on subjective requirements such as the bad faith or the malicious intent of the State: at least, Article IV of the Treaty does not include such requirements. However, to violate international law, discrimination must be unreasonable or lacking proportionality, for instance, it must be inapposite or excessive to achieve an otherwise legitimate objective of the State. An objective justification may justify differentiated treatments of similar cases. It would be necessary, in each case, to evaluate the exact circumstances and the context.\").\n\nExhs. R-268, R-269 and R-270.\n\n248.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, there was no reasonable justification in Bolivian law for this different treatment. This is confirmed by compelling evidence on record of a discriminatory intent showing, in particular, that the Revocation Decree targeted NMM because of the Chilean nationality of its main shareholder, Quiborax.\n\n249.\n\nIt is undisputed that the promulgation of the *Ley Valda* in April 1998 was controversial. It is also clear from the record that the local population did not welcome concessions being granted in an area that had previously been a fiscal reserve. Although there was public opposition to all concessions, the focus of the hostility was on NMM as a consequence of the Chilean nationality of its main shareholder.\n\n250.\n\nThe public opposition escalated significantly when the Claimants were granted an environmental license on 9 June 2004 to operate the concession \"Borateras de Cuevitas.\" The press articles included in the record bear witness to the upheaval caused by this license, which continued to mount until the issuance of the Revocation Decree in 23 June 2004.275 In particular:\n\na. Comcipo (*Comit\u00e9 C\u00edvico Potosinista*) had always been one of the more vocal critics of the *Ley Valda* and of the presence of Chilean companies operating in the Salar de Uyuni.276 According to the press, as a reaction to the issuance of the environmental license, it declared \"a war to death with the national authorities that make viable the exploitation of the Bolivians' natural resources for the benefit of the Chileans\"277 and demanded that an end be put to \"the surrender of the Salar de Uyuni to Chilean interests.\"278\n\nb. During several days in mid-June 2004, riots, hunger strikes and the blockade of roads and railways were the public's response to the perception that \"David Moscoso and his Chilean partners\" were looting the Salar while the State did nothing to prevent this.279 The Prefect of Potos\u00ed publicly endorsed these protests and was quoted as questioning the government's benevolence towards \"Chilean capital.\"280\n\nc. Media also reported that the region was declared in state of emergency.281\n\nExhs. CD-43, CD-45, CD-46, CD-47, CD-48, CD-49, CD-52 and CD-55.\n\nExhs. R-241 and R-242.\n\nExh. CD-43, Tribunal's translation.\n\nExh. CD-47, Tribunal's translation.\n\n*See, e.g.*, Exhs. CD-43 and CD-45.\n\nExh. CD-45.\n\nExh. CD-45.\n\n251.\n\nOn 23 June 2004, following the enactment of the Revocation Decree and the Export Ban Decree, the press reported that \"the pressure has taken effect.\"282 The revocation of the concessions was celebrated as an \"historical measure\" by which the national government \"ended the looting of ulexite that up to that date was benefiting the Chileans.\"283 Wilson Magne, a member of the Bolivian Parliament, was quoted as saying that \"the *Potosino* people achieved an overwhelming victory against the looting of our sources of wealth by Chilean companies.\"284\n\nExh. CD-49.\n\nExh. CD-55, Tribunal's translation.\n\nExh. CD-55, Tribunal's translation.\n\n252.\n\nFinally, the 2004 Inter-Ministerial Memo confirms that the Revocation Decree \"was enacted because of the social and political pressure from the authorities in Potos\u00ed and, in particular, from the town of Uyuni.\"285\n\nExh. CD-68, Tribunal's translation.\n\n253.\n\nAs stated above (*see* Section (a)), the Tribunal has no reason to doubt that Bolivia was motivated by the public or national interest. Yet, as stated in *Corn Products v. Mexico* \"[d]iscrimination does not cease to be discrimination, nor to attract the international liability stemming therefrom, because it is undertaken to achieve a laudable goal or because the achievement of that goal can be described as necessary.\"286\n\n*Corn Products International Inc. v. United Mexican States*, Decision on Responsibility of 15 January 2008, \u00b6 142.\n\n254.\n\nThe Tribunal thus finds that the expropriation was discriminatory and thus failed to meet the condition of non-discrimination for a lawful expropriation.\n\n**iv. Was the expropriatory measure without compensation?**\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n255.\n\nIt is undisputed that Bolivia neither paid nor offered compensation to NMM for the revocation of its mining concessions. The Respondent asserts that no compensation was due because there was no expropriation. However, the Tribunal has found that NMM was indeed expropriated of its investment in Bolivia. Accordingly, the expropriation also fails to meet this requirement for legality.\n\n**v. Conclusion**\n-----------------\n\n256.\n\nAs a consequence, the Tribunal concludes that NMM and Quiborax were unlawfully expropriated of their investments by the Respondent.\n\n**B. Fair and equitable treatment; impairment of investment**\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**1. The Claimants' position**\n------------------------------\n\n257.\n\nThe Claimants submit that Bolivia breached its obligation to ensure fair and equitable treatment (FET) to their investment in Bolivia set out in Article IV.1 of the Bolivia-Chile BIT. They also claim that Bolivia breached Article III(2) of the BIT by impairing the Claimants' investments through unreasonable or discriminatory measures (\" *medidas injustificadas o discriminatorias* \").287 Doing so, they note that the scope of the prohibition of unreasonable or discriminatory measures is similar to the scope of the fair and equitable treatment standard, stressing that Bolivia shares this understanding.288 Indeed, the prohibition of unreasonable or discriminatory treatment of foreign investments is usually considered one of the components of the FET standard, often alongside the legitimate expectations component. As a result, the Claimants address Bolivia's alleged breaches of FET and of the prohibition of unreasonable or discriminatory measures jointly.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the Claimants hold that the Spanish original \" *injustificada* \" and the terms \"unreasonable\" and \"arbitrary\" are similar in scope and have used both English terms to describe the Respondent's conduct.\n\nCounter-Mem., \u00b6 208.\n\n**a. The scope of the FET standard**\n------------------------------------\n\n258.\n\nThe Claimants argue that the FET standard must be interpreted in accordance with Article 31(1) of the Vienna Convention of the Law of Treaties (\"VCLT\"). They note that this standard is not a hard and fast rule and that it is not easy to define. Its constitutive elements \"fair\" and \"equitable\" require tribunals to engage in a subjective appreciation of the conduct of the host State taking all circumstances into consideration.289 When seeking a more objective or quantifiable definition of the standard, tribunals have referred to legitimate expectations created by the host State which it is bound to respect.290\n\nReply, \u00b6 244, citing *Mondev International Ltd. v. United States of America*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/99/2 (\" *Mondev v. USA* \"), Award of 11 October 2002, \u00b6 127, Exh. R-295.\n\nReply, \u00b6 245, citing *Suez, Sociedad General de Aguas de Barcelona, S.A. and Vivendi Universal,* *S.A. v. Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/03/19, Decision on Liability of 30 June 2010, \u00b6 203.\n\n259.\n\nFor the Claimants, there is no controversy that the obligations of the host State towards foreign investors derive from the terms of the applicable investment treaty. The concept of an investor's \"legitimate expectations\" is a widely recognized notion that helps define the scope of the FET provision.291\n\nReply, \u00b6 245 *.*\n\n260.\n\nIn response to Bolivia's argument that an FET obligation cannot limit sovereign prerogatives, the Claimants maintain that none of the obligations under the BIT threaten sovereignty. In support, it refers to the 1923 judgment of the Permanent Court of International Justice in the case of the *S.S. Wimbledon* that obligations undertaken in treaties are not a limitation on state sovereignty, but rather a manifestation of it.292\n\nPermanent Court of International Justice, Case of the *S.S. \"Wimbledon*, \" United Kingdom, France, Italy & Japan v. Germany, Judgment of 17 August 1923, p. 25.\n\n261.\n\nThe Claimants agree that their legitimate expectations, which are protected by the FET standard, do not render the legal system of the host state immutable. Their protection only ensures that Bolivia may not enact legislation or secure its compliance in a manner that violates its treaty obligations.293\n\n*Continental Casualty Company v. Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/03/9, Award of 5 September 2008, \u00b6 254.\n\n262.\n\nThe Claimants disagree with Bolivia's contention that the FET standard is equivalent to the minimum standard under international law. The Respondent relies on *Genin v. Estonia294* for this submission; however, \"the factual circumstances of the *Genin* case cannot be compared to those that affected the Claimants' investments.\"295 Further, \"[f]rom a conceptual point of view, the *Genin* tribunal's assimilation of the FET standard to the minimum standard of treatment under international law is not convincing. The assimilation does not reflect contemporary development of international law and has been rejected by a number of arbitral tribunals.\"296 Indeed, FET is not equivalent to the minimum treatment standard, on which the *Genin* tribunal relied, because \"FET cannot be understood as synonymous to a limited and exceptional notion comprised within the minimum treatment standard as phrased in 1926. It is rather a basic and autonomous requirement that frames the integral treatment that should be accorded to foreign investment.\"297\n\n*Genin v. Estonia*, Award of 25 June 2001.\n\nReply, \u00b6 253.\n\nReply, \u00b6 255, citing *Enron v.

Estonia*, Award of 25 June 2001, \u00b6 367 (Exh. R-287).\n\n**b. The Claimants' reasonable and legitimate expectations were defrauded by the Respondent**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n264.\n\nThe Claimants submit that Bolivia instilled legitimate expectations in them that were protected under Article IV of the BIT and later violated them. Specifically, they allege that, at a presentation in Santiago de Chile in May 2002, officials at the Ministry of Mining expressed Bolivia's commitment to provide and maintain favorable conditions for investors in Bolivia, particularly in the mining sector in the Salar de Uyuni.299 The presentation listed all the benefits of the legislation in force at that time, making special mention of the Mining Code, the Investment Law, and the investment treaties signed by Bolivia. In addition to the ICSID Convention, these included 25 BITs among which the BIT with Chile.\n\nExh. CD-30.\n\n265.\n\nIn the preceding decade between 1990 and 2002, Bolivia had signed more than 20 BITs with countries such as Spain and the United States. Bolivia had also adopted a new investment law in 1990300 which imposed virtually no restrictions on foreign investment and contained all the common protections for investors, such as guarantees of national treatment, non-discrimination, fair and equitable treatment, and access to international arbitration. In 1997, Bolivia had further adopted a Mining Code which reinforced the rights of concessionaires and reduced the causes for annulment of concessions.301\n\nLaw 1,182, Exh. CD-4.\n\nExh. CD-6.\n\n266.\n\nUnder these circumstances, the Claimants expected Bolivia to act consistently and transparently, not taking any arbitrary or discriminatory measures against investors and respecting acquired property rights. According to the Claimants:\n\na. \"It is reasonable for an investor to expect that it is not going to be deprived of its investment by way of a legally non-existing procedure. It is legitimate to expect that if its investment were to be subjected to expropriation, the latter would occur in compliance with the international protection it enjoys.\"302\n\nb. It is also reasonable for an investor to expect that concessions issued and granted by the appropriate Bolivian authority, *i.e.* the Tupiza and Tarija Regional Mining Superintendent, comply with Bolivian law. The alleged incompetence of that Superintendent or any formal errors incurred by her cannot be held against the Claimants nor be used to deprive them of their concessions.\n\nc. It is further reasonable for an investor to expect that the host State's public authorities will not conspire to remedy an unlawful expropriation and give it an appearance of legality. The 2004 Inter-Ministerial Memo and the order of the Minister of Mining to annul the concessions demonstrate that this expectation was not honoured.\n\nd. It is finally legitimate for an investor to expect that, after his concessions have been confiscated, they will not be annulled *ex post* on facts that do not exist and on legal grounds not provided in the applicable legislation.\n\nReply, \u00b6 265.\n\n**c. The revocation and** ***ex post*** **annulment of the mining concessions were unreasonable and arbitrary measures**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n267.\n\nThe Claimants contend that the \"erratic revocation of [the *Ley Valda* ] by Law 2,564, allowing for the annulment of Concessions acquired under the previous law,\" was in itself already unreasonable.303 But more importantly, they claim that \"the revocation and the annulment of the Concessions lacked legal grounds and were not based on a previous lawful investigation procedure, which renders them unreasonable and arbitrary.\"304\n\nReply, \u00b6 284.\n\nReply, \u00b6 285.\n\n268.\n\nAs set forth in the context of the expropriation claim, the Claimants contend that the revocation of the mining concessions was issued without foundation in Bolivian law, and that this was later acknowledged by the Bolivian authorities.305 The nonobservance of social, tax, environmental, technical or procedural laws noted in the audits were not causes for nullity of mining concessions under the existing proinvestment regime. Furthermore, any such non-observance could have been corrected had the Claimants been given an opportunity to be heard or to remedy any alleged irregularity.\n\nDecree 28,527, Exh. CD-74.\n\n269.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, the *ex post* annulment of the concessions also failed to comply with applicable substantive and procedural law. The formal and procedural causes invoked by the Mining Superintendent to annul NMM's concessions are not recognized by Bolivian law. Moreover, the Mining Superintendent abused the procedure and notified NMM of the resolution to annul the concessions in Tupiza instead of La Paz.306 The Claimants' submission is that \"[e]ach of these measures accounts for an unreasonable treatment of the Claimants' investment\" and that \"[v]iewed together their arbitrariness is even more undeniable.\"307\n\nAccording to the Claimants, the Superintendent of Mines notified RIGSSA and NMM of its resolution to annul the concessions at the offices of the Superintendent of Mines of Tupiza by posting the notice on the bulletin board of the secretary of the Superintendence (*see* Exh. R-275, regarding Pococho). The registered domiciles of RIGSSA and NMM, however, were not in Tupiza but in the city of La Paz.\n\nReply, \u00b6 288.\n\n**d. The revocation and** ***ex post*** **annulment of the concessions were also discriminatory**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n270.\n\nThe Claimants' allegation that the revocation and *ex post* annulment of the concessions were discriminatory has been included in the Claimants position on discrimination regarding expropriation (Section VI.A.4.a.ii.(b) above).\n\n**e. The Respondent cannot rely upon its own unlawful conduct to the detriment of the Claimants**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n271.\n\nThe Claimants contend that Bolivia tries to justify its misconduct by blaming the Claimants for faults that can only be attributed to Bolivia itself. Bolivia invokes its own inconsistent law-making, in particular its decision to first reduce the area of the fiscal reserve and later restore it. It also blames corrupt intervention in the Senate as the reason for the outcome of its own legislative processes. The Claimants argue that these facts have not been proven and in any event cannot be held against them.\n\n272.\n\nSimilarly, the Claimants emphasize that the alleged incompetence of the Regional Mining Superintendent and any errors made cannot be invoked to deprive them of their treaty rights. Errors in administrative proceedings committed by Bolivia's own authorities are the responsibility of the Respondent, not of the Claimants.\n\n**f. Post-expropriation acts of harassment**\n--------------------------------------------\n\n273.\n\nOn 22 July 2004, one month after the Revocation Decree was issued and one day before the term established for the forced delivery of the concessions, the Claimants requested the initiation of negotiations under Art. X of the BIT.308 According to the Claimants, from that moment on Bolivia began a harassment strategy to avoid international liability under the BIT and force the Claimants to give up their claim.\n\nExh. CD-58.\n\n274.\n\nThe Claimants rely in particular on the 8 December 2004 Inter-Ministerial Memo, which was produced by an inter-ministerial task force set up to evaluate the merits of their claim.309 They interpret the memorandum as a confirmation that the Revocation Decree had been issued under pressure from the Department of Potos\u00ed and that the revocation of the concessions was unlawful.\n\nExh. CD-68.\n\n275.\n\nSpecifically, the task force analyzed two different scenarios and identified a \"best alternative\" in the following terms:\n\nFIRST SCENARIO - The Bolivian Government may try to reach an amicable and mutually satisfactory agreement with the company. However it is clear that the only settlement possible with the company would be an indemnity or recovery of its concessions. For the Government, said option would involve a significant political cost and the generation of new social and regional conflicts with the Potosi Department.\n\nSECOND SCENARIO - The Bolivian Government may attempt to defend its decisions. Unfortunately, the Mining Code makes no provisions for the revocation of mining concessions. Therefore, this option has a great weakness. Another alternative would be to try to prove irregularities in the processing of the original mining concessions of Non Metallic Minerals S.A., so as to demonstrate that these are and always have been invalid. For the time being, this has been considered the best alternative.310\n\nExh. CD-68, pp. 10-11. Claimants' translation.\n\n276.\n\nThe Claimants believe that this \"best alternative\" had already been put into practice at the time when the 2004 Inter-Ministerial Memo was written. For them, Bolivia implemented a strategy to frustrate their rights under the BIT and thereby avoid international responsibility. Specifically, the Claimants allege that:\n\na. Bolivia carried out tax investigations against the Claimants from November 2004 to November 2007 approximately. In 2006, when President Evo Morales assumed office and following the registration of this case at the Centre, Bolivia invited the Claimants to participate in negotiations and agreed to suspend all tax proceedings,311 only to resume them ten days later.312\n\nb. While the Parties were discussing the implementation of the oral settlement reached as a result of these negotiations,313 Bolivia prepared and initiated criminal actions against several persons related to the present arbitration, including Mr. Allan Fosk. The Claimants view these criminal proceedings as merely instrumental to Bolivia's goals in this arbitration, *i.e.* (i) to deny the status of the Claimants as foreign investors under the BIT; (ii) to obtain, manipulate and fabricate evidence in support of Bolivia's defense, and (iii) to ultimately force the Claimants to give up their claims.\n\nExh. CD-76.\n\nExh. CD-77.\n\n*See* Procedural History, Section III above.\n\n**2. The Respondent's position**\n--------------------------------\n\n277.\n\nThe Respondent denies that by revoking and annulling the Claimants' concessions it has breached its obligation to accord fair and equitable treatment to the Claimants' investments or impaired those investments with unjustified, arbitrary or discriminatory measures. It also denies having treated the Claimants unfairly or inequitably by subsequent acts.\n\n**a. Bolivia did not treat the Claimants' investment unfairly and inequitably by revoking and declaring the annulment of the mining concessions**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n278.\n\nBolivia denies that it has breached its obligation to accord fair and equitable treatment to the Claimants' investments. In particular, it submits that, by revoking and declaring the annulment of the mining concessions, it did not breach any legitimate expectation of the Claimants protected by the BIT.\n\n279.\n\nWhile the Respondent submits that the scope of the FET standard under the BIT is limited to the minimum standard of treatment under customary international law, it contends that, even under a broad interpretation of the FET standard, the Claimants' expectations would not be covered. In the Respondent's view, this standard only protects legitimate and reasonable expectations of foreign investors that have an objective and genuine connection with legally binding obligations. The FET standard does not guarantee the immutability of the legal framework applicable to the investment, nor does it prevent the State from legislating and guaranteeing the application and compliance with the law in its territory.\n\n280.\n\nThe Respondent contends that, under Bolivian law, the Claimants could not have legitimately expected the rights acquired under the Mining Code to be maintained, because (i) the mining concessions were granted to Mr. Moscoso in breach of several rules of Bolivian law, including the Mining Code, and (ii) these breaches amount to annulment grounds under Bolivian law, even if these grounds are not specified in the Mining Code. Thus, the revocation of the mining concessions could not have frustrated the Claimants' legitimate expectations.\n\n281.\n\nUnder the BIT and international law, Bolivia is entitled to exercise its State prerogatives to legislate and enforce the law in its territory. The mining concessions were defective from the start and their revocation and annulment was the consequence of these illegalities under Bolivian law. Therefore, those measures cannot constitute breaches of the FET standard.\n\n282.\n\nFurther, the assessment of the FET standard must take into account not only the State's conduct, but also the Claimants'. When the mining concessions were acquired, the Claimants were aware of the controversies that surrounded the granting of the concessions within the fiscal reserve of the Salar de Uyuni and of the illegalities that affected the concessions. More specifically:\n\na. The Claimants' witnesses, Messrs. Carlos Shuffer and Allan Fosk, have admitted that they knew that they were doing business with former civil servants of the Ministry of Mining;314\n\nb. Quiborax knew that obtaining the concessions in the R\u00edo Grande deposit was only possible due to the reduction of the fiscal reserve of the Salar de Uyuni by the controversial *Ley Valda*. It also accepted to negotiate with Messrs. Moscoso and Ugalde as if they had title to the concessions, even though the resolutions constituting the concessions and their title deeds had not yet been issued by the Tupiza and Tarija Regional Mining Superintendent;315\n\nc. In March 2000, Quiborax requested a legal opinion from Teddy Cuentas Bascop\u00e9 (a Bolivian lawyer specialized in mining law) on the legitimacy and validity of RIGSSA's concessions, among other matters. The Claimants have submitted no evidence in this respect and do not even mention the conclusions of the opinion;\n\nd. The opposition of the political class and representatives of the civil society to the *Ley Valda* was well known in Bolivia.\n\ne. In this context, Bolivia insists that it never made any specific representation or guarantee to the Claimants with respect to the validity of the mining concessions.\n\nShuffer WS, \u00b6\u00b6 17-18; Fosk WS, \u00b6 31.\n\nExh. CD-10.\n\n**b. Bolivia has not impaired the Claimants' investment with unjustified, arbitrary or discriminatory measures by revoking and declaring the annulment of the mining concessions**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n283.\n\nThe Respondent claims that the revocation and annulment of the mining concessions were measures justified under the circumstances, as they were adopted to sanction the irregularities in the granting and administration of the mining concessions. It notes that international tribunals have found that the standard of Article III(2) of the BIT is practically identical to the FET standard,316 and therefore, refers to its position in connection with that standard.\n\n*Saluka v. Czech Republic*, Partial Award of 17 March 2006, \u00b6 461: \"Insofar as the standard of conduct is concerned, a violation of the non-impairment requirement does not therefore differ substantially from a violation of the \"fair and equitable treatment\" standard. The non-impairment requirement merely identifies more specific effects of any such violation, namely with regard to the operation, management, maintenance, use, enjoyment or disposal of the investment by the investor,\" (Exh. R-297). *See also* *Roussalis v. Romania*, Award of 7 December 2011, \u00b6 324 (Exh. R-298).\n\n284.\n\nIn addition, Bolivia submits that the revocation and annulment of the mining concessions were not arbitrary. According to the Respondent, the Claimants' argumentation is deficient as it does not specify (i) the legal basis for the arbitrariness standard (the BIT only refers to unjustified or discriminatory measures) and (ii) the reasons for the arbitrariness. In any event, this claim should be dismissed for the same reason as the other claims: the revocation and annulment of the mining concessions complied with Bolivian law and had a public interest justification.\n\n285.\n\nEven if, *par impossible,* the Tribunal decided that the revocation and annulment were unlawful and motivated by local political pressure, this would not suffice to render them arbitrary. For that, the Claimants would have to prove that Bolivia's conduct was an intentional violation of due process, which it cannot.317\n\n*L. F. H. Neer and Pauline Neer (United States of America) v. Mexico*, Award of 15 October 1926, Arbitral Awards Reports, Vol. IV, pp. 60-66: \"the propriety of governmental acts should be put to the test of international standards, [...] the treatment of an alien, in order to constitute an international delinquency, should amount to an outrage, to bad faith, to willful neglect of duty, or to an insufficiency of governmental action so far short of international standards that every reasonable and impartial man would readily recognize its insufficiency\" (Exh. R-299).\n\n286.\n\nMoreover, the Respondent opposes the allegation of discriminatory treatment by reason of nationality, as has been set out in Section VI.A.4.b.ii above, when explaining Bolivia's position on discrimination regarding both the expropriation and the FET claim.\n\n**c. Bolivia did not violate its obligations under the BIT through subsequent acts**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n287.\n\nFinally, the Respondent holds that the Claimants' claim arising from alleged postexpropriation acts of harassment is ill-founded for the following main reasons:\n\na. The Tribunal has already concluded that the alleged acts of harassment could not affect the Claimants' investment, since they ceased once the mining concessions were revoked;318\n\nb. This claim is moot. The criminal proceedings followed up on allegations that documents were forged to prove that Quiborax and Mr. Allan Fosk were shareholders of NMM before 13 September 2001 and therefore qualified as investors under the Treaty. This matter has already been dealt with by the Tribunal in its Decision on Jurisdiction, in which it decided that Quiborax was an investor under the BIT and that it lacked jurisdiction over the claims submitted by Mr. Allan Fosk;319\n\nc. The claim is based on an unreal and confusing reconstruction of the facts regarding the tax authorities' actions and the criminal proceedings ongoing in Bolivia.320\n\nCounter-Mem., \u00b6 231, citing the Decision on Provisional Measures, \u00b6 138.\n\nCounter-Mem., \u00b6 232, citing the Decision on Jurisdiction and Admissibility, \u00b6 237.\n\nCounter-Mem., \u00b6 233.\n\n**3. Analysis**\n---------------\n\n288.\n\nArticle III(2) of the BIT provides:\n\nEach Contracting Party shall protect within its territory the investments made in accordance with its laws and regulations, by the investors of the other Contracting Party and shall not impair the free administration, maintenance, use, enjoyment, extension, transfer, sale and liquidation of those investments through unreasonable or discriminatory measures.\n\n(Tribunal's translation).\n\nIn the Spanish original:\n\nCada Parte Contratante proteger\u00e1 dentro de su territorio las inversiones efectuadas de conformidad con sus leyes y reglamentos, por los inversionistas de la otra Parte Contratante y no obstaculizar\u00e1 la libre administraci\u00f3n, mantenimiento, uso, usufructo, extensi\u00f3n, transferencia, venta y liquidaci\u00f3n de dichas inversiones a trav\u00e9s de medidas injustificadas o discriminatorias.\n\n289.\n\nIn turn, Article IV(1) of the BIT provides:\n\nEach Contracting Party shall guarantee fair and equitable treatment within its territory to the investments of investors of the other Contracting party and shall ensure that the exercise of the rights recognized in this Agreement is not impaired.\n\n(Tribunal's translation).\n\nIn the Spanish original:\n\nCada Parte Contratante deber\u00e1 garantizar un tratamiento justo y equitativo dentro de su territorio a las inversiones de los inversionistas de la otra Parte Contratante y asegurar\u00e1 que el ejercicio de los derechos reconocidos en el presente Acuerdo no ser\u00e1 obstaculizado.\n\n290.\n\nThe claims under Articles III and IV of the BIT arise out of (a) the revocation of the concessions; (b) their subsequent annulment; and (c) alleged post-expropriation acts of harassment.\n\n**a. Revocation of the concessions**\n------------------------------------\n\n291.\n\nThe Tribunal considers it can be left open here whether the BIT's obligation to accord fair and equitable treatment can be equated with the minimum standard under international law. Indeed, the Tribunal finds that the revocation of the Claimants' concessions violates international law even under a more demanding standard. As noted by the *Waste Management II* tribunal:\n\n[T]he minimum standard of treatment of fair and equitable treatment is infringed by conduct attributable to the State and harmful to the claimant if the conduct is arbitrary, grossly unfair, unjust or idiosyncratic, is discriminatory and exposes the claimant to sectional or racial prejudice, or involves a lack of due process leading to an outcome which offends judicial propriety\u2014as might be the case with a manifest failure of natural justice in judicial proceedings or a complete lack of transparency and candour in an administrative process.321\n\n*Waste Management, Inc. v. United Mexican States*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/00/3 (\" *Waste Management v. Mexico II\")*, Award of 30 April 2004, \u00b6 98.\n\n292.\n\nIn the context of its analysis of the Claimants' expropriation claim, the Tribunal has already held that the revocation of the concessions was discriminatory and unjustified under Bolivian law. By the same token, it also violates the fair and equitable treatment standard, even if it were to be equated with the customary international law minimum standard of treatment.322\n\nSeveral tribunals have also considered that discriminatory acts breach the fair and equitable treatment standard. *See, e.g.*, *Saluka v. Czech Republic*, Partial Award of 17 March 2006, \u00b6 307 (\"A foreign investor protected by the Treaty may in any case properly expect that the Czech Republic implements its policies bona fide by conduct that is, as far as it affects the investors' investment, reasonably justifiable by public policies and that such conduct does not manifestly violate the requirements of consistency, transparency, even-handedness and nondiscrimination. In particular, any differential treatment of a foreign investor must not be based on unreasonable distinctions and demands, and must be justified by showing that it bears a reasonable relationship to rational policies not motivated by a preference for other investments over the foreign-owned investment\"); *V\u00edctor Pey Casado and President Allende Foundation v. Republic of Chile*, ICSID Case No. ARB/98/2 (\" *Pey Casado v. Chile* \"), Award of 8 May 2008, \u00b6 670 (\"Il est constant dans la jurisprudence internationale et dans la doctrine qu'un traitement discriminatoire de la part d'autorit\u00e9s \u00e9tatiques envers ses investisseurs \u00e9trangers constitue une violation de la garantie de traitement \u00ab *juste et \u00e9quitable* \u00bb inclus dans des trait\u00e9s bilat\u00e9raux d'investissement\"); *CMS Gas Transmission Company v. Republic of Argentina*, ICSID Case No. ARB/01/8 (\" *CMS v. Argentina* \"), Award of 12 May 2005, \u00b6 290 (\"The standard of protection against arbitrariness and discrimination is related to that of fair and equitable treatment. Any measure that might involve arbitrariness or discrimination is in itself contrary to fair and equitable treatment.\")\n\n293.\n\nFor the same reasons, the revocation of the concessions thus qualifies as an unjustified and discriminatory measure in the meaning of Article III(2) of the BIT. Indeed, the use, enjoyment, extension, transfer, sale and liquidation of the Claimants' investments was impaired through unjustified and discriminatory measures.\n\n294.\n\nAccordingly, the Tribunal concludes that the revocation of the concessions was done in breach of Articles III and IV of the BIT.\n\n295.\n\nThis conclusion applies to NMM and Quiborax alike. By revoking the concessions in the way that it did, Bolivia treated both NMM's and Quiborax's investments in Bolivia unfairly and inequitably, and impaired their use, enjoyment, extension, transfer, sale and liquidation through unjustified and discriminatory measures. It is easily explained that the FET breach also affected Quiborax. Indeed, the Tribunal has found that the very reason for the discrimination was the nationality of NMM's main shareholder, Quiborax.\n\n**b. Annulment of the concessions**\n-----------------------------------\n\n296.\n\nWith respect to the annulment of the concessions, the Claimants contend that the termination of the investment cannot be confused with the termination of Bolivia's obligations under the BIT,323 and that the Respondent should not be \"freed from its BIT obligations once it has deprived Claimant[s] from their investment.\"324\n\n*See* COSS, slides 68 and 69.\n\nTr., Day 1, 59:5-6.\n\n297.\n\nThe Tribunal shares this view, which was in particular expressed in *Mondev* in the following terms:\n\n[O]nce an investment exists, it remains protected by NAFTA even after the enterprise in question may have failed. This is obvious with respect to the protection offered by Article 1110 [expropriation]: [\u2026] a person remains an investor for the purposes of Articles 1116 and 1117 even if the whole investment has been definitively expropriated, so that all that remains is a claim for compensation. The point is underlined by the definition of an \"investor\" as someone who \"seeks to make, is making or has made an investment.\" Even if an investment is expropriated, it remains true that the investor \"has made\" the investment.\n\nSimilar considerations apply to Articles 1102 [national treatment] and 1105 [minimum standard of treatment]. Issues of orderly liquidation and the settlement of claims may still arise and require \"fair and equitable treatment,\" \"full protection and security\" and the avoidance of invidious discrimination. [\u2026]325\n\n*Mondev v. USA*, Award of 11 October 2002, \u00b6\u00b6 80-81.\n\n298.\n\nThe same applies here. The BIT defines the term investor as someone who \"has made investments\" (\" *haya[] efectuado inversiones* \") in the territory of the host State.326 Likewise, the scope of protection of the BIT extends to investments \"made\" (\" *efectuadas* \") in the territory of the host State.327\n\nBIT, Article I(1).\n\nBIT, Article II.\n\n299.\n\nHowever, the Claimants have also noted that \"[f]rom the point of view of the deprivation of property suffered by the Claimants, the annulments are irrelevant. The Claimants lost their entire investment in Bolivia due to [the Revocation Decree], followed by the forced return of the Bolivian concessions to the State on 23 July 2004. The subsequent annulments of these very same concessions are but an *ex post* intent to change the true course of events.\"328 In other words, the Claimants recognize that the annulments did not deprive them of any property that they had not already lost through the revocation of the concessions. As a result, applying the principle of procedural economy, the Tribunal would not need to examine the Claimants' FET and Article III claims related to the subsequent annulment of the concessions. Indeed, with respect to their claims of deprivation of property, the Claimants would not be entitled to greater monetary relief even if the Tribunal were to establish a breach of these BIT protections.329 Having said that, the Tribunal will address these claims for the sake of completeness.\n\nMem., \u00b6 102. Footnote omitted.\n\n*See, e.g.*, *Ioan Micula, Viorel Micula, S.C. European Food S.A, S.C. Starmill S.R.L. and S.C. Multipack S.R.L. v. Romania*, ICSID Case No. ARB/05/20 (\" *Micula v. Romania* \"), Award of 11 December 2013, \u00b6 874. *See also* Chevron Corporation (U.S.A.) and *Texaco Petroleum Corporation (U.S.A.) v. Republic of Ecuador* [I], PCA Case No. AA 277, Partial Award on the Merits of 30 March 2010, \u00b6 275.\n\n300.\n\nOn 28 October 2004, Bolivia annulled the Claimants' already revoked concessions. The writs of annulment stated that the annulments were grounded on a lack of legal capacity or sufficient legal representation of the principal and the agent (\" *impersoner\u00eda en el mandante y mandatario* \").330\n\nExh. R-276; *See* \u00b6 31 *supra*.\n\n301.\n\nThe Tribunal has already found that the alleged grounds for the annulment of the concessions had no basis in the facts nor in the law (*see* Section VI.A.2 above). The Claimants have established that the flaws alleged by Bolivia were either non-existent or were not subject to the sanction of annulment. In particular, the Tribunal has concluded that the powers of attorney to represent RIGSSA and NMM in the acquisition of the concessions were valid, and that any flaws attached to them were not sanctioned by the nullity of the concessions (*see* paragraphs 140 to 142 above).\n\n302.\n\nTo the contrary, the record suggests that the annulment of the concessions was an *ex post* attempt to improve Bolivia's defense in this arbitration, not a *bona fide* exercise of Bolivia's police powers. Indeed, as discussed in Section VI.A.2 above, the annulment of the concessions appears to have been Bolivia's way of legalizing the extinction of the concessions after the legality of the Revocation Decree was questioned. The Tribunal cannot fail to note that the 2004 Inter-Ministerial Memo considered precisely this defense strategy in connection with the Claimants' BIT case:\n\nSECOND SCENARIO - The Bolivian Government may attempt to defend its decisions. Unfortunately, the Mining Code makes no provisions for the revocation of mining concessions. Therefore, this option has a great weakness. Another alternative would be to try to prove irregularities in the processing of the original mining concessions of Non Metallic Minerals S.A., so as to demonstrate that these are and always have been invalid. For the time being, this has been considered the best alternative.331\n\nExh. CD-68, Tribunal's translation.\n\n303.\n\nAlthough the 2004 Inter-Ministerial Memo postdates the writs of annulment, it confirms the course of action adopted by the Government. The annulment took place four months after the revocation of the concessions on different grounds. Had the concessions been improperly granted, they would have been annulled or declared null and void in the first place, not revoked for other reasons.\n\n304.\n\nThe Tribunal concludes that the annulment of the concessions was thus not a legitimate exercise of the Respondent's police powers; it was not consistent with Bolivia's obligation to accord fair and equitable treatment to the Claimants' investments. It is also an unjustified measure that impaired the Claimants' use, enjoyment, extension, transfer, sale and liquidation of their investments. Consequently, the Tribunal holds that by annulling the Claimants' concessions the Respondent has breached Articles IV(1) and III(2) of the BIT.\n\n**c. Post-expropriation acts of harassment**\n--------------------------------------------\n\n305.\n\nThe Claimants also argue that Bolivia breached its obligation to accord their investments fair and equitable treatment and not to impair them by unreasonable or discriminatory measures through post-expropriation acts of harassment. In particular, the Claimants allege that, after the Claimants requested the initiation of negotiations under the BIT, Bolivia commenced a \"harassment strategy\" to avoid international liability under the BIT, consisting of audits and inspections directed to find flaws in the acquisition of NMM's concessions, tax investigations, and the initiation of criminal actions against persons related to the ICSID case, including former Claimant Allan Fosk.\n\n306.\n\nThe Tribunal understands that this claim arises from the same facts as the claims for a declaratory judgment and moral damages. As a result, it will address these claims jointly under Section VII.B below.\n\n**VII. REPARATION**\n-------------------\n\n307.\n\nHaving held that the Respondent has breached the BIT, the Tribunal must now turn to the claims for reparation. The Tribunal will first address the claim for compensatory damages (A), before turning to the Claimants' request for moral damages and a declaratory judgment (B).\n\n**A. Compensatory Damages**\n---------------------------\n\n308.\n\nFollowing on overview of the Parties' positions (1), the Tribunal will address the applicable standard of compensation (2). Thereafter, it will determine the appropriate valuation method (3) and, on that basis, it will quantify the Claimants' damages for the loss of ulexite reserves and resources (4). It will then deal with the claim for the loss of lithium resources (5). Finally, it will address the claim for interest on the damages awarded (6).\n\n**1. Overview of the Parties' positions**\n-----------------------------------------\n\n309.\n\nThe Claimants contend that they are entitled to full reparation of the damage caused by the Respondent's breaches of the BIT, which can only be achieved by compensatory damages equivalent to the fair market value (FMV) of their investment, assessed *ex post* (*i.e.* on the date of the Award, not at the time of the breach) and calculated in accordance with the discounted cash flow (DCF) method. Relying on the valuation performed by their expert Navigant, on the basis of ulexite reserves and resources in the concessions assessed by their expert Behre Dolbear, the Claimants contend that the FMV of their investment is equivalent to a maximum of US$ 146,112,442 and a minimum of US$ 140,459,669. The Claimants also request compensation for lithium resources in the concessions in an amount of US$ 736,385.\n\n310.\n\nThe Respondent, for its part, contends as a preliminary point that no reparation is possible given the illegalities that affect the mining concessions. If there were to be a reparation, there would be a shared responsibility of at least 50% which would reduce the value of the compensation proportionately.332 Even if the Tribunal were to consider that Bolivia has breached its obligations under the BIT, the Respondent objects to the Claimants' compensation claim, arguing that the Claimants have inflated their damages by applying an improper valuation method and overestimating the existing reserves in the concessions. According to the Respondent, the amount claimed is astronomical compared to the actual damage which the Claimants might have suffered due to the loss of the mining concessions.\n\nCounter-Mem., \u00b6 248.\n\n311.\n\nMore specifically, the Respondent argues that the Claimants can only be compensated for damages that have been proven with certainty. On this basis, it rejects the Claimants' proposed DCF valuation method, arguing that it cannot be applied when future cash flows cannot be projected reliably. Instead, it proposes valuing the investment on the basis of investments effectively made and not recovered (following the \"net investments\" or \"sunk costs\" method set out in Article VI(2) of the BIT). Should the Tribunal choose to apply the DCF method, the Respondent argues that the valuation date should be that of the alleged expropriation, not of the Award, and that it should be calculated according to the variables proposed by its expert, Econ One.\n\n**2. Standard of compensation**\n-------------------------------\n\n**a. The Claimants' position**\n------------------------------\n\n312.\n\nThe Claimants submit that the BIT does not address damages for violations of the BIT. Article VI only specifies the compensation to which the investor is entitled in the event of a lawful expropriation, stating that this compensation shall be \"based on the market value of the affected investment immediately before the measure became public knowledge.\"333\n\nClaimants' translation, Mem., \u00b6 181.\n\n313.\n\nIn the absence of any *lex specialis*, the Claimants submit that the standard for damages is the customary international law principle of full reparation, as embodied in *Chorz\u00f3w* and codified in the ILC Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts (the \"ILC Articles\") (specifically, in Articles 31, 34 and 36.2). The Claimants argue that, in accordance with this principle, the standard of compensation for the confiscation of the concessions, whether understood as a violation of Articles III, IV or VI of the BIT, is that the Claimants must be fully restored to the position in which they would have been if the unlawful act had not occurred.334\n\nMem., \u00b6\u00b6 181-183.\n\n314.\n\nThe Claimants propose a valuation method based on the fair market value (\"FMV\") of the concessions, *i.e*., the price which a hypothetical buyer would be willing to pay for the concessions at a certain moment in time. They claim that FMV is the generally accepted standard for compensation in investment arbitration and customary international law, and allege that Quiborax is entitled to 51% of such value. The Claimants also clarify that \"they have not suggested a valuation method based on the value of Quiborax as a company *but for* the confiscation of the Concession, but a valuation of the fair market value of the Bolivian Concessions [\u2026].\"335\n\nReply, \u00b6 312 (emphasis in original).\n\n315.\n\nThe Claimants agree with the Respondent that their damages must be \"sufficiently certain.\" As to the degree of certainty required to comply with the burden of proof, it is the Claimants' position that future damages must be proven with *reasonable certainty*. The degree of certainty that Bolivia demands makes compensation for lost profits virtually impossible.\n\n316.\n\nTo achieve full reparation, the Claimants' damages must be valued on the date of the Award. Limiting the amount of damages to the value of the undertaking at the moment of the dispossession is not justified in the present case. Bolivia did not exercise its right to expropriate, but instead confiscated the concessions in violation of international law. Indeed, Bolivia's wrongful act did not consist merely in not having paid the Claimants' proper compensation (*see* further Section VII.A.4.c.i below).\n\n317.\n\nThe Claimants contend that their damages can in any event not be less than the compensation warranted under Art. VI of the BIT, *i.e.* the FMV of the investment on the date of the expropriation, as the compensation due for a \"lawful\" expropriation should represent the lower limit.336\n\n*Case Concerning the Factory at Chorz\u00f3w (Germany v. Poland)* Judgement of 13 September 1928, Claim for Indemnity (The Merits), P.C.I.J. Series A, No. 17 (1928), Exh. CL-6; Marboe, Irmgard, Compensation and Damages in International Law - The Limits of \"Fair Market Value,\" in The Journal of World Investment & Trade (2006), Exh.CL-25.\n\n**b. The Respondent's position**\n--------------------------------\n\n318.\n\nAs a general matter, the Respondent submits that, under international law, damages are recoverable if the claimant proves the existence of damage and a causal relation between the conduct attributable to the State (in this case, a breach of the BIT) and the damage.337\n\nE.g., Exhs. R-302 and R-320.\n\n319.\n\nThe Respondent further contends that damages must be proved with a *sufficient or reasonable degree of certainty*.338 This rule is especially relevant when the claimant seeks to be compensated for the loss of future revenues because \"regarding future damages, the principle of non-reparation of hypothetical damage means that only losses that can be anticipated with certainty can be compensated.\"339 Bolivia submits that the ulexite reserves used by the Claimants' expert to calculate damages are highly speculative.340\n\nCounter-Mem., \u00b6\u00b6 250, 285, 295, 297, 309 and 320.\n\nCounter-Mem., \u00b6 287, Tribunal's translation.\n\nCounter-Mem., \u00b6\u00b6 290, 297.\n\n320.\n\nIn this case, the Respondent submits that the appropriate standard of compensation is set out in Article VI of the BIT.341 This provision requires that all expropriations be accompanied by the \"payment of an immediate, sufficient and effective compensation,\"342 which shall be based on to the \"market value of the affected investments on a date immediately prior to that in which the measure became public knowledge\" [\u2026].\"343\n\nCounter-Mem., \u00b6\u00b6 319-326.\n\nArticle VI(1)(c) of the BIT, Tribunal's translation. The Spanish original reads: \"las medidas vayan acompa\u00f1adas de disposiciones para el pago de una compensaci\u00f3n inmediata, suficiente y efectiva.\"\n\nArticle VI(2) of the BIT, Tribunal's translation. The Spanish original reads: \"La compensaci\u00f3n se basar\u00e1 en el valor de mercado de las inversiones afectadas en una fecha inmediatamente anterior a aquella en que la medida lleg\u00f3 a conocimiento p\u00fablico. [\u2026].\"\n\n321.\n\nThe Respondent recognizes that under this standard the Claimants are entitled to the FMV of their investments, but argues that, in this case, this is at most equivalent to the Claimants' unamortized investments (*i.e.*, their \"sunk costs\" or \"Net Investment\").344\n\nThe Respondent refers to it as \"Inversi\u00f3n Neta Realizada,\" which the Claimants have translated as \"Net Investment Realized.\" The Tribunal will refer to it as the \"Net Investment\" or \"sunk costs\" method.\n\n322.\n\nWhile Bolivia acknowledges the existence of the full reparation standard under international law as articulated by the PCIJ in *Chorz\u00f3w*, its position as to its applicability to this case is unclear. In its Counter-Memorial, the Respondent admits that, \"in accordance with customary international law reflected in the *Chorz\u00f3w* case, any unlawful act entails the obligation to repair the damage caused entirely,\" but submits that the standard set out in Article VI(2) of the BIT ensures full reparation of the Claimants' damages.345 However, in its Rejoinder, the Respondent appears to question the standard of compensation set out in *Chorz\u00f3w*, stating that, even assuming that this standard (or the standard set out in the ILC Articles) reflects customary international law adequately, its application in this case is questionable. Relying on the ILC Commentary to Article 34 of the ILC Articles, the *Claim against the USSR for Damage caused by Soviet Cosmos* and *Diallo*, the Respondent maintains that the full reparation principle should not be followed without due consideration to the principles of proportionality and reasonableness that arise from customary international law.346 The Respondent further contends that this case must be distinguished from *Chorz\u00f3w* : \"while in that case Poland lacked any right to expropriate the investment at issue, in the present dispute it is undeniable that Bolivia possesses that prerogative and that its exercise is fully legitimate.\"347\n\nCounter-Mem., \u00b6 338, Tribunal's translation.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 171.\n\nCounter-Mem., \u00b6\u00b6 349-350, Tribunal's translation.\n\n323.\n\nEven if the full reparation principle did apply, the Respondent contends that the Claimants have failed to meet the standard of proof that this principle requires, *i.e.* :\n\na. There must be a proximate causal link between the damage and the violation of international law;\n\nb. The compensation requested must be reasonable;\n\nc. The damage must be certain and not hypothetical or indeterminate;\n\nd. There must be no risk of double-counting;\n\ne. The investor must prove the causal link, the quantum of damages and that the damage is recoverable under the applicable law.348\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 172.\n\n324.\n\nFinally, the Respondent submits that, if the Tribunal were to accept the Claimants' valuation method, it should calculate the FMV of the concessions on the date of the alleged expropriation. There is no reason to justify a valuation date after the date of the alleged expropriation of the concessions (*see* further Section VII.A.4.c.i below).\n\n**c. Analysis**\n---------------\n\n325.\n\nThe Tribunal understands that the claim for compensatory damages covers all of the Claimants' financially assessable damage arising from the loss of their investments in Bolivia, whether such loss was caused by Bolivia's unlawful expropriation of those investments, by Bolivia's unfair and inequitable treatment or by its impairment of their investments through unreasonable or discriminatory measures.349\n\nMem., \u00b6\u00b6 181-183. The Claimants' requests for relief, cited in \u00b6 75 above, specify that that Claimants request an award:\n\n326.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees with the Claimants that the BIT does not establish the standard of compensation for internationally wrongful acts. Article VI(2) of the BIT sets out the standard of compensation for lawful expropriations, possibly including expropriations that comply with all legality requirements but for the payment of compensation350. The treaty standard does not apply to unlawful expropriations, which are governed by the full reparation principle as articulated by the PCIJ in the *Chorz\u00f3w* case and later expressed in the ILC Articles. Article VI(2) does not purport to establish a *lex specialis* for unlawful expropriations.351\n\n\u25a0 \"Ordering Bolivia to pay Claimants full compensation in an amount not less than US$ 61,481,461 as of 1 August 2009 for damages suffered due to the loss of their investment in Bolivia, plus compound interest at the commercial rate on such amount from such date until the date of actual payment\" (Mem., Section X(8)).\n\n\u25a0 \"Ordering Bolivia to pay the Claimants full compensation to an amount of US$ 146,848,827 as of 30 June 2013 for damages suffered due to the loss of their investment in Bolivia, plus compound interest at the commercial rate on that amount from such date until the date of actual payment\" (Reply, Section IX(4)).\n\nArbitrator Lalonde and the President note Arbitrator Stern's observation in her dissent, but deem it unnecessary to deal with a legal issue that does not arise here.\n\n*See, e.g.,* *Waguih Elie George Siag and Clorinda Vecchi v. Arab Republic of Egypt*, ICSID Case No. ARB/05/15, Award of 1 June 2009 (Exh. R-348), \u00b6 540 (holding that the provision on compensation for expropriation in the relevant BIT \"does not purport to establish a *lex specialis* governing the standards of compensation for wrongful or unlawful expropriations.\"). *See also Vivendi v. Argentina II*, Award of 20 August 2007 (Exh. R-310), \u00b6 8.2.3, and *Saipem S.p.A. v. People's Republic of Bangladesh*, ICSID Case No. ARB/05/7, Award of 30 June 2009, \u00b6 201.\n\n327.\n\nIt is a basic principle of international law that States incur responsibility for their internationally wrongful acts. This principle is set forth in ILC Article 1, which provides that \"[e]very internationally wrongful act of a State entails the international responsibility of that State.\" The corollary to this principle, which was first articulated by the PCIJ in the often-quoted *Chorz\u00f3w* case352 is that the responsible State must repair the damage caused by its internationally wrongful act. As stated in ILC Article 31:\n\nArticle 31 Reparation\n\n1. The responsible State is under an obligation to make full reparation for the injury caused by the internationally wrongful act.\n\n2. Injury includes any damage, whether material or moral, caused by the internationally wrongful act of the State.\n\n*Factory at Chorz\u00f3w*, Jurisdiction, 1927, P.C.I.J., Series A, No. 9, p. 21.\n\n328.\n\nThis reparation must be \"full,\" *i.e.*, it must eliminate all consequences of the internationally wrongful act and restore the injured party to the situation that would have existed if the act had not been committed.353 If restitution in kind is impossible or not practicable, the compensation awarded must wipe out all of the consequences of the wrongful act. In this respect, ILC Article 36 provides that \"[t]he State responsible for an internationally wrongful act is under an obligation to compensate for the damage caused thereby, insofar as such damage is not made good by restitution,\" adding that \"compensation shall cover any financially assessable damage, including loss of profits insofar as it is established.\"\n\n*Factory at Chorz\u00f3w,* Merits, 1928, P.C.I.J., Series A, No. 17, p. 47.\n\n329.\n\nHere, the Tribunal has found that the Claimants' investments in Bolivia were subject to direct - as far as NMM is concerned - and indirect - as far as Quiborax is concerned - expropriation which did not comply with the requirements set out in the BIT for a lawful expropriation. Consequently, the Claimants are entitled to full reparation of the damages suffered.\n\n330.\n\nThat said, there is authority to suggest that, in certain cases, the State's obligation to make full reparation may be reduced after considering certain mitigating factors, such as remoteness of the damage,354 intervening or concurrent causes,355 the existence of contributory negligence on the part of the investor,356 or the application of the principle of proportionality.357 However, in the circumstances of this expropriation, the Tribunal does not see any facts that could justify a reduction for any of these factors.\n\n*See, e.g.,* ILC Articles, Commentary to Article 31; *Micula v.

Valuation method**\n-----------------------\n\n**a. The Claimants' position**\n------------------------------\n\n331.\n\nIn the Claimants' view, the appropriate method for calculating the FMV of a profit generating enterprise is the DCF method. It notes that Bolivia acknowledges that this is the valuation method used \"for a going concern with a proven record of profitability.\"358\n\nCounter-Mem., \u00b6 294. Reference to World Bank Guidelines on the Treatment of Foreign Direct Investment (Guideline IV:6 (i), p. 6, Exh. CL-20).\n\n332.\n\nThe Claimants note that they operated the concessions between 2001 and 2004, and that both NMM and Quiborax were profit-generating companies during that time. According to the Claimants, their successful operation of the concessions during almost three years is sufficient to establish their performance history and generate the data required to calculate future income. Moreover, given the past success of the operation, future income could have been expected with reasonable certainty, but for the loss of the concessions. These three years of operation also demonstrate that the Claimants were going concerns.\n\n333.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, the DCF method allows tribunals to assess the economic value of a company in a realistic manner. They claim that by applying the DCF method they will be \"fully restored to the position they would have been in, had the unlawful act not occurred.\"359\n\nReply, \u00b6 319.\n\n334.\n\nIn reply to the Respondent's objections to the DCF method, the Claimants contend that international tribunals have acknowledged its appropriateness in the assessment of going concerns, noting that the DCF has been rejected in cases without a proven track record of profitability, which is not the case here.\n\n335.\n\nThe Claimants object to Bolivia's proposed valuation on the basis of the net investment made or sunk costs. According to the Claimants, Bolivia's position is financially incorrect and contrary to established case law. Specifically:\n\na. First, the Claimants note that Article VI(2) of the BIT, upon which Bolivia relies, addresses situations \"where [the market value] cannot be readily ascertained.\"360 Here, the projected cash flows of the Claimants' business are not difficult to establish. The Claimants' history of profitability during almost three years provides sufficient data to make a reasonable projection.\n\nb. Second, as already stated, the Claimants argue that the standard of compensation contained in Article VI of the BIT is not applicable to unlawful expropriations. Citing *ADC v. Hungary* and *Siag v. Egypt*, the Claimants contend that the BIT only sets the standard of compensation for lawful expropriations, which cannot be used to determine the damages payable in cases of unlawful expropriations.\n\nc. Third, the Claimants contend that Bolivia's proposed valuation method does not assess the FMV of the investment nor does it restore the Claimants to the position they would have been in had the unlawful act not occurred. Citing Ripinsky and Williams, the Claimants submit that it is wrong to assume that the historic cost of an investment reflects its market value.361 In addition, the sunk costs method is inappropriate because \"it pretends to put the Claimants in the position they would have been in if the investment had never occurred. [...] Yet the investment did take place, it did produce profits, and it would have continued on that path had it not been for Bolivia's wrongful acts.\"362\n\nd. The Claimants also reject Bolivia's contention that the sunk costs method has been accepted by international tribunals. According to the Claimants, in three out of the four cases cited by the Respondent (*Metalclad,363 Tecmed,364* and *Wena365*), the tribunals acknowledged the appropriateness of the DCF method analysis for going concerns, but dismissed it on the specific facts. In the fourth case cited by the Respondent (*Azurix366*), the Claimant did not request the application of the DCF method.\n\ne. In addition, the Claimants maintain that the gap between their monetary investment and the amount of damages claimed is not unreasonable. Large injections of capital do not necessarily render a business valuable, whereas there are \"numerous examples of businesses being sold for a price much higher than the amount originally invested, particularly if the business proves successful.\"367\n\nClaimants' translation.\n\nReply, \u00b6 363.\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 370-371.\n\n*Metalclad v. Mexico*, Award of 30 August 2000.\n\n*Tecmed v. Mexico*, Award of 29 May 2003.\n\n*Wena Hotels Limited v. Arab Republic of Egypt*, ICSID Case No. ARB/98/4 (\" *Wena v.

Williams, \"Damages in International Investment Law,\" pp. 229-230, Exh. CL-58.\n\n336.\n\nFor these reasons, the Claimants reject the Respondent's proposed valuation method, arguing that \"by requesting the Tribunal to award Claimants the net value of their investment, Bolivia is pretending that its unlawful behavior remains without consequence.\"368\n\nReply, \u00b6 372.\n\n**b. The Respondent's position**\n--------------------------------\n\n337.\n\nThe Respondent opposes the application of the DCF method to value the Claimants' investments. It argues that this method is unreliable, in particular because of the uncertainty of the assumptions necessary to project future cash flows. Some of the factors commonly recognized by arbitral jurisprudence to conclude that there is insufficient certainty are the lack of a track record of the activity and profitability of the asset or the unpredictability of the legal and socio-economic environment.\n\n338.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the present case involves numerous uncertainties. In particular, there is no track record of profitability of the concessions and the assumptions necessary to forecast future cash flows are highly speculative, especially regarding the reserves of ulexite and their price.\n\n339.\n\nInstead of the DCF method, the Respondent proposes calculating the FMV of the investments in accordance with the parameters set out in the second sentence of Article VI(2) of the BIT for cases in which such FMV is difficult to ascertain. These parameters include the invested capital, its depreciation, the repatriated capital and the replacement value of the investment, among other factors.369\n\nArticle VI(2) of the BIT provides: \"The compensation shall be based on to the market value of the affected investments on a date immediately prior to that in which the measure became public knowledge. When such value is difficult to determine, the compensation may be fixed in accordance with valuation principles that are generally recognized as equitable, taking into consideration the invested capital, its depreciation, the capital repatriated to that date, its replacement value and other relevant factors,\" Tribunal's translation. (The Spanish original reads: \"La compensaci\u00f3n se basar\u00e1 en el valor de mercado de las inversiones afectadas en una fecha inmediatamente anterior a aquella en que la medida lleg\u00f3 a conocimiento p\u00fablico. Cuando resulte dif\u00edcil determinar dicho valor, la compensaci\u00f3n podr\u00e1 ser fijada de acuerdo con los principios de avaluaci\u00f3n generalmente reconocidos como equitativos, teniendo en cuenta el capital invertido, su depreciaci\u00f3n, el capital repatriado hasta esa fecha, el valor de reposici\u00f3n y otros factores relevantes. [\u2026]\").\n\n340.\n\nThe Respondent emphasizes that, for the second sentence of Article VI(2) of the BIT to apply, the establishment of the FMV must be merely difficult, not impossible. According to the Respondent, \"by using the word \u2018difficult', the Treaty was precisely looking to include the current situation, where there is not enough certainty to project future flows.\"370\n\nCounter-Mem., \u00b6 320, Tribunal's translation.\n\n341.\n\nAs a consequence, Bolivia proposes a valuation based on the Claimants' unamortized investments, *i.e.*, their sunk costs or net investment.371 According to the Respondent, this valuation method has been accepted by many international tribunals (e.g., *Azurix v. Argentina,372 Metalclad v. Mexico,373 Tecmed v. Mexico,374* and *Wena Hotels v. Egypt375*) and scholars (e.g., Marboe,376 Wells377 and Ripinsky and Williams378) to calculate the FMV of investments when there is insufficient certainty regarding future cash flows, for instance with respect to recently acquired assets or assets that have not started generating cash flows. Relying on *Wena* and *Tecmed*, the Respondent also submits that tribunals have rejected the DCF method when there is a significant disparity between the amount invested and the results of a DCF computation.379\n\nCounter-Mem., \u00b6\u00b6 319-321.\n\n*Azurix v.

Analysis**\n---------------\n\n343.\n\nThe Tribunal has held that the appropriate standard of compensation is the customary international law principle of full reparation. According to that principle, the Claimants must be restored to the position they would have been in had the unlawful act not occurred. Both Parties agree that such reparation should reflect the FMV of the investment, but disagree on the methodology to calculate that FMV. They also diverge on the relevant valuation date, a matter that is addressed later (*see* Section VII.A.4.c.i below). The Claimants assert that the DCF analysis is the appropriate method to value the FMV of NMM, since it qualifies as a going concern with a proven track record of profitability.381 The Respondent, by contrast, submits that the FMV of the concessions must be established by reference to the net amounts invested in accordance with Article VI(2) of the BIT.382\n\nReply, \u00b6 343.\n\n\"The compensation will be based on the market value of the affected investments on a date immediately prior to the date on which the measure reaches the general public. Where it is difficult to determine this value, the compensation may be set in accordance with the valuation principles generally recognized as fair, taking into account the capital invested, its depreciation, the capital repatriated to that date, the replacement value and other relevant factors. [\u2026],\" Tribunal's translation.\n\n344.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the DCF method is widely accepted as the appropriate method to assess the FMV of going concerns with a proven record of profitability. The World Bank Guidelines on the Treatment of Foreign Direct Investment, cited by both Parties,383 suggest that the market value of an expropriated investment may be determined \"for a going concern with a proven record of profitability, on the basis of the discounted cash flow value.\"384 This approach has been endorsed by a large number of investment tribunals.385\n\n*See* Mem., \u00b6 208; Counter-Mem., \u00b6 294.\n\nWorld Bank, \"Guidelines on the Treatment of Foreign Direct Investment,\" 2002 (Exh.

Tanzania*, Award of 24 July 2008, \u00b6 793.\n\n345.\n\nBy contrast, the method proposed by the Respondent is applicable only when it is difficult to establish the FMV of the expropriated investments.386 As the Respondent's economic expert explained during the hearing on the merits, sunk costs are \"generally used when alternative valuation methods are unreliable and/or highly speculative, for example due to the lack of enough historical information to project with a minimum of certainty the future evolution of the business that is being valued.\"387 While a disparity between sunk costs and the future profitability of the investment may be one factor among others to reject the DCF method, there is no authority to suggest that damages should be quantified on the basis of sunk costs because of that disparity only.388\n\nThe Tribunal does not believe that the sunk costs should be disregarded completely simply because it is spelled out in Article VII(2) of the BIT, which sets out standard of compensation for lawful expropriations. Even in the absence of the second sentence of Article VII(2), the Tribunal could find it appropriate to resort to this method if the investments to be valued were not going concerns or did not have proven record of profitability.\n\nEcon One Presentation, slide 47, Tribunal's translation.\n\nIn *Wena* and *Tecmed*, this disparity was only one of several factors considered by the tribunals to reject the DCF method, such as insufficient financing, short time of operation and lack of reliable information to perform a DCF calculation. *See Wena v. Egypt*, Award of 8 December 2000, \u00b6 118; *Tecmed v. Mexico*, Award of 29 May 2003, \u00b6 186). *See also* *Lemire v. Ukraine*, Award of 28 March 2011, \u00b6 8.\n\n346.\n\nThe Claimants contend that both NMM and Quiborax were going concerns at the time of the expropriation and therefore their FMV may be established on the basis of the DCF method.389 The Tribunal notes however that the Claimants claim that there has been an expropriation of NMM's investments in Bolivia (*i.e.*, the mining concessions) and of Quiborax's investments in Bolivia (which the Tribunal understands to have been mainly its shares in NMM). Hence, Quiborax's FMV as such is irrelevant. The Claimants implicitly concede this, as they have not attempted to calculate Quiborax's FMV; rather, they have focused on the valuation of the concessions owned by NMM.390 In the Tribunal's view, this suffices to establish the FMV of both NMM's and Quiborax's investments in Bolivia (as the concessions were NMM's primary asset and Quiborax's main assets in Bolivia were its shares in NMM). The Tribunal will thus focus on the FMV of NMM's concessions.\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 342-343.\n\n*See* Navigant, First ER, \u00b6\u00b6 2-4, describing the scope of the damages' valuation. *See also* Reply, \u00b6 312, where the Claimants explain that \"they have not suggested a valuation method based on the value of Quiborax as a company *but for* the confiscation of the Concession, but a valuation of the fair market value of the Bolivian Concessions [...]\" (emphasis in original).\n\n347.\n\nNMM was incorporated in July 2001 and became the owner of the concessions in August 2001 after RIGGSA's contribution (*see* Section II above). The record suggests that NMM commenced operating the concessions in late 2001 and commenced sales in 2002.391 NMM thus operated the concessions for at least two full years, and was operating at the time of the expropriation. In the Tribunal's view, NMM's mining activity has a sufficient record of operations and prospective profitability to justify applying the DCF method to value the concessions. As discussed in detail below, there is sufficient evidence in the record to make a projection of the future cash flows that would have been generated by the concessions with reasonable certainty. In particular, there is sufficient evidence of the reserves found in the concessions, prospective future sales (arising from the Supply Contract between Quiborax and RIGSSA in 2001392) and sufficient information on prospective prices and costs to justify valuing the concessions on the basis of the DCF method.\n\nNavigant, First ER, \u00b6 70; Seraudit's Independent Audit Report of NMM at 30 September 2002, Exh.

The Claimants' position**\n------------------------------\n\n348.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, but for Bolivia's expropriation of the concessions, they would have enjoyed the economic benefits of those concessions during at least forty further years. This duration is based on an estimate of the reserves and resources of ulexite in the mining concessions established by the Claimants' mining expert, Behre Dolbear.393 Indeed, the concessions were not granted for a limited number of years but for the exploitation of the available mining resources.394\n\nBehre Dolbear, First ER, \u00b6\u00b6 128-147.\n\n*See* Art. 10 of the Mining Code (Exh. CD-6): \"The mining concession grants its titleholder, subject to the payment of mining fees, an exclusive right *in rem* to carry out for an indefinite time prospection, exploration, exploitation, concentration, smelting, refining and commercialization activities regarding all the mineral substances found it that concession,\" Tribunal's translation. The original reads: \"La concesi\u00f3n minera otorga a su titular y con la condici\u00f3n del pago de patentes, el derecho real y exclusivo de realizar por tiempo indefinido actividades de prospecci\u00f3n, exploraci\u00f3n, explotaci\u00f3n, concentraci\u00f3n, fundici\u00f3n, refinaci\u00f3n y comercializaci\u00f3n de todas las substancias minerales que se encuentren en ella [\u2026]\".\n\n349.\n\nThe Claimants rebut the Respondent's criticisms regarding the valuation of the reserves, and in particular the argument that they did not differentiate between reserves and resources, of which only the former has economic value according to Bolivia. The Claimants submit that both reserves and resources should be taken into account in the evaluation of the concessions and that the assessment carried out by Navigant and Behre Dolbear is correct from both an economic and industry practice perspective.395\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 402-418.\n\n350.\n\nAccording to the projection provided by Behre Dolbear, proven and probable reserves and indicated resources (the latter factored downward by 50 percent) on the Do\u00f1a Juanita, Borateras de Cuevitas and Basilea concessions totaled 5.02 million tonnes.396 As for the remaining concessions (Inglaterra, Sur, Don David, Tete, La Negra and Pococho), Behre Dolbear came up with an estimate of 1.26 Mt inferred resources (factored downward by 75 percent).397\n\nBehre Dolbear, First ER, \u00b6 128-133; Second ER, \u00b6\u00b6 27, 65.\n\nBehre Dolbear First ER, \u00b6\u00b6 128-137; Second ER, \u00b6 27. Although in its first report Behre Dolbear only refers to these as \"resources,\" in its second report it clarifies that they are to be considered \"Inferred Resources\" (Behre Dolbear, Second ER, \u00b6\u00b6 27, 69-70).\n\n351.\n\nNavigant, the Claimants' economic expert, has attributed value to the reserves and resources in the mining concessions that have commercial value following Behre Dolbear's estimate. The Claimants contend that, to put them back in the position in which they would have been had the expropriation not occurred, this valuation must be calculated on the date of the Award, *i.e.*, under an *ex post* approach. Their claim is therefore calculated using 30 June 2013 as a proxy for the date of the Award. However, for comparative purposes, they also provide an *ex ante* calculation.398\n\nNavigant, First ER, \u00b6\u00b6 108-166; Navigant, Second ER, \u00b6\u00b6 155-156.\n\n352.\n\nAs explained by Navigant, total damages under the *ex post* approach are calculated under a four-step process:399\n\na. First, the foregone (*i.e.*, past) cash flows are calculated for years 2004 to 2013, using all information available as of 30 June 2013 (the valuation date). The lost cash flows for this period amount to US$ 57,709,382.400\n\nb. Second, pre-award interest is added to these cash flows, \"such that these cash flows can all be summed as of a single date.\"401 As a result, all past cash flows are adjusted for pre-award interest to 30 June 2013. In accordance with Art. VI.2 of the BIT, which establishes that \"interest will accumulate at a commercially established rate,\"402 Navigant proposes two alternative interest rates: the Bolivian sovereign debt rate and LIBOR + 2%, both on a compound basis. Applying these interest rates, the present value of the lost cash flows for years 2004 to 2013 amounts to either US$ 65,974,958 or US$ 60,322,185.403\n\nc. Third, Navigant calculates projected cash flows from 2013-2037 (which reflects the time period following the Award during which the Claimants estimate the reserves in the concessions to last). It then applies a discount rate of 10.78% (equivalent to the 2013 Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC) as calculated by Navigant404), in order to bring the cash flows back to present value on 30 June 2013. The result of this calculation is US$ 80,137,484.405\n\nd. Fourth, the sum of the present value of the past cash flows (b. above) is added to the net present value of cash flow projected after 30 June 2013 (c. above). Depending on the interest rate used to adjust past cash flows, the total amount of damages under the *ex post* method is calculated at US$ 146,112,442 or US$ 140,459,669 respectively.406\n\nNavigant, First ER, \u00b6\u00b6 167-216; Navigant, Second ER, \u00b6\u00b6 157-160.\n\nNavigant, Second ER, \u00b6 157, table 9.\n\nNavigant, First ER, \u00b6 1\n\nClaimants' translation.\n\nNavigant, Second ER, \u00b6\u00b6 158-159, tables 10 and 11.\n\nNavigant, Second ER, Exh. E.2 and F. [In its first report, Navigant calculated the 2009 WACC at 14.61%. *See* Navigant, First ER, \u00b6 215).\n\nNavigant, First ER, \u00b6\u00b6 189-215; Navigant, Second ER, \u00b6 160.\n\nNavigant, Second ER, \u00b6 160, table 12.\n\n353.\n\nWhile the Claimants admit that Behre Dolbear has not been able to confirm the exact amount of reserves and resources of the concessions, they submit that both Behre Dolbear's and Navigant's calculations are in line with acceptable industry standards.407 More specifically, with respect to Navigant's DCF calculation, the Claimants maintain that:\n\na. The discount rate used by Navigant to bring the projected cash flows back to present value (equivalent to 10.78%) is reasonable, as it is based on the WACC of the Claimants' investments.\n\nb. The currencies used are in accordance with standard practice. The Claimants note that the revenues related to the concessions are earned in U.S. dollars, but costs are predominantly incurred in Bolivian currency. Taking this into account, and since the valuation must be built into a single currency, Navigant has converted the forecast cash flows in Bolivianos (Bs), while the Respondent's expert chose to carry out the DCF analysis in U.S. dollars. Nevertheless, the Claimants point out that \"the choice of currency is largely irrelevant, particularly if purchasing power parity (\"PPP\") is employed as suggested by Dr. Flores [of Econ One].\"408\n\nReply, \u00b6 411.\n\nNavigant, Second ER, \u00b6 55.\n\n354.\n\nThe Claimants also deny that Decree 27,590 had any effect on their *ex post* valuation. Although Decree 27,590, which was issued on the day of the expropriation and entered into force on 23 September 2004, did prohibit the export of non-industrialized non-metallic minerals, this Decree was abrogated by Decree 27,799 issued on 20 October 2004.409\n\nTr., Day 1, 6-8; COSS, slide 27; Exh. CD-195.\n\n355.\n\nFor the purposes of comparison, the Claimants also submit the FMV of their investment using the *ex ante* valuation method with a result of US$ 61,681,329 or US$ 49,641,600, depending on which pre-award interest rate (Bolivian sovereign debt rate or LIBOR + 2%) is applied.410\n\nNavigant, Second ER, table 8.\n\n**b. The Respondent's position**\n--------------------------------\n\n**i. Valuation under the sunk costs method**\n--------------------------------------------\n\n356.\n\nApplying the sunk costs method, the Respondent contends that the value of the mining concessions in June 2004 should be similar to the value which the Claimants invested in 2001, minus (as required by the BIT) the depreciation of the invested capital and the capital repatriated up to that date.\n\n357.\n\nAccording to the Respondent's economic expert, Econ One, the Claimants invested amounts of US$ 800,000411 and repatriated US$ 177,508.412 Accordingly, the difference (US$ 622,492) is the Claimants' net investment and the maximum amount to which they are entitled in accordance with the Treaty and international law.\n\nEcon One, First ER, Section IV(B). This refers to the total value of the concessions. Econ One states that Quiborax's share is 50% of that value (Econ One, First ER, \u00b6\u00b6 159, 161). In fact, the Tribunal has established that Quiborax owns approximately 51% of NMM (*see* \u00b6 18 above).\n\nEcon One, First ER, Section IV(C).\n\n**ii. Valuation under the DCF method**\n--------------------------------------\n\n358.\n\nIf the Tribunal were to favor the DCF method, the Respondent submits that the Claimants have applied it incorrectly, thus exaggerating their claim.\n\n359.\n\nFirst, the Respondent argues that Quiborax is not the international player it claims to be and that the loss of concessions did not have a significant impact on its production. Contrary to what the Claimants allege, Quiborax is not and never has been the first producer of borates in South America, let alone the fourth producer worldwide. Quiborax also exaggerates when it claims that the loss of the concessions caused the loss of its agricultural business, because (i) Quiborax's main activity is not the sale of agrochemical products but the sale of boric acid; (ii) it did not have an important market for agrochemical products, and (iii) the loss of the mining concessions did not prevent Quiborax from continuing the production of agrochemical products. According to the Respondent, Quiborax did not depend exclusively on Bolivian resources and could continue its production of agrochemical products without them.\n\n360.\n\nSecond, the Respondent further contends that the Claimants and their economic expert have oversimplified their assessment of ulexite reserves and resources and inflated the levels of ulexite in the concessions as a consequence. For the Respondent, Navigant ignores Behre Dolbear's distinction between reserves and resources and thus assigns economic value to alleged reserves that not even Behre Dolbear has included in its assessment. The value of the concessions should be calculated exclusively on the basis of proved and probable reserves based on Aquater-EniChem's field work and not on the basis of extrapolations that speculate on possible quantities of ulexite that remain unconfirmed.\n\n361.\n\nThird, the Respondent and its expert Econ One also submit that the Claimants have inflated their revenue projections, due to the following flaws in Navigant's calculations:\n\na. Navigant has used the different currencies inconsistently, applying different exchange rates with the sole purpose of artificially inflating the FMV.\n\nb. While Econ One agrees that the discount rate should be based on the WACC, it argues that Navigant has underestimated the WACC considerably. The discount rate should be 22.99%, as opposed to the rate proposed by Navigant, which Econ One characterizes as unreasonable.413\n\nEcon One, First ER, \u00b6\u00b6 121-149; Second ER, \u00b6\u00b6 133-200.\n\n362.\n\nFinally, the Respondent contends that the investment should be valued on a date immediately prior to the expropriation, as set out in Article VI(2) of the BIT. As discussed in more detail below, there is no justification for moving the date of valuation to 2013. In addition, the Claimants' *ex post* valuation ignores the economic effects of Decree 27,590, which prohibited the export of non-industrialized nonmetallic minerals.\n\n363.\n\nHaving corrected Navigant's conceptual errors, Econ One estimates that the FMV of the concessions on 22 June 2004 (*i.e.* one day before the alleged expropriation), applying the DCF method, is US$ 2.1 million.414 In Bolivia's view, this sum is reasonable, considering the price (US$ 400,000) at which the Ugalde brothers sold 50% of their participation in the seven concessions that surround the area explored by Aquater-EniChem, and the resulting internal rate of return of 44%.\n\nEcon One, First ER, \u00b6 153; Second ER, \u00b6 201.\n\n**c. Analysis**\n---------------\n\n364.\n\nHaving found that DCF is the appropriate valuation method, the Tribunal will now determine the variables and assumptions to be used for purposes of the DCF computation. It will start with the valuation date (i), then review the projected cash flows, taking into account the alleged reserves and resources (ii) and the Claimants' projected production profile (iii). It will then assess the forecast of ulexite prices and costs (iv) and determine the discount rate to be applied (v), before setting out its conclusions (vi). The Tribunal has reached its conclusions in this Section VII.A.4.c by majority, Arbitrator Stern dissenting in accordance with her Partially Dissenting Opinion. Hence, references to the Tribunal in this section must be understood as references to the majority.\n\n**i. Valuation date**\n---------------------\n\n365.\n\nThe Claimants maintain that, in order to fully repair the damages which they suffered as a consequence of Bolivia's unlawful expropriation, the FMV of the investment should be established *ex post*, that is, on the date of the Award.\n\n366.\n\nThe Claimants argue that *ex post* valuation allows the Tribunal to calculate the damages actually suffered by them taking into account all available information. According to the Claimants, \"if damages are the result of unlawful acts, as in the present case, the risk that the investment would have turned out more profitable than could have been foreseen at the time of expropriation, must be allocated to the wrongdoer, and not to the investor.\"415 Relying on ICSID cases and scholarly writings, the Claimants argue that an *ex post* assessment is appropriate when the value of the expropriated undertaking has increased following the unlawful act.416\n\nMem., \u00b6 195.\n\nRipinsky Sergey, Williams, Kevin, Damages in International Investment Law, British Institute of Intemational Law and Comparative Law (2008), pp. 242-259, Exh. CL-27.\n\n367.\n\nIn addition, they submit that *ex post* valuation is more accurate since it requires projections of future cash flows over a shorter duration.417 As a result, it addresses the Respondent's concern for the \"reasonable certainty\" of the Claimants' lost profits better than *ex ante* valuation.\n\nMem., \u00b6 198.\n\n368.\n\nThe Claimants explain Navigant's *ex post* valuation as follows:\n\nLike the tribunal in *Amco*, Navigant divides the period of valuation in two: (i) from the date of the expropriation to the date of the award (or current date), and (ii) from the date of the award (or current date) until the end of the life of the Concessions. The value of the Concessions during the first (past) period is calculated *ex post*, using all information available as of current date. The second (future) period is valued as of [the] current date, using the DCF method. Hence, the *ex post* valuation combines two different valuation methods for two different time periods, marked by the date of the award.418\n\nReply, \u00b6 392, referring to *Amco Asia Corporation and others v. Republic of Indonesia*, ICSID Case No. ARB/81/8 (\" *Amco II* \"), Final Award of 5 June 1990, Yearbook of Commercial Arbitration XVII (1992), \u00b6\u00b6 96-105.\n\n369.\n\nThe Respondent, on the other hand, rejects an *ex post* valuation. It argues that, even if the Tribunal were to accept the valuation method postulated by the Claimants and \"deem that Bolivia should compensate the Claimants for the equivalent of the FMV of the mining concessions,\" it should decide that \"this value should be calculated at the date of the expropriation.\"419 In the Respondent's view, there are no reasons to justify setting the valuation date after the date of the alleged expropriation of the concessions. To the contrary, it argues that the Claimants' *ex post* valuation should be dismissed for the following reasons:420\n\na. First, it is contrary to the BIT and to international case law. Article VI(2) of the BIT provides that the FMV of the investment shall be calculated on the date of the expropriation. The Respondent agrees with the Claimants that payment of compensation pursuant to Article VI(2) of the BIT is a condition for the lawfulness of the expropriation, but argues that this does not mean that it does not fully repair the damage suffered by the investor. The Respondent cites several international tribunals which held that the FMV on the date of the expropriation provided appropriate compensation for unlawful expropriation (e.g., *Wena Hotels v. Egypt*, *Middle East Cement v. Egypt*, *Sedelmayer v. Russia*, *Tecmed v. Mexico* and *Metalclad v. Mexico*).\n\nb. Second, *ex post* valuation is arbitrary and speculative. The date of the award has nothing to do with the facts of the case. The date of expropriation is the only one that is objectively related to the dispute.\n\nc. Third, the decisions cited by the Claimants are inapplicable to the present case. In *Phillips Petroleum v. Iran* and *Siemens v. Argentina*, the tribunals valued the investment on the date of the expropriation. In *ADC v. Hungary* and *Amco II*, the tribunals did indeed adopt an *ex post* valuation, but neither of these cases is applicable here.\n\nd. Fourth, the Claimants' position lacks coherence. They accept that the compensation should be the equivalent of the FMV of the concessions, defined as the price that a hypothetical willing buyer and an able seller would have agreed. Hence, the FMV must necessarily be calculated on a certain date taking into account the information available on that date.\n\nCounter-Mem., \u00b6 354, Tribunal's translation.\n\nCounter-Mem., \u00b6\u00b6 335-354.\n\n370.\n\nThe Tribunal has already held that the standard of compensation in this case is not the one set forth in Article VI(2) of the BIT, but the full reparation principle under customary international law as enunciated by the PCIJ in *Chorz\u00f3w* and restated in Article 31 of the ILC Articles, because it is faced with an expropriation that is unlawful not merely because compensation is lacking (*see* paragraphs 326-327 above). As explained in the following paragraphs, the majority of the Tribunal considers that this requires an *ex post* valuation, *i.e.*, valuing the damage on the date of the award and taking into consideration information available then.\n\n371.\n\nThe majority has arrived at this conclusion after carefully analyzing the PCIJ's reasoning in *Chorz\u00f3w*. As is in the present case, *Chorz\u00f3w* dealt with an expropriation where the wrongful act of the expropriating State was not limited to the lack of payment of compensation.421 The Court held that the compensation to be awarded in these cases \"is not necessarily limited to the value of the undertaking at the moment of the dispossession, plus interest to the day of payment. This limitation would only be admissible if the Polish Government had the right to expropriate, and if its wrongful act consisted merely in not having paid to the two Companies the just price of what was expropriated.\"422 According to the Court, a contrary conclusion would be \"tantamount to rendering lawful liquidation and unlawful dispossession indistinguishable in so far as their financial results are concerned.\"423\n\nThe PCIJ held that \"[t]he action of Poland which the Court has judged to be contrary to the Geneva Convention is not an expropriation to render which lawful only the payment of fair compensation would have been wanting; it is a seizure of property, rights and interests which could not be expropriated even against compensation, save under the exceptional conditions fixed by Article 7 of the said Convention.\" *Factory at Chorz\u00f3w*, Germany v. Polish Republic, PCIJ Series A, No. 17, Judgment on Merits, 13 September 1928, p. 46.\n\n*Loc. cit.,* p. 47.\n\n*Loc. cit.*\n\n372.\n\nRather, on the basis that \"reparation must, as far as possible, wipe out all the consequences of the illegal act and re-establish the situation which would, in all probability, have existed if that act had not been committed,\"424 the Court concluded that an unlawful expropriation425 \"involves the obligation to restore the undertaking and, if this be not possible, to pay its value *at the time of the indemnification*, which value is designed to take the place of restitution which has become impossible.\"426\n\n*Loc. cit.*\n\nThe Court refers to \"[t]he dispossession of an industrial undertaking - the expropriation of which is prohibited by the Geneva Convention - [...].\" *Loc. cit.,* pp. 47-48.\n\n*Loc. cit.*, p. 48 (emphasis added).\n\n373.\n\nWhen it came to determining \"what sum must be awarded [...] to place the dispossessed Companies as far as possible in the economic situation in which they would probably have been if the seizure had not taken place,\"427 the Court found itself dissatisfied with the data supplied by the parties. It thus ordered an expert inquiry. The questions the Court asked the expert are enlightening for present purposes: it asked for two valuations, one based on the asset value of the undertaking on the date of the taking plus any additional profits accrued until the date of the judgment (Question I),428 and another based on the asset value of the undertaking on the date of the judgment (Question II).429 The Court explained that the purpose of the first question was \"to determine the monetary value, both of the object which should have been restored in kind and of the additional damage, on the basis of the estimated value of the undertaking including stocks at the moment of taking possession by the Polish Government, together with any probable profit that would have accrued to the undertaking between the date of taking possession and that of the expert opinion.\"430 The purpose of the second question, on the other hand, was to ascertain \"the present value [of the undertaking] on the basis of the situation at the moment of the expert enquiry and leaving aside the situation presumed to exist in 1922.\"431\n\n*Loc. cit.*, p. 49.\n\nIn Question I, the Court requested the expert to establish the value of the undertaking on the date of the expropriation on the basis of its assets, as well as the financial results (profits or losses) that would have accrued from the date of the taking to the date of the judgment. It did so in the following terms: \"I.- A. What was the value, on July 3rd, 1922, expressed in Reichsmarks current at the present time, of the undertaking for the manufacture of nitrate products of which the factory was situated at Chorzow in Polish Upper Silesia, in the state in which that undertaking (including the lands, buildings, equipment, stocks and processes at its disposal, supply and delivery contracts, goodwill and future prospects) was, on the date indicated, in the hands of the Bayerische and Oberschlesische Stickstoffwerke?  \n B. What would have been the financial results, expressed in Reichsmarks current at the present time (profits or losses), which would probably have been given by the undertaking thus constituted from July 3rd, 1922, to the date of the present judgment, if it had been in the hands of the said Companies?\" *Loc. cit*, p. 51.\n\nIn Question II, the Court requested the expert to establish the value of the undertaking on the date of the judgment if that undertaking (considering all of its assets) had remained in the hands of the dispossessed companies and had either remained substantially as it had been on the date of the taking or had developed in a similar fashion as other undertakings of the same kind. It did so in the following terms: \"II.- What would be the value at the date of the present judgment, expressed in Reichsmarks current at the present time, of the same undertaking (Chorzow) if that undertaking (including lands, buildings, equipment, stocks, available processes, supply and delivery contracts, goodwill and future prospects) had remained in the hands of the Bayerische and Oberschlesische Stickstoffwerke, and had either remained substantially as it was in 1922 or had been developed proportionately on lines similar to those applied in the case of other undertakings of the same kind, controlled by the Bayerische, for instance, the undertaking of which the factory is situated at Piesteritz?\" *Loc. cit.,* pp. 51-52.\n\nLoc. cit., p. 52.\n\nLoc. cit., p. 52.\n\n374.\n\nBoth of these valuations have the same purpose: to establish the value of the losses suffered by the dispossessed companies on the date of the Court's judgment, either by (i) assessing the value of the undertaking on the date of the taking plus any lost profits accrued between the taking and the judgment, or (ii) assessing the value of the undertaking on the date of the judgment. Although the Court was using an asset-based valuation rather than a DCF method,432 the purpose of the exercise is clear: either valuation would have allowed the Court to award the dispossessed companies the value of their losses on the date of the judgment.\n\nHad the Court been using the DCF method rather than an asset-based method, it would have valued the undertaking on the basis of its future profit-making capacity.\n\n375.\n\nNotably, the Court retained full discretion in determining the sum to be awarded. Indeed, after noting the difficulties raised by these two questions, \"difficulties which are however inherent in the special case under consideration, and closely connected with the time that elapsed between the dispossession and the demand for compensation, and with the transformations of the factory and the progress made in the industry with which the factory is concerned,\"433 the Court adopted the following approach:\n\nIn view of these difficulties, the Court considers it preferable to endeavor to ascertain the value to be estimated by several methods, in order to permit of a comparison and if necessary of completing the results of the one by those of the others. The Court, therefore, reserves every right to review the valuations referred to in the different formulae; basing itself on the results of the said valuations and of facts and documents submitted to it, it will then proceed to determine the sum to be awarded to the German Government, in conformity with the legal principles set out above.434\n\n*Loc. cit.,* p. 53.\n\n*Loc. cit.,* p. 53-54.\n\n376.\n\nThe *Chorz\u00f3w* case settled after this judgment and history does not tell us how the Court would have assessed the two valuations and set the amount of damages. This being so, what matters here is, first, that the *Court envisaged two valuations, which were both aimed at establishing the damage* suffered by the dispossessed companies on the date of the judgment. What matters further is that the Court considered itself to have *full discretion* (\"every right') *to assess the valuations* for purposes of determining the sum to be awarded,435 with the obvious aim of implementing the general principle it had set out earlier in the same judgment, which is *to award full reparation* of the harm caused by the unlawful expropriation.\n\n*Loc. cit.,* p. 53.\n\n377.\n\nThe Tribunal thus concludes by majority that, dealing with an expropriation that is unlawful not merely because compensation is lacking, its task is to quantify the losses suffered by the claimant on the date of the award (or on a proxy for that date). This is easily explained by a reference to restitution: damages stand in lieu of restitution which would take place just following the award or judgment. It is also easy to understand if one keeps in mind that what must be repaired is the actual harm done, as opposed to the value of the asset when taken.\n\n378.\n\nSeveral investment arbitration tribunals,436 other adjudicatory bodies (such as the European Court of Human Rights),437 and scholars438 have followed this approach. Some authorities also suggest that such valuation date only applies if the value of the asset increased after the taking, not when it decreased.439 Here, this issue does not arise and hence can be left open. Indeed, as is explained below, the Claimants have shown that the value of their investments would have increased after expropriation.\n\n*See, e.g.*, *ADC v. Hungary*, Award of 2 October 2006, \u00b6 497; *ConocoPhillips Petrozuata B.V., Conocophillips Hamaca B.V. and Conocophillips Gulf of Paria B.V. v.

Russia*, Final Award of 18 July 2014, \u00b6\u00b6 1763-1769. In *Amco II*, although not a BIT case, an ICSID tribunal chaired by Rosalyn Higgins equated a denial of justice arising from the revocation of a license to an unlawful taking of contract rights and awarded damages valued on the date of the award (*see Amco II*, \u00b6\u00b6 94-105). *See also* *Siemens A.G. v. Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/02/8, Award of 6 February 2007, \u00b6\u00b6 352-353, where the tribunal endorsed the view that the principle of full reparation required awarding the value of the investment on the date of the award, but was ultimately guided by the claimant's request for relief, which sought the book value of the investment at the time of the expropriation plus lost profits and other consequential damages arisen thereafter (*see* *Siemens*, \u00b6\u00b6 322-389). The majority notes that this approach serves the same purpose as valuing the investment on the date of the award (*see* \u00b6 374 supra).\n\n*See, e.g.*, *Amoco International Finance Corp. v.

The applicable differential method requires assessing the difference between the financial situation of the person affected and the financial situation he or she would be in, if the expropriation had not taken place. This comparison is made on the day of the judgment or award. It follows that the decisive valuation date is the date of the award.\") *See also* M.

Schwarzenberger, International Law as Applied by International Courts and Tribunals, Vol. 1 (Stevens & Sons Limited, London 1957), p. 666 (\"[m]uch is to be said in favour of the date of the judgment as the operative date. It is the judgment or award which establishes between the parties with binding force that reparation is due from one party to the other. If restitution in kind were possible, it would have to take place as soon as possible after the judgment or award. It, therefore, appears appropriate that the amount of any monetary substitute for actual restitution should be related to the same date.\").\n\n*See, e.g.*, *Yukos v. Russia*, PCA Case No. AA 227, Final Award of 18 July 2014, \u00b6 1768.\n\n379.\n\nIn the majority's opinion, assessing the value of the investment on the date of the award (taking the date of the most recent valuation as a proxy) allows the Tribunal to take into consideration *ex post* data, *i.e.*, information available after the date of the expropriation. Its task is to compensate the Claimants' actual loss on the date of the award. What matters is that the victim of the harm is placed in the situation in which it would have been in real life, not more, not less. Using actual information is better suited for this purpose than projections based on information available on the date of the expropriation, as it allows to better reflect reality (including market fluctuations) when attempting to \"re-establish the situation which would, in all probability, have existed if that act had not been committed.\"440\n\n*Factory at Chorz\u00f3w*, Merits, 1928, P.C.I.J., Series A, No. 17, p. 47.\n\n380.\n\nThe distinction between damage computation for an unlawful taking as opposed to a lawful one was well put in *Amco II* :\n\nIf the purpose of compensation is to put Amco in the position it would have been in had it received the benefits of the Profit-Sharing Agreement, then there is no reason of logic that requires that to be done by reference only to data that would have been known to a prudent businessman in 1980. It may, on one view, be the case that in a lawful taking, Amco would have been entitled to the fair market value of the contract at the moment of dispossession. In making such a valuation, a Tribunal in 1990 would necessarily exclude factors subsequent to 1980. But if Amco is to be placed as if the contract had remained in effect, then subsequent known factors bearing on that performance are to be reflected in the valuation technique. [\u2026].\"441\n\n*See Amco II*, \u00b6 96. *See also* Marboe, Compensation and Damages in International Law The Limits of \"Fair Market Value\" Vol. 4, issue 6, November 2007, p. 753 (\"It follows, thus, from the principle of full reparation as formulated by the PCIJ in *Chorz\u00f3w Factory*, that the valuation is not normally limited to the perspective of the date of the illegal act or some other date in the past. An increase in value of the valuation object, consequential damage, subsequent events and information, at least up until the date of the judgment or award, must be taken into account in the evaluation of damages.\").\n\n381.\n\nIt could be argued that *ex post* valuation or data should not be used because it was unforeseeable on the date of the breach. As the majority has asked itself this question and it is discussed in the dissenting opinion of Arbitrator Stern, it is briefly addressed here.\n\n382.\n\nThe harm for which reparation is sought must be caused by the wrongful act. It is generally accepted that factual causation is not sufficient. An additional element linked to the nature of the cause, sometimes called \"cause in law\"442 or adequate causation443 is required. It is in this context that foreseeability is sometimes resorted to. The Commentary to Article 31 to the ILC Articles expresses this additional requirement for an adequate cause as follows:\n\n[C]ausality in fact is a necessary but not a sufficient condition for reparation. There is a further element, associated with the exclusion of injury that is too \"remote\" or \"consequential\" to be the subject of reparation. In some cases, the criterion of \"directness\" may be used, in others \"foreseeability\" or \"proximity.\"444\n\nVivienne Harpwood, Modern Tort Law, Cavendish Publishing 6th Edition, p. 157.\n\n*Lighthouses Arbitration*, France v. Greece, 24/27 July 1956, XII RIAA 155, p. 218 (\"Tout lien ad\u00e9quat de causalit\u00e9 fait d\u00e9faut et dans ces conditions le chef de r\u00e9clamation n\u00b0 19 doit \u00eatre rejet\u00e9.\")\n\nILC Articles, Article 31, Commentary 10.\n\n383.\n\nIn other words, a wrongful act may cause a particular damage as a matter of fact. However, if the factual link between the act and the damage is composed of an atypical chain of events that could objectively not have been foreseen to ensue from the act, the damage may not be recoverable. It can be left open here whether the requirement of legal causation limits only the categories of damages claimed, *e.g.* lost profits, or whether it also goes to the magnitude (certainly not the precise amount) of the loss within a given category.445 What matters in any event is that the wrongful act was objectively capable of causing the damage incurred in the ordinary course of events. Subject possibly to special circumstances, the expropriation of a going concern appears objectively capable of causing the loss of future profits which may fluctuate according to the evolution of the economy and the market. If one focuses on foreseeability in this context, then it is equally clear that losses of future profits determined by the fluctuations of the market are objectively foreseeable. As a result, the majority is satisfied that the test of foreseeability (to the extent that it is deemed part of causation) is met in the circumstances before it.\n\n*Amco II*, \u00b6 174 (\"[F]oreseeability goes to causation and damages, and normally not the quantum of profit. That the revocation of the license would cause Amco to be unable to secure its share of the profits under the Profit-Sharing Agreement was undoubtedly foreseeable. The principle of foreseeability does not require that the party causing the loss is at that moment of time able to foresee the precise quantum of the loss actually sustained.\")\n\n384.\n\nIn this context, the Respondent argues that the Claimants' FMV calculation is impossible, as they \"envision a hypothetical buyer at the date of the expropriation that would know the economic evolution following that date.\"446 Yet, the task here is not to establish the FMV of the investment on the date of the expropriation, but rather to remedy the consequences of the unlawful act. For that purpose, the Tribunal considers by majority that the use of *ex post* data allows it to value the Claimants' loss with increased precision. At the same time, the Tribunal must value the loss with reasonable certainty.447 If the available *ex post* data is not reasonably certain, then it will have no choice but to resort to appropriately adjusted *ex ante* data (*i.e.*, data available at the date of the expropriation).\n\nCounter-Mem., \u00b6 352, Tribunal's translation.\n\nArticle 36(2) of the ILC Articles provides that \"compensation shall cover any financially assessable damage including loss of profits insofar as it is established.\" *See also* M.M. Whiteman, Damages in International Law, Vol. 3 (1937), p. 1837 (\"In order to be allowable, prospective profits must not be too speculative, contingent, uncertain, and the like. There must be proof that they were reasonably anticipated; and that the profits anticipated were probable and not merely possible. If the evidence shows that there is doubt that profits would have been realized if the wrongful act had not occurred, damages will be disallowed.\") *See also*, *Asian Agricultural Products LTD (AAPL) v.

Consequently, they would have collected cash flows for their mining activities until today, and would have had the right to continue collecting them until the depletion of the concessions. Since some cash flows lie in the past and others in the future, different computations apply to each category, as the Claimants' expert has done.448 Past cash flows, *i.e.*, cash flows that would have accrued from the date of the expropriation to 30 June 2013 (which is the date of Navigant's latest calculations) must be brought forward to present value through the application of an interest rate. By contrast, future cash flows must be discounted back to net present value through the application of a discount rate.\n\nReply, \u00b6 392, footnote omitted.\n\n386.\n\nThe Tribunal will apply the principles so determined when quantifying the Claimants' damages, with the specifications set out in the following sections.\n\n**ii. Effects of Decree 27,590**\n--------------------------------\n\n387.\n\nThe Respondent's expert maintains that the Claimants' *ex post* valuation should be denied all validity because it ignores the economic effects of Decree 27,590.449 Decree 27,590, which was issued on the day of the expropriation, prohibited the export of non-industrialized non-metallic minerals after a transitory period of 90 days (*i.e.*, as of 24 September 2004). Econ One argues that, as the Claimants did not have plants or equipment in Bolivia allowing for the chemical industrialization of ulexite, they would have had to stop exporting ulexite from Bolivia after that date. Indeed, the Claimants have acknowledged that they stopped exporting ulexite on 24 September 2004.450 For the Respondent, this renders the *ex post* valuation invalid.\n\nExh. NCI-58.\n\nReply, \u00b6 94.\n\n388.\n\nThe Claimants deny that Decree 27,590 had any effect on their *ex post* valuation. Although Decree 27,590, did prohibit the export of non-industrialized non-metallic minerals, it was abrogated by Decree 27,799 issued on October 20, 2004.451\n\nTr., Day 1, 6-8; COSS, slide 27; Exh. CD-195.\n\n389.\n\nArticle 6(ii) of Decree 27,799 of 20 October 2004 clearly states that \"Supreme Decree No. 27,590 of 23 June 2004 is abrogated.\"452 The Decree does not specify a date, so the Tribunal understands that the abrogation was immediate. This means that the prohibition to export non-industrialized ulexite was in place from 21 September to 20 October 2004, *i.e.*, about one month. In the Tribunal's view, this has no effect on the Claimants' valuation method: the ulexite extracted during the period in which the prohibition was in place could be exported when that prohibition was lifted.\n\nExh. CD-195.\n\n390.\n\nThe Respondent argued during the hearing that Decree 27,799 was in turn revoked in 2008, but did not submit evidence to support this assertion.453 In addition, the Claimants have shown that there were significant exports of ulexite from Bolivia to Brazil between 2003 and 2012,454 which shows that there was no effective export ban in place during those years.\n\nTr., Day 1, 12-15.\n\nExh. CD-196.\n\n391.\n\nIn view of the foregoing, the Tribunal finds that the enactment of Decree 27,590 does not invalidate the Claimants' damages claim.\n\n**iii. Cash flows: reserves and resources**\n-------------------------------------------\n\n392.\n\nThe duration of the concessions was not limited. Their useful life must therefore be determined by the quantity of exploitable minerals. Consequently, the Tribunal must assess such quantity. For that, it must determine which categories of mineral reserves and resources have an economic value and determine such value.\n\n*(a) Mining and financial standards*\n------------------------------------\n\n393.\n\nThe Tribunal understands from the materials on record that the mining industry has developed uniform definitions of mineral reserves and resources.455 The Tribunal has in particular considered the \"Definition Standards for Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves\" prepared by the Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum (CIM). These standards divide *mineral resources* into \"inferred,\" \"indicated,\" and \"measured\" in an increasing order of confidence in their estimation:\n\nMineral Resources are sub-divided, in order of increasing geological confidence, into Inferred, Indicated and Measured categories. An Inferred Mineral Resource has a lower level of confidence than that applied to an Indicated Mineral Resource. An Indicated Mineral Resource has a higher level of confidence than an Inferred Mineral Resource but has a lower level of confidence than a Measured Mineral Resource.\n\nA Mineral Resource is a concentration or occurrence of diamonds, natural solid inorganic material, or natural solid fossilized organic material including base and precious metals, coal, and industrial minerals in or on the Earth's crust in such form and quantity and of such a grade or quality that it has reasonable prospects for economic extraction. The location, quantity, grade, geological characteristics and continuity of a Mineral Resource are known, estimated or interpreted from specific geological evidence and knowledge.\n\n[...]\n\nAn \u2018Inferred Mineral Resource' is that part of a Mineral Resource for which quantity and grade or quality can be estimated on the basis of geological evidence and limited sampling and reasonably assumed, but not verified, geological and grade continuity. The estimate is based on limited information and sampling gathered through appropriate techniques from locations such as outcrops, trenches, pits, workings and drill holes.\n\n[\u2026]\n\nAn \u2018Indicated Mineral Resource' is that part of a Mineral Resource for which quantity, grade or quality, densities, shape and physical characteristics, can be estimated with a level of confidence sufficient to allow the appropriate application of technical and economic parameters, to support mine planning and evaluation of the economic viability of the deposit. The estimate is based on detailed and reliable exploration and testing information gathered through appropriate techniques from locations such as outcrops, trenches, pits, workings and drill holes that are spaced closely enough for geological and grade continuity to be reasonably assumed.\n\n[\u2026]\n\nA \u2018Measured Mineral Resource' is that part of a Mineral Resource for which quantity, grade or quality, densities, shape, and physical characteristics are so well established that they can be estimated with confidence sufficient to allow the appropriate application of technical and economic parameters, to support production planning and evaluation of the economic viability of the deposit. The estimate is based on detailed and reliable exploration, sampling and testing information gathered through appropriate techniques from locations such as outcrops, trenches, pits, workings and drill holes that are spaced closely enough to confirm both geological and grade continuity.456\n\n*See* Exhs. BD-8, BD-35, BD-36, BD-39 and R-375 to 385.\n\nExh. BD-35, emphasis removed.\n\n394.\n\n*Mineral reserves* as distinguished from resources are divided by the CIM between \"probable\" and \"proven\":\n\nMineral Reserves are sub-divided in order of increasing confidence into Probable Mineral Reserves and Proven Mineral Reserves. A Probable Mineral Reserve has a lower level of confidence than a Proven Mineral Reserve.\n\nA Mineral Reserve is the economically mineable part of a Measured or Indicated Mineral Resource demonstrated by at least a Preliminary Feasibility Study. This Study must include adequate information on mining, processing, metallurgical, economic and other relevant factors that demonstrate, at the time of reporting, that economic extraction can be justified. A Mineral Reserve includes diluting materials and allowances for losses that may occur when the material is mined.\n\n[\u2026]\n\nThe term \u2018Mineral Reserve' need not necessarily signify that extraction facilities are in place or operative or that all governmental approvals have been received. It does signify that there are reasonable expectations of such approvals.\n\n[\u2026]\n\nA \u2018Probable Mineral Reserve' is the economically mineable part of an Indicated and, in some circumstances, a Measured Mineral Resource demonstrated by at least a Preliminary Feasibility Study. This Study must include adequate information on mining, processing, metallurgical, economic, and other relevant factors that demonstrate, at the time of reporting, that economic extraction can be justified.\n\n[\u2026]\n\nA \u2018Proven Mineral Reserve' is the economically mineable part of a Measured Mineral Resource demonstrated by at least a Preliminary Feasibility Study. This Study must include adequate information on mining, processing, metallurgical, economic, and other relevant factors that demonstrate, at the time of reporting, that economic extraction is justified.457\n\nExh. BD-35, emphasis removed.\n\n395.\n\nRegarding reserves, the Claimants' industry expert, Behre Dolbear, relies on the standards set out by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Industry Guide 7 as follows:\n\nReserve. That part of a mineral deposit which could be economically and legally extracted or produced at the time of the reserve determination.\n\n[\u2026]\n\n*Proven (Measured) Reserves*. Reserves for which (a) quantity is computed from dimensions revealed in outcrops, trenches, workings or drill holes; grade and/or quality are computed from the results of detailed sampling and (b) the sites for inspection, sampling and measurement are spaced so closely and the geologic character is so well defined that size, shape, depth and mineral content of reserves are well-established.\n\n*Probable (Indicated) Reserves*. Reserves for which quantity and grade and/or quality are computed from information similar to that used for proven (measure) reserves, but the sites for inspection, sampling, and measurement are farther apart or are otherwise less adequately spaced. The degree of assurance, although lower than that for proven (measured) reserves, is high enough to assume continuity between points of observation.458\n\nExh. BD-8, emphasis in original.\n\n396.\n\nThe Parties' experts dispute whether all of the above categories can be assigned economic value. The Tribunal discusses below which of these categories can be considered to assess the value of the concessions.\n\n*(b) The Aquater-Enichem report*\n--------------------------------\n\n397.\n\nBoth Parties' experts have relied on the findings of the Aquater-Enichem report for the quantification of ulexite reserves in the Claimants' concessions. As explained in Section II above, in 1993 Italian companies Aquater S.p.a. and EniChem S.p.a., commissioned by the Bolivian government and sponsored by Italy, performed a grid-based study of the mineral reserves of a part of the fiscal reserve of the Salar de Uyuni.459 Three of the Claimants' concessions (Basilea, Borateras de Cuevitas and Do\u00f1a Juanita) are partly located inside this grid.\n\nExh. BD-4. This study was performed in two phases. In Phase 1, holes were drilled on a grid with 200 meters spacing within an area of 21.56 km2. In Phase 2, drilling was carried out on a closerspaced grid (100 meters) in an area of 7.2 km2.

Within those nine, Behre Dolbear distinguishes two subsets:\n\na. Concessions located within the area studied in the Aquater-EniChem report465 (Borateras de Cuevitas, Do\u00f1a Juanita and Basilea), and\n\nb. Concessions located outside that grid (Pococho, Tete, Inglaterra, Don David, Sur and La Negra).\n\nExh. BD-4.\n\n403.\n\nBehre Dolbear estimates that the concessions inside the Aquater-Enichem grid (Borateras de Cuevitas, Do\u00f1a Juanita and Basilea) \"hosted 790,000 tonnes of Proven Reserves of ulexite, 1,080,000 tonnes of Probable Reserves, and a factored 3,150,000 tonnes of Indicated Resources of ulexite466 for a total of 5.02 [million tonnes].\"467 This is illustrated at table 4.10 (page 38) of their first report:\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| Table 4.10 RESOURCES AND RESERVES IN CONCESSIONS DO\u00d1A JUANITA, BORATERAS DE CUEVITAS, AND BASILEA |\n| Category | Million Tonnes |\n| Proven Reserves | 0.79 |\n| Probable Reserves | 1.08 |\n| Indicated Resources | 3.15 |\n|  |\n| Total Reserves/Resources | 5.02 |\n\nFor its estimation of indicated resources inside the Aquater grid, Behre Dolbear took Aquater's estimate of \"possible reserves\" (6.3 million tonnes of ulexite) and reduced it by 50% (*i.e.*, 31.15 million tonnes of ulexite).\n\nBehre Dolbear, Second ER, \u00b6 65.\n\n404.\n\nBehre Dolbear does not estimate any \"possible reserves,\" because today no recognized code in the industry uses such a reserve classification.468 Rather, in accordance with international standards, Behre Dolbear computes this tonnage as an indicated resource.469\n\nBehre Dolbear, First ER, \u00b6\u00b6 9.\n\nBehre Dolbear, First ER, \u00b6\u00b6 131-133.\n\n405.\n\nBehre Dolbear also provides an estimate of inferred resources outside the Aquater-Enichem grid. Based on the sampling and drilling performed by Mr. Astudillo in 2000, interviews with Quiborax's personnel, and its own review of the thicknesses of borates in the drill holes around the boundary of the grid, Behre Dolbear believes that \"a professional examination would delineate additional ulexite equal to that currently delineated on the three concessions within the \u2018grid,' *i.e.*, another 5.02 million tonnes.\"470 Due to the uncertainty involved and in accordance with industry practice, Behre Dolbear \"categorize[s] these resources as Inferred Resources (those with the highest degree of uncertainty) and would factor the estimated 5.02 [million tonnes] downward by 75% to 1.26 [million tonnes] of Inferred Resources.\"471\n\nBehre Dolbear, First ER, \u00b6 135. *See also* Second ER, \u00b6 69.\n\nBehre Dolbear, Second ER, \u00b6 70.\n\n406.\n\nBehre Dolbear did not perform its own geological studies but relied on the existing reports (in particular, the Aquater-Enichem report) to arrive at this estimate. It explains that it \"was not able to make a site visit under the circumstances of the dispute,\" but \"[i]t considers that the data in the existing reports is sufficient for it to arrive at its estimates.\"472\n\nBehre Dolbear, First ER, \u00b6 128.\n\n407.\n\nAfter auditing Aquater-Enichem's methodology and arithmetic results,473 Behre Dolbear extrapolated its findings from actual drill hole data from that report \"using mining industry accepted techniques for bedded deposits of industrial minerals by extrapolating thicknesses from drill hole data and assigning, in this case for Phase 2 (Proven Reserves), 10,000m2 areas of influence around each hole in the 100m grid and 40,000m2 areas of influence around each hole in the case of the Phase 1 area (Probable Reserves).\"474 A simplified version of Behre Dolbear's methodology using Aquater's drill hole data is set out in figure 4.1 of its first report, as explained during the hearing:475\n\nThe diamond in the middle of each circle represents the Aquater-EniChem drill hole. The blue radius of 10,000 square metres is basically a 100m radius around the hole, or 200m diameter [...]. And that constitutes a proven reserve. The offshaded grey [...] is then the probable reserve based upon a 400m diameter or 200m radius, from the centre of the drill hole, and that is considered a probable reserve. And then anything that is in between and elsewhere around based upon the categorisation of possible reserve we considered an indicated resource.476\n\nTr., Day 2, 50:18-51:15; 53:23-55:12.\n\nBehre Dolbear, First ER, \u00b6 129.\n\nBehre Dolbear, First ER, figure 4.1, p. 36.\n\nTr. Day 2, 51:4-15.\n\n408.\n\nThe Respondent claims that \"Behre Dolbear's reports rely on methods rejected by the mining industry.\"477 It also argues that the value of the concessions should be calculated exclusively on the basis of the proved and probable reserves calculated by Aquater-Enichem, and should not include possible quantities of ulexite estimated on the basis of extrapolations and that remain unconfirmed.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 182, Tribunal's translation.\n\n*(d) The Tribunal's assessment of reserves and resources*\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n409.\n\nAs noted above, Behre Dolbear's estimate covers reserves and resources in the following concessions:\n\na. **Reserves and resources** in the concessions located within the Aquater-Enichem grid (Borateras de Cuevitas, Do\u00f1a Juanita and Basilea), and\n\nb. **Resources** in the concessions located outside that grid (Pococho, Tete, Inglaterra, Don David, Sur and La Negra).\n\n410.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that Bolivia's criticisms focus on Behre Dolbear's calculation of resources (both inside and outside the Aquater-Enichem grid), not reserves. Indeed, Econ One has implicitly accepted Behre Dolbear's estimate of proven and probable reserves in the Do\u00f1a Juanita, Borateras de Cuevitas and Basilea concessions and has relied on these figures to carry out its valuation: Mr. Flores of Econ One expressly stated that \"[i]n my valuation, I have taken the reserves - proven and probable -estimated by Behre Dolbear, excluding the resources.\"478\n\nEcon One, First ER, \u00b6 57, Tribunal's translation. *See also* Econ One, Second ER, \u00b6 63.\n\n411.\n\nThe Tribunal will therefore use the **reserve** estimates prepared by Behre Dolbear regarding the Do\u00f1a Juanita, Borateras de Cuevitas and Basilea concessions. Consequently, the value of the concessions will be assessed assuming proven reserves of 787,500 tonnes of ulexite (1,015,054 dry tonnes) and probable reserves of 1,081,900 tonnes of ulexite (1,394,571 dry tonnes), *i.e.*, total reserves of 1,869,400 tons (2,409,625 dry tonnes).479\n\nBehre Dolbear, First ER, \u00b6 129.\n\n412.\n\nWith respect to **resources**, the Claimants distinguish between those inside the Aquater-Enichem grid and those outside:\n\na. For the concessions located inside the grid (Do\u00f1a Juanita, Borateras de Cuevitas and Basilea), Behre Dolbear has taken Aquater-Enichem's estimate of \"possible reserves\" and classified them as \"indicated resources.\" In the expert's opinion, \"the Aquater-EniChem category of Possible Reserves, while acceptable at the time their report was issued, would be considered an Indicated Resource under current reporting codes.\"480 Behre Dolbear has thus taken Aquater-Enichem's \"possible reserves\" (6.3 million tonnes of ulexite) and reduced them by 50% (*i.e.*, 3.15 million tonnes of ulexite).481 According to the expert, the 50% cut \"is standard industry practice reflecting the probability that indicated resources upon further exploration and development will not convert in their entirety to a Reserve.\"482\n\nb. With respect to the concessions located outside the Aquater-Enichem grid, Behre Dolbear estimates 1.26 million tonnes of inferred (rather than indicated) resources. As noted in paragraph 405, this figure is not based on Aquater's estimate of \"possible reserves,\" but on the sampling and drilling performed by Mr. Astudillo in 2000, interviews with Quiborax's personnel, and the expert's own review of the thicknesses of borates in the drill holes around the boundary of the grid. On this basis, Behre Dolbear believes that the concessions outside the grid contain as much ulexite as those inside the grid,483 but due to the uncertainty involved and in accordance with industry practice, it categorizes them as inferred resources and factors them downward by 75% (i.e., from 5.02 million tonnes to 1.26 million tonnes).484\n\nBehre Dolbear, First ER, \u00b6 118.\n\nBehre Dolbear, Second ER, \u00b6 67.\n\nBehre Dolbear First ER, \u00b6 132.\n\nBehre Dolbear, First ER, \u00b6 135. *See also*, Second ER, \u00b6 69.\n\nBehre Dolbear, Second ER, \u00b6 70.\n\n413.\n\nAs noted above, the Respondent opposes the inclusion of any resources in the calculation of the life of the concessions. Econ One states that \"[t]he calculation of the FMV of the concessions can only include the exploitation of the estimated ulexite reserves. Including [resources] would be highly speculative.\"485\n\nEcon One, First ER, \u00b6 55, Tribunal's translation.\n\n414.\n\nThe record shows that it is standard mining practice to assign economic value to resources when valuing a mining operation. While it shares Bolivia's concern about including resources the presence of which may be speculative, the majority also finds that the record establishes the richness of boron in the area of the Claimants' concessions with sufficient certainty. Indeed, the Orstom-Risacher report carried out in 1989486 described the Salar as containing \"enormous reserves, practically inexhaustible, of lithium, potassium, magnesium and boron [...] The area with the highest concentration of these elements is found in the superficial crust at the south of the salar, close to the R\u00edo Grande estuary,\"487 where the concessions are located. The high concentration of boron minerals in the areas where the concessions are located is further confirmed by the report drafted by Bolivia's *Servicio Nacional de Geolog\u00eda y T\u00e9cnico de Minas* (\"SERGEOTECMIN\") in 2008.488 In addition, the Aquater-Enichem study identified \"possible reserves\" of 6.3 million tonnes of ulexite in the entire deposit, which in today's terminology would be categorized as resources.489 Although most of the quantification studies in the record were carried out inside the Aquater-Enichem grid and resources outside this grid were extrapolated, it would be unrealistic to think that the presence of resources stopped at the border of an artificially created area of exploration when other elements in the record confirm the presence of boron in the entire deposit.\n\nExh. BD-3.\n\nExh. BD-3, p. 61, Tribunal's translation.\n\nExh. BD-37.\n\nExh. BD-4, p. 201. The exact amount of possible reserves identified by Aquater-Enichem is 6,303,768.\n\n415.\n\nTaking these various elements into consideration, the majority will assign a value to the resources identified by Aquater-Enichem as \"possible reserves\", factored down by 90%, without distinguishing whether they are inside or outside the Aquater-Enichem grid. Indeed, the majority is not persuaded by Behre Dolbear's distinction between resources inside and outside this grid, as it appears to contain an element of doublecounting. Behre Dolbear's estimate of indicated resources *inside* the grid is based on Aquater-Enichem's estimate of \"possible reserves\" (6.3 million tonnes) factored down by 50%. Yet, that estimate applies to the area *outside* the grid or, at best, to the entire deposit (what Aquater refers to as \"the remainder of the deposit\").490\n\nIn Spanish, el \"resto del yacimiento\" (BD-4, p. 201).\n\n416.\n\nAccordingly, the majority will assign value to the resources identified by Aquater-Enichem, factored down by 90% (i.e., 630,777 tonnes of ulexite). It thus finds that the Claimants could have extracted 2.5 million tonnes of ulexite (the exact amount being 2,499,777 tonnes), including reserves and resources. That being said, on the date of the expropriation the Claimants had already extracted part of these quantities. On the basis of the information in the record (in particular of the production profile set out in the 2001 Supply Contract between NMM and RIGSSA,491 addressed in the next section492), the Tribunal estimates that between 2001 and July of 2004 the Claimants had extracted 179,845 tonnes of ulexite. Accordingly, for its cash flow projections the Tribunal will assign an economic value to 2,319,932 tonnes of ulexite.\n\nExhs. CD-16 and NCI-06.\n\n*See* in particular \u00b6 429 below.\n\n**iv. Cash flows: production profile and life of the concessions**\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*(a) Production profile*\n------------------------\n\n417.\n\nFor its *ex ante* valuation, the Claimants' economic expert, Navigant, has submitted a forecast of the concessions' production profile relying on the 1999 RIGSSA business plan and on the 2001 Quiborax-RIGSSA supply contract (the \"2001 Supply Contract\").493 Navigant clarifies that its *ex ante* forecast is more in line with the sales estimated in the 2001 Supply Contract (which requires production of 25,000 MT of product in 2001 and ramps it up to 104,000 MT of product by 2006, remaining constant thereafter), although Navigant assumes that the ramp-up in sales occurs over a longer period of time (reaching 104,000 MT of product in 2009 instead of 2006).494\n\nNavigant, First ER, \u00b6\u00b6 114-117; Exhs. NCI-49, NCI-06, and CD-16.\n\nNavigant, First ER, \u00b6\u00b6 114-116.\n\n418.\n\nNavigant revises these contractual estimates \"marginally upwards\" to take into consideration the growth in the agricultural market for borates between 2001 and 2004 (which it forecasts at 5% between 2009-2014 and 1% from 2015 onwards), and because it believes that \"Quiborax [\u2026] could have leveraged its mining and logistics expertise to ensure a more reliable and scalable supply of ulexite from the Bolivian Concessions.\"495 Navigant's *ex ante* production profile forecasts product sales starting at 59,861 MT in 2004 and up to 171,022 MT in 2014.496\n\nNavigant, First ER, \u00b6 116.\n\nNavigant, Second ER, Exh. C.4.\n\n419.\n\nFor its *ex post* valuation, Navigant assumes that \"the Bolivian Concessions would have increased production to a higher level over a shorter time period than what was projected in the ex-ante valuation, based on the global economic boom (especially in emerging markets) between 2004 and 2008.\"497 Specifically, Navigant states that, \"based on market development it is reasonable to forecast production reaching 75 percent of the RIGSSA business plan objective of 200,000 tons over a 4-year period by 2008.\"498 Thereafter, Navigant forecasts production on the basis of the expected growth rate of the agricultural market for borates which is zero for the years 20092010 and 4.6% from 2011 to 2019.499 As a result of these assumptions, the updated *ex post* production profile submitted by Navigant in 2013 is thus slightly higher than its *ex ante* forecasts (starting at 65,386 MT in 2004 up to 224,145 MT in 2019).500\n\nNavigant, Second ER, Exh.

E.5 and E.6.b. 2019 is the last year for which Navigant calculates an actual cash flow, as it then calculates the concessions' terminal value by calculating the value of a perpetuity beginning in 2019 minus the value of a perpetuity beginning in 2037, discounted back to 2019 (*See* Navigant, Second ER, Exh. E.2).\n\n420.\n\nBolivia and its economic expert, Econ One, object to the production profile used by Navigant. First, they object to the use of the 1999 RIGSSA business plan and point out that \"NMM was not able to reach the production levels set out in the 2001 contract.\"501 According to Econ One, \"this indicated that the 2001 contract was too optimistic and has not taken into account adequately the factors on the demand and the supply side.\"502 Econ One also criticizes the growth rates forecast by Navigant that exceed the Supply Contract requirements because they do not consider factors limiting supply and demand. With respect to limitations on supply, Econ One argues that Navigant did not consider whether there was sufficient work force to reach its estimates, or whether the manual processes used would have allowed that growth to materialize.503 As to demand, Econ One criticizes Navigant's reliance on *The* *Economics of Boron* to forecast a 5% growth between 2010-2014, because (i) it was published in 2006 (two years after the valuation date that Econ One considers appropriate), (ii) the 2002 version did not forecast a 5% growth rate, and (iii) the 2006 version only forecasted growth up to 2010.504\n\nEcon One, First ER, \u00b6 87, Tribunal's translation.\n\nEcon One, First ER, \u00b6 87, Tribunal's translation.\n\nEcon One, First ER, \u00b6\u00b6 74-79.\n\nEcon One, First ER, \u00b6\u00b6 80-86; Econ One's presentation at the hearing, slide18.\n\n421.\n\nAs a result, Econ One's production profile assumes that the concessions would have produced ulexite in accordance with the volumes foreseen in the 2001 Supply Contract with a one-year delay until the estimated depletion of the concessions, which Econ One calculates will take place in year 2029 at the proposed production rate, on the basis of the proven and probable reserves calculated by Behre Dolbear.505 Econ One excludes the 50-56% ulexite mentioned in the 2001 Supply Contract, arguing that the production levels stated in the contract only reflect a maximum subject to the possibilities of production, and noting that neither Quiborax nor NMM sold this type of ulexite between 2001 and 2004.506 According to Econ One's production profile, production would start at 64,000 MT in 2004, reach 68,000 MT in 2006 and remain constant until 2029.507\n\nEcon One, First ER, \u00b6 88.\n\nEcon One, First ER, \u00b6\u00b6 70-73.\n\nEcon One, First ER, Exh. EO-3, table 4.\n\n422.\n\nThe Tribunal has determined by majority that *ex post* valuation is generally appropriate in this case, which entails assessing the value on the date of the Award, in principle using *ex post data*. However, where such data does not appear certain enough, it may be necessary to revert to *ex ante* input. What actually matters, as stated above, is that the valuation replicates the actual loss as closely as possible. Here, the Tribunal finds that Navigant's relying solely on market growth to forecast production is speculative. NMM was a going concern that operated for over two years prior to the expropriation, and in 2003 (its last full year of operation), it did not even reach the production levels forecast in the 2001 Supply Contract.508 Likewise, the Tribunal is not persuaded that \"the Bolivian Concessions would serve approximately one-third of the global agricultural market in 2009,\" as asserted by Navigant in its First Report.509 Nor have the Claimants substantiated their projected growth sufficiently in terms of the limitations to supply and demand, in particular with respect to the workforce and manufacturing requirements needed to support that projected growth. In these circumstances, it would be speculative to conclude that the Claimant's production could sustain a 5% growth.\n\nNavigant, First ER, \u00b6 113; Econ One, First ER, \u00b6 87.\n\nNavigant, First ER, \u00b6 117. The Tribunal further notes that Mr. Fosk testified at the hearing that Quiborax did not aspire to capture 32% of the complete borates market; this aim was limited solely to the ulexite market. Tr., Day 1, 192:4-193:6.\n\n423.\n\nIn addition, the Tribunal notes that Econ One criticizes Navigant for projecting sales between 2004-2012 that are much higher than the ulexite actually sold by Quiborax during that period. For instance, Econ One notes that \"Quiborax sold a total of 10,500 tons of ulexite plus between 2004 and 2012 [ *i.e.*, an average of approximately 1,300 MT per year], while Navigant's *ex post* model projects sales of ulexite plus of at least 15,778 MT per year, reaching even 36,613 MT in 2012. Similarly, Quiborax only sold 3,200 to 5,800 of natural ulexite per year between 2009-2012, while Navigant's *ex post* model projects sales of natural ulexite for more than 105,285 MT per year during the same period.\"510 Although Econ One's criticism is directed to Navigant's price projections,511 the Tribunal finds it speculative to assume that NMM would have been able to sell ten times more ulexite plus and twenty times more natural ulexite than Quiborax during the same period. Although the absence of the concessions may account for Quiborax's lower figures, the Tribunal is not satisfied that the Claimants' projections are sufficiently supported.\n\nEcon One, Second ER, \u00b6 219, Tribunal's translation, relying on Quiborax's Sales Database by Transaction 2001-2009 (Exh. NCI-40), and Quiborax's Granulex 24-9 B Borates Costs Report, 20092012 (Exh. NCI-171).\n\nEcon One argues that \"[t]here is no certainty that Quiborax could have been able to sell twenty times more ulexite than the ulexite it actually sold at the same prices,\" and that \"it is very possible that to sell that much larger quantity, Quiborax would have had to sell at lower prices,\" Econ One, Second Report, \u00b6 219, Tribunal's translation.\n\n424.\n\nThe Tribunal will thus base its projections on the production profile that was contractually agreed by Quiborax and RIGSSA in the 2001 Supply Contract. It will use the 2001 Supply Contract rather than RIGSSA's 1999 business plan, considering that Bolivia opposes the use of the 1999 business plan and that Navigant has acknowledged that it was too optimistic.512 The Tribunal also finds that it makes sense to use the most recent forecast.\n\nNavigant, First ER, \u00b6 115. Indeed, Navigant's *ex ante* projection reaches only 75% of the 1999 RIGSSA business plan (Navigant, First ER, \u00b6 115).\n\n425.\n\nThe 2001 Supply Contract contemplated sales of three different ulexite products based on the B2O3 content of the ulexite:\n\n**CLAUSE SIX, PRODUCTS AND QUANTITIES** : During each contract year the seller undertakes to provide and sell to the buyer and the buyer agrees to buy the volumes listed below: **Ulexite thirty percent**. Two thousand one. Twenty-five thousand metric tons. Two thousand two onwards. Fifty thousand meters. **Ulexite forty percent**. Year two thousand one up to ten thousand meters. Year two thousand two twelve thousand meters. Year two thousand three fourteen thousand metric tons. Year two thousand four sixteen thousand meters. Year two thousand five eighteen thousand meters. Year two thousand six - two thousand fifteen eighteen thousand metric tons. **Ulexite fifty to fifty-six percent**. Year two thousand five - two thousand fifteen approximately up to thirty-six thousand metric tons / year. Compliance by both sides of the volumes of sale and purchase of forty percent ulexite and fifty to fifty-six percent ulexite is subject to the production possibilities of the seller, the price agreement between the parties and the marketing conditions. The annual purchase and provision volumes set forth above may be subject to changes to be agreed in mandatory meetings between buyer and seller at the end of each contract year. To adopt the necessary decisions, market needs and requirements should be taken especially into consideration.513\n\nExhs. NCI-06, CD-16, pp. 5-6, Tribunal's translation. The Tribunal understands that when this clause refers to \"meters\" it refers to \"metric tons.\"\n\n426.\n\nThese quantities are transcribed below:\n\n427.\n\nAs noted above, Econ One argues that the production levels for 50-56% B2O3 ulexite only reflect a maximum subject to the possibilities of production, and notes that neither Quiborax nor NMM sold this type of ulexite between 2001 and 2004.514 The production profile proposed by Econ One thus excludes the 36,000 MT per year attributable to this type of ulexite, reaching a maximum of 68,000 MT starting in 2006. Navigant acknowledges that the Claimants did not sell 50-56% B2O3 ulexite between 2001-2004,515 but does not reduce the production profile for this reason. Rather, Navigant's *ex ante* production profile anticipates a different mix of ulexite products for a minimum of 106,000 MT of production starting in 2006.516\n\nEcon One, First ER, \u00b6\u00b6 70-73.\n\nNavigant, First ER, footnote 167.\n\nNavigant, First ER, \u00b6\u00b6 114-116, footnote 167; Navigant, Second ER, Exh. C.4.\n\n428.\n\nAgain, the Tribunal finds it uncertain that a potential buyer would have produced and sold a type of ulexite that NMM did not previously sell. In addition, it notes that the Supply Contract provides that \"[c]ompliance by both sides of the volumes of sale and purchase of forty percent ulexite and fifty to fifty-six percent ulexite is subject to the production possibilities of the seller, the price agreement between the parties and the marketing conditions,\"517 and does not contemplate production of 50-56% B2O3 ulexite before 2005. Given NMM's historical levels of production (discussed in the following paragraph), it would also be speculative to assume that the concessions would have produced an additional 36,000 MT of other types of ulexite. The Tribunal will therefore base its production profile on the volumes projected in the 2001 Supply Contract for 30% and 40% B2O3 ulexite, and will disregard the production volumes projected for 50-56% B2O3 ulexite.\n\nClause 6 of the 2001 Supply Contract, Exhs. NCI-06 and CD-16, Tribunal's translation.\n\n429.\n\nUsing the Supply Contract's projected volumes for 30% and 40% B2O3 ulexite as set out in paragraph 426 above, the concessions would have produced 64,000 MT of product in 2003, 66,000 MT in 2004, and 68,000 from 2005 onwards. However, it is undisputed that the Claimants did not reach the production level expected for year 2003 for 30% and 40% B2O3 ulexite (50,845 MT instead of 64,000 MT).518 The Tribunal thus agrees with Bolivia that NMM's production from 2004 should be projected on the basis of the 2001 Supply Contract figures with a one-year delay. Consequently, the total ulexite production of 30% and 40% B2O3 ulexite from 2004 until 2015, with the one-year delay as suggested by Bolivia, would be as follows:\n\n**Year Metric tons**\n\n2004 64,000\n\n2005 66,000\n\n2006-2015 68,000\n\nNavigant, First ER, \u00b6 113; Econ One, First ER, \u00b6 87.\n\n430.\n\nThe experts disagree on the growth rate from year 2015 until the depletion of the concessions. While Navigant takes \"an assumed annual growth rate in production of 1 percent per year after 2014,\"519 Econ One submits that \"the reasonable thing to assume [...] is that at some future time production would stop growing and exploitation costs would rise.\"520 Hence, Econ One's production profile assumes production levels of \"68,000 MT in 2006, remaining stable at that level of 68,000 MT per year from 2007 until the depletion of the concessions' reserves, which would have happened in year 2029.\"521\n\nNavigant, First ER, \u00b6 121.\n\nEcon One, First ER, \u00b6 79.\n\nEcon One, First ER, \u00b6 88, Tribunal's translation, footnotes omitted.\n\n431.\n\nIn the absence of compelling evidence to the contrary, the Tribunal will assume that the production would have remained stable until the depletion of the concessions.\n\n432.\n\nFinally, the Respondent has suggested that any valuation of the concessions must account for certain exploitation rights allegedly exercised by the SOCOMIRG mining community within the Claimants' concessions.522 The Respondent alleges that there was an ongoing dispute between NMM and SOCOMIRG with respect to an exploitation contract between them and that Decree 27,548 of 3 June 2004523 recognized some mining rights to SOCOMIRG. According to the Respondent, a willing buyer would have considered this information when assessing the value of the investments.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 188-189.\n\nExh. CD-41.\n\n433.\n\nThe Claimant has acknowledged that there was a dispute between NMM and SOCOMIRG regarding the latter's exploitation of certain areas of the Borateras de Cuevitas concession. According to the Claimants, SOCOMIRG had previously exploited two concessions in the Borateras de Cuevitas area, but those rights had expired in 2002.524 The Claimants explain that NMM allowed SOCOMIRG to continue the exploitation of their former concessions to avoid conflicts with local miners, but always insisted that NMM was the rightful owner.525 The Claimants also dispute the validity of Decree 27,548, arguing that SOCOMIRG's extinct rights over previous concessions could not be revived by means of a governmental decree.526\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 150-151, Exh.

CD-171.\n\n434.\n\nThe Tribunal understands the Respondent to argue that the Claimants' production should be reduced because Decree 27,548 recognized exploitation rights to SOCOMIRG. Yet, the Respondent has not explained the impact of Decree 27,548: this decree merely states that its object is to establish the relationship between the Bolivian State and SOCOMIRG,527 recognizes the validity of the contracts entered into by the Bolivian State and SOCOMIRG,528 requests two state agencies to advise and supervise SOCOMIRG's operations,529 and establishes certain guidelines for the exploitation of ulexite by SOCOMIRG.530 Even if this decree did have the effect of reviving SOCOMIRG's previous contracts (which is not established), those contracts are not on record and the Tribunal must conclude that SOCOMIRG's rights and possible impact on the Claimants' mining rights remain unproven.\n\nExh.

C.1, Note 5.\n\nNavigant, Second ER, Exh. E.2, Note 5.\n\n437.\n\nBolivia's economic expert, on the other hand, argues that the depletion of the concessions' reserves would have taken place in 2029, considering Behre Dolbear's estimates of proven and probable reserves and excluding resources.535 Although Econ One does not expressly explain how it arrives at this figure, the Tribunal understands that it has calculated how many years it would have taken for the reserves to be depleted at the production rate Econ One proposes.536\n\nEcon One, First ER, \u00b6 88.\n\nEcon One explained his methodology with examples during the hearing. *See* Tr., Day 2, 215-217.\n\n438.\n\nThe Tribunal has conducted its own calculation of the life of the concessions. At the rate of production determined in the preceding section, the reserves and resources found in the concessions on the date of the expropriation (which have been quantified above at 2,319,932 tonnes) would have been depleted by 2039.\n\n439.\n\nIn view of the Tribunal's findings in the preceding sub-sections, the Tribunal will calculate the concessions' cash flows taking into account ulexite reserves and resources quantified at 2,319,932 tonnes at a production rate of 64,000 MT in 2004, 66,000 MT in 2005, and 68,000 from 2006 onwards, until the depletion of the concessions in 2039.\n\n**v. Cash flows: ulexite products, prices and costs**\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n440.\n\nThe experts agree on the products that would have been sold by NMM, but disagree on the price and cost estimates to be applied to the cash flow projections. The Tribunal will refer first to the products to be sold (a), then to price estimates (b), and finally to cost estimates (c).\n\n*(a) Products to be sold*\n-------------------------\n\n441.\n\nThe Claimants' expert explains that \"[t]he ulexite reserves within the Bolivian Concessions would enable the owner to manufacture three basic borate products [\u2026]: 1) sun-dried ulexite (commercial name: \"Natural Ulexite\"); 2) calcinated ulexite (commercial name \"Ulexite Plus\"); and 3) granulated ulexite (commercial name: \"Granulex Plus\"). The prices (and profits) of these products are influenced by the boron content and the processing required to produce the product. The prices and profits are highest for Granulex Plus, followed by Ulexite Plus and then Natural Ulexite.\"537\n\nNavigant, First ER, \u00b6 118 (footnotes omitted).\n\n442.\n\nNavigant projects the annual production of these three products on the basis of Quiborax's sales mix between 2002 and 2004. Navigant notes that in 2003 \"approximately 60 percent of the sun-dried ulexite used to supply these products to the agricultural market was sold as Natural Ulexite, while approximately 30 percent and 10 percent of the sun-dried ulexite was processed and sold as Ulexite Plus and Granulex Plus, respectively.\"538 Navigant assumes that this product mix would remain constant after the installment of on-site processing equipment in 2006.539 Before 2006, production is limited to Ulexite Plus and Natural Ulexite because the granulation plant required to produce Granulex Plus would not be in place.540\n\nNavigant, First ER, \u00b6 119; Exh. C.\n\nNavigant, First ER, \u00b6 119 *.*\n\nNavigant, First ER, footnote 172.\n\n443.\n\nEcon One applies the same assumptions with respect to the production of Natural Ulexite, Ulexite Plus and Granulex Plus,541 so the Tribunal will use these assumptions (including the product mix) for its calculations.\n\nEcon One, First ER, \u00b6 91; Second ER, \u00b6 43.\n\n*(b) Price estimates*\n---------------------\n\n444.\n\nNavigant's *ex post* calculation considers actual prices for past cash flows and a projection of future prices on that basis.542 According to Navigant, the actual price of ulexite in the period after 2009 increased significantly more than it had estimated in its first report, which had the effect of increasing the cash flows in its second report.543 Navigant illustrates the rise in prices for Ulexite Plus in the following table:\n\n|  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|  | Actual Price | *Ex ante* First Report |\n| 2008 | 436.33 | 436.33 |\n| 2009 | 480.93 | 344.14 |\n| 2010 | 497.19 | 251.95 |\n| 2011 | 525.63 | 259.62 |\n| 2012 | 463.62 | 267.53 |\n\nNavigant, Second ER, Exhs. E.4 and E.6.\n\nNavigant, Second ER, footnote 144, Exhs. E.4 and E.6.e.\n\n445.\n\nHowever, Navigant explains that \"[g]iven the sharp increase in ulexite prices that has occurred, we do not believe it is reasonable to expect that these prices will continue to rise with inflation. Instead we believe that the four year average price levels are likely to be viewed as long-term prices. As such, we do not adjust these prices for inflation in our updated *ex post* model.\"544 Indeed, the Tribunal notes that, from 2013 onwards, Navigant has projected prices on the basis of the average price between 2009-2012, without adjusting for inflation.545\n\nNavigant, Second ER, footnote 144.\n\nNavigant, Second ER, Exh. E.6, Note 4 (\"We believe that 2012 prices are unsustainable in the long run, therefore for 2013 our forecast is based on the average price for the period 2004-2011. After 2013 we hold prices constant and assume that this new price threshold will hold for the foreseeable future.\")\n\n446.\n\nEcon One objects to Navigant's *ex post* price estimates. Econ One notes that Navigant's prices are based on sales by Quiborax between 2005 and 2012 of ulexite mined from other deposits, not on the prices at which the ulexite from the concessions could have been sold. According to Econ One, using prices from other deposits is highly speculative: ulexite is not a commodity with standardized characteristics and prices and, as Behre Dolbear recognizes, the prices of ulexite products will vary depending on the chemical quality, type and level of impurities.546 In addition, Econ One argues that the prices estimated by Navigant are not sustainable at the production rates proposed by Navigant. Econ One notes that the sales projected by Navigant for 2004-2012 are much higher than the ulexite actually sold by Quiborax during that period.547 It therefore argues that \"[t]here is no certainty that Quiborax could have been able to sell twenty times more ulexite than the ulexite it actually sold at the same prices,\" and that \"it is very possible that to sell that much larger quantity, Quiborax would have had to sell at lower prices.\"548\n\nEcon One, Second ER, \u00b6 218, citing Behre Dolbear, First ER, \u00b6 16.\n\nEcon One, Second ER, \u00b6 219, relying on Quiborax's Sales Database by Transaction 2001-2009 (Exh. NCI-40), and Quiborax's Granulex 24-9 B Borates Costs Report, 2009-2012 (Exh. NCI-171).\n\nEcon One, Second ER, \u00b6 219, Tribunal's translation.\n\n447.\n\nEcon One thus projects prices on the basis of the 2004 actual price, adjusted for inflation. Econ One rejects the inflation rate used by Navigant in its *ex ante* valuation, where Navigant assumed that ulexite prices would grow at 3.1 percent annually, equal to the 20-year average U.S. inflation rate through 2003.549 Econ One \"agree[s] to index prices according to the U.S. inflation rate, but this indexation must be done on the basis of expected future inflation, not past inflation.\"550 It relies on inflation projections from the Executive Office of the President of the United States, the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia and the U.S. Energy Information Administration, among others,551 and calculates that prices would increase from 2005 onwards at a rate of 2.5 percent per year.552\n\nNavigant, First ER, \u00b6 123.\n\nEcon One, First ER, \u00b6 94, Tribunal's translation.\n\n*See* Econ One, First ER, footnote 162.\n\nEcon One, First ER, \u00b6 94.\n\n448.\n\nIn line with the *ex post* valuation deemed appropriate here, the Tribunal considers that it must use actual prices to calculate the Claimants' loss (whether to calculate past cash flows or project future cash flows).\n\n449.\n\nBecause there is no price information for the ulexite mined from the concessions during the relevant time period, the Claimants have calculated their cash flows on the basis of the prices of Quiborax's ulexite from other deposits. Despite Econ One's objections, the Tribunal finds that this is reasonable. Indeed, it is not seriously disputed that the ulexite mined in the concessions was of very high quality and in any event of a higher quality that the ulexite mined by Quiborax in Chile.553 Both NMM and Quiborax produced Natural Ulexite, Ulexite Plus and Granulex Plus under the same commercial names, so it is reasonable to assume that these are substantially the same products. Finally, the Tribunal is using Econ One's production profile to estimate cash flows, so Econ One's argument that Quiborax would not have been able to sustain those prices for larger amounts of ulexite is inapposite.\n\n*See, e.g.,* Tr., Day 1, 210:10-211:18 (testimony of Mr. Allan Fosk); WS of Mr. Ricardo Ramos, \u00b6 11, and his testimony at the hearing, Tr., Day 2, 3:20-6:1; 20:21-21:8. *See also* Aquater-Enichem report, Section 1.6.2, Exh. BD-4, p. 28.\n\n450.\n\nThat said, the Tribunal notes that, in order to project prices from 2013 onwards, Navigant has used an average of the previous four years (2009-2012). While the Tribunal agrees that using an average is appropriate, it finds the choice of four years arbitrary. That choice coincides with the period of highest prices. The Tribunal finds it speculative to assume that prices will remain at such level throughout the life of the concessions. It will thus use an average of the entire post-expropriation period (20042012). The Tribunal will revert below on the effect of inflation.\n\n*(c) Costs*\n-----------\n\n451.\n\nThere is no disagreement on \"selling, general and administrative costs\" (SG&A costs). Navigant projected SG&A costs on a fixed basis \"at 19.5 percent of revenues with marginal reductions of this percentage over time to reflect efficiencies of scale\"554 and Econ One agrees.555\n\nNavigant, First ER, \u00b6 128.\n\nEcon One, First ER, \u00b6 100.\n\n452.\n\nThe experts disagree, however, on the estimate of \"mining and processing costs\" and \"transportation costs.\" For its *ex ante* projections, Navigant estimates future costs concerning mining and processing on the basis of 2004 costs, and inflates them using the producer price index (PPI) for Bolivia. For its *ex post* calculations, Navigant included actual costs for water and fuel.556 Navigant notes that the Bolivian PPI increased at a rate that was higher than its forecast, resulting in higher costs in the *ex post* valuation.557\n\nNavigant, First ER, \u00b6 172.\n\nNavigant, First ER, \u00b6 171.\n\n453.\n\nWith respect to transportation costs, in its *ex ante* valuation Navigant also started from 2004 figures using \"actual freight costs incurred between the two locations (based on review of product invoices) in conjunction with the change in transportation/freight price indexes in Chile and Bolivia to project future freight costs in USD per MT.\"558 For its *ex post* valuation, it used actual transportation indices to incorporate more accurate figures.559\n\nNavigant, First ER, \u00b6 128. The detailed calculation can be found in Exh. C of the report.\n\nNavigant, First ER, \u00b6\u00b6 173, 197.\n\n454.\n\nEcon One, for its part, has taken 2004 costs and indexed them from 2005 onwards \"with the long-term inflation rate expected in the United States at the valuation date, 2.5%.\"560 Econ One also objects to Navigant's costs in its adjusted e *x post* valuation, arguing that it relies on Quiborax's operation costs in Chile and on transportation price indices between Chile and Bolivia, instead of observable prices.561\n\nEcon One First ER, \u00b6 98, Tribunal's translation, footnote omitted.\n\nEcon One, Second ER, \u00b6 222.\n\n455.\n\nThe majority must be consistent with the pricing rationale chosen. It considers that Navigant's use of actual costs, updated transportation price indices and an updated PPI are better suited to an *ex post* valuation than prices indexed for inflation. In the absence of a closer proxy, the Tribunal finds that the use of Quiborax's costs appears appropriate. In any event, Navigant's cost projections in its *ex post* valuation are higher than Econ One's projected *ex ante* costs, thus reducing profits.562 It will therefore use Navigant's figures in this respect.\n\nNavigant, Second ER, Exh. E.6; Econ One, First ER, Exh. EO-3, Table 2.\n\n**vi. Cash flows: other variables**\n-----------------------------------\n\n456.\n\nThe experts agree on the methodology to calculate depreciation, *i.e.*, they assume a 20-year useful life for fixed assets, resulting in a depreciation of 5% of the cost of fixed assets.563 The experts also agree on the methodology used to calculate working capital.564 The Tribunal will thus use the same methodology.\n\nNavigant, First ER, \u00b6 128; Second ER, \u00b6 104; Econ One, First ER, \u00b6 102; Second ER, \u00b6 43..\n\nNavigant, First ER, \u00b6\u00b6 Exh. C.2-C.7; Second ER, \u00b6 105; Econ One, First ER, \u00b6 108; Second ER, \u00b6 43.\n\n457.\n\nThe experts disagree however on the amount of capital expenditures. Based on discussions with Quiborax and Behre Dolbear, Navigant has assumed that the buyer of the concessions would have made two capital investments to support the growth and expansion of the concessions:565\n\na. USD 2 million for a granulation plant to process sun-dried ulexite into dry granules, to be made between 2005-2006. This investment would have enabled NMM to sell Granulex Plus;\n\nb. USD 2.5 million for a storage and packaging facility, to be made in 2005.\n\nNavigant, First ER, \u00b6\u00b6 124-126.\n\n458.\n\nEcon One agrees with the granulation plant investment, but reduces the expenditure for the storage and packaging facility to USD 1,322 million, because its lower production profile would require a smaller facility.566 As it has adopted Econ One's production profile, the Tribunal will use Econ One's capital expenditure figures.\n\nEcon One, First ER, \u00b6\u00b6 113-114.\n\n459.\n\nNavigant also assumes that a buyer would incur replacement and maintenance capital expenditures every six years throughout the forecast period equal to the accumulated depreciation over this six year period, inflated by Bolivian PPI.567 Econ One agrees with this approach, but notes that Navigant fails to include this in the terminal value of the concessions. In its Second Report, Navigant corrects this error. The Tribunal has included this expenditure in its calculations, based on Econ One's depreciation figures, as the Tribunal has used Econ One's capital expenditure estimates.\n\nNavigant, First ER, \u00b6 127.\n\n460.\n\nThe experts also disagree on the use of the exchange rate. Econ One argues that Navigant has used Bolivianos and U.S. dollars inconsistently, applying different exchange rates with the sole purpose of artificially inflating the FMV. According to Econ One, although prices are in U.S. dollars, Navigant converts them to Bolivianos, and carries out its calculation in Bolivianos, only to convert the results back into U.S. dollars. According to Econ One, this results in an incorrect \"round-trip\" which overestimates its valuation. Econ One also criticizes Navigant for not using purchasing power parity (\"PPP\") in its first report.\n\n461.\n\nNavigant, on the other hand, argues that the currencies used are in accordance with standard practice. It explains that the revenues related to the concessions are earned in U.S. dollars, but costs are predominantly incurred in Bolivian currency. Taking this into account, and since the valuation must be built into a single currency, Navigant has converted the forecast cash flows in Bolivianos (Bs), while the Respondent's expert chose to carry out the DCF analysis in U.S. dollars. Nevertheless, Navigant argues that \"the choice of currency is largely irrelevant, particularly if purchasing power parity (\"PPP\") is employed as suggested by Dr. Flores [of Econ One].\"568 Indeed, in its second report, Navigant applies PPP.\n\nNavigant, Second ER, \u00b6 55.\n\n462.\n\nThe Tribunal has carried out its calculations in U.S. dollars, thus taking into consideration Econ One's criticisms of Navigant's methodology. That said, it has needed to convert costs in Bolivianos into dollars. For that, it has used the exchange rates used by Navigant in its *ex post* valuation, to which Econ One does not appear to object. Indeed, Econ One argues that \"the only data that is observable and more precise in Navigant's *ex post* model than in its *ex ante* model are the data on inflation and exchange rate between 2004 and 2013, which are published historical parameters.\"569 The Tribunal has thus used these actual exchange rates in its calculation of past cash flows. As future cash flows are then calculated in dollars, it has not needed to use any exchange rate forecasts for that part of its calculations.\n\nEcon One, Second ER, \u00b6 217.\n\n463.\n\nFinally, the Tribunal has adjusted the cash flows for inflation at a rate of 2.5% per year, which inflation rate was proposed by Econ One. Indeed, in light of the long duration until the depletion of the reserves and resources, it appears economically correct to make an adjustment for inflation.\n\n**vii. Discount rate**\n----------------------\n\n464.\n\nThe Tribunal must discount future profits back to the date of valuation, *i.e.* 30 June 2013. For this it must select a discount rate appropriate for 2013.\n\n465.\n\nThe experts agree that the appropriate measure for the discount rate is the WACC.570 They disagree, however, on five components of the WACC calculation: the risk free rate of return, the equity risk premium, the country risk premium, the micro-cap size premium (all four factors to calculate the cost of equity) and the cost of debt.571 They also disagree on the date on which WACC should be calculated: Navigant uses 2013, which is the date of its latest *ex post* valuation, while Econ One uses 2004, which is the date of its *ex ante* valuation.\n\n*See, e.g.* Econ One First ER, \u00b6 118.\n\nEcon One, First ER, table 7, p. 46.\n\n466.\n\nAs a result of these differences, Econ One calculates the WACC of the Claimants' investments in 2004 at 22.99%, while Navigant in its *ex ante* valuation calculates the WACC in 2004 at 13.27% in its first report572 and at 11.81% in its second report.573 In its *ex post* valuation, Navigant calculates the WACC in 2013 at 14.61% in its first report574 and at 10.78% in its second report.575\n\nNavigant, First ER, \u00b6 155, Exh. D.1.\n\nNavigant, Second ER, Exh. D.1.\n\nNavigant, First ER, \u00b6 214, Exh. F.1.\n\nNavigant, Second ER, Exh. F.1.\n\n467.\n\nNavigant does not explain the reasoning for the variables chosen in its second report; it simply states that to update its *ex post* valuation it has \"incorporated new information during this period of time with respect to [...] variables required to calculate the cost of capital.\"576 Econ One does not expressly object to the variables used by Navigant to calculate the WACC in its *ex post* valuation: Econ One's analysis is focused on Navigant's *ex ante* calculation of the WACC, although it objects to Navigant's *ex post* valuation for other reasons. For the analysis below, unless there is evidence to the contrary, the Tribunal will assume that Navigant's updated figures are supported by the same justification and sources used in its first report and simply reflect the updated figure. It will also assume that Econ One's objections to Navigant's *ex ante* figures apply *mutatis mutandis* to its *ex post* figures.\n\nNavigant, Second ER, \u00b6 157.\n\n*(a) Risk free rate of return*\n------------------------------\n\n468.\n\nBoth Parties agree on using the yield to maturity on U.S. Treasury bonds as a proxy for a risk free interest rate, but disagree on the type of maturity to use.\n\n469.\n\nNavigant uses a risk free rate in its cost of equity calculation equal to the 10-year U.S. Treasury bond. It submits that \"there are many valuation practitioners that advocate for the use of the 10-year U.S. Treasury bond rather than the 20-year U.S. Treasury bond given that the duration of cash flows for many projects are closer to 10 years.\"577 Navigant therefore rejects Econ One's choice of the 20-year U.S. Treasury bond and in particular its decision to match the duration of the risk free rate with the horizon of the cash flows.578\n\nNavigant, Second ER, \u00b6\u00b6 114-117.\n\nNavigant, Second ER, \u00b6 115.\n\n470.\n\nNavigant quotes in support Aswarth Damodaran, who advocates the \"use of the 10-year treasury bond rate as the riskfree rate on all cash flows for most mature firms.\" Regarding \"young firms,\" he notes that \"an argument can be made that we should be using a 30-year treasury bond rate as the riskfree rate.\" However, he then concludes that \"[g]iven that the difference between the 10-year and 30-year bond rates is small [\u2026] using the 10-year bond rate as the riskfree rate on all cash flows is good practice in valuation.\"579\n\nExh. NCI-196, pp. 7-8, footnote omitted.\n\n471.\n\nAccordingly, in its first report Navigant uses a rate of 3.52%, which it asserts was the yield of the 10-year U.S. Treasury bond as of 1 August 2009,580 while in its second report it uses 2.52%, which it asserts was the yield of that bond as of 30 June 2013.581\n\nNavigant, First ER, \u00b6 204; Exh. F.2.\n\nNavigant, Second ER, Exh. F.2.\n\n472.\n\nEcon One claims that the appropriate risk free rate corresponds to the yield of the 20-year U.S. Treasury bond at Econ One's valuation date of June 2004 (5.43%). It justifies this choice by stressing that the concessions' cash flows cover a period of more than 25 years:\n\nThe use of the yield of the 20-year bonds is more consistent with Ibbotson's recommendation that the \"[t]he horizon of the chosen Treasury security should match the horizon of whatever is being valued\" than the use of yields of 10-year bonds, given that in this case we are projecting the concessions' cash flows for over 25 years (from June 2004 to December 2029).582\n\nEcon One, First ER, \u00b6 121, Tribunal's translation, footnotes omitted. *See also* Exh. EO-16, p. 53.\n\n473.\n\nRegarding Navigant's criticism that Econ One matches the duration of the risk free rate with the horizon of the cash flows, Bolivia's expert replies as follows:\n\nNavigant never calculated the duration of the cash flows of the concessions. Navigant only bases its use of the yield of the 10-year bonds in trends and general data reported by financial literature [\u2026].\n\nNevertheless, simple financial calculations prove that the duration of the concessions' cash flows in my model is approximately 17 years. This duration is even larger than the duration of the 20-year bonds, which is 12.7 years, and much larger than the duration of the 10-year bonds, which is 8.2 years.583\n\nEcon One; Second ER, \u00b6\u00b6 142-143, Tribunal's translation, footnotes omitted. *See also* Exh. EO-24, tables 4A to 4C.\n\n474.\n\nThe Tribunal concludes that the 10 - and 20 - year U.S. Treasury bonds could both be justifiable choices to establish the risk free rate. Given that Navigant's latest proposal has a yield-to-maturity as of June 2013, while Econ One's alternative takes into account the yield-to-maturity as of June 2004, the Tribunal finds that the Claimants' choice of the 10-year U.S. Treasury bond provides the more appropriate risk free rate of return for purposes of the present valuation.\n\n*(b) Equity risk premium*\n-------------------------\n\n475.\n\nThe economic experts also disagree on the appropriate equity risk premium to apply in the cost of equity calculation.\n\n476.\n\nRelying on the 2006 estimates by Dimson, Staunton and Marsh of the long term U.S. equity risk premium (\"ERP\") relative to U.S. Treasury Bonds584 and on Prof. Damodaran's data comparing returns of the S&P 500 to U.S. Treasury Bonds,585 Navigant has assumed an equity risk premium in 2009 of 5% for both of its *ex post* valuations.586\n\nExh. NCI-70\n\nExh. NCI-08\n\nNavigant, Second ER, exhibit F.2, note 2.\n\n477.\n\nAccording to Navigant, \"other reputable sources of data for the ERP\" reveal that Econ One's equity risk premium \"is at the very high end of the range of ERPs that many reliable sources consider to be appropriate.\"587 Specifically, Navigant states:\n\nWe note Professor Damodaran publishes ERP calculations of 5.79 percent using an arithmetic average and 4.10 percent using geometric average for the period 1928-2011. He also calculates a 3.36 and 2.35 arithmetic and geometric ERP for the shorter time period of 1962-2011. Professor Damodaran also presents a forward looking ERP of 6.04 percent as of 1 January 2012. Ibbotson/Morningstar publishes an ERP of 7.6 percent for 1928-2014 and 4.9 percent for 1962-2004. Dimson, Staunton & Marsh consider the ERP for 1900-2010 to be 4.4 percent. Finally, a survey of academics and practitioners presented by Shannon Pratt and Roger Grabowski in their book Cost of Capital Applications and Examples list a number of ERP calculations which average 4.9 percent.588\n\nNavigant, Second ER, \u00b6 120.\n\nNavigant, Second ER, \u00b6 119, footnotes omitted. *See also* Exhs. NCI-127, 128, 198 and 130.\n\n478.\n\nEcon One, on the other hand, takes the equity risk premium calculated by Ibbotson in March 2004 (7.2%) based on the yield of the 20-year U.S. Treasury bond. This is consistent with its calculation of the risk free rate.589 In addition, Bolivia's expert claims that the sources cited by Navigant are not comparable because they were published after the valuation date (2004) and mix data of different periods.590 Econ One also asserts that Ibbotson is not at the high end of the range of reasonable equity risk premiums, and the arithmetic average equity risk premium used by Econ One is the most appropriate when discounting future cash flows.591\n\nEcon One, First ER, \u00b6\u00b6 121, 125.\n\nEcon One, Second ER, \u00b6\u00b6 148-149 and Exh. EO-18.\n\nEcon One, Second ER, \u00b6\u00b6 150-151.\n\n479.\n\nThe Tribunal notes Econ One's assertion that the definition of the equity risk premium must be consistent with the choice of the risk free interest rate.592 This statement has not been contested by Navigant. Accordingly, for the sake of consistency with the risk free rate defined above, the Tribunal will take into account the Claimants' suggested equity risk premium of 5%. In addition, the Tribunal notes that Navigant's figures are more current than Econ One's, and thus more appropriate for an *ex post* valuation.\n\nEcon One, First ER, \u00b6 121; Exh. EO-39, pp. 10-11: \"[Y]ou must be consistent in how you define the risk free interest rate and how you define the estimated risk premium [\u2026]\"\n\n*(c) Country risk premium*\n--------------------------\n\n480.\n\nWhen measuring the country risk, the Claimants' expert highlighted that none of the products generated by the concessions were sold to the Bolivian market. As a consequence, \"the Bolivian macro-economic and political risk factors have very limited (if any) impact on the sales and revenues generated from the Bolivian Concessions.\"593 Country risk should therefore consider the key markets in which ulexite is sold: Brazil, U.S., China and India. Navigant formulated a composite risk premium that considers the individual country risk of these markets. For its first *ex post* valuation, it measured the country risk for 2009 at 4.24%594 and then lowered it to 2.67% for 2013.595\n\nNavigant, First ER, \u00b6 147.\n\nNavigant, First ER, \u00b6 208.\n\nNavigant, Second ER, exhibit F.4.\n\n481.\n\nBolivia's expert submits that the appropriate country risk premium is the sovereign bond spread between Bolivian bonds denominated in U.S. dollars and U.S. treasury bonds. Accordingly, an appropriate assessment of country risk, averaging the data published in 2004 by Professor Damodaran (9.75%) and Ibbotson (17.91%) leads to applying 13.83%.596\n\nEcon One, First ER, \u00b6 140, Tribunal's translation, footnotes omitted. *See also* Exhs. EO-19 and EO-20.\n\n482.\n\nNavigant criticizes Econ One's approach for two reasons: (i) it ignores the reality that not all commercial activities conducted within a country are equally affected by country risk and (ii) the spread between sovereign bonds issued by the host country and that of the United States is a poor measurement for the country risk faced by any commercial enterprise.597\n\nNavigant, Second ER, \u00b6\u00b6 125-138.\n\n483.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that both experts have relied on Damodaran's article entitled \"Measuring Company Exposure to Country Risk: Theory and Practice.\"598 The Claimants' economic expert quotes Damodaran in support of its contention that not all companies within a country are equally affected by country risk:\n\n[N]ot all companies in an emerging market are equally exposed to country risk [\u2026] we need to differentiate between firms. [\u2026] [A] company's exposure to country risk comes not from where it incorporates and trades but from where it does its business.599\n\nExh. NCI-131.\n\nExh. NCI-131, p. 1.\n\n484.\n\nNavigant also refers to Damodaran's \"Lambda Approach,\" an adjustment of the bond spread to account for the different levels of country risks faced by different companies,600 although it does not apply it.601\n\nExh. NCI-131, p. 17.\n\nNavigant, Second ER, \u00b6 134.\n\n485.\n\nBolivia's expert, on the other hand, relies on Damodaran to stress that local market risk is not to be understated, as it claims Navigant does:\n\nA company can be exposed to country risk, even if it derives no revenues from that country, if its production facilities are in that country. After all, political and economic turmoil in the country can throw off production schedules and affect the company's profits. Companies that can move their production facilities elsewhere can spread their risk across several countries, but the problem is exaggerated for those companies that cannot move their production facilities. Consider the case of mining companies. An African gold mining company may export all of its production but it will face substantial country risk exposure because its mines are not moveable.602\n\nExh. NCI-131, p. 18.\n\n486.\n\nEcon One also quotes Damodaran's \"Bludgeon Approach\" to support using a general country risk premium:\n\nThe simplest assumption to make when dealing with country risk, and the one that is most often made, is that all companies in a market are equally exposed to country risk.603\n\nExh. NCI-131, p. 16.\n\n487.\n\nThe Tribunal shares the Respondent's view on the relevance of the country risk of the host State of the investment. Indeed, even if the ulexite products generated by the mining concessions are not sold locally, the mining operations are located within Bolivia and cannot be delocalized. As a consequence, they are clearly subject to Bolivia's country risk. Therefore, the Tribunal will not resort to Navigant's proposed country risk premium.\n\n488.\n\nGiven both Parties' reliance on Prof. Damodaran's writings, the Tribunal is persuaded to use the country risk premium according to the data published by this source, *i.e.* 9.75%. The Tribunal is aware that this premium relates to 2004 and that the chosen *ex post* analysis calls for the use of a figure from 2013. However, the Parties have not pointed to the 2013 figure, and the Tribunal considers that the 2004 data better reflects actual risk than the low premium proposed by the Claimant's expert.\n\n*(d) Micro-cap size premium*\n----------------------------\n\n489.\n\nThe fourth area of divergence between the Parties' economic experts is Bolivia's inclusion of a micro-cap size premium of 4.01%.\n\n490.\n\nEcon One explains that small firms tend to produce higher financial returns than bigger firms. This is because markets perceive that investing in small firms is riskier than investing in big firms; consequently, small firms need to offer potential investors higher returns to compensate for the higher risks.604 Consequently, it has applied the size premium calculated by Ibbotson for micro-cap companies.605\n\nEcon One, First ER, \u00b6 141.\n\nExh. EO-16, p. 129.\n\n491.\n\nNavigant disagrees with the inclusion of a small company risk premium essentially because the concessions \"were able to produce a commodity with a global demand that was not dependent on the local market demand.\"606\n\nNavigant, Second ER, \u00b6 139.\n\n492.\n\nWhile neither the Claimants nor Navigant dispute that NMM is a small firm, Navigant argues that this premium is only applicable to companies \"with uncertain demand, a high risk of failure, and a high degree of competition,\" which was not the case here.607 Yet, Navigant has not otherwise supported this assertion. Econ One, in contrast, has submitted financial authorities supporting the inclusion of a size premium,608 notably Ibbotson's \"Stocks, Bonds, Bills, and Inflation, SBBI Valuation Edition 2004 Yearbook,\" from which it takes the size premium for micro-cap companies.609\n\nNavigant, Second ER, \u00b6 139.\n\nExhs. EO-16, EO-21, EO-22, EO-47 and EO-48.\n\nExh. EO-16, p. 129.\n\n493.\n\nThe lack of compelling counter-arguments on the Claimants' side, together with the undisputable fact that the Tribunal is valuing a small company, leads it to conclude that a micro-cap size premium of 4.01% should be factored into the discount rate. The Tribunal is aware that this premium relates to 2004 and that the chosen *ex post* analysis calls for the use of a figure from 2013. However, the 2013 figure is not in the record, and the Tribunal considers that the 2004 data is reasonable and thus may be applied in the present valuation.\n\n*(e) Cost of debt*\n------------------\n\n494.\n\nThe Claimants' expert has relied on two sources of information to set the cost of debt: (i) the bond yields for Rio Tinto and Compass Minerals and (ii) the bank lending rates that reflect the cost of borrowing to finance the concessions, *i.e.* a commercial rate of LIBOR + 4%.610 This premium \"reflect[s] the additional risk of the Bolivian Concessions relative to short-term bank lending.\"611\n\nNavigant, First ER, \u00b6\u00b6 211-212.\n\nNavigant, First ER, \u00b6 152.\n\n495.\n\nNavigant adds that it \"does not assume that [NMM] would have access to debt on the same terms as Rio Tinto or Compass Minerals. Rather we use these companies and LIBOR+4 as reference rates.\"612\n\nNavigant, Second ER, \u00b6 142.\n\n496.\n\nBased on these sources, in its first expert report, Navigant calculates the cost of debt at 7.5% in U.S. dollars, and at 9.44% in Bolivianos to adjust for inflation (Navigant uses the latter for its discount formula, as its cash flows are in Bolivianos).613 In its adjusted *ex post* calculation, Navigant estimates the cost of debt in U.S. dollars at 5.5% and at 7.44% in Bolivianos to adjust for inflation (again using the latter for purposes of its discount formula).614\n\nNavigant, First ER, \u00b6 213; Exh. F.5.\n\nNavigant, Second ER, Exh. F.5\n\n497.\n\nFor Econ One, Navigant's approach is not adequate and results in too low a cost of debt. It challenges the reference to multinational companies such as Rio Tinto and Compass Minerals which have different possibilities of issuing debt and accessing international financial markets.615 It thus submits that the cost of debt should be 11.93%, the sum of the U.S. risk free rate and the risk premium for Bolivian bonds.616\n\nEcon One, First ER, \u00b6 147, Tribunal's translation.\n\nEcon One, First ER, \u00b6 148 and table 7, Exh. EO-19.\n\n498.\n\nRegarding the use of LIBOR + 4%,617 Navigant explains that \"[h]istorically, LIBOR+2 percent tracks the Prime rate of interest,\" which \"is the rate that the banks charge their most trustworthy customers, and thus, [...] is not widely available in the public market. As such, a 2 percent premium to the Prime rate [ *i.e.*, LIBOR + 4%] reflects a rate that would be more broadly available to the public market\" and is \"fully reasonable.\"618 Navigant also asserts that LIBOR + 4% \"adequately reflect[s] the additional risk of the Bolivian Concessions relative to short-term bank lending.\"619\n\nEquivalent to 5.52% in 2009 (date of Navigant's first *ex post* valuation, *see* Navigant, First ER, \u00b6 Table 20 at p. 83; Exh. F.5), and equivalent to 4.69% in 2013 (date of Navigant's adjusted *ex post* valuation, *see* Navigant, Second ER, \u00b6 Exh. F.5).\n\nNavigant, Second ER, \u00b6 142.\n\nNavigant, First ER, \u00b6 212.\n\n499.\n\nEcon One contends that \"it is illogical to assume that the concessions could incur debt at a cost of only LIBOR + 4%,\" because NMM is not comparable to R\u00edo Tinto and Compass Minerals. For instance, Compass Minerals is valued at US$ 591 million, *i.e.*, 18 times the value of the concessions according to Navigant's *ex ante'* s valuation, and nonetheless its cost of debt is 7.63%.620\n\nEcon One, Second ER, \u00b6 197, Tribunal's translation.\n\n500.\n\nThe Tribunal does not understand Navigant to be proposing that the cost of debt be LIBOR + 4%. Navigant has taken this rate, together with R\u00edo Tinto's and Compass Minerals' cost of debt, as reference rates, and has concluded that the appropriate rate is 7.44%. The Tribunal finds this rate reasonable for 2013. By contrast, it finds Econ One's rate of 11.93% (which was calculated for 2004) inappropriate.\n\n*(f) Conclusions on the discount rate*\n--------------------------------------\n\n501.\n\nConsequently, the Tribunal determines that the applicable discount rate, based on the WACC formula put forward by the Parties' experts, is 18.4%.\n\n**viii. Quantification**\n------------------------\n\n502.\n\nOn the basis of the parameters set out in the preceding sections, the Tribunal has calculated the damages suffered by the Claimants on the basis of the cash flows that their ulexite reserves would have generated in the absence of the expropriation. It quantifies these damages at USD 48,619,578, broken down as follows:621\n\na. Past cash flows (*i.e.*, cash flows that would have accrued between the date of the expropriation and the date of the Award, using 30 June 2013 as proxy): USD 30,081,458. This amount includes pre-award interest, calculated as specified in Section VII.A.6 below.622\n\nb. Future cash flows (projected from 1 July 2013 until the depletion of the concessions): USD 18,538,119.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that, of the total amount awarded, USD 47,229,424 correspond to reserves that would have been depleted by 2029. The remaining USD 1,390,154 corresponds to resources that would have been depleted between 2030 and 2039. The relatively low value attributed to resources is explained by the increased effect of discounting cash flows that lie further in the future.\n\nAccording to the Tribunal's calculations, net past cash flows from 23 July 2004 to 30 June 2013 amount to USD 27,977,499. As discussed in Section 6 below, the Tribunal has applied an interest at a rate of 1-year LIBOR + 2%, compounded annually, on these cash flows, which yields a total amount (interest included) of USD 30,081,458.\n\n**5. The claim for the loss of lithium resources**\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n**a. The Claimants' position**\n------------------------------\n\n503.\n\nIn addition to the value of the ulexite reserves in the concession, the Claimants seek damages in the amount of US$ 736,385623 for the loss of the lithium resources of the Inglaterra, Tete and part of Don David concessions.624 According to the Claimants, this claim is supported by the findings of their mining expert625 and by Bolivia's own governmental studies confirming the presence of lithium in the R\u00edo Grande area.626\n\nNavigant, Second ER, \u00b6 177, table 16 and the Claimants' request for relief in page 170 of their Reply.\n\nNavigant, Second ER, \u00b6 176 and table 15.\n\nBehre Dolbear, Second ER, \u00b6 87.\n\nSNG 2008 Report, Section II, pp. 5 and 7, Exh. BD-37.\n\n504.\n\nIn order to estimate the FMV of the lithium resources within the concessions, the Claimants' economic expert has implemented a comparable transactions approach. Navigant explained the various steps in this approach as follows:\n\nWe first identified recent comparable transactions to arrive at a price per ton of lithium resources multiple. Next, using the data available in the Orstom study and the location of the Bolivian Concessions area, we estimated the area within the Bolivian Concessions that would likely contain lithium resources. Finally, we multiplied the estimated lithium resources within this subarea of the Bolivian Concession by the price per ton of lithium resource multiple to arrive at an estimate of fair market value of the lithium resources.627\n\nNavigant, Second ER, \u00b6 170.\n\n**b. The Respondent's position**\n--------------------------------\n\n505.\n\nThe Respondent challenges this. While Bolivia has described the Salar as \"the largest lithium mineral deposit\" of the world,628 Econ One contends that the Claimants' reliance on the Orstom-Risacher study is flawed,629 that Navigant's estimate is far from conservative,630 and that its comparable transaction approach is invalid.631 Moreover, it generally opines that \"the estimation of the value of the concessions' lithium resources carried out by Navigant for US$ 736,385 is speculative, erroneous and not well-founded.\"632\n\nCounter-Mem., \u00b6 22, Tribunal's translation.\n\nEcon One, Second ER, \u00b6\u00b6 266-271.\n\nEcon One, Second ER, \u00b6\u00b6 278-286.\n\nEcon One, Second ER, \u00b6\u00b6 287-292.\n\nEcon One, Second ER, \u00b6 293, Tribunal's translation.\n\n**c. Analysis**\n---------------\n\n506.\n\nThe Claimants and their expert Navigant have calculated the FMV of the lithium resources for three concessions: Inglaterra, Tete and part of Don David. The other concessions are not included because they are considered outside the lithium concentration area.\n\n507.\n\nBoth the report authored by Orstom-Risacher in 1989 (co-commissioned by state entity *Complejo Industrial de los Recursos Evapor\u00edticos del Salar de Uyuni* (\"CIRESU\"), Bolivia's University of San Andr\u00e9s and French research organization Orstom) and a 2008 report prepared by Bolivia's SERGEOTECMIN report the existence of lithium in the Salar de Uyuni in general and in the R\u00edo Grande estuary, where the concessions are located, in particular. The Orstom-Risacher report describes the Salar de Uyuni as the \"world's first lithium reserve (8.9 million tons solely in the superficial crust)\" and stresses that the \"area with a higher concentration of these elements is located in the superficial crust at the south of the Salar, close to the R\u00edo Grande estuary.\"633 The SERGEOTECMIN report considered it \"undeniable that [the Salar de Uyuni] has an important lithium reserve at the global level.\"634\n\nExh. BD-3, p. 61, Tribunal's translation.\n\nExh. BD-37, Part II, p. 5, Tribunal's translation.\n\n508.\n\nAlthough the existence of high levels of lithium in the Salar de Uyuni is undisputed, the Tribunal is nonetheless unconvinced by the claim for loss of lithium resources in three of the concessions. First, while the Claimants requested Behre Dolbear, their industry expert, to calculate boron reserves and resources, they have tasked Navigant, their economic expert, with estimating the lithium resources, without justifying this differentiation. As a consequence, Behre Dolbear vaguely refers to the \"lithium potential\" of the Claimants' concessions,635 while Navigant carries out the detailed assessment of the lithium resources.636 The Tribunal finds it difficult to rely on evidence from a financial expert to assess a geological fact, such as the existence and extent of presence of a mineral.\n\nBehre Dolbear, Second ER, \u00b6 88.\n\nNavigant, Second ER, \u00b6\u00b6 170-181.\n\n509.\n\nSecond, the Claimants have not shown that they had any reasonably foreseeable plans to extract, exploit or market lithium. They have not established either that they had any expertise and experience in the lithium business and have not alleged that it was essentially identical to being active in borates industry and market. Their economic expert confirmed at the hearing that he was not aware that Quiborax was in the lithium business in 2004.637\n\nTr., Day 2, 184:14-185:10.\n\n510.\n\nAs a result, the Tribunal dismisses the claim for damages arising from the loss of lithium resources.\n\n**6. Interest**\n---------------\n\n**a. The Claimants' position**\n------------------------------\n\n511.\n\nThe Claimants request pre- and post-award compound interest in accordance with customary international law and Article VI(2) of the BIT. Navigant has provided two alternative calculations of pre-award interest on the lost cash flows from 30 June 2004 to 30 June 2013, applying two alternative interest rates: LIBOR + 2%638 and the Bolivian sovereign debt rate.639 This interest has been incorporated into Navigant's calculation of past cash flows, from the date on which each cash flow was due on a yearly basis.640 The same interest rates are proposed for the calculation of postaward interest, which would accrue from the date of the Award to the date of payment.\n\nNavigant, Second ER, Exh. H.1.\n\nNavigant, Second ER, Exh. H.2.\n\n*See* Navigant, Second ER, Exh. H.\n\n**b. The Respondent's position**\n--------------------------------\n\n512.\n\nThe Respondent opposes the Claimants' request for pre-award interest because \"to the extent that the relief sought relates to future earnings, this concept is lost profits. [\u2026] If damages for lost profits were granted, these damages should not generate interest.\"641 Therefore, if applicable, interest should be awarded from the date of the valuation onwards.642 Bolivia opposes compounding interest but agrees with the Claimants on using a rate of LIBOR + 2%.643\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 206, Tribunal's translation.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 210.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 206 and 210.\n\n**c. Analysis**\n---------------\n\n513.\n\nThe Tribunal finds that both pre- and post-award interest are due. With respect to pre-award interest, the Tribunal has already determined that, as part of an *ex post* valuation, past losses must be brought to present value through the application of an interest rate. Such interest compensates the fact that the Claimants were not in possession of the funds to which they were entitled and thus had either to borrow funds at a cost or were deprived of the opportunity of investing these funds at a profit. As to post-award interest, there is no dispute that it should apply in principle. Bolivia accepts that, if compensation is due, \"it should be updated according to a simple risk free rate from the valuation date [\u2026].\"644 The Tribunal has established above (*see* Section VII.A.4.c.i) that the date of valuation is the date of the Award, using 30 June 2013, as a proxy.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 210, Tribunal's translation.\n\n514.\n\nThe Tribunal is aware of the Respondent's concern about awarding interest to lost profits and its allegation of double counting. Indeed, according to the Commentary to ILC Article 38, \"[w]here a sum for loss of profits is included as part of the compensation for the injury caused by a wrongful act, an award of interest will be inappropriate if the injured State would thereby obtain double recovery,\" because \"[a] capital sum cannot be earning interest and notionally employed in earning profits at one and the same time.\"645 However, the ILC Commentary goes on to explain that \"interest may be due on the profits which would have been earned but which have been withheld from the original owner.\" Consequently, if interest is applied to past net cash flows (*i.e.*, the cash flows that would have been earned between 23 July 2004 and 30 June 2013 but were withheld from the Claimants due to Bolivia's expropriatory measure) as of the date on which those cash flows were due, there is no doublecounting. The Tribunal understands that this is what Navigant has done.646\n\nCommentary to ILC Article 38, \u00b6 11.\n\nNavigant, Second ER, table 12 and Exh. H.\n\n515.\n\nInterest must be calculated from the date on which the loss was suffered. With respect to past cash flows, the loss was suffered whenever those cash flows were due and not received, after the date on which the Claimants returned the concessions to Bolivia, *i.e.*, 23 July 2004. The Tribunal thus awards interest on NMM's past cash flows from 23 July 2004 to 30 June 2013, at the rate and on the terms described further below. This interest, which has accrued on those past cash flows as they became due, has already been included in the total value of past cash flows set out in paragraph 502.a above.647\n\n*See* note 622 above.\n\n516.\n\nThereafter, interest shall accrue on the total amount awarded from 1 July 2013 until the Respondent fulfils its payment obligations. Interest accrues on the total amount awarded because the Tribunal has used 30 June 2013 as valuation date.\n\n517.\n\nThe Claimants propose two alternative interest rates for both pre- and post-award interest: either one year LIBOR + 2% or the Bolivian Sovereign Debt Rate.648 Bolivia agrees with the Claimants on using LIBOR + 2% and rejects the alternative interest rate suggested.649 The Tribunal will thus apply the rate considered appropriate by both Parties, one year LIBOR + 2%, which it deems a suitable rate for debts in U.S. currency owed outside the United States over the relevant periods.\n\nReply, \u00b6 460.\n\nCounter-Mem., \u00b6\u00b6 444-445; Rejoinder, \u00b6 210.\n\n518.\n\nThe Claimants argue that \"[b]oth pre-award and post-award interest must be calculated on a compound basis\" since there is a \"strong economic rationale for awarding compound interest, as the most appropriate way to account for the time-value of money.\"650 They contend that the interest rate should be determined in accordance with international law, stressing that while \"damages for breach of contract may be subject to limitations established by domestic law [, t]his is not true for expropriation cases, which are decided under international law.\"651 The Respondent, on the other hand, claims that compound interest \"must be strongly rejected insofar as it collides with Bolivian Law, which requires that the interest rate be simple.\"652 In support, it quotes Article 412 of the Bolivian Civil Code, which reads as follows:\n\nAnatocism and all other forms of capitalization of interests are prohibited.   \nAgreements to the contrary are void.653\n\nMem., \u00b6 217.\n\nReply, \u00b6 472.\n\nCounter-Mem., \u00b6 446, Tribunal's translation.\n\nExh. R-358, Tribunal's translation. The original text reads as follows: \"Art. 412.- (PROHIBICION DEL ANATOCISMO). Est\u00e1n prohibidos el anatocismo y toda otra forma de capitalizaci\u00f3n de los intereses. Las convenciones en contrario son nulas.\"\n\n519.\n\nThe Tribunal must in the first place determine whether it must apply Bolivian or international law to this issue. In the section on the law applicable to the merits of the dispute (Section V.B above), the Tribunal held that, absent a choice of law in the treaty and in application of Article 42 of the ICSID Convention, it was to allocate a given issue to municipal or international law.\n\n520.\n\nThe Tribunal is not persuaded that it is appropriate to apply national law to the issue of compound interest. Reparation for expropriation is governed by international law and full reparation includes interest for late payment. The application of national law may be appropriate for contract claims, but not for a claim of breaches of the BIT. This position is supported by the cases referred to by both Bolivia and the Claimants.\n\n521.\n\nA case in point is *Duke Energy v. Ecuador,* on which Bolivia has relied to support its request for simple interest. *Duke Energy* involved a contract dispute and the tribunal thus \"agree[d] with the Respondent's argument in favor of simple interest,\" adding that \"Ecuadorian law prohibits compound interest in the present case.\"654 However, that same award noted that \"compound interest may be awarded for expropriation but not for contract claims.\"655 Other arbitral tribunals, such as *Santa Elena v. Costa Rica*, have also drawn the distinction between cases involving treaty breaches and those involving contract breaches.656\n\n*Duke Energy Electroquil Partners & Electroquil S.A. v. Republic of Ecuador*, ICSID Case No. ARB/04/19 (\" *Duke Energy v. Ecuador* \"), Award of 18 August 2008, \u00b6 457.\n\n*Duke Energy v. Ecuador*, Award of 18 August 2008, \u00b6 432.\n\n*Santa Elena v. Costa Rica*, ICSID Case No. ARB/96/1, Award of 17 February 2000, \u00b6 97. *See also* *Autopista Concesionada de Venezuela, C.A. v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela*, ICSID Case No. ARB/00/5 (\" *Aucoven v. Venezuela* \"), Award of 23 September 2003, \u00b6 394.\n\n522.\n\nThe Tribunal finds that the remaining authorities relied upon by Bolivia in favor of simple interest are unhelpful. *Desert Line v. Yemen* was a contract dispute and the tribunal provided no reason for its decision to award simple interest.657*Aucoven v. Venezuela* awarded simple interest, but it also dealt with a contract claim governed primarily by Venezuelan law,658 being specified that international law would prevail over conflicting national rules. The tribunal held that the applicable Venezuelan law combined with the pertinent contract provision did not allow the application of compound interest. It also concluded that international law did not require compound interest for contract cases with the result that no conflict arose.659\n\n*Desert Line Projects LLC v. Republic of Yemen*, ICSID Case No. ARB/05/17 (\" *Desert Line v. Yemen* \"), Award of 6 February 2008, \u00b6\u00b6 294-295.\n\n*Aucoven v. Venezuela*, Award of 23 September 2003, \u00b6 105.\n\n*Aucoven v. Venezuela*, Award of 23 September 2003, \u00b6\u00b6 394-395.\n\n523.\n\nAccordingly, the Tribunal shall apply international law to determining interest. The applicable standard of compensation under customary international law is full reparation. Compound interest, which has become the standard to remunerate the use of money in modern finance, comes closer to achieving this purpose than simple interest. Indeed, being deprived of the use of the money to which it was entitled, a creditor may have to borrow funds or may forego investments, for which it would pay or earn compound interest.\n\n524.\n\nThe Tribunal is aware that the Commentary to ILC Article 38, which the Respondent also invokes, states that \"[t]he general view of courts and tribunals has been against the award of compound interest.\"660 Yet, a review of arbitral decisions shows that compound interest has been deemed to \"better reflect[] contemporary financial practice\"661 and to constitute \"the standard of international law in [] expropriation cases.\"662 The view that compound interest better achieves full reparation has been adopted in a large number of decisions663 and is shared by this Tribunal.\n\nCommentary to ILC Article 38, \u00b6 8.\n\n*LG&E v. Argentina*, Award of 25 July 2007, \u00b6 103.\n\n*Middle East Cement Shipping and Handling Co. S.A. v. Arab Republic of Egypt*, ICSID Case No. ARB/99/6, Award of 12 April 2002, \u00b6 174. *See also Occidental v. Ecuador II,*Award of 5 October 2012, \u00b6 840.\n\n*See, e.g.*, *El Paso v. Argentina*, Award of 31 October 2011, \u00b6 745; *Vivendi v. Argentina II*, \u00b6 9.2.6; *Wena v. Egypt*, Award of 8 December 2000, \u00b6 129.\n\n525.\n\nAs to the periodicity, the Tribunal opts for compounding on a yearly basis.\n\n526.\n\nFor the reasons stated above, the Tribunal awards interest on the compensatory damages awarded, compounded annually, at the rate of one-year LIBOR plus two percent. Interest has been applied by the Tribunal to past cash flows as they became due from 23 July 2004 until 30 June 2013, and thus does not need to be added to the damages awarded. Given that the Tribunal has used 30 June 2013 as valuation date, interest shall accrue on the total amount awarded from 1 July 2013 until the date of payment.\n\n**B. Declaratory Judgment and Moral Damages**\n---------------------------------------------\n\n1. Overview\n-----------\n\n527.\n\nThe Claimants allege that, by engaging in post-expropriation acts of harassment (in particular, the initiation of the criminal case in Bolivia), the Respondent has breached its obligation to accord fair and equitable treatment to their investments, as well as its obligation not to impair those investments through arbitrary and discriminatory measures. As relief, they request a declaratory judgment that those standards have been breached, as well as moral damages.664\n\n*See, e.g.*, Mem., pp. 98-100, Reply, p. 170, COSS, slide 78.\n\n528.\n\nThe Claimants also allege that, through its procedural conduct in this arbitration (including through the initiation and continuation of the criminal case), the Respondent has breached other international law obligations under the ICSID Convention or general principles of law. As relief for these alleged breaches, the Claimants seek a declaratory judgment.\n\n529.\n\nAs some of these claims and arguments overlap, the Tribunal will address them jointly. It will first address the Claimants' request for a declaratory judgment, whether as a matter of FET, unreasonable or discriminatory measures, or other breaches of international law (Section 2 below). It will then turn to the Claimants' request for moral damages (Section 3 below).\n\n**2. Request for a declaratory judgment**\n-----------------------------------------\n\n530.\n\nThe Claimants first requested the Tribunal to issue a declaratory judgment under Article 37 of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility at the hearing on jurisdiction.665 Following the Tribunal's instructions in Procedural Order No. 8, the Claimants filed a Request for Declaratory Judgment on 27 May 2011. This request therefore complies with the temporal requirement set forth in Rule 40 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules. The Respondent filed a Reply to the Claimants' Request for Declaratory Judgment on 10 June 2011. In its Decision on Jurisdiction, the Tribunal decided that it would entertain the Claimants' request for a declaratory judgment pursuant to Article 37 of the ILC Articles in the final Award.666 Both Parties made additional submissions on this request in the second round of briefs on the merits.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that already in their Memorial the Claimants had requested an award declaring that Bolivia had breached its obligations under Articles III and IV of the BIT by submitting the Claimants to acts of harassment, in particular the initiation of criminal proceedings, although this request was not articulated under Article 37 of the ILC Articles.\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 308.\n\n**a. The Claimants' position**\n------------------------------\n\n531.\n\nAs already described in the Decision on Jurisdiction,667 the Claimants request the Tribunal to formally declare, pursuant to Article 37 of the ILC Articles, that \"Respondent's conduct in the present arbitration violates its obligations under the [ICSID Convention] as well as its general obligation under international law to arbitrate fairly and in good faith.\"668 In their Reply, the Claimants modified their request and called for the Tribunal to declare that the Respondent's conduct in this arbitration \"constitute[s] breaches of the Respondent's obligation to provide fair and equitable treatment, not take arbitrary or discriminatory measures, and its general duty to arbitrate fairly and in good faith.\"669 Specifically:\n\nThe Claimants [\u2026] request the Tribunal to declare that the Respondent's conduct in the arbitration, in particular: (i) the Respondent's initiation of the criminal case in Bolivia and refusal to suspend that criminal case, [t]hus, knowingly and willfully harming the integrity of the arbitration proceeding, (ii) the Respondent's attempts to benefit from its own unlawful conduct in its written and oral submissions on jurisdiction, (iii) the Respondent's refusal to pay its share of the advance payments, and (iv) the Respondent's bad faith accusations of fraud, both in the jurisdictional and merits phase, all constitute breaches of the Respondent's obligation to provide fair and equitable treatment, not take arbitrary or discriminatory measures, and its general duty to arbitrate fairly and in good faith.670\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 299-303.\n\nCDJ, \u00b6 1.\n\nReply, \u00b6 550.\n\nReply, \u00b6 550.\n\n532.\n\nAs reformulated in their Reply, the Claimants' request is based on the following allegations:\n\na. The initiation of the criminal case by Bolivia was part of \"an orchestrated campaign directed against the Claimants\"671 in order to avoid its international responsibility in this arbitration.672\n\nb. Bolivia's conduct has been disrespectful towards the Tribunal, the Centre and the ICSID system as a whole, including by failing to comply with the Tribunal's Decision on Provisional Measures, challenging the entire Tribunal for alleged prejudgment of the case following that decision, and failing to pay its share of the advance costs of the arbitration.\n\nc. By failing to suspend the criminal case as directed by the Tribunal in its Decision on Provisional Measures, the Respondent has harmed the integrity of the arbitration and aggravated the dispute.\n\nd. The Respondent has used the criminal case to its own advantage in this arbitration, in particular by obstructing the Claimants' access to witnesses and using the criminal case to gather evidence for this arbitration.\n\ne. The Respondent has falsely accused the Claimants and persons associated with them of fraud and corruption, with no regard for the consequences of those accusations for those involved, and advanced incompatible factual accounts intended to deny the Claimants' access to arbitration.\n\nReply, \u00b6 519.\n\nThis is not the first time that the Claimants contend that the initiation of the criminal proceedings violates their rights. As discussed in Section VI.B above, the Claimants argue that Bolivia's postexpropriation acts of harassment (notably the initiation of the criminal case) amounts to a breach by Bolivia of the FET standard as well as an arbitrary or discriminatory measure under Articles IV and III of the BIT, respectively. In their Request for Provisional Measures, the Claimants also invoked their (procedural) rights to the preservation of the *status quo* and non-aggravation of the dispute, the exclusivity of ICSID arbitration under Article 26 of the ICSID Convention, and the integrity of the arbitration proceedings.\n\n533.\n\nThe Claimants contend that Bolivia's conduct amounts to an internationally wrongful act within the meaning of Article 2 of the ILC Articles. This provision requires for the act to (i) be attributable to the State and (ii) constitute a breach of an international obligation of the State. They submit that both requirements are met. First, the acts of the Respondent in this arbitration are attributable to the State of Bolivia. Second, through the acts described above, Bolivia has breached:\n\na. Its international obligations under the BIT (specifically, its obligations to provide fair and equitable treatment and not take arbitrary or discriminatory measures);673\n\nb. Its international obligations under the ICSID Convention (in particular, Articles 47 and 61 of the ICSID Convention, Regulation 14 of the Administrative and Financial Regulations and the ICSID Arbitration Rules),674 and\n\nc. Its general obligation to arbitrate fairly and in good faith.675\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 515, 524.\n\nCDJ, \u00b6\u00b6 63-65; 88; Reply, \u00b6 535.\n\nCDJ, \u00b6\u00b6 63-65; 88; Reply, \u00b6 550.\n\n534.\n\nAs a result, the Claimants argue that, pursuant to Articles 31 and 34 of the ILC Articles, they are entitled to full reparation for the injury caused.\n\n535.\n\nThe Claimants note that, pursuant to Article 34 of the ILC Articles, full reparation may take the form of either restitution, compensation or satisfaction. However, as restitution is not appropriate and compensation is not sufficient in this case, the Claimants seek satisfaction in the form of a declaration that Bolivia's conduct in this arbitration constitutes an internationally wrongful act. The Claimants submit that a declaratory judgment is a permissible form of satisfaction under Article 37 of the ILC Articles, and one that also lies within the Tribunal's inherent powers.\n\n**b. The Respondent's position**\n--------------------------------\n\n536.\n\nThe Respondent's objections to the Claimants' request for a declaratory judgment have evolved. In its Reply to the Claimants' Request for a Declaratory Judgment, Bolivia submitted that the Claimants' request for a declaration under Article 37 of the ILC Articles was (i) premature and (ii) inadmissible to the extent that it exceeds the scope of the remedy of satisfaction under Article 37 of the Articles. The Respondent further submitted that (iii) the Tribunal lacks the power to grant the punitive relief requested by the Claimants, and (iv) relief under Article 37 is not available to investors. In the alternative, the Respondent argues that (v) the evidence fails to support the Claimants' request, and (vi) Bolivia has not breached any international obligation, nor caused any damage to the Claimant that would not be compensable though monetary relief.\n\n537.\n\nIn turn, in its Rejoinder and during the hearing on the merits, the Respondent raised certain jurisdictional objections that it had not previously raised. As in its Reply to the Claimants' Request for a Declaratory Judgment, Bolivia also argued that (i) the Tribunal lacks the power to rule on that request, but now appears to do so as a matter of jurisdiction. The Respondent also submits that (ii) the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction to rule on the Claimants' Request for a Declaratory Judgment because the Tribunal is only competent to decide claims arising directly out of an investment. The Respondent also appears to argue that (iii) the Claimants' request is inadmissible, but other than enunciating this objection in the title of the relevant section it does not articulate this objection in the text of its Rejoinder.676 Finally, the Respondent asserts that (iv) the Claimants have not proved their allegations of procedural misconduct. Separately, the Respondent (v) denies that it has breached the FET standard or subjected the Claimants to unreasonable or discriminatory measures through postexpropriation acts of harassment.\n\n*See* Rejoinder, Section V.B.3 entitled \"The Claimants' request for a declaration under Article 37 of the Draft ILC Articles is inadmissible and legally incorrect\", Tribunal's Translation, (\" *La solicitud de las Demandantes de una declaraci\u00f3n bajo el Art\u00edculo 37 del Proyecto de Art\u00edculos de la CDI es inadmisible y legalmente incorrecta*.\")\n\n**c. Analysis**\n---------------\n\n**i. Objections to jurisdiction**\n---------------------------------\n\n538.\n\nIn its Rejoinder and during its closing arguments at the hearing on the merits, the Respondent raised certain jurisdictional objections to the Claimants' Request for a Declaratory Judgment that it had not previously raised.677 First, Bolivia argued that the Tribunal lacks the power to rule on that request. Although Bolivia had already raised that argument in its Reply to the Claimants' Request for a Declaratory Judgment, it now appears to do so as a matter of jurisdiction. The Respondent's argument appears to be that, as neither the ICSID Convention, nor its Rules of Arbitration, nor the BIT (*i.e.*, the instruments setting out the contracting parties' consent) grant the Tribunal the power to issue a declaratory judgment or to order any other remedy that is not specifically envisaged therein to sanction the Parties' procedural conduct, the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction to rule on this claim.678\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 123, 154-155. *See also* Respondent's closing arguments during the hearing on the merits, Tr., Day 3, 93:3-16. Although in its Reply to Claimants' Request for a Declaratory Judgment the Respondent argued that \"[o]bviously, the Arbitral Tribunal's lack of jurisdiction in this case extends to its jurisdiction to examine Claimants' Request\" (RDJ, \u00b6 3), it did not otherwise deny the Tribunal's jurisdiction to rule on that request for reasons specific to it.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 154-155, 157. The Respondent first articulated this jurisdictional objection in its Rejoinder. In its Reply to Claimant's Request for a Declaratory Judgment, the Respondent did argue that the Tribunal lacked the power to issue a declaratory judgment. However, it did not assert that as a result the Tribunal does not have jurisdiction, as it does now.\n\n539.\n\nSecond, the Respondent argues that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction to rule on the Claimants' Request for a Declaratory Judgment because \"the Tribunal is only competent to decide claims arising ***directly*** from an investment and not claims based on the actions of Bolivia's judicial branches, its procedural behavior or the alleged harassment the Claimants claim they are victims of.\"679\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 125, Tribunal's translation (emphasis in original).\n\n540.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the Claimants' Request for a Declaratory Judgment was made at the hearing on jurisdiction. Both Parties had the opportunity to submit their views on the request during the phase devoted to determining the Tribunal's jurisdiction. Yet, the Respondent chose not to raise jurisdictional objections at that stage.\n\n541.\n\nThe jurisdictional phase concluded with the Decision on Jurisdiction, in which the Tribunal established that it had jurisdiction over the claims of Quiborax and NMM. The Tribunal finds that there is no reason that can justify reopening the jurisdictional issues at this stage, assuming this were at all possible. It therefore denies the Respondent's new jurisdictional objections.\n\n**ii. Objections to admissibility**\n-----------------------------------\n\n542.\n\nIn its Reply to the Claimants' Request for a Declaratory Judgment, Bolivia submitted that the Claimants' request for a declaration under Article 37 of the Articles was premature, \"because it would require the Arbitral Tribunal not only to sustain its jurisdiction, but also to prejudge the merits of Claimants' claims, assess the damages suffered by Claimants (if any) and determine whether the other forms of relief sought by Claimants (including the allocation of costs) are sufficient to compensate such damages.\"680 The Tribunal understands that this objection has been rendered moot, as the Tribunal has decided to address the Claimants' request as a part of its Award on the merits and has already established its jurisdiction.\n\nRDJ, \u00b6 18.\n\n543.\n\nThe Respondent further argues that, because the Tribunal only granted the Claimants leave to make submissions under Article 37 of the ILC Articles, any request for relief exceeding the scope of Article 37 (*i.e.*, relief other than satisfaction) is inadmissible. The Tribunal finds the Respondent's objection excessively formalistic. The Claimants' request for a declaratory judgment is not grounded solely in Article 37 of the ILC Articles. In their Memorial on the Merits, the Claimants had already requested an award declaring that Bolivia had breached its obligations under Articles III and IV of the BIT by submitting the Claimants to acts of harassment, in particular the initiation of the criminal proceedings.681 To the extent that the Claimants' request rests on various legal bases, the Tribunal finds that it was admissible for the Claimants to elaborate on them in their subsequent submissions on the subject.\n\nIn their Memorial, the Claimants requested an award:  \n \"(5) Declaring that Bolivia violated its obligations under Article IV of the BIT by failing to accord Claimants fair and equitable treatment, by submitting Claimants to acts of harassment intended to obstruct Claimants' rights under the BIT;  \n(6) Declaring that Bolivia violated its obligations under Article III of the BIT by submitting Claimants to unreasonable and discriminatory measures, consisting of acts of harassment intended to obstruct Claimants' rights under the BIT[\u2026]\" Mem., pp. 99-100.\n\n**iii. Does the Tribunal have the power to grant the relief requested?**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n544.\n\nThe Respondent contends that the Tribunal lacks the power to grant the relief requested by the Claimants. Although the Tribunal has dismissed this argument as a matter of jurisdiction, it must examine it as part of its analysis of the Claimants' request, be it a matter of admissibility or merits, an issue that can remain open.\n\n545.\n\nFirst, the Respondent contends that the Tribunal lacks the power to grant punitive relief. It submits that \"the Tribunal's powers are limited to those mentioned in the ICSID Convention and Arbitration Rules and in the Treaty, none of which include the power to grant *punitive* relief for an alleged breach of procedural duties.\"682\n\nRDJ, \u00b6 30 (emphasis in original).\n\n546.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, \"[t]he only relief that could operate as a sanction admitted in ICSID arbitration for improper conduct during the proceedings is the award of costs against the party responsible for such conduct in the award.\"683 This sanction is based on the Tribunal's power to allocate costs under Article 61(2) of the ICSID Convention and Rule 28 of the Arbitration Rules.684 By contrast, there is no power to impose a penalty on a State for non-compliance with a provisional measure: the *travaux pr\u00e9paratoires* of the ICSID Convention show that a sanction was expressly refused by the Contracting States.685\n\nRDJ, \u00b6 40 (emphasis in original). *See also* Rejoinder, \u00b6 156.\n\nRDJ, \u00b6 40. *See also* Rejoinder, \u00b6 156.\n\nRDJ, \u00b6 39 (*citing* Aron Broches, Chairman of the Legal Committee, Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes Between States and Nationals of Other States: Documents Concerning the Origin and the Formulation of the Convention, Volume II, Part 2, International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ed.), 1968, Exh. R-226, p. 815.\n\n547.\n\nNor does the Tribunal have an inherent power to grant punitive relief for an alleged breach of procedural duties, the Respondent continues. Bolivia agrees with the Claimants that \"it is within the authority of any tribunal to declare conduct by either party in a dispute unlawful, as an inevitable step in the settlement of any legal dispute.\"686 However, the \"Claimants have not demonstrated how or why a *\u2018firm response'* by the Arbitral Tribunal, declaring Bolivia \u2018 *guilty* ' of alleged procedural misconduct, is *\u2018an inevitable step in the settlement of [the instant] legal dispute*.\"687 The fact that the Claimants only made this request at the hearing on jurisdiction shows that it is not. Nor have the Claimants demonstrated that their claim for moral damages and costs cannot fully make good the injury allegedly caused by Bolivia.\n\nRDJ, \u00b6 45, citing CDJ, \u00b6 82.\n\nRDJ, \u00b6 46, emphasis in original, footnotes omitted.\n\n548.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, none of the cases cited by the Claimants supports their request. In *Enron*, the tribunal did not decide that it had the power to grant punitive declaratory relief; rather, as the parties had agreed that the tribunal could make a declaratory statement, the tribunal only examined its power to order measures of performance and injunction.688 In *Cementownia*, the tribunal rendered a declaratory judgment that was not based on Article 37 of the ILC Articles, granted that relief to the State, not the investor, and declared that the claimant had brought a fraudulent claim as part of its rationale for dismissing the claim.689\n\nRDJ, \u00b6 49, citing *Enron v. Argentina*, Decision on Jurisdiction of 14 January 2004, \u00b6 81, Exh. R-108.\n\nRDJ, \u00b6 50, citing *Cementownia \"Nowa Huta\" S.A. v. Republic of Turkey,* ICSID Case No. ARB/06/2, Award of 17 September 2009, \u00b6 158, Exh. R-186.\n\n549.\n\nFor the Respondent, the punitive nature of the requested relief is evident from the Claimants' statements. It thus argues that \"[o]nly the punitive nature and purpose of the relief, by publicly presenting Bolivia as a rogue State (which it is not), could serve to compensate Claimants' purported damage.\"690\n\nRDJ, \u00b6 35.\n\n550.\n\nSecond, the Respondent further contends that a declaratory judgment under Article 37 of the ILC Articles (*i.e.*, satisfaction) is not one of the remedies available to investors in the context of investor-State disputes. Relying on ICSID case law691 and legal doctrine,692 the Respondent submits that the ILC Articles are not fully transposable to investor-State disputes, and that \"satisfaction is only available as a remedy to an injured State against a responsible State.\"693 As the purpose of satisfaction is to reestablish the dignity, the honor or the sovereignty of the injured State,\" \"satisfaction can only fulfill its role as reparation inasmuch as it expresses a certain degree of *punishment* of the responsible State.\"694 The Respondent also argues that the *Corfu Channel* case does not support the Claimants' request.695\n\nSpecifically, on *Wintershall Aktiengesellschaft v. Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/04/14, Award of 8 December 2008, \u00b6 113, and *CMS v. Argentina*, Award of 12 May 2005, \u00b6 399.\n\nSpecifically, on S. Ripinsky, K.

People's Republic of Albania), Judgment on merits of 9 April 1949, ICJ Reports 4, 1949, p. 35.\n\n551.\n\nEven if the Tribunal were to consider that Article 37 of the ILC Articles is applicable in this case, the Respondent argues that the conditions for its application are not met. Under Article 37 of the ILC Articles, satisfaction is meant to repair an injury that cannot be made good by restitution or compensation. However, the Claimants have failed to demonstrate that they have suffered any injury, let alone an injury not reparable through monetary compensation.696\n\nRDJ, \u00b6 67.\n\n552.\n\nThe Claimants, for their part, insist that satisfaction is an available remedy for investors. Pursuant to Article 37 of the ILC Articles, a State must provide satisfaction if its internationally wrongful act cannot be made good by restitution or compensation. However, they stress that satisfaction may take different forms and is not limited to the examples provided under Article 37. Indeed, one of the most common forms of satisfaction is a declaration of the wrongfulness of the act by the competent tribunal. The Claimants also argue that the Tribunal has the inherent power to issue a declaratory judgment, as it is within the authority of any tribunal to declare conduct by either party in a dispute unlawful, as an inevitable step in the settlement of any legal dispute.\n\n553.\n\nThe Claimants do not deny that a declaratory judgment would serve an exemplary role. Specifically, they submit that \"[t]he cornerstone of an international arbitration system involving States is the fundamental assumption that States will comply with their international obligations, once undertaken voluntarily.\"697 Consequently, \"the Respondent's professed indifference towards non-compliance with its international obligations [...] strikes at the heart of the ICSID arbitration system\" and \"renders unsustainable any court or arbitration proceeding involving private persons and States.\"698 In the Claimants' view, \"the Respondent's open defiance of the ICSID arbitration system during the arbitration cannot remain without consequence\" and \"requires a firm response from this Tribunal.\"699 Hence, as in the *Corfu Channel* case, \"a declaratory judgment by the Tribunal is necessary to ensure respect for the ICSID arbitration system, of which the Tribunal is the organ and to which the Respondent has voluntarily submitted this dispute in accordance with Article X of the BIT.\"700\n\nReply, \u00b6 537.\n\nReply, \u00b6 540.\n\nReply, \u00b6 541.\n\nReply, \u00b6 543.\n\n554.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees with the Respondent that some types of satisfaction are not a remedy available to investors in investor-State arbitrations. Article 34 of the ILC Articles includes satisfaction as a form of reparation,701 such remedy being further advanced in Article 37 as follows:\n\nSatisfaction\n\n1. The State responsible for an internationally wrongful act is under an obligation to give satisfaction for the injury caused by that act insofar as it cannot be made good by restitution or compensation.\n\n2. Satisfaction may consist in an acknowledgement of the breach, an expression of regret, a formal apology or another appropriate modality.\n\n3. Satisfaction shall not be out of proportion to the injury and may not take a form humiliating to the responsible State.\n\nArticle 34 of the ILC Articles (forms of reparation) provides that \"[f]ull reparation for the injury caused by the internationally wrongful act shall take the form of restitution, compensation and satisfaction, either singly or in combination, in accordance with the provisions of this chapter.\"\n\n555.\n\nHowever, it finds that some types of satisfaction as a remedy are not transposable to investor-State disputes. It must be remembered that Part Two of the ILC Articles, including the rules on reparation and in particular Article 37, \"does not apply to obligations of reparation to the extent that these arise towards or are invoked by a person or entity other than a State.\"702 That said, the ILC Articles restate customary international law and its rules on reparation have served as guidance to many tribunals in investor-State disputes.703 In this Tribunal's view, the remedies outlined by the ILC Articles may apply in investor-state arbitration depending on the nature of the remedy and of the injury which it is meant to repair.\n\nCommentary to the ILC Articles, Article 28, \u00b6 3.\n\n*See, e.g.*, *Micula v. Romania*, Final Award of 11 December 2013, \u00b6 916, Note 172.\n\n556.\n\nThe ILC's commentary explains that satisfaction \"is not a standard form of reparation, in the sense that in many cases the injury caused by an internationally wrongful act of a State may be fully repaired by restitution and/or compensation.\"704 It is an exceptional remedy, which is available only \"insofar as [the injury] cannot be made good by restitution or compensation.\"705\n\nCommentary to the ILC Articles, Article 37, \u00b6 1.\n\nCommentary to the ILC Articles, Article 37, \u00b6 1.\n\n557.\n\nInternational case law strongly suggests that some types of satisfaction are a remedy exclusively designed for States. For instance, the *Rainbow Warrior* tribunal stressed that satisfaction \"relates particularly to the case of moral or legal damage done directly to the State, especially as opposed to the case of damage to persons involving international responsibilities.\"706 Indeed, the injuries that traditionally have been redressed through satisfaction relate to injuries that can only be suffered by States, such as violations of national sovereignty,707 or \"insults to the symbols of the State, such as the national flag, violations of [\u2026] territorial integrity, [\u2026] ill-treatment of or deliberate attacks on heads of State or Government or diplomatic or consular representatives or other protected persons and violations of the premises of embassies or consulates or of the residences of members of the mission.\"708 Gaetano Arangio-Ruiz, Special Rapporteur of the ILC, further explains that \"the \u2018moral' damage to the State [\u2026] is in fact distinct [\u2026] from the \u2018private' moral damage to nationals or agents of the State. This \u2018moral damage to the State' notably consists, on the one hand, in the infringement of the State's right per se and, on the other, in the injury to the State's dignity, honor or prestige.\"709\n\n*Case concerning the Rainbow Warrior Affair*, New Zealand v. France, Arbitral Award of 30 April 1990, \u00b6 12.\n\n*Corfu Channel Case*, United Kingdom v. Albania; ICJ, Judgment on the Merits of 9 April 1949, p. 35 (where the ICJ awarded declaratory relief to Albania by stressing that \"the action of the British Navy constituted a violation of Albanian sovereignty\").\n\nCommentary to ILC Articles 2001, Article 37, \u00b6 4, footnotes omitted.\n\nGaetano Arangio-Ruiz, Special Rapporteur, Second Report on State Responsibility, Yearbook ILC, 1989, Vol II, part 1, \u00b6 14, emphasis added.\n\n558.\n\nThe traditional forms in which satisfaction has been expressed (such as an apology) are also better-suited to inter-State relations. Conversely, the injury caused to individuals as a result of harassment, threat or violence, as well as reputational harm, can be redressed through monetary compensation.710 The practice of international human rights courts further shows that the harm resulting from an individual's suffering, distress or impairment of significant values can be compensated in monetary terms.711\n\n*Desert Line v. Yemen*, Award of 6 February 2008, \u00b6 286. *See also* Opinion in the *Lusitania* Cases, US-Germany Mixed Claims Commission, 1923, UNRIAA, vol VII, p. 40;\n\n*Vernava et al v. Turkey*, ECHR Application Nos. 16064/90, 16065/90 etc., Grand Chamber Judgment of 18 September 2009, \u00b6 84; *Villagran Morales et al v. Guatemala*, Inter-American Court of Human Rights, Series C, No. 77, Judgment of 26 May 2001, \u00b6 84.\n\n559.\n\nAccordingly, the type of satisfaction which is meant to redress harm caused to the dignity, honor and prestige of a State, is not applicable in investor-State disputes. This position is shared by authors and tribunals alike. For instance, Ripinsky and Williams have found that \"it is clear that certain rules, such as the one introducing satisfaction as a form of reparation, will be of value only in a State-State context.\"712 Similarly, the tribunal in *CMS* held that, as it was not dealing with a case of reparation due to an injured State, satisfaction could be \"ruled out at the outset.\"713\n\nS. Ripinsky, K. Williams, Damages in International Investment Law, British Institute of International and Comparative Law, 2008, p. 30, Exh. R-220.\n\n*CMS v. Argentina*, Award of 12 May 2005, \u00b6 399, footnote omitted.\n\n560.\n\nThe fact that some types of satisfaction are not available does not mean that the Tribunal cannot make a declaratory judgment as a means of satisfaction under Article 37 of the ILC Articles, if appropriate. Moreover, this is also a power inherent to the Tribunal's mandate to resolve the dispute. The Parties agree - and rightly so - that \"it is within the authority of any tribunal to declare conduct by either party in a dispute unlawful, as an inevitable step in the settlement of any legal dispute.\"714 As the ILC commentary explains and the ICJ/PCIJ case law demonstrates,715 such a declaration can or cannot be a form of satisfaction, depending on the circumstances:\n\n[W]hile the making of a declaration by a competent court or tribunal may be treated as a form of satisfaction in a given case, such declarations are not intrinsically associated with the remedy of satisfaction. Any court or tribunal which has jurisdiction over a dispute has the authority to determine the lawfulness of the conduct in question and to make a declaration of its findings, as a necessary part of the process of determining the case. Such a declaration may be a preliminary to a decision on any form of reparation, or it may be the only remedy sought.716\n\nRDJ, \u00b6 45, citing CDJ, \u00b6 82.\n\n*See, e.g. Northern Cameroons Case*, Cameroon v. United Kingdom, Judgment of 2 December 1963, p. 37 (\"That the Court may, in an appropriate case, make a declaratory judgment is indisputable\"); *Case Concerning Certain German Interests in Polish Upper Silesia*, Germany v. Poland, PCIJ (Merits) 1926, p. 19 (\"[T]here is nothing to prevent the Court's giving judgment on the question whether or not [...] Poland is acting in conformity with its obligations towards Germany under the Geneva Convention\"); *Haya de la Torre Case*, Colombia v. Peru, Judgment of 13 June 1951, p. 16; *Asylum Case*, Colombia v. Peru, Judgment of 20 November 1950, p. 18, 26 (where the Court stated that making a declaration with respect to an alleged breach of the Havana Convention was part of the Court's judicial duty to resolve the existing legal dispute between the Parties).\n\nCommentary to the ILC Articles, Article 37, \u00b6 6.\n\n561.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees with the Respondent that such a declaration could not be punitive in nature. The Tribunal's mandate is to resolve the dispute before it, not to punish the Parties. That said, as part of the process of settling the dispute, a declaration can be conceived in a manner that is not punitive.\n\n562.\n\nWith this legal framework in mind, the Tribunal will now address the Parties' arguments on the merits of the Claimants' request.\n\n**iv. Has the Respondent's conduct breached its international obligations?**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n563.\n\nThe Claimants contend that the Respondent has breached essentially three categories of international obligations: (a) its substantive obligations under Articles III and IV of the BIT; (b) certain obligations under the ICSID Convention, and (c) its duty to arbitrate in good faith. The Tribunal will address each category separately.\n\n*(a) Has the Respondent's conduct breached its substantive obligations under the BIT?*\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n564.\n\nThe Claimants allege that, by engaging in post-expropriation acts of harassment (in particular, the initiation of the criminal case in Bolivia), the Respondent has breached its obligations to accord fair and equitable treatment to their investments and not to impair those investments through arbitrary and discriminatory measures (Articles IV and III of the BIT, respectively).\n\n565.\n\nAs described in Section VI.B above, the Claimants contend that, from the moment on which they filed their request for arbitration, the Respondent initiated a harassment strategy (which they describe as an \"orchestrated campaign\"717) to avoid international liability under the BIT and force the Claimants to give up their claim. This harassment strategy is evidenced by Bolivia's initiation of corporate audits against NMM and the criminal case against Allan Fosk, David Moscoso and other persons related to Quiborax and NMM's operation in Bolivia, as well by the 2004 Inter-Ministerial Memo in which Bolivia sets out its defense strategy with respect to the ICSID arbitration. Indeed, according to the Claimants, in its Decision on Provisional Measures the Tribunal accepted that the criminal case was part of Bolivia's defense strategy with respect to this arbitration.718\n\nReply, \u00b6 519.\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 521-523.\n\n566.\n\nThe Claimants submit that Bolivia's conduct amounts to a violation of its obligations to accord fair and equitable treatment to their investments and not to impair those investments through arbitrary and discriminatory measures. Citing *Vivendi II*, the Claimants contend that measures aimed at frustrating investors' rights and punishing investors for exercising their right to arbitrate amounts to unfair and inequitable treatment.719 Indeed, they submit that such measures are arbitrary by definition, as they lack any foundation in law.\n\nReply, \u00b6 524, citing *Vivendi v. Argentina II*, Award of 20 August 2007, \u00b6 7.4.45.\n\n567.\n\nThe Claimants deny that their procedural complaints have been dealt with in the Tribunal's Decision on Provisional Measures. Although the Tribunal ordered Bolivia to suspend the criminal case for the duration of the arbitration in order to ensure its integrity, this does not render the Claimants' substantive complaints moot under the FET and the arbitrary or discriminatory measures standards. Likewise, the fact that the criminal case has not substantially affected the Claimants' rights in the arbitration does not disprove that the purpose of that case was to deny the Claimants their condition of foreign investors under the BIT.720\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 516-518.\n\n568.\n\nThe Respondent denies that its conduct breaches its obligation of fair and equitable treatment. It contends that, because the alleged acts of harassment ceased once the mining concessions were revoked, they could not affect the Claimants' investment, arguing that the Tribunal concluded as much in its Decision on Provisional Measures.721 It also argues that the claim is based on an unreal and confusing reconstruction of the facts regarding the tax authorities' actions and the criminal proceedings ongoing in Bolivia. Finally, the Respondent submits that the claim is moot, because the criminal proceedings followed up on allegations of forgery related to Quiborax's and Allan Fosk's status as shareholders in NMM and as investors under the BIT, a matter which has already been dealt with in the Tribunal's Decision on Jurisdiction.\n\nDecision on Provisional Measures, \u00b6 138.\n\n569.\n\nIn its Decision on Provisional Measures, the Tribunal did indeed find that \"[s]een jointly with the 2004 Memo, the corporate audit and the criminal proceedings appear[ed] to be part of a defense strategy adopted by Bolivia with respect to the ICSID arbitration.\"722 However, the Tribunal also found that whether such defense strategy amounted to harassment was unclear.723 The Tribunal also found that, while it exacerbated the climate of hostility in which the dispute was unfolding, the initiation of the criminal case did not aggravate the dispute.724 To reach that conclusion, the Tribunal took into account the fact that after the revocation of the mining concessions, the Claimants had no more activities or presence in Bolivia, and that Allan Fosk (the only Claimant implicated in the criminal proceedings) did not live in Bolivia. Under those circumstances, the Tribunal rejected the Claimants' contentions that the criminal proceedings placed \"intolerable pressure\" on them to drop their claims.725\n\nDecision on Provisional Measures, \u00b6 122.\n\nDecision on Provisional Measures, \u00b6 123.\n\nDecision on Provisional Measures, \u00b6 138.\n\nDecision on Provisional Measures, \u00b6 138.\n\n570.\n\nThe Claimants have not provided convincing evidence to alter these conclusions. The Tribunal is aware that Bolivia has not suspended the criminal proceedings and that it has taken various procedural steps in the context of those proceedings that involve Mr. Fosk, Mr. Moscoso, and other persons related to the Claimants.726 While it acknowledges that those steps exacerbate the climate of hostility in which this arbitration has developed, the Tribunal is not persuaded that the criminal case or corporate audits initiated by the Respondent against the Claimants after the expropriation of their investments amount to a breach of fair and equitable treatment or to an impairment of their investments. This conclusion is reinforced by the fact that the Tribunal has declined jurisdiction over Allan Fosk.\n\n*See* \u00b6\u00b6 64 and 66 above.\n\n571.\n\nIn its Decision on Provisional Measures, the Tribunal stressed that \"Bolivia has the sovereign power to prosecute conduct that may constitute a crime on its own territory, if it has sufficient elements justifying prosecution,\" as well as \"the power to investigate whether Claimants have made their investments in Bolivia in accordance with Bolivian law and to present evidence in that respect,\" while emphasizing that \"such powers must be exercised in good faith and respecting Claimants' rights, including their *prima facie* right to pursue this arbitration.\"727 Although in its Decision on Jurisdiction, the Tribunal rejected the allegations of forgery that underlie the criminal proceedings initiated against Allan Fosk and others, it confirmed that certain discrepancies did indeed exist in NMM's corporate records.728 Whether these discrepancies were sufficient to justify prosecution in Bolivia is not for the Tribunal to determine. However, they confirm the Tribunal's conclusion that Bolivia did not act unfairly and inequitably when it initiated the criminal proceedings or the corporate audits.\n\nDecision on Provisional Measures, \u00b6 123.\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 192 (\"On the basis of its review of the entire record, the Tribunal finds that the Claimants' account of facts is consistent and well-documented. Whilst there are some documentary discrepancies - primarily the NMM's and R\u00edo Grande's balance sheets of 2001 and 2003, respectively, and the 11 September 2001 minutes -, these do not prove fraud nor suffice to overcome the plentiful evidence in support of the Claimants' case. For these reasons, the Tribunal is persuaded that Quiborax acquired and Allan Fosk received, respectively, 13,636 shares (50,995%) and 1 share (0,005%) of NMM in August and September of 2001, and that they did not engage in fraud or fabricate evidence to gain access to ICSID arbitration.\")\n\n572.\n\nAccordingly, the Tribunal finds that the Claimants have not shown conduct amounting to a breach of Articles III or IV of the BIT resulting from an alleged harassment strategy following the Claimants' filing of their Request for Arbitration.\n\n*(b) Has the Respondent breached its obligations under the ICSID Convention?*\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n573.\n\nThe Claimants also allege that, through its procedural conduct in this arbitration (including through the initiation and continuation of the criminal case), the Respondent has breached obligations established by the ICSID Convention and has been disrespectful towards the Tribunal, the Centre and the ICSID system as a whole.729 Specifically, the Claimants contend that:\n\na. By refusing to comply with the Tribunal's Decision on Provisional Measures, the Respondent breached Article 47 of the ICSID Convention.730 Contrary to the Respondent's contentions, that Decision is not a mere \"recommendation\" but is binding on the Respondent.\n\nb. By challenging the entire Tribunal for alleged prejudgment of the case following that decision, the Respondent has been disrespectful to the Tribunal and the ICSID system.\n\nc. By failing to pay its share of the advance costs of the arbitration, it has violated Article 61 and Regulation 14 of the Administrative and Financial Regulations.\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 533-534; 535(iii).\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 526, 535(i).\n\n574.\n\nThe Respondent denies contentions (a) and (c). Specifically, it argues that:\n\na. Non-compliance with the Tribunal's recommendation of provisional measures is not in breach of Article 47 of the ICSID Convention.731 Citing the *travaux pr\u00e9paratoires* of the ICSID Convention and legal authority, the Respondent argues that provisional measures granted under the ICSID Convention are not binding and that there is no sanction for their non-compliance. The ICSID tribunals cited by the Claimants erred in adopting, without an independent analysis, the holding of *LaGrand* in relation to the binding nature of decisions on provisional measures by the ICJ.\n\nb. Bolivia's non-payment of part of the advance on costs does not violate the ICSID Convention or Administrative and Financial Regulations, nor Bolivia's duty of good faith. Neither Article 61 of the ICSID Convention nor Article 14(3)(d) of the Administrative and Financial Regulations establish an obligation on the parties to an arbitration to pay the advance on costs. In any event, Bolivia did not breach its duty to arbitrate fairly and in good faith by merely not paying advances on costs.\n\nThe Respondent has also argued that Bolivian law prevents it from suspending the criminal proceedings, as recommended by the Tribunal. *See, e.g.,* Bolivia's letters of 2 June 2014 and 12 June 2015.\n\n575.\n\nThe Tribunal will first address the Claimants' contention that the Respondent has breached Article 47 of the ICSID Convention (1). It will then turn to their allegation that the Respondent has breached the ICSID Convention by failing to pay advances on costs (2). As to the Claimants' allegation that, by challenging the entire Tribunal following the Decision on Provisional Measures, the Respondent has been disrespectful to the Tribunal and the ICSID system, the Claimants do not invoke the breach of a particular obligation under the ICSID Convention. The Tribunal understands this to be another alleged breach of the duty to arbitrate in good faith and will thus address it in the appropriate section.\n\n*(1) Did the Respondent breach Article 47 of the ICSID Convention?*\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n576.\n\nThe Claimants contend that, by failing to comply with the Decision on Provisional Measures, the Respondent has breached Article 47 of the ICSID Convention. It is undisputed that the Respondent did not comply with these provisional measures.732 The question which thus arises is whether Article 47 of the ICSID Convention imposes upon the Respondent the obligation to comply with the provisional measures.\n\nAccording to the Decision on Provisional Measures, the Respondent was to \"take all appropriate measures to suspend the criminal proceedings identified as Case N\u00b0 9394/08 [...] and any other criminal proceedings directly related to the present arbitration, until this arbitration is completed or until reconsideration of this decision, whether at the request of a Party or of the Tribunal's own motion,\" and to \"refrain from initiating any other criminal proceedings directly related to the present arbitration, or engaging in any other course of action which may jeopardize the procedural integrity of this arbitration.\" (Decision on Provisional Measures, Section V). It is undisputed that the Respondent did not suspend the criminal proceedings identified as Case N\u00b0 9394/08.\n\n577.\n\nArticle 47 of the ICSID Convention provides:\n\nExcept as the parties otherwise agree, the Tribunal may, if it considers that the circumstances so require, recommend any provisional measures which should be taken to preserve the respective rights of either party.\n\n578.\n\nIt is true that the ordinary meaning733 of this provision, especially the terms \"recommend\"734 and \"should be taken\" do not convey the notion of a binding order. The same can be said for the context; other provisions of the ICSID Convention use different language when referring to binding obligations.735 Similarly, the *travaux pr\u00e9paratoires* of the ICSID Convention, to the extent relevant as supplementary means of interpretation,736 show that an earlier draft using the word \"prescribe\" was then changed to \"recommend.\"737\n\nIn accordance with the rules of treaty interpretation set out in the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (\"VCLT\"), this provision must be interpreted \"in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in the light of its object and purpose\" (Article 31(1) of the VCLT).\n\nArticle 39(1) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules establishes the specific procedures for provisional measures. It also uses the term \"recommend.\"\n\nFor instance, Articles 53 and 54 of the ICSID Convention use the term \"shall\" in relation to awards.\n\n*See* Article 32 of the VCLT.\n\nHistory of the ICSID Convention, Documents Concerning the Origin and the Formulation of the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States, Volume II, Part 2, Documents 44-146 (1969), SID/LC/SR/16 (30 Dec. 1964), Summary Proceedings of the Legal Committee Meeting, 8 December 1964, pp. 812-815.\n\n579.\n\nDespite this, ICSID tribunals have consistently found that they have the power to make binding orders for provisional measures.738 The rationale is that these decisions derive their mandatory force from the function of provisional remedies, which is to secure the applicant's rights while the proceedings are pending. To use the words of the ICJ in *LaGrand*, \"the power in question is based on the necessity, when the circumstances call for it, to safeguard, and to avoid prejudice to, the rights of the parties as determined by the final judgment of the Court.\"739 While the wording and the context of Article 41 of the ICJ Statute are not strictly identical to those of the ICSID Convention (\"indicate\" instead of \"recommend\"),740 the function of the measures is the same.\n\n*See*, e.g, *Emilio Agust\u00edn Maffezini v.

United States of America, ICJ Rep. 466, Judgment of 27 June 2001, \u00b6 102.\n\nArticle 41.1 of the ICJ Statute provides that \"[t]he Court shall have the power to indicate [\u2026] any provisional measures,\" while Article 94.1 of the UN Charter expressly refers to the binding force of the decisions of the Court, just as does Article 53 of the ICSID Convention.\n\n580.\n\nThe European Court of Human Rights (the \"ECtHR\") justifies the binding force of its provisional measures on the same principles. For instance, in *Mamatkulov*, it stressed that interim measures ordered in accordance with Article 39 of the Rules of the ECtHR:\n\n[\u2026] play a vital role in avoiding irreversible situations that would prevent the Court from properly examining the application and, where appropriate, securing to the applicant the practical and effective benefit of the Convention rights asserted. Accordingly, in these conditions a failure by a respondent State to comply with interim measures will undermine the effectiveness of the right of individual application guaranteed by Article 34 and the State's formal undertaking in Article 1 to protect the rights and freedoms set forth in the Convention.741\n\n*Mamatkulov and Askarov. v. Turkey*, Applications Nos. 46827/99 and 46951/99, ECHR, Judgment of 4 February 2005, \u00b6 125, emphases added.\n\n581.\n\nEssentially the same reasoning was adopted by the *City Oriente* tribunal, which noted that\n\n[\u2026] a teleological interpretation of [Article 47 of the ICSID Convention and Rule 39 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules] leads to the conclusion that the provisional measures recommended are necessarily binding. The Tribunal may only order such measures if their adoption is necessary to preserve the rights of the parties and guarantee that the award will fulfill its purpose of providing effective judicial protection. Such goals may only be reached if the measures are binding, and they share the exact same binding nature as the final arbitral award. Therefore, it is the Tribunal's conclusion that the word \"recommend\" is equal in value to the word \"order.\"742\n\n*City Oriente v. Republic of Ecuador*, ICSID Case No. ARB/06/21, Decision on Provisional Measures of 19 November 2007, \u00b6 52.\n\n582.\n\nIn light of these reasons, the Tribunal will follow this consistent line of cases and the evolution of international law evidenced in ICJ and ECtHR jurisprudence. It thus holds that the operative part of the Decision on Provisional Measures was binding upon the Respondent and was not merely an optional recommendation. It therefore concludes that, by failing to comply with those provisional measures, the Respondent has breached Article 47 of the ICSID Convention.\n\n583.\n\nThat being said, given the text of Article 47 and the relatively recent evolution of international law with respect to its interpretation, the Tribunal does not find that the Respondent's failure to comply with the Decision on Provisional Measures amounts to a breach of its duty to arbitrate in good faith. Bolivia may not have been aware of the binding nature of these provisional measures when it failed to comply with them. In addition, as discussed further below, the Tribunal finds that the underlying right that these measures sought to protect - the right to the procedural integrity of the arbitration proceedings - was ultimately not impaired. As a result, although the Respondent breached Article 47 by failing to comply with the provisional measures, under the facts of this case this breach did not entail a violation of the duty to arbitrate in good faith.743\n\nThe Tribunal sees no contradiction in so holding. Because provisional measures issued under Article 47 are binding *per se*, a failure to comply with them will automatically entail a breach of Article 47. This does not necessarily give rise to a breach of the underlying right that the measures seek to preserve; whether those rights are harmed will depend on the facts of the case.\n\n*(2) Did the Respondent breach Article 61 of the ICSID Convention and Article 14 of the Administrative and Financial Regulations?*\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n584.\n\nThe Claimants contend that Bolivia has breached Article 61 of the ICSID Convention and Article 14 of the Administrative and Financial Regulations by failing to pay its advances on costs.\n\n585.\n\nArticle 61 of the ICSID Convention only speaks of advances in the context of conciliation proceedings. It is silent about advances in arbitration. By contrast, Article 14 of the Administrative and Financial Regulations provides that the parties \"shall make advance payments\" to the Centre in equal shares.744 That wording indeed expresses an obligation to make advance payments.\n\nArticle 14 (3)(a) and (d).\n\n586.\n\nIt is undisputed that the Respondent has failed to make the major part of the advance payments called by the Centre.745 That said, such failure can be adequately remedied by an award of costs and a declaratory judgment is not necessary to resolve the dispute in this respect. The Tribunal therefore dismisses the request for a declaratory judgment relating to the advance payments and will take the failure into account in allocating the costs of the proceedings.\n\n*See* Section VIII (Costs) below.\n\n*(c) Has the Respondent breached its duty to arbitrate in good faith?*\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n587.\n\nFinally, the Claimants allege that the Respondent has breached a series of duties, which can all be understood to be a part of the duty to arbitrate in good faith. Specifically, the Claimants allege that:\n\na. The Respondent's failure to comply with the Decision on Provisional Measures not only breaches Article 47 of the ICSID Convention, but also \"the underlying principle that parties shall refrain from any action that harms the integrity of the proceeding.\"746 Indeed, the Claimants assert that the Tribunal held that the criminal case *ipso facto* harmed the integrity of the arbitration.\n\nb. The Respondent's failure to suspend the criminal case constitutes a breach of its duty to refrain from aggravating the dispute.747\n\nc. The Respondent has used the criminal case to its own advantage in this arbitration. Specifically, the Claimants allege that Bolivia has questioned the authenticity, veracity and correctness of NMM's corporate documents, while at the same time ensuring that the persons who prepared those documents (in particular Claimants' former counsel, Fernando Rojas) would not be available to testify at the hearing. They also allege that Bolivia has submitted \"evidence\" obtained in the criminal case to support its false accusations of fraud in this arbitration, notably David Moscoso's forced \"confession.\" For the Claimants, this constitutes a breach of the principle *nemo auditur propriam turpitudinem allegans*.748\n\nd. The Respondent has falsely accused the Claimants and persons associated with them of fraud and corruption, with no regard for the consequences of those accusations for those involved. Despite the fact that, in its Decision on Jurisdiction, the Tribunal found that the Claimants had not engaged in fraud or fabricated evidence to gain access to ICSID arbitration,749 the Respondent continues to make unsubstantiated allegations of corruption and fraud in its Counter-Memorial. This time, the Respondent accuses Mr. Moscoso of having abused public office and bribed Bolivian senators to obtain RIGSSA's mining concessions, without submitting any evidence of these accusations and ensuring that Mr. Moscoso would not be able to testify.\n\ne. The Respondent has advanced incompatible factual accounts intended to deny the Claimants' access to arbitration (in particular, by accusing the Claimants of fabricating their condition of shareholders after the expropriation, while at the same time accusing them of concealing their condition of shareholders before the expropriation). The Claimants argue that through the conduct described in (d) and (e), the Respondent has breached its duty to arbitrate fairly and in good faith.750\n\nf. By challenging the entire Tribunal for alleged prejudgment of the case following the Decision on Provisional Measures (challenge that was rejected by the President of the World Bank), the Respondent has been disrespectful to the Tribunal and the ICSID system.\n\nClaimants' Request for Declaratory Judgment, \u00b6 24.\n\nClaimants' Request for Declaratory Judgment, \u00b6 24\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 527-529; 535(ii).\n\nReply \u00b6 531, citing Decision on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 192.\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 530-532; 535(iv).\n\n588.\n\nThe Respondent denies the Claimants' allegations. Specifically, it argues that:\n\na. The continuation of the criminal proceedings in Bolivia does not harm *ipso facto* the integrity of the arbitration proceedings. In its Decision on Provisional Measures, the Tribunal only found that \"Claimants have shown *the existence of a threat* to the procedural integrity of the ICSID proceedings, in particular with respect to their right to access to evidence through potential witnesses,\"751 it did not find that such threat had materialized. Indeed, the Claimants have failed to demonstrate that, on the facts, the criminal proceedings have prevented the Claimants from accessing potential witnesses or were unlawfully used by Bolivia to produce evidence for this arbitration. In particular, the Claimants have not proved that Mr. Fernando Rojas (Claimants' former counsel in Bolivia) was unavailable as a witness, nor have they explained what he would have testified about. The Claimants' assertion that the Ugalde brothers were unwilling to testify is irrelevant, as they are not part of the criminal case. As to Mr. Moscoso, the Respondent claims that the Claimants do not appear to consider his testimony relevant.\n\nb. Nor does the continuation of the criminal proceedings aggravate the dispute. Indeed, in its Decision on Provisional Measures, the Tribunal found that the criminal case did not aggravate the dispute nor change its *status quo*.752\n\nc. The Claimants have failed to demonstrate that the criminal proceedings in Bolivia were unlawfully used by Bolivia to produce evidence for this arbitration. This allegation refers to three documents (specifically, Mr. Moscoso's *Declaraci\u00f3n Jurada* (R-22) admitting that the minutes of NMM shareholders' meeting of 13 September 2001 were fabricated; the *Informe Documentol\u00f3gico* (R-146) showing that NMM's practice was to glue typed board and shareholders' meeting minutes over the book's pages where the minutes should have been handwritten, and a certification by the Bolivian *Registro de Comercio* showing, inter alia, that Quiborax was never registered in Bolivia (R-123). These documents were not obtained for the only purpose of being used in this arbitration. In any event, the fact that Bolivia obtained documents in domestic criminal proceedings that are relevant to the arbitration cannot, in and of itself, constitute a \"wrongful act\" or a violation of Bolivia's duty to arbitrate in good faith. The Claimants had an opportunity to contest this evidence, the Tribunal remains free to assess its probative value, and Bolivian officers would have risked personal liability if they had disregarded evidence arising during the criminal proceedings that could be relevant to dismiss the Tribunal's jurisdiction.\n\nd. The Claimants have not proved that by pursuing the criminal proceedings Bolivia has violated its duty to arbitrate in good faith. That allegation \"is absurd and an insult to Bolivia [;], [a]s any other country, Bolivia not only has a right, but a duty to investigate and prosecute serious crimes committed within its territory.\"753\n\ne. The Claimants have failed to demonstrate that Bolivia's jurisdictional objections amount to bad faith conduct in breach of Bolivia's duty of good faith. Bolivia's arguments on jurisdiction are not contradictory, but consistent.\n\nDecision on Provisional Measures, \u00b6 148 (emphasis added).\n\nDecision on Provisional Measures, \u00b6 138.\n\nRDJ, \u00b6\u00b6 117-118.\n\n589.\n\nThe Claimants' allegations refer to different facets of the duty to arbitrate in good faith. The existence of such a duty is undeniable. It arises out of Article 26 of the VCLT in connection with Article X of the BIT. Article 26 of the VCLT provides that \"[e]very treaty in force is binding upon the parties to it and must be performed by them in good faith.\" As stated by the ICJ in the *Nuclear Tests* case, \"[o]ne of the basic principles governing the creation and performance of legal obligations, whatever their source, is the principle of good faith. [\u2026] the very rule of *pacta sunt servanda* in the law of treaties is based on good faith [\u2026].\"754\n\n*Nuclear Tests*, New Zealand v. France, ICJ Rep. 457, Judgment of 20 December 1974, \u00b6 49.\n\n590.\n\nIn turn, Article X of the BIT contains the Contracting State's agreement with respect to the settlement of investor-state disputes, including the agreement to arbitrate under the ICSID Convention, to which an investor adheres by initiating arbitration proceedings.755 This commitment to arbitrate must be complied with in good faith in accordance with Article 26 of the VCLT. In other words, the Parties must arbitrate in good faith.\n\nIn its Decision on Jurisdiction, the Tribunal already determined that the Parties validly consented to arbitrate in accordance with the rules of the ICSID Convention, Respondent's consent being provided through Article X of the BIT (*see* Decision on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 255, 309).\n\n591.\n\nThe existence of the duty to arbitrate in good faith is recognized by international tribunals. For instance, the *Methanex* tribunal stressed that \"the Disputing Parties each owed in this arbitration a *general legal duty* to the other and to the Tribunal to conduct themselves in good faith during these arbitration proceedings.\"756 Similarly, the *Libananco* tribunal held that \"parties have an obligation to arbitrate fairly and in good faith; [\u2026] this principle applies in all arbitration, including investment arbitration, and to all parties, including States (even in the exercise of their sovereign powers).\"757\n\n*Methanex Corporation v. United States of America*, UNCITRAL Tribunal under NAFTA Chapter XXI, Final Award of 3 August 2005, Part II - Chapter I, \u00b6 54, emphasis added.\n\n*Libananco Holdings Co. Limited v. Republic of Turkey*, ICSID Case No. ARB/06/8, Decision on Preliminary Issues of 23 June 2008, \u00b6 78.\n\n592.\n\nThe principle of good faith involves the duty not to perform any act that would defeat the object and purpose of the obligation that has been undertaken by the parties, even if the act itself is not expressly prohibited by the provisions of the treaty.758 As emphasized by the ICJ in *Gabcikovo-Nagymaros*, \"[t]he principle of good faith obliges the parties to apply [the obligation] in a reasonable way and in such a manner that its purpose can be realized.\"759\n\nOliver Dorr, Kristen Schmalenbach (eds.), Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties: A Commentary, Springer 2012, p. 446.\n\n*Gabcikovo-Nagymaros Project*, Hungary v. Slovakia, ICJ Rep. 7, Judgment of 25 September 1997, \u00b6 149, emphasis added.\n\n593.\n\nThe Respondent's obligation to arbitrate provided by Article X of the BIT thus implies the duty not to act in a manner that will undermine or frustrate the arbitral process. This includes, for instance, the duty to refrain from harming the procedural integrity of the arbitration or aggravating the dispute. Thus, actions directed against the efficient conduct of the arbitral proceedings may breach this duty even if such action is not prohibited by the express terms of the BIT or the ICSID Convention.\n\n594.\n\nUnder the circumstances, the Tribunal is not convinced that it should issue a declaration of breach of the duty to arbitrate in good faith. First, the Tribunal does not find that the Respondent breached its duty to arbitrate in good faith by initiating or failing to suspend the criminal proceedings. As the Tribunal has emphasized on several occasions, Bolivia has the sovereign prerogative to prosecute crimes on its territory, and such prerogative is not barred by the BIT or ICSID Convention. Given the existence of discrepancies in NMM's corporate records, the Tribunal cannot conclude that Bolivia's sole purpose in initiating the criminal proceedings was to frustrate the Claimants' rights in this arbitration. More importantly, the criminal proceedings did not cause actual harm to the Claimants' procedural rights. In the Decision on Provisional Measures, the Tribunal found that the criminal case had not aggravated the dispute or changed the *status quo*.760 The Tribunal confirms this conclusion: while the criminal proceedings have undoubtedly increased the climate of hostility in which this arbitration unfolded, they have not rendered the solution to the dispute more difficult.761 It is true that, in that Decision, the Tribunal found \"the existence of a threat to the procedural integrity of the ICSID proceedings, in particular with respect to their right to access to evidence through potential witnesses.\"762 It has not been shown, however, that this threat materialized. In spite of the fact that the Claimants could not call Messrs. Moscoso and Rojas as witnesses, they have presented evidence (including other witnesses) and have had the opportunity to rebut the evidence produced by the Respondent. In other words, the Claimants have had ample opportunity for their \"claims and requests for relief in the arbitration [to be] fairly considered and decided by the arbitral tribunal.\"763 The Claimants themselves seem to recognize this, as they acknowledge that \"the criminal case has not substantially affected the Claimants' rights in the arbitration [\u2026].\"764\n\nDecision on Provisional Measures, \u00b6 138.\n\n*Amco Asia v. Indonesia*, Decision on request for provisional measures of 9 December 1983, ICSID Reports, 1993, p. 412.\n\nDecision on Provisional Measures, \u00b6 148. The Tribunal did not hold that the continuation of the criminal case *ipso facto* harmed the integrity of the arbitration proceedings, as the Claimants have contended. It merely recognized the existence of a threat to such integrity.\n\n*Plama v. Bulgaria*, Order of 6 September 2005, \u00b6 40.\n\nReply, \u00b6 518.\n\n595.\n\nSimilarly, the Tribunal does not find that the Respondent has breached the duty of good faith through its procedural conduct in this arbitration. It is the Respondent's right to submit the factual allegations and legal argument *s* of its choice, and it is the Tribunal's duty to accept or reject them on their merits. More particularly, the Tribunal has found the Respondent's allegations of fraud and corruption to be baseless, and has so stated in its Decision on Jurisdiction and in this Award. It regards this as sufficient relief for the Claimants. Similar considerations apply to the Respondent's right to challenge the members of the Tribunal. A party can exercise this right if it deems it justified under Article 14(1) of the Convention,765 as long as it does not do so for sole purpose of frustrating the arbitral process. The Tribunal finds no indication in the record that this was the case.\n\nArticle 57 of the ICSID Convention provides that \"[a] party may propose to a Commission or Tribunal the disqualification of any of its members on account of any fact indicating a manifest lack of the qualities required by paragraph (1) of Article 14.\"\n\n596.\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, the Tribunal does not grant the Claimants' request for a declaratory judgment.\n\n**3. Moral damages**\n--------------------\n\n597.\n\nThe Tribunal now turns to the Claimants' request for moral damages. It will first address the Respondent's jurisdictional objections with respect to this request (a), before turning to its merits (b).\n\n**a. Objections to jurisdiction**\n---------------------------------\n\n598.\n\nIn its Rejoinder and during its closing arguments at the hearing on the merits, the Respondent argued that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction to rule on the Claimants' requests for moral damages.766 As in the case of a declaratory judgment, Bolivia submits that \"the Tribunal is only competent to decide claims arising ***directly*** from an investment and not claims based on the actions of Bolivia's judicial branches, its procedural behavior or the alleged harassment the Claimants claim they are victims of.\"767\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 123; Tr., Day 3, 93:3-16.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 125 (emphasis in the original).\n\n599.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the Claimants' request for moral damages was made in its Memorial of 14 September 2009. During the phase of this arbitration which dealt with the Respondent's jurisdictional objections, Bolivia filed Objections to Jurisdiction and a Reply on Jurisdiction (dated 30 July 2010 and 13 January 2011, respectively). Neither of those briefs argued that the Tribunal lacked jurisdiction regarding the request for moral damages, nor was this raised at the hearing on jurisdiction.\n\n600.\n\nAs a result, the Tribunal finds that the Respondent's new jurisdictional objections are extemporaneous and therefore denies them. This being so, had the Tribunal not held the objections to be extemporaneous, it would have denied them for the reasons set out below.\n\n**b. Merits**\n-------------\n\n**i. The Claimants' position**\n------------------------------\n\n601.\n\nThe Claimants allege that Quiborax has suffered a loss of credit and reputation resulting from the criminal prosecutions initiated in Bolivia against Alan Fosk, David Moscoso and persons related to NMM, as well as harm to their procedural rights before this Tribunal, as they have lost important witnesses for their case due to the criminal prosecution and intimidation carried out by Bolivia. In reparation, they claim an amount of US$ 4 million.768\n\nReply, Section IX(6). In the Memorial, the Claimants had requested US$ 5 million (*see* Mem., \u00b6 275 and Section X(9).\n\n602.\n\nThe Claimants argue that they are entitled to damages because they have suffered moral harm \"due to the criminal prosecution to which they have been submitted in Bolivia.\"769 They claim that \"[t]he purpose of the Claimants' request for moral damages is to, as far as possible, wipe out the non-material consequences of Bolivia's wrongful acts.\"770 Contrary to the Respondent's contentions, the purpose is not to punish Bolivia.\n\nMem., \u00b6 266.\n\nReply, \u00b6 487.\n\n603.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, it is a general principle of international law that States are under the obligation to make full reparation for the injury caused by an internationally wrongful act, including any damage, whether material or moral resulting from the wrongful act (Art. 31 of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility). The principle that reparation for wrongful acts includes moral damages is also widely recognized by national legal systems.771 In the realm of international law, it was recognized in the *Lusitania* case and is equally established in investment case law.772\n\nDinah Shelton, Remedies in International Human Rights Law, OUP (2005), p. 37, Exh.

CL-17.\n\n605.\n\nCiting international investment awards,777 the Claimants argue that the standard for awarding moral damages is a matter for the Tribunal's discretion. As a consequence, they challenge Bolivia's contention that the *Lemire v. Ukraine* three-prong test should apply,778 requiring that (i) the State's actions amount to ill-treatment contravening the norms according to which civilized nations are expected to act; (ii) the State's actions cause loss of reputation, and (iii) both cause and effect are grave and substantial.\n\n*The Rompetrol Group 548 N.

R-350.\n\n606.\n\nNonetheless, if the Tribunal were to find that this test is indeed applicable, the Claimants are confident that their case meets these requirements:\n\na. \"It is not accepted among civilized nations that Bolivia should have been willing to sacrifice Quiborax's reputation in order to avoid its international responsibility for its wrongful acts.\"779\n\nb. Quiborax has suffered a loss of reputation, caused by Bolivia's wrongful acts. It has been discredited780 and \"will never again be able to set up business in Bolivia due to the public accusations of fraud and corruption by the Respondent against the company.\"781 They also insist on the causal relationship between Bolivia's unlawful conduct and the injury, as Quiborax's reputation in Bolivia would be intact but-for the Respondent's actions.782\n\nc. The Claimants also argue that \"[f]or Quiborax to be effectively excluded from its neighbouring country carries substantial financial costs\" and the deprivation of important competitive advantages.783\n\nReply, \u00b6 506.\n\nReply, \u00b6 498.\n\nReply, \u00b6 498.\n\nReply, \u00b6 502.\n\nReply, \u00b6 499.\n\n607.\n\nAs for the amount of US$ 4 million claimed, the Claimants submit that given that reputational damage \"is very difficult to calculate [\u2026] [and] given the uncertainties [,] a conservative figure is appropriate.\"784 They further claim that this sum \"will assist in placing Quiborax in a position to receive redress for the international wrong. Moral damages are the only way to achieve this.\"785\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 510-511.\n\nReply, \u00b6 512.\n\n**ii. The Respondent's position**\n---------------------------------\n\n608.\n\nThe Respondent denies that the Claimants suffered moral damages, and submits that in any case the sum claimed is disproportionate. According to the Respondent, \"the Claimants' 'moral damages' claim is in reality a claim for punitive damages in disguise,\"786 seeking to impose on Bolivia an exemplary punishment.787 In the Respondent's view, this type of claim is inadmissible in international law and must thus be dismissed.\n\nCounter-Mem., \u00b6 415, Tribunal's translation.\n\nCounter-Mem., \u00b6 415.\n\n609.\n\nEven if this Tribunal were to find that the claim for moral damages does not pursue a punitive objective, the Respondent claims that Quiborax does not have the right to receive compensation because none of the conditions set out by international case law are met. Citing *Lemire v. Ukraine*, the Respondent argues that moral damages can only be awarded in exceptional cases, when\n\nthe State's actions imply physical threat, illegal detention or other analogous situations in which the ill-treatment contravenes the norms according to which civilized nations are expected to act; the State's actions cause a deterioration of health, stress, anxiety, other mental suffering such as humiliation, shame and degradation, or loss of reputation, credit and social position; and both cause and effect are grave or substantial.788\n\n*Lemire v. Ukraine*, Award of 28 March 2011, \u00b6 333, Exh. R-350.\n\n610.\n\nConsequently, so says the Respondent, the Claimants must prove that (i) the State has committed an unlawful act; (ii) the act must have caused damage; and (iii) both the act and the damage must be particularly serious.789 For the Respondent, these three conditions, which must be met cumulatively, have been constantly confirmed by international tribunals.790\n\nCounter-Mem., \u00b6 419.\n\n*Tza Yap Shum v. Republic of Peru*, ICSID Case No. ARB/07/6, Award of 7 July 2011, \u00b6 282, Exh. R-351.\n\n611.\n\nMore specifically, the Respondent contends that:\n\na. Bolivia has not acted unlawfully.\n\nb. Quiborax has not proven that it suffered moral damages. According to Bolivia, investment case law shows that tribunals have been very strict in demanding compelling evidence and numerous tribunals have dismissed requests for moral damages for lack of proof.\n\nc. Quiborax has failed to show a causal link between Bolivia's allegedly unlawful acts and the alleged damage. Indeed, there is no evidence that \"permits verification of economic losses, loss of credit or of clients.\"791 Moreover, \"the Claimants should show that said moral damage is not attributable to its own conduct.\"792\n\nd. Neither the alleged acts nor their consequences are of a particularly grave nature. There are only two international investment cases in which moral damages were granted: *Benvenuti* and *Desert Line.* The former was decided *ex aequo et bono*, and thus has limited precedential value. The latter presented truly extreme circumstances, in which human lives were put at risk, and therefore cannot be compared to the case at hand.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 141.\n\nCounter-Mem., \u00b6 432, Tribunal's translation.\n\n612.\n\nMoreover, even if *par impossible* the Tribunal would consider that there was an unlawful international act and moral damages are due, the Respondent contends that monetary compensation is not an available remedy, because \"this type of damage, by definition, is not financially assessable.\"793\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 133, Tribunal's translation.\n\n613.\n\nIn any case, the Respondent argues that the amount claimed \"is exaggerated and groundless\"794 and that the facts leading to an award of US$ 1 million in moral damages in *Desert Line* cannot be compared with the present ones.\n\nCounter-Mem., \u00b6 439, Tribunal's translation.\n\n614.\n\nFinally, Bolivia asserts that \"in view of the Claimants' irregular conduct in obtaining and administrating the operations, this Tribunal should not move away from the venerable trend developed by recent tribunals, which have rejected claims for moral damages in similar contexts to this unjustified litigation.\"795\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 144.\n\n**iii. Analysis**\n-----------------\n\n615.\n\nThe Claimants seek moral damages in an amount of US$ 4 million,796 to wipe out the non-material consequences of Bolivia's wrongful acts as far as possible. The Respondent opposes this request as a concealed claim for punitive damages, which cannot succeed under international law.\n\nReply, Section IX(6). In the Memorial, the Claimants had requested US$ 5 million (*see* Mem., \u00b6 275 and Section X(9)).\n\n616.\n\nThis request seeks relief for the moral injury allegedly caused to the Claimants by the post-expropriation acts of harassment that Bolivia allegedly inflicted on them and related persons. Specifically, the Claimants refer to the criminal proceedings against Allan Fosk, David Moscoso and others. Thus, the damage at issue does not stem from the loss of the Claimants' investments, but from acts allegedly committed after the expropriation.\n\n617.\n\nThe Tribunal understands that the legal basis for the Claimants' moral damages claim is Bolivia's alleged breach of Articles III and IV of the BIT as a result of these postexpropriation acts of harassment. While the Claimants have not expressly linked their claims under Articles III and IV of the BIT with their request for moral damages, the same criminal proceedings which constitute the basis for part of their FET and impairment claims are, according to the Claimants, the source of their loss of credit and reputation and of the impairment of their procedural rights in this arbitration.797 The Tribunal thus understands that the purpose of the Claimants' request for moral damages is to repair the non-material damage caused by the alleged breaches of Articles III and IV resulting from these post-expropriation acts of harassment. The Tribunal has already held that the Respondent has not breached Articles III and IV of the BIT through post-expropriation acts of harassment. As a result, there can be no basis for a claim for reparation.\n\nIn their requests for relief, the Claimants claim moral damages for Bolivia's post-expropriation acts of harassment, by requesting an award:  \n \u25a0 \"Ordering Bolivia to pay compensation in an amount not less than US$ 5,000,000 for moral damages suffered by Claimants ***due to the unlawful acts of harassment*** by Bolivia, subsequent to the loss of Claimants' investment in Bolivia.\" (Mem., Section X(9), emphasis added.)  \n \u25a0 \"Ordering Bolivia to pay compensation to an amount of US$ 4,000,000 for moral damages for Quiborax ***due to the unlawful expropriation and acts of harassment by Bolivia***, subsequent to the loss of Claimants' investment in Bolivia.\" (Reply, Section IX(6), emphasis added). Although the Claimants link this request to Bolivia's expropriation of their concessions, that link is not made in their arguments.  \n In turn, those same requests for relief characterize Bolivia's post-expropriation acts of harassment as breaches of fair and equitable treatment and the prohibition of impairment by unreasonable or discriminatory measures. Specifically, the Claimants request an award:  \n \u25a0 \"Declaring that Bolivia violated its obligations under Article IV of the BIT by failing to accord Claimants fair and equitable treatment, by unlawfully expropriating Claimants' investment in Bolivia ***and by measures subsequent to the expropriation of the Claimants' investment***.\" (Reply, Section IX(2); emphasis added). *See also* Mem., \u00b6 Section X(5), in which they request an award \"[d]eclaring that Bolivia violated its obligations under Article IV of the BIT by failing to accord Claimants fair and equitable treatment, by submitting Claimants to acts of harassment intended to obstruct Claimants' rights under the BIT.\"  \n \u25a0 \"Declaring that Bolivia violated its obligations under Article III of the BIT by failing to protect Claimants' investment in Bolivia and obstructing its free administration, maintenance, use, enjoyment, extension, transfer, sale and liquidation, by unreasonable and discriminatory measures consisting of the unlawful expropriation of Claimants' investment in Bolivia ***and by measures subsequent to the expropriation of the Claimants' investment***.\" (Reply, Section IX(3); emphasis added). *See also* Mem., Section X(6), in which they request an award \"[d]eclaring that Bolivia violated its obligations under Art. III of the BIT by submitting Claimants to unreasonable and discriminatory measures, consisting of acts of harassment intended to obstruct Claimants' rights under the BIT.\" Emphasis added.\n\n618.\n\nThat said, had the Tribunal entertained this claim, it would in any event have denied it for lack of evidence of any specific moral injury. Indeed, the Tribunal agrees with Bolivia and *Lemire* that the threshold to award moral damages is high. It also shares Bolivia's view that the Claimants' case and the evidence on record do not meet the exacting criteria required in order to grant moral damages. In addition, the Tribunal shares the opinion of other tribunals according to which moral damages are an exceptional remedy.798\n\n*Arif v. Moldova*, Award of 8 April 2013, \u00b6 592: \"The element of exceptionality must be acknowledged and respected. [...] The Tribunal is therefore aligning itself to the majority of arbitral decisions and holds that compensation for moral damages can only be awarded in exceptional cases, when both the conduct of the violator and the prejudice of the victim are grave and substantial\"; *see also* *Rompetrol v. Romania*, Award of 6 May 2013, \u00b6\u00b6 289, 293.\n\n619.\n\nTherefore, the claim for moral damages is dismissed.\n\n**VIII. COSTS**\n---------------\n\n620.\n\nAs explained in the Procedural History,799 both sides seek an award of the entirety of the costs related to this arbitration, including the legal fees and expenses incurred in connection with these proceedings.\n\n*See* Section III above.\n\n621.\n\nThe Claimants' legal fees and expenses amount to USD 7,660,375. They have paid the non-refundable lodging fee of USD 25,000,000 and advanced USD 1,500,000 on account of the fees and expenses of the members of the Tribunal and the ICSID administrative fees and expenses, including the Respondent's second, third, fourth and fifth advance payments.800\n\nSpecifically, the Claimants have paid to ICSID (i) the lodging fee of USD 25,000; (ii) their own share of the advance payments requested by ICSID, in an amount of USD 825,000, and (iii) the Respondent's share of the second, third, fourth and fifth advance payments requested by ICSID, in an amount of USD 675,000 (Claimants' Statement of Costs, \u00b6 12 and Section 6.1).\n\n622.\n\nThe Respondent's legal fees and expenses amount to USD 1,844,051.57. It has advanced USD 150,000 to ICSID.801\n\nThe Respondent has paid to ICSID only the first and sixth advance payment requested by ICSID.\n\n623.\n\nThe Parties have not disputed that the Tribunal has broad discretion to allocate the costs of the arbitration between the Parties, including legal fees and expenses as it deems appropriate pursuant to Article 61(2) of the ICSID Convention:\n\nIn the case of arbitration proceedings the Tribunal shall, except as the parties otherwise agree, assess the expenses incurred by the parties in connection with the proceedings, and shall decide how and by whom those expenses, the fees and expenses of the members of the Tribunal and the charges for the use of the facilities of the Centre shall be paid. Such decision shall form part of the award.\n\n624.\n\nThe Tribunal has considered all of the circumstances of this case and observes in particular that the proceedings have been delayed on various occasions, with related consequences in terms of costs, as a result of (i) the Respondent's proposal to disqualify the Tribunal, which caused the suspension of the proceedings, (ii) its opposition to the Tribunal's jurisdiction and (iii) its request for document inspection of NMM's original share certificates, which took place in the World Bank Office in Paris. Moreover, the Tribunal notes that the Claimants have prevailed on jurisdiction and have established breaches of Articles III, IV and VI of the BIT. In addition, given the Respondent's refusal, the Claimants have had to pay the Respondent's second, third, fourth and fifth advance payments to ICSID, amounting to USD 675,000.\n\n625.\n\nIn light of these factors and considering all the circumstances, the Tribunal concludes in its discretion that it is fair for the Respondent to bear its share of the costs of the arbitration, *i.e.* the fees and expenses of the members of the Tribunal and the charges for the use of the facilities of the Centre, plus 50% of the Claimants' share of those costs. Specifically, the Respondent shall (i) reimburse the Claimants for the second, third, fourth and fifth advance payments to ICSID that the Claimants paid on behalf of the Respondent, for a total of USD 675,000, and (ii) pay the Claimants an additional amount equivalent to 50% of the Claimants' share of the actual costs of the arbitration which will be reflected in ICSID's final financial statement of the proceedings. This allocation does not include the lodging fee, which shall remain the burden of the Claimants. By majority, the Tribunal considers it fair for each Party to bear its own legal fees and other costs and expenses incurred in connection with the case.802\n\nArbitrator Lalonde would have preferred that the Respondent bear 50% of the Claimant's legal representation costs and expenses.\n\n**IX. DECISION**\n----------------\n\n626.\n\nFor the reasons stated in this Award, the Tribunal makes the following decision:\n\na. The Respondent has breached Article VI of the BIT by expropriating the Claimants' investments in Bolivia without complying with the requirements set out in that Article;\n\nb. The Respondent has breached Article IV(1) of the BIT by failing to guarantee fair and equitable treatment within its territory to the Claimants' investments;\n\nc. The Respondent has breached Article III(2) of the BIT by impairing the free administration, maintenance, use, enjoyment, extension, transfer, sale and liquidation of the Claimants' investments through unreasonable or discriminatory measures;\n\nd. As a result of the Respondent's breaches of the BIT, the Respondent shall pay to the Claimants damages amounting to USD 48,619,578;\n\ne. The Respondent is ordered to pay interest on the amount specified in subparagraph (d) above at the rate of 1-year LIBOR + 2%, compounded annually, calculated from 1 July 2013 until payment in full;\n\nf. The Respondent shall bear its share of the costs of the arbitration, as well as 50% of the Claimants' share of those costs. Consequently, the Respondent shall pay the Claimants USD 675,000 as well as an amount equivalent to 50% of the Claimant's share of the actual costs of the proceedings as reflected in ICSID's final financial statement of the proceedings.\n\ng. Each Party shall bear the fees and expenses it incurred for the preparation and presentation of its case;\n\nh. All other claims or prayers for relief are dismissed."}]}
