Republic de\u00a0Panama, ARB/ 06/19.\nBy virtue of the powers conferred by Article 47 (3) of the \u201cRules Applicable to Arbitration Procedures\u201d of the ICSID, and with all due respect for the opinion of the\u00a0majority, I hereby express my dissent with the award rendered, for the following reasons:\nRequired explanation of the dissenting opinion.\nI have jointly signed the above-mentioned award with my fellow co-arbitrators. Although I have actively taken part in the long and detailed discussions, the specific analysis of the issues\u00a0discussed, and the exchange of views on any and all issues involved in this arbitration\u00a0proceeding, I dissent from some of the conclusions and the rationale followed in the award\u00a0rendered. Thus, pursuant to the mission for which I was appointed, I must express my\u00a0dissenting opinion, in compliance with my duty as an arbitrator appointed to decide this case\u00a0rather than in an attempt to diminish the opinions and conclusions of the majority.\nThis duty, inherent to the task of doing justice, is reinforced in international arbitration of investment-related disputes, where arbitrators assist in the birth of a new and genuine\u00a0international judicial review causing some strain to the souls as it intends to enrich and\u00a0strengthen the system, sparing no effort or rigor, in furtherance of this stimulating task of\u00a0continuously building and perfecting arbitration as an institution.\nThis opinion, as it may be noted, does not fully dissent from the arbitration award, since I agree with many of its opinions and contents, which I have discussed, as mentioned above. I\u00a0only highlight in this schematic communication the most relevant points from which I dissent\u00a0following a formal layout in this organized communication which reflects my position in this\u00a0regard. I spare no explanations for this dissent, as it is common in any dissenting opinion, in\u00a0an effort to explain the criterion followed to determine the purpose, content and scope of such\u00a0opinion.\nThe dissenting points of view established are as follows:\nL- Scope of the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction.\n1. -In short, the majority in this arbitration award believes that the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction is\u00a0grounded on the first exception stated in Article XI 2 of the Treaty, in spite of the general\u00a0exclusion of taxation matters subject to this controversy. I totally agree with this opinion.\n2. - The issue, which is the reason for this discrepancy, arises from the interpretation and\u00a0application of the phrase contained in Art. XI, 1 of the Treaty stating that the States shall\u00a0\u201caccord fairness and equity treatment\u2019\u2019 to tax policies related to the investments made in the\u00a0receiving States. The key to the decision to be adopted on the scope of jurisdiction of the\u00a0Tribunal lies in the interpretation and application of Art. XI, 1 of the BIT.\nCase 8:12-cv-01647-EAK-MAP Document 3-6 Filed 07/24/12 Page 29 of 44 PageID 259\n3. -I believe said Article may be construed as an obligation and it may be concluded that a duty\u00a0of fair and equitable treatment is imposed on the states receiving investments as a specific\u00a0standard of application, in any case, in spite of the general exclusion of taxation matters.\n4. -It must be considered, very briefly, that the Treaty as a whole, as well as any other legal\u00a0provision, is ultimately established or construed to cause a legal effect, and to a certain extent,\u00a0notwithstanding its method for execution, is at all times a compulsory rule, i.e., the provision\u00a0must have a consequently legal effect on the situation ruled. Otherwise, we would fall in the\u00a0absurdity of considering legal rules contained within a rule of law, and not necessarily\u00a0consider them legal, i.e., compulsory. This interpretation would not be appropriate especially\u00a0regarding the intention, structure, purpose and cause of rules, much less, in this case involving\u00a0an international treaty between sovereign States. In this regard, it does not seem difficult to\u00a0admit that a mere change of words - from \u201cshall accord\u201d to \u201cshould cause to be accorded\u201d -does not alter at all the meaning and nature of the legal provision analyzed, unless otherwise\u00a0specified in the rule itself which is not the case in this proceeding.\n5. -Admitting the contrary would render conventional rules of international statutory law\u00a0meaningless, vacuous, or ornamental, which is unthinkable. The content of Art. XI 1 is not\u00a0just a mere recommendation exhorting the States to take a certain action. It is a legal rule.\u00a0The rules of interpretation of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, and particularly,\u00a0the rules of interpretation based on the pacta sunt servanda doctrine(Art. 26) would also be\u00a0applicable in this case. Article XI 1, as well as the rest of Art. XI, and the whole Treaty, have\u00a0a legal nature and full efficacy, based on the most simple and elementary legal logic. The fact\u00a0that a sharp or clear language is used to some extent does not at all affect the unequivocally\u00a0coercive nature of the rule contained in Art. XI 1. If the interpretation contained in the award\u00a0was accepted, an international legal obligation would be restricted, or in the best case\u00a0scenario, the States would be dangerously encouraged to avoid fairness and equity in their tax\u00a0policies governing foreign investments and particularly in matters already subjected to these\u00a0policies as a result of said investments, which are the subject-matter of this arbitration\u00a0proceeding.\n6. -Apart from the pacta sunt servanda doctrine contained in the Treaty of Vienna, according\u00a0to which rules may not be interpreted in a way leading towards their non-application, or to an\u00a0absurd or lack of sense, the argument regarding the primary purpose of the Treaty is also\u00a0applicable, which purpose is to grant legal protection and security to investments, through an\u00a0expeditious means of dispute resolution, namely arbitration. From the foregoing, it is\u00a0concluded that, based on a restrictive interpretation, the Treaty provides for a broader scope of\u00a0jurisdiction of arbitration and the protection for the investments made in the State receiving\u00a0them.\n7. -The criterion of the majority expressed in the award rendered, (473) states that the BIT, by\u00a0using the term \u201cnevertheless\" in Article XI.2, has established an exception to the rule of\u00a0Article XL 1, and that said exception \u201cundoubtedly implies that the commitment provided for\u00a0in Article X.l falls without the scope of the State\u2019s obligations under the BIT, the fulfillment\u00a0of which may be directly demanded by investors.\u201d\nCase 8:12-cv-01647-EAK-MAP Document 3-6 Filed 07/24/12 Page 30 of 44 PageID 260\n8. -This interpretation has no connection with the rule analyzed. The term \u201cnevertheless\u201d does\u00a0not imply that Paragraph 2 of Article XI is binding; thus, implying that Paragraph 1 is nonbinding or its legal effect is unclear.\n9. -Both paragraphs refer to two types of rules as to their purpose, scope and ultimately then-nature. Each regulation governs a situation from a different standpoint. First, it must be\u00a0acknowledged that under no circumstances may two rules, a binding and a non-binding one,\u00a0coexist within the same regulation. Both rules are binding as they are, as stated above, legal\u00a0rules. Secondly, the term \u201cnevertheless\u201d by no means implies that the first paragraph is not\u00a0binding as opposed to the second paragraph. It implies something completely different. It\u00a0means that only by way of an exception may an action or claim be brought. It is not possibly\u00a0by any other way. Arbitration may not be requested on grounds other than the ones\u00a0established in Art. XI 2. However, this does not render the rule contained in the Art. XI 1 of\u00a0the BIT meaningless or non-binding. The obligation stated in Paragraph 1, is very much\u00a0related to Paragraph 2.\n10. - The foregoing would not weaken the regulatory capacity of the State with respect to tax\u00a0policies, as mentioned in the Award, as such capacity remains intact. The Arbitral Tribunal\u00a0only hears matters related to the application of the terms of the Treaty governing any\u00a0investments made. Neither does this interpretation render the exclusion of taxation matters\u00a0ineffective. In any case, such exclusion must be analyzed in relation to the provisions of the\u00a0treaty as a whole, including Art. XI (1).\n11. -To sum up: The Tribunal has jurisdiction to analyze the duty of fairness and equity\u00a0contained in Art. XI (a) of the BIT together with the exception, in this case, the expropriation.\n11. - Method for acquiring investment tax credits under Panamanian law.\n12. - Regarding the considerations on the merits of the case, the highlights of the Panamanian\u00a0system for the acquisition of investment tax credits, whether direct or indirect, should be\u00a0analyzed. Said analysis will allow us to infer the consequences of the resolution of each issue\u00a0disputed by the parties and will explain my position stated in this communication.\n13. -The system established for granting investment tax credits under Law 28 and regulatory\u00a0Executive Decree 274 is without doubt the most liberal, as acknowledged by both parties and\u00a0the expert witnesses acting in this case,- and clearly inferred from the analysis of Panamanian\u00a0applicable laws - since the intervention of the competent authority, the GDR, in the creation\u00a0of tax credits and their acquisition by taxpayers is minimal.\n14. - Panamanian law, which was certainly enacted to foster investments, as sufficiently\u00a0proven in this case, establishes a system where rights arise directly from the law, upon\u00a0compliance with certain conditions and requirements, no prior approval, act or measure by the\u00a0competent authority being required for the application of the law to a particular case. Thus,\u00a0tax credits arise from the law (ope legis) and are materialized through the tax returns filed by\u00a0taxpayers every year in compliance with their obligation to pay income tax. Said tax credits\nCase 8:12-cv-01647-EAK-MAP Document 3-6 Filed 07/24/12 Page 31 of 44 PageID 261\nconsist in a deduction from the final amount payable by taxpayers, which deduction was no more than 25% under Law 28 and is now no more than 5% under Law 6.\nThe tax credits are acquired upon compliance with the requirements set forth in Law 28, and are certified in the manner stated in the same law, subject to a later and eventual review by the\u00a0competent Authority, certifying that the statutory and regulatory requirements for the creation\u00a0of tax credits are met.\n15. -This conclusion is supported by both the analysis of Law 28 and the statements of the\u00a0parties and their expert witnesses in several parts of their pleadings, memorials or witness\u00a0statements. Respondent acknowledges in Paragraph 30, Page 16 of its Petition for\u00a0Bifurcation, that \u201cPanama has an extremely liberal investment regulatory framework, which\u00a0does not require foreign investors to request a specific authorization before making any\u00a0investment in the country.\u201d\n16. -The consequences of the foregoing are clear, illustrative and decisive enough to solve\u00a0some disputed issues in this proceeding. Therefore, in my opinion the following should be\u00a0stated:\na) No prior recognition of tax credits by the competent authority is required. Admitting the\u00a0opposite would constitute not only an act contrary to the applicable rule of law but also an act\u00a0relevant to the effects sought in this proceeding, which act gives rise to the liability of the\u00a0State involved. For this reason, it is not acceptable that the opinion of a competent authority\u00a0of the Panamanian Tax Administration may demand a prior resolution for granting tax credits\u00a0- and consequently making them available,- or otherwise it shall face the consequences\u00a0derived from such irregularity. Neither may it be accepted that, under the Law, a statute may\u00a0have retroactive effects on a right vested under Law 28, thus entitling the State to demand this\u00a0requirement or any other.\nb) Tax credits arise directly from the law and are enforced and materialized under the law in\u00a0the manner stated therein. This criterion has been ratified by almost all tax credits granted\u00a0during the term of Law 28, as stated by Mr. Ledesma, an expert witness, and is still applied on\u00a0any existing tax credits.\nc) Tax credits arising from the law under said standards constitute vested rights, subject to the\u00a0safeguards of any legal system, and obviously the Panamanian system, namely: the nonretroactivity of the laws, the respect for such rights and the rule of law.\nd) .-The powers conferred by the law providing for tax credits to the Tax Administration\u00a0merely consist in the power to control and certify requirements, and are absolutely regulated\u00a0and exercised a posteriori, or rather eventually. In other words, the competent authority has\u00a0no powers other than certification or controlling powers, to be exercised a posteriori, to\u00a0verify, if applicable, that the requirements established by said Administration are met.\nIn fact, the powers of the competent authority are limited to certifying compliance with the statutory requirements, under these conditions, pursuant to Law 28. This would\nCase 8:12-cv-01647-EAK-MAP Document 3-6 Filed 07/24/12 Page 32 of 44 PageID 262\nexclude a priori any prior power of such authority exceeding the scope established in Law 28, which gives rise to the rights to tax credits for investments. Any act performed by said\u00a0Authority outside this scope, thus exceeding the powers determined by the law, would\u00a0undoubtedly constitute an administrative act contrary to the Law and subject to the penalties\u00a0stated by the administrative laws and international laws for this sort of acts.\ne) .- The right to tax credits, of any kind, upon compliance with the requirements of Law 28\u00a0and regulatory Executive Decree 274, which shall equal the whole investment amount, is\u00a0vested in the investor, who may use them, as specified by the law, until they are exhausted.\nf) - Vested rights result from the application of a legal provision (the law and its regulations)\u00a0without affecting the regulatory capacity and sovereignty of the State in any way whatsoever\u00a0-following an absolutely logical rationale- to regulate policies as it may deem appropriate in\u00a0the future while complying with any past regulations under the terms, if any, established by\u00a0specific provisions of interim laws.\ng) - Any constraints to the enforcement or the content of a right imposed by a subsequent law\u00a0would violate the principle of due respect for vested rights and non-retroactivity of the law,\u00a0even if the person entitled to such right has failed to enforce it, which failure shall not\u00a0constitute a waiver of such right. Failure to enforce a right does not affect its content,\u00a0regulatory framework, powers and any circumstances related to such right. In summary, it\u00a0does not affect such right at all.\nIII.- Transferability of indirect investment tax credits under the law.\n17. - The issue of whether indirect investment tax credits may be transferred, by issuing\u00a0bonds, stock or other securities, is a central issue in this dispute, since, as specifically\u00a0mentioned by the majority (mainly on Paragraph No. 552, as well as on Paragraphs 616, 560,\u00a0464, 465, 489, 1 and 2, 498, 499, 668, 669, 672, 687, among others in this arbitration Award),\u00a0Respondent\u2019s denial to consider this possibility, as one of the characteristics of said tax\u00a0credits, is the main cause of action brought by Claimants, on the grounds that their rights in\u00a0the stock investment in Copesa have been infringed on, through measures directly attributable\u00a0to the receiving State - i.e., by both the statements of Mr. Mirones and the opinion of the\u00a0GDR dated January 27, 2005-, which were founded, among other grounds, on the legal\u00a0constraint to transfer indirect investment tax credits to third parties, as expressly stated\u00a0therein.\nTherefore, the foregoing is an emblematic and fundamental issue in this controversy especially because, as repeatedly stated in the Award rendered, it would be irrelevant and\u00a0unnecessary to resolve several other issues raised, as, in any case, indirect investment tax\u00a0credits may not be transferred under Panamanian law.\nWith due respect for the position adopted in this regard by my fellow arbitrators, I notoriously disagree with this statement, as explained below.\n18. -According to the majority, with whom I absolutely agree, the prohibition to assign and\u00a0offset tax credits, i.e., to transfer such credits, as established under Law 28 would only affect\nCase 8:12-cv-01647-EAK-MAP Document 3-6 Filed 07/24/12 Page 33 of 44 PageID 263\ndirect investment tax credits: \u201cand the law does not expressly prohibit the transfer of indirect investment tax credits\u201d (586). It is thereby recognized, through an accurate and final\u00a0grammatical, systematic and semantic interpretation of the law and the regulatory Executive\u00a0Decree that indirect investment tax credits are not covered by this prohibition. Thus, one of\u00a0the main issues of this controversy raised and developed in this arbitration proceeding is\u00a0clearly resolved. This way, the disputed issue regarding the scope of the prohibition is\u00a0resolved. (585).\n19. - However, the Award subsequently provides that neither Law 28 nor its regulatory\u00a0Executive Decree provide for the transferability of tax credits and, in any case, given this\u00a0uncertainty, Claimants should have requested clarification by the Authority. If it was intended\u00a0that securities should carry tax credits it would have been expressly stated in the law. It finally\u00a0concludes that Law 28 and Executive Decree 274 do not allow for the transfer of indirect\u00a0investment tax credits.\n20. -I disagree with both the rationale followed by the arbitrators and their conclusion, as I\u00a0rather believe that Law 28 does allow the transferability of indirect investment tax credits.\u00a0What is more, it is not only allowed but it is also the purpose of the law. My opinion is based\u00a0on the reasons briefly explained below:\na) Nothing contained in the law generating tax credits, Law 28, resembles a\u00a0prohibition to transfer indirect investment tax credits or leads to the conclusion that indirect\u00a0investment tax credits cannot be transferred to third parties. First, the phrase used in\u00a0reference to the allocation of tax credits to \u201call taxpayers\u201d, without any distinction in this\u00a0regard, is another argument, certainly valid, supporting the argument that the law refers to all\u00a0classes of taxpayers rather than initial indirect investors only; thus, certainly leading towards\u00a0the conclusion that tax credits are inherent transferable to such securities.\nb) The conclusion that in the absence of a statutory provision in this regard, it should\u00a0be inferred that the law does not allow tax credit transferability, or otherwise, it would so state\u00a0it, should also be disregarded. The Award, however, clearly distinguishes both kinds of\u00a0investments, i.e., direct and indirect, in this regard, stating that direct investments may not be\u00a0transferred whereas indirect investments are not subject to this prohibition.\nc) The Panamanian legislature has, undoubtedly, included in the Law an explicit and\u00a0convincing reference supporting tax credit transferability, namely: indirect investment tax\u00a0credits are awarded as a result of third parties\u2019 contributions in exchange for \u201cbonds, stock\u00a0and other securities,\u201d This reference sufficiently illustrates the definition of the term\u00a0\u201csecurities,\u201d, which by nature are intrinsically negotiable, i.e., transferable. The argument\u00a0supporting their transferability is not based on the potential use of tax credits by foreign\u00a0investors, since such argument, as stated in the award, would logically be insufficient, but on\u00a0the reference to a complete and well-defined legal concept, such as the term \u201csecurities\u201d,\u00a0included in the Law.\nCase 8:12-cv-01647-EAK-MAP Document 3-6 Filed 07/24/12 Page 34 of 44 PageID 264\nd) An opposite interpretation is not only unnatural but it would also undermine\u00a0incentives based on the contribution of funds by third parties, thus diminishing indirect\u00a0investment tax credits to almost nothing.\ne) Besides, based on the premise that tax credits may not be transferred, it should be\u00a0concluded that such incentive is senseless. Based on the pacta sunt servanda doctrine, its\u00a0teleological interpretation, and nature (ultimately in accordance with the rule of law), it may\u00a0be concluded that it is absurd to deny the transferability of indirect investment tax credits.\nf) Apart from all of the above, it is unbelievably difficult to analyze securities, subject\u00a0to a specific regulation, and the tax credits they carry as two separate elements. This separate\u00a0analysis would once again be contrary to the rule of law, as the law precisely treats them as a\u00a0whole, including their consequences, type and nature of securities carrying indirect\u00a0investment tax credits.\nBesides, nowhere in the Law is this distinction between securities and tax credits expressed, nor are different regulations or effects allocated to each of them severally.\ng) As Law 28 provides for a well-defined form of indirect investment by way of\u00a0securities, essentially negotiable, any potential doubt, as stated in the Award, is cleared. The\u00a0Law incorporates a well-defined concept, i.e., securities, subject to specific regulations. It is\u00a0not necessary to resort to detailed descriptions to determine their applicable regulations; on\u00a0the contrary, in compliance with the principle of legality, the Law should have to expressly\u00a0state that the rules normally governing the tax credits included in securities were repealed and\u00a0that tax credits were not transferable. The foregoing, would by no means affect the existence\u00a0or scope of the controlling powers of the Tax Administration, which are to be exercised -always - in strict compliance with the principle of legality.\n21. -The conclusion is illustrative: the transferability of this sort of tax credits is not only\u00a0founded in the law but is also one of its essential features. Denying such transferability is not\u00a0only a relevant act for the purposes of this proceeding but also implies a denial of the right to\u00a0tax credits as provided for by the law. Such denial has immediate and clear consequences, as\u00a0expressed below, on the claims discussed in this proceeding.\nIV.- Asset depreciation as an impediment extinguishing the right to tax credits.\n22. -Law 28 stated that asset depreciation could not be deduced as an expense, where the right\u00a0to tax credits is exercised. This is one of the most relevant issues in this arbitration\u00a0proceeding, as the parties had raised the issue of whether the rights over tax credits, direct and\u00a0indirect, should be extinguished or not as a result of the asset depreciation performed by\u00a0Copesa in some years. This issue affects the availability of indirect investment tax credits,\u00a0which is one of the main issues in this proceeding; thus, the Arbitral Tribunal must rule on\u00a0this issue and may not avert arguing that it is irrelevant because it has been concluded that tax\u00a0credits of this kind are not transferable or, in any case, that the planned sale of Claimants\u2019\u00a0stock would have failed anyway, as argued by the majority (606, 603).\nCase 8:12-cv-01647-EAK-MAP Document 3-6 Filed 07/24/12 Page 35 of 44 PageID 265\n23. - The fact that a taxpayer has not enforced its right to tax credits, does not mean that it is\u00a0prevented from doing so in the following years, if such credit has been accumulated. Pursuant\u00a0to Paragraph 1 of the Article added to the Tax Code by Law 28: \u201cindirect investment tax\u00a0credits may be applied in several fiscal years up to the amount of the investment giving rise\u00a0to it.\u201d The same is true of indirect investment credits given the extent established by the Law\u00a0on Paragraph 3.\nThe foregoing means that even though such credits have not been used, for any reason whatsoever, even because it has been admitted that assets were depreciated some years, such\u00a0credits may still be used in the following years until they are exhausted.\n24. - It should also be pointed out that depreciation is not, strictly speaking, a benefit but a\u00a0deduction allowed, as a general rule, in every tax return following the efficiency as well as the\u00a0tax fairness and equity criteria, thus, it was not intended as a real benefit. The deduction of\u00a0any asset depreciation or amortization is a general rule applied to avoid overlapping income\u00a0based on the useful life of assets.\nIt is also aimed at encouraging the renewal of assets based on their useful life. So, the fact that asset depreciation is considered a benefit and may not be exercised if tax credits are applied\u00a0may often render this incentive ineffective more than once. As a result, the foregoing\u00a0supports the rule stating that investors should exercise this right on an annual basis in their\u00a0income tax returns and the opinion that asset depreciation and tax credits are not equivalent\u00a0terms.\n25. -In this regard, in my opinion the majority Award is undoubtedly right as it resolves (600)\u00a0that the right to tax credits is exercised, as well as the deduction of taxable income due to\u00a0asset depreciation, on an annual basis upon the filing of the annual income Tax Return and\u00a0that the fact that such assets have been depreciated over one or several years does not\u00a0extinguish any vested rights. This way, the rights of holders of tax credits for investments in\u00a0stock are not extinguished as a result of the depreciation of Copesa\u2019s assets.\n26. -1 could not agree with it more. However, my dissent is based on the fact that I believe\u00a0that not all inferences from this conclusion are adequate. Since I believe that once a right to a\u00a0tax credit has been vested, it remains valid, whether in whole or in part, until it is exhausted.\u00a0This is the same as asserting that the right is incorporated to its holder\u2019s assets and liabilities,\u00a0and such holder may use any unused balance until it is exhausted in as many years as\u00a0necessary. It is a vested right which may not be altered or modified given its own features,\u00a0nature and content. However, it is, in any case, an economic value being used.\n27. - On the contrary, the majority reincorporates into their Award the doctrine of the nontransferability of indirect investment tax credits to justify the denial of a vested right, based on\u00a0a mere speculative analysis of the interest that any the potential purchasers may actually have\u00a0in Copesa\u2019s stock, or the expected success of a stock sale in the following years, due to the\u00a0depreciation performed by Copesa from 1998 to 2006. Irrespectively of whether the planned\u00a0sale of stock would have been successful or not, though it may, as stated by the relevant\u00a0witnesses (such as Mr. Smith), given its special terms, the relevant issue in this case is to\nCase 8:12-cv-01647-EAK-MAP Document 3-6 Filed 07/24/12 Page 36 of 44 PageID 266\ndetermine if the right exists until credits are exhausted, and if it may be exercised through the sale of stock carrying such right, as stated above. Blaming the non-transferability of tax\u00a0credits or the asset depreciation for the potential failure of the sale of stock is contrary to the\u00a0law and disregards a priori the interest of purchasers for the right to a large tax credit, per se,\u00a0and is a conclusion based on mere conjectures.\nV.- Permanence of the right to tax credits.\n28. - Proceeding with the explanation of the solution to the controversy, the mechanism for\u00a0acquiring tax credits under Panamanian law having been explained, it must be determined if\u00a0the right arising out of the law has ever been subject to any modifications as to its content,\u00a0regulatory framework or availability, as a result of the changes in the applicable legislation.\n29. -In this regard it is worth pointing out that the dispute concerns two types of rights arising\u00a0from two different paths. First, the rights arising from the failed attempt to issue bonds\u00a0planned in 2005 for the purpose of meeting Copesa\u2019s liabilities. Secondly, the rights arising\u00a0from an investment in Copesa stock made in 1998.\n30. -Regarding the first point, I totally agree with the majority. This may be inferred from a\u00a0simple rationale: the rights to tax credits did not arise in 1998, as the bond issue was not\u00a0approved and the issue planned in 2005 was not governed by Law 28 as it had been repealed.\u00a0Under the law, said rights have never arisen for this kind of investment, and a transaction\u00a0made in 2005 may not be transformed into an operation planned seven years earlier.\nAs a result of the foregoing, the issue over the legal effect of the opinion of the GDR dated August 26, 2004 becomes irrelevant, in a few words, because the right has never arisen in the\u00a0form of an indirect investment made through a bond issue, so if it has never arisen, it\u00a0obviously may not be transferred. However, it is hard to accept a priori that in general an\u00a0inquiry based on the right to claim and filed with the government may be immaterial, i.e.,\u00a0lacking legal substance, as even if it may not give rise per se to any rights, it may give rise to\u00a0administrative liability for a breach of the duty of legitimate trust applicable to government\u00a0entities, as provided for by the Constitution. Especially given that the inquirers may aim to\u00a0obtain an integral reply from the Authority ensuring certainty as to the application of the law.\u00a0However, it is also true that the arbitrators may not exceed the scope of the claims brought by\u00a0the parties and the controversy, and the parties agree on the non-binding effect, per se, of the\u00a0opinions in this case.\n31. - A different matter is, in my opinion, the issue related to the second paragraph of the\u00a0treaties. Claimants\u2019 rights to indirect investment tax credits eventually arose by operation of\u00a0law, in terms of their grounds, conditions and requirements, as stated in the Award, and have\u00a0not been used, thus being available until exhaustion, whether directly or through its transfer\u00a0and negotiation with third parties and based on the provisions of the law.\n32. -It must now be determined if those same rights have been subjected to modification or any\u00a0other act adversely affecting their existence and availability, through the repeated\u00a0interventions of the legislative power by Law 20, Law 54 and Law 6.\nCase 8:12-cv-01647-EAK-MAP Document 3-6 Filed 07/24/12 Page 37 of 44 PageID 267\n33. -From my point of view, this right and its effective availability is proven in this proceeding\u00a0by several circumstances which I briefly explain below: a) the right arising from Law 28 to\u00a0the indirect investment tax credit associated to the acts of Claimants in Copesa remains in\u00a0force, in terms of its content and full regulatory framework, under Art. 3 of the CC and Art.\u00a046 of the PC (regarding vested rights and the non-retroactivity of the law); b) because, in any\u00a0case, Law 20, repealing Law 28, did not affect the legal rights vested under the repealed law;\u00a0c) because, certainly, and in any case, Claimants were protected by Copesa\u2019s statement, as\u00a0provided for by Law 54, Tax Stability Act, for a term of ten years, d) because additionally,\u00a0and irrespective of whether Law 6 contained per se some provisions which might encroach on\u00a0vested rights, the truth is that, in any case, Claimants had also complied with the required tax\u00a0credit statement, as stated in the award.\n34. -Three issues are indeed raised in this respect: a) the scope of the protection granted to the\u00a0rights arising from Law 28; b) the protection of Law 54 to shareholders; c) the validity of Law\u00a06, in relation to the vested and consolidated right to indirect investment tax credits.\n35. -With regard to the first issue, nothing prevents the application of the provisions of the CC\u00a0and the PC on the need for respect of vested rights and the non-retroactivity of the law in this\u00a0case, and that consequently, a legal situation protected by broad constitutional safeguards may\u00a0arise. In general, a vested right does not a priori result in the type of stagnation mentioned in\u00a0the Award, which would restrict the regulatory capacity of the legislative power. Nothing is\u00a0further from that, since one thing is to protect an existing legal situation, and quite another to\u00a0exercise that ability in general, for the future and on the assumptions chosen by the sovereign\u00a0legislative power.\n36. - With regard to the second issue, it should be highlighted that Copesa was registered\u00a0through resolution on September 14, 1999. This meant that, in spite of having a vested right\u00a0to the credits, Copesa subjected itself to the provisions of Law 54. This registration\u00a0guaranteed at least legal and tax stability for a period of ten years for the company and its\u00a0shareholders, as it may be logically inferred from Law 54 through an interpretation consistent\u00a0with its purpose.\n37. -It should be noted that both Copesa and its shareholders had vested rights trader Law 28\u00a0and this vested legal right did not imply that registration or applying for legal certainty was\u00a0required in order to be entitled to stability. Nonetheless, Copesa applied for registration in\u00a0September 1999, thus reinforcing the availability of such rights under Law 28, which protects\u00a0vested rights, and Law 54, as it guarantees legal stability until 2009.\n38. - The Award does adopt this conclusion, as it denies the effects of Copesa\u2019s registration\u00a0with respect to the shareholders entitled to indirect investment tax credits, thus depriving them\u00a0of the stability guaranteed by Law 54. However, without prejudice to the fact that the\u00a0shareholders\u2019 rights, in any case, were already protected by Article 3 CC and Article 46 PC, I\u00a0believe that Copesa\u2019s registration protected the rights of the shareholders entitled to indirect\u00a0investment tax credits. For several reasons, as explained below:\n10\nCase 8:12-cv-01647-EAK-MAP Document 3-6 Filed 07/24/12 Page 38 of 44 PageID 268\na) Because Law 28 does not provide for the registration of holders of indirect investment tax\u00a0credits, as it is likely that the statement made by Copesa would extend to the shareholders\u00a0entitled to indirect investment tax credits. Once Copesa applied for registration, it is not\u00a0necessary or, simply, impossible to register its shareholders or other holders of such credits, as\u00a0stated by the expert witness acting in this proceeding (Ledesma, Alem\u00e1n).\nb) Because Copesa, the registered entity, is a vehicle managing all resources, irrespective of\u00a0their type and source. It must not be forgotten that, even though the source and nature of a\u00a0direct and an indirect investment are different, the allocation of the total investment to the\u00a0plant was determined by Copesa, using both types of resources, its own, through a loan, and\u00a0external resources, consisting of shareholders\u2019 contributions. Copesa is to materialize the\u00a0investment, and determine its type, by way of the relevant transactions from time to time.\u00a0Consequently, it is Copesa\u2019s responsibility to perform the transactions and initiate the\u00a0formalities required by law. Any opposite interpretation would be contrary to the nature of tax\u00a0credits and the permitted management of the investment by the entity, which is to comply\u00a0with the requirements of the law: investing all available resources, irrespective of their source,\u00a0in activities inherent to power generation. Indirect investors can hardly meet these\u00a0requirements individually. An opposite interpretation would certainly lead to an absurd and\u00a0would be contrary to the spirit and the letter of the law creating such requirements.\nc) Because the registration required under Law 54 would have no constitutive effectiveness,\u00a0in detriment to the law creating such rights, Law 28, which fails to include any reference in\u00a0this regard.\nRegistration may not have a constitutive effectiveness, as otherwise, we would be facing an evident degradation of the legal system, as vested rights would be eroded up to the point that\u00a0they would practically be denied and would arise once again upon registration.\nd) Because of the argument maintained in the Award on the need to avoid double benefit\u00a0records, as a result of which, it would not be possible to record credits in a company which\u00a0has already been registered. The foregoing would support the theory that the statement made\u00a0by Copesa extends to or protects the credits of shareholders and holders of any other securities\u00a0carrying indirect investment tax credits. Assuming that Copesa has applied for registration, it\u00a0must certainly have included all the resources managed by it, obtained, as mentioned above,\u00a0from other investments. Any express statement regarding shareholders\u2019 credits, would at least\u00a0imply the accrual of double benefits which is precisely what the law seeks to avoid.\nConsequently, registration also extends to the investments made by shareholders, which are managed for all purposes by Copesa.\n39. With regard to the third issue mentioned above, it must be highlighted that, subject to the\u00a0foregoing, the shareholders met the requirements stated in Law 6 related to tax credits, within\u00a0a period of one hundred and eighty days as from the date said law became effective, and\u00a0irrespectively of its irregularity, as stated in the Award. No conclusions should be derived\u00a0from it with respect to the availability of tax credits for Copesa\u2019s shareholders, as it is widely\u00a0proven that the right of shareholders persists and is not extinguished anyway. In this regard,\n11\nCase 8:12-cv-01647-EAK-MAP Document 3-6 Filed 07/24/12 Page 39 of 44 PageID 269\nthe Award only states that, in any case, the right was not transferable and that for such reason the following issue is irrelevant: \u201cas stated above, the Arbitral Tribunal deems the debate to\u00a0be irrelevant because Panamanian tax law does not allow the transfer of indirect investment\u00a0tax credits, regardless of Law 6.\u201d (638).\n40.- I believe the problem at this point lies in determining if the right under Law 28, for indirect investments in stock has been extinguished, by virtue of the laws, as alleged by\u00a0Respondent. The Award rather evades the issue. But in my opinion, the fact that the right is\u00a0transferable or not, does not exempt the Tribunal from deciding if the right exists as it must\u00a0exist before it may be transferred. Thus, the issue of relevance is of utmost importance at this\u00a0point, naturally, irrespective of whether such rights are transferrable or not, as it has been\u00a0stated above.\n4L- To sum up, and as explained above, I believe that indirect investment tax credits to which shareholders are entitled, were valid and available, as well as transferable, until they were\u00a0subjected to the encroachment of the State, which is the basis of the issues raised in this\u00a0arbitration proceeding.\nVI.- The measures taken by the Republic have merits to be deemed equivalent to expropriation in terms of the Treaty.\n42. - To sum up, the award denies the existence of an indirect expropriation based on the fact\u00a0that the measures attributable to the State are not susceptible of producing an effect equivalent\u00a0to that of an expropriation, and that, in any case, these measures may not fall within the\u00a0standard of indirect expropriation contained in the BIT.\n43. - With regard to the first part, the Award determines: 1) the non-existence of measures\u00a0affecting the rights of Claimants though opinion dated January, 2005; 2) the irrelevance of\u00a0the statements and actions of Mr. Mirones and other GDR officials in order to produce the\u00a0alleged expropriation, based on the fact that said statements and actions would only be\u00a0relevant in the event that the indirect investment tax credits were transferable under the law;\u00a03) the non-existence of measures in this sense in the alleged judicial proceedings against\u00a0Copesa; and 4) the denial of any expropriating effects of Law 6. (621)\n44. - Regarding the first item, it is affirmed that the referenced opinion contains an explicit\u00a0statement on the non-transferability, in general, of indirect investment tax credits, which\u00a0would be contrary to the law, as previously stated.\n45. - With regard to the second item, in connection with the measures attributable to the State\u00a0failing to fall within the standards of Art. II of the Treaty on indirect expropriation, or\u00a0measures tantamount to expropriation, the Award, in short, establishes the theory that\u00a0Claimants were not deprived of any of their rights in connection with their Copesa stock - a\u00a0company that is still in operation to date - and without any significant decrease in any of the\u00a0economic rights arising from their investment.\n12\nCase 8:12-cv-01647-EAK-MAP Document 3-6 Filed 07/24/12 Page 40 of 44 PageID 270\n46. - As it has already been stated throughout this dissenting opinion, I disagree with both\u00a0series of matters presented as justifications for the conclusion reached in the award on this\u00a0issue.\n47. - In the first place, and in connection with the opinion dated January 2005, because it\u00a0contains affirmations regarding the non-transferability of indirect investment tax credits that\u00a0are not supported by any law, regardless of the value assigned to the opinion dated August\u00a026, 2004.\n48. - Also because Mr. Mirones\u2019 oral and written statements may not be classified as irrelevant\u00a0for the purposes of this proceeding, let alone based on the criterion that the statements would\u00a0only be relevant if it had been concluded that credits were transferable under the law. On the\u00a0contrary, the statements are extraordinarily relevant since, because of the content of such\u00a0statements and the proven effect on the failed sale of Copesa\u2019s shares of stock, they precisely\u00a0and directly affect the rights of Claimants recognized by law. And this is regardless of the fact\u00a0that it is precisely the possibility to transfer the credits pursuant to the law what gives such\u00a0measures their expropriating character.\n49. - The statements made by Mr. Mirones and other officers addressed to Banks, auditors\u00a0and specialized recipients, among other addressees, express contents and affirmations which\u00a0clearly are not in accordance with the law, such as: a) the need to obtain a resolution or\u00a0previous act recognizing the rights to tax credits, which requirement was not met in the case at\u00a0hand, b) the need for the production a priori of the certifications and verifications required\u00a0under Law 28 a posteriori and as a possible requirement, c) the unavailability of tax credits\u00a0due to the derogation of the law that protected them, and, finally, the repeatedly asserted\u00a0reference to the non-transferable character of tax credits, of essence as to the functionality and\u00a0nature of this type of credits. There is no doubt that, in addition to being contrary to the law,\u00a0the statements made by a high-ranking officer of the GDR, at a decisive time, were not only\u00a0relevant but effective, by themselves, and besides other speculations regarding the failure of\u00a0the planned sale of shares of stock, in connection with the matters at issue in this proceeding.\u00a0All of this would consequently result in a denial of rights, evidencing its clearly expropriating\u00a0character.\n50. - The denial of the credits\u2019 transferability, a core and recurrent issue in this arbitration, as\u00a0we say, constitutes a measure that is directly aimed at the deprivation of rights and, therefore,\u00a0it is tantamount to an expropriating act or measure in itself. Due to the character and nature\u00a0that the transferability issue holds in the configuration of indirect investment tax credits ,\u00a0widely and explicitly acknowledged by the Award, the denial thereof is equivalent to the\u00a0denial of the right itself. Contrary to the opinion included in the Award, it is deemed not as a\u00a0matter of fact but of interpretation and application of law. The transfer is feasible under the\u00a0law, and may not be framed within a fact.\n51. - By systematically denying the key concept of transferability of indirect investment tax\u00a0credits, these are deprived of their usefulness, depriving them of all content, and in the end\u00a0denying the existence of a consolidated vested right, which constitutes an expropriation in\u00a0terms of the applicable rule (Art. IV of the BIT), since there is a particular deprivation of a\n13\nCase 8:12-cv-01647-EAK-MAP Document 3-6 Filed 07/24/12 Page 41 of 44 PageID 271\nclaim to money or to a claim to performance having economic value and associated with an investment.\n52.- Therefore, one might say that by denying such credits in the manner described, preventing the sale of shares of stock, as a way to enforce the consolidated vested right,\u00a0Respondent adopted, all things considered, a measure tantamount to an expropriation. And it\u00a0cannot be alleged that the shareholders may directly use their credits, and that they never\u00a0requested their recognition, since the law does not expressly prescribe the manner in which\u00a0rights may be enforced by their holders, and thus the manner and time of enforcement is up to\u00a0said holders. And it is legitimate to enforce said rights based on the inherent functional\u00a0concept of transferability, as it was intended with the planned sale of shares of stock. And,\u00a0furthermore, the sale of shares of stock is the most adequate way the enforce the rights to tax\u00a0credits of this type, given the characteristics and circumstances of the investment and due to\u00a0the fact that their holders may proceed as they best think fit to their interests and within the\u00a0scope of the law.\n53- \u00a0It is also proven that Law 6 contains in itself sufficient elements to consider that it is\u00a0contrary to the legal system in force, and that its content is expropriating, since: a) it threatens\u00a0the vested rights under Law 28, and consequently violates the CP and CC; b) requires a\u00a0statement of existing credits that was not provided for under the law which created them, and\u00a0failure to submit said statement is sanctioned with the extinguishment of consolidated and\u00a0vested rights; c) introduces a new power for the Tax Administration to examine a priori the\u00a0validity of the credits resulting from Law 28, which exceeds the mere supervisory and\u00a0controlling a posteriori authority specified in the tax credits regime and content created by\u00a0Law 28; d) reduces from 25 to five per cent the maximum percentage deductible from the\u00a0recognized credits in each year in which the recognized tax right is enforced.\n54- All of the above circumstances modify the content and legal regime of vested rights,\u00a0constituting the particular deprivation on which the expropriation criterion is based, and\u00a0therefore, it is deemed an equivalent measure, in terms of the Treaty, in itself and regardless\u00a0of any other measures.\n55- And it would not be affected by the consideration included in the award that Law 6 does\u00a0not threaten vested rights or breach the principle of non-retroactivity of the law, since the law\u00a0in question was designed for the future. From a simple reading of the text of the law it may be\u00a0inferred that it is designed to regulate tax credit situations existing at the time of its enactment,\u00a0requiring that credits be declared or establishing certain usage percentages, etc. Any changes\u00a0to the contents or legal regime of a situation or vested right constitutes an invasion of the\u00a0law and is clear proof of its prohibited retroactivity. And, obviously, not only the annulment\u00a0or revocation of acquired circumstances, as held by the majority vote.\n56- It is also worth mentioning that the un-enforcement of consolidated and vested rights does\u00a0not imply either a waiver thereof, or a change of its contents. And the right still exists, in its\u00a0own terms, even though it is not used or enforced. The law that modifies these conditions is\u00a0not designed for the future, but makes it the express purpose of its regulation the content of a\u00a0previously-acquired right.\n14\nCase 8:12-cv-01647-EAK-MAP Document 3-6 Filed 07/24/12 Page 42 of 44 PageID 272\n57- On the other hand, it is assumed, as stated in the Award, that the State is entitled to\u00a0regulate the conditions in which the tax credits granted to investors may be used. Of course,\u00a0this is always possible, as it is only logical, but always under the unavoidable imperative of\u00a0the safeguard of vested rights.\n58- Regarding the measures taken by the State falling within the standard of indirect\u00a0expropriation or measures tantamount to expropriation under the BIT, I believe that it is\u00a0necessary to refer to the provisions of said Treaty.\n59- Article 1(d) of the BIT sets forth a broad definition of investment, as \u201cevery kind of\u00a0investment, owned or controlled directly or indirectly... and includes (iii) a claim to money...\u00a0or to performance having economic value and associated with an investment; ...\u201d.\nIn turn, Article IV 1 establishes that \u201cinvestment shall not be expropriated... or subjected to any other direct or indirect measure having an effect equivalent to expropriation...\u201d.\n60. - There is nothing in these provisions that may lead to assume that the Treaty limits the\u00a0concept of indirect expropriation to the possession and enjoyment of property rights, as\u00a0contended by the majority opinion in the award.\nThis means, in short, to equate an expropriated asset exclusively to property ownership, when in fact the BIT and the concept of indirect expropriation extend the matter significantly by\u00a0including the rights and economic consequences associated with an investment. As it happens\u00a0in the case at hand, in which the impaired rights, and therefore the object of measures\u00a0tantamount to expropriation, are precisely the tax credits acquired for their investment and\u00a0in compliance with Law 28.\n61. - The broad definition of investment provided for under the Treaty does not allow for a\u00a0conclusion based on the mere identification of the possible indirect expropriation with\u00a0ownership-associated rights. Rather, that formula may apply to the economic rights\u00a0associated with an investment, as is the case with tax credits. Although shareholders were not\u00a0deprived of the use and enjoyment of their property, the expropriation results from the mere\u00a0verification of the denial, or the frustration, in the manner described, of the right to tax credits.\n62. - On the other hand, the right Claimants were deprived of due to their investment\u00a0constitutes a very significant loss in the value of the investment. And this is regardless of\u00a0the value of Copesa in itself, which, no doubt, would be affected by other factors. In this\u00a0case, the object of the expropriation is the right to tax credits, aside from or completely\u00a0irrespective of the shareholder status held by the owners of the shares of stock in the\u00a0company.\n63. - The veiled suggestion made in the Award that the loss of rights by Claimants is, in any\u00a0case, a minor loss, not susceptible of being qualified as an expropriation for the purposes of\u00a0the Treaty due to its limited scope, is in reality unfounded, since it undoubtedly constitutes a\u00a0significant amount (one hundred per cent of the investment), nor is it supported by the BIT.\u00a0The fact that it is not accompanied by the detriment of shareholders\u2019 social rights is irrelevant\n15\nCase 8:12-cv-01647-EAK-MAP Document 3-6 Filed 07/24/12 Page 43 of 44 PageID 273\nto, or at least not absolutely necessary for, the configuration of an expropriation, in terms of the Treaty.\n64. - Neither is it necessary to remember that Claimants\u2019 investment was made in shares of\u00a0stock and not in tax credits. Therefore, it is clear that the investment was made in shares of\u00a0stock, giving rise, due to the strict application of the law, to a series of economic and legal\u00a0consequences, namely the tax credits. But obviously the investment is not \u201cin\u201d tax credits.\u00a0Copesa\u2019s capital contribution constituting the investment are contributions materialized\u00a0through shares of stock. And this is evidenced by the Award. Except for a noticeable\u00a0language distortion, an investment may not be made, as contribution for the purpose of the\u00a0law, \u201cin\u201d tax credits.\n65. - To sum up, it would be worth noting that:\n1- Indirect expropriation -consisting of a series of measures which are equivalent to expropriation- occurs whenever there is any particular abridgement of rights, as a result of\u00a0any actual or incidental interference, as to their content or legal system, which inures to the\u00a0detriment of investors in such a degree so as to significantly assess the impairment to their\u00a0rights (even more so when they have been deprived, as it has been stated, of all of their rights\u00a0to indirect tax credits).\n2. - The abridgement of rights is sufficient for this type of expropriation to exist, without any\u00a0reduction in the features inherent in the property or in the legal condition of the expropriated\u00a0being necessary. The fact that Copesa\u2019s shareholders may keep their position within the\u00a0company is not relevant for this purpose.\n3. - The fact that the company itself may gain a lot of value or a little value is also irrelevant.\u00a0That the expropriated asset lacked value, as the Respondent has been alleging throughout this\u00a0arbitration proceeding, is inadmissible, or that it may now be highly valuable, on the grounds\u00a0that it is not the investment itself that constitutes the subject matter of the expropriation, but\u00a0the rights arising out of the investment, which have been vested and recognized in the law -economic value associated to the investment, as written in the BIT - and the grounds for\u00a0expropriation play their part irrespective of the investment in a given moment.\n4. The Respondent\u2019s actions, as previously mentioned in point 46 hereof are yet more mere\u00a0representations lacking in any and all legal grounds. They are harmful to the rights of the\u00a0Claimants, having resulted in a full deprivation of the right, preventing the sale of shares, and\u00a0therefore, in an outright denial and loss of the economic value related to the investment\u00a0pursuant to the terms acknowledged in the Treaty (I (d) iii).\n5. - That the statements above do not prevent, as sustained and justified in the majority\u00a0Award, that the rights of the claimant shareholders in the management of Copesa may be\u00a0impaired, or the economic value of the investment in the company, because it has been duly\u00a0stated that the actual and particular deprivation which expropriation proper represents,\u00a0amounts to an impairment as to the value associated to it. The actions described are carried\u00a0out irrespective of the value of the company itself.\n16\nCase 8:12-cv-01647-EAK-MAP Document 3-6 Filed 07/24/12 Page 44 of 44 PageID 274\n6. - Neither shall this transmissibility requirement be considered a value accessory to the\u00a0shares, and hence, that the existence of the indirect investment tax credit is lowered to this\u00a0category. The power to transfer this tax credit is not incidental; it is of the essence, as far as\u00a0we are concerned, in setting up the right. Its denial materially deprives the right of its content\u00a0and inherent function, according to the law. Nevertheless, the above takes place separately\u00a0from any consideration as regards the features or characteristics of the shares, because what is\u00a0considered is the right to tax credit.\nVII. - The measures implemented by the Republic have enough grounds as to be framed within the standard of violation of the principle of fair and equitable treatment set forth\u00a0in Article XI. 1 of the Treaty\n66. - The conduct expressed through the measures attributable to the government of Panama,\u00a0both in respect of the officials of the General Directorate of Revenue (GDR), and of such\u00a0relevant legislative instrument as Law 6 of 2005 also constitutes a clear and unmistakable\u00a0example of the actions of the government in violation of the obligation to keep the principle\u00a0of fair and equitable treatment with respect to the investments. And as drawn from the\u00a0arbitrators\u2019 case law interpretation of this uncertain legal concept\n67. - The principle underlying the obligation of fair and equitable treatment is nothing but the\u00a0transfer to this area of the coordinates which govern the actions carried out by the Public\u00a0Administration, in its relational aspect, under the basic principle of lawful trust and made\u00a0itself subject to the principles of rule of law and of prohibition of arbitrariness of powers, as\u00a0well as to the duty of transparency and normality in the course of its relations with the\u00a0citizens. This is how the principle is currently outlined, through a determined action of case\u00a0law in the legal systems which follow the continental-style administrative system, which is\u00a0undoubtedly the case of the Panamanian system. Such a principle is reinforced and gets\u00a0specific connotations at the international level of Conventional law and of Customary law\u00a0when it raises the safeguard which constitutes the lawful trust in the actions carried out by the\u00a0states which receive investments to the autonomous and well-defined category of\u00a0International law.\n68. - The principle of fair and equitable treatment entails protecting the expectations generated\u00a0around a pre-existing, clear, and expressive legal framework which unmistakably protects the\u00a0rights of investors, and which is knowable, transparent, and predictable, allowing investors to\u00a0use it as a basis for their investment decisions. The principle further requires that the\u00a0framework created is stable and does not violate the initial expectations of trust in the\u00a0interpretation and application of the law, without any distortions, thus keeping at all times the\u00a0general expectation of investors that: after the investment is made, the receiving State affords\u00a0investors a fair and equitable treatment.\n69. - In this case, there are certain circumstances which support the fact that the principle of\u00a0fair and equitable treatment has not been honored, on the following grounds: a) there is no\u00a0doubt that the investors were perfectly aware of the existence of the law and of the tax\u00a0incentives contained in the law at the moment of making their acquisitions in Copesa. The\n17\nCase 8:12-cv-01647-EAK-MAP Document 3-7 Filed 07/24/12 Page 1 of 2 PageID 275\nadvertising system established in Panama is sufficiently effective so as to generate no doubts about the investors\u2019 knowledge of the laws and tax incentives at the time of investing in the\u00a0Copesa Plant. Alleging anything to the contrary, even more so when we are dealing with\u00a0international investors that are experts in investments in power companies in many countries,\u00a0and who are sufficiently advised and assisted at the time of making any investment, would go\u00a0against any logical reasoning. As it may also be inferred, KPMG was aware of the existence\u00a0of the offer of services on September 22, 1998, which was precisely about providing\u00a0consulting services on this matter; b) even though this was not the only grounds for the\u00a0investment, because there is no doubt whatsoever of the fact that the investment is projected\u00a0on shares, from which a series of rights are derived, as determined by the law - tax credits,\u00a0among others - the truth is that such an expectation, as increased by the high amount of the\u00a0credit stated (hundred per cent of the investment) was not exclusive, but it was actually highly\u00a0preponderant in determining the investment in Copesa; c) the right to, or the reasonable\u00a0expectation that, a legal system shall not be altered, modified, misinterpreted or wrongly\u00a0applied, thus changing the rules and the application criteria, and therefore frustrating the\u00a0lawful expectations of the investors constitutes the core aspect of the fair and equitable\u00a0treatment standard, which has been violated by the laws (Law 6, to the extent that it amended\u00a0the content and the legal system applicable to vested rights, adding new control mechanisms\u00a0by the Administration and reducing the possibility of using the total tax credit from 25 to 5\u00a0per cent on a yearly basis) and by representations made by the Tax Administration (either by\u00a0denying the essential nature of the transmissibility of indirect investment tax credits thus\u00a0ultimately impairing the right, or by holding that the credits were not available, or that the\u00a0credits did not exist on the grounds that the laws protecting them had expired, as it has been\u00a0highlighted), or a prior administrative resolution was necessary; etc.\n70. - As far as I am concerned, the above constitutes a serious disturbance of a desirable\u00a0scenario for the development of new investments, in the context of a stable framework and an\u00a0Administration which must lawfully gain the confidence of the administrated investors. Such\u00a0trust is precisely not gained in the context of a legal framework where uncertainty prevails, as\u00a0it has been stated in the Award, on many occasions, and as it is inferred from the laws on\u00a0investments of the Republic of Panama.\n71. - All these actions, which may be attributable to the Administration and to the government\u00a0of Panama, constitute the grounds which support the existence of a non-fair and unjust\u00a0treatment, which would also hold Panama internationally liable, under this paragraph, thus\u00a0frustrating the lawful expectations of the investors \u2014both at the beginning of the investment\u00a0and after the investment- and depriving investors of the right to receive the full benefit\u00a0reasonably expected for the investment made. All this in the understanding that such actions\u00a0were taken prior to the investment and that they have also been made after the investment, and\u00a0that they are sufficiently solid and effective so as to sustain and support a violation of the fair\u00a0and equitable treatment standard, as provided for by the principles of international investment\u00a0law currently in force.\n18\nCase 8:12-cv-01647-EAK-MAP Document 3-7 Filed 07/24/12 Page 2 of 2 PageID 276\nVin. - About the sentence to bear procedural costs and the statement of liability of the Claimant.\n72. - Lastly, with regard to the Award decision regarding procedural costs, and the decision\u00a0on liability and attribution to bear part of the expenses of the defense, I must state -notwithstanding my foregoing statements - that there being no recklessness on the part of the\u00a0Claimant, the prevailing party principle is not applied, on the grounds that some of the claims\u00a0alleged by the Respondent have been rejected (the claims raised as to a prior and separate\u00a0knowledge of the objection to the jurisdiction of the Tribunal; or the \u201cbifurcation\u201d, which\u00a0have already been decided by the Arbitral Tribunal; or the claims related to Arbitral Tribunal\u00a0jurisdiction, which have already been decided in the Award.) Consequently, there are no\u00a0grounds to justify that the Claimant should bear the cost inherent to filing and defending these\u00a0claims. A greater analysis of the demarcation and definition of attributable costs and liability\u00a0is required in this matter. And the discretionary power of the Arbitral Tribunal over these\u00a0matters should not quash the importance of properly justifying and basing any decisions made\u00a0in this regard.\nThe statements above represent my opinion, which I sign on November 3, 2010 in Rozas, Madrid."}], "Content": "Case 8:12-cv-01647-EAK-MAP Document 3-4 Filed 07/24/12 Page 3 of 44 PageID 145\nCASE No. ARB/06/19\nINTERNATIONAL CENTRE FOR SETTLEMENT OF INVESTMENT DISPUTES BETWEEN:\nNATIONS ENERGY CORPORATION.

PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n19. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On October 7, 2005, Claimants filed a Request for Arbitration under the Arbitration\u00a0Rules of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law\u00a0(\u201cUNCITRAL\u201d), to be heard by the International Center for Dispute Resolution\u00a0(\u201cICDR\u201d). However, Respondent challenged the jurisdiction of the arbitral tribunal\u00a0under this procedure and also argued that the parties had failed to meet the\u00a0requirement of previous negotiation. Consequently, the Respondent did not appoint\u00a0an arbitrator or file a counter-memorial.\n20. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Claimants withdrew their initial Request for Arbitration under the UNCITRAL rules,\u00a0and on August 3, 2006 filed a Request for Submission to Arbitration (\u201cRequest for\u00a0Arbitration\u201d) before the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes\u00a0(\u201cICSID\u201d) pursuant to Article 36 of the Convention, the procedural rules of\u00a0ICSID and Article I of the Protocol, and requested the registration of such request\u00a0by the ICSID Secretary-General.\n21. \u00a0\u00a0On August 7, 2006, the ICSID Secretariat acknowledged receipt of the Request\u00a0for Arbitration and sent the documents to Respondent.\n22. \u00a0\u00a0On November 10, 2006, the law firm of Arnold & Porter confirmed to the ICSID\u00a0their appointment to represent the Republic of Panama in this arbitration.\n23. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On December 11, 2006, under Article 36(3) of the Convention and provisions\u00a06(l)(a) and 7(a) of the Procedural Rules for the Institution of Conciliation and\u00a0Arbitration Proceedings (\u201cInstitution Rules\u201d) the ICSID Secretariat informed the\u00a0parties that on such date the Request for Arbitration was registered under Case\u00a0Number ARB/06/19, and issued a notice of registration of the Request for\u00a0Arbitration. In addition, the ICSID Secretariat requested the parties to give notice\u00a0of the number of arbitrators and method for their designation agreed upon.\n11\nCase 8:12-cv-01647-EAK-MAP Document 3-4 Filed 07/24/12 Page 15 of 44 PageID 157\n24. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Through a letter dated January 19, 2007, the parties notified ICSID of the agreed\u00a0upon method to appoint arbitrators and the timetable for the constitution of the\u00a0arbitral tribunal.

On\u00a0November 19, 2007 the Secretariat gave notice to the parties of the foregoing and\u00a0attached Mr. Mourre\u2019s resume to such notice.\n32. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On November 28, 2007 and with the agreement of the parties, the arbitral tribunal\u00a0(the \u201cArbitral Tribunal\u201d) was constituted in compliance with the provisions of the\u00a0Convention and the ICSID Arbitration Rules.

The Arbitral Tribunal announced that, should the parties fail to come to\u00a0an agreement, it would take certain steps to ensure the proper development of the\u00a0hearings.\n59. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On November 17, 2009 the Arbitral Tribunal provided the parties with a draft of\u00a0Procedural Order n\u00b0 6 to organize the hearings of witnesses and experts, and\u00a0requested that the parties make their observations in connection therewith.\n60. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On December 22, 2009, after analyzing the observations made by the parties, the\u00a0Arbitral Tribunal issued Procedural Order n\u00b0 6, establishing the applicable procedural\u00a0rules and an interim schedule for evidentiary hearings.

The Tribunal\u00a0noted that Mr. Bingen Amezaga was not a national of any of the parties\u2019 countries\u00a0and was fully independent and impartial with regard to the parties. Such request was\u00a0accompanied by Mr. Amezaga\u2019s resume.\n65. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Finally, the Arbitral Tribunal requested the parties to confirm their availability to\u00a0hold a conference call prior to the evidentiary hearings, which was scheduled for\u00a0March 24, 2010 at 4 PM, Eastern time.\n66. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On February 1, 2010 Claimants provided the Arbitral Tribunal with letters dated\u00a0January 13, 2010 from Messrs. Roberto Testa, Teodomiro Pino Mendieta, and\u00a0Guillermo Dominguez Trujillo, witnesses summoned by the Arbitral Tribunal to\u00a0appear at the hearings. In the letters the witnesses confirmed their attendance at the\u00a0hearings. In the same communication, Claimants informed the Arbitral Tribunal that,\u00a0in spite of their efforts, they had not been able to reach Mrs. Hazel Jaramillo.\n67. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On February 2, 2010 Claimants informed the Arbitral Tribunal that they accepted the\u00a0participation of Mr. Bingen Amezaga as assistant to the Arbitral Tribunal during the\u00a0evidentiary hearings.\n68. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On February 3, 2010 Respondent informed the Arbitral Tribunal that it had\u00a0summoned all of its witnesses and experts to the evidentiary hearings, and that they\u00a0confirmed their availability to appear. On the other hand, Respondent informed the\u00a0Arbitral Tribunal that it had no objections regarding Mr. Bingen Amezaga\u2019s\u00a0participation as assistant to the Arbitral Tribunal during the hearings. Lastly,\u00a0Respondent confirmed its availability to participate in a conference call scheduled for\u00a0March 24, 2010.\n69. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On February 26, 2010 Claimants notified the Arbitral Tribunal of several documents\u00a0they had produced in order to supplement the existing records, and specified that they\u00a0may intend to use them at the final hearing.\n17\nCase 8:12-cv-01647-EAK-MAP Document 3-4 Filed 07/24/12 Page 21 of 44 PageID 163\n70. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Also on February 26, Respondent requested that the Arbitral Tribunal grant a period\u00a0until at least March 10, 2010 to respond to the submission of documents by\u00a0Claimants.\n71. \u00a0\u00a0On March 1, 2010 the Arbitral Tribunal acknowledged receipt of the communications\u00a0given by both parties on February 26, 2010, and notified Respondent that it would\u00a0have until March 10, 2010 to answer Claimants\u2019s petition.\n72. \u00a0\u00a0On March 1, 2010 Claimants informed the Arbitral Tribunal that Messrs. Abraham\u00a0Ricardo Rosas Arauz, Christian de la Medina Soto and Charbel A. Moarbes would act\u00a0as advisers to Claimants EME and Jaime Jurado. In addition, Claimants requested\u00a0that they be included in the records and case communications.\n73. \u00a0\u00a0On March 10, 2010 Respondent submitted a communication to the Arbitral Tribunal\u00a0in reply to the petition to supplement records filed by Claimants on February 26. In\u00a0the reply, Respondent opposed the admission of such documents on the grounds that\u00a0it believed Claimants\u2019 petition to be untimely since said documents should have been\u00a0produced accompanying Claimants\u2019 briefs, pursuant to Point 14 (3, 7, 9, and 10),\u00a0Minutes of the First Session of the Arbitral Tribunal; Procedural Order N\u00b0 6, Point 3;\u00a0and Rule 24, ICSID Arbitration Rules. Moreover, Respondent asserted that said\u00a0documents were also irrelevant because they were produced out of context and\u00a0without explanation as to their identification or relevance.\n74. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On March 11, 2010 Claimants submitted a letter to the Arbitral Tribunal indicating\u00a0that, pursuant to the IBA Rules on the taking of evidence in international arbitration,\u00a0the Tribunal has discretionary powers to declare the documents admissible. In\u00a0addition, Claimants asserted that they produced said documents at the moment they\n' were aware and certain of their existence, in accordance with the procedural timetable established by the Tribunal, and in compliance with ICSID Rules and Practices.\u00a0Claimants stated that they never intended to provide additional legal arguments at this\u00a0stage of the proceeding, but that the intention was to submit relevant evidence\u00a0directly related to the matter at issue. Claimants also stated that the documents were\u00a0not new, that they had already requested them from Respondent through the request\u00a0for document production made in February 2009 under Point No. 1, and that\u00a0Respondent refused to produce them under false allegations. In view of the\u00a0foregoing, Claimants requested the Arbitral Tribunal to declare said documents\u00a0admissible so that they may be examined and assessed at the hearings.\n75. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On March 11, 2010 Respondent requested the Tribunal\u2019s permission to reply to the\u00a0letter submitted by Claimants on that same day, indicating that the letter had not been\u00a0authorized nor requested by the Arbitral Tribunal.\n76. \u00a0\u00a0On March 13, 2010 the ICSID Secretariat communicated to the Arbitral Tribunal two\u00a0letters from Respondent dated March 12, 2010.\n77. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In one of the letters, Respondent informed the Tribunal that it did not intend to crossexamine Guillermo Coch\u00e9z, Analisa Moreno de Arosemena and Francisco Barrios\n18\nCase 8:12-cv-01647-EAK-MAP Document 3-4 Filed 07/24/12 Page 22 of 44 PageID 164\n78.\n  \n79.\n  \n80.\n  \nGonzalez. Respondent highlighted that such decision, pursuant to Paragraph 43 of Procedural Order No. 6, did not imply the acceptance of the statements made by said\u00a0individuals. In addition, Respondent requested that the Arbitral Tribunal order\u00a0Claimants to confirm, prior to the conference call scheduled for March 24, 2010,\u00a0whether they intended to examine all witnesses for the Respondent and witnesses\u00a0summoned by the Arbitral Tribunal. Respondent asked the Arbitral Tribunal to set\u00a0March 26, 2010 as the deadline for Claimants to confirm the appearance of\u00a0Mrs. Jaramillo, so that the parties may adequately prepare and plan in advance their\u00a0time management at the hearings.\nIn the other letter dated March 13, Respondent indicated that Mr. Rosas Ar\u00e1uz had previously represented Del Mar Trust Funds Ltd. in the purchase of bank loans\u00a0against COPESA and requested (a) that the relationship between Mr. Rosas Ara\u00faz,\u00a0Claimants and Del Mar be noted, (b) that such circumstance be deemed additional\u00a0evidence of the relationship between Claimants and Del Mar, and (c) that negative\u00a0inferences be drawn from Claimants\u2019 reluctance to produce documents in connection\u00a0with Del Mar as ordered by the Arbitral Tribunal.\nOn March 15, 2010 the Arbitral Tribunal acknowledged receipt of the communications sent by the parties dated March 11 and 12, 2010, and:\n(a) \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0granted the Respondent the Thursday March 18, 2010 deadline to reply\u00a0to the e-mail sent by Claimants dated March 11, 2010;\n(b) \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0noted that Respondent did not intend to cross-examine the following\u00a0witnesses: Guillermo Coch\u00e9z, Analisa Moreno de Arosemena, and\u00a0Francisco Barrios Gonz\u00e1lez, hence it declared that Respondent\u00a0appearance at the hearings would not be necessary;\n(c) \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0requested that Claimants confirm, prior to March 18, 2010, whether\u00a0they intended to cross-examine all witnesses for the Respondent,\u00a0indicating that cost matters would be addressed by the Arbitral Tribunal\u00a0in due course and in light of all circumstances;\n(d) \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0requested that Claimants inform the Arbitral Tribunal, prior to the\u00a0conference call scheduled for March 24, 2010 whether they had\u00a0succeeded in reaching Mrs. Hazel Jaramillo, indicating that the issue\u00a0whether Mrs. Hazel Jaramillo would appear at the hearings would be\u00a0dealt with during the conference call;\n(e) \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0noted the issue raised by Respondent regarding Mr. Abraham Rosas,\u00a0without deeming it necessary to make any decision in that respect;\n(f) \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0sent the parties the draft agenda for the conference call of March 24,\n2010, asking them for their observations. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2019\nOn March 18, 2010 Claimants informed the Arbitral Tribunal that they did not intend to cross-examine the following witnesses and experts for the Respondent:\n19\nCase 8:12-cv-01647-EAK-MAP Document 3-4 Filed 07/24/12 Page 23 of 44 PageID 165\nJorge A. Molina Mendoza, Franklin Antonio Miranda Icaza, Christoph Schreuer, Ursula Kriebaum and Jaime Gilberto Franco P\u00e9rez. Claimants also confirmed they\u00a0understood that they had a March 24 deadline to identify any other individuals they\u00a0intended to exclude from cross-examination. Finally, Claimants stated that they had\u00a0no knowledge of Mrs. Hazel Jaramillo\u2019s whereabouts, and that they had already\u00a0provided Respondent with the contact information they had on the individual.\n81. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On March 24, 2010 the parties and the Arbitral Tribunal held a conference call to\u00a0resolve several issues regarding the organization of evidentiary hearings. The ICSID\u00a0Secretariat recorded the conference call.\n82. \u00a0\u00a0The hearings were held from April 14, 2010 to April 21, 2010 in Washington D.C.,\u00a0and were attended by both parties, who presented their witnesses and experts.\n83. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Claimants presented witnesses Victor Berrio Anderson, Jaime Jurado, Guillermo A.\u00a0Coch\u00e9z,2 Charles David Lamoreaux, Julio Ledezma, and Bartley Paul Smith, and\u00a0expert Julio Elias Berrios Herrera (via Video Conference).\n84. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Respondent presented the following witnesses: Carlos Alberto Jim\u00e9nez Campos,\u00a0Rolando Mirones, Carlo G.

The parties replied that they had no objections\u00a0whatsoever and that, on the contrary, they were satisfied with it.\n2 Although Guillermo Coch\u00e9z was presented as witness for Claimants, Mr. Coch\u00e9z was not summoned by\u00a0Respondent for cross-examination (see \u00a7 77 above). Therefore, his appearance at the hearings had to be ordered\u00a0by the Arbitral Tribunal at the Claimants\u2019 request.\n20\nCase 8:12-cv-01647-EAK-MAP Document 3-4 Filed 07/24/12 Page 24 of 44 PageID 166\n90. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On May 12, 2010 Respondent submitted a letter and two schedules to the Arbitral\u00a0Tribunal in reply to the request for document production made by the Tribunal at the\u00a0end of the hearings.\n91. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On June 7, 2010 the parties jointly submitted a communication to the Arbitral\u00a0Tribunal containing the agreed-upon corrections made to the hearing transcripts.\n92. \u00a0\u00a0On June 28, 2010 both parties submitted their Post-Hearing Memorials (\u201cPHM\u201d).\n93. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Both parties submitted their statements of costs to ICSID through letters dated July\u00a012, 2010.\n94. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Through letter dated July 13, 2010 Claimants raised an objection to the content of\u00a0Respondent\u2019s statement of costs.\n95. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The parties discussed the objection raised by Claimants.

SUMMARY OF FACTS\nA. Panamanian Legislation on Tax Incentives and Legal Stability\n100. \u00a0In 1995, Law 28 of June 20 (\u201cLaw 28\u201d) was passed in Panama, and, as the name\u00a0suggests, it established \u201cmeasures to universalize tax incentives for production, and\n21\nCase 8:12-cv-01647-EAK-MAP Document 3-4 Filed 07/24/12 Page 25 of 44 PageID 167\nother provisions\u201d. Law 28, as stated in its preamble,3 was intended to modify the existing tax incentive system in Panama, by replacing the old exemption method for a\u00a0universal system of tax credits.\n101. \u00a0Among other provisions, Section 6 of Law 28 added a Paragraph (d) and 5 Subparagraphs to the Panamanian Tax Code. Said paragraph, and its explanatory Subparagraphs, referred to the allocation of tax credits for investments made in certain\u00a0economic sectors. These provisions established the possibility for investors to apply\u00a0a 25% credit against income tax paid in each period up to 100% of the investment;\u00a0provided that certain conditions and restrictions set forth by Law 28, as well as its\u00a0Regulations developed in Executive Decree 274 of December 29, 1995 (\u201cExecutive\u00a0Decree 274\u201d),4 were complied with.\n102. \u00a0A few years later, on June 22, 1998, Law No. 54 was passed \u201cproviding for measures\u00a0to give legal stability to investments\u201d (\u201cLaw 54\u201d). Subject to certain conditions and\u00a0restrictions, the Law guaranteed national and foreign investors would enjoy the\u00a0stability of the tax and legal systems in force at the time they registered with the\u00a0relevant registry for a term of 10 years,5\n103. \u00a0Law 54 was implemented by Executive Decree 9, dated February 22, 1999\u00a0(\u201cExecutive Decree 9\u201d.) Under Executive Decree 9, to be entitled to the benefits of\u00a0Law 54 the investor had to be duly registered with the Registry of Investments and\u00a0maintain said registration in force.6\n104. \u00a0On June 23, 1999 Law 20 was passed (\u201cLaw 20\u201d), whose Article 1 fully abrogated\u00a0Section 6 of Law 28, which provided the tax credit incentives.7\n105. \u00a0On February 2, 2005, Law 6 was passed in Panama \u201cimplementing a tax equity\u00a0program\u201d (\u201cLaw 6\u201d). Section 79 of the Law, among other regulations, recognized the\u00a0validity of existing tax credits accrued under Law 28, but reduced the limit of the tax\u00a0credit that may be applied annually against the Income Tax Return to 5%. In\u00a0addition, in its Transitory Paragraph the Law established a requirement for the\u00a0declaration of the credits within a term of 180 days following the effective date of\u00a0said law. Noncompliance with this requirement would extinguish the right to such\u00a0credits.8\nB.

Said\u00a0contract was endorsed by the IHRE, after privatization, to Elektra Noreste S.A., a\u00a0power distribution company. 12\n111. \u00a0On April 20, 1998, COPESA signed an EPC Contract with Stewart & Stevenson\u00a0Energy Products (\u201cS&S\u201d), a General Electric Power Systems subsidiary (\u201cGE Power\u00a0Systems\u201d), for the construction, transport, set-up, completion, and commercial\u00a0operation of a power generation plant, for the purpose of fillfilling the contract with\u00a0IHRE. Construction of the Copesa Plant commenced in May 1998.\n112. \u00a0In order to finance the cost of the EPC Contract, COPESA had requested a loan from\u00a0Banco Disa.

The Credit\u00a0Agreement also provided that COPESA should obtain authorization to carry out a\u00a0bond offering for the same loan amount and under certain conditions, in order to\u00a0repay the Banco Disa loan.15\n116. \u00a0As collateral, COPESA (a) pledged to Banco Disa all of COPESA\u2019s common stock\u00a0and all equipment comprising the Copesa Plant; (b) assigned to Banco Disa all\u00a0benefits and economic rights derived from the Power Purchase agreement (COPESA-IRHE 04/16/1998), the Purchase and Plant Maintenance agreement (COPESA-GE\u00a007/15/1998), the Fuel Supply agreement (COPESA-Glencore 07/22/1998), and the\u00a0Equipment Pledge agreement (COPESA-GE dated 04/20/1998); and (c) endorsed to\u00a0Banco Disa the insurance policies on the Copesa Plant.16\n117. \u00a0\u00a0On June 17, 1998, S&S issued invoice n\u00b0 26044017to COPESA for the \u201cMachinery\u00a0on dolly for outdoor use LM6000PC ST including generator and accessories,\u201d for a\u00a0total sum of US$21,045,000.\n118. \u00a0\u00a0Said invoice specifies that out of the above total amount, US$16,954,000 were\u00a0covered by the Letter of Guarantee and the remaining US$4,091,000 were charged for\u00a0\u201cservices excluded from the Letter of Credit.'^\\*\n119. \u00a0The initial sum of US$17 million provided in the Facility Agreement was later\u00a0reduced to US$16,954,000 under the Addendum to the Facility Agreement dated July\u00a024, 1998.19 Said Addendum also allowed Banco Disa to increase or decrease the\n14 C-9 (b).\n15 C-9 (b), Clause Six\n16 C-9 (b) Clause Three and Four\n17 R-26.\n18 R-26.\n19 R-29, Clause Two\n24\nCase 8:12-cv-01647-EAK-MAP Document 3-4 Filed 07/24/12 Page 28 of 44 PageID 170\ninterest rate payable for the credit facility on a quarterly basis, to the extent permitted by Panamanian law.\n120. \u00a0On September 22, 1998, COPESA received a proposal for professional services from\u00a0KPMG, an auditing and tax consulting firm, to carry out the \u201ccertification of the\u00a0investment for the acquisition of a power generation plant in order to obtain the\u00a0investment tax credit benefit^ As stated on the record, COPESA did not follow-up\u00a0on such proposal.\n121. \u00a0On September 24, 1998 at 8.30 AM, the Copesa Plant commenced its business\u00a0operations in Panama.21\n122. \u00a0In October 1998, Banco Disa assigned part of its credit against COPESA as well as\u00a0any related collateral to two Panamanian Banks, Wall Street Securities (\u201cWall\u00a0Street\u201d) and Credicorp Bank (\u201cCredicorp\u201d), as follows: US$6 million to Wall Street\u00a0and US$2 million to Credicorp (Banco Disa, Wall Street and Credicorp banks\u00a0hereinafter collectively referred to as the \u201cLending Banks,\u201d including their successors\u00a0in connection with the credit against COPESA).22\n123. \u00a0Banco Disa continued acting as administrative agent for said banks with respect to\u00a0their credit against COPESA, and retained the rest of its credit under the Facility\u00a0Agreement, i.e., US$8,954,000.23\n124. \u00a0On September 14, 1999, pursuant to Law 54, the Ministry of Commerce and Industry\u00a0of Panama registered COPESA with the Registry for the Legal Stability of\u00a0Investments under number 003 9.24\nC.

On the\u00a0same day it ratified the appointment of Enrique S\u00e1nchez Mahoney (\u201cMahoney\u201d) as\u00a0COPESA\u2019s Receiver and Depository.26 Mahoney took office on November 7, 200227\u00a0and was responsible for managing COPESA until November 8, 2006.\n129. \u00a0On November 26, 2002, EME and COPESA signed a settlement agreement, whereby\u00a0COPESA agreed to pay EME the guaranteed minimum dividends for the COPESA\u00a0preferred shares, plus the amount of US$2,750,000, no specified reason, and the\u00a0amount of US$1,000,000 as damages for the losses incurred by EME.28 In the last\u00a0clause of the agreement, COPESA and EME stated that the Receiver, Enrique\u00a0S\u00e1nchez Mahoney, was exempt from the obligation to file a final report on his\u00a0administration.\n130. \u00a0\u00a0On the other hand, on January 7, 200329, (in an amended version of the original\u00a0complaint filed on November, 18 2002),30 EME filed a Complaint for Declaratory\u00a0Relief for a larger amount, requesting the Panamanian court to rule: (i) that EME\u00a0was a shareholder of COPESA, and as such, it was entitled to the corresponding\u00a0dividends; (ii) that COPESA refused, for no reason, to distribute dividends to its\u00a0shareholders, including EME; and (iii) that EME was entitled to receive the amount\u00a0of B/. 1,000,000 as dividends from COPESA, plus any legal interest.\n131. \u00a0\u00a0On January 15, 2002, prior to these events and for reasons unrelated to this case, the\u00a0Superintendent of Banks of Panama ordered the liquidation of Banco Disa.\u00a0Consequently, the liquidators of Banco Disa attempted to foreclose on the collateral\u00a0pledged by COPESA by filing several lawsuits before the Panamanian courts31.\n132. \u00a0\u00a0On December 31, 2003, COPESA and Claimants executed a settlement agreement\u00a0with the Lending Banks (the \u201cSettlement Agreement\u201d),32 whereby it was agreed that\u00a0COPESA could meet every one of the obligations and claims in respect of the Credit\u00a0Agreement by paying a lump sum in the total amount of US$8,061,180.96.

The Proposed COPESA Bond Issue and the GDR Communication Dated\u00a0August 26,2004\n133. \u00a0\u00a0COPESA and Claimants considered several alternatives to raise the funds required to\u00a0repay the debt with the Lending Banks. Said alternatives included the sale or merger\u00a0of COPESA, the issuance of bonds, and the sale of COPESA stock. Therefore,\u00a0COPESA and its shareholders decided to claim certain tax credits provided for by\u00a0Law 28 to help obtain the necessary funds.\n134. \u00a0First, COPESA considered a potential merger with another company. On February\u00a019, 2003, COPESA requested an opinion from the General Directorate of Revenue of\u00a0Panama (\u201cGDR\u201d) on the possibility that COPESA\u2019s tax credit could be made\u00a0available to the company that resulted from a potential merger.33\n135. \u00a0Based on the hypothesis, the GDR issued an affirmative answer through Note N 20101-233 dated March 11, 2003.34-.\n136. \u00a0COPESA began negotiations on the proposed merger with a Panamanian\u00a0hydroelectric power company named Fortuna.35 The merger was intended to transfer\u00a0COPESA\u2019s debt to said company, which would have assumed the debt and paid the\u00a0Lending Banks by way of the tax credits it would recoup from COPESA every year.\u00a0However, for reasons unrelated to this dispute, Fortuna decided not to pursue\u00a0COPESA\u2019s acquisition.\n137. \u00a0\u00a0COPESA and its shareholders then decided to obtain the necessary resources to repay\u00a0the Lending Banks through a company bond issuance.36\n138. \u00a0For such purposes, on August 17, 2004, COPESA sent a new inquiry to the GDR,\u00a0asking whether COPESA could issue bonds that would include the tax credit benefit.\u00a0The inquiry sent to the GDR read as follows:\n\u201c ...in the case of Indirect Investment, we hereby request your opinion on whether the provisions of Law 28 dated June 20, 1995, and its regulations, are applicable. Our\u00a0inquiry refers to the possibility of issuing bonds that carry the tax credit benefit. As\u00a0you may know, COPESA was granted a 20.90 million Balboas investment tax credit.\u00a0We believe that 17.0 million Balboas relate to indirect investment and 3.9 million\u00a0Balboas relate to direct investment under the applicable legislation.\n33R-211.\n34 C-18.\n35 R-104, R-106.\n36 Memorial, \u00a7 44.\n27\nCase 8:12-cv-01647-EAK-MAP Document 3-4 Filed 07/24/12 Page 31 of 44 PageID 173\nCurrently, COPESA is suing Banco DISA (under liquidation) for breach of contract for violation of the commitment to perform a subscription of bonds in the sum of 17.0\u00a0million balboas. We intend that this obligation be performed through a court\u00a0settlement.\nLikewise, we are interested in your opinion about the classification of any potential investors acquiring the bonds, according to the applicable laws. \u201d37\n139. On August 26, 2004, the GDR replied to COPESA\u2019s inquiry through Note No. 20101-653, as follows:\n\u2018\u2018With regard to your inquiry, and given that COPESA has a recognized tax credit for direct investment in power generation activities, according to Article 702, Paragraph\u00a0d, Sub-paragraph 2, Tax Code and Article 123 b, Paragraph 2, Executive Decree 170\u00a0of 1993, this Office believes that other taxpayers may use such tax credit, provided\u00a0that said taxpayers have issued bonds, stock or other securities for the purpose of\u00a0making indirect investments in this case.\n...We note that COPESA entered into an agreement for the issuance of bonds with Banco Disa on June 12, 1998 (based on a prior letter of intent for the issuance of\u00a0Bonds N\u00b0 BD-052-98 dated May 25, 1998.), and the entity breached the contract by\u00a0failing to issue said bonds. However, we believe that, despite the failure to issue the\u00a0bonds, COPESA financed, on an interim basis, part of its investment with resources\u00a0from the bank, for which reason we believe that said financing may be regarded as an\u00a0indirect investment made by Banco Disa, under Article 123-D, Paragraph b, of the\u00a0aforementioned Executive Decree 170 issued in 1993, whether said investment is\u00a0regarded as another form of securities or if the bank, in compliance with the contract,\u00a0issues bonds for the purpose of recovering the financing provided.\nThe foregoing could be accepted by the Tax Administration, provided Banco Disa is able to certify the amount and date of the financing provided to your company, as well\u00a0as the completion of the works that gave rise to the indirect investment, as required by\u00a0section 123-C of Executive Decree 170 of1993.\nWith regard to Banco Disa being able, under the current state of affairs, to issue bonds to recovering its investment and be able to utilize COPESA\u2019s direct investment\u00a0tax credit now as an indirect investment tax credit, the issuance shall meet the\u00a0requirements provided in Article 123-F, Executive Decree 170 of1993, namely that:\n1. The bonds must be authorized by and/or registered with the Panama Securities\u00a0Commission by the issuing company, in the event of a public offer; and duly registered\u00a0with appropriate accounting records, so that the Tax Administration may easily\u00a0identify and audit them;\n2. The bonds issued must be registered;\n37 R-108.\n28\nCase 8:12-cv-01647-EAK-MAP Document 3-4 Filed 07/24/12 Page 32 of 44 PageID 174\n3. The taxpayer, i.e., the person making the indirect investment by acquiring the\u00a0bonds, must obtain a certification from the issuing company, duly signed by a\u00a0Certified Public Accountant, acknowledging receipt of the funds from the investment.\nIn short, subject to the auditing powers of the Tax Administration, this office finds no legal disagreement for the reclassification of COPESA \u2019s direct investment credit as an\u00a0indirect investment credit. The credit may be used by other taxpayers acquiring bonds\u00a0issued by Banco Disa (or any other financial institution exercising the bank\u2019s rights)\u00a0for the purpose of recovering the bank\u2019s investment, in compliance with Paragraph 3,\u00a0Sub-paragraph d, Article 702 of the Tax Code, if anything, so that it may be applied by\u00a0Banco Disa as an indirect investment credit for an indirect investment made by the\u00a0bank through other securities.\nMoreover, regarding the transfer of the credit, if the credit is classed as an indirect investment credit, it will not be subject to the provisions of Paragraph 1, Subparagraph d, Article 702 of the Tax Code, to the effect that it could not be\u00a0compensated or transferred. When the credit is converted into an indirect investment\u00a0credit, it may perfectly be transferred or assigned, provided that the requirements\u00a0established by Law 28 of1995 and its regulations are met. \u201d38\n140. \u00a0COPESA then drafted the relevant documentation and began the formalities required\u00a0for the planned bond issuance.39\nE. GDR\u2019s Note of January 27,2005; Subsequent Communications Between\u00a0COPESA and Respondent; and the Planned Sale of COPESA Stock.\n141. \u00a0However, on January 27, 2005, the GDR sent COPESA Note No. 201-01-055, which\u00a0referred to a previous inquiry by COPESA dated August 17, 2004 and the GDR\u2019s\u00a0reply dated August 26, 2004 - the following:\n\u201cbased on the facts, we notice that the company you represent in 1998 made the direct investment discussed in Sub-paragraph \u2019d\u2019, Paragraph (2), Article 702 of the Tax\u00a0Code, by way of financing, as certified by a Certified Public Accountant on January\u00a031, 2003.\nThe bond issuance intended to be made this year does not fit within the benefits contained in Sub-paragraph \u2019d\u2019, Article 702 of the Tax Code, as added by Law 28\u00a0dated June 20, 1995, given that the bond issuance did not occur during the time when\u00a0the benefit was in force and as of this date such benefit has been repealed.\nFor such investments to be considered as an Income Tax credit in this case, the following conditions must be met:\n38 C-4, R-110.\n39 Memorial, \u00a7 48, C-22(a); C-22 (d).\n29\nCase 8:12-cv-01647-EAK-MAP Document 3-4 Filed 07/24/12 Page 33 of 44 PageID 175\n1. The company making the investment in bonds, stock and other securities must\u00a0perform activities related to the generation or continuous supply of electric power or\u00a0water, as required for productive operations.\n2. The company issuing bonds or securities must make the investment in said activity\u00a0no later than the following fiscal year.\n3. The bonds, stock or securities issued as indirect investments must be registered.\n4. \u00a0The taxpayer, i.e., the person making the indirect investment by acquiring such\u00a0bonds, stocks or other securities, must obtain a certificate from the company issuing\u00a0such bonds, stocks or other securities, signed by a Certified Public Accountant,\u00a0acknowledging receipt of the funds from the investment, which certificate will serve as\u00a0evidence before the General Directorate of Revenue of the Ministry of Economy\u00a0and Finance.\nShould the investment be made in 2005, the company you represent would be obliged to initiate the relevant works no later than 2006. However, on said date it would be\u00a0illegal to apply Section 6, Law 28 dated June 20, 1995, given that said law, as you\u00a0may be aware, was repealed by Article 1, Law 20 dated June 28, 1999.\nConsequently, there are no legal grounds or arguments for this Directorate to accept the application of credits for investments in bonds, stocks and other securities issued\u00a0by companies involved in activities ensuring the generation and/or continuous supply\u00a0of power or water, as required for productive operations, based on the repeal of\u00a0Section 6, Law 28, dated June 20, 1995;, and much less for that type of investments\u00a0made during the current year, as it would be unlawful due to the repeal of the law that\u00a0created them. \u201d40\n142. \u00a0As a result of the GDR Note N\u00b0 201-01-055, COPESA sent a claim letter to the GDR\u00a0on February 10, 2005,41 and on February 24, 2005 a meeting was held among\u00a0COPESA\u2019s President, Victor Berrio, two COPESA legal advisers, Guillermo Coch\u00e9z\u00a0and Victor Martinez, and the Panamanian Vice Minister of Finance, Rolando\u00a0Mirones, in the latter\u2019s offices.\n143. \u00a0\u00a0The parties presented conflicting views on the content and outcome of this meeting.\u00a0Claimants allege that Vice Minister Mirones spoke of a possible misunderstanding\u00a0about the letter dated January 27, 2005, and that he also approved the possibility of a\u00a0sale of shares in COPESA.42 Respondent denies this version of the facts and states\u00a0that Mirones only reminded the attendees of the general rules applicable in this\u00a0matter.43\n40 C-5.R-118.\n41 C-23,R-119.\n42 Memorial, \u00a752, 53.\n43 Mirones\u2019 Statement, \u00a759.\n30\nCase 8:12-cv-01647-EAK-MAP Document 3-4 Filed 07/24/12 Page 34 of 44 PageID 176\n144. \u00a0\u00a0The planned issuance of bonds with tax credits was never carried out. However,\u00a0Claimants then engaged to prepare a sale of COPESA shares carrying the tax credits\u00a0in dispute. Claimants\u2019 intent was to close the stock offering on March 30, 2005 so\u00a0that potential buyers could claim indirect tax credits against their taxes for fiscal year\u00a02004.44\n145. \u00a0\u00a0On March 28, 2005, Paul Smith sent a letter to the GDR stating the following: \u201cfor\u00a0the purpose of complying with the provisions of Article 79 of Law 6 [...] we inform\u00a0you that the Nations, Martino, EME and Ingenier\u00eda R-M companies have agreed to\u00a0sell their original shares carrying indirect investment tax benefits protected by a\u00a0vested right since their original issue date in 1998, as established in Paragraph 3,\u00a0Article 702, Tax Code.\u201d45\n146. \u00a0\u00a0In early 2005, and due to certain doubts raised by the attorneys of accounting firms\u00a0Price Waterhouse Coopers and KPMG, who had been contacted by COPESA\u2019s agents\u00a0to propose the sale of COPESA\u2019s stock, the talks between COPESA\u2019s representatives\u00a0and Mirones were resumed regarding the recognition of the tax credits and the\u00a0possibility of their transfer.\n147. \u00a0Once again, both sides hold conflicting views on the content and outcome of these\u00a0discussions. While Claimants allege that Vice Minister Mirones stated that he would\u00a0not object to the use of tax credits,46 Mirones himself claims to have made no\u00a0statement to that effect.47 This contradiction is expressed in the successive and\u00a0subsequent correspondence between COPESA\u2019s representatives and Vice Minister\u00a0Mirones.48\n148. \u00a0It is undisputed that Mirones then contacted Francisco Vega, from Price Waterhouse\u00a0Coopers, who represented the potential buyers in the planned sale of COPESA stock,\u00a0and stated that the tax credits had to be recognized first by a GDR resolution; that the\u00a0credits could not result from subsequent issuances made after the qualifying works,\u00a0that the credits could not be transferred; that the opinion by the GDR of August 26,\u00a02004 contained errors of fact and law, and was corrected by the opinion dated January\u00a027, 2005; and that, in any case, a bond or stock issuance made in 2005 could not\u00a0benefit from the tax credits established by Law 28, as that law had been repealed.49\n149. \u00a0Finally, COPESA did not carry out the planned sale of stock, and upon the failure of\u00a0the latter proposal made by Claimants to obtain the funds required, the Lending\u00a0Banks resumed their legal actions.\n44 Memorial, \u00a7 55.\n45 C-25.\n46 Memorial, \u00a7 65.\n47 Counter-Memorial, \u00a7 271; Mirones\u2019 Statement, \u00a7 64.\n48 C-28 through C-32, and R-123 through R-127.\n49 Counter-Memorial, \u00a7 276; Mirones\u2019 Statement, \u00a7 69.\n31\nCase 8:12-cv-01647-EAK-MAP Document 3-4 Filed 07/24/12 Page 35 of 44 PageID 177\nF.

Mr. Rogers Harper was to determine if there had been an\u00a0unlawful use of resources in COPESA from September 1, 1998 through October 31,\u00a02006. The report was filed on February 29, 2008.53\n154. \u00a0On April 2, 2008, Credicorp and Banco General S.A. (\u201cBanco General\u201d), a successor\u00a0of Banco Continental, as the only creditors of COPESA, assigned all their claims in\u00a0the proceeding to Del Mar Master Fund Ltd. (\u201cDel Mar\u201d) for US$8 million.54 On\u00a0April 4, 2008, the bankruptcy court approved the motion for substitution of parties\u00a0and appointed Del Mar as the new and sole creditor within the bankruptcy proceeding\u00a0against COPESA.55\n155. \u00a0\u00a0Starting on June 2008, Del Mar filed several motions to withdraw the bankruptcy\u00a0proceeding against COPESA,56 and on August 12, 2008, the bankruptcy court decided\u00a0to discharge COPESA, ordered that all precautionary measures be suspended and\u00a0dismissed the case.57\n50 R-146.\n51 R-150.\n52 R-156, R-157.\n53 R-191.\n54 R-178.\n55 R-179.\n56 R-182.\n57 R-187.\n32\nCase 8:12-cv-01647-EAK-MAP Document 3-4 Filed 07/24/12 Page 36 of 44 PageID 178\n156. \u00a0Later, Jaime Jurado requested and obtained a new judicial seizure of COPESA to\u00a0ensure collection of a debt owed to him.58\n157. \u00a0From the period between late 2006 and 2008, the income earned by COPESA was\u00a0significantly higher than the income earned from its inception in 1989 until 2005.\u00a0Both parties recognize this fact, although they differ about the causes and\u00a0explanations for such an increase.59\n158. \u00a0\u00a0Currently, COPESA remains active, its president is Victor Berrio60 and Claimants\u00a0argue that they hold an interest of about 70% in its capital stock.61\n159. \u00a0The remaining COPESA capital stock belongs to Panamanian citizens and is not\u00a0subject to claims in this arbitration proceeding.\nV. PARTIES\u2019 POSITION\n160. \u00a0Although Nations, Jurado and EME are the main Claimants in this arbitration, the\u00a0arguments will be presented in a logical order. First, the arguments related to (A) the\u00a0jurisdiction of the Arbitral Tribunal, followed by (B) the merits of the case.\nG. Jurisdiction of the Arbitral Tribunal\n1. Respondent\u2019s position\n161. \u00a0\u00a0Respondent challenges the jurisdiction of the Arbitral Tribunal to hear this case based\u00a0on (a) Jaime Jurado\u2019s alleged Panamanian nationality, (b) Nations\u2019 lack of standing\u00a0to sue, (c) EME\u2019s lack of standing to sue, and (d) the fact that it considers that the\u00a0claim refers to a tax issue excluded from the protection of the BIT between U.S.A and\u00a0Panama.\na. Regarding Jurado\u2019s Panamanian nationality\n162. \u00a0Respondent alleges that Claimant Jurado is a Panamanian national by birth, and as he\u00a0is the son of two Panamanian nationals, he has never lost his Panamanian nationality\u00a0and at all relevant times within this arbitration proceeding (dates for consent and\u00a0filing of the petition), has retained his dual nationality, i.e., American and\u00a0Panamanian. Consequently, Respondent argues that Jaime Jurado cannot sue Panama\u00a0under the ICSID Convention.\n163. \u00a0Respondent asserts that under the BIT, nationality is governed by the laws of each\u00a0party62. Therefore, Jurado\u2019s Panamanian nationality is an issue to be resolved under\n58 Transcripts p. 239:17 etseq.\n59 Reply, \u00a7 90; Berrio\u2019s Statements II, \u00a7 4; Lamoreaux II, \u00a7 27; C-46; Counter-Memorial, \u00a7 358; R-176;\u00a0Jim\u00e9nez\u2019s Statement, \u00a7 68.\n60 Transcripts p. 329 :11.\n61 Memorial, \u00a7 7.\n33\nCase 8:12-cv-01647-EAK-MAP Document 3-4 Filed 07/24/12 Page 37 of 44 PageID 179\nPanamanian law. According to Respondent, this principle has been recognized by the most important scholars as well as by several international law instruments63 and has\u00a0been repeatedly confirmed by the ICSID Tribunals.64\n164. \u00a0Regarding the alleged loss of Jurado\u2019s nationality, Respondent asserts that under the\u00a01956 Constitution, in force at the time Jurado adopted the United States nationality,\u00a0acquiring a foreign nationality could result in the tacit renunciation of the\u00a0Panamanian nationality. However, merely acquiring a foreign nationality did not\u00a0have the effect of automatically causing the loss of Panamanian nationality, but it was\u00a0also necessary to perfect the renunciation by means of a decision of the Supreme\u00a0Court of Panama, which had to be registered with the Panama Civil Registry and\u00a0published in the Panamanian Official Gazette.65\n165. \u00a0Respondent also asserts that, in any case, the enactment of the 1972 Panamanian\u00a0Constitution modified the foregoing circumstances, by instituting in its Article 13 that\u00a0nationality by birth or origin can never be lost.66 According to Respondent, this\u00a0constitutional rule was a matter of public policy and was therefore immediately\u00a0applicable.67 Consequently, even if it was determined that Jurado lost his Panamanian\u00a0nationality by acquiring the American, he would have recovered it automatically in\u00a01972 by operation of the new Constitution.\n166. \u00a0\u00a0According to the Republic, even if it was not accepted that the constitutional\u00a0provision reinstated Jurado\u2019s nationality automatically, it must be construed that it\u00a0\u201copened the door\u201d to all people under the same circumstances as Jurado, so they\u00a0could recover their Panamanian nationality, and in such a case, Jurado performed acts\u00a0evidencing his intention to benefit from the opportunity provided by the new\u00a0constitutional norm and to recover his Panamanian nationality in that way.68\n167. \u00a0\u00a0One of these acts is Jurado\u2019s application for a Panamanian identity document in\u00a01978,69 which is only issued to Panamanian nationals. Said document is deemed\u00a0authentic evidence of its holder\u2019s identity and nationality under Panamanian law.70\n62 Article 1(a) of the BIT.\n63 1930 Hague Convention on Certain Questions Relating to the Conflict of Nationality Laws, arts. 1 and 2\u00a0(RAL-47).\n64 loan Micula, Viorel Micula, SC.

This applied both to a statement on his Panamanian nationality and an\u00a0additional statement made on Paragraph 11 of his application, asserting that he was\u00a0\u201cresiding at Santa Rita Street, Obarrio Urban Development, Bella Vista Division, in\u00a0Panama\", which contradicts the assertions made by him on his statement, whereby he\u00a0alleged that he had not lived or worked in Panama since he emigrated to the U.S.7\n169. \u00a0Another act by which Jurado again asserted that he was a Panamanian national,\u00a0according to Respondent, occurred on August 20, 1993 during the execution of a\u00a0public instrument granting a power of attorney to Julio Elias Berrios Herrera so that\u00a0he could represent EME in Panama. In said act, Jurado identified himself as a\u00a0Panamanian national holding identity document n\u00b0 8-78-742, before the General\u00a0Consul of Panama in Tampa, Florida.72\n170. \u00a0And again Jurado identified himself as a Panamanian national on September 21,\u00a01993, in order to grant a general power of attorney to Victor Luis Berrio Anderson,\u00a0for the purpose of managing Mr. Jurado\u2019s business in Panama73. In this document,\u00a0Mr. Jurado is also identified as a Panamanian national holding identity document n\u00b0\u00a08-78-742.74\n171. \u00a0Respondent acknowledges that under certain circumstances, which it describes as\u00a0\u201cextremely exceptional\", international law may reject the international recognition of\u00a0a nationality granted by a State, particularly if the grounds for such grant were neither\u00a0valid nor internationally recognized, or if a nationality is intended to be imposed\u00a0involuntarily. However, Respondent asserts that in this case no such exceptional\u00a0circumstances exist.75\n172. \u00a0In this case, Jurado was bom and lived in Panama, thus acquiring his Panamanian\u00a0nationality based on jus solis, a widely recognized principle. Besides, Jurado has not\u00a0denied his Panamanian nationality; on the contrary, he has voluntarily acknowledged\u00a0it to benefit from the advantages of a dual nationality. Therefore, Claimants\u2019\u00a0allegation stating that Panama would be imposing the Panamanian nationality on\u00a0Jurado against his will cannot be accepted.76\n173. \u00a0\u00a0After asserting Jurado\u2019s Panamanian nationality, Respondent claims that this situation\u00a0is contrary to the provisions of Article 25.2(a) of the ICSID Convention, regarding\n71 Jaime Jurado\u2019s Affidavit, \u00a7 3.\n72R-10.\n73 Jurado\u2019s Transcripts, p.186.\n74 R-242.\n75 Counter-Memorial, \u00a7 376 et seq.\n76 Counter-Memorial, \u00a7389, Rejoinder, \u00a7 40 et seq.\n35\nCase 8:12-cv-01647-EAK-MAP Document 3-4 Filed 07/24/12 Page 39 of 44 PageID 181\nthe investor\u2019s nationality, i.e., the investor may not be a national of the Contracting State where the protected investment is made.\n174. \u00a0Respondent alleges that said prohibition is absolute and cannot be corrected even\u00a0with the consent of the Contracting State.77\n175. \u00a0\u00a0Respondent also asserts that the dominant or effective nationality criterion mentioned\u00a0by Claimants is not applicable in ICSID case law, as Article 25 of the Convention\u00a0explains this situation clearly enough and prevents it from being admitted.78 In any\u00a0case, said criterion could only be applied to determine if a claimant is a national or\u00a0not of the other Contracting State and is therefore entitled to the protection afforded\u00a0under said Convention.\n176. \u00a0\u00a0Respondent alleges that applying the effective nationality criterion where there is no\u00a0indication that the Contracting States intended to apply it would constitute an\u00a0unlawful amendment to the BIT, in clear contradiction with the ICSID Convention,\u00a0and would represent a manifest excess of authority by the Tribunal, as its jurisdiction\u00a0is derived from said treaty.79\n177. \u00a0Finally, Respondent states that, in addition to the obstacle caused by his Panamanian\u00a0nationality, Jaime Jurado lacks standing to sue in this arbitration proceeding because\u00a0in 2000, prior to any action commenced by the Republic, he had represented that the\u00a0COPESA stock was worthless in the Indemnity and Transfer Agreement dated April\u00a01, 2000, executed by EME and Jurado.80\nb. Regarding Nations\u2019 lack of standing to sue\n178. \u00a0\u00a0Respondent alleges that Nations lacks standing to sue for two reasons: (i) it does not\u00a0have legal title to the COPESA stock, and (ii) it has stated that its investment in\u00a0COPESA had been reduced to nothing prior to Respondent\u2019s actions.\n179. \u00a0\u00a0The Republic maintains that Nations has disputed the legitimacy of its own title to\u00a0COPESA stock in a proceeding it had instituted against Anaheim, Banco Disa et al.,\u00a0before the Panamanian courts,81 where it stated under oath that the company selling\u00a0the stock, as well as the company from which the latter had acquired them, were not\u00a0the legal owners of stock in COPESA.\n180. \u00a0Respondent then concludes that based on the doctrine of estoppel, Nations should not\u00a0be allowed to make allegations contrary to its previous statements before Panamanian\n77 Counter-Memorial, \u00a7 391 etseq., Schreuer/Kriebaum\u2019s Report I, \u00a7 42 RAL-56, \u00a7 29.\n78 Counter-Memorial, \u00a7 404 et seq.\n19 Counter-Memorial, \u00a7 413.\n80 Agreement attached to Jaime Jurado\u2019s Statement, section 5; Counter-Memorial, \u00a7 51.\n81 Counter-Memorial, \u00a7 61; R-101, Paragraph41, Rejoinder, \u00a7 15 etseq.\n36\nCase 8:12-cv-01647-EAK-MAP Document 3-4 Filed 07/24/12 Page 40 of 44 PageID 182\ncourts and the Arbitral Tribunal must therefore state that it lacks jurisdiction to hear Nations\u2019 claims.82\n181. \u00a0Respondent additionally alleges that, within the above-mentioned proceeding against\u00a0Anaheim, Banco Disa etal., Nations had stated that its investment in COPESA had\u00a0been reduced to \u201calmost nothing\u201d?3\n182. \u00a0According to Panama, this circumstance can be seen in the annual reports 10-K filed\u00a0by Nation\u2019s parent company, Unisource, where it may be noted that the value of\u00a0Nations\u2019 investment in COPESA had gradually been reduced until the alleged\u00a0investment was finally written off in 2004.84\n183. \u00a0\u00a0In view of the foregoing, the Arbitral Tribunal should decline to exercise jurisdiction\u00a0with respect to Nations.\nc. With Regard to EME\u2019s Lack of Standing to Sue\n184. \u00a0\u00a0Respondent asserts that EME lacks standing to sue in this arbitration proceeding as it\u00a0unequivocally stated that it had transferred any right and interest in the alleged\u00a0investment in COPESA to Jurado.85 In view of the foregoing, EME lacks any legal\u00a0interest in the outcome of the proceeding or standing to sue therein.\n185. \u00a0Respondent adds that Claimants have neither denied nor challenged this allegation\u00a0made by the Republic. Thus, the Arbitral Tribunal must state that it lacks jurisdiction\u00a0over EME\u2019s claims.\nd- With Regard to the Exclusion of Matters of Taxation from the BIT\n186. Respondent asserts that the issue in this case is to determine if Claimants are entitled to certain tax credits, and assuming they are, if they can transfer them to third parties.\u00a0Therefore, this case involves matters of taxation exclusively, and consequently, the\u00a0Arbitral Tribunal lacks jurisdiction to hear these claims, unless they fall within one of\u00a0the three exceptions for matters of taxation provided for by the BIT in its\u00a0Article XI.2.\n187. \u00a0\u00a0Respondent asserts that ICSID arbitral tribunals are bound by the limitation of the\u00a0consent granted by the parties in the treaties executed by them, and should said\u00a0tribunals hear matters that have been excluded from the treaty, they would be acting\n82 Hoyos\u2019 Report II, \u00a7 30, et seq.\n83 R-101, Paragraph 41.\n84 Counter-Memorial, \u00a7 62; R-l 16.\n85 Jurado\u2019s Statement and EME\u2019s Statement, Counter-Memorial, \u00a7 52, Rejoinder, \u00a7 20-21.\n37\nCase 8:12-cv-01647-EAK-MAP Document 3-4 Filed 07/24/12 Page 41 of 44 PageID 183\nultra petita and committing an abuse of power, which would be grounds for the annulment of their awards.8\n188. \u00a0\u00a0In the BIT between U.S.A. and Panama, Article XI.2 excludes matters of taxation\u00a0from the protection of the Treaty, except with regard to 3 cases: (a) expropriation\u00a0pursuant to Article IV; (b) transfers pursuant to Article VI; and/or (c) the observance\u00a0and enforcement of the terms of an investment agreement or authorization, as\u00a0referred to in Article VII(l) (a) or (b). Respondent asserts that none of the exceptions\u00a0allowing the application of the BIT to a matter of taxation can be found in this case.\n189. \u00a0\u00a0The case related to the free transfer of capital under Article VI has not been alleged\u00a0and is not at issue in this case.\n190. \u00a0Regarding compliance with the terms of a convention or authorization, Respondent\u00a0argues that, although Claimants attempted to base their first Request for Arbitration\u00a0on this ground,87 since then they have abandoned this course of action and have made\u00a0no further reference to it in their pleadings, and thus this ground must be regarded as\u00a0abandoned.\n191. \u00a0Furthermore, Respondent asserts that this argument cannot succeed, as no investment\u00a0authorization system has been established in Panama, nor have any bodies been\u00a0created or controlling authorities been appointed; on the contrary, Panama has a very\u00a0liberal foreign investment system . Respondent points out that the laws that Claimants\u00a0attempt to classify as investment authorizations do not exclusively refer to\u00a0investments and are also aimed at both foreigners and Panamanian nationals.\n192. \u00a0Finally, with respect to any possible argument based on the expropriation exception\u00a0under Article IV of the BIT, Respondent maintains that Claimants have not even\u00a0made a prima facie case based on expropriation; thus, this possibility must also be\u00a0denied.\n193. \u00a0\u00a0Respondent asserts that in order to file a claim for expropriation two threshold\u00a0requirements must be met: (i) it must be proven that an investment has been made for\u00a0a known value prior to the alleged acts of the State, and (ii) it must be proven that the\u00a0investment was later deprived of such value or certain fundamental property rights\u00a0due to the measures implemented by the State.88\n194. \u00a0However, the claim brought by Claimants in this arbitration proceeding does not meet\u00a0said requirements as the alleged investment had already lost its actual economic value\u00a0before the alleged actions of the State, as acknowledged by Claimants.\n86 Counter-Memorial, \u00a7 432.\n87 Request for Arbitration \u00a7 4.\n88 Counter-Memorial, \u00a7 429.\n38\nCase 8:12-cv-01647-EAK-MAP Document 3-4 Filed 07/24/12 Page 42 of 44 PageID 184\n195. \u00a0\u00a0Additionally, the alleged right of Claimants to issue bonds carrying tax credits and to\u00a0transfer such indirect investment credits does not constitute an essential feature of\u00a0ownership that could be the basis for an expropriation claim.\n196. \u00a0\u00a0Respondent maintains that even if the Arbitral Tribunal found that the claim for\u00a0expropriation should proceed, it should nevertheless adjudge its lack of jurisdiction\u00a0over the other claims raised by Claimants, as the exceptions in the clause governing\u00a0matters of taxation do not apply to the other claims based on Article II.2 of the BIT,\u00a0and Claimants\u2019 thesis stating that Article X.l \u201copened the door\u201d to a debate over the\u00a0performance of all other obligations under the BIT cannot apply.89\n197. \u00a0Regarding Article XL 1, Respondent asserts that it may not be considered a\u00a0compulsory clause, both for the fact that it has been considered separately from\u00a0Article XI.2 and because of the language of the clause itself.90\n198. \u00a0\u00a0Finally, Respondent rejects Claimants\u2019 thesis stating that its investment consisted of\u00a0the tax credit itself and their right to transfer it, and that expropriation occurred as a\u00a0result of the State\u2019s denying such credits and their transferability. In fact, according to\u00a0Respondent, even assuming for the sake of argument that the purpose of the\u00a0investment was the tax credits, such transaction would not meet the requirements of\u00a0Article 25 of the ICSID Convention in connection with the criteria for determining an\u00a0investment, as described in ICSID case law.91\n2. Claimants\u2019 Position\n199. \u00a0\u00a0Claimants assert that the Arbitral Tribunal has jurisdiction to hear this case as:\u00a0(a) they deny that Jaime Jurado is a Panamanian national, (b) they allege that Nations\u00a0has standing to sue in this arbitration (c) as well as EME, and (d) they consider that,\u00a0insofar as the claim exceeds matters merely related to taxation, the provisions of the\u00a0BIT related to the prohibition of expropriation and the obligation of fair and equitable\u00a0treatment are both applicable.\ne. With Regard to Jurado\u2019s Nationality\n200. \u00a0\u00a0Claimants allege that Jurado emigrated to the United States of America when he was\u00a08 years old and became a naturalized U.S. citizen when he was twenty years of age;\n89 Reply, \u00a7 185.\n90 Counter-Memorial \u00a7 462 et seq., (RAL-79), \u00a7216 et seq.\n91 Rejoinder, \u00a7 87 et seq.'. \u201cThe ICSID tribunals have decided that an investment must meet four cumulative\u00a0requirements regarding jurisdiction, to wit: (i) it must consist of a contribution made by an investor; (ii) for a\u00a0project with a certain duration, (iii) the risks of the transaction must be shared, and (iv) they must entail a\u00a0contribution to the economic development of the State receiving the investment.\u201d See Joy Mining Machinery\u00a0Limited v.

Since then, Jurado has served in the US\u00a0Army and has always lived, worked and voted in the U.S.A. Additionally, he\u00a0travelled to and from Panama using his American passport, which demonstrates that\u00a0he never intended to keep his Panamanian nationality.95\n203. \u00a0Claimants add that the court decisions or judgments to which Respondent merely\u00a0would have declaratory effect, as the act of renunciation would have already been\u00a0executed, thereby being perfected and having effects since the moment in which the\u00a0foreign nationality was acquired..96\n204. \u00a0\u00a0Claimants allege that, even though the 1972 Constitution modified the consequences\u00a0that result from the acquisition of another nationality, said provisions cannot be\u00a0applied retroactively to conduct that happened in 1954. This is so by order of the\u00a01972 Constitution, which establishes the non-retroactivity of laws in its Articles 46\u00a0and 314, without regard to Respondent\u2019s argument that the provision is \u201can absolute\u00a0public policy\u201d, as under the Constitution, statutes must expressly state that they are an\u00a0absolute public policy to be considered as such.97\n205. \u00a0Regarding the argument about the recovery of nationality, Claimants argue that the\u00a0Constitutions of 1946 and 1972 do not provide for the automatic recovery of\u00a0nationality. Article 15 of the 1946 Constitution sets forth that \u201cnationality may be\u00a0recovered only by virtue of a decree of rehabilitation issued by the National\u00a0Assembly;\u201d9\\* but Jurado has never requested such rehabilitation.\n92 1946 Constitution of Panama, Art. 15, Reply \u00a7 29 et seq.\n93 Reply, \u00a7 32 et seq.\n94 Reply, \u00a7 35 er seq.\n95 Reply, \u00a7 37, C-55.\n96 Reply, \u00a7 41.\n97 Reply, \u00a7 47 and 48.\n98 Reply, \u00a751.\n40\nCase 8:12-cv-01647-EAK-MAP Document 3-4 Filed 07/24/12 Page 44 of 44 PageID 186\n206. \u00a0\u00a0Claimants allege that, in any case, under international law, Jurado may reject his\u00a0Panamanian nationality, and Panama cannot impose such nationality on him\u20199. They\u00a0also affirm that for the purposes of this arbitration proceeding, it is the Arbitral\u00a0Tribunal\u2019s duty, rather than Respondent\u2019s, to decide on Jurado\u2019s nationality.100\n207. \u00a0\u00a0Therefore, Claimants allege that Jurado has been a U.S. citizen for over 50 years and\u00a0that he has been at all times in regard to this controversy. They also affirm that\u00a0Jaime Jurado does not have Panamanian nationality and thus is not a dual national.101\n208. \u00a0\u00a0Finally and alternatively, Claimants argue that if for any reason the Arbitral Tribunal\u00a0determines that Mr. Jurado has dual nationality, for the purposes of determining its\u00a0jurisdiction under the Convention, the Arbitral Tribunal should consider the\u00a0customary rules of international law102 and the dominant and effective nationality\u00a0doctrine, which is \u201csupported by Article 25(1) of the Convention\u201d103 and ICSID case\u00a0law.104\nf. With Regard to Nations\u2019 Standing to Sue\n209. \u00a0\u00a0Claimants allege that Respondent deceptively describes the litigation between\u00a0Nations and Anaheim Enterprises, which actually involved an alleged complex\u00a0structure designed by Anaheim and Banco Disa to benefit from the proceeds of the\u00a0sale of COPESA stock.105\n210. \u00a0\u00a0Claimants assert that Nations never stated implicitly or explicitly that it was not the\u00a0owner of its shares in COPESA.106 On the contrary, Nations ratifies in all its\u00a0pleadings that it holds 22.4 million shares of COPESA common stock.\n211. \u00a0\u00a0Regarding the loss of value of the COPESA stock, Claimants point out that Nations\u2019\u00a0parent company, Unisource, amortized the value of COPESA stock in its consolidated\u00a0financial statements in compliance with the applicable U.S. GAAP on diminished\u00a0assets.

In fact,\u00a0Claimants allege that if Panama had not thwarted their plans, Nations would have\u00a0earned about US$4 million from the sale of its COPESA common stock.108\ng. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0With Regard to EME\u2019s Standing to Sue\n213. \u00a0Claimants assert that EME had not endorsed the stock certificates to Jurado until the\u00a0date of the request for arbitration; therefore, EME still appears as the registered\u00a0owner of such stock in COPESA\u2019s books, even though the economic interest of the\u00a0stock corresponds to Jurado. Claimants allege that EME appears as the holder of the\u00a0original shares issued by COPESA, which are part of the subject matter of this\u00a0arbitration.109\n214. \u00a0\u00a0Claimants also assert that EME, \u201cas an investor and shareholder of record has the\u00a0legal duty to defend and protect its investment rights by virtue of the Treaty,\u201d110 and\u00a0affirm that EME is a United States investor, and as such, is an interested party with\u00a0standing to sue as it must prove that the securities had a real value.\nh. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0With Regard to the Exclusion of Matters of Taxation in the BIT\n215. \u00a0\u00a0Claimants allege that, even though Claimants\u2019 rights to tax credits are based on\u00a0Panamanian tax laws, Panama\u2019s interference with Claimants\u2019 rights exceeds mere\u00a0matters of taxation and, consequently, the provisions of the BIT related to the\u00a0prohibition of expropriation stated in Article IV, the duty of fair and equitable\u00a0treatment set forth in Article II, plus the provisions on taxation of Article XI apply.111\n216. \u00a0\u00a0Claimants affirm that the exception of Article XI.2, which allows the application of\u00a0the Treaty to matters of taxation, is applicable in this case as it falls within the\u00a0exceptions established in Article XI.2(a), an expropriation case according to\u00a0Article IV, and also in Article XI.2(c), as an investment authorization has been\u00a0hindered under Article VII. 1(b) of the BIT.\n217. \u00a0\u00a0Claimants affirm that the expropriation occurred indirectly as a result of Panama\u2019s\u00a0regulatory and administrative actions that deprived Claimants of the tax credits\n107 Reply \u00a7 14.\n108 Reply, \u00a7 15.\n109 Memorial, \u00a7 5.\n110 Objections to the Petition for Bifurcation \u00a7 29.\nReply \u00a7 194.\n42\nCase 8:12-cv-01647-EAK-MAP Document 3-5 Filed 07/24/12 Page 2 of 44 PageID 188\ngranted under Law 28 and the associated value of their investments in COPESA, and/or the benefits that could reasonably be expected from them.\n218. \u00a0In that regard, Claimants argue that the tax credits they were denied were the very\u00a0object of their investment, and that the State\u2019s acts denying such credits thus\u00a0constitute an expropriation of their investment.112 In connection with this, Claimants\u00a0deny Respondent\u2019s argument that their investment would not qualify based on the\u00a0criteria established in Salini and other decisions cited by Respondent, and argue that\u00a0ICSID case law allows and favors a broader definition of investment, according to\u00a0which the rights to tax credits may be considered an investment under Article 25 of\u00a0the ICSID Convention.113\n219. \u00a0Regarding the exception provided for in Article XI.2(c), Claimants allege that even\u00a0though Panama does not have a particular governmental agency designated to act as\u00a0an authority over foreign investment, Law 28, together with Law 6 and any related\u00a0laws and regulations, as well as Law 54, established a legal framework that\u00a0constitutes an investment authorization for power generation plants, such as\u00a0COPESA\u2019s.114\n220. \u00a0\u00a0Finally, Claimants maintain that the existence of a tax exclusion clause in the BIT\u00a0does not prevent the Arbitral Tribunal, even when faced with a matter tied to tax\u00a0matters, from investigating whether the remaining provisions of the Treaty115 have\u00a0been complied with. Actually, Article XL 1 allows the extension of the duty of fair\u00a0and equitable treatment provided for in the BIT to matters of taxation.\n221. \u00a0\u00a0In that regard, Claimants allege that Panama has breached its duty of fair and\u00a0equitable treatment and has denied Claimants the security and protection provided for\u00a0in Article 11(2) of the BIT because it did not respect the framework of safeguards\u00a0established for Claimants by Panamanian and international laws, which induced them\u00a0to make their investment, and by hindering through arbitrary and discriminatory\u00a0measures the management, operation, maintenance, use and disposition of their\u00a0investments, thus depriving them of their value.116\nH.

Indirect Expropriation of Claimants\u2019 Investment by Panama\n251. \u00a0\u00a0Claimants argue that Respondent\u2019s acts constitute an indirect expropriation of their\u00a0investment, which occurs when the actions of the State \u201cdeprive the owner, in whole\u00a0or in part, from the use or the reasonably expected economic benefit of its\u00a0property.\u2019^\n252. \u00a0\u00a0Claimants allege that they are entitled to the tax credits granted by Law 28, and\u00a0maintain that these rights qualify as an investment by virtue of the definition stated in\u00a0Article 1(d) of the BIT and from the broader interpretation of the definition of\u00a0protected investments that must be adopted.145\n253. \u00a0According to Claimants, \u201conce issued, the indirect tax credits remain attached to\u00a0shares of the qualified company until they are exhausted or fully utilized.\u201d146\n141 Memorial \u00a7 57-59; C-27.\n142 Memorial \u00a7 65.\n143 Memorial, \u00a7 68.\n144 Award in Occidental v.

Therefore, Respondent\u2019s arguments stating that\u00a0Claimants continued to enjoy at all times their rights derived from their shareholdings\u00a0in COPESA are irrelevant.147\n255. \u00a0\u00a0Likewise, Claimants allege that the value of tax credits to which they are entitled is\u00a0independent of the value of COPESA or its stock, as the value of said credits is that\u00a0of the investment in the qualified activity under Law 28. Therefore, Respondents\u2019\u00a0arguments stating that Claimants\u2019 investments lacked any value before Respondent\u2019s\u00a0actions are not admissible.\n256. \u00a0\u00a0Claimants also affirm that their claim to the tax credits is clearly associated with their\u00a0investment in COPESA, as Law 28 was enacted by Panama in an attempt to privatize\u00a0several industries and attract foreign investors.148\n257. \u00a0\u00a0Claimants assert that the cases cited by Respondent, particularly the Pope & Talbot\u00a0award, are based on a strict interpretation of the term \u201cindirect expropriation\u201d and are\u00a0not applicable to this case.\n258. \u00a0Claimants allege that Law 28 granted and confirmed the lawful expectations of\u00a0Claimants regarding the validity and transferability of the tax credits.149\n259. \u00a0\u00a0Claimants affirm the causality link between Panama\u2019s actions and the damages\u00a0claimed by Claimants. The Republic, through various actions, denied recognition of\u00a0the tax credits. The plan to sell COPESA stock failed and thus Claimants and\u00a0COPESA were prevented from repaying the Lending Banks, thus causing COPESA\u00a0to go bankrupt and resulting in the damages claimed.150\n260. \u00a0Claimants reject Respondent\u2019s allegations about misappropriation of funds and\u00a0mismanagement in COPESA. The allegations were refuted by the audit report\u00a0submitted by Claimants which confirms that all the services paid for were actually\u00a0provided,151 and by Claimants\u2019 account of the expenses incurred and the loans\u00a0requested.152 They also affirm that COPESA\u2019s profitability from the late 2006 to\u00a02008 can be explained by a confluence of factors and circumstances that have nothing\u00a0to do with the management of the company.153\n147 Reply, \u00a7 168.\n148 Reply, \u00a7 156.\n149 Reply, \u00a7 189, \u00a7 192.\n150 Reply, \u00a7 3, \u00a7 15, \u00a7204.\n151 Reply, \u00a7 97 et seq.; C-48.\n152 Reply, \u00a7 98 et seq.; \u00a7 103 el seq.\n153 Reply \u00a7 87 et seq.\n49\nCase 8:12-cv-01647-EAK-MAP Document 3-5 Filed 07/24/12 Page 9 of 44 PageID 195\nf. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Panama Breaches Other Obligations under the BIT\n261. \u00a0According to Claimants, the acts of the Republic of Panama would constitute (f.a.) a\u00a0violation of its obligations under Article XI of the BIT; and (f.b.) a violation of its\u00a0duty to afford a fair and equitable treatment. Besides, (f.c.), Claimants argue that the\u00a0acts of the Panamanian judiciary are arbitrary and unfair.\nf.a. Unfair Tax Policies\n262. \u00a0\u00a0Claimants point out that Respondent\u2019s actions constituted unfair and inequitable tax\u00a0policies that had the effect of an expropriation, in violation of Article XI of the BIT.\n263. \u00a0\u00a0Therefore, by virtue of Article IV of the BIT, Respondent is required to compensate\u00a0Claimants \"in an amount equal to the full market value of the expropriated\u00a0investment immediately before the expropriating action became known.\u201d'54\nf.b. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Breach of Article II.2 of the BIT\n264. \u00a0\u00a0Claimants allege that Respondent failed to comply with the duty to afford fair and\u00a0equitable treatment, and denied full protection and security, to Claimants\u2019\u00a0investments pursuant to Panamanian and international law.\n265. \u00a0They also claim that through arbitrary actions, Respondent has undermined the\u00a0management, operation, maintenance, use, enjoyment and disposal of the investment\u00a0made by Claimants, thus depriving the investment of its value.155\nf.c. Respondent\u2019s Other Bad Faith Actions\n266. \u00a0Finally, Claimants point out that Panama, through its judiciary, implemented arbitrary\u00a0and unfair measures against COPESA seeking to cause its bankruptcy and adversely\u00a0affecting Claimants\u2019 rights. These actions consisted in, inter alia, threats and direct\u00a0and indirect pressure against COPESA\u2019s representatives, thus causing Claimants\u00a0additional expenditure of time and money.156\ng. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Claimants\u2019 Reply to Panama\u2019s Arguments\n267. \u00a0The Republic has presented several arguments in its defense against Claimants\u2019\u00a0complaint. Thus, Panama argued that it was necessary to file a formal request for\u00a0recognition with the competent authority in order to enjoy tax credits; in order to be\u00a0entitled to said credits the investment had to be made in cash, the depreciation of\u00a0company assets prevented the company from enjoying the tax credits; that credits are\u00a0classified at the time of the investment and cannot be reclassified; and that indirect\u00a0investment tax credits are not transferable.\n,54 Memorial, \u00a7 39.\n155 Memorial, Introduction, n\u00b0 3; \u00a7 78, \u00a7 85.\n156 Memorial, \u00a7 78-79.\n50\nCase 8:12-cv-01647-EAK-MAP Document 3-5 Filed 07/24/12 Page 10 of 44 PageID 196\n268. \u00a0\u00a0Claimants\u2019 replies with regard to: (g.a.) the alleged need for a formal certification,\u00a0(g.b.) the alleged requirement that the investment be made in cash, (g.c.) the\u00a0incompatibility between tax credits and depreciation, (g.d.) the classification, and\u00a0(g.e.) their transferability, are explained below.\ng.a. A Request for Recognition of Credits is not Required.\n269. \u00a0\u00a0Claimants affirm that, under the applicable provisions, investors were not required to\u00a0file a formal request for recognition of tax credits, or obtain a certification of such\u00a0credits, as Executive Decree 274 only provides for the obligation to produce and\u00a0make certain documents available in case they are required by the GDR.157 In any\u00a0case, Claimants argue that they voluntarily produced the documents and certifications\u00a0of their investments on March 11, 2003. Thus, Claimants met said requirement in\u00a0full.158\ng.b. There is no Alleged Obligation to Make a\nCash Investment\n270. \u00a0\u00a0The law makes no reference to this obligation alleged by Claimants. Indirect\u00a0investment tax credits could be generated as a result of any cash or non-cash\u00a0investment, such as investments in infrastructure, equipment of a duly set value, or\u00a0others.159\ng.c. Asset Depreciation and the Right to Tax\nCredits are not Mutually Exclusive\n271. \u00a0Regarding Respondent\u2019s assertion on the incompatibility of asset depreciation with a\u00a0claim for tax credits, Claimants replied that Law 28 only prevents the company\u00a0depreciating its assets from using tax credits against taxes within such depreciation\u00a0period. Therefore, the company may very well enjoy its tax credits in the following\u00a0periods.160\n272. \u00a0\u00a0Claimants allege that Respondent\u2019s interpretation is erroneous since, if it was\u00a0admitted, the incentive provided for by Law 28 would be extinguished. Asset\u00a0depreciation is open to all companies and not only to those whose activity was\u00a0fostered by Law 28.\n157 Section 123c of Executive Decree 274: \u201cTaxpayers shall make the above-mentioned certifications \u2014affidavits\u00a0and other reports or certificates available to the General Directorate of Revenue of the Ministry of Economy and\u00a0Finance, as required.\u201d\n158 Reply, \u00a7 115 et seq.

Tax Credits are Classified at the Time of Implementation\n273. \u00a0\u00a0Claimants argue that the alleged obligation to classify credits at the time the\u00a0investment is made and Respondent\u2019s assertion that they could not be reclassified\u00a0later are erroneous. Actually, taxpayers may classify tax credits as desired, provided\u00a0they are not applied in their tax returns. Therefore, give that neither COPESA nor\u00a0Claimants have used their tax credits yet, they may classify them as they deem\u00a0best161.\ng.e. Indirect Investment Tax Credits are Transferable\n274. \u00a0\u00a0Claimants maintain that indirect investment tax credits are inherently transferable\u00a0because they are included in negotiable securities162. This interpretation is based on\u00a0the fact that the Panamanian legislature expressly prohibited direct investment\u00a0credits, whereas no such restriction was imposed on indirect investment credits.\n275. \u00a0\u00a0Claimants also believe that the phrase \u201cthey may be used by all taxpayers '' in\u00a0Article 702 (3) of the Tax Code, as amended by Section 6 of Law 28, is another\u00a0indication of their transferability.\n276. \u00a0\u00a0Claimants also argue that the purpose of Law 28, i.e., fostering foreign investments,\u00a0could not be fulfilled if the indirect investment credits offered to investors could not\u00a0be freely transferred, as foreigners do not normally pay income tax in Panama.163\u00a0Thus, the alleged credit transfer prohibition would be contrary to the letter and spirit\u00a0of the law.164\nh. Losses\n277. \u00a0\u00a0Claimants argue that the acts of the Republic caused substantial economic losses to\u00a0Claimants and COPESA, namely, \u201closs of the return expected from the investment,\u00a0considerable costs incurred to compensate for the loss of the use of the tax credits and\u00a0a significant decrease in the value of Claimants\u2019 investment in COPESA, to the point\u00a0of turning this investment into something substantially worthless.\u201d165\n2. Respondent\u2019s Position\n278. \u00a0\u00a0The Republic (2.1) denies that its acts were contrary to Panamanian tax regulations,\u00a0and (2.2.) that it breached its international obligations.\n161 Reply, \u00a7 149.\n162 Memorial \u00a7 30; Reply \u00a7 119 et seq.\n163 Reply, \u00a7 148.\n164 Reply, \u00a7 125.\n165 Memorial, Introduction.\n52\nCase 8:12-cv-01647-EAK-MAP Document 3-5 Filed 07/24/12 Page 12 of 44 PageID 198\n2.1 Tax Regulations\n279. \u00a0Respondent argues that it has not breached Panamanian tax regulations, since: (a)\u00a0Claimants have never filed a formal request for recognition of their alleged tax\u00a0credits, (b) the GDR's opinions did not grant any rights to Claimants, (c) Vice\u00a0Minister Mirones never infringed Claimants\u2019 rights, (d) Claimants had no right to tax\u00a0credits, (e) the law prohibited the admission of the bond issue planned by COPESA,\u00a0and (f) the alleged tax credits could not be transferred through the sale of COPESA\u00a0stock.\n(a) \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Claimants Have Never Requested the Recognition of Tax\u00a0Credits\n280. \u00a0\u00a0First, Respondent alleges that in order to use any tax credits to which they believed to\u00a0be entitled, Claimants had to formally ask the GDR to recognize its existence and\u00a0ownership by formal resolution.\n281. \u00a0\u00a0Claimants have never duly requested the recognition of their alleged tax credits, and\u00a0cannot therefore complain about their non-recognition.166\n(b) \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The GDR\u2019s Opinions Did not Grant Claimants any Rights\n282. \u00a0Regarding the GDR\u2019s opinions in response to several inquiries made by COPESA,\u00a0they only contained non-binding statements. Besides, their content differs from the\u00a0content alleged by Claimants. With respect to the 2004 opinion, it contained\u00a0erroneous statements that had to be corrected by the GDR itself.\n283. \u00a0Respondent also affirmed that COPESA wrongfully manipulated the GDR in their\u00a0inquiries in order to obtain favorable opinions by making false statements. In this\u00a0regard, Respondent points out that it may be observed that the GDR developed the\u00a0views set forth in its opinions on the basis of the statements made by COPESA in its\u00a0inquiries without analyzing the truthfulness of such statements167\n284. \u00a0Moreover, Respondent argues that Claimants\u2019 assertions on the content of the 2004\u00a0opinion are false. The GDR never granted or recognized tax credits to COPESA or\u00a0Claimants. On the contrary, it stated that Banco Disa may be entitled to the credits\u00a0because it is a main investor in the Copesa Plant.168\n285. \u00a0Anyway, the 2004 opinion is erroneous and contrary to the law in many ways, such\u00a0as: that the loan for the financing the Copesa Plant could constitute an investment by\u00a0Banco Disa; the possibility that Banco Disa could issue bonds even though it was not\u00a0a company performing qualified activities under Law 28; the possibility that tax\u00a0credits could arise from a bond issue that would not result in the construction of a\n166 Counter-Memorial \u00a7 480, 481, Rejoinder, \u00a7 144.\n167 Counter-Memorial \u00a7 217, \u00a7 221, \u00a7 232.\ni68R-110.\n53\nCase 8:12-cv-01647-EAK-MAP Document 3-5 Filed 07/24/12 Page 13 of 44 PageID 199\nqualified infrastructure within the year following the investments; and the possibility that tax credits could be restructured and transferred.\n286. \u00a0According to Respondent and based on the foregoing, the January 27, 2005 GDR\u00a0Opinion was not only lawful and proper, but also a statutory obligation of the\u00a0competent authority, the GDR, to correct the errors included in its former opinion.\n(c) \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mirones\u2019 Alleged Acts\n287. \u00a0\u00a0In addition, the Republic affirms that it did not take any action to prevent a bond\u00a0issue by COPESA.169 Vice Minister Mirones only informed the parties involved that,\u00a0as a general rule, tax credits had to be recognized by the GDR, and the tax credits\u00a0being offered had not been recognized. Respondent points out that this is one of the\u00a0duties of the MEF.170\n288. \u00a0Regarding the other communications between Claimants and Mirones, Respondent\u00a0stated that Mirones did not affirm that tax credits would be recognized or suggested\u00a0COPESA that it should make a bond issue neither at the meeting held on February 24,\u00a02005, nor at any other subsequent occasions. On the contrary, Mirones ratified the\u00a0criteria of the Panamanian authority on this matter and repeated the analysis of the\u00a0GDR set forth in its opinion dated January 27, 2005.171\n(d) \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Claimants Were not Entitled to Tax Credits\n289. \u00a0According to Panama, Claimants were not entitled to tax credits as they did not meet\u00a0the requirements of Law 28.\n290. \u00a0\u00a0Claimants fail to prove their alleged investments in COPESA, and even if it was\u00a0admitted that they invested in stock, there is no evidence that the money allegedly\u00a0invested was used for the construction of the Copesa Plant.\n291. \u00a0Respondent points out in this regard that its expert concluded, based on COPESA\u2019s\u00a0documents, that the total investment in COPESA\u2019s electrical infrastructure, which\u00a0might qualify under Law 28, amounted to US$20.9 million, therefore \u201cthe maximum\u00a0value of tax credits for investments in the Copesa Plant - for the aggregate\u00a0investments, including without limitation, Claimants \u2019 investment - would amount to a\u00a0maximum of US$20.9 million.\u201d'12\n292. \u00a0If US$16.9 million obtained through a loan by Banco Disa were deducted from the\u00a0foregoing amount, only about US$4 million in tax credits would be left for all other\n169 Counter-Memorial \u00a7 31.\n170 Counter-Memorial \u00a7 247.\n171 Counter-Memorial \u00a7 266, Mirones\u2019 Statements \u00a7 59.\n172 Rejoinder \u00a7 150, Castalia\u2019s Report \u00a7 231.\n54\nCase 8:12-cv-01647-EAK-MAP Document 3-5 Filed 07/24/12 Page 14 of 44 PageID 200\ninvestors in the Copesa Plant. However, Claimants inconsistently allege that they have invested and are entitled to US$8,113,461.38.173\n293. \u00a0Respondent alleges that the whole or otherwise a substantial part of the Plant\u00a0construction was financed by Banco Disa. Respondent points out, however, that said\u00a0financing by Banco Disa cannot be deemed an investment by the bank but a simple\u00a0loan for the purpose of earning interest and transaction fees.174\n294. \u00a0Respondent also affirms that the alleged investments made by Claimants are\u00a0supported by documents whose validity, origin and evidentiary capacity are doubtful,\u00a0such as documents C-37 or C-39t, documents C-8A, C-8B and 26A, and document C38.\n295. \u00a0As far as Nations is concerned, according to Respondent, said company did not make\u00a0investments in COPESA but only purchased stock from previous shareholders.\n296. \u00a0COPESA never recorded the money paid by Nations in its treasury as a capital\u00a0contribution for the realization of a qualified labor, but such money was received by\u00a0the previous shareholders who sold their shareholdings. In any case, the tax credits\u00a0that would belong to the initial shareholders of COPESA could not be transferred to\u00a0Nations.\n297. \u00a0Besides, Respondent alleges that there is also a time factor problem preventing the\u00a0alleged investments of Nations from giving rise to tax credits.\n298. \u00a0Nations acquired the first shares on September 11, 1998, whereas the works in the\u00a0Copesa Plant began on September 4, 1998. Law 28 established that the works were to\u00a0commence no later than the fiscal year following the investment175.\n299. \u00a0The last 100,000 shares in COPESA purchased by Nations were acquired in\u00a0September 1999, i.e., after Law 28 was repealed by Law 20 in June 1999.\n300. \u00a0Besides, the Republic argues that the investments were to be made in cash and\u00a0recorded by the treasury department of the company performing qualified activities.\u00a0The Law failed to include other mechanisms, such as contributions in kind, as they\u00a0were not made through a fund transfer to the company\u2019s treasury and did not fall\u00a0within the definition of the term \u201csecurities\u201d.176 Therefore, the shares other than the\u00a0stock issued for Claimants\u2019 capital contributions in cash would not be entitled to tax\u00a0credits.177\n173 Memorial, \u00a7 59.\n174 Counter-Memorial \u00a7 73, \u00a7 487.\n175 Law 28, Art. 6; Executive Decree 274, Art. 123 f (b).\n176 Counter-Memorial \u00a7 74, Alem\u00e1n\u2019s Report I \u00a7 28.\n177 Alem\u00e1n\u2019s Report I, \u00a7 39.\n55\nCase 8:12-cv-01647-EAK-MAP Document 3-5 Filed 07/24/12 Page 15 of 44 PageID 201\n301. \u00a0Respondent adds that the only evidence that could have proven Claimants\u2019 assertions\u00a0regarding their alleged investments in COPESA are COPESA\u2019s accounting records.\u00a0However, Claimants, clearly challenging the Arbitral Tribunal order contained in\u00a0Procedural Orders n\u00b0 2 and n\u00b04, have refused to produce such records.\n302. \u00a0\u00a0Therefore, Respondent requested the Arbitral Tribunal, pursuant to Procedural Order\u00a0n\u00b0 4, to infer that said accounting records are contrary to Claimants\u2019 interests, and\u00a0particularly requested the Arbitral Tribunal to infer that Claimants failed to produce\u00a0such records because they contain information proving the following: (i) the fact that\u00a0such alleged investments are inexistent as well as such tax credits, (ii) Claimants\u2019\u00a0fault or complicity in the embezzlement of millions of dollars belonging to COPESA\u00a0and the consequent inadmissibility of their claims, (iii) that the value of any\u00a0investments made by Claimants in COPESA had been reduced to nothing before the\u00a0alleged acts of the Republic, and finally, (iv) that Claimants did not base their\u00a0decision to make the alleged investment in COPESA on the right to be awarded or to\u00a0transfer tax credits.178\n303. \u00a0\u00a0In addition, Respondent affirms that assuming, for the sake of argument, that\u00a0Claimants had invested in COPESA and that such investments had entitled them to\u00a0tax credits, Claimants missed the chance to use such credits as they depreciated\u00a0COPESA\u2019s assets,179 since under Section 123(g), Executive Decree 274 and\u00a0Paragraph 4, Article 702(d,) Tax Code, asset depreciation is incompatible with tax\u00a0credits.\n304. \u00a0Finally, Respondent argues that assuming that Claimants had been entitled to\u00a0recognized tax credits, such credits would have been annulled by operation of Law 6\u00a0dated February 2, 2005, as, under said law, taxpayers had the obligation to notify the\u00a0GDR of the amount of tax credits to which they claimed to be entitled within a term\u00a0of 180 days and also stated that the failure to give notice would extinguish the right to\u00a0such credits. However, Claimants did not comply with this obligation, either; thus,\u00a0any right to which they might have been entitled to is deemed extinguished under\u00a0Law 6 enacted in 2005.180\n(e) The Specific Conditions Imposed by the Law Regarding\u00a0Indirect Investments Prevent COPESA from Issuing Bonds\u00a0Carrying Tax Credits.\n305. \u00a0\u00a0Respondent argues that under the applicable laws,181 the qualified activity was to\u00a0commence within the first fiscal year following the investment, so this provision\u00a0prevents a bond issue planned in 2005 from carrying tax credits.182\n178 Rejoinder, \u00a7 426 et seq.\n179 Counter-Memorial \u00a7 85, \u00a7 476 et seq., Alem\u00e1n\u2019s Report I \u00a7 79, Rejoinder \u00a7 98 et seq.\n180 Counter-Memorial, \u00a7 91, \u00a7 482 and \u00a7 518; Alem\u00e1n\u2019s Report I, \u00a7 97 et seq.', Rejoinder, \u00a7 200, Respondent\u2019s,\u00a0PHM\u00a731.\n181 Art. 702(b), Paragraph 3, Tax Code and Art. 123f (b), Executive Decree 274.\n56\nCase 8:12-cv-01647-EAK-MAP Document 3-5 Filed 07/24/12 Page 16 of 44 PageID 202\n306. According to Respondent, the credits to which COPESA may have been eventually\u00a0entitled, as it was COPESA who made the direct investment in the Copesa Plant,\u00a0could not be restructured as indirect investment credits held by Banco Disa or\u00a0Claimants.\n307. \u00a0\u00a0Indeed, an investment is classified as direct or indirect when such investment is made,\u00a0and could not be altered or reclassified later as this possibility was not provided for\u00a0by the law183.\n308. \u00a0\u00a0Should the reclassification of credits proposed by Claimants be allowed, the\u00a0distinction between direct and indirect investments, as well as the express prohibition\u00a0to transfer the credits, would make no sense.184\n309.\n  \nTax credits for indirect investments could not be transferred. Indeed, Article 702(d), Paragraph 1, Tax Code, as amended by Law 28, expressly prohibited the transfer of\u00a0credits.185\n310. \u00a0\u00a0Therefore, the tax credits for a direct investment in COPESA resulting from the\u00a0Banco Disa loan were not transferable to Claimants, or any other third party by way\u00a0of a bond or stock issue.\n311. \u00a0\u00a0According to Respondent, indirect investment credits could not be transferred, either.\u00a0Respondent argues, in this regard, that Claimants\u2019 argument supporting the\u00a0transferability of tax credits, i.e., that the purpose of Law 28 was to attract foreign\u00a0investments and credit transferability was consistent with such purpose, may not be\u00a0admitted. Said argument is based on an erroneous premise because the purpose of\u00a0Law 28 was not to attract foreign investments. Evidence shows that at the time the\u00a0law was enacted, private investments in power generation companies were not even\u00a0allowed.186\n312. \u00a0Respondent also affirms that Law 20 enacted in 1999 repealed Article 6 of Law 28,\u00a0and as from such date it is no longer possible to claim recognition of tax credits for\u00a0direct or indirect investments made subsequent to June 28, 1999187.\n313. \u00a0Although Law 54 secured legal stability for a term of 10 years, said provision\u00a0required the registration of investors in order to be protected under the law. However,\u00a0Claimants have never registered themselves with the Investments registry, only\u00a0COPESA did; but COPESA is not a party to the arbitration proceeding, nor may it be,\n182 Rejoinder \u00a7 105 et. seq.\n183 Counter-Memorial \u00a7 83, \u00a7 484.\n184 Rejoinder \u00a7 122.\n185 Counter-Memorial \u00a7 84, \u00a7483; Alem\u00e1n\u2019s Report I \u00a7 88.\n186 Alem\u00e1n\u2019s Report II, \u00a714.\n187 Counter-Memorial \u00a7 87. \u00a7 1 Act 20 (RAL-99).\n57\nCase 8:12-cv-01647-EAK-MAP Document 3-5 Filed 07/24/12 Page 17 of 44 PageID 203\nsince it is not protected under the BIT. Therefore, Claimants cannot claim rights pertaining to COPESA, or allege that they are one and the same person188.\n314. \u00a0Besides, Respondent adds that Law 54 only guaranteed the stability of the applicable\u00a0laws at the time the investments were registered.\n315. \u00a0In this^ regard, the investments by COPESA were registered on September 14,\u00a01999, while Section 6, Law 28 had already been repealed by Law 20 enacted in\u00a0June 1999.190\n316. \u00a0Thus, the investment in COPESA was not covered by the stability system provided\u00a0for by Law 54.191\n(f) The Alleged Tax Credits Could not be Transferred Through the\u00a0Sale of Stock, Either.\n317. \u00a0As regards a hypothetical sale of COPESA\u2019s original stock, Respondent holds that the\u00a0alleged tax credits could not be transferred to the purchasers of such stock.192\n318. \u00a0\u00a0In connection with the foregoing, Respondent affirms that, in 2005, no construction\u00a0project qualified under Law 28 was planned through funding to be derived from the\u00a0sale of stock. Thus, the purchasers of stock could not have been entitled to the\u00a0alleged credits.\n319. \u00a0Besides, the proceeds of such sale would not be received by COPESA\u2019s treasury but\u00a0such sale would only constitute a transfer of assets between shareholders and\u00a0purchasers of stock.\n2-2 With regard to the International Obligations of a State\n320. \u00a0\u00a0The Republic argues that it has not breached its international obligations given that:\u00a0(a) there was no expropriation whatsoever, and (b) the other claims under the BIT\u00a0must be dismissed given that this case refers to a taxation matter.\na- No Expropriation has Taken Place.\n321. \u00a0The Republic asserts that the alleged value of Claimants\u2019 investment in COPESA had\u00a0been depleted before Respondent took any action, as it has been acknowledged by\u00a0Claimants, while only investments with a recognizable value can be subject to\u00a0expropriation.\n188 Counter-Memorial \u00a7 67.\n,89C-14.\n190 Law 20 enacted in 1999 (RAL-100).\n191 Counter-Memorial \u00a7 103.\n192 Counter-Memorial \u00a7 515 et seq.\n58\nCase 8:12-cv-01647-EAK-MAP Document 3-5 Filed 07/24/12 Page 18 of 44 PageID 204\n322. \u00a0\u00a0Therefore, there is no causative relation between the alleged acts of Respondent and\u00a0the devaluation of Claimants\u2019 investment. In fact, Claimants themselves devalued\u00a0COPESA and their investments in it.\n323. \u00a0\u00a0Panama alleges that it has not deprived Claimants of any fundamental property right\u00a0associated to their investments. Respondent never interfered with Claimants\u2019\u00a0ownership of COPESA or any related rights.\n324. \u00a0\u00a0With regard to Claimants\u2019 allegation that their investment consisted in their right to\u00a0indirect investment tax credits, Respondent asserts that it is inadmissible. And\u00a0anyway, neither the 2004 GDR opinion, nor the relevant legal authorities, provided\u00a0Claimants with a legitimate expectation of tax credits.\n325. \u00a0\u00a0In addition, Claimants have failed to prove that neither they, nor COPESA, nor Banco\u00a0Disa had considered, at the time of making the investment, that they could be entitled\u00a0to tax credits under Law 28. They never made any reference to the credits in their\u00a0negotiations and financing agreements executed for the construction of the Copesa\u00a0Plant.193\n326. \u00a0Respondent asserts that State regulatory measures may normally impose restrictions\u00a0or hindrances to companies, though for the hindrance to have an effect equal to an\u00a0expropriation, it must be \u201cserious enough so as to: 1) substantially devaluate the\u00a0investment, or 2) substantially deprive the investor of its fundamental property rights\u00a0over the investment, such as ownership and control.\u201d\u2122\n327. \u00a0\u00a0Respondent affirms that it never denied or granted tax credits to Claimants, so they\u00a0cannot rely on the deprivation of a right that has never been duly requested by\u00a0Claimants, or denied by Panama.195\n328. \u00a0\u00a0Respondent also affirms that Claimants had no right to any tax credit whatsoever, as\u00a0they were not in compliance with the relevant statutory requirements. Thus the State\u00a0was not able to expropriate something that was never owned by Claimants.196\n329. \u00a0\u00a0In connection with Claimants\u2019 legitimate expectation of being entitled to tax credits\u00a0and their transfer, Respondent alleges that legitimate expectations are subject to two\u00a0requirements, namely: (i) a time requirement: they must have existed at the time\u00a0Claimant made the investment, and (ii) a scope requirement: the expectation must be\u00a0based on solid grounds. In this case, neither of these requirements has been met.197\n193 Counter-Memorial \u00a7 106 etseq., R-16, R-17, R-21.\n194 Counter-Memorial \u00a7 574.\n195 Counter-Memorial, \u00a7 534, \u00a7 588.\n196 Rejoinder, \u00a7 235 et seq.\n197 Rejoinder \u00a7 237 et seq.\n59\nCase 8:12-cv-01647-EAK-MAP Document 3-5 Filed 07/24/12 Page 19 of 44 PageID 205\n330. \u00a0Respondent asserts that Claimants have failed to prove that they have made the\u00a0alleged investments in COPESA for the purpose of being entitled to tax credits,\u00a0neither are there any indications that Claimants had considered this possibility before\u00a02002, where the then president of COPESA, Victor Berrio, conceived this alternative\u00a0to obtain financial resources. In fact, in the financial statements of COPESA, no\u00a0reference is made to tax credits until 2002.198\n331. \u00a0As far as the scope requirement is concerned, Respondent argues that legitimate\u00a0expectations must be based on governmental unequivocal and specific statements or\u00a0warranties made prior to the investment. In this case, no such representations or\u00a0warranties have been made.\n332. \u00a0\u00a0The 2004 opinion, apart from being prior to the alleged investments, was not binding\u00a0but merely advisory and did not state what is being claimed by Claimants. Claimants\u00a0base their claims solely in their personal interpretation of Panamanian laws, which\u00a0was also a posteriori, as there is no evidence of the fact that Claimants had analyzed\u00a0these circumstances before making the alleged investments.\n333. \u00a0For all of the foregoing, Claimants may not allege that they have a legitimate\u00a0expectation on the referenced tax credits.\nb. Other Claims under the BIT\n334. \u00a0\u00a0Respondent asserts that the Arbitral Tribunal lacks jurisdiction to hear such claims, as\u00a0this case is a taxation matter, which must be limited to the exceptions set forth in\u00a0Article XI.2 of the BIT.199 Respondent also states that the Arbitral Tribunal should\u00a0not consider these claims as Claimants have relinquished such claims by clearly\u00a0stating that \u201cthe only matters to be decided by the Tribunal in this arbitration\u00a0proceeding [...] are, as follows (1) if Claimants have made an investment entitled to a\u00a0tax credit and (2) if Respondent\u2019s actions constitute an indirect expropriation of\u00a0Claimants \u2019 investment.... \u201d200\n335. \u00a0In any event, Respondent affirms that the other claims must be dismissed for lack of\u00a0grounds as the Republic did not breach its obligations under Article II.2 of the BIT.\n336. \u00a0\u00a0Below are Panama\u2019s replies to Claimants\u2019 allegations on the obligation to: (b.a.)\u00a0provide a fair and equitable treatment, (b.b.) provide full protection and security to\u00a0investments, and (b.c.) refrain from taking arbitrary and discriminatory actions.\nb.a. Fair and Equitable Treatment\n337. \u00a0\u00a0Claimants found this claim on two grounds: (i) Claimants\u2019 legitimate expectations of\u00a0obtaining, keeping and transferring tax credits, and (ii) the fact that the acts of the\n198 Rejoinder \u00a7 110,R-224.\n199 Rejoinder, \u00a7 248.\n200 Reply, \u00a7 1.\n60\nCase 8:12-cv-01647-EAK-MAP Document 3-5 Filed 07/24/12 Page 20 of 44 PageID 206\nRepublic compromised the stability of the investment climate protected by the duty standard of fair and equitable treatment.\n338. \u00a0\u00a0With regard to the legitimate expectations, Respondent refers to Respondent\u2019s\u00a0statements above concluding that this claim cannot be admitted and adding that the\u00a0issue in this case is a simple discrepancy regarding the application of a domestic law\u00a0which cannot be resolved through remedies of international law.\n339. \u00a0\u00a0Regarding the stability of the investment climate, Respondent affirms that it has not\u00a0modified the regulatory framework of tax credits in any way whatsoever.\n340. \u00a0Indeed, the law reserves this benefit for investors who meet certain requirements and\u00a0also establishes that credits are not transferable.\n341. \u00a0Respondent adds that the obligation to maintain a stable investment climate is not\u00a0absolute and general but may only be invoked where there is an express and specific\u00a0obligation limiting this State power.\n342. \u00a0\u00a0Respondent states in this regard that, unless discrimination or serious misconduct is\u00a0evidenced, a modification of an informal and non-binding opinion issued by a State\u00a0on complex matters, such as matters of taxation, cannot be admitted as constituting\u00a0unfair or equitable treatment.201\n343. \u00a0\u00a0Finally, the Republic argues that, with regard to taxation matters, discretional powers\u00a0are granted and recognized to a State, as they are matters closely related to\u00a0sovereignty.202\nb.b. Full Protection and Security of Investments\n344. \u00a0\u00a0The Republic states that it never breached its duty and that, in any case, the claim\u00a0brought by Claimants is groundless and must therefore be dismissed by this Arbitral\u00a0Tribunal.\n345. \u00a0\u00a0Respondent argues, in any case, that the reasons that might give rise to a claim of this\u00a0kind, such as a State\u2019s failure to provide police or judicial protection to the assets of\u00a0the foreign investor, have neither occurred nor been alleged by Claimants in this case.\n346. \u00a0Likewise, a potential broader interpretation of said obligation under the BIT imposing\u00a0a \u201cwarranty of legal certainty\u201d must be denied, as this extraordinary application has\u00a0not been requested by Claimants. Besides, according to case law it should only be\u00a0admitted where the conduct of a State was \"absolutely unreasonable and\u00a0unjustifiable regarding a rational legal policy\u201d,203 while Panama had justified and\n201 Counter-Memorial \u00a7 614.\n202 Counter-Memorial, \u00a7 437 et seq.; \u00a7 615 et seq.\n203 Counter-Memorial \u00a7 630, Footnote No. 858 citing the Award Saluka v.

Prohibition on Arbitrary and Discriminatory\nMeasures\n348. \u00a0Finally, Respondent denies having breached the prohibition to take arbitrary and\u00a0discriminatory measures. Respondent holds that Claimants have brought this claim\u00a0without any supporting arguments, or case law. Therefore, the claim must be\u00a0deemed as an abandoned claim.\nIn any case, Respondent argues that its conduct was not arbitrary or discriminatory. The GDR acted on the basis of legitimate and adequate reasons when it issued its\u00a0January 29, 2005 opinion, which was not based on prejudiced or discriminatory\u00a0attempts.\nc. Damages claimed by Claimants\nRespondent rejects the compensation for damages sought by Claimants on the following grounds: (c.a.) the alleged damages have not been assessed or justified,\u00a0(c.b.) nor has the causative relation between the acts of the Republic and the alleged\u00a0damages been assessed, and (c.c.) in any case, the claims brought by Claimants are\u00a0groundless and economically and financially illogical.\nc.a. Assessment and Proof of Damages\nRespondent asserts that Claimants have not complied with the burden of proving the alleged damages.\n352. \u00a0\u00a0In this regard, document C-37 is insufficient, as it is not a damages assessment report\u00a0as initially alleged by Claimants. Additionally, its content is not intended to prove\u00a0Claimants\u2019 allegations. Finally, the table on damages attached thereto was not\u00a0prepared by Deloitte but by Victor Berrio, who is COPESA\u2019s president.\n353. \u00a0Respondent also stated that the economic value of Claimants\u2019 share in COPESA has\u00a0significantly increased since the date of the planned sale. Thus, it has not been\u00a0proven that Claimants\u2019 position is now worse than in 2005 when the planned sale\u00a0would have taken place.\nc.b. Causality\n354. The Republic argues that COPESA was declared bankrupt as a result of the actions\u00a0by some Lending Banks, who had been COPESA\u2019s creditors for over 6 years, rather\u00a0than any act of Panama.\n62\nCase 8:12-cv-01647-EAK-MAP Document 3-5 Filed 07/24/12 Page 22 of 44 PageID 208\n355. \u00a0\u00a0The real causes of COPESA\u2019s bankruptcy were: (i) the internal conflicts affecting it\nsince its inception, and (ii) the careless and fraudulent management of the company by its officers.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0J\n356. \u00a0According to Respondent, the incompetent and dishonest management by Claimants\u00a0was the main cause of COPESA\u2019s bankruptcy. This is evidenced by the fact that\u00a0from the date when bankruptcy was declared - i.e., while COPESA was managed by\u00a0the Trustee in bankruptcy and was not under Claimants\u2019 control - the company not\u00a0only covered its management and operational expenses, but registered the highest\u00a0income since its foundation.204\n357. \u00a0Respondent also states that COPESA\u2019s fraudulent bankruptcy was established by the\u00a0forensic auditor, Juan Iv\u00e1n Rogers Harper, in a report requested by the Trustee in\u00a0bankruptcy .\n358. \u00a0In this regard, Respondent alleges that Claimants used a company named Del Mar to\u00a0hide the unlawful management of COPESA, by purchasing the credit of the Lending\u00a0Banks. In light of the fact that Claimants failed to produce the documents related to\u00a0Del Mar in smte of the Tribunal\u2019s order, Respondent considers that said documents\u00a0would prove that Claimants are related to Del Mar, and/or are shareholders thereof,\u00a0and/or have a controlling interest in Del Mar, and were directly involved in the loan\u00a0assignment by the Lending Banks to Del Mar, and are currently creditors of COPESA\u00a0through Del Mar.\n359. \u00a0\u00a0The documents related to Del Mar would also prove that Claimants not only retained\u00a0their shareholdings in COPESA and control COPESA since bankruptcy proceedings\u00a0were abandoned, but also own the rights to receive COPESA\u2019s bank credits. Thus,\u00a0their claims for damages in this arbitration proceeding are absolutely groundless. \u2019\n360. \u00a0\u00a0Thus, Respondent asserts that its alleged acts could not have led COPESA to such a\u00a0severe financial position, and stock devaluation.\n361. \u00a0Finally, Respondent points out that Nations has already claimed damages in two\u00a0different proceedings before the Panamaman courts for the same losses against other\u00a0individuals and entities. Thus, by application of the doctrine of estoppel, such claims\u00a0may not be brought to this arbitration proceeding.207\n204 Counter-Memorial \u00a7 35.\n205 Rogers Harper\u2019s Report I \u00a7 19-20.\n206 Rejoinder, \u00a7 426.\n207 Rejoinder, \u00a7 343 etseq.; R-101 and R-131.\n63\nCase 8:12-cv-01647-EAK-MAP Document 3-5 Filed 07/24/12 Page 23 of 44 PageID 209\nc.c. Logical and Financial Inconsistency of the\nAlleged Damages\n362. \u00a0\u00a0Respondent states that, in any case, the potential investment in the Copesa Plant that\u00a0could eventually have given rise to tax credits for investment for all shareholders, and\u00a0not only Claimants, is reduced to roughly US$4 million. However, Claimants\u00a0requested in their First Memorial damages for US$42 million associated to the loss\u00a0of tax credits, plus US$20 million as a consequence of COPESA\u2019s bankruptcy,\u00a0totaling the \u201cexorbitant sum of US$62,163,551.91. -\u2122\n363. \u00a0Respondent also points out that, even if the foregoing was ignored, Claimants have\u00a0unduly kept multiple accounting records. They requested the same relief under\u00a0different circumstances, i.e., the value of their COPESA stock and the alleged book\u00a0value of such stock.209\n364. \u00a0\u00a0Respondent also affirms that, even if it was admitted that Claimants are entitled to\u00a0any indirect investment tax credits, they have not adequately proven that there is a\u00a0market demand for the credits. On the contrary, the documents produced by\u00a0Claimants, apart from having a doubtful evidentiaiy value, state the lack of demand\u00a0on the market.210\n365. \u00a0\u00a0In addition, Respondent affirms that, in the table of damages filed by Claimants,\u00a0some categories of damages are not at all related with COPESA\u2019s sale of stock or\u00a0bond issue and the alleged tax credits. Said categories are Items 1-4, 10 and 13 of the\u00a0table attached to document C-37.\n366. \u00a0Respondent argues that the claim for the sums associated with COPESA\u2019s\u00a0bankruptcy, apart from being groundless and lacking the relevant causality with\u00a0Panama\u2019s acts, are based on a wrong view and are illogical. Claimants expect to\u00a0obtain all the alleged income and benefits that COPESA would have earned. The\u00a0foregoing would result in undue and fraudulent embezzlement because should\u00a0Claimants\u2019 calculations and arguments be correct, COPESA, rather than some of its\u00a0shareholders, would be entitled to such amounts.211\n367. \u00a0\u00a0Finally, the Republic argues that, after COPESA\u2019s discharge from bankruptcy,\u00a0Claimants have recovered all their rights related to their shares.\n368. \u00a0For the foregoing reasons, the Respondent requests the Arbitral Tribunal to dismiss\u00a0any and all claims for damages brought by Claimants, as they are groundless and\u00a0inappropriate.\n208 Counter-Memorial, \u00a789.\n209 Rejoinder, \u00a7 345 et seq.; Castalia\u2019s Report \u00a7194.\n2,0 Rejoinder \u00a7 370 et seq.\n211 Rejoinder, \u00a7 387.\n64\nCase 8:12-cv-01647-EAK-MAP Document 3-5 Filed 07/24/12 Page 24 of 44 PageID 210\nVI.

Subsequently, (C) the Tribunal shall address the claim\u00a0entered by the Republic in connection with damages for abuse of process, and (D) the\u00a0parties\u2019 claims as to the costs of the proceeding.\nC. Jurisdiction of the Arbitral Tribunal\n373. \u00a0\u00a0Firstly, the Arbitral Tribunal shall address (1) the arguments in connection with its\u00a0jurisdiction ratione personae, and then (2) the arguments in connection with its\u00a0jurisdiction ratione materiae.\n3. Jurisdiction Ratione Personae\n374. \u00a0\u00a0Respondent has objected to the jurisdiction ratione personae of the Arbitral\u00a0Tribunal with regard to (a) Jurado, (b) EME, and (c) Nations. As explained below,\u00a0none of these objections are grounded.\na. With regard to Jurado\n375. \u00a0\u00a0Basically, Respondent asserts that (a.a.) Jurado would hold dual citizenship,\u00a0American and Panamanian, since when he became a U.S. citizen in 1954 he failed to\u00a0perfect his waiver of Panamanian nationality. Furthermore, Respondent asserts that\u00a0(a.b.) even if Jurado had constructively waived his Panamanian nationality upon\u00a0becoming a U.S. citizen, Jurado automatically reacquired it when the 1972\u00a0Constitution of Panama came into effect. Respondent also contends that (a.c.) in the\u00a0event that Jurado had not automatically reacquired his Panamanian nationality in\u00a01972, he did reacquire it when he applied for, and obtained, a Panamanian identity\u00a0document in 1978, and used his Panamanian nationality to grant powers to third\u00a0parties before public officers. Lastly, (a.d.) Respondent holds that Jurado may not,\u00a0without breaching the principle of good faith, pretend that he does not have\u00a0Panamanian nationality.\n376. \u00a0First of all, we should remember that Article 25.2(a) of the ICSID Convention\u00a0establishes that \"in no event \u201d should the concept of \u201cNational of another Contracting\u00a0State, \u201d in terms of Article 25 of the ICSID Convention, include any person who, on\u00a0the date on which the parties consented to submit the dispute to arbitration as well as\u00a0on the date on which the request was registered, also had the nationality of the\u00a0Contracting State party to the dispute.\n66\nCase 8:12-cv-01647-EAK-MAP Document 3-5 Filed 07/24/12 Page 26 of 44 PageID 212\n377. \u00a0Based on said rule, the jurisdiction of the Arbitral Tribunal would be precluded with\u00a0respect to Jurado, had Jurado been a Panamanian national on the dates referred to in\u00a0Article 25.2(a).\n378. \u00a0\u00a0With regard to the rules to determine nationality, under international law it is\u00a0generally accepted that the conditions of acquisition and loss of nationality are\u00a0subject to domestic law.214\n379. \u00a0\u00a0This rule is reflected in Article I a) of the BIT, under which a \u201cnational of a Party\u00a0means a natural person who is a national or citizen of that Party under its laws\u201d.\na.a. Did Jurado Lose his Panamanian Nationality upon Becoming a U.S. Citizen in 1954?\n380. \u00a0\u00a0The parties do not argue the fact that Jurado was bom in Panama, thus being\u00a0Panamanian by birth.215\n381. \u00a0\u00a0Nor is it argued that Jurado became a U.S. citizen in 1954.216\n382. \u00a0\u00a0Jurado maintains that, based on the Panamanian Constitution of 1946 in effect at that\u00a0time, the acquisition automatically implied a waiver of his Panamanian nationality.\u00a0Respondent, on the contrary, asserts that the waiver was not perfected due to the lack\u00a0of a decision issued by the Supreme Tribunal of Panama in this regard.\n383. \u00a0The relevant rule here is Article 15 of the Panamanian Constitution of 1946, pursuant\u00a0to which:\n\u201cOnce acquired, Panamanian nationality may only be lost upon an express or constructive waiver.\nNationality is expressly waived upon notification in writing given by the individual to the Executive, of their intention to renounce Panamanian\u00a0nationality.\nNationality is constructively waived:\n1. Upon acquisition of a foreign nationality;\n2. \u00a0Upon acceptance of an employment offer by another Government without\u00a0first obtaining permission from the Executive, unless such employment involves\u00a0work in which the Republic holds a joint interest with another nation; and\n3. Upon rendering services to an enemy State.\nNationality may only be regained upon reinstatement by the National Assembly. \u201d\n2,4 Soufraki v. The United Arab Emirates, ICSID Case No. ARB/02/07, \u00a7 55.\n215 Hearing Transcripts, p. 161: 16.\n2,6 Hearing Transcripts, p. 164: 18 etseq.\n67\nCase 8:12-cv-01647-EAK-MAP Document 3-5 Filed 07/24/12 Page 27 of 44 PageID 213\n384. \u00a0\u00a0Based on Article 15.1 of the 1946 Constitution, Jurado constructively waived his\u00a0Panamanian nationality upon becoming a U.S. citizen, and the 1946 Constitution does\u00a0not set forth any requirements for the perfection of a constructive waiver of\u00a0nationality.\n385. \u00a0However, Respondent contends that the requirement of a judicial decision declaring\u00a0the loss of nationality is expressly commanded by law under Article 2.358 and\u00a0Article 2.359, Judicial Code, Article 20(11), Law 60 of 1946, Article 137,\u00a0Administrative Code, and Article 320, Civil Code.217\n386. \u00a0\u00a0The Arbitral Tribunal believes that the rules do not constitute grounds for the theory\u00a0put forth by Respondent.\n387. \u00a0\u00a0Indeed, the Constitution prevails over lower ranking rules. To such effect, Article 257\u00a0establishes that any laws contrary to the Constitution shall be void, and that only\u00a0those which are not contrary to the Constitution shall remain in effect. Therefore, the\u00a0Arbitral Tribunal considers that the rules referred to by Respondent may not\u00a0contradict the clear and unambiguous meaning of Article 15 of the Panamanian\u00a0Constitution, which has, by itself, direct efficacy and does not need any assistance\u00a0from the law.\n388. \u00a0\u00a0Article 15 clearly establishes a distinction between express and constructive waiver,\u00a0only an express waiver requires a written statement by the waiving party. Therefore,\u00a0Article 15 necessarily sets forth that constructive waivers are not required to be in\u00a0writing, as it is logical and may be inferred by the very meaning of the word\u00a0\u201cconstructive\u201d. Consequently, a constructive waiver is perfected without the waiving\u00a0party having to institute any administrative or court proceedings to that effect. The\u00a0interpretation proposed by Claimants implies subjecting constructive waiver to a legal\u00a0declaration requirement, thus eliminating the distinction between constructive waiver\u00a0and express waiver.\n389. \u00a0\u00a0Therefore, the Arbitral Tribunal considers that the rules invoked by Respondent\u00a0should be interpreted consistently with the Constitution and, for that reason, may not\u00a0be applicable to a constructive waiver due to the acquisition of another nationality, as\u00a0set forth by Article 15.1 of the 1946 Constitution. In this regard, the Arbitral Tribunal\u00a0noted that the judicial decisions quoted by Respondent218 make no reference to\u00a0Article 15.1 of the 1946 Constitution, and that Law 137 and Law 138 do not refer to\u00a0the hypothesis proposed by Respondent.\n390. \u00a0\u00a0Therefore, it is the opinion of the Arbitral Tribunal that Jurado automatically lost his\u00a0Panamanian nationality upon becoming a U.S. citizen, by virtue of the application of\u00a0the constructive waiver set forth in Article 15.1 of the 1946 Constitution.\n2,7 Respondent\u2019s PHM, \u00a711.\n218 Respondent\u2019s PHM, Footnote 18.\n68\nCase 8:12-cv-01647-EAK-MAP Document 3-5 Filed 07/24/12 Page 28 of 44 PageID 214\na.b. Did Jurado Automatically Reacquire his Panamanian Nationality upon the 1972\u00a0Constitution Coming into Effect?\n391. \u00a0According to the theory proposed by Respondent, when the new Panamanian\u00a0Constitution of 1972 came into effect, Jurado reacquired his Panamanian nationality\u00a0by operation of law, due to the immediate and future application of Article 13 thereof.\n392. \u00a0Article 13 of the 1972 Constitution establishes that \u201cPanamanian nationality of\u00a0origin or acquired at birth may not be lost, but the express or constructive waiver\u00a0thereof shall cause citizenship to be suspended.\u201d\n393. \u00a0\u00a0Since Jurado had already lost his Panamanian nationality upon the 1972 Constitution\u00a0coming into effect, the Arbitral Tribunal believes that this rule could not have\u00a0automatically granted such nationality.\n394. \u00a0\u00a0In this regard, the parties agree that the constitutional rule may not be retroactively\u00a0applied.219 Jurado\u2019s nationality is a substantive right governed by the provisions in\u00a0effect at the time of acquisition, or loss, thereof. To think otherwise would imply\u00a0accepting a lack of legal certainty in rights related to the nationality of individuals.\na.c. Did the Circumstances of Applying For and Obtaining an Identity Document, and Using His\u00a0Panamanian Nationality to Grant Powers to\u00a0Third Parties Result in a Reacquisition of His\u00a0Panamanian Nationality?\n395. \u00a0Neither does the Arbitral Tribunal deem acceptable Respondent\u2019s theory whereby the\u00a0fact that Jurado applied for and obtained a Panamanian identity document, and used it\u00a0to grant powers to third parties before public officers, would result in attributing the\u00a0Panamanian nationality to Jurado.\n396. \u00a0The parties do not argue the fact that Jurado applied for and obtained Panamanian\u00a0identity document n\u00b0 8-78-742 in 1978.\n397. \u00a0\u00a0Neither is there a dispute over the fact that said identity document is a type of\u00a0document granted to Panamanian nationals only, and it may not be granted to foreign\u00a0individuals (whose ID numbers are preceded by the letter \u2018E\u2019).\n398. \u00a0Finally, it has been proven that on two occasions (on August 20, 1993 and on\u00a0September 21, 1993) Jurado appeared before public officers to grant powers to third\u00a0parties, and on both occasions he presented his Panamanian identity document for\u00a0identification purposes.\n219 Respondent\u2019s PHM, \u00a710\n69\nCase 8:12-cv-01647-EAK-MAP Document 3-5 Filed 07/24/12 Page 29 of 44 PageID 215\n399. \u00a0However, the Arbitral Tribunal believes that the circumstances may not substitute the\u00a0procedure established by the Constitution, and are not sufficient to grant Jurado\u00a0Panamanian nationality since it is also possible that the identity document may have\u00a0been granted irregularly, by mistake, or based on wrong information.220 In addition,\u00a0as already explained, Panamanian authorities did not formally declare Jurado\u2019s loss of\u00a0Panamanian nationality. Thus he could physically present himself as a national of\u00a0Panama. However, since he lost his Panamanian nationality when he became a U.S.\u00a0citizen, presenting himself as Panamanian is only a question of fact and not a legal\u00a0circumstance that grants any rights, which is the relevant part to this proceeding.\n400. \u00a0Having lost his Panamanian nationality in 1954, when he applied for, and obtained,\u00a0an identity document, Jurado held an alien status. Therefore, in order to acquire\u00a0Panamanian nationality he had to fulfill the legal and constitutional requirements\u00a0applicable to foreign individuals for naturalization purposes.\n401. \u00a0\u00a0Said requirements are set forth in Article 10 of the 1972 Constitution, which reads as\u00a0follows:\nThe following individuals may apply for Panamanian nationality via naturalization:\n1. \u00a0Foreign individuals who have resided in the territory of the Republic for 5\u00a0consecutive years, if, upon coming of age, they declare their intention to be\u00a0naturalized, waive their nationality of origin or any other nationality they may\u00a0hold, and prove that they speak the Spanish language and have general\u00a0knowledge of Panamanian geography, history and political organization.\n2. \u00a0Foreign individuals who have resided in the territory of the Republic for 3\u00a0consecutive years, and have children that were born in said territory whose\u00a0mother or father is Panamanian, or have a spouse of Panamanian nationality, if\u00a0they make the declaration and submit the evidence stated in the above\u00a0paragraph.\n3. Nationals of Spain or any Latin American country by birth, if they comply\u00a0with the same requirements applicable in their country of origin to\u00a0Panamanian individuals, for naturalization purposes. \u201d\n402. The parties agree that Jurado did not apply for naturalization pursuant to such rule\u00a0and, therefore, cannot have acquired Panamanian nationality under the 1972\u00a0Constitution. It has not been proven either that he acquired it at any time under the\u00a0successive 2004 Constitution, or to date.\nAs properly asserted by Claimants based on the Soufraki award (Objections to the Request for Bifurcation, \u00a7 28), the Arbitral Tribunal has the power to decide on Jurado\u2019s nationality even if Jurado has been granted a \u2019\u00a0Panamanian identity document.\n70\nCase 8:12-cv-01647-EAK-MAP Document 3-5 Filed 07/24/12 Page 30 of 44 PageID 216\n403. \u00a0In view of the foregoing, the Arbitral Tribunal concludes that Jurado lost his\u00a0Panamanian nationality in 1954 and did not subsequently reacquire it. Therefore,\u00a0Jurado ceased to be a Panamanian national in 1954. This date is prior to the date of\u00a0the BIT, the date of the investment and the request for arbitration.\n404. \u00a0\u00a0Jurado did not hold double nationality in terms of Article 25.1.2(a) of the ICSID\u00a0Convention on any of the relevant dates. Therefore, the Arbitral Tribunal declares it\u00a0has jurisdiction ratione personae with regard to Respondent Jurado.\n405. \u00a0\u00a0Consequently, it shall not be necessary to rule on the effective nationality theory\u00a0presented by Claimants.\na. d.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On the Principle of Good Faith and Estoppel\n406. \u00a0\u00a0Lastly, Respondent\u2019s objection to the jurisdiction of the Arbitral Tribunal based on\u00a0the principle of good faith and estoppel is also unfounded.\n407. \u00a0\u00a0In this regard, Respondent asserts that Jurado cannot, in good faith, allege in this\u00a0proceeding that he does not hold Panamanian nationality, when he has taken\u00a0advantage of it whenever it has been convenient.221\n408. \u00a0\u00a0The theory must be rejected. First, Respondent failed to prove that Jurado acted in\u00a0bad faith, since he did not need to hold Panamanian nationality to grant powers to\u00a0Messrs. Berrios Herrera and Berrio Anderson. In addition, good faith is a question of\u00a0merit and may not be valued as a condition of jurisdiction of the Arbitral Tribunal. In\u00a0order to assess whether Jurado acted in good faith, the Arbitral Tribunal must have\u00a0jurisdiction. However, as explained below, the Arbitral Tribunal need not address\u00a0this issue since the claims shall be entirely dismissed on the merits.\n409. \u00a0\u00a0The Tribunal has already determined that Jurado lost his Panamanian nationality and\u00a0is a national of the United States. Whether Jurado acted in bad faith in connection\u00a0with his nationality in other businesses is a matter unconnected with the Arbitral\u00a0Tribunal\u2019s decision on Jurado\u2019s nationality for the purpose of determining the\u00a0Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction in the proceeding. Moreover, as already determined,\u00a0presenting himself as a Panamanian national gave Jurado no right to reacquire\u00a0Panamanian nationality.\nb. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0With Regard to EME\n410. \u00a0Respondent holds that the Arbitral Tribunal lacks jurisdiction with regard to EME,\u00a0because EME transferred all of its rights and interests in COPESA to Jurado in\u00a02000.222\n221 Rejoinder, \u00a7 42.\n222 Respondent\u2019s PHM, \u00a7 17.\n71\nCase 8:12-cv-01647-EAK-MAP Document 3-5 Filed 07/24/12 Page 31 of 44 PageID 217\n411. \u00a0\u00a0On the contrary, Claimants assert that EME is still the owner of COPESA\u2019s original\u00a0shares of stock, and thus EME still has legal standing to act as claimant in this\u00a0arbitration.\n412. \u00a0\u00a0The parties agree on the fact that on or around April 1, 2000 EME and Jurado entered\u00a0into an agreement whereby EME\u2019s ownership interest and rights in COPESA were\u00a0transferred to Jurado.223\n413. \u00a0However, the Arbitral Tribunal deems the issue raised by Respondent to be an issue\u00a0of admissibility, and not of jurisdiction. It is undisputed that EME is a corporation\u00a0constituted under the laws of the United States. Therefore, to the extent that it\u00a0complies with the requirements set forth in the ICSID Convention and the BIT, the\u00a0Arbitral Tribunal has jurisdiction ratione personae to hear its claims under the BIT,\u00a0not being it necessary to take into account its eventual lack of standing at this stage.\nc. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0With Regard to Nations\n414. \u00a0\u00a0Respondent holds that the Arbitral Tribunal also lacks jurisdiction with regard to\u00a0Nations, since the latter admitted in the context of a judicial proceeding in Panama\u00a0that it had not acquired its shares of stock in COPESA through legitimate means\u00a0and that such shares lacked validity.224\n415. \u00a0For the same reasons stated in connection with EME, the Arbitral Tribunal considers\u00a0that the argument presented by Respondent raises a legal standing issue that should\u00a0be addressed as a question of merit and not as a matter of jurisdiction. Nations is a\u00a0corporation constituted under the laws of the United States and, to the extent that it\u00a0complies with the requirements set forth in the ICSID Convention and the BIT, the\u00a0Arbitral Tribunal has jurisdiction ratione personae to hear its claims under the BIT,\u00a0not being it necessary to take into account its eventual lack of standing at this stage.\n4. Jurisdiction Ratione Materiae\n416. \u00a0\u00a0Respondent objects to the jurisdiction of the Arbitral Tribunal asserting that, (a) in\u00a0this case there is no protected investment under Article 25 of the ICSID Convention,\u00a0and (b) in any case, under Article XI of the BIT the Tribunal may only hear claims\u00a0based on alleged cases of expropriation.\nd. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Existence of a Protected Investment\n417. \u00a0\u00a0The Arbitral Tribunal shall decide, in the first place, (a.b.) on the disagreement of the\u00a0parties regarding the identification of the investment allegedly made by Claimants in\u00a0this case, and then (a.c.) assess whether the investment fulfills the necessary\u00a0requirements in order to be protected by the BIT in the context of an ICSID\n223 Jurado\u2019s Statement acting as representative of EME dated April 10, 2008.\n224 Rejoinder, \u00a7 15.\n72\nCase 8:12-cv-01647-EAK-MAP Document 3-5 Filed 07/24/12 Page 32 of 44 PageID 218\narbitration, but first of all, (a.a.) the Arbitral Tribunal shall determine the applicable legal rules to that effect.\na.a. Applicable Rules\n418. \u00a0\u00a0This arbitration is based on the BIT and the ICSID Convention. Therefore, the\u00a0definitions contained in the BIT, as well as the requirements set forth in the ICSID\u00a0Convention, apply to the definition of the investment at issue.\n419. \u00a0Article 25.1 of the ICSID Convention establishes that the jurisdiction of the Centre\u00a0shall extend to any \u201clegal dispute arising directly out of an investment. \u201d\n420. \u00a0As is well known, the ICSID Convention does not provide the definition of\u00a0investment. However, the jurisdiction of the Centre is not open to any kind of\u00a0dispute that the parties may decide to submit to it. It is generally accepted that\u00a0Article 25 of the ICSID Convention refers to an objective conception of the notion\u00a0of investment. Therefore, the alleged investment must fulfill the conditions set\u00a0forth in the BIT, as well as the objective requirement prescribed under Article 25 of\u00a0the ICSID Convention.226\n421. \u00a0\u00a0Under Article I (d) of the BIT, investment:\n\u201cMeans every kind of investment, owned or controlled directly or indirectly, including equity, debt, and service and investment contracts, and includes:\ni. \u00a0Tangible and intangible property, including rights, such as mortgages,\u00a0liens and pledges;\nii. A company, or shares of stock, or other interests in a company or\u00a0interests in the assets thereof;\nHi. A claim to money, or a claim to performance having economic value and associated with an investment;\niv. \u00a0\u00a0Intellectual and industrial property rights, including rights with\u00a0respect to copyrights, patents, trademarks, trade names, industrial\u00a0designs, trade secrets and know-how; and goodwill;\nv.

In their Post-Hearing Memorial, Claimants\u00a0reaffirmed that their decision to invest in the plant was based on the tax credit regime\u00a0in effect at that time.229\n426. \u00a0\u00a0On the other hand, Respondent contends that the acquisition of tax credits may not, in\u00a0itself, qualify as investment in the objective meaning of Article 25 of the ICSID\u00a0Convention.\n427. \u00a0\u00a0In this regard, Respondent asserts that the alleged investment in tax credits, as\u00a0characterized by Claimants, could not meet the contribution requirements, duration,\u00a0participation in risks and contribution towards the country\u2019s economic\u00a0development.230\n428. \u00a0\u00a0Certainly, if it were accepted that Claimants only invested in tax credits, this\u00a0transaction would fail to exhibit some of the characteristics of an investment in terms\u00a0of Article 25 of the ICSID Convention.\n429. \u00a0\u00a0In this regard, there is no need to analyze in detail the discussion about the definition\u00a0of Article 25\u2019s objective requirements, and their necessary character. The Arbitral\u00a0Tribunal believes that the existence of a certain contribution towards the economy of\u00a0the country and an assumption of risks by the investor are relevant elements \u2014among\n227 Memorial, \u00a7 1 and 17.\n228 Rejoinder, \u00a7 177, see also \u00a7 169.\n229 Claimants\u2019 PHM, \u00a7 4.\n230 Rejoinder, \u00a7 88.\n74\nCase 8:12-cv-01647-EAK-MAP Document 3-5 Filed 07/24/12 Page 34 of 44 PageID 220\nothers - for the identification of an investment.231 Indeed, there can hardly be an investment without the investor having made contributions to the economic value for\u00a0the country. Said contributions are precisely the reason for the protection granted by\u00a0the State, and making the contributions usually entails the assumption of certain risks\u00a0by the investor. .\n430. \u00a0\u00a0Should it be identified as an investment in the disputed tax credits, the transaction\u00a0would certainly fail to meet such requirements. It would merely be an acquisition of\u00a0credits against the State, of a clear speculative nature, which would entail no\u00a0contribution whatsoever to the country\u2019s economy and would not carry any risk\u00a0assumption.\n431. \u00a0\u00a0It is therefore necessary to determine the real purpose of the disputed investment in\u00a0order to assess whether it is protected under the BIT and the ICSID Convention. \u2019\n432. \u00a0\u00a0To that effect, the Arbitral Tribunal deems it necessary to investigate what the alleged\u00a0investors\u2019 intention was at the time of the transaction in question. In order for tax\u00a0credits to be regarded as the object of the investment made by Claimants, the latter\u00a0should prove - as an indispensable condition, although not necessarily sufficient -that the existence of such credits was an essential and decisive element in their\u00a0decision to acquire COPESA shares.\n433. \u00a0\u00a0The Arbitral Tribunal considers that Claimants invested in COPESA shares, and not\u00a0mainly in the tax credits provided by Panamanian legislation. In effect, Claimants\u00a0have not furnished any evidence to show that at the time of establishing COPESA,\u00a0and when they financed the construction of the plant, they took into consideration the\u00a0tax credits they now seek.\n434. \u00a0\u00a0On the contrary, the file shows that the first time Claimants cared about the alleged\u00a0tax credits was in the year 2002. Mr. Coch\u00e9z, witness for the Claimants, asserted in\u00a0his witness statement that when Mr. Berrio assumed the presidency of COPESA in\u00a02002, he discovered \u201cthat the company became entitled to a series of tax benefits\u00a0arising from the investment.\u201d23\\*\n435.\n  \nIt is also surprising that, in spite of the offer made by KPMG on September 22, 1998, to perform the investment certification necessary to obtain the investment credit tax\nSchreuer et al., The ICSID Convention: A Commentary, Cambridge University Press, 2009 pp 128-134 and the aforementioned case law.\nAs noted by Ch. Schreuer, \"-The existence of a risk was always confirmed by tribunals, \u201d The ICSID Convention: A Commentary, Cambridge University Press, 2009, p. 131.\nPursuant to Law 28, the tax credit amount is 100% of the investment amount. In addition, the credit may be immediately applied to income tax. While it is true that an ICSID Tribunal estimated that, under certain\u00a0c\u2019rc\u2122s\u2019;ances\u2019 negOtlable mstruments may meet the requirements set forth in Article 25 (FEDAX v. Venezuela\u00a0\u00cfCS\u00cfD Case No. ARB/96/3), the FEDAX Tribunal noted that, under the circumstances of the case, the disputed\u00a0negotiable instruments were not \u201cmerely a short-term, occasional financial arrangement, such as could\u00a0fV>Pen with investments that come in for a quick gain and leave immediately thereafter.\u201d (\u00a7 43).\nCoch\u00e9z\u2019s Statement I; see also Berrio\u2019s Statement I.\n75\nCase 8:12-cv-01647-EAK-MAP Document 3-5 Filed 07/24/12 Page 35 of 44 PageID 221\nbenefit,235 COPESA did not pursue the offer and preferred to depreciate its goods over all these years, as evidenced by \u00c1lvaro Alem\u00e1n\u2019s Report.236\n436. \u00a0\u00a0The fact that tax credits were not considered the main objective of the investment\u00a0made in 1997 and 1998 is also confirmed by the fact that COPESA\u2019s financial\u00a0statements only mention the alleged tax credits in 2002.237\n437. \u00a0Based on the foregoing, it may be concluded that Claimants did not make their\u00a0investment taking into account the tax credits. They took into account their analysis\u00a0of the plant value and the potential economic benefits resulting from its exploitation.\n438. \u00a0\u00a0In this regard, determining whether the investors were aware of the existence of tax\u00a0credits at the time of their investment is irrelevant. What matters is to determine\u00a0whether the tax credits were their main reason for making the investment, in such a\u00a0way that it could be assumed that Claimants did not mainly intend to purchase capital\u00a0stock but to acquire tax credits.\n439. \u00a0\u00a0The Arbitral Tribunal considers that there is no evidence to show that tax credits were\u00a0a relevant motive for Claimants at the time they acquired their interests in COPESA -let alone their principal and determining motive.\n440. \u00a0\u00a0Therefore, the Arbitral Tribunal concludes that the object of the investment made by\u00a0Claimants was not mainly the tax credits, but the COPESA shares and the plant\u00a0operated by said company.\na.c. Protection Requirements\n441. \u00a0Having been identified, there is no doubt that Claimants\u2019 investment falls under the\u00a0scope of Article 1.1 d) (ii) of the BIT, which portrays investment as the \u201cshares of\u00a0stock, or other interests in a company, or interests in the assets thereof. \u201d\n442. \u00a0However, Respondent challenges the jurisdiction of the Arbitral Tribunal alleging\u00a0that, even if the object was the COPESA shares, the investment would not meet the\u00a0objective requirements set forth in Article 25 of the ICSID Convention to be qualified\u00a0as such.\n443. \u00a0Regarding the definition of such objective requirements, Respondent has made\u00a0reference to several awards,238 from which certain frequently quoted criteria may be\u00a0gathered. Pursuant to said criteria, the objective conception of investment is defined\u00a0as an operation involving contributions, a certain duration, an assumption of risk by\n235 R-54.\n236 Alem\u00e1n\u2019s Report I, \u00a7 81 et seq.\n237 Rejoinder, \u00a7 112.\n238 Rejoinder, footnote 189.\n76\nCase 8:12-cv-01647-EAK-MAP Document 3-5 Filed 07/24/12 Page 36 of 44 PageID 222\nthe investor, and a contribution towards the economic development of the receiving State.239\n444. \u00a0\u00a0It is not necessary for the Arbitral Tribunal to discuss the definition of the objective\u00a0requirements of an investment in terms of Article 25 of the ICSID Convention and\u00a0the necessary condition of said requirements. Indeed, as stated below, the investment\u00a0made by Claimants in COPESA fulfills all the requirements stated by Respondent.\n445. \u00a0\u00a0Basically, Respondent objects to the Arbitral Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction asserting that\u00a0Claimants failed to prove that they made contributions to COPESA. Particularly,\u00a0Respondent asserts that Jurado failed to produce evidence of contributions made in\u00a0cash to COPESA; that the investment certifications prepared by Hazel Jaramillo and\u00a0Teodomiro Pino Mendieta are not reliable; that there is no evidence that the\u00a0promissory note issued for an amount of US$4.1 million is related to COPESA or its\u00a0plant; and that KPMG concluded that there was no evidence indicating that Jurado or\u00a0EME paid US$1.5 million for the alleged investment.240\n446. \u00a0In this regard, Respondent considers that Claimants\u2019 failure to produce COPESA\u2019s\u00a0accounting records, notwithstanding the order issued by the Arbitral Tribunal to that\u00a0effect, is a sign that Claimants made no contribution whatsoever to that company.241\n447. \u00a0The Arbitral Tribunal considers Respondent\u2019s approach to be too formalistic.\u00a0ICSID\u2019s case law has admitted that the concept of contribution encompasses not only\u00a0financial commitments, but also contributions in terms of know-how, equipment,\u00a0personnel, and services.242 Likewise, there is no reason to require that the\u00a0contributions have been made directly to COPESA, since the investor may have\u00a0invested by way of direct or indirect funding.\n448. \u00a0\u00a0In the case at hand, there is sufficient evidence that Claimants made consistent\u00a0contributions to COPESA and that these contributions were used to finance the plant\u00a0and get it operational.\n449. \u00a0With regard to Jurado and EME, it has been proven that they subscribed a\u00a0promissory note in the amount of US$4.1 million in favor of General Electric, the\u00a0party that sold the plant, and there is also evidence of payment of this promissory\u00a0note.243 In addition, certain documentation on COPESA\u2019s records produced by\n239 Salini Construttori SPA v.

Nations abandoned this proceeding\u00a0and it did not go so far as to render Nations\u2019 shares void.\n453. \u00a0\u00a0With regard to the other objective requirements identified by Respondent for the\u00a0disputed operation to be deemed an investment in terms of Article 25.1 of the ICSID\u00a0Convention, Respondent does not contend that the duration of the investment made in\u00a0COPESA was insufficient, nor that the investment failed to involve an assumption of\u00a0risk or that it did not contribute towards the country\u2019s economic. These criteria are\u00a0not at issue.\n454. \u00a0At any rate, the Arbitral Tribunal considers that the investment made by Claimants\u00a0meets all of these objective requirements. The requirement of duration is\u00a0undoubtedly satisfied based on the useful life of a power generation plant. The\u00a0investment also represented an assumption of risk by shareholders, especially given\u00a0the value of the plant, and the evolutionary condition of the regulatory framework for\u00a0power generation and distribution in Panama. Finally, it is true that the construction\u00a0and operation of a power generation plant constituted a significant contribution\u00a0towards the economic development of the receiving State.\n455. \u00a0Based on the foregoing, the Arbitral Tribunal concludes that Claimants made an\u00a0investment in COPESA, and that such investment meets the necessary requirements\u00a0to be protected under the BIT and under Article 25 of the ICSID Convention.\ne. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Scope of Article XI of the BIT\n456. \u00a0\u00a0The parties disagree on the interpretation of Article XI of the BIT.\n457. \u00a0Article XI of the BIT reads as follows:\n244 C-8 (a).\n245 C-8 (b).\n78\nCase 8:12-cv-01647-EAK-MAP Document 3-5 Filed 07/24/12 Page 38 of 44 PageID 224\n\u201c1. With respect to tax policies, each party shall strive to accord a fair and equitable treatment to the investments of nationals and companies of the other\u00a0party.\n2. Nevertheless, this Treaty shall apply to matters of taxation only with respect to the following:\na) Expropriation, pursuant to Article IV;\nb) Transfers, pursuant to Article VI; or\nc) The observance and enforcement of the terms of an investment agreement or\u00a0authorization, as referred to in Article VII (1) (a) or (b). \u201d\n458. \u00a0\u00a0In this regard, Respondent holds that said Article precludes the jurisdiction of the\u00a0Arbitral Tribunal over matters of taxation, unless the dispute refers to any of the three\u00a0exceptions therein set forth.\n459. \u00a0\u00a0On the other hand, Claimants consider, in the first place, that this issue \u201cis beyond the\u00a0scope of simple matters of taxation.\u201d1\\*6 In addition, they contend that Article XI\u00a0does not waive the obligation of fair and equitable treatment in spite of the fact that\u00a0the wording of Article XI. 1 was less mandatory.247 Finally, Claimants affirm that the\u00a0alleged expropriation is a \u201cgateway\u201d to other Treaty provisions supposedly breached\u00a0by Respondent248.\n460. \u00a0\u00a0In the first place, the Arbitral Tribunal shall analyze (b.a.) whether this dispute may\u00a0be regarded as a matter of taxation in terms of Article XI.2 of the BIT. Afterwards,\u00a0(b.b.) the Arbitral Tribunal shall analyze whether Article XL 1 of the BIT is of\u00a0mandatory character and allows for the Arbitral Tribunal to exercise jurisdiction over\u00a0allegedly unfair and inequitable treatment in matters of taxation. Next, (b.c.) the\u00a0Arbitral Tribunal shall determine if its jurisdiction may be based on any of the three\u00a0exceptions set forth in Article XI.2, and (b.d.) whether said jurisdiction may then\u00a0extend to other BIT provisions.\nb.a. Matters of Taxation\n461. \u00a0The BIT does not include a definition of what is meant by \u201cmatter of taxation\u201d.\u00a0However, the parties do not seem to disagree as to the tax nature of the discussion on\u00a0the disputed tax credits.\n246 Reply, \u00a7 194.\n247 Claimants\u2019 PHM, \u00a7 48.\n248 Reply, \u00a7 196.\n79\nCase 8:12-cv-01647-EAK-MAP Document 3-5 Filed 07/24/12 Page 39 of 44 PageID 225\n462. \u00a0\u00a0Nevertheless, Claimants assert that, by denying said tax credits, the State hindered the\u00a0sale of COPESA stock. Therefore, Claimants assertions would fall without the\u00a0sphere of simple matters of taxation referred to in Article XI.2 of the BIT.249.\n463. \u00a0\u00a0The Arbitral Tribunal disagrees with that interpretation.\n464. \u00a0\u00a0It is not controverted that the present dispute is mainly related to ascertaining whether\u00a0Claimants\u2019 tax credits were transferable by way of the issue of bonds or the sale of\u00a0shares of stock. This is clearly a matter of taxation in terms of Article XI.2 of the\u00a0BIT.\n465. \u00a0\u00a0The fact that the alleged denial by Respondent to recognize the transferability of tax\u00a0credits may have resulted in the failure of Claimants\u2019 project for the sale of their\u00a0shares of stock to third parties does not change the fact that the main object of the\u00a0dispute is of a tax nature, since it affects one of the elements of the legal tax relation\u00a0between taxpayers and the tax authority. The Arbitral Tribunal could not assess\u00a0whether the failed issuance of bonds or sale of shares , by Claimants is attributable to\u00a0the State without making a decision on the divergent interpretations of Panamanian\u00a0tax laws made by the parties\n466. \u00a0\u00a0Therefore, the Arbitral Tribunal concludes that the dispute at hand refers to matters of\u00a0taxation and, consequently, falls within the provision of Article XI.2 of the BIT.\nb.b. Interpretation of Article XL 1 of the BIT and Scope of\nthe Arbitral Tribunal\u2019s Jurisdiction\n467. \u00a0Basically, Claimants hold that Article XL 1 of the BIT enables the Arbitral Tribunal to\u00a0assess a possible unfair and inequitable treatment regarding the matters of taxation at\u00a0issue.\n468. \u00a0\u00a0In that respect, Claimants assert that \u201cthe fair and equitable treatment standard\u00a0[contained in Article XI. 1] is not the empty container Respondent would like it to be.\u00a0\u2018It shall strive to afford fair and equitable treatment \u2019 does not delete words nor does\u00a0it mention the concept of fairness and equity 'for no reason. Although it may result\u00a0in a reduction of the existing obligations, it does not make the obligation disappear.\u00a0Respondent\u2019s argument, if considered word for word, would destroy the international\u00a0investment regime fostered by Panama. Another unequivocal indication of the\u00a0obligation set forth in Article XI (1) of the BIT is the use of the word \u2018shall\u2019, which\u00a0explicitly indicates a clear and binding obligation. \u201d250\n469. \u00a0To support their argument, Claimants base their opinion on the Occidental v.\u00a0Ecuador award,251 in which the tribunal held that it had jurisdiction to hear a matter\n249 Reply, \u00a7 194.\n250 Claimants\u2019 PHM, \u00a7 45.\n251 Occidental Exploration and Production Co. v.

In this regard, the Arbitral Tribunal notes that other tribunals have\u00a0adopted a different interpretation of an exception clause similar to Article XL 1 of the\u00a0BIT.253\n472. \u00a0\u00a0In the opinion of the Arbitral Tribunal, Article XI of the BIT is clear. By using the\u00a0terms \u201cshall strive to afford\u201d in Article XL 1 instead of a more prescriptive language\u00a0(such as \u201cshall afford\u201d), the State intended to limit the mandatory effect of the rule,\u00a0therefore excluding the recourses available to investors under the treaty in the event\u00a0described in said Article.\n473. \u00a0In Paragraph XI.2, the use of the wording \u201cnevertheless, this Treaty shall apply to\u00a0matters of taxation only with respect to...\u201d clearly means that Article XI.2 is an\u00a0exception to Article XL 1, which undoubtedly implies that the commitment provided\u00a0for in Article X.l falls without the scope of the State\u2019s obligations under the BIT, the\u00a0execution of which may be directly demanded by investors.\n474. \u00a0Therefore, the consequences of possible breaches by the State of their commitment to\u00a0\u201cstrive to afford\u201d fair and equitable treatment with respect to tax policies falls\u00a0without the scope of the rights directly granted to investors under the BIT, and may\u00a0not serve as the basis for the institution of an arbitral proceeding based on Article I of\u00a0the Protocol Amending the Treaty dated June 1, 2000.\n475. \u00a0Even if it were admitted that Article XI of the BIT is in need of interpretation (which\u00a0is not the opinion of the Arbitral Tribunal since it considers that the Article is\u00a0sufficiently clear), the result would not change.\n476. \u00a0\u00a0In effect, Article 31 of the 1969 Vienna Convention on the law of treaties establishes\u00a0that a BIT shall be interpreted \u201cin accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to\u00a0the terms of the treaty in their context and in the light of its object and purpose.\u201d\n477. \u00a0By using the word \u201cnevertheless\u201d in its Article XI.2, the BIT has clearly set an\u00a0exception to the rule provided for in Article XI. 1. Such exception may not be\n252 Reply, \u00a7 195.\n253 El Paso Energy International Company v.

Therefore, Claimants\u2019 theory leads to\u00a0a result contrary to the terms of the BIT and must be rejected.\nIn addition, Claimants\u2019 theory leads to a result contrary to the object of the BIT.\nIndeed, there is no doubt that the purpose of Article XI.2 is to exclude matters of taxation from the scope of the BIT. The reason therefor is easily understood, given\u00a0the significance of tax policy for State sovereignty. Article XI differentiates the\u00a0issues that, in matters of taxation, are left to the parties\u2019 discretion, and those which\u00a0are subject to the BIT. Article XL 1 leaves the subject of fair and equitable treatment\u00a0in matters of taxation as a prerogative of the Contracting State in the application of its\u00a0tax policy. However, Article XI.2 expressly defines the aspects that, in spite of being\u00a0related to tax matters, the contracting States agreed were to be included in the scope\u00a0of application of the BIT.\nThe preclusion of matters of taxation is therefore defined, and does not apply to the cases specifically listed in Article XI.2. Interpreting Article XL 1 in the manner\u00a0proposed by Claimants would deprive the limited admission of matters of taxation\u00a0established in Article XI.2 of all meaning, giving the Arbitral Tribunal vast\u00a0jurisdiction to assess the tax policy of the State.\nTherefore, the Arbitral Tribunal concludes that Article XI of the Treaty grants jurisdiction to the Arbitral Tribunal over matters of taxation only in the three\u00a0exceptions provided under Article XI.2\nb.c. \u00a0\u00a0Jurisdiction of the Arbitral Tribunal over Matters of\nTaxation, Based on the Exceptions Provided Under Article XI.2 of the BIT\nThe parties do not argue the fact that the exception contained in Article XI.2(b) (transfers pursuant to Article VI) does not apply to this case.\nAs regards Paragraph XI.2(c) (the observance and enforcement of terms of an investment agreement or authorization), in their Request for Arbitration dated August\u00a02006 Claimants asserted that \u201cwhile Panama has not a particular agency designated\u00a0as a foreign investment authority, Law 28 together with Law 6, and Law 54\n82\nCase 8:12-cv-01647-EAK-MAP Document 3-5 Filed 07/24/12 Page 42 of 44 PageID 228\nestablishes (sic) a framework that constituted an investment authorization for power generating companies, including Copesa.\u201d254 Claimants seemed to assert that the\u00a0jurisdiction of the Arbitral Tribunal could be based on Article XI.2(c) of the BIT.\u00a0However, Claimants failed to refer to this argument in their Memorial, Reply and\u00a0PHM, and so the Arbitral Tribunal understands that this argument has been\u00a0relinquished.\n486. \u00a0\u00a0In any case, the Arbitral Tribunal considers that the assumption under Article XI.2(c)\u00a0does not apply to this case. By referring to an investment agreement or authorization,\u00a0Article XI.2(c) establishes that said agreement or authorization refers to Article VII. 1\u00a0(a) or (b) of the BIT. Article VII. 1(a) refers to \u201can investment agreement between a\u00a0Party and a national or company of the other Party.\u201d It is undisputed that there is no\u00a0such agreement of this type in the case at hand. Article VII. 1(b) refers to \u201cany\u00a0investment authorization granted by its foreign investment authority.\u201d In this case,\u00a0Laws 28, 54 and 6 do not prescribe any type of investment authorization and,\u00a0therefore, may not be assimilated to an \u201cinvestment authorization frameworld'' in\u00a0terms of Article XI.2(c).\n487. \u00a0\u00a0Therefore, the Arbitral Tribunal concludes that the assumptions described in\u00a0Article XI.2 (b) and (c) may not be applied to this case.\n488. \u00a0\u00a0With regard to the assumption under Article XI.2(a), it refers to the existence of an\u00a0alleged expropriation pursuant to Article IV, Paragraph 1, which reads as follows:\n\u201cThe investment made by a national or a company of either Party shall not be expropriated, nationalized, or subjected to any other direct or indirect measure\u00a0having an effect equivalent to expropriation or nationalization (expropriation) in\u00a0the territory of the other party, except for a public or social purpose; in a non-discriminatory manner; upon payment of prompt, adequate and effective\u00a0compensations and in accordance with due process and the general principles of\u00a0treatment laid down in Article 11(2). Such compensation shall amount to the full\u00a0value of the expropriated investment immediately before the expropriating\u00a0action became known; include interest at a commercially reasonable rate; be\u00a0paid without delay; be effectively realizable; and be freely transferable. \u201d\n489. \u00a0\u00a0Claimants hold that Respondent\u2019s actions, illegitimately denying that the planned\u00a0issuance of bonds allowed for the transfer of tax credits, involved an indirect\u00a0expropriation of Claimants\u2019 rights.\nLikewise, the illegitimate refusal by Respondent to recognize the transferability of the tax credits to which Claimants\u2019 COPESA shares were entitled prevented\n254 Translation by the Tribunal: \u201cA\u00fan cuando Panam\u00e1 no dispone de una agenda en particular concebida como\u00a0autoridad de inversiones, la ley 28 junto con la ley 6 y la ley 54 establecen un marco que constituye una\u00a0autorizaci\u00f3n para invertir en las empresas generadoras de electricidad, incluyendo COPESA.\" Claimants\u2019\u00a0Request for Arbitration, p. 9, \u00a7 4.\n83\nCase 8:12-cv-01647-EAK-MAP Document 3-5 Filed 07/24/12 Page 43 of 44 PageID 229\nClaimants from selling the shares, depriving them of their value, and thus constituting an indirect expropriation in terms of Article IV. 1 of the BIT.255\n490. \u00a0In order to determine whether it has jurisdiction ratione materiae, the Arbitral\u00a0Tribunal does not need to decide if said allegations are founded. To decide whether\u00a0there was indirect expropriation in the case at hand is a matter of the merits.\n491. \u00a0\u00a0For the Arbitral Tribunal to have jurisdiction, it is enough for the facts claimed by the\u00a0Respondent, if proven, to be likely to constitute an expropriation in terms of the\u00a0BIT.256 It is therefore a prima facie valuation, based on the assumption that the facts\u00a0alleged by Claimants can be proven.\n492. \u00a0\u00a0At this stage of the debate on jurisdiction, it is the opinion of the Arbitral Tribunal\u00a0that Claimants\u2019 claims regarding an alleged indirect expropriation fall prima facie\u00a0within the scope of Article IV of the BIT.\n493. \u00a0\u00a0Therefore, the Arbitral Tribunal has jurisdiction to hear such claims.\nb.d. Alleged Extension of the Arbitral Tribunal\u2019s Jurisdiction\nto Treaty Provisions other than Article IV\n494. \u00a0\u00a0Claimants contend that, once the jurisdiction of the Arbitral Tribunal has been\u00a0established based on one of the exceptions stated in Article XI.2, said jurisdiction\u00a0should extend to the rest of the Treaty, including Article II.257\n495. \u00a0The Arbitral Tribunal dismisses this argument based on the aforementioned\n258\nreasons.\n496. \u00a0\u00a0The jurisdiction of the Arbitral Tribunal over matters of taxation is limited by\u00a0Article XI of the BIT to a possible expropriation, and the Treaty may not be\u00a0interpreted in a manner that would deprive Article XI of all meaning. If alleging a\u00a0possible expropriation were enough to \u201copen the door\u201d of the Treaty to other alleged\u00a0breaches by the State of its obligations in tax matters, Article XI would be deprived\u00a0of all scope.\n497. \u00a0\u00a0To sum up, the Arbitral Tribunal declares it has jurisdiction to hear about the alleged\u00a0expropriation of the investment made by Claimants.\nUt supra, \u00a7 251 et seq.\n256 \u201cOil Platforms\" (Islamic Republic of Iran v.

Admissibility and Merits\n498. \u00a0\u00a0Claimants complain that Respondent denied them the possibility to transfer to third\u00a0parties the direct or indirect investment tax credits supposedly associated with their\u00a0investment in COPESA, whether by way of the issuance of bonds or by means of the\u00a0sale of their shares in said company.\n499. \u00a0\u00a0Claimants do not allege that the State illegitimately deprived them of the possibility\u00a0to personally apply the disputed credits. Under Claimants\u2019 theory, the alleged\u00a0expropriation results from Respondent\u2019s illegitimate decision not to allow the transfer\u00a0of the tax credits at issue to third parties by way of an issuance of bonds or sale of\u00a0shares.\n500. \u00a0A discussion has indeed been brought in the context of this arbitration on whether\u00a0Claimants are the holders of the disputed tax credits, and Respondent contended that\u00a0they are not, for a series of reasons that the Arbitral Tribunal, as explained below,\u00a0deems essentially erroneous. However, this discussion is only relevant to determine\u00a0if Claimants could purport to transfer said credits to third parties. Claimants never\u00a0applied or requested to apply their credits personally. Instead, what they intended to\u00a0do was to assign them to third parties, and it is their impossibility to do so what,\u00a0according to their theory, constitutes the alleged expropriation of their rights.\n501. \u00a0\u00a0At the basis of the dispute between the parties is the interpretation of Panamanian tax\u00a0laws on tax incentives and, in particular, Law 28 of June 20, 1995, and Executive\u00a0Decree 274 of December 29, 1996.\n502. \u00a0\u00a0First of all, the Arbitral Tribunal shall analyze the objections filed by Respondent\u00a0regarding the admissibility of Nations\u2019 and EME\u2019s claims (1).\n503. \u00a0\u00a0Regarding the merits, the Arbitral Tribunal shall analyze (2) whether the inquiry of\u00a0August 26, 2004 created any right or legitimate expectation in favor of Claimants,\u00a0and whether the State may be reproached for the subsequent consultation made in\u00a02005.\n504. \u00a0\u00a0Afterwards, (3) the Arbitral Tribunal shall analyze the legal framework in effect in\u00a0Panama in order to determine if Claimants had any right regarding the alleged tax\u00a0credits and the transfer thereof, which allegedly were unlawfully denied by\u00a0Respondent.\n505. \u00a0\u00a0Next, (4) the Arbitral Tribunal shall determine whether the acts the State is\u00a0reproached for might be characterized as an indirect expropriation in terms of\u00a0Article IV of the BIT.\n5. Admissibility of Nations\u2019 and EME\u2019s Claims\n85\nCase 8:12-cv-01647-EAK-MAP Document 3-6 Filed 07/24/12 Page 1 of 44 PageID 231\n506. \u00a0As previously discussed, the objections filed by Respondent regarding EME\u2019s and\u00a0Nation\u2019s lack of legal standing to sue are issues of admissibility and not of\u00a0jurisdiction.259 Said objections are groundless.\n507. \u00a0\u00a0With regard to Nations, although at a different proceeding against a different party\u00a0Nations could have contested the lawfulness of its stock acquisition, it is undisputed\u00a0that Nations abandoned the proceeding and Nation\u2019s securities were not rendered null\u00a0and void. Therefore, the Arbitral Tribunal concludes that Nations has legal standing\u00a0to sue in this arbitration.\n508. \u00a0\u00a0With regard to EME, although EME transferred its COPESA interests to Jurado, it is\u00a0undisputed that EME still appears in COPESA\u2019s books as a shareholder. Therefore,\u00a0EME has legal standing, together with Jurado, to act as claimant in this arbitration.\n6. The Inquiries Made on August 26, 2004 and January 27, 2005\n509. \u00a0The factual context of Claimants\u2019 claims as regards the successive opinions from the\u00a0GDR is described in Paragraphs 40 to 52 of the Memorial.\n510. \u00a0\u00a0In short, Claimants assert that the acquisition of the plant was financed, together with\u00a0the direct contributions of shareholders, by means of a loan initially granted by Banco\u00a0Disa, which was to be repaid by way of an issuance of COPESA\u2019s bonds.\n511. \u00a0\u00a0Originally, said issuance of bonds was to take place during the term of the credit\u00a0facility agreement.260\n512. \u00a0\u00a0It is undisputed by the parties that the issuance of bonds was not carried out at that\u00a0time for reasons unrelated to this dispute.261\n513. \u00a0Several years later, COPESA considered merging with another company (Fortuna),\u00a0which made it necessary to determine whether the credits for direct investment in\u00a0COPESA could be used by the surviving entity after the merger.\n514. \u00a0On March 11, 2003 the General Directorate of Revenue of Panama (\u201cGDR\u201d), issued\u00a0an opinion in this regard, admitting the hypothetical possibility that the surviving\u00a0entity of a merger between two companies engaged in qualified activities, and with\u00a0tax credits available, would retain the tax credits of the merging companies to the\u00a0extent that the resulting company would also carry out qualified activities.262\u00a0However, the merger did not take place and the parties agree that the reasons therefor\u00a0were unrelated to the Respondent.263\nUt supra, \u00a7 410-415.\n260 Credit facility agreement entered into between Disa and Copesa (R-25), Clause Five.\n261 Memorial, \u00a7 27.\n262 C-18.\n263 Memorial, \u00a744.\n86\nCase 8:12-cv-01647-EAK-MAP Document 3-6 Filed 07/24/12 Page 2 of 44 PageID 232\n515. \u00a0At that time, COPESA again considered the possibility of issuing bonds that carried\u00a0the company\u2019s tax credits.\n516. \u00a0To that effect, on August 17, 2004 COPESA requested the GDR\u2019s opinion regarding\u00a0the possibility that buyers of the bonds to be issued be entitled to \u201cthe benefit granted\u00a0to indirect investments under Law 28 of June 20, 2005. \u201d264\n517. \u00a0On August 26, 2004 Mrs. Piad Herbruger, General Director of the GDR, replied that\u00a0\u201cCOPESA being entitled to a tax credit for a direct investment in power generation\u00a0activities [...] had the right to offer other taxpayers the tax credit, provided the\u00a0taxpayer issued bonds, stock or other securities for the purpose of investing,\u00a0indirectly in this case. \u201d\n518. \u00a0Mrs. Herbruger ended her reply stating that COPESA\u2019s credit through direct\u00a0investment could be \u201creclassified as credit through an indirect investment, , so that it\u00a0may be used by other taxpayers acquiring bonds issued by Banco Disa [...] for the\u00a0purpose of recovering its investment [...] or where it may be applied by Banco Disa,\u00a0as a credit for an indirect investment in any case. \u201d\n519. \u00a0However, on January 27, 2005 the new General Director of the GDR, Mrs. Florencia\u00a0Rios Serracin, issued a different opinion, stating that \u201cthere are no legal grounds for\u00a0this Office to accept the application of credits for investments in bonds, stock or other\u00a0securities issued by companies involved in activities ensuring the generation of power\u00a0and supply of water for production purposes, based on the repeal of Section 6,\u00a0Law 28 of July 20, 1995. There are even less grounds to allow the application of\u00a0credit to operations of that nature that were made during the current year, as it\u00a0would be unlawful due to the repeal of the law that created the credits. \u201d\n520. \u00a0After receiving the above letter, COPESA\u2019s representatives held a meeting with the\u00a0Vice Minister of the MEF, Mr. Rolando Mirones, but the parties have different\u00a0versions regarding the statements made by Mr. Mirones at the meeting.\n521. \u00a0Subsequently, COPESA and GDR exchanged several letters, the contents of which\u00a0indicate that the parties had different interpretations of tax law regarding the\u00a0transferability of tax credits.\n522. \u00a0Claimants contend that the inquiry of August 26, 2004 was binding on the GDR, and\u00a0that the GDR could not change its criteria without breaching the principle of\u00a0legitimate trust. In order to assess whether Claimants\u2019 allegations are justified, first\u00a0we need to examine: (a) if the inquiry made on August 26, 2004 gave rise to any\u00a0rights that the Claimants could allege they were deprived of; or (b) it gave rise to\u00a0some legitimate expectation.\n264 R-108.\n87\nCase 8:12-cv-01647-EAK-MAP Document 3-6 Filed 07/24/12 Page 3 of 44 PageID 233\na. The August 26, 2004 Inquiry is Non-Binding\n523. \u00a0Claimants used the inquiry made on August 26, 2004 both as proof of their theory\u00a0that indirect investment tax credits can be transferred265 and to support their theory\u00a0that by changing its opinion in the subsequent communication dated January 27,\u00a02005, the Respondent intended to \u201cplace Claimants \u2019 operations at risk -with regard to\u00a0the tax credits\u201d thus being \u201cin clear violation of Panamanian law.\u201d266\n524. \u00a0However, in their Reply Claimants asserted that \"the opinion issued by the GDR on\u00a0August 26, 2004 ratifies the provisions of the Law, but does not constitute the basis\u00a0for the reasoning presented in this proceeding. \u201d267 Below, the Arbitral Tribunal\u00a0shall analyze the Panamanian legal framework regarding the disputed issue, that is,\u00a0whether indirect investment tax credits could be transferred.\n525. \u00a0In any case, the Arbitral Tribunal believes that the opinion dated August 26, 2004\u00a0could not have created any rights in favor of the Claimants.\n526. \u00a0\u00a0Indeed, the experts and witnesses for the parties agreed that the disputed inquiries\u00a0were not binding and, therefore, did not give rise to any rights for the Claimants.\n527. \u00a0\u00a0In this regard, Mr. Jaime Gilberto Franco-P\u00e9rez considers that Panamanian tax law\u00a0establishes a clear difference between a simple inquiry, such as the one made on\u00a0August 26, 2004, and a resolution whereby the tax authority decides on the merits of\u00a0a petition. An example of such a resolution is on Record, obtained by the company\u00a0Telered on September 26, 2000, whereby the GDR decided to formally recognize the\u00a0tax credit invoked by said company.\n528. \u00a0Unlike such resolution, according to Mr. P\u00e9rez, the opinion dated August 26, 2004\u00a0\u201clacks the formality established in a tax administrative proceeding-,\u201d2 9 Therefore,\u00a0said opinion \"may be elaborated on, modified, annulled, or revoked at any time by the\u00a0GDR, even after its contents are made known to the inquiring party.\u201d216\n529. \u00a0Mr. Julio Ledezma, witness for the Claimants, stated that \u201cthe opinion of August 26,\u00a02004 issued by the Director of the GDR is not binding per se.\u201d21x\n530. \u00a0\u00a0The Arbitral Tribunal agrees with such opinions and therefore concludes that the\u00a0opinion at issue dated August 26, was not binding on the GDR, and that the GDR\n265 Claimants\u2019 PHM, \u00a7 8.\n266 Claimants\u2019 PHM, \u00a7 83.\n267 Reply, \u00a7 141.\n268 R-83.\n269 Franco P\u00e9rez\u2019s Report, \u00a7 15.\n270 Franco P\u00e9rez\u2019s Report, \u00a731.\n271 Ledezma\u2019s Statement II, \u00a7 8.\n88\nCase 8:12-cv-01647-EAK-MAP Document 3-6 Filed 07/24/12 Page 4 of 44 PageID 234\nchanged its initial opinion through the subsequent opinion issued on January 27, 2005, which did not result in a breach of applicable Panamanian law since the opinion\u00a0of 2004 was never final and binding, and there was always a chance that it be validly\u00a0modified.\nb. Legitimate Expectations\n531. \u00a0Neither does the Arbitral Tribunal believe that the opinion issued on August 26, 2004\u00a0could have created legitimate expectations for Claimants.\n532. \u00a0\u00a0In the first place, it should be established that the opinion does not make any specific\u00a0reference to the Claimants, or to their indirect investments. The opinion makes\u00a0reference to the hypothesis of an issuance of bonds by Banco Disa and to the\u00a0possibility that such bank, or the taxpayers who acquired the bonds issued by the\u00a0bank, will be entitled to the tax credits. Therefore, based on such opinion Claimants\u00a0could not have formed any legitimate expectations that COPESA could issue bonds\u00a0carrying said credits. Let alone could Claimants have formed the legitimate\u00a0expectation that they would have the possibility of transferring their tax credits to\u00a0potential buyers of shares of stock.\n533. \u00a0\u00a0Second, it is evident that Mrs. Herbruger did not understand the inquiry presented on\u00a0August 17, 2004 by COPESA.272 Indeed, the communication sent by COPESA\u00a0indicated that \u201cthe purpose of our inquiry is that buyers of corporate bonds to be\u00a0issued may be entitled to the benefits that Law 28 of June 20, 1995 grants to indirect\u00a0investments\u201d Evidently, the communication referred to COPESA as the issuing\u00a0entity, and not Banco Disa. As expressly confirmed by witnesses at the\u00a0hearings,273 Banco Disa could not issue said bonds in 2005 since it was undergoing\u00a0liquidation proceedings.274 The entity that intended to issue the bonds was\u00a0COPESA. Those who were supposed to benefit from the tax credits were the buyers\u00a0of the bonds.\n534. \u00a0\u00a0On the contrary, Mrs. Herbruger assumed that the entity that would issue the bonds was\u00a0Banco Disa: \u201cThis office finds no legal restrictions for the reclassification of\u00a0COPESA\u2019s direct investment credit as indirect investment credit, so that it may be\u00a0used by other taxpayers acquiring bonds issued by Banco Disa (or any other\u00a0financial institution exercising the bank\u2019s rights) for the purpose of recovering the\u00a0bank\u2019s investment L.,] or otherwise, in any case, so that it may be applied by Banco\u00a0Disa as credit for an indirect investment made by the bank through an issue of other\u00a0securities.\u201d\n535. \u00a0\u00a0So, it is clear that Mrs. Herbruger failed to understand COPESA\u2019s inquiry, which\u00a0might explain why she provided an erroneous answer. In this regard, it is worth\n272 R-108.\n273 Transcripts pp. 444:15, 1518:8, 1608:21, 1630:3, 1761:3.\n274 Memorial, \u00a7 28.\n89\nCase 8:12-cv-01647-EAK-MAP Document 3-6 Filed 07/24/12 Page 5 of 44 PageID 235\nmentioning that all witnesses and experts examined at the hearings agreed that Banco Disa acted as financing entity in the framework of a loan, and never as a direct or\u00a0indirect investor.275\n536. \u00a0\u00a0Therefore, since the factual premises on which the inquiry was founded were\u00a0erroneous, the Arbitral Tribunal concludes that Claimants could not have had any\u00a0legitimate expectations from the document, with regard to the possibility of\u00a0transferring tax credits to third parties in the framework of an issuance of bonds, or a\u00a0sale of shares, by COPESA.\n537. \u00a0\u00a0Given the uncertainty resulting from the errors contained in the inquiry, if Claimants\u00a0intended to make certain that the transaction in question was feasible, they should\u00a0have requested a formal resolution from the GDR to confirm the feasibility thereof.\n7. Analysis of the Legal Framework Regarding the Alleged Tax Credits\n538. \u00a0First, the Arbitral Tribunal shall examine the arguments presented by Respondent\u00a0whereby (a) Claimants failed to prove that they invested in specific infrastructure\u00a0works as prescribed by Law 28, (b) Claimants failed to make direct investments in\u00a0COPESA\u2019s Treasury, (c) the alleged investments were made in kind; and finally, (d)\u00a0the investment was not credited pursuant to the provisions of Law 28.\n539. \u00a0\u00a0Next, the Arbitral Tribunal shall analyze whether the tax credits alleged by Claimants\u00a0could have been transferred, (e) both in the context of a possible issue of COPESA\u2019s\u00a0bonds, (f) and of a planned sale of shares.\n540. \u00a0Finally, (g) the Arbitral Tribunal shall examine the effects of Law 6 enacted in 2005\u00a0regarding the Claimants\u2019 alleged tax credits.\nc. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Alleged Requirement for Proof of Investment in Specific\nInfrastructure Works\n541. \u00a0\u00a0With regard to Mr. Ledezma\u2019s statement,276 Respondent holds that Claimants failed\u00a0to prove their investment in the plant, thus breaching the provisions of Law 28.277\n542. \u00a0\u00a0The Arbitral Tribunal does not share this view.\n543. \u00a0\u00a0First, the Arbitral Tribunal has already determined that there is sufficient proof of the\u00a0existence of contributions made to the Copesa Plant to enable Claimants to invoke the\u00a0protection provided for under the BIT.278 The same factual conclusions apply to the\u00a0discussion on Claimants\u2019 rights as to their tax credits.\n275 Transcripts, pp. 498:7 etseq.', 924:11 etseq., 1630:22 etseq.', 1676:15 et seq., 1756:19 et seq.\n276 Transcripts, p. 829:8 et seq.\n277 Respondent\u2019s PHM, \u00a7 30.\n278 Ut supra, \u00a7 455.\n90\nCase 8:12-cv-01647-EAK-MAP Document 3-6 Filed 07/24/12 Page 6 of 44 PageID 236  \n544.\n  \nSecond, Law 28 does i \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0.\ninvestment.

Contributions in Kind\n  \n547.\n  \n548.\n  \nUsing Mr. Alem\u00e1n\u2019s statement as support for its theory,281 Respondent also holds that contributions in kind may not constitute indirect investments under Law 28.282\nThe argument presented by Mr. Alem\u00e1n is founded on Executive Decree 274, Article 123(e), Paragraph (e). Indeed, the rule provides that for an indirect investment\u00a0credit to be applicable, the taxpayer must obtain a certification from the company\u00a0issuing the securities as evidence of \u201creceipt of the investment funds.\u201d According to\u00a0Respondent, that is the proof why contributions in kind may not result in tax credits\u00a0under Law 28.\n  \n549.\n  \n550.\n  \n551.\n  \nClaimants reply that the term \u201cfund\u201d as used in said provision refers to the value of a contribution and, therefore, may refer to contributions in kind.\nIn this regard, the Arbitral Tribunal considers that Respondent\u2019s interpretation of Article 123(e), Paragraph (e) of Executive Decree 274 seems too formal, since it is\u00a0customary for business organizations to make contributions in kind and it is not clear\u00a0why Panamanian law would have sought to exclude any such form of investment.\nHowever, it must be acknowledged that the rule in question is not clear. In this case Claimants should have also requested the necessary clarifications from the GDR with\u00a0regard to their alleged indirect investment tax credits.\n  \n552.\n  \nNevertheless, the Arbitral Tribunal does not need any further analysis on the matter. Indeed, Claimants never requested the application of their alleged tax credits, and it is\u00a0undisputed that Respondent never deprived them of their right to do so.\n279 C-8 (a); C-8 (b), C-26 (g).\n280 Respondent\u2019s PHM, \u00a7 30.\n281 Transcripts, p. 1.668:14 etseq.\n282 Respondent\u2019s PHM, \u00a7 30.\n91\nCase 8:12-cv-01647-EAK-MAP Document 3-6 Filed 07/24/12 Page 7 of 44 PageID 237  \n553.\n  \n554.\n  \nActually, the dispute between the parties focuses on the issue of the transferability of credits to third parties, and not on the use of the credits by the Claimants. As\u00a0explained below, the Arbitral Tribunal has reached the conclusion that Claimants had\u00a0no right to transfer their tax credits to third parties.\nTherefore, the discussion on the possibility for Claimants\u2019 to benefit from tax credits for investments made in kind is not relevant to this arbitration proceeding.\n  \nf Lack of Investment Certifications\n  \n555.\n  \nRespondent contends that Claimants failed to comply with the requirement of due certification and recognition of their investments through a resolution issued by the\u00a0GDR.283\n  \n556.\n  \nThe Arbitral Tribunal does not share this view.\n  \n557.\n  \nWith regard to the certification requirement, Executive Decree 274 establishes, first, that any taxpayer seeking to apply tax credits should submit a certification-statement\u00a0issued by a certified public accountant (Article 123(c)). Second, that investors, in\u00a0case of indirect investment, should submit a certification issued by the issuing\u00a0company (Article 123(d)(e)).\n  \n558.\n  \nOn the one hand, these two requirements are not preconditions for entitlement to tax credits. They are requirements that should be fulfilled upon application of the credit,\u00a0and for purposes of subsequent verification by the GDR. It is undisputed that\u00a0Claimants never applied their alleged tax credits to their income tax returns; hence\u00a0they did not have to comply with such requirements. On the other hand, the\u00a0Claimants\u2019 alleged indirect investments have been certified by Mr. Teodomiro Pino\u00a0Mendieta and Mrs. Hazel Jaramillo.284\n  \n559.\n  \nWith regard to the alleged need to obtain a resolution from the GDR in order to benefit from the credits, neither Law 28 nor Executive Decree 274 establishes that\u00a0investors should require a ruling from the GDR in order to invoke the credits, and\u00a0therefore the argument is groundless.\n  \n560.\n  \nHaving settled the aforementioned issues, the Arbitral Tribunal shall now proceed to examine, in view of Panamanian tax law, whether the tax credits resulting from the\u00a0investment could be transferred to third parties by way of an issuance of bonds or sale\u00a0of shares of stock.\n  \n561.\n  \nIn addition to the aforementioned explanation, that the GDR validly modified the opinion initially expressed on August 26, 2004 to a subsequent opinion given on\n  \n283 Counter-Memorial, \u00a7 480, 481.\n284 C-8 (a); C-8 (b); C-26 (g).\n  \n92\n  \nCase 8:12-cv-01647-EAK-MAP Document 3-6 Filed 07/24/12 Page 8 of 44 PageID 238\nJanuary 27, 2005, the Arbitral Tribunal, from its own analysis of applicable law, concludes that tax credits are not transferable.\ng. The Planned Issuance of Bonds by COPESA\n562. \u00a0It is undisputed that the issuance of bonds planned by COPESA in 1998 could not be\u00a0carried out for reasons unrelated to the Respondent.\n563. \u00a0The issue in this arbitration is whether in 2004 or 2005 COPESA would have been\u00a0able to issue bonds carrying the Claimants\u2019 alleged tax credits.\n564. \u00a0\u00a0In this regard, the Arbitral Tribunal deems it is necessary to make a distinction, based\u00a0on the nature of the tax credits that allegedly would have been available to the buyers\u00a0of the bonds.\n565. \u00a0\u00a0With regard to this matter, Claimants allege that the bonds issued in 2005 could have\u00a0carried COPESA\u2019s tax credits in connection with the direct investment in the plant.\n566. \u00a0\u00a0Claimants hold that COPESA\u2019s direct investment tax credits could have been turned\u00a0into indirect investment tax credits, since the \u201ctax credits are not classified until a\u00a0direct or indirect credit is applied to an existing cash tax obligation.\"2\\*5\n567. \u00a0\u00a0Claimants also hold that \u201cthe bonds to be issued by Copesa in 2004 were part of the\u00a0original transaction considered in 1998,\" and therefore \u201cthe holder of the bond would\u00a0be entitled to the tax credit.\"2\\*6\n568. \u00a0\u00a0The Arbitral Tribunal does not share Claimants\u2019 analysis.\n569. \u00a0It is undisputed that the tax credits available to COPESA by reason of the investment\u00a0made in the acquisition of the plant with Banco Disa\u2019s funding are, indeed, direct\u00a0investment tax credits.287\n570. \u00a0In this respect, Article 702 (d)(6), Paragraph 1, Tax Code, as amended by Section 6 of\u00a0Law 28, establishes that the direct investment tax credit \u201cmay not be the object of\u00a0compensation or assignment. \u201d\n571. \u00a0\u00a0It is undisputed, and Claimants agree, that the terms \u201ccompensation\" and\u00a0\u201cassignment\" include the hypothesis of a transfer to third parties.\n572. \u00a0\u00a0Therefore, the provision clearly bans the transfer of COPESA\u2019s direct investment tax\u00a0credits.\n285 Reply, \u00a7 149.\n286 Claimants\u2019 PHM, \u00a7 59.\n287 Transcripts, p. 784:10 etseq:, 1676:14 et seq.\n93\nCase 8:12-cv-01647-EAK-MAP Document 3-6 Filed 07/24/12 Page 9 of 44 PageID 239\n573. \u00a0\u00a0Therefore, the Arbitral Tribunal concludes that the law clearly establishes the\u00a0principle of non-transferability of direct investment tax credits. Claimants\u2019\u00a0interpretation would deprive the rule of all meaning by allowing the transfer of direct\u00a0investment tax credits by their holders to third parties by way of an issuance of bonds.\n574. \u00a0As to the possibility for holders of bonds issued in 2004 or 2005 to be entitled to\u00a0indirect investment tax credits by reason of their contributions through the value of\u00a0said bonds, the provision under Paragraph 3 of Article702 (d) (6) of the Tax Code\u00a0would apply, pursuant to which the funded work and the commencement of the\u00a0pertaining activities must be executed \u201cin the fiscal year following the year of the\u00a0indirect investment, at the latest. \u201d\n575. \u00a0\u00a0The meaning of the provision is clear. It establishes that the financing that benefits\u00a0from tax credits must occur prior to, and not subsequent to, the execution of the\u00a0works, in this case the construction of the Copesa Plant.\n576. \u00a0Therefore, it would have been impossible for a contribution of funds made by way of\u00a0a bond issuance in 2004 or 2005 - that is, six or seven years after the construction of\u00a0the plant - to benefit from the tax credits provided under Law 28.\n577. \u00a0\u00a0Claimants\u2019 approach in this respect, that the requirement specified in Paragraph 3\u00a0. would be satisfied because the bonds that COPESA would have issued in 2004 or\n2005 \u201cwere part of the original transaction intended in 1998\u201d2S\\* is groundless.\n578. \u00a0\u00a0It is clear that the subscription for bonds by third parties in 2004 or 2005 would have\u00a0been an operation different from the acquisition of the plant by COPESA by means of\u00a0a bank financing in 1998. Executive Decree 274, Article 123(d) makes a clear\u00a0distinction between direct and indirect investments. In the case of contributions made\u00a0by the buyers of bonds, it is an indirect investment in terms of Article 123(d)(a). In\u00a0the case of the acquisition of a plant through bank financing, it is a direct investment\u00a0in terms of Article 123 (d)(b).\n579. \u00a0Based on the foregoing, the Arbitral Tribunal concludes that COPESA would not\u00a0have been able to transfer its direct investment tax credits to third parties by way of\u00a0an issuance of bonds in 2004 or 2005, and that the buyers of said bonds would not\u00a0have been able to benefit from indirect investment tax credits.\nh. The Sale of Shares Planned by the Claimants\n580. \u00a0According to the theory presented by Claimants, they would have been able to sell\u00a0their shares of stock in COPESA to third parties in 2005, and said shares would have\u00a0carried their indirect investment tax credits.\n581. \u00a0Claimants admit that such a hypothesis would not have applied to COPESA shares\u00a0issued after June 1999, when Law 28 was repealed by Law 20: \u201cthe subsequent\n288 Claimants\u2019 PHM, \u00a7 59.\n94\nCase 8:12-cv-01647-EAK-MAP Document 3-6 Filed 07/24/12 Page 10 of 44 PageID 240\nNations [June 1999] do not benefit from tax credits because they were not issued together with an investment made prior to June 1999.\u201d239\n582. \u00a0\u00a0In addition, the Arbitral Tribunal considers that the indirect investment tax credits,\u00a0which allegedly could have been transferred with Claimants\u2019 original COPESA\u00a0shares, would not have included the value of the direct investment made by COPESA\u00a0(essentially the amount financed by Banco Disa) and would have been limited to the\u00a0contributions made by Claimants in COPESA. Indeed, any view to the contrary\u00a0would imply admitting the reclassification of direct investment tax credits into\u00a0indirect investment tax credits, which, as explained above, is not possible.\n583. \u00a0\u00a0Respondent objects to the possibility that Claimants may transfer the alleged tax\u00a0credits by selling their COPESA shares on the grounds that (f.a.) the indirect\u00a0investment tax credits were not transferable, and (f.b.) the depreciation of the plant by\u00a0COPESA prevented Claimants from being entitled to the tax credits.\nf-a- With Regard to the Transferability of Indirect Investment Tax Credits\n584. \u00a0Respondent contends that the non-transferability rule provided in Paragraph 1 of\u00a0Article 702 (d) (6), Tax Code, as amended by Article 6, Law 28, applies to direct as\u00a0well as indirect investment tax credits.\n585. \u00a0However, Law 28 seems to establish a difference between the regime applicable to\u00a0direct investment tax credits and indirect investment tax credits.\n586. \u00a0\u00a0In this respect, the rule set forth by Paragraph 1 above explicitly refers to direct\u00a0investment tax credits, and the law does not expressly prohibit the transfer of indirect\u00a0investment tax credits.\n587. \u00a0\u00a0Nevertheless, neither the Law, nor the Executive Decree establish the transferability\u00a0of indirect investment tax credits. As Claimants argue, stating that the purpose of\u00a0Law 28 was to attract foreign investments is not enough to conclude with certainty\u00a0that tax credits were transferable.290\n588. \u00a0\u00a0Certainly, there is a significant degree of uncertainty regarding the subject.\u00a0Claimants themselves have produced the brochure of the intended 2005 bond\u00a0issuance, where potential buyers are informed that indirect investment tax credits\u00a0could not be transferred or be the object of any assignment.291 The experts who\u00a0provided assessment to COPESA seemed to have had their doubts as well292.\n289 Memorial, \u00a7 18.\nReply, \u00a7 148 et seq.\n(i) Law 28 enacted in June 20, 1995 grants investors who make indirect investments in power generation companies a tax credit for the total amount of their investment, (ii) The aforementioned tax credit may not be\u00a0transferred, nor be the object of any compensation or assignment. \" (Emphasis added.)

The terms \u201call taxpayers\u201d seems to refer to the\u00a0initial beneficiaries of the credits.\n594. \u00a0\u00a0In addition, neither Law 28 nor Executive Decree 274 contain any provisions\u00a0establishing that indirect investment tax credits would be automatically added to the\u00a0negotiable instruments issued at the time of the investment, so that they could be\u00a0jointly transferred. Mr. Ledezma himself admitted at the hearing that there is no\u00a0case law or precedent in that regard in Panama.294\n595. \u00a0\u00a0The Arbitral Tribunal concludes that tax credits are personal, and that there is no\u00a0principle of transferability of tax credits under Panamanian law for indirect\u00a0investments. Had Panamanian law intended to establish a mechanism for tax credits\u00a0to be incorporated to negotiable instruments - in order to credits to be automatically\u00a0transferred to the buyers thereof - it would have done so, including, like it did with\u00a0other aspects of the regime for the application and use of credits, detailed provisions\u00a0to safeguard the supervisory authority of the GDR.\n292 In this respect, Paul Smith\u2019s report reads as follows: \u201cPega [counsel for Price Waterhouse Coopers]\u00a0expressed his opinion that the transferability of the tax credits to third-party buyers of the instruments was\u00a0not feasible under the existing laws and regulations, and therefore, PWC could not recommend the purchase\u00a0to the firm\u2019s customers. \u201d (C-27, p. 4).\n293 Transcript p. 1747.\n294 Transcripts p. 1747.\n96\nCase 8:12-cv-01647-EAK-MAP Document 3-6 Filed 07/24/12 Page 12 of 44 PageID 242\n596. \u00a0Based on the foregoing, the Arbitral Tribunal concludes that Law 28 and Executive\u00a0Decree 274 do not allow for the transfer of indirect investment tax credits.\nf.b. With Regard to the Depreciation of the Copesa Plant\n597. \u00a0Respondent contends that COPESA\u2019s decision to depreciate the value of the plant\u00a0prevented in every way the use of the tax credits by Claimants; and therefore, their\u00a0transfer to third parties.295 On the contrary, Claimants are of the opinion that \u201cthe\u00a0depreciation of certain assets by Copesa does not extinguish its rights or those of\u00a0Claimants to use the tax credits. Instead, the law establishes that taxpayers should\u00a0not depreciate an asset and request a tax credit during the same fiscal year. \u201d296\n598. \u00a0\u00a0In this respect, the Arbitral Tribunal considers that Article 702 (6), Paragraph 4, Tax\u00a0Code applies to tax credits for direct investments as well as for tax credits for indirect\u00a0investments.\n599. \u00a0\u00a0Indeed, the rule refers to the tax credits \u201cin this paragraph\u201d, referring to Article 702,\u00a0Paragraph (d), which provision applies to tax credits for direct as well as for indirect\u00a0investments.\n600. \u00a0However, this does not mean that the shareholders of a company exercising its right\u00a0to depreciate assets would never be entitled to their tax credits. What the rule says is\u00a0that a taxpayer who applies a tax credit may not, during the same year, deduct as an\u00a0expense the depreciation of the plant in order to determine its net taxable income.\n601. \u00a0\u00a0Given that the rule applies to tax credits for direct investments as well as for indirect\u00a0investments, it must be concluded that Claimants would not have been able to benefit\u00a0from the tax credits since, in that same year, COPESA chose to depreciate the assets\u00a0acquired by means of the indirect investments.\n602. \u00a0\u00a0In the case at hand, it is undisputed that COPESA depreciated the Copesa Plant every\u00a0fiscal year from 1998 to 2006.\n603. \u00a0\u00a0Therefore, even if it were admitted that tax credits were transferable, it is true that the\u00a0potential buyers of the shares in 2005 would not have been able to benefit from the\u00a0credits neither in 2005 nor in 2006. This would have affected to some extent the sale\u00a0of the securities since, as stated on record, the advantage of such operation laid on the\u00a0immediate application of the credits. Claimants highlight this in their Memorial,\u00a0asserting that \u201cFor potential bond buyers to be able to claim the indirect tax credits\u00a0against income taxes payable in the fiscal year 2004, it was essential that the closing\u00a0occur prior to March 31, 2005.\u201d\n604. \u00a0\u00a0The first conclusion to be drawn by the Arbitral Tribunal is that, either way, it would\u00a0not have been possible to carry out the sale of shares planned for 2005 or 2006.

In this respect, it is worth noting that the internal report\u00a0prepared by Mr. Paul Smith on his attempts to sell the shares indicates that the\u00a0potential interest of the contacted companies seems to have been the immediate\u00a0application of tax credits297. It is also worth noting that none of these companies\u00a0issued a firm confirmation with regard to their interest in the purchase.\n605. \u00a0\u00a0With regard to subsequent years, there is no evidence that COPESA failed to\u00a0depreciate the plant, nor that the planned sale of shares would have been successfully\u00a0carried out.\n606. \u00a0\u00a0To sum up, it is the Arbitral Tribunal\u2019s opinion that (i) the tax credits are not\u00a0transferable; and that (ii) even if the credits had been transferable, it is highly unlikely\u00a0that the intended sale of shares would have been carried out. Since the credits are not\u00a0transferable, this second aspect, however, is irrelevant.\ni. Law 6 Is Enacted in 2005\n607. \u00a0Article 9, Law 6 of 2005, in the introductory paragraph provides as follows:\n\u201cTaxpayers who intend to use any tax credits applicable to income tax pursuant to Article 6 of Law 28 of 1995 shall inform the General Directorate of Revenue\u00a0of the amount and origin of the credit within 180 calendar days following the\u00a0effective date of this law. The General Directorate of Revenue shall determine\u00a0the validity of any such credits, in accordance with the parameters\u00a0established by the law that created them. Taxpayers who fail to comply with\u00a0the information requirement within the term established above, or those whose\u00a0credits have been declared invalid, shall not be entitled to the use of the\u00a0declared credit. \u201d\n608. \u00a0It is worth remembering that Law 20 of June 23, 1999 repealed Article 6 of Law 28\u00a0of 1995. However, the parties agree that Law 20 did not have retroactive effects and\u00a0did not suppress the tax credits for previously made investments.298\n609. \u00a0\u00a0It is also worth noting that Law 54 of July 22, 1998 created a tax stability regime for\u00a0investors who met the registration requirement with the entity promoting and\u00a0supervising investments, namely, the National Directorate of Industries and Business\u00a0Development of the Ministry of Commerce and Industry.\n610. \u00a0\u00a0Pursuant to Article 8 of Law 54, the registration had to take place within 6 months of\u00a0the date of enactment.\n297 C-27.\n298 Transcripts, 1680:11; 1808:03.\n98\nCase 8:12-cv-01647-EAK-MAP Document 3-6 Filed 07/24/12 Page 14 of 44 PageID 244\n611. \u00a0\u00a0Therefore, Law 6 only affected investors who made their investments prior to June\u00a01999, and who did not benefit from the protection of Law 54 (given that the rights of\u00a0those investors survived Law 20 but did not benefit from tax stability). On the other\u00a0hand, investors who sought protection under Law 54 were not adversely affected by\u00a0either Law 20 or Law 6.\n612. \u00a0Respondent holds that Claimants failed to meet the declaration requirement under\u00a0Law 6,299 and thus their tax credits were extinguished by operation of law.\n613. \u00a0\u00a0Claimants did not exactly dispute this issue. In their Memorial, Claimants only\u00a0mentioned that \u201cPaul Smith, Claimants\u2019 trading agent, sent a communication to\u00a0Mirones dated March 28, 2005 pursuant to certain new requirements under\u00a0Law 6.\u201d300\n614. \u00a0Hence, Claimants only hold, on the one hand, that they were protected by COPESA\u2019s\u00a0registration under Law 54, and that Law 6 is an expropriating act in itself, on the\u00a0other.\n615. \u00a0\u00a0However, this discussion is completely irrelevant to the arbitration.\n616. \u00a0\u00a0Indeed, the Arbitral Tribunal has already concluded, regardless of the effects of\u00a0Law 6, that Claimants\u2019 indirect investment tax credits were not transferable.\u00a0Therefore, Law 6 could not have caused the alleged failure of the issuance of bonds,\u00a0or the assignment of shares that had been intended due to the non-transferability of\u00a0the credits.\n617. \u00a0\u00a0Regarding the possibility to apply tax credits directly, Claimants did not hold that\u00a0they had been wrongfully deprived. Indeed, Claimants\u2019 theory is not based on the\u00a0fact that they were deprived of their tax credits, but on the fact that they were\u00a0deprived of the possibility to transfer those credits to a third party - which allegedly\u00a0caused the planned sale of shares or issuance of bonds to fail.\n618. \u00a0\u00a0Claimants never applied their indirect investment tax credits directly, nor did they\u00a0request that it be done. Therefore, it is pointless to analyze in the framework of the\u00a0arbitration whether it would still be possible for them to do it, and whether a possible\u00a0denial by the Panamanian tax authority to recognize the tax credits could be\u00a0considered illegitimate.\n619. \u00a0\u00a0The international liability of a State for breach of obligations under the BIT cannot be\u00a0justified hypothetical assumptions, but on real situations and proven illegitimate acts.\u00a0As explained below, none of the facts that Claimants allege may be qualified as such.\n8.

Claimants also allege that (c) Panama, through its judiciary,\u00a0took \u201carbitrary and unfair measures against COPESA in an attempt to impair the\u00a0rights of Claimants against Respondent or otherwise cause the commercial closing of\u00a0COPESA.\u201d30' Finally, (d) Claimants complain that Law 6 violated the State\u2019s\u00a0international obligations.\n622. \u00a0\u00a0The Arbitral Tribunal shall analyze each of these allegations before examining\u00a0whether (e) under the law, Respondent\u2019s allegedly illegitimate denial to recognize the\u00a0transferability of tax credits could qualify as expropriation in terms of the BIT.\na. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0DGR\u2019s Opinion dated January 27, 2005\n623. \u00a0\u00a0This matter has already been addressed ut supra 302 The Arbitral Tribunal concluded\u00a0that the August 26, 2004 GRD opinion was not binding, it did not vest Claimants with\u00a0any rights, and, in addition to being evidently erroneous, it could be modified at any\u00a0time by the GDR.\nb. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Vice-Minister Mirones\u2019 actions\n624. \u00a0\u00a0There is evidence on file that Mirones acknowledges having taken several actions to\u00a0inform the banks involved in the planned issuance of bonds by COPESA that \u201cas a\u00a0general rule, any alleged tax credit had to be certified and recognized by the GDR, and\u00a0that such certification have not been issued in the case of Copesa.\u201d303\n625. \u00a0Mirones also admits having contacted Price Waterhouse Coopers, involved in the\u00a0planned sale of COPESA stock, in order to inform the that, as a general rule, tax\u00a0credits had to be recognized through a resolution issued by the GDR, that they may\u00a0not be transferred, and that in this particular case, an issuance of bonds or shares in\u00a02005 could not benefit from Law 28 since Law 28 had been repealed.304\n626. \u00a0Additionally, Claimants allege that, at a meeting held on February 24, 2005 with\u00a0COPESA representatives, Mirones acknowledged that the disputed tax credits were\nMemorial, \u00a7 78.\n302 Ut supra, \u00a7 530.\n303 Mirones\u2019 Statement I, \u00a7 32.\n304 Mirones\u2019 Statement I, \u00a7 69.\n100\nCase 8:12-cv-01647-EAK-MAP Document 3-6 Filed 07/24/12 Page 16 of 44 PageID 246\ntransferrable.305 However, in his testimony Mirones denied having made such statement.306\n627. \u00a0Nevertheless, the Arbitral Tribunal does not consider the alleged actions of Mirones\u00a0to be relevant to the settlement of this dispute.\n628. \u00a0\u00a0In effect, said actions could only justify the claims if it had been proven that\u00a0Claimants effectively had the right to transfer their alleged tax credits by way of an\u00a0issuance of bonds by COPESA or a sale of their COPESA shares.\n629. \u00a0Now, the Arbitral Tribunal has already determined that under Panamanian law\u00a0Claimants could not transfer the tax credits by way of the planned issuance of\u00a0bonds.307\n630. \u00a0Regarding the hypothesis of a sale of shares, the Arbitral Tribunal has reached the\u00a0conclusion that Panamanian law does not enable investors to transfer indirect\u00a0investment tax credits to potential buyers of shares of stock. In addition, even if it\u00a0were permitted by law, it has not been proven that, in the absence of Vice Minister\u00a0Mirones\u2019 actions, the shares of stock would have been successfully sold.\n631. \u00a0\u00a0Therefore, the Arbitral Tribunal concludes that the actions of Mirones lack relevance\u00a0to the resolution of this case.\nc. The Allegedly Arbitrary and Unfair Measures Taken by the\u00a0Judiciary of Panama\n632. \u00a0In their Memorial, Claimants alleged that Respondent \u201chas taken, through the\u00a0judiciary, arbitrary and unfair measures against COPESA in an attempt to impair\u00a0the rights of Claimants against Respondent or otherwise cause the commercial\u00a0closing of COPESA, \u201d308\n633. \u00a0\u00a0The argument is groundless.\n634. \u00a0\u00a0In effect, Claimants failed to identify the allegedly arbitrary and unfair measures\u00a0taken by the Panamanian judiciary. Assuming that they were referring to the judicial\u00a0decisions on COPESA\u2019s bankruptcy, there is not the slightest evidence that said\u00a0judicial decisions were contrary to Panamanian law, unfair or discriminatory, or\u00a0moved by the will to damage Claimants.\n305 Memorial, \u00a7 52.\n306 Transcripts, p. 1381:15 et seq.\n307 Ut supra, \u00a7 579.\n308 Memorial, \u00a7 78.\n101\nCase 8:12-cv-01647-EAK-MAP Document 3-6 Filed 07/24/12 Page 17 of 44 PageID 247\nd. Is Law 6 an Expropriating Law?\n635.\n  \nClaimants contend that Law 6 \u201czs tantamount to the expropriation of a previously vested right and constitutes a breach of the BIT and of Panamanian law.\u201d30\n636. Claimants explain that Law 6 \u201ctried to validate the expropriating actions that the\u00a0GDR and Vice Minister of Finance took before third parties, and before Copesa and\u00a0its shareholders. \u201d310\n637. In Claimants\u2019 opinion, they should not have been adversely affected by Law 6 \u201csince\u00a0Paragraph 46 of the Political Constitution of Panama, and Article 3 of the Civil Code\u00a0prohibit the retroactive application of a new law to the detriment of vested rights. In\u00a0addition, [Law 6] violates the rights of Copesa and its shareholders protected by\u00a0Law 54 of1999 (legal stability), and discriminates against companies such as Copesa\u00a0who failed to exercise their rights on the tax credits acquired under Law 28 of 1995,\u00a0as opposed to those companies which have already benefited from the same credits\u00a0under the same Law.\u201d311\n638. \u00a0\u00a0As explained above, the Arbitral Tribunal considers the discussion to be irrelevant.\u00a0The transfer of indirect investment tax credits is not permitted under Panamanian tax\u00a0law, regardless of Law 6.\n639. \u00a0Nevertheless, the Arbitral Tribunal shall proceed to examine the arguments presented\u00a0by Claimants whereby (d.a.) Law 6 breached the principle of non-retroactivity in\u00a0effect under Panamanian law, (d.b.) violated the principle of legal stability provided\u00a0for under Law 54, (d.c.) was of a discriminatory nature, and (d.d.) is tantamount to\u00a0an expropriation of Claimants\u2019 rights.\nd.a. With Regard to the Principle of Non-Retroactivity\n640. \u00a0Article 46 of the Panamanian Constitution of 2004 establishes that: \u201claws do not\u00a0have retroactive effects, except for social or public interest laws, when expressly\u00a0stated therein. \u201d Under Article 3 of the Civil Code, \u201claws shall not have retroactive\u00a0effect to the detriment of vested rights. \u201d\n641. \u00a0\u00a0Claimants contend that Law 6 is retroactive and, therefore, in breach of the\n\"\u00ee 12\nPanamanian Constitution.\n642. The Arbitral Tribunal does not share this opinion and considers that Law 6 does not\u00a0have retroactive effects since its purpose is not to revoke vested rights and it only\u00a0applied to the future.\n309 Claimants\u2019 PHM, \u00a7 70.\n310 Claimants\u2019 PHM, \u00a7 70, Footnote 121.\n3\" Claimants\u2019PHM, \u00a7 71.\n3,2 Claimants\u2019PHM, \u00a771.\n102\nCase 8:12-cv-01647-EAK-MAP Document 3-6 Filed 07/24/12 Page 18 of 44 PageID 248\n643. \u00a0Law 6 contains two provisions that might affect Claimants: first, a statement\u00a0requirement, and second, the reduction in the percentage of income tax against which\u00a0a tax credit may be applied.\n644. \u00a0\u00a0Said requirements only apply to the future, and shall not have the effect of\u00a0retroactively reducing or cancelling deductions already made on income tax for\u00a0previous years.\n645. \u00a0\u00a0Claimants\u2019 interpretation of the non-retroactivity principle would freeze the\u00a0Panamanian tax law, preventing the State from modifying its tax regime and thus\u00a0creating in fact a general regime of fiscal stability. However, the Republic of Panama\u00a0intended to subject its taxpayers to specific conditions, defined in Law 54, [and] the\u00a0possibility that they could enjoy similar fiscal stability.\n646. \u00a0\u00a0Actually, Claimants confuse the principle of non-retroactivity and the principle of\u00a0immediate effects of the new law for the future. The purpose of Law 6 is not to annul\u00a0retroactively vested rights, but to modify the conditions under which holders of\u00a0unused tax credits may apply such credits in the future.\n647. \u00a0Law 6 would have had retroactive effects, and therefore would have been contrary to\u00a0the Constitution, if it had included part of the deductions previously made in income\u00a0tax, or if it had cancelled said deductions for lack of the required statement, or if it\u00a0had annulled existing credits. This is not the case. Law 6 only affects the manner in\u00a0which credits may be used in future.\n648. \u00a0Therefore, the Arbitral Tribunal concludes that Law 6 is not in breach of the\u00a0Panamanian Constitution.\nd.b. With Regard to Law 54\n649. \u00a0\u00a0Claimants hold that Law 6 violates the rights of Claimants under Law 54 on\u00a0stability,313\n650. \u00a0This argument is unfounded since the Arbitral Tribunal considers that Claimants were\u00a0not protected by Law 54.\n651. \u00a0In this respect, it is undisputed that COPESA was duly registered under Law 54.\n652. \u00a0There is evidence on file of an Order dated September 14, 1999 whereby the National\u00a0Directorate of Industries and Business Development of Panama registered COPESA\u00a0with the Registry for the Legal Stability of Investments for a period of ten years.314\n653. \u00a0Under Claimants\u2019 theory, COPESA\u2019s registration under Law 54 protected their\u00a0shareholders with regard to the same investment: \u201cLow 54 was a tax stability law\n313 Claimants\u2019 PHM, \u00a7 71.\n3i4C-14.\n103\nCase 8:12-cv-01647-EAK-MAP Document 3-6 Filed 07/24/12 Page 19 of 44 PageID 249\nunder -which one could register an investment to help ensure that such investment -was not affected by any change in laws during a ten-year period. Copesa was duly\u00a0registered under Law 54. There was no requirement for Nations, EME or Jurado to\u00a0do the same. \u201d315\n654. \u00a0\u00a0Claimants further support their view alleging that either way they were not permitted\u00a0by Panamanian law to be registered under Law 54 \u201cbecause Copesa had already done\u00a0so,\u201d316 and consequently, the registration of the company would necessarily protect its\u00a0shareholders.\n655. \u00a0\u00a0On the contrary, Respondent contends that Claimants could have registered under\u00a0Law 54, and therefore may not invoke the protection of COPESA\u2019s registration.317\n656. \u00a0\u00a0Section 5 of Law 54 provides that \u201cthis tax stability regime applies to natural\u00a0persons or legal entities governed by private law, whether they are Panamanian\u00a0nationals or aliens, making investments within the national territory in order to carry\u00a0out the following activities: [ ...fpower generation. \u201d\n657. \u00a0\u00a0Section 8 of Law 54 establishes that \u201cin order to be entitled to the benefits granted\u00a0hereby, investors shall make their investments in accordance with the provisions of\u00a0the investment plan submitted to such effect, be duly registered with the entity\u00a0promoting and supervising the investments, if applicable, and fulfill the obligations\u00a0set forth in section 16 hereof. \u201d Under section 16 of Law 54, investors are required to\u00a0report certain information, including the amount of their investment.\n658. \u00a0\u00a0It is therefore clear that the registration only protects the reporting investor. Neither\u00a0Law 54 nor Executive Decree No. 9 establishes that the registration may serve to\u00a0protect subjects different from those registered as investment owners.\n659. \u00a0\u00a0This is expressly established in Paragraph 4 of Article 8 of Law 54, pursuant to which\u00a0investors \u201cshall be guaranteed the legal and tax stability regime they were entitled to\u00a0at the time of their registration as established in this section. \u201d This section excludes\u00a0the possibility for unregistered investors to fall under the protection of Law 54. In\u00a0this respect, the Arbitral Tribunal shares the analysis of Mr. Alem\u00e1n.318\n660. \u00a0The fact that Claimants were not protected by Law 54 is further confirmed by\u00a0Article 18 of Executive Decree 9, which provides that: \u201cin order to prohibit the\u00a0double registration of the same investment, neither natural persons nor legal entities\u00a0may be entitled to the benefits referred to in the Law of investments regarding\u00a0investments in companies that already have registered investments; or vice versa.\"\n315 Reply, \u00a7 146.\n3'6 Claimants\u2019 PHM, \u00a7 72.\n3,7 Respondent\u2019s PHM, \u00a7 33.\n318 Transcripts, pp. 857 and 858.\n104\nCase 8:12-cv-01647-EAK-MAP Document 3-6 Filed 07/24/12 Page 20 of 44 PageID 250\n661. \u00a0\u00a0The Arbitral Tribunal shares the analysis of Mr. Ledezma, expert for the Claimants,\u00a0according to which, in the case of an investment made by a company with funds of its\u00a0own (direct investment) as well as with contributions made by its shareholders\u00a0(indirect investment), only the reporting company, and not the shareholders, would be\u00a0entitled to legal stability under Law 54.319\n662. \u00a0\u00a0Therefore, the Arbitral Tribunal concludes that Claimants were not protected under\u00a0Law 54.\nd.c. The Alleged Discriminatory Aspect of Law 6\n663. \u00a0\u00a0The argument according to which Law 6 discriminates the companies that failed to\u00a0exercise their rights is groundless.\n664. \u00a0In effect, Claimants have not contributed any element that may lead the Arbitral\u00a0Tribunal to conclude that under Panamanian law it is illegal to modify the future\u00a0effects of existing conditions.\n665. \u00a0\u00a0In addition, the law in question is extensive, covering different aspects, and was\u00a0generally applied both to Panamanian nationals and foreign individuals, and there is\u00a0no evidence that it was drafted for the sole purpose of adversely affecting Claimants.\nd.d. The Alleged Expropriating Character of Law 6\n666. \u00a0\u00a0The Arbitral Tribunal considers that Law 6 does not have an expropriating character.\n667. \u00a0Regarding the requirement of a statement, the Arbitral Tribunal deems the 180-day\u00a0term established by the Law highly reasonable, enabling the holders of tax credits to\u00a0safeguard their rights without further complications.\n668. \u00a0In addition, the fulfillment of the statement requirement under Law 6 does not imply\u00a0any consequences regarding the possibility to transfer tax credits to third parties.\n669. \u00a0\u00a0The Arbitral Tribunal recalls its analysis, that said possibility did not exist under the\u00a0assumption of a bond issuance, nor has it been established under the assumption of a\u00a0sale of shares.\n670. \u00a0\u00a0Therefore, even if Claimants had declared their credits, the Panamanian tax authority\u00a0would have always been in a position to exercise its supervisory authority in order to\u00a0determine whether such credits existed and could be validly transferred to a third\u00a0party. This is expressly provided for under the introductory paragraph of Article 79\u00a0of Law 6, which establishes that, once the information requirement set forth by said\u00a0Article has been met, \u201cthe General Directorate of Revenue shall determine the\u00a0validity or invalidity of any such credits, in accordance with the parameters\n3,9 Transcripts, p. 1807:11.\n105\nCase 8:12-cv-01647-EAK-MAP Document 3-6 Filed 07/24/12 Page 21 of 44 PageID 251\nestablished by the law that created them. \u201d However, said provision does not make any additions to the current audit powers of the GDR under Law 28.320\n671. \u00a0Regarding the limited percentage of 5% of income tax against which tax credits may\u00a0be applied, this aspect of Law 6 (in addition to being totally irrelevant to the outcome\u00a0of this controversy, since Claimants never applied their tax credits) is not of an\u00a0expropriating nature either. In effect, as explained above, it is merely a mode of use\u00a0that does not affect the existence or the value of the credits.\ne. Characterization of the Alleged Facts as Expropriation\n672. \u00a0As previously stated, the Arbitral Tribunal has come to the conclusion that Claimants\u2019\u00a0tax credits could not be transferred to third parties by way of the planned issuance of\u00a0bonds or sale of shares of stock. Therefore, Claimants theory that Respondent\u00a0refusing to recognize such transferability is tantamount to an expropriation, is\u00a0factually unfounded.\n673. \u00a0\u00a0In law, and assuming that the credits had been transferable, the Arbitral Tribunal\u00a0considers that Respondent\u2019s acts, in any case, could not have constituted an indirect\u00a0expropriation in terms of Article IV of the BIT, which frames the jurisdiction of the\u00a0Arbitral Tribunal.\n674. \u00a0Article 4.1 of the BIT defines indirect expropriation as any measure \u201chaving an effect\u00a0equivalent to expropriation or nationalization. \u201d\n675. \u00a0However, the parties disagree as to the meaning of the term expropriation in terms of\u00a0the BIT.\n676. \u00a0In this respect, Claimants base their opinion on the Metalclad award,321 which\u00a0states that an indirect expropriation can be made through a covert or incidental\u00a0interference with the use of property, with the effect of depriving the owner, in whole\u00a0or in a significant part, of the use, or economic benefit, that can be reasonably\u00a0expected of the property.322\n677. \u00a0According to Respondent, an expropriation requires \u201cthat governmental measures\u00a0devaluate [the significant value of the investment] or otherwise deprive investors of\u00a0certain rights linked to the concept of ownership. \u201d In Respondent\u2019s opinion, \u201cthe\u00a0hypothetical \u2018right \u2019 of Claimants to transfer the alleged tax credits in connection with\u00a0the issuance of bonds is not the essential type of ownership feature which might give\u00a0right to a claim for expropriation. \u201d323\n320 Mirones\u2019 Statement, \u00a7 49; Transcripts, pp. 1465:11; 1501:9; The supervisory powers of the Panamanian Tax\u00a0Authority are described in the inquiry presented to the GDR on August 26, 2004, penultimate paragraph (R-l 10).\n321 CAL-5, \u00a7 103.\n322 Claimants\u2019 PHM, \u00a7 77.\n323 Rejoinder, \u00a7 86.\n106\nCase 8:12-cv-01647-EAK-MAP Document 3-6 Filed 07/24/12 Page 22 of 44 PageID 252\n678. \u00a0In its Post-Hearing Memorial, Respondent alleges that the expropriation should lead\u00a0to a ''substantial loss in the economic value\u201d of the investment.324 Therefore, the\u00a0Arbitral Tribunal understands that, according to the theory presented by Respondent,\u00a0an expropriation in terms of Article IV of the BIT should deprive the investor of an\u00a0essential ownership attribute, resulting in a substantial loss in the economic value of\u00a0its investment.\n679. \u00a0The BIT does not define what is meant by expropriation under its Article IV. The\u00a0Arbitral Tribunal considers that, in the context of this proceeding, the concept of\u00a0expropriation in terms of Article IV of the BIT should be defined based on a\u00a0systematic interpretation, in the light of the object and purpose of the treaty.325\n680. \u00a0\u00a0First, it is important, for the definition of expropriation to be legal, not to confuse the\u00a0definition of expropriation with the requirements set forth by Article IV. 1 (especially,\u00a0the existence of social or public interest motives and the non-discriminatoiy character\u00a0of the expropriating act). These requirements only apply if it is concluded that there\u00a0was an expropriation, or a measure tantamount to expropriation, but the absence of\u00a0one or more requirements does not indicate the presence of expropriation.326\n681. \u00a0\u00a0Therefore, the fact that the measures the State was reproached for were not adopted\u00a0for public interest reasons or were discriminatory would not be enough to represent\u00a0an expropriation.\n682. \u00a0\u00a0The BIT makes a distinction between the obligation to grant fair and equitable\u00a0treatment to investments (Article II.2) and the protection against expropriations\u00a0(Article IV. 1). As previously decided, the Arbitral Tribunal has jurisdiction\u00a0regarding a possible indirect expropriation but not regarding claims in connection\u00a0with the State\u2019s obligation to grant investors fair and equitable treatment.\n683. \u00a0\u00a0Therefore, the Arbitral Tribunal considers that the definition given to the concept of\u00a0expropriation in the case at hand should not lead to the elimination of such\u00a0distinction. If it was admitted that any impairment of the proprietary interests of\u00a0investors constitutes an expropriation, the exclusion provided for under Article XI of\u00a0the BIT would be deprived of all meaning.\n684. \u00a0\u00a0Therefore, the Arbitral Tribunal considers that a measure tantamount to expropriation\u00a0should not only substantially affect the proprietary interests of investors, but also\u00a0deprive them, in whole or in part, of the use or possession of their property.\n685. \u00a0\u00a0In this respect, it is generally accepted that there is direct expropriation when an\u00a0investor has been effectively deprived of the administration, use of or control over its\n324 Respondent\u2019s PHM, \u00a7 27.\n325 Art. 31.1. of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, May 23, 1969.\n326 Fireman\u2019s Fund Insurance Company v.

Claimants were not deprived of the use or possession of\u00a0their stock at any time, nor were they deprived of the rights represented thereby or the\u00a0right to earn dividends. Neither were Claimants deprived of the right to apply their\u00a0tax credits directly. Finally, it was not proven that COPESA lost value due to the\u00a0allegedly illicit acts of the State.\n687. \u00a0\u00a0Therefore, even if it was admitted that Claimants were able to prove that Panamanian\u00a0tax law authorized them to transfer their tax credits (which is not the case) through\u00a0the sale of shares or the issuance of bonds, being deprived of such a possibility would\u00a0not represent being deprived of the possession, use of, or control over, their shares of\u00a0stock, or a significant alteration, equivalent to an expropriation, of the value of the\u00a0investment.\n688. \u00a0\u00a0Indeed, in this hypothetical case, the damage sustained by investors would only be\u00a0with regard to their original shares of stock, and to the extent of their personal\u00a0contributions to COPESA. Banco Disa\u2019s funding was a direct investment of\u00a0COPESA that could not result in the transfer of the corresponding tax credits.\n689. \u00a0\u00a0Furthermore, generally the transferability of tax credits associated with shares of\u00a0stock is an element highly incidental to the rights of the shareholder, the deprivation\u00a0of which may not constitute an expropriation in itself.\n690. \u00a0\u00a0Finally, with regard to Law 6, the Arbitral Tribunal has already concluded that it did\u00a0not have an expropriating character. Moreover, the Arbitral Tribunal considers that\u00a0the State is entitled to regulate the conditions under which it decides to grant tax\u00a0credits to investors.\n691. \u00a0\u00a0In the present case, the statement requirement was justified by the need to determine\u00a0who was considered a holder for the purpose of tax credit claims based on Law 28,\u00a0given the existence of some uncertainty in the aforementioned regulatory framework.\u00a0Such concern is not illegitimate.\n692. \u00a0\u00a0Whatever the case, even if Claimants had complied with the information requirement\u00a0under Law 6, it would not mean that GDR would have allowed them to transfer their\u00a0tax credits to a third party, as was their intention.

Said charges\u00a0were set at US$65,000.\n697. \u00a0\u00a0Furthermore, the amount for expenses incurred by ICSID in the proceeding (provide\u00a0rooms for the hearings and related services, mail, personnel expenses) is\u00a0US$157,021.78, which shall also be added to the aforementioned figure.\n698. \u00a0\u00a0Article 60(1) of the ICSID Convention establishes that the Arbitral Tribunal \u201cshall\u00a0determine the fees and expenses of its members, -within the limits established from\u00a0time to time by the Administrative Council and after consultation with the SecretaryGeneral. \u201d\n699. \u00a0After consultation with the Secretary-General, the Arbitral Tribunal determines the\u00a0fees and expenses of its members as follows:\n- Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Chill\u00f3n Medina: US$188,250 for fees, and US$13,105.77 for\u00a0expenses;\n- Claus von Wobeser: US$165,000 for fees, and US$14,431.54 for expenses;\n- Alexis Mourre: US$248,910 for fees, and US$25,265.09 for expenses. \u2019\nTotal Amount: US$654,962.40.\n700. \u00a0\u00a0With regard to the assistant to the Arbitral Tribunal, Mr. Bingen Amezaga, the\u00a0Arbitral Tribunal proposed to the parties, through an ICSID communication dated\n329 Rejoinder, \u00a7 432.\n109\nCase 8:12-cv-01647-EAK-MAP Document 3-6 Filed 07/24/12 Page 25 of 44 PageID 255\nJanuary 29, 2010, \u201cthat they would only be charged as administrative expenses for Mr. Amezaga\u2019s intervention, his air ticket (economy class) and accommodation, and\u00a0that the time allocated to hearings would not be billed.\u201d Claimants and Respondent\u00a0accepted the proposal on February 2 and 3, 2010, respectively.\n701. \u00a0Mr. Amezaga\u2019s transportation and accommodation expenses amount to US$6,107.32.\n702. \u00a0The total amount of ICSID charges and expenses, fees and expenses of the members\u00a0of the Arbitral Tribunal, and expenses of the assistant to the Arbitral Tribunal\u00a0(\u201carbitration costs\u201d) therefore amounts to US$883,091.50.\n703. \u00a0Article 61.2 of the ICSID Convention establishes that \u201cthe Tribunal shall, except as\u00a0the parties otherwise agree, assess the expenses incurred by the parties in connection\u00a0with the proceedings, and shall decide how and by whom those expenses, the fees and\u00a0expenses of the members of the Tribunal, and the charges for the use of the facilities\u00a0at the Centre shall be paid. Such decision shall be part of the award. \u201d\n704. \u00a0\u00a0On July 12, 2010 each party submitted their statement of procedural costs to the\u00a0Arbitral Tribunal.\n705. \u00a0For procedural costs Claimants claim the amount of US$1,798,289.56.\n706. \u00a0For procedural costs Respondent claims the amount of US$10,364,183.56.\n707. \u00a0Each party also requests that the other party be sentenced to bear all ICSID costs and\u00a0Arbitral Tribunal Fees.\n708. \u00a0\u00a0The Arbitral Tribunal\u2019s decision regarding costs is procedural in nature and is not\u00a0governed by the substantive law applicable to the merits of the dispute.330 In the\u00a0absence of specific provisions set forth by the ICSID Convention, or the BIT, in this\u00a0respect, the Arbitral Tribunal is entitled to assess, according to the circumstances of\u00a0the case and in the manner it deems more appropriate, whether one party shall\u00a0reimburse the other party for costs, in whole or in part, and in what proportion. The\u00a0parties agree that this is a discretionary power.331\n709. \u00a0In the case at hand, Respondent has succeeded in its arguments and the Arbitral\u00a0Tribunal has dismissed all of Claimants\u2019 Claims.

The Arbitral Tribunal also takes into account the lack of proportion\u00a0between the expenses claimed by Claimants and the expenses of Respondent.\u00a0Finally, the Arbitral Tribunal notes that Claimants have succeeded in establishing the\u00a0Arbitral Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction.\n713. \u00a0\u00a0Therefore, the Arbitral Tribunal determines that Claimants should bear the defense\u00a0expenses incurred by Respondent to a limited amount, and sentences Claimants to\u00a0pay 40% of such expenses as compensation.\n714. \u00a0As previously stated, Respondent declared US$10,364,183.56 as the amount incurred\nfor arbitration costs.
