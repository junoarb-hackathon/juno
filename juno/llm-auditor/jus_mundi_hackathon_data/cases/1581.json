Introduction**\n-------------------\n\n1.\n\nI am afraid but I am unable to concur with my co-arbitrators\u2019 view that this Tribunal would have jurisdiction over the present dispute.\n\n2.\n\nThis is indeed a highly complex story of an attempt to make an investment in the tourism sector of the Kosovo through participating in the privatization of the Grand Hotel Prishtina. However, to consider that it actually amounted to an \"investment\" made by the Claimant in order to fall under the *ratione materiae* and *ratione personae* jurisdiction of an ICSID tribunal would just require too many leaps of faith.\n\n3.\n\nWhile the story is indeed perplexingly strange and full of factual difficulties, as outlined in the majority\u2019s factual background,1 it is also a relatively simple contractual dispute concerning a share purchase agreed upon between private parties.\n\n*Mabco Constructions SA* v. *Republic of Kosovo*, Decision on Jurisdiction, ICSID Case No. ARB/17/25 (*Mabco* v. *Kosovo*, Decision on Jurisdiction), paras. 136 *et seq*.\n\n4.\n\nMr. Behgjet Pacolli, a highly successful businessman and prominent politician of Kosovo and Swiss nationality, together with Mr. Ejupi, the founder and owner of NTSH Eurokoha-Reisen, entered into an agreement with Mr. Zelqif Berisha. Mr. Berisha, the owner and director of UTC/Unio Commerce, had successfully bid for the privatization of Grand Hotel, but was unable to pay the entire purchase price. Mr. Pacolli and Mr. Ejupi agreed to participate in this privatization venture by providing part of the unpaid purchase price to UTC to be then paid to the privatization agency of the Kosovo (KTA/PAK). Under an agreement between the three businessmen, Mr. Pacolli, Mr. Ejupi and Mr. Berisha, apparently orally entered into sometime around April 2006 and put into writing in the so-called Agreement of Good Understanding,2 Mr. Pacolli and Mr. Ejupi would participate with a 40% and a 20% share in the hotel project obliging the two to make cash infusions of 4 million and 1 million Euro, respectively, and Mr. Berisha to hand over to the former their shares after a period of two years.\n\n\"Agreement of Good Understanding \u2013 Hotel Grand Prishtina\", dated January 2007 (C-17).\n\n5.\n\nOn this obligation Mr. Berisha reneged, triggering a law-suit by Mr. Pacolli before the courts in the Kosovo. While Mr. Pacolli prevailed in these proceedings at first instance,3 he lost on appeal.4\n\nJudgment of the Municipal Court of Prishtina, dated 28 May 2009 (R-29).\n\nJudgment of the District Court of Prishtina, dated 13 April 2010 (R-31).\n\n6.\n\nMabco, the Claimant in this arbitration, a Swiss company founded and controlled by Mr. Behgjet Pacolli, appeared neither in the contractual arrangements, nor in the legal proceedings. It was always Mr. Behgjet Pacolli who acted in his own name when trying to obtain the shares contractually5 and subsequently in litigation.6\n\nThe \"Agreement of Good Understanding \u2013 Hotel Grand Prishtina\", January 2007 (C-17), refers to Mr. Zelqif Berisha, Mr. Behxhet Pacolli and Mr. Remzi Ejupi as \"Co-Owners\" without any mentioning of Mabco; The Annex agreement, dated 28 March 2012 (C-20), refers to Mabetex, not Mabco as the company involved next to Mr. Behxhet Pacolli (\"Selim Pacolli, born on 21/09/1969 in Marec-Prishtina Commune, holder of personal ID number 2005867137, representing Mr. Behxhet Pacolli, acting on behalf of the company 'MABETEX' and in his personal name.\").\n\nThe lawsuit filed by Mr. Pacolli and NTSH against UTC, dated 5 June 2007 (R-30), was brought by \"Behgjet Pacolli from Prishtina, president of c.e.o MABETEX GROUP\" and \"NTSH Eurokoha-Reisen\", demanding confirmation \"that the Claimants are co-owners of the hotel 'Grand Hotel Prishtina' Prishtina as follows: the first Claimant Behgjet Pacolli from Prishtina of the ideal part of 2/5 or 40%, and the second Claimant NTSH \"Eurokoha - Reisen\" from Prishtina of the ideal part of 1/5 or 20% of this hotel.\"; the Judgment of the Municipal Court of Prishtina, dated 28 May 2009, (R-29) lists as claimants Mr. \"Behxhet Pacolli\" and \"NTSH Eurokoha-Reisen\", whereas \"Unio Commerce\" appears as respondent; the same is true for the Judgment of the District Court of Prishtina, dated 13 April 2010 (R-31).\n\n7.\n\nAlso in lengthy discussions with the PAK concerning the fulfilment of the privatization requirements of Grand Hotel and the eventual withdrawal of the shares, it was Mr. Behgjet Pacolli and/or his brother Mr. Selim Pacolli, representing him, who acted.7\n\nThe so-called \"October 21, 2011 Letter of Mabco to PAK\" (C-22) was sent and signed by Mr. Selim Pacolli, not mentioning Mabco, but that he represented his brother, Mr. Behgjet Pacolli, as 40% owner according to the Agreement of Good Understanding; the so-called \"March 5, 2012 Letter of PAK to Mabco\" (C-23) was sent to Mr. Behxhet Pacolli not mentioning Mabco; the so-called \"March 19, 2012 Letter of PAK to Mabco and NTSH\" (C-24, C-38) was sent to Mr. Selim Pacolli not mentioning Mabco; the letter from UTC, Mabetex Project Engineering and NTSH to PAK, dated 28 March 2012 (R-32), signed by Mr. Selim Pacolli on behalf of Mabetex mentions Mabetex, not Mabco; the letter from Mr. Selim Pacolli to PAK dated 11 June 2012 (R-42) in re share withdrawal refers to Mr. Behgjet Pacolli as 40% owner, not to Mabco.\n\n8.\n\nThe Claimant Mabco comes into play in a letter by a Kosovo lawyer writing to the PAK on 20 June 2012, a few days after the Kosovo-Switzerland Bilateral Investment Treaty (BIT)8 entered into force. In this letter, Mabco is referred to as a \"working unit\" of MABETEX GROUP9 and the PAK is informed that \"MABETEX group has sustained a serious moral and pecuniary damage and shall never agree with your decision on withdrawal of shares.\"10\n\nAgreement between the Swiss Confederation and the Republic of Kosovo on the Promotion and Reciprocal Protection of Investments, 27 October 2011, entered into force on 13 June 2012 (Kosovo-Switzerland BIT) (C-1).\n\nIn the \"June 20, 2012 Letter from Mabco to PAK\" (C-40) \"Mr. Behgjet Pacolli\" is referred to as \"a legal representative of MABETEX GROUP \u2014 working unit MARCO CONSTRUCTION S.A. headquartered in Lugano, Switzerland.\"\n\nIbid. See also the so-called \"Letter from Mabco and NTSH to PAK\", dated 28 June 2012 (C-37), written by \"Selim Pacolli\" and \"NTSH Eurokoha-Reisen\" to the PAK, wherein the former referred to himself as \"'general representative of Mabatex Group - Mabco Construction' headquartered in Lugano - Switzerland and of owners of this Swiss investor.\"\n\n9.\n\nIn the end, it appears that attempts were made to acquire shares in the privatization of the Grand Hotel Prishtina, but so far these attempts have been unsuccessful, not leading to an \"investment\" in Kosovo, but to a contractual claim against UTC/Unio Commerce.\n\n10.\n\nI believe it is the assessment of these facts where I am unable to follow the majority\u2019s views and not really the legal prerequisites. We seem to concur that in order to be protected under the BIT11 and/or the Kosovo Foreign Investment Law (FIL)12 an \"investment\" must have been made and, for an ICSID tribunal to exercise jurisdiction *ratione materiae,* the dispute must \"directly aris[e] out of an investment.\"13 We also agree that in order to fall under the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction *ratione personae,* the Claimant, a company incorporated in Switzerland must have made the investment and not Mr. Pacolli, a dual Swiss and Kosovo national, since his latter nationality would prevent him from bringing an ICSID claim pursuant to Article 25(2)(a) of the ICSID Convention.14\n\nSee *supra* note 8.\n\nSee *infra* notes 19 *et seq*.\n\nArticle 25(1) ICSID Convention (\"The jurisdiction of the Centre shall extend to any legal dispute arising directly out of an investment, between a Contracting State (or any constituent subdivision or agency of a Contracting State designated to the Centre by that State) and a national of another Contracting State, which the parties to the dispute consent in writing to submit to the Centre. When the parties have given their consent, no party may withdraw its consent unilaterally.\").\n\nArticle 25(2)(a) ICSID Convention (\"'National of another Contracting State' means: (a) any natural person who had the nationality of a Contracting State other than the State party to the dispute on the date on which the parties consented to submit such dispute to conciliation or arbitration as well as on the date on which the request was registered pursuant to paragraph (3) of Article 28 or paragraph (3) of Article 36, but does not include any person who on either date also had the nationality of the Contracting State party to the dispute;\"); See also *Champion Trading Company* v. *Arab Republic of Egypt*, ICSID Case No. ARB/02/9, Decision on Jurisdiction, 21 October 2003, p. 14 (CL-12) (\"According to the ordinary meaning of the terms of the Convention (Article 25 (2)(a)) dual nationals are excluded from invoking the protection under the Convention against the host country of the investment of which they are also a national.\").\n\n11.\n\nIn my view, the present case fails on jurisdictional grounds for two main reasons, first because no investment has been made and second because any attempts to make an investment were made by a dual Swiss-Kosovo national and not by the Swiss claimant.\n\n12.\n\nThis result corresponds to the object and purpose of investment protection, i.e. to protect existing investments against interference by host states, not to support claimants in their contractual disputes with private parties about the fulfilment of their obligations. In essence, this is what the dispute presented by the Claimant is all about, a contractual dispute concerning a share purchase agreed upon between private parties, Mr. Pacolli and Mr. Ejupi, on the one side, and Mr. Berisha, on the other side.15\n\n*Mabco* v. *Kosovo*, Decision on Jurisdiction, para. 334 (\"Claimant did of course have a contractual relationship with UTC and, on that basis, a cause of action against UTC.\").\n\n13.\n\nThis dispute should be distinguished from the dispute regarding the withdrawal of the Grand Hotel shares from UTC by the PAK, which resulted from UTC\u2019s non-fulfilment of the privatization requirements and may be viewed as a dispute between UTC and the host state. It is undoubted that neither Mr. Pacolli nor Mabco ever acquired Grand Hotel shares. Thus, any dispute about the withdrawal exists between the privatization agency, PAK, and the party whose shares have been withdrawn, UTC.\n\n**II. Was There an Investment?**\n--------------------------------\n\n14.\n\nContrary to the majority\u2019s view, acknowledging that \"Claimant is not entirely clear or consistent as to the exact nature of the investment it claims to have acquired in respect of the Grand Hotel shares,\"16 but still finding that \"*a claim of entitlement to ownership of the shares\"*17 constitutes an \"investment\",18 I have difficulties in concluding that a contractual entitlement to receive shares constitutes an \"investment\" within the meaning of Article 1 of the BIT or Article 2 of Kosovo\u2019s Foreign Investment Law 200519/201420,21 on the one hand, and in the sense of Article 25 of the ICSID Convention, on the other hand.\n\n*Mabco* v. *Kosovo*, Decision on Jurisdiction, para. 293.\n\n*Mabco* v. *Kosovo*, Decision on Jurisdiction, para. 294 [emphasis in original].\n\n*Mabco* v. *Kosovo*, Decision on Jurisdiction, paras. 295 *et seq*. (in regard to the ICSID Convention); paras. 302\u00a0*et seq.*(in regard to the BIT); paras. 313 *et seq*. (in regard to the FIL).\n\nAssembly of Kosovo, Law No. 02/L-33 on Foreign Investment, 21 November 2005 (C-2).\n\nRepublic of Kosovo, Law No. 04/L-220 on Foreign Investment, 12 December 2013 (C-18) (R-19).\n\nThe Claimant has variously invoked both investment laws at different stages of these proceedings, making it difficult for the Tribunal to ascertain on which legislation its non-BIT claims are based. However, I concur with my colleagues finding that since most of the challenged measures took place before the entry into force of the 2014 act it must be largely the 2005 legislation which applies in the present case. *Mabco* v. *Kosovo*, Decision on Jurisdiction, paras. 460 *et seq*.\n\n15.\n\nWe agree that in ICSID arbitration the \"investment\" criterion, both under the ICSID Convention and the instrument conferring consent to ICSID arbitration, i.e. the BIT or the applicable host state legislation, must be fulfilled. This follows from the well-established, double-barrelled test, as expressed by the ICSID tribunal in *CSOB* v. *Slovak Republic22* and affirmed by many other tribunals.23\n\n*Ceskoslovenska Obchodni Banka, a.s.* v*. The Slovak Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/97/4, Decision on Jurisdiction, 24 May 1999, para. 68 (\"A two-fold test must therefore be applied in determining whether this Tribunal has the competence to consider the merits of the claim: whether the dispute arises out of an investment within the meaning of the Convention and, if so, whether the dispute relates to an investment as defined in the Parties' consent to ICSID arbitration, in their reference to the BIT and the pertinent definitions contained in [...] the BIT.\").\n\n*Malaysian Historical Salvors Sdn, Bhd* v. *The Government of Malaysia*, ICSID Case No. ARB/05/10, Award, 17 May 2007 (RL-45), para. 55 (\"Under the double-barrelled test, a finding that the Contract satisfied the definition of 'investment' under the BIT would not be sufficient for this Tribunal to assume jurisdiction, if the Contract failed to satisfy the criterion of an 'investment' within the meaning of Article 25.\"); *Malicorp Limited* v. *The Arab Republic of Egypt*, ICSID Case No. ARB/08/18, Award, 7 February 2011, para. 107 (\"[\u2026] in order for a proceeding based on breach of the treaty to be admissible, the investment to which the dispute relates must pass a double test (also known as the 'double keyhole approach' or 'double-barrelled test;'.\"); *Mytilineos Holdings SA* v. *The State Union of Serbia & Montenegro and Republic of Serbia*, Partial Award on Jurisdiction, 8 September 2006, para. 112 (\"It is the established practice of ICSID tribunals to assess whether a specific transaction qualifies as an 'investment' under the ICSID Convention, independently of the definition of investment in a BIT or other applicable investment instrument, in order to fulfill the *ratione materiae* prerequisite of Article 25 of the Convention.\").\n\n16.\n\nIn the present case, this implies that Claimant must have made an \"investment\" in the sense of Article 25 of the ICSID Convention and either Article 1 of the Kosovo-Switzerland BIT 2011 or Article 2 of Kosovo's Foreign Investment Law 2005/2014.\n\n**A. The Kosovo-Switzerland BIT**\n---------------------------------\n\n17.\n\nArticle 1(1) Kosovo-Switzerland BIT 2011 provides in relevant part:\n\n\"The term 'investment' means every kind of asset established or acquired by an investor of one Contracting Party in the territory of the other Contracting Party that has such characteristics as the commitment of capital or other resources, the expectation of gain or profit, or the assumption of risk, including: [...] (b) a company, or shares, parts or any other kind of participation in a company; (c) claims to money or to any performance having an economic value, except claims to money arising solely out of commercial contracts for the sale of goods and services; [...].\"24\n\nArticle 1(1) Kosovo-Switzerland BIT, *supra* note 8.\n\n18.\n\nIt thus defines as investment \"every kind of asset established or acquired by an investor of one Contracting Party in the territory of the other Contracting Party.\"25 It does require that an asset must have been \"established\" or \"acquired\", it does not include the attempt to acquire an asset. The BIT's definition is thus fairly clear in its aim to protect investments on the basis of \"established or acquired\" assets.\n\n*Ibid*.\n\n19.\n\nThe text of the BIT is also explicit in not merely containing a broad, asset-based definition of investment. In addition, it incorporates some of the elements developed by ICSID tribunals in the so-called *Salini-test,26* such as \"the commitment of capital or other resources, the expectation of gain or profit or the assumption of risk.\"27 Thereby, it makes clear that not every asset listed should qualify as an investment.28 Rather, assets qualify as investment if they are established or acquired as a result of (usually) a capital commitment, held and operated in order to receive returns, with all the uncertainties associated with entrepreneurial risk. In this regard, I agree with the majority that suggested as a test \"[...] that a claim to money can qualify as an investment provided that it \"entail[s] a 'transfer of resources into the economy of the host state by the claimant entailing the assumption of risk in expectation of a commercial return.'\"\"29 However, I do not agree with the majority's conclusion that \"*a claim of entitlement to ownership of the shares\"* could already constitute an \"investment.\"30\n\nSee *infra* at note 40.\n\nArticle 1(1) Kosovo-Switzerland BIT, *supra* note 8.\n\nSee even for cases where such a clarification is missing in the text of a BIT, *Romak S.A.* v. *Uzbekistan*, PCA Case No. AA280, Award, 26 November 2009, para. 207 (\"[\u2026] the term 'investments' under the BIT has an inherent meaning (irrespective of whether the investor resorts to ICSID or UNCITRAL arbitral proceedings) entailing a contribution that extends over a certain period of time and that involves some risk. [\u2026] By their nature, asset types enumerated in the BIT's non-exhaustive list may exhibit these hallmarks. But if an asset does not correspond to the inherent definition of investment the fact that it falls within one of the categories listed in Article 1 does not transform it into an 'investment'.\" [emphases omitted]).\n\n*Mabco* v. *Kosovo*, Decision on Jurisdiction, para. 308.\n\nIbid. (\"The Tribunal is accordingly not prepared to exclude fully the possibility that a claim of entitlement to ownership of shares under certain circumstances is cognizable as a qualifying investment.\").\n\n20.\n\nOnce shares, constituting participation in a company, have been acquired they would constitute an investment under the definition of the BIT. However, to view attempts to acquire shares as claims to performance having an economic value and thus \"investments\" would extend the notion of investment to any claim to obtain whatever has been contractually stipulated, whether real property, intellectual property rights, shares or other rights, without the characteristics required for an \"investment\", i.e. acquiring assets used in order to produce gain or profit with the assumption of risk.\n\n21.\n\nAs the tribunal in *Clorox* v. *Venezuela*31 found \"under its common meaning, an investment consists of deploying money or other goods in the hope of receiving a benefit,\" which in its view \"basically corresponds to the Latin etymology of the words 'investment\u2019 and 'invest,\u2019 which imply an input (*in*) and a return *(versus, vertere)\"*32 Also the tribunal in *Saba Fakes* v. *Turkey*33 correctly emphasized \"that the criteria of (i) a contribution, (ii) a certain duration, and (iii) an element of risk [...] derive from the ordinary meaning of the word 'investment\u2019, [...], one is required to contribute a certain amount of funds or know-how, one cannot harvest the benefits of such contribution instantaneously, and one runs the risk that no benefits would be reaped at all, as a project might never be completed [...].\"34\n\n*Clorox Spain S.L.* v. *Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela*, PCA Case No. 2015-30, Award, 20 May 2019.\n\n*Ibid*., para. 820 (translation from Spanish) (\"[\u2026] en su sentido corriente, una inversi\u00f3n consiste en el empleo de dinero u otros bienes con la esperanza de sacar un beneficio. Ello corresponde b\u00e1sicamente a la etimolog\u00eda latina de las palabras \"inversi\u00f3n\" e \"invertir\" que implican una entrada (*in*) y un retorno (*versus, vertere*).\").\n\n*Saba Fakes* v*. Republic of Turkey*, ICSID Case No. ARB/07/20, Award, 14 July 2010 (RL-46).\n\n*Ibid*., para. 110.\n\n**B. The Foreign Investment Law**\n---------------------------------\n\n22.\n\nAs noted by the majority,35 Kosovo\u2019s 2005 Foreign Investment Law defines \"investment\" as \"any asset that has (i) been contributed to a Kosovo business organization in return for an ownership interest in that business organization;\"36 and continues to define the term \"asset\", among others, as \"any item of value, whether tangible or intangible, and includes, but is not limited to, the following and similar items: a. movable and immovable property, including rights in and to such property such as a mortgage, lien, pledge, lease or servitude; [...] d. claims or rights to money, goods, services, and performance under contract;\"37\n\n*Mabco* v. *Kosovo*, Decision on Jurisdiction, paras. 315 *et seq*.\n\nArticle 2 of the Foreign Investment Law 2005, *supra* note 19.\n\n*Ibid*.\n\n23.\n\nIn a similar way, Kosovo\u2019s 2014 Foreign Investment Law defines \"investment\" as an \"asset owned or otherwise lawfully held [...] for the purpose of conducting lawful commercial activities\", it does not define \"investment\" as assets attempted to be acquired.\n\n24.\n\nSpecifically, the definition of \"investment\" in Article 2 of Kosovo's Foreign Investment Law 2014 provides as follows:\n\n\"[...] any asset owned or otherwise lawfully held by a Foreign Person in the Republic of Kosovo for the purpose of conducting lawful commercial activities, including but not limited to: [...]\n\n1.4.3. cash, securities, commercial paper, guarantees, shares of stock or other types of ownership interests in a (sic!) the Republic of Kosovo or foreign business organization; bonds, debentures, other debt instruments;\n\n1.4.4. claims or rights to money, goods, services, and performance under contract;\"38\n\nLaw No. 04/L-220, 12 December 2013 (C-18) (R-19).\n\n25.\n\nLike the BIT, the Foreign Investment Law does not regard any \"asset\" as an \"investment.\" Rather, it defines as \"investment\" \"[...] any asset owned or otherwise lawfully held [...] for the purpose of conducting lawful commercial activities.\"\n\n26.\n\nWhile I agree that claims to performance under contract sometimes may form assets held for the purpose of conducting lawful commercial activities, this is not the case here since the claim to receive shares could not yet be viewed as commercial activity by which one conducts business.39\n\nLaw No. 04/L-220, 12 December 2013 (C-18) (R-19) (\"1.6. Business activity \u2013 any activity involving the offering, providing or producing of goods, services, property and/or works to anyone in return for or in expectation of any type of payment or compensation.\").\n\n**C. The ICSID Convention**\n---------------------------\n\n27.\n\nMost importantly, the *ratione materiae* jurisdiction under the ICSID Convention is lacking since the attributes of even a scaled-down *Salini* test have not been met. Indeed, most ICSID tribunals have limited the original *Salini-test,* which mentioned next to \"contributions, a certain duration of performance of the contract and a participation in the risks of the transaction\" \"the contribution to the economic development of the host State of the investment as an additional condition.\"40 Today, most ICSID tribunals hold that in fact only \"the three objective criteria of (i) a contribution, (ii) a certain duration, and (iii) an element of risk are necessary elements of an investment.\"41\n\n*Salini Costruttori S.p.A. and Italstrade S.p.A.* v. *Kingdom of Morocco*, ICSID Case No. ARB/00/4, Decision on Jurisdiction, 23 July 2001 (CL-28), para. 52 (\"The doctrine generally considers that investment infers: contributions, a certain duration of performance of the contract and a participation in the risks of the transaction (cf. commentary by E. Gaillard, cited above, p. 292). In reading the Convention's preamble, one may add the contribution to the economic development of the host State of the investment as an additional condition.\").\n\n*Saba Fakes* v*. Republic of Turkey*, ICSID Case No. ARB/07/20, Award, 14 July 2010 (RL-46), para. 110 (\"[\u2026] that the criteria of (i) a contribution, (ii) a certain duration, and (iii) an element of risk, are both necessary and sufficient to define an investment within the framework of the ICSID Convention.\"). See also *Electrabel S.A.* v. *Republic of Hungary*, ICSID Case No. ARB/07/19, Decision on Jurisdiction, Applicable Law and Liability, 30 November 2012, para. 5.43; *Deutsche Bank AG* v. *Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka*, ICSID Case No. ARB/09/2, Award, 31 October 2012, para. 295; *GEA Group Aktiengesellschaft* v. *Ukraine*, ICSID Case No. ARB/08/16, Award, 31 March 2011, para. 151; *Po\u0161tov\u00e1 banka, a.s. and Istrokapital SE* v. *The Hellenic Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/13/8, Award, 9 April 2015, para. 360; *Vestey Group Ltd* v. *Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela*, ICSID Case No. ARB/06/4, Award, 15 April 2016 (RL-19), para. 187.\n\n28.\n\nI concur with the majority that contribution to the economic development of the host state has fallen out of favour42 and that it should not be seen as a separate jurisdictional requirement.43 However, I disagree with the majority's application of the core requirements of the *Salini* test, which demands that a substantial commitment is made in order to acquire assets which are being used over a certain period of time for entrepreneurial purposes, i.e. aimed at producing profit and return. Whether one would like to emphasise the expectation of regular profit and return or the implicit risk of such use does not seem to be important, but what is important is that the notion of investment implies the acquisition of some assets for economic purposes.44\n\n*Mabco* v. *Kosovo*, Decision on Jurisdiction, para. 296.\n\nSee also *Deutsche Bank AG* v. *Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka*, ICSID Case No. ARB/09/2, Award, 31 October 2012, para. 306 (\"[\u2026] the criterion of contribution to economic development has been discredited and has not been adopted recently by any tribunal. It is generally considered that this criterion is unworkable owing to its subjective nature. Indeed, whether or not a commitment of capital or resources ultimately proves to have contributed to the economic development of the host State can often be a matter of appreciation and can generate a wide spectrum of reasonable opinions. Moreover, some transactions may undoubtedly be qualified as investments, even though they do not result in a significant contribution to economic development in a post hoc evaluation of the claimant's activities. This is for example the case of mergers and acquisitions or of failed construction projects.\" [footnotes omitted]).\n\nSee also *Mabco* v. *Kosovo*, Decision on Jurisdiction, para. 308.\n\n29.\n\nWhere only a transfer of money is made, leading to a claim to acquire assets, this in itself does not yet constitute an investment. As long as the contractual claim to ownership to assets has not been fulfilled by the other party, the usual commercial, counterparty risk materialized, but not yet an investment risk as a typical characteristic of an investment.45\n\nSee *Romak S.A.* v. *Uzbekistan*, PCA Case No. AA280, Award, 26 November 2009, paras. 229, 230 (\"All economic activity entails a certain degree of risk. As such, all contracts \u2013 including contracts that do not constitute an investment \u2013 carry the risk of non-performance. However, this kind of risk is pure commercial, counterparty risk, or, otherwise stated, the risk of doing business generally. It is therefore not an element that is useful for the purpose of distinguishing between an investment and a commercial transaction. An 'investment risk' entails a different kind of *alea*, a situation in which the investor cannot be sure of a return on his investment, and may not know the amount he will end up spending, even if all relevant counterparties discharge their contractual obligations. Where there is 'risk' of this sort, the investor simply cannot predict the outcome of the transaction.\").\n\n30.\n\nWhat is needed for an investment to exist is both a contribution and something created by such contribution, i.e. ownership or control of (at least potentially) wealth-creating assets.46\n\n*Malicorp Limited* v. *The Arab Republic of Egypt*, ICSID Case No. ARB/08/18, Award, 7 February 2011, para. 110 (\"Clearly Article 1(a) of the Agreement emphasises the fruits and assets resulting from the investment, which must be protected, whereas the definitions generally used in relation to Article 25 of the ICSID Convention lay stress on the contributions that have created such fruits and assets. It can be inferred from this that assets cannot be protected unless they result from contributions, and contributions will not be protected unless they have actually produced the assets of which the investor claims to have been deprived.\").\n\n31.\n\nIn determining whether there is an \"investment\" in the sense of Article 25 of the ICSID Convention I agree with those ICSID tribunals that use \"a fact-specific and holistic assessment\"47 and stress that the *Salini* -elements48 should not be characterized \"as jurisdictional requirements but merely as typical characteristics of investments under the Convention.\"49\n\n*Malaysian Historical Salvors, SDN, BHD* v. *Malaysia*, ICSID Case No. ARB/05/10, Award on Jurisdiction, 17 May 2007 (RL-45), para. 107; see also *Joy Mining Machinery Limited* v. *Arab Republic of Egypt*, ICSID Case No. ARB/03/11, Decision on Jurisdiction, 6 August 2004 (RL-44), para. 54 (\"The requirement mentioned above, that a given element of a complex operation should not be examined in isolation because what matters is to assess the operation globally or as a whole, is a perfectly reasonable one in the view of the Tribunal. Accordingly, it has undertaken an examination of the Contract as a whole in order to determine whether it could qualify as an investment under Article 25 of the Convention [\u2026].\").\n\nSee *supra* note 40.\n\n*Ambiente Ufficio S.p.A. and others* v. *Argentine Republic (formerly Giordano Alpi and others v. Argentine Republic)*, ICSID Case No. ARB/08/9, Decision on Jurisdiction and Admissibility, 8 February 2013, para. 480.\n\n32.\n\nApplying these considerations to the present facts indicates that much remains mysterious about the various money transfers back and forth in April 2006. Still, I understand that one may possibly recognize a contribution in the form of a transfer of 4 million Euro from Mabco (via NTSH Eurokoha-Reisen) to UTC for the purpose of acquiring shares in the Grand Hotel Prishtina. However, even this assumption remains highly problematic.\n\n33.\n\nFor the following reasons, I cannot concur with the majority\u2019s assessment of the facts constituting \"positive evidence that Mabco made the transfer of funds in connection with the Grand Hotel acquisition.\"50\n\n*Mabco* v. *Kosovo*, Decision on Jurisdiction, para. 367.\n\n34.\n\nWhile the majority criticizes the Respondent offering a possible alternative explanation for the 4 million Euro transfer as \"sheer conjecture,\"51 it seems to take at face value the statements of Claimant\u2019s witnesses without any documentary evidence that the payment was indeed made for the privatization of the Grand Hotel. In fact, the majority seems to apply a *prima facie* test to the question whether an investment existed.52\n\n*Mabco* v. *Kosovo*, Decision on Jurisdiction, para. 364.\n\n*Mabco* v. *Kosovo*, Decision on Jurisdiction, para. 337, finding that \"for the purpose of establishing jurisdiction on a *prima facie* basis, and without prejudice to any decision on the merits, there is a colourable basis for Mabco's contention that it had a claim of entitlement against Respondent for registration of the shares in its name [\u2026] and that claim, under the circumstances of this case, may be regarded as an investment.\"\n\n35.\n\nIn my view, a *prima facie* test is appropriate only when it comes to assessing whether the claims raised are capable of constituting breaches of the applicable BIT or investment law.53 However, when it comes to establishing whether the *ratione materiae* requirement of an \"investment\" is fulfilled, the claimant has to prove the facts which are critical for the jurisdiction of a tribunal.54\n\n*Impregilo S.p.A.* v*. Islamic Republic of Pakistan*, ICSID Case No. ARB/03/3, Decision on Jurisdiction, 22 April 2005, para. 254 (\"[\u2026] whether the facts as alleged by the Claimant [\u2026], if established, are capable of coming within those provisions of the BIT which have been invoked.\" [emphasis omitted]); *Bayindir Insaat Turizm Ticaret Ve Sanayi A.S.* v. *Islamic Republic of Pakistan*, ICSID Case No. ARB/03/29, Decision on Jurisdiction, 14 November 2005 (CL-45), para. 197 (\"[\u2026] the Tribunal will apply a *prima facie* standard, both to the determination of the meaning and scope of the BIT provisions and to the assessment whether the facts alleged may constitute breaches. If the result is affirmative, jurisdiction will be established, but the existence of breaches will remain to be litigated on the merits.\").\n\n*Phoenix Action, Ltd.* v. *Czech Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/06/5, Award, 15 April 2009 (CL-33), para. 64 (\"In sum, the Tribunal considers that as a general approach, it is correct that factual matters should provisionally be accepted at face value, since the proper time to prove or disprove such facts is during the merits phase. But when a particular circumstance constitutes a critical element for the establishment of the jurisdiction itself, such fact must be proven, and the Tribunal must take a decision thereon when ruling on its jurisdiction. In our case, this means that the Tribunal must ascertain that the prerequisites for its jurisdiction are fulfilled, and that the facts on which its jurisdiction can be based are proven.\"); *Pac Rim Cayman LLC* v. *The Republic of El Salvador*, ICSID Case No. ARB/09/12, Decision on Jurisdiction, 1 June 2012 (CL-1), para. 2.8-2.9 (\"[t]he application of that '*prima facie* ' standard is limited to testing the merits of a claimant's case at a jurisdictional stage; and it cannot apply to a factual issue upon which a tribunal's jurisdiction directly depends [\u2026] all relevant facts supporting such jurisdiction must be established by the Claimant at this jurisdictional stage and not merely assumed in the Claimant's favour\".); *Planet Mining Pty Ltd* v. *Republic of Indonesia*, ICSID Case No. ARB/12/40 and 12/14, Decision on Jurisdiction, 24 February 2014, para. 96 (\"At the jurisdictional stage, the Claimant must establish (i) that the jurisdictional requirements of Article 25 of the ICSID Convention and of the Treaty are met, which includes proving the facts necessary to meet these requirements, and (ii) that it has a *prima facie* cause of action under the Treaty, that is, that the facts it alleges are susceptible of constituting a breach of the Treaty if they are ultimately proven.\").\n\n36.\n\nWhat the record reveals is that on 28 April 2006 (after various unsuccessful attempts) a transfer of 4 million Euro was made from Mabco to NTSH Eurokoha-Reisen. What the record does not reveal is whether this transfer was made for purposes of acquiring the shares in Grand Hotel. For the majority there \"are good indications of the purpose for which the transfer was made, and Respondent offers no serious alternative explanation for it.\"55 However, the payment order concerning the initial transfer made by Mabco to NTSH Eurokoha-Reisen did not expressly indicate that it represented Mabco's share for the Grand Hotel. Rather, the order merely noted \"Agreement\" as payment motive.56 Whether the 21 April 2006 payment of Euro 4,011,676.00 from NTSH Eurokoha-Reisen to UTC57 can be viewed as \"onward transfer\"58 may create some chronological difficulties. In addition, the absence of documentary evidence requires some conjecture to assume that the money was subsequently transferred from UTC to KTA.59 In my view, the majority's assessment that the 4 million Euro transfer from Mabco to NTSH Eurokoha-Reisen was made in \"connection with the Grand Hotel acquisition\"60 is based on Claimant's circumstantial evidence and as such insufficient to establish that a contribution has been made.\n\n*Mabco* v. *Kosovo*, Decision on Jurisdiction, para. 364.\n\nWire transfer receipt of EUR 4'000'000, dated April 29, 2006 (C-14).\n\nTransfer of EUR 4,011,676.00 from NTSH to UTC, dated 21 April 2006 (R-23).\n\n*Mabco* v. *Kosovo*, Decision on Jurisdiction, para. 362.\n\n*Mabco* v. *Kosovo*, Decision on Jurisdiction, para. 362 (\"The record in the case does not appear to contain an exhibit of the onward transfer from UTC to KTA.\").\n\n*Mabco* v. *Kosovo*, Decision on Jurisdiction, para. 367.\n\n37.\n\nEven if one would be willing to view the 4 million Euro transfer from Mabco to UTC in April 2006 as the contribution for acquiring an investment in the Kosovo, the other typical elements of an investment are still missing. The party receiving this \"contribution\", UTC, failed to comply with its contractual obligation to deliver the shares. Thus, all that occurred was a transfer of money for the purchase of shares. Since the seller of the shares failed to fulfil its part of the deal, the would-be investor, Mabco or Mr. Pacolli, failed to acquire any assets with which it would have been possible to engage in economic activities aimed at producing profit and return over a certain period of time. This sentiment is very well captured by Mr. Pacolli who testified during the hearing that he had received nothing for the 4 million Euro61 and that on the basis of the agreement with Mr. Berisha of UTC he had intended to start investing in the hotel project.62\n\nTranscript of the Hearing Day 1, 172:18-20, Mr. Pacolli (\"We have received nothing. I [am] only the big loser. The energy, you know, and money we lost. And we -- still today we haven't received anything.\").\n\nTranscript of the Hearing Day 1, 174:5-10, Mr. Pacolli (\"Because we had an agreement with Mr Zelqif Berisha, a signed agreement, confirmed by a lawyer in the time. [\u2026] and on base of this agreement we had to start with the investment, we had to invest.\").\n\n38.\n\nThus, the only typical characteristic of an \"investment\" that may be recognized in the present facts is a contribution made in order to acquire assets that could be used for the purpose of producing a profit. The other elements, such as a certain duration and an element of risk are missing as a result of the failure to actually acquire an asset in return for the money contribution. Tellingly, the majority\u2019s finding of the element of duration is made conditionally \"if\" an investment had in fact been made. Similarly, its conclusion that there was risk is premised on the assumption that shares were in fact obtained.63\n\n*Mabco* v. *Kosovo*, Decision on Jurisdiction, para. 300 (\"Turning to the question of risk, the Tribunal notes that, at the relevant time, Kosovo had virtually no tourism industry and development of a successful tourism industry could not be assumed. The purchase of shares in the Grand Hotel therefore necessarily entailed a risk. Nor is there any reason to suppose that Claimant's investment, if made, would not have sufficient duration.\").\n\n39.\n\nIn my view, a \"holistic assessment\" of the facts leads to the conclusion that one cannot qualify the Claimant\u2019s activities as an investment under Article 25 ICSID Convention.\n\n40.\n\nThe majority\u2019s approach, regarding not only shares, embodying participation in a corporate entity, but also a claim to entitlement to ownership of such shares as \"investments\" in effect transforms a purchase agreement for the acquisition of assets into an investment.\n\n41.\n\nThis would render the distinction between a contractual obligation and an investment largely meaningless and, in my view, impermissibly expands the notion of \"investment.\"\n\n**III. Was an Investment Made by the Claimant?**\n------------------------------------------------\n\n42.\n\nI also have to part ways with the Tribunal\u2019s majority in regard to its conclusion \"that, notwithstanding Mr. Pacolli\u2019s having very often used his own name rather than Mabco\u2019s, the investment was in fact Mabco\u2019s.\"64\n\n*Mabco* v. *Kosovo*, Decision on Jurisdiction, para. 344.\n\n43.\n\nRather, the \"doubt in the Tribunal\u2019s thinking that he was acting on these occasions in the name of Mabco\"65 leads me to believe that it would be wrong to disregard all the documentary evidence we have before us and to rely on after-the-fact testimony of Claimant\u2019s witnesses, stating that everyone knew that \"when Mr. Pacolli negotiated and signed agreements, he did so on behalf of the relevant entity within the Mabetex group, which in the construction and engineering sector would have been Mabco\"66 and that such had been common practice in Kosovo.67\n\n*Mabco* v. *Kosovo*, Decision on Jurisdiction, para. 339.\n\n*Mabco* v. *Kosovo*, Decision on Jurisdiction, para. 342, relying on testimony by Mabco's Chief Financial Officer, Lucina Maesani-Gaiatto (CWS-5).\n\n*Ibid*., relying on testimony by Mr. Ejupi (CWS-4).\n\n44.\n\nTherefore, I cannot follow the majority\u2019s determination \"that, factually, Mr. Pacolli acted in his dealings with the KTA and the PAK, as well as with UTC and NTSH, in a representative capacity.\"68\n\n*Mabco* v. *Kosovo*, Decision on Jurisdiction, para. 388.\n\n45.\n\nIn my view, looking at the documentary evidence on record there is not much that would support the assumption that \"Mr. Pacolli acted in a representative capacity.\"\n\n46.\n\nAs already outlined above,69 in all contemporaneous documents it was Mr. Behgjet Pacolli and not Mabco, who acted in the attempt to participate in the Grand Hotel privatization. Had it really been Mabco that entered into the Agreement of Good Understanding70 it seems curious that it was nowhere mentioned and when court proceedings were brought it is strange that Mabco did not appear as plaintiff. Equally, it is surprising that when engaged in protracted communications with the PAK, trying to avert the impending withdrawal of shares, it was always Mr. Behgjet Pacolli and not Mabco who acted.\n\nSee *supra* at paras. 6 *et seq*.\n\n\"Agreement of Good Understanding \u2013 Hotel Grand Prishtina\", dated January 2007 (C-17).\n\n47.\n\nGiven that Mr. Behgjet Pacolli is an experienced businessman one would expect him to be clear in his dealings when he is acting in his own name and when in the name of one of his companies.\n\n48.\n\nTo rely on an alleged practice in the Kosovo according to which everyone knew that \"when Mr. Pacolli negotiated and signed agreements, he was understood as doing so on behalf of [one of his companies]\"71 cannot suffice to absolve the Claimant of its burden of proof to establish that Mr. Pacolli actually negotiated and acted on its behalf.\n\n*Mabco* v. *Kosovo*, Decision on Jurisdiction, para. 342.\n\n49.\n\nWe can all speculate about different business practices. It may equally well be that Mr. Pacolli acted in his personal capacity because he was a well-known and successful businessman with whom an agreement was sought to invest in the Grand Hotel privatization, rather than with Mabco, S.A., a Swiss soci\u00e9t\u00e9 anonyme with a share capital of 100,000,00 CHF.72\n\n\"Original excerpt of the Register of Commerce of Mabco Constructions SA and English translation\" (C-4).\n\n50.\n\nSuch speculations cannot overcome Claimant\u2019s failure to establish that Mr. Pacolli\u2019s activities should in fact be attributed to Mabco.\n\n51.\n\nThat Mabco enters the scene in June 2012 is less surprising. The entry-into-force of the Kosovo-Switzerland BIT on 13 June 2012 certainly did not go unnoticed in legal circles.\n\n52.\n\nIt thus made strategic sense for Mr. Pacolli\u2019s lawyer to refer to Mr. Pacolli as \"a legal representative of MABETEX GROUP \u2014 working unit MABCO CONSTRUCTION S.A. headquartered in Lugano, Switzerland\" and to threaten in regard to the PAK\u2019s decision on the withdrawal of shares \"legal steps for the implementation of rights under legal procedures, the latter as provided for in international law, agreement on protection of foreign investments signed by Government of the Republic of Kosovo and Swiss Government.\"73\n\n\"June 20, 2012 Letter from Mabco to PAK\" (C-40).\n\n53.\n\nHowever, such re-interpretation of the factual record should be viewed as what it is: an impermissible attempt to overcome the jurisdictional obstacle for Mr. Pacolli, as a Swiss-Kosovo dual national, to have an ICSID tribunal hear his claims. Of course, also this is speculation.\n\n**IV. Conclusion**\n------------------\n\n54.\n\nMy point is that it is the task of ICSID tribunals to assess whether there is sufficient evidence that the core jurisdictional requirements are fulfilled.74 In my view, this is not the case in regard to two crucial *ratione materiae* and *ratione personae* requirements.\n\nSee *supra* para. 35.\n\n55.\n\nI would thus have preferred this Tribunal to declare that it lacks jurisdiction over the present dispute."}], "Content": "Decision on Jurisdiction\n------------------------\n\n**Table of Selected Abbreviations/Defined Terms**\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| AGU | Agreement of Good Understanding |\n| Annex Agreement | Annex Agreement to the AGU dated 28 March 2012 |\n| Application | Kosovo's Preliminary Objections under Rule 41(5) dated 18 December 2017 |\n| Arbitration Rules | ICSID Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings 2006 |\n| BIT | Agreement between the Swiss Confederation and the Republic of Kosovo on the Promotion and Reciprocal Protection of Investments, which entered into force on 13 June 2012 |\n| c-[#] | Claimant's Exhibit |\n| CL-[#] | Claimant's Legal Authority |\n| Cl. post-hearing br. | Claimant's Post Hearing Brief dated 17 February 2020 |\n| Cl.

PROCEDURAL HISTORY**\n-------------------------\n\n1.\n\nOn 15 May 2017, ICSID received a request for arbitration of the same date from Mabco against Kosovo, along with exhibits C-1 through C-17 (the \"**Request**\").\n\n2.\n\nOn 2 June 2017, the Centre sent a first set of questions to Claimant.\n\n3.\n\nOn 16 June 2017, Claimant responded by submitting a letter supplementing the Request, along with additional exhibits C-171 through C-21.\n\nThe Claimant submitted a second part of Exhibit C-17 containing the original text in Albanian.\n\n4.\n\nOn 26 June 2017, ICSID sent a second round of questions to Claimant.\n\n5.\n\nOn 30 June 2017, the General State Attorney of Kosovo requested that the ICSID Secretary-General refuse the registration of the Request as being manifestly outside the jurisdiction of the Centre.\n\n6.\n\nOn 4 July 2017, the Centre acknowledged receipt of Kosovo's letter of 30 June 2017 and reminded Kosovo that:\n\n*Pursuant to Article 36(3) of the ICSID Convention, the Secretary-General shall register the Request unless she finds, on the basis of the information contained in the Request, that the dispute is manifestly outside the jurisdiction of ICSID. Therefore, the Secretary-General's power to consider any objections to a request for arbitration is limited.*\n\n7.\n\nOn 12 July 2017, Claimant responded to the Centre's second set of questions and provided comments on Respondent's letter of 30 June 2017.\n\n8.\n\nOn 21 July 2017, the Secretary-General of ICSID registered the Request in accordance with Article 36(3) of the ICSID Convention and notified the Parties of the registration. In the Notice of Registration, the Secretary-General invited the Parties to proceed to constitute an arbitral tribunal as soon as possible in accordance with Rule 7(d) of ICSID\u2019s Rules of Procedure for the Institution of Conciliation and Arbitration Proceedings.\n\n9.\n\nOn 31 July 2017, Claimant made a proposal as to the method of constitution of the Tribunal, which Respondent accepted on 11 August 2017.\n\n10.\n\nBy letter dated 15 August 2018, the Centre noted that the Parties had agreed to constitute the Tribunal in accordance with Article 37(2)(a) of the ICSID Convention, and that the Tribunal would consist of three arbitrators, to be appointed as follows:\n\n*1. Each party shall appoint one arbitrator;*\n\n*2. The two party-appointed arbitrators shall, each in consultation with the party that nominated him/her, appoint the Chairperson of the Arbitral Tribunal within 90 days of the registration of the case;*\n\n*3. None of the members of the Arbitral Tribunal shall be a national of Switzerland or the Republic of Kosovo;*\n\n*4. In case the party-appointed arbitrators and the parties cannot agree on a Chairperson within the above-mentioned time limit, the Chairperson shall be appointed by the Chairman of the Administrative Council of ICSID.*\n\n11.\n\nOn 24 August 2017, Claimant appointed Mr. Gianrocco Ferraro, a national of Italy, as arbitrator in this case. Mr. Ferraro accepted his appointment on September 5, 2017.\n\n12.\n\nOn 20 September 2017, Respondent appointed Professor Dr. August Reinisch, a national of Austria, as arbitrator in this case. Professor Dr. Reinisch accepted his appointment on 26 September 2017.\n\n13.\n\nOn 23 October 2017, the co-arbitrators informed the Parties that they had been unable to reach an agreement on the presiding arbitrator within the 90-day period set forth in the Parties\u2019 agreement; and inquired whether the Parties would agree to a 2-week extension for the appointment of the presiding arbitrator.\n\n14.\n\nOn 25 October 2017, Claimant agreed to the extension of the deadline for the appointment of the presiding arbitrator until 2 November 2017.\n\n15.\n\nOn 2 November 2017, the co-arbitrators inquired whether the Parties would agree to a further 2-week extension.\n\n16.\n\nBy correspondence dated 3 and 6 November 2017, the Parties agreed to extend the deadline for the appointment of the presiding arbitrator. The Centre took note of such agreement on 6 November 2017.\n\n17.\n\nOn 15 November 2017, the Centre informed the Parties that the co-arbitrators had appointed Professor George Bermann, a national of the United States, as the presiding arbitrator.\n\n18.\n\nOn 20 September 2017, the Secretary-General, in accordance with Rule 6(1) of the ICSID Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings (the \"**Arbitration Rules**\"), notified the Parties that all three arbitrators had accepted their appointments and that the Tribunal was therefore deemed to have been constituted on that date. Mr. Francisco Abriani, ICSID Legal Counsel, was designated to serve as Secretary of the Tribunal.\n\n19.\n\nOn 29 November 2017, the Centre requested the Parties to make an initial advance payment by 29 December 2017 in order to cover the cost of the proceeding, in accordance with ICSID Administrative and Financial Regulation 14(3).\n\n20.\n\nOn 6 December 2017, the Tribunal informed the Parties that it would be available to hold the first session with the Parties by telephone conference on 17 January 2018 and invited them to confirm their availability on this date. A draft Procedural Order No. 1 was also circulated, and the Parties were invited to review its content, to agree on as many of the issues addressed in the draft order as possible, and to submit their comments on the proposed draft one week before the first session.\n\n21.\n\nOn 14 December 2017, the Tribunal reiterated its request regarding the Parties' availability.\n\n22.\n\nOn 18 December 2017, Claimant informed the Tribunal that it had initiated settlement negotiations with Respondent and requested the stay of the proceeding and the extension of the deadline for the payment of the advance on costs until 31 January 2018.\n\n23.\n\nOn 18 December 2017, Respondent informed the Tribunal of its intention to submit an objection pursuant to Rule 41(5) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules for \"manifest lack of legal merits within the deadlines set forth in the aforementioned rule.\"\n\n24.\n\nOn 19 December 2017, the Tribunal invited Respondent to state, whether it agreed to Claimant\u2019s request that the proceeding be stayed until 31 January 2018. The Tribunal also took note of Respondent\u2019s intention to submit an objection pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule 41(5), and reminded the Parties that the deadline to submit an objection pursuant to Rule 41(5) was \"30 days after the constitution of the Tribunal\", i.e. 20 December 2017.\n\n25.\n\nOn 22 December 2017, Respondent informed the Tribunal that there had been no official settlement negotiations initiated to that date and therefore it could not comment on Claimant\u2019s request to stay the proceeding. Respondent also informed the Tribunal that it had already filed on 18 December 2017, its objections under Rule 41(5) in hard copy via express mail delivery.\n\n26.\n\nOn 27 December 2017, the Centre acknowledged receipt on 22 December 2017, of one original hard copy of Kosovo\u2019s Preliminary Objections under Rule 41(5) dated 18 December 2017, (the \"**Application**\"), along with exhibits R-1 through R-10. The Centre noted that the package did not contain the six additional copies mentioned in Kosovo\u2019s cover letter. The Centre also attached: (i) a copy of the shipment label which the Centre received with Kosovo\u2019s package; and (ii) the shipping information provided on the FedEx website based on the package tracking number. According to these documents, Respondent\u2019s Application was dispatched on 20 December 2017, and was delivered at the seat of the Centre on 22 December 2017.\n\n27.\n\nBy letter dated 29 December 2017, the Tribunal noted that, absent confirmation by both Parties that settlement negotiations were underway, the stay of the proceeding as requested by Claimant could not be granted at that stage. The Tribunal also noted that it appeared that Respondent\u2019s Application was not \"delivered at the seat of the Centre [...] before the close of business on the indicated date,\" as required by ICSID Administrative and Financial Regulation 29(2). The Tribunal however invited (i) Claimant to provide comments on the timeliness of Respondent\u2019s Application by 3 January 2018, and (ii) Respondent to respond to Claimant\u2019s comments, if any, by 5 January 2018. The Tribunal noted that it would then decide whether it would entertain Respondent\u2019s objections under Rule 41(5).

In its notification, Respondent noted, *inter alia*, that it \"[did] not request the presence of any of the Claimant\u2019s witnesses at the oral hearing, because the written witness testimony does not contain statements of sufficient precision to be tested by oral interrogation.\"\n\n100.\n\nOn 25 September 2019, the Tribunal held a pre-hearing organizational meeting with the Parties by telephone conference.\n\n101.\n\nOn 27 September 2019, Respondent, on behalf of the Parties, asked the Tribunal to formally confirm the postponement of the hearing, which the Tribunal did on the same date.

Finally, the Tribunal asked Respondent to confirm that: (i) in the event that the Tribunal find those statements to be sufficient, it intended to cross-examine all those witnesses; and (ii) it anticipated no further cross-examination.\n\n117.\n\nOn 28 November 2019, Claimant responded to the questions that the Tribunal asked on 21 November 2019.\n\n118.\n\nOn 29 November 2019, the Tribunal gave Respondent the opportunity to reply to the Tribunal's questions by 2 December 2019.\n\n119.\n\nOn 2 December 2020, Respondent: (i) confirmed its intent to cross-examine Messrs.

FACTUAL BACKGROUND**\n--------------------------\n\n136.\n\nIn this Section, the Tribunal provides an account of the history of the dispute. The Parties are in agreement on the majority of facts and circumstances reported here. Where a pertinent fact is alleged by one party and disputed by the other, that will be briefly indicated.\n\n137.\n\nClaimant, Mabco, initiated the present proceedings against Kosovo over a dispute arising out of the privatization and ownership of the Grand Hotel, a major hotel in Pristina, Kosovo. Claimant brought its proceedings under both the Agreement between the Swiss Confederation and the Republic of Kosovo on the Promotion and Reciprocal Protection of Investments, which entered into force on 13 June 2012 (\"**the BIT**\")4 and Kosovo's Law on Foreign Investment. Due to the fact that claims asserted in this proceeding do not all have the same dates of accrual, certain of them are subject to the Foreign Investment Law No. 02/L-33, enacted on 21 November 2005 and entering into force upon promulgation by the Special Representative of the United Nations Secretary-General in April 2006 (hereinafter \"**2005 Foreign Investment Law**\"), and others are subject to the Foreign Investment Law No. 04/L-220, which entered into force on 24 January 2014 (hereinafter \"**2014 Foreign****Investment Law**\").5 As appropriate, all references to the Foreign Investment Law will indicate the applicable version. Claimant selected ICSID as the administering institution.\n\nExh. C-1: BIT.\n\nExh. C-2: 2005 Foreign Investment Law; Exhs. C-18/R-19: 2014 Foreign Investment Law.\n\n138.\n\nClaimant asserts that Respondent violated its obligations under both the BIT and the Foreign Investment Law, primarily by unlawful expropriation of Claimant\u2019s property, denial of fair and equitable treatment and denial of justice.6\n\nClaimant initially also invoked the principle of national treatment, but did not develop its position on that issue.\n\n139.\n\nBy way of relief, Claimant requests compensation in the amount of EUR 4m, while reserving the right to adjust that amount going forward.7 During the course of the proceedings Claimant stated that it not only lost its EUR 4m investment in the Grand Hotel, but also lost benefits of ownership of the shares it claims to have acquired, without however quantifying that loss.\n\nRfA, paras. 59-60.\n\n**A. CENTRAL ENTITIES AND INDIVIDUALS INVOLVED IN THE DISPUTE**\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\n140.\n\nThe following entities and individuals figure importantly in the present dispute:\n\n**(1)** ***Grand Hotel***\n-------------------------\n\n141.\n\nThe NewCo Grand Hotel L.L.C., a limited liability company incorporated under the laws of Kosovo, was the owner of the Grand Hotel Pristina located in Pristina.\n\n142.\n\nUntil the end of the war in Kosovo in June 1999, Grand Hotel was a \"socially-owned property\" (hereinafter \"**SOE**\") known by the name of \"SOE Sloga\" and held by the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia until its dissolution in 1992. In 2002, the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (hereinafter \"**UNMIK**\"), which had been established in Kosovo in 1999 pursuant to UN Security Council Resolution 1244 to help launch the rebuilding of Kosovo following the Kosovo War, entrusted management of the Grand Hotel and other SOEs to an entity by the name of the Kosovo Trust Agency (hereinafter \"**the KTA**\"). The KTA managed and dealt with the privatization of some 500 SOEs.\n\n**(2)** ***The Privatization Agency of Kosovo***\n------------------------------------------------\n\n143.\n\nShortly after Kosovo\u2019s declaration of independence on 17 February 2008, the KTA was transformed into the Kosovo Privatization Agency (hereinafter \"**the PAK**\").8\n\nExh. C-11: Law No. 04/L-034 on The Privatization Agency of Kosovo of 2011; Exh. C-12: Law No. 05/L-080 on amending and supplementing Law No. 04/L-034 on The Privatization Agency of Kosovo, dated 14 December 2015.\n\n144.\n\nJust as the KTA, the PAK was charged with administering the SOEs and disposing of their assets by creating new companies (\"**NewCos**\") and offering them for sale in a tender process.\n\n145.\n\nThe initial chairman of the PAK\u2019s board of directors was Mr. Dino Asanaj. He was succeeded in 2012 by Mr. Naser Osmani.\n\n**(3)** ***Mabco Constructions, S.A.***\n---------------------------------------\n\n146.\n\nMabco is a Swiss legal entity engaged in the construction and engineering business, founded and owned by Mr. Behgjet Pacolli. Mabco is a subsidiary of the Mabetex Group, a consortium of companies operating in different sectors.\n\n147.\n\nMabco alleges in this proceeding to have made an investment in the Grand Hotel in Pristina, Kosovo at the time that the hotel underwent privatization.\n\n**(4)** ***Mabetex Group Switzerland***\n---------------------------------------\n\n148.\n\nMabetex Group Switzerland (hereinafter \"**Mabetex**\") is a Swiss company comprised of a large number of companies in addition to Claimant. It is specialized in civil and industrial planning, carried out through a large number of subsidiaries, including Claimant. It was founded and is owned by Mr. Behgjet Pacolli.\n\n**(5)** ***Mr. Behgjet Pacolli***\n---------------------------------\n\n149.\n\nMr. Behgjet Pacolli, a Kosovo and Swiss national, is the founder and president of Mabetex.9 He regularly represents Mabetex and its affiliates including Mabco.10 He was, until 2010, Head of Claimant's Managing Board, a position to which his brother Mr. Afrim Pacolli succeeded in 2010.\n\nExh. R-12: Excerpt from website of Mabetex Group - Landing Page, http://www.mabetexgroup.com.\n\nCl. Counter-Mem. on Jurisd., para. 15.\n\n150.\n\nAt the time of filing of the present claim, Mr. Pacolli was also First Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Kosovo. For a short period in 2011, Mr. Pacolli was President of the Republic of Kosovo. Between 2011 and 2014 he served as First Deputy Prime Minister of the Republic of Kosovo. Before 2011, he occupied no official government post in Kosovo.\n\n**(6)** ***Mr. Selim Pacolli***\n-------------------------------\n\n151.\n\nMr. Selim Pacolli (hereinafter \"**Selim Pacolli**,\" to distinguish him from Mr. Behgjet Pacolli), a brother of Mr. Behgjet Pacolli, is a businessman, serving at the time of filing of the present claim as Deputy Mayor of Pristina. Prior to his appointment as Deputy Mayor, he on occasion represented Mabetex in Kosovo.\n\n152.\n\nFrom 2011 to 2018, Selim Pacolli was General Director of the Swiss Diamond Hotel Pristina, a Mabetex property.\n\n**(7)** ***Unio Commerce - UTC***\n---------------------------------\n\n153.\n\nN.T.P. Unio-Commerce (hereinafter \"**UTC**\") is a company owned by Mr. Zelqif Berisha, a national of Kosovo. At the time of the filing of the present claim, UTC became a limited liability company, Unio-Commerce Sh.p.k., incorporated under the laws of the Republic of Kosovo and registered with the Business Registration Agency. Mr. Berisha is its owner and director.\n\n**(8)** ***Mr. Zelqif Berisha***\n--------------------------------\n\n154.\n\nAs noted (para. 153 *supra*), Mr. Zelqif Berisha is owner and director of UTC.\n\n**(9)** ***NTSH Eurokoha-Reisen***\n----------------------------------\n\n155.\n\nNTSH Eurokoha-Reisen (hereinafter \"**NTSH**\") is a business owned by Mr. Remzi Ejupi and registered under the laws of the Republic of Kosovo, with branches in Switzerland and Germany.

PRIVATIZATION AND THE TENDER OF SHARES IN THE GRAND HOTEL**\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n160.\n\nThe KTA, and thereafter the PAK, conducted the privatization of Kosovo's SOEs through a Special Spin-Off Privatization Procedure11 that entailed the creation of a new company (hereinafter \"**NewCo**\"), to which an SOE's assets were transferred, followed by a public tender for bids for purchase of the NewCo's assets. The formal name of the NewCo holding the Grand Hotel as an asset was the NewCo Grand Hotel L.L.C.\n\nExh. R-14: Rules ofTender for the Privatization of the Grand Hotel, 20 December 2005 (\"Tender Rules\").\n\n161.\n\nUnder the Special Spin-Off Rules adopted on 20 December 2005, the buyer of an asset was obligated to maintain operation of the enterprise, while at the same time investing in it a prescribed level of capital and retaining a minimum number of employees for a minimum period of time following conclusion of the purchase agreement. These obligations were spelled out in a commitment agreement annexed to the purchase agreement. Under a commitment agreement, the KTA had a share call option, i.e., a right of withdrawal of shares, in the event of non-compliance with the Special Spin-Off Privatization Procedure obligations.\n\n162.\n\nOn 1 September 2005, the PAK issued a tender for bids, due in February 2006, for purchase of the Grand Hotel. Among the bidders, and the eventual awardee, was UTC, which had submitted a bid of EUR 8,160,000.00.12 The award was announced in early April 2006.\n\nCl. Counter-Mem. on Jurisd., para. 36.\n\n**C. AGREEMENT AMONG CO-OWNERS**\n--------------------------------\n\n163.\n\nUnder the Tender Rules, UTC, as successful bidder, was required to deposit the purchase price in the KTA\u2019s designated escrow account within 20 days of notification of the award.13 According to Claimant,14 UTC did not have sufficient funds to purchase the shares of the Grand Hotel for the bid price.\n\nExh. R-14: Tender Rules, Sec. 11.1.\n\nCl. Counter-Mem. on Jurisd., para. 34.\n\n164.\n\nAccording to Mr. Remzi Ejupi, in or around January 2006, Mr. Ahmet Shala contacted him asking that he and Mr. Pacolli participate as bidders in the tender process. Mr. Pacolli declined to do so, but Mr. Ejupi did make a bid, though he did not win.15 Mr. Ejupi further testified that Mr. Shala later contacted him again, informing him that the final winner of the bid, Mr. Zelqif Berisha, did not have sufficient funds to pay the purchase price for the Grand Hotel or to fulfill the commitments associated with the privatization, and asking him to convince Mr. Pacolli to join him in investing in the hotel.16 Mr. Pacolli testified that Mr. Shala\u2019s reason for doing so was the need to avoid annulment of the procedure, which would necessitate a retendering.17 Also, according to Mr. Ejupi, Mr. Shala was concerned that having to launch a retendering process would reflect badly on the KTA, which already had a poor reputation.18 Further, according to Mr. Ejupi, Mr. Shala assured him that he would take care of everything and see to it that the shares were distributed in accordance with the investors\u2019 participation in the purchase price.19\n\nEjupi witness stmt, Exh.

CWS-4, para. 13.\n\n165.\n\nAccording to Mr. Pacolli, he then received a call from Mr. Ejupi informing him that Mr. Shala had indeed sought to convince him to participate in lending UTC financial support, and to enlist Mr. Pacolli in that enterprise.20 Mr. Ejupi recalls telling Mr. Pacolli on that call that Mr. Berisha, whom Mr. Pacolli did not know, was a good businessperson,21 and that Mr. Shala assured him that the purchase would be formalized and the shares registered.22 Although Mr. Pacolli did not know Mr. Berisha, the prospect of investing in, and renovating, a hotel as prestigious as the Grand Hotel, and thereby boosting tourism in Kosovo, was attractive to him.23\n\nExh.

CWS-4, para. 8.\n\n166.\n\nMr. Pacolli testified that there followed a meeting in Vienna with Messrs. Berisha and Ejupi at which Mr. Berisha told him that he had already paid EUR 500,000 as a deposit for being admitted to the tender but could not afford to pay the balance of the total price of about EUR 8m. At that meeting, Messrs. Berisha, Ejupi and Pacolli decided by oral agreement, allegedly as representatives of their respective companies, that they would purchase the Grand Hotel shares, with Claimant and NTSH contributing EUR 4m and EUR 1 m, respectively, to the purchase of the Grand Hotel. They did so on the understanding that Mr. Berisha would manage the project for a period of two years and that he, Mr. Pacolli, would make the investments to fulfill the owners\u2019 commitments.24 Mr. Ejupi supports this account.25\n\nBehgjet Pacolli witness stmt, Exh. CWS-1, para. 9; Behgjet Pacolli 2d witness stmt, Exh. CWS-3, para. 9. See Cl. oralargum., tr. 30:11 - 30:15.\n\nEjupi witness stmt, Exh. CWS-4, para. 15.\n\n167.\n\nAt any extraordinary meeting, the Claimant\u2019s shareholders then approved the deal.26 It was understood that, while Mr. Pacolli owned Mabetex, it was Mabetex\u2019s affiliate Mabco, in whose specialization, construction, the project fell.27\n\nBehgjet Pacolli witness stmt, Exh. CWS-1, para. 9.\n\nBehgjet Pacolli witness stmt, Exh. CWS-1, para. 8.\n\n168.\n\nMr. Pacolli testified that the arrangement was known to the KTA and to Mr. Shala in particular.28 Mr. Ejupi testified that, during the year 2006, he had three meetings with Mr. Shala, all on the subject of his and Mr. Pacolli\u2019s participation.29\n\nBehgjet Pacolli 2d witness stmt, Exh. CWS-3, para. 10.\n\nEjupi witness stmt, Exh. CWS-4, para. 16.\n\n169.\n\nHowever, Mr. Shala testified that any suggestion that he invited or encouraged Messrs. Pacolli or Ejupi to invest in the Grand Hotel is untrue.30 He denied inviting or encouraging any potential investor to do so.31 He added that no one could qualify as a buyer of a privatized NewCo without participating in the tender process.\n\nShala witness stmt, p. 1; Resp. oral argum., tr. 12:12 - 13:7.\n\nShala witness stmt, p. 2.\n\n**D. TRANSFER OF CAPITAL**\n--------------------------\n\n170.\n\nPursuant to the agreement among Messrs. Pacolli, Ejupi and Berisha, Claimant transferred EUR 4m to NTSH,32 which forwarded the sum of EUR 4,000,600.00 that sum to UTC,33 which in turn paid the bid amount of EUR 8,160,000.00, including 4,011,000 EUR as Claimant\u2019s share, into the escrow account designated by the KTA. According to Claimant, all of these transfers occurred on a single day, 28 April 2006.34 (As explained below, paras. 353-355, *infra,* the payment did not proceed smoothly, but was ultimately received.) According to Claimant, these arrangements enabled UTC, as winner of the tender, to enter into an Agreement for the \"Sale of Ordinary Shares in Grand Hotel\" (hereinafter \"**Purchase Agreement**\") on 10 August 2006, whereby the SOE Sloga formally undertook to sell the shares of Grand Hotel to UTC.35\n\nExh.

Claimant affirms that the EUR 4m payment incontrovertibly represents Claimant\u2019s contribution to the purchase of the Grand Hotel shares. Respondent disagrees, arguing that the record contains no proper documentation of the circumstances of, or reasons for, the transfer,36 though the wire transfers mentioned, respectively, \"Agreement\"37 and \"Payment under the Contract.\"38 The details of the Parties\u2019 competing understandings of the EUR 4m transfer are examined below (paras. 362-370, *infra*).\n\nResp.

C-21 : Wire transfer confirmation, 29 April 2006.\n\n172.\n\nOn 3 August 2006, shortly before the Purchase Agreement was signed on 10 August 2006, Mr. Pacolli committed to providing to UTC\u2019s bank a guarantee as required under the Commitment Agreement attached to the Purchase Agreement.39 The guarantee, in the amount of EUR 20.2m was actually given on 21 March 2012.40\n\nExh. C-66: Letter from Behgjet Pacolli to Raiffeisen Bank, 3 August 2006. The letter of guarantee provided:  \n[O]*perating costs concerning Grand Hotel New Co located in Pristina will be provided by me personally and the group of companies as mentioned as listed... All financing ofGrand Hotel New Co.... will be covered by me personally and the group of my companies without any need of mortgage loan.*\n\nExh. C-39: Performance Guarantee.\n\n**E. PURCHASE AGREEMENT**\n-------------------------\n\n173.\n\nOn 10 August 2006, the KTA on behalf of SOE Sloga and the Grand Hotel then issued a Declaration of Transfer, providing for the transfer of the real property and other rights of the Grand Hotel to Grand Hotel L.L.C., (hereinafter \"**Grand Hotel**\")41 shares of which became the object of the present dispute.\n\nExh. C-16: Transfer Declaration, 10 August 2006.\n\n174.\n\nOn the same day, a purchase agreement for the shares in the Grand Hotel was signed by the KTA on behalf of the SOE Sloga and Mr. Berisha on behalf of UTC.42\n\nExh. C-15: Purchase Agreement; Cl. post-hearing br., para. 16.\n\n175.\n\nArticle 5.1.3 of the Purchase Agreement provided:\n\n*The Buyer is purchasing the Shares for its own use and not as an agent for a third party and, during the tender for this company, the Buyer has not formed any informal or formal undisclosed agreements or consortiums between two or more bidders or with any undisclosed third party.*\n\n176.\n\nAttached to the Purchase Agreement was a Commitment Agreement (hereinafter \"**Commitment Agreement**\") among Mr. Berisha on behalf of UTC, KTA on behalf of SOE Sloga and the Grand Hotel LLC. It contained the following stipulations:\n\na. UTC committed, pursuant to para. 2 of the Commitment Agreement, to invest a minimum of EUR 20,200,000.00 as capital by the end of the commitment period, i.e. two years after the entry into force of the Commitment Agreement (\"Commitment Period\").\n\nb. UTC committed, pursuant to para. 3.1.1 of the Commitment Agreement, to employ a minimum of 270 full-time employees six months after entry into force of the Commitment Agreement.\n\nc. UTC committed, pursuant to para. 3.1.2 of the Commitment Agreement, to maintain the number of 270 employees for a period of twelve months after the entry into force of the Commitment Agreement.\n\nd. UTC committed, pursuant to para. 3.2.1 of the Commitment Agreement, to employ minimum 540 full-time employees twelve months after the entry into force of the Commitment Agreement.\n\ne. UTC committed, pursuant to para. 3.2.2 of the Commitment Agreement, to maintain the number of 540 employees to the end of the Commitment Period.\n\n177.\n\nParagraph 6.2 of the Commitment Agreement gave the KTA an option to purchase the entire issued share capital of Grand Hotel LLC in the event of UTC\u2019s failure to honor its commitments under the Commitment Agreement.\n\n178.\n\nOn 13 October 2006, the shares in the Grand Hotel were transferred to UTC, which thereupon became the owner of the Grand Hotel, together with all the assets and rights pertaining to it.\n\n**F. AGREEMENT OF GOOD UNDERSTANDING**\n--------------------------------------\n\n179.\n\nClaimant maintains that in January 2007,43 in order to formalize the prior arrangements among UTC, NTSH and Claimant, Messrs. Pacolli, Ejupi and Berisha signed an \"Agreement of Good Understanding\" (hereinafter \"**AGU**\").44 Under the AGU, UTC would become the formal owner of the shares of Grand Hotel for a period of two years. Thus, according to paragraph 2 of the AGU, UTC was initially the \"legal purchaser,\" while Messrs. Ejupi and Pacolli were the \"actual purchaser[s].\"45 When the two years passed, Claimant, NTSH and UTC were to officially become joint owners of the shares, with the shares distributed among the three owners as follows: UTC 40%, NTSH 20% and Claimant 40%.46 Under the AGU, Mr. Pacolli\u2019s brother, Selim Pacolli was appointed as Mr. Behgjet\u2019s representative on the board of the Grand Hotel L.L.C.\n\nIn some papers, the date of execution of the AGU is given as 22/28 Dec. 2006.\n\nExh. C-17: AGU; Behgjet Pacolli witness stmt, Exh. CWS-1, para. 10.\n\nCl. Supp. to RfA, para. 21.\n\nRfA, para. 45.\n\n180.\n\nClaimant maintains that when Messrs. Pacolli, Ejupi, and Berisha signed the AGU, they did so on behalf of Claimant, NTSH and UTC, respectively. More specifically, Claimant maintains that in all the discussions pertaining to the privatization, Mr. Pacolli, as President of the Board of Claimant, acted as representative of Claimant.47 According to Claimant, the three individuals were to be understood, and were understood, as acting on behalf of the companies that they respectively owned, and Mr. Ejupi affirmed that this was their understanding.48 UTC, having paid the purchase price, and Mr. Berisha, having signed the AGU, the latter thereafter was acting vis-\u00e0-vis the KTA on behalf of all three companies. Mr. Selim Pacolli testified that his brother informed him of all the foregoing events and understandings.49\n\nCl. Counter-Mem. on Jurisd., paras. 39-40. According to Claimant:  \n*The facts as established clearly suggest that the AGU was concluded by the Co-Owners with respect to the joint purchase of the shares of Grand Hotel. As undisputed by Respondent, Mr. Behgjet Pacolli was at the time of the conclusion of the AGU the president of the board of Claimant. In all the discussions regarding the privatization of Grand Hotel, he always acted within its capacity as representative, so didhe, when he concludedthe AGU...*\n\nEjupi witness stmt, Exh. CWS-4, para. 17.\n\nSelim Pacolli witness stmt, Exh. CWS-2, para. 8.\n\n181.\n\nAccording to Behgjet Pacolli, the KTA knew about and approved of the agreement and the source of funds.50 However, according to Mr. Lluka, the PAK was never made aware of the AGU or any other agreement between Mr. Berisha, on the one hand, and Messrs. Pacolli and Ejupi, on the other.51\n\nBehgjet Pacolli witness stmt, Exh. CWS-1, paras. 10, 15. See Cl. oral argum., tr. 30:11 - 30:15, 41:10 - 41.18.\n\nLluka witness stmt, para. 17.\n\n182.\n\nRespondent maintains that Messrs. Pacolli and Ejupi signed the AGU in their personal capacities only.52 Respondent cites in support of this proposition the fact that the title page of the AGU, the Recitals, Article III, Article XIII lit. b, and the signature page refer to the Contracting Parties as \"Co-owners\" in their capacity as natural persons. In sum, Claimant as such was not involved in any of the steps relating to the privatization of the Grand Hotel.53 Claimant reads the record entirely differently, identifying numerous ways in which Claimant manifested its involvement in the various transactions.54\n\nResp. Mem. on Jurisd., para. 42.\n\nResp. Mem. on Jurisd., para. 103.\n\nCl. Counter-Mem. on Jurisd., para. 43.\n\n183.\n\nRespondent also claims that uncertainty surrounds the question of what exactly the term \"Hotel Grand Pristina\" signified in the context of the AGU.55 Respondent further notes that the name of the Claimant is not mentioned in the AGU. Claimant strongly disagrees, quoting at length from the AGU, to establish that the AGU's import was entirely clear. In fact, the Grand Hotel shares were not registered with the Kosovo Business Registration Agency, and, when the two-year period elapsed, UTC failed to transfer the shares to Claimant and NTSH, or to Messrs. Pacolli or Ejupi.\n\nResp. Mem. on Jurisd., paras. 43-44.\n\n**G. WITHDRAWAL OF THE SHARES**\n-------------------------------\n\n184.\n\nAt this point, Claimant's and Respondent's narratives diverge even more markedly.\n\n185.\n\nClaimant asserts that starting in 2008, UTC ignored Claimant's and NTSH's ownership in the Grand Hotel, refused to accept Claimant's offer of the funds needed to maintain the investment and meet the owners' commitments under the Purchase Agreement. Claimant testified that UTC went so far as to deny Claimant access to the Grand Hotel,56 thereby preventing Claimant from making the required investments. According to Claimant, had its proposal been accepted, the obligations under the Commitment Agreement would have been performed.57 Claimant further asserts that it later learned that UTC had deliberately taken these acts and omissions in collaboration with the PAK, for the purpose of either extorting Claimant and NTSH or excluding them from the project.58\n\nCl.

C-31: Official Memorandum of the Republic of Kosovo, Ministry of Internal Affairs, Police General Directorate, Crimes Investigation Directorate, 30 November 2012, p. 5.\n\n186.\n\nHaving determined that UTC had failed to comply with its obligations under the Commitment Agreement, the PAK, pursuant to the Agreement, engaged an independent auditor to conduct an inquiry into the matter. A first audit report,59 issued on 16 November 2009, and covering the period from 13 August 2006 to 13 August 2009, found that only EUR 1,244,373.33 out of the required EUR 20,200,000.00 had been invested. As for employment commitments, the report found that in the first year, UTC employed on average 84.11 more employees than required; in the second year, on average 121.58 fewer employees than required; and in the third year 1 more employee than required. The PAK made it known that it was, as a consequence, contemplating withdrawal of the shares in the Grand Hotel.60\n\nExh. R-15: First Audit Report, 16 November 2009.\n\nCl. Counter-Mem. on Jurisd., para. 47.\n\n187.\n\nOn 21 October 2011, Selim Pacolli, having learned of this possibility, sent a letter to the PAK in his capacity as Claimant\u2019s representative on the board of Grand Hotel L.L.C., urging that the shares not be withdrawn.61 Both Selim Pacolli62 and Behgjet Pacolli63 affirm that the letter was written on behalf of Claimant. The letter reminded the PAK that Mr. Pacolli had contributed EUR 4m for purchase of the Grand Hotel shares and, by virtue of the AGU, formally acquired co-ownership of the Grand Hotel. It also informed the PAK that UTC had undertaken works, without consultation of Messrs Ejupi and Pacolli, that did not benefit the restoration of the hotel. Finally, it assured the PAK that it was prepared itself to fulfill all the commitments made under the Purchase Agreement, provided it was given access to the hotel, and it asked the PAK to allow it to do so.64\n\nExh.

C-23 : Letter of PAK to Mabco, 5 March 2012.\n\nRfA, para. 46.\n\n189.\n\nRespondent further asserts that, by 2011, UTC had still not fully complied with its commitment to invest at least EUR 20.2m or to employ and maintain at least 540 employees. Accordingly, the PAK continued to contemplate exercising its right under the Purchase Agreement to withdraw the shares.67\n\nResp. Mem. on Jurisd., para. 52.\n\n190.\n\nOn 14 December 2011, Selim Pacolli wrote to the PAK once again, reiterating his view that the PAK\u2019s withdrawal of the shares would violate Claimant\u2019s ownership rights. Claimant asserts that, once again, Selim Pacolli was writing on behalf of Claimant.68\n\nCl. Counter-Mem. on Jurisd., para. 51; Behgjet Pacolli witness stmt, Exh.

It decided that the share call option should be exercised, but that UTC should be given a final chance to find new investors who would commit to making the required investments.69\n\nLluka witness stmt, para. 10.\n\n192.\n\nAccording to Mr. Lluka, there followed a concerted effort to find external investors who would make the investments in the Grand Hotel that were required. He testified that, in this connection, the PAK held talks with a number of interested investors.70\n\nLluka witness stmt, para. 12.\n\n193.\n\nMr. Lluka testified that, in early January, the Board received a notice of claim by Mr. Pacolli, in his individual capacity, and Mrs. Ejupi, as representative of NTSH, demanding recognition of their rights as shareholders and reversal by the PAK of its 16 December 2011 decision.71 According to Claimant, the PAK then invited Messrs. Pacolli, Berisha and Ejupi to a January 2012 meeting at which they were informed that Mr. Naser Osmani, a member of the Board of the PAK, had been appointed \"commission chairman on the Grand Hotel issue.\"72 According to Claimant, they were also advised that if they provided certain documentation, the PAK would not withdraw the shares and would register UTC, NTSH and Claimant as co-owners of the Grand Hotel in the Kosovo Business Registry. Such documentation, according to Claimant was to include a bank guarantee for investments to be made in the amount of EUR 20.2m, as well as a business plan.73 According to Selim Pacolli, Claimant provided all the documentation that was requested.74\n\nLluka witness stmt, para. 11.\n\nCl.

Berisha, Pacolli and Ejupi may have agreed.86 Mr. Lluka testified that the PAK never accepted Mr. Pacolli's claim that he was already an investor in the Grand Hotel based on an alleged agreement with Mr. Berisha.\n\nExh.

The purpose of such documents was strictly to assess the applicants\u2019 reliability as investors.88\n\nLluka witness stmt, para. 16.\n\nLluka witness stmt, para. 16.\n\n199.\n\nOn 14 March 2012, the PAK wrote to Selim Pacolli reiterating its view that, while the PAK was a party to the Purchase Agreement, the Agreement identified only one buyer, namely UTC, so that Messrs. Pacolli and Ejupi were third parties only.89 According to Claimant, the PAK nevertheless postponed its decision on withdrawal of the shares that was initially scheduled for 15 March 2012.90\n\nExh.

Counter-Mem. on Jurisd., para. 64.\n\n200.\n\nAccording to Claimant, there followed a series of attempts at extortion on the PAK\u2019s part. First, certain persons with close links to the PAK and its then director, Mr. Dino Asanaj, allegedly asked Messrs. Pacolli and Ejupi to pay an additional EUR 4m in order for the shares of the Grand Hotel to be registered, or else the shares would not be registered, and would actually be withdrawn.91 Mr. Ejupi confirms that these extortion attempts were made, and were arranged specifically by Mr. Asanaj.92 The so-called \"intermediaries of PAK\" included Astrit Haraqija, former minister of finance; Uke Rugova, the son of the former President and deputy in the National Assembly; and Gazmend Abrashi, a businessman and former bidder for the Grand Hotel.93 Mr. Pacolli says that he refused to make the payment.\n\nExh.

Pacolli and Ejupi went to the media with information about the PAK's alleged extortion attempts.96\n\nBehgjet Pacolli testimony, tr. 172:21 - 172:23; Cl.

Respondent points out that, upon investigation, the prosecution found insufficient evidence to take the allegations any further, with no indictment, much less trial.100\n\nResp. Reply on Jurisd., paras. 110, 121-124.\n\n204.\n\nHowever, Claimant maintains that UTC\u2019s earlier failures of performance under the Purchase Agreement and its refusal of Claimant\u2019s financial contribution were in fact part of a plan by which UTC collaborated with the chair and deputy chair of the PAK to extort both Claimant and NTSH through threats that their shares in the Grand Hotel would be withdrawn if they did not make further payments.101\n\nExh., C-31: Official Memorandum of the Republic of Kosovo, Ministry of Internal Affairs, Police General Directorate, Crimes Investigation Directorate, 30 November 2012, p. 5; Exh.

However, according to Respondent, while Mr. Berisha represented UTC and Mrs. Ejupi represented NTSH, Mr. Selim Pacolli represented only Mr. Behgjet Pacolli and Mabetex, but not Claimant.103\n\nExh.

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS IN KOSOVO**\n----------------------------------\n\n217.\n\nIn this case, there are two relevant sets of legal proceedings in the courts of Kosovo.\n\n218.\n\nFirst, in 2007, Messrs. Pacolli, as president and CEO Mabetex Group, and NTSH brought suit against Mr. Berisha in Municipal Court in Pristina,125 seeking recognition that the plaintiffs were owners of 40% and 20% of the shares, respectively. The Municipal Court ruled in favor of the plaintiffs, affirming their share ownership. However, the District Court of Pristina then reversed that judgment. Claimant\u2019s view is that the District Court made no ruling on the merits, but merely remanded the case to the Municipal Court for clarification of the question whether the suit was brought in the plaintiffs\u2019 personal capacity or on behalf of their respective companies.126 According to Claimant, on remand, the Municipal Court never decided the ownership question because by that time the shares had already been withdrawn.127 Respondent takes a different view of the District Court judgment. According to it, the Court found that Mr. Pacolli did not obtain any shares or other interest in the Grand Hotel,128 so holding on the ground that there was no written contract for the transfer of ownership,129 that the AGU lacked the required elements to constitute a company statute,130 and that the alleged shareholding was never registered.131\n\nExh.

On 25 June 2012, a first instance panel of the Special Chamber denied UTC\u2019s request for interim relief, but the Appellate Panel reversed that decision, and granted the requested relief in part. On 20 March 2013, the Special Chamber rejected UTC\u2019s claim on the merits.133\n\nExh.

STATEMENT OF CLAIM**\n---------------------------\n\n224.\n\nClaimant alleges that Respondent expropriated its investment and denied it fair and equitable treatment, while also committing a denial of justice - all in violation of its obligations under the BIT and the Foreign Investment Law.142\n\nClaimant invokes the principle of national treatment as well, but does not develop that argument.\n\n225.\n\nWith respect to expropriation, Claimant invokes Articles 5(1) and 5(2) of the BIT:\n\n*Article 5*\n\n*(1) Neither of the Parties shall take, either directly or indirectly, measures of expropriation, nationalization or any other measure having the same nature or the same effect against investments of investors of the other Contracting Party...*\n\n*(2)* [D]*ue process of law includes the right of an investor of a Contracting Party, which claims to be affected by expropriation by the other Contracting Party, to prompt review of its case, including the valuation of its investment and the payment of compensation in accordance with the provisions of this Article, by a judicial authority or another competent and independent authority of the latter Contracting Party.*\n\n226.\n\nWith respect to fair and equitable treatment, Claimant invokes Article 4(1) of the BIT:\n\n*Article 4*\n\n*(1) Each Contracting Party shall in its territory accord to investments and returns of investors of the other Contracting Party at all times fair and equitable treatment as well as full protection and security. Neither Contracting Party shall impair, by unreasonable or discriminatory measures, maintenance, use, enjoyment, extensions or disposal of such investments.*\n\n227.\n\nThe provision applicable to the expropriation claim under the 2005 Foreign Investment Law is the following:143\n\n*Article 8*\n\n*8.1.* [An investment in Kosovo made by a foreign investor] *shall... not be subject to any act of expropriation by or attributable to Kosovo.*\n\n*8.2. Notwithstanding the prohibition contained in Article 8.1, Kosovo may take an act of expropriation affecting an asset of a foreign investor, foreign investment organization or foreign person, if the act of expropriation:*\n\n*a. is for a clearly defined and legitimate public purpose;*\n\n*b. is not inspired by any discriminatory objective;*\n\n*c. is carried out in a non-discriminatory manner;*\n\n*d. is carried out in accordance with due process of law; and*\n\n*e. is accompanied by the prompt payment of adequate and effective compensation.*\n\nFor reasons explained below in connection with Respondent\u2019s objections *ratio temporis* objections (paras. 464-469, *infra*), Claimant\u2019s expropriation claim is subject to the 2005 rather than the 2014 Foreign Investment Law.\n\n228.\n\nInsofar as Claimant\u2019s fair and equitable treatment claim relates to its claimed ownership of the Grand Hotel shares, the 2005 Foreign Investment Law is applicable.144 The relevant provisions follow:\n\n*Article 3*\n\n*3.1. Kosovo shall accord fair and equitable treatment to foreign investors and their investments in Kosovo. Kosovo shall also provide foreign investors and their investments with full and constant protection and security. In no case shall the treatment, protection or security required by this Article 3.1 be less favorable than that required by international law or any provision of the present law.*\n\n*3.2. Kosovo shall not impair by any unreasonable or discriminatory action or inaction, the operation, management, maintenance, use enjoyment or disposal of a foreign investment organization or other investment by a foreign investor in Kosovo. Kosovo shall in particular not interfere with the lawful activities, rights and legally recognized interests of a foreign investor.*\n\n*3.3. Any public authority that violates or otherwise fails to respect the rights and guarantees provided by the present law to foreign investors and their investments shall be liable to pay compensation... for losses and expenses incurred as a consequence of such violation or failure..*\n\nFor reasons explained below in connection with Respondent\u2019s objections *ratio temporis* objections (paras. 470-473, *infra*), Claimant\u2019s fair and equitable treatment expropriation claim in connection with its alleged ownership of the Grand Hotel is subject to the 2005 rather than the 2014 Foreign Investment Law.\n\n229.\n\nInsofar as Claimant\u2019s fair and equitable treatment claim encompasses its claim of denial of justice, the 2014 Foreign Investment Law is applicable.145 The relevant provisions follow:\n\n*Article 3*\n\n*1. Republic of Kosovo shall accord fair and equitable treatment to foreign investors and their investments in Kosovo with any local investors and local investments.*\n\n*2. Republic of Kosovo shall also provide foreign investors and their investments with full and constant protection and security in accordance with the applicable legislation.*\n\n*3. In no case shall the treatment, protection or security required by this paragraph be less favorable than that required by generally accepted norms of international law or any provision of the present law.*\n\n*4. Republic of Kosovo shall not impair by any unreasonable or discriminatory action or inaction, the operation, management, maintenance, use, enjoyment or disposal of a foreign investment organization or other investment by a foreign investor in the Republic of Kosovo. Republic of Kosovo shall not interfere with the lawful activities, rights and legally recognized interests of a foreign investor.*\n\n*5. Any public authority that violates or otherwise fails to respect the rights and guarantees provided by the present law to foreign investors and their investments shall be liable to pay compensation, in accordance with Article 8 paragraph 2 of this law, for losses and expenses incurred as a consequence of such violation or failure. No type of legal immunity shall serve as bar to the liability created by this Article.*\n\nFor reasons explained below in connection with Respondent\u2019s objections *ratio temporis* objections (paras. 474-479, *infra),* Claimant\u2019s denial of justice claim is subject to the 2014 rather than the 2005 Foreign Investment Law.\n\n**A. CLAIMANT\u2019S INVESTMENT UNDER THE BIT AND THE FOREIGN INVESTMENT LAW**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n230.\n\nIn this proceeding, Claimant maintains that it has made a qualifying investment within the meaning of the BIT, the Foreign Investment Law and the ICSID Convention. The definitions of \"investment\" under the BIT, the Foreign Investment Laws and the ICSID Conventions are different. For that reason, whether Claimant has made an investment must be examined separately for each of these three instruments.\n\n**(1)** ***\"Investment\" within the meaning of the BIT***\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n231.\n\nAccording to Article 2 of the BIT, its provisions apply to investments in the territory of one Contracting Party established in accordance with its laws and regulations by investors of the other Contracting Party, \"whether [made] prior to or after the entry into force of [the BIT].\" However, the BIT does not apply \"to claims and disputes arising out of events which occurred prior to its entry into force.\"\n\n232.\n\nArticle 1(1) of the BIT defines an investment as \"every kind of asset established or acquired by an investor of one Contracting Party in the territory of the other Contracting Party that has such characteristics as the commitment of capital or other resources, the expectation of gain or profit, or the assumption of risk.\" Such an asset may take the form of:\n\n*(a) movable and immovable property as well as any related rights, such as servitudes, mortgages, liens and pledges;*\n\n*(b) a company, or shares, parts or any other kind of participation in a company;*\n\n*(c) claims to money or to any performance having an economic value, except claims to money arising solely out of commercial contracts for the sale of goods and services;*... [and]\n\n*(e) rights conferred pursuant to law, contract or decision of an authority such as concessions, licences, authorizations and permits.*\n\n233.\n\nArticle 1(2) defines \"investor\" to include \"(b) a legal entity, including companies, corporations, business associations and other organisations, which are constituted or otherwise duly organized under the law of that Contracting party and have their seat, together with real economic activities, in the territory of the same Contracting Party.\"\n\n234.\n\nArticle 11 of the BIT contemplates the arbitration of disputes \"between an investor of a Contracting Party and the other Contracting Party regarding an investment of the former made in the territory of the latter... based on an alleged breach of obligations under [the BIT].\"\n\n235.\n\nClaimant maintains that it has established all the requirements under the foregoing provisions of the BIT that must be met in order to qualify as a foreign investor that has made an investment in Kosovo. It maintains that both its shares in the Grand Hotel and its claims to performance of Kosovo\u2019s undertaking to transfer ownership of those shares are assets that constitute investments within the meaning of Article 1(1) of the BIT.146 Claimant specifically argues that legal title to shares is not required to constitute an investment and that beneficial ownership suffices. Its ownership interest consisted of the right to registration of the Grand Hotel shares, thereby formally acquiring ownership of those shares. Thus, the fact that Claimant\u2019s share ownership was not yet registered in Kosovo does not prevent it from constituting an investment.147\n\nCl.

Moreover, as a Swiss entity, it is a foreign investor.\n\n**B. CLAIMANT\u2019S INVESTMENT UNDER THE ICSID CONVENTION**\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n243.\n\nArticle 25(1) defines the jurisdiction of ICSID as follows:\n\n*The jurisdiction of the Centre shall extend to any dispute arising directly out of an investment, between a Contracting State... and a national of another Contracting State, which the parties to the dispute consent in writing to submit to the Centre.*\n\n244.\n\nClaimant maintains that it satisfies the jurisdictional requirements set out in Article 25(1) since:\n\na. the dispute is a legal one arising directly out of an investment (condition *ratione materiae*);\n\nb. the dispute is between a Contracting State and a national of the other Contracting State (condition *ratione personae*); and\n\nc. the parties consented to settlement of the dispute through ICSID arbitration (condition *ratione voluntatis*)*.*149\n\nAccording to Claimant, Respondent gave its consent to arbitration under both the BIT and the Foreign Investment Law.150\n\nCl.

It further claims that the present dispute arises directly out of that investment.153\n\nCl. Counter-Mem. on Jurisd., paras. 163-165.\n\n**IV. STATEMENT OF DEFENSE**\n----------------------------\n\n248.\n\nRespondent contests the jurisdiction of this Tribunal under Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention on numerous grounds,154 including notably that it did not consent to arbitration of the claims asserted by Claimant under either the BIT or the Foreign Investment Law.155\n\nResp. Mem. on Jurisd., para. 73.\n\nResp. Mem. on Jurisd., paras. 129-133; Resp. Reply on Jurisd., paras. 163-172.\n\n249.\n\nFirst, Claimant cannot avail itself of either the BIT or the Foreign Investment Law because it owns no qualifying asset, which is necessary, *ratione materiae*, in order for either of those instruments to apply. It never acquired ownership of, or a right or interest in, the asset at issue in this case.156 Moreover, while the ICSID Convention does not itself define an investment, arbitral jurisprudence has done so. According to the prevailing view, an investment must exhibit the following characteristics: a substantial capital contribution, a certain risk and a certain duration.157 In addition, it may be required to make a substantial contribution to the host State\u2019s economic development.158 According to Respondent, Claimant fails to satisfy any of these requirements. It made no capital contribution, much less a substantial one and, because of that, it assumed no risk, made no investment of the requisite duration, and did not contribute substantially to the host State\u2019s economic development.159\n\nResp. oral argum., tr. 17:8 - 17:23, 19:15 - 19:20; Resp. post-hearing br., paras. 28-32.\n\nSee Exh. RL-43: Christoph Schreuer et al., *The ICSID Convention: A Commentary* (2d ed. 2009) 128-135, 668-671, p. 129.\n\nThe leading case is Exh. CL-28: *Salini Construttori S.p.A & Italstrade S.p.A v. Kingdom of Morocco,* ICSID Case No. ARB/00/4, Decision on Jurisdiction, 31 July 2001.\n\nResp. Mem. on Jurisd., paras. 106, 118-122; Resp. Reply on Jurisd., paras. 282-293.\n\n250.\n\nSecond, Claimant does not qualify as a foreign investor. Since Claimant made no investment, it is not an investor, much less a foreign investor. If any investment was made, it would have been made by Mr. Pacolli in his personal capacity. Being a national of Kosovo, he does not qualify as a foreign investor. Nor can Claimant itself be considered a foreign national, in this case a national of Switzerland, due to the absence of any real economic activity on its part in Switzerland. The Tribunal accordingly lacks jurisdiction *ratione personae*.\n\n251.\n\nThird, the alleged investment is not a protected one under either the BIT or the Foreign Investment Law because, if made, it was made unlawfully under Kosovo law.\n\n252.\n\nFourth, because Respondent did not consent to arbitrate the present dispute, the Tribunal also lacks jurisdiction *ratione voluntatis.* Respondent\u2019s consent to arbitrate was subject under Article 11(2) of the BIT and Article 16(2) of both the 2005 and 2014 Foreign Investment Laws to an \"election of remedies\" requirement.160 Under those provisions, because Claimant first brought litigation over its claims in the courts of Kosovo, it could no longer resort to arbitration over them. Also, under Article 11(1) of the BIT (although not under the Foreign Investment Law), Respondent\u2019s consent to arbitrate was conditional upon Claimant\u2019s engaging with the Respondent in an effort to settle their dispute \"amicably through consultations,\" which Claimant failed to do.\n\nArticle 11 (2) of the BIT: \"[T]he investor may submit the dispute either to the courts or the administrative tribunals of the Contracting Party concerned or to international arbitration.\" (Exh. C-1); Article 16(2) of the 2014 Foreign Investment Law: \"... a foreign investor shall have the right to require that the investment dispute be settled either through litigation before a court of competentjurisdiction in the Republic of Kosovo or through local and international arbitration.\" (Exhs. C-18/R-19).\n\n253.\n\nFifth, Respondent argues that, even if all of the BIT conditions were otherwise met, the tribunal lacks jurisdiction *ratione temporis.* According to Article 2, while the BIT applies to investments made prior to the BIT's entry into force, it does not apply \"to claims and disputes arising out of events which occurred prior to its entry into force.\" (Neither the 2005 nor the 2014 Foreign Investment Law contains such a limitation. On the contrary, the 2014 Law specifically states that \"[t]he present law - and the rights, guarantees, privileges and protections established by the present law - shall apply equally to foreign investors that invested in the Republic of Kosovo prior to the effective date of this law.\"161) According to Respondent, the events giving rise to the dispute occurred on 16 December 2011, which is when the PAK decided to withdraw the shares of Grand Hotel or, at the latest 31 May 2012, which is when the PAK made the decision to execute the withdrawal of shares. Both dates precede the BIT's entry into force on 13 June 2012.162\n\nExhs. C-18/R-19: 2014 Foreign Investment Law, Art. 20.\n\nResp. Reply on Jurisd., paras. 111-115, 156-157.\n\n254.\n\nSixth, the claim advanced in this proceeding is at variance with the scope and purpose of the ICSID Convention.\n\n255.\n\nSeventh, Claimant failed to establish a *prima facie* case on the merits.\n\n256.\n\nRespondent accordingly challenges the jurisdiction of this Tribunal *ratione personae, ratione materiae* and *ratione voluntatis* under the ICSID Convention, the BIT and the Foreign Investment Law, as well as *ratione temporis* under the BIT. The Respondent's jurisdictional objections and Claimant's responses thereto are dealt with in the following sequence:\n\nA. The claim does not arise out of or relate to an investment in Kosovo.\n\nB. Claimant is not a foreign investor.\n\nC. Claimant's alleged ownership interest in shares of Grand Hotel LLC is not a \"protected investment\".\n\nD. Respondent did not give its consent to arbitrate the present dispute.\n\nE. The Tribunal lacks jurisdiction *ratione temporis.*\n\nF. Claim falls outside the scope and purpose of the ICSID Convention.\n\nG. Claimant has failed to establish a *prima facie* cause of action.\n\nEach of these challenges is taken up in turn below.\n\n**A. THE CLAIM DOES NOT ARISE OUT OF OR RELATE TO AN INVESTMENT IN KOSOVO**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n257.\n\nRespondent maintains that Claimant did not make an investment in Kosovo, within the meaning of the relevant instruments. It bases this contention on the following propositions:\n\n(1) Claimant never held any assets relating to the Grand Hotel.\n\n(2) Claimant\u2019s payment of EUR 4m does not constitute evidence of an investment on Claimant\u2019s part.\n\n(3) Claimant did not become an owner of shares by virtue of the AGU.\n\n(4) Claimant did not become an owner of shares by virtue of the Annex Agreement.\n\nThe Tribunal examines each of these propositions in turn.\n\n**(1)** ***Claimant never held any assets relating to the Grand Hotel***\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n(a) Respondent\u2019s Position\n-------------------------\n\n258.\n\nRespondent asserts that Claimant was involved in none of the steps of the tender process. The successful bid was made by UTC, not Claimant.163 Claimant accordingly was a third party and acquired no rights of ownership in the Grand Hotel. Respondent cites Article 5.1.3 of the Purchase Agreement by which UTC itself confirmed that:\n\n[T]*he Buyer is purchasing the Shares for its own use and not as an agent for a third party and during the tender for this Company, the Buyer has not formed any informal or formal undisclosed agreements or consortiums between two or more bidders or with any undisclosed third party.*\n\nAccording to Respondent, whether the alleged investor was Mr. Pacolli or Claimant, it would have been a secret investor in violation of the Tender Rules and the above-quoted provision of the Purchase Agreement.164\n\nResp. Mem. on Jurisd., paras. 73-79.\n\nResp. oral argum., tr. 11:23 - 12:11.\n\n259.\n\nRespondent also contests that Mr. Ahmet Shala invited Claimant to participate in the privatization of the Grand Hotel. It finds that in previous accounts of the transactions given by Mr. Pacolli, including in his witness statement, no mention of Mr. Shala is made.165 Nor is there any documentation to support Claimant's contention.166 Respondent also raises a temporal doubt about Claimant's contention because, while Mr. Pacolli represents that Mr. Shala approached him and Mr. Ejupi about their possible interest in investing in the Grand Hotel in early March 2006,167 UTC was not declared the winning bidder until 27 March 2006. At that time, the KTA had no reason to doubt UTC's ability to pay the purchase price. Above all, in his witness statement, Mr. Shala denies Mr. Pacolli's account, testifying that no such contacts were ever made.168\n\nResp. Reply on Jurisd., paras. 31-39.\n\nBehgjet Pacolli testimony, tr. 162:12 - 162:16; Resp. Reply on Jurisd., para. 217; Resp. oral argum., tr. 9:19 - 9:22, 11:9 - 11:19 (the sole documentation of ownership is UTC\u2019s).\n\nBehgjet Pacolli witness stmt, Exh. CWS-1, p. 2.\n\nShala testimony, tr. 66:11 - 66:18.\n\n260.\n\nMr. Shala testified that he met Mr. Pacolli for the first time in September or October 1999 at a conference in Switzerland on the future of Kosovo, where Mr. Pacolli proposed that Kosovo transfer all public assets to a foundation of which he would be chair, a proposal that Mr. Shala did not favor.169 Mr. Shala further testified that he could not possibly have allowed Claimant to become owner of the shares without following the Tender Rules. Given the public scrutiny of the privatization process, if he deviated from the Tender Rules he would be killed; he testified in fact to having received death threats.170\n\nShala testimony, tr. 85:11 - 85:14, 86:1 - 86:5.\n\nShala testimony, tr. 101:1 - 102:10.\n\n261.\n\nAccording to Mr. Shala, he and Mr. Pacolli met during a short conversation in Mr. Pacolli's office in Pristina in January 2019 and afterwards flew together to Rwanda on Mr. Pacolli's airplane, followed at a later time by a dinner at Mr. Pacolli's home and eventually a breakfast together in Berlin.171 The first time the subject of privatization of the Grand Hotel arose was afterwards, when Mr. Pacolli asked him to issue an invitation to him to invest in Kosovo, which Mr. Shala said he could not do.172\n\nShala testimony, tr. 66:23 - 66:25, 68:2 - 68:21.\n\nShala testimony, tr. 68:22 - 69:8. Mr. Shala testified that he did not know at the time that Mr. Berisha was unable to pay thepurchase price for the shares of the Grand Hotel. Shala testimony, tr. 95:22 - 96:16.\n\n262.\n\nMr. Shala testified that, some days before the hearing in this arbitration, he learned that Mr. Ejupi had approached Mr. Shala's son-in-law, who is also a cousin of Mr. Ejupi, asking him to set up a meeting with him. That individual made the request, which Mr. Shala then refused, deeming it inappropriate.173 Counsel for Respondent questioned Mr. Pacolli about a statement made by Mr. Shala, according to which Mr. Pacolli met with him in June 2019 and asked him to confirm in this proceeding that he invited Mr. Pacolli to co-invest in the Grand Hotel,174 an allegation that Mr. Pacolli flatly denied.175\n\nShala testimony, tr. 70:1 - 70:14, 71:24 - 72:2\n\nBehgjet Pacolli testimony, tr. 164:20 - 164:24.\n\nBehgjet Pacolli testimony, tr. 164:25, 165:17 - 165:20, 166:6 - 166:10.\n\n263.\n\nRespondent further contends that, even if an investment was made, it was made by Behgjet Pacolli in his personal capacity and not as Claimant's representative. It claims that the funds were transferred to Mr. Berisha from Mr. Pacolli's personal account.176 Moreover, over a six-year period, between 2006 and 2012, there was no mention of Claimant in any of the relevant correspondence. Then, when suit was brought against Mr. Berisha in 2007 in Municipal Court in Pristina,177 seeking recognition that Claimant was owner of 40% of the shares, and NTSH owner of 20%o of the shares, it was not brought in Claimant's name, but in Mr. Pacolli's.178 The relief sought in that suit was that Mr. Pacolli (not Claimant) and NTSH (not Mr. Ejupi) be recognized as shareholders,179 a fact that Mr. Pacolli attributed to a mistake.180 The first reference to Claimant was allegedly made only after the BIT came into force.181\n\nResp.

Counsel for Respondent observes that in the first of these letters, Mr. Pacolli's lawyer refers to the alleged shareholders as Behgjet Pacolli, on the one hand, and NTSH, on the other, suggesting that, while Mr. Ejupi was acting as representative of NTSH, Mr. Pacolli was acting in a personal capacity,184 a suggestion that Mr. Pacolli denies.185 Similarly, counsel for Respondent points out that in the 3 January 2012 letter, Selim Pacolli refers to Behgjet Pacolli as \"the owner of 40% of [the] shares.\"186 Further, in a letter of 29 February 2012, Behgjet Pacolli expressly stated that \"my companies have not been involved in the purchase of assets of Grand Hotel.\"187 Mr. Pacolli testified that Respondent has distorted the import of that language because all that was meant by that statement was the obvious fact that his companies never participated in the tendering process and that only UTC entered into the Purchase Agreement.

Pacolli, Berisha and Ejupi concluded an agreement prior to the 28 April 2006 transfer of funds; or that that transfer was made pursuant to that agreement.200\n\nResp.

According to Respondent (a) Exhibit C-4 does not establish that Behgjet Pacolli was ever acting in a representative capacity; (b) Exhibit C-30 only reports that statements were made to the police, not that they are true; (c) Exhibit CWS-1 refers only to Messrs.

Pacolli and the PAK in the first half of 2012. Respondent describes those discussions as pertaining, not to any pre-existing interest in the Grand Hotel such as Claimant asserts, but only to the possibility that it, along with NTSH, might become involved as new investors so as to avoid a withdrawal of shares and a retendering201 Respondent cites the witness statement of Mr. Shkelzen Lluka in support of this proposition, as well as the fact that the PAK was in touch in that period with several prospective investors.202\n\nResp.

Accordingly, the questions whether Mr. Pacolli acted in a representative capacity and to the extent to which he and his company enjoy distinct legal personalities are strictly governed by the law of Kosovo. Under that law, Mr. Pacolli did not act in a representative capacity and has a legal personality distinct from Claimant.203 Kosovo law also determines whether an investment was made and when ownership comes into being.204\n\nIn its Reply on Jurisdiction, paras. 228-231, Respondent cites the following legal provisions:  \n(a) Article 26 of the Law of Contracts and Torts No. 29/1978 of the Social Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Exh.

It maintains that, despite the appearance of his name alone on much of the correspondence and other documents, all actions that Mr. Pacolli took in connection with the purchase of the shares of the Grand Hotel and the PAK\u2019s withdrawal of them were taken in his capacity as representative of Mabco as part of the Mabetex Group.206 Mr. Pacolli testified that, because of his individual prominence in Kosovo, he typically uses his name when acting in the interest and on behalf of his companies, so that every transaction in which he engages within Claimant\u2019s business sector, even if bearing his name, is made on behalf of Claimant.207 He asserts that everyone knows that he does not carry on construction business as a natural person in his own name.208 Accordingly, Claimant maintains that the PAK knew perfectly well that it was Mr. Behgjet Pacolli\u2019s company that contributed the capital and that it was on the company\u2019s behalf that Mr. Behgjet Pacolli acted.209\n\nBehgjet Pacolli witness stmt, Exh.

Thus, when any one asks him - Mr. Ejupi - to invest, they are asking NTSH to invest.210 Indeed, according to Mr. Ejupi, the KTA itself contemplated that it would be companies, not individuals, that invested in privatized assets.211 Claimant\u2019s chief financial officer, witness Ms. Maesani-Gaiatto, also testified that when Mr. Pacolli uses the terms \"me\" or \"I\" in connection with his business dealings, including construction projects, he invariably has the relevant company in mind, and that it is not at all unusual for the sole owner of a company to identify himself or herself with his or her company.212 When Mr. Pacolli decides to make an investment, he selects the specific Mabetex company to make and conduct that investment.213 Starting in 2000, Claimant was the company that performed all the Group's important construction projects.214 In fact, Claimant was the most active company within the Mabetex Group of companies.215 According to Ms. Maesani-Gaiatto, since the term \"Mabetex\" has always been the Group name, and since it has become a useful \"brand,\" its name is commonly used in connection with the transactions in which its individual companies engage.216\n\nEjupi witness stmt, Exh.

However, it points out that its non-participation in the tender process by no means disqualifies its eventual ownership of shares as a protected asset under the BIT or Foreign Investment Law.217 It became a holder of shares in the Grand Hotel because it was specifically invited by the KTA to purchase part of the shares, paid close to half of the total purchase price of the shares in the Grand Hotel (as KTA knew), and entered into the AGU with UTC and NTSH to formalize the investment.218 (Claimant's reliance on the EUR 4m payment and the AGU are dealt with more fully in the sections that follow.) The reason that only UTC signed the Purchase Agreement is that UTC was officially the successful bidder.\n\nCl. oral argum., tr. 34:17 -34:24.\n\nCl.

According to Claimant, the privatization effort, launched toward the end of 2005, ran into difficulties due to the paucity of potential investors, even though the Grand Hotel was one of Kosovo\u2019s \"crown jewels.\"219 Faced with this problem, Mr. Shala invited Messrs. Pacolli and Abrashi to a meeting in Tirana, Albania, to discuss the privatization, urging them to submit bids.220 According to Mr. Ejupi, Mr. Shala asked him to seek to persuade Mr. Pacolli to co-invest and, in that context, assured Mr. Ejupi that, upon closure of the privatization procedure, the share ownership would be registered.221 Mr. Pacolli declined to participate.\n\nCl.

Makos won the bid, with UTC placing second. However in March 2006, Makos withdrew from the tendering process and UTC became the winning bidder.\n\nCl. Rejoinder on Jurisd., para. 61, citing Exh.

Mr. Ejupi testified that during the period in which Mr. Berisha had been required to pay the purchase price, Mr. Shala visited Mr. Ejupi in his office.223 At that meeting, Mr. Shala asked him to join the tender process, make the needed payment and assume the obligations set out in the Commitment Agreement but, knowing the difficulty of meeting a EUR 8m purchase price, again urged him to persuade Mr. Pacolli to participate as well. According to Mr. Ejupi, in that conversation, he received assurances from Mr. Shala that he would assist them in completing the required documentation.224 Mr. Pacolli ultimately agreed to participate. It is at that point, in early April 2006, that Messrs. Ejupi, Pacolli and Berisha had the meeting in Vienna described earlier (para. 166, *supra*) and an agreement to co- invest was reached.225 Claimant maintains that it is not at all unusual that no written report of that meeting was produced.\n\nEjupi testimony, tr. 108:19 - 108:21.\n\nEjupi testimony, tr. 109:1 - 109:16.\n\nBehgjet Pacolli 2d witness stmt, Exh.

Pacolli and Ejupi to accompany him to Croatia in an effort to attract other businesspeople to take part in the overall Kosovo privatization project. But while in Croatia, they learned that there had been a bomb threat at the Grand Hotel in Pristina, where Mr. Ejupi had established an office.226 According to Mr. Ejupi, Mr. Shala assured him that he need not worry about it.227 Mr. Ejupi referred in his testimony to there being a lot of pressure at that time from powerful parties in connection with the privatization, stating that upon their return from Croatia he learned that there was pressure for the Grand Hotel shares in particular to be acquired by persons whom Mr. Shala favored.228 Mr. Ejupi reports that he and Mr. Pacollli then began facing pressure to abandon ownership in the hotel, and that the KTA took action to impede efforts by Messrs. Pacolli and Ejupi to satisfy the KTA\u2019s documentation requirements.229 Mr. Ejupi eventually requested that the funds that had been transferred be returned and that the KTA allow whoever it wanted to become owner.230\n\nEjupi testimony, tr. 109:17 - 110:1.\n\nEjupi testimony, tr. 110:1 - 110:4.\n\nEjupi testimony, tr. 110:6 - 110:9.

Claimant argues that Mr. Pacolli omitted mention of Mr. Shala in that proceeding because he did not want to publicly accuse Mr. Shala of wrongdoing, which also explains why Mr. Shala was not mentioned in Mr. Pacolli\u2019s 29 February 2012 letter to the PAK. Even so, Claimant states that Mr. Ejupi had already by that time declared publicly that Mr. Shala was the person urging Mr. Ejupi to invest,231 so that it was no secret. Claimant observes that, Mr. Shala, who had taken the lead in the privatization effort during difficult times in Kosovo, would have had no choice but to approach them for help.232 Claimant also rejects as inconsequential the fact that Mr. Pacolli's witness statement says that Mr. Shala first contacted Mr. Ejupi who then contacted Mr. Pacolli, while Claimant's Counter-Memorial says that Mr. Shala contacted both Mr. Ejupi and Mr. Pacolli.\n\nExh.

Rejoinder on Jurisd., paras. 47-49, 57.\n\n281.\n\nAccording to Claimant, Respondent more generally misrepresents the litigation in the courts of Kosovo. Although the District Court reversed the Municipal Court's ruling that confirmed the co-ownership of the Grand Hotel shares, it did so not on the merits, but only for clarification, in light of an apparent inconsistency, of whether the litigant was Mr. Pacolli or the Mabetex Group. In its ruling, the court specifically acknowledged the existence of a power of attorney,233 but sought confirmation as to the issuer of the power of attorney and the party in favor of whom it was issued. According to Mr. Pacolli, he gave the power of attorney to counsel in the case as CEO of the Mabetex Group.234 As previously noted,235 on remand, the Municipal Court never decided the ownership question because by then the shares had been withdrawn.236 Claimant also observes that, notwithstanding the testimony of Mr. Lluka to the contrary,237 the KTA was necessarily aware of the litigation from the very beginning in mid-2007 and did not first learn of it, as testified to by Mr. Lluka, in March 2012. Asked why he and Mr. Pacolli brought suit in 2007 against UTC, and not the KTA, Mr. Ejupi explained that it was because the KTA refused to recognize them as investors.238 Mr. Pacolli explained that the reason why he, as CEO of Mabetex, rather than Claimant, initiated the proceedings was that Claimant was not registered in Kosovo.239\n\nCl.

Claimant suggests that the meeting was in fact held to consider whether to demand additional payments from Mr. Pacolli as bribes.241 In its view, the PAK withdrew the shares, not due to non-fulfillment of the investment commitments, but due to Mr. Pacolli\u2019s unwillingness to be bribed.\n\nResp. Reply on Jurisd., paras. 110 *et seq.* Respondent contends that the legality or illegality of the decision to withdraw the share is purely a merits, rather than jurisdictional, issue.

At that dinner, Mr. Shala mentioned that the prayer group was going next to Rwanda, and asked whether Mr. Pacolli would like to join them.243\n\nBehgjet Pacolli testimony, tr. 163:19 - 164:17, 166:25 - 167:4.\n\n285.\n\nMr. Ejupi was questioned about his efforts to communicate with Mr. Shala in the weeks preceding the hearing. Mr. Ejupi testified that the reason for that contact had nothing to do with the Grand Hotel. Rather, as president of a football club, he was trying to acquire land for that club, and knew that Mr. Shala had landholdings that might be available.244\n\nEjupi testimony, tr. 106:25 - 107:14.\n\n286.\n\nWhen asked why there was so little documentation of the communications among the KTA, Mr. Shala, on the one hand, and Messrs. Berisha, Pacolli and himself, on the other, Mr. Ejupi explained that here was very little communication by email in Kosovo at that time, and that parties communicated predominantly by telephone, as well as by meetings in person since distances in the city are minimal, relying fundamentally on trust and the word of honor in dealings among themselves.245 He reported disappointment in Mr. Shala in that regard.\n\nEjupi testimony, tr. 111:16 - 112:6, 112:17 - 112:21.\n\n287.\n\nMore generally, Claimant urges that the witness statements of Behgjet and Selim Pacolli not be discounted on account of their supposed self-interest. In Claimant's view, what matters is the tribunal's assessment of the relevance and credibility of their testimony.246 Claimant further questions Respondent's assertion that their witness testimony is unsupported by documentary evidence. Without conceding a lack of documentation, Claimant rejects the notion that witness testimony must be corroborated by documentary evidence.247\n\nCl. Rejoinder on Jurisd., para. 28.\n\nCl. Rejoinder on Jurisd., paras. 39-43.\n\n288.\n\nAs a matter of law, Claimant rejects Respondent's contention that Kosovo law determines whether an investment was made and when ownership came into being.248 More specifically, it is irrelevant whether, under Kosovo law, Mr. Pacolli's actions were or were not attributable to Claimant.249 According to Claimant, Mr. Pacolli's authority to represent Claimant is governed by Swiss law, and under that law he is authorized to do so.250 Claimant also disputes Respondent's interpretation of the Kosovo legislation governing the registration of shares and corporate charters.251\n\nResp. post-hearing br., paras. 38-40, citing, among other awards, Exh.

Pacolli and Shala.\n\n290.\n\nDuring that conferencing, Mr. Pacolli recalled Mr. Shala stating the following at their meeting in Tirana:\n\n*You have a luxury hotel. The hotels are in privatization now, Grand Hotel and Iliria Hotel. You have all the opportunity, because you have money, you have the hotel management, you have the experience, and I - we need investments, and I would ask you to invest in this sector.252*\n\nIn reply to this assertion, Mr. Shala stated that, while he met with Mr. Pacolli in 1999, he did not recall meeting with him at all in 2005, and that, in any event, he never requested that Mr. Pacolli invest in the Grand Hotel.253 If he were ever to make such a request, it would only be before the bidding process had begun.254 Mr. Shala stated that it is significant that Mr. Pacolli never followed up on the alleged meeting with any correspondence, and did not participate in the tender process.255 He described the tender process as \"100% bulletproof [from] manipulation.\"256\n\nBehgjet Pacolli testimony, tr. 178:16 - 178:22.\n\nShala testimony, tr. 179:3 - 179:9.\n\nShala testimony, tr. 180:13 - 180.18.\n\nShala testimony, tr. 180:19 - 181:6.\n\nShala testimony, tr. 183: 10.\n\n291.\n\nAt the witness conferencing, Mr. Pacolli asserted that present at the meeting in Tirana was also Gazmend Abrashi. According to Mr. Pacolli, Mr. Abrashi was the winner in the first round of bidding, but lacked both money and management experience, which is why Mr. Shala invited him to co-invest with Mr. Abrashi.257 Ultimately, Mr. Abrashi withdrew his bid though he proceeded with the other bid he had won, viz. the bid for another hotel, the Hotel Iliria. But to do so he needed a contribution by Mr. Pacolli of EUR 3.6m, which Mr. Pacolli made.258 Mr. Pacolli thereafter purchased Mr. Abrashi\u2019s share of the Hotel Iliria and became its sole owner.259\n\nBehgjet Pacolli testimony, tr. 186:22 - 187:9.\n\nBehgjet Pacolli testimony, tr. 187:21 - 188:13.\n\nBehgjet Pacolli testimony, tr. 190:6 - 190:16.\n\n(c) The Tribunal\u2019s Findings and Analysis\n----------------------------------------\n\n292.\n\nAs noted, Respondent makes the following contentions with respect to Claimant\u2019s alleged investment:\n\na. Claimant never held any assets relating to the Grand Hotel.\n\nb. Claimant\u2019s payment of EUR 4m does not constitute evidence of an investment on Claimant\u2019s part.\n\nc. Claimant did not become an owner of shares by virtue of the AGU.\n\nd. Claimant did not become an owner of shares by virtue of the Annex Agreement.\n\nRespondent\u2019s basic position is that Claimant made no investment within the meaning of the ICSID Convention, the BIT or the Foreign Investment Law, and that if any investment was made, it was made only by Mr. Behgjet Pacolli in his individual capacity and not on behalf of Claimant. In addressing the question whether Claimant made an investment, within the meaning of the BIT, Foreign Investment Law and the ICSID Convention, each of these instruments, due to their distinctive language, must be considered on its own terms.\n\na. Does a claim of entitlement to ownership of shares require proof of actual ownership?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n293.\n\nClaimant is not entirely clear or consistent as to the exact nature of the investment it claims to have acquired in respect of the Grand Hotel shares. On numerous occasions, it claims that it acquired ownership of the shares.260 Elsewhere, it suggests that it has a \"beneficial\" interest in the shares,261 though it does not elaborate on that assertion. Still elsewhere, it leaves its interest somewhat indeterminate. In sum, Claimant\u2019s characterization of its investment lacks the clarity or consistency one might expect.\n\nSee, e.g., RfA, para. 55; Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction paras. 112, 132; Rejoinder, para. 171.\n\nCl. post-hearing br., para. 16.\n\n294.\n\nIn this case, it is therefore less easy to identify the nature of the alleged investment than is usually the case in investor-State arbitration. However, it is uncontested that, while Claimant allegedly paid for the shares, it never received them and its ownership of them was never registered.262 Reading the record as a whole, and reconciling as best it can the not entirely consistent ways in which Claimant characterizes its putative investment, the Tribunal considers that Claimant is best understood as asserting that it acquired pursuant to its arrangements with UTC and NTSH and over the extended period of dealings with the KTA and thereafter the PAK, *a claim of entitlement to ownership of the shares,* and therefore a right to their registration in its name and protection from their withdrawal. An initial question before the Tribunal at this stage of the analysis is therefore whether that claim qualifies as an investment within the meaning of Article 25.1 of the ICSID Convention, Article 1(1) of the BIT and the relevant articles of the 2005 and 2014 Foreign Investment Laws. The Tribunal examines the status of the alleged investment under each of these instruments in turn.\n\nCl. oral argum., tr. 27:10-11.\n\n(i) The ICSID Convention\n------------------------\n\n295.\n\nJurisdiction over a dispute under Article 25.1 of the ICSID Convention requires that the dispute \"aris[es] directly out of an investment, between a Contracting State... and a national of another Contracting State, which the parties to the dispute consent in writing to submit to the Centre.\" The Convention does not however define the term \"investment.\" It does not therefore offer in itself a solid basis for determining whether or not a claim of entitlement to ownership of shares requires proof of actual ownership. To make that determination, one must look at arbitral jurisprudence on the definition of investment under the Convention.\n\n296.\n\nUnder one well-established line of arbitral case law, an asset does not qualify as an investment under the ICSID Convention unless, cumulatively, it represents a substantial capital contribution, entails a certain risk, and presents a certain duration. The award most closely associated with these criteria is *Salini Costruttori S.p.A & Italstrade S.p.A v. Kingdom of Morocco.*263 The *Salini* tribunal also posited a fourth criterion, viz., contribution to the economic development of the host State,264 but this criterion has, for various reasons, since fallen significantly out of favor.265 A common view is that contribution to the host State\u2019s economy is not part of the ordinary meaning of \"investment\" and is best viewed not as definitional of an investment, but as, at best, its desired consequence.266 The Tribunal is of that view.\n\nExh. CL-28: *Salini Costruttori S.p.A & Italstrade S.p.A v. Kingdom of Morocco,* ICSID Case No. ARB/00/4, Decision on Jurisdiction, 23 July 2001. See also Exh. RL-43 : Christoph Schreuer et al., *The ICSID Convention: A Commentary* (2d ed. 2009) 128-135, 668-671, p. 129. Among many awards applying the Salini criteria is Exh. CL-9: *LESI SpA et Astaldi SpA v. Algeria,* ICSID Case No. ARB/05/03, Decision of 12 July 2006, para. 72.\n\nOther tribunals have imposed a further additional requirement that an investment hold a promise of regular profit and return. The Tribunal sees little warrant for imposing this additional requirement. A contribution of capital to a business enterprise invariably implies an expectation of a regular profit and return. Dolzer & Schreuer describe regularity of profit as \"seldom considered relevant.\" Exh. RL-50: Rudolf Dolzer & Christoph Schreuer, *Principles of International Investment Law* (2d ed. 2012), p. 66.\n\nSee, e.g., Exh. CL-49: *Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9nerale v. Dominican Republic*, UNCITRAL, LCIA Case No. UN 7927, Award on Preliminary Objections to Jurisdiction, 19 September 2008; Exh. CL-29: *Mr.* *Saba Fakes v. Republic of Turkey,* ICSID Case No. ARB 07/20, Award, 14 July 2010; *Alpha Projektholding GmbH v. Ukraine,* ICSID Case No. ARB/07/16, Award, 8 November 2010.\n\nDolzer & Schreuer, *supra* note 264, at 66-74, citing *Fakes v. Turkey, supra* note 265, para. 110.\n\n297.\n\nThe *Salini* test has been criticized as unduly rigid, and has by no means been followed by all tribunals.267 However, since the *Salini* test is on the whole more demanding than the alternative approaches that have been followed, and the Tribunal, as will be seen (para. 300), considers that test to have been met, the Tribunal need not examine the case through the lens of those alternatives.\n\nSee, e.g., Exh. CL-46: *Biwater Gauff (Tanzania) Ltd. v. United Republic of Tanzania, ICSID Case No. ARB/05/22, Award, 24 July 2008, paras. 323 et seq.**;* Exh. CL-25 : *Malaysian Historical Salvors Sdn Bhdv. Malaysia,* ICSID Case No. ARB/05/10, Decision on Annulment, 16 April 2009.\n\n298.\n\nRespondent predicates its position on two basic assertions. First, having not acquired ownership of the shares and having no direct contract with either the KTA or the PAK, Claimant cannot maintain that it made an investment. Second, even if an investment was made, it would have been made by Mr. Pacolli in his personal capacity rather than on behalf of the Claimant - in other words, Claimant was not the investor. If Claimant was not the investor, then by definition it cannot satisfy the *Salini* test. It contributed no capital, incurred no risk, invested for no duration and made no contribution to Kosovo\u2019s economic development. The Tribunal must therefore decide whether an investment within the meaning of the ICSID Convention was made and, if so, whether it was Claimant that made it.\n\n299.\n\nTaking the second issue first, the Tribunal finds, for reasons explained in detail below (paras. 339-345, *infra*), that Mr. Pacolli took his actions on behalf of Mabco. For that reason, in the discussion that follows, the Tribunal will impute the investment, if one was made, to Claimant rather than Mr. Pacolli. It now turns to the *Salini* criteria, namely, whether there was a contribution of capital, whether that contribution entailed a risk, whether the putative investment had the requisite duration and, if required, whether it would contribute to the economic development of Kosovo.\n\n300.\n\nThe Tribunal leaves aside at this point the specific question of whether, as Respondent suggests (paras. 362-370, *infra*), any payment that was made was for the purchase of the shares in the Grand Hotel. That said, the Tribunal has no difficulty finding that, based on the Eur 4m payment, a contribution of capital was made. Turning to the question of risk, the Tribunal notes that, at the relevant time, Kosovo had virtually no tourism industry and development of a successful tourism industry could not be assumed. The purchase of shares in the Grand Hotel therefore necessarily entailed a risk. Nor is there any reason to suppose that Claimant\u2019s investment, if made, would not have sufficient duration. If Kosovo\u2019s tourism industry were to develop successfully, there is every reason to believe, based on the prominence of the Grand Hotel, that the investment would continue, entailing ongoing maintenance and management of the hotel.268 In sum, the Tribunal finds that all three criteria for which the Dissent (para. 21) cites the cases of *Clorox v. Venezuela* and *Saba Fakes v. Turkey* - contribution of capital, risk and duration - are met in this case.\n\nWhile considerable emphasis was placed in the proceedings on reconstruction and rehabilitation of the Grand Hotel, the arrangement among the co-owners also entailed management of the hotel going forward. Mr. Pacolli described his contribution as consisting of \"funds and... management.\" Behgjet Pacolli testimony, tr. 169:13 - 169:14. See also tr. 187:4: \"I had money, I had management.\"\n\n301.\n\nAs for contribution to the economic development of the host State, the Tribunal, as noted, joins those that have rejected it as a requirement. However, even were contribution to the economic development of a host State to be required, that requirement would appear to be met in the present case. Claimant and Respondent alike have subscribed to the view that promotion of tourism represents a prime component of Kosovo\u2019s economic development policy and that no single facility stood to contribute more importantly to that policy than the Grand Hotel in Kosovo\u2019s capital, Pristina.269 Accordingly, though in the Tribunal\u2019s view the ICSID Convention does not make protection of investment contingent on that investment making a contribution to the host State\u2019s economic development, any such requirement, were it to be imposed, would be satisfied.\n\nClaimant describes the Grand Hotel as a \"crownjewel.\" Cl. Rejoinder on Jurisd., para. 51.\n\n(ii) The BIT\n------------\n\n302.\n\nArticle 1(1) of the BIT defines an investment as \"every kind of asset established or acquired by an investor of one Contracting Party in the territory of the other Contracting Party that has such characteristics as the commitment of capital or other resources, the expectation of gain or profit, or the assumption of risk.\" Among others, such an asset may take the form of:\n\n*(a) movable and immovable property as well as any related rights, such as servitudes, mortgages, liens and pledges;*\n\n*(b) a company, or shares, parts or any other kind of participation in a company;*\n\n*(c) claims to money or to any performance having an economic value, except claims to money arising solely out of commercial contracts for the sale of goods and services;*... [and]\n\n*(e) rights conferred pursuant to law, contract or decision of an authority such as concessions, licences, authorizations and permits.*\n\n303.\n\nArticle 1(2) defines \"investor\" to include \"(b) a legal entity, including companies, corporations, business associations and other organisations, which are constituted or otherwise duly organised under the law of that Contracting Party and have their seat, together with real economic activities, in the territory of the same Contracting Party.\"\n\n304.\n\nArticle 11 of the BIT contemplates the arbitration of disputes \"between an investor of a Contracting Party and the other Contracting Party regarding an investment of the former made in the territory of the latter... based on an alleged breach of obligations under [the BIT].\"\n\n305.\n\nIt is well-established that an asset, within the meaning of a BIT, may consist of an intangible right, and that intangible rights are capable of being expropriated.270 The BIT in this case identifies several different intangibles as assets: \"a company, or shares, parts or any other kind of participation in a company;\" \"copyrights, industrial property rights... know-how and goodwill;\" and \"rights conferred pursuant to law, contract or decision of an authority such as concessions, licences, authorizations and permits.\"\n\nSee, e.g., *Mondev International Ltd. v. United States,* ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/99/2.\n\n306.\n\nAdmittedly, intangibles as covered investments typically take the form of contracts and the rights they confer.271 But, a claim need not be rooted in contract in order to be cognizable as an investment. As the language of BIT Article 1(1) itself shows, intangibles qualifying as assets take numerous forms. Nor are the intangibles identified in Article 1(1) themselves to be viewed as the only qualifying intangibles.272 There is no reason why, in logic or practice, intangibles taking other forms cannot be covered investments. The intangibles listed in the BIT do not constitute a \"closed set.\" In sum, the Tribunal is not prepared to exclude the possibility that a claim of entitlement cognizable in investor-State arbitration can arise other than by contract or other than in the form of the specific intangibles enumerated in Article 1(1).\n\nSee, e.g., Exh. RL-14: *Pantechniki, S.A. Contractors & Engineers v. the Republic of Albania,* ICSID Case No. ARB/07/21, Award, 30 July 2009. For a collection of awards treating claims, mostly under contract, as investments, see M. Somarajah, *The International Law on Foreign Investment,* 308-313 (3d ed. 2012).\n\nArticle 1(1) identified covered assets as \"including\" those enumerated.\n\n307.\n\nThe question therefore is whether the particular intangible that Claimant asserts - namely, a claim of entitlement to ownership of shares - may constitute a covered investment.\n\n308.\n\nAlthough the case law is sparse, the notion that non-contractual claims of entitlement may constitute investments is clearly supported in the literature. Rudolf Dolzer & Christoph Schreuer identify as common forms of investment, not only \"rights conferred by contracts,\" but also \"rights granted by the general laws,\"273 and in the present case Mabco precisely bases its claim on its right to registration of shares under the law of Kosovo. According to Zachary Douglas, a claim to money can qualify as an investment provided that it \"entail[s] a \u2018transfer of resources into the economy of the host state by the claimant entailing the assumption of risk in expectation of a commercial return.\u2019\"274 As already found, the investment claimed by Mabco satisfies these criteria: it entails a transfer of resources into the economy of Kosovo with the attendant risk to which Douglas refers. The Tribunal is accordingly not prepared to exclude fully the possibility that a claim of entitlement to ownership of shares under certain circumstances is cognizable as a qualifying investment.275\n\nDolzer & Schreuer, *supra* note 264, p. 64.\n\nZachary Douglas, *The International Law of Investment Claims* (CUP, 2009), p. 185, para. 388, quoting *PSEG v. Turkey,* Decision on Jurisdiction, 11 ICSID Reports 434 (4 June 2004) (Exh. CL-5). Douglas cites the Germany Model BIT which treats as a form of investment \"claims to money which has been used to create an economic value or claims to any performance having an economic value.\"\n\nIt is also somewhat troubling that a claim alleging a failure to register purchased shares can be defeated on the ground that, precisely because the shares were unregistered, a claim of entitlement to their ownership cannot constitute an investment.\n\n309.\n\nIn fact, Article 1(1)(c) of the BIT identifies a specific category of intangibles into which the asset Claimant invokes in this case comfortably falls. Claimant is literally asserting a \"claim[] to [a] performance having an economic value.\" within the meaning of BIT Article 1(1)(c). It not only claims an entitlement to ownership; it claims a *performance,* viz. registration in its name of the shares it allegedly purchased. The Tribunal finds that this constitutes a *claim to a performance having an economic value,* under Article 1(1)(c). Significantly, the category of claims that Article 1(1)(c) specifically excludes from coverage is \"claims to money arising solely out of *commercial contracts for the sale of goods and services\"* (emphasis added). Mabco\u2019s claim in this case is by no means reducible to a claim based solely on a mere \"sale of goods and services.\"\n\n310.\n\nIt is useful, in assessing Mabco\u2019s claim of having made a qualifying investment, to compare the present case with a variation on it. Imagine that Claimant, under otherwise identical circumstances, *had* participated in the tender process, *had* made the winning bid and, let us say, *had* made payment in full for the shares. Imagine further that the KTA or PAK nevertheless refused to register the shares in Claimant\u2019s name. Under that hypothesis, just as in the present case, Claimant would not receive the shares and would not be officially recorded as their owner. If Claimant then initiated arbitration, it would best describe its asset precisely as *a claim of entitlement to ownership of the shares,* and this Tribunal would have little hesitation in treating that claim as a qualifying investment. The Tribunal does not see any warrant in treating the present case any differently.\n\n311.\n\nIn sum, the Tribunal concludes that, depending on the circumstances, a claim of entitlement to an asset is itself capable of constituting an investment under the BIT, provided that, as the Dissent rightly says (para. 18), it was \"established or acquired.\" In the Tribunal\u2019s view, Mabco\u2019s claim of entitlement was both established and acquired.\n\n312.\n\nAt the same time, *a claim of entitlement,* such as that advanced by Claimant, does not of course in itself amount to *an entitlement*, any more than that an assertion of contractual rights amounts to actual contractual rights. Whether Claimant actually has that entitlement remains to be seen.\n\n(iii) The Foreign Investment Law\n--------------------------------\n\n313.\n\nGiven the fact that both the 2005 and 2014 Foreign Investment Law have application in part to this case, the Tribunal examines them both.\n\n314.\n\nUnder Article 2(1) of the 2005 Foreign Investment Law, an \"investment dispute\" is \"any dispute between a foreign investor and a public authority relating (i) to an investment in Kosovo made by such foreign investor.\" Article 2(1) specifies that an \"investment dispute\" includes, among other things, disputes relating to:\n\n*c. the making or attempt to make an investment in Kosovo.*\n\n315.\n\nAn \"investment\" is defined in part under Article 2(1) the 2005 Foreign Investment Law as any asset that has \"been contributed to a Kosovo business organization in return for an ownership interest in that business organization.\" Assets in turn are defined in part as:\n\n*a. movable and immovable property, including rights in and to such property such as a mortgage, lien, pledge, lease or servitude;*\n\n*b. intangible and intellectual property, including rights in and to such property, as well as goodwill, technical processes and know how;*\n\n*c. cash, securities, commercial paper, guarantees, shares of stock or other types of ownership interests in a Kosovo or foreign business organization; bonds, debentures, other debt instruments;*\n\n*d. claims or rights to money, goods, services, and performance under contract;* [and]\n\n*e. concessions or licenses conferred by law, administrative action, or contract;...*\n\n316.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, Mabco's claim of entitlement in the case falls comfortably within Article 2(1) of the 2005 Foreign Investment Law. This enumeration establishes that, like the BIT, the Foreign Investment Law specifically contemplates intangibles as assets amenable to treatment as investments. Moreover, Article 2(1) specifically identifies, \"claims... to... performance\" as among the assets capable of constituting an investment. While Article 2(1) specifically refers to \"claims... to... performance under contract,\" the Tribunal, for reasons set out above in connection with the BIT, is not prepared to exclude from coverage claims to performance on legal grounds other than contract *stricto sensu.*\n\n317.\n\nThe Tribunal refers back to its discussion, in connection with the BIT, of the support in the literature for the proposition that investments may take the form, not only of contract rights, but more generally of rights granted under national law,276 and may entail \"a \u2018transfer of resources into the economy of the host state by the claimant entailing the assumption of risk in expectation of a commercial return.'\"277 As earlier observed, the investment claimed by Mabco may fairly be characterized as a claim of right under law as well as a transfer of resources into the economy of Kosovo with the attendant risk to which Douglas refers. As noted, Article 2(1) also defines an \"investment dispute\" to include a dispute relating to \"c. the making or *attempt* to make an investment in Kosovo\" (emphasis added).\n\n*Supra,* para. 308.\n\n*Supra,* para. 308.\n\n318.\n\nThe Tribunal accordingly considers a claim of entitlement to ownership of shares to be cognizable as a qualifying investment, although once again that entitlement must eventually be established as a merits matter.\n\n319.\n\nMuch the same analysis applies to the definition of an investment under Article 2.1.4 of the 2014 Foreign Investment Law, which defines an \"investment\" to include, among other things:\n\n*1.4.3. cash, securities, commercial paper, guarantees, shares of stock or other types of ownership interests in... the Republic of Kosovo or foreign business organization; bonds, debentures, other debt instruments;*\n\n*1.4.4. claims or rights to money, goods, services, and performance under contract...*\n\n320.\n\nArticle 2.1.4.4 repeats verbatim Article 2(1)(d) of the 2005 Law *(\"claims or rights to money, goods, services, and performance under contract\"),* which the Tribunal found to be capable of encompassing Mabco\u2019s claim of entitlement to shares in this case.278\n\n*Supra,* para. 317.\n\n321.\n\nThe Tribunal thus finds that, depending of course on the circumstances, a claim of entitlement to an asset is itself capable of constituting an investment. To borrow Zachary Douglas\u2019 phrase, it \"entail[s] a \u2018transfer of resources into the economy of the host state by the claimant entailing the assumption of risk in expectation of a commercial return.\u2019\"\n\nb. Has Claimant adduced sufficient evidence of its entitlement to ownership of the Grand Hotel shares for it to constitute a claim of entitlement worthy of protection under the BIT and/or Foreign Investment Law?\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n322.\n\nAssuming an asset in the form of a claim of entitlement can under some circumstances constitute an investment, as the Tribunal has found, the question then arises whether Claimant, under the circumstances of this case, has established such a *claim*. It bears repeating that it is not necessary that Claimant at this stage establish that it actually has an *entitlement* to the Grand Hotel shares. That remains an open question. At the same time, it certainly cannot suffice at the jurisdictional stage, for purposes of demonstrating a claim of entitlement, merely to articulate such a claim. In the Tribunal\u2019s view, any such claim must be a colourable one, i.e., must be at the very least arguable. In the Tribunal\u2019s view, what may be demanded at this stage is what may be called a *prima facie* showing, by which is meant a showing sufficient to find the asserted claim sufficiently plausible. That apparently is Respondent\u2019s view as well.279\n\nResp. oral argum., tr. 24:18-21:  \n*Setting out a prima facie case on the merits is one of the conditions to establishing the jurisdiction of an ICSID tribunal. In other words, the Claimant must formulate its claims in a plausible manner.*\n\n323.\n\nThe Tribunal finds that, by this standard, Claimant has made the necessary showing Claimant\u2019s argumentation is admittedly less than linear. Neither the KTA nor the PAK entered into any formal agreement with Claimant for its acquisition of the shares, and so Claimant\u2019s entitlement cannot be predicated on any agreement with Respondent or its agencies. Rather, in order to make a *prima facie* judgment on this score, the Tribunal in this case must piece together words and conduct - in a word, circumstances - taking place over a significant period of time, running between 2005/2006 and 2012 so as to produce a reasonable claim of entitlement.\n\n324.\n\nClaimant relies heavily on the proposition that Mr. Shala, upon finding that UTC, the winning bidder, could not pay the required price, expressly invited Claimant to participate in UTC\u2019s acquisition of ownership of the shares.280 Mr. Ejupi testified that Mr. Shala approached him twice in 2006 (once at the outset of the bidding process and later upon Mr. Berisha\u2019s failure to pay the share purchase price), specifically urging him to recruit Mr. Pacolli as co-purchaser of Grand Hotel shares.281 Even so, the Tribunal has difficulty lending substantial credence to this assertion. Not only is there no documentary evidence in the record of any such agreement, which one would normally expect, but Mr. Pacolli\u2019s forceful assertion to this effect was met by Mr. Shala's equally forceful denial.282 In an effort to arrive at a finding on this point, the Tribunal conducted a witness conferencing in which Messrs. Pacolli and Shala were jointly examined and directly confronted one another.283 The Tribunal found that exercise to be inconclusive.284 In any event, even if the issuance of such an invitation could be established, it alone would not suffice to create a colourable claim to entitlement to the Grand Hotel shares. A mere invitation to bid, whether via a tender offer or otherwise, signifies little more than the inviting party's willingness to contemplate the possibility of an acquisition by the invitee.\n\nEjupi testimony, tr. 108:19 - 108:21; Ejupi testimony, tr. 109:1 - 109:16; Ejupi witness stmt, para. 11.\n\nEjupi witness stmt, Exh. CWS-4, paras. 10-11.\n\nShala testimony, tr. 66:11 - 66:18.\n\nTr. 176-194.\n\nAt the witness conferencing (tr. 177:6 - 117:12), the Tribunal heard the following:  \n*MR. FERRARO:My first question is: have you two ever met to discuss the opportunity of investment in the GrandHotel in Pristina?*  \n*A. (Mr. Shala) No. No, sir.*  \n*A. (Mr. Pacolli) Yes, sir.*\n\n325.\n\nMoreover, the Purchase Agreement for privatization of the Grand Hotel was concluded between UTC and the KTA, not between Claimant and the KTA. Additionally, the Purchase Agreement required UTC to declare that it was \"purchasing the Shares for its own use and not as an agent for a third party and [that], during the tender for this Company, the Buyer has not formed any informal or formal undisclosed agreements or consortiums between two or more bidders or with any undisclosed third party.\"285\n\nExh. C-15: Purchase Agreement, Art. 5.1.3.\n\n326.\n\nThese circumstances weaken Claimant's assertion of a claim of entitlement to registration of the shares. However, other circumstances of the case, viewed in their totality, point in an opposite direction.\n\n327.\n\nMost basic is the fact of Claimant's transfer via NTSH and UTC to the KTA of the sum of Eur 4m for the hotel shares. UTC, which had won the bid for the Grand Hotel but lacked the resources necessary to pay the contract price, engaged Messrs. Pacolli and Ejupi of NTSH in discussions with a view to their participation in the acquisition of the shares. The parties reached an agreement at a meeting in Vienna in early April 2006 devoted to the purchase of the Grand Hotel shares, specifically on the understanding that Claimant and NTSH would contribute Eur 4m and Eur 1m, respectively, for that purpose, that Mr. Berisha would manage the project for a period of two years, at which point Claimant and NTSH would become legal owners of the shares, and that Mr. Pacolli, would make all investments required to meet the owners\u2019 commitments under the Purchase Agreement.286 Claimant gave KTA a guarantee of payment of the Eur 20.2m that the KTA required prior to signing the Purchase Agreement with UTC in August 2006,287 and in January 2007 the AGU formalized that undertaking.288\n\nCl. Rejoinder on Jurisd., paras. 60, 67.\n\nExh. C-66: Letter from Behgjet Pacolli to Raiffeisen Bank, 3 August 2006. See Cl. Rejoinder on Jurisd., paras. 45, 119-120, 199; Cl. oral argum., tr. 32:10-12.\n\nExh. C-17: AGU; Behgjet Pacolli witness stmt, Exh. CWS-1, para. 10.\n\n328.\n\nClearly, the KTA was not a party to the AGU and is not bound by it. However, the existence and terms of the AGU do adequately establish the purposes of the transfer of Eur 4m to the KTA (via UTC). Respondent calls attention to the fact, as discussed more fully below (para. 348, *infra*), that the Eur 4m transfer was made prior to the meeting in Vienna and conclusion of the AGU. But it is not unreasonable to suppose that that transfer was made in anticipation of a formal agreement among UTC, NTSH and Mabco to be made thereafter.\n\n329.\n\nThe question whether and to what extent this transfer in particular supports Mabco\u2019s claim of entitlement to share ownership in the Grand Hotel is discussed in greater detail in the following section. As will be seen there (paras. 362-370, *infra*), the Tribunal finds that the transfer was made by Mabco for purposes of acquiring the Grand Hotel shares.\n\n330.\n\nThere is no documentary evidence specifically establishing that, as Claimant maintains, the KTA or PAK was aware at an early point in time of the transfer of moneys by Claimant and the reasons for it,289 and there are inconsistent assertions as to when the KTA or PAK learned of the AGU in particular.290 Respondent maintains that the KTA and PAK were unaware that Claimant had invested Eur 4m in the Grand Hotel prior to 2012,291 and Mr. Lluka testified in support of that contention.292 However, there are circumstances suggesting otherwise. First, when Claimant\u2019s first attempt to pay the EUR 4m failed, and NTSH was required to return the funds to Mabco, the letter from the Kosovo Central Bank (BPK) to Mabco reporting that its initial transfer of funds was unsuccessful was copied to the KTA.293 As far as the Tribunal can tell, the KTA did not express any question or concern about the fact that the funds were being paid by a party other than the winning bidder, much less give any other indication that it thought the payment was irregular or ineffective.\n\nCl. oral argum., tr. 36:9 - 37:4, 42:4 - 42:12.\n\nMr. Pacolli testified that the KTA had early knowledge of the AGU (Behgjet Pacolli witness stmt, Exh. CWS-1, para. 10; Behgjet Pacolli 2d witness stmt, Exh. CWS-3, para. 10).\n\nResp. oral argum., tr. 49:7- 49:11.\n\nLluka witness stmt, paras. 10-12.\n\nSee para. 331, *supra.*\n\n331.\n\nAdditionally, Claimant brought suit against UTC in the Municipal Court of Pristina in June 2007 and that court\u2019s judgment in Claimant\u2019s favour was the subject of appeal by UTC and ultimately reversed on 28 May 2010. (Notably, the appeals court did not make a ruling on the merits of Mabco\u2019s claim. Rather, it remanded the case to the Municipal Court for a determination of whether the Claimant or Mr. Pacolli had standing to sue. The Municipal Court never made that determination because the case had been overtaken by events.) It is improbable that the KTA was ignorant of that litigation or the identity of the parties to it.\n\n332.\n\nIt is not possible on the record to determine exactly when Claimant\u2019s purchase of the shares became known to the KTA or PAK. But the circumstances, taken together, suggest that the KTA and PAK likely had knowledge of the transfer by 2007 or 2008. According to the record, only in October 2011, when Selim Pacolli, upon hearing that the PAK was considering withdrawing the shares, contacted the PAK urging it not to do so, did the PAK deny that Claimant had any ownership interest in the shares.294\n\nExh. C-22: Letter of Mabco to PAK, 21 October 2011.\n\n333.\n\nOver a period of several months early in 2012, years after receiving Claimant\u2019s Eur 4m contribution, the PAK had communications and held meetings with Mr. Pacolli, in which it advised him that once he produced certain specific documents, the shares would be officially registered under Claimant's name.295 It is uncontested that Mr. Pacolli provided all the requested documentation.296\n\nExhs. C-24/C-38: Letter from the PAK to Selim Pacolli representing Mabco, 19 March 2012; Cl. Rejoinder on Jurisd., para. 6.\n\nSee Exh. C-39: Performance Guarantee and Exh. R-32: Letter from UTC, Mabetex Project Engineering and NTSH to PAK, 28 March 2012.\n\n334.\n\nClaimant did of course have a contractual relationship with UTC and, on that basis, a cause of action against UTC. Indeed that was the basis for Mr. Pacolli's litigation against UTC in the Kosovo courts.297 On the other hand, it had no contractual relationship with the KTA or PAK, and no basis for asserting a contract claim against them. When Claimant did bring suit against the PAK, in the SCSC and later in the Constitutional Court, it did not argue that PAK had a contractual obligation to register the shares, but rather effectively an obligation in law. However, neither the existence of a contract claim against UTC nor the absence of a contract claim against either the KTA or the PAK negates the existence of a non-contractual claim against the PAK. Nor can the present dispute fairly be described as purely \"private\" relationship to which the KTA and PAK were mere bystanders, and therefore not cognizable under a BIT or foreign investment law. Although the agreement among UTC, NTSH and Claimant is central to the present dispute, no less central is Claimant's relationship with the public authorities of Kosovo, if only because only the KTA and thereafter the PAK had the public authority to take the actions that lie at the heart of this dispute, namely, authority to register shares that had been purchased and authority to withdraw shares in a company to which, through privatization, the State had transferred public property.\n\nExh. R-29: Judgment of the Municipal Court of Prishtina in proceeding between Pacolli and NTSH v. Berisha/UTC, 28 May 2009, reversed, Exh. R-31 : Judgment of the District Court of Prishtina in proceeding between Pacolli and NTSH v. Berisha/UTC, 13 April 2010.\n\n335.\n\nIt is not accurate to portray this case as one in which Claimant merely \"sought\" or \"attempted\" to make an investment.298 In the Tribunal's view, this is not an apt way of characterizing Claimant's position in this case. As will be developed more fully below, Claimant actually purchased the shares in question, the KTA became aware of that fact and eventually stated on several occasions stated that only certain documents, which Claimant promptly supplied, were required in order for the shares to be registered in Claimant\u2019s name. (According to the allegations, the only thing that stood between that undertaking on the PAK\u2019s part and formal registration of the shares was Claimant\u2019s refusal, on several occasions, to pay a bribe.) Claimant did a great deal more than \"attempt\" to make an investment.\n\nAccording to Counsel for Respondent, \"Mr. Pacolli, as an individual, *tried to obtain shares* in the company Grand Hotel LLC. But this does not make the Claimant... an investor in this company\" (emphasis added). Tr. 19:22-25.\n\n336.\n\nNor does the Tribunal\u2019s finding of an investment in the present case by any means signify that every trans-border capital movement suffices to qualify as an investment. The Tribunal agrees with Counsel for Respondent in oral argument that \"an investment is not just a transfer of money,\"299 but rather \"an asset acquired by the investor as a result of [a] contribution.\"300 However, this case cannot be reduced to a mere \"transfer of money\" or characterized as \"any claim to obtain whatever has been contractually stipulated,\" as the Dissent suggests (paras. 20, 29). This was no \"garden-variety\" contract, much less the paradigmatic \"one-off\u2019 sale transaction that all would agree cannot qualify as an investment.301 The relationship between Claimant, on the one hand, and KTA and PAK, on the other, represented vastly more than that. What resulted from the relationships in this case was nothing less than a joint venture entailing all the characteristics of an investment: a contribution of capital in contemplation of gain or profit, an assumption of risk, a significant duration and even, if necessary, a contribution to the economic development of Kosovo. The Tribunal thus cannot agree with the Dissent\u2019s suggestion (para. 41) that finding as we do \"render[s] the distinction between a contract obligation and an investment largely meaningless.\"\n\nResp. oral argum., 19:4.\n\nResp. oral argum., 19:5-6.\n\nResp. Mem. on Jurisd., para. 125.\n\n337.\n\nIn sum, the Tribunal finds that, solely for the purpose of establishing jurisdiction on a *prima facie* basis, and without prejudice to any decision on the merits, there is a colourable basis for Mabco\u2019s contention that it had a claim of entitlement against Respondent for registration of the shares in its name and for reversal of the order of withdrawal of the shares, and that claim, under the circumstances of this case, may be regarded as an investment.\n\nc. Assuming a claim of entitlement in this case is sufficiently established, is it a claim that can be asserted by Claimant?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n338.\n\nIn the preceding discussion, the Tribunal has, for simplicity, repeatedly referred to a claim of entitlement to shares on Claimant\u2019s part. But of course Respondent forcefully argues (paras. 293-338, *supra*) that it is not Claimant that engaged with the KTA and PAK, on the one hand, and with UTC and NTSH, on the other, with a view to ownership of the Grand Hotel shares, but rather Mr. Pacolli in his individual capacity - with the result that any investment that could possibly have been made would have been made by Mr. Pacolli personally and not by Claimant.302\n\nResp. Reply on Jurisd., para. 274; Resp. oral argum., tr. 20:20 - 20:23; Resp. post-hearing br., para. 16.\n\n339.\n\nThe Tribunal of course agrees that in order to establish jurisdiction, it must find that, in taking his actions, Mr. Pacolli acted on behalf of Claimant. On this, the record is spotty. In the great majority of the documents and communications relative to Mr. Pacolli\u2019s engagement either with the KTA or PAK, on the one hand, and with Messrs. Berisha and Ejupi, on the other, Mr Pacolli signed and otherwise referred to himself in his own name. That regularity has naturally created some doubt in the Tribunal\u2019s thinking that he was acting on these occasions in the name of Mabco.\n\n340.\n\nThat said, the Tribunal cannot ultimately conclude that, when Mr. Pacolli took the steps he did, he did so on his own account. First, it is not the case that Mr. Pacolli invariably, over the relevant period of time, wrote no correspondence and entered into no agreement in the name of Claimant. In the lawsuit brought against UTC in 5 June 2007,303 the plaintiff was identified as \"Behgjet Pacolli from Prishtina, president of c.e.o MABETEX GROUP.\" Another example is the letter of guarantee - dated 3 August 2008 - sent by Mr. Pacolli to UTC\u2019s bank (which expressly refers to the Grand Hotel acquisition and mentions Mabco, among other companies of Mabetex group).304 The 28 March 2012 letter to PAK305 was signed by Mr. Selim Pacolli on behalf of Mabetex. Further, when Selim Pacolli signed the Annex Agreement, dated 28 March 2012,306 he identified himself as \"representing Mr. Behxhet Pacolli, acting on behalf of the company \u2018MABETEX\u2019 and in his personal name.\" For reasons given below (paras. 382-383, *infra*), the Tribunal does not, as Respondent urges,307 find the reference to Mabetex, rather than Mabco, disqualifying. Mabetex was nothing more than a group of separate companies, among them Mabco, and among those companies, Mabco was apparently the one that would have been charged with a project such as the project in the present case.308 Thus, for all practical purposes, any reference to Mabetex in the context of the present dispute signified a reference to Mabco. Indeed, if, as Respondent suggests, Mr. Pacolli was at all times acting solely for himself, there would be no reason to reference Mabetex at all.309\n\nExh. R-30: Judgment of the Municipal Court ofPrishtina in proceeding between Pacolli and NTSH v. Berisha/UTC.\n\nExh. C-66 states that the cost of the project would be covered solely by Mr. Pacolli and his group of companies, and that \"[t]here areno other shareholders and especially not [UTC] involved in the cost of this project.\" (Letter from Behgjet Pacolli to Raiffeisen Bank, 3 August 2006)\n\nExh. R-32: Letter from UTC, Mabetex Project Engineering and NTSH to PAK dated 28 March 2012, 28 March 2012.\n\nExh. C-20: Annex Agreement, 28 March 2012.\n\nResp. Mem. on Jurisd., para. 100.\n\nMabco\u2019s Chief Financial Officer, Lucina Maesani-Gaiatto, testified that \"all the prestigious construction projects were conducted since 2000 by Mabco.\" Maesani-Gaiatto witness stmt, para. 8.\n\nThe Tribunal also notes that, with limited exceptions, Messrs. Berisha, Ejupi and Pacolli also used their own names. The Annex Agreement, dated 28 March 2012, was signed by Mr. Berisha as representative of UTC, Ms. Ejupi as representative of NTSH and Mr. Selim Pacolli as representative of Mr. Behgjet Pacolli and Mabetex. Also, the AGU refers to UTC as the \"[l]egal purchaser of \u2018Grand\u2019..., with the seat in Hani I Elezit, with the sole owner Mr. Zelqif Berisha.\" Exh. C-17: AGU, Sec. II. There is no suggestion that they too made their investmentson their own account.\n\n341.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees that only starting in June 2012, after the BIT had come into force, did the correspondence plainly come in Mabco\u2019s name as such. Notably, in the 20 June 2012 letter to PAK,310 Mr. Pacolli is referred to as \"a legal representative of MABETEX GROUP \u2014 working unit MABCO CONSTRUCTION S.A. headquartered in Lugano, Switzerland.\" Respondent suggests, and the Dissent agrees (para. 52), that this was done in order to make what was Mr. Pacolli\u2019s investment appear to be Mabco\u2019s investment so as to take advantage of the BIT which had only just entered into force. The Tribunal agrees that that is no coincidence. But it is not a suspicious one. The 20 June communication appears to be the very first correspondence with the KTA or PAK that came from counsel for Claimant, rather than Mr. Pacolli individually. According to Claimant, Mr. Pacolli engaged counsel at that point in time because the PAK had then just announced its decision to execute withdrawal of the shares.311 It should come as no surprise that counsel appreciated, far better than Mr. Pacolli in the past had, that in order for the action to be maintained, the claim had to be presented in Claimant's name. Therefore, in the Tribunal's view, it does not follow from the appearance of a reference to Mabco on 20 June 2012 that the claim was not Mabco's claim before that date and that it became Mabco's claim only then. The Tribunal cannot conclude that, in that correspondence, Mr. Pacolli and counsel were suddenly \"converting\" a claim belonging at all times to Mr. Pacolli into a claim belonging to Mabco.\n\nExh. C-40: Letter from Mabco to PAK, 20 June 2012.\n\nCl. Rejoinder on Jurisd., para. 7.\n\n342.\n\nThe only testimony presented on whether Mr. Pacolli was acting on his own or in a representative capacity, supports the Tribunal's conclusion. Mr. Ejupi testified more generally, but unequivocally, that the consistent practice in Kosovo was precisely for individuals to use their own names in representing their companies, particularly individuals, like Mr. Pacolli, of especially high prominence.312 Mr. Ejupi was not cross-examined on this matter, nor did Respondent adduce any evidence challenging Mr, Ejupi's account of the practice in Kosovo. Similarly, Mabco's Chief Financial Officer, Lucina Maesani-Gaiatto, testified that, as an objective matter, business was conducted in that way in Kosovo, as a result of which, when Mr. Pacolli negotiated and signed agreements, he was understood as doing so on behalf of the relevant entity within the Mabetex group, which in the construction and engineering sector would have been Mabco.313 Again, though it would have been possible, through witness testimony, to challenge Ms. Maesani-Gaiatto's account of business practices in Kosovo, no effort to challenge her testimony was made. While the Dissent disagrees (paras. 43, 47), the Tribunal finds that, if in fact the practice in Kosovo was for businesspersons to use their own name when speaking for the business entities they own and control - and all the testimony in this case supports that understanding - that practice cannot and should not be ignored. This is not altered by the fact that Mr. Pacolli was \"experienced.\"\n\nEjupi witness stmt, Exh. CWS-4, para. 12.\n\nMaesani-Gaiatto witness stmt, Exh. CWS-5, paras. 8-10.\n\n343.\n\nBut there are more direct indications that, in the underlying transactions, Mr. Pacolli was representing Mabco and not himself as an individual. Of none of these is there any dispute. First, the Eur 4m transfer was made out of Mabco\u2019s own bank account.314 Second, it was reflected on Mabco\u2019s balance sheets and confirmed by Mabco\u2019s external auditor.315 Third, the decision to invest in Kosovo a significant amount of monies was brought before and voted upon by Mabco\u2019s shareholders, which adopted a resolution to that effect.316\n\nExh.

C-61: Mabco\u2019s account statements dated 31 December 2006.\n\nBehgjet Pa colli testimony, tr. 175:11-21.\n\n344.\n\nThe Tribunal concludes that, notwithstanding Mr. Pacolli\u2019s having very often used his own name rather than Mabco\u2019s, the investment was in fact Mabco\u2019s.\n\n**(2)** ***Claimant's payment of EUR 4m does not constitute evidence of aninvestment on Claimant's part***\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n(a) Respondent\u2019s Position\n-------------------------\n\n345.\n\nRespondent contends that no link has been established between Claimant\u2019s payment of EUR 4m and its alleged investment in the Grand Hotel. It finds no reference, in connection with the transfer, to the Grand Hotel privatization. Additionally, in the domestic court proceeding referred to earlier (para. 218, *supra*,), Mr. Pacolli mentions that he made the payment but makes no mention of Claimant in that connection.317\n\nResp. Mem. on Jurisd. paras. 49, 75-81, 98.\n\n346.\n\nIn that proceeding, evidence was introduced of a transfer dated 27 April 2006 of EUR 4m from Kosovo Airlines, not Claimant, to NTSH in connection with the privatization process, for which no explanation was given. Respondent also asks why no evidence of a 28 April 2006 transfer was introduced in the Kosovo court actions.318 Respondent concludes that payments to the KTA for the shares were made only by UTC and NTSH, and not by Claimant. Respondent also speculates that the EUR 4m transfer may have been made in connection with a transaction having nothing to do with the Grand Hotel. It notes that, at the time of the Grand Hotel privatization, the KTA was conducting a tender process for privatization of Hotel Iliria, in which Behgjet and Selim Pacolli participated, as did Ms. Ejupi on behalf of NTSH.319\n\nResp. Reply on Jurisd., paras. 25-28.\n\nResp. Reply on Jurisd. paras. 270-272.\n\n347.\n\nRespondent also raises a question of timing. The EUR 4m payment was made in April 2006, but the AGU was only concluded in January 2007, i.e. 8 months later. Indeed, the Purchase Agreement between UTC and the KTA, dated 10 August 2006, was not yet even concluded.320 Thus, the payment could not have had investment in the Grand Hotel as its object. Moreover, the deadline set by the KTA for payment of the purchase price by UTC and the date when that payment was made was 24 April 2006, a date that had already passed by the time of the alleged 28 April 2006 transfer.321 Furthermore, in a letter of 29 February 2012,322 Mr. Pacolli stated that he met Mr. Berisha for the first time in Vienna in the summer of 2006. That means that investment in the Grand Hotel cannot have been the purpose of the 28 April 2006 transfer of funds on which Claimant relies as evidencing its investment.323\n\nResp. Mem. on Jurisd., paras. 95-97. Respondent regards it as remarkable that Mr. Pacolli would allow so many months to elapse between payment and the agreement in connection with which it was made. Resp.

Reply on Jurisd., para. 16.\n\n348.\n\nRespondent observes a number of other peculiarities surrounding the transfer.324 Thus, although Mr. Pacolli purports to have transferred EUR 4m in contribution to the purchase price of the shares, the actual transfer was not in that amount, but rather in the amount of EUR 5,014,876.00, in two instalments of EUR 4,011,676.00325 and EUR 1,003,200.00.326 The latter figures appear in various letters by Selim Pacolli,327 which, Respondent points out, refer to the privatization of the Grand Hotel but not to a 28 April 2006 transfer. More particularly, the transfers of 4,011,676.00 and EUR 1,003,200.00 are shown as having been made to UTC by NTSH, not by Claimant. The alleged transfer of 28 April 2006 is unmentioned either in Behgjet Pacolli's 29 February 2012 letter or in the letters from Selim Pacolli.\n\nResp. Reply on Jurisd., paras. 12 *et seq.*\n\nExh.

R-46: Letter from Mr. Selim Pacolli to Mr. Berisha/UTC copying PAK, 24 February 2012.\n\n349.\n\nIn short, Respondent's position is that Claimant made no investment in the Grand Hotel, whether for purposes of the ICSID Convention, the BIT or the Foreign Investment Law. Fundamentally, Claimant made no capital contribution, as required to constitute an investment, under all three instruments. Having made no capital contribution, Claimant neither incurred any risk, nor made an investment of the requisite duration, nor generated a profit or return, nor contributed to Kosovo's economic development.328 Thus, the requirements for an investment under the ICSID Convention were unmet.\n\nResp. Reply on Jurisd., paras. 281-293.\n\n(b) Claimant's Position\n-----------------------\n\n350.\n\nClaimant disagrees. It maintains that the factual link between Claimant's payment of EUR 4m and its agreement to invest in the Grand Hotel is \"evident.\"329 At the same time, Respondent's various representations and doubts concerning the transfer of funds are baseless. It is untrue, according to Claimant, that UTC transferred the purchase price to the KTA on the due date of 24 April 2006 and that by then the KTA had received all amounts due. In truth, by 24 April, only part of the purchase price had been paid. The KTA received payment in full only on 2 May 2006,330\n\nCl. Counter-Mem. on Jurisd., para. 117.\n\nCl. Rejoinder, paras. 78-107.\n\n351.\n\nClaimant explains the chronology more specifically as follows.\n\n352.\n\nThe Tender Rules required UTC, as winning bidder, to pay the purchase price to the designated bank account within a very short period, i.e., 20 days after being notified that it had won the bid.331 Having agreed with UTC and NTSH to co-invest, and knowing that payment in full was due on 24 April 2006, Claimant paid its agreed upon contribution of EUR 4m prior to that date, viz. on 20 April 2006. Claimant's CFO, Lucina Maesani-Gaiatto, testified that, in order to do so, Claimant asked its affiliate, Interfin, which owed payment to Claimant on a loan in the amount of EUR 6,997,500.00 on an unrelated matter, to make the EUR 4m payment to NTSH on its behalf.332 This Interfin did the following day.333 NTSH then transferred the sum of EUR 4,011,676.00 by wire to UTC. The wire contained the following notation: \"PAY ACCORDING TO CONTR. DT. 18.04.06 FOR PRIVATIZATION ACCORDING TO REFERENCE P-78.\"334 Claimant notes that \"P-78\" was a specific reference to the Grand Hotel share transactions. Again, on the same day, UTC then ordered payment of a total sum of EUR 7,661,250 to the KTA (that sum reflecting an advance deposit of EUR 500,000 already made).335 On 24 April, the KTA should have received payment in full. However, what the KTA received on 24 April was not actually a transfer of that sum of money, but only a notice of a transfer order,\"336 and the amount of money that the KTA actually received, as a result of the transfer, appears to have been the sums of EUR 3,661,000 and EUR 196,656, as shown by the KTA\u2019s statement for the Grand Hotel account for the relevant period.337\n\nExh.

In a letter to Claimant of 25 April 2006, copied to the KTA, the Authority attributed the rejection to the fact that Interfin did not hold a license to perform financial activities in Kosovo.339 As a result, the EUR 4,011,676.00 was returned by NTSH to Interfin on 26 April 2006, and on the same day by Interfin to Claimant.340\n\nMr. Pacolli provides a detailed account of the transfer in his Second Witness Statement, Exh.

Kosova Airlines.341 Upon receiving the funds back on 28 April 2006, Claimant on the same day transferred them directly to NTSH,342 as reflected in the Swiss Interbank Clearing (SIC) payment system343 and confirmed by Claimant\u2019s account statements,344 as well as by Claimant\u2019s external auditor.345 Then NTSH in turn forwarded the funds to UTC, a transaction confirmed by NTSH\u2019s account statement.346 Finally, on 29 April 2006, UTC transferred the sum of EUR 4,011,000 to the KTA\u2019s Grand Hotel bank account.347 Due to an intervening bank holiday and weekend, the credit only appeared in that account on 2 May 2006. Internal KTA communications confirm that the additional EUR 4,011,000 was indeed received and credited on 2 May 2006.348 According to Claimant, Mr. Berisha confirmed this entire chain of events by letter dated 19 June 2006.349\n\nExh.

More specifically, at the time Claimant\u2019s payment was made, the full purchase price had not been fully paid. It only became fully paid when Claimant\u2019s payment appeared in the KTA\u2019s Grand Hotel bank account on 2 May 2006.\n\n356.\n\nThe KTA could not have failed to know that Claimant was participating in the purchase of shares so as to enable UTC to fulfill its obligations as successful bidder under the Purchase Agreement. First, when the bank rejected the transfer of moneys made through Interfin, it so stated in a letter to Mr. Pacolli, copied to Selim Pacolli and the KTA.350 Also the EUR 4m was thereafter, on 2 May 2006, credited to the KTA\u2019s own account.351 The chronology is also fully consistent with the AGU, the agreement by which Claimant formalized its undertaking to make the necessary investment and comply with the obligations under the Commitment Agreement.\n\nExh.

First, though there is no dispute that the Eur 4m payment was made by Mabco, there is insufficient evidence that it was made for purposes of acquiring the Grand Hotel shares. Second, the sequence of events casts serious doubt on the transfer of funds having the purpose that Claimant attributes to it. Third, the process of payment itself was irregular.\n\na. Is the Eur 4m payment attributable to the purchase of Grand Hotel shares?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n362.\n\nRespondent casts doubt on the notion that the Eur 4m transfer was made for the purpose of acquiring the Grand Hotel shares. Although the evidence of that could certainly have been clearer, the Tribunal does not share Respondent\u2019s doubts. Ms. Maesani-Gaiatto testified without contradiction that when the BPK rejected Mabco\u2019s initial transfer of funds to NTSH, its explanatory letter to Mabco specified Mabco as the source of the funds, and that letter was copied to the KTA.360 Moreover, the onward transfer from NTSH to UTC bore the notation \"PAY ACCORDING TO CONTR. DT. 18.04.06 FOR PRIVATIZATION ACCORDING TO REFERENCE P-78.\"361 It is uncontested that \"P-78\" was a specific reference to the Grand Hotel share transactions. (The record in the case does not appear to contain an exhibit of the onward transfer from UTC to KTA.) This evidence cannot be characterized, as the Dissent suggests (para. 41), as \"circumstantial.\"\n\nMaesani-Gaiatto witness stmt, Exh. CWS-5, para. 16.\n\nExh. R-23: Transfer of EUR 4,011,676.00 from NTSH to UTC, 21 April 2006; Cl. Rejoinder on Jurisd., para. 82.\n\n363.\n\nNor is there evidence to suggest that those moneys were thereafter transferred elsewhere.\n\n364.\n\nThese are good indications of the purpose for which the transfer was made, and Respondent offers no serious alternative explanation for it. The closest it comes to doing so is to raise the possibility that the funds were transferred for the purpose of acquiring shares in a different hotel, the Hotel Iliria. But this, by Respondent\u2019s own admission, is without any documentation, and represents sheer conjecture.\n\nb. Is the chronology consistent with payment for purchase of the shares?\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n365.\n\nSecond, Respondent regards the chronology of events as inconsistent with the notion that Mabco made its payment for the purported purposes. However, the Tribunal cannot infer from the fact that the Eur 4m payment preceded conclusion of the AGU by 8 months that the payment had nothing to do with acquisition of the Grand Hotel shares. It is not inconceivable that Mabco would make the payment before arrangements among UTC, NTSH and Mabco became formalized, as long as those arrangements were in fact in place. Nor is it problematic that the payment also preceded conclusion of the Purchase Agreement between UTC and the KTA. Once the Purchase Agreement was formally concluded, UTC was immediately required to pay the purchase price into the KTA\u2019s designated escrow account. It is not remarkable that Mabco would seek to ensure that UTC immediately had the requisite funds for the purchase.\n\n366.\n\nRespondent observes that, in a letter dated 29 February 2012, Mr. Pacolli reported meeting Mr. Berisha for the first time in Vienna in the summer of 2006,362 the suggestion being that the April 2006 transfer could therefore have had nothing to do with purchase of the Grand Hotel shares. The sequence of events is somewhat counter-intuitive. However, the Tribunal notes Mr. Ejupi\u2019s testimony that, prior to the meeting in Vienna, he (allegedly at Mr. Shala\u2019s request) engaged in conversations with Mr. Pacolli about the prospect, at the KTA\u2019s suggestion, of participating with Mr. Ejupi in UTC\u2019s purchase of the Grand Hotel. The possibility cannot be excluded that, on the strength of those conversations, Mr. Pacolli made his contribution prior to actually meeting Mr. Berisha. This would be consistent with the fact that, when Mabco made the Eur 4m transfer, it made that transfer in the first instance to Mr. Ejupi\u2019s company, NTSH, with which it was cooperating, rather than to UTC directly.363\n\nResp. Reply on Jurisd., para. 16.\n\nExh. C-14: Wire transfer receipt of EUR 4'000'000, 29 April 2006.\n\n367.\n\nBased on the positive evidence that Mabco made the transfer of funds in connection with the Grand Hotel acquisition, the Tribunal cannot conclude otherwise.\n\nc. Is the payment process consistent with purchase of the shares?\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n368.\n\nThe apparent irregularities in connection with the actual payment of the funds are considerable, but they were effectively explained by Claimant's witness, Ms. Maesani-Gaiatto.364 The need for explanation was precipitated by Respondent's assertion that UTC's deadline for payment of the purchase price was 24 April 2006, but the transfer was actually made on 28 April 2006. Ms. Maesani-Gaiatto took the Tribunal through the precise chronology of the payment, explaining the reasons for the delay in receipt of the funds to the bank account that the KTA maintained at the BPK's letter to Mabco of 25 April 2006 rejecting the initial transfer of funds and requiring NTSH to return the funds to Mabco was copied to the KTA.365 The transfer that was eventually successful was made on 28 April 2006 and through successive transfers eventually credited to the KTA on 2 May 2006, specifically referencing purchase of the Grand Hotel shares.366 While the story, detailed above (paras. 353-355, *supra*), is indeed a convoluted one, and suggests a degree of ineptitude on Claimant's part, it adequately accounts for the delay in receipt of the monies.\n\nMaesni-Gaiatto witness stmt, Exh.

C-53: Statement of accounts for Grand Hotel of the BPK dated 13 July 2006.\n\n369.\n\nIn sum, the Tribunal concludes that the Eur 4m represented Mabco's participation, alongside UTC and NTSH, in acquisition of the Grand Hotel shares.\n\n**(3)** ***Claimant did not become an owner of shares by virtue of the AGU***\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n(a) Respondent's Position\n-------------------------\n\n370.\n\nAccording to Respondent, Claimant acquired no rights in the Grand Hotel as a result of the AGU because Claimant was neither a party to it nor its beneficiary. The AGU was entered into by Messrs. Pacolli, Berisha and Ejupi in their personal capacities.367 Although Mr. Pacolli was not only owner, but also CEO and authorized representative of the Mabetex Group, he was not acting in connection with the AGU in the capacity of agent or representative of Claimant.368 Respondent also cites laws and regulations in effect at that time for the proposition that if a party enters into a contract, its name must appear as either the contracting party or the beneficiary in order to claim performance under the contract.369 Yet, Claimant\u2019s name is unmentioned in the AGU or surrounding documents. Thus, even if Mr. Pacolli entered into an agreement for co-ownership with Messrs. Berisha and Ejupi, and even if the payment was for shares in Grand Hotel, that would not, under the applicable investment law, constitute an investment by Claimant.370\n\nResp.

Reply on Jurisd., paras. 228-232.\n\nResp. oral argum., tr. 13:14 - 14:5.\n\n371.\n\nRespondent argues that, even if Mr. Pacolli was acting as Claimant\u2019s agent in signing the AGU, the AGU was insufficient to transfer any share because (i) it is unclear, even with the presence of the word \"Grand,\" to what shares the AGU refers, (ii) the AGU imposed no obligation on any party to transfer shares to another, and (iii) the shares were never in fact transferred.371 On the last point, Respondent remarks that the Law on Business Organizations of Kosovo requires that all changes to the information contained in a registered charter of a limited liability company be publicly notified,372 indicating the names and addresses of the owners and their respective ownership interests.373 Any such amendments must then be registered with the Business Registration Agency.374 However, neither Mr. Pacolli nor Mr. Ejupi was ever registered as an owner of the Grand Hotel.375 Accordingly, neither Mr. Pacolli nor Mr. Ejupi had ownership of shares in the Grand Hotel, even in their personal capacities.376 Moreover, in the Appellate Panel of the Special Chamber, UTC objected to the intervention of Claimant and NTSH on the ground that they had no legal interest in the Hotel.\n\nResp.

Resp. Mem. on Jurisd., para. 90.\n\n372.\n\nIn addition, the AGU does not in any event purport to constitute a sale of shares, but refers only to a \"property purchased jointly.\"377 But that prior purchase is not identified. Respondent observes further that the AGU postdates payment of the EUR 4m, and that it in itself imposes no further payment obligations.378 Respondent asserts, more generally, that the AGU was not a contract for the transfer of shares, but only an internal agreement establishing rules governing the relationship among the alleged stockholders. It therefore presupposed that a transfer of shares had actually occurred, but did not constitute such a transfer.379\n\nExh. C-1 7: AGU, Sec. 1; Cl. Supp. to RfA, para. 20.\n\nResp.

Pacolli, Ejupi and Berisha, rather than Claimant, NTSH and UTC, respectively, but considers that \"one cannot seriously come to the conclusion that the AGU had the purpose of conferring ownership rights on the mentioned individuals.\"380 According to Claimant, these men all knew, from their prior discussions, that each was representing the company that they owned. Claimant also remarks that it was the respective companies that provided the funds for purchase of the shares.381 Moreover, when the AGU was concluded, Mr. Pacolli was registered in the Swiss Commercial Registry as director of Claimant with individual signatory authority.382 Thus, Messrs. Pacolli, Berisha and Ejupi did not sign the AGU in their personal capacities and for their personal interests. Even Mr. Berisha could not, through the AGU, agree to an allocation of shares in his personal capacity, since the shares were registered, not in his name, but in the name of UTC.383 If he was not acting in a personal capacity there is no reason to assume that either Mr. Pacolli or Mr. Ejupi was doing so.\n\nCl.

The AGU stated that UTC was \"a legal person with limited liability that is now registered as a company with limited liability.\" Presumably, Claimant is arguing that if Mr. Berisha signed the AGU in a representative as opposed to a personal capacity, there is every reason to suppose that Messrs. Pacolli and Ejupi signed in their representative capacities as well.\n\nCl. Counter-Mem. on Jurisd., para. 122.\n\n374.\n\nClaimant disputes that Law no. 02/L 123, requiring shareowners to be registered in the Kosovo Business Register has any relevance, as it was not in force when the investment was made or the AGU was concluded.384 More generally, Claimant cites academic authority385 and arbitral case law386 for the proposition that host State law does not govern the definition of an investment or the question whether an investment was made, but only the investment's legality,387 which is a separate issue. Moreover, the fact, pointed out by Respondent, that UTC objected to Claimant's intervention in its lawsuit in Kosovo has no bearing on whether Claimant did in fact acquire ownership of the shares.\n\nExh.

Although Respondent casts doubt on whether the AGU pertained to the Grand Hotel shares at all, the Tribunal finds sufficient evidence that, although the AGU itself imposed no obligations on the KTA, the subject of the AGU was acquisition of those shares.389\n\nExh. C-17: AGU.\n\n377.\n\nRespondent is correct that the AGU did not itself effectuate a transfer of shares from UTC to Claimant.390 The AGU notwithstanding, the shares in question were never in fact transferred to Claimant and Claimant\u2019s ownership of the shares is not publicly recorded, with the names and addresses of the owners and their respective ownership interests, as required by Kosovo\u2019s Law on Business Organizations.391 Nor is it registered with the Business Registration Agency.392 But, as the Tribunal has indicated,393 it views as the fairest characterization of Claimant\u2019s contention in this proceeding that it has an *entitlement* to share ownership, not ownership as such.\n\nResp.

Mr. Berisha signed the Agreement on behalf of UTC and Mrs. Ejupi signed on behalf of Mr. Ejupi and NTSH, but Selim Pacolli signed on behalf of Behgjet Pacolli and on behalf of Mabetex.394 Claimant was neither party to nor beneficiary of the Annex Agreement. In fact, as in the case of the AGU, Claimant\u2019s name is unmentioned in the Annex Agreement. In short, Claimant derived no rights from that Agreement or any property interest that could possibly constitute an investment.395 In any event, the Annex Agreement makes no reference to any payment of EUR 4m.\n\nBehgjet Pacolli testimony, tr. 154:8 - 154:24; Resp.

Moreover, no significance should be given to the reference to Mabetex, since Mabetex is the group of companies to which Claimant belongs.396 If anything, the fact that Selim Behgjet signed the Annex Agreement on behalf of Mabetex refutes the proposition that Behgjet Pacolli made the investment in his personal capacity.\n\nCl. Counter-Mem. on Jurisd., para. 127.\n\n(c) The Tribunal\u2019s Analysis and Findings\n----------------------------------------\n\n381.\n\nThe Tribunal does not linger over the 28 March 2012 Annex Agreement as a basis of Mabco\u2019s claim of entitlement to ownership of the Grand Hotel shares because Claimant does not principally rely on that instrument. Also, by its terms, the Annex Agreement required the PAK\u2019s approval, which appears not to have been given.397 Notably, however, appended to the Annex Agreement were (a) a business plan setting out the contemplated capital investments and increase in the number of employees over the following two years and (b) the required performance guarantee dated 21 March 2012 issued by the National Commercial Bank Kosovo in the amount of Eur 20.2m.398 Both submissions substantially corresponded to the items in the PAK\u2019s 19 March 2012 request for documentation.399 It appears that the PAK at no time suggested that the submissions were inadequate. Claimant states that in reply to a letter that it sent to the PAK in late June 2012, the PAK acknowledged that the submissions were satisfactory, but justified its refusal to register the shares on the ground that UTC had told it that its co-owners showed a \"lack of seriousness.400\n\nExh.

Counter-Mem. on Jurisd., para. 74.\n\n382.\n\nRespondent observes that, in the Annex Agreement, Mr. Berisha and Ms. Ejupi indicated expressly that they were acting on behalf of UTC and NTSH, respectively, while Selim Pacolli represented that he signed on behalf of Behgjet Pacolli and Mabetex.401 The Tribunal does not attach great significance to this fact. Having concluded that Behgjet Pacolli acted throughout on behalf of Mabco, the fact that Selim Pacolli acted on behalf of Behgjet Pacolli changes nothing. Nor, for reasons earlier explained,402 does the reference to Mabetex greatly assist Respondent's contention that Mr. Pacolli acted throughout on his own rather than Claimant's behalf. If he was acting entirely in a personal capacity, Mabetex would not warrant mention.\n\nExh. C-20: Annex Agreement, 28 March 2012.\n\nSee paras. 341-345, *supra.*\n\n**B. CLAIMANT IS NOT A FOREIGN INVESTOR**\n-----------------------------------------\n\n383.\n\nRespondent argues that, for two reasons, Claimant is not a foreign investor:\n\n(1) Claimant is not an investor.\n\n(2) Even if Claimant were an investor, it was not a foreign investor.\n\n384.\n\nUnder the ICSID Convention, as under the BIT and the Foreign Investment Law, it is insufficient to establish jurisdiction that an investment was made. Claimant must, among other things, have made the investment, i.e. qualify as an investor. It must be also have the requisite foreign nationality. Under the BIT, Claimant must have Swiss nationality. Under both the ICSID Convention and the Foreign Investment Law, Claimant must have a nationality other than that of Kosovo.\n\n***(1) Claimant is not an investor***\n-------------------------------------\n\n(a) Respondent's Position\n-------------------------\n\n385.\n\nRespondent's position on this point follows directly from all that has preceded. In its view, for all the reasons previously set out, the alleged investment in Kosovo was never made, and even if it was made, was made by Mr. Pacolli as an individual, not by Claimant. Also, according to Respondent, Mr. Pacolli lacked legal authority to represent it. As a consequence, Claimant is not an investor, within the meaning of ICSID Convention, the BIT or the Foreign Investment Law.\n\n(b) Claimant\u2019s Position\n-----------------------\n\n386.\n\nSimilarly, Claimant\u2019s position on whether Mabco is an investor, within the meaning of the relevant instruments, has been fully set out above. It maintains that it constitutes an investor, within the meaning of ICSID Convention and otherwise. In addition, it denies Respondent\u2019s suggestion that Mr. Pacolli lacked the requisite legal authority to represent Claimant in his dealings in this case, suggesting that, if the matter were to be further examined, it would need to be examined, not under the law of the host State, Kosovo, but under the law of the State of incorporation, i.e., Switzerland,403 whose requirements Claimant satisfies.404 It adds that, in any event, the question whether Mr. Pacolli validly represents Claimant is not a jurisdictional issue, but rather one that is substantive in nature and, if it is to be examined, is to be examined, not under the law of the host State, Kosovo, but rather under the law of the State of incorporation, i.e. Switzerland,405 which Respondent has not adduced. It maintains that, under Swiss law, Mr. Pacolli was empowered to represent it.406\n\nCl. Rejoinder on Jurisd., para. 229.\n\nClaimant maintains that Mr. Pacolli was registered in the Swiss Commercial Registry as director of Mabco with individual signatory powers in Mabco\u2019s name. Cl.

Although Respondent claims that Mr. Pacolli lacked legal authority to represent Claimant, neither Party has adduced evidence of either Swiss or Kosovan law on the subject, and the matter was not pursued.\n\n388.\n\nOtherwise, the arguments advanced by Respondent and Claimant under this heading are largely ones that the Tribunal has already dealt with in other sections of this Decision (see paras. 339-345, *supra*). The Tribunal reaffirms that, factually, Mr. Pacolli acted in his dealings with the KTA and the PAK, as well as with UTC and NTSH, in a representative capacity.\n\n***(2) Even if Claimant were an investor, it was not a foreign investor***\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n(a) Respondent\u2019s Position\n-------------------------\n\n389.\n\nRespondent argues that not only the BIT and the Kosovo Foreign Investment Law, but also the ICSID Convention, under which this case is proceeding, imposes a nationality requirement on an alleged investor. Under the BIT, the alleged investor must be a national of the other Contracting State while; under the Kosovo Foreign Investment Law, it must be a foreign national; and under the ICSID Convention, it must be a national of another ICSID Contracting State. Claimant satisfies the requirements of none of these instruments.\n\n390.\n\nAccording to Respondent, Claimant is indisputably a foreign entity. But Claimant\u2019s Swiss nationality is irrelevant because Claimant was not an investor in this case.407 Even if Mr. Pacolli made the investment that is alleged, as a national of Kosovo, he lacks the requisite nationality under ICSID, the BIT or the Foreign Investment Law. He is not a national of another Contracting State (for purposes of the ICSID Convention), or a national of Kosovo\u2019s BIT partner (for purposes of the BIT) or any foreign nationality (for purposes of the Foreign Investment Law).408\n\nResp.

Reply on Jurisd., paras. 4 02-403.\n\n391.\n\nRespondent further argues that even if Claimant, rather than Behgjet Pacolli acting in his personal capacity, made an investment in Kosovo, Claimant cannot be considered a Swiss national for purposes of the BIT. According to Respondent, Claimant performs no economic activity in Switzerland, as the BIT specifically requires.409 It is not sufficient that Claimant manages several projects from an office in Switzerland, a proposition for which, according to Respondent, Claimant has in any event adduced no evidence.410 Counsel for Respondent suggests that only the place where a construction company engages in its real economic activities is the place where the construction projects are performed.411\n\nExh.

Q, Tr. 51:24 - 52:11.\n\n(b) Claimant\u2019s Position\n-----------------------\n\n392.\n\nClaimant advances several arguments in response. First, it insists that Mr. Pacolli acted throughout the privatization process as Claimant\u2019s representative, and that this was well known to Respondent. Mr. Pacolli was known throughout Kosovo as having established Claimant as a business entity and as a component part of Mabetex, which he was also known to have founded.412 Claimant observes more generally that, in any transaction, a juridical person is necessarily represented by a natural person.413 The fact that the owner of a company is of a different nationality than the claimant company, and thus not a national of the other Contracting State, is irrelevant. That situation is in fact extremely common.414 That is no less the case just because the owner is a national of the host State.\n\nCl. Counter-Mem. on Jurisd., paras. 157-159.\n\nCl. Counter-Mem. on Jurisd., para. 156.\n\nCl. Counter-Mem. on Jurisd., para. 159.\n\n393.\n\nClaimant further disputes Respondent\u2019s contention that Claimant conducts no real economic activities in Switzerland.415 Claimant, as part of the Mabetex Group, conducts project planning, development, and management in Switzerland for construction around the world.416 Ms. Maesani-Gaiatto testified that since 1999 the number of Claimant\u2019s employees based in Switzerland has ranged from 13 to 60, the latter being the number of employees at this time.417 As evidence of the increase in number of employees in Switzerland, Ms. Maesani-Gaiatto cites Claimant\u2019s balance sheets for 2006 and 2017.418\n\nCl.

C-70: Balance Sheet of Mabco for the business year 2017, 31 December 2017.\n\n(c) The Tribunal\u2019s Findings and Analysis\n----------------------------------------\n\n394.\n\nRespondent is correct that, if Mr. Pacolli was acting in a personal capacity, neither the BIT, nor the Foreign Investment Law, nor the ICSID Convention419 would be applicable to this case, since Mr. Pacolli is a national of Kosovo. However, the Tribunal, having concluded that Mr. Pacolli was acting on behalf of Mabco rather than himself, the relevant issue is the nationality of Mabco. Mabco indisputably has Swiss nationality420 and is therefore presumably entitled, from a *ratione personae* point of view, to proceed under the ICSID Convention and seek protection under both the BIT and the Foreign Investment Law in connection with an investment in Kosovo.\n\nArticle 25(2)(a) ICSID Convention. See also Exh. CL-12: *Champion Trading Company et al. v. Arab Republic of**Egypt,* ICSID Case No. ARB/02/9, Decision on Jurisdiction, 21 October 2003.\n\nExh. C-4: Certificate of Commercial Register of Canton Ticino, 20 April 2017.\n\n395.\n\nHowever, Respondent questions Claimant\u2019s Swiss nationality and therefore its entitlement to proceed under the Convention and its eligibility to invoke the BIT. (As far as the Foreign Investment Law is concerned, Claimant need not of course be Swiss; any nationality other than that of Kosovo would suffice.) Respondent bases its challenge on the premise that, under the BIT, it is insufficient that Claimant is a Swiss national. It must also engage in economic activity in Switzerland.421 Although Respondent does not contend that Claimant is a \"shell company,\" it denies that Claimant engages in sufficient activity in Switzerland to satisfy the BIT requirement. The Tribunal is unconvinced. Ms. Maesani-Gaiatto testified that Claimant conducts all its project planning and management activity in Lugano and, for those purposes, has at all times employed at those headquarters a significant number of employees,422 and her testimony was not refuted. Nor can the Tribunal accept Respondent\u2019s proposition that the economic activities performed by a construction company such as Mabco are to be considered by definition as conducted only in the locales where its construction projects are situated.\n\nResp.

EVEN IF CLAIMANT HAD MADE AN INVESTMENT IN KOSOVO, IT DOES NOT CONSTITUTE A \"PROTECTED INVESTMENT\"**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n396.\n\nRespondent contends that, even if Claimant made an investment, it was not lawfully made. It bases this contention on the following two arguments:\n\n(1) The alleged investment was not made in accordance with domestic law.\n\n(2) The alleged investment would not contribute to the economic development of Kosovo.\n\n**(1)** ***The alleged investment was not made in accordance with domestic law***\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n(a) Respondent\u2019s Position\n-------------------------\n\n397.\n\nRespondent argues that both the BIT and the Foreign Investment Law require that, in order to be protected, an investment must be lawful, i.e., must have been made in accordance with domestic law. According to Respondent, its consent to arbitrate under both the BIT and the Foreign Investment Law is expressly conditional on the lawfulness of a claimant\u2019s investment.423 Thus, an investment\u2019s lawfulness is a jurisdictional requirement, whether stated in the definition of investment (as in the Foreign Investment Law) or in the clause on scope of application (as in the BIT).424\n\nResp. post-hearing br., paras. 60-63.\n\nResp.

See Resp. post-hearing br., paras. 60-63.\n\n398.\n\nClaimant cannot have lawfully acquired an investment in Kosovo, in the form of shares in the Grand Hotel, because any arrangement that Mr. Berisha, acting on behalf of UTC, made with undisclosed third parties, such as Claimant, would have been in breach of the Purchase Agreement.425 Article 5.1.3 of that Agreement forbade a buyer to \"purchase[e]... Shares... as an agent for a third party [or]. form[] any informal or formal undisclosed agreements or consortiums... with any undisclosed third party.\"\n\nResp. Mem. on Jurisd., para. 114.\n\n399.\n\nFinally, even if Claimant had purchased the shares, Claimant would have violated the Tender Rules governing the privatization process in numerous respects,426 including the supply of required information and assurances. For example, Rule 4.4(ii)(dd) provides that, if a bidder is a consortium of individuals or legal entities, it must submit certified copies of the consortium's founding documents, identification cards, passports, and registration information, as well as identify all the beneficial owners and \"Control Persons\" - none of which was done.\n\nExh.

R-14). Rule 1(f) automatically disqualifies ant bidder that does not disclose its principals. Rule 4.4 requires bidders, if acting as an agent for another part or a consortium, to provide detailed information about all participants. Rule 14.7 renders an agreement concluded with the winning bidder voidable if it is determined that it colluded during the tender process or otherwise violated the Tender Rules.\n\nResp. post-hearing br., paras. 72, 75, 77, 86-87. Respondent suggests that only non-compliance with formal legal requirements can be overlooked in determining whether an investment is or is not lawful.\n\n401.\n\nRespondent also rejects any notion that it is estopped from contesting the lawfulness of Claimant\u2019s alleged investment due to Mr. Shala having actively solicited and approved Claimant\u2019s investment in the Grand Hotel. As noted (para. 259, *supra*), Respondent denies that Mr. Shala took any such actions. More generally, Respondent denies the existence of any evidence in the record to suggest that it endorsed or accepted Claimant\u2019s alleged investment.431 Respondent made no representations about the validity of the alleged investment under local law, nor did it ever rely upon the alleged investment agreement.432 It consistently rejected Claimant\u2019s assertions of ownership.433\n\nResp. oral argum., tr. 23:6 - 23:11, Resp.

First, Claimant contends that Respondent misinterprets the legality requirement set out in the BIT. In its view, an investment, for purposes of the BIT, is defined in Article 1\u00a0merely as a qualifying asset established or acquired by a claimant, without reference to its legality, and Article 11 does not make submission of a dispute to arbitration dependent on the legality of the underlying asset. The legality of an investment is, in Claimant\u2019s view a merits, not a jurisdictional, issue.434 According to Claimant, the legality of an investment is a jurisdictional requirement only if the definition of investment in the BIT so provides, which, unlike in other BITs, is not the case here.435 Accordingly, the lawfulness of an investment under the present BIT pertains to the scope of application of the BIT, rather than jurisdiction, and is a merits issue.436\n\nCl. Counter-Mem. on Jurisd., paras. 137-139. Claimant also cites the award in Exhs. CL-7/RL-59: *Metal-tech Ltd. v. Uzbekistan,* ICSID Case No. ARB/10/3, Award, 4 October 2013, para. 127, for the proposition that a legality requirement is not a universal principle of international investment law.\n\nCl. Counter-Mem. on Jurisd., paras. 135-139.\n\nCl. post-hearing br., paras. 93 -94, 97.\n\n403.\n\nBut, even if the legality of an investment were a jurisdictional requirement, it is satisfied. According to Claimant, in order to be disqualifying, an illegality must consist of a breach of a fundamental principle of law,437 which is not the case in a violation of a tendering rule. Moreover, an illegality, especially if not fundamental, may be excused where the claimant acted in good faith, as is Claimant\u2019s case.438\n\nClaimant cites in support of this proposition the awards in Exh. CL-9: *LESI SpA et Astaldi SpA v. Algeria,* ICSID Case No. ARB/05/03, Decision of 12 July 2006, para. 83; Exh. CL-10: *Inceysa Vallisoletana, S.L. v. El Salvador,* ICSID Case No. ARB/03/26, Award, 2 August 2006; Exh. RL-6: *Fraport AG Frankfurt Airport Services Worldwide v. Republic of the Philippines,* ICSID Case No. ARB/03/25, Award, 16 August 2007. Tribunals have declined jurisdiction due to theillegality of an investment only in cases of serious violations of fundamental principles of host State law. Claimant cites as examples Exh. CL-32: *Plama Consortium Limited v. Republic of Bulgaria,* ICSID Case No. ARB/03/25, Award, 27 August 2008, paras. 133-135, 137, 143 (fraud); Exh. CL-34: *Saur international SA v. Argentine Republic,* ICSID Case No. ARB/04/4, Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability, 6 June 2012, para. 308 (misappropriation ofmillions of dollars of government funds).\n\nIn support of this proposition, Claimant cites Exh. RL-6: *Fraport AG Frankfurt Airport Services Worldwide v. Republic of the Philippines,* ICSID CaseNo. ARB/03/25, Award, 16 August 2007, para. 396.\n\n404.\n\nMoreover, the Tender Rules, and the possibility of a breach thereof, are irrelevant in this case because Claimant was specifically engaged by the KTA as a prospective purchaser well after the tendering procedure had ended. It was not a participant in that procedure and therefore could not have violated it.439 According to Claimant, it is common practice that if a winning bidder cannot pay the purchase price, other investors may assist it.440 Claimant refers to the fact that the KTA accepted and never questioned the investment made in Mabetex\u2019s name in the Hotel Iliria and the Pipeline Factory as co-owner even though Claimant had not participated in the bidding process for those entities.441 If any violation of the Tender Rules was committed, it would in any event have been committed by the bidder which was UTC.442\n\nCl. post-hearing br., para. 98.\n\nCl. post-hearing br., para. 98, citing Exh.C-49.\n\nCl. post-hearing br., para. 114.\n\nCl.

Pacolli and Ejupi in exchange for registration of their shares demonstrates that it was aware of their participation in the purchase of the shares.447\n\nCl.

Similarly, the 2005 Foreign Investment Law provides in Article 2(1) that an investment may take the form of an asset that has been \"contributed to, or leased or otherwise temporarily provided under contract to, any other type of organization *lawfully* established in Kosovo for use in such organization's business or other activities in Kosovo\" (emphasis added).448 Article 2.1.4 of the Kosovo 2014 Foreign Investment Law extends protection only to \"[i]nvestments,\" defined as \"any asset owned or otherwise *lawfully* held by a Foreign Person in the Republic of Kosovo for the purpose of conducting *lawful* commercial activities\" (emphasis added).\n\nHowever, under the 2005 Law, an investment can also take theform of an asset \"contributed to a Kosovo business organization in return for an ownership interest in that business organization,\" without expressly requiring that the business organization must have been established lawfully.\n\n407.\n\nClaimant maintains initially that the lawfulness of an investment is a merits issue and therefore not to be determined at this stage.449 The Tribunal disagrees. According to well-established jurisprudence,450 unless an investment is lawful, it cannot constitute an investment within the meaning of an investment protection instrument, particularly when the instrument specifically requires that an investment be lawful. The Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction under the BIT and Foreign Investment Law thus depends on the alleged investment being a lawful one.\n\nCl. Counter-mem. on Jurisd., paras. 136 *et seq.;* Cl.

Vandevelde, *Bilateral Investment Treaties* (2010), pp. 152-157.\n\n408.\n\nRespondent\u2019s assertion of unlawfulness turns on the fact that Claimant did not comply with the rules of tender under Kosovo law.451 That Claimant did not comply with those rules is beyond doubt. Claimant makes two arguments in reply. First, it maintains that the tender rules of Kosovo are insufficiently fundamental in order for non-compliance with them to render its investment unlawful, within the meaning of the BIT or the Foreign Investment Law. Second, it claims that, even if the rules are sufficiently fundamental for that purpose, Respondent waived any objection based on the alleged investment\u2019s unlawfulness.452\n\nResp. Reply on Jurisd., paras. 375-391; Resp. post-hearing brief, paras. 68-71.\n\nCl. Rejoinder on Jurisd., paras. 6, 195.\n\n409.\n\nThe Tribunal has no reason to rule on the question whether the tender rules are sufficiently fundamental within the meaning of the lawfulness requirement. This is because, in the Tribunal\u2019s judgment, the PAK indeed waived any claim of unlawfulness. The record shows that the PAK engaged in substantial negotiations with Claimant, in contemplation of Claimant's eventual acquisition of the Grand Hotel shares, well after the tender procedure had concluded and without the PAK having launched a new tender procedure. During those negotiations, which continued well into the early months of 2012, as late as April, the PAK voiced no concern over the legality of the manner in which Claimant was proceeding As late as 2012, the PAK indicated that all that remained to register the shares was production by Claimant of certain documentation. Arbitral case law suggests that an illegality in an investment that might otherwise disqualify the investment from protection cannot be raised as a jurisdictional defense if the State was aware of the illegality and expressed no objection on that basis.453\n\nSee, e.g., Exh. CL-35: *Desert Line Projects LLC v. Republic of Yemen,* ICSID Case No. ARB/05/17, Award, 6 February 2008, para. 106.\n\n410.\n\nRespondent accordingly cannot impugn Claimant's putative investment in Kosovo on the ground that it was unlawful.\n\n**(2)** ***The alleged investment would not contribute to the economic development of Kosovo***\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n(a) Respondent's Position\n-------------------------\n\n411.\n\nAlthough Respondent did not pursue this argument, it initially maintained that contribution to economic development of a host State is a necessary element of an investment and in its absence an investment is illegal. In this case, the alleged investment, even if made, was not lawful because it failed to contribute to Kosovo's economic development.454 The argument is essentially that the successful bidder, UTC, had failed to fulfill its obligations under the Commitment Agreement with regard, among other things, to levels of contribution of capital and employment,455 and Claimant cannot therefore maintain that it substantially contributed to economic development of the home State.\n\nResp.

Mem. on Jurisd., paras. 119-123.\n\n(b) Claimant's Position\n-----------------------\n\n412.\n\nClaimant rejects this argument on the ground that Kosovo's withdrawal of the shares was not precipitated by UTC's alleged noncompliance with the Commitment Agreement, assuming that would in itself render the investment unlawful, but rather by Claimant's refusal to pay a bribe.456 Mr. Ejupi testified that the only reason the shares were ultimately withdrawn was indeed his and Mr. Pacolli's refusal to pay any bribes.457 Claimant also maintains that UTC and the PAK made Claimant's access to the hotel, and therefore Claimant's further contributions, impossible.458\n\nCl. Counter-Mem. on Jurisd., para. 148; Behgjet Pacolli 2d witness stmt, Exh. CWS-3, para. 17.\n\nEjupi witness stmt, Exh. CWS-4, para. 19.\n\nCl. Counter-Mem. on Jurisd., para. 148.\n\n413.\n\nMore fundamentally, Claimant argues that, had its investment not been withdrawn by the PAK, it would have contributed to Kosovo's economic development, for the simple reason that the Grand Hotel's privatization was part of a project to privatize some 500 SOEs as a major boost to the country's economy and that the hotel was a particularly prestigious and valuable element of the economy.459\n\nCl. Counter-Mem. on Jurisd., paras. 147-150.\n\n(c) The Tribunal's Analysis and Findings\n----------------------------------------\n\n414.\n\nIn a line of argument that it has not pursued, Respondent has argued that in order to be protected an investment must contribute to the economic development of the host State. The Tribunal does not find language in any of the instruments at issue in this case suggesting that an investment is not lawful unless it makes a contribution of that kind. It is also aware of no award standing for, or literature supporting, that proposition. In an earlier portion of this Decision (see para. 296, *supra*), the Tribunal acknowledged that some tribunals have treated contribution to the economic development of the host State as part of the definition of an investment under the ICSID Convention but, for reasons explained there, it joins the large number of tribunals that decline to do so. It would make little sense, having dispensed with that requirement in connection with the definition of an investment, to then reintroduce it as an element of an investment's lawfulness.\n\n415.\n\nOur consideration of this argument can stop there. But, in any event, the Tribunal finds, again as stated earlier (para. 301, *supra*), that renovation and management of the Grand Hotel represented a significant contribution to Kosovo's tourism industry and thus to Kosovo's economic development more generally.\n\n**D. KOSOVO HAS NOT GIVEN ITS CONSENT TO ARBITRATE THE PRESENT DISPUTE**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n416.\n\nRespondent maintains that, under both the BIT and the Foreign Investment Law, Claimant could not conclude an agreement to arbitrate with Kosovo without satisfying the conditions to which Kosovo subjected its offer to arbitrate. Because Claimant did not fulfill those conditions prior to initiating arbitration, no agreement to arbitrate came into existence.\n\n417.\n\nThere are three conditions required in order to accept an offer to arbitrate under the relevant instruments that, according to Respondent, Claimant failed to satisfy.460\n\n(1) Claimant failed to present an \"investment dispute,\" as required by both the BIT and the Foreign Investment Law.\n\n(2) Claimant failed to comply with the BIT's and Foreign Investment Law's election of remedies clauses.\n\n(3) Claimant failed to satisfy the BIT's requirement of prior consultation.\n\nEach of these assertions is discussed in turn below.\n\nResp. Mem. on Jurisd., para. 130.\n\n***(1) Claimant failed to present an \"investment dispute,\" as required by both the BIT and the foreign invesment law***\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n418.\n\nHere Respondent reiterates that, having not acquired an ownership interest in shares of Grand Hotel, Claimant did not make an investment, and therefore has not presented to the Tribunal an \"investment dispute.\" This argument and Claimant's defense thereto have been addressed earlier (see paras. 293-322, *supra*) and require no further elaboration here.\n\n***(2) Claimant failed to comply with the BIT's and Foreign Investment law's election of remedies clause.***\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n(a) Respondent\u2019s Position\n-------------------------\n\n419.\n\nRespondent next argues that, having brought suit in the courts of Kosovo, Claimant is precluded by a \"fork in the road\" provision from thereafter initiating and maintaining this proceeding. Respondent maintains that both the BIT and the 2014 Foreign Investment Law require an election of remedies as between litigation and arbitration and that Claimant made its election by having recourse to the courts. Article 11(2) of the BIT provides:\n\n*If... consultations do not result in a solution within six months from the date of the written request for consultations, the investor may submit the dispute either to the courts or the administrative tribunals of the Contracting party concerned or to international arbitration.*\n\n(emphasis added)\n\nArticle 16(2) of the 2014 Foreign Investment Law is worded differently. It provides:\n\n*In the absence of... an agreed procedure, a foreign investor shall have the right to require that the investment dispute be settled either through litigation before a court of competent jurisdiction in the Republic of Kosovo or through local and international arbitration.*\n\n(emphasis added)\n\nThe Tribunal notes that 2005 Foreign Investment Law contains no such requirement.461\n\nArticle 16(2) of the 2005 Foreign Investment Law is silent on the availability of a remedy in the courts of Kosovo. It only addresses arbitration, providing that \"[t]he foreign investor may choose any of the following procedural rules to govern the arbitration of the investment dispute,\" specifying as available the ICSID Convention and ICSID Additional Facility Rules, provided their jurisdictional requirements are met, the UNCITRAL Rules and the ICC Rules (Exh. C-2).\n\n420.\n\nIn Respondent\u2019s view, use of the phrase \"either... or\" in both provisions demonstrates that Claimant could pursue either of the two mentioned avenues of relief, but not both. In other words, both Article 11(2) of the BIT and Article 16(2) of the 2014 Foreign Investment Law constitute \"fork in the road\" provisions.462 Prior to initiating arbitration, Claimant both brought an action against the PAK for annulment of its exercise of the share call option and sought to intervene in the UTC's action for annulment of the same decision.463 Because Claimant first brought litigation over the dispute in the courts of Kosovo, it is barred by the election of remedies provision from thereafter pursuing arbitration.464 Claimant's choice to litigate its grievances was irreversible.\n\nResp.

Reply on Jurisd., para. 320.\n\n421.\n\nAccording to Respondent, it is of no consequence that Claimant based its litigation on Kosovo's alleged undue interference with Claimant's alleged shareholding in Grand Hotel, while basing this proceeding on unlawful expropriation and denial of fair and equitable treatment, since the actions have the same subject matter.465 Both claims arise out of the same factual circumstances, make the same allegations, and seek the same relief, viz. protection from the withdrawal of shares. At the center of both the arbitration and litigation is the legality of the PAK's decision to withdraw the shares in the Grand Hotel.\n\nResp. Reply on Jurisd., paras. 325-331.\n\n422.\n\nRespondent argues that, under arbitral case law, application of a fork in the road provision does not require satisfaction of the so-called \"triple identity test\" (identities of parties, object and cause of action), but merely a demonstration that the two claims are substantially equivalent,466 which they are in this case.\n\nResp.

Republic of Ecuador,* PCA Case No. 2009-12, Third Interim Award on Jurisdiction and Admissibility, 27 February 2012, paras. 4.76-4.77; Exh. RL-42: Campbell McLachlan et al., *International Investment Law: Substantive Principles* (Oxford U. Press, 2d ed. 2017), para. 4,108.\n\n(b) Claimant's Position\n-----------------------\n\n423.\n\nClaimant advances several arguments in response.\n\n424.\n\nFirst, Claimant disagrees with Respondent's reading of Article 11(2) of the BIT and Article 16(2) of the 2014 Foreign Investment Law. In Claimant's view, the \"either\"/\"or\" formulation simply gives an investor a choice of remedies, but does not by its terms forbid resort to both.467\n\nCl. Counter-Mem. on Jurisd., para. 171.\n\n425.\n\nClaimant further points to Article 11(4) of the BIT. In its estimation, Article 11(4) is not a \"fork in the road\" provision either. It expressly provides that, once the investor has elected to arbitrate its dispute, that choice of forum is final and the investor cannot thereafter have recourse to a host State court on the same claim. However, it does not provide the converse, namely that once the investor has elected to litigate its dispute in host State court, that choice of jurisdiction is final and the investor cannot thereafter have recourse to arbitration on the same claim. In other words, the clause in the present case is asymmetric. Claimant points out that it is easy enough to draft a clause providing that whichever forum a claimant chooses - whether litigation or arbitration - that choice is irreversible. Illustrative of the several examples provided by Claimant, all of which are BITs concluded by Switzerland, is the Colombia-Switzerland:\n\n*Once the investor has referred the dispute to either a national tribunal or an international arbitration mechanism..., the choice of the procedure shall be final.*468\n\nAgreement between the Swiss Confederation and the Republic of Colombia on the Promotion and Reciprocal Protection of Investments (Exh. C-71), Art. 11(4). Also cited are Agreement between the Swiss Confederation and the Republic of Costa Rica on the Promotion and Reciprocal Protection of Investments (Exh. C-72), Art. 9; Agreement between the Swiss Confederation and the Arab Republic of Egypt on the Promotion and Reciprocal Protection of Investments (Exh. C-73), Art. 12(6); Agreement between the Swiss Confederation and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia on the Promotion and Reciprocal Protection of Investments (Exh. C-74), Art. 10.\n\n426.\n\nClaimant further takes the position that, even if the provisions of the BIT and the 2014 Foreign Investment Law were to be read as \"fork in the road\" clauses, they would not bar access to arbitration following litigation because the claims in the two fora are not the same. In the courts of Kosovo, Claimant invoked domestic law, which the Tribunal understands as the law governing the registration of shares, which is most likely part of administrative law, whereas in this proceeding, it asserts claims of expropriation and violation of fair and equitable treatment, as well as denial of justice, under the BIT and the Foreign Investment Law.469 Accordingly, the triple identity test, widely adopted for \"fork-in-the road\" purposes, is not satisfied. While there is an identity of parties and arguably an identity of object, there is no identity of cause of action. So far as identity of cause of action is concerned, the prevailing view among investment tribunals is that contract and investment treaty claims are distinct.470 Although a \"fundamental basis\" test has recently emerged,471 it is not the prevailing view. A leading case emphasized that it is \"necessary... to determine whether claimed entitlements have the same normative source.\"472 That the litigation and arbitration in this case do not share the same normative source is, to Claimant\u2019s mind, obvious.\n\nCl. Counter-Mem. on Jurisd., paras. 172-174. Although Claimant refers in these paragraphs to the BIT, its argument would be equally applicable to the 2014 Foreign Investment Law.\n\nCl.

Arab Republic of Egypt,* ICSID Case No. ARB/09/15, Award, 6 May 2014.\n\n*Pantechniki*, *supra.*\n\n427.\n\nFinally, according to Claimant, the fork in the road principle is in any event inapplicable to this case because the courts of Kosovo declined to entertain on the merits any of the claims advanced by Claimant.473 Claimant cites precedent to this effect.474\n\nCl. Supp. to RfA, para. 73.\n\nExh. CL-41: *Mr.* *Hassan Awdi, Enterprise Business Consultants, Inc. and Alfa El Corporation v. Romania,* ICSID Case No. ARB/10/13, Award, 2 March 2015, para. 203.\n\n(c) The Tribunal\u2019s Analysis and Findings\n----------------------------------------\n\n428.\n\nResolving this issue entails making potentially three determinations. First, do the BIT and/or the 2014 Foreign Investment Law impose an election of remedies requirement? Second, assuming that these instruments do contain a fork in the road requirement and that Claimant did pursue litigation prior to initiating arbitration, are the claims in the two fora substantially the same? Third, should the Tribunal so find, is it of consequence that, as Claimant contends, the courts of Kosovo did not address or decide its claims on the merits.\n\n429.\n\nAs noted, Article 11(2) BIT invites foreign investors to submit their claims either to litigation or arbitration:\n\n*If... consultations do not result in a solution within six months from the date of the written request for consultations, the investor may submit the dispute either to the courts or the administrative tribunals of the Contracting party concerned or to international arbitration.*\n\n(emphasis added)\n\nFor arbitration, the options are ICSID, the ICSID Additional Facility and the UNCITRAL Rules.\n\n430.\n\nBIT Article 11(4) goes on to provide that \"[o]nce the investor has referred the investment dispute to international arbitration... the choice of jurisdiction shall be final.\" Arguably Article 11(4) modifies Article 11(2) by rendering it a \"one-way\" election of remedies clause, barring a claimant from bringing litigation of a claim or claims previously submitted to arbitration, but not, conversely, barring a claimant from initiating arbitration over a claim or claims previously brought to the courts. Under this view, the BIT would entitle an investor to pursue litigation over its claims without prejudice to its right to thereafter submit them to arbitration. However, it seems to the Tribunal more plausible, especially in view of its placement within Article 11, that Article 11 (4) has a more limited import, namely that if and when a claimant opts for arbitration and institutes proceedings before one arbitral institution, it may not thereafter pursue its claim before a different arbitral institution. So viewed, Article 11(4) would leave Article 11(2), and any limitation that it imposes, fully intact.\n\n431.\n\nThe 2014 Foreign Investment Law similarly offers claimants both a litigation and arbitration option:\n\n*In the absence of such an agreed procedure, a foreign investor shall have the right to require that the investment dispute be settled either through litigation before a court of competent jurisdiction in the Republic of Kosovo or through local and international arbitration. The foreign investor may choose any of the following procedural rules to govern the arbitration of the investment dispute:...*\n\nIf a claimant opts for arbitration, its options are the ICSID Convention, the ICSID Additional Facility Rules, the UNCITRAL Rules and the ICC Rules.\n\n432.\n\nThe question then is whether a treaty or statutory provision enabling a claimant to submit a dispute *either* to the courts (or administrative tribunals) of the host State *or* international arbitration constitutes a \"fork in the road\" provision.\n\n433.\n\nIt seems to the Tribunal quite reasonable to read a provision enabling a claimant to proceed either in litigation or in arbitration as simply giving it two avenues of recourse against an alleged BIT violation. It does not follow from the fact that a claimant has two options that a choice once made is necessarily an irreversible one, so that availing oneself of one remedy precludes it from thereafter resorting to the other. As the above examples show, there exists standard language by which States, in drafting their BITs, can clearly require investors to make an irreversible election of remedies. The Tribunal cannot comfortably conclude that BIT Article 11(2), as written, operates to bar Claimant from proceeding in this forum.\n\n434.\n\nIn reaching its conclusion, the Tribunal is also influenced by comparing the language of BIT Article 11(2) and the analogous provisions in other BITs. An example of a classic \"fork in the road\" provision are Articles VII(2) and (3) of the Argentina-U.S. BIT, according to which:\n\n*Provided that the* [investor] *has not submitted the dispute for resolution under paragraph 2 (a)* [the courts or administrative tribunals of the host State] *or (b)* [any previously agreed dispute settlement procedure]...*, the* [investor] *may choose to consent in writing to the submission of the dispute for settlement by binding arbitration...*\n\n435.\n\nBy way of a further example, Article VI(3) of the Czech-U.S. BIT provides:\n\n[E]*ither party to the dispute may institute* [arbitration] *provided:*\n\n*(i) the dispute has not been submitted... for resolution in accordance with any applicable previously agreed dispute-settlement procedures; and*\n\n*the* [investor] *has not brought the dispute before the courts of justice or administrative tribunals or agencies of competent jurisdiction of the* [host State]*.*\n\nThese are the standard formulations. They demonstrate how an effective fork in the road provision can be, and is, drafted.\n\n436.\n\nIn sum, Respondent\u2019s objection based on BIT Article 11(2) must be rejected. That having been decided, the Tribunal has no occasion to address Claimant\u2019s two further arguments, namely that the claims advanced by Claimant in the courts of Kosovo and the claims pursued here are not substantially the same, and that a \"fork in the road\" provision is not triggered if the forum first seized does not address and decide the claims before it on the merits.\n\n437.\n\nThus, under neither the BIT nor the 2014 Foreign Investment Law is an investor subject to an election of remedies requirement.\n\n***(3) Claimant failed to satisfy the BIT's and the Foreign Investment Law's requirement of prior consultation***\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n(a) Respondent\u2019s Position\n-------------------------\n\n438.\n\nRespondent observes that the BIT requires that, prior to initiating arbitration, an investor must engage in consultations with the host State with a view to achieving amicable settlement of the dispute. Articles 11(1) and (2) provide as follows:\n\n*(1)* [D]*isputes between an investor of a Contracting Party and the other Contracting Party regarding an investment of the former made in the territory of the latter, which are based on an alleged breach of obligations under this Agreement, shall be, to the extent possible, settled amicably through consultations by request in writing of either of the parties to the dispute.*\n\n*(2) If these consultations do not result in a solution within six months from the date of the written request for consultations, the investor may submit the dispute either to the courts or the administrative tribunals of the Contracting party concerned or to international arbitration.*\n\nRespondent lays emphasis on the word \"shall\" in paragraph 1.\n\n439.\n\nRespondent maintains that Claimant has not performed the above steps. It rejects Claimant\u2019s suggestion that it complied with the consultation requirement through its letters to the PAK of 23 February 2016475 and 30 March 2016.476 The first letter does not express a request for consultations, but rather an intention to bring a legal action. While the second letter does refer to amicable resolution of the dispute, it is insufficiently precise because it failed to specify that the dispute concerned a BIT-protected investment and an alleged breach of BIT obligations.477 Because Respondent's consent to arbitrate was conditioned on a claimant's satisfaction of the prior consultation requirement, and because Claimant did not satisfy that requirement, Respondent's offer was not accepted and no agreement to arbitrate came into existence.478\n\nExh. C-8: Request for amicable settlement of dispute, 23 February 2016.\n\nExh. C-9: Reminder, 30 March 2016.\n\nResp. Mem. on Jurisd., paras. 146-148.\n\nResp. Reply on Jurisd., para. 314.\n\n440.\n\nAny assertion by Claimant that recourse to prior consultation should not be required because it would have been futile should be rejected. A claim of futility in regard to satisfaction of a condition precedent must be supported by clear evidence, and in this case no evidence of futility was proffered, apart from Behgjet Pacolli's own statement in his interview with police investigators.479\n\nResp. Reply on Jurisd., paras. 315-318.\n\n(b) Claimant's Position\n-----------------------\n\n441.\n\nClaimant disagrees. It maintains, first, that prior consultation is not a jurisdictional requirement, but simply a procedural or at most an admissibility one.480 Thus, even if the requirement is not met, the Tribunal's jurisdiction is intact. Claimant also accuses Respondent of overlooking the phrase \"to the extent possible\" in Article 11(1).\n\nCl. Rejoinder on Jurisd., paras. 288-294 citing Exh. CL-42: *Wena Hotels Ltd. v.

United Republic of Tanzania,* ICSID Case No. ARB/05/22, Award, 24 July 2008, para. 343.\n\n442.\n\nMore to the point, Claimant maintains that the letters of 23 February 2016 and 30 March 2016 do satisfy the BIT's prior consultation requirement because they served the purpose of that requirement, which is to enable the parties to enter into negotiation over the dispute. In Claimant's view, both letters served that purpose.481 In its Rejoinder, Claimant adduced a third communication that, according to it, also satisfies the prior consultation requirement. Claimant maintains that its letter of 27 August 2012482 clearly represents a request for consultation, by stating the nature of the dispute, invoking BIT Article 11(1) and specifically referencing its grounds of complaint under the BIT.\n\nCl. Rejoinder on Jurisd., paras. 300-302.\n\nExh. C-75: Consultation Request, 27 August 2011.\n\n443.\n\nClaimant also suggests that, as awards have previously held,483 prior consultation is not required where resort to it would be futile. It would be futile, in Claimant\u2019s view, because the authorities of Respondent were engaged in \"serious high-level decision-making organized crime.\"484 Under these circumstances, further negotiations were pointless.\n\nClaimant cites the awards in Exh CL-15 : *Occidental Petroleum v.

Government of Canada,* UNCITRAL, Award on Jurisdiction, 24 June 1998, para. 84.\n\n(c) The Tribunal\u2019s Analysis and Findings\n----------------------------------------\n\n444.\n\nRespondent observes that the BIT, though not the Foreign Investment Law, requires that, prior to initiating arbitration, an investor engage in consultations with the host State with a view to achieving amicable settlement of their dispute. Article 11(1) provides as follows:\n\n[D]*isputes between an investor of a Contracting Party and the other Contracting Party regarding an investment of the former made in the territory of the latter, which are based on an alleged breach of obligations under this Agreement, shall be, to the extent possible, settled amicably through consultations by request in writing of either of the parties to the dispute.*\n\n445.\n\nRespondent alleges that Claimant failed to comply with the precondition set out in BIT Article 11(1). Claimant replies in part that the condition set out in Article 11(1) constitutes an admissibility rather than a jurisdictional objection and that, in any event, it is inoperative since efforts at amicable resolution of the dispute would have been futile. Should those arguments fail, Claimant contends that it did in fact do what Article 11(1) requires. The Tribunal can accept neither of these assertions. In its reading of the BIT, Kosovo\u2019s offer to arbitrate could not be accepted by Mabco until the stated consultations were held, or at least requested, and failed. The condition is therefore jurisdictional in nature. Nor can the Tribunal conclude that consultations would be futile. They might or might not have been futile, but Respondent has adduced no evidence to that effect.\n\n446.\n\nWhat remains then to be decided is whether Claimant did or did not satisfy the BIT\u2019s condition precedent. In maintaining that it did satisfy that requirement, Claimant relies on two communications from it to the PAK, those of 23 February 2016 and 30 March 2016.\n\n447.\n\nUpon a fair reading, the former communication cannot be regarded as a request for consultations. In that short communication, Claimant\u2019s attorney Gazmend Nushi simply wrote: \"I hereby notify [y]ou for the intention to file lawsuit against Privatization Agency of Kosovo in relation with the protection of infringed interests of \u2018Mabetex Group - Mabco Construction\u2019 in the process of privatization of NewCo \u2018Hoteli Grand\u2019 respectively on the occasion of withdrawal of shares of this enterprise by the Board of Directors of PAK.\"485 This communication reflects no interest on Claimant\u2019s part in engaging in further discussions with the PAK in connection with their dispute. It announces Claimant\u2019s readiness to bring suit and nothing more.\n\nExh. C-8: Request for amicable settlement of dispute, 23 February 2016.\n\n448.\n\nClaimant\u2019s 30 March 2016 communication to the PAK reads as follows:\n\n*Honorable President of Board of Directors,*\n\n*On 23 February 2016, in the capacity of authorized representative of \"Mabetex Group \u2014 Mabco Construction\", I have submitted a Requestfor amicable resolution of the disputes, registered with PAK with protocol number 1600.*\n\n*Through this submission, I would like to recall and reiterate that that \"Mabetex Group \u2014 Mabco Construction\" yet remains in the proposal filed by the Request of February 23rd 2016.*\n\n*I hope that the Board of Directors will consider this request by sending an invitation to the delegation of \"Mabetex Group \u2014 Mabco Construction\" for discussions in finding an amicable resolution of the disputes and thus preventing the initiation of respective legal proceedings.*486\n\nExh. C-9: Reminder, 30 March 2016.\n\n449.\n\nThe Tribunal finds that, unlike the 23 February 2016 communication, the 30 March 2016 communication does satisfy the BIT's requirement of prior consultation. The language solicits an invitation from the PAK for \"discussions in finding an amicable resolution of the disputes.\" The Tribunal finds that this expression of interest is sufficient to meet the BIT's requirement of prior consultation. Further, it cannot accept the suggestion that this communication bore no relation to the present dispute. That argument must fail, if for no other reason, because it refers back explicitly to the 23 February 2016 communication which in turn refers explicitly to the \"infringed interests of \u2018Mabetex Group - Mabco Construction' in the process of privatization of NewCo \u2018Hoteli Grand' respectively on the occasion of withdrawal of shares of this enterprise by the Board of Directors of PAK.\" That sufficiently identifies the dispute referenced in the 30 March 2016 communication.\n\n450.\n\nIn sum, Claimant has satisfied the prior consultation requirement set out in BIT Article 11(1).\n\n**E. THE TRIBUNAL LACKS JURISDICTION** ***RATIONE TEMPORIS***\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n451.\n\nRespondent also raises an objection *ratione temporis,* viz., that the BIT, by its terms applies to investments made prior to the BIT's entry into force, but that, according to Article 2, it does not apply \"to claims and disputes arising out of events which occurred prior to its entry into force.\"487\n\nExh.

Respondent describes the 31 May decision as \"final, binding and irreversible,\" in a word, definitive, all subsequent steps amounting to nothing more than formalities.491 Significantly, the measure that Mr. Pacolli challenged in the SCSC and in the Constitutional Court was the decision of 31 May 2012.492\n\nResp. post-hearing br., para. 102.\n\nResp.

Respondent cites, among other things, Selim Pacolli\u2019s 11 June 2012 letter to the PAK objecting to withdrawal of the shares.495\n\nResp. post-hearing br., para. 108.\n\nResp. post-hearing br., para. 112.\n\nResp. Reply on Jurisd., paras. 156-162.\n\n**(2)** ***Claimant's Position***\n---------------------------------\n\n454.\n\nClaimant insists that the present dispute arises out of events that postdate the BIT\u2019s entry into force.\n\n455.\n\nClaimant notes that, as early as its correspondence with the ICSID Secretariat before registration of the case, it stated that it only became aware of the withdrawal of shares on 14 June 2012, i.e., one day after the BIT entered into force, and its claim was therefore timely.\n\n456.\n\nClaimant disagrees that the dispute arose either on 16 December 2016 or 31 May 2012. In its view, the dispute did not arise either when the PAK decided to withdraw the shares or when it decided to execute the withdrawal. Neither of these decisions was a legally binding measure or was definitive. The measure challenged in this dispute is the actual withdrawal of the shares, not the prospect of it. The decisive event was the withdrawal itself, which occurred on 20 July 2012,496 after the BIT had gone into effect. Before that time, Claimant had suffered no losses.497 Had the withdrawal not actually been carried out, there would have been no dispute.498\n\nCl. Rejoinder on Jurisd., paras.305-311. Claimant also quotes from the PAK\u2019s letter of 17 July 2012 (Exh. C-41) stating that \"[w]e as an Agency have undertaken necessary legal actions to return the ownership of Grand Hotel and the same is now returned on the name of the Agency.\" Cl. post-hearing br., para. 36.\n\nCl. Rejoinder on Jurisd., paras. 309-310.\n\nCl. Rejoinder on Jurisd., para. 311. Claimant also observes that even after 31 May 2012, Claimant and the PAK continued to correspond concerning Claimant\u2019s request to have the withdrawal decision reversed. Cl. post-hearing br., para. 41.\n\n457.\n\nClaimant maintains that, in any event, Respondent\u2019s breach of its obligations was a continuing or composite one.499 The chain of events by which Respondent pursued its wrongful purpose may have begun prior to the date of entry into force of the BIT, but it did not crystallize and culminate in the deprivation of Claimant\u2019s rights until after that date. Withdrawal of the shares on 20 July 2012 was the decisive moment.500\n\nCl. post-hearing br., para. 44.\n\nCl. Rejoinder on Jurisd., paras. 312-315, citing Exh. CL-49: *Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale v. Dominican Republic,* UNCITRAL, LCIA Case No. UN 7927, Award on Preliminary Objections to Jurisdiction, 19 September 2008, paras. 87-88. See Cl. post-hearing br., paras. 35-36.\n\n458.\n\nClaimant observes that the Foreign Investment Law, unlike the BIT, contains no exclusion for disputes arising out of events prior to its enactment. Article 20 simply provides that \"the present law - and the rights, guarantees, privileges and protections established by the present law - shall apply equally to foreign investors that invested in the Republic of Kosovo prior to the effective date of this law.\"\n\n459.\n\nAt the very least, Claimant\u2019s denial of justice claim arose after the entry into force of the BIT.501 Claimant submitted its claim to the SCSC on 19 November 2012, many months after the BIT\u2019s entry into force, and the court never ruled on it and neither did the SCSC\u2019s Appellate Panel or, for that matter, the Constitutional Court. Accordingly, the courts of Respondent never afforded Claimant an opportunity to be heard. In sum, Claimant suffered a denial of justice, and it did so after, not before, the BIT came into effect.\n\nCl. Rejoinder on Jurisd., paras. 316-319. Cl. post-hearing br., para. 37.\n\n**(3)** ***The Tribunal's Analysis and Findings***\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n460.\n\nThe Tribunal notes at the outset that, unlike most BIT provisions to this general effect, Article 2 excludes claims arising out of \"events\" that occurred prior to the BIT's entry into force, rather than \"disputes\" occurring prior to the BIT's entry into force. This language suggests that the exclusion from coverage may start at an earlier point than the time at which the dispute as such emerged.\n\n461.\n\nThe 2005 Foreign Investment Law contains no such temporal limitation.502 However, even if it did, it would pose no impediment to the claims in the present case. The Foreign Investment Law dates back to 21 November 2005, effective April 2006. While Claimant made its contribution in 2006, it cannot be said that any of its claims arose before the 2005 Law came into force.\n\nBy contrast, the 2014 Foreign Investment law introduced a provision according to which \"[t]he present law - and the rights, guarantees, privileges and protections established by the present law - shall apply equally to foreign investors that invested in the Republic of Kosovo prior to the effective date of this law.\" (Exhs. C-18/R-19).\n\n462.\n\nAccordingly, we are concerned here solely with Mabco's BIT claims.\n\n463.\n\nIn applying BIT Article 2, and thereby determining when the operative events occurred, it is necessary to distinguish clearly among Mabco's various BIT claims. These are expropriation, denial of fair and equitable treatment and denial of justice.\n\n(a) Expropriation Claim\n-----------------------\n\n464.\n\nUnder Article 5(1) of the BIT:\n\n*Neither of the Contracting Parties shall take, either directly or indirectly, measures of expropriation, nationalization or any other measures having the same nature or the same effect against investments of investors of the other Contracting Party (hereinafter referred to as \"expropriation\") unless the measures are taken in the public interest, on a non-discriminatory basis and under due process of law, and provided that provisions be made for prompt, effective and adequate compensation. Such compensation shall be equivalent to the fair market value of the investment immediately before the expropriation occurred or became public knowledge, whichever is earlier, as determined in accordance with recognised principles of valuation.*\n\n465.\n\nBecause the relevant events in connection with Mabco\u2019s expropriation claim unfolded in steps over a substantial period of time, identifying the events out of which that claim arose is not an entirely straightforward matter. Assuming, as the parties do, that the operative event, in terms of appropriation, is the withdrawal of the shares, a number of dates present themselves for consideration. At numerous points in time between October and December 2011, the PAK indicated that it was seriously contemplating withdrawal of the shares. However, an actual decision to do so was not taken until 16 December 2011.503\n\nLluka witness stmt, para. 10.\n\n466.\n\nHowever, notwithstanding the 16 December 2011 decision, in the months that followed, Claimant and PAK engaged in a number of communications and meetings which gave the impression that that decision was not in fact definitive. The record indicates that the PAK invited Messrs. Pacolli, Berisha and Ejupi to a January 2012 meeting to discuss the matter and thereafter informed them that, subject to Claimant providing certain documentation and a bank guarantee, it would not withdraw the shares.504 There ensued a further meeting on 12 February 2012, following which Mr. Lluka informed Mr. Pacolli that the PAK Board would meet again on 12 March 2012 before making a final decision on the Grand Hotel on 15 March 2012.505 In the interim, the PAK received a second audit report on management of the Grand Hotel on 8 March 2012.506 Mr. Lluka himself testified that at the 15 March 2012 meeting, the PAK Board decided to suspend any withdrawal of the shares, due to the interest shown by potential investors, all of whom, including the Pacollis, the PAK viewed as new investors.507 PAK appears then to have postponed its decision on withdrawal of the shares that was initially scheduled for 15 March 2012.508 On 19 March 2012, the PAK contacted Selim Pacolli and Ms. Ejupi, requesting them to provide further information by 21 March 2012.509 In response, on 28 March 2012, UTC, NTSH and Mabetex Project Engineering submitted to the PAK the Annex Agreement that has been agreed upon by them,510 along with a Business Plan and Performance Guarantee.511 The last exchanges between Claimant and the PAK occurred in April 2012, during which, in Claimant\u2019s contention, the PAK reiterated its prior requests for a bribe.512 Under these circumstances, the Tribunal cannot conclude with confidence that the operative event was the decision of 16 December 2011.\n\nCl.

Counter-Mem. on Jurisd., paras. 65, 69-70.\n\n467.\n\nHowever, moving forward in time, it is uncontested that on 31 May 2012 the PAK took the official decision to order execution of the withdrawal of shares. Without doubt, the dispute itself, and not merely events leading up to it, had arisen by that time, which was some two weeks prior to the BIT\u2019s entry into force on 13 June 2012. The Tribunal cannot accept Claimant\u2019s suggestion that the operative date was 20 July 2012 (a date obviously well after entry into force of the BIT) when the withdrawal of shares was actually executed.513 The PAK\u2019s decision of 31 May 2012 was already sufficiently definitive.\n\nCl. Rejoinder on Jurisd., paras. 8, 310.\n\n468.\n\nThe Tribunal accordingly finds that, by virtue of BIT Article 2, it lacks jurisdiction over Mabco\u2019s expropriation claim *ratione temporis*.\n\n469.\n\nAs noted, the 2005 Foreign Investment Law contains no provision comparable to Article 2 of the BIT. There is therefore no reason, from a *ratione temporis* point of view, why Claimant\u2019s expropriation claim under the Foreign Investment Law cannot proceed.514\n\nThe provisions of the 2005 Foreign Investment Law most relevant to expropriation are these:  \n*Article 8*  \n*8.1. The items described in Article 7.1 shall also not be subject to any act of expropriation by or attributable to Kosovo.*  \n*8.2. Notwithstanding the prohibition contained in Article 8.1, Kosovo may take an act of expropriation affecting an asset of a foreign investor, foreign investment organization or foreign person, if the act of expropriation:*  \n*a. is for a clearly defined and legitimate public purpose;*  \n*b. is not inspired by any discriminatory objective;*  \n*c. is carried out in a non-discriminatory manner;*  \n*d. is carried out in accordance with due process of law; and*  \n*e. is accompanied by the prompt payment of adequate and effective compensation.*\n\n(b) Denial of Fair and Equitable Treatment Claim\n------------------------------------------------\n\n470.\n\nThe BIT's fair and equitable treatment clause, Article 4(1), reads as follows:\n\n*Each Contracting Party shall in its territory accord to investments and returns of investors of the other Contracting Party at all times fair and equitable treatment as well as full protection and security. Neither Contracting Party shall impair by unreasonable or discriminatory measures the management, maintenance, use, enjoyment, extension or disposal of such investments.*\n\n471.\n\nClaimant has not described in great detail what, apart from the alleged expropriation itself, might constitute a denial of fair and equitable treatment. However, under a fair reading of the pleadings, the purported unfairness and inequity appears to reside in the fact that, according to the Claimant, the PAK, directly or through intermediaries, required Claimant on more than one occasion to pay a bribe in order to have its ownership of the Grand Hotel shares registered, an allegation confirmed by Mr. Ejupi,515 and that the PAK ultimately withdrew the shares as a result of Claimant's refusal to pay any such bribe.516 Accordingly, the Tribunal understands Claimant's position to be that, even if the KTA's and PAK's actions and/or inactions are not found to constitute an expropriation, withdrawal of the shares due to Claimant's refusal to participate in the alleged bribes amounted to a denial of fair and equitable treatment.\n\nEjupi witness stmt, Exh. CWS-4, para. 19. See also Ejupi testimony, tr. 172:21-24: \"I had after, from the same agency, I had a visit in my home. They wanted that I pay \u20ac3.6 million a bribery if I want to have the shares. And I denied this, and I denounced the next day in EULEX.\"\n\nCl. Counter-Mem. on Jurisd., paras. 3, 31, 78. Claimant specifically maintains that if it had paid the bribes solicited of it, the PAK would have honored its commitment to register the shares. *Id.*, para. 79.\n\n472.\n\nAssuming that to be the essence of the asserted denial of fair and equitable treatment, the Tribunal\u2019s task in connection with Mabco\u2019s claim is, once again, to determine whether the events giving rise to that claim occurred before or after the date of the BIT\u2019s entry into force. According to Claimant, the PAK\u2019s attempts to bribe took place in the early months of 2012, well before the BIT came into effect. However, the Tribunal does not consider the alleged offers of a bribe to be the event that gave rise to Mabco\u2019s fair and equitable treatment claim. The event that gave rise to that claim would be PAK\u2019s alleged decision to withdraw the shares due to Claimant\u2019s refusal to be bribed. However, as already determined (paras. 464-468, *supra*), that event could have occurred as early as 16 December 2011 or as late as 31 May 2012. But, under either hypothesis, the event or events that gave rise to the dispute took place prior to the BIT\u2019s entry into force on 13 June 2012. Mabco\u2019s claim of denial of fair and equitable treatment under the BIT therefore also cannot proceed *ratione temporis*.\n\n473.\n\nOn the other hand, since the 2005 Foreign Investment Law, unlike the BIT, contains no limitation *ratione temporis,* Mabco\u2019s claim of unfair and inequitable treatment, absent any other jurisdictional barrier, may proceed.517\n\nThe most pertinent provision of the 2005 Foreign Investment Law on fair and equitable treatment is as follows:  \n*Article 3*  \n*3.1 Kosovo shall accord fair and equitable treatment to foreign investors and their investments in Kosovo. Kosovo shall also provide foreign investors and their investments with full and constant protection and security. In no case shall the treatment, protection or security required by this Article 3.1 be less favorable than that required by generally accepted norms international law or any provision of the present law.*\n\n(c) Denial of Justice Claim\n---------------------------\n\n474.\n\nFinally, Claimant states a denial of justice claim arising out of its treatment by the courts of Kosovo.518\n\nCl. Rejoinder on Jurisd., paras. 317, 324-327.\n\n475.\n\nThe BIT does not contain a freestanding denial of justice clause, but Article 5(2) does guarantee access to the courts of the host State in connection with an expropriation claim:\n\n[D]*ue process of law includes the right of an investor of a Contracting Party which claims to be affected by expropriation by the other Contracting Party to prompt review of its case, including the valuation of its investment and the payment of compensation in accordance with the provisions of this Article, by a judicial authority or another competent and independent authority of the latter Contracting Party.*\n\nAlso, even if Claimant does not prevail on its expropriation claim, it remains possible for it to pursue a denial of justice claim in connection with its allegations of denial of fair and equitable treatment.\n\n476.\n\nClaimant found itself in the courts of Kosovo at several intervals, some of them prior to the BIT\u2019s entry into forces, others sub sequent to it. Because the event out of which a denial of justice arises is the action or inaction, as the case may be, of a court, the Tribunal looks presumptively at the date on which Mabco\u2019s claims were definitively resolved.\n\n477.\n\nClaimant does not base its denial of justice claim on its 2007 litigation against UTC. The legal proceedings in the courts of Kosovo of which Claimant complains and that might potentially give rise to a denial of justice claim on Mabco\u2019s part include the following:\n\na. the June 2012 action by UTC against the PAK in the Supreme Court of Kosovo,519 in connection with which Claimant and NTSH sought to intervene, a request that the SCSC\u2019s Appellate Panel denied on 26 June 2014;\n\nb. the action in the SCSC that Claimant and NTSH brought on 19 November 2012 for annulment of the PAK\u2019s decision,520 which was dismissed by an undated judgment as time-barred;521 and\n\nc. the constitutional complaint filed by Claimant and NTSH on 17 November 2014 which the Constitution Court dismissed as inadmissible.522 In either event, since the courts in these proceedings only disposed of Mabco's claims definitively after the entry into force of the BIT on 14 June 2012, they are subject to it.\n\nExh. R-5 : SCSC Decision (C-I-12-0042), 20 March 2013.\n\nFile reference C-I-12-0056.\n\nExh. R-8: SCSC Decision (C-I-12-0056), 15 May 2003.\n\nExh. R-9 : Constitutional Court of Kosovo, Resolution of Inadmissibility, 28 August 2015, Case No. K1168/14, p. 9; Cl. Counter-Mem. on Jurisd., para. 92.\n\n478.\n\nAs concerns Mabco's denial of justice claims under the Foreign Investment Law, since the acts upon which those claims are based arose after the entry into force of the 2014 Law on 24 January 2014, they are subject to that law rather than the 2005 law. Though the 2014 Law does not specifically identify denial ofjustice as a cognizable claim, Article 8, paras. 1 and 3, guarantee due process of law. Also, as under the BIT, protection against denial of justice may conceivably be read into and pursued under the rubric of the 2014 Law's guarantee of fair and equitable treatment.\n\n479.\n\nAccordingly, the claims that Mabco attributes to the judgments in these proceedings fall within this Tribunal's jurisdiction *ratio temporis,* and are to be considered under both the BIT and the 2014 Foreign Investment Law.\n\n**F. THE CLAIM FALLS OUTSIDE THE SCOPE AND PURPOSE OF THE ICSID CONVENTION**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n480.\n\nRespondent's next argument pertains to the ICSID Convention only, and neither the BIT nor the Foreign investment Law. It maintains that the claim advanced here falls outside the scope and purpose of the ICSID Convention in two respects:\n\n(1) The claim is at variance with the purposes of the ICSID Convention.\n\n(2) Mr. Pacolli's involvement in this proceeding constitutes double-hatting and is procedurally unfair.\n\n***(1) The claim is at variance with the purposes of the ICSID Convention***\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n(a) Respondent's Position\n-------------------------\n\n481.\n\nRespondent points out that the very first letters sent to the PAK in which Mabco was identified as the alleged owner of the shares were dated June 2012, immediately after the BIT between Switzerland and Kosovo went into effect.523 The suggestion is that Mr. Pacolli acted in bad faith by transforming a claim that he had all along advanced in his own name into a claim purportedly belonging to Claimant purely to take advantage of the BIT.524 This amounts to an abuse of process.525\n\nResp. oral argum., tr. 23:17 - 23:25.\n\nResp. Reply on Jurisd., para. 406; Resp. oral argum., tr. 14:10 - 14:14.\n\nResp.

Its submission of the present dispute is in every respect legitimate and conforms to the requirements and purposes of the BIT, the Foreign Investment Law and the ICSID Convention. Citing arbitral jurisprudence,527 Claimant underscores the heavy burden that a party bears in establishing an abuse of process on the part of its opponent.528 It contends that Respondent \"has not even come close\" to discharging that burden.529\n\nSee, e.g., Exh. CL-18: *Chevron Corp. & Texaco Petroleum Corporation. v. the Republic of Ecuador,* UNCITRAL, PCA Case No. 2009-23, Interim Award, 1 December 2008, para. 146.\n\nCl. Rejoinder on Jurisd., para. 237.\n\nCl. Counter-Mem. on Jurisd., para. 192.\n\n(c) The Tribunal\u2019s Analysis and findings\n----------------------------------------\n\n484.\n\nAny argument that Mr. Pacolli acted in bad faith by transforming a personal claim of his into a claim purportedly belonging to Claimant, purely to take advantage of the BIT, naturally presupposes that, prior to the BIT\u2019s entry into force, the claim belonged only to Mr. Pacolli, and not to Claimant. The Tribunal has already determined (paras. 339-345, *supra*) that, despite the fact that he signed the great majority of documents and communications in his own name, Mr. Pacolli was at all times acting in a representative capacity on behalf of Claimant. To the extent that the basis for Respondent\u2019s assertion that the Tribunal\u2019s entertainment of the claims in this case does not comport with the ICSID Convention\u2019s purposes is that any investment that was made was made by Mr. Pacolli and not Claimant, Respondent\u2019s assertion must fail.\n\n485.\n\nIt seems to the Tribunal likely that Respondent also considers it contrary to the purposes of the ICSID Convention for a member of the government of a host State to assert claims, through a controlled foreign company, against his own government. That question is taken up more directly in the next section.\n\n**(2)** ***Mr. Pacolli's involvement in this proceeding constitutes double-hatting and is procedirally unfair***\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n(a) Respondent\u2019s Position\n-------------------------\n\n486.\n\nAccording to Respondent, the Tribunal must not entertain a claim by an individual against the very government of which he or she is a member, which is the situation in the present case. Admittedly, parties are generally free to structure their investments so as to avail themselves of a BIT from which they would otherwise not benefit. Nor is a minister generally barred from asserting an international claim against his or her own government through a foreign-incorporated company. However, since Claimant is not a \"real foreign investor, its initiation of this arbitration represents an abuse of process.\"530\n\nResp. Mem. on Jurisd., paras. 152-155.\n\n487.\n\nAlso, Mr. Pacolli, as a member of the Government of Kosovo, would have access to documents and other information, including confidential information, that a party does not ordinarily enjoy vis-\u00e0-vis its opponent in an adversarial proceeding.531 Mr. Pacolli, again as Government member, would also participate in decisions the Respondent will take in this proceeding, including even the decision to advance payment to ICSID of the costs of the arbitration that Mr. Pacolli has himself brought. The situation represents a form of double-hatting.532\n\nResp. Mem. on Jurisd., para. 157; Resp. Reply on Jurisd., para. 409.\n\nResp. Mem. on Jurisd., paras. 156-158.\n\n(b) Claimant's Position\n-----------------------\n\n488.\n\nClaimant rejects the notion that Mr. Pacolli's involvement in this proceeding constitutes double-hatting. In its view, Respondent once again fails to distinguish between Claimant, a juridical person, and its owner, Mr. Pacolli, a natural person. A foreign corporate investor is not defined in terms of its owner, even a controlling owner. According to Claimant, there is neither in the text nor the purpose of the ICSID Convention any basis for denying protection to a foreign investor on account of the fact that its owner is a member of the host State's government.533\n\nCl. Counter-Mem. on Jurisd., para. 188.\n\n489.\n\nClaimant views the notion that Mr. Pacolli would be in a position to weaken or damage the Government's case before this Tribunal as implausible. Mr. Pacolli, being Foreign Minister would have no access to the files and records of the Ministry of Justice, which is handling this case.534 Moreover, on any occasion in which the present dispute would be the subject of discussion or decision within the Government, Mr. Pacolli would be required to recuse himself.535 More generally, Claimant posits that the very situation giving rise to the dispute demonstrates that Mr. Pacolli's position in the Government did not enable him to exert influence over the actions of the PAK.\n\nBehgjet Pacolli witness stmt, Exh. CWS-1, para. 16.\n\nBehgjet Pacolli witness stmt, Exh. CWS-1, para. 16.\n\n(c) The Tribunal's Analysis and Findings\n----------------------------------------\n\na. May a member of the government of a host State maintain a claim against that State under a BIT or the Foreign Investment Law?\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n490.\n\nThe question thus raised assumes, by definition, that the claim in question belongs to and is being asserted by a member of the host State's government. That cannot be said to be the case here. The Tribunal has already concluded that the putative investor is Mabco, not Mr. Pacolli. That Mr. Pacolli owns and controls Claimant is of no consequence, at least as long as the Claimant is not a \"shell company\" or otherwise purely fictional. Claimant, which is duly incorporated in Switzerland and conducts its business there (see paras. 395-396, *supra*), is entitled to be treated as a separate juridical entity. This would hardly be the first instance of an investor-State claim properly brought by a foreign company owned and controlled by a national of the host State.536\n\nSee, e.g., Exh. CL-11: *Tokios Tokeles v. Ukraine,* Decision on Jurisdiction, 29 April 2004, para. 56; *Waguih Elie George Siag and Clorinda Vecchi v. The Arab Republic of Egypt,* ICSID Case No. ARB/05/15, Decision on Jurisdiction, 11 April 2007, para. 210*.*  \nVandevelde writes:  \n*Host-state investors potentially may... obtain BIT protection for their investment in their own country. These investors may incorporate a company under the laws of the other BIT party and place ownership of their domestic investment in that company. In the event that their government wrongfully injures their investment, they can direct the company of the other BIT party that owns the investment to submit a claim to investor-state arbitration against their own government for a violation of the BIT.*  \nVandevelde, *supra* note 450, at pp. 162-163.\n\n491.\n\nIs the situation altered in any way by the fact that the Claimant is not only a national of the host State, but also a member of its government? (It will be recalled, *supra* para. 150, that, at the time arbitration was initiated, Mr. Pacolli was First Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs of Kosovo.) Although this scenario is highly unusual, possibly unprecedented, the Tribunal sees no basis for treating a national of a host state any differently on account of the fact that he or she is a member of that State\u2019s government. Neither the BIT nor the Foreign Investment Law, nor any case law of which the Tribunal is aware, lends any support for a \"carve-out\" of this sort. The fact is that Mr. Pacolli was a businessman at the same time as he held public office. He was entitled, as a businessman legitimately operating through a foreign company, to the same protections as are available to any other businessman.\n\nb. Would Mr. Pacolli\u2019s involvement in this proceeding constitute impermissible \"double-hatting\" or otherwise be procedurally unfair?\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n492.\n\nThe Tribunal cannot subscribe to the notion that Mr. Pacolli\u2019s involvement in the present case constitutes \"double-hatting.\" The term \"double-hatting\" is customarily used to denote the situation in which an individual sitting as arbitrator in one case is acting at the same time as advocate in another case and, more particularly, may be tempted to take positions in his or her capacity as arbitrator that are designed to advance his or her case as advocate. This is not an apt way of characterizing Mr. Pacolli\u2019s posture in the present case. Mr. Pacolli is performing no adjudicatory function whatsoever. As Claimant\u2019s owner and chief executive, his sole interest is advancement of Claimant\u2019s case.\n\n493.\n\nAs for due process, the possibility cannot be excluded that Mr. Pacolli, and therefore Claimant, possesses government documents, or access to government documents, of assistance to Claimant that claimants in investor-State arbitration ordinarily do not have. In the Tribunal\u2019s judgment, however, this eventuality cannot bar the foreign company that he owns from availing itself either of a BIT between the two countries or of the host-State\u2019s foreign investment law. It is not at all uncommon, in private litigation, for an officer of a company to bring an action against that company and, in such capacity, similarly enjoy access to documents and other information that some other claimant against that company would not enjoy. To the Tribunal\u2019s knowledge, it has never been held or even maintained, that an officer of a company is on that basis disqualified from pursuing a claim against that company that he or she would otherwise be in a position to pursue.\n\n494.\n\nNor does the Tribunal see how Respondent could be unfairly disadvantaged in this proceeding by the fact that its opponent is or was owned by a member of Respondent\u2019s government. Respondent has ample means at its disposal, including removing Mr. Pacolli from any discussions of the dispute within the government, to arrange its defense so as to prevent Mr. Pacolli from interfering with or undermining it. Arguably, Claimant\u2019s felt need to institute these proceedings suggests that he does not have undue influence over the Government.\n\n**G. CLAIMANT HAS FAILED TO ESTABLISH A** ***PRIMA FACIE*** **CAUSE OF ACTION**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**(1)** ***Respondent's Position***\n-----------------------------------\n\n495.\n\nLastly, Respondent maintains that Claimant\u2019s Request for Arbitration, First Clarification Submission and Counter-Memorial, taken together, fail to present a *prima facie* case on the merits.537 It is neither a precise nor a coherent exposition of the claim, including the basis for alleging breaches of the BIT\u2019s and the Foreign Investment Law\u2019s standards of protection. The claim is also insufficiently documented. In Respondent's view, if Claimant has any cause of action at all, it is a purely private cause of action against UTC and/or Mr. Berisha.538\n\nResp. oral argum., tr. 24:16 - 25:3.\n\nResp. Reply on Jurisd., paras. 392-397.\n\n496.\n\nIn this connection, Respondent denies that any acts of extortion occurred, invoking in support of that contention, the police investigation and decision not to prosecute. It even denies that the so-called intermediaries (paras. 200, 471, *supra*) were ever affiliated with or acted on behalf of the PAK.539\n\nResp. Reply on Jurisd., paras. 398-400.\n\n**(2)** ***Claimant's Position***\n---------------------------------\n\n497.\n\nClaimant asserts that, on the facts as presented, it has established a *prima facie* case. It has demonstrated that Respondent expropriated its property without compensation in violation of Article 5(1) of the BIT and denied Claimant fair and equitable treatment in violation of Articles 4(1) and 4(2) of the BIT. It also committed a denial of justice in violation of Article 5(2) of the BIT.\n\n498.\n\nFurther, Respondent has committed numerous breaches of its obligations under the Kosovo Foreign Investment Law, including violation of fair and equitable treatment and national treatment (Articles. 3 and 4); disappointment of investors' good faith reliance on the validity of host State law (Articles. 5(1) and 5(2)); and uncompensated expropriation (Article 7).\n\n499.\n\nAs for the suggestion that Claimant's action should be directed to UTC rather than the Respondent, Claimant's counsel disagrees, arguing that the violation essentially consisted of Respondent's refusal to register Claimant's shares of stock in the Grand Hotel and its withdrawal of the shares.540\n\nCl. Answ. to Trib. Q., tr. 55:24 - 56:1.\n\n**(3)** ***The Tribunal's Analysis and Findings***\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n500.\n\nAs noted (para. 36, *supra*), on 22 December 2018, Respondent filed a preliminary objection to the claim under Rule 41(5) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules on grounds of \"manifest lack of legal merit,\" an objection that the Tribunal rejected on 7 February 2019. The Tribunal now has the benefit of the Parties' successive pleadings in this case as well as the documentary and testimonial evidence they have adduced. In assessing whether Claimant has established, with respect to its expropriation claim, a *prima facie* case - which of course is a measurably higher standard than \"manifest lack of legal merit\" - the Tribunal recalls that Claimant's position in this proceeding is best understood as a claim of *entitlement* to the Grand Hotel shares. Thus, it is not necessary at this stage for Claimant to prove ownership. What Claimant must establish is that it has a colourable claim of entitlement to those shares.\n\n501.\n\nFor reasons set out earlier in this Decision (see paras. 293-338, *supra*), the Tribunal finds that Claimant has established a credible claim to the entitlement that it asserts in this proceeding. While Mabco could have presented its claim more coherently than it did, its showing is sufficient to defeat Respondent's argument that Claimant has failed to establish a *prima facie* case of expropriation.\n\n502.\n\nIt remains to determine whether Claimant has also made a *prima facie* case in support of its claims of denial of fair and equitable treatment under the Foreign Investment Law and denial of justice under the BIT and/or the Foreign Investment Law. As noted earlier (para. 471, *supra*), putting its expropriation claim to one side, Mabco's claim that Respondent denied it fair and equitable treatment rests essentially on the claim that the PAK withdrew the shares to which Mabco claims entitlement on account of the fact that Mabco refused to pay a bribe. An official police report of 22 August 2012 records an affirmation by Mr. Pacolli of PAK authorities asking for bribes in exchange for registration of the shares, and the truth of that affirmation is attested to both Selim Pacolli and Mr. Ejupi.541 Respondent denies that any attempts at a bribe occurred, but given Mr. Pacolli's affirmation to the authorities that such attempts occurred and Mr. Selim Pacolli\u2019s and Mr. Ejupi\u2019s confirmation of that allegation, the Tribunal is reluctant to conclude that Claimant\u2019s assertion that Respondent violated its obligation of fair and equitable treatment has, for jurisdictional purposes, no reasonable basis.\n\nExh. C-30: Official Memorandum of the Republic of Kosovo, Ministry of Internal Affairs, Police General Directorate, Crimes Investigation Directorate, 22 August 2012.\n\n503.\n\nMabco\u2019s claim of denial of justice is considerably less well-developed. As best the Tribunal can tell, Claimant does not object to the SCSC\u2019s ruling that the claim brought before it by Claimant and NTSH was time-barred under the applicable limitations period. Claimant does, however, object to the SCSC Appellate Panel\u2019s rejection of Claimant\u2019s and NTSH\u2019s petition to intervene in UTC\u2019s action against the PAK, as impermissibly based on the rationale that UTC and the PAK objected to their intervention. Claimant also objects to the Constitutional Court\u2019s dismissal of its and NTSH\u2019s complaint alleging violation by the PAK of both the Constitution of Kosovo and the BIT on the basis of its claimed lack of competence to examine the compatibility of national law with international agreements.542 The Tribunal is not in a particularly good position to gauge the strength of Mabco\u2019s claim of denial of justice on these bases. However, Claimant has stated its strong objections, in terms of principle, to the Appellate Panel\u2019s and the Constitutional Court\u2019s rulings, as well as their basis - objections that Respondent has not yet addressed. Largely, on that basis the Tribunal concludes that Mabco\u2019s claims of denial of justice cannot be dismissed at this stage.\n\nExh.

CONCLUSION**\n-----------------\n\n504.\n\nIn this Decision, the Tribunal has examined each of the jurisdictional objections raised by Respondent. It has determined (a) that the claims advanced in this arbitration arise out of or relate to an investment in Kosovo, (b) that Claimant is a foreign investor, (c) that Claimant\u2019s alleged ownership interest in shares of Grand Hotel LLC is a protected investment, (d) that Respondent consented to arbitrate the present dispute, insofar as Claimant was not subject to an election of remedies requirement and satisfied the BIT\u2019s requirement of prior consultation, (e) that the Tribunal has jurisdiction *ratione temporis* over Mabco's denial of justice claim under the BIT and over its claims of expropriation, denial of fair and equitable treatment and denial of justice under the applicable Foreign Investment Law, (f) that the claims are within the scope and purpose of the ICSID Convention, and (g) Claimant has established a *prima facie* case for its expropriation, denial of fair and equitable treatment and denial of justice claims in this case.\n\n**VI. COSTS**\n-------------\n\n**A. CLAIMANT\u2019S COST SUBMISSIONS**\n----------------------------------\n\n505.\n\nIn its submission on costs, Claimant argues that Respondent \"shall be ordered to reimburse the Claimant for its payment of the advances in the amount of USD 137'500,\" and that, \"[i]n an award all costs incurred, CHF 509'907.15 and USD 300'000.00 and EUR 5'394.00, in relation to the jurisdictional phase of the proceedings shall be borne by the Respondent.\" Claimant also maintained its prayers for relief as stated in its post-hearing brief.\n\n506.\n\nClaimant's legal fees and expenses totalling CHF 500,907.15, EUR 5,394 and USD 300,000, were broken down as follows:\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Legal representation fee | CHF 495,347.15 |\n| Travel costs | CHF 5,660.00. |\n|  | EUR 5,394.00. |\n| Hotel fees and advances paid | USD 300,000. |\n| Total | CHF 500,907.15 |\n|  | EUR 5,394.00. |\n|  | USD 300,000. |\n\n507.\n\nClaimant makes it claim on the basis that all costs of the jurisdictional phase are solely due to the Respondent\u2019s meritless objections. It also argues that the length of the jurisdictional proceedings and the costs thereby incurred are solely due to the Respondent\u2019s conduct. Claimant refers to Respondent\u2019s failure to pay its share of the advance on costs, which resulted in the proceedings being stayed for more than six months, and Respondent\u2019s requests for extension of time to file its submissions.543\n\nClaimant\u2019s Submission on Costs, 24 February 2020.\n\n**B. RESPONDENT\u2019S COST SUBMISSIONS**\n------------------------------------\n\n508.\n\nIn its submission on costs, Respondent submits that the Tribunal should order Claimant to pay the Respondent\u2019s full costs and expenses associated with defending against Claimant\u2019s claims including, in addition to the costs of the arbitrators and ICSID, the costs and expenses for legal representation and of the Respondent\u2019s own officials and witnesses in an amount of EUR 505,433.36, together with interest thereon at a reasonable rate.\n\n509.\n\nThe Respondent\u2019s legal fees and expenses totalling EUR 505,433.36 were broken down as follows:\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Legal representation fee | EUR 490,000. |\n| Counsel expenses | EUR 7,390.73 |\n| Respondent\u2019s own expenses | EUR 4,388.24 |\n| Expenses of Mr. Shala | EUR 3,654.39 |\n| Total | EUR 505,433.36 |\n\n510.\n\nRespondent argues that when a claimant\u2019s claims are rejected for lack of jurisdiction, numerous tribunals have followed the principle of \"loser pays\" or \"costs follow the event\". It also argues that Claimant\u2019s claims are frivolous and abusive, and that Claimant should be ordered to pay the costs occasioned by its faulty conduct in the proceedings, including the postponement of the hearing and unnecessary procedural correspondence.544\n\nRespondent\u2019s Submission on Costs, 24 February 2020.\n\n**C. THE TRIBUNAL\u2019S DECISION ON COSTS**\n---------------------------------------\n\n511.\n\nArticle 61(2) of the ICSID Convention provides:\n\n*In the case of arbitration proceedings the Tribunal shall, except as the parties otherwise agree, assess the expenses incurred by the parties in connection with the proceedings, and shall decide how and by whom those expenses, the fees and expenses of the members of the Tribunal and the charges for the use of the facilities of the Centre shall be paid. Such decision shall form part of the award.*\n\n512.\n\nThis provision gives the Tribunal discretion to allocate all costs of the arbitration, including attorney\u2019s fees and other costs, between the Parties as it deems appropriate.\n\n513.\n\nBecause the Tribunal rejects Respondent\u2019s jurisdictional objections and this proceeding shall continue into a merits phase, it defers a decision on cost allocation to a future date.\n\n**VII. DECISION**\n-----------------\n\n514.\n\nFor the reasons set forth above,\n\n(1) the Tribunal decides that Respondent\u2019s jurisdictional objections *ratione temporis* to Claimant\u2019s expropriation and fair and equitable claims under the BIT are upheld, but its jurisdictional objections to Claimant\u2019s denial of justice claim under the BIT is rejected.\n\n(2) the Tribunal decides that Respondent\u2019s jurisdictional objections *ratione temporis* to Claimant\u2019s expropriation, fair and equitable claim and denial of justice claims under the Foreign Investment Law are rejected.\n\n(3) the Tribunal by majority rejects Respondent's jurisdictional objections *ratione materiae* and *ratione personae*.\n\n(4) the Tribunal rejects all of the Respondent's other jurisdictional objections.\n\n(5) defers decision on allocation of costs to a later date."}]}
