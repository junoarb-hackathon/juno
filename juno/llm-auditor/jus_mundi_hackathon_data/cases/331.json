Santivong, LS Horizon, Vientiane, Lao PDR\n\n1.\n\nThis is an Application for Provisional Measures brought by the Claimant, Lao Holdings N.V., a national of Aruba, Netherlands (the \"Claimant\"), in an arbitration initiated against the Respondent, the Government of the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (\"Lao PDR\" or simply the \"Respondent\") by Notice of Arbitration dated 14 August 2012. The Notice was delivered pursuant to Articles 2 and 3 of the Arbitration Rules (Additional Facility) of the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (the \"ICSID-AF Rules\"). The Claimant relies in particular on Articles 9 and 14 of the *Agreement on Encouragement and Reciprocal Protection of Investments* between the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (PDR) and the Kingdom of the Netherlands (\"the Investment Treaty\").\n\n2.\n\nIn brief, the Claimant asserts a claim to \"no less than US$400 million\" invested in gambling and tourism facilities located in the Lao PDR said to be at risk by acts of the Respondent for the benefit of itself and certain Lao nationals. The Claimant says it has made direct investments of over US$85 million through Sanum Investments Limited (\"Sanum\"), a Laotian company wholly owned by the Claimant since 17 January 2012.\n\n3.\n\nThe investments at issue in this Arbitration include at various locations in the Lao PDR:\n\n(i) The Savan Vegas Casino, a large luxury hotel, spa and conference center with extensive gambling facilities;\n\n(ii) A number of slot machine facilities at Thanaleng, Lao Bao, and the Savannakhet Ferry Terminal.\n\n4.\n\nThe essence of the Claimant\u2019s allegations are set out at paragraph 41 of its Amended Notice of Arbitration, dated 22 May 2012, as follows:\n\nSanum\u2019s present dilemma is a classic case of the foreign investor being lured into establishing profitable investments in the territory of a host State, with promises of fair and equitable treatment, vouchsafed by the rule of law and personal assurances from high government officials. After the foreign investor has risked its capital and developed an important new economic resource for the country - here tourism - it is suddenly and arbitrarily stripped of all of its rights and entitlements in the investment enterprise by the government of the host State, either directly or by abetting the seizure of its investments by the favored local entrepreneur under color of domestic law.\n\n5.\n\nThe Claimant says it owns other investments in the Lao PDR that have allegedly been subject to similar hostile acts by the Respondent, but they are the subject of a separate, parallel UNCITRAL arbitration, and are not before this Tribunal.\n\n**The Application for Provisional Measures**\n--------------------------------------------\n\n6.\n\nPursuant to Article 46 of the ICSID-AF Rules, the Claimant initiated a Request for Provisional Measures on 19 April 2013, as amended on 28 May 2013, to preserve what it considered to be the *status quo ante* pending resolution of the Arbitration, to prevent further aggravation of the dispute, and ultimately, to enable the Tribunal to grant effective relief in any final award in favour of the Claimant.\n\n*(a) Allegations against the Respondent*\n----------------------------------------\n\n7.\n\nIn general terms, the Claimant alleges the following conduct against the Respondent, which the Claimant says violates the Investment Treaty:\n\n(1) The initial term of the Savan Vegas Flat Tax Agreement (\"FTA\") is to expire at the end of 2013. Savan Vegas will become subject to an 80% casino tax beginning 1 January 2014 if its FTA is not extended. Savan Vegas has attempted unsuccessfully to negotiate the terms of an extension, which it says is required by the Lao Government\u2019s prior assurances, but the Lao Government refuses even to discuss a renewed FTA on any terms. Without an FTA, Savan Vegas says it would also be subject to a 10% Value Added Tax (\"VAT\"), meaning that 90% of its gaming revenues (not just profits) would be taxed. No other casino in Lao, the Claimant says, faces the threat of these prohibitive taxes, which, according to it, will force Savan Vegas to shut down.\n\n(2) On 26 April 2012, the Office of Economic Dispute Resolution, which reports to the Respondent\u2019s Minister of Justice, purported to order without notice the removal of slot machines from the Thanaleng Club.\n\n(3) On 26 July 2012, during proceedings in a private litigation with ST, its Laotian partner in Sanum, before the Laotian People\u2019s Court, the Claimant says Sanum was served with a Seizure Order issued by the court the previous day, which sequestered and/or froze some of Sanum\u2019s bank accounts. Sanum says it had no notice that such an Order was being considered, much less that it had already been decided before any trial had begun. Execution of the Court\u2019s Order was made upon several of the banks at which Sanum held accounts in U.S. dollars, Thai baht, and Lao kip.\n\n(4) Further, the Claimant says, the Laotian People\u2019s Court authorized cancellation of all contracts with Sanum regarding the Thanaleng Club - imposing a loss for Sanum of more than US$220 million (later amended to US$416 million). The Court also awarded damages to its Laotian partner, in addition to imposing a penalty on Sanum, payable to the Respondent government in the amount of 2% of the amount of Sanum\u2019s (denied) counterclaims. This penalty amounts to approximately US$5 million.\n\n(5) On or about 28 June 2012, following what the Claimant contends was a flawed and biased audit, the Lao PDR central government issued three notices and demands for payment against Sanum concerning three tax debts, alleged to be owed by the Lao fiscal authorities (including penalties and interest). These tax demands were denominated, respectively, as a \"construction tax,\" a \"brokerage tax,\" and \"overtime charges,\" totaling US$23,759,229. The Claimant disputes the demands.\n\n8.\n\nThe Claimant contends that if the Lao PDR enforces its New 80% Tax Law and 10% VAT against Savan Vegas, or takes enforcement action based on taxes recently levied against the Lao Bao and Ferry Terminal slot clubs, it will significantly aggravate the dispute, impair the rights Lao Holdings seeks to rely upon and vindicate through this arbitration, and interfere with the Tribunal\u2019s ability to grant effective relief should Lao Holdings ultimately prevail on the merits.\n\n*(b) Provisional Measures sought by Claimant*\n---------------------------------------------\n\n9.\n\nThe Claimant seeks the following Provisional Measures to remain in force during the pendency of this proceeding:\n\n(1) An order enjoining the Lao Government from (a) demanding that Claimant pay any amounts allegedly due pursuant to the New Tax Law; and (b) instituting or further pursuing any action, judicial or otherwise, to collect any payments Respondent claims are owed by Claimant pursuant to the New Tax Law, *or, in the alternative,* ordering that the terms of the existing FTA remain in force;\n\n(2) An order enjoining the Lao PDR from taking any enforcement action, judicial or otherwise, to seize or interfere in the operations of the Lao Bao and Ferry Terminal slot clubs based on any disputed tax amounts;\n\n(3) An order enjoining the Lao PDR from taking any action, judicial or otherwise, to freeze or seize funds that Claimant or its related entities place in accounts in the Lao banking system; and\n\n(4) An order enjoining the Lao PDR from taking any steps that would alter the *status quo ante,* aggravate the dispute or render ineffective any ultimate relief that this Tribunal may award. (Claimant\u2019s Amended Application for Provisional Measures, para 17)\n\n**The Tribunal\u2019s Authority to Grant Provisional Measures**\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n10.\n\nThe parties agree that the Tribunal has the authority under Article 46 of the ICSID-AF Rules to grant Provisional Measures. That provision states: \"... either party may at any time during the proceeding request that provisional measures for the preservation of its rights be ordered by the Tribunal.\"1 The Investment Treaty does not place any restrictions on the parties\u2019 right to seek Provisional Measures.2\n\nSee also Article 47 of the ICSID Convention, which provides as follows:  \n Except as the parties otherwise agree, the Tribunal may, if it considers that the circumstances so require, recommend any provisional measures which should be taken to preserve the respective rights of either party.\n\nSee generally, Loretta Malintoppi *Provisional Measures in Recent ICSID Proceedings: What Parties Request and What Tribunals Order* published as Chapter 11 in International Investment Law for the 21st Century. Essays in Honour of Christoph Schreuer,\n\n11.\n\nThe general principle governing the grant of Provisional Measures was expressed in the following terms in *Tokios Tokel\u00e9s v. Ukraine,* Case No. ARB/02/18, Order No. 1, para 2 (ICSID, 1 July 2003):\n\n... parties to a dispute over which ICSID has jurisdiction must refrain from any measure capable of having a prejudicial effect on the rendering or implementation of an eventual ICSID award or decision, and in general refrain from any action of any kind which might aggravate or extend the dispute or render its resolution more difficult.\n\n12.\n\nThe parties also agree on the elements required to be established by a claimant to obtain an order for Provisional Measures, namely, (1) *prima facie* jurisdiction; (2) *prima facie* establishment of the right to the relief sought; (3) urgency; (4) imminent danger of serious prejudice (necessity); and (5) proportionality, (see, e.g. *Paushok et al. v. The Government of Mongolia,* Order on Interim Measures (UNCITRAL, 2 September 2008), para 45).\n\n*(a) With Respect to Prima Facie Jurisdiction*\n----------------------------------------------\n\n13.\n\nThe Claimant, incorporated on 11 January 2011 in Aruba is a national of the Netherlands for purposes of the Investment Treaty, which includes \"legal persons constituted under the law of [a] Contracting Party.\" The Respondent accepts that the Claimant\u2019s indirect ownership of 80% of Savan Vegas, through its 100% ownership interest in Sanum, constitutes an investment under the Investment Treaty, as does its indirect interest in the Lao Bao and Ferry Terminal slot clubs.\n\n14.\n\nIt should be noted that while existence of jurisdiction *prima facie* is not contested for the purposes of the Provisional Measures Application, jurisdiction is a live issue in respect of the Arbitration on the merits, and will be dealt with at a later date by the Tribunal in a bifurcated hearing, as ordered in Procedural Order No. 2 issued subsequent to this Order.\n\n*(b) With Respect to Whether the Claimant Has Established a Right to the Relief Sought*\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n15.\n\nThe parties agree that for the purpose of Provisional Measures\n\n[T]he Tribunal need not go beyond whether a reasonable case has been made which, if the facts alleged are proven, might possibly lead the Tribunal to the conclusion that an award could be made in favor of the Claimants. Essentially, the Tribunal needs to decide only that the claims made are not, on their face, frivolous or obviously outside the competence of the Tribunal.\n\n(See, *Paushok,* para 55, and *City Oriente Limited v. Ecuador and Empresa Estatal Petr\u00f3leos del Ecuador (PetroEcuador),* Case No. ARB/06/21, Revocation Decision, para 20 (ICSID, 13 May 2008) (\"the party requesting the measure need only prove that its claim has the appearance of good right, *fumus boni iuris,* or, in other words, the petitioner must prove that the rights invoked are plausible\").\n\n16.\n\nWhile the Respondent contends that the documentation relied upon by the Claimant to claim renewal of the FTA, shows that it is entitled to no more than an unenforceable \"agreement to agree,\" the ICSID tribunal stated in *Victor Pey Casado* that:\n\nThe right to be preserved only has to be asserted as a theoretically existing right, as opposed to proven to exist in fact. The Tribunal, at the provisional measures stage, will only deal with the nature of the right claimed, not with its existence or the merits of the allegations of its violation.3\n\nChittharanjan F. Amerasinghe, *Jurisdition of Specific International Tribunals,* referring to *Victor Pey Casado Fondation Pr\u00e9sident Allende v. Republic of Chile* ICSID Case No. ARB/98/2, D\u00e9cision sur les mesures conservatoires sollicit\u00e9es par les parties, 25 September 2001.\n\n17.\n\nThe Respondent\u2019s Counter Memorial is not due to be submitted until 29 October 2013. The Respondent has not at this stage filed any evidence to refute the allegations of unfair and discriminatory conduct made in the Claimant\u2019s Application for Provisional Measures. In these circumstances, the Tribunal accepts that the combined operation of the new tax of 80% on revenue (not profit) to which will be added 10% VAT as of 1 January 2014, the as yet uncontested evidence of government seizure of bank accounts, and various other administrative actions taken or threatened against Lao Bao and Ferry Terminal slot clubs, has sufficiently established, in the absence of any evidence from the Respondent to the contrary, the \"right to relief\u2019 within the scope of the ICSID jurisprudence on Provisional Measures.\n\n*(c) The Requirement of Urgency*\n--------------------------------\n\n18.\n\nArticle 46 of the ICSID-AF Rules does not specify the degree of urgency required to grant Provisional Measures. However, the tribunal in *Azuriz v. Argentina* associated urgency with the notion of imminence of the damage, in the following terms: \"... given that the purpose of the measures is to preserve the rights of the parties, the urgency is related to the imminent possibility that the rights of a party be prejudiced before the tribunal has rendered its award.\"4\n\n*Azurix v. Argentina* ICSID Case No. ARB/01/12, Decision on Provisional Measures, 6 August 2003, para 33, in Christoph H. Schreuer, The ICSID Convention: A Commentary, 2nd edition, p. 776\n\n19.\n\nThe Tribunal\u2019s attention was drawn to the view expressed by the *City Oriente* tribunal (which held that a provisional measures order was urgent, notwithstanding the fact that claimant was unlikely to have to pay the tax at issue for a year or more):\n\n[P]rovisional measures [are] indeed urgent, precisely to keep the enforced collection or termination proceedings from being started, as this operates as a pressuring mechanism, aggravates and extends the dispute and, by itself, impairs the rights which claimant seeks to protect through this arbitration. *(City Oriente Limited v. Ecuador and Empresa Estatal Petr\u00f3leos del Ecuador (PetroEcuador),* Case No. ARB/06/21, Decision on Provisional Measures, para 55 (ICSID, 19 November 2007).\n\n20.\n\nIn the Tribunal\u2019s view, the Claimant has established \"urgency\" for the purpose of its Provisional Measures Application.\n\n*(d) With Respect to the Requirement of Necessity*\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n21.\n\nThe Tribunal is of the view that the increase in tax from the current $745,120 *per annum* under the FTA presently in effect, to a tax of 80% of revenue which in 2013 is estimated to be about $61 million (see Exhibit C-296) plus 10% VAT, and the other actions said to be taken (and not yet disputed by evidence from the Respondent) would, if implemented, have a destructive effect on the Claimant\u2019s investments not adequately reparable by an award of damages *(**Paushok* paras 68-69). On the facts of this case, necessity is derived from the principle (not disputed by the Respondent) that neither party may aggravate or extend the dispute *(City Oriente* para 10).\n\n*(e) Proportionality*\n---------------------\n\n22.\n\nThe real battleground in this Application for Provisional Measures is the fourth element, namely proportionality. The *Paushok* tribunal noted, under this branch of the analysis, that the Tribunal is \"called upon to weigh the balance of inconvenience in the imposition of interim measures upon the parties\" (para 79).\n\n23.\n\nThe Claimant contends that the harm it will suffer if the requested Provisional Measures are denied will substantially outweigh any harm (which it says is non-existent) to the Respondent if the Provisional Measures are granted. The Claimant says:\n\nIf Respondent seizes Savan Vegas\u2019s bank accounts, equipment, property and other assets under the pretext of forcible collection pursuant to the New Tax Law or otherwise, Savan Vegas cannot operate and will be put out of business. Likewise, enforcement actions by Respondent against the Lao Bao and Ferry Terminal slot clubs would compromise their ability to continue to operate. Under such circumstances, the Tribunal would not be able to restore Lao Holdings, or Savan Vegas, to their original positions should Claimant prevail on the merits. (Claimant\u2019s Amended Application for Provisional Measures, dated 28 May 2013, para 115)\n\n24.\n\nThe Claimant further emphasizes that its \"hard assets\" in the Lao PDR are sufficient to secure any monies which the Respondent, if it succeeds in the Arbitration, will be entitled to collect. *(City Oriente* para 59). In other words, if the Respondent were to prevail on the merits, it would be able without difficulty to obtain payment of the full amount owing to it.\n\n25.\n\nAs stated, the Respondent has submitted no evidence of harm if the Provisional Measures are granted. However, it objects on the ground that, if granted, the Provisional Measures would be an unacceptable interference with the \"sovereign taxing power\" of the Lao PDR.\n\n26.\n\nIn the Tribunal\u2019s view, the balance of convenience in this case, on the present record, favours the Claimant. Nevertheless, there are countervailing circumstances. Proportionality also favours recognition of the legitimate demand of the Respondent that taxes payable by reason of the exercise of its \"sovereign taxing authority\" be respected. The Claimant continues to do business in the Lao PDR. It benefits from the infrastructure provided. It continues to exploit commercial opportunities which, but for the Respondent, would not exist. There is no reason why the Claimant should be granted, on an interim basis, the full measure of tax relief it would obtain if successful in the Arbitration itself.\n\n27.\n\nIn its Rejoinder dated 23 August 2013 to the Claimant\u2019s Request for Provisional Measures, the Respondent stated:\n\nIn a spirit of compromise solely for the purposes of the request for provisional measures, the Respondent will agree to collect taxes after 31 December 2013, the time when the flat tax agreement expires, at the rates specified for gaming operations and all businesses in the tax code that existed until the new tax code became effective (the prior tax code). Claimant should have no objection as it negotiated a five year flat tax agreement in 2008 and had to expect to be subject to the existing tax code on its expiration on 31 December 2013. These taxes in amounts to be determined under the **rates of the prior tax code** will be due and payable each month, (p 2. Emphasis added)\n\n28.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that according to the Claimant\u2019s own financial analysis (Exhibit C-296), the application of the pre-2014 rate \"for gaming operations and other business\" to the (anticipated) 2013 financial results for Savan Vegas would yield an income tax liability of Savan Vegas of approximately US$10,303,920.\n\n29.\n\nThe Tribunal concludes that a balanced outcome in relation to Provisional Measures on the tax issue would be to reduce the sum of US$10,303,920 by fifty (50) percent, (being $5,151,960) having regard in particular to the Claimant\u2019s immoveable \"hard assets\" located in the Lao PDR. Accordingly, the Tribunal orders the payment by the Claimant into an escrow account in a bank in Singapore (or elsewhere by agreement of the parties) of an amount equal to one-twelfth of US$5,151,960, being US$429,330 on the first day of each and every month beginning 1 January 2014 and thereafter until the present Arbitration is concluded by settlement or final award.\n\n**Disposition**\n---------------\n\n30.\n\nThe Tribunal takes careful note that in its Counter-Memorial on Provisional Measures the Respondent stated that it was willing \" to allow Claimant to pay the taxes that are due for the operation of the Ferry Terminal slot club and the Savan Vegas excise tax that will become due in January 2014 by placing the amounts due every month in an international escrow account under the control of the Tribunal\" and that the Respondent was further willing to refrain from \"steps to collect the tax assessments made against Sanum after the 2012 audit or the court fee arising out of the ST Group/Sanum litigation while the arbitration is pending.\" Having regard to the Respondent's concessions, and based on the analysis set out above, the Tribunal considers that a fair and balanced disposition of the application for Provisional Measures, is that during the pendency of this proceeding the Tribunal pursuant to ICSID-AF Rule 46,\n\n(1) enjoins the Lao Government from (a) demanding that Claimant pay any amounts allegedly due pursuant to the New Tax Law; and (b) instituting or further pursuing any action, judicial or otherwise, to collect any payments Respondent claims are owed by Claimant pursuant to the New Tax Law;\n\n(2) enjoins the Lao PDR from taking any enforcement action, judicial or otherwise, to seize or interfere in the operations of the Lao Bao and Ferry Terminal slot clubs based on any disputed tax amounts;\n\n(3) enjoins the Lao PDR from taking any action, judicial or otherwise, to freeze or seize funds that Claimant or its related entities place in accounts in the Lao banking system; and\n\n(4) these orders are under the condition that the Claimant deposits in an escrow account at a Singapore bank or other bank satisfactory to the parties under arrangements negotiated by the parties and approved by the Tribunal, the amount of US$429,330 on the first day of each month commencing 1 January 2014.\n\n(5) enjoins both parties from taking any steps that would alter the *statu* *quo ante,* or aggravate the dispute.\n\n31.\n\nThe costs of this Application are reserved for the consideration of the Tribunal at the conclusion of the Arbitration."}, {"Title": "Decision on Jurisdiction", "Type": "Jurisdiction", "Date": "2014-02-21T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Decision on Jurisdiction\n------------------------\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| Frequently Used Abbreviations and Acronyms |\n| ICSID-AF Rules | Arbitration Rules (Additional Facility) of the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes |\n| BIT or Treaty | *Agreement on Encouragement and Reciprocal Protection of Investments* between the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (PDR) and the Kingdom of the Netherlands |\n| ICSID Convention | Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes Between States and Nationals of Other States dated March 18, 1965 |\n| ICSID or the Centre | International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes |\n\n**I. INTRODUCTION AND PARTIES**\n-------------------------------\n\n1.\n\nThis case concerns a dispute submitted to the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (\"ICSID\" or the \"Centre\") on the basis of the *Agreement on Encouragement and Reciprocal Protection of Investments* between the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (PDR) and the Kingdom of the Netherlands (the \"BIT\" or the \"Treaty\"), which entered into force on 1 May 2005, and the Arbitration Rules (Additional Facility) of the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes, which entered into force on 10 April 2006 (the \"ICSID-AF Rules\"). The dispute relates to actions by the Respondent the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, hereinafter referred to as the \"Lao Government\", \"Laos\" or the \"Respondent,\" that allegedly deprived Claimant of part or all of its investment in the gaming and tourism industry in Lao PDR.\n\n2.\n\nThe Claimant, Lao Holdings N. V., is a company incorporated under the laws of Aruba, The Netherlands Antilles, and is hereinafter referred to as \"Lao Holdings\" or the \"Claimant.\" It is important to emphasize at the outset that the Claimant did not become an investor in Laos until 17 January 2012 (\"the critical date\") at which time it took over ownership of Sanum Investments Ltd., a Macao company, whose principals are John Baldwin and Sean Scott, and which had been investing in Laos since 2007.\n\n3.\n\nThe present ruling concerns an objection by the Respondent to the jurisdiction of the Tribunal *ratione temporis* to hear and determine the Claimant\u2019s assertion that by reason of the protection of the Treaty it is not subject to a New Tax Code enacted on 11 December 2011.\n\n4.\n\nThe Claimant and the Respondent are hereinafter collectively referred to as the \"Parties.\" Their respective representatives and addresses are listed on page (2).\n\n**II. ICSID PROCEDURAL HISTORY**\n--------------------------------\n\n5.\n\nOn 15 August 2012, ICSID received a Request for Arbitration dated 14 August 2012 from the Claimant against the Respondent, the Lao Government.\n\n6.\n\nOn 12 September 2012, the Secretary-General of ICSID registered the Request in accordance with Articles 4 and 5 of the ICSID-AF Rules and notified the Parties of the registration. In the Notice of Registration, the Secretary-General invited the Parties to proceed to constitute an Arbitral Tribunal as soon as possible, in accordance with Article 5(e) of the ICSID-AF Rules.\n\n7.\n\nIn accordance with Chapter III of the ICSID-AF Rules, the Parties agreed that the Arbitral Tribunal would be composed of three arbitrators, one to be appointed by each Party and the third presiding arbitrator to be appointed by agreement of the Parties. Professor Bernard Hanotiau, a national of Belgium, was appointed by the Claimant; and Professor Brigitte Stem, a national of France, was appointed by the Respondent.1 On 22 March 2013, the Parties agreed to the appointment of The Honourable Ian Binnie, a national of Canada, as President of the Tribunal, who accepted the appointment on 23 March 2013. On 26 March 2013, the Secretary-General, in accordance with Article 13(1) of the ICSID-AF Rules, notified the Parties that all three arbitrators had accepted their appointments and that the Tribunal was therefore deemed to have been constituted on that date.\n\nOn 27 February 2013, the Centre sought acceptance from Claimant and Respondent\u2019s appointees Professor Bernard Hanotiau and Professor Brigitte Stem as arbitrators. Prof. Stem accepted her appointment on 27 February 2013. Prof. Hanotiau accepted his appointed on 4 March 2013.\n\n8.\n\nMrs. Anneliese Fleckenstein, ICSID Legal Counsel, was designated to serve as Secretary of the Tribunal.\n\n9.\n\nThe Tribunal held a first session with the Parties on 8 May 2013, in London. The Parties confirmed that the Members of the Tribunal had been validly appointed. It was agreed inter alia that the applicable ICSID-AF Arbitration Rules would be those in effect from 10 April 2006, and that the procedural language would be English. The Tribunal decided, on the application of the Parties, that the place of the proceedings would be Singapore. The Parties agreed on a schedule for the proceedings, including production of documents, and the terms were embodied in Procedural Order No. 1 signed by the President of the Tribunal and circulated to the Parties on 18 June 2013.2\n\nAs agreed at the first session and subsequent modifications, the procedural schedule for the Claimant\u2019s provisional measures application was as follows: the Claimant filed an amendment to its request for arbitration including the request for provisional measures on 28 May 2013; the Respondent filed its response on 12 July 2013; the Claimant filed its reply on 2 August 2013; the Respondent filed its rejoinder on 23 August 2013. The procedural schedule for the jurisdiction and merits phase was agreed as follows: the Claimant shall file its memorial on the merits on 22 July 2013; the Respondent shall file its counter-memorial on the merits and its objections to jurisdiction on 22 October 2013; the Claimant shall file its reply on the merits and counter-memorial on the objections to jurisdiction on 22 January 2014; the Respondent shall file its rejoinder on the merits and reply on jurisdiction on 22 April 2014.\n\n10.\n\nOn 12 July 2013, the Respondent informed the Tribunal that it would seek bifurcation of the proceeding. On 2 August 2013, the Claimant objected to the Respondent\u2019s request.\n\n11.\n\nA hearing on the Claimant\u2019s amended request for provisional measures and the Respondent\u2019s request for bifurcation took place in London on 2 September 2013.

The Factual Background to the Dispute**\n--------------------------------------------\n\n15.\n\nSanum was incorporated in Macau in 2005 to invest in gambling operations in Asia. In 2007, as a result of investigations and inquiries by Mr. John Baldwin, Sanum entered into agreements with ST Corporation, a Laotian company with numerous commercial interests in that country, including potentially valuable government concessions for hotel and casino projects. According to Mr. Baldwin, one of the attractions of ST as a business partner was that it was reputed to be well connected to the Lao Government. The attraction for ST was that Sanum had access to ample foreign funds to invest.\n\n16.\n\nSanum agreed to establish a joint venture with ST in a series of Laotian hotel and gambling facilities. Sanum contends that its contribution was more than US$85 million.\n\n17.\n\nRelations between Sanum and ST were governed by a Master Agreement dated 30 May 2007 which resulted in three major projects, The Savan Vegas Hotel and Casino (\"Savan Vegas\"), The Paksong Vegas Hotel and Casino (\"Paksong Vegas\") and a third enterprise that invested in slot machine clubs in at least three locations in Lao, namely Thanaleng, Lao Bao and the Ferry Terminal.\n\n18.\n\nSanum and ST each owned 40% of Savan Vegas and Paksong Vegas, with the Lao Government owning the remaining 20%.\n\n19.\n\nA separate dispute involving Paksong Vegas is being determined by another arbitral tribunal. It is not before this Tribunal.\n\n20.\n\nThe ownership structure of the slot clubs was more complicated and contested, but the details are not germane to the present Jurisdictional Objection.\n\n21.\n\nThe Sanum investments did not acquire Dutch nationality for purposes of the Treaty until 17 January 2012, when the Claimant was incorporated in Aruba, in The Netherlands Antilles.\n\n**B. The Five Year Flat Tax Agreement**\n---------------------------------------\n\n22.\n\nAs part of the Lao Government\u2019s investment incentive program, and in recognition of its limited capacity to engage in tax audits of a complex cash based business, the Lao Government granted Savan Vegas a five year Flat Tax Agreement (\"FTA\") dated 1 September 2009, that required it to pay $745,000 per year in taxes each year through 31 December 2013. The Claimant says that it was promised that when the FTA expired on 31 December 2013, it would be replaced by another flat tax agreement, ideally for the remainder of the 50-year concession. The terms (and in particular the tax rate) were to depend on negotiations arising out of the experience of the initial five year period. As set out below in greater detail, Sanum initiated negotiations for a new flat tax arrangement in March 2011 (which it said was necessary to attract further foreign long term financing for investments). However, for reasons and in circumstances that are contested in this proceeding, the Lao Government declined to enter into a renewal of the FTA.\n\n23.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, responsible Laotian government officials induced Savan Vegas to believe (and the Savan Vegas management says it did believe so up until March 2012 and beyond) that the FTA in some form would be renewed. The New Tax Code was, it says, not a matter of \"legal dispute\" within the terms of Article 9 of the Treaty until at least March 2012, when negotiations broke down more than two months after the critical date [17 January 2012] of the acquisition of the investment by the investor of Dutch nationality.\n\n24.\n\nThe Lao Government says the failure of the Flat Tax negotiations was complete, and must have been obvious to Savan Vegas to be a complete failure no later than November 2011, when the Flat Tax negotiations had clearly been rejected (and the rejection confirmed) by the Laotian Finance Minister. If Savan Vegas or its investors thought the Lao Government breached any *contractual* right to a renewal, any such contract dispute \"crystallized\" no later than December 2011 when Sanum received notice of the Finance Minister\u2019s decision. (The Claimant disavows any contractual claim as relevant to the present jurisdictional objection.)\n\n25.\n\nThe Lao Government\u2019s position is that the FTA extension negotiations and any \"legal dispute\" over the application of the New Tax Code are inextricably linked. At whatever point the negotiations for a new flat tax agreement failed (which is a major point of disagreement), the New Tax Code would apply as a matter of law to Savan Vegas. Any \"legal dispute\" in respect of the New Tax Code therefore crystallized concurrently with the end of the Flat Tax negotiations which occurred, in the Lao Government\u2019s view, well before the critical date of 17 January 2012. The Claimant therefore has no claim to Treaty protection in respect of the New Tax Code, and this Tribunal has no jurisdiction *ratione temporis* to hear such a dispute.\n\n**C. The New Tax Code**\n-----------------------\n\n26.\n\nOn 20 December 2011, the Laotian legislature enacted a casino tax of 80% of casino revenues (not profits). The Claimant contends, and the Lao Government denies, that Sanum was repeatedly assured by high Lao Government officials that this Act was never intended to apply to Savan Vegas. The purpose of the casino tax, the Claimant says it was assured by high ranking Laotian officials, was to discourage new entrants into the Laotian gambling industry, not to penalize established businesses, such as Savan Vegas.\n\n27.\n\nThe Lao Government, for its part, points out that the New Tax Code makes no exception for Savan Vegas. The New Tax Code, as an exercise of its sovereign power, applies to Savan Vegas according to its terms. Its potential application was known (and disputed) by Sanum and its principals before the Treaty became applicable to the Parties. That is why Sanum was anxious to obtain the FTA extension. The \"legal dispute\" therefore predated the entry into force of the Treaty between the Parties.\n\n28.\n\nThe Claimant responds that as the Flat Tax negotiations were continuing up to and including March 2012, neither Savan Vegas nor its investors, Sanum and the Claimant, had any reason to believe that there was any prospect of the application of the \"confiscatory\" casino tax of 80%, plus 10% VAT, to them. They had been assured otherwise. There was therefore no legal dispute capable of giving rise to a Treaty claim prior to the acquisition of Dutch nationality in Aruba on 17 January 2012 by the investor.\n\n**D. Relations Deteriorate Between Sanum and ST (its Laotian Co-venturer)**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n29.\n\nIn the fall of 2011, relations between Sanum and ST deteriorated sharply. It is the Claimant\u2019s position in this arbitration that the Respondent, the Lao Government, took active steps to advance ST\u2019s interest at Sanum\u2019s expense, including complicity in the closure of the Thanaleng Slot Club and the sequestration of Sanum\u2019s slot machines. The position taken by the Claimant in its Notice of Arbitration dated 14 August 2012 was as follows:\n\n42. Here ST has played the role of favored local, while members of the Respondent\u2019s justice, culture and revenue ministries, along with its courts and even the Prime Minister\u2019s Office, have shared the role of abettor and expropriator. Indeed, Sanum\u2019s story may have been worse, given its discovery of how the President of ST, Sithat Xaysoulivong and the Vice President of the Republic, Bounnhang Vorachith, are indaws. [Its] officials are actually related as family to one and possibly more of the very Government officials who have been orchestrating the steady erosion of Sanum\u2019s rights and assets within the Lao PDR.\n\nIn this context, the Claimant alleges an array of measures initiated by the Lao Government beginning in April 2012, including what the Claimant regards as unfair and oppressive audits of Savan Vegas, resulting in tax claims which the Claimant says are invalid but, being unpaid, led to the freezing of Sanum\u2019s bank accounts in Laos. The series of Lao Government measures, the Claimant says, was calculated to deprive Sanum of its investment in Laos. The application of the New Tax Code rate of 80% on revenue is part and parcel of the Lao Government\u2019s continuing policy of discrimination and oppression, the Claimant says.\n\n30.\n\nThe Respondent, for its part, says that Sanum had for years been operating its gambling operations using impenetrable accounting procedures, and in some respects, illegally, making it impossible for the Lao Government to assess their real profitability (and thus, perhaps, to settle on a realistic rate of \"Flat Tax\" for the future). As counsel for the Lao Government put it at the 6 January 2014 hearing:\n\n[The Claimants] decided, for their own reasons, that they would put all their money into Thailand; well, they had been putting their money in Thailand for the last five years. And it is illegal, it is against the law in Laos for any Lao corporation to have a bank account outside the country, and they had seven bank accounts outside the country for the last five years. We can tell from some of the documents we received from Ernst & Young that in one of those bank accounts in 2011, a year before the \"freezing order\", they put $11 million into a Thai bank account. That\u2019s against the law. (Transcript, pages 19-20).\n\n31.\n\nThese extracts provide the flavour of the broader dispute, and the facts will have to be decided in due course, but, for the purposes of the Lao Government\u2019s objection to jurisdiction, the only facts that have to be determined are those that relate to the existence and timing of the legal dispute in relation to the application of the New Tax Code to the Claimant\u2019s investments.\n\n**E. Public Meetings and Discussion about Amendments to the Tax Code**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n32.\n\nThe Lao Government insists, but the Claimant denies, that by the spring of 2011 Sanum must have been aware of proposed amendments to the Tax Code that would increase the tax rate applicable to casinos not covered by an FTA.\n\n33.\n\nIn April 2011, the Tax Department sent invitations to the largest businesses in Laos to attend a seminar/public meeting to discuss potential changes to the Tax Code.3 The seminar/public meeting actually took place on 11 May 2011 and was attended by approximately 300 people. The handouts included a list of proposed new rates - the excise rate for gaming revenues was proposed to be raised to 25%.\n\nExhibit RE-01, \u00b6 6.\n\n34.\n\nMs. Manivone Insisiengmai, Director of the Laotian Tax Department, was the keynote speaker. Time was made available for questions and public comment.\n\n35.\n\nThe Lao Government says that Sanum and Savan Vegas were invited to the meeting, but cannot state for a fact whether they attended the meeting.4\n\nExhibit RE-04.\n\n36.\n\nOn 20 June 2011, DFDL, a regional law firm with an office in Vientiane, held a seminar to provide information to about 100 clients and potential clients about the proposed New Tax Code, and about investment treaties more generally. The Claimant says that Sanum was not a DFDL client at the time, had no notice of the meeting and did not attend it.\n\n37.\n\nIn June 2011, at its semi-annual meeting, the Laotian National Assembly proposed to amend the excise tax to increase the rate on gambling revenue to 60%. The amendment was not adopted into law. However, the existence of this proposal was publicly known. The next session of the Laotian National Assembly was to be held in December 2011.5\n\nExhibit RE-01, \u00b6 9.\n\n38.\n\nThe Claimant says any public discussion of changes to the tax code was not of interest to Sanum or Savan Vegas, which expected to sign a new Flat Tax Agreement.\n\n**F. Negotiations for a Renewal of the Sanum FTA**\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n39.\n\nAs stated earlier, the FTA between \"the Tax Department\" and Sanum covers the 5 year period beginning, January 2009 and provides in Article 5 as follows:\n\nThe duration of this contract is for the period of 5 (five) years and valid starting from 01 January 2009 up to 31 December 2013. The lump sum payment of tax is considered as a trial for the first 5 year period, in case of business growth and income has been increased on the basis of certified existing data, the two Parties will discuss for further improvement of the contract as to comply with the real income of the business and the amount of tax payment will be reconsidered. (Emphasis added)\n\n40.\n\nThe Claimant says the FTA was not envisaged as a one-time arrangement, but as a 5-year \"trial\" contemplating \"further *improvement* [not termination] of the contract\" when \"the amount of tax payment will be reconsidered.\"\n\n**G. Government Notice 1121**\n-----------------------------\n\n41.\n\nOn 10 June 2011, the Lao Government Secretariat in the Prime Minister\u2019s office issued what the Respondent calls a \"decision,\" No. 1121 (\"Notice 1121\"),6 which refers to the Sanum FTA and the \"trial period\" and then states the following:\n\n... After the end of the trial period, the Parties shall comply with principle as prescribed in the main agreement and the laws. \" (Emphasis added)\n\nExhibit RE-05\n\n42.\n\nThe Lao Government says Notice 1121 manifested a decision that Savan Vegas\u2019s FTA would not be extended after the trial period of five years. It says that \"most\" of the subsequent documents passing between the Parties and within the Lao Government dealt with Sanum\u2019s unsuccessful efforts to have this 10 June 2011 decision reversed.7 The Claimant says document 1121 is not, and does not pretend to be, a \"decision.\" The operative part of document 1121 (at least in the English translation) is ambiguous. The reference to \"the principle as prescribed in the main agreement\" could be taken as referring to the renewal negotiations explicitly contemplated in Article 5 of the FTA. Moreover, it seems to misstate the content of Sanum\u2019s then current FTA.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Objection, \u00b629.\n\n43.\n\nWhen Sanum received a copy of document 1121 on 16 July 2011, the Claimant says it did not understand it to be a \"decision.\" Discussions with the Lao Government continued in respect of the proposed renewal of the FTA.\n\n**H. The Sequel to Notice 1121**\n--------------------------------\n\n44.\n\nOn 20 June and 22 June 2011, the Ministry of Planning and Investment invited several Ministries and Departments, including the Tax Department of the Ministry of Finance, to a meeting with Sanum. The meeting was called \"in light of the Notice No. 1121 of June 10, 2011.\"\n\n45.\n\nOn 26 July 2011, Sanum itself asked for a meeting with the Tax Department of the Ministry of Finance to discuss the FTA, \"following the Notification from the Government\u2019s Secretariat No. 1121, dated 10 June 2011.\"8\n\nExhibit RE-09.\n\n46.\n\nOn 4 August 2011, Ms. Manivone addressed a memo to the Minister of Finance recommending that the Minister seek guidance from the Prime Minister\u2019s office on extending the Sanum FTA. Referring to Notice 1121, she stated the Tax Department\u2019s position that the FTA should be extended because the Tax Department lacked the capacity to audit a gambling casino and because two other casinos in Laos had FTAs.9 Ms. Manivone\u2019s 4 August 2011 memorandum to the Minister of Finance states in part in the English translation as follows:\n\nIn response to the request from Savan Vegas and Casino Ltd., the Tax Department is of the view that:\n\n1. For Casino and slot machine businesses, the company shall pay Lump Sum Tax as we lack experience in the management and control of this kind of business. If the company is requested to pay taxes according to its accounting holding, the collection of the revenue might be less than lump sum. Like LaoYuan Ltd., as mentioned above, casino business is a form of gambling business that uses cash and does not provide receipts as evidence for accounting controls and it is easy for tax evasion.\n\nFor other businesses (besides casino) the taxes shall be paid according to the accounting holding...\n\n2. With regard to the request from Savan Vegas for Lump Sum Tax, **we agree with the request but we are of the view that the period for Lump Sum is too long and we cannot make precise predictions for the future.**\n\n3. This request is made in a context of business extension with the investment in hotel construction which has reached an advanced stage and will continue to move ahead. For that reason, the Company is requesting to pay more taxes than it used to do in the past but we are of the view that the taxes are still not high enough. Therefore, **the Tax Department suggests that, every 5 years, we should ask for 5% more of what the company is proposing** but the amount should be close to the amount of taxes paid by other companies to the Government with the following breakdown:\n\n*[breakdown set out in Exhibit RE-05 omitted]*\n\nWith respect to the request from the company, an **advice from the Prime Minister should be sought** for his further consideration and actions based on the attached report.\n\nThis report has been prepared for your information and further guidance.\n\nDirector General of Tax Department\n\nMs. Manivone Insisiengmai (Emphasis added)\n\nExhibit RE-10.\n\n47.\n\nOn 5 August 2011, Mr. Baldwin, Mr. Jordahl (then a Sanum VP, and a lawyer) and others from Sanum met with Ms. Manivone and her staff. Ms. Manivone reported that she and the Tax Department found Notice 1121 to have misconceived at least in part the arrangements with Sanum. The Tax Department supported the extension of Sanum\u2019s FTA on adjusted terms. Mr. Baldwin was given a copy of the 4 August 2011 memo (supra). The FTA recommendation is recorded on 16 August 2011 in the minutes prepared by Ms. Manivone of the meeting of 5 August 2011.10\n\nExhibit RE-11.\n\n48.\n\nOn 23 August 2011, Ms. Manivone wrote to the Minister of Finance to \"report on the meeting with Savan Vegas to discuss about the directive of the Government Secretariat pursuant to the Notification No. 1121.\" After reciting the tax arrangements with other casinos in Laos, Ms. Manivone states:\n\nThe tax officers do not have experience in the audit and cannot identify the source of revenue and expenses of this particular type of business.\n\n[T]o ensure uniformity throughout the country all casinos are subject to FTA because we have no experience. **Therefore we propose that the FTA be extended.** (Emphasis added)11\n\nExhibit RE-12.\n\n**I. Incorporation of the Claimant in Aruba, The Netherlands Antilles**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n49.\n\nOn 17 July 2011, Mr. Richard Pipes, Vice President of Sanum, recommended to John Baldwin, the CEO, that Sanum undertake a corporate restructuring under a Dutch entity to take advantage of the Dutch/Lao Bilateral Investment Treaty (\"BIT\") (Pipes II, para. 7). The Aruba company would become the new owner of Sanum and acquire 100% of Sanum\u2019s Lao investment.\n\n50.\n\nThe reorganization proceeded at a leisurely pace. On 29 December 2011, the Sanum organization sent to IMC in Aruba a payment of $5,995 to establish Lao Holdings.12\n\nExhibit RE-16.\n\n51.\n\nOn 17 January 2012, IMC used an off the rack company named Mula Blou Holdings N.V., to form Lao Holdings N.V. in Aruba.13\n\nExhibit RE-18.\n\n52.\n\nThe Respondent says that Sanum did not inform the Lao Government Ministry of Finance or the Prime Minister\u2019s office that it had created a Netherlands company to acquire Sanum\u2019s investments.\n\n**J. The Minister of Finance Rejects Renewal of the Savan Vegas FTA in Document0772**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n53.\n\nOn 24 August 2011, the Minister of Finance informed Ms. Manivone that the Tax Department should hire an expert to advise it on how to audit and tax a casino operation.14\n\nExhibits RE-01, \u00b6 18; RE-12, notes.\n\n54.\n\nOn 14 September 2011, the Tax Department published a new draft of the proposed revision of the Tax Code based upon the proposal of the Laotian National Assembly in its June session to raise the excise tax for casinos to 60% of revenue.15\n\nExhibit RE-13.\n\n55.\n\n**On 28 November 2011, Ms. Manivone sent Sanum a one page letter stating that the Minister of Finance would not approve the extension of the FTA, but that when the present agreement expired on 31 December 2013, \"Savan Vegas and Casino Co. Ltd. are to pay tax duties according to the regulated law on tax.\"16** However, the Lao Government acknowledged that any disposition of the Sanum application would be subject to the approval of the Prime Minister\u2019s office.17\n\nExhibit RE-14. The Ministry of Finance stated as follows:  \n Department of Tax hereby informs you regarding the Flat Tax Payment of Savan Vegas and Casino Co., Ltd. As follows:  \n 1. Authorize Savan Vegas and Casino Co., Ltd. to act according to Agreement on Flat Tax Payment until expiration (until 31/12/2013)  \n 2. After the expiration of Agreement on Flat Tax Payment (after 2013) on, the **Savan Vegas and Casino Co., Ltd. to pay tax duties according to the regulated law on tax.**  \n Therefore, issues this notification for your acknowledgement and to undertake.  \n Tax Department, Director  \n Manivone Insisiengmai (Emphasis added).\n\nMr. Bounnam\u2019s First Witness Statement, \u00b6 11.\n\n56.\n\nOn 20 December 2011, the Laotian National Assembly passed the New Tax Code, raising the excise tax on casino revenue to 80% of revenue.\n\n57.\n\nOn 28 December 2011, Mr. Pipes wrote a letter to the Prime Minister requesting an extension of the FTA. He says his proposal was based on what he understood from Ms. Manivone would be an acceptable schedule of tax payments.18 Mr. Pipes was in attendance at the hearing but, by arrangement between counsel, he did not provide oral testimony.\n\nExhibit RE-15\n\n58.\n\nOn 11 January 2012, the Prime Minister\u2019s office directed the Minister of Finance to deal with the 28 December 2011 request from Mr. Pipes.\n\n59.\n\nOn 9 February 2012, the Deputy Minister of Finance was briefed on the latest Savan Vegas FTA proposals:\n\nTax Department respectfully request you to review the report draft on the Flat Tax payment requested by Savan Vegas and Casino Co., Ltd. from 2014-2054 **to be reported to Prime Minister for consideration.** Tax Department has completely amended to such report draft as you instructed on 8/2/2012 including the annexes showing the figures of tax obligation to be paid from 2014-2054 made by Savan Vegas and Casino Co., Ltd. attached herewith.19 (Emphasis added).\n\nNothing in the 9 February 2012 document indicates that the Lao Government officials considered the door to be closed to a renewal of the FTA on terms to be agreed to.\n\nExhibit C-319.\n\n60.\n\nOn 21 March 2012, there was a high level meeting attended by both the Prime Minister and the Deputy Prime Minister as well as representatives from other Lao Government departments. The Minutes of the meeting were filed with this Tribunal on 6 January 2014 as Exhibit C-332. There is no reference in the Minutes to any earlier Lao Government \"decision\" taken in document 1121 of 10 June 2011 from the Prime Minister\u2019s office, or document 0772 of 28 November 2011 from the Minister of Finance. It appears that there was a discussion in the Prime Minister\u2019s office meeting of the merits of the Claimant\u2019s proposal, which **according to the Minutes of the 21 March 2012 meeting** was rejected in the following terms:\n\nRegarding the proposal by Savan Vegas and Casino Company, Ltd. to pay a flat tax during the years 2014 to 2054, the meeting agrees as follows: 3.1. Continue to carry out the provisions of the contract between the Government of the Lao PDR and Sanum Investments Company, Ltd. (Savan Vegas and Casino Company, Ltd.) dated August 10, 2007. **When the period specified in the contract for payment of flat tax ends, the contract is to be revised to conform to the Tax Laws of the Lao PDR.**\n\nRegarding payment of dividends from casino income, they are to be divided by the formula of 30% for the state and 70% for the investors. The 70% is to be divided according to the proportion of shares held.20\n\nExhibit C-332.\n\n61.\n\nThis appears from the file to be the end of the written record of negotiations between the Parties concerning the renewal of the FTA.\n\n**III. A GENERAL APPROACH TO THE TRIBUNAL\u2019S JURISDICTION**\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n**A. Prerequisites for the Tribunal\u2019s Jurisdiction**\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n62.\n\nAs was noted above, the Claimant is a company incorporated under the laws of Aruba, The Netherlands. Article 13 of the BIT provides that in the case of The Netherlands the term \"national\" under BIT Article 1 (b)(ii) shall apply to enterprises incorporated in Aruba. Hence, Lao Holdings N.V. is a national of The Netherlands, which has been an ICSID Contracting State since October 14, 1966. Laos is not an ICSID Contracting State. As such, this dispute was brought under ICSID\u2019s Additional Facility Rules. The Additional Facility establishes that the ICSID Secretariat may administer a proceeding between a State and a national of another State in the following instances, among others:\n\na. \"conciliation and arbitration proceedings for the settlement of legal disputes arising directly out of an investment which are not within the jurisdiction of the Centre because either the State party to the dispute or the State whose national is a party to the dispute is not a Contracting State;..,\"21\n\nArticle 2(a) of the ICSID-AF Rules.\n\n63.\n\nArticle 4 of the ICSID-AF Rules establishes, in relevant part:\n\n\"(1) Any agreement providing for conciliation or arbitration proceedings under the Additional Facility in respect of existing or future disputes requires the approval of the Secretary-General. The parties may apply for such approval at any time prior to the institution of proceedings by submitting to the Secretariat a copy of the agreement concluded or proposed to be concluded between them together with other relevant documentation and such additional information as the Secretariat may reasonably request.\n\n(2) In the case of an application based on Article 2(a), the Secretary-General shall give his approval only if (a) he is satisfied that the requirements of that provision are fulfilled at the time, and (b) both parties give their consent to the jurisdiction of the Centre under Article 25 of the Convention (in lieu of the Additional Facility) in the event that the jurisdictional requirements *ratione personae* of that Article shall have been met at the time when proceedings are instituted...\"\n\n64.\n\nIn the present case the Tribunal must examine its jurisdiction in light of the above Articles of the ICSID-AF Rules and the BIT. Under this analysis, for the Tribunal to have jurisdiction four conditions must be satisfied:\n\n- first, a condition *ratione personae',* one of the parties to the dispute must be a Contracting State or a national of a Contracting State, while the other must not be a Contracting State or a national of a Contracting State ;\n\n- second, a condition *ratione materiae'.* the dispute must be a legal dispute arising directly out of an investment;\n\n- third, a condition *ratione voluntatis',* the parties must consent in writing that the dispute be settled through ICSID-AF arbitration;\n\n- fourth, a condition *ratione temporis',* the ICSID-AF Rules and the instrument including the arbitration clause must be applicable at the relevant time.\n\n65.\n\nNo objection is taken to the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction over the Parties or the subject matter of the claim. Nor is the existence of the consent to arbitration of both Parties contested. The Lao Government\u2019s objection is taken solely to jurisdiction *ratione temporis.* According to the Lao Government, the investor was not a national of The Netherlands when the dispute over the New Tax Code arose. In its view, the \"legal dispute\" over the application to Savan Vegas of the New Tax Code arose no later than 16 December 2011 when the Claimant received formal notice from the Prime Minister\u2019s office that the FTA would not be renewed. It followed, the Lao Government contends, that the ordinary law governing taxes would apply from and after the expiry of the five year FTA on 31 December 2013. The \"legal dispute\" can and did arise before any taxes became due or payable. It arose more than a month before the Claimant was incorporated in Aruba as an opportunistic device to provide Sanum with access to the rights and remedies afforded by The Netherlands/Laos Treaty.\n\n**B. Burden of Proof**\n----------------------\n\n66.\n\nThe Respondent acknowledges that, while \"the Tribunal must ascertain that the prerequisites for its jurisdiction are fulfilled and that the facts on which its jurisdiction can be based are proven\",22 in terms of the present jurisdictional objection, the Respondent accepts the burden of proving that the \"legal dispute\" arose before the critical date.23\n\nLegal Authority RA-01, *Phoenix Action Ltd. v. Czech Republic,* ICSID Case No. ARB/06/5, Award, 15 April 2009 (hereinafter *\"Phoenix\"),* \u00b6 64.\n\nThe Respondent cites *Pac Rim Cayman LLC v. Republic of El Salvador,* ICSID Case No. ARB/09/12, Decision on Jurisdiction, 1 June 2012 (hereinafter *\"\"Pac Rim\"),* 2.13: \"The Tribunal agrees that the burden lies on a claimant who asserts a positive right **and on a respondent who asserts a positive answer to the claimant.\u2019\u2019** (Emphasis added)\n\n67.\n\nIn particular, the Respondent accepts the onus of establishing (i) that a legal dispute existed and (ii) did so before 17 January 2012 and that the event(s) giving rise to the dispute were (iii) neither continuous nor (iv) composite.\n\n**C. Abuse of process distinguished from objection to jurisdiction** ***ratione temporis***\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n68.\n\nWhile the Lao Government contends that Sanum\u2019s \"forum shopping\" was an abuse of proper Treaty procedure, it does **not** make the argument that the investor\u2019s acquisition of Dutch nationality was an abuse of process that entitles the Lao Government to a dismissal of this entire arbitration. The Lao Government\u2019s objection to the tax element of the claim relies entirely on the general principle of non-retroactivity in the application of international treaties. The sole asserted basis of denial of the jurisdiction of the Tribunal over the New Tax Code issue is the principle of *ratione temporis.*\n\n69.\n\nThe Tribunal wishes to underline the distinction between these two quite different forms of objections. The *rationale* for the doctrine of abuse of process was succinctly set out in *Phoenix Action Ltd. v. Czech Republic,* ICSID Case No. ARB/06/5 as follows:\n\nThe evidence indeed shows that the Claimant made an \"investment\" not for the purpose of engaging in economic activity, but for the sole purpose of bringing international litigation against the Czech Republic. This alleged investment was not made in order to engage in national economic activity, it was made solely for the purpose of getting involved with international legal activity. The unique goal of the \"investment\" was to transform a pre-existing domestic dispute into an international dispute subject to ICSID arbitration under a bilateral investment treaty. This kind of transaction is not a *bona fide* transaction and cannot be a protected investment under the ICSID system.\n\n(...)\n\n... It is the duty of the Tribunal not to protect such an abusive manipulation of the system of international investment protection under the ICSID Convention and the BITs. It is indeed the Tribunal\u2019s view that to accept jurisdiction in this case would go against the basic objectives underlying the ICSID Convention as well as those of bilateral investment treaties. The Tribunal has to ensure that the ICSID mechanism does not protect investments that it was not designed for to protect...24\n\n*Phoenix* \u00b6\u00b6 142 and 144.\n\n70.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that it is clearly an abuse for an investor to manipulate the nationality of a company subsidiary to gain jurisdiction under an international treaty at a time when the investor is aware that events have occurred that negatively affect its investment and may lead to arbitration. In particular, abuse of process must preclude unacceptable manipulations by a claimant acting in bad faith who is fully aware prior to the change in nationality of the \"legal dispute,\" as submitted by the Respondent.\n\n71.\n\nThe Respondent the Lao Government says the award in *Venezuela Holdings B.V and others v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela,* ICSID Case No. ARB/07/27 (2010)25 is dispositive in its favour due to the factual similarity with the case at hand, although in point of law, the Tribunal\u2019s decision in that case turned explicitly on an allegation of abuse of right. In fact, the tribunal in that case essentially ruled that it is an abuse to change nationality after a dispute has arise, but that no such abuse exists when the change of nationality has occurred after the dispute has arisen, in which case the rules of *ratione temporis* application of the Treaty aloow the claim to be heard by the arbitral tribunal.\n\nLegal Authority RA-04, *Venezuela Holdings B. V. and others v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela* (formerly *Mobil Corporation and others v. Venezuela),* ICSID Case No. ARB/07/27, Decision on Jurisdiction, 10 June 2010.\n\n72.\n\nIt was shown in that case that Mobil had made substantial investments in Venezuela from 1999 to 2005. In 2004, Venezuela raised the royalty tax rate from 1% to 16.66 %. Mobil said it was \"surprised\" at that development. In February and in May 2005, Mobil wrote to the Government complaining of the rise in tax rates. Then in June 2005, Venezuela raised the rate to 30% by Ministerial decree and introduced a bill into the legislature to raise it further to 50%. Mobil wrote on 20 June 2005 that the recent raise \"has broadened the investment dispute.\" It requested negotiations to \"reach an amicable resolution of this matter.\" The Tribunal concluded that: \"It results from those letters that in June 2005 there were already pending disputes between the Parties relating to the increase of royalties and income taxes decided by Venezuela.\" Thereafter, \"on 27 October 2005, Mobil created a new entity under the laws of the Netherlands...\" That entity then acquired the Mobil companies that had been engaged in Venezuela and \"the Dutch Holding Company was thus inserted into the corporate chain for the Cerro Negro and La Ceibo projects.\"\n\n73.\n\nOn these facts, the *Mobil* Tribunal observed:\n\n203. As recalled above, the restructuring of Mobil\u2019s investments through Dutch entity occurred from October 2005 to November 2006. At that time, there were already pending disputes relating to royalties and income tax. However, nationalisation measures were taken by the Venezuelan authorities only from January 2007 on. Thus, the dispute over such nationalisation measures can only be deemed to have arisen after the measures were taken.\n\n204. As stated by the Claimants, the aim of the restructuring of their investments in Venezuela through a Dutch holding was to protect those investments against breaches of their rights by the Venezuelan authorities by gaining access to ICSID arbitration through the BIT. The Tribunal considers that this was a perfectly legitimate goal **as far as it concerned future disputes.** (Emphasis added)\n\n74.\n\nThe Tribunal then flagged the important distinction between the abuse of process doctrine and an objection to jurisdiction *ratione temporis.* As to abuse of process, the Tribunal stated:\n\n205. With respect to pre-existing disputes, the situation is different and the Tribunal considers that to restructure investments only in order to gain jurisdiction under a BIT for such disputes would constitute, to take the words of the Phoenix Tribunal, \"an abusive manipulation of the system of international investment protection under the ICSID Convention and the BITs... (Emphasis added).\n\n75.\n\nHowever, as to an objection to jurisdiction *ratione temporis,* the *Mobil* Tribunal continued:\n\n... the Claimants seem indeed to be conscious of this, when they state that they \"invoke ICSID jurisdiction on the basis of the consent expressed in the Treaty only for disputes arising under the Treaty for action that the Respondent took or continued to take after the restructuring was completed. (Emphasis added)\n\n76.\n\nThe Tribunal in *Pac Rim Cayman LLC v. Republic of El Savador,* ICSID Case No. ARB/09/12, explained clearly that the time frame corresponding to a finding of abuse of process is not the same as the time frame corresponding to an objection *ratione temporis.* **More precisely, if a company changes its nationality in order to gain ICSID jurisdiction at a moment when things have started to deteriorate so that a dispute is highly probable, it can be considered an abuse of process, but for an objection based on** ***ratione temporis*** **to be upheld, the dispute has to have actually arisen before the critical date to conform to the general principle of nonretroactivity in the interpretation and application of international treaties.**\n\n77.\n\nAs far as abuse of process is concerned, the *Pac Rim* tribunal explained:\n\n2.99... In the Tribunal\u2019s view, the dividing-line occurs when the relevant party **can see an actual dispute or can foresee a specific future dispute as a very high probability** and not merely as a possible controversy. In the Tribunal\u2019s view, before that dividing-line is reached, there will be ordinarily no abuse of process; but after that dividing-line is passed, there ordinarily will be. The answer in each case will, however, depend upon its particular facts and circumstances, as in this case. As already indicated above, the Tribunal is here more concerned with substance than semantics; and it recognises that, as a matter of practical reality, this dividing-line will rarely be a thin red line, but will include a significant **grey area.** (Emphasis added)\n\n78.\n\nThe solution is different when the issue is based on an objection to jurisdiction *ratione temporis:*\n\n2,101. **Ratione Temporis:** The Tribunal considers that this approach as regards the Abuse of Process issue is materially different from the approach applicable to the Ratione Temporis issue, where both Parties relied on the general principle of non-retroactivity for the interpretation and application of international treaties.\n\n2,104. Where there is an alleged practice characterised as a continuous act... which began before 13 December 2007 and continued thereafter, this Tribunal would have jurisdiction ratione temporis over that portion of the continuous act that lasted after that date, regardless of events or knowledge by the Claimant before 13 December 2007. The Tribunal concludes that this solution is different from that reached in its analysis of the Abuse of Process issue, as here explained.\n\n2,107. In the Tribunal\u2019s view, the relevant date for deciding upon the Abuse of Process issue must necessarily be earlier in time than the date for deciding the Ratione Temporis issue.\n\n79.\n\nIn the present case, as in *Phoenix,* it is difficult to discern any fresh economic investment arising out of the restructuring that would advance the purposes of the Treaty which, according to its preamble, exists \"to extend and intensify the economic relations between th[e Parties], particularly with respect to investments by the nationals of one Contracting Party in the territory of the other Contracting Party.\"26\n\nLegal Authority CA-19.\n\n80.\n\nArticle 31(1) of the *Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties**,* provides that \"[a] treaty shall be interpreted in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context **and in the light of its object and purpose.\"** The Lao Government says the Claimant has simply taken over the existing investment of Sanum, the Macaon company, and its insertion into the ownership structure was for the purpose of legal tactics, not investment.\n\n81.\n\nHowever, in this present case, the Lao Government does **not** advance the argument that, as was the case in *Phoenix,* the abuse of process ought to result in a dismissal of the entire arbitration. Its jurisdictional concern is solely with jurisdiction *ratione* *temporis, i.e.* the attempt to give retroactive effect to the Treaty at the instance of a party not entitled to its protection. At paragraph 20 of its Objection dated 15 October 2013, the Lao Government states as follows:\n\nSubsidiarily, Respondent argues that Claimant has proceeded in bad faith in prosecuting its claim in the fashion it has done, and asks the Tribunal to find as a fact that the proceeding with respect to the tax dispute constitutes an abuse of process. **Respondent notes that it does not argue,** as did Respondent in *Pac Rim Cayman LLC v The Republic of El Salvador,27* **that \"abuse of process\" is an independent ground for a finding of a lack of jurisdiction. Rather Respondent urges the Tribunal to make a finding on abuse of process solely for the purpose of allocating fees and costs at the end of the arbitration,** following the guidance of the Tribunal in *Phoenix Action Ltd. v. The Czech Republic,* which awarded all fees and costs to the Respondent in that case based upon a finding of claimant\u2019s abuse of the international investment arbitration system. (Emphasis added)\n\n*Pac Rim, supra* note 23.\n\n82.\n\nThe Lao Government\u2019s position was reaffirmed on 6 January 2014 at the hearing on the jurisdictional objection. The Lao Government seeks only that the Claimant\u2019s alleged \"forum shopping\" be taken into account in the disposition of arbitral costs.\n\n83.\n\nIn other words, in the present case, the question could have been discussed whether a dispute was foreseeable before the change of nationality, if an objection had been raised on the basis of an abuse of process. However, as the only objection to jurisdiction was based on *ratione temporis* issues, the only task of the Tribunal is to determine the moment when the dispute arose. If that moment - \"the critical date\" - is before the change of nationality, then the Tribunal enjoys no jurisdiction; if, to the contrary, the critical date is after the change of nationality, then the Tribunal can assert jurisdiction.\n\n**IV.THE TRIBUNAL\u2019S ANALYSIS OF THE OBJECTION TO JURISDICTION*****RATIONE TEMPORIS***\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**A. The Applicable Texts**\n---------------------------\n\n84.\n\nArticle 9 of the Lao/Netherlands Treaty deals with \"legal disputes\" and provides as follows:\n\n**Article 9** [legal dispute]\n\nEach Contracting Party hereby consents to submit any ***legal dispute***  arising between that Contracting Party and a national of the other Contracting Party concerning an investment of that national in the territory of the former Contracting Party to the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes for settlement by conciliation or arbitration under the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of other States. (Emphasis added)\n\n85.\n\nWhile there is no explicit temporal limit written into Article 9, such a time limit does appear in relation to the making of a \"claim\" under Article 10:\n\n**Article 10** [claim]\n\nThe provisions of this Agreement shall, from the date of entry into force thereof, also apply to investments, which have been made before that date, but they shall not apply to **any** ***claim***  *concerning an investment, which arose before its entry into force.* (Emphasis added)\n\n86.\n\nThe articles relevant to the determination of the present jurisdictional objection draw a distinction between a \"legal dispute\" and a \"claim.\" This is not necessarily relevant, as pointed out by the tribunal in *Emilio Agustin Maffezini v. Kingdom of Spain,* ICSID Case No. ARB/97/7, Decision on Jurisdiction, January 25, 2000, 16 *ICSID Review -F.I.L.J.* 1, 33, para. 97 (2001):\n\nWhile a dispute may have emerged, it does not necessarily have to coincide with the presentation of a formal claim. The critical date will in fact separate, not the dispute from the claim, but the dispute from prior events that do not entail a conflict of legal views and interests.\n\n**B. The Lao Government\u2019s Position on its Jurisdictional Objection**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n87.\n\nThe Lao Government\u2019s objection to the inclusion of the New Tax Code claim in this arbitration may be summarized as follows:\n\n(a) on 18 March 2011, Sanum made a request to extend its FTA;\n\n(b) on 10 June 2011, the Prime Minister\u2019s office rejected that request [by Notice 1121], thus requiring Savan Vegas casino to pay taxes after the expiry of the FTA at the rates in the tax code (that is when the tax dispute became a \"fact\");\n\n(c) Sanum tried through five months of subsequent negotiations to have that decision reversed;\n\n(d) Sanum was aware from 5 August 2011 that two other casinos in Laos had FTAs;\n\n(e) Sanum\u2019s negotiations attempting to reverse the Prime Minister\u2019s office\u2019s decision of 10 June 2011 ended, in any case, on 28 November 2011 when the Finance Department notified Sanum [by Document 0772] that Sanum\u2019s investments would be subject to the tax code upon expiry of the current FTA;\n\n(f) the New Tax Code was enacted on 20 December 2011, establishing that the new rate for the excise tax on casino revenue would be 80%, thus fixing the \"injury\" alleged in these proceedings; and\n\n(g) the \"legal dispute\" thus predated the Claimant\u2019s acquisition of Dutch nationality;\n\n(h) the Claimant thus has no recourse under the Treaty.\n\n88.\n\nIn response to the Claimant\u2019s contention that the dispute had not crystallized before the change of nationality, counsel for the Lao Government contends that there were no \"negotiations\" with anyone in a position of authority in 2012. Sanum\u2019s letter of 28 December 2011 to the Prime Minister\u2019s office, it says, was merely a unilateral offer to negotiate. It is obvious, counsel for the Lao Government concludes, that a claimant cannot delay the formation of a \"legal dispute\" by writing unilateral letters of \"proposals\" that are meaningless.\n\n89.\n\nBe that as it may, the Lao Government contends that, when Lao Holdings was incorporated in Aruba on 17 January 2012, the \"legal dispute\" over the application of the New Tax Code had plainly been disposed of adversely to Sanum by the Lao Government, and the Treaty therefore has no application. Counsel for the Lao Government put the point as follows:\n\nThe negotiations to attempt to reverse the Prime Minister\u2019s Office\u2019s June 10, 2011 decision ended on November 28, 2011 when the Tax Department notified Sanum it would be subject to the tax code; and... the new Tax Code was enacted on December 20, 2011, establishing that the new rate for the excise tax on casino revenue would be 80%, thus fixing the \"injury\" alleged in these proceedings. The operative *\"disagreements on points of law and facts, conflict of legal views or of interests\"* all arose before the \"crucial date\" of January 12 |.s/c, should say 17], 2012.28\n\n(Respondent\u2019s Objection, \u00b622)\n\n90.\n\nHence, the Lao Government says the tax issue not only crystallized prior to the critical date, but was resolved against the Claimant (at that time unprotected by the Treaty) by the Lao Government prior to the critical date.\n\n**C. The Claimant\u2019s Response to the Jurisdictional Objection**\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n91.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the Claimant disavows any *contractual* claim arising out of the Lao Government\u2019s refusal to extend the FTA or what the Claimant says are the Lao Government\u2019s failures to live up to its alleged promises to renegotiate the FTA.\n\n92.\n\nEqually, the Claimant does not contest the enactment of the New Tax Code, as such. At the enactment stage there was no \"legal dispute.\"29\n\n*ConocoPhillips Petrozuata B.V., ConocoPhillips Hamaca B.V. and ConocoPhillips Gulf of Paria B.V. v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela,* ICSID Case No. ARB/07/30, Decision on Jurisdiction and the Merits, 3 September 2013 and citing *Victor Pey Casado and President Allende Foundation v. Republic of Chile,* ICSID Case No. ARB/98/2, Award, 8 May 2008.\n\n93.\n\nHaving said that, the Claimant offers a \"cascade\" of responses, both legal and factual, to the Lao Government\u2019s objection.\n\n94.\n\n**Firstly,** the Claimant says that under the Treaty there is no time limit on when an investor can take a \"legal dispute\" to arbitration. Accordingly, it does not matter if the \"legal dispute\" over the application of the New Tax Code arose in 2011 or 2012.\n\n95.\n\nThe Claimant argues that the difference between the wording of Article 9 and 10 shows that the framers of the Treaty put their minds to \"temporal\" issues, and the absence in Article 9 of an explicit time limit comparable to Article 10 must be given effect.\n\n96.\n\nThe Claimant insists that it does not place any reliance on Article 10. The Claimant invokes only the \"legal dispute\" provisions of Article 9.\n\n97.\n\n**Secondly,** and in the alternative, if the Treaty is interpreted as containing an applicable temporal limitation, the \"legal dispute\" over the *application* of the tax law did not arise until after the negotiations for the renewal of the FTA collapsed (at the earliest) in March 2012, well after the critical date. The Claimant cites the *Micula* tribunal for the proposition that \"... the critical date is when the dispute arose rather than the date when events and actions that may have given rise to the dispute took place.\"30\n\n*Ioan Micula, Viorel Micula and others v. Romania,* ICSID Case No. ARB/05/20, Decision on Jurisdiction and Admissibility, 24 September 2008, \u00b6 155.\n\n98.\n\nIn his Fourth Witness Statement, sworn on 25 November 2013, Mr. Baldwin acknowledges receipt on 16 December 2011 of the Ministry of Finance rejection, but testifies that the rejection at the Ministerial level was understood by Sanum to be simply a prelude to a review by the Prime Minister. He testified to the following conversation with Ms. Manivone after receipt of Notice 0772, which, in his view, simply confirmed that the locus of negotiations had now shifted from the Ministry of Finance to the Prime Minister\u2019s office:\n\nNotice No. 0772 informed us that the Government had rejected our FTA extension proposal. Although this notice was dated 28 November 2011, we did not receive it until 16 December 2011 - this again is typical of how the Lao Government operates. When we received this Notice, I was surprised. I spoke with **Madame Manivone** about it, and she explained that she was instructed by the Minister of Finance to issue it. **She assured me, however, that the FTA would nonetheless be extended, and that she would help guide us through the process.** She explained that **we would now have to go through the Prime Minister\u2019s Office** to obtain approval for the FTA extension, and that we should resubmit our proposal directly to the Prime Minister. So, later that month, we submitted a new proposal to extend the FTA - containing the same proposed flat tax payments as those recommended by Madame Manivone in her 4 August 2011 report to the Minister of Finance - to the Prime Minister, (para. 20, Emphasis added)\n\n99.\n\nThe inevitable question, of course, is whether Mr. Baldwin correctly recorded his conversation with Ms. Manivone, and if so her intent in providing what he took to be assurances. The Lao Government did not adduce any evidence from Ms. Manivone to dispute Mr. Baldwin\u2019s evidence. Mr. Baldwin was present at the 6 January 2014 hearing in respect of the jurisdictional objection but by agreement of counsel (as will be explained) Mr. Baldwin did not testify and was not cross-examined. His evidence was taken as read.\n\n100.\n\nThe Fourth Baldwin Statement continued:\n\nThroughout early 2012, we believed that our latest proposal for extension of the FTA was under active consideration by the Government. Indeed, I discussed the extension of Savan Vegas\u2019s FTA on multiple occasions during this time period with **Dr. Sinlavong, the Minister to the Prime Minister\u2019s Office.** (Emphasis added)\n\n101.\n\nThe Lao Government filed an affidavit by Dr. Sinlavong dated 9 December 2013 stating that \"Mr. Baldwin has contacted me many times to discuss his investments in Laos\" (para. 4). His redacted statement does not disclose the content or timing of those discussions.31 The Claimant requested that Dr. Sinlavong be produced at the hearing of 6 January 2014 for cross-examination, but Dr. Sinlavong did not appear. Counsel for the Lao Government advised the Tribunal that Dr. Sinlavong had failed to make a timely visa application to the French Embassy.\n\nIn the Claimant\u2019s Rejoinder on Jurisdiction dated 23 December 2013 it is said at \u201845:  \n 45. In addition, a document produced by Respondent and recently translated by Claimant shows that Dr. Sinlavong - who now claims to \"have never spoken to anyone on the issue related to the extension of the flat tax\" - *actually issued an official notice calling for Savan Vegas\u2019s exemption from the New Tax Law* in March 2012. Notice No. 728/GO, dated 28 March 2012 and signed by Dr. Sinlavong, advised the Ministers of Finance and Planning and Investment: *\"When the Flat Tax Agreement expires, the new Agreement must be amended* according to the Law on Tax of the Lao PDR (subject to the accounting entry system).\" More specifically, the Notice states that \"benefits sharing obtaining [sic] from Casino Income [should be]... divided according to the State formula namely 30% and the investor gets 70% of the total income,\" as an alternative to the 80% demand on revenues established under the New Tax Law.\n\n102.\n\nThe Lao Government points out the lack of any written communication from the Lao Government corroborating the version of ongoing \"negotiations\" testified to by Mr. Baldwin and Mr. Pipes, and it says that the documentation that does exist contradicts rather than confirms their testimony.\n\n103.\n\nThe Lao Government says that the 28 December 2011 \"proposal\" was not even a good faith offer to negotiate. The yearly payments listed in Mr. Pipes\u2019 letter were lower than the 18 March 2011 proposal the Lao Government had previously rejected. In response, Mr. Baldwin testified that:\n\nMoreover, the terms of the December proposal, as was the case with every proposal, reflected what we were told at the time had the best chance of being accepted by the Lao Government. It makes no sense for us to have submitted a proposal we did not believe in good faith would be accepted by the Lao Government - our goal was to obtain an extension of the FTA. [Statement dated 25 November 2013, para. 22]\n\n104.\n\nMoreover, **the Claimant contends that** whatever \"legal dispute\" existed prior to March 2012 related to the old tax law, which was at a much lower rate, and not to the New Tax Code enacted on 20 December 2011 but which did not come into effect until October 2012, and could not have been applied to the Claimant in any event until the expiry of Sanum\u2019s FTA on 31 December 2013, long after the critical date of 17 January 2012.\n\n105.\n\nThe Claimant argues that the \"tax laws of the Lao PDR\" mentioned in Exhibit C-33232 must refer to something other than the New Tax Code because if an 80% tax were imposed on revenue (plus 10% VAT) the next paragraph makes no sense because there would be no dividends to divide.\n\nReferred to in \u00b6 55 of this Decision.\n\n106.\n\nThe Claimant, in its 2 August 2013 submission, contends the following:\n\nIn March 2012, after Sanum and Savan Vegas learned that members of the Government were opposed to their latest proposal for extension, they withdrew their proposal. Nevertheless, Government officials continued to state even after that point that agreement on the FTA could be reached before the expiry of Sanum\u2019s FTA and the new casino tax would not be applied to Savan Vegas.33\n\nClaimant\u2019s Provisional Measures Reply dated 2 August 2013, \u00b626.\n\n107.\n\nAlso, **according to the Claimant,** the Lao Government did not threaten the Claimant with the new 80% tax on casino revenue until after the Claimant delivered its Notice to Arbitrate herein on 12 August 2012. Prior to that date, there had been \"no confrontation of the points of view of the Parties\" on that legal issue. In its application for Provisional Measures dated 19 April 2013, the Claimant first identified the risk of the application to it of the \"80% tax on gaming revenues.\" On 12 July 2013, the Lao Government affirmed its intention to impose the New Tax Code and stated:\n\nAbsent any proof that a tax would be \"confiscatory\", claimant is not entitled to Provisional Measures blocking enforcement of a tax passed in a tax code. (para. 1)\n\n108.\n\nThe Claimant contends that the New Tax Code did not become a \"legal dispute\" between the Parties until it was raised in 2013 in the context of the Claimant\u2019s Request for Provisional Measures.\n\n109.\n\nThe Claimant says that in the Provisional Measures proceeding, the Respondent asserted for the first time (and the Claimant subsequently denied), that Savan Vegas would be subject to the New Tax Code. Thus, the Claimant argues, the \"legal dispute\" over the application of the New Tax Code did not in fact crystallize until July 2013. The Order for Provisional Measures dated 17 September 2013 granted a measure of protection to the Claimant from the New Tax Code by way of an escrow arrangement. The terms of the Provisional Measures decision are not otherwise at issue in the present application.34\n\n*\"the Lao Government from (a) demanding that Claimant pay any amounts allegedly due pursuant to the New Tax Law; and (b) instituting or further pursuing any action, judicial or otherwise, to collect any payments Respondent claims are owed by Claimant pursuant to the New Tax Law; (b) enjoins the Lao PDR from taking any enforcement action, judicial or otherwise, to seize or interfere in the operations of the Lao Bao and Ferry Terminal slot clubs based on any disputed tax amounts; (3) enjoins the Lao PDR from taking any action, judicial or otherwise, to freeze or seize funds that Claimant or its related entities place in accounts in the Lao banking system; and (4) these orders are under the condition that the Claimant deposits in an escrow account at a Singapore bank or other bank satisfactory to the parties under arrangements negotiated by the parties and approved by the Tribunal, the amount of US$429,330 on the first day of each month commencing 1 January 2014. (5) enjoins both parties from taking any steps that would alter the status quo ante, or aggravate the dispute. \"*\n\nOn 16 December 2013, the Claimant informed the Tribunal that both Parties had reached an agreement on the escrow arrangements to be established in accordance with the Tribunal\u2019s 17 September 2013 Decision on Claimant\u2019s Amended Application for Provisional Measures. The Tribunal confirmed this agreement on 23 December 2013.\n\nAs to the Provisional Measures the Tribunal enjoined:\n\n110.\n\nTherefore, it was not until 12 July 2013, according to the Claimant, that the present \"legal dispute\" arose.\n\n111.\n\n**Finally,** the application of the New Tax Code is a *continuing* measure that will affect the Claimant\u2019s investments from and after 1 January 2014, and each assessment will give rise to a new claim or legal dispute. It is therefore an issue that the Tribunal should deal with.\n\n112.\n\nIn any event, according to the Claimant, no \"claim\" has yet been made against Savan Vegas under the New Tax Code, which did not become law until October 2012, and which could not as a matter of law apply to Savan Vegas until the FTA expired on 31 December 2013 (four days before the hearing of this jurisdictional objection). If, and when a \"claim\" is made against the Claimant under the New Tax Code, by way of assessment, demand or otherwise, there will arise a \"claim\" capable of being referred to arbitration (if necessary) under Article 10, but, says the Claimant, no such \"claim\" is yet in existence.\n\n**D. The Tribunal\u2019s Analysis of the Claimant\u2019s First Response to the Objection** ***Ratione*** ***Temporis:*** **Namely that the Treaty Contains No** ***Ratione Temporis*** **Limitation**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n113.\n\nThe Tribunal does not accept the argument that there is no temporal limit in relation to Article 9 and that any party may at any time refer to arbitration \"legal disputes\" that were dealt with before the investor\u2019s accession to the Treaty (leaving aside events that form elements of continuing or composite disputes).\n\n114.\n\nThe general principle of non-retroactivity is expressed in Article 28 of the *Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties* as follows:\n\n\"Unless a different intention appears from the treaty or is otherwise established, its provisions do not bind a party in relation to any act or fact which took place or any situation which ceased to exist before the date of the entry into force of the treaty with respect to that party.\"\n\n115.\n\nIt cannot be said that the silence of Article 9 with respect to a temporal limit \"clearly\" manifests a \"different intention\" apparent on the face of the Treaty.35 The fact (as the Claimant points out) that Laos and The Netherlands used different language in different treaties does not alter the fact that nothing in *this* Treaty contemplates that investors such as the Claimant could change their nationalities at will by artful corporate restructurings to \"forum shop\" after a legal dispute has arisen with the same investor on the same issue and had therefore become, in the words of the *Paushok* tribunal,36 a \"discrete event in the course of relations [between the Parties]\" that predated the Treaty.\"\n\nIn its 1996 Commentaries to the *Draft Articles of the Law of Treaties,* the International Law Commission stated:  \n There is nothing to prevent the Parties from giving a treaty, or some of its provisions, retroactive effect if they think fit. It is essentially a question of their intention. The general rule however is that a treaty is not to be treated as intended to have retroactive effects unless such an intention is expressed in the treaty or was clearly to be implied from its terms. (Emphasis added)\n\n*Sergei Paushok and others v. Republic of Mongolia,* UNCITRAL, Award on Jurisdiction and Liability, 28 April 2011, \u00b6498.\n\n116.\n\nThe general presumption favours non-retroactivity and in this Treaty the presumption is not displaced by any different intention \"apparent\" on its face.\n\n117.\n\nThe Tribunal does not view the Treaty as intending to provide legal weapons to investors for the purpose of re-engaging in a pre-existing legal dispute with the Lao Government.\n\n118.\n\nAccordingly, the Tribunal concludes that the Respondent is entitled to raise the objection *ratione temporis* to its assertion of a \"legal dispute\" under Article 9.\n\n119.\n\nThe question, therefore, is when did the tax dispute arise?\n\n**E. The Tribunal\u2019s Analysis of the Claimant\u2019s Second Response to the Respondent\u2019sObjection, Namely that the \"Legal Dispute\" Over the New Tax Code Did Not Arise Between the Parties Until After the Critical Date of 17 January 2012**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n***1. Definition of a \"Legal Dispute\"***\n----------------------------------------\n\n120.\n\nBoth Parties accept as appropriate the definition of \"dispute\" formulated by the Permanent Court of International Justice in the *Mavrommatis* case37 at page 11:\n\nA dispute is a disagreement on a point of law or fact, a conflict of legal views or of interests between two persons.\n\nLegal Authority RA-05, *The Mavrommatis Palestine Concessions,* PCIJ Ser A No 2, 11 (1924).\n\n121.\n\nTo which the tribunal in *Victor Pey Casado v. Chile,*38 added:\n\nIn order to establish the existence of such a dispute, \"it must be shown that the claim of one of the Parties meets obvious opposition from the other.\" (para. 441)\n\n(...)\n\nIt is only with the expression and the confrontation of the points of view of the Parties that the dispute is crystallized, (para. 443)\n\nLegal Authority CA-12, *Victor Pey Casado and President Allende Foundation v. Republic of Chile,* ICSID Case No. ARB/98/2, Decision on the Request for Provisional Measures, 25 September 2001.\n\n***2. When did the dispute arise? The contentions of the Parties and the Tribunal\u2019s findings***\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n122.\n\nThe Claimant contests the Lao Government\u2019s position that the end of the FTA renewal negotiations (whatever date that might be) triggered a \"legal dispute\" about the application of the New Tax Code. The Claimant says the two disputes are distinct and separate. However, the Tribunal agrees with the Lao Government that the issues are linked. In the situation confronting the Parties in 2011 and 2012, Sanum clearly understood that it would be subject to the ordinary law of Laos, including the Tax Code, unless affirmatively exempted by the extension of its FTA. Sanum opposed the application to its investments of the ordinary tax laws on the basis of various alleged Lao Government representations and understandings regarding renewal of the FTA, and assurances from Lao Government officials that it was never their intention to apply the New Tax Code to existing investments such as Savan Vegas. In the Tribunal\u2019s view, the link between the FTA extension and the tax issue, while sequential, is clear, with the result that the treatment of the tax aspects of Sanum\u2019s business can be considered as a continuous behaviour.\n\n123.\n\nSanum\u2019s objective in the negotiations was to avoid the application of the ordinary tax laws. Whether or not at that time Sanum had formulated a detailed challenge to the application of the tax law to its investments and the implication of constantly increasing rates of tax being considered by the legislative power, does not detract from the direct link between a failure of the FTA negotiations and the consequent triggering of the tax dispute.\n\n124.\n\nThe Parties agree that the test for determining the critical date is objective and that the relevant question is not whether the Lao Government subjectively believed the legal dispute to have arisen, or whether the Claimant subjectively believed it had not, the question is whether the facts, objectively analysed, establish the existence of a dispute and if so at what time did it arise, and was it resolved (as the Lao Government argues) before the Treaty came into force as between the Lao Government and the Claimant?\n\n125.\n\nIn early 2011, the Ministry of Finance decided to undertake a revision of the Tax Code under the supervision of the Director General of the Tax Department, Ms. Manivone Insixiengmai, as related above.\n\n126.\n\nCounsel for the Respondent emphasizes that flat tax agreements are also made to serve the Lao Government\u2019s interest, not only investor\u2019s. If the Lao Government\u2019s assessment of the benefit changes, the *rationale* for the Flat Tax, from its point of view, may disappear.\n\n127.\n\nCertainly, Ms. Manivone consistently took the view in her memoranda that the Finance Tax Department had only 15 auditors to audit all the largest companies in Laos and she believed that her department lacked not only the human resources but the expertise to audit a casino, a cash based business.39 She pushed hard for a renewal of the Sanum FTA, and made no secret of the Tax Department\u2019s views in her dealings with the Claimant.\n\nExhibit RE-01, \u00b610.\n\n128.\n\nFrom the Claimant\u2019s perspective, it needed certainty about future tax treatment if it were to be able to arrange for long term financing to expand its gambling operations in Laos. The financial prospects of the company, and therefore its potential attraction as an investment, were linked, *inter alia,* to its exposure to an escalation of Laotian taxes over the life of the concession.\n\n129.\n\nThe evidence shows that, in the months following Sanum\u2019s request for a renewal of the FTA, there was disagreement within the Lao Government over the advantages and disadvantages of extending Sanum\u2019s FTA.\n\n130.\n\nThe Prime Minister\u2019s office was actively involved in the file at least by 10 June 2011 when it issued Notice 1121. The document, in the Tribunal\u2019s view, is ambiguous (as previously discussed). It cannot reasonably be interpreted, on the present state of the record, as a decision rejecting Sanum\u2019s request for a new FTA. But it establishes that the *locus* for the making of the final decision was at the Prime Ministerial level.\n\n131.\n\nMs. Manivone, who was a central figure in the Sanum negotiations, does not appear to have treated Notice 1121 as a rejection, and her conduct thereafter (as disclosed by the Lao Government documents) is not consistent with that view.\n\n132.\n\nThe Lao Government did file a witness statement from Mr. Bounnam Chounlaboudy, who in June 2011 was Director of the Legislative Division of the Tax Department, but it is apparent from his statement that he was only peripherally involved (if at all) in the Sanum negotiations.40 Mr. Bounnam does describe Notice 1121 as a denial of Sanum\u2019s request, but his conclusory statement is unsupported by any explanation or analysis of the text (neither the Laotian text nor the English text). In light of the unsatisfactory state of the evidentiary record, the Claimant requested Mr. Bounnam be produced at the 6 January 2014 hearing for cross-examination but he failed to appear.\n\nMr. Bounnam\u2019s lack of knowledge of relevant events is evident from his witness statement, for example:  \n*14. 1 was aware that Mrs. Manivone had discussions with her staff about the Savan Vegas\u2019 request for an extended Flat Tax Agreement during the summer 2011.*  \n*15. 1 was aware that Mrs. Manivone directed her staff to write a report addressed to the Minister of Finance. It is dated August 4, 2011.*  \n*16.1 was informed that Mrs. Manivone held a meeting with her staff and Sanum staff on August 5, 2011.*  \n*17. I was informed that Mrs. Manivone told Mr. Baldwin that she would submit the Tax Department\u2019s recommendation directly to the Minister of Finance.*\n\n133.\n\nThe Lao Government explained that Mr. Bounnam was unable to obtain a French visa because of his last-minute application and the holiday schedule of the French Embassy in Laos.41 However, in the Tribunal\u2019s view, there was no justification for leaving the visa application until the last minute. The hearing date for 6 January 2014 had been fixed more than 3 months earlier by the Tribunal\u2019s bifurcation order dated 23 September 2013. It was evident at the 23 September 2013 hearing that there were sharp differences between the Parties on some of the facts central to the Lao Government\u2019s own jurisdictional objection. In the absence of a waiver by the Claimant of its right to cross-examine the Lao Government\u2019s deponents, it was up to the Lao Government to have its witnesses available for cross-examination either at the hearing or at some prior occasion under arrangements satisfactory to the Parties.42\n\nEmail to the Tribunal from Counsel for the Respondent dated Friday, 3 January 2014.\n\nPursuant to Procedural Order No. 1, and as provided in the IBA Rules (applicable to these proceedings under Section 14.1 of Procedural Order No. 1), any witness whose statement is submitted as evidence is subject to cross-examination.\n\n134.\n\nIn light of Mr. Bounnam\u2019s failure to appear, and the lack of any evidence from Ms. Manivone, as well as the lack of clarity in the English text, **the Tribunal declines to treat Notice 1121 dated 10 June 2011 as a \"decision\" to reject the Sanum application, which could have triggered the dispute which is in front of the Tribunal.**\n\n135.\n\nThere is no doubt, in any event, that Ms. Manivone and the Tax Department continued to negotiate with Sanum on an open-ended basis.\n\n136.\n\nDocument 0772 dated 28 November 2011 on the other hand, clearly documents a decision to reject Sanum\u2019s application, but only at the level of the Minister of Finance.\n\n137.\n\nOn the Lao Government\u2019s view, the Flat Tax issue was dead as of 28 November 2011 (or at least by 16 December 2011 when Sanum acknowledged receipt of a copy of document 0772). At that point, if not earlier, the Lao Government says, Sanum was exposed to the ordinary tax rate, and any \"legal dispute\" about the New Tax Code arose at that time - at least a month before the critical date of 17 January 2012.\n\n138.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees with the Lao Government that, if the Sanum Flat Tax issue were shown to have been concluded in or before December 2011, the \"legal dispute\" over the New Tax Code ought to be held to have arisen prior to the critical date of 17 January 2012, despite the Claimant\u2019s view that greater formality would ordinarily be required to turn a potential legal dispute into an actual legal dispute.\n\n139.\n\nHowever, both Mr. Baldwin and Mr. Pipes have provided sworn testimony to demonstrate a reasonable expectation that the decision of the Minister of Finance was just a stepping stone in a longer process. In his Fourth Witness Statement dated 25 October 2013, Mr. Baldwin testifies:\n\nNotice No. 0772 informed us that the Government had rejected our FTA extension proposal. Although this notice was dated 28 November 2011, we did not receive it until 16 December 2011 - this again is typical of how the Lao Government operates. When we received this Notice, I was surprised. I spoke with **Madame Manivone about it, and she explained that she was instructed by the Minister of Finance to issue it.**  **She assured me, however, that the FTA would nonetheless be extended, and that she would help guide us through the process** **. She explained that we would now have to go through the Prime Minister\u2019s Office to obtain approval for the FTA extension,** and that we should resubmit our proposal directly to the Prime Minister. So, later that month, we submitted a new proposal to extend the FTA - containing the same proposed flat tax payments as those recommended by Madame Manivone in her 4 August 2011 report to the Minister of Finance - to the Prime Minister, (para. 20, Emphasis added)\n\n140.\n\nMr. Baldwin was available for cross-examination at the 6 January 2014 hearing. Ms. Manivone was not.\n\n141.\n\nMr. Bounnam says in his first Sworn Statement that:\n\n22. In January 2012, the Tax Department received a message from the Prime Minister\u2019s office, dated January 10, referring to another request from Sanum to extend the FTA. I have reviewed this document.\n\nHis redacted Statement sheds no light on what transpired in January 2012. In a further Sworn Statement dated 9 December 2013, Mr. Bounnam refers to work he did in relation to a letter from the Vice-Minister of Finance to the Prime Minister\u2019s office dated 10 February 2012 *(i.e. after* the critical date of 17 January 2012). However, if anything, his testimony simply indicates ongoing preparation for the meeting convened by the Prime Minister on 21 March 2012 to discuss Sanum\u2019s FTA proposal. Mr. Bounnam\u2019s statements raise more questions than they provide answers. This is not to say that Mr. Bounnam is to be disbelieved. However, his evidence is largely based on hearsay, is vague and uncertain in content, and (absent cross-examination) raises too many questions to be relied on by the Lao Government to establish that the FTA negotiations ended in December 2011.\n\n142.\n\nTherefore, **the Tribunal does not consider the letter of 28 November 2012 as a \"decision\" to reject Sanum\u2019s application, which could have triggered the dispute which is in front of the Tribunal.**\n\n143.\n\nMr. Pipes\u2019 Second Witness Statement sworn 2 August 2013 states that, even after the meeting with the Prime Minister and Deputy Prime Minister on 21 March 2012, Sanum was led to believe that the FTA extension was still a live issue within the Lao Government.\n\nIn March of 2012, we learned that members of the Government were opposed to our most recent proposal to extend the Savan Vegas Flat Tax Agreement, and we withdrew our proposal. But even after March 2012, we continued to believe that we would succeed in coming to an acceptable agreement for extension of the Flat Tax Agreement based on clear statements by Government representatives to that effect. **Because of those statements, and also because of other reassurances we had received from various Government officials that the new casino tax would not be applied to Savan Vegas, we believed that we would eventually resolve the issue presented by the new casino tax before the current Flat Tax Agreement expired,** (para. 11, Emphasis added)\n\n144.\n\nMr. Pipes thus refers to discussions of some sort *after* March 2012. However, Mr. Pipes is not specific about his \"sources\", nor does he identify the \"Government officials\" referred to, and this substantially lessens the weight of his testimony. This being said, from a jurisdictional perspective, the question whether the FTA negotiations continued after March 2012 is of little relevance. The Tribunal\u2019s concern is with 17 January 2012. In any event, to the extent the evidence of Mr. Pipes on this point was considered by the Lao Government to be of significance, he was present and available for cross-examination at the 6 January 2014 hearing and could have been cross-examined on those issues. This eventuality was avoided by the agreement of counsel, as explained below.\n\n145.\n\nHowever, for present purposes, the Tribunal puts no weight on whatever may subsequently have been said by the anonymous \"Government officials\" referred to but not identified by the Claimant.\n\n146.\n\n**It results from this analysis that it appears to the Tribunal on the analysis of the Claimant\u2019s evidence that the dispute arose on 21 March 2012, when the final decision not to grant a new FTA to Sanum was adopted at the highest level, in other words, that the dispute arose after the critical date.** It remains to verify whether the Lao Government has adduced credible contrary evidence on when the dispute arose.\n\n***3. The Failure of the Lao Government to Produce Satisfactory Factual Evidence on When a \"Legal Dispute\" Arose with Respect to the New Tax Code***\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n147.\n\nMs. Manivone would have been able to provide crucial evidence with respect to the Sanum negotiations, and in particular their progress (or lack of it) within the Lao Government, but, despite the Lao Government\u2019s initial statement that it would provide a witness statement from Ms. Manivone, none was ever provided to the Tribunal.43\n\nInitially, the Tribunal was told no such statement was filed because \"Ms. Manivone has left the country on holiday,\" (16 October 2013) and subsequently, on 11 December 2013, the Tribunal was advised that Ms. Manivone \"had to accompany her husband, a Lao senior soldier, to Vietnam on official business.\"\n\n148.\n\nThe Respondent instead chose to file witness statements from more peripheral Lao Government officials, including Mr. Bounnam (who as mentioned was not involved in the Sanum negotiations at the relevant time), as well as Mr. Souralay and Minister Sinlavong, neither of whom could shed much light on the actual state of negotiations.\n\n149.\n\nOn Friday 3 January 2014, three days before the hearing called to consider its own objection to jurisdiction, which had been scheduled three months before, the Respondent Lao Government advised the Tribunal that none of Mr. Bounnam, Mr. Souralay or Minister Sinlavong would be available for cross-examination on their witness statements.\n\n150.\n\nAs stated, both Mr. Baldwin and Mr. Pipes for the Claimant were available on 6 January 2014 for cross-examination.\n\n151.\n\nEventually counsel for the Parties reached an agreement that the Claimant\u2019s witness statements would be taken as read, some of the Laotian witness statements would be redacted, but as redacted would remain in evidence, that the two Laotian witness statements in respect of which the Claimant had waived cross-examination would be entered in full, and that no cross-examination would take place of anybody.44\n\nThe arrangement was put on the record in the 6 January 2014 Hearing Transcript, pp. 1-3:  \n MR BRANSON: I made a proposal; Mr Rivkin accepted it. I will let him explain it.  \nMR RIVKIN: Yes, I will explain the proposal and let me explain our thinking about it a little bit as well. The agreement we reached was that because Mr Branson has not arranged for any of his witnesses to be here for cross-examination, he will not cross-examine Mr Baldwin. All of the witness statements may be taken into the record, but Mr Branson proposed that we be able to redact certain portions of the witness statements of the three witnesses who did not appear for cross-examination. We had some back and forth yesterday and agreed on which sections would or would not be redacted. So we can provide -  \nPRESIDENT: Of the Respondent's witnesses?  \n MR RIVKIN: Yes. Mr Baldwin's witness statements are in in full.  \n PRESIDENT: Although he is not being cross-examined?  \n MR RIVKIN: Although he is not being cross-examined. The two witnesses whom we had decided not to cross, their witness statements are in in full. And the four witness statements by the three witnesses who were not brought for cross-examination can be admitted as redacted, and we will provide you with those redacted copies now.  \n (...)  \n PRESIDENT: Alright. Mr Branson, do you have anything to add to that?  \n MR BRANSON: Yes, I think it was irrelevant. I made the proposal so that both Parties would have equal treatment at the hearing. If they can't cross-examine our witnesses, then I shouldn't cross-examine their witnesses, so we have equal treatment. I also proposed that they could redact sections if they believed they might have been able to impeach, so that it would be equal on both sides. And I trust that our agreement signifies that there is equal treatment, and that one party won't be able to allege later that there was not equal treatment. That was the purpose of the proposal and the purpose of the acceptance.\n\n152.\n\nNevertheless, counsel agreed that:\n\n... neither side accepts the truth of what's in the witness statements, even the redacted witness statements, and we will have an opportunity to discuss that in our presentations, of course.\n\n153.\n\nThe Tribunal, of course, accepts the agreement of counsel with respect to the testimony. As a result of counsel\u2019s agreement, the Tribunal does not draw any adverse inferences regarding the witnesses on either side. **However, the Tribunal is still left with the problem of the onus of proof.** Has the Lao Government proven, as it set out to do, that the legal dispute regarding the application of the New Tax Code arose prior to the critical date of 17 January 2012? In the Tribunal\u2019s view, the Lao Government has not discharged its onus of proof of the facts.\n\n154.\n\nIn particular, the Tribunal is of the view that the Lao Government has failed to discharge its burden of proof to establish that the negotiations to renew the FTA had come to an end - and that therefore the application of the \"New Tax Code\" had become a \"legal dispute\" between the Parties as of the critical date - namely 17 January 2012. In fact, on the contrary, it would appear on the current record that the Sanum Flat Tax proposal was very much alive at the meeting in the Prime Minister\u2019s office on 21 March 2012.\n\n155.\n\nA similar situation existed in the *Pac Rim* case, where negotiations continued after the date when the Claimant considered that a dispute had arisen because of a \"final\" refusal of a gold exploitation permit:\n\n2.83. The Tribunal has taken particular note of the Claimant\u2019s belief that it received indications from the Salvadoran authorities, to the effect that the different permits and authorisations could yet be granted to its Enterprises. According to the Claimant, even if there were theoretical legal circumstances under which a government agency\u2019s failure to meet a statutory deadline could give rise to a dispute between an investor and **the Respondent, the conduct in this particular case of MARN, the Bureau of Mines and other government officials led the Claimant reasonably to understand that even though deadlines had been missed by these authorities, PRES's applications for a permit and a concession remained under consideration by the Salvadoran authorities.** Therefore, so the Claimant contends, having induced it to understand that despite the missed deadlines in 2004 or 2007 there was no dispute between the Parties, the Respondent is now effectively precluded, as a matter of law, from here arguing that the missed deadlines triggered the present dispute between the Claimant and the Respondent before December 2007.\n\n2.84. The Tribunal accepts the Claimant\u2019s submissions. It also notes that, even after March 2008, there were discussions between the Claimant and the Salvadoran authorities. In the Notice of Intent, it was specifically pleaded that: \"(i)n 2008, President Elias Antonio Saca was reported as having publicly stated that he opposed the granting of any outstanding mining permits. In light of President Saca\u2019s comments and the Government\u2019s actions and inactions, the Enterprises engaged in several meetings with the Government in 2008 seeking approval of the necessary permits.\" Accordingly, the Tribunal concludes that **the alleged omission to grant a permit and concession was not completely finalised before 13 December 2007, because even at that time there still seemed to be a reasonable possibility, as understood by the Claimant, to receive such permit and concession notwithstanding the passage of time.** (Emphasis added)\n\n156.\n\nIn other words, the case at hand presents a similar situation, because (to track the language of the *Pac Rim* decision) the Lao Government has failed to demonstrate that the FTA negotiations had been finalized before 17 January 2012 and even at that time there still seemed a reasonable possibility as understood by the Claimant, basing itself on objective facts, that such negotiations would lead to a renewal of the FTA on mutually satisfactory terms. On the record before the Tribunal the negotiations continued until 21 March 2012.\n\n157.\n\nIt is unnecessary for the Tribunal to decide whether the FTA issue died as a result of the decision taken by the Prime Minister on that date.\n\n**V. DISPOSITION BY THE TRIBUNAL OF THE RESPONDENT\u2019S OBJECTION TOJURISDICTION** ***RATIONE TEMPORIS***\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n158.\n\nThe Tribunal rejects the jurisdictional challenge on the basis that the Lao Government has not met the burden of showing that a legal dispute with respect to the application of the New Tax Code had arisen on or before the critical date of 17 January 2012. The Tribunal concludes on the present record that the FTA negotiations continued after that date and, until those negotiations ended, the application of the New Tax Code was a mere possibility that was not yet ripe for a \"legal dispute\" to arise.\n\n**VI. DISPOSITION OF APPLICATION FOR COSTS**\n--------------------------------------------\n\n159.\n\nThe Tribunal does not see fit to make any award of costs at this stage of the proceeding.\n\n**VII. ISSUES NOT DECIDED BY THE TRIBUNAL**\n-------------------------------------------\n\n160.\n\nIn light of its disposition of the Flat Tax issue, it is unnecessary for the Tribunal to decide - and it does not decide - with regard to the Claimant\u2019s alternate arguments in opposition to the jurisdictional objection. The Tribunal also wishes to be clear that it makes no findings of fact in relation to the dispute other than those necessary to the consideration and disposal of the Respondent\u2019s objection to jurisdiction *ratione temporis.*"}, {"Title": "Decision on Claimant\u2019s Request", "Type": "Other", "Date": "2014-04-16T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Decision on Claimant\u2019s Request\n------------------------------\n\n1.\n\nThe Respondent acknowledges that Order 04/PM apparently dated 14 January, 2014, which purported to rescind the Prime Minister's earlier order 30/PM dated 4 November, 2013 commanding compliance with the PMO, was issued in error. The government has apologized for its mistake but we are now advised that due to the Prime Minister's state visit to China no formal rectification of the situation is possible until the week of 21 April, 2014, and even then issuance of a rectifying order is promised simply \u201cas soon as possible\u201d (Werner Tsu e-mail dated 8 April, 2014). Considering that the 04/PM problem was drawn to the attention of counsel for the Respondent on 29 March, 2014, and that in the meantime the \u201cerroneous\u201d order 04/PM remains in effect, the delay in rescinding Order 04/PM is in clear and continuing violation of the PMO. Even if for logistical reasons it is not practicable to rescind in a formal way 04/PM until the Prime Minister's return, it is within the Respondent's power to communicate the fact 04/PM was issued in \u201cerror\u201d to the relevant government officials, and in particular to the \u201cgovernment officials who deal with the Claimant's investments\u201d listed by the Claimant in its letter of 22 January, 2014 and referred to by the Claimant at page 2 of its 29 March, 2014 letter, immediately. Accordingly the Respondent is required to undertake such notification forthwith and to advise the Tribunal when this has been done. The Respondent has undertaken to arrange for the formal rescission of 04/PM as soon as \u201cpossible\u201d after the Prime Minister's return from China. Counsel for the Respondent is to advise the Tribunal and the other parties as soon as this \u201cformal\u201d rescission has been completed.\n\n2.\n\nWith respect to the disputed tax collection under Notice 0443 dated 28 March, 2014, the Tribunal considers paragraph 30(1) of the PMO to be perfectly clear when it states that the Respondent government is enjoined from \u201cdemanding that Claimant pay any amounts allegedly due pursuant to the New Tax Law\u201d following expiry of the Flat Tax Agreement on 31 December, 2013, conditional upon the Claimant complying with the escrow arrangement referred to in paragraph 30 (4) of the PMO. In other words the focus of the PMO is not limited to the modified 80% rate imposed on casino revenue by the New Tax Law. The PMO covers all taxes \u201callegedly due\u201d pursuant to the New Tax Law in its entirety. There is no exemption for tax on \u201cnon-casino gaming revenues\u201d, despite the apparent misunderstanding of Mr Nammavong in his statement of 8 April, 2014. The Tribunal is advised by the Claimant, and it has not been disputed by the Respondent, that the taxes that are referred to in Notice 0443, are covered by articles 12, 13, 14, 15, 26 et seq and 43 et seq of the New Tax Law. Accordingly the Respondent is required forthwith to reimburse Savan Vegas by government cheque the amount of taxes collected pursuant to Notice 0443, and to refrain from further tax collection under the new Tax Law as required by the PMO until these proceedings are resolved.\n\n3.\n\nWith regard to Madame Sengkeo, the Respondent acknowledges that \u201cthe conduct alleged would, if true, be in violation of the Decision for Provisional Measures of 17 September, 2013 (PMO)\u201d. To the extent cross-allegations are made against the Claimant, the Claimant acknowledges that \u201ccoercion of a witness is a serious matter\u201d, as would, the Tribunal adds, be suborning false evidence in any fashion. Indeed, Mr Branson states in his letter of 14 April 2014 at pp 2-3 that \u201csuch conduct would be in violation of the parties' duties to the Tribunal even absent the provisional measures\u201d. The Tribunal agrees. To the extent the situation of Madame Sengkeo is bound up with the Respondent's request to vary the PMO to permit an investigation of allegations of corruption in relation to the Claimant's investments, the relationship between the arbitral proceedings and the proposed criminal investigation will be the subject of an oral hearing in London on 12 May, 2014. To the extent the situation of Madame Sengkeo is limited to issues of proof at the 12 May hearing, and is unrelated to the proposed criminal investigations, the prohibition against witness tampering is still absolute. Although the Claimant refers to at least one recent unwelcome contact between Madame Sengkeo and government officials, the Claimant does not identify any of the officials in question. Mr Branson advises that he discussed \u201cthe Sengkeo evidence with the senior Committee members on April 2, 2014. They had not had any contact at any time with Ms Sengkeo\u201d, and Mr Branson's letter continues, \u201cThey are certain that no person in the Government who has any authority or responsibility for this case has had any contact with Ms Sengkeo in connection with this case, and they are not aware that any unauthorized Government person has met with her, much less threated her.\u201d (Mr Branson letter, ibid, p 2) In the absence of any particulars from the Claimant regarding the identities of the offending government officials who seek to \u201ccoerce false testimony from her\u201d, or the individual(s) at ST who seek to \u201ccoerce her cooperation\u201d, an exceptionally serious set of allegations, the Tribunal does not think it necessary to add further language to the PMO with respect to the situation of Madame Sengkeo at this time. The parties agree on the absolute duty to refrain from witness tampering of any description, both under the PMO and otherwise, and if in future particulars of any such conduct are established, whether conduct by government officials directly or (as also alleged by the Claimant) indirectly using ST \u201cas an intermediary\u201d, or by or on behalf of the Claimant, the consequences will be severe.\n\n4.\n\nThere is some discussion in the material as to whether certain allegations made by the parties for the purpose of the 12 May hearing will be considered by the Tribunal to be \u201cpresumptively\u201d established. This is not so. In the next phase of these hearings, as in the jurisdictional challenge heard by the Tribunal in January 2014, the party alleging facts will be expected to prove them on a balance of probabilities."}, {"Title": "Ruling on Motion to Amend the Provisional Measures Order", "Type": "Interim & Provisional Measures", "Date": "2014-05-30T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Ruling on Motion to Amend the Provisional Measures Order\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n**I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL ASPECTS**\n-------------------------------------\n\n***The relief requested: The application is for the modification not the original making of a provisional measures order***\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1.\n\nThe Respondent Government of the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (herein referred to as the \"Respondent\" or the \"Respondent Government\") seeks amendment to the Provisional Measures Order (\"PMO\") dated September 17, 2013 in respect of the prohibition \"against taking any steps that would alter the *status quo ante* or aggravate the dispute.\" The requested modification would permit the Respondent to further its criminal investigation into alleged illegal conduct by employees of the Claimant, as well as the alleged corruption of officials of the Respondent Government connected with the investments that are the subject matter of the arbitration. The modification request, as redrafted by the Respondent at the hearing of this application on 12 May 2014, is the following:\n\n*Respondent shall be permitted to investigate criminal activity by:*\n\n*(1) Obtaining relevant documents in Laos;*\n\n*(2) Interviewing and deposing potential witnesses; and*\n\n*(3) Seeking assistance from the government and courts of the United States or other countries or international organizations in connection with those activities;*\n\n*Provided that:*\n\n*(1) Opposing counsel will be provided notice and invited to attend any interview or deposition of a potential witness; and*\n\n*(2) Respondent will provide to claimant\u2019s counsel copies of all documents it obtains pursuant to this authority;*\n\n*And further provided that, prior to the hearing on the merits:*\n\n*(3) Respondent will not attempt to interview or otherwise contact any current Sanum or Savan Vegas employee;*\n\n*(4) Respondent will not seize any records from Sanum or Savan Vegas in Laos.*\n\n*And further provided that:*\n\n*Respondent shall not prohibit claimant from transferring funds outside Laos provided that claimant uses Laos banks or otherwise complies with Laos banking laws.*\n\n***The subject matter of the arbitration***\n-------------------------------------------\n\n2.\n\nThe Claimant investor contends that the Respondent has through confiscatory taxation and other measures contrary to its treaty obligations effectively expropriated the Claimant\u2019s investment in gambling and related businesses located in Laos. The investments were made through affiliated corporations, including Sanum Investments Ltd., and pursuant to a joint venture agreement with ST, a Laotian company owned by Laotian nationals. The joint venture resulted in three major projects, The Savan Vegas Hotel and Casino (\"Savan Vegas\"), The Paksong Vegas Hotel and Casino (\"Paksong Vegas\") and a third enterprise that invested in slot machine clubs in at least three locations in Laos, namely Thanaleng, Lao Bao and the Ferry Terminal. The Claimant values its loss at hundreds of millions of dollars. In addition to denying any *de facto* expropriation or other unfair or improper conduct, the Respondent now asserts in its Counter-Memorial and Counterclaim, dated 20 February 2014, that the Claimant\u2019s investment is tainted by bribery, embezzlement and money-laundering.\n\n3.\n\nThe Respondent\u2019s motion to vary the PMO was launched on February 20, 2014. In the intervening weeks the allegations and cross-allegations of serious misconduct have multiplied. The hearing on the merits of this arbitration is scheduled to commence in Singapore on 17 June 2014. The parties are in the midst of trial preparation.\n\n4.\n\nThe Tribunal dismisses the application for the following reasons:\n\nIn the Tribunal\u2019s view, once the Respondent had formally put in issue the allegations of illegal conduct by or on behalf of the Claimant, the alleged \"illegalities\" became part of the \"dispute\" before this Tribunal. The Respondent has not established the requisite ground on which to modify the existing PMO to allow it to pursue concurrent criminal proceedings arising out of the same facts and at the same time as the arbitration. In particular:\n\ni. the Respondent, prior to the making of the PMO, advised the Tribunal that \"Lao Court proceedings to hold Claimant to account for $20 million in back taxes and the investigation into money laundering have been stayed due to this arbitration, because the Government has made conciliatory efforts to allow the arbitration process to proceed in an environment conducive to timely action by the Tribunal.\" (E-mail dated 28 August 2013) (emphasis added);\n\nii. the Respondent, based on its \"conciliatory\" position, consented to the provision in the PMO \"against taking any steps that would alter the *status quo ante* or aggravate the dispute;\"\n\niii. criminal proceedings launched in the midst of final preparations for the arbitration, and running concurrently with the hearing would considerably broaden and aggravate the dispute between the parties, in threatening the integrity of the arbitral process; and\n\niv. the Respondent has not established a change of circumstances sufficient to justify its proposed modification of the PMO or the necessity and urgency for so doing on the eve of the merits hearing.\n\n***The factual basis for the present application to modify the Provisional Measures Order***\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n5.\n\nThe Respondent says it has \"unearthed substantial evidence of violations of Laotian criminal law by the Claimant and its ultimate owners, John Baldwin and Shawn Scott\" and some of their employees and agents. *[Motion to Amend PMO,* 20 February 2014 at para. 4] The principal allegations of criminal conduct include:\n\ni. bribery of an unidentified official of the Respondent Government to terminate an ongoing government-ordered audit of Savan Vegas Casino by Ernst & Young (\"E&Y\") on 10 July 2012. According to the Respondent:\n\nThe bribe stopping the audit has deprived the [Respondent] of a conclusive opinion from E&Y... if the audit had been completed, E&Y would have concluded that Sanum had embezzled substantial sums from its Sanum Vegas operations and engaged in pervasive money laundering. *[Motion to Amend PMO,* 20 February 2014 at paras. 34-35]\n\nThe Claimant denies having tried to stop the audit. On the contrary, it points to communications protesting its premature termination. Moreover, an internal E&Y memo dated 25 September 2012 reports that the Respondent Government \"is not happy with our [E&Y] report due to the report does not support MOF [Ministry of Finance] on the law sue [suit] (sic)\" [Exhibit C-483.];\n\nii. an allegation of potential bribery (the \"documents raise questions\") of an official in the Respondent\u2019s Ministry of Finance, Ms. Manivone Insisiengmai, to support and promote an extension of the Flat Tax Agreement between the Claimant and the Respondent otherwise due to expire on 31 December 2013. The Claimant denies the allegation. The Flat Tax Agreement was not extended. The failure to extend it is one of the Claimant\u2019s complaints in the arbitration;\n\niii. attempted corruption of a former Prime Minister with a \"cash bribe of $7 million\" to obtain permission to open a casino in the capital city, Vientiane (*Motion to Amend PMO,* 20 February 2014, para. 50). The Claimant denies any such attempt, points out that permission for its proposal was denied, and explains that the $7 million letter was sent to satisfy the standard requirement that proposed investors provide the government with evidence of sufficient financial strength to implement their development proposals;\n\niv. various other amounts of cash the Respondent says were paid by the Claimant directly or through intermediaries to bribe government officials. In some cases, the basis of the allegation is an entry in a general ledger disclosed in the previously mentioned E&Y report of 20 July 2012. The Claimant acknowledges the payments shown on the general ledger of Savan Vegas were made but says Laos is a \"cash economy\" and the payments were legitimate fees for consulting or other services and were retained, as intended, by the identified recipients for their own benefit.\n\nv. it is further alleged that the Claimant engaged in a \"massive scheme of money laundering depositing $21 million into Thai banks in 2011 alone.\" *[Motion to Amend PMO,* 20 February 2014, para. 68]. The Claimant denies money laundering and says deposits in Thai banks were legitimate receipts in Thai currency from Thai \"junket operators\" or other Thai businesses and gamblers;\n\nvi. the Respondent contends that the Claimant\u2019s casino records produced to E&Y in 2012, including the general ledgers from 2009, 2010 and 2011, show \"a clear pattern of embezzlement.\" *[Motion to Amend PMO,* para. 73] Moreover \"there is also evidence that illegal transfers were made from Savan Vegas to Baldwin\u2019s and Scott\u2019s two new businesses in Cambodia.\" [*Motion to Amend PMO,* para. 80] The Claimant denies embezzlement and says the recorded \"transfers\" were perfectly legitimate inter-corporate transactions.\n\n6.\n\nIn summary, the Respondent alleges serious potential criminal behaviour by or on behalf of the Claimant in relation to Respondent government officials. The Claimant does not dispute the payments to which it was a party, but offers a different explanation of their purpose. It says the recipients were not \"intermediaries\" and that it will establish the truth of its position at the Singapore merits hearing.\n\n7.\n\nThe Claimant denies unlawful activity. No corruption. No money laundering. No embezzlement. Its position is that the Respondent is simply seeking improperly to use its criminal law machinery to collect evidence on the eve of the June arbitration hearing to advance its defence on the merits in the current arbitral proceeding.\n\n**II. THE TRIBUNAL\u2019S ANALYSIS**\n-------------------------------\n\n***The authority to modify provisional measures and the scope of such authority***\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n8.\n\nThere is no doubt that the Tribunal has the authority to modify a decision on provisional measures. This is stated in ICSID Additional Facility Rules, Article 46(1): \"Unless the arbitration agreement otherwise provides, either party may *at any time* during the proceeding request that provisional measures for the preservation of its rights be ordered by the Tribunal.\" (Emphasis added).\n\n9.\n\nSuch a modification has to be based on changed circumstances, which make it urgent and necessary to adopt a new decision on provisional measures, which can suspend, terminate or modify the scope of the provisional measures initially granted.\n\n***The burden of proof***\n-------------------------\n\n10.\n\nThe Respondent contends that a Claimant must overcome a \"particularly high threshold\" before a criminal investigation may be enjoined. [Resp. Reply para. 47] In this case however the PMO agreed to by the Respondent, already enjoins conduct disruptive of the *status quo ante,* to protect the integrity of the arbitration. As mentioned, the Respondent consented to the non-aggravation provision, notwithstanding its expressed concern about money laundering and embezzlement. It is therefore incumbent on the Respondent to establish a change of circumstances sufficient to justify its proposed modification, as well as the necessity and urgency for so doing on the eve of the merits hearing.\n\n***The rights to be preserved by the granting or modification of provisional measures***\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n11.\n\nIt is the Tribunal\u2019s view that the rights which may form the basis for a recommendation of provisional measures or a modification of such by an ICSID tribunal are not to be limited to the rights which form the subject matter of the dispute before the Tribunal on the merits. Other rights relating to the dispute, among them procedural rights, can also be protected by provisional measures. However, it has to be emphasized that not every right a Claimant considers to be in danger can be protected through provisional measures. To be so protected, the right must be related to the dispute. As emphasized by the tribunal in *Plama Consortium Ltd. v. Bulgaria,* if rights other than those forming the very subject matter of the dispute in the arbitration are invoked as requiring protection, those rights must nonetheless relate to the specific dispute before the arbitral tribunal, and to the claims made and relief sought therein:\n\n\"The rights to be preserved... may be general rights, such as the rights to due process or the **right not to have the dispute aggravated,** but those general rights must be **related to the specific disputes in arbitration,** which, in turn, are defined by the Claimant's claims and requests for relief to date.\"1\n\n*Plama Consortium* v. *Bulgaria,*.ICSID Case No. ARB/03/24, Order on Provisional Measures, Sept. 6, 2005, at para. 40.\n\n12.\n\nThe right which is at stake in this request for a modification of the initial provisional measures are the rights to the *status quo ante* and to the non-aggravation of the dispute. As stated by the Tribunal in *Burlington v. Ecuador,* these latter rights are self-standing rights.2\n\n*Burlington* v. *Ecuador,* Procedural Order No. 1 of 29 June 2009, para. 60.\n\n13.\n\nMore precisely, in general, provisional measures, when granted as measures necessary to prevent the aggravation of the dispute, have concerned the behaviour of the parties in dispute, whether they were measures necessary to maintain - or restore - peace between the parties, or to prevent one party from starting or pursuing other litigation, for example in the national courts, that could directly undermine the international proceedings. As stated in Procedural Order No. 3 in *Biwater Gauff v. Tanzania.*\n\nIt is now settled in both treaty and international commercial arbitration that an arbitral tribunal is entitled to direct the parties not to take any step that might **(1) harm or prejudice the integrity of the proceedings, or (2) aggravate or exacerbate the dispute. [...]** Both concerns have a number of aspects, which can be articulated in various ways, such as the need to:\n\n\u2014 preserve the Tribunal\u2019s mission and mandate to determine finally the issues between the parties;\n\n\u2014 preserve the proper functioning of the dispute settlement procedure;\n\n\u2014 preserve and promote a relationship of trust and confidence between the parties;\n\n\u2014 ensure the orderly unfolding of the arbitration process;\n\n\u2014 ensure a level playing field;\n\n\u2014 minimise the scope for any external pressure on any party, witness, expert or other participant in the process;\n\n\u2014 avoid \"trial by media.\"3\n\n*Biwater Gauff* v. *Tanzania,* ICSID Case ARB/05/22, Procedural Order No.3, 29 Sept. 2006, at para. 135. Emphasis added.\n\n14.\n\nThe issue here, however, is whether the right to the non-aggravation of the dispute set out in the PMO, prevented the Respondent from pursuing the intended criminal investigation whether at the time of the issuance of the PMO or now on the eve of the merits hearing. As will appear below, the answer was not the same in September 2013 as it became in February 2014: initially, the general rule that a State ought not to be prevented from enforcing its criminal law in the usual way applied. However, at the time the present Motion to Amend the PMO was made, events related to the conduct of the Respondent had developed to the point where, exceptionally, the initiation of a criminal investigation would so seriously disturb the *status quo ante* as to threaten the integrity of the arbitral process.\n\n***The principle of non-aggravation of the dispute and its relation with the launching of a criminal procedure***\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n15.\n\nThe Respondent readily acknowledges the fundamental principle that the *status quo ante* should be protected while the arbitration proceeds, so that the dispute is not aggravated. Accordingly, while the PMO was made after a proceeding that was protracted and contested on some issues, the Respondent consented to para. 30(5) which enjoined \"both parties from taking any steps that would alter the *status quo ante,* or aggravate the dispute.\" The \"nonaggravation\" clause agreed to by the parties reflects the more elaborate formulation of the principle in *Tokios Tokeles* v. *Ukraine,* Case No. ARB/02/18, Order No. 1, para 2 (ICSID, 1 July 2003):\n\n... parties to a dispute over which ICSID has jurisdiction must refrain from any measure capable of having a prejudicial effect on the rendering or implementation of an eventual ICSID award or decision, and in general refrain from any action of any kind which might aggravate or extend the dispute or render its resolution more difficult.\n\n16.\n\nIn the making of the PMO dated 17 September 2013, the Tribunal satisfied itself, as it was required to do, that in the absence of such an order there was \"a real and imminent risk that irreparable prejudice may be caused to the rights in dispute\" before a decision could be given on the merits: *Belgium v. Senegal, Provisional Measures, Order* of 28 May 2009, I.C.J. Reports 2009, pp. 152-153, para. 62. However, the possibility of a criminal investigation was not specifically addressed at the PMO hearing on 2 September 2013 or in the PMO as issued.\n\n17.\n\nThe Tribunal wishes to make it clear that the PMO did not, and could not in such general terms inhibit the Respondent\u2019s anti-corruption drive. The criminal laws of the Respondent prohibit bribery, embezzlement and money laundering. Finance Minister Phouphet in a statement filed with the Tribunal, advised that Laos is a party to the *United Nations Convention Against Corruption* and is committed to its enforcement. The PMO did not purport to inhibit the Respondent from investigating the possible corruption of its own officials or others doing business with government.\n\n18.\n\nThe Tribunal considers it necessary here to restate the principles applicable to the relations between an ICSID arbitration and local court proceedings, be they civil or criminal.\n\n19.\n\nThe Tribunal recalls that there is a right to the exclusive jurisdiction of ICSID, once an ICSID arbitration is started, as was clearly expressed by the tribunal in *Tokios Tokeles* v. *Ukraine,* which stated:\n\n\"Among the rights that may be protected by provisional measures is the right guaranteed by Article 26 to have the ICSID arbitration be the exclusive remedy for the dispute to the exclusion of any other remedy, whether domestic or international, judicial or administrative.\"4\n\n*Tokios Tokeles* v. *Ukraine,* ICSID Case No. ARB/02/18, Order No. 3, 18 January 2005, at para. 7.\n\n20.\n\nA similar view was expressed by the ICSID tribunal in *Plama Consortium Ltd.* v. *Bulgaria:*\n\n\"Provisional measures are appropriate to preserve the exclusivity of ICSID arbitration to the exclusion of local administrative or judicial remedies as prescribed in Article 26 of the ICSID Convention. They are also appropriate to prevent parties from taking measures capable of having prejudicial effect on the rendering of an eventual award [...].\"5\n\n*Plama Consortium Ltd. v. Bulgaria,* ICSID Case No ARB/03/24, Order, 6 Sept. 2005 at para. 38.\n\n21.\n\nThis rule however applies only to civil proceedings having the same parties and same subject matter as the arbitral proceeding and does not concern criminal procedures. The ICSID Convention extends only to investment disputes. In this case, the criminal provisions at issue are not *ad hoc* measures aimed at influencing the outcome of the dispute but the ordinary criminal laws of general application prohibiting bribery, corruption, money laundering and embezzlement. Issues of such criminal liability by definition fall outside the scope of the Centre\u2019s jurisdiction and the competence of this Tribunal. Neither the ICSID Convention nor the BIT imposes a prohibition on a State that enjoins it from exercising criminal jurisdiction over such matters. In particular, they do not exempt suspected criminals from investigation or prosecution by virtue of their being investors. The Tribunal rejects any suggestion that ordinary domestic criminal law of general application was intended to be or is constrained by the initiation of ICSID proceedings under the BIT. As expressed by the Respondent, \"[a]n arbitration clause is not a license for general lawlessness.\"6\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply in Support of its Motion to amend the decision on Provisional measures, para. 39.\n\n22.\n\nThis has been recently confirmed in *Abaclat v. The Argentine Republic,* where the panel wrote that an \"Arbitral Tribunal can in principle not prohibit a Party from conducting criminal court proceedings before competent state authorities.\"7\n\nCase No. ARB/07/5, Procedural Order No. 13, paras 39, 45 (ICSID Sept. 27, 2012).\n\n23.\n\nTherefore, the Tribunal agrees in principle with the Respondent\u2019s assertion of its sovereign right to pursue a criminal investigation both within Laos as well as invoking the assistance of other states, but, as will be mentioned below, the facts here are unusual given the history of the dispute and the Respondent\u2019s belated application to involve the prosecutors and police at a time of final trial preparation for the arbitration. The Tribunal takes note with satisfaction of the Statement of Mr Phouphet Khamphounvong, Minister of Finance of Laos:\n\nThe Government has struggled for many years to improve the investment climate for foreign investment... The Government is a party to and has ratified the United Nations Convention Against Corruption.\n\nDomestically, the Government has enacted laws to make bribery, money laundering and embezzlement criminal offenses.\n\nIt is necessary that the Sovereign be allowed to investigate criminal activity under its criminal laws and to utilize assistance of the United States under the United Nations Convention Against Corruption.\n\n24.\n\nIt is on this basis of a right of the State to enforce its criminal laws, that \"Respondent submits that the facts stated above justify the Request made by Minister of Finance Phouphet to amend the decision of September 17, 2013 to allow the Government to initiate proper investigations into criminal conduct. That is a right and obligation of the Sovereign under its domestic laws and international treaties. The Laos-Netherlands BIT states in Article 2 that investments are made \"subject to [Lao PRD] rights to exercise powers conferred by its laws or regulations....\"8\n\nRespondent\u2019s Motion to Amend the Decision of September 17, 2013 on Provisional Measures, para. 85.\n\n25.\n\nLaos has the sovereign power to prosecute conduct that may constitute a crime on its own territory if it has sufficient evidence to justify prosecution. Laos also has the power to investigate whether Claimants made their investments in Laos in accordance with the legal requirements of the laws of general application. However, such prosecutorial powers of course must be exercised in good faith and with due respect for Claimants\u2019 rights. In fact it is evident from some of the records placed before the Tribunal on this application, including the private bank records of a private Laotian citizen Mme Sengkeo obtained in or about January 2014, that the Respondent\u2019s investigation into potential unlawful conduct related to the Claimant\u2019s investment has been ongoing for some time despite the existence of the PMO: this was not in violation of the PMO because, as of the making of the PMO on 17 September 2013 \"the dispute\" referred to in the non-aggravation clause was the dispute with regard to the allegation that the government breached its treaty obligations, not the misconduct now alleged against the Claimant.\n\n26.\n\nThis general rule having been reaffirmed by the Tribunal, however, there are however a number of exceptional circumstances in this case which lead the Tribunal to depart from the general rule entitling a State to enforce on the national level its criminal laws. In particular, the Tribunal is satisfied on the evidence that the primary purpose for which the Respondent intends to use the powers of criminal investigation, at least in the first instance, is to collect evidence for use at the arbitration, which, in the result, will undermine the integrity of the arbitral process.\n\n***There is to-day a direct relationship between the proposed criminal investigation contemplated by the PMO modification and the arbitration proceeding***\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n27.\n\nThe Respondent\u2019s position is that while the criminal investigation may (or may not) generate sufficient evidence to initiate criminal charges, any evidence turned up by the investigation of assistance to the Respondent\u2019s case in the arbitration will be so used. Respondent\u2019s counsel advised the Tribunal at the 12 May 2014 hearing that:\n\n... if we got the information and it was relevant to the information, we could use it in the arbitration but some of it is not relevant to the arbitration. (Emphasis added, Transcript p. 25)\n\n...\n\nNow, for example, let\u2019s assume that we are able to take the deposition of Mr. Douglas and Mr. Kochel in the next month, well that information would be available to the Tribunal at the hearing. It would also be information available to the United States Department of Justice, and to the Laos Anti-Corruption Office. But they don\u2019t have to overlap. If they do, okay; if they don\u2019t, that\u2019s okay too. (Emphasis added, Transcript p. 27).\n\n28.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that through these statements, Laos has admitted that at least one of the objectives of the threatened criminal proceeding is to enable it to develop evidence that will serve as part of its defense in the present arbitration proceedings. As a consequence, there is no doubt that the criminal investigation intended by the Respondent is directed at precisely the conduct in respect of which it requires evidence to defend its claim in the arbitration and support its Counterclaim.9\n\nIndeed, much of the language in the Respondent\u2019s *Motion to Amend* dated 20 February 2014, under the heading, *\"Evidence of bribes and attempted bribes\"* is faithfully reproduced in its Counter-Memorial of the same date under the heading \"Claimant\u2019s Unlawful Acts of Bribery, Embezzlement and Money Laundering Warrant Dismissal of its Claims\", as follows:  \n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ***Respondent\u2019s Motion to Amend the Provisional Measures Order 20 February 2014*** | ***Respondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial dated 20 February 2014*** |\n\n  \n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **1. EVIDENCE OF BRIBES AND****ATTEMPTED BRIBES** 16. Bribery is a serious criminal offense under Lao Law. The Lao Penal Law specifically prohibits any person from \"bribing or agreeing to bribe a civil servant.\" Persons who violate the law are subject to up to two years of imprisonment, plus a fine equal to the amount or value of the bribe, or - if the bribe was \"substantial\" -up to five years of imprisonment, plus a fine equal to twice the amount or value of the bribe. Under Lao law, a bribe occurs whenever a government official \"receive[s], claim[s], request[s], or agree[s] to accept material items or benefit from someone else\" in exchange for \"using one\u2019s position, power and duties to provide direct or indirect benefit to the person giving the bribe.\" 17. Laos\u2019s prohibition on bribery reflects public policies of the highest order. In 2005, Laos promulgated its Law on Anti-Corruption, which supplemented existing law by imposing criminal penalties for ***taking***  bribes. Government officials \"with position, power and duty\" are specifically prohibited from \"receive[ing] money, material items, or other benefits from any individual or organization that relates to his functions which cause damages to the interests of the State and society, or the rights and interests of citizens.\" Confirming the importance of the issue, in 2009 the Lao Government ratified the United Nations Convention Against Corruption, which specifically targets bribery of Government officials. 18. Sanum violated all those criminal prohibitions during its reign of corruption in Laos. | **B. Claimant\u2019s Unlawful Acts of Bribery,****Embezzlement, and Money Laundering Warrant Dismissal of its Claims****1. Evidence of Bribes and Attempted Bribes** 63. Bribery is a serious criminal offense under Lao Law. The Lao Penal Law specifically prohibits any person from \"bribing or agreeing to bribe a civil servant.\" Persons who violate the law are subject to up to two years of imprisonment, plus a fine equal to the amount or value of the bribe, or - if the bribe was \"substantial\" -up to five years of imprisonment, plus a fine equal to twice the amount or value of the bribe.

Claimant violated all those criminal prohibitions during its reign of corruption in Laos. |\n\n29.\n\nThis would however not necessarily be sufficient as a basis for enjoining a State to pursue a criminal case on its territory. As was stated by the tribunal in *Quiborax,* in a situation of the same type as the one encountered here:\n\nThus, the Tribunal finds that the criminal proceedings initiated by Respondent do not threaten the exclusivity of the ICSID proceedings. Even if the criminal proceedings result in evidence that is later used by Respondent in this arbitration, that would not undermine the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction to resolve Claimants\u2019 claims, if such jurisdiction is established at the appropriate procedural instance. [\u00a7 130]\n\n...\n\nThe Tribunal agrees with Claimants that the criminal proceedings exacerbate the climate of hostility in which the dispute is unfolding...[but] the Tribunal cannot concur with Claimants\" argument that the criminal proceedings have changed the status quo of the dispute... If there are legitimate grounds for the criminal proceedings, Claimants must bear the burden of their conduct in Bolivia. [\u00a7 138]\n\n30.\n\nIn other words, a criminal proceeding does not *per se* violate the principle of exclusivity of ICSID arbitration, or aggravate the dispute. *Something more* has to be at stake to justify a tribunal enjoining a State to suspend or defer a criminal investigation. The Tribunal is convinced that such exceptional circumstances exist in this case.\n\n31.\n\nIndeed, a number of indicia lead the Tribunal to consider that allowing at this stage the Laotian police and prosecutors to pursue criminal proceedings, depose witnesses and collect documentation would aggravate the dispute in the prohibited sense of harming the integrity of the arbitral process.\n\n32.\n\nWhat is now being sought, a month before the merits hearing, is an intrusive criminal investigation of potential witnesses during the period of final trial preparation. Rule 1782(a) of the *United States Code,* sought to be invoked by the Respondent, may according to its terms, be used in aid of criminal investigations conducted even before formal accusation10. A criminal investigation, according to the Claimant, crosses the line between the government\u2019s general concern about corruption and enters the forbidden territory of using the process of the criminal law to obtain an unfair advantage in the arbitration proceedings over the Claimant, aggravating the inequality of arms between the parties.\n\nRule 1782(a) *[Assistance to foreign and international tribunals and to litigants before such tribunals.]* reads in part:  \n The district court of the district in which a person resides or is found may order him to give his testimony or statement or to produce a document or other thing for use in a proceeding in a foreign or international tribunal, including criminal investigations conducted before formal accusation. The order may be made pursuant to a letter rogatory issued, or request made, by a foreign or international tribunal or upon the application of any interested person...\n\n33.\n\nThe position of the Respondent is that the conduct of a criminal investigation in this case on the terms it proposes would have little if any impact on the arbitration. There may well exist the sort of confrontation or hostility inherent in any criminal investigation it says, but this sort of thing is well below the threshold that would justify an ICSID Tribunal imposing a restraint on a sovereign right to investigate crime. In this respect, the Respondent relies upon the observation of the ICSID panel in *Caratube v. Kazakhstan:11*\n\nCriminal investigations and measures taken by a state in that context require special considerations. They are a most obvious and undisputed part of the sovereign right of a state to implement and enforce its national law on its territory. (para. 134)\n\nThe Tribunal feels that a particularly high threshold must be overcome before an ICSID Tribunal can indeed recommend provisional measures regarding criminal investigations conducted by a State. (para. 137)\n\nSee also Burlington Resources Inc v Republic of Equador, Case No. ARB/08/5, Procedural Order No 1 on Request for Provisional Measures (ICSID June 29, 2009, (CLA-129).\n\n*Caratube International Oil Co. LLP v. Republic of Kazakhstan,* Case No. ARB/08/12, Decision Regarding Claimant\u2019s Application for Provisional Measures at para. 137 (ICSID, 31 July 2009 [RA 129].\n\n34.\n\nNevertheless various ICSID panels have ordered a stay or deferral of criminal investigations in appropriate circumstances: *Tokios Tokeles v. Ukraine,* Case No. ARB/02/18, Order No. 3 at para 11 (ICSID, 18 January 2005) [CLA 160]; *City Oriente Limited v. Ecuador and Empresa Estatal Petroleos del Ecuador (PetroEcuador),* Case No. ARB/06/21, Decision on Provisional Measures at paras 61-66 (ICSID, 19 November 2007) [CLA 132]; *Quiborax, S.A., Non Metallic Minerals S.A. & Allan Fosk Kaplun v. Plurinational State of Bolivia,* Case No. ARB/06/2, Decision on Provisional Measures paras 118, 122 (ICSID, 26 February 2010).\n\n35.\n\nAs always, the authorities are very fact sensitive. The Tribunal considers that the \"high threshold\" allowing a tribunal to prevent a State from pursuing criminal investigations in its national legal order has been overcome in this case.\n\n36.\n\nThe Tribunal has come to the conclusion that because of the timing and direct relationship between the criminal proceedings and this ICSID arbitration the rights invoked by the Claimant merit protection in the specific circumstances of the case.\n\n***The direct relationship between the arbitration and the intended criminal case aggravates the dispute in that it threatens the integrity of the arbitral proceeding***\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n37.\n\nIn order for this Tribunal to enjoin a sovereign State from pursuing a criminal case in its own legal order, it must be convinced that there is a strong linkage between the criminal proceedings and the legal dispute arising out of the investment which is before it, and that such a situation threatens the integrity of the arbitral process.\n\n38.\n\nThe allegations the Respondent intends to make the subject of the criminal investigation relate directly to the subject matter of the arbitration. As counsel for the Respondent acknowledged at the hearing of the present Motion, it is \"absolutely correct, that the basis for the illegality defence are the same acts that would be at issue in public law [criminal] proceedings\" (Transcript p. 93,II 6-9).\n\n39.\n\nAs to criminal investigations, the question is one of timing. In the Tribunal\u2019s view, the integrity of the arbitral process would be compromised by permitting the Respondent to run a criminal investigation concurrently with the arbitration directed to the same people and the same facts at the same time.\n\n40.\n\nFirstly, the criminal investigation contemplated by the Motion as amended would be disruptive. It would inevitably divert at least some of the Claimant\u2019s resources from final preparation of the hearing next month to dealing with issues arising out of police interviews with people now or in the past associated with the Claimant (though not current employees of Sanum Investments of Savan Vegas, who are excluded from the scope of the Motion as amended) as well as potential seizure of documents from any location within Laos or elsewhere (except Sanum Investments or Savan Vegas in Laos) and any derivative evidence arising therefrom.\n\n41.\n\nSecondly, the Claimant contends that the \"chilling effect\" of a concurrent criminal investigation will be a powerful deterrent to Laotian witnesses to give evidence contrary to the Respondent\u2019s position. According to the Claimant, \"the very nature of these criminal proceedings is bound to reduce their [potential witnesses\u2019] willingness to cooperate in the ICSID proceeding\", citing *Quiborax,* at paras. 143-144 and 147:\n\nThe Tribunal considers that the criminal proceedings may indeed be impairing Claimants\u2019 right to present their case, in particular with respect to their access to documentary evidence and witnesses....\n\nThe Tribunal is also troubled by the effect that the criminal proceedings may have on potential witnesses....\n\nEven if no undue pressure is exercised on potential witnesses, the very nature of these criminal proceedings is bound to reduce their willingness to cooperate in the ICSID proceeding. In the words of the *Plama* tribunal, the Tribunal finds that, under the particular circumstances of this case, the rights invoked by Claimants and analyzed in this Section relate to Claimants\" \"ability to have [their] claims and requests for relief in the arbitration fairly considered and decided by the arbitral tribunal\".\n\n42.\n\nAllowing to-day, the Respondent to start the intended criminal investigation would raise exactly the same concerns. Such authorization should not be granted by the Tribunal, as it would aggravate the dispute, by endangering the procedural integrity of the arbitral proceeding.\n\n***There is no change of circumstances sufficient to authorize Laos to start criminal proceeding on the eve of the arbitration hearing***\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n43.\n\nThe Respondent acknowledged in its present motion that it must establish a \"change in circumstances\" that would \"warrant modification of the provisional measure,\" citing *Ireland v. United Kingdom (*\"*The MOX Plant Case\"),* ITLOS Case No. 10, Order of June 24, 2003, see also *Costa Rica* v. *Nicaragua* (ICJ) at para. 31 [CLA-149]\n\n44.\n\nHowever the allegations of criminality are not new. It is clear from the record that the Respondent and the Claimant were already trading accusations in respect of the Claimant\u2019s alleged criminal conduct *prior* to the making of the PMO on 17 September 2013. In an email of 28 August 2013 counsel for the Respondent stated:\n\nThe Government has many issues confronting it from Claimant's lawless behavior, including Claimant's admitted massive scheme of money laundering on an unprecedented scale. First, Claimant expelled Ernst & Young, the Government's appointed auditor, from the casino in July 2012, after only 5 days on site. Claimant has thus thwarted Respondent's ability to audit the casino's books. E&Y was unable to complete the audit and no audit has been possible since then. Second, Mr. Crawford's affidavit submitted to the Tribunal before the 8 May hearing trumpets that Claimant does not use the Laos banking system and instead is transferring all its revenues out of Laos without regard to Laos law on transfers of currency... the Savan Vegas Casino reported revenues of over $75 million USD in 2011--there has been no reporting since, but if revenues for 2012/2013 are of that magnitude, Claimant is carting $75 million across the Thai border in suitcases this past year. That is criminal conduct. (Emphasis added)\n\n45.\n\nThe Claimant replied by email of the same date:\n\nWe will not reply here to Mr. Branson\u2019s unsupported and outrageous accusations of money laundering, evicting E&Y and other issues. The evidence in the record, continued in the affidavits submitted by Claimant\u2019s witnesses and exhibits, shows exactly the opposite.\n\n46.\n\nSince the making of the PMO, the Respondent has, as its counsel put it, \"unearthed\" what it says is \"substantial evidence of violations of criminal law\", but for the most part such evidence does not disclose \"changed circumstances\" so much as it provides some additional evidence by which the Respondent will seek to prove the allegations of \"unlawful conduct\" of which it was already fully aware prior to original PMO hearing, but which admittedly have been amplified by other allegations detailed in the present motion to amend.\n\n47.\n\nHowever, as stated by the Claimant, no reference is made to Lao criminal or evidentiary law to demonstrate that while the Government earlier lacked the power or authority to launch a criminal investigation on the basis of mere \"suspicions or allegations,\" but that as a result of the new evidence of Ms. Sengkeo\u2019s bank records \"its powers to investigate Claimant\u2019s representatives have been triggered.\"12 Indeed, it is quite evident that criminal investigations are launched precisely because there exist reasonable suspicions and not only when there is hard evidence of criminality. The record before the Tribunal indicates that the Respondent was quite well aware of alleged unlawful activity by or on behalf of the Claimant prior to the hearing on Claimant\u2019s request for provisional measures, or at least could have discovered them by employing a basic level of due diligence.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Rejoinder on Respondent\u2019s Motion to Amend the Tribunal\u2019s Decision on Provisional Measures dated 17 September 2013, para. 41.\n\n***The policy of the Respondent prior to the making of the PMO was to stay its \"investigation into money laundering... to allow the arbitration process to proceed in an environment conducive to timely action by the Tribunal\"***\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n48.\n\nIt is true that the Respondent\u2019s allegations of criminality are now more specific and extensive than at the time the PMO was made, but the Respondent\u2019s e-mail of 28 August 2013, based on what it then knew, was unequivocal in its choice of a \"conciliatory\" policy of non-aggravation conducive to the \"timely\" work of the arbitral tribunal:\n\nLao Court proceedings to hold Claimant to account for $20 million in back taxes and the investigation into money laundering have been stayed due to this arbitration, because the Government has made conciliatory efforts to allow the arbitration process to proceed in an environment conducive to timely action by the Tribunal. (E-mail dated 28 August 2013).\n\n49.\n\nWhat seems to have happened is not so much a \"change of circumstances\" as a change of tactics as the arbitration hearing date approached.\n\n***The Tribunal is not persuaded that a criminal investigation, which the Respondent was content in September 2013 to defer until after the arbitration award, has now become a matter of urgency and necessity.***\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n50.\n\nProof of urgency and necessity are key elements in seeking a modification of the PMO. The principle was clearly set out by the International Court of Justice in *Certain Activities Carried out by Nicaragua in the Border Area (Costa Rica* v. *Nicaragua)* Order at paras 30-36, 16 July 2013 (CLA-149) where it was found that while Costa Rica had demonstrated a change of circumstances, it was not entitled to modification of the provisional measures granted because it had failed to demonstrate either urgency or necessity. See also *City Oriente Ltd. v. The Republic of Ecuador,* Case No. ARB/06/21, Decision on Revocation of Provisional Measures and Other Procedural Matters at para 72 (ICSID 13 May 2008) [CLA 133].\n\n51.\n\nThe Tribunal readily acknowledges that the allegations against the Claimant and some of its employees raise issues of serious illegality. All reasonable steps should be taken to ensure the relevant evidence is produced in Singapore. Counsel for the parties are agreed on the need for a robust hearing. Counsel for the Respondent stated:\n\n... Any person who has knowledge relevant to these serious accusations should come to the Tribunal. I have said several times in my letters to the Tribunal about Ms Sengkeo: please bring her. Let\u2019s find out what she has to say. Nobody wants to have false evidence. We want to know the truth.\n\nIf they will bring Ms Sengkeo, they obviously control her. They\u2019ve just told you that [the Claimant\u2019s principal Mr Baldwin is prepared to guarantee a loan to Mme Sengkeo on commercial terms] of $575,000.\n\nNow, in my experience, when a corporation has a consultant who they are [willing to guarantee a loan for] $575,000, that consultant will come and testify if you ask them to. So please ask them to bring Ms Sengkeo.\n\nIf Mr Burton will come and testify, I would be delighted to have him come and testify. Anyone should come and testify.\n\nNow, Mr Kochel, Mr Douglas, they are not employees, they can\u2019t make them come testify, that\u2019s why we may have to do depositions if they are in the United States, or interview them if they are in Cambodia.\n\n\u2026\n\nMR BRANSON: If I can get Ms Manivone to come to Singapore, she will be there. I couldn\u2019t get her to sign a witness statement in October, but if the Government will help me - now, she is a retired person, she doesn\u2019t work for the Government anymore, but if the Government can give her sufficient as I said before, one person told me: well, they are going to die in Laos, they should help their country. If she will come to Singapore, she will be there. I say that about any witness. They should come to this Tribunal. [12 May 2014 Transcript, pp 82-83]\n\n52.\n\nThe Claimant is on notice that the evidence of Mr. Baldwin and Mr. Scott and other senior employees will be of great interest to the Tribunal and both parties are on notice that the same holds true for all the persons accused in the pleadings of illegal conduct, or complicity in illegal conduct.\n\n53.\n\nThe Respondent\u2019s argument turns largely on the impact of some inferences it seeks to draw from Mme. Sengkeo\u2019s bank records which the Respondent obtained, through banking channels in Laos, in January 2014.\n\n54.\n\nMme. Sengkeo\u2019s local representation of the Claimant has been well known to the Respondent since October 2009. Her Laotian bank records are safely in the possession of the Laotian authorities. The Tribunal is advised that at this point Mme. Sengkeo, though offered immunity from prosecution by the Respondent, has refused to talk either to the Respondent or to the Claimant.\n\n55.\n\nA further wrinkle to the Mme Sengkeo situation was added at the 12 May 2014 hearing. Counsel for the Claimant disclosed his client\u2019s willingness to guarantee a $575,000 loan said to be required by Mme Sengkeo to repay a loan to ST, the Claimant\u2019s disenchanted Laotian partner.\n\nWhat we would like to do is be able to introduce [Mme Sengkeo] to an investment fund that does work in Asia called Leopard Capital, and because she is a Lao citizen and because it would take a long time to arrange that, Mr Baldwin [of the Claimant] would like to be able to guarantee the loan to her so that it could be arranged quickly and she could be provided with the funds that she needs in order to repay the loan to ST, which hopefully would, at least, eliminate one of the areas in which she feels she is being intimidated. [12 May 2014 transcript pp 56]\n\n56.\n\nSuch a proposed guarantee, of course, fuels the suspicion of the Respondent.\n\n57.\n\nThe Claimant and the Respondent have had a long running dispute about what lies behind the premature end of the E&Y audit or Savan Vegas. Both parties claim to be distressed by the termination. The Respondent seeks to tie the termination of the E&Y audit to the Claimant thorough entries in Mme. Sengkeo\u2019s bank records which it regards as suspiciously timed.\n\n58.\n\nE&Y issued its interim report on 20 July 2012 clearly stating that its audit had been prematurely terminated by the government itself. On receipt of the interim report in July 2012, the Respondent, if it had any doubt about which of its officials spoke to E&Y and why the stop order was given, could have investigated (through the police or otherwise), if indeed senior officials at the Ministry of Finance disagreed with the stop order. The Respondent apparently saw no urgency or necessity in 2012 to look into the stop order issue even though the dispute with the Claimant was a live issue in the Ministry at the time.\n\n59.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, the obtaining of Mme. Sengkeo's bank records does not warrant an urgent criminal investigation now as opposed to one deferred until the award is made in these proceedings.\n\n60.\n\nThe Respondent\u2019s major argument relates to the notation in Mme. Sengkeo\u2019s bank records of a deposit of $300,000 in July 2012. This corresponds to the time a premature end was ordered to the audit by E&Y of the Claimant's Savan Vegas casino. Money was withdrawn from the account in various amounts over succeeding days. The Sengkeo bank records do not identify the purpose for which the funds were used. However, in light of the timing, the Respondent says \"it is reasonable to infer\" this money was used to bribe government officials to put the premature end to the audit. The Claimant admits the deposit but says the money was a loan to Mme. Sengkeo to assist in the construction of her million dollar hotel. A photograph of the hotel is in evidence. Laos, the Claimant says, is a cash economy. Trades at work on the hotel were paid in cash in the ordinary Laotian way.\n\n61.\n\nThe Claimant insists that charges of corruption must be established not just on a balance of probabilities but by \"clear and compelling evidence\" (12 May 2014 transcript p. 106, 1. 8). However, what the Respondent seeks now is simply the ability to go after the evidence. The Respondent does not purport to have proof of corruption. Otherwise the investigation would be redundant. The only issue at this stage is whether it is appropriate for the Respondent to use the machinery of the criminal law in the hopes of finding useful evidence for the defence of its arbitration case.\n\n62.\n\nAnother unexplained deposit in Mme. Sengkeo's bank account and subsequent withdrawals) leads the Respondent to suspect that one of the Ministry of Finance officials, Ms. Manivone, was bribed in 2011 to advocate within the government the extension of the Claimant\u2019s Flat Tax Agreement (\"FTA\") scheduled to expire December 31, 2013. Ms. Manivone offered advice to the Minister of Finance supporting the extension of the FTA and her advice was rejected. If the Ministry doubted the good faith of her advocacy it could have investigated at that time. An unexplained entry in Mme. Sengkeo's bank account which is not linked to Ms. Manivone but only to the timing of the FTA negotiations is a tenuous basis on which to allege bribery, but in any event such speculation does not create a situation of urgency or necessity justifying a modification of the PMO on the eve of the merits hearing.\n\n63.\n\nIf called as a witness at the hearing Ms. Manivone, now retired, will be examined by both parties and her credibility will be tested and assessed in the usual way, without the overhang of a concurrent criminal investigation. There is no evidence that an investigation of Ms. Manivone would be prejudiced by deferral for a few months.\n\n64.\n\nThe Respondent says that a responsible authority in Paksan may have been bribed to allow one of the Claimant's facilities to continue operating even after the Prime Minister ordered it closed. Once again what the Respondent regards as \"suspiciously timed\" transactions recorded in Mme. Sengkeo's bank records are relied upon, but quite apart from the speculative nature of these inferences, the Respondent was aware in March 2011 that the Claimant's facility in Paksan continued to operate openly despite the Prime Minister's order. Any inquiry thought appropriate could have been initiated at that time, which predated the PMO by about 18 months.\n\n65.\n\nEqually there is no evidence of necessity for urgent action in relation to the participants in the alleged attempt by the Claimant to bribe the Prime Minister to approve a casino in Vientiane. The relevant employees of the Claimant are identified in the *Respondent's Motion to Amend* dated 20 February 2014 at para. 54. The Claimant says the letter was properly sent with its submission to project approval as proof of financial viability. Its witnesses will be available for cross-examination at the hearing.\n\n66.\n\nThe Respondent alleges a bribe of $25,000 was paid to an unknown person to obtain a slot licence for Thakhet. The allegation is said to be supported by an entry in the general ledger of the casino and disclosed in the E&Y Interim Report in 2011. Apparently no investigation was made at that time the Respondent received the E&Y report and no reason is provided for the delay.\n\n67.\n\nThe evidence is also equivocal in relation to a number of instances where the Respondent identifies employees of Savan Vegas it says were involved in corruption including:\n\ni. money paid to government employees the Respondent says, to turn a blind eye to prohibited gambling by Laotian citizens. The Claimant says there were many activities at the casino complex in which Laotian citizens were free to participate in. Other activities were prohibited. The government employees were paid openly and properly for their services to a private employer, Savan Vegas, to supervise these activities.\n\nii. the Respondent alleges \"bribes\" were paid to Thai border guards to ease the passage of Thai gamblers. The Claimant says the payments were lawful and proper charges. They were recorded in the Savan Vegas general ledger and disclosed in the E&Y interim report in July 2012. No investigation was thought to be necessary by the Respondent\u2019s officials at that time.\n\niii. the Respondent has identified a former employee of the Claimant, Mr Yingling, who says he was ordered to offer a government official either $6000 or $600 \"spending money\" but declined to do so. Mr Yingling is apparently cooperating with the Respondent. There is no urgency shown to investigate the truth of his allegations of an unlawful order he says he refused to follow.\n\n68.\n\nThe Respondent claims the Claimant engaged in money laundering by carrying suitcases of cash across the border for deposit in Thai bank accounts. The Claimant says this was lawful and proper. More importantly, the Respondent voluntarily agreed to stay its \"money laundering\" investigation prior to the September PMO hearing to facilitate an environment conducive to an effective arbitration. There are no circumstances suggesting any fresh necessity or urgency to proceed at this time.\n\n69.\n\nThe Respondent accuses the Claimant of embezzlement based largely on accounting records of the Claimant's auditors, Grant Thornton between 2009 and 2011. The Respondent has had the Grant Thornton records for some years. There is no evidence of fresh necessity or urgency to initiate a criminal investigation at this time.\n\n70.\n\nThe Respondent does express concern about possible \"spoliation\" of evidence by potential targets of a criminal investigation. However, much of the relevant financial documentation is held by banks and audit firms. Other evidence may be in danger of destruction but it is rather speculative to contend that while it has survived until now it will likely be destroyed between now and when an award is made by the Tribunal unless a criminal investigation intervenes.\n\n71.\n\nIn summary, there is no sufficient evidence of urgency to establish that a deferral of the police investigation for another few months will seriously prejudice the Respondent. The basis of the Respondent's concerns are largely found in financial records disclosed in the Ernst & Young Report of July 20, 2012, to which the Respondent has had the possibility of access since long before the PMO was made, or bank records of private Laotian citizens, to which the Respondent apparently has access through normal banking channels.\n\n***The proposed modification of the PMO would disproportionately prejudice the Claimant in preparing and presenting its case to the Tribunal***\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n72.\n\nWhile the modified order now sought by the Respondent does build in certain protections for the Claimant, and is to be welcomed on that account, its effect would still be highly disruptive of the Claimant's ability to prepare and present its case. Although presented broadly as a part of the fight against corruption, the Respondent\u2019s proposed criminal investigation strikes directly at the people and issues involved in the arbitration.\n\n73.\n\nThere is no sufficient evidence of necessity or urgency to establish that a deferral of the criminal investigation for another few months until the witnesses are heard at the arbitration and an award is made, will prejudice the Respondent in any way proportionate to the potential prejudice to the Claimant of the diversion and distraction of a full-scale criminal investigation landing on top of the ICSID arbitration.\n\n74.\n\nLooking at the protection of the sovereign rights of the Respondent, it is the Tribunal\u2019s view that such a deferral does not infringe in a serious manner the Lao sovereignty. The Tribunal considers that in respecting the present Decision, the Respondent need only await the decision on the merits, when the Provisional Measures Order will cease to have effect, to commence these investigations which it could have initiated in 2012.\n\n75.\n\nIn sum, the Tribunal is not persuaded that the relevant circumstances have changed sufficiently to warrant the modification of the PMO, or that the criminal investigation (having been put on hold voluntarily by the Respondent prior to the PMO) has become a matter of urgency and necessity, or that the potential harm to the public interest of Laos created by a delay in the investigation until the making of an award herein would outweigh the disruption and distraction to the Claimant and its employees of dealing with a criminal investigation in the midst of final preparation of their case for the arbitration next month.\n\n**CONCLUSION**\n--------------\n\n76.\n\nIn the view of the Tribunal, the Respondent has not satisfied the conditions precedent to justify a modification of the non-aggravation clause to which the Respondent consented at the hearing of 2 September 2013."}, {"Title": "Interim Ruling on Issues Arising Under the Deed of Settlement", "Type": "Preliminary Issues", "Date": "2014-12-19T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Interim Ruling on Issues Arising Under the Deed of Settlement\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| Frequently Used Abbreviations and Acronyms |\n| BIT or Treaty | *Agreement on Encouragement and Reciprocal Protection of Investments* between the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (PDR) and the Kingdom of the Netherlands |\n| Gaming Assets | Savan Vegas Casino, Lao Bao Slot Club and Savannakhet Ferry Terminal Slot Club |\n| Government | Respondent Government of The Lao People's Democratic Republic |\n| ICSID or the Centre | International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes |\n| ICSID-AF Rules | Arbitration Rules (Additional Facility) of the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes |\n| ICSID Convention | Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes Between States and Nationals of Other States dated March 18, 1965 |\n| Paksong Vegas | Paksong Vegas Hotel and Casino |\n| PDA | Savan Vegas Project Development Agreement |\n| RMC | RMC Gaming Management LLC |\n| Savan Vegas | Savan Vegas Hotel and Casino |\n| SIAC | Singapore International Arbitration Centre |\n\n**I. OVERVIEW**\n---------------\n\n1.\n\nThe issue on this Application is whether an **alleged** violation of the terms of a settlement between the parties reached in Singapore on 15 June 2014 now permits the Claimant to pursue its *pre* -settlement claims against the Respondent Government of The Lao People's Democratic Republic (the \"Government\"). The allegations **which have yet to be investigated at any evidentiary hearing,** are that the Government has infringed the Claimant\u2019s gambling monopoly rights in Savannakhet Province, Laos, contrary to the terms of the Settlement, by licencing a rival casino or casinos. The Settlement was based, the Claimant says, on the Government\u2019s undertaking to assist in maximizing the sale price of the Claimant\u2019s gambling assets in Laos and that such licencing of rival(s) strikes at the foundation of the Settlement bargain. Under the circumstances, according to the Claimant, it is entitled to a revival of the arbitration under the Additional Facility Rules of the *International Centre far Settlement of Investor Disputes* (\"ICSID\").\n\n**II. SUMMARY OF DISPOSITION**\n------------------------------\n\n2.\n\nThe Tribunal, having convened a hearing in Washington, DC on 14 October 2014 to hear submissions on the legal objections to its jurisdiction raised by the Government, and having considered the oral and written material submitted, rejects the Government\u2019s objection to its jurisdiction to entertain the Claimant\u2019s allegation of breach of the terms of settlement. However, the Tribunal has also concluded, for the reasons set out below, that given the ambiguous wording of Article 6 of the *Deed of Settlement* on which the Claimant relies, and the difficulty of making any final disposition of the remaining legal arguments in the absence of any factual evidence to provide context to the dispute, that:\n\ni. a further hearing is to be held as soon as may be practible to hear and consider the factual evidence concerning the alleged breach of the *Deed of Settlement,*\n\nii. at which time the Tribunal wishes to hear further argument from counsel on the legal issues hereinafter set forth.\n\n**III. HISTORY OF THE DISPUTE**\n-------------------------------\n\n3.\n\nThe Claimant, incorporated under the laws of Aruba in the Netherlands Antilles, originally submitted its dispute with Laos to ICSID under the *Agreement on Encouragement and Reciprocal Protection of Investments* between Laos and the Kingdom of the Netherlands which entered into force on 1 May 2005, and the *Arbitration Rules (Additional Facility)* of ICSID which entered into force on 10 April 2006.\n\n4.\n\nThe initial dispute related to alleged Government fiscal, regulatory and administrative measures beginning in 2011 against the Claimant\u2019s investment in gambling facilities in Laos, allegedly at the instigation of the Claimant\u2019s erstwhile but now estranged Laotian partners. These measures, according to the Claimant deprived it of part or all of the value of its investment in the gaming and tourism industry. The Claimant values its pre-Settlement losses at between $690 million and $1 billion.\n\n5.\n\nThe Government denies any violations of the Claimant\u2019s gambling monopoly rights and says that even if there was (or continues to be) such a violation of the monopoly it would not entitle this Tribunal to restore the *status quo ante* and revive the pre-settlement ICSID claims. The Claimant\u2019s entitlement to relief, if any, lies with arbitral proceedings before the Singapore International Arbitration Centre (\"SIAC\").\n\n**IV. THE** ***DEED OF SETTLEMENT*** **DATED 15 JUNE 2014 AND THE SIDE LETTER**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n6.\n\nBy *Deed of Settlement* dated 15 June 2014 to be read together with a Side Letter dated 18 June 2014, the Claimant agreed with the Government to \"suspend\" the hearing of the ICSID arbitration and the parallel UNCITRAL arbitration pending before the Permanent Court of Arbitration on their merits to permit implementation of the terms of a Settlement.\n\n**(i) Factual Background**\n--------------------------\n\n7.\n\nThe Claimant has invested substantial monies since 2007 in three major projects in Laos, the Savan Vegas Hotel and Casino (\"Savan Vegas\"), the Paksong Vegas Hotel and Casino (\"Paksong Vegas\") and other enterprises (with local partners) that operated slot machine clubs. Under the terms of the investment, the Government had agreed in 2007 to grant the casinos a licensed monopoly on gambling rights and a \"Flat Tax\" arrangement to remain in effect, at least initially, for a period of five years.\n\n8.\n\nOn 20 December 2011, the Laotian legislature enacted a casino tax of 80% of casino *revenues* (not profits). The Flat Tax Agreement expired 31 December 2013. In the ordinary course, the new tax law would apply to Savan Vegas commencing 1 January 2014. The Claimant says the casino could not survive the impact of an 80% tax on revenue. Hence it sought and was granted by the ICSID Tribunal a Provisional Measures Order staying (on agreed terms) the application of the 80% tax pending the outcome of the ICSID arbitration.\n\n9.\n\nIn addition, the Claimant grounded its claims on an array of measures allegedly initiated by the Government beginning in April 2012. These included what the Claimant regards as unfair and oppressive audits of its Savan Vegas Hotel and Casino. This \"harassment\", the Claimant says, was instigated by and for the benefit of its estranged Laotian business partners, a Laotian company called ST and its principals who are Laotian nationals. In the end, the Government issued fresh tax claims against Savan Vegas which the Claimant says are invalid but, being unpaid, led to the freezing of the Savan Vegas bank accounts in Laos. The series of Government measures taken together, the Claimant says, amounts to *de facto* expropriation.\n\n10.\n\nThe Government, for its part, says that the Claimant and its related companies had for years been operating its gambling operations using impenetrable accounting procedures, and in some respects acting illegally, including through the corruption of Laotian Government officials. In 2013, the Government declared its intention to initiate criminal investigations of the Claimant and its principals who are U.S. citizens. Counsel for the Government made the submission at the 6 January 2014 hearing that:\n\n[The Claimants] decided, for their own reasons, that they would put all their money into Thailand; well, they had been putting their money in Thailand for the last five years. And it is illegal, it is against the law in Laos for any Lao corporation to have a bank account outside the country, and they had seven bank accounts outside the country for the last five years. We can tell from some of the documents we received from Ernst & Young that in one of those bank accounts in 2011, a year before the \"freezing order\", they put $11 million into a Thai bank account. That\u2019s against the law. (Transcript, pages 19-20).\n\n11.\n\nThese extracts provide the flavour of the underlying ICSID dispute. In the result, the Claimant and its U.S. principals wanted to rid themselves of threatened criminal investigations and to withdraw entirely from Laos and the Government wanted to see them gone. Under the concept of the Settlement, the money necessary to achieve this mutually desired objective would come from a third party purchaser of the Claimant\u2019s assets in Laos. The Government itself did not agree to pay any compensation.\n\n**(ii) The Settlement**\n-----------------------\n\n12.\n\nThe settlement process was described in general terms on 17 June 2014 by counsel for the Government as follows:\n\nWe started negotiating on Thursday. We negotiated all day Friday. I imposed the terms, here are the terms: \"We pay them nothing; they dismiss their claims, they sell their casino for what they can get, and they leave Lao. Those are the terms.\" (Transcript, 17 June 2014, p. 25)\n\nI told you, I imposed the terms. I\u2019ve been trying my best to make it possible for them to work the deal. So. any time they asked me for anything that would make it easier for them to sell, make it easier for them to do this or that, I would put it in the Agreement. I bent over backwards. (Transcript, 17 June 2014, p. 33) (emphasis added)\n\nThere is an additional and important qualification to this summary. The Claimant\u2019s financial claims against the Government for conduct pre-dating the settlement were subject to revival in the event of a post-settlement material breach of certain of the terms identified in Article 32 of the *Deed of Settlement* itself, which provides as follows:\n\n**Article 32**\n\nThe Claimants shall only be permitted to revive the arbitration in the event that Laos is in material breach of Sections 5 \u2014 8, 15, 21 \u2014 23, 25, 27 or 28 above and only after reasonable written notice is given to Laos by the Claimants of such breach and such breach is not remedied within 45 days after receipt of notice of such breach. The Sale Deadline and any other relevant time periods herein shall be extended by the length of time required to cure such breach. In the event that there is a dispute as to whether or not Laos is in material breach of Sections 5 \u2014 8, 15, 21 \u2014 23, 25, 27 or 28 above, the Tribunals shall determine whether or not there has been such a material breach and shall only revive the arbitration if they conclude that there has been such a material breach.\n\n13.\n\nThe ink was barely dry on the *Deed of Settlement* and Side Letter when on 4 July 2014, the Claimant filed an *\"Application for Finding of Material Breach of Deed of Settlement and for Reinstatement of Arbitration\".* The ground for relief was an allegation that the Respondent Government had granted gambling concession(s) to third parties in breach of the Savan Vegas casino monopoly rights, thereby ending (the Claimant said) any possibility of an advantageous sale.\n\n14.\n\nThe Claimant places particular reliance in Article 6 (as clarified by the Side Letter):\n\n**Article 6**\n\nLaos shall treat the Project Development Agreement (\"PDA\") dated 10 August 2007 in respect of the Savan Vegas Casino and each of the licenses and land concessions issued in respect of the Savan Vegas Casino, the Lao Bao Slot Club and the Savannakhet Ferry Terminal Slot Club (collectively the \"Gaming Assets\"), as being restated as of the Effective Date, with a term in each of fifty (50) years as from the Effective Date. ST owns 40% of the Lao Bao and Ferry Terminal Slot Clubs, (emphasis added)\n\nMuch of the present dispute revolves around the disagreement of the parties about the meaning and effect of the concluding (underlined) words of Article 6.\n\n**(iii) The Prospective Purchaser**\n-----------------------------------\n\n15.\n\nCounsel for the Claimant explained the origins of the settlement:\n\nThe settlements arose-the possibility of the Settlement arose a couple of weeks ago when Claimants received an offer to purchase their\u2014the Savan Vegas properties, and it became clear that that might be a means to resolve the disputes. But, of course, Claimants can only sell the Savan Vegas and the other properties they own with the cooperation of the Laos Government and with certain steps taken by the Laos Government that make the properties salable. (Transcript 19 June 2014, pp. 49-50) (emphasis added)\n\nThe Government surmises that this expected offer did not materialize, and the Claimant is using the present Application to seek delay and play for time in the hopes that other prospective purchasers emerge.\n\n**(iv) The Sale Process**\n-------------------------\n\n16.\n\nThe *Deed of Settlement* contemplated a resolution of the Flat Tax issue within 45 days of 15 June 2014. The Claimant would then have ten months to complete a sale, with an extension of time if necessary to accommodate a closing date. During that time, the Claimant and its affiliates would continue to run the businesses subject to the \"monitoring and oversight\" of the Government\u2019s agent, RMC Gaming Management LLC (\"RMC\"). At the end of 10 months, if no sale has materialized, \"the Claimants and Laos shall have the right to appoint RMC or any other qualified operator\" to step in and manage the gambling assets \"in place of the Claimants until the sale is complete\" (Article 12 of the *Deed of Settlement).*\n\n17.\n\nThe Claimant, having filed the present Application on 4 July 2014, declined to join in the agreed process to arrive at a new Flat Tax Agreement.\n\n18.\n\nThe Government\u2019s position is that the Claimant\u2019s strategy at this point is to maintain its control over the operations of its business investments for so long as it can.\n\n**V. THE GOVERNMENT\u2019S OBJECTION TO THE TRIBUNAL**\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n19.\n\nThe Government objects to the jurisdiction of the Tribunal to decide if there has been a material breach of the *Deed of Settlement.* The Government submits that this mandate has been confided by the parties to the *exclusive* jurisdiction of SIAC.\n\n20.\n\nIn order to decide whether or not the Tribunal has jurisdiction, several questions must be answered.\n\n21.\n\n**The first question** is whether this Tribunal has jurisdiction to decide its own jurisdiction under the *Deed of Settlement* and the BIT or whether, in this respect, it must defer to SIAC.\n\n22.\n\n**The second question** is linked with the timing of the different procedural acts. One question is whether the fact that the Claimant did not respect the 45 day notice period provided for in Section 32 is a bar to the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction. The other question is whether the jurisdictional objection of the Government was filed too late and out of time.\n\n23.\n\n**The third question** arises only if the Tribunal considers that it has jurisdiction to decide on its own jurisdiction. The question then becomes the *scope* of its jurisdiction. The question is two-fold. It is firstly, whether under Section 32 it has jurisdiction to determine the existence of a material breach under Article 6. It is secondly, whether this jurisdiction encompasses the interpretation of Article 6. Considering that the *Deed of Settlement* gives jurisdiction to SIAC on all disputes relating to the Deed, the parties disagree about what happens when an issue of interpretation is raised (as here) during the process of determination of the existence of a material breach of the *Deed of Settlement.* In such a case does the task of interpretation fall on the Tribunal or on SIAC? Alternatively, is there concurrent jurisdiction?\n\n24.\n\n**The fourth question** arises only if the Tribunal considers that it has the power to interpret the sections of the *Deed of Settlement* relevant to a determination of a material breach, which is mainly in this case Article 6: the specific question here, as presented by the parties, is the *interpretation of Section* *6,* i.e. whether a material breach of Article 6 encompasses a material breach of the Savan Vegas Project Development Agreement (\"PDA\"). The Claimant submits that such a material breach if established on the facts would trigger reinstatement of the ICSID arbitration. The Government argues that the effect of Article 6 is merely to extend the PDA for a further 7 years, namely to 15 June 2064. (Fifty years from the Effective Date of the *Deed of Settlement.)*\n\n25.\n\nThe Tribunal will proceed to examine these questions in the order thus presented.\n\n**A. Does the Tribunal have jurisdiction to decide on its own jurisdiction?**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n26.\n\nThe principle of *comp\u00e9tence-comp\u00e9tence -* described by the Claimant during the hearing as \"the fundamental concept of kompetenz-kompetenz\"1 - is one of the most widely accepted general principle in international arbitration. As aptly summarized by an author2:\n\nThe competence-competence doctrine is almost **universally accepted** in international arbitration conventions, national legislation, judicial decisions, institutional rules and international arbitral awards. Authority in each of these sources recognizes with relative unanimity some version of a competence-competence doctrine. As a consequence, the basic proposition that an international arbitral tribunal presumptively possesses jurisdiction to consider and decide on its own jurisdiction must be considered a **universally recognized principle of international arbitration law.** That is confirmed by the almost complete absence of any authority denying the power of arbitral tribunals to consider and decide jurisdictional challenges, subject to subsequent judicial review. It is also confirmed by long-standing recognition of the competence-competence doctrine in the related fields of state-to-state and investment arbitration, (emphasis added)\n\nTranscript, pp. 51-52, line 22 and line 1.\n\nBom, Gary, International Commercial Arbitration (Kluwer Law International, 2014), at 1050-51, CLA-216.\n\n27.\n\nThis general principle has been embodied in the ICSID (AF) Rules.\n\n28.\n\nICSID (AF) Rules, Article 45(1):\n\nThe Tribunal shall have **the power to rule on its competence.** For the purposes of this Article, an agreement providing for arbitration under the Additional Facility shall be separable from the other terms of the contract in which it may have been included, (emphasis added)\n\n29.\n\nThe Tribunal does not see on what basis it could be deprived of the competence to decide its own competence, which belongs to each and every international tribunal, and considers therefore that it does have jurisdiction to decide on the existence and scope of its own jurisdiction. It here agrees with the following statement by counsel for the Claimant at the 14 October 2014 hearing:\n\nIt's clear that these Tribunals do possess the power. Again, both the ICSID and the UNCITRAL Rules say that the Tribunal shall have the power to rule on its own jurisdiction or its own competence.3\n\nTranscript, pp. 65-66, line 22 and lines 1-3\n\n30.\n\nOne of the arguments of the Government is that these Tribunals lack competence because they \"derive their jurisdiction from two Treaties that do not contain a consent to apply New York law.\" The Tribunal cannot accept this submission.\n\n31.\n\nThe present ICSID (AF) arbitral Tribunal has been instituted under the respective Treaties. In an ICSID Additional Facility arbitration, the tribunal has to apply the applicable law as defined in Article 54(1) of the Arbitration (AF) Rules:\n\nThe Tribunal shall apply **the rules of law designated by the parties as applicable to the substance of the dispute.** Failing such designation by the parties, the Tribunal shall apply (a) the law determined by the conflict of laws rules which it considers applicable and (b) such rules of international law as the Tribunal considers applicable, (emphasis added)\n\n32.\n\nIt is common for an international arbitral tribunal to hear contractual disputes - and the *Deed of Settlement* is a contract between the parties - and in doing so, to apply the choice of law referred to in the contract. In this case, the law designated by the parties in Article 42 of the *Deed of Settlement* is the law of New York. Clearly, a tribunal constituted under the ICSID (AF) Rules is not only authorized to apply the law of New York but is required (\"shall\") do so.\n\n33.\n\nIn sum, the Tribunal reiterates that it is evident that it has the power to decide on the existence and scope of its jurisdiction, in line with the general principle of *comp\u00e9tence-comp\u00e9tence.*\n\n**B. Does the Tribunal have jurisdiction** ***\"ratione temporis\"?***\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n34.\n\nUnder this heading, the Tribunal addresses two arguments of the parties dealing with deadlines. According to the Government the Application of the Claimant was too early, and according to the Claimant the Objection to jurisdiction of the Government was too late.\n\n*i. Is the non-respect by the Claimant of the 45 day cure period of Section 32 a bar to the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction?*\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n35.\n\nThe Government argues that the Claimant was not at liberty to fde its Application before 11 August 2014, i.e. 45 days after 27 June 2014, when its Notice was sent to the Government alleging a material breach of the *Deed of Settlement.* Having been filed on July 4, 2014, the Application is *premature* by more than a month. The conditions provided for in Section 32 are conditions pertaining to the consent to arbitration of the parties, and if such conditions are not fulfilled, the consent must be deemed nonexistent. According to the Government, the 45 day cure period is of utmost importance:\n\nCure periods are inserted into contracts to prevent litigation. That's the purpose of a cure period.... if the Contract has a cure period, the breaching Party has an opportunity to cure the breach before there's litigation. That's the purpose of the clause.4\n\nTranscript, p. 114, lines 10-17.\n\n36.\n\nTo this jurisdictional objection, the Claimant presents two lines of defence: the first is that compliance with the 45 day cure period is not a jurisdictional condition, but a question for the merits stage of the arbitration. The second argument is that, even if it were a jurisdictional condition, compliance is futile in this case as the material breach cannot be remedied, and as a consequence, the cure period does not need to be respected.\n\n37.\n\nAs to the first argument the Claimant distinguishes between the time of the *initiation* of the procedure of revival and the time of the *disposition* of the procedure of revival. The Claimant differentiates between a cure period that would bar the Tribunal from reinstating the arbitration before the expiry of 45 days after the Notice of a material breach and, on the other hand, a cure period of 45 days that would bar the Claimant from filing of a request for reinstatement of the arbitration by the Claimant. In support of this submission, it cites several New-York cases that make a distinction between different types of cure periods, a cure period which is a condition precedent to the initiation of a suit or a cure period for other purposes. As argued by the Claimant at the hearing, \"it's the revival of the arbitrations and not the filing of an application that has to be suspended for 45 days.\"5\n\nTranscript, p. 98, lines 1-3.\n\n38.\n\nThe second argument of the Claimant is the argument of futility: here again, it cites New York cases in which courts have decided that if a cure period relates to an application instituted in order to seek a remedy to a breach, such period need not be respected if the breach is incurable. It cites to that effect the case *Sea Tow v. Pontin,* in which the Court asserted that \"the Court finds, as a matter of law, that if a breach was incurable, plaintiff was under no obligation to adhere to the ten-day cure provision.\"6\n\n***Sea Tow Servs. Int\u2019l, Inc. v. Pontin,*** 607 F. Supp. 2d 378, 388 (E.D.N.Y. 2009), CLA-224.\n\n39.\n\nIn order to analyse this issue, it is necessary to quote again the relevant part of Section 32:\n\nThe Claimants shall only be permitted to revive the arbitration in the event that Laos is in material breach... and only after reasonable written notice is given to Laos by the Claimants of such breach and such breach is not remedied within 45 days after receipt of notice of such breach, (emphasis added)\n\n40.\n\nThe Tribunal cannot accept the Claimant\u2019s submission, as developed, for example, during the hearing that the 45 day cure period is not a condition precedent to initiate a suit for revival of the arbitration. Counsel for the Claimant declared that:\n\nThe terms of the Contract, Section 32, does not say\u2014does not say we shall not bring a claim under Section 32 until they've had a 45-day cure period. It says that the arbitration shall not be revived until the end of the 45-day cure period. That is an important difference...7\n\nTranscript, p. 160, lines 10-15.\n\n41.\n\nIf Section 32 really said \"the arbitration shall not be revived until the end of the 45 day cure period\", it would indeed make sense that this would apply to the Tribunal, as argued by the Claimant, as the Tribunal is the only entity capable of reviving the arbitration. However, this is not what Section 32 says. Its wording is the following: \"The Claimants shall only be permitted to revive the arbitration... after reasonable written notice is given to Laos by the Claimants of such breach and such breach is not remedied within 45 days after receipt of notice of such breach.\" This means that two conditions are to be fulfilled before the Claimant can seek revival of the arbitration: the first condition is to give a reasonable notice of the alleged breach to the Respondent Government, the second condition is to wait for 45 days to allow the Government to cure the breach (if there is one) prior to initiating a suit for revival of the arbitration.\n\n42.\n\nSection 32 says \"(t)he Claimants shall only be permitted to revive the arbitration.\"8 The Tribunal does not accept the Claimant\u2019s statement in its Comments of 1 October 2014 that\n\nThe language of Section 32 is clear: either the Claimant can revive the arbitrations or the Tribunals can do so if they resolve in Claimant\u2019s favour a dispute as to whether or not Laos is in material breach of the Settlement.9\n\nThis is one more example of an ambiguous disposition, which needs interpretation. As stated by counsel for Respondent during the hearing: \"it\u2019s the judges\u2019 job to help us clear up the ambiguity by making sense of it.\" Transcript, p. 136, lines 3-4.\n\nComments, para. 4.\n\n43.\n\nIn the Tribunal\u2019s view the Claimant does *not* have a power unilaterally to revive the arbitration. The only way it can seek to have the arbitration revived is by application to the Tribunal under s. 32 of the *Deed of Settlement.*\n\n44.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees therefore with the Government\u2019s submission that the lapse of the 45 day cure period is a jurisdictional condition precedent to initiate suit before this Tribunal in order to obtain a revival of the arbitration.\n\n45.\n\n**It is common ground that this condition precedent has not been respected.** The question which arises is therefore the consequence of this non respect of the cure period on the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction.\n\n46.\n\nThere are conflicting decisions in the case law of arbitral tribunals dealing with conditions precedent to the filing of a claim by an investor against a State, but these mainly concern the condition found in a certain number of BITs, of the exhaustion of local remedies for a certain period of time. Some consider it as mere procedural requirement that can be disregarded without barring the arbitral tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction; others consider it as a jurisdictional condition, whose disregard results in a bar to the arbitral tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction. The Tribunal need not enter into this jurisprudence, as the condition stated by Section 32 is not a condition relating to certain steps that are required but which have not been respected - like presenting the claims to the national courts for 18 months for example - but a condition consisting of the mere passing of time.\n\n47.\n\nIt is common ground that the jurisdiction of a Tribunal or Court must normally be assessed on the date of the filing of the act instituting proceedings. This is also the position of New York law, as has been underscored in a question addressed to counsel for the Claimant by an arbitrator during the hearing:\n\nThe position of New York law, but generally, the rights of the Parties are determined as of the date of the originating document, and the originating document here is the 4th of July, and you ask for a declaration, as of the 4th of July that the Respondent has materially breached Article 6. Does that not create a problem with the 45-days?10\n\nTranscript, p. 106, lines 6-13.\n\n48.\n\nHowever, the Tribunal is also mindful of the fact that if at the time the Tribunal takes its decision 45 days have by then elapsed since the filing of the Application, the Claimant could simply present its claim again and this claim on its own would satisfy the condition precedent to the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction. In this circumstance, it would be counterproductive for the Tribunal to decline jurisdiction because the condition - now fulfilled - had not yet been fulfilled at the time of the filing of the Application. As stated by Claimant\u2019s counsel at the hearing, \"the 45-day cure period has now expired.\"11 This fact is uncontested and it means that at the time of the Tribunal\u2019s decision - now - the jurisdictional condition is fulfilled.\n\nTranscript, p. 99, lines 18-19\n\n49.\n\nThis issue of premature filings of claims has been extensively dealt with by the PCIJ as well as the ICJ, and the Tribunal will take inspiration from their decisions, relying mainly on the Judgment of 11 February 1993 of the ICJ in the case *Application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (Bosnia and Herzegovina v. Serbia and Montenegro), (Yugoslavia v. Bosnia and Herzegovina) Preliminary Objections,* in which all the pertinent citations are quoted.\n\n50.\n\nIn that proceeding, an issue was raised concerning the possibility that Bosnia and Herzegovina had filed its case a few days too early, if the Court adopted a certain analysis of the consequences of the Yugoslavian State succession. The Tribunal thinks it appropriate to quote here extensive extracts of the mentioned judgement, with the references to other cases:\n\nHowever, the Court would recall that, as it noted in its Order of 8 April 1993, even if Bosnia and Herzegovina were to be treated as having acceded to the Genocide Convention, which could mean that the Application could be said to be premature by nine days when filed on 20 March 1993, during the time elapsed since then, **Bosnia and Herzegovina could, on its own initiative, have remedied the procedural defect by filing a new Application.** It therefore matters little that the Application had been filed some days too early. As will be indicated in the following paragraphs, the Court is not bound to attach the same degree of importance to considerations of form as they might possess in domestic law. (para. 24, emphasis added)\n\n**It is the case that the jurisdiction of the Court must normally be assessed on the date of the filing of the act instituting proceedings.** However, the Court, like its predecessor, the Permanent Court of International Justice, has always had recourse to the principle according to which **it should not penalize a defect in a procedural act which the applicant could easily remedy.** Hence, in the case concerning the *Mavrommatis Palestine Concessions,* the Permanent Court said:\n\n\"Even if the grounds on which the institution of proceedings was based were defective for the reason stated, this would not be an adequate reason for the dismissal of the applicant's suit. The Court, whose jurisdiction is international, is not bound to attach to matters of form the same degree of importance which they might possess in municipal law. **Even, therefore, if the application were premature because the Treaty of Lausanne had not yet been ratified, this circumstance would now be covered by the subsequent deposit of the necessary ratifications.\"** *(P.C.I.J., Series A, No. 2,* p. 34.)\n\nThe same principle lies at the root of the following dictum of the Permanent Court of International Justice in the case concerning *Certain German Interests in Polish Upper Silesia'.*\n\n\"Even if, under Article 23, the existence of a definite dispute were necessary, this condition could at any time be fulfilled by means of unilateral action on the part of the applicant Party. And the Court cannot allow itself to be hampered by a mere defect of form, the removal of which depends solely on the Party concerned.\" (P.C.I.J., Series A, No.6, p. 14.)\n\nThe present Court applied this principle in the case concerning the *Northern Cameroons* (I.C.J. Reports 1963, p. 28), as well *as Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua (Nicaragua v.* *United States of America)* when it stated: \"It would make no sense to require Nicaragua now to institute fresh proceedings based on the Treaty, which it would be fully entitled to do.\" (*I.C.J. Reports 1984,* pp. 428-429, para. 83, emphasis added)\n\nIn the present case, even if it were established that the Parties, each of which was bound by the Convention when the Application was filed, had only been bound as between themselves with effect from 14 December 1995, **the Court could not set aside its jurisdiction on this basis, inasmuch as Bosnia and Herzegovina might at any time file a new application, identical to the present one, which would be unassailable in this respect,** (para. 26, emphasis added)\n\n51.\n\nIt is the Tribunal\u2019s view that the exact same reasoning has to be adopted here, as far as the 45 day cure period is concerned. The Tribunal is mindful that it has to apply New-York law to the merits of the case, but as an international arbitral tribunal, created under an international treaty, its procedure follows international law rules, and the example of the way the ICJ deals with the type of issue faced by the Tribunal is apposite. As from 11 August 2014, the Claimant could have fried its Application. It is now December 2014. Between these two dates, to paraphrase the ICJ, \"the Claimant could, on its own initiative, have remedied the procedural defect by filing a new Application.\"\n\n52.\n\nAs a consequence, the Tribunal considers that in the circumstances the non-respect of the 45 day cure period does not bar the jurisdiction of this Tribunal.\n\n53.\n\nThe Claimant\u2019s second response to the jurisdictional issue - the alleged futility of respecting the 45 day cure period - could in any event only be decided at the merits stage, with production of evidence by both parties. As the Tribunal has rejected the Government\u2019s objection on other grounds the \"futility\" issue is moot and does not have to be addressed by the Tribunal.\n\n**C. Is the jurisdictional objection raised by Respondent out of time so as to bar the Tribunal\u2019s competence to deal with it?**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n54.\n\nIn its Reply, the Claimant argued that the jurisdictional objection of the Government should be denied as it was untimely and therefore not properly before the Tribunal. As will be discussed below, the Government declared during the hearing that its Objection is timely because it was made in part to answer the Tribunal\u2019s question addressed to the parties on 21 August 2014 as to the scope of the Tribunal \u2019 s jurisdiction.\n\n55.\n\nThe Tribunal will address this issue in light of the relevant article, which provides as follows: CSID (AF) Rules, Article 45(2):\n\nAny objection that the dispute is not within the competence of the Tribunal shall be fried with the Secretary-General as soon as possible after the constitution of the Tribunal and in any event no later than the expiration of the time limit fixed for the filing of the counter-memorial or, if the objection relates to an ancillary claim, for the filing of the rejoinder\u2014unless the facts on which the objection is based are unknown to the party at that time.\n\n56.\n\nAlthough no *explicit* discretion is given to the Tribunal under the ICSID (AF) Rules, Tribunal is satisfied that under the general authority conferred by the ICSID (AF) Rules it has the flexibility to deal with a late objection to its jurisdiction. In particular Article 33(3) confers a broad discretion to relieve against time limits in \"special circumstances:\n\nAny step taken after expiration of the applicable time limit shall be disregarded unless the Tribunal, in special circumstances and after giving the other party an opportunity of stating its views, decides otherwise.\n\n57.\n\nBoth parties have indeed addressed the question of the time limit to present an objection, and having reviewed the submissions the Tribunal exercises its discretion in the special circumstances of this case to permit it the Government\u2019s objection to proceed.\n\n58.\n\nSpecifically, the Tribunal considers the Government\u2019s delay to be justified under the very specific and unusual circumstances of this case. The *Application for Finding of a Material Breach of Deed of Settlement* was filed on 4 July 2014, a little more than two weeks after the Settlement, and a Response was delivered on behalf of the Government on 11 July 2014, a mere seven days after the Notice of the Application. The Tribunal accepts that the Government needed more time than was available between 4 July and 11 July 2014 to consider, formulate and file its objection to jurisdiction.\n\n59.\n\nThis is especially so in light of the multiplicity and complexity of the post-settlement proceedings. For example the Government alleges that the Claimant violated the *Deed of Settlement* by not paying important sums due to Laos. As a result the Government filed a Notice of arbitration before SIAC on 21 August 2014 under Article 35 of the *Deed of Settlement.* This was elaborated on in the Government\u2019s Response:\n\nOn July 2, 2014 Mr. Rivkin sent a letter stating that Claimants were suspending performance under the Deed of Settlement. Claimants refused to pay RMC on July 1, 2014 pursuant to Annex E of the Deed of Settlement and refused to constitute the third member of the FT committee, making it impossible to establish a flat tax by the agreed date of July 31, 2014 to the detriment of the Government. The Government has the right under the Deed of Settlement to collect the flat tax as from July 1, 2014. That right was a condition for waiving tax for the period of January 1, 2014 through June 30, 2014, a bargain that now has been lost to the Government.12\n\nResponse, p. 2.\n\n60.\n\nAlso, on 21 August 2014, the Tribunal asked the parties in Procedural Order No. 4 to make submissions on the scope of the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction under Section 32. This triggered an argument of the Government at the hearing to the effect that its objection was at least partially in answer to the question of the Tribunal put to the parties.13 The Objection was filed three weeks after PO No. 4 and a little more than two months after the Claimant\u2019s *Application.* In the view of the Tribunal, this is not such a delay that would justify a refusal to hear and determine the Government\u2019s Objection.\n\nSee Transcript, p. 21, lines 14-16.\n\n61.\n\nIn sum, the Tribunal considers that its jurisdiction is neither precluded by a premature filing of the *Application* for finding a material breach by Claimant, nor by the late filing of the Government\u2019s Objection to jurisdiction.\n\n**D. What is the scope of the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction?**\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n62.\n\nThe Claimant submits that the Tribunal (i) has jurisdiction to determine the existence of a material breach of any of the ten sections mentioned in Section 32 and (ii) has in particular jurisdiction to interpret Article 6, one of the sections mentioned in Section 32. The Government contends that this competence falls only to SIAC.\n\n***1. Does the Tribunal have jurisdiction to determine the existence of a material breach under Article 32 of the Deed of Settlement?***\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n63.\n\nThe Government submits that only SIAC is \"competent to determine the scope of Section 42 and define the true construction of Section 32.\"14 Its argument was succinctly stated in its Objection, but included the idea that although in theory it is possible to have two arbitration clauses in an agreement like the *Deed of Settlement,* this is not the case here as \"there is only one clause in the Deed, Section 42, a standard SIAC arbitration clause.\"15 This was reiterated at the hearing, when counsel for the Government declared that \"Section 42 is as broad an arbitration clause as there is in the modem world. It gives SIAC arbitrators the jurisdiction to determine all aspects of the *Deed of Settlement,\"16*\n\nObjection, para. 10.\n\nObjection, para. 7.\n\nTranscript, p. 11, lines 6-9.\n\n64.\n\nCounsel for the Government then developed during the hearing a more complex analysis of how the arbitration clauses in Section 42 and Section 32 can be read together and articulated. The main contention was that the existence of a breach could be either agreed to by the parties without the intervention of the Tribunal, or decided by a SIAC arbitral tribunal. In either event the mandate of *this* Tribunal is restricted to deciding whether the breach thus determined to exist either by the parties or by SIAC is *material.* As stated by counsel for the Government:\n\nSo, we gave these Tribunals in this Deed the limited power to consider whether a breach is sufficiently material that it justifies reviving the arbitration.17\n\nArticle 42 is an all-encompassing SIAC arbitration clause, and Section 32 is a limited brief for these Tribunals to consider a breach after a breach is either agreed or determined.18\n\nTranscript, page 17, lines 5-8.\n\nTranscript, page 27, lines 17-20.\n\n65.\n\nThe Government\u2019s submission rests on a truncated reading of Section 32 which, to repeat for ease of reference, provides that \"(i)n the event that there is a dispute as to whether or not Laos is in material breach... the Tribunals shall determine whether or not there has been such a material breach.\" Article 32 does *not* say: \"(i)n the event that there is a dispute as to whether or not a breach committed by Laos is material... the Tribunals shall determine the issue of materiality.\" It is not correct to isolate the concepts of \"material\" and \"breach\" from each other in order to bifurcate what is in fact a single issue and merely restrict the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction.\n\n66.\n\nThe power to apply a provision in a contract necessarily implies the power to interpret that provision. As stated by counsel for the Claimant at the hearing: \"Clearly, in determining whether or not there has been a material breach in making a conclusion, you have to look at the facts. You have to interpret the Agreement. That's what Tribunals do. You don't have to have more language than that.\"19 And this was reiterated later in the same presentation by Claimant\u2019s counsel:\n\nClearly, the Parties agreed that the Tribunal would have the jurisdiction to decide the issues put to them in Section 32, and it is not necessary in such an arbitration clause to say, \"And the Tribunal shall interpret the provisions of the Deed.\" It is not necessary to say, \"You shall find facts and find the relevant law.\" That's what Tribunals do. That's what Tribunals do all the time, and that doesn't need to be listed in an arbitration clause. Of course, Tribunals have to interpret the Agreement that is to be determined.20\n\nTo say it differently, the power of contractual interpretation is inherent in the power of contractual application.\n\nTranscript, p. 52, lines 14-18.\n\nTranscript, p. 67, lines 8-18.\n\n67.\n\nThe Tribunal wishes also to note that neither Section 42 nor Section 32 refer to a power of interpretation, and there is therefore no textual basis to say that SIAC would have the exclusive power of interpretation of the *Deed of Settlement,* while this Tribunal would be deprived of any power of interpretation under Section 32, despite its mandate is to determine whether or not there exists a material breach of any of the sections therein identified.\n\n68.\n\nIn fact, if when applying a rule, a tribunal had no authority to interpret that rule, it is difficult to see how it could fulfil its mandate. The wording of Section 32 simply does not justify the interpretation that the Tribunal\u2019s role is centred exclusively on *materiality* rather than on the existence of the breach *and* its materiality.\n\n69.\n\nThe Government\u2019s interpretation would lead to an absurd result, as a matter of procedural efficiency: it would indeed mean that in case of an allegation of a material breach, there would be two proceedings, one before SIAC to determine whether a breach has occurred and then one before this Tribunal to decide whether the breach is material. Issues might arise in the subsequent hearing before this Tribunal to necessitate a return trip to SIAC. Bifurcation could become trifurcation and so on.\n\n70.\n\nThe Tribunal concludes that Section 32 gives the consent of the parties to the jurisdiction of the Tribunal to decide whether there has been a breach *and* whether the breach thus established is material, *and* in the event the Tribunal finds such a material breach, to revive the arbitration.\n\n71.\n\nSome subsidiary comments can be added to this conclusion, which reinforce it.\n\n72.\n\nThe Tribunal is aware that there are three arbitration clauses in the *Deed of Settlement,* two of them being possibly concurrent, and two of them being redundant. There is indeed a general arbitration clause in **Section 42 applying to both parties** and referring to \"(a)ny dispute arising out of or in connection with this Deed, including any question regarding its existence, validity or termination, shall be referred to and finally resolved by arbitration in Singapore in accordance with the Arbitration Rules of the Singapore International Arbitration Centre.\" There is also **Section 35 applying to the** **Respondent** only and which covers part of the disputes mentioned in Section 42, as it states that Laos can file a SIAC arbitration if the Claimants violate the *Deed of Settlement',* this indeed is already possible under Section 42, which is why the Tribunal considers these two articles as redundant. And there is also **Section 32 applying to the Claimants only** which can ask this Tribunal to revive the arbitration in case of a material violation not of any section of the *Deed of Settlement,* but of ten (10) specified sections of the Deed. In a certain sense, Section 42 and Section 32, as applied to Claimant, could appear as somewhat contradictory and this contradiction must be resolved.\n\n73.\n\nOne solution to solve the apparent conflict between Section 42 and Section 32 is to accept that it gives a choice to the Claimant to either go to SIAC under Section 42 or to this Tribunal under Section 32. There is nothing that prevents concurrent jurisdiction of more than one tribunal. Counsel for the Government recognized as much, during the hearing. To the question posed by an arbitrator: \"Do you accept as a general proposition that there can be concurrent jurisdiction?\" the answer of counsel was: \"Yes. It happens many times.\"21 And the Claimant agreed, stating: \"... there is no conflict between the two [this tribunal and a SIAC tribunal]... You can have concurrent jurisdiction. You can have different sets of claims brought to them.\"22\n\nTranscript, p. 38, lines 5-7.\n\nTranscript, p. 94, lines 12-14.\n\n74.\n\nMoreover, even if considered to be contradictory and on their face irreconcilable, there is a legal principle in New York law to solve the issue, which is that the specific clause prevails over the more general clause. This was explained by counsel for Claimant at the hearing: \"even if there were a conflict where a contract is governed by New York law and it contains both a specific and a general dispute resolution clause, the specific provision removes issues within its purview from the scope of the general arbitration clause.\"23 And to illustrate this principle, counsel for Claimant cited a number of New York cases applying it:\n\nEstablished case law... holds that disputes under agreements containing both specific and general arbitration clauses **must be arbitrated under the particularized clauses.24** (emphasis added)\n\nUnder normal circumstances, when an agreement includes two dispute resolution provisions, one specific (a valuation provision) and one general (a broad arbitration clause), **the specific provision will govern** those claims that fall within it.25 (emphasis added)\n\nTranscript, p. 94, lines 15-20.\n\n*Whirlpool Corp. v. Philips Elec., N.V. (In re Whirlpool Corp.),* 848 F.Supp. 474, 479 (S.D.N.Y. 1994), CLA-214.\n\n*Katz v. Feinberg,* 290 F.3d 95, 97 (2d Cir. 2002), CLA-211.\n\n75.\n\nA last comment is apposite. Counsel for the Government has provided the Tribunal with some modifications suggested by the Claimant on 16 June 2014 to the text of the *Deed of Settlement.* It appears that the Claimant proposed a clarification in Section 42 relating to the articulation of the three different arbitration clauses included in the *Deed of Settlement* by the addition of the following wording: **\"In addition to any rights conferred on the Parties in Section 32 and 35,** any dispute arising out of or in connection with this Deed, including any question regarding its existence, validity or termination, shall be referred to and finally resolved by arbitration in Singapore in accordance with the Arbitration Rules of the Singapore International Arbitration Centre.\" The Tribunal is aware of the fact that this addition was not retained in the final version of the *Deed of Settlement,* but it shows that at least the Claimant considered the different arbitration clauses to be cumulative and not mutually exclusive and it appears the Government did not seek any clarification to a contrary effect.\n\n76.\n\nFor all the mentioned reasons, the Tribunal considers that it has jurisdiction under Article 32 to proceed to the next phase of the argument presented by the parties.\n\n**VI. THE INTERPRETATION OF ARTICLE 6**\n---------------------------------------\n\n77.\n\nFor ease of reference the Tribunal repeats the essence of the settlement \"bargain\" as described in general terms by counsel for the Government:\n\nWe started negotiating on Thursday. We negotiated all day Friday. I imposed the terms, here are the terms: \"We pay them nothing; they dismiss their claims, they sell their casino for what they can get, and they leave Lao. Those are the terms.\" (Transcript, 17 June 2014, p. 25)\n\n\\* \\* \\*\n\nI told you, I imposed the terms. I\u2019ve been trying my best to make it possible for them to work the deal. So. any time they asked me for anything that would make it easier for them to sell, make it easier for them to do this or that, I would put it in the Agreement. I bent over backwards. (Transcript, 17 June 2014, p. 33) (emphasis added)\n\n78.\n\nThe Claimant\u2019s position is that breach of its monopoly rights in Savannakhet Province was a violation of Article 6 and delivered a fatal blow to the commercial foundation on which the settlement was constructed. If so, Article 32 potentially puts back in play the Claimant\u2019s pre-settlement claims of $690 million to $1 billion.\n\n79.\n\nThis aspect of the application presents a mixed question of fact and law.\n\n80.\n\nIn support of the allegation of breach of Article 6 the Claimant filed various newspaper reports and press releases naming as sources some developers active in the Special Economic Zone adjacent to the Savan Vegas Casino. The materials included a map which the Claimant says identifies the precise site of a planned rival casino. The allegations are denied by the Government, which notes that none of these \"announcements\" or plans were issued by official Government spokespersons.\n\n81.\n\nThe Claimant says that prior to this alleged derogation of its monopoly the Savan Vegas Hotel and Casino itself, as an operating business, but only one part of the Claimant\u2019s investment in Laos, was worth between $250 and $275 million.\n\n82.\n\nThe Claimant contends that the loss of the Savan Vegas monopoly position in Savannakhet Province drastically reduces the Casino\u2019s value because competition from rival casinos would reduce the expected income stream over the next 50 years and therefore reduce the present market value of the Savan Vegas Hotel and Casino by (it claims) more than 50%. More broadly, it claims, the Government\u2019s conduct depresses the value of its entire investment because any potential purchaser would not be inclined to trust the Government to fulfill its other obligations to investors in Laos.\n\n83.\n\n**The Tribunal emphasizes that it has not determined whether or not the Claimant has made** **even a** ***prima facie*** **case on the facts.** A certain amount of material and a number of witness statements have been filed on the monopoly controversy by both sides but at this stage of the proceeding, none of this factual material has been tested. The Tribunal is therefore in the uncomfortable position of being asked to determine a mixed question of fact and law without the benefit of a proper examination of the facts.\n\n**(v) The Legal Content of Article 6**\n--------------------------------------\n\n84.\n\nThe Government submits that the monopoly issue is of no concern to this Tribunal because Article 6, properly understood, does not protect and indeed has nothing to do with the Savan Vegas casino monopoly. In its submission Article 6 contains only one obligation and that is to extend the life of the project development agreements, licenses and land concessions to 50 years from 15 June 2014.\n\n**Article 6**\n\nLaos shall treat the Project Development Agreement (\"PDA\") dated 10 August 2007 in respect of the Savan Vegas Casino and each of the licenses and land concessions issued in respect of the Savan Vegas Casino, the Lao Bao Slot Club and the Savannakhet Ferry Terminal Slot Club (collectively the \"Gaming Assets\"), as being restated as of the Effective Date, with a term in each of fifty (50) years as from the Effective Date. ST owns 40% of the Lao Bao and Ferry Terminal Slot Clubs, (emphasis added)\n\nThe Claimant contends that, contrary to the Government\u2019s view, Article 6 contains two distinct obligations separated textually by the comma in the penultimate line.\n\n85.\n\nAs to the first (pre-comma) obligation, the Claimant contends that the reference to the PDA and other obligations in Article 6 \"as being restated\" means that they are incorporated sufficiently to revive the arbitration of pre-settlement losses in case of a *material* breach of one of the identified documents:\n\nWhat we said in our First Submission is, it was incorporated in reference sufficiently to bring in the protections of those agreements here to make sure that a buyer knew what he was getting. That's the same as what I said to you today, which is that Laos undertook the obligations to comply with those agreements in Article 6.26\n\nThe second distinct (post-comma) obligation, as the Government agrees, is to extend the existing project framework for another 50 years.\n\nTranscript, p. 146, lines 6-12.\n\n86.\n\nThe Claimant\u2019s essential argument is that Article 6 imposes an obligation enforceable by the Claimant against the Government to preserve the *status quo ante* established by the project agreements, licences and land concessions referred to, including in particular maintenance of the Savan Vegas monopoly rights and continuance of a Flat Tax Agreement which the Claimant says are key drivers of the casino\u2019s market value. The Government says the wording of Article 6 is incapable of supporting any such interpretation.\n\n87.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees with the Claimant that Article 6 embraces two obligations for the following reasons.\n\n**(i) A Textual Analysis**\n--------------------------\n\n88.\n\nThe Tribunal observes that the flow of the first sentence in Section 6 is interrupted by the placement of a comma after the first reference to \"Effective Date\". This makes the sentence susceptible of two possible readings. The comma may indicate a break between the two parts of the sentence in the sense that Laos shall restate the PDA licences and land concessions *and* the PDA licences and land concessions shall be extended to a fifty-year term. Alternatively, the phrase that follows the comma may simply be an explanation of the purpose and effect of the documents being \"restated\".\n\n89.\n\nIt must be said that in the case of the first alternative, it would have been clearer to break the sentence in two and openly state that there exists two different obligations with their corresponding verbs: \"to restate\" and \"to extend\". On the other hand, the second reading in fact eliminates the comma and raises the question of why it is necessary to repeat \"as from the Effective Date\" in respect of restated *and* in respect of the extension. If the sentence was intended to create only one obligation, then one reference would suffice.\n\n90.\n\nOn balance, the Tribunal finds that an examination of the text supports an intent to create two distinct obligations.\n\n**(ii) No Part of a Contractual Term Should be Interpreted as Superfluous**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n91.\n\nNew York law requires that meaningful effect be given to each part of Article 6. As stated in Banks, Glen, *New York Contract Law* (West\u2019s New York Practice Series) \u00a7 10:7:\n\nThe goal of contract construction is to avoid an interpretation that would leave a clause meaningless. A construction should be avoided if it ignores the interplay of the terms and renders one or more of the terms inoperable. An interpretation that gives effect to all the terms of an agreement is preferable to one that ignores terms or accords them an unreasonable interpretation. In interpreting a contract, a court will strive to give meaning to every sentence, clause and word, (emphasis added)\n\nThe Government\u2019s \"single obligation\" theory does not satisfy this test.\n\n**(iii) The Subsequent Conduct of the Parties**\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n92.\n\nThe Tribunal\u2019s view that Article 6 encompasses two obligations is reinforced by the exchange of emails between counsel to the parties in June 2014 subsequent to the Settlement. Counsel for the Claimant wrote:\n\nAs discussed at our meeting [with counsel for the Government], *we are restating* the PDA and related documents in a manner that would maximize the attractiveness to potential buyers. Having reviewed the PDA and other docs [sic], due to the garbled English and the fact that many of the provisions don't make sense now that the SV [Savan Vegas] is built, the most coherent and *best approach would be to redraft the agreements* (and not just attach an amendment).27 (emphasis added)\n\nSubmission on Legal Issues, para. 13 citing Ms. Amirfar's email (C-821). Emphasis in the original.\n\n93.\n\nCounsel for the Government replied:\n\nPDA and others: send us the redrafts of the PDA and you [sic] best convenience, and we will forward them to [the Government of Laos], Should you need input form [sic] us before sending the draft - as mentioned in your email - just let me know.28\n\nIbid. para. 14 citing email of Ms. Willems. Exhibit C-797.\n\n94.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view this exchange shows that at the very least the parties shared an intention to clean up and update the PDA and related documents, and that the restatement was not limited simply to an extension of the term in the agreement, licences and land concessions referred to. The Government\u2019s view is that such a \"clean up\" was a matter of courtesy not contractual obligation. The Claimant argues that a simple clean up of the documentation did not exhaust the content of the Article 6 obligation.\n\n95.\n\nHaving carefully considered the submissions the Tribunal is satisfied that Article 6 contains two obligations not one. The second obligation is not controversial. The extension has been confirmed in writing by the Government.\n\n96.\n\nAt issue, therefore, is the task of interpreting the content of the *first* Article 6 obligation.\n\n**VII. POSSIBLE INTERPRETATIONS OF ARTICLE 6**\n----------------------------------------------\n\n97.\n\nThe mandate of the Tribunal is limited to the interpretation and enforcement of obligations between the Claimant and the Government. The Tribunal\u2019s mandate is not to enforce the underlying agreements and licences which involve other parties, This Tribunal is concerned only with prre-settlement damages, and whether under the terms of the Settlement those claims have been revived by the Government\u2019s post-settlement conduct.\n\n98.\n\nThe Tribunal recognizes the merits of the legal arguments put forward on both sides of the controversy regarding the proper interpretation of Article 6. The text is convoluted and leaves scope for both of the contending positions.\n\n99.\n\nIn order to provide guidance to the parties the Tribunal will now outline its views of the competing interpretations of Article 6 urged by the Government, as well as a more \"purposive\" approach used by the Claimant, which might lead the Tribunal to a different result.\n\n100.\n\n**FIRST POSSIBLE INTERPRETATION: the words of Article 6 are not capable of** **supporting the interpretation urged by the Claimant. A breach of the monopoly provision of the** **Project Development Agreement, cannot give rise to a potential revival of the pre-settlement** **arbitration.**\n\n101.\n\nThe Claimant relies in its arguments on the text and context of Article 6 and on the purpose of the Deed of Settlement. As to the text, the Claimant contends that \"to treat as being restated\" means that the obligations owed by the Government to Savan Vegas under the PDA have now become obligations owed by the Government to the Claimant (who was not a party to the PDA) under the *Deed of Settlement.* The Claimant\u2019s argument treats the expressions \"to restate\", \"to affirm\", and \"to comply\" as if equivalent.\n\n102.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, the Claimant\u2019s argument necessarily seeks to incorporate by reference the terms of the PDA into the *Deed of Settlement,* which is not possible under New York law unless the parties' intention to do so is clear, and there is no such clarity in Article 6.\n\n103.\n\nTo \"restate\" in plain English means, \"to state or express over again or in a new way\",29 or \"put into more intelligible or convincing words\"30 or \"to say (something) again or in a different way especially to make the meaning clearer.\"31 While \"to treat\" means \"to act towards, behave to\". For the Tribunal, to read an obligation *to comply* into Article 6, as argued by Claimant, requires overcoming the significant hurdle that in no accepted definition of \"to restate\" does the term mean \"to incorporate\" or \"to comply with\". The combination with \"to treat\" is not helpful in this respect.\n\nThe Compact Oxford Dictionary\n\nThe Concise Oxford Dictionary\n\nMerriam-Webster Dictionary.\n\n104.\n\nTo breach the disparity between the plain meaning of \"to treat as being restated\" and the meaning attributed to this expression by the Claimant, the Tribunal would be required to accept the argument that the breached obligation under a restated instrument is also a breach of the obligation to restate. However, breach of a restated obligation does not mean that the obligation to restate is breached or without effect. To restate an obligation is to clarify it and, once restated, its breach may be easier to determine because it has been restated. For example Article 6 of the *Deed of Settlement* is \"restated\" in the Side Letter; the exchange of correspondence between counsel quoted above (paragraphs 92-93) is also an example of what \"to *restate\"* means; as would be the elimination from the PDA and related documents of the garbled language and the outdated provisions now that the Savan Vegas hotel and casino have been built.\n\n105.\n\nThe Claimant has also relied on the purpose and context of Article 6 to support its arguments. The Claimant has explained that Article 6 and the following three sections have as their purpose to facilitate the sale of the Gaming Assets and to maximize the proceeds of the sale, as required by Section 13. According to the Claimant, a breach of the exclusivity clause of the PDA would be in detriment of both.\n\n106.\n\nIt is evident from the correspondence of the Claimant and the Respondent referred to above (paragraphs 92-93) that the Claimant attached importance to cleaning up the garbled documents for the purpose of selling the Gaming Assets. As acknowledged by both counsel, the *Deed of Settlement* was drafted under great pressure in the course of three days prior to the scheduled start of the June hearing, and there was no time to engage in a \"clean up\" of the PDA and related documents. It is also undisputed that to extend the terms of the PDA and the licenses to 50 years was of assistance in attracting potential buyers. But the Claimant has argued that these items were not sufficient for the Claimant to give up its ability to pursue it claims before this Tribunal.\n\n107.\n\nAt the hearing, Mr. Rivkin stated in response to a question of a member of the Tribunal:\n\nThe object and purpose, the relationship of the Article 6 to the other terms of the Agreement made clear that the way we have interpreted makes sense, and that we were not going to give up a major protection, a major right we had, which was the ability to appear before you on June 17th and pursue our claims for close to a billion dollars without assurance that Laos was going to comply with its obligations to make the property saleable, it was not going to undercut it, and that if it did so in a material way, we could come back to you. And that's exactly the protection we negotiated for.32\n\nTranscript, page 152, lines 6 to 16. Counsel refers to the exchange of emails between Mmes. Amirfar and Willems. Highlighted by the Tribunal.\n\n108.\n\nIn replying to a follow-up question of a member of the Tribunal on the vast difference between an obligation to clean up a garbled text and, on the other hand, reading into Article 6 the elevation of any material breach of the underlying documents into a revival of the pre-settlement arbitration(s), Claimant's counsel replied:\n\n\"Well, it's not. Because the **restatement of the terms, the incorporation of the obligations into the Settlement Agreement** is shown by this because it shows how important the restatement of the Laos' obligations were to a potential buyer. It shows that both parties understood that, and that it had an obligation to carry out\u2014 **it undertook in the Settlement Deed the obligation to carry out its obligations under the PDA.** Otherwise, it would\u2014there would be no need to be redrafting for a buyer. That's why the **incorporation of the obligation in the PDA,** which is our position, is consistent with this exchange.\"33\n\nOn further questioning on the meaning of the obligation to restate beyond cleaning up an unclear document, Claimant's counsel replied:\n\nIt does give meaning. It gives meaning that we've argued for and that I think Members of the Tribunal have raised in their questioning. And then the question is, having undertaken the obligation **to restate and comply with the terms of the PDA,** what is the consequence? And I agree. The consequence isn't set out in these e-mails. The consequence is set out in Section 32. If you breach that obligation, and the obligation is **to restate** in a manner and **to reaffirm** the obligations in a manner that a buyer will be attracted to the property, then the consequence of breaching that obligation is set out in 32 because that would be a material breach, as we've argued, and because we would no longer be able to fulfill the mission of the Settlement, which is to sell for the maximum price. You have to read Article 6 in light of those other provisions.34\n\nOn this view, however, the Tribunal would still be at a loss to explain why \"to treat as being restated\" should be taken to mean \"to comply\".\n\nTranscript pages 153 lines 16-22 andl54 lines 1-9. Highlighted by the Tribunal.\n\nIbid. p. 154 lines 20-22 and p.155 lines 1-21. Highlighted by the Tribunal.\n\n109.\n\nTo \"treat as being restated\" is not an ambiguous term, it was chosen by experienced English-speaking counsel who had the opportunity to change it in the negotiations that immediately followed the signing of the *Deed of Settlement* and resulted in the Side Letter. If compliance with the PDA and related documents under the terms of the Deed was so crucial for the sale of what were termed \"the Gaming Assets\", it begs the question why such obligation would not have been expressed in clear and unambiguous terms.\n\n110.\n\nTo read into Article 6 the meaning urged by Claimant would mean that any breach of the obligations contained in the PDA and related documents could potentially become a material breach of the *Deed of Settlement.* This adds a far-reaching consequence to the phrase \"to treat as being restated\" that is not evident from the plain meaning of these terms.\n\n111.\n\nOn this view of the matter, once the text of the PDA and related documents has been cleaned up and restated, the Government undertook to treat the restated provisions as if the restatement had happened at the time of the Effective Date of the *Deed of Settlement.* This understanding of Article 6 gives meaning to all its terms and supports its purpose even if not to the extent contended by the Claimant.\n\n112.\n\nThe fundamental point is that *to restate or treat as being restated* and *to comply* are two distinct obligations. Restatement of a document may facilitate the determination of whether a covenant has been complied with because of the improved clarity as a result of the restatement exercise, but failure to comply with an obligation does not mean that that obligation has not been restated. It is not a question of whether it is necessary to use the term comply for a covenant to be obligatory. Of course, it is not. The question is whether \"to treat as restated\" may ever mean that a breach of a restated document is a breach of the obligation to restate without further support than the overall purpose of the *Deed of Settlement.*\n\n113.\n\nOn this view the breach of the monopoly set out in the PDA does not and indeed cannot constitute a breach of Article 6 of the *Deed of Settlement.*\n\n114.\n\n**THE SECOND POSSIBLE INTERPRETATION: flows from the emphasis of New York** **law on the object and purpose as well as the context of Article 6. The parties committed** **themselves in Article 13 to \"maximize the sale proceeds\". Violation of the monopoly guarantee** **would materially undermine the salability of the \"gambling assets\". It would destroy the basis** **of the settlement and, if established, justify a revival of the pre-settlement arbitration.**\n\n115.\n\nIn the interpretation of a contract New York law requires a court or Tribunal to have regard to:\n\ni. **the purpose** for which the contract was entered into,35\n\nii. **the circumstances known to the parties** at the time of contracting to determine their intention as expressed in the language they have employed,36\n\niii. the actual words used by the parties having due regard to context,37\n\niv. the need to avoid rendering a contractual term, or part of a term, **superfluous.38**\n\nAn authoritative statement of the principle is found in the *Restatement of the Law of Contracts* (2nd edition, American Law Institute) which states at Volume 5, Article 202:  \n**202. Rules in Aid of Interpretation**  \n (1) Words and other conduct are interpreted in the light of all the circumstances, and if the principal purpose of the parties is ascertainable it is given great weight, (emphasis added)  \n The related Commentary includes the following:  \n c. Principal purpose. The purposes of the parties to a contract are not always identical; particularly in business transactions, the parties often have divergent or even conflicting interests. But up to a point they commonly join in a common purpose of attaining a specific factual or legal result which each regards as necessary to the attainment of his ultimate purposes.\n\nThe Restatement continues:  \n Determination that the parties have a principal purpose in common requires interpretation, but if such a purpose is disclosed further interpretation is guided by it. Even language which is otherwise explicit may be read with any modification needed to make it consistent with such a purpose, (emphasis added)  \n The same purposive approach to contractual interpretation is emphasized in a leading American text, Corbin on Contracts Vol 5 (1998), at para. 24.10, p. 63:  \n Extrinsic evidence consists of evidence other than the contract itself. The term \"extrinsic\" means that such evidence derives from a source \"outside of\u2019 the contract, whether the contract terms are written or oral.  \nIt is invariably necessary, before a court can give any meaning to the words of a contract and can select one meaning rather than other possible ones as the basis for the determination of rights and other legal effects, that extrinsic evidence be admitted to make the court aware of the surrounding circumstances, (emphasis added)\n\nAs Lord Hoffman, not a New York judge but speaking in terms consistent with New York law, stated:  \n The meaning which a document (or any other utterance) would convey to a reasonable man is not the same thing as the meaning of its words. The meaning of words is a matter of dictionaries and grammars; the meaning of the document is what the parties using those words against the relevant background would reasonably have been understood to mean. *{Investors Compensation Scheme Ltd. v. West Bromwich Building Society,* [1998] 1 All E.R. 98 (H.L.) per Lord Hoffman at p. 115.)  \n A more elegant formulation of the distaste of the common law for an unduly formalistic or literal approach was delivered in classic form by Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes who wrote:  \n A word is not a crystal, transparent and unchanged; it is the skin of a living thought and may vary greatly in colour and content according to the circumstances and the time in which it is used.  \n*Towne v. Eisner,* 245 U.S. 418, 425 (1918).\n\nAs stated in Banks, Glen, Acur *York Contract Law* (West\u2019s New York Practice Series, 2006) \u00a710:7:  \n The goal of contract construction is to avoid an interpretation that would leave a clause meaningless. A construction should be avoided if it ignores the interplay of the terms and renders one or more of the terms inoperable. An interpretation that gives effect to all the terms of an agreement is preferable to one that ignores terms or accords them an unreasonable interpretation. In interpreting a contract, a court will strive to give meaning to every sentence, clause and word. (emphasis added)\n\n116.\n\nA Tribunal, seeking to put itself in the position occupied by the parties at the time the *Deed of Settlement* was concluded, would recognize not only the tortured history of the dealings between the Claimant and the Government but also their mutual objective to speed the Claimant\u2019s departure from Laos by efforts directed to *''maximize* sale proceeds to the Claimants and Laos... \" (Article 13). It is of no significance, in this respect, that Article 13 is not listed in Article 32. Article 13 is not relied upon as a ground to reinstate the arbitration. However, it serves as an authoritative agreed-upon statement of the *purpose* or *objective* of the parties at the time the contract was made and is part of the appropriate framework within which to interpret the relevant terms of the Surrender Deed.\n\n117.\n\nThe most important aspect of the *commercial* context is that the Claimant receives nothing from the Government except an opportunity to sell its assets for whatever price it can get. (The Claimant also wanted to protect itself and its principals from criminal investigation but that is not a matter that concerns the sales protocol). The Government did not agree in the settlement to pay any compensation in respect of the pre-settlement claims. Accordingly if money is to be made available to offset those alleged pre-settlement losses and pave the way for the Claimant\u2019s exit from Laos, the money must come from a third party purchaser. The value of the hotel is related largely to the existence of the casino, which is what attracts the clientele, and in the eyes of a prospective purchaser the monopoly39 and a continued Flat Tax Agreement is what puts the whole Savan Vegas operation on a firm and predictable financial foundation. The Government for its part, made no secret of its wish to be rid of the Claimant as soon as possible. Accordingly, for the purposes of contractual interpretation, the \"common objective\" was to expedite the sale of the hotel and gambling assets at the best price obtainable.\n\nThe Project Development Agreement between Savan Vegas Entertainment Hotel and Casino in Savannakhet Province and the Government dated 10 August 2007 recognizes the monopoly rights in Article 24: 24. The Company has been granted monopoly rights Tor its Casino business operations only with the condition that the Government shall not approve and grant any other parties or entities who put up their applications Tor the operation of certain Casino business in the three (3) neighbouring provinces close to the Project development zone of the Company namely: Savannakhet, Khammouane and Bolikhamsay, throughout the concession period of 50 years.  \n Reference may also be made to Article 22 of the Deed of Settlement, which deals with development of a parcel of 90 hectares of land adjacent to the Savan Vegas hotel and casino property. It provides in part that development will be \"on the basis that no gaming activities whatsoever will be allowed at or in connection with that 90 hectare site. The Government thereby put the Claimant on notice that its policy to refuse new gambling licences in Savannakhet Province would be applied to the Claimant as well as to other potential investors.\n\n118.\n\nIn this situation the exercise of Government power can facilitate, or, on the other hand, effectively wreck opportunities for a sale at an attractive price. Given the parties\u2019 statement in Article 13 that their joint and common purpose is to \"maximize sale proceeds\", the interpretation of the terms of Article 6 must be guided by this objective.\n\n119.\n\nThe Government does not dispute that the grant of casino licence(s) to rival operators in Savannakhet province would undermine the value of the Claimant\u2019s casino assets whose sale the Settlement is intended to facilitate. The Government\u2019s positions are that (1) it has not done so and (2) if the Claimant wishes to persist in its \"frivolous\" claim that the Government has breached its obligation in respect of monopoly rights, the remedy is for the Claimant\u2019s subsidiary Savan Vegas to initiate a SIAC arbitration. The Claimant says that consistently with the purpose of the *Deed of Settlement* it is only the risk of a revival of the /\u00bbre-settlement claim that would provide a major incentive for the Government to cooperate in the sale of the Claimant\u2019s gambling facilities.\n\n120.\n\nWhat then is the contractual significance of the words \"Laos shall treat [obligations it owes, directly or indirectly, to the Claimant\u2019s subsidiaries] *as being restated\"* in favour of the Claimant, which is not otherwise a beneficiary of those existing Government promises? As Laos is the only promisor under Article 6, and the Claimant is the only promisee, then unless these words in Article 6 are to be treated as superfluous, Article 6 must confer rights on the Claimant not previously owed to it by the Government. The rights listed in Article 6 involving the subsidiary companies [PDA, licences, land concessions] already exist. They are not creatures of the settlement. What must be new is that breach of these existing obligations by the Government now confers a contractual right on the other party to the settlement, the new promisee, the Claimant.\n\n121.\n\nIf this is the context of the first obligation of Article 6 what then is the remedy for breach? According to Article 32 the remedy for breach of Article 6 is the right to pursue a revival of the pre-settlement claims PROVIDING the effect of the Government\u2019s failure to respect the rights and obligations referred to in Article 6 is to MATERIALLY frustrate the commercial purpose and object of the Settlement, which is the sale of the Claimant\u2019s hotel and gambling assets on a basis that will MAXIMIZE sale proceeds.\n\n122.\n\nThe opening words of Article 6 are that \"Laos shall treat the Project Development Agreement, etc. etc.\" (emphasis added). By this language Laos is not agreeing to \"incorporate by reference\" but simply to \"treat\" a breach of an obligation under the Project Development Agreement licences or land concessions as a trigger to reopen the issue of /\u00bbre-settlement damages.\n\n123.\n\nOn this view, such an interpretation facilitates accomplishment of the purpose of the Settlement (which, so far as the Government is concerned, includes speeding the exit of the Claimant from Laos). Article 6 is, in a way, a \"standstill agreement\". The value of the Claimant\u2019s assets, whatever it may have been on the date of the Settlement, is to be protected from *material* devaluation *by unilateral* Government action such as the grant of gambling licenses to rival casinos.\n\n124.\n\nThe obligation of the Government \"to treat\" is not conditional on the creation of fresh documentation. The 2007 Project Development Agreement is not a lengthy or complex document. The operative part is fewer than 17 pages long. A sophisticated purchaser with $250 million or more to spend on the Savan Vegas Hotel and Casino would not require a \"restated\" document in order to clue into the fact the hotel is built and the casino is an ongoing business.\n\n125.\n\nThe operative obligation is \"to treat\" not to \"restate\". A present obligation \"to treat as being restated\" cannot be interpreted to mean a future obligation to prepare fresh documentation, however desirable such an exercise may be for marketing purposes. While it is no doubt an attractive marketing tool to have \"cleaned up and updated\" documents, that is not what Article 6 is all about. The Government agrees in Article 6 to \"treat\" the paperwork \"as BEING\" restated... \" The expression \"being restated\" does not mean \"to be restated in due course\" with or without retrospective effect.\n\n126.\n\nAs to the difference between \"to restate\" and \"to comply,\" the other terms referred to in Article 32 of the *Deed of Settlement* for the most part do not refer specifically to compliance. There was no necessity for them to do so. Article 8, for example, provides that a new Flat Tax Agreement will be established to apply throughout the 50 year term of the Project Development Agreement but there is no separate statement, nor is there need for any, that \"this provision is to be complied with\". Yet the Government is taking the Claimant to SIAC because of the Claimant\u2019s alleged foot-dragging in naming its appointee to the \"Flat Tax Committee\" contemplated by Article 9.\n\n127.\n\nIn paragraph 70 above, in dealing with the issue of jurisdiction, the Tribunal stated that \"the power of interpretation is inherent in the power of application\". Here, similarly, the duty to comply is inherent in the restatement of contractual obligations owed by the Government to the Claimant\u2019s subsidiaries. Without compliance the restatement is of no contractual significance.\n\n128.\n\nTo summarize, in Article 6 the Government undertakes \"to *treat* [the relevant obligations] as *being* restated as of the Effective Date.\" The Government was already obligated to comply with the relevant obligations in the underlying documents before the settlement. At that time non-compliance would have given rise to remedies at the suit of the Claimant\u2019s operating companies, but not at the suit of the Claimant itself. What is new in the *Deed of Settlement* is that as between the Government and the Claimant (which is not a party to the pre-existing obligations) non-compliance becomes a *trigger* for an application *by the Claimant* to the Tribunal for a reinstatement of the /ire-settlement claims.\n\n**VIII. FAIRNESS REQUIRES FURTHER SUBMISSIONS ON THE PROPER INTERPRETATION OF ARTICLE 6**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n129.\n\nFairness requires that the Tribunal not adopt an interpretation of Article 6 that may be dispositive of the Application but which departs somewhat from the submissions of the parties and has not been squarely put to the parties for their comment and submissions.\n\n130.\n\nThe Tribunal\u2019s dilemma is as follows. The Government has put forward a textual argument which does not appear to take into account the insistence of New York law on a **purposive** approach to contractual interpretation. What is put against the Government is encapsulated in the proposition that \"the meaning of words is a matter of dictionaries and grammars; the meaning of the document is what the parties using those words against the relevant background would reasonably have been understood to mean.\"40 Counsel for the Government has not, in the view of the Tribunal, squarely addressed this divergence of texture from purposive principles of interpretation which could become dispositive of the outcome of the Application.\n\nLord Hoffman, *supra* note 37.\n\n131.\n\nOn the other hand, the argument of the Claimant was very much geared to the purpose of the settlement and its commercial concerns without acknowledging the difficulty of reconciling these broader considerations with the actual words used by the parties in Article 6. If Article 6 says what the Claimant says it means why wasn\u2019t the intention expressed in clear and unambiguous terms? Can it fairly be said that the language used gave the Government adequate notice of the extent of the obligations which, on the Claimant\u2019s interpretation, the Government was undertaking? The arguable dissonance between purpose and text was not a matter squarely addressed by Claimant\u2019s counsel at the 14 October 2014 hearing, and the Tribunal is reluctant to render a final decision on this issue without further assistance of counsel for both sides.\n\n**IX. CONCLUSION**\n------------------\n\n132.\n\nThe Tribunal has set out alternative interpretations of Article 6 because of its concerns that on 14 October 2014 the parties failed to fully address the different contractual approaches to the interpretation of Article 6. From different approaches to interpretation may flow different outcomes. The Tribunal recognizes that its characterization of the opposing positions set out above, while in general terms reflecting the position of the parties, nevertheless introduces in each case some new points of argument which neither party has had an opportunity to address. To ensure fairness to both parties the Tribunal invites any further submissions counsel may wish to make.\n\n133.\n\nIn addition, the Tribunal now having ruled that it does have *jurisdiction* to deal with the Claimant\u2019s application wishes to hear from both parties\u2019 witnesses before making a final ruling on the merits of the Application, which raises mixed questions of fact and law.\n\n134.\n\nThe potentially dispositive issue raised by the Government is one of fact. Did the Government violate the terms of the monopoly granted in 2007? If so, the legal question arises whether its conduct, **if established by the evidence,** is *material* to the revival or non-revival of the /\u00bbre-settlement arbitrations. The Tribunal has had the advantage of the parties\u2019 submissions to date on the law but has not yet had the benefit of hearing and testing the factual assertions of their witnesses.\n\n135.\n\nIn the view of the Tribunal, no legal arguments have yet been presented that would justify a refusal to hear the factual evidence to determine whether, under the terms of the *Deed of Settlement,* the Claimant\u2019s claim to /\u00bbre-settlement damages is to be reinstated.\n\n**X. INTERIM RULING**\n---------------------\n\n136.\n\nGiven the ambiguous wording of Section 6 of the *Deed of Settlement* on which the Claimant relies, and the difficulty of making any final disposition of the remaining legal arguments in the absence of any factual evidence to provide context to the dispute, the Tribunal rules that:\n\ni. It has jurisdiction to hear the case presented to it and rejects the Respondent\u2019s Objection to its jurisdiction;\n\nii. A further hearing is to be held as soon as may be practicable to hear and consider the factual evidence concerning the alleged breach of the *Deed of Settlement,* at which time the Tribunal wishes to hear further argument from counsel on the legal issues hereinbefore set forth."}, {"Title": "Decision on Claimant\u2019s Second Application for Provisional Measures", "Type": "Interim & Provisional Measures", "Date": "2015-03-18T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Decision on Claimant\u2019s Second Application for Provisional Measures\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**I. Introduction**\n-------------------\n\nA hearing on the Claimant's second application for provisional measures was held by telephone conference on 10 March 2015.\n\nParticipating during the call were:\n\nMembers of the Tribunal:\n\nJudge Ian Binnie, President of the Tribunal\n\nProf. Brigitte Stern, Arbitrator\n\nProf. Bernard Hanotiau, Arbitrator\n\nICSID Secretariat:\n\nMs. Anneliese Fleckenstein, Secretary of the Tribunal\n\nMs. Mercedes Cordido-Freytes de Kurowski, Legal Counsel, ICSID\n\nParticipating on behalf of the Claimant:\n\nMr. David W. Rivkin, Debevoise & Plimpton LLP\n\nMr. Chrispoher Tahbaz, Debevoise & Plimpton LLP\n\nMs. Samantha Rowe, Debevoise & Plimpton LLP\n\nMr. Corey Whiting, Debevoise & Plimpton LLP\n\nMr. John K. Baldwin, Lao Holdings N.V., Sanum Investments Limited\n\nMr. Shawn Scott, Lao Holdings N.V., Sanum Investments Limited\n\nMs. Deborah Deitsch-Perez\n\nParticipating on behalf of the Respondent:\n\nProf. Don Wallace, Georgetown University\n\nMr. John Branson, Parker Poe Adams & Bernstein\n\nMr. Nicholas Birch\n\n1.\n\nThis is a second Application for an Order for Provisional Measures (\"PMO\") brought by the Claimant, Lao Holdings N.V., a national of Aruba, Netherlands (the \"Claimant\").\n\n2.\n\nThe initial PMO application was made (and granted) in an arbitration initiated against the Respondent, the Government of the Lao People's Democratic Republic (the \"Government\" or simply the \"Respondent\") by Notice of Arbitration dated 14 August 2012, pursuant to Article 9 of the *Agreement on Encouragement and Reciprocal Protection of Investments Between the Lao People's Democratic Republic and the Kingdom of the Netherlands* (the \"BIT Treaty\"). The procedure is governed by the Arbitration Rules (\"Additional Facility\") of the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (the \"ICSID-AF Arbitration Rules\").\n\n3.\n\nIn that arbitration, the Claimant asserted a claim of US $690 million on account of its investments in gambling and tourism facilities located in the Lao PDR said to be at risk of *de facto* expropriation by acts of the Respondent for the benefit of itself and certain Laotian nationals. The Claimant's principal asset is Sanum Investments Limited, a Laotian company wholly owned by the Claimant since 17 January 2012, which in turn owns the Savan Vegas Hotel and Casino, a large hotel and conference center with extensive gambling facilities, plus other assets elsewhere in Laos.\n\n**II. The Settlement of the BIT Arbitration**\n---------------------------------------------\n\n4.\n\nOn 15 June 2014, at the hearing on the merits in Singapore, the parties made a settlement of the BIT arbitration by a Deed of Settlement dated 15 June 2014 and its Side Letter dated 18 June 2014. Upon the parties' joint request, the Tribunal issued an Order on Consent suspending the BIT arbitration as of 19 June 2014.\n\n5.\n\nThe settlement process was described in general terms on 17 June 2014 by counsel for the Government as follows:\n\nWe started negotiating on Thursday. We negotiated all day Friday. I imposed the terms, here are the terms: \"We pay them nothing; they dismiss their claims, they sell their casino for what they can get, and they leave Lao. Those are the terms.\" (Transcript, 17 June 2014, p. 25)\n\n6.\n\nThe Deed of Settlement contemplated negotiations of a Flat Tax arrangement within 45 days of 15 June 2014. The Claimant would then have ten months to complete a sale, with an extension of time if necessary to accommodate a closing date. During that time the Claimant and its affiliates would continue to run the businesses subject to the \"monitoring and oversight\" of the Government's agent, RMC Gaming Management LLC (\"RMC\"). At the end of 10 months, if no sale has materialized, \"the Claimants and Laos shall have the right to appoint RMC or any other qualified operator\" to step in and manage the gambling assets \"in place of the Claimants until the sale is complete\" (Article 12 of the Deed of Settlement).\n\n7.\n\nThe Claimant's financial claims against the Government for conduct *pre* -dating the settlement were nevertheless subject to revival in the event of a *post* -settlement material breach of certain of the terms identified in Article 32 of the Deed of Settlement itself.1 The jurisdiction of the Tribunal in the present case is grounded on the provision in Article 32 giving it jurisdiction to \"determine whether or not there has been such a material breach and shall only revive the arbitration if they conclude that there has been such a material breach\".\n\n**Article 32**  \n The Claimants shall only be permitted to revive the arbitration in the event that Laos is in material breach of Sections 5 - 8, 15, 21 - 23, 25, 27 or 28 above and only after reasonable written notice is given to Laos by the Claimants of such breach and such breach is not remedied within 45 days after receipt of notice of such breach. The Sale Deadline and any other relevant time periods herein shall be extended by the length of time required to cure such breach. In the event that there is a dispute as to whether or not Laos is in material breach of Section 5 - 8, 15, 21 - 23, 25, 27 or 28 above, the Tribunals shall determine whether or not there has been such a material breach and shall only revive the arbitration if they conclude that there has been such a material breach.\n\n**III. Claimant's Allegations of Material Breach of the Settlement Agreement**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n8.\n\nShortly after the suspension of the ICSID arbitration, the Claimant filed an *\"Application for Finding of Material Breach of Deed of Settlement and for Reinstatement of Arbitration\".* The ground for relief was an allegation that the Respondent Government had granted gambling concession(s) to third parties in breach of the Savan Vegas casino monopoly rights, thereby ending (the Claimant said) any possibility of an advantageous sale.\n\n9.\n\nOn 14 October 2014, the Tribunal heard submissions from the parties on the legal objections to the Tribunal's jurisdiction raised by the Respondent concerning the Material Breach Application. On 19 December 2014, the Tribunal issued an Interim Ruling on Issues Arising under the Deed of Settlement, upholding its jurisdiction to hear the Material Breach claim under Article 32 of the Deed of Settlement.\n\n10.\n\nArticle 32 identifies a number of provisions of the Deed of Settlement which, if materially breached, would lead to a revival of the BIT arbitration including, in particular, Article 6 which (as clarified by the Side Letter) provides as follows:\n\nArticle 6\n\nLaos shall treat the Project Development Agreement (\"PDA\") dated 10 August 2007 in respect of the Savan Vegas Casino and each of the licenses and land concessions issued in respect of the Savan Vegas Casino, the Lao Bao Slot Club and the Savannakhet Ferry Terminal Slot Club (collectively the \"Gaming Assets\"), as being restated as of the Effective Date, with a term in each of fifty (50) years as from the Effective Date. ST owns 40% of the Lao Bao and Ferry Terminal Slot Clubs. (emphasis added)\n\nMuch of the present dispute revolves around the disagreement of the parties about the meaning and effect of the underlined words in Article 6. As outlined in the Tribunal's Interim Ruling on 19 December 2015, the Claimant contends, and the Respondent denies, that if the Respondent Government is in breach of the Project Development Agreement by authorizing the building a rival casino within the geographic monopoly awarded to Savan Vegas, the effect is not only to revive the BIT arbitration but to rescind the entire settlement. The Respondent Government's position is that revival of the BIT arbitration would leave the Deed of Settlement otherwise intact, and under Articles 11 and 12 thereof, it is entitled as of 15 April 2015 to cause RMC, a qualified gambling operator, to \"step in and manage the Gaming Assets\" of the Claimant until a sale is completed, and thereafter to complete the sale.\n\n**IV. Second Application For An Order For Provisional Measures**\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n11.\n\nPursuant to Article 46 of the ICSID-AF Arbitration Rules, the Claimant submitted a second Request for Provisional Measures on 19 January 2015, to preserve what it considered to be the *status quo ante* pending the Tribunal's consideration of the merits of the Material Breach Application.\n\n12.\n\nIn general terms, the Claimant alleges that the Respondent Government has threatened to take measures putting at risk the effectiveness of any relief the Claimant may obtain in its effort to revive the BIT Arbitration, rescind the Settlement Deed and Side Letter. More specifically, the Claimant seeks to enjoin the Government from:\n\n(i) taking control of, or taking any steps towards the sale of, Claimants' rights and assets, and in particular, seizing the management and control of its \"Gaming Assets\" effective 15 April 2015 and moving to sell the casino, notwithstanding the pendency of Article 32 proceeding;\n\n(ii) retroactively applying a 45% tax on gross gaming revenues of the Savan Vegas Casino in the interim;\n\n(iii) declaring that it will treat Lao Holdings' rights to obtain a land concession and project development agreement for Thakhaek as forfeited and void; and\n\n(iv) taking any steps that would alter the *status quo* or otherwise aggravate the dispute.\n\n13.\n\nAs part of the relief sought, Claimant commits to paying the amount ordered in the First Provisional Measures Order, US$429,330, into escrow on the first day of each month, with retroactive effect to 1 July 2014.The Claimant contends, and the Respondent Government denies, that a finding of material breach would not only revive the BIT arbitration but have the effect, as a matter of the governing New York law, of rescission of the entire Deed of Settlement.2 The Claimant argues that the provisional measures it requests are necessary to protect its rights if the Deed of Settlement is rescinded. According to the Respondent Government however, the Claimant \"is asking the Tribunal to act outside the [Material Breach] proceeding and grant Claimant through provisional measures the relief it ultimately seeks through its Material Breach claim (release from its obligations under the Deed).\"\n\nThe Claimant seeks from the Tribunal a \"declaration that Laos materially breached Section 6 of the Settlement and an order rescinding the Settlement and reviving the BIT Arbitration.\" Claimant's Response, para. 18 (emphasis added).\n\n14.\n\nThe Thakhaek issue is moot as the Government is not now proposing to take any unilateral action concerning the Thakhaek property, but has filed an amended claim in an arbitration pending before the Singapore International Arbitration Centre (SIAC) seeking a declaration that Claimant has waived its rights to the Thakhaek property.\n\n15.\n\nMoreover, the claim to a provisional measures order generally prohibiting the Respondent Government from \"taking any steps that would alter the *status quo* or otherwise aggravate the dispute\" is too broad and general. The parties to a proceeding are entitled to know with precision what acts are prohibited and what acts are permitted so that they may conduct themselves accordingly.\n\n**V. Prerequisites to an Order for Provisional Measures**\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n16.\n\nThe elements the Claimant must establish to obtain Provisional Measures are the following: (i) *prima facie* jurisdiction, (ii) *prima facie* establishment of the right to the relief sought, (iii) urgency or (imminent danger of serious prejudice), (iv) necessity, and (v) proportionality.3\n\n*Caratube International Oil v. Kazakhstan*, ICSID Case No. ARB/13/13, Decision on Provisional Measures [2014]; *Amco Asia v. Indonesia*, ICSID Case No. ARB/81/1 [1983]; *Plama Consortium Ltd. v. Bulgaria*, ICSID Case No. ARB/03/24 [2005], para. 40; *Sergei Paushok v. Mongolia*, UNCITRAL, Order of Interim Measures [2008], para. 92.10; *Railroad Development Corporation v. Guatemala*, ICSID Case No. ARB/07/23, Decision on Provisional Measures [2008], para. 35; *See, e.g.* *City Oriente Ltd. v. Ecuador*, ICSID Case No. ARB/06/21, Decision on Revocation of Provisional Measures [2008], para. 20\n\n17.\n\nThe Tribunal is mindful of the caution expressed in *Phoenix Action Ltd. v. Czech Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/06/05, Decision on Provisional Measures [2007]:\n\nProvisional measures are indeed not deemed to give to the party requesting them more rights than it ever possessed and has title to claim. In other words, provisional measures are deemed to maintain the *status quo,* not to improve the situation of the Claimant before the rendering of the Tribunal's award. The Tribunal considers that, far from seeking to maintain the *status quo*, the recommendations sought by the Claimant are plainly directed to affect a fundamental change to it, by improving the Claimant's situation. (emphasis added) (para. 37)\n\n**VI.** ***Prima Facie*** **Jurisdiction to Grant Provisional Measures**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n18.\n\nThe Tribunal having determined in its ruling dated 19 December 2014, that it does have jurisdiction pursuant to Article 32 of the Deed of Settlement in respect of the Material Breach Application, it follows that the Tribunal has jurisdiction to grant Provisional Measures, provided the other criteria are met, to protect the potential revival of the BIT Arbitration.\n\n19.\n\nAt this point, the Tribunal is not exercising jurisdiction as an ICSID Tribunal under the BIT Treaty and has no authority to grant provisional measures in that capacity.\n\n20.\n\nThe Provisional Measures Application is directed solely at the dispute over which the Tribunal does have jurisdiction under Article 32, namely the dispute arising out of the alleged violation of Article 6 of the Deed of Settlement.\n\n21.\n\nAlthough, there is no mention in the Deed of Settlement of a power to grant provisional measures, the Tribunal considers that it has such inherent power in order to fulfill its jurisdictional mission. It can be mentioned here, for example, that, although the Iran-U.S. Claims Tribunal could apply Article 26 of the UNCITRAL Rules that were adopted by it, which provided for the possibility to grant provisional measures, it placed in fact great emphasis on its inherent power to issue interim measures \"as may be necessary to conserve the respective rights of the Parties and to ensure that the tribunal's jurisdiction and authority are made fully effective.\"4\n\nIt must be noted that, when the tribunal first addressed a request for interim relief, it based the measures it ordered not on Article 26 but on its inherent power. *See* George H. A Ldrich, The Jurisprudence of the Iran-United States Claims Tribunal, 137-38 (Clarendon Press 1996).\n\n**VII.** ***Prima Facie*** **Establishment of the Right to the Relief Sought?**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n22.\n\nLao Holdings has at this stage put forward a slender claim to the relief sought under Article 32 of the Settlement Agreement\n\n*(a) Revival of the Arbitration and Rescission of the Deed of Settlement*\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n23.\n\nThis right that the Claimant asks the Tribunal to protect could only be based on a finding of a violation of the Claimant's monopoly rights. The Claimant's evidence of material breach to date consists largely of hearsay evidence and disputed press reports, together with an affidavit of John Baldwin based on belief rather than any direct evidence supporting the assertion that the Government is planning to licence a rival casino in an area to which Savan Vegas claims monopoly gambling rights.\n\n24.\n\nThe Tribunal's Interim Ruling dated 19 December 2014 states that \"(t)he Tribunal emphasizes that it has not determined whether or not the Claimant has made even a *prima facie* case on the facts\". [para. 83]\n\n25.\n\nIt is true, as this Tribunal affirmed in its first Provisional Measures Order, that in order to determine whether Claimant has established a right to Provisional Measures, the Tribunal need not go beyond whether a reasonable case has been made which, if the facts alleged are proven, might possibly lead the Tribunal to the conclusion that an award could be made in favour of Claimants. Essentially, the Tribunal needs to decide only that the claims made are not, on their face, frivolous or obviously outside the competence of the Tribunal. [para. 15]\n\n26.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, the Claimant has not met the requisite standard of proof to justify the issuance of a Provisional Measures Order at this time. The hearing of 13-14 April 2015 has precisely as one of its objectives, to ascertain whether or not the right the Claimant asks this Tribunal to protect - the right to revive the arbitration because its monopoly rights have allegedly been violated - exists.\n\n*(b) Relief from Imposition of the 45% Tax in Gaming Revenue*\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n27.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, the Claimant has not established a case for relief from the collection of the 45% tax on gross gaming revenues enacted in October 2014.\n\n28.\n\nThe original Provisional Measures Order (in the BIT arbitration) prohibited the Respondent Government from taking action to collect an 80% income tax levy plus 10% VAT amounting to 90% of the casino's income.\n\n29.\n\nThe Tribunal has not been called on to consider let alone adjudicate the 45% tax that was enacted into law after the 15 June 2014 settlement. Article 34 of the Deed of Settlement, as amended by the Side Letter provides:\n\nIn the event that the arbitration is revived pursuant to clause 32 above, neither the Claimants nor Laos shall be permitted to add any new claims or evidence to the arbitration nor seek any additional reliefs (sic) not already sought in the proceedings.\n\n30.\n\nPrior to the end of December 2014, Savan Vegas had paid taxes pursuant to a Flat Tax Agreement which has neither been extended nor renegotiated.\n\n31.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the Government was quite prepared to proceed with the renegotiation of a Flat Tax Agreement under the Terms of the Settlement and in fact appointed its nominee early in July 2014. The Claimant has refused to participate as part of its broader disagreement with the Government of Laos over the status of the Deed of Settlement.\n\n32.\n\nWhen the Flat Tax Agreement expired on 31 December 2014, Savan Vegas became subject to the applicable tax laws of Laos. It is common ground that although Savan Vegas has continued to do business in Laos, it has not paid taxes either directly or in escrow since 1 January 2015. While it now offers to pay in escrow the sum of US$429,300 per month retroactive to 1 January 2015, there is no obligation on the Government to agree to such a figure or to any escrow arrangement.\n\n33.\n\nThe Government contends, and the Claimant denies, that it is open to the Government to have the Flat Tax Committee constituted without the cooperation of the Claimant by resorting under Article 9 of the Deed of Settlement, to the President of the Macao Society of Registered Accountants. The Claimant does not agree. However, this Tribunal is not seized with that issue.\n\n34.\n\nThe Claimant argues that its original claim regarding taxation in this arbitration was not limited to the 80% New Tax Law but was more generally \"that the Respondent is attempting to use the tax law to expropriate Savan Vegas - the claim is not limited to a particular rate.\" [Claimant's Response, footnote 72] However, for so long as the Claimant continues to do business in Laos, it can reasonably expect to be bound by the Laotian income tax laws applicable to gambling casinos unless and until a new Flat Tax Agreement is negotiated.5\n\n*RosInvest Co. UK Ltd. v. Russian Federation*, SCC Case No 079/2005, Final Award [2010], para. 574. *Quasar de Valores SICA SC and ors. v. Russian Federation*, SCC Case No 24/2007, Award [2012], para. 181\n\n35.\n\nIt appears from the record that the Government has initiated standard collection procedures which require a series of three notices of which the first was delivered in January 2015. The Government has offered to \"suspend the tax invoices that have been sent to Claimant pending the determination of the new flat tax (assuming Claimant does not interfere in the procedure)\" provided that as of 15 April 2015 the Claimant yields \"managing and operating of Gaming Assets\" to RMC under Article 12 of the Settlement Deed. These conditions are not satisfactory to the Claimant.\n\n36.\n\nThe Tribunal concludes that the Claimant has not made out a case for relief from compliance with the current Laotian tax laws.\n\n*(c) Preservation of the Claimant's Management and Control of its Gaming Assets Until the Material Breach Application is Determined*\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n37.\n\nThe issue arises only under Article 12 of the Deed, wherein an operator is authorized to \"step in and operate the Gaming Assets in place of Claimants until the sale is completed and complete the sale...\"\n\n38.\n\nThe Respondent Government points out that the change in control contemplated by Section 12 of the Deed of Settlement is entirely new in the Deed and did not pre-exist it. According to the Government, \"if Claimant believes the Government is breaching Section 12 of the Deed, the appropriate forum in which to seek relief is in the SIAC proceeding.\"\n\n39.\n\nThat said, however, the change in control is a live issue in the Material Breach Application by reason of the rescission argument put forward by the Claimant.\n\n40.\n\nWhile the Tribunal is of the view that the Claimant's evidence to date of the alleged material breach falls short even of the standard required to support a Provisional Measures Order, the Government's stated intention to put RMC in charge of the \"gaming assets\" is only effective from and after April 15, 2015. In the meantime, the Tribunal will have an opportunity to have the evidence of both parties tested at the hearing on the merits of the Material Breach Application on 13 and 14 April 2015. It will be open to the Tribunal at the conclusion of the evidence to determine whether the record warrants a Provisional Measures Order keeping Savan Vegas in control of the Gaming Assets pending the Tribunal's decision on the merits of the Material Breach Application.\n\n41.\n\nIt is quite true, as the Respondent Government points out, that irrespective of the evidence, there remain some difficult questions of interpretation of Article 6 itself. However, to resolve those issues at this stage (as the Tribunal itself noted on 19 December 2014) would be to prejudge a mixed question of fact and law before the evidence is heard and the parties have been given an opportunity to make full submissions on the legal issues identified in that Ruling.\n\n**VIII. Urgency**\n-----------------\n\n42.\n\nAs stated, the Government intends to have RMC, an entity considered by both parties in the Settlement Deed to be an acceptable manager, take over the control and management of the Claimant's gaming assets on 15 April 2015, in accordance with Article 12 of the now disputed Settlement.\n\n43.\n\nThe Deed of Settlement does not permit the Government to deny Savan Vegas management and control prior to the April 13/14 hearing.\n\n44.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, urgency does not require a Provisional Measures Order in relation to the management and control of the Gaming Assets prior to the hearing on the merits at Singapore on 13 and 14 April 2015.\n\n**IX. Necessity of the Proposed Provisional Measures**\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n45.\n\nThe concept of \"necessity\" is related to the preservation of the *status quo* as may be required to ensure that any Order made on the merits by the Tribunal in respect of the Material Breach Application is not vitiated by measures taken by the Respondent Government during the pendency of the Tribunal's deliberations.\n\n46.\n\nThe Tribunal is not satisfied that there is any necessity to issue an order for Provisional Measures before hearing the evidence on 13 and 14 April 2015.\n\n47.\n\nAt the conclusion of the 13/14 April hearing, the Tribunal will be in a position to determine whether it is necessary and appropriate to issue a Provisional Measures Order restraining the Government pending the issuance of the Tribunal's decision on the merits from taking action under Article 12 of the Deed of Settlement to install RMC as manager.\n\n**X. Proportionality**\n----------------------\n\n48.\n\nAn order which is grounded neither in urgency nor necessity is not a \"proportionate\" response to a threatened Government action which will take place, if at all, after the April 13/14 hearing.\n\n**XI. Disposition**\n-------------------\n\n49.\n\nThe Tribunal therefore defers until the conclusion of the hearing on the Material Breach Application on 13/14 April 2015 its decision on the Claimant's application to enjoin the Government from causing RMC to \"step in and manage and operate\" the Gaming Assets, as well as advancing their sale, pending issuance of the Tribunal's decision on the merits. In all other respects, the Application for Provisional Measures is dismissed."}, {"Title": "Decision on Provisional Measures", "Type": "Interim & Provisional Measures", "Date": "2015-04-14T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Decision on Provisional Measures\n--------------------------------\n\nThe Tribunal is seized of an request for Provisional Measures in support of the Claimant's Material Breach Application.

OVERVIEW**\n---------------\n\n1.\n\nThe Claimant, Lao Holdings N.C., owns gambling assets in Laos including the Savan Vegas Hotel and Casino Complex in Savannakhet Province. It is strategically located near the Friendship Bridge which spans the Mekong River, between Laos and Thailand. As a result of what it considered to be investment treaty violations, the Claimant, a company incorporated under the laws of Aruba in the Netherlands Antilles, initiated proceedings on 14 August 2012 against the Respondent, the Government of The Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (the \"Government\"), before the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID). The claim was made pursuant to the *Agreement on Encouragement and Reciprocal Protection of Investments* between Laos and the Kingdom of the Netherlands1, and the *Arbitration Rules (Additional Facility)* of ICSID.2\n\nSigned on 16 May 2003, in force since 1 May 2005.\n\nAs amended on 10 April 2006.\n\n2.\n\nThe Claimant\u2019s original ICSID claims were based on a multiplicity of the Respondent Government\u2019s actions, including an 80 % tax on casino revenues and what the Claimant contended were unfair and oppressive audits of its Savan Vegas Hotel and Casino. The Claimant eventually valued its investment loss at between USD 690 million and USD 1 billion.\n\n3.\n\nThe ICSID claims were resolved by a Deed of Settlement concluded between the parties during the merits hearing in Singapore on 15 June 2014 (to be read together with a Side Letter dated 18 June 2014) (herein referred to collectively as \"the Settlement\").\n\n4.\n\nThe Claimant now alleges a \"material breach\" of the Settlement by the Government which, it says, justifies the Tribunal in reviving the pre-settlement ICSID claims.\n\n5.\n\nThe Claimant\u2019s core allegation is that subsequent to the Settlement, the Government infringed the Claimant\u2019s gambling monopoly rights by approving and granting permission for the establishment of a rival casino or casinos within its area of exclusivity. The Government undertook in Article 13 thereof to facilitate the sale of the Claimant\u2019s gambling assets in Laos \"on a basis that will maximize Sale proceeds to the Claimants and Laos\". Instead, according to the Claimant, the Government\u2019s approval of a rival casino or casinos has so substantially destroyed the potential value of the Savan Vegas Hotel and Casino in the eyes of potential investors as to frustrate (and terminate) the Settlement.\n\n6.\n\nThe Claimant offers no direct evidence of such approval. Instead it has produced a variety of items of circumstantial evidence, including media reports, blogs, the continuing operation of a rival slot club or clubs in the Claimant\u2019s territory and activities of private individuals and entities (not the Government) from all of which, the Claimant argues, Government approval can be inferred.\n\n7.\n\nThe important question arises as to whether any of the conduct of various private entities (including a corporation in which the Government holds a minority 30% interest) which promoted creation of a potential rival casino can be attributed to the Government.\n\n8.\n\nIf the Tribunal is persuaded on the attribution issue, the further question arises as to whether the Government \"cured\" the alleged default within 45 days \"after receipt of notice of such breach\" as permitted by Article 32 of the Settlement, by making it clear that no rival casino would be permitted in the Claimant\u2019s territory during the balance of the 50 year life of the Claimant\u2019s concession.\n\n9.\n\nThe Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction to revive the ICSID claims is conferred (and limited) by Article 32 of the Deed of Settlement which reads in part (as clarified by the Side Letter), as follows:3\n\nThe Claimants shall only be permitted to revive the arbitration in the event that Laos is in material breach of Sections 5-8, 15, 21-23, 25, 27 or 28 above and only after reasonable written notice is given to Laos by the Claimants of such breach **and such breach is not remedied within 45 days after receipt of notice of such breach,** (emphasis added)\n\nThe full text of Article 32 as clarified by the Side Letter reads as follows:  \n**Article 32**  \n The Claimants shall only be permitted to revive the arbitration in the event that Laos is in material breach of Sections 5-8, 15, 21-23, 25, 27 or 28 above and only after reasonable written notice is given to Laos by the Claimants of such breach and such breach is not remedied within 45 days after receipt of notice of suchbreach. The Sale Deadline and any other relevant time periods herein shall be extended by the length of time required to cure such breach. In the event that there is a dispute as to whether or not Laos is in material breach of Sections 5-8, 15, 21-23, 25, 27 or 28 above, the Tribunals shall determine whether or not there has been such a material breach and shall only revive the arbitration if they conclude that there has been such a material breach.\n\n10.\n\nFor reasons that follow, the Tribunal is of the view that even accepting *arguendo* the interpretation of the Deed of Settlement most favourable to the Claimant, the evidence fails to establish on a balance of probabilities that the Government itself, directly or indirectly, \"approved and granted\" permission for a rival casino contrary to the Claimant\u2019s contractual entitlement.\n\n11.\n\nThe Tribunal notes the Claimant\u2019s contention that against a sovereign state a Claimant \"is often unable to furnish direct proof of facts giving rise to responsibility\" because, as the Claimant argues, such evidence is often \"exclusively within the control of the Government\".4 Nevertheless where, as here, the Claimant\u2019s case is based on \"inferences of fact and circumstantial evidence\" (see Claimant\u2019s Submission, 27 March 2014, at para. 27) a Tribunal must be careful not to shift the onus of proof from the Claimant to the Respondent Government or to bend over backwards to read in inferences against \"the sovereign state\" that are simply not justified in the context of the whole case.\n\nRelying on the *Corfu Channel* Case, Judgment of 9 April 1949, at 18 and *Alpha Projektholding GmbH v. Ukraine,* (ICSID Case No. ARB/07/16), Award of 8 November 2010) at 373.\n\n12.\n\nFurther, even if it were accepted, *arguendo,* that some of the evidence is suggestive of some sort of \"tacit\" signal of approval to rival entrepreneurs, all of which is denied by the Government, it is the Tribunal\u2019s conclusion that any such alleged conduct was \"cured\" by the Government within 45 days. If there was any doubt before 26 June 2014 about the Government\u2019s policy against new casinos, there was none afterwards. The Government\u2019s position was not shouted from the roof tops to the extent the Claimant now insists upon but, in the Tribunal\u2019s view, there was no contractual obligation undertaken by the Government to have the Prime Minister make a high level denunciation of every potentially damaging newspaper report or other misinformation sourced in the private sector.\n\n13.\n\nThe Tribunal rejects the Claimant\u2019s argument that the violations of the Settlement by the Government, to the extent they have been established (if at all), created such serious prejudice to the Claimant as to render the violations incurable within the permitted 45 days. The curative measures that were taken extinguished whatever claim for revival might otherwise have arisen on the evidence before the Tribunal.\n\n14.\n\nAccordingly, the Claimant\u2019s application for a revival of the arbitration pursuant to Article 32 of the Deed of Settlement must be dismissed. The disposition of costs will be dealt with as hereinafter provided, and together with this decision on the merits, will be incorporated in the Award to be issued under Article 52 of the *Arbitration (Additional Facility) Rules* of ICSID.\n\n**II. BRIEF HISTORY OF THE INVESTMENT**\n---------------------------------------\n\n15.\n\nThe Claimant has invested substantial monies since 2007 in three major projects in Laos, the Savan Vegas Hotel and Casino (\"Savan Vegas\"), the Paksong Vegas Hotel and Casino (\"Paksong Vegas\") and other enterprises (with local partners) that operated slot machine clubs. The Claimant\u2019s gambling assets are held through Sanum Investments Inc., a company incorporated in Macao.5\n\nThe Government makes the curious submission that there is no \"operating company\" or \"subsidiary\" which is a party to the PDA. (Government Submission 3 April 2015 at para 119.) However, the Claimant\u2019s subsidiary Sanum is a party to the PDA. The Government\u2019s submission seems to have overlooked the fact that Lao Holdings NC, not Sanum, is the only Claimant in the ICSID proceeding.\n\n16.\n\nThe ICSID dispute related to the Respondent Government\u2019s fiscal, regulatory and administrative measures allegedly targeting the Claimant\u2019s investment at the instigation of the Claimant\u2019s erstwhile but now estranged Laotian partners. These measures6 according to the Claimant deprived it of part or all of the value of its investment in the Laos gaming and tourism industry. The Government, for its part, accused the Claimant of various acts of criminality.7\n\nThe \"oppressive\" measures, the Claimant alleges, were instigated by powerful Laotian business and political leaders in part for the benefit of Sanum\u2019s estranged Laotian business partners, a Laotian company called ST and its principals who are Laotian nationals. Eventually, the Government issued fresh tax claims against Savan Vegas which the Claimant says were invalid but, being unpaid, led to the freezing of the Savan Vegas bank accounts in Laos. The series of Government measures taken together, the Claimant contended in the ICSID arbitration, amounted to *de facto* expropriation.\n\nThe Government contended that the Claimant and its related companies had for years been operating their gambling operations using impenetrable accounting procedures, and in some respects acting illegally, including through the corruption of Laotian Government officials. In 2013, the Government declared its intention to initiate criminal investigations of the Claimant and its principals who are U.S. citizens. Counsel for the Government made the submission at the 6 January 2014 hearing that:  \n [The Claimants] decided, for their own reasons, that they would put all their money into Thailand; well, they had been putting their money in Thailand for the last five years. And it is illegal, it is against the law in Laos for any Lao corporation to have a bank account outside the country, and they had seven bank accounts outside the country for the last five years. We can tell from some of the documents we received from Ernst & Young that in one of those bank accounts in 2011, a year before the \"freezing order\", they put $11 million into a Thai bank account. That\u2019s against the law. (Transcript, 6 January 2014, pP. 19-20).\n\n17.\n\nIt is unnecessary for the purposes of this application to explore in any detail the particulars of the ICSID dispute. Suffice it to say that by the spring of 2014, the Claimant and its U.S. principals wanted to halt the threatened Laotian criminal investigations and to \"maximize the Sale proceeds\" of their gambling assets in Laos. Equally, the Government wanted to see them gone.\n\n**III. THE DEED OF SETTLEMENT DATED 15 JUNE 2014 AND THE SIDE LETTER OF 18 JUNE 2014**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n18.\n\nBy Deed of Settlement dated 15 June 2014, which is to be read together with a Side Letter dated 18 June 2014, the Claimant agreed with the Government to end the hearing of the ICSID arbitration (and a parallel UNCITRAL arbitration involving Paksong Vegas that was pending before the Permanent Court of Arbitration).\n\n19.\n\nThe Settlement is governed by New York law. It contemplated that the money necessary to achieve a clean break between the Claimant and Laos would come from a third party purchaser of the Claimant\u2019s gambling assets. The Government itself did not agree to pay any compensation. Its position was described by its counsel as follows:\n\nWe started negotiating on Thursday. We negotiated all day Friday. I imposed the terms, here are the terms: \"We pay them nothing; they dismiss their claims, they sell their casino for what they can get, and they leave Lao. Those are the terms.\" (Transcript, 17 June 2014, p. 25)\n\nI told you, I imposed the terms. I\u2019ve been trying my best to make it possible for them to work the deal. So, any time they asked me for anything that would make it easier for them to sell, make it easier for them to do this or that, I would put it in the Agreement. I bent over backwards. (Transcript, 17 June 2014, p. 33)\n\n20.\n\nCounsel for the Claimant explained the origins of the Settlement somewhat differently:\n\nThe settlements arose\u2014the possibility of the Settlement arose a couple of weeks ago when Claimants received an offer to purchase their\u2014the Savan Vegas properties, and it became clear that that might be a means to resolve the disputes. But, of course, Claimants can only sell the Savan Vegas and the other properties they own with the cooperation of the Laos Government and with certain steps taken by the Laos Government that make the properties salable. (Transcript, 19 June 2014, pp. 49-50) (emphasis added)\n\nThe \"certain steps taken by the Laos Government\" included, in the Claimant\u2019s view, negotiation of a new Flat Tax Agreement and preservation of the casino monopoly acquired by Sanum under the *Project Development Agreement on Savan Vegas Entertainment Hotel and Casino in Savannakhet Province* dated 10 August 20078 between the Government and Sanum Investments and its private Laotian partners (hereinafter referred to as the *\"2007 Sanum Agreement\").*\n\nExhibit C-004 at p. 10\n\n21.\n\nUnder the Settlement, the Claimant was entitled to attempt to complete a sale within 10 months from 15 June 2014, with an extension of time if necessary to accommodate a closing date. During that time, the Claimant and its affiliates would continue to run the businesses subject to the \"monitoring and oversight\" of the Government\u2019s agent, RMC Gaming Management LLC (\"RMC\"). At the end of 10 months, if no sale had materialized, the Claimants and Laos would have the right \"to appoint RMC or any other qualified operator\" to step in and manage the gambling assets \"in place of the Claimants until the sale is complete\" (Article 12 of the Settlement).\n\n22.\n\nCentral to the Claimant\u2019s argument is the interpretation of Article 6 of the Deed of Settlement (as clarified by the Side Letter):\n\n**Article 6**\n\nLaos shall treat the Project Development Agreement (\"PDA\") dated 10 August 2007 in respect of the Savan Vegas Casino and each of the licenses and land concessions issued in respect of the Savan Vegas Casino, the Lao Bao Slot Club and the Savannakhet Ferry Terminal Slot Club (collectively the \"Gaming Assets\"), as being restated as of the Effective Date, with a term in each of fifty (50) years from the Effective Date. ST owns 40% of the Lao Bao and Ferry Terminal Slot Clubs, [emphasis added]\n\nMuch of the present dispute revolves around the disagreement of the parties about the meaning and effect of the underlined words of Article 6.9\n\nIn its 3 April 2015 Submission, the Government states that in its ruling of 19 December 2014,  \n \"the Tribunal never determines that the phrase \"to treat as being restated\" is ambiguous, and therefore it is error to interpret unambiguous words by reference to some supposed \"purpose\" not expressed in Article 13\". In fact, the 19 December 2014 ruling stated unequivocally in para. 2 that \"the Tribunal has also concluded, for the reasons set out below, that given the ambiguous wording of Article 6 of the *Deed of Settlement* on which the Claimant relies...\" (emphasis added)\n\n23.\n\nThe Claimant says the effect of Article 6 is to make Sanum\u2019s casino monopoly enforceable not only by Sanum but also by its parent, the Claimant. The Government acknowledges the existence of the casino monopoly but says that only Sanum (not the Claimant) is entitled to enforce it. Moreover, the Government insists that any dispute under the *2007 Sanum Agreement* lies within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Singapore International Arbitration Centre (SIAC).\n\n24.\n\nThe parties agree that the Settlement governs the negotiation of any new *Flat Tax Agreement* (FTA), and that disputes in relation thereto are potentially within the jurisdiction of this Tribunal under Article 32 of the Settlement. The Claimant argues that the breach of the monopoly destroyed the Settlement, and with it a proper basis for the Claimant to negotiate a new FTA and thereby contributed to its losses. The Government responds that the Settlement is still in force and the continuing failure to reach a new FTA has been, and continues to be, exclusively attributable to the intransigence of the Claimant, which has refused to name its nominee to the joint \"Flat Tax Committee\" contemplated under Article 9 of the Settlement.\n\n25.\n\nThe Claimant also expected to profit from a land concession and development of an airport and other amenities on 90 hectares of land at Thakhet under a memorandum of understanding dated 20 October 2010 as contemplated under Article 22 of the Settlement. When the Claimant declined to pay the required USD 500,000 fee in a timely way, the Government declared an end to the Claimant\u2019s potential participation in Thakhet.\n\n**(i) The Alleged Breaches of the Settlement by the Respondent Government**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n26.\n\nA few days after the celebration in Singapore of the signing of the Deed of Settlement and the Side Letter, the Claimant filed on 4 July 2014 an *\"Application for Finding of Material Breach of Deed of Settlement and for Reinstatement of Arbitration \"* (\"the Material Breach Application\"). The ground for relief was an allegation that the Respondent Government had \"approved and granted\" gambling concession(s) to third parties in the nearby \"Savan City\" project in breach of the Savan Vegas casino monopoly rights, thereby ending (the Claimant said) any possibility of a sale that \"will maximize Sale proceeds to the claimant and Laos\" as contemplated in Article 13 of the Settlement.10 It also alleged, as stated, that the Government, not the Claimant, is responsible for the failure to achieve a new FTA and the frustration of the Thakhet project.\n\nThe Government argues that Article 13 only applies to a sale by the Gaming Operator, RMC, if and when RMC takes control of the Gaming Assets in the event Sanum fails to \"complete a sale on time\" (Government Submission, 3 April 2015, at para. 109.). This is not correct. \"Sale\" is defined in Article 10 as \"a Sale of the gaming assets\". The context of Article 10 is a sale by the Claimant not the \"Gaming Operator\" RMC. Accordingly the \"Sale\" referenced in Article 13 could be by either the Claimant or RMC, depending on the circumstances, and in either case the purpose set out in Article 13 applies.\n\n**(ii) The Sanum \"Monopoly Rights\"**\n------------------------------------\n\n27.\n\nThe parties appear to agree that any Government permission to open a rival casino would have a \"material\" impact on the income and future prospects of the Savan Vegas Hotel and Casino. In its 3 April 2015 Submission, the Government concedes that \"the damages caused by a new casino could be large [and] when multiplied by 50 [i.e. the number of years of the monopoly] could be astronomical\" [para. 22], Lower future earnings as a result of increased competition would mean a lower current valuation and a correspondingly reduced price for the Claimant\u2019s gambling assets in the market place.\n\n28.\n\nThe \"monopoly rights\" are contained in article 9(24) of the *2007 Sanum Agreement,* which provides as follows:\n\nThe **Company** has been granted monopoly rights for its Casino business operations only with the condition that the **Government** shall not **approve and grant** any other parties or entities who put up their applications for the operation of certain Casino business in the three (3) neighboring provinces close to the Project development zone of the Company namely: Savannakhet, Khammaouane and Bolikhamsay, throughout the concession period of 50 years.\n\nHowever, should there have any applications submitted by any parties or entities, all those shall be made through **the consent and approval of both the Government and the authorized investors** who have management rights (emphasis added)\n\nThe Government\u2019s position is that it has given no \"approval and grant\" of a casino licence in the Claimant\u2019s exclusive territory. The Claimant responds that Article 9(24) does not use the word \"licence\" and, in its view, may be breached without the actual grant of a licence. The Claimant says:\n\n\"the provision of the PDA that underlies Claimant\u2019s Application does not refer to the grant of a gaming license, which in any event would be surprising at this early stage of development of the project, rather, it is the \"approval\" of \"casino business,\" whether formal or informal that constitutes a breach of Savan Vegas\u2019s monopoly rights and a material breach of the Settlement. (Claimant\u2019s Submission, 27 March 2014, para. 7).\n\nAccording to the Claimant, \"informal\" approval can be very informal, such as the Government\u2019s failure to shut down the non-conforming slot club(s) of Madam Kozy (discussed below) or the presence of the Vice President of the National Assembly at a signing ceremony on 26 June 201411 where private developers announced a $10 billion project for Savan City.\n\nAs Claimant\u2019s counsel put it:  \n How does the government show approval? Well, it shows approval by sending a senior official like the Vice President of the National Assembly to a signing ceremony which is highly-publicized within Laos and outside of the country; and at which the Vice President of the Lao National Assembly says that the goals of Savan City and the SEZ have been realized.  \n You\u2019ll recall the testimony, you will recall those are in the words in the press release and you will recall Mr. Thongsay confirmed that is what he said. That is a statement of Lao government approval. It is a public statement of Lao government approval, and it fits in with all the rest of the evidence about what happened.  \n (Submissions, 14 April 2015, at p. 161)\n\n29.\n\nIn the alternative, the Claimant argues that \"even if the Tribunal declines to find that Laos has approved a new casino at Savan City, the refusal of the Prime Minister or political figure of equivalent authority to issue a single public statement denying approval of a casino over the past nine months itself constitutes a separate and independent material breach of Section 6 of the Settlement\".12\n\nClaimant\u2019s Submission, 27 March 2014, para. 11; Evidence of John Baldwin, 14 April 2015, p.20 1112-17\n\n30.\n\nIn the further alternative, the Claimant accuses the Respondent Government of attempting to mislead the Tribunal by submitting a \"doctored\" site map for Savan City and \"the Tribunal should need no more than that to determine that Laos is liable.\"13\n\nClaimant\u2019s Submission, 27 March 2014, para. 15\n\n**(iii) The Flat Tax Arrangement**\n----------------------------------\n\n31.\n\nThe Claimant\u2019s previous 5-year FTA with the Government expired on 31 December, 2014.\n\n32.\n\nThe Settlement contemplated the negotiation of a new Flat Tax agreement within 45 days of 15 June 2014. The Claimant, having filed the present Application on 4 July 2014, declined to join in the agreed process to arrive at a new Flat Tax Agreement. It argued that because of the Government\u2019s alleged breach of the Savan Vegas monopoly rights, the contractual arrangements made in the Settlement were, as a matter of law, nullified. The Government\u2019s breach of the monopoly rights therefore had the knock-on effect of denying the Claimant the benefit of a new FTA as well as the opportunity offered by the potential development of the Thakhet site.\n\n33.\n\nIn the result, Savan Vegas has paid no income tax on casino revenues or earnings since 1 January 2015. It also withheld employment tax from January 1, 2015, until the week prior to the Tribunal\u2019s Singapore hearing on 13-14 April 2015, at which point Savan Vegas paid employment tax said to be owing of approximately USD335,000.14\n\nBaldwin testimony 14 April 2015, p. 5.11 9-15\n\n**IV. THE EVIDENCE DOES NOT ESTABLISH THE ALLEGED BREACH OF THE SAVAN VEGAS MONOPOLY RIGHTS**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n34.\n\nThe Claimant contends that the Government has *approved and granted* permission to build and operate a rival casino in the \"Savan City\" project adjacent to the Savan Vegas Hotel and Casino in Savannakhet Province.\n\n35.\n\nIn the Tribunal\u2019s view, the evidence does not justify any such conclusion.\n\n**(i) The \"Savan City Project\"**\n--------------------------------\n\n36.\n\nThe Government, in 2003, established a Special Economic Zone (SEZ) adjacent to what became the Savan Vegas Hotel and Casino property. The SEZ is administered by the Savan SENO Special Economic Authority, (\"the SEZ Authority\"), a Government entity.\n\n37.\n\nLittle if any development of this SEZ has occurred since 2003.\n\n38.\n\nIn 2007, the SEZ Authority entered into an agreement for the development of a portion of the SEZ called Site A with a private developer, the Thai Airports Ground Services Co. Ltd. [\"TAGS\"], under which a new operating company (eventually called \"Savan City\") would be formed.15 For ease of reference, the 2007 Agreement will be herein referred to as \"the *2007 Savan City PDA\".*\n\nThe Agreement is dated 13 June 2007 and made between the Savan SENO Special Economic Zone Authority [\"SEZA\"] and TAGS\n\n39.\n\nSavan City, as it is now called, is owned 70% by private interests, who were responsible for raising the funds and developing the Project, and owned 30%, directly or indirectly, by the Government.\n\n40.\n\nThe *2007 Savan City PDA* attached a Master Plan for development. Over the ensuing years, TAGS failed to produce a viable development for Site A.\n\n41.\n\nBetween 2008 and 2012, the Claimant, through Sanum attempted to promote a development on site A.16 In 2013 Sanum submitted a proposal of about 200 pages for development of Site A to the Deputy Prime Minister. This was not accepted.\n\nEvidence of the John Baldwin, April 14 2015, p. 24.1113-18, Exhibit c-272, p. 25,111-5\n\n42.\n\nIn 2014, Savan City put together a development proposal for Site A in conjunction with a Malaysian private developer, Asean Union Inc.\n\n43.\n\nAt a press conference in Vientiane, the capital of Laos, on 26 June 2014, Savan City and Asean Union announced the new $10 billion project. The project was based on three development agreements for a portion of Site A that included an agreement for a financial centre17 that would offer \"off-shore\" banking services (herein referred to as the **\"Asean Bank Agreement\",** a project that would require changes in Laotian banking law), an agreement for a substantial resort18 (herein referred to as the **\"Entertainment Complex\"** agreement), and an Agreement to establish **\"Savan Gateway\",** a development that included a shopping centre, Tourist Information Centre, duty free shopping, a petrol station and other facilities.19\n\nJoint Venture Agreement dated 2 May 2014 in respect of establishing the ASEAN Union Bank between ASEAN Union Inc. and Savan City Co., Ltd. (Exhibit C-887)\n\nJoint Venture Agreement dated 2 May 2014 between ASEAN Union and Savan City in respect of establishing the Asean Union \"Entertainment Resort\" (Exhibit C-792)\n\nJoint Venture Agreement dated 28 May 2014 between ASEAN Union and Savan City in Respect of Establishing the Savan Gateway (Exhibit C-793)\n\n44.\n\nThe Master Plan attached to the *Asean Bank Agreement20* and the *Entertainment Complex Agreement21* designated part of the site as the location of a casino. The casino designation in the Master Plan is heavily relied upon by the Claimant to prove its case.\n\nExhibit C-887, 2 May 2014\n\nExhibit C-792, 2 May 2014\n\n45.\n\nAt the very public \"signing ceremony\" in Vientiane, the promoters announced a new \"US $10 billion\" project, to be called Asean Paradize Savan City. As stated, the Vice President of the National Assembly attended the signing ceremony and welcomed the potential $10 billion investment. The private promoters hoped to develop a new casino close to the Savan Vegas Hotel and Casino, but there is no evidence the Vice President was aware of the casino objective. The promoters\u2019 press release on that day did not make explicit reference to a casino:\n\n\"The Integrated Entertainment resort, will become a major tourism attraction for Laos with theme parks, recreation, hospitality and food, and our objective is to rival some of Asia\u2019s top entertainment regions, as we combine Laotian hospitality with modem entertainment concepts and attractions\".22\n\nExhibit C-796, 26 June 2014\n\n46.\n\nThe Claimant learned about this announcement in a report published in *The Nation,* a Thai newspaper, on 27 June 2014, which *did* refer to a casino, as follows:\n\nMalaysian investor ASEAN Union Group has launched its second venture overseas - the Asean Paradize Savan City - in Laos with a total investment of USD$10 billion (B13T20 billion) comprising of offshore financial center, entertainment, casino and communities for foreigners, (emphasis added)\n\n47.\n\nThe story was taken up by other media including the *Asian Gambling Brief* which reported on June 27, 2014 that:\n\nWork is scheduled to start in July this year on a $10 billion project in Laos including an offshore financial centre, a casino and entertainment complex and community for foreigners, according to *The Nation* Newspaper, (emphasis added)\n\n48.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, it was the published references to the construction of a rival casino adjacent to the Savan Vegas Hotel and Casino complex that led the Claimant to trade mutually accusatory correspondence with the Government and, eventually, to file its Material Breach Application on 4 July 2014.\n\n49.\n\nThe Claimant has identified and filed numerous blogs and websites referring to a casino project on Site A but none of these announcements are sourced with the Government. However, the Claimant says that if the casino publicity was untrue, the Prime Minister himself should have publically said so. Instead, the Prime Minister stayed silent, and the only published denial at the ministerial level was contained in a report in *BCI ASIA* on 26 August 2014.23 This was too little and too late, the Claimant says.\n\nSee *BCI ASIA 26* August 2014: \"Govt *says casino not part of Savan City projects\"*  \n The government has confirmed that there has been no agreement reached for a casino to operate under the Savan City project, in the Savan-Seno Special Economic Zone (SSEZ) in Savannakhet province.  \n The Secretariat Office of the Lao National Committee for Special Economic Zones (S-NCSEZ) issued an official letter recently, denying a June 27 report by Thai media (The Nation) that a casino will be incorporated in the development.  \n \\* \\* \\* \\*  \n Vice Governor of Savan-Seno Special Economic Zone Authority Mr. Thongsay Sayavongkharmdy told *Vientiene Times* yesterday that he wondered howt he media *(the Nation)* got information about this project, saying that their information about the casino is inaccurate.\n\n50.\n\nIn addition, the Claimant relies on the evidence of Ms. Lisa McWilliams, a businesswoman who lives in Saipan who was sent by the Claimant to visit the premises of Asean Paradize (the marketing arm of Asean Union) on August 26, 2014, in Kuala Lumpur. She met with Aubry O\u2019Hara, a senior employee. Ms. McWilliams indicated to him that she had clients who might be interested in making a direct investment in Site A. Mr. O\u2019Hara, without prompting, suggested an investment in a casino. Ms. McWilliams held a similar meeting with Mr. Chew of Asean Union. Her evidence was that:\n\n\"[Mr. O\u2019Hara of Asean Paradize] explained that Savan City would have an Asean Paradize Bank, shopping malls, condos, off-shore banking, an entertainment centre, hotels and a casino \", (para. 14) (emphasis added)\n\n\"[Mr. Chew of Asean Union] said a casino ultimately would be licensed by the Lao Government... and he was very confident that it would be built.\" (para. 23) (emphasis added)\n\nThere is no reason to doubt the witness statement of Ms. McWilliams. However, it simply confirms that ASEAN Union and its affiliates were doing whatever they could to promote development of the site. If the prize of a casino attracted investment so much the better. Ms. McWilliams\u2019 evidence does not establish any grant and approval of permission for a rival casino that can be attributed to the Government.\n\n51.\n\nSimilarly, the Claimant relies on the evidence of Mr. Eugene McCain, a developer based in Phukhet, Thailand, who was sent by the Claimant to visit the premises of Asian Engineering Consultants (\"AEC\") in Bangkok on February 16, 2015. He was told about an AEC project in Savannakhet and was shown a proposed Master Plan of Savan City that included a casino. His evidence was that:\n\n\"[The AEC management team] explained that there would actually be two casino gaming facilities at Savan City.\" (para. 11)\n\nAgain, there is no reason to doubt the accuracy of Mr. McCain\u2019s recollection of his conversation with senior officials at AEC.24 However, promotional efforts by AEC, an entrepreneurial engineering and planning firm in Bangkok, does not establish any approval and grant of permission by the Government of Laos.\n\nSee the Agreement between Mr. Hassan\u2019s company, Insure Asia and AEC of 25 June 2014 (Exhibit C-795).\n\n52.\n\nMr. John Baldwin, the principal of the Claimant, acknowledged in cross-examination that he had no personal knowledge of any such Government approval.25\n\nEvidence of John Baldwin, Transcript 14A, p. 34,113-6\n\n53.\n\nMoreover, as stated earlier, Article 9(24) of the *2007 Savan Vegas PDA* contemplates that applications *could* be submitted \"by any parties or entities\" for a new casino licence in the Claimant\u2019s monopoly area, but approval thereof would require the \"consent and approval\" of both the Government and the \"authorized investors who have management rights\" [i.e. Sanum itself, which is a subsidiary of the Claimant], To the extent that Asean Union was attempting to round up funding for a casino project on Site A prior to making such a submission to the Government, there was no breach of the *2007 Savan Vegas PDA,* to which in any event, of course, Asean Union was not a party. In theory, at least, Sanum might have given its consent, as indeed in 2013 Sanum discussed a joint arrangement with Madam Kozy\u2019s slot machine clubs within Sanum\u2019s exclusive territory, as described below.\n\n**(ii) The Doctored Evidence**\n------------------------------\n\n54.\n\nThe Claimant alleges that the Government attempted to mislead the Tribunal with a \"doctored\" version of the Site A plan attached to the *2014 Asean Bank Agreement* and the *2014 Entertainment Complex Agreement.* The new Plan, produced shortly before the Singapore hearing, substituted the designation \"CJHQ\" for the word \"casino\" on a cross-hatched portion of the Site Plan.26 The \"doctored evidence\" was so serious a matter, the Claimant says, as to justify rescinding the Settlement.\n\nTranscript, 13 April at p. 32\n\n55.\n\nIn the Tribunal\u2019s view, the evidence does not warrant or justify this allegation. The Site plans attached to two of the three Asean Union Agreements ***do*** indicate a site for a casino. Mr. Chanchai in paragraph 11 of his 18 December 2014 statement acknowledged this fact.27 The Claimant\u2019s position was shown to be correct.\n\nChanchai witness statement dated 18 December 2014, para. 11:  \n When we were drafting the agreement at the last minute, I placed a map that showed a hotel with a casino labelled on the map in the agreement because it was an old one in my files.\n\n56.\n\nWhen Mr. Chanchai was subsequently asked by counsel for the Respondent Government for a clearer copy of the *original* site plan, Mr. Chanchai says he decided that the designation of a casino should be removed from the map because it was misleading, and he did so. He testified (as translated) in cross-examination as follows:\n\nI changed this map because when there are problems, Mr. Thongsay asked me to submit the whole document for him to double-check whether I have any agreement with Asean Union. When Mr. Thongsay consider and then he complained that the casino, why it is under the plan, casino is the activity that the Government is not allow, so please do not deviate or to mislead people there is casino, so I have to eradicate it so that it is correct. We have this new plan.28\n\nTranscript, 13 April, p. 188.11. 2-11.\n\n57.\n\nThe Claimant objects that the \"new plan\" was not identified as a \"new plan\" when transmitted to its counsel but erroneously passed off as a legible copy of the original plan. Be that as it may, Mr. Chanchai\u2019s admission with respect to the word \"casino\" was already in the record, and whatever miscommunication occurred when the map was provided to the Claimant in regrettable but of no great probative value.\n\n58.\n\nThe Claimant also contends, based on Mr. John Baldwin\u2019s evidence, that Savan City would not have announced the $10 billion project unless the casino had been approved.\n\n59.\n\nWhatever may be Mr. Baldwin\u2019s experience, it is clear that Savan City and Asean Union did not comply with such a prudent \"practice\". They were prepared to make announcements before the grant of necessary licenses and approvals. This is confirmed by the fact that on 26 June 2014, the Asean Union itself announced not only a casino but the establishment of a significant \"offshore\" banking centre on Site A. The banking centre could not happen without a change in the laws of Laos governing banking. No such change had been made. Mr. Hassan of Asean Union testified:\n\n**Q.** You have said in your witness statements that you wish to develop a financial centre?\n\nA. Yes.\n\n**Q.** Inside there? [i.e. Site A]\n\nA. That is exactly what I want to do. That is my expertise.\n\n**Q.** You\u2019ve said that you\u2019ve approached the Government of Laos to have a financial regulatory laws passed by the national assembly?\n\nA. Yes, that is right. I submitted six inches of \u2014 few thousand pages of laws which I expected them to go through and pass for an offshore financial centre to be created.\n\n**Q.** If the national legislature, national assembly of Laos, does not pass those laws, does not change the banking regulatory environment, will you invest any money in Site A ?\n\nA. No point in investing there then.\n\n**Q.** The answer is no?\n\nA. No.\n\n(Transcript 13 April, p. 200.1 14 to p. 201.1. 8) (emphasis added)\n\nIn other words, no changes had been made to the banking laws, yet the promoters announced the development of an \"offshore\" banking facility with fanfare on 26 June 2014 as part of a $10 billion investment for which approval had not been secured.\n\n60.\n\nThe Tribunal is of the view that no inference of Government prior \"grant and approval\" of permission for a casino can be drawn from the promoters\u2019 publicity at the 26 June \"signing ceremony\".\n\n**(iii) The \"Integrated Entertainment Complex\"**\n------------------------------------------------\n\n61.\n\nThe Claimant argues that the expression \"integrated entertainment complex\", which appear in various of the promoters\u2019 documents, is well understood \"in industry parlance\" as a euphemism for \"a complex built around a casino\".29 The *2014 \"Entertainment Resort\" Agreement* uses the expression \"Integrated Entertainment Complex\" in its preamble, as does more recent promotional material for \"Savan Eco-City\". Therefore, the Claimant says, a casino is still in the plan for Site A, albeit camouflaged by an euphemism.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Submission,, 7 March 2015, at para. 2\n\n62.\n\nIn the Tribunal\u2019s view, the Claimant puts more weight on this argument than is plausible in light of all the other evidence.\n\n63.\n\nWhatever may be the understanding of the phrase \"integrated entertainment complex\" in some circles, this meaning was not acknowledged by the aspiring promoters of Savan City, neither of whom had any particular experience in the gambling industry. The Government witness Mr. Thongsay denied any such connotation in \"our country\". He testified as follows:\n\n**Q.** Did you ever try to understand what the words \"integrated entertainment resort\" or \"integrated entertainment complex\" meant in the world of tourism and gaming?\n\nA. The meaning of \"resort\" or \"comprehensive\" - or comprehensive, or \"integrated entertainment\", I do not understand how they interpret it in other regions, but for our country, it mean that it is related to promotion, tourism promotion, there are play areas for children, there are singing contests, TV programs so that people will have enjoyable activities, because our culture is related to the culture promoting arts, but not about casino.\n\n(emphasis added)\n\n(Transcript, 13 April, p. 156)\n\nIn any event, unless the Claimant could tie its understanding of the euphemism to the Government, and thereby attempt to link the Government to an *implicit* \"grant and approval\" of permission for a casino (which the Claimant is unable to do), this terminological argument is of insignificant probative value.\n\n**(iv) Conclusion with Respect to the Activities of the Promoters of Savan City**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n64.\n\nThe Tribunal is satisfied that the private developers involved in Savan City promoted the idea of a casino on Site A. It seems probable that at the time of the \"signing ceremony\" on 26 June 2014, both Mr. Chanchai and Mr. Hassan optimistically thought the Government might be persuaded to licence a new casino (however much they may have denied it when challenged by Madam Bouatha Khatthinda, a senior Government official on 2 July 2014). Madam Bouatha testified as follows:\n\n**Q.** Just so I\u2019m clear, at the meeting, did they tell you that they never planned to build a casino in Site A?\n\nA. Yes. I asked them time and time again not to tell a lie because this is something that you can do it very lightly, and then they answer that, \"we never have any intention to develop the casino in Site A\", because the largest investor - they\u2019re Muslim -so they consider casino violating their belief, so representative Asean Union said so.\n\n**Q.** So the representative of Asean Union said it never had any intention to operate a casino in Site A; is that correct?\n\nA. Yes.30\n\nIt seems the developers may not have been candid with Madam Bouatha. But she, according to her testimony (which the Tribunal accepts), was very candid and categorical with them. There would be no casino on Site A.\n\nEvidence of Madam Bouatha, Transcript, April 13, 2015, at p. 114.1. 19top. 115.1.6\n\n65.\n\nIn any event, the intended target of the Claimant\u2019s submissions is not the private promoters but to implicate the Government. There is no evidence that Mr. Chanchai or other private developer approached the Savan City Board, or the SEZ Authority or any other Government entity even to inquire about the potential availability of permission for a casino. There is no evidence that either Mr. Chanchai or Mr. Hassan was even aware before June 26, 2014 of the Government prohibition or the Claimant\u2019s monopoly entitlement.\n\n**V. ACTIVITIES OF SAVAN CITY AND ITS PROMOTERS CANNOT IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES BE ATTRIBUTED TO THE GOVERNMENT**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n66.\n\nAs stated, the Government, through its SEZ Authority, has a 30% minority interest in Savan City and three members of the seven members Board of Directors.\n\n67.\n\nThe evidence is clear that Savan City is a commercial corporation. It is not the Government. The *2007 Savan City PDA* lays the foundation for a public/private partnership. It bears many of the hallmarks of a shareholders\u2019 agreement and establishes a governance structure that considerably limits the authority of Mr. Chanchai and his \"majority\" shareholders.\n\n68.\n\nThe 70% majority shareholder, the Asean Union Inc., appoints the Vice Chairman of the Board who is also the chief operating officer (Mr. Chanchai) and three additional members, who together constitute a majority of the Board. The Vice Chairman of Savan City is required to run its day to day operations \"in accordance with policies and strategies approved by the Board of Directors\", but only the Board itself is authorized to make \"major decisions\". In particular, the *2007 Savan City PDA* provided that:\n\nIn any Board of Directors meetings, the representatives from \"both parties\" shall attend and decisions on any major issues shall be made based on the consensus principle:\n\nThe Board had the right and duty to consider and approve investment operational plans of the Company.\n\n69.\n\nThe uncontradicted evidence of Mr. Thongsay Sayavongkhandy, a Government-appointed Director of Savan City, was that in fact that the Board had not met \"for a number of years\" because implementation of the Site A project was not \"progressing\".31\n\nTranscript, 13 April, 2015, p. 128,111-6.\n\n**(i) Mere Ownership of a 30% Minority Interest is not \"Control\"**\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n70.\n\nIt is elementary that 30% of the voting shares of a corporation, and a minority of seats on the Board of Directors, does not confer \"control\". Of course, the majority shareholders would be conscious in their decision making of the existence of such a sizeable 30% minority, especially when the minority shareholder is the Government of Laos.\n\n71.\n\nMoreover, the Claimant points out, a fourth Board member, while not a Government employee, is \"intimately connected to the Lao Government and a close relative of a number of senior and powerful Lao officials\".32\n\nWitness Statement of John K. Baldwin, 27 March 2015, para. 6\n\n72.\n\nThe evidence of Madam Bouatha, head of the SEZ Secretariat, was that the Government representatives played a passive role in public/private partnerships in SEZs because of their inexperience:\n\n\"We never take control, both because of our limited shareholdings and because we depend on the expertise and experience of our investing partners to run their business. We want our officials who serve on boards to learn the best practices so when the concession terminates and reverts to the Government, we will have been training our officials.\"33\n\nWitness Statement of Madam Bouatha, 2 April 2015, para. 14\n\n73.\n\nSimilarly the Government official most intimately involved in the affairs of Savan City, Mr. Thongsay testified (in translation) in the course of cross-examination as follows:\n\nThe press release broadcasted by Asean Union, they did not present to the board of director and they do not present it to our SEZ management, so it is beyond our jurisdiction and it not official document for government to be recognised on. (Transcript, April 13, 2015, p. 139.11. 2-7)\n\n\\* \\* \\*\n\nIn fact, I have not contacted with Asean Union, because Asean Union, they are not the partner of the government. (Transcript, April 13, 2015, p. 137.11. 5-12)\n\n74.\n\nMr. Thongsay\u2019s attitude (and the Tribunal has no reason to doubt his description of the process) was simply that if the \"private\" partners brought forward a project, it would be processed in accordance with Government requirements.\n\n75.\n\nIt is to be noted that on 28 June 2013, a year before the events in question here, a Directive was issued to all SEZs confirming that they had no authority to licence new casinos.\n\nThere must not be any authorization for establishment of casino or gambling related activities in the Special Economic Zones except for the agreements that have already been signed with the Government.34\n\nThe Claimant points out that this Directive did not purport to preclude the Prime Minister\u2019s office from granting permission. On the other hand, the bureaucratic road to the Prime Minister\u2019s office lies through Madam Bouatha, who testified that no application for a casino was made by or on behalf of the developers of Site A. There is no evidence of anyone following a different path to the Prime Minister\u2019s office and the Tribunal cannot proceed on the basis of Mr. Baldwin\u2019s unsupported speculation and innuendo that some such \"unofficial\" approach *may* have been made.\n\nLaos Ex. 11, 28 June 2013. Letter from Deputy Standing Head of SEZs to the Senior Management/Board of Directors of SEZs\n\n**(ii) No Board of Directors Meeting of Savan City Was Called to Authorize theSigning of the 2014 Agreements**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n76.\n\nThe evidence is that the Savan City Board of Directors never met to consider any of the three 2014 development agreements. The testimony (in translation) of Mr. Thongsay was as follows:\n\n\"... signing of such contract have not communicated and channelled through the board of director of the company, and it is not approved by the Government. So it makes it just only signing among the private sector\".35\n\nTranscript, 13 April 2015, p. 133,114-8\n\n77.\n\nThe Claimant suggests that while the Government was formally in a minority position in terms of shares and board representation, in reality its influence as Government would prevail at the Board level on any \"major issue\". This may be so, but the evidence is clear and uncontradicted that no Board of Directors meeting took place.\n\n78.\n\nCounsel for the Claimant conceded that it is obvious that Board approval was required to authorize the three Asean Union agreements.36 The Tribunal agrees. The requirement in the *2007 Savan City PDA* was that a meeting of the Board is to be called \"on any major issues\" and that the representatives from both parties \"shall attend\" and decisions \"shall be made on the consensus principle\". Moreover, as stated, the Board had the right and duty to consider and approve investment plans of the Company. On the evidence, then, corporate approval was required and no corporate approval was given.\n\nCounsel for the Claimant submitted:  \n It\u2019s in this context also that you have to consider the question of whether or not there was board approval. You have heard Lao\u2019s witnesses repeat many times that there was not board approval, that there hadn\u2019t been a meeting in years and therefore all these government representatives on the board had never seen the agreements and did not know what the project was all about. That is why they have to deny that there was any board approval.  \n Well, we also saw and you saw yesterday, Mr. Thongsay confirmed and Mr. Khanpheth confirmed that the board of directors has to approve any major agreements. You saw that in the 2007 agreement in Article 6, you also saw in Article 10 that any hiring of a contractor had to be informed and bringing in of a new partner had to be approved.  \n It is impossible to believe that the three agreements that bound Savan City to this project, and that realized the goals of Savan City - - these were binding agreements, these were not MOUs - - that those binding agreements are not operative agreements that had to be approved by the board of directors. The language of Article 6 in that 2007 agreement, which both sides agree is the operative document, made that clear.  \n (Submissions, 14 April 2015, p. 162.17 to p. 163.1. 6)\n\n79.\n\nThe Claimant\u2019s argument was that either a meeting of the Savan City Board was in fact held as required and approval was in fact given to the Asean Union Agreements, and therefore that the Government witnesses were lying, or that in Laos corporations operate freely outside the framework of their governing laws. The more plausible conclusion, however, is that no meeting of Directors was held, no approval was given, and the Asean Union Agreements were unauthorized by the Savan City corporation.\n\n**(iii) There is no Evidence that Officials in the Prime Minister\u2019s Office Received Any Application for the Approval and Grant of Permission for a Rival Casino**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n80.\n\nThe evidence of Madam Bouatha was that the approval for any new casinos licences would have to be decided at \"a meeting\" of the Prime Minister and Deputy Prime Minister. Such applications would be processed through her office as well as the Ministry of Planning and Investment.37 She testified that no such applications were ever made with respect to Savan City.38 The Tribunal has no reason to disbelieve her testimony.\n\nIbid., p. 124.1. 22\n\nTranscript, 13 April, 2015, p. 110.1. 16, p. 118.11. 12-15\n\n**VI. INTERNATIONAL LAW PRINCIPLES OF STATE ATTRIBUTION DO NOT IMPOSE LIABILITY ON THE GOVERNMENT**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n81.\n\nIt is clear that a minority shareholding in a corporation is not sufficient in international law (as well as domestic law), of itself, to attribute the acts of a corporation to its shareholders. The result is no different where the minority shareholder is a Government. Professor (now Judge) James Crawford\u2019s *Commentary* on Article 8 of The International Law Commission text so states:39\n\nIn discussing this issue it is necessary to recall that international law acknowledges the general separateness of corporate entities at the national level, except in those cases where the \"corporate veil\" is a mere device or a vehicle for fraud or evasion.\n\nThere is no evidence that Savan City was engaged in \"fraud or evasion\".\n\nSee Janies Crawford, *The International Law Commission\u2019s Articles on State Responsibility: Introduction, Text and Commentaries,* 112-113 (Cambridge University Press 2002/ See also *Gustav F W Homester GmbH & Co KG v. Ghana,* (ICSID Case No. ARB/11/28), Award (March 10 2014); *EDF (Services) Limited v. Romania,* (ICSID Case No. ARB/05/13), Award (Oct. 8, 2009) at para 190-200; *Jan de Nul N. V. Dredging International N.V. v. Egypt,* (ICSID Case No. ARB/04/13), Award (Nov. 6, 2008) at para. 157; *Bayindir Insaat Turizm Ticaret vs Sanayi A.S. v. Pakistan,* (ICSID Case No. ARB/03/29), Award (Aug. 27, 2009) at paras. 119-25\n\n82.\n\nOf course, corporate acts may be attributed to the Government if the Government directs and controls the corporation\u2019s activities,40 particularly if such control is exercised in relation to the subject matter of the dispute,41 Article 8 stands in part for the proposition that:\n\nwhere there was evidence... that the State was using its ownership interest in or control of a corporation specifically in order to achieve a particular result, the conduct in question has been attributed to the State.\n\nHowever, there is no evidence of such direction or control in this case. On the contrary, both Madam Bouatha of the SEZ Secretariat, and Mr. Chanchai representing the private developers of Savan City, testified to the contrary, and both were present and cross-examined on this point at the Singapore hearing.\n\n*Case Concerning Military and Paramilitary Activities in and Against Nicaragua (Nicaragua),* 1986 I.C.J. 14 (June 27), at para. 17; *Case Concerning the Application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide* (Bosnia and Herzegovina v. Serbia and Montenegro) (Feb. 26, 2007) at paras. 396-415\n\n*Jan de Nul, supra* note 39 at para. 173\n\n83.\n\nMadam Bouatha testified in her written witness statement:\n\n\"I can state with personal knowledge that the Government has not had any input much less control over the Savan City project for many years. Mr. Chanchai was not able to raise any money and there were no decisions to make. There was silence from him. The Government was not involved in any way in the negotiations or plans Mr. Chanchai made with Asean Union that were announced in 2014.\"42\n\nWitness Statement of Madam Bouatha dated 2 April 2015, at para. 14\n\n84.\n\nMr. Chanchai made an equivalent written statement:\n\n\"No Government official has had any involvement in design or engineering proposals I developed or SV Leasing developed over the past eight years to help me try to raise money to develop Site A. No Government official has had any involvement in developing websites for the company. No design plans I or others developed and the websites were never submitted to the Board or any Government agency or department for information or approval\"43\n\nWitness Statement of Chanchai Jaturaphagom, 3 April 2015, at para. 5\n\n85.\n\nCounsel for the Claimant in cross-examination expressed scepticism to both witnesses about the source of the drafting of their witness statements but there was no onus on the Government to establish that approval was *not* given. The onus was on the Claimant to establish on a balance of probabilities that approval *was* given. In any event the denials of Madam Bouatha and Mr. Chanchai were not shaken in cross-examination.\n\n**VII. THE CLAIMANT\u2019S THEORY OF A \"TACIT\" APPROVAL AND GRANT**\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n86.\n\nCounsel for the Claimant advanced an alternate theory that even if there was no \"approval and grant\" of permission to a rival casino, the political culture in Laos is such that powerful people and those under their protection may operate businesses under tacit or \"unofficial\" permission. Thus, according to the Claimant, an inference of permission should be drawn against the Government based on the informality of local practice. The Claimant\u2019s evolving Submission on this aspect of the \"attribution\" issue is made in its 8 April 2015 Submission as follows:\n\nClaimant has not alleged, and does not allege, that Savan City is a state entity whose action \"is in law an action by the Government.\" Claimant\u2019s case does not hinge on proving that the Government itself is responsible for Savan City\u2019s actions, including the content of its website. The point is rather that it is not credible to suggest that a company in which the Lao Government holds a significant shareholding, and enjoys a significant corporate governance presence, could have publicized that it would build a casino to future investors, and entered into a joint venture agreement to build a casino, without the Government at the very least knowing and approving of these facts, [para. 50] (emphasis added]\n\n87.\n\nThis position was supported by the evidence of the Claimant\u2019s principal, Mr. John Baldwin, as follows:\n\nWhile Laos\u2019s assertions that it has not granted a competing license might literally be true, my years of experience tell me that Laos must have at least tacitly approved a competing casino project in Savan City. As I stated previously, no developer begins to market a development to investors without at least some assurance that it has permission to build what it is marketing.44\n\nThe \"prudent promoter\" argument has already been dealt with. As to \"tacit approval\", the Claimant relied heavily on the existence of unlicensed slot club(s) owned by a Laotian citizen, Madam Kozy. In her case, the Claimant argues, Government approval consisted of no more than a wink and a nod, or simply looking the other way and ignoring her illegal use.\n\nWitness Statement of John Baldwin, 27 March 2015 at para. 4\n\n88.\n\nThe Tribunal does not agree that based on Madam Kozy\u2019s situation the words \"approve and grant\" in Article 9(24) of the *2007 Sanum PDA* can be interpreted so loosely.\n\n89.\n\nIt seems that Madam Kozy had a relatively modest slot club operating before the signing of the *Savan Vegas PDA* in August 200745. The Claimant suggests that Madam Kozy recently opened another club near the Friendship Bridge. The evidence on this point is unclear.46 The Claimant also alleges that the Government drew the boundaries of the SEZ around Madam Kozy\u2019s operations so that the Government could continue to say (disingenuously) that there were no casinos permitted in the SEZs. Madam Kozy and her business partner were well connected socially and politically.\n\nEvidence of John Baldwin, 14 April 2015 atp. 16.11 3-15\n\nEvidence of John Baldwin, 14 April 2015, p. 15,114-7\n\n90.\n\nThe Tribunal is prepared to assume that if Madam Kozy had formal licences for her slot club(s), the Government would have produced them (as requested) in this arbitration. The Tribunal concludes that no such formal licence(s) exist.\n\n91.\n\nMadam Kozy\u2019s operation may or may not be evidence of discrimination or differential treatment. It seems the Government was prepared to shape the SEZ boundary to leave her gambling operations outside.47 However, the fact that the Government has not shut down the slot club operations of Madam Kozy, which do not include a full service casino, is not of sufficient weight to persuade the Tribunal that the words \"approve and grant\" in Article 9(24) of the *2007 Savan Vegas Agreement* can be stretched out of shape because of alleged nods, winks and the single established instance of a non-compliant slot club operator (Madam Kozy). The fact that the Government may have turned a blind eye to a relatively small slot machine operation or two does not mean that there is no formal casino approval process in place or that Article 9(24) refers to something other than a formal \"approve and grant\" process. Mr. Baldwin, the principal of the Claimant, and the source of the \"tacit\" approval theory, acknowledged that indeed a formal licencing system was in place.\n\n**Q.** Who in Laos has the authority to approve a casino licence?\n\nA. Officially or unofficially?\n\n**Q.** You mean there\u2019s an unofficial chain of command in the government of Laos?\n\nA. You have a 11-member politburo who are always trading favours between each other. If any one of them wants a casino licence and is willing to trade with the others for other things they want, a casino licence will appear. The president of the country who is also - would be able to grant a licence if he wished. The head of the party, if he wished to, I believe would be able to.\n\n**Q.** Who had the official authority in the government of Laos to grant a casino licence?\n\nA. It\u2019s been - I have been told, although I don\u2019t have proof of this, that the prime minister must grant casino licences.\n\n**Q.** That is the official position of the government? The prime minister is the only authority in the country who can grant a casino licence?\n\nA. Yes. That is what I have been told.\n\n(Transcript, April 14, 2015, pp 38-39) (emphasis added)\n\nMadam Bouatha, Transcript, 13 April 2015, p. 108.1. 5 to 108 1. 7\n\n92.\n\nIt seems therefore that the ability of powerful political interests to \"get their way\" is not inconsistent with the requirement of formal approval and grant of a casino license. The argument that certain people may be able to obtain such a license despite the general prohibition does not mean the need for such a license would be dispensed with. It seems obvious a major investor, particularly a foreign investor, would want a formal written licence before making a major investment in Laotian gambling facilities, as did Sanum itself in 2007.\n\n93.\n\nIt should be noted that the Government\u2019s tolerance of Madam Kozy\u2019s slot club(s) is not put forward as an independent ground of complaint in the Claimant\u2019s Material Breach Application.\n\n**VIII. THE GOVERNMENT IS ENTITLED TO RELY ON THE 45 DAY \"CURE\" PERIOD PROVIDED IN ARTICLE 32**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n94.\n\nEven if it were established that the Government had approved and granted permission for a casino to operate in Site A with a wink or a nod on or before receipt of the Claimant\u2019s Notice of Breach on 27 June 2014, the Government had a contractual right to cure the breach within 45-days of receipt of such Notice and if it did so, there can be no revival of the ICSID arbitration.\n\n95.\n\nMadam Bouatha testified that when she learned of the Claimant\u2019s complaint that permission had been granted for a Site A casino, she summonsed Mr. Thongsay, Mr. Chanchai and a representative of the ASEAN Union, Mr. Ellingham to a meeting on 2 July 2014, and made it clear that \"only the Prime Minister\" had the authority to approve.48 She says that she was assured that there would be no casino in the Site A development.\n\nTranscript, 13 April 2015, page 110\n\n96.\n\nMadam Bouatha instructed Savan City and Asean Union to contact *The Nation* and at least one other publication to correct the published misinformation about the plan for a casino. This was done although it appears the demands made no specific reference to the casino.\n\n97.\n\nMr. Khanpheth Viraphondet, a senior legal advisor to the Government was dispatched to Savannakhet by the Prime Minister\u2019s office49 to investigate. He met with representatives of Savan City and local officials on 4 August and 5 August 2014. Mr. Khanpheth testified that his investigation confirmed that the Savan City Board had not met and that no approval was granted or purportedly granted by the local SEZ Authority or any other Government entity or official. His evidence was not weakened on cross- examination.\n\nTranscript, 13 April 2015, p. 72.11. 15-25\n\n98.\n\nThe Tribunal is satisfied that the Government did respond promptly to the 26 June 2014 misreporting in the media about a rival casino and made it clear to the private developers in Savan City that no permission for a casino had been or would be approved or granted.\n\n99.\n\nThe Claimant contends that the post 26 June 2014 conduct of the Government was not sufficient to cure the damage done. The Government\u2019s action amounted to shutting the barn door after the horse had left the stable. Prospective purchasers would already have lost confidence in the promises of the Government, and even more effective remedial action would have been futile. The breach, the Claimant says, was incurable.\n\n100.\n\nThe Tribunal does not accept the Claimant\u2019s argument that a misleading article in a Thai newspaper and subsequent and related postings inflicted such destruction on the value or marketability of Savan Vegas as to make the so-called breach incurable. Newspapers are known to most people to make mistakes. Blogs sometimes privilege speed over accuracy. The Government moved promptly to clarify its prohibition to the Savan City promoters. In any event, the evidence of Greg Bousquette, a merchant banker well versed in the gambling industry,50 who was contacted by Mr. Baldwin following the Settlement, affirmed that \"it is key that Buyers have comfort that they will get a monopoly signed off on at the highest levels of the Lao government.\"51 (emphasis added) Serious buyers would not be put off by cyber-gossip.\n\nEvidence of John Baldwin, 14 April 2015 at p. 49,122 to p. 50.1. 16\n\nC-856, Email from John Baldwin, dated 20 June 2014\n\n101.\n\nThe Tribunal accepts the evidence of the Government\u2019s expert, Mr. Govinda Singh, a principal at BDO. In Mr. Singh\u2019s opinion:\n\n... no investor would only consider a newspaper article. If an announcement is made which is not consistent with the market\u2019s understanding of the agreements in place, an investor would seek to understand the issues by undertaking further investigations.\n\nSuch \"further investigations\" would have demonstrated that permission had not been \"approved and granted\" for a rival casino, and that the Government had procedures in place to prevent permission for a casino without authority from a \"meeting\" of the Prime Minister and Deputy Prime Minister, which on the evidence was not initiated. Mr. Singh was available in Singapore to be cross-examined but the Claimant elected not to cross-examine him.\n\n102.\n\nIn order to find the Government liable for what the Claimant regards as an insufficiently public Government denunciation of reports and blogs about the \"rival casino\", the Claimant must identify some source of a legal obligation on the part of the Government to do so. In the Tribunal\u2019s view, the Government did not, as a term of the Settlement, assume any undertaking, directly or indirectly, to respond publicly to misleading statements about Savan City in the media, blogs or websites. The Settlement obligation to complete the sale \"on a basis that will maximize Sale proceeds\" (Article 13) does not go so far, nor is such a positive obligation imported into the Settlement by the duty of good faith performance under New York law.52 Assuming for the sake of argument the interpretation of the Settlement most favourable to the Claimant, its case put at its highest is that the Government was obligated to respect Sanum\u2019s monopoly. On the evidence, the Government did so.\n\nCounsel for the Claimant put this aspect of his argument as follows:  \n Q. Where do you ground that obligation to speak up?  \n Mr. Rivkin: it\u2019s grounded in the obligation of good faith and fair dealing which is in every New York law contract. It is also grounded in the specific provision of the deed that says they are going to work with us to maximize the sale proceeds, and it\u2019s grounded in the way all of the provisions of the deed of settlement work together, including this provision, and the clear purpose of Article 6 and the restating of the monopoly provision was what I have described to you earlier, is letting the market know that you can trust Lao with respect to this; you can have a higher degree of trust anyway with respect to that, and so it\u2019s based on that..  \n (Submission 14 April 2015, p. 166.1. 14 to p. 167.1. 3)\n\n103.\n\nTo the extent such misleading statements in the media and cyberspace might chill potential purchasers, such purchasers would, as Mr. Singh testified, have looked into the monopoly issue and verified the facts with senior Government officials. Upon inquiry they would have been told what Mr. Chanchai and Mr. Ellington were told. No rival casino had or would be approved.\n\n104.\n\nThe Tribunal\u2019s conclusions do not ignore Mr. Baldwin\u2019s evidence about the risk of powerful people in Laos getting their way at some future date and obtaining permission for rival gambling facilities (albeit such conduct could expose the Government to a claim for substantial damages by Sanum under s. 9 (24) of the *2014 Sanum Agreement).* However, the Tribunal is not tasked with speculation about what might happen in the future. In the Tribunal\u2019s view, the Government\u2019s default, if there was any default in June 2014 or otherwise as alleged by the Claimant, was cured within the 45 days permitted by the Settlement.\n\n**IX. THE PROPER INTERPRETATION OF ARTICLE 6 OF THE DEED OF SETTLEMENT**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n105.\n\nIn its interim ruling of 19 December 2014, the Tribunal identified two potential interpretations of Article 6, one of which favoured the Claimant and the other, had it been adopted, favoured the Government.\n\n106.\n\nIn view of the Tribunal\u2019s conclusions on the facts, it is not necessary to revisit the issue of contract interpretation, which is no longer of practical significance.\n\n**X. DISPOSITION OF THE APPLICATION FOR PROVISIONAL MEASURES**\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n107.\n\nThe Tribunal deferred to the April 13/14, 2015 Singapore hearing the Claimant\u2019s Application for a Provisional Measures Order (PMO) to preserve the *status quo* against potential Government action between the date of the April hearing and the issuance of a final award.\n\n108.\n\nBy order dated 14 April 2015, having heard the evidence, the Tribunal dismissed the PMO Application for reasons to follow. The reasons are as follows.\n\n109.\n\nAs the Tribunal noted in its Provisional Measures Order of 17 September 2013, a PMO is only available when the following conditions are met (1) **prima facie** jurisdiction; (2) **prima facie** establishment of the right to the relief sought; (3) urgency; (4) imminent danger of serious prejudice (necessity); and (5) proportionality.53 Each of these components except for (2) was met in this instance.\n\nSee also *Paushok v. Government of Mongolia,* Order on Interim Measures at para. 45 (UNCITRAL Sept. 2, 2009).  \n \"[F]ive standards have to be met\"... (1) **prima facie** jurisdiction. (2) **prima facie** establishment of the case, (3) urgency, (4) imminent danger of serious prejudice (necessity) and (5) proportionality.\"\n\n110.\n\nWith respect to condition (2) however, the Tribunal was satisfied at the conclusion of the evidence on 14 April, after deliberation, that the Claimant had not established even a *prima facie* right to the relief sought.\n\n111.\n\nThe Claimant\u2019s application for a PMO was therefore dismissed.\n\n**XI. DECISION ON THE MERITS OF THE MATERIAL BREACH APPLICATION**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n112.\n\nFor the foregoing reasons the Claimant\u2019s Material Breach Application pursuant to Article 32 of the Deed of Settlement dated 15 June 2014 as clarified by the Side Letter dated 18 June 2014 is dismissed.\n\n**XII. DISPOSITION OF COSTS**\n-----------------------------\n\n113.\n\nThe Claimant will be ordered to pay the Respondent Government\u2019s costs of the arbitration. If the parties can agree on an appropriate amount, the said amount will be incorporated in the Tribunal\u2019s Award. If no agreement on costs is reached, the Respondent Government is to make its submission on costs to the Tribunal within 60 days of this date. The Claimant will have 30 days from the filing of that submission to reply to it. The Respondent will have 30 days from the filing of the Claimant\u2019s Reply to make its response. The Tribunal will then proceed to make its Award under Article 52 of the *Arbitration* *(Additional Facility) Rules* of ICSID incorporating both the reasons herein on the merits and its disposition of costs."}, {"Title": "Decision on Costs", "Type": "Costs", "Date": "2015-11-05T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Decision on Costs\n-----------------\n\n**I. INTRODUCTION**\n-------------------\n\n1.\n\nIn its Decision on the Merits dated 10 June 2015, the Tribunal directed, pursuant to Article 58 of the ICSID Arbitration (Additional Facility) Rules, that the Government of Laos People's Democratic Republic (the \"Government\") be awarded costs against the Claimant, Laos Holdings (the \"Claimant\"), as a result of the unsuccessful allegation by the Claimant of a material breach of the Settlement Agreement dated 15 June 2014 and side letter dated 17 June 2014 (the \"Material Breach Application\").\n\n**II. THE LAW AND THE FACTS**\n-----------------------------\n\n**a) The law**\n--------------\n\n2.\n\nArticle 58 of the ICSID Arbitration (AF) Rules provides that:\n\n**Article 58**\n\n(1) Unless the parties otherwise agree, the Tribunal shall decide how and by whom the fees and expenses of the members of the Tribunal, the expenses and charges of the Secretariat and the expenses incurred by the parties in connection with the proceeding shall be borne. The Tribunal may, to that end, call on the Secretariat and the parties to provide it with the information it needs in order to formulate the division of the cost of the proceeding between the parties.\n\n(2) The decision of the Tribunal pursuant to paragraph (1) of this Article shall form part of the award.\n\n3.\n\nThis Article gives a broad discretion to the Tribunal in the allocation of costs, according to all the circumstances of the case.\n\n**b) The facts**\n----------------\n\n4.\n\nPursuant to the Decision on the Merits, counsel for the Government has submitted a claim for fees in the sum of USD $684,007.75 and disbursements of USD $78,698.08 for a total of USD $762,705.83.\n\n5.\n\nThe Material Breach Application was based essentially on an allegation that the Government had either licensed or agreed to license a rival casino contrary to the 50-year monopoly conferred on the Claimant's subsidiary by agreement with the Government. The establishment of a rival casino, according to the Claimant, destroyed much of the value of its investment and essentially rendered it unmarketable except at an unacceptable discount to the fair market of its gambling facilities predicated on a monopoly concession.\n\n6.\n\nThe Government's ultimate success turned on the testimony of public servants and other witnesses given at the hearing in Singapore on 13-14 April 2015. The Claimant's allegation of a breach of its monopoly was shown to be based on erroneous newspaper reports and the activities of promoters of a rival casino who acted without the Government's approval or encouragement.\n\n7.\n\nThe Claimant was unable to present direct evidence in support of its Material Breach Application and such secondary inferences as were available were persuasively refuted by testimony by the Government officials most directly involved.\n\n8.\n\nA list of the submissions, decisions and hearings in the Material Breach Application is attached hereto as **Appendix \"A\"** to these reasons.\n\n9.\n\nIn assessing the Government's costs of its successful defence, the Tribunal should attempt to assess a *quantum* that is fair and reasonable to both parties in all the circumstances.\n\n**c) The Government's bill of costs**\n-------------------------------------\n\n10.\n\nThe Government's skeleton bill of costs is set out in a one and a quarter page chart identifying the lawyers or paralegals who worked on the case, their hourly rate and total billing for each individual, as well as a statement of disbursements. The document is attached as **Appendix \"B\"** to these reasons.\n\n11.\n\nThe Tribunal has been provided with little in the way of submissions by either party.\n\n12.\n\nThe Claimant takes the position that considerable time and costs were unnecessarily thrown away on an ultimately unsuccessful jurisdictional challenge and related procedural issues. To further its argument, the Claimant requested copies of the billing records of the Respondent Government to determine how much time was spent on various unsuccessful procedures in the course of its defence against the Material Breach Application. The records were refused by the Government on the basis that at New York law, being the governing law of the Deed of Settlement, \"billing time sheets are privileged and are not produced to opposing counsel\". The Claimant contests that position. The Tribunal considers it unnecessary to resolve this particular dispute and will proceed on the basis of the material now made available to it.\n\n**III. THE TRIBUNAL'S ANALYSIS**\n--------------------------------\n\n**a) Reasonableness of time and hours spent**\n---------------------------------------------\n\n13.\n\nThe Tribunal has taken into account the following considerations:\n\n(a) The *quantum* of costs claimed by the Government is proportionate to the importance and the complexity of the issues at stake.\n\n(b) The *amount of time* docketed by the various lawyers and paralegals is not excessive given the degree of responsibility assumed by counsel acting on behalf of the Government and the monetary value of the matters in issue.\n\n(c) The *rates* are reasonable in the surrounding circumstances. Lead counsel for the Government are experienced lawyers in matters of international commercial law and their rates are in line with rates charged by counsel of comparable skill and experience in matters of similar value and complexity.\n\n(d) The *work's organisation* was efficient. It appears from the distribution of hours amongst counsel that appropriate measures were taken by senior counsel to delegate to more junior counsel (at a lower hourly rate) work suitable to their level of experience.\n\n(e) In the end result, *the Government was entirely successful* on the merits in resisting the Material Breach Application of the Claimant.\n\n**b) The unsuccessful jurisdictional challenge**\n------------------------------------------------\n\n14.\n\nWhile the Tribunal accepts that the time shown in the Government's bill of costs was in fact spent by each of the persons listed, and that their hourly rates are reasonable, the Government's success rested almost entirely on the factual evidence presented in Singapore on 13-14 April 2015. Prior to that date, there was much procedural skirmishing, particularly in relation to the Government's unsuccessful challenge to the jurisdiction of the Tribunal even to embark on its mandate to consider the Claimant's Material Breach Application. The Tribunal gave extensive reasons for its conclusion that there was no merit to this challenge. After the point was decided adversely to the Government, it launched an unsuccessful Request for Re-consideration which essentially repeated the arguments already made and already rejected by the Tribunal in the original (and unsuccessful) jurisdictional challenge.\n\n15.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, while the Government was certainly entitled to bring its jurisdictional challenge, it is not fair and reasonable to ask the Claimant to fully indemnify the Government against the cost of procedural skirmishing that served no purpose other than a distraction from the factual issues before the Tribunal.\n\n**c) Are there other elements to take into consideration?**\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n16.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, the Government case was made in a professional manner with due regard to economy and efficiency. However, the assessment of the Government's costs must take into account its unnecessary and unsuccessful procedural manoeuvres. Reference should also be made to the fact that the Claimant lost two successive Requests for Provisional Measures, respectively dated 19 January 2015 and 2 April 2015. The Tribunal rejected both requests, respectively on 18 March 2015 and 14 April 2015.\n\n17.\n\nAs the Government has declined to produce records that would enable the Tribunal to calculate more precisely the amount of time consumed by its jurisdictional challenges and related motions, the Tribunal will simply apply a percentage reduction as hereinafter specified.\n\n**d) Disbursements**\n--------------------\n\n18.\n\nThe Tribunal has no reason to doubt the justification for any of the disbursements. As the Government points out, USD $93,849.00 is a reasonable sum for out-of-pocket expenses for a ten-month case where the client is in Laos, witnesses were in Laos and Kuala Lumpur, and hearings were held in Washington and Singapore. The Claimant requested the presence in Singapore of the Government officials for whose expenses it is now being called on to pay.\n\n19.\n\nThe Washington hearing (and associated costs), however, was entirely dedicated to the Government's unsuccessful jurisdictional challenge and related issues.\n\n**IV. CONCLUSION**\n------------------\n\n20.\n\nIn light of the foregoing considerations, the Tribunal concludes that the *quantum* of costs claimed by the Government, exceeds what is fair and reasonable to call upon the Claimant to pay.\n\n21.\n\nAs the Government has declined to produce any breakdown of the activities in respect of which costs are claimed (apart from research on the interpretation of the Deed of Settlement under New York law and development of the Government's position in that regard), the Tribunal is left with the option of assessing a global factor to determine a fair and reasonable award of costs relative to the work done and the result accomplished.\n\n22.\n\nThe Tribunal concludes that the decision should be 70% of the total claim of USD $762,705.83.\n\n23.\n\nThe Tribunal therefore awards to the Respondent costs and legal fees of USD $533,894.08.\n\n24.\n\nPursuant to paragraphs 31 and 32 of the Settlement Agreement dated 15 June 2014, this proceeding remains suspended."}, {"Title": "Decision on the Merits of Claimants' Second Material Breach Application", "Type": "Liability", "Date": "2017-12-15T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Decision on the Merits of Claimants' Second Material Breach Application\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**I. INTRODUCTION**\n-------------------\n\n**i. The Parties**\n------------------\n\n1.\n\nThe Claimant, Lao Holdings N.V. (\"LHNV\"), owned gambling assets in Laos including the Savan Vegas Hotel and a Casino Complex in Savannakhet Province. The Casino is strategically located near the Friendship Bridge which spans the Mekong River between Laos and Thailand. The Claimant also had an investment in two \"slot clubs.\" As a result of what it considered to be treaty violations, the Claimant LHNV, a company incorporated under the laws of Aruba in the Netherlands Antilles, initiated proceedings on 14 August 2012 against the Respondent, the Government of The Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (the \"Government\"), before the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID). The claim was made pursuant to the Agreement on Encouragement and Reciprocal Protection of Investments between Laos and the Kingdom of the Netherlands,1 and the Arbitration Rules (Additional Facility) of ICSID.2\n\nSigned on 16 May 2003, in force since 1 May 2005.\n\nAs amended on 10 April 2006.\n\n2.\n\nParallel proceedings were initiated against the Government by the Claimant, Sanum Investments Limited, a LHNV subsidiary which operated the Savan Vegas Hotel and Casino, before the Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA) for alleged violations of the Agreement between the Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China and the Government of The Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic Concerning The Encouragement and Reciprocal Protection of Investments, dated January 31, 1993 and the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules as revised in 2010.\n\n3.\n\nWhile the proceedings before the two Tribunals are distinct and separate, the current application was the subject of a joint hearing in Singapore on 3 and 4 July 2017. Accordingly, for ease of reference only, LHNV will be referred to in this Ruling as \"the Claimants\", as its case is intermingled with the Sanum case. This terminology is not to suggest, however, that the two arbitral proceedings are consolidated or otherwise conjoined.\n\n**ii. The Treaty Claims**\n-------------------------\n\n4.\n\nThe Claimants allege expropriation without compensation of their investment in gambling projects described in the Project Development Agreement (\"PDA\") dated 10 August 2007 in respect of the Savan Vegas Casino, as well as the slot clubs located at the border at Lao Bao and Savannakhet Ferry Terminal (located at the Savannakhet/Mukdahan checkpoint) all in Savannakhet Province (collectively, the \"Gaming Assets\"). The claims also relate to the expected expansion of the Savannakhet Airport and opportunities for development in the Special Economic Zone at Thakheak.\n\n5.\n\nThe Claimants\u2019 original treaty claims were based on a multiplicity of alleged treaty breaches by the Government including an 80% tax on casino revenues and what the Claimants contended were unfair and oppressive audits of the Savan Vegas Hotel and Casino. In the treaty proceedings, the Claimants eventually valued their investment loss as of 31 August 2016 at between USD $690 million and USD $1 billion.3\n\nSee Reports of Joseph P. Kalt dated 14 October 2016, 2 December 2016, 22 December 2016 and 15 March 2017\n\n**iii. The Settlement**\n-----------------------\n\n6.\n\nThe treaty claims were thought to be resolved by a Deed of Settlement concluded between the parties during the merits hearing in Singapore on 15 June 2014 (to be read together with a Side Letter dated 18 June 2014) (herein referred to collectively as \"the Settlement\").\n\n7.\n\nShortly after the Settlement, the Claimants alleged that the Government had committed a material breach of its terms which entitled them to revive the Treaty arbitration (\"the First Material Breach Application\"). The Government contested jurisdiction. On 11 August 2014, the Government filed a Notice of Arbitration with the Singapore International Arbitration Centre (\"SIAC\") pursuant to Paragraphs 35 and 42 of the Settlement, seeking an order directing Sanum to comply with its settlement obligations.\n\n8.\n\nThe ICSID and PCA Tribunals held a hearing on the objections to jurisdiction, which were dismissed. However, on 20 January 2015, the High Court of the Republic of Singapore held that the PCA Tribunal did not possess subject matter jurisdiction under the 31 January 1993 Investment Treaty between Laos and China because of the status of Macao and issues of state succession not here relevant, as well as the limitation in the BIT, according to which \"only disputes over the amount of compensation for expropriation can be submitted to arbitration.\"4 This judgment was later reversed by the Court of Appeal for Singapore on 29 September 2016.5\n\n*Government of the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic v. Sanum Investments Ltd.*, [2015] SGHC 15, para. 128.\n\n*Sanum Investments Ltd. v. Government of the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic*, [2016] SGCA 57.\n\n9.\n\nIn the meantime, the ICSID proceedings continued. After hearing the parties on the merits, this Tribunal delivered a decision on 10 June 2015, dismissing the First Material Breach Application.\n\n**II. PROCEDURAL HISTORY OF THE SECOND MATERIAL BREACH APPLICATION**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n10.\n\nOn 26 April 2016, the Claimant LHNV submitted a Second Material Breach Application to the ICSID Tribunal with accompanying documentation.\n\n11.\n\nOn 29 April 2016, the Government informed ICSID that it would be submitting a response to the Second Material Breach Application which, when filed on 12 May 2016, included its Objections to Jurisdiction and a request for a procedural conference.\n\n**i. The Objections to Jurisdiction**\n-------------------------------------\n\n12.\n\nOn 24 June 2016, the Government requested a stay of the ICSID proceedings pending the outcome of the SIAC proceedings. Subsequently, the SIAC Tribunal rejected Sanum\u2019s request for interim measures to block the Government\u2019s seizure and proposed sale of the Gaming Assets.\n\n13.\n\nOn 29 June 2016, the Tribunal held a pre-hearing conference call with the parties.\n\n14.\n\nOn 30 June 2016, the Tribunal issued a Decision on Bifurcation ordering a separate hearing with respect to the Government\u2019s objections to jurisdiction.\n\n15.\n\nOn 16 September 2016, the Government submitted to the Tribunal a request for security for costs.\n\n16.\n\nOn 7 October 2016, the Claimant LHNV submitted a response opposing the Government\u2019s objections to jurisdiction, the motion to stay the proceedings and the request for security for costs.\n\n17.\n\nOn 18 October 2016, the Tribunal and the parties held a hearing on the Government\u2019s objections to jurisdiction in Brussels, Belgium. At the beginning of the hearing, the Government informed the Tribunal that it withdrew its objections to jurisdiction as they were now moot.\n\n18.\n\nOn 20 October 2016, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 8, amended on 21 October 2016, in respect of the agreed upon filing dates, rejecting the request to stay the current proceedings, but setting out a schedule that was expected to accommodate the time required by the SIAC Tribunal to complete its deliberations. The Tribunal also rejected the Government\u2019s request for an order for security for costs.\n\n**ii. The Sanum Proceedings Before the Permanent Court of Arbitration are Revived**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n19.\n\nOn 23 February 2017, the Claimant Sanum filed a Second Material Breach Application before the PCA Tribunal, which had been revived, as mentioned, by a decision of the Singapore Court of Appeals dated 29 September 2016.6\n\n*Sanum Investments Ltd. v. Government of the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic*, [2016] SGCA 57.\n\n20.\n\nOn 6 March 2017, the Claimants submitted a request for the production of documents. On 17 March 2017, the Government responded. On 31 March 2017, the Claimants submitted a reply. On 3 April 2017, the Claimants\u2019 request for production of documents was dismissed in light of the parties\u2019 prior agreement to forgo a fresh document production phase and the lack of any compelling circumstances to order otherwise.\n\n21.\n\nOn 16 March 2017, the Claimants submitted their Memorial on the Merits of the Second Material Breach Application with accompanying documentation. On 5 May 2017, the Government submitted its Counter-Memorial on the Claimants\u2019 Second Material Breach Application, with accompanying documentation. On 31 May 2017, the Claimants submitted their Reply and on 21 June 2017, the Government submitted its Rejoinder.\n\n**iii. The Hearing on the Merits**\n----------------------------------\n\n22.\n\nOn 30 June 2017, shortly before the scheduled hearing of the Second Material Breach Application on the merits, the Government filed with this Tribunal the Final Award in this dispute from the SIAC Tribunal, Case No. ARB143/14/MV, rendered on 29 June 2017 (which had been notified to the parties on 30 June 2017).\n\n23.\n\nOn 3 and 4 July 2017, the ICSID and PCA Tribunals proceeded with the merits hearing of the Claimants\u2019 Second Material Breach Application at Maxwell Chambers in Singapore. At the hearing, counsel for both parties presented comprehensive submissions to the Tribunals.\n\n24.\n\nOn 8 July 2017, the Government announced that it would be formally requesting from this Tribunal a Mareva Injunction to secure funds in the escrow account under the control of the SIAC Tribunal to ensure payment to the Government of any potential award of costs in the event of a dismissal of the Claimants\u2019 Second Material Breach Application. On 9 July 2017, the Government filed a formal application for a Mareva Injunction with accompanying documentation. By communication of 10 July 2017, the Tribunal established an expedited schedule for further submissions, which were exchanged by the parties.\n\n25.\n\nOn 17 July 2017, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 9 dismissing the Government\u2019s Application for a Mareva Injunction and reserving any award of costs until rendering a decision on the merits of the Second Material Breach Application.\n\n**III. BACKGROUND TO THE SECOND MATERIAL BREACH APPLICATION**\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n26.\n\nAs stated, the treaty claims were thought to be resolved by the Settlement. The Settlement contemplated the sale of the Gaming Assets by the Claimants within 10 months, failing which a third party agreeable to both the Claimants and the Government would assume management of the gambling facilities pending their sale on \"a basis that will maximize Sale proceeds to the Claimants and Laos\"7 including assurances to a new purchaser of the Gaming Assets of:\n\n(a) a continued gambling monopoly for 50 years in the Claimants\u2019 area of exclusivity8;\n\n(b) a \"new\" flat tax;9 and\n\n(c) discontinuance of pending criminal investigations.10\n\nSettlement, Section 13.\n\nSettlement, Section 6.\n\nSettlement, Section 8.\n\nSettlement, Section 23.\n\n27.\n\nIt was agreed that the Government would appoint RMC Gaming Management LLC (\"RMC\") or other suitable agent to assist in monitoring the Claimants\u2019 Gaming Assets pending a sale and to assist with the sale itself11 as described in Annex E to the Settlement.\n\nSettlement, Section 9.\n\n28.\n\nThe parties agreed that the Settlement would be \"governed by and construed solely in accordance with the laws of New York\"12 coupled with a somewhat complex dispute resolution mechanism:\n\n(a) The Tribunal was given exclusive jurisdiction to revive the \"suspended\" treaty proceedings in the event of a material breach of a section or sections of the Settlement specified and listed under Section 32, \"if not remedied within 45 days after receipt of notice of such breach\";13\n\n(b) All other disputes arising out of the Settlement would be referred to the Singapore Centre for International Arbitration (SIAC) under Section 35 and Section 42.14\n\nSettlement, Section 42.\n\nSection 32 provides:  \n The Claimants shall only be permitted to revive the arbitration in the event that Laos is in material breach of Sections 5-8, 15, 21-23, 25, 27 or 28 above and only after reasonable written notice is given to Laos by the Claimants of such breach and such breach is not remedied within 45 days after receipt of notice of such breach. **The Sale Deadline and any other relevant time periods herein****shall be extended by the length of time required to cure such breach**... In the event that there is a dispute as to whether or not Laos is in material breach of Sections 5-8, 15, 21-23, 25, 27 or 28 above, the Tribunals shall determine whether or not there has been such a material breach and shall only revive the arbitration if they conclude that there has been such a material breach. (emphasis added)  \n Section 35 provides:  \n In the event that the Claimants fail to comply with their obligations under this Deed, Laos shall be entitled to commence a fresh arbitration to enforce the terms of this Deed. Such arbitration shall be conducted in Singapore in accordance with the Arbitration Rules of the **Singapore International Arbitration Centre** for the time being in force. The seat of the arbitration shall be Singapore. The Tribunal shall consist of three arbitrators. Each Party shall nominate one arbitrator and the two nominated arbitrators shall nominate the presiding arbitrator. In the event that the two nominated arbitrators are unable to agree on a presiding arbitrator, the presiding arbitrator shall be appointed by the President of the SIAC Court of Arbitration. The language of the arbitration shall be English. (emphasis added)\n\nSection 42 provides as follows:  \n This Deed shall be governed by and construed solely in accordance with the laws of New York. Any dispute arising out of or in connection with this Deed, including any question regarding its existence, validity or termination, shall be referred to and finally resolved by **arbitration in Singapore in accordance with the Arbitration Rules of the Singapore International Arbitration Centre** for the time being in force, including its emergency arbitration rules. The seat of the arbitration shall be Singapore. The Tribunal shall consist of three arbitrators. Each Party shall nominate one arbitrator and the two nominated arbitrators shall nominate the presiding arbitrator. In the event that the two nominated arbitrators are unable to agree on a presiding arbitrator, the presiding arbitrator shall be appointed by the President of the SIAC Court of Arbitration. The language of the arbitration shall be English. (emphasis added)\n\n29.\n\nThe Government paid no financial compensation to the Claimants under or in respect of the Settlement.\n\n30.\n\nFollowing the execution of the Settlement, Sanum continued to operate the Casino. The Government nominated Mr. Robert Russell (the CEO of RMC) on 20 June 2014 to serve on the Flat Tax Committee (\"FTC\"), and Sanum nominated Mr. Steve Rittvo (Chairman of Innovation Group and adviser to and expert witness for Sanum) on 25 June 2014.15\n\nSee SIAC Tribunal Award, 29 June 2017, para. 74 (Flat Tax Committee - Independent Member Position Compensation Package, 20 June 2014).\n\n**i. The First Material Breach Application**\n--------------------------------------------\n\n31.\n\nHowever, as stated, on 27 June 2014, nine days after the Settlement and the Consent Award issued was executed, LHNV and Sanum gave Notice of a Material Breach alleging that the Government\u2019s violations of the Settlement \"entitle[d] Claimants to revive the international arbitration proceedings\"16 under Section 32 of the Settlement.\n\nC-777, Material Breach Notice, *Laos Holdings N.V. v. Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/12/6, p. 2, 27 June 2014.\n\n32.\n\nThe Material Breach Notice alleged in particular that the Government had violated Section 6 of the Settlement by granting or approving the grant of a gaming licence to a rival casino or casinos within Sanum\u2019s area of exclusivity, thereby substantially reducing the price at which the Claimants\u2019 Gaming Assets could be expected to be sold to prospective purchasers. The breach was said to be so serious and fundamental as not to be \"susceptible to cure due to the irreversible impact on the pool of buyers for the asset.\"17 Moreover, in any event, the Claimants took the position that under Section 32 of the Settlement \"all deed deadlines in the Deed and Side Letter are extended by the length of time required to cure this breach.\"18\n\n*Ibid*, p. 2.\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n**ii. The Claimants\u2019 Conduct Pending a Decision on the First Material Breach Application and the Impact on Subsequent Events, Rights and Responsibilities**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n33.\n\nOn 2 July 2014, the Claimants sent the Government a further email taking a more nuanced position on the suspension of deadlines, namely that while:\n\n[n]either the Deed nor the Side Letter expressly addresses what happens with respect to the parties\u2019 performance during the 45-day cure period contemplated by Section 32 of the Deed,...Claimants hereby \u2018suspend[ed] further performance under the Deed and Side Letter, at least **until we have [the Government\u2019s] response to the Material Breach Notice**... (emphasis added)\n\n34.\n\nThe Claimants proceeded to suspend (i) their participation in the work of the FT Committee to appoint a third member, and (ii) the monthly payments of RMC\u2019s fees as required under Annex E of the Deed.19\n\nC-780, Email to Minister of Planning and Investment and Werner Tsu from David Rivkin, p. 1, 2 July 2014.\n\n35.\n\nThat same day, 2 July 2014, the Claimants expressly instructed Mr. Rittvo not to participate in the FT Committee.20\n\nC-971, Laos\u2019 SIAC Opening Memorial, para. 42.\n\n36.\n\nThe Government responded by sending Sanum an email, also on 2 July 2014, asserting that if RMC were not paid, the Government would apply to SIAC to appoint RMC to take control of the Casino and to sell it.21\n\nC-781, Emails between Christopher Tahbaz and David Branson, p. 2, 2-3 July 2014.\n\n37.\n\nDespite what it regarded as bad faith conduct by the Claimants, the Government never did take steps to terminate the Settlement as threatened on 2 July 2014 or otherwise.\n\n38.\n\nOn 4 July 2014, the Claimants filed their formal Application for Finding of Material Breach of Deed of Settlement and for Reinstatement of Arbitration in the Treaty arbitration.\n\n39.\n\nOn 11 July 2014, the Government responded by asserting (and enclosing evidence) that:\n\nIn fact, there has been no grant of a license, no grant of permission, no grant of any kind that will allow the operation of a new casino in Savannakhet, Laos. That is a fact. **The Government attaches letters from the relevant officials who have personal knowledge of the recent transactions** that state unequivocally that there is no casino in the new development plans. (emphasis added)\n\n40.\n\nOn 11 August 2014, the Government filed a Notice of Arbitration with SIAC pursuant to Sections 35 and 42 of the Settlement, seeking an order directing Sanum to comply with its obligations under the Settlement, including a declaration that the waiver of overdue taxes contained in Section 7 of the Settlement was no longer binding on the Government, because Sanum refused to proceed with the establishment of a Flat Tax Committee or to cooperate with RMC\u2019s monitoring of Savan Vegas pending the sale of the Casino, plus compensation, costs and interest on all monies due.\n\n41.\n\nThe Government thereby continued to affirm the Settlement notwithstanding what it regarded as the Claimants\u2019 bad faith breaches of the Settlement.\n\n42.\n\nSanum responded in the SIAC proceedings with a request for:\n\n(a) A declaration that the Settlement was void *ab initio* as a result of the Government\u2019s alleged fraudulent inducement of the Settlement; or\n\n(b) Rescission of the Settlement in light of the Government\u2019s material breach of the Settlement;\n\n(c) Or, in the further alternative, an award of monetary damages.22\n\nC-825, Response to Notice of Arbitration and Brief Statement of Counterclaims, p. 1, 16 September 2014.\n\n43.\n\nThe SIAC Tribunal temporarily deferred ruling on Sanum\u2019s Motion to Stay the SIAC Arbitration pending the results of the Treaty arbitration rulings in the First Material Breach Application.\n\n**iii. The Government Moves Ahead to Establish a Flat Tax Committee**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n44.\n\nOn 5 December 2014, approximately six months after the Settlement had been executed, and there being no cooperation from the Claimants regarding formation of the Flat Tax Committee, the Government wrote to the President of the Macau Society of Registered Accountants pursuant to Section 9 of the Settlement explaining that a three-member committee was to be formed to determine a flat tax and requesting that the President assist in \"secur[ing] the appointment of the third member of the Committee.\" It was specified that \"[t]he person will be a member of your Society familiar with the taxation of casinos.\"23\n\nSee SIAC Tribunal Award, 29 June 2017, para. 95.\n\n45.\n\nThe Government then wrote to Sanum on 24 December 2014 requesting it to facilitate\n\n... the orderly process of the exchange of control due on 15 April 2105, in the event Sanum/LH does not complete a sale or have in place an MOU, as stated in the Deed.24\n\nR-014, Letter from Dr. Bounthavy Sisouphanthong to John Baldwin and Christopher Tahbaz, 24 December 2014.\n\n46.\n\nOn 29 December 2014, while the First Material Breach Application was still pending, the Government sent a notice to Mr. John Baldwin and Claimants\u2019 counsel advising that if the Claimants did not participate in forming the FT Committee and the Flat Tax Agreement expired, Laotian tax law would apply at a rate of 35% plus 10% VAT.25\n\nSee SIAC Tribunal Award, 29 June 2017, para. 97 (Letter from Laos\u2019 Ministry of Finance to John Baldwin and Christopher Tahbaz, 29 December 2014):  \n The Ministry of Finance has been requested by the Committee Supervising the Sanum Settlement to assist in compliance with the tax aspects of the Deed of Settlement (Deed). According to the Deed, the parties were to have agreed to a procedure to set a Flat Tax for Savan Vegas and Casino Co. (Savan Vegas). We understand that Sanum Investments Limited (Sanum) and Lao Holdings NV (LH) are refusing to comply with that procedure.  \n It is not acceptable to the Government of the Lao PDR that a large gaming establishment operating with the good licenses of the Government simply refuses to pay taxes to the Government... The Ministry of Finance requests compliance by Sanum, LH and Savan Vegas with the laws of the Government of the Lao PDR in connection with proper taxation of the gross gaming revenues of the Savan Vegas casino, operated in Savannakhet Province of the Lao PDR... **A failure to execute a Flat Tax Agreement within 30 days as required by your agreement with the Government will lead to the imposition of tax according to the laws, based upon the requested financial reports.** We call to your attention that by Presidential Decree, dated 24 October 2014, amending Article 20, point 2, of the Tax Law, the tax rate on Savan Vegas **gaming revenues has been set to 35%. In addition, 10% VAT applies to such revenues**.  \n If there is no cooperation in submitting the financial reports within 15 days, a Tax Order will be sent to Savan Vegas for the last six months of 2014, based upon the new Tax Law and the above stated estimate of revenue for 2013. If after payment of taxes so imposed, the parties later agree to a Flat Tax with retroactive effect, the Ministry will make adjustments accordingly. (emphasis added)\n\n47.\n\nThe existing Flat Tax Agreement expired according to its terms on December 31, 2013.26\n\nSee Agreement No. 2569 dated 1 September 2009 Regarding Flat Tax Payment for Casino Business of Savan Vegas and Casino between Tax Department, Financial Management Government Enterprises Department and Savan Vegas and Casino Company, Ltd.: (LHNV Exhibit C-7)  \n In order to assure that the payment of taxes of Savan Vegas and Casino Limited to the Government of Lao PDR is fit with actual business activity and is in line with the laws and regulations of Lao PDR as issued periodically, both parties agree to make this **Flat Tax Agreement for the experimental period of 5 years. This agreement shall begin the 1st of January 2009 to the 31 of December 2013.**  \n**Article 1:** Savan Vegas and Casino, LTD agrees to pay the government Flat Tax which specifically covers the Casino Business and includes Excise tax, turn over tax, profit tax, Dividend tax, and dividend which is included in the Flat Tax (see \"Dividend\" of below timetable) and is in an amount of **$745,000 (seven hundred forty-five thousand dollars) per year**... The payment shall be split into 4 payments, in the period of 3 months each. The Flat Tax shall be paid to the Provincial Tax Department of Savannkhet Province but the dividend portion of the Flat Tax shall be paid to the Ministry of Finance through State Enterprise Finance Supervision Department. (emphasis added)\n\n48.\n\nThe Claimants maintained their position that all rights and obligations under the Settlement (including the obligation to pay tax and to cooperate with the establishment of a \"new\" flat tax) were suspended pending a resolution of their First Material Breach Application.\n\n49.\n\nOn 6 January 2015, RMC, which had previously stopped working \"as a result of the lack of cooperation and payment from Savan Vegas\", and had declined to step in to act as the \"qualified gaming operator\" of Savan Vegas, were Sanum to fail to sell the Casino by the deadline of 15 April 2015,27 recommended that in its place, the Government appoint San Marco Capital Partners LLC (\"San Marco\") and its president, Ms. Kelly Gass, to manage and sell the Savan Vegas Hotel and Casino.\n\nSee SIAC Tribunal Award, 29 June 2017, para. 99 (Email from Robert Russell (RMC) to David Branson, 6 January 2015).\n\n50.\n\nOn 19 January 2015, the Claimants sought to block the Government\u2019s plan to market the Casino by filing a further Application for Provisional Measures before the ICSID Tribunal requesting an order prohibiting the Government from:\n\n(a) Applying a 45% tax (35% plus 10% VAT) on gross gaming revenues to Savan Vegas;\n\n(b) Seizing the Casino; and\n\n(c) Taking any steps that would alter the status quo of the dispute pending the resolution by the Tribunal of the Claimants\u2019 First Material Breach Application.28\n\nClaimant\u2019s Application for Provisional Measures, *Lao Holdings N.V. v. Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/12/6, 19 January 2015.\n\n**iv. The Government Moves Ahead with the Sale**\n------------------------------------------------\n\n51.\n\nEvents continued to progress. On 7 March 2015, the President of the Macau Society of Registered Accountants appointed Mr. Quin Va, a Macau registered accountant and qualified auditor, to be the Chair of the Flat Tax Committee.29 (The Government did not formally retain Mr. Va until 15 May 2015.30)\n\nC-971, Laos\u2019 SIAC Opening Memorial, para. 78.\n\nC-979, Flat Tax Committee Appointment Agreement between Laos and Quin Va, 15 May 2015.\n\n52.\n\nThe ICSID Tribunal held a telephone hearing on 10 March 2015 in respect of the Claimants\u2019 pending Application for Provisional Measures. During this hearing, the Government declared that it would proceed to form the FT Committee without the Claimants\u2019 participation:\n\nThe Government contends... that it is open to the Government to have the Flat Tax Committee constituted without the cooperation of [Sanum] by resorting under Article 9 of the Deed of Settlement, to the President of the Macao Society of Registered Accountants.31\n\nDecision on Claimant\u2019s Second Application for Provisional Measures, *Lao Holdings, N.V. v. The Government of the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/12/6, para. 33, 18 March 2015.\n\n53.\n\nOn 18 March 2015, the ICSID Tribunal denied the Claimants\u2019 Second Application for Provisional Measures, stating in relevant part:\n\nIn the Tribunal\u2019s view, the Claimant has not established a case for relief from the collection of the 45% tax on gross gaming revenues enacted in October 20 1 4.32\n\n\u2026\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the Government was quite prepared to proceed with the renegotiation of a Flat Tax Agreement under the Terms of the Settlement and in fact appointed its nominee early in July 2014. The Claimant has refused to participate as part of its broader disagreement with the Government of Laos over the status of the Deed of Settlement.\n\nWhen the Flat Tax Agreement expired on 31 December [2013], Savan Vegas became subject to the applicable tax laws of Laos. It is common ground that although Savan Vegas has continued to do business in Laos, it has not paid taxes either directly or in escrow since 1 January 2014. While it now offers to pay in escrow the sum of US $429,300 per month retroactive to 1 January 2014, there is no obligation on the Government to agree to such a figure or to any escrow arrangement.33\n\n\u2026\n\n... [F]or so long as the Claimant continues to do business in Laos, it can reasonably expect to be bound by the Laotian income tax laws applicable to gambling casinos unless and until a new Flat Tax Agreement is negotiated.34\n\n*Ibid*, para 27.\n\n*Ibid*, paras. 31-32.\n\n*Ibid*, para. 34.\n\n54.\n\nOn 30 March 2015, the Government again reiterated by letter to the Claimants the Government\u2019s intention to take control of Savan Vegas on 15 April 2015, unless Sanum had either completed a sale or had signed a binding MOU with a purchaser of Savan Vegas. Nothing less would extend Sanum\u2019s sale deadline (under the terms of Section 11 of the Settlement).35 The letter also referenced the decision of the ICSID Tribunal to reject the Application for Provisional Measures. The Government stated that:\n\nthe Government is not enjoined from proceeding to complete the takeover of the Gaming Assets (and further not enjoined from enforcing the outstanding tax invoices sent to Savan Vegas in January 2015)..... **We trust Sanum/LH will now agree to cooperate to ensure a peaceful turnover.** (emphasis added)\n\nR-018, Letter from Dr. Bounthavy Sisouphanthong to John Baldwin and Christopher Tahbaz, 30 March 2015.\n\n55.\n\nThe letter concluded by inviting Sanum:\n\nto be in contact with the Ministry of Planning and Investment \u2026 to set forth **[Sanum\u2019s] proposed compliance with these important terms of the Deed** [of Settlement]. (emphasis added)\n\n56.\n\nThe Claimants persisted in the view that while their First Material Breach Application was still pending, their obligations under the Settlement were suspended, as were the rights of the Government to proceed to take control of Savan Vegas and sell it.\n\n**v. The ICSID Tribunal Rejects the Claimants\u2019 First Material Breach Application**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n57.\n\nOn 13 and 14 April 2015, the ICSID Tribunal held a hearing on the merits of the First Material Breach Application in Singapore. On the evening of 14 April 2015, following the conclusion of the hearing, the Tribunal emailed both parties its decision not to grant the Claimants\u2019 request for a provisional measure to prohibit the Government from proceeding with the take-over of the Savan Vegas Casino:\n\nThe Tribunal is seized of [a] request for Provisional Measures in support of the Claimant\u2019s Material Breach Application. Having deliberated... the Tribunal concludes that the Claimant has failed to establish all of the requisite elements for such an order, and therefore dismisses the application, with reasons to follow.36\n\nR- 025, Email from Ian Binnie to the Parties, 14 April 2015.\n\n58.\n\nIt later emerged that during the Singapore hearing,37 Mr. Shawn Scott, Mr. Baldwin\u2019s partner, initiated a discussion with a Mr. Angus Noble about the potential purchase and sale of the Casino. On the evening of 14 April 2015, at 23:04, shortly after receipt of notification of the ICSID Tribunal\u2019s refusal of provisional measures, and minutes before the expiry of the deadline to sell the Casino, Sanum provided to the Government a MOU signed by Mr. Angus Noble on behalf of his company, MaxGaming Consulting Services, Ltd. (\"MaxGaming\"), to purchase the Casino. The Government declined to take the Noble MOU seriously and was later vindicated by the SIAC Tribunal which concluded after hearing all the evidence that the Noble MOU was not a serious document but a worthless device designed simply to extend the time of Sanum\u2019s operation of the Casino.38\n\nHearing Transcript, p. 64, *Lao Holdings N.V. v. Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/12/6, 14 April 2015 (cross-examination of Mr. Baldwin).\n\nSee SIAC Tribunal Award, paras. 189-191.\n\n**vi. The Government\u2019s Seizure and Sale of the Casino**\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n59.\n\nOn 16 April 2015, one day after the expiry of the Claimants\u2019 deadline to sell the Casino, the Government took control of the Casino. It appointed San Marco to manage and operate the Gaming Assets pending a sale.\n\n**vii. The Change of Position of Sanum Seeking to Participate in the Sale Process**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n60.\n\nOn 5 May 2015, the Claimants changed direction and proposed to \"try to work together to sell the property.\" The Government declined the offer. The Government made it clear that the effort to sell Savan Vegas \"will not be a joint effort; the Government will adopt a procedure to have a due diligence room, and create a fair process for accepting bids and evaluating them... the Government will not allow... Mr. Crawford [a senior Sanum employee] on the premises. He is free of course to meet anyone off the property and say what he wishes, but he must not be offered as an agent or emissary of the Government.\"39\n\n*Ibid,* para. 112.\n\n61.\n\nOnce again, the Government thereby affirmed the agreement to sell the Casino under the authority of the Settlement, but to do so on the Government\u2019s own terms.\n\n**viii. The** ***Ad Valorem*** **Tax Rate of Mr. Va**\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n62.\n\nOn 15 May 2015, the Government formally engaged Mr. Va to be the sole member of the FT Committee and to determine the tax to be paid by Savan Vegas.40 The Government provided Mr. Va with three documents: (i) a Gaming Tax Recommendation by BDO that described tax rates in other Asian jurisdictions; (ii) a Report to the Flat Tax Committee that described the tax situation with the other two casinos in Laos; and (iii) the Taxation Opinion of Professor Rose.41 No documents were passed to Mr. Va by or on behalf of the Claimants, who were unaware at the time of Mr. Va\u2019s appointment.\n\nC-1979, Flat Tax Committee Appointment Agreement between Laos and Quin Va, 15 May 2015.\n\nC-971, Laos\u2019 SIAC Opening Memorial, para. 81.\n\n63.\n\nIt is not clear to what extent, if at all, Mr. Va was briefed on the \"old\" flat tax arrangement between Savan Vegas and the Government dated 1 September 2009 which was to be replaced by the \"new\" flat tax he was to recommend.\n\n64.\n\nOn 23 May 2015, Sanum wrote to the Government to indicate that it was prepared to resume participation in the FT Committee if the ICSID Tribunal were to deny the Claimant LHNV\u2019s First Material Breach Application:\n\nIn the event that the ICSID tribunal denies the Material Breach Application, then that suspension [of performance of the Settlement] comes to an end and performance of the Parties\u2019 obligations under the Settlement resumes... On this basis... our clients write with regard to the immediate steps that should be taken by the Parties to move forward now with the Settlement.\n\nFT Committee... Prior to the suspension of the Deed in June 2014, the Government had appointed Robert Russell of RMC Consulting to sit on the Committee, while our clients had appointed Steven Rittvo... Please confirm that Mr. Russell remains the Government\u2019s nominee to the Committee. \\_ **As soon****as we receive that confirmation, Mr. Rittvo will reach out to Mr. Russell in order to agree the third FT Committee****Member**.42 (emphasis added)\n\nC-1050, Letter from Christopher Tahbaz to the Minister of Planning and Investment and David Branson, pp. 1-2, 23 May 2015.\n\n65.\n\nThe Government rejected the proposal (conditional in any event on the outcome of the First Material Breach Application) to proceed by way of a three members Flat Tax Committee.\n\n**ix. The Government Announces a New Plan to Sell the Casino**\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n66.\n\nOn 29 May 2015, the Government filed with the SIAC Tribunal its Response to the Claimants\u2019 Amended Provisional Measures Application. The Government acknowledged that it had seized the Savan Vegas Casino and intended to proceed unilaterally with its sale as follows:\n\n(a) the Government will terminate the Savan Vegas Project Development Agreement (2007);\n\n(b) the Government will form a Newco;\n\n(c) the Government will grant Newco a 50 years concession agreement to operate the Casino, a gaming license and land concession the day it terminates the [2007] PDA;\n\n(d) the Government **will have an independent expert set a flat tax** which will be enshrined in the Newco concession agreement;\n\n(e) on completion of the audit [of Savan Vegas], the Government will put Newco on the market for sale by **auction** ; the audit should be complete by mid-July;\n\n(f) when the bids are evaluated, and the highest bid selected, Newco will be sold;\n\n(g) the Government will pay Sanum its share of the proceeds;\n\n(h) the Government expects to close the sale before year-end.43\n\nClaimant\u2019s Response to Respondent\u2019s Amended Appeal for Provisional Measures, pp. 6-7, 29 May 2015.\n\n67.\n\nThe Government\u2019s proposed procedure did not comply (and did not purport to comply) with the terms of the Settlement.\n\n**x. The Recommendation of a 28% Ad Valorem Tax by Mr. Va**\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n68.\n\nOn 9 June 2015, Mr. Quin Va produced his report on the taxation of Savan Vegas. He considered the existing Laotian taxation system and relevant Government policies, the taxation policy of other countries in the region in relation to gambling businesses and their comparative advantages and disadvantages, the current size of Savan Vegas, the current market position of Laos in the Asian gaming industry and the impact of the gaming policies of Thailand (Savan Vegas\u2019 largest source of gamblers). Mr. Va recommended that Savan Vegas be taxed on an *ad valorem* basis at the rate of 28% of gross gaming revenue (\"GGR\").44\n\nC-971, Laos\u2019 SIAC Opening Memorial, para. 81.\n\n69.\n\nThe evidence is that during the period between his appointment (15 May 2015 when he received the three reports referred to earlier45) and the issuance of his report (9 June 2015), Mr. Va had no discussions or communications with the Claimants.\n\nR-053, Final SIAC Hearing Transcript, pp. 654-655, 24 January 2017 (testimony of Mr. Va).\n\n70.\n\nMr. Va gave no weight (if he was aware of it) to the earlier 1 September 2009 Flat Tax Agreement between Sanum and the Government for a \"flat tax\" of the fixed amount of US $745,000 per year for 5 years, ending 31 December 2013, with the possibility of a renewal.46\n\nFlat Tax Agreement between the Tax Department, Ministry of Finance, the Lao Government and Savan Vegas, 1 September 2009 (LHNV Exhibit C-7).\n\n71.\n\nOn 10 June 2015, the ICSID Tribunal issued reasons47 for its dismissal on the merits of the Claimant LHNV\u2019s First Material Breach Application.\n\nDecision on the Merits, *Lao Holdings N.V. v. The Government of the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/12/6, paras. 6, 10, 34-35, 10 June 2015.\n\n**xi. The Reliance on the Settlement both by the Government and Sanumat the SIAC Hearing on 16 June 2015**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n72.\n\nThe SIAC Tribunal convened a hearing on 16 June 2015 to deal with all pending interim relief sought by Sanum. In its decision of 29 June 2015, the SIAC Tribunal noted:\n\nAt that hearing before this Tribunal, both **Laos and Sanum****specifically reiterated their desire to enforce the Deed to effectuate the sale of the Casino** and agreed that the Deed\u2019s fundamental purpose was to sell the Casino at the maximum price possible and divide the proceeds 80/20 between Sanum and Laos.48 (emphasis added)\n\nSee C-917, Hearing Transcript, pp. 122-123 (statement of Mr. Branson), 168 (statement of Mr. Rivkin), 16 June 2015.\n\n73.\n\nIt is therefore clear that despite what the Government considered to be the wrongful and provocative conduct of the Claimants referred to above, the Government elected \"to enforce the Deed [of Settlement].\" (Sanum had earlier asked SIAC to rescind the Settlement.) The Government made it clear it had no desire to return to the *status quo ante*... The SIAC Tribunal continued:\n\nLaos also stated that it had appointed Mr. Va to unilaterally determine the tax rate and that he had already done so.49\n\nOn 18 June 2015, Laos terminated the 2007 PDA with Sanum, asserting its right to do so \"pursuant to the terms of the PDA, the provisions of the Law on Investment Promotion (2009) and other applicable laws of the Lao PDR\" and citing, among other reasons, Sanum\u2019s non-payment of taxes.50\n\n*Ibid*, p. 87 (statement of Mr. Branson).\n\nC-921, PDA Termination Notice, 18 June 2015.\n\n74.\n\nOn 30 June 2015, the SIAC Tribunal denied Sanum\u2019s Application for Provisional Measures, seeking a reversion of the operation of the Savan Vegas Casino to Sanum and a prohibition of the termination of the 2007 PDA. However, the SIAC Tribunal did order the Government to provide Sanum with regular and ongoing financial information including any developments in respect of marketing initiatives. The SIAC Tribunal also observed that the Government had acknowledged that it had, as did its agent San Marco, a \"fiduciary duty to Sanum in managing the casino and making efforts to obtain the maximum price at a sale.\"51\n\nC-919, Order on Respondent\u2019s Amended Application, para. 34, 30 June 2015.\n\n**xii. The Government Takes Ownership of the Gambling Assets**\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n75.\n\nOn 28 September 2015, the Government issued a decree transferring all assets owned by the Claimants (but not the corporate liabilities) to Savan Lao, a new entity (earlier identified as Newco) that was solely owned by the Government, in order to accomplish the sale contemplated in the Settlement,52 but on terms decided by the Government and fully disclosed to the SIAC Tribunal. In doing so, the Government claimed to be acting pursuant to the Settlement.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Opening, 3 July 2017, citing the Ministry of Finance Declaration of 28 September 2015.\n\n76.\n\nAfter receiving draft versions of San Marco\u2019s marketing documents at the end of September 2015, Sanum objected to the SIAC Tribunal that, *inter alia*, the assets on offer failed to include the Lao Bao Slot Club and the Savannakhet Ferry Terminal Slot Club. Moreover, contrary to Section 6 of the Settlement, the draft of the New PDA to be executed by the eventual purchaser contained less favourable terms than the 2007 PDA between Laos and Sanum. These departures were not contemplated by the Settlement, and according to the Claimants significantly reduced the potential sale price. However, the SIAC Tribunal declined to intervene with the Government\u2019s proposed course of action. In its view, any actionable damages suffered by the Claimants could be satisfied by financial compensation.\n\n**xiii. The Government\u2019s Failed Auction Process**\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n77.\n\nIn March 2016, six prospective buyers were approved by the Government to bid on Savan Vegas, including the eventual purchaser, Macau Legend Development Ltd. (\"Macau Legend\").\n\n78.\n\nAt the end of March, the six approved bidders were given access to relevant financial and other data, which included the relevant Savan Vegas financial statements.53 In addition, some of the bidders, including Macau Legend, met privately with Government representatives.\n\nSee SIAC Tribunal Award, 29 June 2017, para. 129 (Email exchange between Steve Croxton and Kelly Gass, 17-29 March 2016 (when asked when the financial information would be provided, Ms. Gass responds on the same day that they \"will be sending out the instructions for accessing the data room Wednesday or Thursday USA time.\")).\n\n79.\n\nIn its discussions with Government representatives, Macau Legend switched the focus somewhat from the Savan Vegas Casino to a proposed USD $300 million development for the 300-hectare land parcel adjacent to the Casino property (known as \"Site A\"). The Site A development was linked by Macau Legend to the purchase of the Casino.54 The Claimants argue that the proposed development of Site A, with facilities in competition with the Casino, further diluted the market value of the Casino itself.\n\nR-078 (SIAC), First Witness Statement of Dr. Vounthavy Sisouphanthong, para. 35,R-080 (SIAC), Witness Statement of Mr. Sheldon Trainor-DeGirolamo, para. 16, 29 November 2016.\n\n80.\n\nMacau Legend offered to purchase Savan Vegas for US $40 million, provided the auction was cancelled and Macau Legend was given development rights in Site A.55\n\n*Ibid*, paras. 24-26.\n\n81.\n\nThe SIAC Tribunal accepted the Government\u2019s evidence that as the \"auction\" process moved forward, and some potential bidders pulled out, the Government became legitimately alarmed that in the end Macau Legend would be the only bidder at the auction and in consequence be in a position to offer a low bid. The Prime Minister met with some of his Ministers and decided that Laos would accept Macau Legend\u2019s offer to cancel the auction, and close the deal with Macau Legend, provided the sale price was increased from US $40 million to US $42 million.56\n\nR-078 (SIAC), First Witness Statement of Dr. Bounthavy Sisouphanthong, paras. 39-41.\n\n82.\n\nOn 6 May 2016, Macau Legend accepted the counter-offer,57 and, on the same day, the Government advised the SIAC Tribunal that it had entered into an agreement with Macau Legend for the sale of Savan Vegas. Macau Legend and Laos executed the New PDA and other relevant documentation on or about 13 May 2016.58\n\n*Ibid*, para. 42; R-080 (SIAC), Witness Statement of Mr. Sheldon Trainor-DeGirolamo, para. 31.\n\nSee SIAC Tribunal Award, 29 June 2017, para. 136 (PDA between Laos and Macau Legend, 13 May 2016; Letter of Record for Savan Vegas Hotel, 13 May 2016).\n\n**xiv. The Macau Legend Flat Tax Agreement**\n--------------------------------------------\n\n83.\n\nThe Government and Macau Legend subsequently concluded a flat tax agreement, pursuant to which Macau Legend would pay a flat tax of US $10 million annually for three years following the closing of the purchase, which would then increase somewhat thereafter, for two extensions of one year each.59 As part of the deal, Macau Legend also committed to invest in certain infrastructure projects in Laos.60\n\nC-964, Executed Flat Tax Agreement between the Ministry of Finance of the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic and Savan Legend Resorts Sole Company Limited, 19 August 2016.\n\nSee SIAC Tribunal Award, 29 June 2017, para. 136 (PDA between Laos and Macau Legend, at Annex C, 13 May 2016).\n\n84.\n\nWhile the Claimants note the difference between the flat tax agreed to with Macau Legend, and the 28% *ad valorem* tax recommended by Mr. Va, they also contend that the \"tax\" payments of US $10 million per year in fact amounted in significant part to a deferred purchase price, which would go entirely to the Government instead of the 80/20 split agreed to in the Settlement.\n\n85.\n\nMeanwhile, as the sale to Macau Legend was being finalized, ST Vegas Enterprise Ltd. (\"ST Group\"), a Lao company that had previously partnered with Sanum (and had initially invested in the Casino and slot clubs), communicated to the Government its interest in purchasing Savan Vegas. On 15 August 2016, the ST Group offered \"to buy our properties and business of Savan Vegas and Casino, Ltd... with the proposed price of US $100,000,000 (one hundred million dollars), with additional payments of US $380 million denominated as taxes over the next twenty years.\"61 The ST proposal was not pursued by the Government.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Opening, 3 July 2017, citing Letter of Intent from ST Group, 15 August 2016.\n\n86.\n\nOn 31 August 2016, Macau Legend funded the Asset Purchase Agreement and took possession of Savan Vegas.\n\n**xv. The Award of the SIAC Tribunal Dated 29 June 2017**\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n87.\n\nAs explained above, one of the difficulties created by the framing of the Settlement is the allocation of overlapping jurisdiction in some respects between this Tribunal and the SIAC Tribunal. The Government contends that its victory at SIAC in the Award of 29 June 2017 puts an end to the treaty proceedings by virtue of the New York law doctrines of *res judicata* and issue preclusion.\n\n88.\n\nThe majority decision of the SIAC Tribunal was rendered by Judge Rosemary Barkett (Presiding Arbitrator) and Mr. Laurence Craig. An opinion dissenting in part was delivered by Ms. Carolyn Lamm.\n\n89.\n\nThe majority decision of the SIAC Tribunal concluded that the Government had not only affirmed the Settlement despite the conduct of the Claimants, but had actually implemented the Settlement:\n\n(a) The Government \"did not breach its obligations under the Deed [of Settlement]\" [Award, para. 328(f)];\n\n(b) \"The Tribunal determines that both Parties are entitled to a share of the purchase price of Savan Vegas,... as defined by the Asset Purchase Agreement between Laos and Macau Legend, proportionate to their ownership interest in Savan Vegas\" [Award, para. 312(d)];\n\n(c) \"Laos is entitled to receive 20% of the purchase price of US $15,341,000 which equals US $3,068,200 and Sanum is entitled to receive the remaining 80% which equals US $12,272,800\" [Award, para. 317];\n\n(d) In respect of the sale process, \"[LHNV and Sanum] were in material breach of their obligations under Paragraph 9 of the Deed and Annex E of the Deed concerning payment to and cooperation with RMC\" [Award, para. 328(d)];\n\n(e) \"[LHNV and Sanum] materially breached their obligations under Paragraph 10 of the Deed concerning their obligation to take steps to sell Savan Vegas\" [Award, para. 328(c)];\n\n(f) The SIAC Tribunal noted that \"[LHNV and Sanum] also argue that the Deed\u2019s requirement that the tax be \u2018flat\u2019 means that the tax should be a fixed, unchanging, periodic amount, not a fixed tax rate.\" However, [the SIAC Tribunal comments] \"the Deed does not define \u2018flat tax\u2019, and when Mr. Va, a qualified professional knowledgeable about the taxation of casinos, was asked to determine a \u2018flat tax\u2019, he interpreted this term to mean a tax with a flat rate... a flat tax is a tax that applies a constant marginal rate on income, **the Majority does not find Mr. Va\u2019s interpretation to be an unreasonable one\"** [Award, para. 287]; (emphasis added)\n\n(g) \"[LHNV and Sanum] materially breached their obligations under Paragraph 7 of the Deed concerning their obligation to cause Savan Vegas to pay taxes to Laos as of 1 July 2014\" [Award, para. 328(b)];\n\n(h) \"We conclude that [LHNV and Sanum] have not proven their claim with respect to the exclusion of the Slot Clubs from the sale of Savan Vegas\" [Award, para. 228];\n\n(i) \"The Deed itself acknowledges that [the Government\u2019s] obligation to terminate \u2018the current criminal investigations against Sanum/Savan Vegas and its management\u2019 only exists \u2018provided that the terms and conditions agreed herein are duly and fully implemented by [LHNV and Sanum] [Award, para. 310];\n\n(j) \"Evidence is undisputed that, for ten months, as delineated earlier in this Award, \u2018the terms and conditions\u2019 agreed [in the Deed] were not \u2018duly and fully implemented\u2019\" [Award, para. 311];\n\n(k) \". the Majority concludes that Claimant [the Government] did not breach any obligation under these circumstances by failing to grant the new buyer the right to extend the runway at Savannakhet\" [Award, para. 239];\n\n(l) \"Therefore, the Majority concludes that, based on the record [LHNV and Sanum] failed to demonstrate that [the Government] did not maximize the Sale proceeds of Savan Vegas\" [Award, para. 295].\n\n90.\n\nExtracts of the reasons dissenting in part of Ms. Carolyn Lamm will appear, when relevant, below.\n\n**IV. OUTLINE OF THE SUBMISSIONS OF THE PARTIES ON THE SECOND MATERIAL BREACH APPLICATION**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**i. The Claimants\u2019 Contentions in Support of the Second Material Breach Application**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n91.\n\nThe Claimants note that under New York law \"material breach\" means that \"a party has failed to substantially perform its obligations under the relevant contract or provision.\"62 Therefore, the \"Claimants need only show that the breach was material in light of the performance, promised benefit and purpose of each of the enumerated sections, not of the contract as a whole.\"63\n\nMemorial, para. 111.\n\n*Ibid*, para. 112.\n\n92.\n\nThe Claimants contend that each of the following breaches by the Government, taken in isolation, is sufficient to revive the Treaty arbitration:\n\n(a) The Government willfully breached Section 5 of the Settlement by physically seizing and unilaterally operating Savan Vegas, by expropriating the Casino\u2019s assets by decree and structuring the sale of the Casino so as to deprive Claimant of the 80% value of the proceeds;\n\n(b) The Government willfully breached Section 6 of the Settlement by terminating the Savan Vegas PDA and publicizing a new and deficient Project Development Agreement (\"PDA\") as part of the auction process. The PDA executed by the Government with Macau Legend provided for fewer rights and more obligations than the original 2007 PDA with Sanum. These modifications made Savan Vegas less valuable as a going concern;\n\n(c) The value of the \"Gaming Assets\" was further reduced by failing to include in the sale the Lao Bao Slot Club and the Savannakhet Ferry Terminal Slot Club. The Claimants reject the Government\u2019s contention that it could not sell the \"slot clubs\" as the licenses were actually held by the Claimants\u2019 former Laotian partner, ST, because, the Claimants contend, the Government was aware at the time of the Settlement of the ownership structure of the slot clubs. The Government keeps a record of the gaming licenses that it has issued. Despite this knowledge of ST\u2019s interest, the Government included the slot clubs in the definition of gambling assets to be sold as contemplated by Section 6 of the Settlement;64\n\n(d) The Government breached Sections 7 and 8 of the Settlement in respect of the \"new flat tax\" by abandoning the mutually agreed procedure, and imposing a tax which is not a flat tax but an *ad valorem* tax of 28% of gross gambling revenues. The Claimants contend that under any plausible scenario an *ad valorem* tax of 28% GGR depressed materially the value of the Casino. According to the Claimants, the wrongful purpose of setting an *ad valorem* tax was to confiscate value from the Claimants and to reduce the Claimants\u2019 share of the proceeds;\n\n(e) The 28% *ad valorem* tax is discriminatory as it has only been applied to Savan Vegas and not to other casinos in Laos. Furthermore, the Claimants point to the lump sum payments of US $10 million per year by Macau Legend for the first three years as proof of what was always understood by both the Government and the Claimants to constitute a \"flat tax.\" The breach of the promise of a flat tax was willful and altogether destroyed a material driver of the value of the gambling assets. The *ad valorem* tax was non-flat and unreasonably high and thereby materially depressed the purchase price;\n\n(f) Furthermore, the Government misused the *ad valorem* tax to justify seizing a substantial part of the Claimants\u2019 share of the purchase price paid by Macau Legend for payment of supposed back taxes;\n\n(g) The Government accepted a lower price for the sale of the Casino in exchange for Macau Legend\u2019s agreement to pay post-purchase inflated flat-tax payments;\n\n(h) The Government also breached Section 15 of the Settlement by depositing all of the sale proceeds in its own bank accounts or those of its own wholly-owned entity Savan Lao rather than in a joint escrow account. It then wrongfully diverted US $26,659,000 million of the $42 million purchase price to satisfy the Claimants\u2019 alleged tax liability which was not lawfully imposed. According to the Claimant, \"the fact that Respondent deposited the remaining US $15,341,000 in a sole party escrow account almost four months after the transaction closed, in an effort to make a show of compliance [with the Settlement], does not change the fact that Laos failed to comply with the Deed\u2019s requirement that all proceeds be deposited directly by the buyer into a **joint** escrow account established by both Parties\";\n\n(i) The Government breached Section 25 of the Settlement by falsely representing to prospective purchasers that expansion of the Savannakhet Airport runway was not feasible. While the Government suggested the possibility of development of a new airport at an alternative location, such an \"alternative\" proposal does not remedy the breach. Construction of a new airport will take longer and cost more than extending the existing Airport at Savannakhet, and, under New York law, a material breach in respect of a unique asset cannot be cured by substituting a different asset. Based on their experts\u2019 calculations, the Claimants contend that the failure to include the airport right in the sale resulted in the material loss of nearly a fifth of the Casino\u2019s value;\n\n(j) The Government breached Section 22 of the Settlement in respect of Thakhaek development site. The Claimants paid the US $500,000 deposit required by Section 22 and they say they attempted to negotiate in good faith development proposals for the 90 hectares site but were stonewalled by the Government and have received none of the benefit which was intended and expected. The Government refused to negotiate the Thakhaek Agreements in good faith and in particular:\n\n(a) refused to include the most valuable 16 hectares of the site on the basis that it was private property, notwithstanding that the 16 hectares were included on the map attached to the MOU, in which the Government had implicitly committed itself to pay compensation to the private owners;\n\n(b) rejected without explanation the Claimants\u2019 proposal for an alternative concession arrangement;\n\n(c) based on the valuation of their expert, the Claimants claim that the opportunity to develop the Thakhaek concession was worth as much as US$ 10.52 million;\n\n(k) The Government materially breached Sections 23 and 27 of the Deed by commencing and continuing to pursue criminal investigations in US Federal Courts under 28 USC 1782, invoking the suspended allegations of bribery and attempted corruption. The Government\u2019s pursuit of those criminal investigations entitles the Claimant \"to revive arbitration proceedings on that basis, in addition to the other material breaches described above.\"65\n\nThe Government explains the \"slot club\" issue as follows:  \n What actually happened was that it was admitted that ST owned the land on which the slot clubs were built, ST owned the buildings in which the slot clubs operated and ST owned the licences issued by the government to operate the slot clubs. All Mr. Baldwin had was a contract which is called, in the slot club industry, a participation agreement, which allows you to put your slot clubs into somebody else\u2019s property under their licence and you share the profits 60/40. That was the only 60/40 right Mr. Baldwin had. It was to 60 per cent of the profits of operating the slot machines.  \n I wrote to them three times, and it\u2019s listed in the SIAC Award. I wrote to them in July, August and September, and each time I said to them, \"We have discovered that ST owns the slot clubs\", and even the participation agreement cannot be assigned - Sanum was the 60 per cent majority in the participation agreement - the agreement expressly says it cannot be assigned unless ST agrees to the assignment.  \n So we said to them, \"The government has no objection to selling the slot clubs, delighted, but we can\u2019t sell them if the owner doesn\u2019t agree. So please deal with ST and come up with a solution.\" (3 July 2017, Hearing Transcript, p. 165.)\n\nMemorial, para. 168.\n\n**ii. The Government Defences to the Second Material Breach Application**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n93.\n\nThe Government points out that the Claimants\u2019 arguments and contentions in this Application rest on the same basis and duplicate the legal claims decided against the Claimants by the SIAC Tribunal on 29 June 2017. Accordingly, under New York law, the principles of *res judicata* and issue preclusion apply to bar the application.66\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 11. Preclusion is \"plainly applicable here because all the facts and legal issues that serve as the basis of Sanum\u2019s claims in these proceedings were fully pled before, and are soon to be adjudicated by, the SIAC Tribunal.\"\n\n94.\n\nThe Government emphasizes that in order to revive a pre-settlement claim under the Settlement, interpreted in accordance with New York law, \"the breach must be material, destroying the \u2018root of the bargain\u2019\"67 of the entire contract.\n\n*Ibid*, para. 28.\n\n95.\n\nThe Tribunal has already determined that Section 32 requires a determination \"on both the existence of the breach and its materiality.\"68 The Government says the Claimants agreed at SIAC and in the treaty proceedings that the \"root of the bargain\" is to sell the Casino \"on a basis that will maximize Sale proceeds.\"69 The SIAC Tribunal concluded that the Casino was in fact sold for maximum value within the meaning of Section 13 (which is not a section listed in Section 32 and therefore not within the jurisdiction of the Tribunal). The breaches alleged against the Government under Sections 5-8 - even if established - would by definition not be material because the Claimants did receive the essence of their bargain, namely the sale of the Casino \"on a basis that will maximize Sale proceeds.\"\n\nRejoinder, para. 23.\n\nSettlement, Section 13.\n\n96.\n\nInsofar as the Claimants argue that revival under Section 32 is equivalent to the equitable remedy of rescission, the Government points out that entitlement to an equitable remedy requires clean hands. The Claimants and their principals do not have \"clean hands.\" They have committed repeated acts of fraud and bribery. Even at the date of the Settlement, Mr. Baldwin had no intention of selling the Savan Vegas Casino regardless of the price, according to the Government:\n\n(a) First, Tak Chun, the possible buyer touted by Mr. Baldwin, at the time of the Settlement, was not an interested buyer. \"Sanum concocted this false narrative from the very beginning, during the settlement negotiations, in order to keep control of the Casino. It is only because Sanum said they had a buyer that it was allowed [by the Government] to keep control for 10 months to complete the sale;\"70\n\n(b) Second, the First Material Breach Application was a bad faith effort to pressure Laos to renegotiate the Settlement. The strategem failed but \"the Decision on the Merits exposed Sanum\u2019s bad faith. The LHNV Tribunal held that the Government did not materially breach the Deed, but also, and more significantly, that Sanum\u2019s decision to unilaterally stop performance and disregard the \u2018cure\u2019 provision was wholly unjustified;\"71\n\n(c) Third, the Government says the Claimants put forward a fraudulent buyer, Mr. Angus Noble, for Savan Vegas after the First Material Breach Application failed. \"Claimants induced Mr. Noble to sign this fraudulent document [the MOU], suborned knowingly false testimony from Mr. Noble [by paying him] $10,000 per month for twenty-one (21) months. Sanum submitted the fraudulent Noble MOU to the Government, and more egregiously, to the SIAC Tribunal, all in an effort to further Mr. Baldwin\u2019s objective of maintaining control of the casino;\"72\n\n(d) \"Rather than accept the Government\u2019s numerous invitations to participate in the transition of control, and to help the Government complete the Deed\u2019s purpose by selling the Casino, Mr. Baldwin chose [to pursue] the Angus Nobel fraud. For Mr. Baldwin, the Noble fraud \u2018was the right thing to do\u2019 simply because he desperately \u2018needed\u2019 to maintain control - **that was the plan all along** ;\"73 (emphasis added)\n\n(e) In late spring-early summer 2015, after the Settlement, Mr. Baldwin hatched a scheme to bribe Government officials in an attempt to recover control of Savan Vegas. The Government points to a draft consulting agreement with an unemployed security guard, Mr. Ben Gersten, disclosing (the Government says) the bribe that Mr. Baldwin was willing to pay to Government officials to permit Sanum to recover control of the Casino;\n\n(f) The Government says bribery is part of Sanum\u2019s regular business model as shown by numerous documented and uncontroverted acts of illegality uncovered or proven after the Settlement was signed. It is now established, the Government says, that Mr. Baldwin authorized a bribe of $30,000 to obtain the original 2009 Savan Vegas Flat Tax Agreement, and paid various other bribes to have the Thanaleng Slot Club shut down, to tamper with witness in the court case with his former partner, ST, and to obtain a lottery license in Cambodia.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 44.\n\n*Ibid*, para. 50.\n\n*Ibid*, para. 70.\n\n*Ibid*, para. 73.\n\n97.\n\nThe Government concludes: \"In light of Sanum\u2019s egregious bad faith conduct in connection with the Deed, the Tribunal should exercise its broad discretion under New York law and the ICSID Rules to refuse to aid Sanum, the unclean litigant.\"74\n\n*Ibid*, para. 101.\n\n98.\n\nIn the result, the Government claims the following relief: \"the Tribunals must deny the Second Material Breach Application and dismiss Sanum\u2019s claims in their entirety.\"75 Both Tribunals must order \"that these arbitration proceedings are discontinued and terminated.\"76 Finally, the Government claims indemnification under Section 28 of the Settlement.77\n\n*Ibid*, para. 102.\n\n*Ibid*, para. 102.\n\nSection 28 provides:  \n Each of the Claimants and Laos shall indemnify and keep the other Party hereto indemnified on demand and shall defend and, hold the other Party hereto harmless from and against all liabilities, loss, damages, expenses and claims of any nature whatsoever by any person for any and all losses or damages arising out of or in any way connected with the indemnifying Party\u2019s breach hereof and any negligent or willful act or omission of the indemnifying Party hereunder.\n\n**V. THRESHOLD ISSUES RAISED BY THE GOVERNMENT AGAINST THE ENTIRETY OF THE CLAIMANTS\u2019 APPLICATION**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**i.** ***Res Judicata*** **and the Alleged Impact of the SIAC Award Rendered on 29 June 2017 on the Jurisdiction of the Tribunal**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**(a) The Government\u2019s Position**\n---------------------------------\n\n99.\n\nThe Government contends that the issues raised by Sanum in the Government-initiated SIAC proceedings track the issues raised by the Claimants in the ICSID and PCA proceedings. Thus, \"LHNV literally cut and pasted their claims from the Second Material Breach Application into their Second Amended SIAC Counterclaims.\"78\n\nRespondent\u2019s Opening, 3 July 2017.\n\n100.\n\nThe Claimants\u2019 Second Material Breach Application contains 65 paragraphs, of which 35 paragraphs present Sanum\u2019s legal claims, and of these 35 paragraphs, 33 paragraphs are identical to the text of Sanum\u2019s Counterclaims before the SIAC Tribunal.79\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 6.\n\n101.\n\n*Res judicata* and collateral estoppel are plainly applicable here because all the facts and legal issues that serve as the basis of Sanum\u2019s claims in these proceedings were fully pleaded before, and were adjudicated by, the SIAC Tribunal.80 The Government cites in support of its position, *inter alia*, the decision of the New York Court of Appeals for the proposition that:\n\n[I]n general the doctrines of claim preclusion and issue preclusion between the same parties (more familiarly referred to as res judicata or direct estoppel) apply as well to awards in arbitration as they do to adjudications in judicial proceedings.81\n\n*Ibid*, para. 11.\n\nRLA-063, *Matter of American Ins. Co. (Messinger - Aetna Cas. & Sur. Co.),* 43 N.Y. 2d 184, 189-90, 191 (Ct. App. 1977).\n\n**(b) The Claimants\u2019 Position**\n-------------------------------\n\n102.\n\nThe Claimants deny that the SIAC Award precludes the Tribunal from reviving the Treaty arbitration under Section 32 of the Settlement. First, the SIAC Tribunal had no jurisdiction to consider the only relief claimed before this Tribunal, namely whether the Claimants are entitled to revive the Treaty arbitration under Section 32 of the Settlement. Second, New York procedure does not govern these proceedings *. Res judicata* and issue preclusion questions are to be governed by international law.\n\n103.\n\nIn any event, the Government has not established the prerequisites for *res judicata* or issue preclusion for the following reasons: first, the claims do not meet the triple identity test applied by international tribunals, (identity of parties, causes of action and relief);82 second, under New York law, \"claim preclusion could be invoked only to bar a claim that had been or could have been brought in the prior proceeding\";83 third, [t]here are no clear rules under international law as to how, when and whether the doctrine of issue preclusion is to be applied as between two arbitrations\";84 and fourth, under New York law, \"collateral estoppel [issue preclusion] applies only if the issue in the two forums is identical, there was a full and fair opportunity to litigate the issue in the first forum, and the issue was actually decided and necessary to the outcome in the first forum.\"85\n\nCLA-316, *Gavassi v. Romania*, ICSID Case No. ARB/12/25, Decision on Jurisdiction Admissibility and Liability, 21 April 2015, paras. 164, 166:  \n 164... From its perspective as an international tribunal formed under the BIT, the Tribunal applies international law as the law applicable to these questions  \n 166... Under international law, three conditions need to be fulfilled for a decision to have binding effect in later proceedings: namely, that in both instances, the object of the claim, the cause of action, and the parties are identical.\n\nReply, para. 61.\n\n*Ibid*, para. 62.\n\n*Ibid*, para. 63.\n\n104.\n\nThe Government\u2019s only reference to an \"international\" case is *Grynberg and RSM v. Grenada*86 which was not a case (as here) where the two tribunals were constituted under the same instrument, with one tribunal assigned jurisdiction over certain issues, and the other tribunal assigned jurisdiction over certain other issues.\n\nRLA-071, *Grynberg and RSM v. Grenada*, ICSID Case No. ARB/10/6, Award, 10 December 2010, paras. 2.4.1, 4.6.18.\n\n**(c) The Tribunal\u2019s Ruling**\n-----------------------------\n\n105.\n\nThe preclusion issue must be approached from an international law perspective.87 The Tribunal was not \"constituted\" by the Settlement. It was constituted under, and derives its jurisdiction from, international treaties. The Treaty hearings were suspended (perhaps permanently) by the Settlement, but the Tribunal continues to exist \"in suspense\" as a Treaty Tribunal. A finding of a material breach of one of the sections listed in Section 32 is a condition precedent, of course, to any revival of the Treaty arbitration, but the fact that the parties have stipulated that \"(t)his Deed shall be governed by and construed solely in accordance with the laws of New York\" does not transform the Treaty Tribunal into a domestic New York commercial arbitration tribunal.\n\nCLA-293, Gary Born, *International Commercial Arbitration*, (Second Edition) (Kluwer 2014), para. 3775:  \n Nonetheless, as discussed above, there are substantial grounds for doubting that national preclusion rules are appropriate in international arbitration, particularly with regard to the preclusive effects of arbitral awards. For the reasons already detailed, the appropriate choice-of-law treatment of the preclusive effect of awards is to develop and apply uniform international standards of preclusion derived from the New York Convention.  \n Mr. Born\u2019s point was that international tribunals should not resort to national law because it could often lead to overly technical applications of preclusion. (See Hearing Transcript, R-047, 18 October 2016, p. 23).\n\n106.\n\nAs acknowledged by counsel for the Government at an earlier stage in these proceedings, the contractual basis of arbitration jurisdiction distinguishes international arbitrations from a court system established under a state constitution:\n\nMr. D. Branson:... there\u2019s a hierarchy, in our court system. That doesn\u2019t exist in international arbitration. So, technically, while you must, under New York law, if you\u2019re a court in New York, apply the doctrines of *res judicata* and collateral estoppel, you\u2019re not required to apply them. We would have to ask you to apply them as a matter of wisdom and good sense.88\n\nR-047, Hearing Transcript, 18 October 2016, p. 18.\n\n107.\n\nWhile the Government took a more aggressive position on this point at the merits hearing in Singapore, in the Tribunal\u2019s view, Mr. Branson\u2019 earlier statement is the correct analysis.\n\n108.\n\nEven in matters governed by U.S. domestic law, including the law of New York, it is for the parties to determine by contract their chosen \"scheme of remedies.\" Party autonomy in arbitration in this respect is affirmed by the jurisprudence cited in the *American Restatement of Law (Judgments)* :\n\nAssuming that the arbitration procedure has the elements of validity and has become final, it should be accorded claim preclusive effect **unless a scheme of remedies requires that it be denied such effect**.89 (emphasis added)\n\nCLA-360, *American Restatement (Second) of Law (Judgments)* Section 84 Arbitration Award (1982), (March 2017 Update); Chapter 6, Special Problems Deriving from Nature of Forum Rendering Judgment.\n\n109.\n\nIn arbitral matters, the contract governs. The Settlement confers two distinct and separate arbitral mandates without creating any preclusive hierarchy in their authority to decide issues within their respective spheres. The Settlement creates no rule of paramountcy between the SIAC Tribunal and this Treaty Tribunal. The application in these circumstances of *res judicata* or issue preclusion would be contrary to the freedom of contract exercised by the parties.\n\n110.\n\nAcceptance of the Government\u2019s position would set up the proverbial \"race to the Courthouse.\" If the Claimants could get a revival from the Tribunal before the Government could get an award in its favour from SIAC, then the Claimants would prevail. If SIAC issued a favourable award first, the Government would prevail. The scheme of overlapping jurisdiction created by the Settlement does create some complexities, but there is nothing in the Settlement to suggest that the parties intended the complexities to be solved by a \"race to the Courthouse.\"\n\n111.\n\nThe SIAC Tribunal itself acknowledged the existence of separate mandates to be exercised by the SIAC Tribunal and this Tribunal to address different causes of action and different remedial relief:\n\nGiven the contents of the prior decision of the LHNV BIT Tribunal, the Second Material Breach application, and Respondents\u2019 Amended Response and Counterclaims, **we cannot conclude**, based on the record before us, that there is a **substantial overlap of the issues** and requested relief before the LHNV BIT Tribunal and the issues and requested relief remaining before this Tribunal.90 (emphasis added)\n\nC-962, SIAC Tribunal\u2019s Order on Interim Measures and Requests to Stay Proceedings, 22 July 2016, para. 5.\n\n112.\n\nThe Tribunal has no authority to abdicate in favour of a SIAC Tribunal its Section 32 mandate to revive or not to revive the Treaty arbitration.\n\n113.\n\nThat having been said, it is equally the duty of the Tribunal to confine itself to the sections listed in Section 32 and not to second guess the SIAC Tribunal in respect of sections of the Settlement not listed in Section 32.\n\n114.\n\nThus, for example, Section 9 of the Settlement describes the procedure for the determination of the \"new flat tax.\" The SIAC Tribunal concluded that the process adopted by the Government did **not** violate Section 9. The Claimants contend that Section 9 is incorporated by reference into Section 8, but counsel for the Government correctly points out the fallacy of this position:\n\nIf [the Claimants] wanted to make section 9 or the way that the Flat Tax Committee was formed or the way it operated or the way they made a fair and reasonable tax, then get section 9 into section 32.\n\nWe didn\u2019t agree to put section 9 in section 32. You can\u2019t incorporate by reference, when you have two clauses next to each other, one of them is in section 32, the next one is not, and then say, \"Oh, this one really is in section 32 because it\u2019s incorporated in section 8.\"91\n\nHearing Transcript, 3 July 2017, p. 175.\n\n115.\n\nAny views of the Tribunal about the Government\u2019s compliance with the **process** set out in Section 9 are not relevant because Section 9 is not listed in Section 32. On the other hand, the Tribunal is required to determine for the sole purpose of revival whether the **outcome** of the Section 9 process was a \"new flat tax\" within the meaning of Section 8. The differing mandates under Sections 32 and 42 of the Settlement are not to be confused (and the legitimate expectation of the Claimants thereby negated) by doctrines of *res judicata* and issue estoppel.\n\n116.\n\nThe Tribunal is thus limited in its jurisdiction to a sub-set of sections of the Settlement, namely those listed in Section 32. The SIAC Tribunals have no such limitation, either in terms of the elements of the Settlement (except Section 32) subject to their consideration, or in the type of relief (including financial compensation) which they may grant except for the \"carve out\" from SIAC jurisdiction in respect of revival of the Treaty arbitration. Therefore, the \"carve out\" in favour of this Tribunal must be respected.\n\n117.\n\nThe Government\u2019s objection based on *res judicata* and issue preclusion is rejected.\n\n**ii. Did the Claimants Forfeit Any Right to Government Performance Under the Settlement by Their Own Non-Performance?**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n118.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees with the Government that during the pendency of the First Material Breach Application, and in particular in the period beyond the 45 day cure period, the Claimants repeatedly violated important obligations under the Settlement, including through their refusal to proceed with the establishment of a Flat Tax Committee, to cooperate with RMC\u2019s monitoring of Casino matters pending the sale of the Casino, or to cooperate in \"the orderly exchange of control\" of the unsold Casino on 15 April 2015.\n\n119.\n\nThe issue is whether these breaches of the Settlement preclude the relief sought by the Claimants in their Second Material Breach Application.\n\n**(a) The Government\u2019s Position**\n---------------------------------\n\n120.\n\nThe Government contends that the Claimants forfeited by their repudiation of their obligations under the Settlement any procedural rights under the Settlement to participate in the sale of the Gaming Assets. Despite provocation and disruption by the Claimants, the Government proceeded prudently by subjecting the sale process to the supervision of the SIAC Tribunal, which endorsed (where it did not actually direct) the steps taken by the Government to sell the Gaming Assets. Any departures from the process set out in the Settlement were made under SIAC supervision in order to salvage a sale \"that maximized proceeds.\"\n\n**(b) The Claimants\u2019 Position**\n-------------------------------\n\n121.\n\nThe Claimants say that their obligations under the Settlement were **suspended** until the First Material Breach Application was decided on 10 June 2015. At that point, the Government had a choice: treat the Settlement as terminated by reason of material breaches by the Claimants, or, notwithstanding such breaches, affirm and carry on with implementation of the Settlement. The Government, having elected to continue to take the **benefit** of the Settlement by so declaring and proceeding with the sale of the Gaming Assets as it did, was thereby obligated to accept the **burden** of the Claimants\u2019 rights and privileges.92 As pointed out by the Claimants, the Government explicitly affirmed its intention to take the benefits under the Settlement:\n\n(i) in the Government\u2019s Notice of Arbitration filed with SIAC dated 14 August 2014, at para. 37;\n\n(ii) in the Government\u2019s Response to Sanum\u2019s Amended Application for Provisional Measures dated 29 May 2015, at p. 26; and\n\n(iii) in the Government\u2019s Amended SIAC Notice of Arbitration dated 3 June 2015 at para. 79.\n\nSee Claimants\u2019 Opening, 3 July 2017, citing CLA-367, *V.S. Intl\u2019l v. Boyden World Corp.*, 862 F. Supp. 1188 (S.D.N.Y. 1994):  \n When one party to a contract materially breaches the contract during the course of a continuing performance, the non-breaching party \"has a choice presented to him of continuing the contract or of refusing to go on.\" *Id.* (quoting *Emigrant Industr. Savs. Bank v. Willow Builders, Inc.*, 290 N.Y. 133, 145, 48 N.E.2d 293, 299 (1943)). When the \"injured party chooses to go on, he loses his right to terminate the contract because of the default.\" *Apex Pool Equip.*, 419 F.2d at 562. In short, \u2018[o]nce the non-breaching party elects to continue the contract, he may not at a later time renounce his election and seek to terminate based on the prior breach.\"  \n \u2026  \n Accordingly, based on the findings of fact set forth above, this Court finds that defendant is not liable to plaintiffs for breach of contract because plaintiffs elected to affirm the contract by continuing to receive benefits thereunder.\n\n122.\n\nEven after the sale of the Casino to Macau Legend on 31 August 2016, the Government repeatedly affirmed its election before the SIAC Tribunal:\n\n(i) 14 October 2016: \"The Government is entitled to specific performance under Section 16 of the Deed;\"93\n\n(ii) 23 December 2016: \"The Government is entitled to both specific performance and money damages under the Deed;\"94\n\n(iii) 22 January 2017: \"The Government fully performed its duties and therefore is entitled to specific performance and damages.\"95\n\nLaos\u2019 SIAC Opening Memorial, para. 91.\n\nLaos\u2019 SIAC Rejoinder, para. 95.\n\nLaos\u2019 SIAC Opening Statement, 7:19-22.\n\n123.\n\nThe Government derived substantial benefits from its affirmation of the Settlement:\n\n(a) It received US $15,341,000 out of the sale proceeds, as well as unfettered access to the Casino\u2019s revenues for over a year;\n\n(b) It recovered US $26,659,000 in taxes from the period before the sale on the basis of an *ad valorem* tax on 28% of gross gaming revenue;\n\n(c) It received US $500,000 as payment to restart the Thakhaek negotiations which led nowhere;\n\n(d) In the meantime, the Government has relied on the Section 27 release and suspension of the Treaty arbitration to avoid litigating the alleged treaty violations.\n\n124.\n\nCiting New York jurisprudence,96 the Claimants contend that \"it is black-letter law that when one party to a contract materially breaches it, the non-breaching party has two options: it can terminate the agreement and sue for total breach, or it can continue the contract and sue for partial breach. There is, however, no third option allowing the party claiming a breach to invoke \u2018self-help\u2019 and only perform those obligations it wishes to perform.\"\n\n*ESPN, Inc. v.

Niagara Mohawk Power Corp.*, 259 A.D. 2d932, 686 N.Y.S.2d 911; *Farnsworth Contracts*, Section 8.19 (3d ed. 1999).\n\n**(c) The Tribunal\u2019s Ruling**\n-----------------------------\n\n125.\n\nThe Settlement was a compromise under which the Claimants gave up (on conditions) their claim to treaty compensation (the merits and quantum of which were never determined) in exchange for a process for the sale of the Gaming Assets that included substantial rights of participation by the Claimants.\n\n126.\n\nWhile the Tribunal ultimately found the First Material Breach Application to be without merit, the Government thereafter declined the renewed offers of cooperation, but instead:\n\n(a) assumed control of the Casino;\n\n(b) unilaterally carried out preparation for its sale;\n\n(c) implemented a procedure to determine the applicable tax;\n\n(d) adopted a 28% *ad valorem* tax;\n\n(e) sold the Casino to Macau Legend in a package that included \"Site A\" to which the Casino licence would be transferred.\n\n127.\n\nThe Government clearly affirmed and relied on the terms of the Settlement to sell the Gaming Assets and to rid Laos of the Claimants and their managers and principals. As emphatically stated by counsel for the Government to counsel for the Claimants in an email of 30 May 2015 rejecting Sanum\u2019s belated proposal to participate in the Flat Tax Committee:\n\nThe Government rejects your assumptions and proposals.\n\nThe Government has stated its position on the overall issues in its Response dated May 29, 2015, filed with the SIAC Tribunal.\n\nThe Government has no interest in continuing any dealings with **the criminals you represent**.97 (emphasis added)\n\nC-981, Email from David Branson to Christopher Tahbaz, 30 May 2015.\n\n128.\n\nBy affirming the Settlement on numerous occasions up to and including the hearing on 3 and 4 July 2017, the Government obliged itself to accept the burden as well as the benefit of its terms, however distasteful it may have found the obligation to continue to deal with the officers and principals of the Claimants. As expressed by the dissenting arbitrator in the SIAC Award of 29 June 2017 at paragraphs 5 and 6:\n\nUnder New York law, a party may not accept the benefits of a contract while refusing to accept the burdens.\n\nIf there is a material breach, the non-breaching party must choose between two remedies: to terminate the contract or to continue it. Under New York\u2019s doctrine of election of remedies there is not a \"third option\" allowing a party claiming breach to invoke self-help and only perform those obligations which it wishes to perform.\n\n129.\n\nIndeed, in the course of the hearing of 3 July 2017, counsel for the Government acknowledged a more nuanced position:\n\nSo the court says [in ESPN Inc. v. Office of the Comm\u2019r of Baseball98] baseball has two choices: it can terminate the parties\u2019 contract and claim damages for total breach, or it can continue the contract and sue for partial breach. That\u2019s the law of New York.\n\nThe point is that you have to look at the type of contract the parties are engaged in to determine what the options are when you are confronted with a breach. What it usually means is you are confronted with a breach, you obviously, if it\u2019s a material breach, have the right to terminate the contract and sue for damages for the whole contract, but there are times when that\u2019s not in the interests of the party on the other side... so [it] can continue performance because you get the benefit of the future performance, but **you can sue for partial damages** that have occurred.99 (emphasis added)\n\nCLA-281, *ESPN, Inc. v. Office of the Comm\u2019r of Baseball*, 76 F. Supp. 2d 3.83, 398-398 (S.D.N.Y. 1999).\n\nHearing Transcript, 3 July 2016, pp. 220-221.\n\n130.\n\nThe Government\u2019s potential claim for \"partial damages\" is not before the Tribunal.\n\n131.\n\nThe Tribunal intends no disrespect to the majority decision of the SIAC Tribunal. The Tribunal is concerned only with the entitlement (if any) of the Claimants to rely on Section 32 of the Settlement. This was not an issue that was dealt with or could be dealt with by the SIAC Tribunal.\n\n132.\n\nAccordingly, the Government erred in treating the Claimants as having forfeited important ongoing rights to renewed participation in the sale of the Gaming Assets.\n\n**iii. Are the Claimants Barred from Claiming the Benefit of Section 32 Because They Did Not Perform Their Contractual Obligations and New York Law Provides That a Party in Default Cannot Call on the Other Contracting Party for Enforcement?**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**(a) The Government\u2019s Position**\n---------------------------------\n\n133.\n\nThe Claimants are barred from Section 32 relief because of their failure to perform their own obligations: (i) to establish and complete the work of the Flat Tax Committee; (ii) to accept RMC as the qualified gaming monitor; (iii) to pay taxes to the Government; (iv) to sell the Gaming Assets; and (v) to cooperate in the transition of control to the Government after failing to sell the Gaming Assets within ten months.100\n\nRejoinder, para. 78.\n\n134.\n\nSuch failures bar the Application under the two interrelated principles that (a) \"one who breaches a contract may not seek to enforce other provisions of that contract to his or her benefit\" and (b) \"in order to seek relief under the Deed, Sanum must establish its own performance of its obligations, which it cannot.\"101\n\nRejoinder, para. 77.\n\n**(b) The Claimants\u2019 Position**\n-------------------------------\n\n135.\n\nNew York law establishes no such principle applicable to a commercial contract where (as here) both parties allege multiple breaches by the other. It is common in litigation in New York and elsewhere for both contracting parties to point a finger at the other as contract breakers. Both parties may succeed in their claims in some respects and lose in other respects.\n\n**(c) The Tribunal\u2019s Ruling**\n-----------------------------\n\n136.\n\nThe Government\u2019s argument assumes the point in issue, namely whether it is the Claimants or the Government (or both, or neither) that is in breach of the Settlement.\n\n137.\n\nIn this particular case, the Government relies principally on the Claimants\u2019 conduct prior to the dismissal by the ICSID Panel of the First Material Breach Application on 10 June 2015.\n\n138.\n\nHowever, since at least 8 May 2015,102 the Claimants have professed a desire to participate in the Flat Tax Committee and preparations for the sale of the Casino but were rebuffed by the Government, which, while affirming its reliance on the Settlement, refused to have \"any dealings with the criminals you represent.\"103\n\nC-1045, Respondent\u2019s Amended Provisional Measures Application, SIAC, 8 May 2015, para. 36:  \n Second, instead of waiting for the Flat Tax Committee to establish the proper tax - the Respondents are prepared to constitute that Committee immediately, to preserve their contractual rights under Sections 8 and 9 of the Settlement in the event that the Material Breach Application is denied.\n\nC-981, Email from D. Branson to C. Tahbaz, 30 May 2015.\n\n139.\n\nThe Government clearly regarded as made in bad faith the Claimants\u2019 late flowering offer to cooperate in the sales process which they had for months declared to be \"suspended.\"104 Apart from everything else, the Government says the Claimants took the position that the end of the \"suspension\" re-started the clock, giving the Claimants a further 10 months of time of the Casino **starting from the date of the end of the suspension**... But the Claimants\u2019 good or bad faith was never put to the test. They were simply shut out of the sales process as \"criminals.\" (emphasis added)\n\nThe Government\u2019s interpretation of the 8 May 2015 \"offer\" differs from that of the Claimants:  \n What their position was, was not that we want to admit that you are in proper control of the casino and then let\u2019s work together to set a flat tax so you can sell it. No. Their positions was: \"We\u2019re entitled to control of the casino for ten more months because the period was suspended while we were having our material breach application, and if you give us the casino back for ten more months, then we\u2019ll set up a Flat Tax Committee because we\u2019re going to sell the casino.\"  \n That wasn\u2019t acceptable to the government. Ten months meant ten months. As the SIAC tribunal said, if their version of the suspension provision was correct, they could just keep filing material breach applications and we would never see the sale of the casino. That was another feature to what was going on at that time.  \nWe took control in April. I asked Mr. Baldwin in the proceeding in Paris, I said, \"Mr. Baldwin, did you ever intend to allow the government to sell the casino?\" It\u2019s on page 1120 of the transcript of the fourth day.  \n Well, his answer was, \"No, I never intended to allow the government to sell the casino.\" And everything he did, everything he did between April and when we sold the casino was to try and prevent the government from selling the casino. (Hearing Transcript, 3 July 2017, pp. 182-183)\n\n140.\n\nIn the circumstances, it is not open to the Government to simultaneously affirm and rely on the Settlement while attempting to ban the Claimants from seeking a remedy on the basis of the Claimants\u2019 conduct (or misconduct) that predated the Government\u2019s affirmations that continued to and included the Singapore hearing on 3 and 4 July 2017.\n\n**iv. Are the Claimants Barred from Relief Under Section 32 Because They Do Not Have \"Clean Hands\"?**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**(a) The Government\u2019s Position**\n---------------------------------\n\n141.\n\nThe Government contends that the Tribunal should not revive the Treaty arbitration at the request of \"criminals\" who are \"unclean litigants.\"\n\n142.\n\nThe Government contends that the Claimants\u2019 unclean hands are a complete bar to the Second Material Breach Application.105 Each instance of misconduct described by the Government in its Counter-Memorial \"meets the legal requirements for unclean hands - the conduct (1) relates to the Deed, (2) was committed in bad faith; and (3) injured the Government.\"106\n\nRejoinder, paras. 70-75.\n\n*Ibid*, para. 70.\n\n143.\n\nThe Government argues that the remedy sought by the Claimants, namely revival of the Treaty arbitration, is in substance an equitable remedy for rescission of the Settlement, and is therefore barred by unclean hands. The fact that the parties have a contract \"does not convert rescission into a remedy at law.\"107 It notes that the Claimants have pleaded rescission before SIAC as an alternative ground for relief.\n\n*Ibid*, para. 71.\n\n**(b) The Claimants\u2019 Position**\n-------------------------------\n\n144.\n\nThe Claimants contend that the Government\u2019s unclean hands defense is irrelevant to the issues before the Tribunal and unsupported by the evidence. Under New York law, a \"clean hands\" defense bars only equitable relief108 and the Claimants seek no such equitable relief, only a procedural order explicitly authorized by Section 32 of the Settlement as a matter of contract law not equity. The Claimants point out that the Government \"does not even attempt to explain how a procedural determination, allowing the BIT arbitrations to resume on the merits in accordance with a contractual termination provision, could constitute equitable relief.\"109\n\nCLA-325, *Aetna Cas. And Sur. Co. v. Aniero Concrete Co.*, Inc.., 404 F.3d 566 (2d. Cir. 2005):  \n \"Unclean hands is *an equitable defense to equitable claims*... Because the [claimant] seeks damages in an action at law, [respondent] cannot avail itself of unclean hands as a defense.\"  \n See also CLA-338, *Hasbro Bradly v. Coopers & Lybrand*, N.Y.S.2d 461 (N.Y. App. Div. 1987).\n\nReply, para. 68.\n\n145.\n\nMoreover, the Claimants argue, the \"clean hands\" argument invites the Tribunal to examine the truth of the Government\u2019s \"allegations of fraud and bribery\" but such allegations fall outside the Tribunal\u2019s Section 32 jurisdiction. To the extent (if any) that the same allegations are at issue in the underlying Treaty arbitration, the Tribunal may consider them only *after* granting the Section 32 applications, and may do so only on the frozen record agreed at the time of the Settlement as specified in Sections 33 and 34 of the Deed.\"110\n\n*Ibid*., para. 70. The Claimants continue: \"The Government \"does not even attempt to connect [the Claimants\u2019 \"alleged misconduct\"] with the relief that the Claimants are seeking here or the Government\u2019s breaches, as required to plead an unclean hands defense, nor does it attempt to assert that it was injured by them.\", para. 84.\n\n**(c) The Tribunal\u2019s Ruling**\n-----------------------------\n\n146.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that the claim under Section 32 of the Settlement is not a claim for equitable relief. The Claimants seek to enforce a contractual right. They do so as a matter of legal entitlement (Section 32 uses the word \"shall\"). There is no equitable discretion. Section 32 does not use \"may\" which would signal the existence of a discretion, to which the Government might address arguments for dismissal.\n\n147.\n\nThe Government argues that in effect the Claimants\u2019 demand for revival is equivalent to its demand at SIAC in rescission:\n\n... because as to their counterclaims in SIAC and their claims here, they\u2019re identical. The only difference they say is, \"We\u2019re asking for revival instead of rescission\" - no, they are asking for rescission which leads to revival.111\n\nHearing Transcript, 3 July 2017, p. 147.\n\n148.\n\nThe Tribunal is unable to agree. A revival of the Treaty arbitration would be *enforcement* of Section 32, not rescission of the Settlement. Revival of the Treaty arbitration would be on the terms set out in Sections 33 and 34 of the Settlement governing the content of the record and the bar against \"new claims or evidence... or additional relief.\"\n\n149.\n\nAccordingly, the Claimants do not seek rescission or other form of equitable relief and under New York law, the enforcement of a **legal** contractual right, if otherwise justified, is not conditional on \"clean hands.\" The defence based on unclean hands cannot therefore bar the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction.\n\n**VI. THE GOVERNMENT\u2019S ALLEGED MATERIAL BREACHES OF THE SECTIONS LISTED IN SECTION 32 OF THE SETTLEMENT**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**i. Are Any of the Government\u2019s Breaches \"Material\"?**\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n150.\n\nIn its Interim Ruling on Issues Arising Under the Deed of Settlement, the Tribunal held that:112\n\n... Section 32 gives the consent of the parties to the jurisdiction of the Tribunal to decide whether there has been a breach and whether the breach thus established is material.\n\nR-013, para. 70.\n\n**(a) The Claimants\u2019 Position**\n-------------------------------\n\n151.\n\nThe Claimants dispute the relevance of the Government\u2019s argument that a party may rescind a contract only for a material breach of the contract as a whole. According to the Claimants, New York law requires Section 32 to be enforced **as written** and therefore, the Claimants are entitled to an order granting their Second Material Breach Application for a material breach of **any** of the listed sections. In any case, argue the Claimants, the Government\u2019s breaches deprived the Claimants of virtually all the benefits agreed by the parties in the Settlement. The Claimants add: \"Under any reasonable view of the facts, these breaches are a material breach of the Settlement as a whole, regardless of whether Laos sold the assets it decided to sell on terms that maximized their sale price.\"113\n\nReply, para. 47.\n\n152.\n\nMany of the listed Settlement provisions have nothing to do with maximizing the sale price under Section 13: the Government has disregarded the civil and criminal releases (Sections 23 and 27), breached the escrow provision (Section 15) that the proceeds of the sale be deposited **directly** into a **joint** escrow account; formally expropriated the Claimants\u2019 assets in breach of Section 5, breached Section 22 respecting the Thakhaek concession, and Sections 7 and 8 on the imposition of taxes. Section 32 of the Settlement gives Claimants the right to revive the arbitration if **any** of these provisions has been materially breached irrespective of whether Section 13 has been breached or the Settlement as a whole has been materially breached.\n\n153.\n\nThe Claimants argue that the Government also materially breached Settlement provisions designed to support the sale price separately from Section 13, such as Sections 6, 7, 8 and 25.114 The Claimants explain that these terms were included because \"they would have a profound effect on the nature and value of the concession that was being transferred to the buyer of the Gaming Assets.\" The assets sold by the Government materially differ from the \"Gaming Assets\" the parties agreed to sell, and the proceeds of the sale were correspondingly reduced.\n\nThe Claimants cite CLA-298, *Hadden v. Consolidated Edison Co. of N.Y. Inc.*, 34 N.Y.2d 88, 96 (N.Y. 1974):  \n There is no simple test for determining whether substantial performance has been rendered and several factors must be considered, including the ratio of the performance already rendered to that unperformed, the quantitative character of the default, the degree to which the purpose behind the contract has been frustrated, the willfulness of the default, and the extent to which the aggrieved party has already received the substantial benefit of the promised performance. (See 3A Corbin, Contracts, paras. 704-707, 6 Williston, Contracts, paras. 841-888 844 [3rd ed.]).\n\n154.\n\nThe Claimants point out that \"if the Government were right that only a breach of Section 13 could be material, Section 32 of the Deed would be entirely meaningless. Section 32, as amended by the Side Letter, lists twelve separate sections - which do not include Section 13 - that are capable of being materially breached. If the Government were right that only Section 13 can be materially breached, then Section 32 could never apply because Section 13 is not listed there. That is obviously not what the parties intended when they negotiated Section 32, and it cannot be what Section 32 means.\"115\n\nReply, para. 41.\n\n155.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, under New York law, Claimants are entitled \"to rely on the terms of the Deed of Settlement as agreed by the parties. Performance that substantially departs from what the parties agreed is not substantial performance and is by definition a material breach.\"116\n\n*Ibid*, para. 42. Emphasis in the original.\n\n**(b) The Government\u2019s Position**\n---------------------------------\n\n156.\n\nThe Government emphasizes that \"to revive a pre-settlement claim under New York law and the Deed, the breach must be material, destroying the \u2018root of the bargain.\u2019\"117\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 28.\n\n157.\n\nThe Government contends that, under New York law, a party may rescind a contract only for a material breach of the contract as a whole. In light of the facts that: (i) the SIAC Tribunal found that the Government successfully \"maximized sale proceeds\" within the meaning of Section 13; and (ii) the Claimants agreed throughout these proceedings that the essential purpose of the Settlement was to \"maximize\" the sale proceeds, therefore none of the other alleged breaches, even if established, can be considered \"material\" under New York law. The essential benefit of the parties\u2019 bargain as expressed in Section 13 has been satisfied. This is not a matter that can be revisited by the Tribunal because Section 13 itself is not listed in Section 32.\n\n**(c) The Tribunal\u2019s Ruling**\n-----------------------------\n\n158.\n\nThe text of Section 32 of the Settlement governs. It provides for revival \"in the event that Laos is in **material breach of Sections** 5-8, 15, 21-23, 25, 27 or 28.\" Section 32 does not speak of material breach **of the Deed**... Accordingly, the Government is correct that revival is justified only if the breach is material but the text of Section 32 makes clear that materiality is decided disjunctively on a section by section analysis of the provisions listed in Section 32 and not on the Settlement as a whole.\n\n159.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees with the Claimants that a breach of Section 13 cannot be a condition precedent to revival under Section 32, because Section 32 sets out the conditions for revival and Section 13 is not referenced in Section 32.\n\n160.\n\nIn determining materiality of a breach of a listed section, however, the Tribunal is content to proceed on the basis of the formulation of \"materiality\" suggested by the Government, namely that the breach of the section must \"go to the root\" of the benefit promised by that section, and \"defeat the object of the parties\" in their agreement on that provision.118\n\nThe Government cites *Frank Felix Associates, Ltd. v. Austin Drugs, Inc.*, 111 F.3d 284, 289 (2d Cir. 1997), RLA-012.\n\n**ii. Did the Government Imposition of a 28%** ***Ad Valorem*** **Tax Comply with the Promise of a \"New Flat Tax\" in Section 8 of the Settlement?**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**(a) The Claimants\u2019 Position**\n-------------------------------\n\n161.\n\nAn *ad valorem* tax is not a \"flat tax.\" The guarantee of a flat tax was an essential feature of the Claimants\u2019 plan to market the Casino. The inability to offer a flat tax, and the consequent destruction of shareholder value by imposition of an *ad valorem* tax went to the root of Section 8 and indeed to the value to the Claimants of the Settlement as a whole.\n\n**(b) The Government\u2019s Position**\n---------------------------------\n\n162.\n\nThe Government adopts the position of the majority of the SIAC Tribunal in the 29 June 2017 Award as follows:\n\n[LHNV and Sanum] also argue that the Deed\u2019s requirement that the tax be \"flat\" means that the tax should be a fixed, unchanging, periodic amount, not a fixed tax rate. However, the Deed does not define \"flat tax\" and when Mr. Va, a qualified professional knowledgeable about the taxation of casinos, was asked to determine a \"flat tax\", he interpreted this term to mean a tax with a flat rate... a flat tax is a tax that applies a constant marginal rate on income, **the Majority does not find Mr. Va\u2019s interpretation to be an unreasonable one**... (emphasis added)\n\n**(c) The Tribunal\u2019s Ruling**\n-----------------------------\n\n163.\n\nSection 8 of the Settlement promised the Claimants a \"new flat tax\" to be ascertained by following the procedure set out in Section 9. Section 9 is not listed in Section 32. Section 8 provides as follows:\n\nLaos and the Claimants agree that a **new flat tax** (\"FT\") shall be promptly established **in accordance with the procedure described in Section 9 below**, and such FT shall be applied to the Gaming Assets with retroactive effect dating back to 1 July 2014. The FT shall apply throughout the fifty (50) year term of the PDA. Such FT shall be escalated by five percent (5%) at the fifth (5th) anniversary of the Effective Date and by five percent (5%) on every five (5) year anniversary thereafter throughout the term. (emphasis added)\n\n164.\n\nA distinction must be drawn between the **outcome** promised in Section 8 (\"a new flat tax\") and the **procedure** by which the outcome is achieved under \"the procedure described in Section 9 below.\"119\n\nSection 9 provides:  \n 9. Laos shall appoint RMC Gaming Management LLC (\"RMC\") not later than ten (10) days after the Effective Date, on the terms and conditions attached hereto as Annex E. If RMC does not accept the appointment within 4 days of the Effective Date, Laos shall appoint another agent to assist it in the matter as described in Annex E. Within ten (10) days of the Effective Date, the Claimants (collectively) shall nominate one person and Laos shall nominate one person (which may be an employee of RMC) to be members of a Flat Tax Committee (the \"FT Committee\"). Within ten (10) days after the Effective Date, the two persons nominated by the Claimants and Laos to the FT Committee shall nominate a mutually acceptable third FT Committee member. If the two FT Committee members fail to reach an agreement on such third FT Committee member within such deadline, the third FT Committee member shall be appointed in the sole discretion of the President of the Macau Society of Registered Accountants. Within forty-five (45) days of the Effective Date, the duly composed, three-member FT Committee shall determine a new fair and reasonable FT applicable to the Gaming Assets, taking into due consideration all relevant information submitted to the FT Committee by the Claimants and Laos.\n\n165.\n\nSection 7 of the Settlement actually cross-references the lump sum flat tax, which is \"specifically indicated in Article 1 of the previously signed FTA attached as Annex D hereto.\" The \"previously signed FTA\" affords no basis for the imposition of an *ad valorem* tax.\n\n166.\n\nSections 7120 and 8 are within the jurisdiction of the Tribunal whereas Section 9 is not. Accordingly, the Claimants are bound to accept the view of the SIAC Tribunal that the **process** followed by the Government in establishing a \"new flat tax\" complied with Section 9. However, the Tribunal is required to form its independent view as to whether the **outcome**, namely the resulting 28% *ad valorem* tax, comes within the expression \"new flat tax\" which in Section 8 the Government and the Claimants agreed \"**shall** be promptly established.\"\n\nSection 7 provides:  \n Laos shall forgive and waive any and all taxes and related interest and penalties due and payable by the Claimants and the Gaming Assets up to 1 July 2014 in respect of the Gaming Assets, provided, however, that taxes shall be due and payable as from 1 July 2014 as provided in Section 8 below. The taxes covered herein are all taxes and fees including but not limited to those that are specifically indicated in Article 1 of the previously signed FTA attached as Annex D hereto.\n\n167.\n\nUnder Section 7 of the Settlement, the Government \"waived any and all taxes and related interest and penalties due and payable by the Claimants and the Gaming Assets up to 1 July 2014\" at which point implementation of a \"new flat tax\" as provided in Section 8 was expected to come into effect.\n\n168.\n\nAccording to the Tribunal, an *ad valorem* tax is not a flat tax within the meaning of Section 32 of the Settlement.\n\n169.\n\nThe Government argues, in effect, that the word \"flat\" refers to \"rate\", but the word \"rate\" nowhere appears in Section 8, where the word \"flat\" clearly modifies the word \"tax.\"\n\n170.\n\nThe \"**new**\" flat tax is to replace the \"old\" flat tax which was a \"fixed unchanging, periodic amount.\" The SIAC Tribunal suggested that there was no definition of flat tax in Section 8. With respect, this ignores the word \"new\" which relates the obligation back to the previous \"old\" lump sum flat tax. Mr. Va gave no weight (if he was aware of it) to the \"old\" flat tax under the 1 September 2009 Flat Tax Agreement between Sanum and the Government which required a \"fixed unchanging periodic\" payment of US $745,000 per year for 5 years, with the possibility of renewal.121 Instead, Mr. Va was given a report by the Government\u2019s expert, Professor Nelson Rose, which advocated a tax based on percentage of revenue.122\n\nFlat Tax Agreement between the Tax Department, Ministry of Finance, the Lao Government and Savan Vegas, 1 September 2009 (LHNV Exhibit C-7).\n\nC-979, Flat Tax Committee Appointment Agreement between the Government of the Lao PDR and Quin Va, 15 May 2015, para. 5:  \n 5. **The Procedure:** On or before May 26, 2015, the Government\u2019s expert on gaming taxation, BDO, will prepare and present to Mr. Va a report on gaming customs and practices in Asia with respect to taxation of gaming operations. The report will provide data concerning casinos throughout Asia including the two casinos now operating in Laos. **The Government will also****present a report by Professor L. Nelson Rose, on the necessity of stating the flat tax as a percentage of gaming revenue.** Mr. Va will set the flat tax regime applicable to the Gaming Assets during the life of the concession to be granted to the new buyer and operator of the Gaming Assets. While Mr. Va may consider the BDO report and the Professor Rose report, he is equally free and able to consider information from his own experience or if he so desires, his own research, it being further understood that Mr. Va may consider the factual and financial characteristics of the Gaming Operations and of other gaming facilities in Asia, the 50-year life of the concession and other factors he deems relevant. **Mr. Va may freely determine the basis for the flat tax, whether expressed as a percentage of revenues, dollar amount or other measure**, provided that the measure, once established, will not be subject to revision during the life of the concession. Mr. Va may utilize others for assistance, but he retains the authority and responsibility to set the flat tax. (emphasis added)\n\n171.\n\nIt is evident that Mr. Va did not focus his research on flat tax regimes but broadly canvassed the taxation policy of different countries in the region in relation to gambling businesses and their comparative advantages and disadvantages, the current size of Savan Vegas, the current market position of Laos in the Asian gaming industry and the impact of the gaming policies of Thailand (Savan Vegas\u2019 largest source of gamblers).123\n\nSee SIAC Tribunal Award, 29 June 2017, para. 277.\n\n172.\n\nThe Government knew full well the difference between an *ad valorem* tax with a flat (28%) rate and a \"new flat tax\" for a fixed lump sum annual amount (as had been agreed to in 2009). The Government soon entered into an agreement dated 19 August 2016 for a lump sum flat tax, at the request of Macau Legend. The result was described in the text of the Macau Legend Agreement as a \"flat tax.\"\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Flat Tax Agreed to with Sanum in 2009** | **Flat Tax Agreed to with Macau Legend dated 19 August 2016** |\n| Article 1: Savan Vegas and Casino, LTD **agrees to pay the government a Flat Tax** which specifically covers the Casino Business and includes Excise tax, turn over tax, profit tax, Dividend tax, and dividend **which is included in the Flat Tax** (see \"Dividend\" of below timetable) **and is in an amount of $745,000 (seven hundred forty five thousand dollars) per year**... The payment shall be split into 4 payments, in the period of 3 months each. The Flat Tax shall be paid to the Provincial Tax Department of Savannakhet Province but the dividend portion of the Flat Tax shall be paid to the Ministry of Finance through State Enterprise Finance Supervision Department.124 (emphasis added) | B. In the Letter of Record dated May 13, 2016, the **Investor requested that the Company pay a flat tax** in connection with or relating to the Concession Rights, Concession Activities, the Project and Project Management. The PDA provides that such flat tax shall be paid **pursuant to this Flat Tax Agreement** (this \"Agreement\"). In consideration of the foregoing and the mutual promises contained herein, and intending to be legally bound hereby, the parties agree as follows: 1... 2. **Amount. The flat tax shall be United States Ten Million (US $10,000,000.00) per****year** (the \"**Flat Tax**\") in relation only to Gaming Activities. 3. **Payee**... The Company shall pay the Flat Tax to the Tax Department of the Ministry of Finance. 4. **Period of Application of Flat Tax.** Subject to Paragraph 5 below, **the Flat Tax** shall be paid for the three (3) year period commencing from the Closing and ending on the third anniversary of the Closing.125 |\n\nFlat Tax Agreement between the Tax Department, Ministry of Finance, the Lao Government and Savan Vegas, 1 September 2009 (LHNV Exhibit C-7).\n\nC-964, Executed Flat Tax Agreement between the Ministry of Finance of the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic and Savan Legend Resorts Sole Company Limited, dated 19 August 2016.\n\n173.\n\nWhile substitution of an *ad valorem* tax with a flat tax rate was in the view of the SIAC majority \"reasonable\" for SIAC\u2019s purposes, the majority did so by deferring to Mr. Va\u2019s \"legal\" opinion.\n\n174.\n\nIn the view of the Tribunal, however, the issue is not what Mr. Va regarded as \"reasonable\" but whether what he recommended, and what the Government accepted, could correctly be described as a \"new flat tax\" within the meaning of Section 8. In the view of the Tribunal, a 28% *ad valorem* tax is non-compliant.\n\n175.\n\nThe question remains whether the 28% *ad valorem* tax is a **material** breach of Section 8. In the view of the Tribunal, the breach is material. It is noted that every other casino in Laos also pays a flat tax established as a lump sum annually.126\n\nC-980, Joel M. Melendez Report to the Flat Tax Committee, 28 May 2015, para. 23 (Kings Roman Casino) and para. 35 (Dansavanh Casino).\n\n176.\n\nIt is apparent from both the First Material Breach Application and the Second Material Breach Application that the Claimants regarded a flat tax as essential to the successful marketing of the Casino.\n\n177.\n\nThe expert evidence is that the market value of the Casino is highly sensitive to taxation and that establishment of a \"fair and reasonable\" fixed payment would enhance the marketability of the Gaming Assets and the price they would fetch in the market. Rightly or wrongly, the Claimants clearly regarded a \"flat tax\" as of the essence of Section 8. It went to the \"root\" of the Section 8 bargain. The Claimants\u2019 *quantum* expert, Dr. Joseph Kalt, proceeded on the basis that a fair and reasonable flat tax in respect of the Casino would be no more than $2,062,200 each year for 5 years and assumed such flat tax amounts would escalate by 5% on the fifth anniversary of the 15 June 2014 Effective Date, and escalate by an additional 5% on every five-year anniversary thereafter, as stated in the Settlement.127 This suggested tax burden (which, of course, was no more than an untested opinion) was materially less than the imposition of an *ad valorem* tax calculated by the Government at $26,659,000 and deducted from the proceeds of the sale.\n\nWitness Statement of Joseph P. Kalt, Ph.D., dated 14 October 2016, p. 22.\n\n178.\n\nIn the view of the Tribunal, the Government\u2019s failure to establish a \"new\" flat tax similar in form to the \"old\" flat tax is a breach of Section 8 of the Settlement and the breach is \"material\" within the meaning of New York law.\n\n179.\n\nAccordingly, on that basis alone, the Claimants are entitled to a revival of the Treaty arbitration.\n\n**iii. Did the Government\u2019s Collection of Alleged Tax Arrears of $26,659,000 Constitute a Material Breach of Section 7 of the Settlement?**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**(a) The Claimants\u2019 Position**\n-------------------------------\n\n180.\n\nThe Claimants contend that they were entitled to pay no more than the \"new flat tax.\" The Government refused to participate in the Flat Tax Committee even though the Claimants remained ready, willing and able to do so after the dismissal of the First Material Breach Application. The Government was not entitled to affirm and rely on the Settlement while at the same time attempting to collect a tax that was not authorized under the Settlement and which no other casino in Laos was required to pay.\n\n**(b) The Government\u2019s Position**\n---------------------------------\n\n181.\n\nThe Respondent contends that the Claimants\u2019 privileged tax status ended on 1 July 2014. At that point, being a Casino conducting business in Laos, they were required to pay the tax established by the law of Laos for such a business. In the absence of a new flat tax agreement, which was to be established by a process boycotted by the Claimants, the Claimants were bound by the ordinary law, and having failed to do so, the Government was entitled to collect the arrears of tax owing.\n\n**(c) The Tribunal\u2019s Ruling**\n-----------------------------\n\n182.\n\nThe Claimants and the Gaming Assets were required to pay taxes \"as from 1 July 2014 **as provided in Section 8 below**.\" The SIAC majority concluded that there had been a \"new flat tax\" established \"as provided in Section 8 below\", and therefore the Claimants were in default for not paying the 28% *ad valorem* tax as required by Section 7.128\n\nSection 7 provides:  \n 7. Laos shall forgive and waive any and all taxes and related interest and penalties due and payable by the Claimants and the Gaming Assets up to 1 July 2014 in respect of the Gaming Assets, **provided, however, that taxes shall be due** and payable as from 1 July 2014 **as provided in Section 8 below**... The taxes covered herein are all taxes and fees including but not limited to those that are specifically indicated in Article 1 of the previously signed FTA attached as Annex D hereto. (emphasis added)\n\n183.\n\nIn light of the conclusion of the Tribunal that no \"new flat tax\" had been established within the meaning of Section 8, and that the Claimants had, after numerous breaches of the Settlement, attempted to rejoin the FTC process, and moreover that the Government had (notwithstanding these breaches) elected to continue to affirm the Settlement, it follows that there was no tax properly payable \"*as provided in Section 8 below.*\"\n\n184.\n\nHowever, the Government\u2019s waiver of taxes ended on 30 June 2014. At the time of the taking of the $29,659,000, the Casino had paid no taxes whatsoever since December 31, 2013. The Casino had no right to operate in Laos free of tax.\n\n185.\n\nThe ICSID Tribunal in rejecting the Claimants\u2019 Second Application for Provisional Measures on 18 March 2015 stated in relevant part:\n\nWhen the Flat Tax Agreement expired on 31 December [2013], Savan Vegas became subject to the applicable tax laws of Laos. It is common ground that although Savan Vegas has continued to do business in Laos, it has not paid taxes either directly or in escrow since 1 January [2014]. While it now offers to pay in escrow the sum of US $429,300 per month retroactive to 1 January [2014], there is no obligation on the Government to agree to such a figure or to any escrow arrangement.129\n\n\u2026\n\n... [F]or so long as the Claimant continues to do business in Laos, it can reasonably expect to be bound by the Laotian income tax laws applicable to gambling casinos unless and until a new Flat Tax Agreement is negotiated.130\n\nDecision on Claimant\u2019s Second Application for Provisional Measures, dated 18 March 2015, para. 32.\n\n*Ibid*, para. 34.\n\n186.\n\nAt some point, the Claimants\u2019 tax liability will have to be assessed and paid. Accordingly, while the Tribunal considers that the Government departed from its obligations under Section 7, the breach in this instance is not material because there is an accumulating tax debt owed by the Claimants, and any recalculation of the precise amount of tax owing does not in any sense rob the Claimants of the substantial benefit of their Section 7 bargain. This ground offers no independent basis for a revival of the Treaty arbitration.\n\n**iv. Did the Government\u2019s Failure to Establish a Joint Escrow Account to Receive the Proceeds of Sale of the Gaming Assets Constitute a Material Breach of Section 15 of the Settlement?**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**(a) The Claimants\u2019 Position**\n-------------------------------\n\n187.\n\nUnder the terms of Section 15, the proceeds of the sale of the Gaming Assets were to be received **directly** from the buyer [Macau Legend] \"into an escrow account... under instructions to be jointly issued by the Claimants and Laos.\"131\n\nSection 15 provides:  \n 15. All Sale proceeds shall be received directly from the buyer into an escrow account at TMF Trustees Singapore Limited in Singapore under instructions to be jointly issued by the Claimants and Laos. No moneys shall be withdrawn from such escrow account except in compliance with this document. The Claimants and Savan Vegas (in the case of assets sale rather than corporate sale) shall have no liability to pay any withholding or capital gains taxes in respect of the Sale.\n\n188.\n\nIn the Second Material Breach Application, the Claimants argue that the Government breached Section 15 in at least two material ways:\n\n(a) The Government caused Macau Legend to deposit all of the sale proceeds into bank accounts wholly controlled, directly or indirectly, by the Government; and\n\n(b) The Government impermissibly diverted US $26,659,000 million of the $42 million purchase price into its own treasury in purported satisfaction of the Claimants\u2019 alleged tax liability.132 Such a unilateral \"taking\" was not permitted by the Settlement.\n\nMemorial, para. 141, Reply, paras. 19(e), 32.\n\n189.\n\nThis Section 15 breach is independent of whether or not the Gaming Assets were sold for maximum value. Rather, Section 15 is separate and apart from Section 13 and requires **all** proceeds, regardless of the amount, to be deposited directly into escrow.133\n\nReply, para. 30.\n\n**(b) The Government\u2019s Position**\n---------------------------------\n\n190.\n\nThe escrow account was established in consultation with the SIAC Tribunal. The Claimants were bound and determined to undermine the Settlement and giving them a veto over the payment of funds from a jointly controlled escrow account would have allowed them to create endless mischief and delay. The SIAC Tribunal in effect endorsed this view in its Award of 29 June 2017. In any event, the Claimants ultimately received their full financial entitlement under the order of the President of the SIAC Tribunal annexed to the Award of 29 June 2017. If there was a breach, therefore, it was not material.\n\n**(c) The Tribunal\u2019s Ruling**\n-----------------------------\n\n191.\n\nIn the course of the SIAC proceedings, the escrow procedure was modified. After ordering the parties to work together to establish the escrow account and issue \"joint instructions\",134 the SIAC Tribunal directed payment of the sale proceeds into an escrow account under the control of the President of the SIAC Tribunal. It is evident from the SIAC Award of 29 June 2017 that the Claimants continued to favour the sale of the Casino (albeit on different terms from those favoured by the Government) in their appearances before the SIAC Tribunal.) \"Interim\" arrangements for an escrow account were worked out in conjunction with the SIAC Tribunal. The President of the SIAC Tribunal signed a \"Tribunal Payment Notice\" attached to the SIAC Award of 29 June 2017 clearing the escrow account.\n\nC-1095, Order on Respondents\u2019 Request for Provisional Measures and Claimant\u2019s Motion for a Stay of Discovery and Motion Practice, SIAC, 6 January 2016, para. 10:  \n The Tribunal grants the request to the extent of requiring the parties to work together to establish the escrow account by 30 March 2016 and issue before that date joint instructions to TMF Trustees Singapore Limited for procedures for the receipt and disbursement of funds. The Tribunal cannot at this time, on this record, resolve the question of the amount to be deposited into escrow under the Deed. The Tribunal will examine the question anew if the parties do not submit the joint instruction by the date required (30 March 2016) or if either party submits a motivated request for interpretation of the Deed including a substantiated record of the positions taken by the parties and defining the dispute on interpretation to be resolved.\n\n192.\n\nThe escrow account as established accomplished its functional purpose. While its terms differed from the arrangements described in Section 15, the differences do not amount to a material breach. The Claimants have not established any loss or other damage flowing from the escrow arrangements.135\n\nThe Government contends that the Claimants\u2019 desire for \"joint\" control was to enable them to precipitate an impasse and roil any sale.\n\n193.\n\nAccordingly, the Tribunal declines to find a material breach of Section 15.\n\n**v. Did the Government\u2019s Failure to Include the Right to Extend the Savannakhet Airport Runway as Part of the Gaming Assets Constitute a Material Breach of Section 25?**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**(a) The Claimants\u2019 Position**\n-------------------------------\n\n194.\n\nThe Claimants contend that the right to expand the Savannakhet Airport was a key contributor to the potential value of the Casino. The Government, it says, falsely represented to prospective purchasers (in the RSE report) that expansion to accommodate Boeing 737 type aircraft was not feasible. However, the Government was obligated to do what was necessary to enable the Claimants (at their own expense) to extend the runway at Savannakhet Airport.136\n\nMemorial, para. 144, Reply, para. 19(g).\n\n**(b) The Government\u2019s Position**\n---------------------------------\n\n195.\n\nBoth parties acknowledge that there is not enough land at Savannakhet Airport to lengthen the runway sufficiently to accommodate the normal operations of a Boeing 737 size aircraft. At no time did the Government represent otherwise.\n\n196.\n\nMoreover, the Government gave no undertaking, express or implied, to expropriate private land for the benefit of a private developer.\n\n**(c) The Tribunal\u2019s Ruling**\n-----------------------------\n\n197.\n\nThe \"right\" asserted by the Claimants is found in Section 25 which reads in relevant part that:\n\nThe Claimants or a new owner of the Gaming Assets (the \"SV Owner\" as the case may be) shall have the right to make the necessary investment (free of all cost to Laos) to extend the existing runway at Savannakhet Airport sufficiently to accommodate planes up to Boeing 737 size...\n\n198.\n\nThe Claimants contend that \"if an expansion had not been feasible because the Government was unwilling to exercise its eminent domain powers or, alternatively, to allow jets to use the Airport with payload and range restrictions, there would have been no point to the Parties\u2019 inclusion of Section 25 in the Deed.\"137 However, there is no persuasive evidence in the Settlement documentation or elsewhere that the Government undertook either of these measures. The exercise of power of eminent domain is certainly not mentioned in the Settlement.\n\nMemorial, para. 145.\n\n199.\n\nIn the view of the Tribunal, this ground is without merit. The new owner of the Gaming Assets is free to make \"the necessary investment\" itself by acquiring land from the current owners if suitable terms can be worked out by private contracts.\n\n200.\n\nThere is no evidence to suggest any legal or regulatory restraint on the Casino owner\u2019s expenditure of private monies for this purpose. However, in the Tribunal\u2019s view, there is no obligation on the Government to facilitate such an acquisition of land belonging to other private owners for the private benefit of the Claimants or their successors.\n\n201.\n\nThe Tribunal concludes that there is therefore no material breach in connection with the extension of the Savannakhet Airport.\n\n**vi. Did the Government\u2019s Alleged Failure to Negotiate the Thakhaek Agreements \"in Good Faith\" Constitute a Material Breach of Section 22 of the Settlement?**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n202.\n\nThe Thakhaek Free Enterprise Zone is an area some distance from the Savan Vegas Hotel and Casino complex. The Claimants desired about 90 hectares for development \"completely separate from the provision for sale of the Gaming Assets.\"138 Such a potential development had been the subject of a Memorandum of Understanding with Savan Vegas dated 20 October 2010.\n\nReply, para. 36.\n\n203.\n\nA condition precedent to negotiations for the Thakhaek development was the payment of US $500,000 to the Government which was paid by the Claimants.139\n\nSection 22 provides as follows:  \n 22. Subject to the Claimants\u2019 payment of US $500,000 to Laos, the Parties will negotiate in good faith and conclude a land concession and project development agreement with respect to the 90 hectares of land at Thakhaet identified in the MOU signed on 20 October 2010 between Savan Vegas and Governor Khambhay Damlath of Khammouane Province, LAO PDR, on the basis that no gaming activities whatsoever will be allowed at or in connection with that 90 hectares site. The Claimants acknowledge and agree that: (i) there shall be no gaming license, sublicense or other grant of gaming rights issued by Laos at any time in respect of such 90 hectares site; (ii) any development of, at or pertaining to such 90 hectares site shall be in the form of commercial, non-gaming activities only; and (iii) the Claimants shall have no right to claim or receive any compensation from Laos in regard to the prohibition of gaming activities at such 90 hectares site. Fees and charges, if any, imposed in connection with the project at the 90 hectares site shall be commensurate with those charged in connection with any similar site or project in the Thakhaek Free Enterprise Zone.\n\n204.\n\nIn the course of negotiations, a dispute arose over the inclusion (or not) of a 16 hectares\u2019 portion of land fronting National Road 13. It emerged that the 16 hectares\u2019 parcel was privately owned.\n\n**(a) The Claimants\u2019 Position**\n-------------------------------\n\n205.\n\nThe Claimants assert that the 16 hectares parcel of private land with its highway frontage was critical to the success of the contemplated development. It was included in the parcel of 90 hectares as shown on a map attached to the said Memorandum of Understanding and referred to in a number of subsequent \"draft agreements.\" The Claimants then say the \"Government summarily rejected without explanation Claimants\u2019 proposal for an alternative concession arrangement that would compensate it for the loss of the 16 hectares.\"140\n\nMemorial, para. 157.\n\n**(b) The Government\u2019s Position**\n---------------------------------\n\n206.\n\nThe 16 hectares parcel is in private ownership and was not included in the 90 hectares contemplated for development. The original survey attached to the MOU showed about 105 acres, which included 15 acres in private ownership. The Government made no promise of land it did not own. Eventually, the Government offered the Claimants an alternative 90 acres in the same special Economic Zone, but the Claimants would not agree to develop the property themselves but suggested they would invite other investors to build within a type of \"Dubai Free Trade Zone.\" This was a role reversal which the Government considered to be a fundamental departure from Section 22...141\n\nAs explained by Government counsel:  \n... the parties went back and forth. The government offered, \"If you want another 90 hectares in a Special Economic Zone, we have lots of land in the Thakhaet region that\u2019s in a Special Economic Zone\", so they were making offers back and forth.  \n Then Mr. James wrote a letter, Mr. Menezes, and said, \"Our proposal is to create a Dubai Free Trade Zone in Thakhaet, which means the business we build, we won\u2019t build our own business, we\u2019ll turn it into a Free Trade Zone, so other investors can come until and build buildings and they won\u2019t have to pay tax.\"  \n So the government said, \"That\u2019s not acceptable, more than not acceptable\", and that was the end of negotiations. They refused to make another offer. (Hearing Transcript 3 July 2017, p. 200)\n\n**(c) The Tribunal\u2019s Ruling**\n-----------------------------\n\n207.\n\nIn the Tribunal\u2019s view, the Claimants have not established a land entitlement that includes the disputed 16 hectares, and there is no undertaking by the Government in Section 22 to use its powers of eminent domain to expropriate the existing private owners for the financial benefit of the Claimants. Refusal to expropriate private land for private gain of the Claimant does not constitute evidence of \"bad faith.\"\n\n208.\n\nMoreover, Section 22 does not oblige the Government to negotiate an alternative concession, especially when the Claimants\u2019 plan was to try to attract other developers rather than develop the property themselves.\n\n209.\n\nIn the view of the Tribunal, the Claimants\u2019 Section 22 argument is without merit.\n\n**vii. Did the Government\u2019s Failure to Discontinue Criminal Investigations Against the Claimants and their Principals Constitute a Material Breach of Section 23 and Section 27?**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n210.\n\nThe Government has made numerous allegations of criminality against the Claimants and their principals, in particular, John Baldwin and Shawn Scott, as outlined above.\n\n211.\n\nAs part of the Settlement, the parties agreed in Section 23 that:\n\nLaos shall discontinue the current criminal investigations against Sanum/Savan Vegas and its management or other personnel and shall not reinstate such investigations **provided that the terms****and conditions agreed herein are duly and fully implemented by the Claimants.** (emphasis added)\n\n212.\n\nSection 27 provided for mutual releases subject to similar conditions.142\n\nSection 27 provides:  \n The Claimants hereby wholly waive and release any and all claims whatsoever against Laos and all officials thereof and advisors, counsels and experts thereto related, and to forego the lodging of any dispute or claim against any of them, and shall ensure that each of the following persons - the direct and indirect shareholders, personnel, affiliates, subsidiaries and managers of the Claimants, John Baldwin and Shawn Scott - shall also wholly waive and release any and all claims whatsoever against Laos and all officials thereof and advisors, counsels and experts thereto related and forego the lodging of any dispute or claim against any of them. The Claimants shall fully indemnify Laos and all officials thereof and advisors, counsels and experts thereto in the event that any direct and indirect shareholders, personnel, affiliates, subsidiaries and managers of the Claimants, John Baldwin and Shawn Scott shall fail to provide such waiver and release. Laos hereby waives and releases any and all claims with respect to the matters addressed in the arbitrations against the Claimants, shareholders, officers and directors and the Gaming Assets companies. Notwithstanding the above, if the arbitrations suspended hereby, or either of them is or are revived or re-instated to any extent by either Party, then the releases and waivers provided herein shall be null and void and any and all claims previously made and facts asserted in the arbitration(s) are not waived and no liability of either party thereunder is waived or released.\n\n**(a) The Claimants\u2019 Position**\n-------------------------------\n\n213.\n\nThe Government is currently pursuing applications for third-party discovery pursuant to 28 U.S.C. s. 1782 before U.S. federal courts ostensibly in support of the same allegations of bribery that the Government had asserted in the criminal investigation and in the SIAC arbitration as a ground for terminating the 2007 Savan Vegas PDA.143\n\nMemorial, paras. 165-166.\n\n**(b) The Government\u2019s Position**\n---------------------------------\n\n214.\n\nThe agreement to discontinue current criminal investigations was expressly conditional on the Claimants \"duly and fully\" observing the \"terms and conditions agreed herein.\" The Claimants breached numerous \"terms and conditions.\" The Government was therefore entitled to revive the \"current criminal investigations.\"\n\n**(c) The Tribunal\u2019s Ruling**\n-----------------------------\n\n215.\n\nSection 23 is a limited undertaking by the Government restricted to \"current criminal investigations of offences\" known to the Government as of the date of Settlement (15 June 2014) and being investigated prior to the date of the Settlement.\n\n216.\n\nThe Government continues to pursue the benefits of the Settlement. In exchange for those benefits, a major consideration for the principals of LHNV and Sanum was the Government\u2019s agreement to discontinue the \"current criminal investigations.\"144 As a matter of New York law, as discussed previously, the Government is not entitled to resile from a major benefit of the Settlement on the basis of breaches by the Claimants (that predate the multiple affirmations by the Government) while at the same time affirming its determination to sell the Gaming Assets under the authority of the same Settlement. Nevertheless, the Government is currently pursuing evidence of criminality in the U.S. Federal Courts in Idaho and the North Mariana Island.145\n\nAs noted by the dissenting arbitrator in the SIAC Award of 29 June 2017, paras. 100, 101:  \nIf Claimant chose to perform the Deed by taking the Casino, selling it, and setting a Flat Tax reportedly consistent with the Deed, it cannot deny Respondents the benefit of Paragraph 23 of the Deed.  \n I cannot join the Majority in reaching a conclusion that, as the Majority acknowledges, would give only Laos the benefit of the bargain while depriving Sanum entirely of one of the few benefits of the Deed it was entitled to.\n\nC-933, Order Denying Application for Issuance of Subpoenas, in *re* Application of the Government of the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, Case 1:15-mc-00018 (D.N. Mar. I. Apr. 7, 2016), p. 18:  \n The Court is also particularly swayed by GOL\u2019s seeming disregard for the Deed of Settlement. In June 2014, GOL was apparently satisfied that Baldwin and other owners and managers at the Savan Vegas were not criminals. It agreed not to prosecute them as part of the settlement. Despite the failure of the settlement to actually resolve the issues facing the Savan Vegas, the parties agreed to be bound by its terms, including non-prosecution.\n\n217.\n\nThe Section 23 undertaking is limited. Section 23 does not cover acts of potential criminality that existed as of the date of the Settlement but were not known to the Government at that time, or were known but were not at the time of the Settlement the subject of a \"current criminal investigation.\" This means that the Settlement did not in any way (regardless of any material breach) impede the Government from launching a criminal investigation after the date of the Settlement into facts that pre-dated the Settlement provided there was no ongoing investigation at the time of the Settlement. Indeed, much of the alleged criminality now of concern to the Government were facts that predated the Settlement but became known to the Government only after the date of the Settlement, when the Government gained access to the books and records of the Claimants, including allegations that:\n\n(a) The Claimants induced Mr. Angus Noble to sign a **fraudulent** MOU purporting to offer to buy the Gaming Assets and **knowingly suborned false testimony** from Mr. Noble [by paying him] $10,000 per month for twenty-one (21) months;146\n\n(b) In late spring-early summer 2015, after the Settlement, Mr. Baldwin hatched a scheme to **bribe Government officials** in an attempt to recover control of Savan Vegas. The Government points to a draft consulting agreement with an unemployed security guard, Mr. Ben Gersten, disclosing (the Government says), the bribe that Mr. Baldwin was willing to pay to Government officials to permit Sanum to recover control of the Casino despite the Settlement;\n\n(c) The Government says it has discovered numerous **documented and uncontroverted acts of bribery and other illegality** uncovered **after** the Settlement was signed;\n\n(d) The Government says that it emerged after the Settlement that Mr. Baldwin authorized **a bribe** of $30,000 to obtain the original 2009 Savan Vegas Flat Tax Agreement, and paid various other **bribes** to have the Thanaleng slot club shut down, to **tamper with witnesses** in the court case with his former partner, ST, and to **obtain a lottery license** in Cambodia.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, \"the Government\u2019s efforts to construct a conspiracy theory out of innocuous and unremarkable facts - that the MOU was negotiated quickly, that it was based on a template from a prior deal, and that Mr. Nobel had other dealings with the Claimants\u2019 principals and one of their family members - prove nothing and require no further response. Reply, para. 86.\n\n218.\n\nThe Tribunal, of course, has no views on whether these more recent allegations by the Government are true or not. What is at issue under Section 23 in contrast, are acts of criminality that were known and were being \"currently\" investigated as of 15 June 2014.\n\n219.\n\nAs a matter of New York law, the Government was not entitled to disregard a major benefit of the Settlement to the Claimants or their principals involving their personal jeopardy on the basis of breaches of the Settlement by the Claimants while proceeding to sell the Casino under the authority of the same Settlement.\n\n220.\n\nAs to materiality, pursuit or renewal of the \"current criminal investigations\" clearly goes to the heart of the benefits promised to the Claimants in Section 23. Indeed revival of \"current criminal\" investigations deprives the Claimants of the **only** benefit promised the Claimants under Section 23.\n\n221.\n\nThe Government was not free to revive the \"current criminal investigations\" unless it had been willing to repudiate the Settlement, and had done so.\n\n222.\n\nHaving not done so, it was not open to the Government to deny the Claimants the major and significant benefit of Section 12 and on that account, as well, the Claimants are entitled to revival of the Treaty arbitration.\n\n**VII. CONCLUSION**\n-------------------\n\n223.\n\nThe Tribunal does not underestimate the Government\u2019s frustration with the intransigence of the Claimants\u2019 post-settlement conduct whose efforts from 4 July 2014 to June 2015 were clearly directed to undermining the Settlement and extricating themselves from its terms. Unfortunately for the Government, it wanted to retain the Settlement as much as the Claimants wanted to get rid of it. Faced with this dilemma, the Government chose to affirm the Settlement.\n\n**VIII. COSTS**\n---------------\n\n**(a) The Claimants\u2019 Position**\n-------------------------------\n\n224.\n\nThe Claimants claim costs if successful. If unsuccessful, the Claimants argue that the Government\u2019s claim for costs should be rejected because:\n\n(a) New York\u2019s highest court has explained that, unless clearly provided in the underlying contract, the American rule that parties are responsible for their own attorney\u2019s fees applies.

OVERVIEW**\n---------------\n\n1.\n\nMr. John Baldwin and Mr. Shawn Scott, two U.S. entrepreneurs who were experienced in a number of businesses including gambling facilities, became involved in casinos and slot machines in Laos in 2007. For this purpose, they caused two companies to be incorporated in Aruba, the Netherlands Antilles, Lao Holdings NV (\"**LHNV**\"), and a subsidiary Sanum Investments (\"**Sanum**\") in Macau (collectively referred to as \"**the Claimants**\"). Mr. Baldwin and Mr. Scott, using various corporate structures partnered with a Laotian conglomerate (\"**ST Holdings**\") in two casino projects and three slot machine clubs in Laos positioned near its border with Thailand. One of the casinos, the Savan Vegas Hotel and Casino (\"**Savan Vegas**\"), was built and operated successfully. The second casino, Paksong Vegas Casino (\"**Paksong Vegas**\"), was never built.\n\n2.\n\nWithin three years there was a falling out between the Claimants and their local partner. ST Holdings ceased cooperation with Sanum, initiated litigation against it and shut Sanum out of Thanaleng, the most profitable of the slot clubs. Mr. John Baldwin testified that ST Holdings was closely connected to leading politicians in the Respondent Government. He said that ST Holdings orchestrated a series of wrongful Government acts against LHNV which led to the result, designed by the Government, of driving LHNV out of Laos and appropriating for the Government the wealth created by the investment and expertise of Mr. Baldwin and his associated companies.\n\n3.\n\nThe Claimants initiated arbitrations by LHNV under the bilateral investment treaties between Laos and the Netherlands,1 and by Sanum pursuant to a similar investment treaty between Laos and Macau (now China).2 These arbitrations have consumed multiple proceedings and years of litigation. Eventually Sanum obtained an award against ST Holdings from the Singapore International Arbitration Centre (\"**SIAC**\") for over US $200 million. Sanum is not a claimant before this Tribunal, and the Tribunal does not purport to address its claims. However, much of the evidence of Mr. John Baldwin is related to both companies, and as he was the directing mind of both companies, and their principal witness, references will be made to Sanum from time to time (or collectively to \"**the Claimants**\" in the plural) as part of the background to the disposition of the LHNV claims. Moreover, counsel for the Claimant advised that it did not withdraw \"any factual allegations, as the **totality of the facts remain relevant to certain treaty breaches** for which the Claimants will seek relief.\"3\n\n*Agreement on Encouragement and Reciprocal Protection of Investments between Laos and the Kingdom of the Netherlands*, signed on 16 May 2003, in force since 1 May 2005.\n\n*Agreement between the Government of the People's Republic of China and the Government of The Lao People's Democratic Republic Concerning the Encouragement and Reciprocal Protection of Investments*, dated 31 January 1993, as amended on 10 April 2006.\n\nLetter dated 26 March 2018 from Claimant to the Tribunal.\n\n4.\n\nThe Respondent Government's position is that it has been dragged into a business dispute between private parties, the Claimants and ST Holdings for whose conduct it has no responsibility. In any event, the Government says, the Claimants' business efforts in Laos were characterized by bribery and corruption, and their claims ought to be dismissed because of the absence of \"clean hands\" as well as on the merits. The Claimants point out correctly, that the Government has failed to demonstrate any substantial pursuit of the officials who, in the Government's view, *took* the bribes.\n\n5.\n\nThe Tribunal concludes that the LHNV claims must be dismissed. The dispute grew out of a commercial fight between private businesses. The Respondent Government became involved in aspects of the dispute as a regulator of the gambling business in Laos, as a shareholder in Sanum, and through its responsibility for the administration of justice in Laos, but the Claimants have failed to establish the facts necessary to ground liability in international law under the BIT in those respects.\n\n6.\n\nThe Tribunal has carefully considered each element of LHNV's myriad Treaty claims, including the claim of expropriation of Thanaleng and the allegations of breaches of Articles 3(1), 3(2) and 4 with respect to Thanaleng, Savan Vegas and the slots clubs at Lao Bao and Ferry Terminal, and Article 3(4) of the BIT with respect to Savan Vegas, and concludes for the reasons that follow that there is no merit in any of the claims and allegations brought before this Tribunal.\n\n7.\n\nAt the same time, the Tribunal finds that the Respondent has not established bribery and corruption against the Claimants on \"clear and convincing evidence\". Nevertheless, the evidence of multiple financial transactions by Mr. John Baldwin with Madam Sengkeo, the Claimants' local consultant in Laos and conduit to Government officials, taken cumulatively, establishes gross financial impropriety to the lesser standard of a balance of probabilities in respect of some investments as well as bad faith. While the Government has not always behaved appropriately (as found by the Tribunal in the Second Material Breach Application), and politics undoubtedly played a role in the worsening relations between the Government and the Claimants, LHNV has failed to demonstrate any legitimate expectations or establish other violations of the BIT including fair and equitable treatment. The evidence of their principal witness and directing mind, Mr. John Baldwin is not consistent with much of the documentation and is not reliable. Payments on Mr. Baldwin's instructions to a key witness, Madam Sengkeo, to purchase her refusal to testify at the merits hearing, go to the root of the integrity of the arbitration.\n\n8.\n\nIn all instances LHNV has failed to meet its burden of proof.\n\n9.\n\nThe claims of LHNV are dismissed with costs.\n\n**2. PROCEDURAL HISTORY**\n-------------------------\n\n10.\n\nThe Tribunal has issued the following decisions during the proceeding: (i) Decision on Jurisdiction of 21 February 2014; (ii) Decision on the Merits on the First Material Breach of 10 June 2015, (iii) Decision on Costs of 5 November 2015 and (iv) Decision on the Second Material Breach of 15 December 2017 (\"**Decision on the Second Material Breach**\"). The full procedural history of this case is described in these decisions. These Decisions, and the Decision on the Second Material Breach, are an integral part of the Award and are appended hereto as follows: i) Decision on Jurisdiction of 21 February 2014 (**Annex A**); (ii) Decision on the Merits on the First Material Breach of 10 June 2015 (**Annex B**), (iii) Decision on Costs of 5 November 2015 (**Annex C**) and (iv) Decision on the Second Material Breach (**Annex D**).\n\n11.\n\nThe procedural details of this arbitration following the Decision on the Second Material Breach are summarized below.\n\n12.\n\nIn the Decision on the Second Material Breach, the Tribunal ruled as follows:\n\n227. The Second Material Breach Application is allowed.\n\n228. Pursuant to Section 32 of the Settlement, the Treaty arbitration is revived on the basis jointly and severally of the Government's breaches of:\n\n(a) Section 8, which promised a \"new flat tax\", but instead the Government imposed a 28% ad valorem tax on gross gaming revenues;\n\n(b) Section 23, which promised the Claimants relief from \"current criminal investigations\", which nevertheless have been revived.\n\n229. Both of these breaches constitute material breaches that deprived the Claimants of the intended benefits (or \"bargain\") promised by each of Section 8 and Section 23.\n\n230. Except as aforesaid, the grounds of revival relied on by the Claimants are rejected.\n\n231. The parties are instructed to confer and propose to the Tribunal a timetable for the renewed Treaty arbitration within 30 days of the date of this decision.\n\n232. A pre-hearing teleconference to resolve any outstanding issues will be held within 45 days of the date of this decision.\n\n233. The issue of costs of this application is reserved to be dealt with at the conclusion of the hearing on the merits.\n\n13.\n\nAs instructed by the Tribunal in its Decision on the Second Material Breach, on 14 January 2018, the Claimant LHNV [being the sole Claimant in the ICSID proceeding] submitted its proposal regarding the timetable and requested the Tribunal to hold the hearing on the merits for this case after the scheduled hearing of related but separate proceedings identified as *Lao Holdings N.V. v. Lao People's Democratic Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/16/2)/ *Sanum Investments Limited v. Lao People's Democratic Republic* (ICSID Case No. ADHOC/17/1) (the \"**BIT II Proceedings**\"). The Claimant also requested an in-person pre-hearing conference with the objective of exploring with the Tribunal how to proceed and for the Parties to receive any further instructions.\n\n14.\n\nOn 18 January 2018, the Respondent filed its response objecting to Claimant's proposal to schedule a hearing after the BIT II Proceedings. The Respondent requested that the Tribunal schedule the hearing in this case within sixteen weeks as to not further delay the proceeding. Further exchanges by the Parties on this matter were submitted by Claimant on 26 January 2018 and 16 February 2018 and by Respondent on 29 January 2018.\n\n15.\n\nOn 19 February 2018, having heard the Parties' positions, the Tribunal decided the date for the hearing on the merits. The Tribunal invited the Parties to confer on a schedule for the exchange of written submissions and other logistical matters.\n\n16.\n\nOn 2 March 2018, the Parties informed the Tribunal that they had been unable to reach an agreement on the scope and nature of the Tribunal's instructions from 19 February 2018. As a result, each Party sent its proposal separately for the Tribunal's consideration.\n\n17.\n\nOn 7 March 2018, the Tribunal decided to schedule a pre-hearing conference and provided the Parties the corresponding agenda of the items to be discussed in the pre-hearing conference. On 19 March 2018, the Claimant LHNV submitted its positions regarding the items in the agenda for the pre-hearing conference as well as a proposed procedural order. On 20 March 2018, the Respondent submitted its comments to Claimant's communication of 19 March 2018 and corresponding proposals. On 21 March 2018, the Tribunal held a pre-hearing organizational meeting with the Parties by teleconference.\n\n18.\n\nOn 26 March 2018, as discussed during the pre-hearing organizational meeting, the Claimant LHNV provided the list of claims for which it no longer would seek specific relief.\n\n19.\n\nOn 29 March 2019, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 10 on the organization of the hearing.\n\n20.\n\nOn 23 April 2018, the Tribunal, through the Secretary of the Tribunal, reminded Respondent of the deadline provided in Procedural Order No. 10 for it to inform whether the Respondent would withdraw any defences in light of Claimant's withdrawal of claims of 26 March 2018. On 24 April 2018, the Respondent confirmed that it maintained its defences.\n\n21.\n\nOn 15 May 2018, pursuant to paragraph 8 of Procedural Order No. 10, the Respondent filed an Application for Additional Evidence, together with an index of supporting documentation and Exhibits R-001-002, R-004, R-028-029, R-034-036, C-1053, and R-054-055 and three additional documents not identified for the record.\n\n22.\n\nOn 16 May 2018, each Party submitted the preliminary list of witnesses for cross-examination at the hearing.\n\n23.\n\nOn 30 May 2018, the Claimant filed its response to the Respondent's Application for Additional Evidence together with Exhibits C-1225 to C-1227, and Legal Authorities CL-379 to CL-389.\n\n24.\n\nBy letter of 31 May 2018, the Respondent requested the Tribunal to order the Claimant to inform it on the order of presentation of the witnesses to be examined at the scheduled hearing. Additionally, the Respondent requested the examination from Lao PDR *via* video-link of the following witnesses: Minister Kmabay Damlath, Dr. Sinlavong Khoutphaythoun, and Minister Chaleune Yiapaoheu.\n\n25.\n\nOn 6 June 2018, the Tribunal provided further instructions to the Parties regarding the submissions on the list of witnesses for cross-examination at the scheduled hearing. On 8 June 2018, the Claimant filed its response opposing the Respondent's request for the witnesses' video-link testimony, together with Exhibits C-1224, C-1235 and Legal Authority CL-390.\n\n26.\n\nOn 12 June 2018, the Centre informed the Parties that Ms. Catherine Kettlewell, ICSID Legal Counsel, would serve as Secretary of the Tribunal, replacing Ms. Anneliese Fleckenstein.\n\n27.\n\nOn 15 June 2018, the Respondent filed its reply to its Application for Additional Evidence. On this same date, the Claimant filed its objection to the Respondent's preliminary witness list, together with Exhibit C-1237.\n\n28.\n\nOn 22 June 2018, the Respondent filed its response to the Claimant's opposition to the examination of witnesses *via* video-link.\n\n29.\n\nOn 25 June 2018, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 11, on the Respondent's Application for Additional Evidence.\n\n30.\n\nOn 26 June 2018, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 12, on the Respondent's request for the examination of witnesses *via* video-link.\n\n31.\n\nOn 27 June 2018, the Respondent filed a request for clarification of Tribunal's Procedural Order No. 11. On this same date, it stated its agreement to the full consolidation of this proceeding with the Permanent Court of Arbitration (\"**PCA**\") proceeding *Sanum Investments Limited (People's Republic of China) v. the Government of the Lao People's Democratic Republic* \u2013 PCA Case No. 2013-13 (the \"**PCA Proceeding**\").\n\n32.\n\nOn 28 June 2018, the Tribunal issued an amended Procedural Order No. 11, correcting certain typographical errors.\n\n33.\n\nBy letter of 28 June 2018, the Tribunal informed the Parties that the Claimant's request objecting to the Respondent's witness list was approved and invited the Parties to submit their final witness lists.\n\n34.\n\nOn 5 July 2018, the Tribunal addressed the Respondent's communication of 27 June 2018, concerning the full consolidation of this proceeding with the PCA Proceeding. The Tribunal informed the Parties that it did not consider the consolidation as \"practical or necessary at this late stage of the proceeding\".\n\n35.\n\nOn 6 July 2018, each Party submitted its final witness lists. The Claimant excluded one witness in accordance with the Tribunal's decision contained in its letter of 28 June 2018.\n\n36.\n\nOn 9 July 2018, the Parties jointly requested the Tribunal for a one-day extension for the further deadlines in the organization of the hearing. On 11 July 2018, the Tribunal took note of the Parties' agreed extensions.\n\n37.\n\nOn 17 July 2018, the Claimant submitted a request for additional evidence to rebut the Respondent's additional evidence pursuant to the Tribunal's Procedural Order No. 11.\n\n38.\n\nOn 18 July 2018, the Claimant submitted a request to substitute Dr. Thomas Zitt for Mr. Steven Rittvo for examination on the Innovation Group's Expert Report at the scheduled hearing, together with Exhibit C-1267 and Exhibits A to F. On the same date, the Respondent submitted its objection to the Claimant's request together with Exhibits 1 through 12. On 19 July 2018, the Tribunal invited the Claimant to submit its comments to the Respondent's objection. On 25 July 2018, the Claimant filed its response to the Respondent's objection of 24 July 2018, together with Exhibits G through L.\n\n39.\n\nOn 25 July 2018, the Respondent filed its observations to the Claimant's request for additional evidence of 17 July 2018. The Claimant's filed its reply on support of its request on 26 July 2018.\n\n40.\n\nOn 26 July 2018, the Respondent filed additional observations to the Claimant's request for the substitution of experts of 18 July 2018.\n\n41.\n\nOn 31 July 2018, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 13, deciding that the scheduled hearing would proceed on all issues except for damages and quantum and ruled on the Claimant's request for the substitution of experts to give testimony at the hearing. Simultaneously, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 14 on the Claimant's request for additional evidence as follows:\n\n\"1. The following documents submitted by the Claimants are admitted on consent:\n\nExhibits R-049, C-1240, R-046, C-1241, C-1242, C-0928, C-1243, C-1131, C-1244, C-1245, C-1246, C-774, C-755, C-1226, C-1248, C-1249, C-1250, C-1251, R-026, C-1238 A, C-1238 B, C-1239, C-1256, C-1257, C-1258, C-1259, C-1260, C-1261, C-1262, C-1263, C-1264, C-1265, C-1266.\n\n2. The Tribunal admits the extracts of the Witness statements of John Baldwin, Angus Noble, William Greenlee and Clay Crawford submitted by the Claimants, but permits the Government to provide additional extracts from the same witness statements which the Government contends are necessary to give \"balance\" to the extracts submitted by the Claimants, as per the ruling in item 1 above.\n\n3. The Baldwin Statement (Exhibit C-1244) and the Kurlantzick Report (Exhibit C-1247) are not admitted into evidence.\n\n4. The Government's Opening Memorial in SIAC Arb 143/14/MV (Exhibit C-971) is admitted into evidence.\n\n5. The interlocutory correspondence in ICSID Case No ARB (AF)/16/2 (Exhibits C-1252, C-1253, C-1254 and C-1255) are not admitted into evidence.\n\n6. The admissibility of the further report of Professor Joseph Kalt is deferred pending a decision following the merits hearing as to whether a hearing on damages and quantum is required.\"\n\n42.\n\nOn 10 August 2018, the Respondent filed a request to strike the witness statement of Mr. William Greenlee, together with Appendices 1 through 4. By communication of the same date, the Respondent requested leave from the Tribunal to include new evidence into the record (Exhibit LHRE-164 and LHRE-165).\n\n43.\n\nOn 17 August 2018, the Claimant filed its response opposing the Respondent's request to strike Mr. Greenlee's witness statement from the record, together with the following supporting documentation: Exhibit C(B)-434, C(B)-492, C-1242, R-001 and R-036. On the same date, the Claimant filed its observations, partially agreeing with the Respondent's request to include new evidence into the record. On 20 August 2018, the Tribunal invited the Respondent to comment on the Claimant's observations.\n\n44.\n\nOn 20 August 2018, the Claimant filed a request to increase their examination time at the hearing and sent a proposed hearing schedule for the Tribunal's consideration. On 22 August 2018, the Tribunal invited the Respondent to comment on Claimant's proposal.\n\n45.\n\nOn 23 August 2018, the Respondent filed a reply to the Claimant's response concerning its request to strike Mr. Greenlee's witness statement and its observations to the Claimant's position towards its request to include new evidence into the record. This submission was filed together with Appendices 1 through 5.\n\n46.\n\nOn this same date, the Claimant submitted additional observations to the Respondent's comments on Mr. Greenlee's witness statement and requested the Tribunal to strike from the record an exhibit of 291 pages filed by the Respondent together with BDO's expert report as part of the Respondent's additional evidence submitted pursuant to Procedural Order No. 11. The Tribunal invited the Respondent to comment on these two submissions by the Claimant.\n\n47.\n\nOn 23 August 2018, the Respondent submitted its opposition to the Claimant's request for an enlargement of the examination time, together with Appendices 1 through 3.\n\n48.\n\nOn 24 August 2018, the Respondent filed its observations on the Claimant's objection to the introduction of the exhibit to BDO's expert report, and its rejoinder on Mr. Greenlee's witness statement.\n\n49.\n\nOn the same date, the Claimant informed the Tribunal and the Respondent of its decision to withdraw their request to cross-examine Sivath Sengdouangchanh at the hearing.\n\n50.\n\nOn 25 August 2018, the Claimant requested the Tribunal's clarification on paragraph 3.ii of Procedural Order No. 10, concerning the witnesses' examination. On 26 August 2018, the Respondent filed its observations to this request.\n\n51.\n\nOn 28 August 2018, the Respondent withdrew the witness statement of Mr. Vanheung (Vanheuang) Nanthachak from the record.\n\n52.\n\nOn 29 August 2018, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 15, on (1) Respondent's request to strike from the record Mr. William Greenlee's witness statements; (2) Respondent's request to introduce exhibits LHRE-164 and LHRE-165; (3) Claimant's request to extend the time assigned at the hearing; (4) Claimant's request to exclude the BDO Report submitted by the Respondent, and (5) Claimant's request for advance notice for witness examination. These issues were decided as follows:\n\n\"1. The Respondent's request to strike from the record Mr. William Greenlee's witness statements is premature.\n\n2. Exhibits LHRE-164 and LHRE-165 are to be admitted into evidence.\n\n3 Each party shall have equal time and is to determine the order in which its own cross-examinations proceed as well as time allocation.\n\n4. The Claimants' request to exclude from the record the 291 additional pages attached to the BDO Report contained in Exhibit LHRE-161 is granted.\n\n5. The Parties are not required to provide advance notice of topics to be covered in cross-examination.\"\n\n53.\n\nBy letter of the same date, the Tribunal requested the Parties to confer and provide to the Tribunal a final hearing schedule.\n\n54.\n\nOn 30 August 2018, the Claimant submitted the Parties' final and agreed hearing schedule.\n\n55.\n\nA hearing on the merits was held at Maxwell Chambers in Singapore, from 3 to 7 September 2018 (the \"**Hearing**\").

On 12 March 2019, the Tribunal invited the Parties to comment on the other Party's submission on costs, if they wished to do so. On 15 March 2019, the Respondent submitted its comments to Claimant's submission on costs.\n\n62.\n\nOn 2 May 2019, the Tribunal requested the Parties to confirm the Tribunal's understanding that the Award shall be deemed to be made at the place of arbitration, irrespective of where it is signed. Both Parties confirmed the Tribunal's understanding on 6 May 2019.\n\n63.\n\nThe proceeding was closed on 17 July 2019.\n\n**3. OVERVIEW OF THE FACTS**\n----------------------------\n\n**3.1. Laos: Claimants' Investments in Laos**\n---------------------------------------------\n\n64.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, the Claimant, LHNV, owned directly and indirectly through its subsidiary, Sanum, gambling assets in Laos including the Savan Vegas Hotel and Casino Complex in Savannakhet Province. The Casino is strategically located near the Friendship Bridge which spans the Mekong River between Laos and Thailand. The Claimants also had an investment in \"slot clubs\" located at the Thai border at Lao Bao and Savannakhet Ferry Terminal (located at the Savannakhet/Mukdahan checkpoint), all in the Savannakhet Province and at Thanaleng to the Northwest. LHNV and its subsidiary Sanum, claim to have invested many millions of dollars in these projects.4\n\nThe Claimants' principal, Mr. John Baldwin, testified as follows:  \nQ. \u2026 Can you tell us when Sanum first invested in Laos and what kind of money it invested, at what time period?  \nA. We \u2013 we started investing in Laos in 2007. Our initial commitment was a total of seven and a half million dollars \u2013 my recollection is seven and a half million dollars paid to ST Group in various stages, and then the next thing we invested in was getting new plans drawn and studies done for Savan Vegas and Paksong Vegas.  \nQ. And in what year was that done?  \nA. That was done in 2008 primarily.  \nQ. When was the first monies paid? 2007 or 2008?  \nA. First monies, 2007.  \nQ. And then the money that was in 2008, can you say during roughly what month?  \nA. Well, the largest amount of money was paid prior to the Savan \u2013 was paid in probably the last six months of 2008.  \nQ. During all of that time in 2007 and 2008, did you have a flat tax agreement yet?  \nA. Yes.  \nQ. Prior \u2013 let me show you some documents. Let me show you \u2013  \nA. Well, we had an agreement to get the flat tax agreement. The flat tax was approved \u2013 the flat tax was approved by Prime Minister Bouasone in [29 December 2008].  \nTranscript, 5 September 2018, p. 134, l. 10 to p. 135, l. 12, date corrected p. 135, ll. 9-12.\n\n**3.2. The Original Treaty Claims**\n-----------------------------------\n\n65.\n\nThe Claimants allege expropriation without compensation and Treaty breaches in respect of their investment in gambling projects described in the Project Development Agreement (\"**PDA**\") dated 10 August 2007 in respect of the Savan Vegas Casino, as well as the three slot clubs, Thanaleng, Lao Bao and Savannakhet Ferry. The claims also relate to the expected expansion of the Savannakhet Airport and opportunities for development in the Special Economic Zone at Thakhet.\n\n66.\n\nLHNV initiated its ICSID proceedings on 14 August 2012 against the Respondent, before the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (\"**ICSID**\" or the \"**Centre**\") pursuant to the *Agreement on Encouragement and Reciprocal Protection of Investments between Laos and the Kingdom of the Netherlands*,5 and the *Arbitration Rules (Additional Facility)* of ICSID (\"**ICSID-AF Rules**\").6\n\nSigned on 16 May 2003, in force since 1 May 2005.\n\nAs amended on 10 April 2006.\n\n67.\n\nOn 14 August 2012, Sanum Investments Limited, a LHNV subsidiary which operated the Savan Vegas Hotel and Casino, initiated its claim before the PCA for alleged violations of the *Agreement between the Government of the People's Republic of China and the Government of The Lao People's Democratic Republic Concerning the Encouragement and Reciprocal Protection of Investments,* dated 31 January 1993 and the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules as revised in 2010.\n\n68.\n\nWhile the proceedings before the two Tribunals are distinct and separate, the proceedings were the subject of joint Hearings in Singapore and elsewhere. Accordingly, for ease of reference only, LHNV and Sanum will be referred to as \"the Claimants\", as the facts of the cases are intermingled. This terminology is not to suggest, however, that the two arbitral proceedings are consolidated or otherwise conjoined.\n\n**3.3. Claims and Counterclaims**\n---------------------------------\n\n69.\n\nThe Claimants' original Treaty claims were based on a multiplicity of alleged treaty breaches by the Government including (but not limited to) an 80% tax on casino revenues and what the Claimants contended were unfair and oppressive audits of the Savan Vegas Hotel and Casino. In addition, the Claimants alleged that the Government abused its sovereign authority to assist ST Holdings to acquire other assets which belonged in whole or in part, to the Claimants. In the Treaty proceedings, the Claimants eventually valued their investment loss as of 31 August 2016 at between US $690 million and US $1 billion.7\n\nSee Reports of Joseph P. Kalt dated 14 October 2016, 2 December 2016, 22 December 2016 and 15 March 2017.\n\n**3.4. The Settlement and its Aftermath**\n-----------------------------------------\n\n70.\n\nThe Treaty claims were thought to have been resolved by a Deed of Settlement concluded between the Parties during the merits Hearing in Singapore on 15 June 2014 (to be read together with a Side Letter dated 18 June 2014) (herein referred to collectively as \"**the Settlement**\").\n\n71.\n\nShortly after the Settlement, the Claimants alleged that the Government had committed a material breach of its terms, which entitled them to a revival of the Treaty arbitrations (\"**the First Material Breach Application**\"). The Government contested jurisdiction. On 11 August 2014, the Government filed a Notice of Arbitration with the SIAC pursuant to paragraphs 35 and 42 of the Settlement, seeking an order directing Sanum to comply with its obligations under the Settlement.\n\n72.\n\nThe ICSID and PCA Tribunals held a hearing on 14 October 2014 in Washington, D.C. on the objections to jurisdiction, which were dismissed. However, on 20 January 2015, the High Court of the Republic of Singapore held that the PCA Tribunal did not possess subject matter jurisdiction under the Laos-China BIT because of the status of Macau and issues of state succession not here relevant, as well as the limitation in the BIT, according to which \"only disputes over the amount of compensation for expropriation can be submitted to arbitration.\"8 The First Material Breach Application was dismissed on the merits by the ICSID Tribunal on 10 June 2015. Subsequently, the judgment of the Singapore High Court was reversed by the Court of Appeal of Singapore on 29 September 2016.9\n\n*Government of the Lao People's Democratic Republic v. Sanum Investments Ltd.*, [2015] SGHC 15 at para. 128.\n\n*Sanum Investments Ltd. v. Government of the Lao People's Democratic Republic*, [2016] SGCA 57.\n\n**3.5. Delimitation of the Relief Presently Sought by the Claimants**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n73.\n\nThe Claimants' Second Material Breach Application was successful, and on 15 December 2017, the Hearing on the merits of the \"revived\" claim was ordered to proceed. On 26 March 2018, the Claimants advised the Tribunal that they no longer sought relief in respect of \"Article 6 expropriation claim regarding the [Savan Vegas], its Article 6 expropriation claim regarding Ferry Terminal or Lao Bao slot clubs [\u2026], or its claims regarding Respondent's seizure of its bank account in breach of Articles 3(2), 3(4), 4, 5, and 6.\"10\n\nLetter dated 26 March 2018 from Claimant to the Tribunal.\n\n74.\n\nThe Claimants' letter of 26 March 2018 notionally divided and separated their surviving claims concerning LHNV (Thanaleng, Savan Vegas and the Ferry Terminal and Lao Bao slots) and Sanum (Thanaleng, Paksan, Thakhet and Paksong Vegas Hotel and Casino). As mentioned, however, counsel for the Claimants asserted in the same letter that \"the totality of the facts remain relevant to certain treaty breaches for which the Claimants will seek relief.\" Equally, the Respondent conjoined its \"clean hands\" defence to all claims by both Claimants at issue in the ICSID and PCA proceedings involving Mr. John Baldwin and the various interrelated allegations of bribery and corruption. Accordingly, it will be necessary for the Tribunal to address \"the totality\" of the factual circumstances of the listed projects of both Claimants insofar as they are relevant to the position of LHNV.\n\n75.\n\nThe Claimant maintained the expropriation claim pursuant to Article 6 of the Treaty as well as the following Treaty claims:\n\n(a) denial of fair and equitable treatment and prohibitions on impairment by unreasonable and discriminatory measures in respect of Savan Vegas, Thakhet, Paksan, Thanaleng, Ferry Terminal and Lao Bao (Article 3(1) of the Treaty);\n\n(b) breach of contractual obligations regarding Savan Vegas and Paksong Hotel and Casino (Article 3(4) of the Treaty);\n\n(c) national treatment regarding Savan Vegas, Lao Bao and Ferry Terminal (Articles 3(2) and 4 of the Treaty);\n\n(d) Most Favoured Nation claims regarding Savan Vegas, Thanaleng, Ferry Terminal and Lao Bao concerning full protection and security, most constant protection and security and access to justice (Article 3(2) of the Treaty).\n\n**4. RELEVANT ARTICLES OF THE BIT**\n-----------------------------------\n\n**4.1. The Recitals**\n---------------------\n\n76.\n\nThe Preamble to the Treaty provides, in its relevant part:\n\nDesiring to strengthen their traditional ties of friendship and to extend and intensify the economic relations between them, particularly with respect to investments by the nationals of one Contracting Party in the territory of the other Contracting Party, recognizing that agreement upon the treatment to be accorded to such investments will stimulate the flow of capital and technology and the economic development of the Contracting Parties and that fair and equitable treatment of investment is desirable.\n\n77.\n\nArticle 2 of the Treaty provides:\n\nEither Contracting Party shall, within the framework of its laws and regulations, promote economic cooperation through the protection in its territory of investments of nationals of the other Contracting Party. Subject to its rights to exercise powers conferred by its laws or regulations, each Contracting Party shall admit such investments.\n\n78.\n\nArticle 3(1), 3(2), 3(4), and 3(5) of the Treaty, in its relevant part, provide:\n\n1) Each Contracting Party shall ensure **fair and equitable treatment** of the investments of nationals of the other Contracting Party and shall not impair by **unreasonable or discriminatory measures**, the operation, management, maintenance, use, enjoyment or disposal thereof by those nationals. Each Contracting Party shall accord to such investments **full physical security and protection**.\n\n2) More particularly, each Contracting Party shall accord to such investments treatment which in any case shall **not be less favourable** than that accorded either to investments of its own nationals or to investments of nationals of any third State, whichever is more favourable to the national concerned.\n\n3) \u2026\n\n4) Each Contracting Party shall **observe any obligation it may have entered into** with regard to investments of nationals of the Other Contracting Party.\n\n5) If the provisions of law of either Contracting party or obligations under international law existing at present or established hereafter between the Contracting Parties in addition to the present Agreement contain a regulation, whether general or specific, entitling investments by nationals of the other Contracting Party to a treatment **more favourable** than is provided for by the present Agreement, **such regulation shall, to the extent that it is more favourable, prevail over the present Agreement***.*\n\n(emphasis added)\n\n79.\n\nArticle 4 of the Treaty provides:\n\nWith respect to taxes, fees, charges and to fiscal deductions and exemptions, each Contracting Party shall accord to nationals of the other Contracting Party who are engaged in any economic activity in its territory, treatment **not less favourable** than that accorded to its own nationals or to those of any third State who are in the same circumstances, whichever is more favourable to the nationals concerned. For this purpose, however, any special fiscal advantages accorded by that Party, shall not be taken into account:\n\n(a) under an agreement for the avoidance of double taxation; or\n\n(b) by virtue of its participation in a customs union, economic union or similar institution; or\n\n(c) on the basis of reciprocity with a third State.\n\n(emphasis added)\n\n80.\n\nArticle 6 of the Treaty provides:\n\nNeither Contracting Party shall take any measures **depriving, directly or indirectly**, nationals of the other Contracting Party of **their investments** unless the following conditions are complied with:\n\n(a) the measures are taken in the **public interest** and under **due process** of law;\n\n(b) the measures are **not discriminatory** or contrary to any undertaking which the Contracting Party which takes such measures may have given;\n\n(c) the measures are taken against **just compensation**. Such compensation shall represent the genuine value of the investments affected, shall include interest at a normal commercial rate until the date of payment and shall, in order to be effective for the claimants, be paid and made transferable, without delay, to the country designated by the claimants concerned and in the currency of the country of which the claimants are nationals or in any freely convertible currency accepted by the claimants.\n\n(emphasis added)\n\n81.\n\nArticle 9 of the Treaty provides:\n\nEach Contracting Party hereby consents to submit any legal dispute arising between that Contracting Party and a national of the other Contracting Party concerning an investment of that national in the territory of the former Contracting Party to the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes for settlement by conciliation or arbitration under the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of other States, opened for signature at Washington on 18 March 1965, in the event that both Contracting Parties have become Contracting States to the said Convention. In case a Contracting Party is not a Contracting State to the said Convention, the disputes referred to above shall be submitted to the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes under the Rules Governing the Additional Facility for the Administration of Proceedings by the Secretariat of the Centre (Additional Facility Rules). A legal person which is a national of one Contracting Party and which before such a dispute arises is controlled by nationals of the other Contracting Party shall, in accordance with Article 25 (2) (b) of the Convention, for the purpose of the Convention be treated as a national of the other Contracting Party.\n\n**5. OTHER MATTERS**\n--------------------\n\n**5.5. Other Legal Provisions**\n-------------------------------\n\n82.\n\nThe Respondent argues that, in addition to the BIT, domestic law is relevant to the existence of the Claimants' contractual rights and the legality of the conduct of the foreign investors. Furthermore, there are international norms such as \"[t]he United Nations Convention Against Corruption which defines bribery and money laundering as fundamental criminal offenses that undermine the international system of foreign trade.\"11 It is the contention of the Respondent that the Claimants violated the BIT, the laws of Laos and international norms.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, para. 20.\n\n83.\n\nAccording to the Claimant LHNV's Reply, the \"[BIT] clearly governs this dispute.\"12 The United Nations Convention Against Corruption (\"**UNCAC**\") \"creates obligations only for the state Parties, to develop anti-corruption policies, practices, and task forces. It does not bind or purport to bind the conduct of entities such as the Claimant.\"13 The Claimants also question the Respondent's appeal to international public policy and, in particular, the international standard for the gaming industry based on domestic gaming regulations of just four jurisdictions, none of them applicable to the Claimants' projects in Laos.\n\nClaimant's Reply and Opposition to Respondent's Counterclaims dated 9 May 2014 (hereinafter \"**Claimant's Reply**\"), para. -237.\n\n*Ibid*.\n\n84.\n\nWhile the Claimants admit that domestic statutes obviously do determine whether certain alleged acts are legal or illegal for the purposes of domestic law, domestic law does not dictate the consequences for an investor's claims under the Treaty.\n\n85.\n\nThe Claimants argue that \"once an investor has established its investment in conformity with the host state's laws, that investment falls within the scope of the treaty (assuming all of the other jurisdictional hurdles have been cleared), and the investor is *prima facie* entitled to its protections.\"14 The Claimants further argue that the cases that \"consider whether allegations of misconduct constitute a proper defence on the merits do not assist Laos because tribunals have required Respondents to demonstrate that the actions taken in breach of the treaty were actually justified by the misconduct.\"15\n\n*Ibid*., para. 246.\n\n*Ibid*., para. 249.\n\n86.\n\nThe Claimants also dispute the relevance of the \"uncontroversial proposition that arbitral tribunals have an inherent power to preserve the integrity of their own process \u2026\"16 The Claimants equally reject the applicability of the \"unclean hands\" doctrine and note that the Respondent has not cited any case in which a tribunal has sanctioned post-investment behavior with a full dismissal of the claimant's case.\n\n*Ibid*., para. 252.\n\n**5.2. Tribunal's Analysis**\n----------------------------\n\n87.\n\nThe law to be applied by the Tribunal is determined by the Treaty. The Treaty is an international instrument that to the extent it requires interpretation will be interpreted by the Tribunal in accordance with the provisions of the Vienna Convention on the Law of the Treaties (\"**VCLT**\") to which both State parties to the Treaty have acceded. As the Parties admit in their exchanges, the domestic law of the State may also be relevant. The extent of its relevance is a matter of dispute between the Parties, particularly on the question of whether to be protected an investment needs to be made *and operated* according to the law of the host State. This issue and the disputed applicability of international policy relate to the defence of illegal conduct and the Tribunal will address both matters as needed in its consideration of the Respondent's defence.\n\n**5.3. Clarification on the Nature of the Respondent's Illegality Claims**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n88.\n\nAs part of its defence, the Respondent has pleaded that the Tribunal should dismiss all claims because of the illegal activities in which the Claimants allegedly engaged, including bribery, embezzlement and money laundering. The Claimants have at times characterized this defence as a \"request for dismissal \u2026 for lack of jurisdiction\" because at inception or in its operation the investment of the Claimants was illegal.17\n\nClaimant's Reply, para. 13.\n\n89.\n\nAs the Tribunal understands it, the present submission of the Respondent to dismiss all claims on grounds of illegality is not an objection to the Tribunal's jurisdiction, but an affirmation of the Tribunal's jurisdiction to consider the claims on their merits which, the Government says, ought to be dismissed because of the Claimants' illegal conduct.\n\n**6. THE RESPONDENT'S THRESHOLD POSITION IS THAT THE CLAIMS OUGHT NOT TO BE ENTERTAINED BY REASON OF THE CLAIMANTS' BRIBERY AND CORRUPTION**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n90.\n\nAt the threshold of its argument, the Respondent contends that the claims should be dismissed in their entirety, in part because of corruption in the creation of the investments, and in part because of corruption in the course of performance of the various PDAs and unsuccessful initiatives by the Claimants to obtain licences for new gambling facilities.\n\n91.\n\nThe Respondent alleges that the principals behind the Claimants, Mr. John Baldwin and Mr. Sean Scott, were quite brazen about how to do business in a culture of corruption. However, Mr. Baldwin says, they steadfastly resisted. In this respect, Mr. Baldwin testified that:\n\nLaos can be quite a corrupt country \u2026 As I met fellow businessmen in Laos, I came to realize that almost every major business operating in Laos has paid money under the table for their concessions, or their flat tax agreements or other Government approvals. Sanum, however, has not.18\n\nJohn Baldwin Sixth Witness Statement (ICSID), dated 9 May 2014, para. 5.\n\n92.\n\nIn his re-examination at the Hearing, Mr. John Baldwin made an even more emphatic denial of corrupt activities: \"I gave strict instructions always that we weren't paying any bribes.\"19\n\nMr. Baldwin testified as follows in re-examination by his counsel:  \nQ. Mr. Branson asked you a number of questions about the contracts, the consulting contracts, that Mr. Bouker had that Marty Gersten had written up and you said you hadn't seen them, but now that you've seen them, do they cause you to believe that Mr. Bouker was being dispatched to go and bribe people?  \nA. No.  \nQ. And why is that?  \nA. Well, first and foremost, **I gave strict instructions always that we weren't paying any bribes**. That's number one. I just don't do it and I'm a stubborn guy and I just don't \u2013 I tell my staff the same thing always, you know, it's a slippery slope and you can't start down it, so that's number one. But number two is, you know, fair value [in terms of a success fee] for result for work given. I mean, if he [Mr. Bowker] has the contacts to do this, more power to him. (emphasis added)  \nAmended Transcript, 5 September 2018, p. 168, 8-19.\n\n93.\n\nThe allegations of bribery in the course of making the initial investment include:\n\n(a) an alleged bribe of US $30,000 to Laotian tax authorities to obtain approval of the original 2009 Flat Tax Agreement which the Claimants regarded as essential to their investment in their flagship Savan Vegas Hotel and Casino project;\n\n(b) payment of US $25,000 to Government officials to procure a licence for the Claimants' proposed Thakhaek Slot Club and Welcome Centre.20\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, paras. 10-11, 15-17.\n\n94.\n\nThe allegations of bribery in the course of performance of the PDAs and related initiatives include:\n\n(a) payment of US $875,000 to the Claimants' consultant in the Laos private sector, Madam Sengkeo Phimmasone, to bribe Government officials to stop an audit by Ernst & Young (\"**E&Y**\") of Savan Vegas in order to avoid disclosure of the Claimants' illegal activity21 and witness tampering (Madam Sengkeo Phimmasone refused to make herself available to testify in these proceedings. The Respondent alleges she was paid by the Claimants to stay away);\n\n(b) payment of bribes totalling US $ 21,000 in 2012 to Government officials in an effort to obtain an extension of the 2009 Flax Tax Agreement;22\n\n(c) offer of a US $7 million bribe to the Prime Minister of Laos for approval of a licence to establish a casino in the capital city of Vientiane;23\n\n(d) a bribe of US $80,000 to the Governor of the Province of Champasak to approve a slot club at Chong Mek;24\n\n(e) bribes totalling US $106,000 to Government officials to close the Paksan Slot Club as a way of bringing pressure on ST Holdings to settle their differences;25\n\n(f) a claim (now abandoned) of payment of unspecified amounts of bribes to Government officials stationed at Savan Vegas to turn a blind eye to unlawful gambling by Lao citizens;26\n\n(g) an allegation (now abandoned) of payment of unspecified amounts to Thai border officials to facilitate Thai gamblers crossing into Laos to gamble and return unhindered with their winnings;27 and\n\n(h) additional allegations (now abandoned) that the Claimants engaged in money laundering and embezzled funds from Savan Vegas by use of phoney loans.28\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, para. 73; Respondent's Rejoinder, para. 9(i) and (vii).\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, paras. 90-93; Respondent's Rejoinder, paras. 10,15, 19.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, para. 97.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, paras. 100-101; Respondent's Rejoinder, paras. 21-22.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, paras. 102-104.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, para. 110-113.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, paras. 114.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, paras. 115-199, 133, 135, 338.\n\n95.\n\nIn addition, the Respondent alleges that the Claimants paid US $120,000 to Cambodian officials for a Cambodian lottery licence, bribed Cambodian officials to obtain Cambodian diplomatic passports and bribed Cambodian customs officials to ignore unlawful border crossings. These allegations were designed to demonstrate that the principals of the Claimants are \"bad people\" with a predisposition to use bribery and corruption to advance their financial interests. The facts underlying the Cambodian allegations are so far removed from the allegations of corruption in Laos, that the allegations relating to Cambodia are irrelevant and will not be considered further.\n\n**6.1. Evidence of Bribery and Corruption is Relevant in Respect of Criminality Both at the Time of Investment and During Subsequent Performance**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n96.\n\nThe Parties agree that investment tribunals are rightly sensitive to allegations of corruption. They agree that the Respondent bears the burden of proof. They disagree on the standard of proof, *i.e.* whether a balance of probabilities is sufficient or whether corruption must be established to the more demanding standard of \"clear and convincing evidence\" of corruption. They also, of course, disagree on the facts.\n\n97.\n\nThere is no doubt that bribery and corruption are contrary to the domestic laws of Laos.29\n\n**Lao Penal Code**  \nArticle 157:  \nAny person bribing or agreeing to bribe a civil servant shall be punished by six months to two years of imprisonment and a fine equal to the amount or value of the bribe.  \nIn the event of a substantial bribe, the bribed civil servant, the briber and the person who agrees to give the bribe shall be punished by three to five years of imprisonment and fines equal to twice the amount or value of the bribe.  \nBribe intermediaries shall be punished by six months to two years of imprisonment and fines equal to the amount or value of the bribe.  \nLHRA-15.  \n**Lao Law on Investment Promotion**  \nArticle 73: Prohibited actions for investors:  \nInvestors are prohibited to perform the following actions:  \n1. Give bribes to officers and government officials who have responsibilities for concerned tasks;  \nLHRA-21 **.**\n\n**6.1.1. The Respondent's Argument**\n------------------------------------\n\n98.\n\nThe Respondent asserts that the Claimants are not legally entitled to maintain any of their claims in these proceedings as a matter of *ordre public international* and public policy.30 Corruption, the Respondent argues, is relevant to the initial investment but also to the investor's subsequent conduct in relation to the investment in the host country.31\n\n*World Duty Free Company Limited v.

Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela,* ICSID Case No. ARB/10/19, Award, 18 November 2014, at paras. 129-132.):  \n31. The approach to bribery is different in investment arbitrations, where jurisdiction does not derive from a contract, but rather from an investment treaty. In these cases, validity of contracts is not the question. The issue is whether an investor who has incurred in corrupt practices when making or performing the investment can still enjoy protection under the relevant investment treaty. And the answer is no. (38) Investment arbitration has initiated and led the movement of zero tolerance towards corruption.\n\n99.\n\nThe difference is that corruption in the making of the investment will raise issues of jurisdiction for the Tribunal, whereas subsequent acts of corruption will go to a claimant's entitlement for relief under the BIT.32\n\n*Fraport AG Frankfurt Airport Services Worldwide v. Republic of the Philippines*, ICSID Case No. ARB/03/25, at para. 345, LHRA-29:\n\n100.\n\nIn particular, the Respondent relies on the analysis in *Metal-Tech v. Uzbekistan* :\n\nWhile reaching the conclusion that the claims are barred as a result of corruption, the Tribunal is sensitive to the ongoing debate that findings on corruption often come down heavily on claimants, while possibly exonerating defendants that may have themselves been involved in the corrupt acts. It is true that the outcome in cases of corruption often appears unsatisfactory because, at first sight at least, it seems to give an unfair advantage to the defendant party. The idea, however, is not to punish one party at the cost of the other, but rather to ensure the promotion of the rule of law, which entails that a court or tribunal cannot grant assistance to a party that has engaged in a corrupt act.33 (emphasis added)\n\nRespondent's Opening Submission, Slide 143, citing *Metal-Tech Ltd. v. Republic of Uzbekistan,* ICSID Case No. ARB/10/3, Award, 4 October 2013, at para. 389, Exhibit LHRA-157.\n\n101.\n\nThe Respondent also relies, more generally, on the doctrine of \"clean hands\". The Claimants' misconduct is sufficient, it is said, to deny them the assistance of investor-state arbitration.\n\n**6.1.2. The Claimant's Argument**\n----------------------------------\n\n102.\n\nThe Claimants point out that the Tribunal's jurisdiction is founded on the BIT and neither the Netherlands nor the Chinese BIT contains a provision authorizing a tribunal to deny the treaty's protection on the basis that the claimant/investor engaged in corruption. If the BITs provide no authority to dismiss, the Tribunal would have to base its decision on customary international law. However, the lack of \"clean hands\" is neither a recognized rule of customary international law nor a general principle of international law and thus affords no authority to dismiss.34\n\nCiting *Yukos Universal Limited (Isle of Man) v. The Russian Federation*, UNCITRAL PCA Case No. AA 227, Award, 18 July 2014, at paras. 1362-1363, CLA(B)-395.\n\n103.\n\nThe Claimants acknowledge that corruption in **the establishment of an investment** can render a claim inadmissible because treaty protections are only available for valid investments recognized under the treaty (based upon either an explicit or implied legality requirement).35 The Claimants deny corruption but in any event deny any causal connection between the acts of *alleged* corruption and these claims. The Respondent only concocted its corruption allegations **after** the arbitrations were commenced and in any event has failed to govern itself in a manner consistent with its international obligations, including due process and good faith, and the prosecution of bribe-takers as well as alleged bribe-givers.36\n\nClaimant's Closing Submission, Slide 3.\n\nClaimant's Opening Submission on Respondent's Corruption Allegations, Slide 4.\n\n104.\n\nThe Claimants' principal, Mr. John Baldwin, denied the applicability of the \"red flags\" approach to the investments in issue here:\n\nQ. Is it possible that when you enter into a consulting contract like this, that if the event is achieved, the consultant is sent the money and the consultant then is instructed to pay it to certain government ministers so that it keeps the company one step removed from proof of the bribe? Isn't that how it works, Mr. Baldwin?\n\nA. That's a possibility, although it didn't happen here.37\n\nAmended Transcript, 5 September 2018, p. 91, 16-25.\n\n**6.1.3. The Tribunal's Ruling**\n--------------------------------\n\n105.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that proof of corruption at any stage of the investment may be relevant depending on the circumstances. While the UNCAC applies to States rather than private parties, it embodies what has become a principle of customary international law applicable, according to the OECD, to root out corruption used \"to **obtain** or **retain business** or other undue advantage **in relation to the conduct** of international business.\"38\n\n*UN Convention Against Corruptio* n, Article 16(1), LHRA-16. See also *OECD Convention on Combating Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in International Business Transactions*, Article 1(1), Exhibit LHRA-136:  \nEach Party shall take such measures as may be necessary to establish that it is a criminal offence under its law for any person intentionally to offer, promise or give any undue pecuniary or other advantage, whether directly or through intermediaries, to a foreign public official, for that official or for a third party, in order that the official act or refrain from acting in relation to the performance of official duties, in order to obtain or retain business or other improper advantage in the conduct of international business. (emphasis added).  \nSee also ICC Dossier: *Addressing Issues of Corruption in Commercial and Investment Arbitration*, Chapter 11, at para. 34, Exhibit LHRA-155:  \nIt is now undisputed that a finding of corruption when making or performing an investment will lead to dismissal of claimant's claims and to a loss of any protection afforded by the treaty. (emphasis added)   \nRespondent's Opening Statement, Slide 146.\n\n106.\n\nThe Respondent also relies on a generalized doctrine of \"clean hands\" which is a metaphor employed as a defence to equitable relief in common law jurisdictions. Incorporation of such a general doctrine into investor-State law without careful boundaries would risk opening investment disputes to an open-ended, vague and ultimately unmanageable principle. However, putting aside the label, serious financial misconduct by the Claimants incompatible with their good faith obligations as investors in the host country (such as criminality in defrauding the host Government in respect of an investment) is not without Treaty consequences, both in relation to their attempt to rely on the guarantee of fair and equitable treatment, as well as their entitlement to relief of any kind from an international tribunal.\n\n**6.2.The Applicable Standard of Proof**\n----------------------------------------\n\n**6.2.1. The Respondent's Argument**\n------------------------------------\n\n107.\n\nThe Respondent notes that many international tribunals have recognized the difficulty of \"proving\" bribery and corruption. In the nature of things, the parties to such transactions are generally careful to leave no paper trail or other direct or documentary evidence. As a result, if corruption is to be combatted effectively, it is necessary to rely on inferences from circumstantial evidence. A reasonable approach is to identify \"red flags\" which, if established, require the alleged perpetrators to provide an exculpatory explanation of otherwise suspicious conduct. In *Metal-Tech v. Uzbekistan*,39 for example, the tribunal considered probative of corruption the Government's evidence of substantial payments to a consultant where:\n\n(a) the consultant lacks experience in the sector,\n\n(b) the consultant is not a resident of the country where the project is located;\n\n(c) the consultant has no significant business presence or experience within the country;\n\n(d) the consultant requests \"urgent\" payments and/or unusually high commissions;\n\n(e) the consultant requests payments be made in cash, be made in a third country, to a numbered bank account, or to some other person or entity than the one with whom the agreement was signed;\n\n(f) the consultant has a close personal/professional relationship to the Government that could improperly influence the decision.40\n\n*Metal-Tech v. Uzbekistan*, Exhibit LHRA-157, at para. 293. See also ICC Dossier *Addressing Issues of Corruption in Commercial and Investment Arbitration*, Chapter 5, Exhibit LHRA-160.\n\n*Metal-Tech v. Uzbekistan*, Exhibit LHRA-157, para. 293.\n\n**6.2.2. The Claimant's Argument**\n----------------------------------\n\n108.\n\nThe Claimants contend that the applicable standard of proof of corruption in international law is \"**clear and convincing evidence**\" which must consist of \"substantial facts\" not mere \"inferences\".41 Relevance is placed on *Waguih Elie George Siag and Clorinda Vecchi v. The Arab Republic of Egypt*, where the tribunal held that \"the applicable standard of proof is greater than the balance of probabilities but less than beyond a reasonable doubt.\" The term favoured by the Claimants is \"**clear and convincing evidence**.\"42\n\n*Liman Caspian Oil BV and NCL Dutch Investment BV v. Republic of Kazakhstan*, ICSID Case No. ARB/07/14, Award, 22 June 2010, Exhibit CLA(B)-441, at para. 424:  \n\u2026 It is not sufficient to present evidence which could possibly indicate that there might have been or even probably was corruption. Rather Claimants have to *prove* corruption\u2026[T]he issue is not one of inference, and the Tribunal considers that Claimants have not met their burden of proof in this regard.  \nSee also *Gustav FW Hamseter GmbH & Co KG v. Republic of Ghana*, ICSID Case No. ARB/07/24, Award, 18 June 2010, Exhibit LHRA-26, at para. 134.\n\n*Waguih Elie George Siag & Clorinda Vecchi v. Arab Republic of Egypt,* ICSID Case No ARB/05/15, Award, 1 June 2009, Exhibit CLA(LH)-069, at para. 326.\n\n**6.2.3. The Tribunal's Ruling**\n--------------------------------\n\n109.\n\nThe Tribunal acknowledges the difficulty of proving corruption as well as the importance of exposing corruption where it exists. In the nature of the offence, the person offering the bribe and the person accepting it will take care to cover their tracks. Nevertheless, given the seriousness of the charge, and the severity of the consequences to the individuals concerned, procedural fairness requires that there be proof rather than conjecture. The standard of \"probabilities\" requires the trier of fact to stand back and make an overall assessment. The requirement of \"clear and convincing\" evidence puts the focus more closely on the building blocks of the evidence to ensure a rigorous testing.\n\n110.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view there need not be \"clear and convincing evidence\" of every element of every allegation of corruption, but such \"clear and convincing evidence\" as exists must point clearly to corruption. An assessment must therefore be made of which elements of the alleged act of corruption have been established by clear and convincing evidence, and which elements are left to reasonable inference, and on the whole whether the alleged act of corruption is established to a standard higher than the balance of probabilities but less than the criminal standard of beyond reasonable doubt, although of course proof beyond a reasonable doubt would be conclusive. This approach reflects the general proposition that the graver the charge, the more confidence there must be in the evidence relied on.43\n\n*See* *Libananco v. Turkey* (Exhibit CLA(LH)-168), para. 125 *;* *Rompetrol v. Romania* (Exhibit CLA(LH)-173), para. 182; both relying on the Separate Opinion of Judge Higgins in the Oil Platforms case, ICJ Reports 1996, at 856.\n\n**6.3. Failure of the Respondent to Investigate and Prosecute Persons who Allegedly Accepted Bribes**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n111.\n\nAs the Claimants point out, the Respondent has brought no prosecutions against any Government official said to be on the receiving end of the bribes. Nor is there before the Tribunal any evidence of a serious criminal investigation of anyone other than the principals of the Claimant, Mr. John Baldwin and Mr. Sean Scott.\n\n112.\n\nConviction of its own officials would not estop the Government from pursuing the Claimants as bribe-givers. However, in this case, the Tribunal finds it disturbing that **no** prosecutions have been brought against **any** persons alleged to have accepted bribes, nor has there been evidence of due diligence in any investigation. These omissions are relevant to the credibility of the Government's allegations, as will be seen.\n\n**6.3.1. First Allegation \u2013 Bribes to Obtain the 2009 Flat Tax Agreement**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**6.3.1.1. The Respondent's Argument**\n--------------------------------------\n\n113.\n\nThe Claimants have repeatedly acknowledged that the Flat Tax Agreement (\"**FTA**\")44 was essential to the economic profitability of Savan Vegas. Mr. John Baldwin testified in Singapore that the Claimants would not have built the casino without an FTA:\n\nQ. And would you have built the Savan Vegas casino for $25 million, $30 million if that was the tax you had to pay, if the government refused to give you a flat tax agreement?\n\nA. No.45\n\nFlat Tax Agreement between Laos and Savan Vegas, dated 21 September 2009, Exhibit C(B)-007.\n\nAmended Transcript, 5 September 208, p. 89, 12-16.\n\n114.\n\nIt is alleged that to obtain the original 2009 FTA, a bribe of US $30,000 was paid to Ms. Manivone or Mr. Khamphai, senior officials with the Government tax department, through the Claimants' intermediary or consultant, Madam Sengkeo.\n\n115.\n\nThe FTA was of great value to the Claimants as it limited most types of tax to a flat sum of US $745,000 per year regardless of the profits made by the multi-million-dollar casino operation.\n\n116.\n\nThe chronology is as follows:\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **DATE** | **ACTIVITY** |\n| 29 December 2008 | Prime Minister approves FTA in principle |\n| 21 September 2009 | Flat Tax Agreement signed. |\n| 22 September 2009 | Internal Sanum e-mail records that Mr. Khamphai requested wire of \"agreed payment\" to Madam Sengkeo's account \"approved\" by Mr. Baldwin.46 |\n| 24 September 2009 | Internal Sanum e-mail records that **the** \"**tax people** are requesting [\u2026] $30,000 USD [\u2026] to get the flat tax approval.\"47 |\n| 7 October 2009 | Internal Sanum e-mail records that Madam Sengkeo \"has provided **her daughter's** bank account\" information.48 |\n| 8 October 2009 | Internal Sanum e-mail records that Mr. Baldwin instructed the disbursement of funds \"by wire\" for \"service[s] partially rendered\". Amounts of $10,000 and $20,000 were disbursed from the account \"by wire\".49 |\n\nEmails regarding Flat Tax, Exhibit LHRE-152.\n\n*Ibid*.\n\n*Ibid*.\n\n*Ibid*.\n\n117.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, the sequence of dates, and the use of the daughter's bank account in lieu of Madam Sengkeo's own account, raise \"red flags\".\n\n118.\n\nWhile the FTA had been agreed to in principle in December 2008, Mr. John Baldwin testified that the deal was not done, because \"we needed to get the flat tax agreement reduced into a formal document at that specific time.\"50 Accordingly, it would have been quite understandable for the payment of a bribe to be delayed until October 2009 when the FTA was signed, as opposed to December 2008 when it was purportedly approved in principle by the Government.\n\nMr. John Baldwin testified as follows:  \nQ. What was the agreement's substance? I mean, the agreement with Madam Sengkeo, what was the substance of that agreement?  \nA. I believe \u2013 I \u2013 I don't know specifically, but I believe that we needed to get the flat tax agreement reduced into a formal document at that specific time, but Madam Sengkeo's engagement went back nearly a year, is my recollection, and that she helped, through that whole period, to get the flat tax agreement.  \nQ. What was the agreement? Why was she getting 30,000? Why not 50,000?  \nA. Well, she agreed to take $30,000.  \nAmended Transcript, 5 September 2018, p.69, 16-25 to 70, 1-3.\n\n119.\n\nIn cross-examination, Mr. John Baldwin denied any illegal payment to Madam Sengkeo but according to the Respondent, Mr. Baldwin's explanation that the reference to payment in October 2009 of US $30,000 to the \"**tax people**\" meant payment to Madam Sengkeo for her own benefit rather than as a bribe for tax officials is (according to the Respondent) manifestly absurd. In this respect, Mr. John Baldwin testified as follows:\n\nQ. Isn't this a statement to the CFO of Sanum/Savan Vegas to pay a bribe of $30,000 to a tax official in the Ministry of Finance?\n\nA. No.\n\nQ. How do you interpret it? What does it mean?\n\nA. That the $30,000 success fee was supposed to be paid to Madam Sengkeo and her tax people that were with her.\n\nQ. She is \"the Tax people\"?\n\nA. Yes.\n\nQ. Did she work for the government then?\n\nA. No.\n\nQ. She didn't? She's not an employee of the Ministry of Finance?\n\nA. No.51\n\nAmended Transcript, 5 September 2018, p. 66, 1-15.\n\n120.\n\nThe Respondent adds that the US $30,000 may have gone to Madam Sengkeo in the first instance, but in the Respondent's view, the coincidence of timing with Sanum's apparent need to ingratiate itself with Government officials is fatal to Mr. Baldwin's credibility.\n\n**6.3.1.2. The Claimant's Argument**\n------------------------------------\n\n121.\n\nThe Claimants contend that payment of US $30,000 to Madam Sengkeo was a \"success fee\" for obtaining the FTA where previous intermediaries had failed.52 Mr. Baldwin strongly denied any impropriety:\n\nQ. Down at the bottom of the page it says:\n\n\"Dear Billy and Team, Mr Khamphai of the Tax Department and Mdm Sengkeo had just informed us that Joe had picked up the flat tax document at his office [meaning Mr Khamphai's] since 9AM this morning...\n\nHowever, he has asked us to wire the agreed payment to Madam Sengkeo's account as followed...\"\n\nAnd then they give the account number. So isn't this interesting, that the day that the flat tax agreement is delivered to your employee, he asked that $30,000 is wired that day?\n\nA. Well, my reading of this is that \"he\" is Joe.\n\nQ. And who is he saying that the money should be paid to?\n\nA. Madam Sengkeo.53 (emphasis added)\n\nMr. Baldwin testified in his Second Witness Statement in the SIAC case of 8 June 2015 as follows:  \n15. The Government alleges that I authorized payments totaling US $30,000 to Madame Sengkeo Phimmasone, as a bribe to obtain the flat tax agreement issued on 1 September 2009 for Savan Vegas. This too is false. **The payments represented a success fee to Madam Sengkeo** for her efforts to help Savan Vegas negotiate a Flat Tax Agreement with the Lao Government \u2013 a project on which she had worked since at least July 2008.  \n16. Initially, it was the ST Group \u2013 then our local partner in Laos \u2013 that was responsible for obtaining a flat tax agreement for Savan Vegas. However, it failed to do so, thus by mid-2008, we took it upon ourselves to negotiate such an agreement with the Lao Government. In order to have local Lao expertise to assist us, **Savan Vegas offered a success fee to Madam Sengkeo** to lobby for a satisfactory Flat Tax Agreement for Savan Vegas. Madam Sengkeo was a partner of ST, which is how I came to know her. I discovered that she had many high-level connections in the Lao Government. This made her a natural choice for this consulting engagement. (emphasis added)  \nJohn Baldwin Second Witness Statement, 8 June 2015, paras. 15-16, Exhibit LHRE-159.\n\nAmended Transcript, 5 September 2018, p. 67, 2-18.\n\n122.\n\nMr. John Baldwin testified that there was no reason to bribe any Government employee in September 2009 as the Prime Minister had already agreed to a flat tax agreement in December 2008.54\n\nMr. Baldwin testified:  \nQ. Would there be any reason to have to bribe anyone when the Prime Minister had already approved your flat tax?  \nA. You know, there's no reason to and, plus, obviously, the Prime Minister's office was watching this. The local tax people were watching this, the finance department's watching this. This was a significant project and lots of people were watching it and there's no way. You just wouldn't \u2013 couldn't happen.  \nAmended Transcript, 5 September 2018, p. 151, 2-11.\n\n**6.3.1.3. The Tribunal's Ruling**\n----------------------------------\n\n123.\n\nThe Respondent's case is speculative rather than substantial. Madam Sengkeo was in the consulting business. Consultants are paid. While the Claimants never produced a \"consulting agreement\" with Madam Sengkeo, the evidence is that it is not unusual for consultants to insist on a success fee as part of their remuneration. The effort to obtain an FTA was successful. It was likely worth millions of dollars to the Claimants in reduced taxes. In that context, payment of US $30,000 in 2009 is not a disproportionate \"success fee\". Moreover, no one was prosecuted in this affair. Even if Madam Sengkeo did not cooperate with the Government, why was her daughter (the owner of the bank account) not investigated? What is the daughter's explanation? The evidence of corruption in this instance is neither clear nor convincing. The bribery allegation in connection with the FTA is not established to the necessary standard for such a serious charge.\n\n**6.3.2. Second Allegation \u2013 Bribes to Extend the Flat Tax Agreement After Expiry of the 5-Year Term**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**6.3.2.1. The Respondent's Argument**\n--------------------------------------\n\n124.\n\nOn 18 March 2011, Savan Vegas submitted its proposal to extend the FTA, which was due to expire on 31 December 2014. Six days later, on 24 March 2011, the Claimants paid US $21,000 to Mr. Bouker Noutharath, a retired hospital worker from Olympia, Washington State, United States of America, who had returned to live in Laos. He had no experience as a \"consultant\" but had good contacts within the Government. On 4 March 2011, he was retained by Savan Vegas55 as a consultant to lobby in favour of an extension of the FTA. Mr. Baldwin says Mr. Bouker was promised a success fee substantially in excess of US $21,000, but Mr. Bouker, who agreed to cooperate with the Government, testified that:\n\nI have seen the entry in the general ledger that I was sent $21,000 on March 24, 2011. The entry says \"prof fee re flat tax acceptance \u2013 Brian Nonthavet.\" RE-131. I remember that Sanum was concerned about extending a flat tax agreement, but **I was not involved** in that issue. **I was sent the $21,000 to deliver it to a government person.** I remember it was Mr. Paoa [of Savan Vegas] who asked me to make this payment about the tax issue but **I cannot remember the name of the Government person** who I gave this payment too.56 (emphasis added)\n\n\u2026\n\nThese contracts are for fraud reasons. They were drafted and sent to me by lawyer Martin Gersten\u2026They were to provide a cover for the bribes Sanum intended to pay to have the Government extend the Flat Tax Agreement and to obtain the Thakhaek slot club licence.57\n\nBouker Nonthavet Third Witness Statement, 23 May 2014, Exhibit 4, Respondent's Opening Submission, Slide 161.\n\nBouker Nonthavet First Witness Statement, 2 April 2014, at para. 7.\n\nAmended Transcript, 5 September 2018, p. 90, 20-25.\n\n125.\n\nThe Respondent believes the unidentified \"Government Person\" was Ms. Manivone but\n\nMr. Baldwin testified he was \"sure\" this was not so:\n\nQ. Do you know that at the time you were negotiating with Madam Manivone in the tax department of the Ministry of Finance?\n\nA. Well, we were \u2013 negotiated with Madam Manivone from 2007 clear through, you know, into 2012.\n\n\u2026\n\nQ. Isn't it true that Mr Paoa asked Bouker to deliver $21,000 [in 2012] to Ms Manivone in the tax department to help in negotiations for the flat tax agreement?\n\nA. I don't think so.\n\nQ. But you're not sure?\n\nA. I'm sure\u202658\n\nAmended Transcript, 5 September 2018, p. 86, 7-24.\n\n**6.3.2.2. The Claimant's Argument**\n------------------------------------\n\n126.\n\nMr. Bouker received a legitimate consulting mandate. By e-mail dated 21 March 2011, he requested US $21,000 as \"an advance\". His bank records do not show a withdrawal of US $21,000 but withdrawals of three different amounts on 28 March (US $9,500 cash), 30 March (US $9,000 to his son) and 4 April (US $2,135 cash). Mr. Bouker is a dissatisfied former employee whose testimony is not credible.\n\n**6.3.2.3. The Tribunal's Ruling**\n----------------------------------\n\n127.\n\nThere are inconsistencies in Mr. Bouker's evidence and it is significant that he can remember nothing about (or is otherwise unwilling to identify) \"the Government Person\" to whom he said he handed US $21,000. There are too many loose ends to his story. There is no evidence that Madam Manivone (the presumed recipient) or anyone else was prosecuted. In the Tribunal's view, the Respondent's evidence does not establish by clear and convincing evidence that a US $21,000 bribe was offered by Mr. Bouker to any Government official as alleged.\n\n**6.3.3. Third Allegation \u2013 The Claimants Paid US $500,000 in Bribes in 2012 to (i) Shut Down the E&Y Audit of Savan Vegas and (ii) to Cause the Government to Shut Down the Thanaleng Slot Club to the Disadvantage of ST Holdings**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n128.\n\nOn 8 July 2012, Mr. Baldwin wired Sanum's Chief Financial Officer, Mr. Clay Crawford, that \"Savan has an extraordinary expense of $500,000 this week. I've tell you about it when we speak on the phone, but please think about our cash situation.\"59\n\nE-mail from Mr. John Baldwin to Clay Crawford, 8 July 2012, Exhibit LHRE-154.\n\n129.\n\nMr. Baldwin accepts that the sum of US $500,000 was subsequently sent to Vientiane including US $300,000 cash in a backpack delivered to Madam Sengkeo by his personal assistant, Bruce Douglas.60\n\nTranscript, 16 June 2015 Hearing, SIAC Case No. ARB/143/14/MV, pp. 207-208, Exhibit LHRE-160:  \nQ. You ordered Mr. Douglas on that day, or the day before, rather, the same day you had to have the 200,000 on 11 July you ordered Mr. Douglas to get into an airplane in Cambodia, fly across the border with USD 300,000 in a suitcase, didn't you?  \nA. In a backpack.  \nQ. You have USD 500,000 going into Vientiane in a two-day period in cash?  \nA. Yes.\n\n**6.3.3.1. The E&Y Audit**\n--------------------------\n\n130.\n\nMr. Baldwin acknowledges ordering Mr. Douglas, to fly to Vientiane with US $300,000 cash. It is established that US $300,000 was subsequently deposited in Madam Sengkeo's bank account. She subsequently deposited US $30,000 in her bank account in New York.\n\n131.\n\nThe Respondent's allegation is that the balance of US $270,000 was paid by Madam Sengkeo to Government officials to stop the E&Y audit of the Savan Vegas which Mr. Baldwin considered part of a Government move to get rid of Sanum and take over the Claimants' gambling assets without compensation.61\n\nJohn Baldwin testified in his Third Witness Statement, 22 July 2013, at para. 5:  \n\u2026\"Even those few Government officials who will still speak with me have admitted that we have been the target of a deliberate campaign to strip Sanum of its investments in Laos. The objective of these efforts appears to be to leave the successful businesses, in which we invested so much and which we spent years developing, in the hands of our local commercial partner, the ST Group...and the senior Lao Government officials who have intimate business and familial connections with ST.\"\n\n**6.3.3.1.1. The Respondent's Argument**\n----------------------------------------\n\n132.\n\nThe Respondent points out that the alleged \"loan\" to Madam Sengkeo was undocumented.62 Only US $15,000 has been repaid.63 Mr. Baldwin acknowledges that Madam Sengkeo has not been asked by the Claimants to repay the balance. The US $30,000 deposit in New York was 10% of the US $300,000 transfer. Madam Sengkeo was a \"ten percenter\", and her receipt of US $30,000 indicates that bribes of US $270,000 were paid.\n\nSee testimony of Mr. John Baldwin, Transcript, 16 June 2015 Hearing, SIAC Case No. ARB/143/14/MV, p. 209, Exhibit LHRE-160:  \nJudge Barkett: Can I ask a question? Would there be loan documents evidencing this loan?  \nA. **Not on this loan. We have made her other loans that there are. This was \u2013 she was part owner of Paksong Vegas and a part owner of Savan Vegas, small pieces. We had \u2013 she helped us with a lot of things,** **but she and I become very close friends****. When she called us, she said she needed it and I responded to that need.** (emphasis added)\n\nTestimony of Mr. John Baldwin, Amended Transcript, 5 September 2018 at p. 41, 14-25 to p. 42, 5-10:  \nQ. \u2026first of all, your $300,000 loan that you say you gave Madam Sengkeo in 2012, are there any loan documents for that loan?  \nA. No, there are not.  \nQ. Has she ever repaid it?  \nA. She \u2013 she paid me 500,000 Thai baht.  \nQ. That's US $15,000?  \nA. US $15,000.  \nQ. Do you have any record of that payment?  \nA. I think so \u2013 yeah, I do.  \nQ. Have you ever produced it? You have been asked\u2026.  \n\u2026  \nQ. Okay. But the other \u2013 let's assume she gave you US $15,000. The other 285,000 that you lent her in 2012 has not been repaid?  \nA. It has not been repaid.  \nQ. And we're now in 2018?  \nA. Yes.\n\n133.\n\nThe bribe succeeded, according to the Respondent. On 12 July 2012, Ernst & Young was ordered by unidentified Government officials to stop work on its audit of Savan Vegas.64 The E&Y audit would have disclosed the Claimants' illegal activities (subsequently uncovered by a BDO audit after the Government ousted the Claimants from the casino) including (the Government alleges) embezzlement and money laundering.\n\nLetter from Ernst & Young to the Ministry of Finance, Exhibit LHRE-53:  \nIn relation to our final report, we also feel it necessary to remind the Inspection Committee that, since we were instructed by your goodself on 10 July 2012 to cease our fieldwork at Savan Vegas Hotel & Casino (SVC) and to refrain from receiving any additional information and/or documents from SVC on the same day, our final report will only contain our preliminary findings and/or observations for the work performed on documents and information received by us from SVC up till and including 10 July 2012.\n\n**6.3.3.1.2. The Claimant's Argument**\n--------------------------------------\n\n134.\n\nThe Claimants say the US $300,000 was a \"loan\" to Madam Sengkeo. The New York deposits are unrelated. Madam Sengkeo was closely involved with ST Holdings. There had been a falling out. She thus had an \"urgency\" for funds when ST Holdings malevolently cut off Madam Sengkeo's regular source of income.65 Mr. Baldwin was a loyal friend.\n\nTranscript, 16 June 2015 Hearing, SIAC Case No. ARB/143/14/MV, p. 207208, Exhibit LHRE-160/SRE-160:   \nQ. What was going on in Vientiane in July 2012 that you needed all that cash there except the Thanaleng case was happening about 10 days later and the E&Y audit was terminated the day before. Those are the two events that I can think of that related to Savan Vegas, what can you think of?  \nA. **ST had cut Madame Sengkeo off from any income from their investments, because she had helped us over him, he had cut her off from any money and she lives primarily on money from him. She needed money to pay bills on the hotel she was building. The USD $300,000 is a loan to her.** (emphasis added)\n\n**6.3.3.1.3. The Tribunal's Ruling**\n------------------------------------\n\n135.\n\nMr. Baldwin's explanation of the US $300,000 payment to Madam Sengkeo is not credible. It is clear on the evidence that Mr. Baldwin and his CFO, Mr. Clay Crawford, were concerned about the threat to Sanum's business posed by the E&Y audit. Mr. Baldwin had every incentive to influence the Government to call off the E&Y audit in the summer of 2012. It is simply not plausible, as the Claimants argue, that the E&Y audit was stopped because Government officials had concluded that E&Y had *failed* to find incriminating evidence. If that were true, the obvious instructions from the Government to E&Y would have been to keep digging not to give up and down tools.\n\n136.\n\nOn the other hand, the Claimants had a powerful motive to stop the audit as Mr. Baldwin and Mr. Crawford knew (and the Government merely suspected) of the existence of financial skeletons in the Savan Vegas books later uncovered by the BDO audit. All in all, the Tribunal concludes that the Claimants got a senior Government official to stop the audit and that the $270,000 was paid through Madam Sengkeo (i.e. $300,000 less 10%) to that Government person or persons.\n\n137.\n\nThat said, the Tribunal is troubled by the fact that the Government has apparently not identified any bribe- *takers*. The order to E&Y to stop the audit came as a surprise to E&Y and must have been issued by a senior Government source, otherwise the audit would have continued. The Respondent does not suggest that E&Y took the bribe **but E&Y must know who gave its auditors the order to stop work**. The evidentiary trail could then have been followed up the chain of command from the Government person who gave the order to identify the person who authorized the order, who could then have been required to provide the Government (and subsequently the Tribunal) with an explanation for the stop work order.\n\n138.\n\nThe Respondent has not offered any explanation for this gap in the evidence. In the circumstances, while the evidence of Mr. Baldwin that Madam Sengkeo required the funds for her personal use is deeply unsatisfactory, so too is the Government's apparent failure even to *attempt* (so far the evidence is concerned) to get to the bottom of the matter, not only potentially to punish the wrongdoers, but to provide solid evidence that a bribe was given and taken by Government official(s) to stop the E&Y audit.\n\n139.\n\nThe Tribunal concludes that it is more probable than not that Madam Sengkeo was used as a conduit to bribe Government officials to stop the E&Y audit, but that this conclusion is not established to the higher standard of \"clear and convincing evidence\". The Tribunal is satisfied, however, on the lesser standard of probabilities, that Mr. Baldwin involved the Claimants in serious financial illegalities in respect of the halt of the E&Y audit.\n\n**6.3.3.2. Payment of About US $200,000 in Bribes to Shut Down the Thanaleng Slot Club**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n140.\n\nIn 2012, the Claimants were experiencing tense relations with their then Laotian partner, ST Holdings. In part, the tensions related to a profitable slot club at Thanaleng, which ST Holdings agreed to joint venture with Sanum. The joint venture was to commence at a future date awaiting the expiry of an earlier arrangement ST Holdings had contracted with a different slot machine supplier. However, when the date for the change-over arrived, ST Holdings refused to proceed with its deal with Sanum.\n\n141.\n\nMr. Baldwin is alleged to have then paid bribes to Government officials through a \"consultant\", Mr. Anousith Thepsimuong, in an effort to shut down the Thanaleng Slot Club as a pressure tactic to force ST Holdings to negotiate a solution rather than continue with litigation (which the Claimants ultimately lost in the Laotian Courts).\n\n**6.3.3.2.1. The Respondent's Argument**\n----------------------------------------\n\n142.\n\nOn 28 July 2012, during the corporate struggle over the Thanaleng Slot Club, the Claimants attempted to obtain leverage over ST Holdings by bribing Government Ministries to shut down the Club. The money was channelled through Mr. Anousith. The sum of US $190,000 was deposited in Mr. Anousith's bank account on 11 July 2012 and a cash withdrawal of US $100,000 was made the following day.66\n\nExtract of ANZ Bank Statement for Mr. Anousith Thepsimoung, Exhibit LHRE-153.\n\n143.\n\nMr. Baldwin testified that Mr. Anousith was paid to lobby \"the National Assembly\" but this explanation is not credible. The National Assembly has no executive function. Only a Government Minister would have operational authority to issue a stop order against the Thanaleng Slot Club.\n\n144.\n\nMr. Baldwin acknowledged that he could not explain how or why the National Assembly would get involved in such an executive action:\n\nQ. You say that the National Assembly is going to suspend a licence, but did he [the Deputy Prime Minister] ever explain or did you ever find out how the National Assembly would actually do that?\n\nA. No.67\n\nAmended Transcript, 5 September 2018, at p. 9,23-25 to p. 10, 1-4.\n\n**6.3.3.2.2. The Claimant's Argument**\n--------------------------------------\n\n145.\n\nMr. John Baldwin readily admits that in July 2012 he was doing what was possible to get the Government to close the Thangaleng Slot Club,68 including by a written submission to the country's President. The Claimants say there is no reason to disbelieve Mr. Baldwin's evidence that he was told by the Deputy Prime Minister to lobby the country's National Assembly.69\n\nMr. Baldwin testified that he wrote to President Choummaly Sayasone requesting the Government to shut down the Thangaleng Slot Club:  \n\"Sanum asks that the Government suspend that the slot machine licence at the Vientiane Friendship Bridge. We believe that a temporary suspension will encourage the parties to negotiate and come to terms so they can work together. Once the parties have reached an agreement, formed a joint venture that is approved by the relevant ministries, and determine that they can operate the Vientiane\u2026Bridge Slot Club together, the licence would be reinstated. Until then, Sanum requests your assistance in suspending the licence and allowing time and space to work [together] towards peace with [the] ST Group.\" Correct? So, as I said, you were trying to get a space to negotiate your way out of this trouble with ST.  \nA. Yes.  \nAmended Transcript, 5 September 2018, p. 7, 19-25 to p. 8, 1-11.\n\nIn re-examination, Mr. Baldwin testified about the National Assembly as follows:  \nMS DEITSCH-PEREZ: You spoke with Mr Branson about the Thanaleng lobbying. Can you tell us where you first got the idea to lobby the assembly with respect to Thanaleng?  \nA. Yeah. I was having breakfast with Deputy Prime Minister Somsavath \u2013 we were having oatmeal \u2013 and he \u2013 I said I got \u2013 I have to get \u2013 make peace with Sithat somehow and I \u2013 how do we do it and he said, you know, it's a tough row, because, you know, he's joined at the hip with Bounnhang \u2013 you know, with vicepresident Vorachith, Bounnhang Vorachith, and he said I \u2013 there's not very many people that are going to be able to help you with this, you've got to make peace with Sithat and Vorachith, so I said, \"Well, who can help me do that?\", and he said, \"Well, two places \u2013 the politburo and the National Assembly\", and he said the politburo, \"That's difficult, so I would suggest that you reach out to the National Assembly.\"  \nAmended Transcript, 5 September 2018, p. 171, 3-22.\n\n146.\n\nMr. Baldwin denied that money was intended for a Government Minister:\n\nQ. See, that brings us back to July and this $500,000 pot of money that we have sitting in Vientiane in Madam Sengkeo's bank account \u2013 her son-inlaw's bank account. Isn't it true that that money was there to stop the court case from having a judgment \u2013 the money was there so you could get the slot club shut down and negotiate with Mr Sithat?\n\nA. The money was specifically earmarked to do lobbying with the National Assembly.\n\nQ. Well, we just established that y **ou have a good friend who is the fourth most powerful person in the country**. Wasn't the money for him to shut down the club so you could stop the court decision?\n\nA. No.70 (emphasis added)\n\nAmended Transcript, 5 September 2018, p. 15, 3-18.\n\n147.\n\nThe Claimants argue that there is no evidence that Mr. Anousith paid money to any Government official. He received fees as a consultant to lobby the National Assembly to shut down the Thanaleng Slot Club. He was entitled to spend that money as he wished. Laos is a cash economy. Payment of large amounts of cash in respect of legitimate transactions is not unusual.71 Cash does not signal illegality.\n\nTestimony of Mr. John Baldwin, Transcript, 26 January 2017 Hearing, SIAC Case No. ARB/143/14/MV, pp. 126671268, Exhibit LHRE-163:  \n**Q. And then the next day, on July the 12th there was a withdrawal of a hundred thousand, correct, in cash?**  \nA. It shows a withdrawal of a hundred thousand.  \n**Q. What did you tell Mr. Anousith to do with that hundred thousand?**  \nA. I didn't tell him to do anything with that money.  \n**Q. I see. Why did you think he took out a hundred thousand of the 193 you just sent him?**  \nA. We paid him a fee, we didn't \u2013 it's his money to do with as he wishes.  \n\u2026  \n**Q. Was his job to get a government minister to shut down the Thanaleng Slot Club?**  \nA. No.  \n**Q. What was it to do?**  \nA. We had hired, we had hired him to lobby the national assembly to ask them to shut down the Thanaleng slot club. (emphasis added)\n\n**6.3.3.2.3. The Tribunal's Ruling**\n------------------------------------\n\n148.\n\nOnce again, the payment to Mr. Anousith is deeply suspicious. There is no documentation of any consultancy. There is no explanation of the work for which almost $200,000 were paid to him and deposited in his personal bank account. The mandate to lobby the \"National Assembly\" seems far-fetched. Moreover, despite the alleged payment of bribes, the Thanaleng Slot Club was not shut down. In the circumstances, the Tribunal is unable to find \"clear and convincing evidence\" that a bribe was made or even offered through Mr. Anousith. However, on the lower \"probabilities\" standard, the Tribunal concludes that it is more likely than not that a bribe was paid to an unidentified Government official or officials in an unsuccessful effort to advance the Claimants' agenda at the Thanaleng Slot Club.\n\n**6.3.4. Fourth Allegation \u2013 The Claimants Arranged for a Further US $575,000 Transfer to Madam Sengkeo to Prevent Her from Testifying in These Proceedings**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n149.\n\nIn 2014, when the initial phase of these proceedings was pending, the Government sought to have Madam Sengkeo testify. To that end, she was provided with a written assurance of immunity dated 7 May 2014, if she provided \"information and documents related to offering of bribery to government of [sic] official(s) who were performing accounting audit activities at Savan Vegas and Casino Co., Ltd.\"72\n\nLetter of Immunity from Government's Anti-Corruption Office dated 07/05/2014, Exhibit LHRE-140:  \n**LETTER OF ASSURANCE**  \n**Re: Protection of the rights and best interests of individuals who provide information for anticorruption purpose**  \nThe President of the Government Inspection Committee issues a Letter of Assurance for protection to Ms. Sengkeo Phimmasone, aged 60, a business person, residing at Xangkhou Village, Xaythany District, of Vientiance Capital. The assurance of protection is for her contribution in the anti-corruption efforts by providing information and documents related to offering of bribery to government of official(s) who were performing accounting audit activities at Savan Vegas and Casino Co., Ltd. In accordance with Article 08, Chapter I of the Law on Anti-Corruption, the Government Inspection Committee issues this Letter, and informs the ministries and organizations, provinces and domestic and foreign organizations to acknowledge based on this Letter of Assurance for Ms. Sengkeo Phimmasone, and this Letter serves as legal evidence.\n\n150.\n\nAt a pre-hearing conference on 14 May 2014, the Claimants (amongst other matters) applied to the Tribunal to allow Mr. Baldwin to make a \"personal loan\" to Madam Sengkeo of US $575,000.73 Given the importance and sensitivity of Madam Sengkeo's evidence potentially to be given at the merits Hearing, the Tribunal declined to give its permission for a US $575,000 loan to her from Mr. Baldwin.\n\nSee evidence of Mr. John Baldwin, Transcript, 26 January 2017 Hearing, SIAC Case No. ARB/143/14/MV, p. 1391, Exhibit LHRE-163, Respondent's Opening Submission, slide 182.\n\n151.\n\nThe initial Hearing on the merits proceeded in Singapore in June 2014. Madam Sengkeo did not attend to testify for the Government.\n\n**6.3.4.1. The Respondent's Argument**\n--------------------------------------\n\n152.\n\nMr. John Baldwin, having been denied the Tribunal's permission, arranged for a third party, Gary Morris,74 to make Madam Sengkeo a US $575,000 \"loan\" which was undocumented and was not in fact a loan,75 but an inducement to keep Madam Sengkeo from testifying. There is no evidence that the Claimants' loan of US $300,000 in July 2012 or the third party \"loan\" of US $575,000 of May 2014, being a total of US $875,000 has been repaid except for US $15,000, leaving US $860,000 not accounted for.76\n\nTestimony of Mr. John Baldwin, Transcript, 16 June 2015 Hearing, SIAC Case No. ARB/143/14/MV, p. 213, Exhibit LHRE-163:  \nMr. Branson: Mr. Baldwin, did you ever provide that additional loan guarantee of 575,000 to Ms. Sengkeo?  \n**A. No.**  \nQ. What did you do instead?  \n**A. I asked one of my friends to lend her money on other assets.**  \nQ. Did you guarantee that loan?  \n**A. I did not have to.**  \nQ. Mm?  \n**A. I did not have to.**  \nQ. Why not?  \n**A. The assets that she pledged were of sufficient value that he was content with the loan that was made.**  \nQ. Okay, so you arranged for her to get another loan?  \n**A. Yes.**\n\nAmended Transcript, 5 September 2018, p. 43, 12-23:  \nQ. When did Madam Sengkeo ask you for the $575,000?  \nA. My recollection is perhaps two weeks before the [ICSID] hearing [in May 2014]. (p. 25, 16-18)  \n\u2026  \nQ. I see. So in May 2014, when your counsel asked this tribunal to allow you to pay her or lend \u2013 guarantee, rather, $575,000, what did you do after the tribunal refused to bless that?  \nA. I started asking mutual friends, people that I know, to lend money, if they would lend \u2013 make her a loan. (p. 27, 19-25)  \n\u2026  \nQ. And what loan documentation did he get to secure that loan?  \nA. My understanding, and my recollection, is that there are mortgages \u2013 there were mortgages given by  \nMadam Sengkeo on significant pieces of real estate that she owned in Vientiane. (p. 28, 8-13)  \n\u2026  \nQ. \u2013 to ask Madam Sengkeo?  \nA. No.  \nQ. How about your good friend, Gary Morris, have you asked him to show you any loan documents that he has?  \nA. No.  \nQ. So the two people that, supposedly, are your good friends haven't produced any documents to you to produce to the tribunal?  \nA. No.  \nQ. Has she paid back the 575 to Mr Morris?  \nA. I don't know.\n\nTestimony of Mr. John Baldwin, Transcript, 26 January 2017 Hearing, SIAC Case No. ARB/143/14/MV, p. 1392, Exhibit LHRE-163:  \nQ. Has Ms. Sengkeo paid any of that money back?  \nA. I don't know.  \nQ. It means that, as we sit here today, that you lent her 300,000, Mr. Morris, Mr. McCain's colleagues lent her 575, that's $875,000. Has she paid you back?  \nA. She paid me back 500,000 baht.  \nQ. That's 15,000 US?  \nA. Baht money.\n\n**6.3.4.2. The Claimant's Argument**\n------------------------------------\n\n153.\n\nMr. Baldwin had a long-standing business relationship with Madam Sengkeo which, over time, developed into personal friendship. It was perfectly normal for Madam Sengkeo to seek a personal loan and for Mr. Baldwin to arrange it. There is no evidence whatsoever that the loan of US $575,000 or any part thereof was intended by Mr. Baldwin, or understood by Madam Sengkeo, as an inducement not to testify. Madam Sengkeo,77 who now lives outside Laos, was being improperly pressured by the Government to give false evidence to support its bribery and corruption case78 and it is therefore quite understandable that she wished to avoid being a witness. Mr. Baldwin's explanation of the loans to Madam Sengkeo is not rebutted and there is no evidence inconsistent with his version of events.\n\nMr. Baldwin testified to his friendship as follows:  \n\u2026but my friendship with Madam Sengkeo is \u2013 is - I mean, Madam Sengkeo and I had a great relationship. I mean, it wasn't - she is my friend. I mean, she - we went to many, many, many dinners. I hung out with her family. We \u2013 you know, she's my friend. I mean, there was nothing untoward about my business relationships with her.  \nAmended Transcript, 5 September 2018, p. 38, 12-20.\n\nMr. John Baldwin testified in re-examination:  \nQ. What else did you hear from Peep about Madam Sengkeo's situation?  \nA. Madam Sengkeo has been under \u2013 it's been \u2013 what I've been told is that Madam Sengkeo has been under a great deal of pressure by the government of Lao to sign documents making allegations that were not true and she has been very worried about the consequences of this on not only just her economic state, her property holdings and even her personal safety \u2013  \nJUDGE BINNIE: When you say you have been told, who told you?  \nA. Peep. Peep told me, and the \u2013 madam \u2013 Peep [Sanum employee] has expressed to me that Madam Sengkeo has expressed to her that she just feels there's an enormous amount of pressure and an enormous amount of personal harm that she is subject to if she doesn't do everything the government asks her to, whether it's true or not. It's there \u2013 she says it's been stressed to her it doesn't matter that it's true; she needs to help the government of Lao in their efforts.  \nAmended Transcript, 5 September 2018, p. 161, 4-25.\n\n**6.3.4.3. The Tribunal's Ruling**\n----------------------------------\n\n154.\n\nThe US $575,000 loan, coming on top of the previous loan of US $300,000, of which only US $15,000 were repaid bristles with \"red flags\". Mr. Baldwin clearly intended to sidestep the Tribunal's denial of permission by arranging for the US $575,000 loan from a third party. Given Madam Sengkeo's central role in dealings between the Claimants and the Government over many years, her testimony would have shed crucial light on the legality or illegality of many of the disbursements at issue in the Respondent's allegations.\n\n155.\n\nMr. John Baldwin testified:\n\nQ. So when **Mdm Sengkeo withdrew US $80,000 in cash on July 20**, the day before you went to visit your good friend, the **Deputy Prime Minister**, what do you think she was going to do with those US dollars?\n\nA. It was Mdm Sengkeo's money to do what she wanted. She represented to me that **she needed the loan to pay construction bills**.79 (emphasis added)\n\nAmended Transcript, 5 September 2018, p. 23, 4-11.\n\n156.\n\nIt cannot be said that the bare payment of US $875,000 to Madam Sengkeo is \"clear and convincing evidence\" of bribery. There is no evidence to contradict Mr. Baldwin's evidence of her need for funds. There are other possible explanations for their disbursement.\n\n157.\n\nOn the whole, however, while the Tribunal is unable to find \"clear and convincing evidence\" that the money was paid to Madam Sengkeo to bribe Government Ministers, the Tribunal is nevertheless satisfied on the lower standard of balance of probabilities that Mr. Baldwin and Madam Sengkeo were involved in channeling funds illicitly to Lao Government officials, and further that she was paid to secure her loyalty and to avoid her testifying on behalf of the Government, thereby obstructing justice.\n\n158.\n\nThe coincidence of the timing of \"loans\" of US $875,000 (less one repayment of US $15,000) to Madam Sengkeo and the Claimants' urgent need for Government intervention on its behalf at critical junctures of its business (the termination of the E&Y audit and the attempt to shut down the Thanaleng Slot Club), together with Madam Sengkeo's role as the Claimants' principal go-between with the Government, which Mr. Baldwin describes as a corrupt Government, compels an inference of Mr. Baldwin's unlawful conduct and through Mr. Baldwin, the culpability and bad faith of both LHNV and Sanum, on whose behalf he acted.\n\n159.\n\nThe Government's failure to track down bribe-takers or to provide a convincing explanation of its efforts (even if on occasion unsuccessful) to do so, tells against the Government's case, although the fact that the key witness, Madam Sengkeo, herself refused to cooperate made the Government's task more difficult.\n\n160.\n\nPossibly the Government prefers to spare itself some embarrassment by declining to put whatever it knows about \"bribe- *takers*\" into the record of the Tribunal.\n\n161.\n\nBe that as it may be, the circumstances disclosed to the Tribunal do not rise to the level of \"clear and compelling evidence\" of corruption.\n\n162.\n\nHowever, the Tribunal's conclusion that corruption of Government officials is established to the lower standard of \"balance of probabilities\" is relevant to the issue of the Claimants' good faith and the legitimacy of the Claimants' alleged \"legitimate\" expectations of fair and \"equitable\" treatment. This issue is dealt with below.\n\n**6.3.5. Fifth Allegation \u2013 Bribery Scheme in June 2015 to Restore Control of Savan Vegas to the Claimants**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n163.\n\nThe Respondent seized control of the Savan Vegas and gambling facilities on 15 April 2015. Its right to do so was eventually confirmed by an arbitral tribunal constituted under the SIAC by its Award dated 29 June 2017.80\n\nSIAC Award dated 29 June 2017.\n\n164.\n\nPrior to the SIAC Award, however, the Claimants asserted a right under the 2014 Settlement to take back control81 on the basis they had managed to sell their investments on the open market prior to the 15 April 2015 deadline imposed as a term of the Settlement with the Government. The allegedly genuine third-party offer to purchase dated 14 April 2015 was from an entity called **MaxGaming Consulting Services Limited (Macau)** (\"**MaxGaming**\").82 Its CEO, Mr. Angus Noble, represented in writing that MaxGaming had funds available to complete the transaction and intended to do so.83 In testimony before the SIAC tribunal in January 2017, Angus Noble acknowledged that these representations were false.84 He repeated this retraction to this Tribunal at the Hearing. The MaxGaming transaction did not proceed and was found by the SIAC tribunal to be a sham.85 Having heard Mr. Noble's evidence, this Tribunal also concludes that the 14 April 2015 offer was a sham. Indeed Mr. Noble more or less concedes that it was a sham.\n\nEmail from Mr. Gene McCain to Mr. John Baldwin and Mr. Shawn Scott dated 15 May 2015, Exhibit LHRE-156:   \nThe Buyers have also made it clear that Sanum Investments Ltd. must be given back control of the management of the Casino for the Buyers to regain confidence that the Laos government will honor the Deed of Settlement and so that Sanum can be given time to get the revenue and operations back to where they should be.

The Respondent's Argument**\n--------------------------------------\n\n165.\n\nThe MaxGaming offer was a fraudulent scheme perpetrated by the Claimants in order to regain control of Savan Vegas86 from the Government. The Claimants had every interest in pre-empting the Government's seizure of Savan Vegas and putting a halt to the Government's access to the books of Savan Vegas and records targeted by a Government audit into alleged wrongdoing at Savan Vegas including money laundering and embezzlement.\n\nEmail and clean copies of Gersten's Consulting Agreement, Exhibit LHRE-158, Respondent's Opening Submission, slide 186. Unsavoury consultants were retained to advance the transaction for success fees totaling US $11 million.\n\n**6.3.5.2. The Claimant's Argument**\n------------------------------------\n\n166.\n\nWhile unrealistic, Mr. Noble genuinely believed he could orchestrate the purchase, which he testified was, for him, \"the chance of a lifetime.\"\n\n**6.3.5.3. The Tribunal's Ruling**\n----------------------------------\n\n167.\n\nThe MaxGaming offer was indeed a sham but bribery and corruption, as opposed to fraud and chicanery, is not established.\n\n**6.3.6. Sixth Allegation \u2013 Miscellaneous Acts of Bribery and Corruption**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n168.\n\nOther allegations of bribery and corruption were made:\n\n(a) offer of a US $7 million bribe to the Prime Minister of Laos for approval of a licence to establish a casino in the capital city of Vientiane;87\n\n(b) a bribe of US $80,000 to the Governor of the Province of Champasak to approve a slot club at Chong Mek;88 and\n\n(c) bribes totalling US $106,000 to Government officials to enable the opening and continued operation of the Paksan Slot Club.89\n\nThere is no \"clear and convincing\" evidence against the Claimants in support of any of these additional claims of bribery and corruption.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, para. 97.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, paras. 100-101; Respondent's Rejoinder, paras. 21-22.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, paras. 102-104.\n\n169.\n\nAs the Claimants point out, the Respondent has identified only two possible Government bribe takers, namely Mr. Bounnong (but there is no indication he has been investigated) and Madam Manivone. The evidence is that Madam Manivone was put under investigation only after refusing to testify for the Respondent.90 The Claimants state that on 29 May 2014, the Respondent promised its Rejoinder would reveal the results of its investigation. It did not.\n\nSee the Respondent's email to the Tribunal dated 29 May 2014, Claimants' Closing Submission, slide 12.\n\n170.\n\nThe Claimants complain, rightly, that the Respondent's failure to offer any credible explanation for not pursuing the investigation of its own employees, or indeed even to attempt to identify the alleged bribe-takers, weighs against the credibility of these miscellaneous allegations.91\n\nThe Claimants cite *Wena Hotels Ltd. v. Arab Republic of Egypt*, ICSID Case No. ARB/98/4, Award, 8 December 2000, CLA(LH)-070, which rejected the Government's bribery defence in part for failure to show the implicated Government official was investigated and prosecuted:  \n116. Although the Tribunal believes Minister Sultan's testimony that he was not personally aware that \"Mr. Kandil was an agent to Farargy\" and that when he did learn about it, \"I passed that to the prosecutor requesting a full-fledged investigation\", it is undisputed that Mr. Kandil was never prosecuted in Egypt in connection with this agreement. Regrettably, because Egypt has failed to present the Tribunal with any information about the investigation requested by Minister Sultan, the Tribunal does not know whether an investigation was conducted and, if so, whether the investigation was closed because the prosecutor determined that Mr. Kandil was innocent, because of lack of evidence, or because of complicity by other government officials. Nevertheless, given the fact that the Egyptian government was made aware of this agreement by Minister Sultan but decided (for whatever reasons) not to prosecute Mr. Kandil, the Tribunal is reluctant to immunize Egypt from liability in this arbitration because it now alleges that the agreement with Mr. Kandil was illegal under Egyptian law.\n\n171.\n\nNevertheless, in the Tribunal's view, none of these additional allegations is supported by sufficient evidence to warrant further inquiry or comment.\n\n**7. THE CLAIM FOR EXPROPRIATION**\n----------------------------------\n\n**7.1. Thanaleng Slot Club**\n----------------------------\n\n**7.1.1. Background**\n---------------------\n\n172.\n\nAt its origin, the dispute underlying the Thanaleng claim is a contractual dispute between two private parties, Sanum and ST. They had signed a **Master Agreement** on 30 May 2007, where they agreed \"to negotiate and work towards entering into certain joint ventures, represented by necessary agreements, which shall convey 60% of all 2nd Party's [ST] gaming businesses located in the country of Lao PDR \u2026 This Agreement is not intended to be a definitive agreement but only provides the Parties' general understandings of their relationship. The Parties agree to work together **in good faith** to negotiate and finalize all necessary agreement to fully implement the concept and terms set forth in this Agreement.\"92 The Respondent's treatment of the Thanaleng situation is part of the \"totality of the facts\" said by counsel for the Claimants to be relevant to LHNV's Treaty claims.\n\nMaster Agreement, Exhibit C(B)-1.\n\n173.\n\nOn 4 October 2008, Sanum and ST signed a Participation Agreement for Thanaleng (\"**Participation Agreement**\"). Under this agreement, Sanum agreed to supply to ST certain slot machines, on a \"generated revenue sharing/participation basis.\"93 This agreement was meant to expire on 11 October 2011 when an existing contract of ST with another supplier of slot machines expired. As explained by Sanum, \"the expiration of the Participation [Agreement] is only the end of percentage of profit distribution and proportion of shareholding of each party in the business participation of the Slot Club, which shifted from ST Group who used to receive 60% to receive 40% instead, and Sanum who used to receive 40% to receive 60%, and at the same time (after 11 October 2011) there shall change or create a joint venture company of which Sanum holds 60% and ST Group 40%.\"94\n\nParticipation Agreement, Exhibit C(B)-6.\n\nSee Sanum's Defense and Counterclaim in the proceedings before the Lao Commercial Court dated 3 July 2012, Exhibit C(B)-181.\n\n174.\n\nThe controversy arose because Sanum and ST disagreed on whether the Master Agreement remained in force and was valid and created binding obligations on the parties, despite the expiration of the Participation Agreement. Was the Participation Agreement a temporary agreement just to cover the period of time when other slot machine supplier agreements were in place? Once those slot machine supplier contracts expired, did the Master Agreement and other agreements referenced above remain in effect and control the contractual relationship between Sanum and the ST Group?95\n\n*Ibid*. The term \"supplier contract\" is used in singular or plural indistinctly in the original text.\n\n**7.1.2. The Parties' Arguments**\n---------------------------------\n\n175.\n\nThe Claimants argue that they were deprived of their investment by flawed court proceedings tainted by interference by the Respondent and without payment of compensation. The Claimants summarize the measures for which they seek relief as follows: \"Beginning with premature termination of the OEDR proceedings on orders from the Minister of Justice, and police participation in Sanum's eviction from the Thanaleng Club, and ending with manifestly unreasonable judgments rendered by the courts of Laos, Respondent directed a result in favor of ST that deprived Sanum of its entitlement to 60% of the revenues generated by its investment in the Thanaleng Slot Club. The entire process was marred by manifest procedural defects, as well as producing a result that was substantially unreasonable.\"96 Sanum's loss impacted the value of LHNV's investment in Sanum.\n\nClaimants' Closing Submission, p. 25; Amended Transcript, 7 September 2018, p. 23, 21-25 to p. 25, 8-21.\n\n176.\n\nAt the closing of the Hearing, the Claimants confirmed that their Thanaleng claim in this proceeding is not based on denial of justice but on the allegation that the totality of the Respondent's treatment substantially deprived the Claimants of the enjoyment of their investment without the payment of compensation.97\n\nClaimants' Closing Submission, p. 68.\n\n177.\n\nThe Claimants insist that Sanum did have an ownership interest in Thanaleng as established in the Master Agreement, and invested millions of dollars in Thanaleng. The Claimants argue that the Respondent's interpretation of the Master Agreement is contrary to the understanding and conduct of the parties to this agreement; it was a binding agreement that contemplated future negotiations between Sanum and a would-be supplier of slot machines and not between Sanum and ST. The fact that the Master Agreement contemplated additional agreements does not detract from its binding character. The Claimants point out that when ST sought the judicial annulment of the Master Agreement, the document was described as the \"basic agreement defining rights in order to manage the relations between both parties.\"98\n\nClaimant's Reply, para. 37.\n\n178.\n\nThe Claimants dispute the relevance of the cases relied on by the Respondent because in the instant case the Respondent consistently treated the Master Agreement as legally binding, \"[o]nly Laos \u2013 for the first time in these proceedings \u2013 has ever characterized the Master Agreement as an agreement to agree that did not generate legally enforceable rights.\"99\n\n*Ibid*., para. 39.\n\n179.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, ST refused repeatedly to accept payment in exchange for a contractually-required exchange of rights which did not extinguish the rights of Sanum, \"but merely constituted another breach by ST of its obligations to relinquish control of the club to Sanum.\"100\n\n*Ibid*., para. 48.\n\n180.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the decision of the Lao Courts concerns a private dispute between ST and Sanum and there was nothing untoward in the various judicial proceedings in Laos. According to the Respondent, the Claimant has committed abuse of process by pursuing contradictory claims in parallel arbitrations against Laos based on the same treaties and the same economic interests. In this respect, the Respondent, at the Hearing, recounted the time line of the procedure:\n\nWe have in July 2012 the decision of the Lao Commercial Court. Immediately, before they exhausted their local remedies, which they are required to do under international law, they filed this arbitration alleging that the Thanaleng court decision was a denial of justice and an expropriation. Later they amended to say it's an expropriation.\n\nIn June 2015, there was a decision by the LHNV tribunal on the first material, the breach application. They didn't prevail.\n\nThree months later, they filed the SIAC arbitration against ST on the same contracts, alleging that the Lao court proceedings had no meaning, they were just -- how would one say it?\n\nOne would say their view of the Lao court proceedings in Singapore was that they were a voluntary mediation. If you don't like the result of a mediation, you withdraw and you go to court. That's how they're treating the Lao court proceeding when they go to Singapore: it didn't matter, is it wasn't definitive.\n\nSo, they get an ST SIAC Award in August 2016. They filed it in the Lao courts in 2017.\n\nThen the Lao courts refused to enforce it in August 2017. On 1 September 2017, they filed a denial of justice claim in the new ICSID arbitration. Then in December 2017, the second material breach application was granted, reinstating this tribunal to hear the Thanaleng case again.\n\nSo they have these conflicting \u2013 once you issued the second material breach decision, it revived these two treaty claims that are in conflict with the treaty claims they had filed in September 2017.101\n\nAmended Transcript, 3 September 2018, p. 143, 6-25 to p. 144, 1-17.\n\n181.\n\nThe Respondent further explained:\n\nSanum said in these cases that the 26 July 2012 decision of the court was expropriation number one. They said their rights were expropriated, that's the claim here, and they filed the first BIT claims in August 2012.\n\nBut the second BIT arbitration says that the date of expropriation was August 2017 when the Lao courts refused to enforce the SIAC award, and that's the subject of the second BIT arbitration.\n\nSo you have these inconsistent claims made by the same claimant under the same treaties, based on the same facts. We say that's an abuse of 102 process.102\n\n*Ibid*., p. 145, 5-19.\n\n**7.1.3. Tribunal's Ruling**\n----------------------------\n\n182.\n\nThe Thanaleng claim relates to a dispute between the Claimants and ST. It concerns the Respondent only to the extent of the Respondent's alleged interference in court proceedings, and only if its actions could be characterized as a violation of international law.\n\n183.\n\nThe Claimants have placed the weight of their argument on the alleged interference of the Respondent in the Lao Commercial Court proceedings in 2012. But the dispute resolution provision in the Master Agreement (Article 2.10)103 provides for a four-stage mechanism. At the fourth stage, after a party to the Master Agreement has exhausted the remedies available in the Lao Courts, it may submit the dispute to arbitration if it is unsatisfied with the result without the need to demonstrate a breach of due process or other violations in the conduct of the court proceedings.\n\n\"If any dispute shall arise, the Parties agree to conduct an amicable negotiation. If such dispute cannot be settled by mediation, the Parties may submit such disputes to the Resolution of Economic Dispute Organization or Courts of the Lao PDR according to the provision and law of Lao PDR in accordance with this Agreement. All proceedings of the arbitration shall be conducted in Lao and English languages.  \nBefore settlement by the arbitrator under the Rules of the Resolution of Economic Dispute Organization, the Parties shall use all efforts to assist the dispute resolution in accordance with the laws of Lao PDR.  \nIf one of the Parties is unsatisfied with the results of the above procedure, the Parties shall mediate and, if necessary, arbitrate such dispute using internationally recognized mediation/arbitration company in Macao, SAR PRC.\" Master Agreement, C(B)-001.\n\n184.\n\nThe Claimants also explained that the four-step mechanism provided for in the Master Agreement has been found to violate Lao law and, therefore, \"any award rendered under the mechanism that differed from the judgment of the Lao Courts would [not] be enforceable in Laos (the only country where the ST's assets are now located) as a matter of Lao 'public policy.'\"104\n\n*Ibid*., Slide 69.\n\n185.\n\nSanum has exercised in full the four levels of remedies provided for in the Master Agreement. After exhausting its recourse to the Lao Courts, Sanum initiated the SIAC arbitration in 2015. In 2016, the SIAC tribunal awarded Sanum the $200 million it had claimed.\n\n186.\n\nThe Claimants say that they have not been able to enforce the SIAC award and link the inability to enforce it to the alleged interference of the Respondent in the Lao Commercial Court in 2012. As explained by the Claimants at the Hearing:\n\nThe problem is, looking at the totality of the circumstances, the Lao Court of Appeals \u2013 and that's the highest level in an enforcement proceeding \u2013 won't allow enforcement of the SIAC award and so the original action that the government took in ramming the original decision through to benefit ST and forcing claimants to have to go to that additional stage, to have to go to the fourth stage, that allowed ST the time to move all of its assets back into Laos and put the claimants in a position where they would be dependent on going to Laos to enforce the award against ST where the same thing, or worse, could happen. So, there was a distinct consequence at the stage of the measure relating to the Thanaleng proceeding in 2012.\n\nEven if the claimant could then go on to the SIAC proceeding, which it did, there was still a consequence and there was still harm caused by that action, because being able to go to the fourth tier, that didn't right the ship. That didn't enable Sanum to have a clear path to recovery. So there's still consequences to what the government did in 2012.\"105\n\nAmended Transcript, 7 September 2018, p. 40, 19-25 to p. 41, 1-17.\n\n187.\n\nThe Claimants want to skip over the fact that Sanum has a valid arbitral award against a private party in which it was awarded 200 million dollars after it exhausted the remedies in the Lao Courts for the alleged interference of the Respondent in the Lao Commercial Court back in 2012. The alleged inability to enforce the award is not before this Tribunal and it has not been proven by the Claimants that \"there was a distinct consequence [of the Government's alleged interference] at the stage of the measure relating to the Thanaleng proceeding in 2012.\"106 There is simply no persuasive evidence that the alleged interference of the Respondent in the proceeding of a lower court interfered with the steps taken by the Claimants to exercise their rights under the Master Agreement and, in particular, their recourse to SIAC arbitration.\n\nAmended Transcript, 7 September 2018, p. 41, 7-9.\n\n188.\n\nThe Claimants say their claim in the SIAC arbitration was not for the full amount of the value lost in Thanaleng. The Claimants explained why Sanum capped its claim for damages:\n\nin part because ST did not appear and that raised the issue of whether or not they were going to hide assets, such that it was fruitless to seek the full value of Thanaleng. The full value of Thanaleng, I know we're bifurcated so we're not going to talk very much about those kind of things, but the full value of Thanaleng is more than 400 million in order to not have the fees, and in light of the practical recognition that ST was likely hiding its assets, we capped the SIAC claim at 200 million. So it won't be possible to recover the full amount from ST to cover the cost of the damage that the government caused by directing the Thanaleng case in Laos.107\n\nAmended Transcript, 3 September 2018, p. 125, 3-16.\n\n189.\n\nThe Respondent is not responsible for the decision of the Claimants to self-limit the amount of the claim against ST. The evidence does not establish any improper interference by the Respondent in the court proceedings.\n\n190.\n\nIn sum, the Tribunal concludes that the claim for expropriation in respect of the Thanaleng investment lacks any merit.\n\n**7.2. Paksong Vegas Hotel and Casino**\n\n191.\n\nAlthough the Claimants have in this instance put their focus on Sanum's contractual rights, LHNV is also involved as Sanum's parent, and is equally subject to the Respondent's defence of lack of good faith and lack of clean hands in both the ICSID and PCA proceedings, sufficient to disqualify the Claimants or either of them from any Treaty remedy. Further, the Tribunal accepts the invitation of counsel for the Claimants to consider \"the totality\" of the facts as relevant to the Treaty breaches for which LHNV seeks relief, and in particular the presence or absence of good faith in respect of LHNV's direct and indirect investments in Laos.\n\n**7.2.1. Background**\n---------------------\n\n192.\n\nOn 10 August 2007, a Project Development Agreement was concluded between Lao PDR, and Sanum, the Laotian company Nouansavanh Construction Co. Ltd., and Mr. Sittixay Xaysana for the development of the Paksong casino (\"**Paksong PDA**\"). Under the Paksong PDA, a Laotian entity, Paksong Vegas and Casino Co. Ltd., was set up with Lao PDR holding 20%, Sanum 60% and the ST entities 20%. The Paksong PDA required the Company to build and operate a $25 million hotel casino and golf resort in the Paksong district of Champasak Province.\n\n**7.2.2. Location of Paksong**\n------------------------------\n\n193.\n\nAs explained by the Claimants, the location was challenging:\n\n\"The challenges were both logistical and commercial. Logistically, Paksong's location meant that transportation of construction materials would be more costly than at the Savan Vegas site, as access to the site was more difficult and time consuming, and that other construction costs would be significantly higher than those of Savan Vegas. Also, the concession was located on the side of a large hill which precluded the building of simple, large buildings to house the hotel and casino and other amenities. Commercially, since Paksong was not located on the border with Thailand or even in a population center in Laos that was easy to access, it lacked a readily identifiable customer base. The challenges of attracting customers made it difficult to identify the optimal type of facility to construct on the site.\"108\n\n*(Respondent's Opening Submission Slide, 96)*\n\nSanum Statement of Claim, para. 63 (PCA Proceeding) as referred by the Parties before this Tribunal for \"the totality\" of the facts, see *supra* paras. 3 and 191.\n\n194.\n\nMr. Baldwin testified about the problem posed by Paksong's distance from the Thai border:\n\nAnother challenge posed by Paksong Vegas had to do with its customer base. Because Lao citizens generally are restricted from playing table games, the customer base for our casinos consists largely of Thai citizens who live in Northeastern Thailand. However, because Paksong Vegas would be located deep in Laos's interior, without easy access to the border, we were concerned that it would be difficult to attract customers to the casino.109\n\nSanum First Witness Statement of Mr. John Baldwin, 1 October 2013, para. 32, as referred by the Parties before this Tribunal for \"the totality\" of the facts, see supra paras. 3 and 191.\n\n195.\n\nThese challenges notwithstanding, Mr. John Baldwin testified that the Paksong project package \"came with very valuable benefits. Chief among these were the monopoly gaming rights in Champasak and Salavan Provinces granted to Paksong Vegas under the PDA.\"110\n\n*Ibid*., para. 64.\n\n196.\n\nDue to the challenges posed by the site, on 31 March 2008, Paksong Vegas proposed to the provincial government, *inter alia*, to move the entire project to the area near Chong Mek. On 29 April 2008, the proposal was rejected by the provincial government.\n\n197.\n\nOn 21 August 2008, the office of the Prime Minister advised that Paksong Vegas was to return Paksong and pursue only the project at Khone Phapheng (where the Government also favoured development) together with other interested parties. The notice from the Champasak Provincial Office requested Sanum \"to follow the agreements already reached by higher authority and only do the work at Kilometer 30 in Paksong. (According to instructions from the Government Secretariat, if the company cannot comply, then the project must be placed on hold for now).\"111 The notice added that \"[i]t is not approved to open casino branches in Paksong and other places, only at Khone Phapheng. The Paksong land (Kilometer 30) will be returned to the Government.\"112\n\nNotice from Champasak Provincial Office conveying denial of the proposed relocation of \"higher authority\" Exhibit C(S)-309, as referred by the Parties before this Tribunal for \"the totality\" of the facts, see supra paras. 3 and 191\n\nExhibit C(S)-311, as referred by the Parties before this Tribunal for \"the totality\" of the facts, see *supra* paras. 3 and 191.\n\n198.\n\nOn 23 October 2008, the Prime Minister's Office issued a notice, purporting to strip Paksong Vegas of its monopoly rights. The Prime Minister's Office also reiterated that Yingsoksay, the operator of the existing hotel and resort in the area, could look for other foreign investors to develop Khone Phapheng; Paksong Vegas could participate in that development if it chose to do so, but either way, according to the Prime Minister's Office, it no longer had the exclusive right to do so. Further, on 19 December 2008, Champasak provincial authorities instructed Paksong Vegas to return the land concession it had been granted so it could be used for \"another purpose,\" referencing the Prime Minister's 21 August 2008 notice.113\n\n*Ibid*., para. 76.\n\n199.\n\nOn 30 January 2009, a meeting was held in the MPI's offices. It was attended by all Lao agencies concerned and Paksong Vegas. The Paksong Vegas and Casino Development Project and the Khone Phapheng Entertainment Complex Project Development were discussed. The Tribunal will re-visit this meeting in its analysis.\n\n200.\n\nOn 27 April 2010, the MPI terminated the PDA because Paksong Vegas had not signed a land concession agreement in accordance with Article 4 of the PDA, and construction on the project had been delayed for more than two years, which affected the \"social-economic development plan of Champasak province.\"114 Termination of the PDA was re-affirmed by the Respondent on 10 April 2012.\n\nStatement of Claim, para. 82, as referred by the Parties before this Tribunal for \"the totality\" of the facts, see *supra* paras. 3 and 191.\n\n201.\n\nThe Respondent claims that Sanum was not a ready, willing and able investor for the Paksong project. The Claimants argue that the Respondent ignores the evidence that Lao authorities had ordered Sanum to cease construction and two years later without prior notice cancelled the PDA on grounds of failing to develop the land. According to the Respondent, Sanum did not dispute the concession because the location was not commercially acceptable. The Respondent explains that Paksong and Savannakhet were linked; they were part of a bargain: whoever would develop Savannakhet, an excellent commercial site, must also develop the less attractive Paksong. The provincial government was keen to develop the remote areas while Sanum was interested only in more profitable sites; the interests of Sanum as a commercial developer and of the provincial government were not aligned.\n\n202.\n\nMr. Baldwin wanted to develop a site at Chong Mek. He agreed that the monopoly rights were limited to the Paksong development area and did not include Chong Mek, \"unless the government agreed to modify this. The way it's written right now, it does not include Chong Mek but it doesn't say we can't ask for modifications.\"115 Mr. Baldwin appeared to be following a strategy of bait and switch.\n\nAmended Transcript, 4 September 2018, p. 216, 19-22.\n\n203.\n\nThe terms of the notice rejecting the proposal affirm that at the time the Government's intention was not to terminate the PDA, but to request that the existing agreements be respected.\n\n204.\n\nThe Claimant admitted, at the meeting of 30 January 2009, that \"it has not carried out the Paksong Vegas project as scheduled in the contract and as it was presented to the Province.\" **Mr. Baldwin confirmed at the Hearing that no contract to build a $25 million five-star hotel with a casino and nightclub was ever signed.**116\n\nAmended Transcript, 5 September 2018, p. 63, 4-7.\n\n205.\n\nPaksong Vegas had not made the investment it had promised in the PDA within the required timeframe as admitted by Mr. Baldwin and, in the Tribunal's view, never intended to.\n\n**7.2.3. The Tribunal's Analysis**\n----------------------------------\n\n206.\n\nOn Mr. Baldwin's own admission, the Claimants never believed that the Paksong site could be developed on commercially attractive terms. The Claimants' argument that work was being done and, if not done, was due to the Government order to stop the work is not credible. Accordingly, while the issue of the expropriation of the Paksong Vegas investment is not before this Tribunal as such, and this Tribunal does not purport to decide any issue which is not before it, nevertheless the underlying facts of the Paksong Vegas venture reinforce the Respondent's general defence that Mr. Baldwin's relationship with Laos was throughout characterized by bad faith. To the extent necessary to determine the bad faith issues, and for that purpose alone, the Tribunal finds on a careful review of the facts that not only has LHNV failed to demonstrate any lack of good faith on the part of the Respondent in respect of Paksong Vegas but, on the contrary, concludes that Mr. Baldwin negotiated throughout his dealings with the Respondent in bad faith and that such bad faith is to be attributed to LHNV on the basis that as the directing mind of LHNV, the parent of Sanum, Mr. Baldwin's conduct was and is its conduct.\n\n**7.3. Paksan Slot Club**\n-------------------------\n\n207.\n\nAlthough the Claimants' primary focus is on Sanum in respect of Paksan, LHNV is also implicated as Sanum's parent, and the Paksan episode is relevant to the Respondent's allegation that the entirety of the Claimants' investments in Laos was tainted from first to last by bad faith.\n\n**7.3.1. Background**\n---------------------\n\n208.\n\nAs told by Sanum and not disputed by the Respondent, the relevant facts are that \"[s]oon after Sanum agreed to partner with ST, it discovered that there was an existing slot club in operation in the Paksan district of Bolikhamxay Province - one of the provinces in which Savan Vegas has the exclusive right to operate. To enforce that exclusive right, ST asked the Government of Bolikhamxay Province to shut down the club, and it did so.\"117 The existence of the slot club led Savan Vegas to open its own club at the same location, the Paksan Hotel.\n\nSanum Statement of Claim, para. 89, as referred by the Parties before this Tribunal for \"the totality\" of the facts, see *supra* para. 3.\n\n209.\n\nThe **Ministry of Information and Culture** (\"**MIC**\") granted Savan Vegas a one-year license to operate a slot club in the Bolikhamxay Province on 24 October 2007. The MIC renewed the license on 26 November 2008.\n\n210.\n\nAfter the lease of the former club expired in October 2008, Savan Vegas signed its own lease on 25 December 2008 and refurbished the space in the Paksan Hotel formerly occupied by the slot club. The club re-opened on 25 October 2009 and the MIC renewed the slot license for another year on 27 October 2009.\n\n211.\n\nOn 18 February 2010, the Prime Minister's Office ordered the slot club license to be cancelled: \"The authorization to open an electronic gaming club granted to Savan Vegas Ltd. by the Information and Culture Department of Bolikhamxay Province is not in accordance with regulations in that it exceeds the authority of that office. Therefore, you should stop operation of electronic gaming at Paksan Hotel. Further, the company is no longer authorized to erect an advertising billboard in Bolikhamxay Province.\"118\n\nExhibit C(S)-326, p. 3, as referred by the Parties before this Tribunal for \"the totality\" of the facts, see *supra* para. 3.\n\n212.\n\nThe license was not renewed in 2010. On 11 March 2011, the Government ordered the MIC and the provincial Governor to close the club within three days. The club closed on 13 March 2011. Sanum and Savan Vegas petitioned the Prime Minister to re-open the club. The petition was denied on 19 May 2011 and Savan Vegas was ordered to comply with Notice No. 305.\n\n**7.3.2. The Tribunal's Analysis**\n----------------------------------\n\n213.\n\nThe Tribunal concludes that the license granted in 2009 had expired in October 2010 and had not been renewed. Monopoly rights kept competitors out but did not entitle Savan Vegas to establish and operate other gambling facilities unless those other facilities were specifically authorized. The Claimants have not shown that Savan Vegas had a right to the license's renewal or even that it attempted to renew the license.\n\n214.\n\nAt the time the Paksan slot club closed, the club was operating without a license and there is no documentary evidence that the Respondent had created any legitimate expectation in the Claimants that the license would be renewed or that it may operate *de facto* as if it had a license. The Claimants' argument about a *de facto* license begs the question of why Sanum had applied for the license's renewal in the preceding years. The Tribunal concludes that the license expired on its own terms and had terminated when the slot club was ordered to be closed. The Tribunal accordingly concludes, as with the Paksong Vegas expropriation claim, that while the Paksan slot club expropriation claim is not before this Tribunal as such, the underlying facts bear directly on the allegations of bad faith on the part of the Respondent asserted before this Tribunal by the Claimant, LHNV. The Tribunal finds on a careful review of the facts that LHNV has failed to demonstrate any lack of good faith on the part of the Respondent in respect to Paksan, but on the contrary that Mr. Baldwin's bad faith activity is to be attributed to LHNV, Sanum's parent, on the basis that Mr. Baldwin is the directing mind of LHNV and his conduct is attributable to LHNV.\n\n**7.4. Thakhet Casino and Hotel Resort**\n----------------------------------------\n\n215.\n\nIn this situation, as well, the Claimants and the Government accuse each other of bad faith. Mr. Baldwin, the directing mind of both Claimants, testified at length about the bad faith treatment he received from the Government in respect of Thakhet. The Government, on the other hand, presents Thakhet as further proof that Mr. Baldwin and LHNV were bad faith investors who are not entitled to treaty protection. These cross allegations are relevant to LHNV's Treaty claims.\n\n216.\n\nIn 2010, Sanum started negotiations with the Committee for the Laos-Thailand Friendship Bridge III Economic Zone Development (the \"SEZ\" and the \"SEZ Committee\") for a land concession at the foot of a planned bridge to cross the Mekong River. The negotiations resulted in a MOU between Sanum and the SEZ Committee dated 20 October 2010. The MOU contemplated a land concession to Sanum of about 90 hectares in the SEZ, payment by Sanum of US $900,000 to allow the provincial government to compensate individuals occupying the land, and US $400,000 to be paid upon signature of the MOU. The MOU required Sanum to sign a land concession within 30 days and secure all necessary approvals from the central and local governments within one year prior to building on the concession land.\n\n217.\n\nOn 4 February 2011, Savan Vegas submitted a proposal for a slot club to the Governor of the Khammouane Province and the MIC. The proposal was supported by the Governor and, on 21 February 2011, the MIC approved the Savan Vegas's Welcome Center and Slot Club. Shortly thereafter, on 2 March 2011, the Prime Minister's Office directed the MIC to revoke its approval because slot club licenses may only be issued \"by the Government\" which was interpreted by the Prime Minister to mean the Prime Minister's Office.119 On 29 March 2011, Sanum and Savan Vegas petitioned the Prime Minister's Office to grant permission to open the Welcome Center and Slot Club in the SEZ. The petition was rejected in October 2011.\n\nNotice from the Prime Minister's Office to the of Information and Culture, 2 March 2011, Exhibit C(B)-337.\n\n218.\n\nIt was decided in the Tribunal's ruling on the Merits of the Claimant's Second Material Breach Application that, in the Tribunal's view,\n\nthe Claimants have not established a land entitlement that includes the disputed 16 hectares, and there is no undertaking by the Government in Section 22 to use its powers of eminent domain to expropriate the existing private owners for the financial benefit of the Claimant. Refusal to expropriate private land for the private gain of the Claimant does not constitute evidence of 'bad faith.'120\n\nDecision on the Merits of Claimants' Second Material Breach Application, 15 December 2017, para. 207.\n\n219.\n\nThis decision was reached by the Tribunal in the context of whether the Government breached Article 22 of the Deed of Settlement by failing to negotiate the Thakhet related agreements in good faith. The Tribunal considers that the Claimants have also failed to establish rights to the remainder of the land referred to in the MOU. Sanum had 365 days from the date of the Land Concession Agreement to seek all the approvals for all investment activities described in the MOU. In turn, before the Land Concession Agreement could be signed, Sanum needed to complete a Feasibility Study, a Master Plan and a Socio-Economic and Environmental Impact Study for the Land Concession, all to be approved by the Concessioner. The Land Concession Agreement required by the MOU was never signed; it never went beyond the negotiation stage. Despite face to face negotiations over the PDA throughout the summer and fall of 2011, Sanum and the SEZ Committee had not finalized the terms of the PDA, including the land concession.121 In the overall picture, whether or not Sanum had obtained a licence had no impact on the viability of its Thakhaek project.\n\nSanum Reply, para. 182, see also Exhibit RE-101, as referred by the Parties before this Tribunal for \"the totality\" of the facts, see *supra* para. 3.\n\n220.\n\nIn the view of the Tribunal it is clear from the MOU that Savan Vegas could not expand to Thakhaek in the Kammouane Province without the \"**final approval from all governmental authorities (central and local)**.\"122 The MOU provides for the eventuality that the approval is forthcoming and also in case it is not.123 Furthermore, the MOU subjects the exact location of the Concession Land to a future agreement: \"Once the exact location of the Concession Land has been agreed upon, the Concessionee will confirm its acceptance of the Concession Land in writing to the Concessioner.\"124 There was never any agreement in this respect.\n\nExhibit RE-101, clause 2.3(c).\n\nExhibit RE-101, clauses 2.3(c) and (d).\n\nExhibit RE-101, clause 3.1.\n\n**7.4.1. The Tribunal's Analysis**\n----------------------------------\n\n221.\n\nThe MOU shows that Savan Vegas' monopoly rights did not encompass a right to establish slot clubs or casinos beyond the area covered by the Savan Vegas PDA:\n\nIf the Concessionee would like to expand the casino or slot business of Savan Vegas, which is an investment project of Sanum Investments Limited according to the Foreign Investment License no. 09507 [not readable], dated 17 August 2007 to the Concession Land to be a branch (Welcome Center) of Savan Vegas *such expansion shall be proposed, approved and agreed in writing from the Government* first before implementing such expansion. The Khammouane Province wilfully [sic] support the expansion of Savan Vegas to the Land Concession according to the appropriate procedures and regulations.125\n\nExhibit RE-101, clause 3.3.\n\n222.\n\nAs regards the slot license, the Tribunal notes that the Respondent's witnesses from the MIC and the Government Secretariat Office have claimed that the license was issued by mistake.126 The Respondent has argued that the MIC had no authority to issue the license because of Notice No. 1957 of the Prime Minister and says that the license was procured by a bribe. Leaving aside the issue of the bribes allegedly paid by the Claimants, the Tribunal observes that the license was effective for less than ten days and that the revocation was justified on the lack of authority of the MIC to grant it. The Tribunal appreciates that Notice No. 1957 refers to the Government and is not explicitly limited to the Prime Minister's office but by 2011 Sanum was fully aware that the Prime Minister's Office was the essential authority on the Claimants' gambling ventures in Laos. The Prime Minister's Office never approved the Claimants' gambling project in Thakhaek. The Claimants had just finished a bruising encounter with the Government over the Claimants' failure to fulfill its obligations in respect of the Paksong Hotel and Casino project. By 2011, the Claimants had entirely failed to live up to their Paksong commitments, while pretending otherwise. The Claimants had demonstrated themselves not to be good faith investors.\n\nSanum Reply, para. 316, fn 767, as referred by the Parties before this Tribunal for \"the totality\" of the facts, see *supra* para. 3.\n\n223.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, the Claimants were seeking in bad faith (even if not by bribes) to manipulate Government officials to obtain approvals to which the Claimants were not entitled. It is significant that the MIC licence was issued to Sanum in February 2011 by the same Minister who was ordered to cancel the Paksan license for lack of authority one year earlier in February 2010.\n\n224.\n\nNegotiations for the renewal of the Flat Tax Agreement had stalled by March 2011. The Government was agitating for accountability in respect of its 20% interest in Savan Vegas. The Claimants allege that the 16-hectare parcel on Highway 13 was essential to the success of their Thakhaek project, yet negotiations for the 16-hectare parcel never reached agreement in the Tribunal's view.\n\n225.\n\nThe Tribunal concludes that there is insufficient evidence of bad faith on either side in respect of Thakhek. It was simply a commercial possibility that never reached the stage of agreement.\n\n**8. VIOLATION OF OTHER TREATY RIGHTS**\n---------------------------------------\n\n226.\n\nThe Treaty claims are brought by the Claimant LHNV under the Netherlands-Lao BIT. Nevertheless, the allegations of bad faith and treaty violations extend to the Government's treatment of all of the Claimants' investments, as well as the Government's defence of its treatment of all of the LHNV and Sanum investments. Again, the Tribunal recalls the submission by counsel for the Claimants that \"the totality of the facts remains relevant to certain treaty breaches for which the Claimants will seek relief.\"127 However, in this part 8, where reference is made to the \"Claimant\" (singular), it refers to LHNV only.\n\nLetter dated 26 March 2018 from Claimant to the Tribunal.\n\n**8.1The Claimant's Allegations of Unfair and Inequitable Treatment**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n227.\n\nLHNV contends that it was denied fair and equitable treatment pursuant to Article 3(1) of the Treaty in respect of Thanaleng.\n\n228.\n\nWith respect to the fair and equitable treatment claims, the Claimant contends that even if the applicable standard is no higher than the minimum standard of treatment under customary international law as contended by the Respondent, the Claimant should succeed because there has been \"a gross denial of justice, manifest arbitrariness, blatant unfairness, a complete lack of due process, evident discrimination, or a manifest lack of reasons.\"128\n\n*Glamis Gold, Ltd. v. the United States of America*, UNCITRAL (1976), Award, 8 June 2009, at para. 616, Exhibit LHRA-73.\n\n229.\n\nThe Claimant alleges that Respondent also violated Article 3(4) of the Treaty (Umbrella Clause Claims) by repudiating its contractual obligations as follows:\n\n(a) the Respondent imposed construction and brokerage taxes and overtime fees in violation of the FTA;129 and\n\n(b) the audit of Savan Vegas violated provisions in the Shareholders' Agreement and in the PDA that protected Savan Vegas from unreasonable document and information requests.130\n\nClaimant's Memorial, para. 243.\n\nClaimant's Memorial, para. 242.\n\n230.\n\nThe Claimant further alleges that Respondent inflicted discriminatory and less favourable treatment on Sanum and its investments (in relation to Articles 3(1), 3(2) and 4 of the Treaty) with the following measures:\n\n(a) by imposing a 30% tax rate on the Ferry Terminal Slot Club, which was over 100 times more than the 0.22% rate charged to ST;131\n\n(b) by assisting ST in ejecting Sanum from its Thanaleng joint venture investment;132\n\n(c) by pursuing an unlawful audit by E&Y which favoured ST over Sanum by facilitating ST's attack on Sanum's management of Savan Vegas.133\n\nClaimant's Memorial, para. 249.\n\nClaimant's Memorial, paras. 211-214.\n\nClaimant's Memorial, paras. 192201 and 213.\n\n231.\n\nIn respect of the Thanaleng Slot Club (in relation to Article 3(1) and 6 of the Treaty):\n\n(a) the Respondent deprived the Claimant of the benefit of its investment through arbitrary, unfair and discriminatory court proceedings that lacked any semblance of due process and by the participation of its law enforcement officials in physically evicting Sanum personnel and machines from Thanaleng;134\n\n(b) by the same conduct, the Respondent also violated both the fair and equitable treatment and the unreasonable or discriminatory impairment standards contained in Article 3(1) of the BIT.135\n\nClaimant's Memorial, paras. 61-94, 219-223; Claimant's Reply, paras. 23-109.\n\nClaimant's Memorial, paras. 178-190, Claimant's Reply, paras. 155-160.\n\n**8.2. The Onus of Proof**\n--------------------------\n\n232.\n\nThe Claimant accepts both the legal onus and the evidentiary onus of establishing one or more treaty breaches on a balance of probabilities.\n\n**8.3. The Claimant's Lack of Good Faith**\n------------------------------------------\n\n233.\n\nMuch of the Claimants' case rests on the allegation that it proceeded in all respects in good faith but was thwarted at every turn by a corrupt and devious Government acting in bad faith. On the contrary, in the Tribunal's view the evidence is clear that the Claimants dealt in bad faith with the Government from the initial signing of the Paksong Hotel and Casino PDA calling for a US $25 million hotel and casino and thereafter included the financial irregularities in the operation of the Savan Vegas Hotel and Casino. The Claimants never intended to build a US $25 million facility in Paksong. From the Claimants' perspective, the benefit of the Paksong PDA was a monopoly to block other more serious investors from offering gambling facilities in Champaska and Salavan Provinces. Having obtained the monopoly, the Claimants attempted to force the Government's hand in relocating the project to what, from the Government's perspective, was a much less attractive site. The bad faith continued through the disputes over the Savan Vegas Hotel and Casino, which was built but operated in defiance of Sanum's reporting obligations to the Government (and, when the books were eventually opened, revealed significant financial irregularities). The bad faith continued with Mr. Baldwin's recent efforts to deter Madam Sengkeo's appearance to testify at the merits proceeding and the sham MaxGaming offer to purchase Savan Vegas in April of 2015.\n\n234.\n\nThe principle of good faith arises in investment treaty arbitrations in various contexts. Tribunals, of course, regularly refer to Article 31(1) of the *Vienna Convention* for the rule that treaties shall be interpreted in good faith. The obligation extends to a duty of parties to arbitrate in good faith.136 In *Phoenix v. Czech Republic*, the tribunal referred to Phoenix's \"initiation and pursuit of this arbitration\" as \"an abuse of the system of international ICSID investment arbitration.\"137 (The tribunal found an abuse of rights in that case by the \"claimant's creation of a legal fiction in order to gain access to an international arbitration procedure to which it was not entitled.\"138)\n\n*Libananco Holdings Co Limited v. Republic of Turkey*, ICSID Case No. ARB/06/8, Final Award, Exhibit CLA-168, where good faith was discussed in the context of the alleged interception and surveillance by Turkish police of legally privileged communications between the claimant, its counsel and witnesses. See also Born, *International Commercial Arbitration* at pp. 1008-1014 and *Methanex Corporation v. United States of America*, UNCITRAL (1976), Final Award, Exhibit CLA-259.\n\n*Phoenix Action, Ltd. v. The Czech Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/06/5, at para. 144, Exhibit RA-25.\n\n*Ibid*., para. 143.\n\n235.\n\nThe Tribunal listened carefully to the testimony of Mr. John Baldwin and found him to be an argumentative witness who preferred evasion to candour. Much of his testimony was simply not credible. He proceeded in bad faith from the outset in assuring the Government that he intended to invest US $25 million at the Paksong site, which by his own account would have been highly unprofitable.\n\n236.\n\nMr. Baldwin is the directing mind of both Claimant companies. His conduct throughout was to advance their corporate interests. His bad faith conduct is their conduct. While the Government's conduct was at times aggressive and inappropriate in relation to the Settlement (as documented, for example, in the Second Material Breach Application), nevertheless the Claimants failed to establish that the Government acted in bad faith in relation to the investors or the investments during the time period covered by this revived arbitration.\n\n237.\n\nIt is well established that the bad faith conduct of the investor is relevant to the grant of relief under an investment treaty.139\n\nSee UNCTAD Series on International Agreements III, *Fair and Equitable Treatment* (2012) at pp. 83-85:  \nInvestor conduct has emerged as a relevant factor in the analysis of FET claims by arbitral tribunals. It may be relevant in two ways. First, **it may justify the measure taken against the investor by the respondent country**. Thus in *Genin v. Estonia*, the tribunal found that the Estonian national bank had good reasons to revoke the operating license of the claimant's investment because the claimant had failed to disclose relevant facts. In such cases, the adverse measure serves as a State's reaction to, or a sanction for the investor's conduct\u2026 **Fraud or misrepresentation on the part of an investor may form the basis of a legitimate regulatory interference with its rights. In such cases, even the outright termination of the investment may be justified, provided it is a proportionate response to the investor's conduct in light of the relevant domestic laws of the host State**...in some situations, an investor's own conduct may be held to be a cause for the harm suffered.\n\n238.\n\nTo summarize, the particular acts of bad faith by Mr. Baldwin on behalf of the Claimants of most concern to the Tribunal are:\n\n(A) misrepresentations made to the Government to obtain Paksong Hotel and Casino PDA on the strength of a promise to make a US $25 million investment on the site which, in the Tribunal's view, the Claimants never intended to pursue;\n\n(b) likely making illegal payments to Government officials to stop the E&Y audit of the Savan Vegas Hotel and Casino;\n\n(c) likely attempting to obstruct justice with the payment of US $875,000 to Madam Sengkeo directed, as to US $575,000 to the obstruction of the due process of this arbitration by paying Madam Sengkeo not to testify;\n\n(d) attempting to mislead the Treaty Tribunals with the sham offer to purchase the Savan Vegas from MaxGaming Consulting.140\n\nAlthough the MaxGaming incident occurred after the date of Settlement, it was fully debated at the Hearing and formed part of the corpus of the bad faith allegations.\n\n239.\n\nAs will be seen, the Claimant's allegations of the other treaty violations (in addition to expropriation) also fail on the facts. However, having listened to Mr. Baldwin's explanations over several hearings of his dealings with Laos, the Tribunal wishes to leave in no doubt its conclusion that Mr. Baldwin and LHNV exhibited manifest bad faith in various efforts not only to manipulate the Government to advance their gambling initiatives but, in the instance of Madam Sengkeo, to manipulate the arbitration process itself.\n\n**8.4. Alleged Wrongful Treatment of the Thanaleng Investment**\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\n240.\n\nAt issue are the proceedings before the Courts of Laos between Sanum and ST. The Claimants allege that they were denied due process to a level that constituted a denial of justice.\n\n**8.4.1. The Claimant's Argument**\n----------------------------------\n\n241.\n\nIn respect of the Thanaleng Slot Club, the Claimants contend that:\n\n(a) the Government deprived the Claimant LHNV of the benefit of its investment in Sanum through arbitrary, unfair and discriminatory court proceedings that lacked any semblance of due process and by the participation of its law enforcement officials in physically evicting Sanum personnel and machines from Thanaleng;141\n\n(b) by the same conduct, the Respondent also violated both the fair and equitable treatment and the unreasonable or discriminatory impairment standards contained in Article 3(1) of the BIT.142\n\nClaimant's Memorial, paras. 61-94, 219-223; Claimant's Reply, paras. 23-109.\n\nClaimant's Memorial, paras. 178-190, Claimant's Reply, paras. 155-160.\n\n242.\n\nWhile the origin of the court case was a \"private dispute\", the Claimants contend that their Thanaleng claims manifestly implicate the conduct of Lao judicial and executive branch officials including the Minister of Justice and the police on the spot at the time of the seizure. According to Claimants, the result was wrongful internationally because it was arbitrary, unfair, discriminatory and lacked any semblance of due process. Moreover, the Thangaleng proceedings deprived LHNV of the shareholder value of Sanum's Thanaleng investments without compensation.\n\n243.\n\nThe Claimants relied upon the expert opinion of Maitre G\u00e9rard Ngo143 who found due process violations in the Court summons to Sanum, which was made only 48 hours before the trial scheduled for 26 July 2012, the limited duration of the hearing of 26 July 2012 (90 minutes), the brevity of the judges' deliberation and the conclusion set out in the judgment which (the Claimant) argues had been decided before the hearing began.\n\nMaitre G\u00e9rard Ngo Expert Report, para. 176.\n\n244.\n\nThe Claimants allege that the Courts of Laos were controlled and interfered with by the Government against Sanum and constituted a denial of justice. The evidence for this allegation comes from Mr. Baldwin144 and Mr. Richard Pipes.145\n\nMr. Baldwin testified in his Third Witness Statement as follows:  \n118. I was eventually able to meet with Minister [Justice] Chaleun on 27 April 2012. He said that the pressure to rule against us was coming from \"high up\". I inquired who was pressuring him, noting that you could not get much higher than the Minister of Justice. I asked if it was the Prime Minister; he said no. I asked if it was the President; he said no. Then I asked if it was the Vice President, Bounnhang Vorachit, and he shrugged his shoulders. I took this to be an acknowledgement that it was the Vice President of Laos who was pressuring Minister Chaleun. I was surprised and disappointed by this sudden change in Chaleun\u2026  \nMr. John Baldwin Third Witness Statement, para. 46. See also Mr. John Baldwin Sixth Witness Statement, para. 59.\n\nMr. Pipes testified in his First Witness Statement as follows:  \n29. I should note that in several meetings I had with the Chief Judge handling the case, the Chief Judge told me that he too was under a great deal of pressure to resolve the case quickly, with a predetermined result that would not be to our benefit. At times, the Judge was almost apologetic and wanted me to understand that, when cases are filed in which powerful people in Laos have an interest, the result is often mandated by high-ranking Government officials. In fact, the Chief Judge and other Lao attorneys confirmed to me that these types of cases are referred to as \"directed ones\". At one point, the Chief Judge told me in his chambers that in our case he was \"just the driver\" and that he was being told where to go.  \nRichard Pipes First Witness Statement, para. 29.\n\n245.\n\nThe Claimants further contend that the Minister of Justice wrongfully intervened in the physical eviction of Sanum from the Thanaleng premises on 29 April 2012, thereby favouring ST, contrary to the laws governing the execution of judgments in Laos and principles of international law.\n\n**8.4.2. The Respondent's Argument**\n------------------------------------\n\n246.\n\nThe Government contends that Sanum had no cognizable interest in the Thanaleng Slot Club because the operative contract (the Temporary Thanaleng Participation Agreement dated 23 February 2010) expired on its own terms on 11 October 2011 and as the Courts of Laos correctly held, the Master Agreement dated 20 May 2007 did not create enforceable rights. The Master Agreement itself so states:\n\nThe Parties hereby agree to negotiate and work towards entering into certain joint ventures, represented by necessary agreements, which shall convey 60% of all 2nd Party's gaming business located in the country of Lao PDR (the \"Joint Ventures\"). This Agreement is not intended to be a definitive agreement but only provides the Parties' general understandings of their relationship. The Parties agree to work together in good faith to negotiate and finalize all necessary agreements to fully implement the concepts and terms set forth in this Agreement.146 (emphasis added)\n\nMaster Agreement, Exhibit C(B)-1; Respondent's Opening Submission, Slide 20.\n\n247.\n\nThe trial Court held against Sanum by its decision dated 26 July 2012,147 affirmed by the Court of Appeal on 11 December 2013148 and affirmed again by the Supreme Court of Laos on 4 April 2014, whose decision stated:\n\nThe Defendant [Sanum] claimed that once the contract with the electrical slot machine supplier expired, the main contract issued on 30 May 2007, and other contracts, should be effective immediately to cover the obligations between Sanum Investment Company (Defendant) and the HT Vegas Company Limited (Plaintiff). However, this is not the case, due to the fact that it is stated in the beginning part of the main contract, wherein it is defined, that **this contract has no intent to be a strict contract**, as it is only to support the parties toward having an overall understanding of their relationship.\n\n\u2026\n\n**This [evidence] shows that the parties cannot consider the main contract as a completed business joint venture agreement** due to this contract determining only general principles on how to develop subcontracts and agreements between both parties in all gambling joint ventures. Therefore, the parties need to renew the contract to be in compliance with the main contract issued on 30 May 2007.149 (emphasis added)\n\nCourt Decision, 26 July 2012, Case No. 11/PC, VTC, p. 5, Exhibit C(B)-34, Respondent's Opening Submission, slide 21.\n\nJudgment, Commercial Chamber Panel of the People's Court in the Central Region, No. 71/CC.A, p. 9, Exhibit C(B)-486, Respondent's Opening Submission, Slide 22.\n\nLao Supreme Court Judgment, *ST v. Sanum*, Case 52, Exhibit C-1239.\n\n248.\n\nThe Government contends that \"the proper procedures were applied under the Lao court rules. Those rules \u2026 plainly meet international standards of procedural fairness.\"150\n\nThe Respondent's legal expert, Professor Herve\u0301 Ascensio, concluded:\n\n83. On the basis of the rules of international law, and having considered the legal and factual circumstances of the case, my conclusions are the following ones:\n\n1) as far municipal legality, the domestic proceedings complied with the standard of international law;\n\n2) no violation of international law is demonstrated concerning access to an independent and impartial court;\n\n3) no violation of international law is demonstrated concerning the fundamental procedural guarantees;\n\n4) the decisions adopted on the merits by Laotian courts on the Thanaleng site do not reveal a substantive denial of justice.151\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, para. 142.\n\nProfessor Ascensio Expert Report, 4 June 2014, para. 83; Claimants' Opening Submissions, slide 66.\n\n250.\n\nRespondent contends that the Claimants' legal expert, Maitre G\u00e9rard Ngo, lacks relevant expertise and that (again according the Respondent), his criticisms were effectively rebutted by the Respondent's expert, Professor Herve\u0301 Ascensio, who expressed the view that:\n\nTaking into account the whole of the legal and factual circumstances, it does not appear manifest that the threshold of arbitrary, applicable under public international law, was crossed.152\n\nProfessor Ascensio Expert Report, 4 June 2014, at paras. 51-52.\n\n251.\n\nThe Government considers that there is no credible evidence that it interfered with the Court proceedings.\n\n252.\n\nSanum was afforded due process in knowing the case it had to meet and every opportunity to lead evidence and make submissions in its own defence.\n\n**8.4.3. The Tribunal's Ruling**\n--------------------------------\n\n253.\n\nThe Tribunal's role is to apply international law, not the domestic law of Laos. It has no jurisdiction to sit on appeal from the Courts of Laos. As stated by the *Arif v. Moldova* tribunal:\n\nThe Tribunal is not in a position and has no competence to take sides in this controversy. If it tried, it would indeed sit as a court of appeal over decisions of the Moldovan judiciary.153\n\n*Mr. Franck Charles Arif v. Republic of Moldova*, ICSID Case No. ARB/11/23, Award, at paras. 481, Exhibit CLA(LH)-041.\n\n254.\n\nThe decision of three levels of Laotian courts on the interpretation of the Master Contract went against Sanum, and in the Tribunal's view, neither the interpretation given by those Courts to the agreements nor the judicial process offended international standards.154\n\nAs stated by the *Jan de Nul N.V. and Dredging International N.V. v. Arab Republic of Egypt*, ICSID Case No. ARB/04/13, Award, para. 209:  \nIt is not the role of a tribunal constituted on the basis of a BIT to act as a court of appeal for national courts. The task of the Tribunal is rather to determine whether the Judgment is \"clearly improper and discreditable\" in the words of the *Mondev* tribunal.  \nProfessor Ascensio Expert Report, Exhibit PJ-24.\n\n255.\n\nThe Tribunal heard the *viva voce* testimony of Judge Soulideth Souvannasaly, one of the judges who heard the Sanum case at first instance. He disputed Mr. Pipes' evidence about Government interference155 and testified that, contrary to Mr. Pipes' Witness Statement, Sanum did not press its earlier request for an adjournment when its case came on for a hearing.156\n\nJudge Soulideth testified:\n\nJudge Soulideth further testified:  \nQ. You received a request for postponement from Sanum on 25 July 2012. My question is: in the courtroom, on 26 July 2012, did you ask anyone representing Sanum if they wished to press their request for a postponement?  \nA. So, I asked this Sanum personally in the courtroom that, \"Do you wish to proceed or do you wish to still have that postponement that you submitted on 25 July 2012?\", but they did not \u2013 they did not say they did.  \nAmended Transcript, 6 September 2018, p. 49, 6-21.\n\n256.\n\nThe Tribunal considers 48 hours to be an excessively short notice for a trial but Judge Soulideth testified that when the trial was called, Sanum was present in Court and, having failed to press its request for an adjournment, there was nothing to prevent the case from proceeding and it did proceed with the participation of Sanum's representatives.\n\n257.\n\nMoreover, according to Judge Soulideth, Sanum was free to present evidence and make such submissions as it saw fit. Judge Soulideth denied that the disposition of the case had been decided prior to the hearing (contrary to the witness statement of Richard Pipes). The narrative portion of the judgment had been drafted beforehand based on the documentation (a customary practice in Laos, according to the Judge), but the \"consideration\" and \"decision\" were not written until following the panel deliberations after the hearing.157\n\nJudge Soulideth testified:  \nIt was not until our deliberation that we reached a decision and drafted the remaining part of the \"Consideration\" and the \"Decision\" section of the Court Decision (from the last line of page 4 of the Court Decision \u2013 \"\u2026this act as violation of the agreement according to Article 33 of the Contract Law.\" These can be found on pages 5 and 6 of the Court Decision.  \nJudge Soulideth Witness Statement, para. 14; Claimants' Opening Submissions, slide 72.\n\n258.\n\nThe Tribunal would have been interested in hearing from the Sanum representatives who were present at the trial but they were not called. In the circumstances, the Tribunal accepts the evidence of Judge Soulideth and rejects the allegations of the Claimants that this was a \"directed case\" whose outcome was \"mandated by high ranking Government officials\" as unproven. On the evidence, there was no breach of fair and equitable treatment or other Treaty violation, and no wrongful treatment by the judiciary of the Claimant's Thanaleng investment by denial of justice or otherwise.\n\n**8.5. Did The Respondent's Treatment of Savan Vegas Breach Articles 3(1) and 3(4) of the Treaty?**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n259.\n\nAs mentioned, the Government, which was a shareholder in the Savan Vegas project, initiated an audit by E&Y.\n\n**8.5.1. The Claimant's Argument**\n----------------------------------\n\n260.\n\nThe Claimant says that the Government's audit proceeded in bad faith and constituted one of the wrongful acts orchestrated by the Government to assist ST158 in its ongoing dispute with the Claimant. In the result, Article 3(4) of the Treaty was breached because of non-compliance with the Government's contractual obligations. Moreover, the Claimant argues, Article 3(1) was also breached because:\n\n(a) the Government's abusive exercise of authority (as Government not shareholder) was inconsistent with the good faith principle embedded in the FET standard;\n\n(b) even if not adopted for an improper purpose, measures that are arbitrary and discriminatory are also inconsistent with the FET;\n\n(c) the audit was conducted in an unreasonable manner that impaired the LHNV's enjoyment of its investment;159\n\nThe audit and tax demands were adopted to provide a pretense for ejecting Sanum from Sanum Vegas. Exhibit C(B)-424 and Exhibit C(B)-351, Claimants' Opening Submission, slide 77.\n\nClaimants' Opening Submission, slide 83.\n\n261.\n\nAs a result of the audit and other wrongful conduct, the Government is said to have imposed on Savan Vegas \"unlawful and discriminatory tax demands in the amount of US $23.8 million.\"160 Moreover, the Ferry Terminal Slot Club was taxed at a rate grossly in excess of the tax rate imposed on ST and, was therefore discriminatory.161\n\nClaimants' Memorial, para. 213.\n\n*Ibid*.\n\n**8.5.2. The Respondent's Argument**\n------------------------------------\n\n262.\n\nThe Parties settled any and all claims with respect to pre-July 2014 taxes as part of the mutual commitments contained in Article 7 of the Settlement162 which provided that:\n\nLaos shall forgive and waive any and all taxes and related interest and penalties due and payable by the Claimants and the Gaming Assets up to 1 July 2014 in respect of the Gaming Assets, provided, however, that taxes shall be due and payable as from 1 July 2014 as provided in Section 8 below. The taxes covered herein are all taxes and fees including but not limited to those that are specifically indicated in Article 1 of the previously signed FTA attached as Annex D hereto.\n\nSettlement, Section 7, Exhibit C(B)-774.\n\n263.\n\nThe Claimant accepted the tax waiver as part of the Settlement for which mutual releases were exchanged, and the Claimant cannot now complain about tax measures which are not properly part of this arbitration.\n\n264.\n\nEqually, any tax issues arising *after* 1 July 2014 are outside the scope of this arbitration.\n\n**8.5.3. The Tribunal's Ruling**\n--------------------------------\n\n265.\n\nWith respect to the E&Y audit, the Respondent had good cause for concern about the accounts of Savan Vegas. Sanum had not complied with its reporting obligations. The Claimant LHNV has failed to establish bad faith on the part of the Respondent in pushing for an audit in furtherance of its rights as a significant shareholder in Savan Vegas.\n\n266.\n\nNor was the Government conduct arbitrary. It had not received information it was owed by reason of its shareholding interest in Savan Vegas. The request for an audit was not abusive, and in the end the Government's suspicions were vindicated by the disclosure of serious financial irregularities.\n\n267.\n\nThere is no credible evidence that the E&Y audit was conducted in an unreasonable manner. Sanum's CFO, Mr. Clay Crawford, testified that E&Y made excessive information demands that interfered with the efficient operation of the business but the Tribunal heard no expert evidence from an independent auditor that E&Y departed from normal audit practice.\n\n268.\n\nMoreover, as earlier stated, the Tribunal is of the view that on a balance of probabilities Mr. Baldwin dealt in bad faith with the Government in arranging illicit payments to stop the E&Y audit prior to its completion.\n\n269.\n\nThe Claimant has not established any breach of contractual (or Treaty) obligations in respect of Savan Vegas by the Government.\n\n270.\n\nAs to the tax issues at Savan Vegas and the Ferry Terminal, it has already been pointed out that the tax waiver was effective up to and including 1 July 2014.163 The tax complaints were not revived by the outcome of the **Second Material Breach Application** which did not set aside the Settlement but implemented it.\n\nUnited Nations International Law Commission, Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts, with commentaries (2001), Exhibit CLA(LH)-087:  \nArticle 45: Loss of the right to invoke responsibility:  \nThe responsibility of a State may not be invoked if:  \n(a) the injured State has validly waived the claim;  \n(b) the injured State is to be considered as having, by reason of its conduct, validly acquiesced in the lapse of the claim.\n\n**8.6. Alleged Violations of Treaty Rights in Respect of the Paksan Slot Club, Lao Bao and the Savannakhet Ferry Dock**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n271.\n\nThe Claimant's allegations of wrongful acts and Treaty breaches in respect of these investments have already been reviewed at length in the earlier reasoning of this Award. While the Claimants did not press their complaints in respect of Lao Bao and the Savannakhet Slot Clubs at the Hearing, those complaints relate essentially to tax matters which were resolved with the 2014 Settlement. To the extent the complaints in this respect were not withdrawn, they are dismissed.\n\n**8.7. Allegation that the Respondent Violated Article 3(4) of the Treaty (Umbrella Clause Claims)**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n272.\n\nThe Claimants argue that the Government repudiated its contractual obligations as follows:\n\n(a) the Respondent imposed construction and brokerage taxes and overtime fees in violation of the FTA;164 and\n\n(b) the audit of Savan Vegas violated provisions in the Shareholders' Agreement and the PDA that protected Savan Vegas from unreasonable document and information requests.165\n\nClaimant's Memorial at para. 243.\n\nClaimant's Memorial at para. 242.\n\n273.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, for the reasons already explained:\n\n(a) the tax complaints were rendered moot by Article 7 of the Settlement;\n\n(b) the Claimant has not established that construction and brokerage taxes and overtime fees were wrongfully imposed;\n\n(c) the Claimant has not established that the Government's document and information requests in respect of Savan Vegas were unreasonable.\n\n**8.8. Allegations of Discriminatory and Less Favourable Treatment With Respect to Investments pursuant to Article 3(2) and Article 4 of the Treaty**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n274.\n\nThe Claimant alleges discriminatory and less favourable treatment with respect to Sanum and its investments:\n\n(a) by imposing a 30% tax rate on the Ferry Terminal Slot Club, which was over 100 times more than the 0.22% rate charged to ST;166\n\n(b) by assisting ST in ejecting Sanum from its Thanaleng joint venture investment;167\n\n(c) by pursuing an unlawful audit by E&Y which favoured ST over Sanum by nourishing ST's attack on Sanum's management of Savan Vegas.168\n\nClaimant's Memorial at para. 249.\n\nClaimant's Memorial at paras. 211-214.\n\nClaimant's Memorial at paras. 196, 200-201 and 213.\n\n275.\n\nThe Tribunal has already rejected complaints (b) and (c). With respect to complaint (a), Article 7 of the Settlement in respect of tax issues foreclosed any liability of the Claimant or the Government with respect to the imposition of such taxes prior to 1 July 2014, including the claim of discrimination.\n\n276.\n\nIn any event, the Claimants are in no position to complain of discrimination in the tax system when much of the efforts of the Claimants were directed at obtaining special treatment under an FTA and its extension for a further five years. To the extent other corporate entities in Laos also obtained special rates, the fact remains that the Claimant paid less tax than the law would otherwise have required, and, more importantly, whatever it owed was forgiven by the Settlement, so even if there had been breaches (which has not been shown to be the case), there was no loss or damage that could justify compensation.\n\n277.\n\nThe Claimant LHNV has failed to establish any factual foundation for its complaints of Treaty breaches in respect of Thanaleng and Savan Vegas as previously discussed.\n\n**8.9. Bad Faith**\n------------------\n\n278.\n\nWhile the Tribunal finds the Respondent's allegations of bribery lack sufficient \"clear and convincing evidence\" to justify an affirmative finding of specific acts of corruption, nevertheless the probable existence of illicit payments to Madam Sengkeo and through her to Government officials falls to be considered under the general allegation of bad faith.\n\n279.\n\nWhen the Tribunal steps back and views the Claimants' entire course of conduct at issue in these proceedings as particularized above, including the probability of corruption in the Claimants' orchestration of the termination of the E&Y audit (itself an act of bad faith), the manipulation of Government authorities to obtain a gambling licence at Thakhaek and the commitments made in the Paksong PDA without any intention of building the US $25 million hotel and casino which was its basic requirement, thereby eliminating the opportunity for other more serious investors to apply for gaming facilities in the Claimants' monopoly area, all support the conclusion that the Claimants were contemptuous of the commitments that came with the advantages of their Laotian investments. Mr. Baldwin's testimony only served to confirm the Tribunal in that unfavourable view.\n\n280.\n\nWhile the Tribunal has already rejected the Claimants' allegations for the reasons detailed above, the Claimants' bad faith initiation of some investments and bad faith performance of other investment agreements (as detailed above) and the attempt of Mr. Baldwin to compromise the integrity of this arbitration through an inducement to Madam Sengkeo not to testify provide added reasons to deny the Claimant LHNV the benefit of Treaty protection.\n\n**9. DISPOSITION ON COSTS**\n---------------------------\n\n281.\n\nThe Respondent Government claims costs for the period from 26 April 2016 through 22 February 2019 in respect of lawyers' fees and expenses in the amount of $1,467,483.72.169 These fees are exclusive of and apart from the costs sought by the Government arising out of *Sanum Investments Limited v. The Government of the Lao People's Democratic Republic*, PCA Case No. 2013-13, which was not consolidated with this case but for the most part was heard jointly with it. (The Respondent Government claims a total of US $2,780,736.03 in respect of both the ICSID and PCA proceedings). By way of comparison, the Claimants indicated that if successful (and even if not wholly successful) they would be seeking US $ 20,929,951.36 in total in respect of both the ICSID and PCA proceedings. The Claimant's claim, unlike the Respondent's claim, does include the expenses and charges of the respective Secretariats.\n\nThe Respondent reserved all rights to claim additional attorneys' fees and expenses, in particular if this Tribunal makes any further requests, including requests for further submissions\n\n282.\n\nArticle 58 of the ICSID Arbitration (AF) Rules provides:\n\n(1) Unless the parties otherwise agree, the Tribunal shall decide how and by whom the fees and expenses of the members of the Tribunal, the expenses and charges of the Secretariat and the expenses incurred by the parties in connection with the proceeding shall be borne. The Tribunal may, to that end, call on the Secretariat and the parties to provide it with the information it needs in order to formulate the division of the cost of the proceeding between the parties.\n\n(2) The decision of the Tribunal pursuant to paragraph (1) of this Article shall form part of the award.\n\n283.\n\nArticle 58 grants the Tribunal broad discretionary power to allocate costs, based on the circumstances of the case. \"While there is some variation in tribunals' practices, the prevailing approach of international investment tribunals is to order costs to follow the event.\"170 LHNV itself has accepted the application cost-shifting principle in this arbitration\u2014having already submitted its request for \"costs and expenses of this proceeding, including attorneys' fees.\"171\n\n*Cortec Mining Kenya Limited, Cortec (Pty) Limited and Stirling Capital Limited v. Republic of Kenya*, ICSID Case No. ARB/15/29, Award, 22 October 2018, \u00b6 388 (citing *Mr. Saba Fakes v. Republic of Turkey*, ICSID Case No. ARB/07/20, Award, dated 14 July 2010, \u00b6\u00b6 152-155); see, e.g., *Telenor Mobile Communications A.S. v. Republic of Hungary*, ICSID Case No. ARB/04/15, Award, dated 13 September 2006, \u00b6 107 (\"[T]his Tribunal is among those who favour the general principle that costs should follow the event.\").\n\nRespondent's Submission on Costs, \u00b66 (citing Claimant Reply, \u00b6 343).\n\n284.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, the quantum of their original claims if wholly successful, might have reached US $ 1 billion.\n\n285.\n\nThe costs claim advanced by LHNV and Sanum include US $10,109,872.71 for legal work prior to the Settlement of June 15, 2014.172 The Respondent's claim commences post-settlement, specifically from 26 April 2016.173 Thereafter, until 23 February 2017, the Respondent's claim is made only for the ICSID proceedings, as during that time only the ICSID Tribunal was active \u2013 *i.e.*, after the Claimant LHNV filed its Second Material Breach Application, but before the date the Claimant Sanum filed its Second Material Breach Application before the PCA Tribunal. From and after 23 February 2017 the two cases (ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/12/6 and PCA Case No. 2013-13) proceeded in parallel although, as mentioned, not consolidated.\n\nClaimant's Submission on Costs, Schedule A.\n\nRespondent's Submission on Costs, \u00b6 16.\n\n286.\n\nThus, after 23 February 2017, work on all written submissions, evidentiary applications, interim conferences and hearings as well as the Hearing were combined, then evenly divided as between the ICSID proceedings and the PCA proceedings. In the result, the Respondent seeks an order that the Claimant LHNV pay 50% of its legal costs, including lawyers' fees and expenses, incurred from 23 February 2017, through to the present.174\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b6\u00b6 6-9.\n\n287.\n\nThe Claimant points out that it was successful on a number of the interlocutory matters including a defeat of the Government's jurisdictional challenges and establishment in the Second Material Breach Application that the Government had failed in two important aspects to honour the Settlement, namely the establishment of a new FTA to assist in the sale of Savan Vegas, and the Government's failure to halt existing and potential criminal proceedings.175 These were important successes for the Claimants but in the end, they failed to establish after years of litigation any liability on the part of the Government in respect of any of the myriad of claims of Treaty violations (as distinguished from two breaches of the 2014 Settlement Agreement, as mentioned). In the circumstances, the Tribunal thinks it appropriate, in its discretion, to award the Respondent its lawyer fees and expenses in the sum of US $1,293,720.27.\n\nClaimant's Submission on Costs, \u00b6 29.\n\n**9.1. Expenses**\n-----------------\n\n**9.1.1. Travel Expenses**\n--------------------------\n\n288.\n\nThe Respondent's travel expenses represent travel to Brussels and Singapore twice by various witnesses and the Respondent's lawyers and staff, for matters involving the Tribunal. These travel expenses also include travel to Laos, Paris, and Hong Kong for matters such as fact development, evidence gathering and document review.176\n\nRespondent's Submission on Costs, \u00b6 18\n\n**9.1.2. Miscellaneous Services and Expenses**\n----------------------------------------------\n\n289.\n\nThe remainder of the Respondent's expenses relate to services and expenses required to pursue the arbitrations, some of which were incurred in-house and others by external vendors. Such services include translation services; court reporter and transcript fees; express delivery expenses; research; and trial preparation services in Singapore, such as copying, binding presentations, and creating witness and evidentiary notebooks.\n\n290.\n\nThe Respondent's total expenses (other than legal fees and expenses) requested in this arbitration amount to US $173,763.45.177 This sum, taken together with legal fees and expenses of US $1,293,720.27 produces a costs award of US $1,467,483.72*.*\n\nRespondent's Submission on Costs, \u00b6\u00b6 19-20.\n\n**9.2. Arbitration Costs**\n--------------------------\n\n291.\n\nThe costs of the arbitration, including the fees and expenses of the Tribunal, ICSID's administrative fees and direct expenses, amount to (in US dollars):178\n\nArbitrators' fees and expenses\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Honourable Ian Binnie | US$ 466,076.51 |\n| Prof. Bernard Hanotiau\\* | US$ 393,410.86 |\n| Prof. Brigitte Stern\\* | US$ 358,712.38 |\n| ICSID's administrative fees | US$ 244,000 |\n| Direct expenses (estimated)179 | US$273,590 |\n| **Total** | **US$ 1,735,789** |\n\nThe ICSID Secretariat will provide the parties with a Financial Statement of the case account.\n\nThe arbitrator's fees and expenses of Professor Hanotiau and Professor Stern have been equally divided between the ICSID and PCA proceedings. The amount shown here represents the ICSID portion.\n\nThe arbitrator's fees and expenses of Professor Hanotiau and Professor Stern have been equally divided between the ICSID and PCA proceedings. The amount shown here represents the ICSID portion.\n\nThis amount includes estimated charges relating to the dispatch of this Award (Courier, printing, and copying).\n\n292.\n\nThe above costs have been paid out of the advances made by the Parties which were not made in equal parts. The Claimant made advance payments for a total of US $1,274,969 and the Respondent made advances for a total of US $481,622.95. The Tribunal orders the Claimant LHNV to bear all the arbitration costs of the ICSID proceeding. Accordingly, the Tribunal orders the Claimant to pay the Respondent US$ 481,622.95 for the expended portion of the Respondent's advances to ICSID.\n\n**10. DISPOSITION**\n-------------------\n\n293.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, the Claimant LHNV has failed to meet the evidentiary onus of establishing facts necessary to support its legal arguments. The claims are therefore dismissed.\n\n294.\n\nThe Claimant shall pay the Respondent US$ 481,622.95 in arbitration costs and US$ 1,467,483.72 for the Respondent's legal representation costs and expenses."}]}
