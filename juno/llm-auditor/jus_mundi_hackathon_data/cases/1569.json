INTRODUCTION**\n-------------------\n\n1.\n\nThis case concerns a dispute filed with the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (\"**ICSID**\") pursuant to the Treaty between the United States of America and the Republic of Armenia concerning the reciprocal encouragement and protection of investment signed on September 23, 1992, and the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States (the \"**ICSID Convention**\").\n\n2.\n\nThe Claimants are Mr. Edmond Khudyan, a national of the United States of America (\"**US**\"), and Arin Capital & Investment Corp., a corporation established under the laws of the State of California in the US (collectively, the \"**Claimants**\").\n\n3.\n\nThe Claimants are represented in these proceedings by Mr. James H. Boykin and Mr. Alexander Bedrosyan of Hughes Hubbard & Reed LLP, in Washington D.C., US, and Dr. Gevorg Tumanov of ELL Partnership, in Yerevan, Armenia.\n\n4.\n\nThe Respondent is the Republic of Armenia (the \"**Respondent**\" or \"**Armenia**\").\n\n5.\n\nThe Respondent is represented in this arbitration by Ms. Susanne Schwalb of CMS Hasche Sigle, in Munich, Germany; Dr. Nicolas Wiegand, Dr. Mariel Dimsey, and Ms. Sanjna Pramod of CMS Hasche Sigle in Hong Kong; and Dr. Aram Orbelyan, Ms. Lilit Karapetyan and Ms. Ani Varderesyan of Concern Dialog Law Firm, in Yerevan, Armenia.\n\n6.\n\nThe Claimants and the Respondent are collectively referred to as the \"**Parties**.\"\n\n**II. PROCEDURAL HISTORY**\n--------------------------\n\n7.\n\nOn September 18, 2017, ICSID received a Request for Arbitration, together with Exhibits CE-01 through CE-19, from the Claimants initiating arbitration against the Respondent.\n\n8.\n\nOn September 27, 2017, the Secretary-General of ICSID registered the Request for Arbitration pursuant to Article 36(3) of the ICSID Convention.\n\n9.\n\nOn March 15, 2018, the Tribunal was constituted in accordance with the method of constitution agreed to by the Parties. Its members are: Ms. Melanie Van Leeuwen (Dutch), President, appointed by the Parties; Ms. Ank Santens (Belgian), appointed by the Claimants; and Professor Zachary Douglas QC (Australian), appointed by the Respondent.\n\n10.\n\nOn April 7, 2018, the Secretary of the Tribunal transmitted to the Parties a draft Procedural Order No. 1 and a draft agenda in advance of the first session.\n\n11.\n\nOn April 19, 2018, the Parties jointly submitted their comments on the draft Procedural Order No. 1. In the revised draft the Claimants identified their representatives as follows: Mr. James H. Boykin and Mr. Alexander Bedrosyan.\n\n12.\n\nOn April 22, 2018, the Parties jointly submitted a proposed timetable for the proceedings.\n\n13.\n\nOn April 24, 2018, the first session was held by telephone conference. The following persons participated in the conference on behalf of the Parties:\n\nParticipating on behalf of the Claimants :  \nMr. James H. Boykin, Hughes Hubbard & Reed LLP  \nMr. Alexander Bedrosyan, Hughes Hubbard & Reed LLP\n\nParticipating on behalf of the Respondent :  \nMs. Susanne Schwalb, CMS Hasche Sigle  \nDr. Nicolas Wiegand, CMS Hasche Sigle, Hong Kong LLP  \nDr. Mariel Dimsey, CMS Hasche Sigle, Hong Kong LLP  \nMs. Sanjna Pramod, CMS Hasche Sigle, Hong Kong LLP  \nDr. Aram Orbelyan, Concern Dialog Law Firm  \nMs. Lilit Karapetyan, Concern Dialog Law Firm\n\n14.\n\nBy email of May 30, 2018, the Claimants updated the list of their representatives pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule 18 and requested that Dr. Gevorg Tumanov of ELL Partnership be added as counsel of record.\n\n15.\n\nOn May 31, 2018, the Secretary of the Tribunal transmitted to the Parties a revised draft Procedural Order No. 1 including an updated list of the Parties' representatives, along with draft timetables for the proceedings.\n\n16.\n\nOn June 6, 2018, the Parties confirmed their agreement with the timetables annexed to the revised draft Procedural Order No. 1.\n\n17.\n\nOn June 7, 2018, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 1 providing *inter alia* directions on the subsequent conduct of the arbitration.\n\n18.\n\nBy letter of June 27, 2018, the Respondent objected to the addition of Dr. Tumanov as counsel of record for the Claimants, alleging that he had worked on the case while in the employment of the Ministry of Justice of the Republic of Armenia. The Respondent further indicated that it had approached the Claimants' representatives to resolve the matter, and that Dr. Tumanov had denied the existence of a conflict of interest. The Respondent requested that the Tribunal take the necessary steps to resolve the matter and reserved the right to request Dr. Tumanov's removal as counsel of record.\n\n19.\n\nOn July 3, 2018, the Claimants responded to the Respondent's letter of June 27, 2018. The Claimants denied the existence of a conflict of interest and described Dr. Tumanov's previous involvement in the case, *inter alia*, by reference to a letter that had been dispatched to the Respondent on June 13, 2018.\n\n20.\n\nOn July 12, 2018, the Respondent formally requested that the Tribunal proceed to the removal of Dr. Tumanov as counsel of record and submitted Exhibit R-0001 as well as Legal Authorities RL-0001 and RL-0002 (\"**Respondent's Application**\").\n\n21.\n\nOn July 20, 2018, the Claimants submitted the Memorial on Jurisdiction and the Merits, along with the witness statements of Mr. Edmond Khudyan, Mr. Lernik Hovhannisyan, and Mr. Nikolay Baghdasaryan, as well as Exhibits C-0001 through C-0131 and Legal Authorities CL-0001 through CL-0081.\n\n22.\n\nOn July 27, 2018, the Claimants submitted their response to the Respondent's Application, along with a letter dated July 25, 2018 from Dr. Tumanov to the Tribunal and Legal Authority CL-0082 (\"**Claimants' Response**\"). The Claimants requested that the Tribunal deny the Respondent's Application.\n\n23.\n\nOn August 10, 2018, the Respondent responded to the Claimants' Response and submitted Legal Authorities RL-0003 through RL-0008 (\"**Respondent's Reply**\").\n\n24.\n\nOn August 17, 2018, the Claimants replied to the Respondent's Reply and submitted a letter dated August 15, 2018 from Dr. Tumanov to the Tribunal (\"**Claimants' Rejoinder**\").\n\n25.\n\nThis Decision sets out the Tribunal's decision on the Respondent's Application for the removal of Dr. Tumanov as counsel of record for the Respondent.\n\n**III. THE POSITION OF THE PARTIES**\n------------------------------------\n\n**A. The Respondent's Position**\n--------------------------------\n\n26.\n\nThe Respondent requests that the Tribunal order the removal of Dr. Gevorg Tumanov as counsel of record in these proceedings.1 It is the Respondent's case that \"*Dr. Tumanov's present involvement as counsel for Claimants* [*\u2026*] *constitutes a conflict of interest and makes a misuse of the confidential information he obtained while being employed by the Armenian Government highly likely.*\"2\n\nRespondent's Application, p. 3; Respondent's Reply, p. 10.\n\nRespondent's Application, p. 3.\n\n27.\n\nThe Respondent submits that Article 44 of the ICSID Convention confers upon the Tribunal the power to rule on its Application, as part of the Tribunal's duty to ensure the fair conduct of the proceedings.3\n\nRespondent's Reply, p. 2 with reference to the decision in *Fraport AG Frankfurt Airport Services Worldwide v. Republic of Philippines*, ICSID Case No. ARB/03/25 (Annulment Proceedings), Decision on Application for Disqualification of Counsel, (September 18, 2008 (**CL-0082**), paras. 36-37.\n\n*(1) Legal standard*\n--------------------\n\n28.\n\nAs to the standard to be applied, the Respondent accepts that the Tribunal be guided by the principles established by the *ad hoc* Committee in the *Fraport v. Philippines* annulment proceedings (\"***Fraport***\").4 In addition, the Respondent submits that the Tribunal may be guided by the common general principles reflected in theRepublic of Armenia Law on Advocacy (the \"**Law on Advocacy**\"), the Code of Attorney's Ethics (the \"**Ethics Code**\") and The Hague Principles on Ethical Standards for Counsel Appearing before International Courts and Tribunals, developed by the International Law Society Study Group on the Practice and Procedure of International Tribunals (the \"**Hague Principles**\").5 Although the Respondent recognizes that Dr. Tumanov is not registered as an attorney with any bar association and that the Tribunal has no jurisdiction to police compliance with any specific set of deontological or ethical rules, the Respondent submits that the Tribunal should take guidance from those regulations as they reflect \"*common general principles*\" for conduct of counsel.6 The Respondent further emphasizes that the Hague Principles \"*are the only international principles prescribing an internationally accepted standard on the issue of disqualification of counsel due to conflicts of interest in international courts or tribunals.*\"7\n\nRespondent's Reply, p. 2 *.*\n\n**RL-0001**, **RL-0002** and **RL-0008**.\n\nRespondent's Reply, pp. 2-3. See also, *Fraport*, paras. 40-41; Claimant's Response, p. 3.\n\nRespondent's Reply, pp. 3-4. See also, **RL-0004**, **RL-0008**.\n\n29.\n\nThe Respondent argues that under the Armenian Law on Advocacy and Ethics Code, as well as under the Hague Principles, conflicts of interest preclude counsel from representing a new client in proceedings to which a former client is a party, or in proceedings that are closely related.8 On that basis, the Respondent submits that there is a common general principle that prevents counsel from acting in case of conflicting interests, which principle \u2013 it contends \u2013 is \"*indispensable for the fair conduct of the proceedings.*\" It is the Respondent's case that this principle has been violated and that therefore, the removal of Dr. Tumanov as counsel of record is imperative.9\n\nRespondent's Reply, p. 4.\n\nRespondent's Reply, p. 4, quoting *Fraport*, para. 41.\n\n30.\n\nThe Respondent further notes that the standard for the disqualification set out by the *ad hoc* Committee in *Fraport* was based on the existence of a \"*real risk*\" of disclosure of confidential information obtained by the challenged lawyer during his/her representation of the former client, and points out that the standard of \"*material risk*\" is similarly reflected in Article 4.2 of the Hague Principles.10 Accordingly, the Respondent submits that the standard to be applied by the Tribunal when deciding its Application to remove Dr. Tumanov is the following:\n\n*Whether there is a real risk that the lawyer representing a party against his/her former client could have received confidential information from that client, which may be of significance in the present proceedings, and which may accordingly prejudice the fair conduct of the present proceedings.*11\n\nRespondent's Reply, p. 5. See also, *Fraport*, para. 42.\n\nRespondent's Reply, p. 5.\n\n*(2) Application of the standard*\n---------------------------------\n\n31.\n\nApplying this principle to the case at hand, the Respondent claims that there is a \"*real*\" or \"*material*\" risk that Dr. Tumanov had access or was privy to the Respondent's confidential information, which is borne out by the following facts:\n\na. Dr. Tumanov held the position of Deputy Head of the Department of International Mutual Legal Assistance and Foreign Relations of the Armenian Ministry of Justice throughout 2014 and remained in this position until September 2015;12\n\nb. Dr. Tumanov was a high ranking official within the Respondent's Ministry of Justice for at least one year, during which the present dispute was ongoing (from August 2014, when the Ministry of Justice received the Claimants' Notice of Dispute (also referred to as \"**Statement of Claim**\"), until September 2015);13\n\nc. Dr. Tumanov prepared an internal memorandum in July 2015 in which, according to the Respondent, Dr. Tumanov provided \"*a detailed overview of the alleged facts of the case, the alleged 'violations' committed by State bodies and officials of Respondent, the purported legal grounds for the treaty claim and a preliminary calculation of alleged damages. Notably, the memorandum also includes a paragraph containing Dr. Tumanov's tentative views on the merits of the case.*\"14 The Respondent did not submit a copy of the memorandum (and neither did the Claimants).\n\nRespondent's letter to the Tribunal, dated June 27, 2018, p. 2.\n\nRespondent's Reply, p. 7.\n\nRespondent's Application, p. 2. See also, Respondent's Reply, p. 7.\n\n32.\n\nThe Respondent denies Dr. Tumanov's statement that the memorandum was general in nature and based solely upon the contents of the documents that the Claimants had sent to Armenia and publicly available information. The Respondent insists that Dr. Tumanov, in his capacity of Deputy Head of the Department of International Mutual Legal Assistance and Foreign Relations of the Armenian Ministry of Justice has had access to all privileged information and potentially relevant evidence that may be used by the Respondent in this arbitration. According to the Respondent, \"*it is reasonable to assume*\" that Dr. Tumanov \"*would have further looked into the matter, discussed it with other employees and engaged in fact-finding on Respondent's side.*\"15 It further argues that it is implausible that Dr. Tumanov prepared the memorandum, which included Dr. Tumanov's tentative views on the merits of the case, without being privy to confidential information. As such information \"*may be of significance*\" in the present proceedings, the Respondent claims that the fair conduct of the proceedings is prejudiced.16\n\nRespondent's Application, p. 2.\n\nRespondent's Reply, p. 8.\n\n33.\n\nThe Respondent takes the position that it is not required to demonstrate that Dr. Tumanov actually had access to confidential information and refutes Claimants' criticism in this respect. Armenia reiterates that the applicable standard merely requires a \"*real*\" or \"*material*\" risk that Dr. Tumanov had access to confidential information, which \u2013 it argues \u2013 is in line with an attorney's professional obligations, pursuant to which \"*even the appearance of any conflict of interest should be actively avoided.*\"17 The Respondent submits that the standard is satisfied in the present case.\n\nRespondent's Reply, pp. 6 and 8.\n\n34.\n\nIn addition, the Respondent contends that the Claimants' invocation of the refusal of the *ad hoc* Committee in *Fraport* to rely on a presumption of access to confidential information of the challenged counsel as a basis for his disqualification, is inapposite because the facts of the *Fraport* must be distinguished from the facts of the present case.18 The Respondent emphasizes that in *Fraport* the challenged counsel's relationship with the former client did not extend beyond seven days, the challenged counsel represented the allegedly opposite interests in two separate arbitrations, and the challenged counsel did not receive any information other than case documents from the ICC, which were common to both parties. By contrast, in the present case Dr. Tumanov was a high-ranking employee of the Ministry of Justice during one year following the notification of the claim to the State, he prepared an internal memorandum on the case and had internal correspondence with the First Deputy Minister of Justice regarding that memorandum.19 The Respondent claims that given his position within the Ministry of Justice, Dr. Tumanov's involvement in the case was \"*comparable to, if not more onerous than, a lawyer who is actively engaged in the course of the retainer*\" because he would have had easier access to confidential information than an external lawyer.20\n\nRespondent's Reply, pp. 6-7.\n\nRespondent's Reply, pp. 6-7.\n\nRespondent's Reply, pp. 7-8.\n\n35.\n\nFinally, the Respondent refutes the Claimants' criticism to the effect that the Respondent failed to address Dr. Tumanov's representation of the Claimants in this dispute earlier. In that respect, Armenia argues that the present arbitration only started in September 2017 and that Dr. Tumanov's role was only formalized on May 31, 2018, when the ICSID Secretariat was notified in accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 18 that Dr. Tumanov should be added to the list of counsel, representing the Claimants.21 The Respondent argues that prior to the Rule 18 designation it had no avenue to challenge Dr. Tumanov's involvement in the case, as the Tribunal does not have jurisdiction to hear challenges to representatives of the Parties who are not counsel of record.22\n\nRespondent's Reply, p. 9.\n\nRespondent's Reply, pp. 9-10.\n\n36.\n\nOn the basis of the foregoing, the Respondent requests that the Tribunal order the removal of Dr. Tumanov as Claimants' counsel of record in these arbitral proceedings.\n\n**B. The Claimants' Position**\n------------------------------\n\n37.\n\nThe Claimants do not contest that the Tribunal has the authority to rule on the challenge to Dr. Tumanov and expressly accept to abide by the Tribunal's decision.23\n\nClaimants' Response, fn. 4.\n\n*(1) Legal standard*\n--------------------\n\n38.\n\nIn respect of the applicable legal standard, the Claimants submit that the Tribunal should be guided by the reasoning of the *ad hoc* Committee in *Fraport*, which is \"*the only publicly available decision of an international tribunal ruling on a challenge to counsel based on that counsel's prior representation of the party raising the challenge.*\"24 While the Respondent relies on the *Fraport* decision in conjunction with the Armenian Law on Advocacy and Ethics Code, the Claimants emphasize that the *ad hoc* Committee in *Fraport* found that it was not bound by any particular national code of ethics and therefore did not apply any such deontological rules in its assessment. Similarly, the Tribunal does not have any authority to assess and sanction the compliance of Dr. Tumanov against any set of deontological rules.\n\nClaimants' Response, p. 2; Claimants' Rejoinder, p. 1.\n\n39.\n\nIn addition, the Claimants agree with the Respondent that the Tribunal may also take guidance from the general principles laid down in the Hague Principles.25\n\nClaimants' Rejoinder, pp. 1-2.\n\n40.\n\nEssentially, the Claimants accept the Respondent's formulation of the applicable legal standard, which they formulate as:\n\n*Whether there is a real risk that the lawyer could have received confidential information from its former client, which may be of significance in the present proceedings, and which may accordingly prejudice the fair conduct of the present proceedings.26*\n\nClaimants' Rejoinder, p. 2. See also, Respondent's Reply, p. 5.\n\n41.\n\nThe Claimants emphasize that this standard must be applied in line with the reasoning of the *ad hoc* Committee in *Fraport*, which refused to rely \"*simply on mere appearances since to prevent a party from having access to its chosen counsel cannot depend upon a nebulous foundation, but rather from clear evidence of prejudice.*\"27 The Claimants' position in this respect is at odds with that of the Respondent, which claims that \"*even the appearance of any conflict of interest should be actively avoided.*\"28\n\nClaimants' Rejoinder, p. 3.\n\nRespondent's Reply, p. 6.\n\n*(2) Application of the standard*\n---------------------------------\n\n42.\n\nThe Claimants submit that, during his employment at the Ministry of Justice of Armenia, Dr. Tumanov neither had access to confidential information about the case, nor participated in or contributed towards Armenia's defense against the Claimants' claims.29 The Claimants' position in this respect is substantiated by reference to two letters of Dr. Tumanov to the members of the Tribunal, dated July 25, 2018, and August 15, 2018.\n\nClaimants' Response, pp. 6-7; Claimants' Rejoinder, pp. 5-7.\n\n43.\n\nIn those letters, Dr. Tumanov describes his involvement during his employment at the Ministry of Justice as follows:\n\na. Up to August 28, 2015, Dr. Tumanov was the Acting Head of the Department of International Mutual Legal Assistance and Foreign Relations of the Ministry of Justice of the Republic of Armenia;30\n\nb. In early July 2015, Dr. Tumanov submitted his letter of resignation, as a result of which his service with the Ministry of Justice ended as of August 28, 2015;31\n\nc. Until July 17, 2015, neither Dr. Tumanov, nor the Department of International Mutual Legal Assistance and Foreign Relations, had any involvement in addressing the Claimants' claims;32\n\nd. On Friday, July 17, 2015, Dr. Tumanov received from the Deputy Minister of Justice a hard copy of the Claimants' Notice of Dispute and the supporting documents that had been filed on August 28, 2014, along with instructions to prepare a memorandum summarizing the Claimants' claims;33\n\ne. That same day, Dr. Tumanov instructed his team to prepare the translation into Armenian of the received documents while he drafted the section of the memorandum describing the Washington Convention, ICSID as an institution, the Armenian treaties that contain provisions for arbitration of disputes before ICSID (including the U.S. \u2013 Armenia BIT34), and ICSID arbitration.35 The sections of the memorandum summarizing the content of the documents submitted by the Claimants were based on the translations prepared by the Department's staff;36\n\nf. On July 18, 2015, Dr. Tumanov submitted the memorandum to the Deputy Minister of Justice, Mr. Mkrtchyan, and to the Director of the Ministry of Justice's Office of Implementation of Legal Projects, Mr. Khachatryan. In response, Mr. Khachatryan asked Dr. Tumanov to include a legal analysis in the memorandum, stating that a surface-level legal analysis would be sufficient;37\n\ng. Pursuant to the instructions of Mr. Khachatryan, Dr. Tumanov added a paragraph at the end of the memorandum, containing: 1) a sentence stating that, if the facts alleged by the Claimants were true, the Claimants' claims would likely be satisfied in whole or in part; 2) a reproduction of Article 53 of the ICSID Convention; and 3) a sentence stating that the expenses of an ICSID proceedings may be significant. Dr. Tumanov did not support these statements with any further analysis;38\n\nh. On July 22, 2015, at the request of Mr. Khachatryan, Dr. Tumanov instructed his staff to remove typographical errors in the memorandum;39\n\ni. Between July 22, 2015, and his departure from the Ministry of Justice on August 28, 2015,40 Dr. Tumanov did not perform any further work on the memorandum;41\n\nj. Dr. Tumanov insists that throughout his service with the Armenian Ministry of Justice, he never had access to any privileged information concerning the present case42 and that the only documents he had access to when preparing the memorandum were documents emanating from the Claimants, as well as information available online.43 He further claims that he never discussed the case with anyone in the Ministry of Justice, save to the extent described in his letters to the Tribunal.44\n\nk. Lastly, Dr. Tumanov points out that he started representing Mr. Khudyan as of November 2015, and that the officials at the Ministry of Justice became aware of his representation at the latest in March 2017, when Dr. Tumanov met with the Ministry to explore a possible settlement of the dispute between Mr. Khudyan and Armenia.45 According to Dr. Tumanov, the Ministry of Justice never called his representation of Mr. Khudyan into question until after he was added to the list of the Claimants' representatives in this arbitration.46\n\nDr. Tumanov's First Letter to the Tribunal, dated July 25, 2018 (\"**Tumanov First Letter**\"), p. 2.\n\nDr. Tumanov's Second Letter to the Tribunal, dated August 15, 2018 (\"**Tumanov Second Letter**\"), p. 1.\n\nTumanov Second Letter, p. 1.\n\nTumanov Second Letter, p. 2; Tumanov First Letter, p. 1.\n\nTumanov First Letter, p. 1.\n\nTumanov First Letter, p. 1; Tumanov Second Letter, p. 2.\n\nTumanov First Letter, p. 1.\n\nTumanov Second Letter, p. 2.\n\nTumanov Second Letter, p. 2; Tumanov First Letter, p. 2.\n\nTumanov Second Letter, p. 2.\n\nTumanov First Letter, p. 2.\n\nTumanov Second Letter, p. 3.\n\nTumanov First Letter, pp. 1-2; Tumanov Second Letter, p. 4.\n\nTumanov First Letter, p. 2; Tumanov Second Letter, p. 4.\n\nTumanov First Letter, p. 2.\n\nTumanov First Letter, p. 2.\n\nTumanov First Letter, p. 3; Tumanov Second Letter, p. 3.\n\n44.\n\nThe Claimants contend that the extent of Dr. Tumanov's involvement is very similar to that of the counsel challenged in the *Fraport* case and claim that, like counsel for the Philippines, Dr. Tumanov had neither received nor had access to any confidential information.47 The Claimants point out that the Respondent failed to identify any confidential information to which Dr. Tumanov would have had access at the Ministry of Justice or any specific opportunities during which Dr. Tumanov can reasonably have been presumed to have had access to such information.48\n\nClaimants' Rejoinder, pp. 5-6.\n\nClaimants' Response, p. 5.\n\n45.\n\nMore specifically, the Claimants allege that the Respondent's Application is based on mere speculation as it effectively asks the Tribunal to presume that Dr. Tumanov had access to confidential information during the work he performed prior to his departure for private practice.49 According to the Claimants, this is precisely the type of presumption that the *ad hoc* Committee in *Fraport* refused to engage in.50 The Claimants insist that the Tribunal cannot remove Dr. Tumanov without any factual foundation on the presumption that he did have access to confidential information potentially prejudicing the fair conduct of this arbitration.51 In this context, the Claimants submit that, just as the *ad hoc* Committee in *Fraport* gave weight to the testimony of the counsel whose disqualification was sought*,* this Tribunal should give weight to Dr. Tumanov's account of the work undertaken and his representation that he never had access to confidential information concerning the present dispute.52\n\nClaimants' Response, pp. 5-6.\n\nClaimants' Response, p. 6.\n\nClaimants' Response, p. 6 *.*\n\nClaimants' Response, p. 6.\n\n46.\n\nThe Claimants conclude that they demonstrated that, during his employment by the Ministry of Justice, Dr. Tumanov never had access to confidential information concerning this case and that his involvement in the case was very limited.53 In the absence of access to confidential information \u2013 the Claimants argue \u2013 there also is no risk of misuse, which is corroborated by the fact that prior to June 2018 the Respondent never challenged Dr. Tumanov's representation of the Claimants, despite its awareness thereof since March 2017 at the latest.54 The Claimants refute the Respondent's allegation to the effect that it had no avenue to challenge Dr. Tumanov until he was formally designated as counsel of record in this arbitration. The Claimants submit that, had the Respondent genuinely believed that there was a real risk of misuse of confidential information, \"*it is difficult to imagine that Armenian law has no mechanisms*\" by means of which such misuse could have been prevented or redressed.55\n\nClaimants' Rejoinder, p. 7.\n\nClaimants' Response, pp. 4-5; Claimants' Rejoinder, p. 6.\n\nClaimants' Rejoinder, p. 6.\n\n47.\n\nOn a balance of interests, the Claimants conclude that \"*Mr. Khudyan's fundamental right to counsel of his choice should prevail over an alleged concern that Respondent chose not to raise* [earlier] *and which it now fails to demonstrate poses a 'real risk' of prejudice to these proceedings.*\"56 They state that it would be severely prejudicial to deprive Mr. Khudyan of his Armenian counsel, who has been working on the case for almost three years now, and that there are no facts on the record that show that there is any risk of prejudice to the fairness of the proceedings that could justify the removal of Claimants' counsel of choice.57 Accordingly, the Claimants request that the Tribunal dismiss the Respondent's Application.\n\nClaimants' Rejoinder, p. 6.\n\nClaimants' Rejoinder, p. 7.\n\n**IV. THE TRIBUNAL'S ANALYSIS**\n-------------------------------\n\n48.\n\nThe Tribunal hereby sets out its analysis of the disputed issues.\n\n**A. Introduction**\n-------------------\n\n49.\n\nAs a preliminary matter, the Tribunal notes that the Parties agree that the Tribunal has the authority to rule on the Respondent's request that Dr. Tumanov be removed as counsel of record.58 It is common ground that the Tribunal's power to deal with the current Application is encompassed within its general power to regulate the conduct of the proceedings, enshrined in Article 44 of the ICSID Convention:\n\n*Any arbitration proceeding shall be conducted in accordance with the provisions of this Section and, except as the parties otherwise agree, in accordance with the Arbitration Rules in effect on the date on which the parties consented to arbitration. If any question of procedure arises which is not covered by this Section or the Arbitration Rules or any rules agreed by the parties, the Tribunal shall decide the question.*59\n\nClaimants' Response, fn. 4; Respondent's Reply, p. 2.\n\nEmphasis added.\n\n50.\n\nThe Tribunal accepts that it has the authority to rule on the Respondent's Application. The power conferred upon the Tribunal by Article 44 is to be exercised in appropriate circumstances, which includes cases \u2013 like the present one \u2013 where there is a risk of a violation of a fundamental rule of procedure, the fairness of the proceedings and the equality of the parties. Judicial propriety calls for the Tribunal to safeguard the integrity of the arbitral process and the equality of the Parties in this arbitration.\n\n**B. Legal Standard**\n---------------------\n\n51.\n\nThe Tribunal does not have the authority to police and sanction compliance with any particular national law or professional ethics code that may or may not be applicable to Dr. Tumanov.60 Accordingly, the Tribunal will focus its assessment on the general principles that are indispensable for the fair conduct of the proceedings. In establishing which are the relevant general principles, the Tribunal will take guidance from the principles established by the *ad hoc* Committee in *Fraport* and those laid down in the Hague Principles, although it does not consider itself bound by them.\n\nSee *Fraport*, paras. 41 and 52.\n\n*(1) The Hague Principles*\n--------------------------\n\n52.\n\nThe Hague Principles strive to identify clear and transparent principles of general application with the objective of maintaining \"*the highest standards of professional conduct for counsel in proceedings before international courts and tribunals with a view to ensuring integrity, justice and fairness of the international judicial process.*\"61 The Hague Principles expressly recognize that not all persons representing parties in proceedings before international arbitral tribunals62 are admitted to a bar association or other regulated profession.63\n\n**RL-0008**, Preamble, p. 1.\n\n**RL-0008**, Article 1.2 (Scope): \"*'International court or tribunal' refers to a court or tribunal created under and governed by international law, including criminal and non-criminal courts, whether standing or* ad hoc*, and, as appropriate, to an international arbitral tribunal in a proceeding in which one or more of the parties is a state*.\"\n\n**RL-0008**, Article 1.1 (Scope): \"*The Principles apply to any person discharging the functions of counsel by representing, appearing on behalf of, or providing legal advice to a party in proceedings before an international court or tribunal, however such person may be described, and whether or not the person has professional legal training or is admitted as a member of a bar association or other professional body*.\"\n\n53.\n\nOne of the core principles identified in the Hague Principles is that counsel appearing before \"*an international arbitral tribunal in a proceeding in which one or more of the parties is a state*\"64 has the duty to ensure compliance with the principle of confidentiality:65\n\n*Counsel shall respect the confidential character of any information imparted to him or her in confidence in the litigation.*\n\n**RL-0008**, Article 1.2 (Scope).\n\n**RL-0008**, Article 2.4 (General Principles) (emphasis added).\n\n54.\n\nBuilding on the principle of confidentiality, the Hague Principles also address the issue of conflicts of interest, in the following terms:66\n\n*Counsel may not represent a new client in proceedings where a former client is party to the same or closely related proceedings and there exists a material risk of breach of confidentiality, except with the express authorisation of the former client.*\n\n**RL-0008**, Article 4.2 (Conflicts of Interest).\n\n55.\n\nAccording to the Hague Principles, there is a conflict of interest if (i) counsel previously represented a party to the same or closely related proceedings; and (ii) there is a material risk that confidential information that his or her prior client shared with him or her may be passed on to the new client. Hence, the mere fact that counsel previously represented another party to the same or closely related proceedings is not sufficient. In order to disqualify counsel on grounds of conflict of interest there must be a showing of material risk that confidential information was imparted on counsel by the first client, which may be passed on to the new client.\n\n*(2) Principles established by the* Fraport *Committee*\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n56.\n\nThe *ad hoc* Committee in *Fraport* formulated the relevant standard as follows:67\n\n[w]*here the allegation relates to the representation of a former client, the issue for the Committee is whether there is a real risk that the lawyer could have received confidential information from that client, which may be of significance in the subsequent proceedings, and which may accordingly prejudice the fair trial of the second proceedings.*\n\n*Fraport*, para. 42.\n\n57.\n\nThe *Fraport ad hoc* Committee considered that the fact that counsel previously represented another party to the same or closely related proceedings, by itself, is not enough. In order for there to be a potential of prejudice to the fairness of the subsequent proceedings, there must be a real risk of receipt in the first set of proceedings of confidential information which may be of significance in the subsequent proceedings.\n\n58.\n\nIn light of the importance of each party's right to be represented by the counsel of its choice, the *Fraport* Committee also held that the receipt of confidential information may not be presumed lightly. It insisted that clear evidence is required, as a party cannot be prevented from access to its chosen counsel on the basis of mere appearances:68\n\n*The Committee cannot act in this regard simply on mere appearances since to prevent a party from having access to its chosen counsel cannot depend upon a nebulous foundation, but rather must flow from clear evidence of prejudice.*\n\n*Fraport*, paras. 47 and 55 (emphasis added).\n\n**C. Analysis**\n---------------\n\n59.\n\nAs a preliminary matter, the Tribunal notes that the Respondent's concern about Dr. Tumanov's representation of the Claimants following his resignation from the Respondent's Ministry of Justice is understandable. Whilst his appearance may seem disconcerting, it does not, however, *per se* constitute a conflict of interest preventing him from representing the Claimants. In order to disqualify Dr. Tumanov, it must be demonstrated that there is a real risk that he obtained confidential information that may be of significance to the dispute before the Tribunal.\n\n60.\n\nIn view of the undisputed fact that Dr. Tumanov was employed by the Ministry of Justice of the Respondent when the Ministry received the Claimants' Notice of Dispute and worked on a memorandum about the Claimants' claims during his employment, the Tribunal has formulated the question to be addressed as follows:\n\nIs there clear evidence of a material risk that Dr. Tumanov received confidential information from the Respondent about the dispute with the Claimants that could be of significance in the present proceedings such that there would be prejudice to the fair disposition of the dispute in this arbitration if the Claimants were allowed to continue being represented by Dr. Tumanov?\n\n61.\n\nIn *Fraport*, the *ad hoc* Committee refused to disqualify the challenged counsel merely on the basis of his prior retainer, but rather focused on actual work performed as part of the retainer and on whether one would assume that the work actually performed would in the ordinary course entail access to confidential information.69 The Tribunal agrees with the *Fraport* Committee that it cannot act on the basis of a presumption that a prior retainer gives rise to a material risk that confidential information was imparted by the Respondent to Dr. Tumanov. As the mere appearance of a conflict of interest does not suffice to disqualify Dr. Tumanov, clear evidence is required of the existence of a material risk that the Respondent imparted to Dr. Tumanov confidential information, which may be of significance in these proceedings and accordingly may prejudice the fair disposition of the dispute in this arbitration.\n\n*Fraport*, para. 53.\n\n62.\n\nThe Tribunal further notes that Dr. Tumanov is not an attorney, admitted to a bar. The Tribunal presumes that Dr. Tumanov's prior professional relationship with the Ministry of Justice of the Republic of Armenia was based on terms of service, presumably recorded in an employment contract. As the terms of service are not part of the record of this arbitration, the Tribunal is unable to ascertain whether Dr. Tumanov was bound by any duty of confidentiality, and if so, whether such duty extended beyond the termination of his service.\n\n63.\n\nThe Tribunal notes at the outset that the facts adduced in respect of Dr. Tumanov's involvement during his service with the Ministry of Justice are limited to the factual allegations set forth in the Respondent's Application, the Claimants' Response, the Respondent's Reply and the Claimants' Rejoinder. Importantly, only the Claimants have attempted to substantiate their factual allegations, by reference to two letters from Dr. Tumanov to the Tribunal.\n\n64.\n\nConsidering that clear evidence is required to prevent the Claimants from being represented by their counsel of choice, the Tribunal considers that it was for the Respondent to substantiate its Application by reference to information on the basis of which the veracity of Dr. Tumanov's statements could reasonably be called into question. As the Respondent did not seek to demonstrate that Dr. Tumanov's account is factually incorrect \u2013 be it by means of email communications or other written records, a statement from Mr. Mkrtchyan, Mr. Khachatryan, staff members of the Department of International Mutual Legal Assistance and Foreign Relations or any other civil servant within the Ministry of Justice of Armenia, with whom Dr. Tumanov would have had exchanges, or otherwise \u2013 the Tribunal has no evidence before it that could lead it to doubt the veracity of Dr. Tumanov's description of his involvement in the matter during his service at the Ministry of Justice. Although the Respondent is correct to state that it is not required to prove the actual receipt of confidential information, the difficulty is that the Respondent did not adduce *any* facts on the basis of which the credibility of Dr. Tumanov's factual account could be called into question. Considering that Dr. Tumanov's account appears credible and coherent, and the Respondent failed to adduce any evidence that challenges or contradicts that account, the Tribunal will give Dr. Tumanov's explanation the appropriate weight.\n\n65.\n\nIn light of the foregoing, the Tribunal has identified the following facts as relevant:\n\na. Dr. Tumanov served as Deputy Head of the Department of International Mutual Legal Assistance and Foreign Relations of the Ministry of Justice of Armenia in the period between August 28, 2014, when the Respondent received the Claimants' \"Statement of Claim\" with supporting documentation, until the end of his service on August 28, 2015;70\n\nb. Dr. Tumanov handed in his resignation letter in early July 2015;71\n\nc. The Department of International Mutual Legal Assistance and Foreign Relations of the Ministry of Justice of Armenia had no involvement in this matter until the Deputy Minister of Justice, Mr. Arsen Mkrtchyan, forwarded Claimants' Notice of Dispute dated August 28, 2014 to Dr. Tumanov on July 17, 2015, and instructed him \"*to write a memorandum summarizing Claimants' claims*;\"72\n\nd. On July 17, 2015, Dr. Tumanov \"*wrote the sections of the draft memorandum that describe the Washington Convention, ICSID as an Institution, Armenian treaties that contain provisions for arbitration of disputes before ICSID, and Arbitration under the ICSID Rules.*\" The remainder of the memorandum, summarizing the claims as described in the Claimants' Notice of Dispute of August 28, 2014, was drafted by members of Dr. Tumanov's staff and supervised by Dr. Tumanov;73\n\ne. On July 18, 2015, Dr. Tumanov sent the draft memorandum to the First Deputy Minister, who instructed him that same day to add a legal analysis to the memorandum. Subsequently, Dr. Tumanov sent an updated version of the memorandum on July 20, 2015, that \"*was identical to the previous version*\" but for:\n\n*1) a sentence stating that, if the facts alleged by the Claimants were true, Claimants' claims would likely be satisfied in whole or in part; 2) a reproduction of Article 53 of the ICSID Convention; 3) a sentence stating that the expenses of an ICSID proceeding could be considerable.*74\n\nf. On that same day, July 20, 2015, Dr. Tumanov received an email from the First Deputy Minister \"*criticiz* [ing] *the memorandum's lack of legal analysis and the conclusory nature of that final paragraph,*\" which he did not follow-up on. The only further work undertaken\n\nby the Department of International Mutual Legal Assistance and Foreign Relations was the correction of correct typographical errors in the memorandum on July 22, 2015.75\n\nTumanov First Letter, pp. 1-2.\n\nTumanov Second Letter, p. 1.\n\nTumanov Second Letter, pp. 1-2.\n\nTumanov First Letter, p. 1; Tumanov Second Letter, p. 2.\n\nTumanov Second Letter, p. 2.\n\nTumanov Second Letter, p. 2.\n\n66.\n\nThere are two key differences between the Claimants' pleaded case and that of the Respondent. First, the Claimants allege76 and the Respondent denies77 that the memorandum was general in nature and did not contain any legal analysis or advice concerning the Respondent's potential response or defense to the Claimants' claims. Second, the Respondent alleges78 and the Claimants deny79 that Dr. Tumanov had access to confidential information and evidence about the dispute during his employment at the Ministry of Justice.\n\nClaimants' Rejoinder, p. 5.\n\nRespondent's Reply, pp. 7-8.\n\nRespondent's Reply, pp. 5-8.\n\nClaimants' Rejoinder, pp. 5-7.\n\n67.\n\nFirst, as to the question whether the memorandum did or did not include legal analysis or advice, given that the memorandum was not produced by either Party, the Tribunal only has the benefit of Dr. Tumanov's explanation who insists on the general nature of the memorandum. He declared in this respect that \"*Deputy Minister Mkrtchyan sent an email in which he criticized the memorandum's lack of legal analysis and the conclusory nature of that final paragraph*\"80 and that the memorandum \"*did not offer strategic advice about how to respond to those allegations or how to defend against any eventual claim that might be brought in future.*\"81\n\nTumanov Second Letter, p. 2.\n\nTumanov First Letter, p. 2.\n\n68.\n\nWhile it would have been straightforward for the Respondent to deny or to rebut the allegation that Deputy Minister Mkrtchyan criticized the memorandum's lack of legal analysis without divulging any confidential information, it did not. Nor did the Respondent produce any testimony or other evidence that Dr. Tumanov was asked to provide legal advice and, to that end, was provided with confidential information.\n\n69.\n\nOn the basis of the limited factual information on record, the Tribunal finds that the one paragraph that was reportedly added by Dr. Tumanov following Deputy Minister Mkrtchyan's criticism is so generic in nature that it is equivalent to having expressed no view at all. In the absence of any evidence that the memorandum in its original version of July 18, 2015, or in the iterations of July 20 and 22, 2015, provided some form of legal advice or analysis, the Tribunal will proceed on the assumption that the memorandum did not contain any legal advice or analysis.\n\n70.\n\nSecond, turning to the assessment as to whether at any time during his employment by the Ministry of Justice, Dr. Tumanov was privy to or had access to confidential information, the Tribunal notes that Dr. Tumanov categorically denies that he ever had access to any confidential information about the present dispute. Dr. Tumanov states that his involvement in the case was confined to an isolated six-day period towards the end of his employment and that the memorandum produced under his supervision was general in nature. It merely summarized the Claimants' claims on the basis of the documents provided to the Respondent by the Claimants and described how BIT claims can be instituted in investment treaty arbitrations under the ICSID Convention and ICSID Arbitration Rules. More specifically, Dr. Tumanov denies having been aware of the dispute prior to July 17, 2015 and having seen any documents in connection with this dispute during his employment at the Ministry of Justice, apart from the Claimants' letter of August 28, 2014, the accompanying \"*Statement of Claim*,\" \"*various letters written by Mr. Khudyan to Armenian officials*\" and information available online.82\n\nTumanov Second Letter, p. 4.\n\n71.\n\nThe Respondent's Application is based on the presumption that, in his capacity as Deputy Head of the Department of International Mutual Legal Assistance and Foreign Relations of the Armenian Ministry of Justice, Dr. Tumanov would have had access to all privileged information and potentially relevant evidence that may be used by the Respondent in this arbitration and that \"*it is reasonable to assume*\" that Dr. Tumanov \"*would have further looked into the matter, discussed it with other employees and engaged in fact-finding on Respondent's side.*\"83\n\nRespondent's Application, p. 2.\n\n72.\n\nThe Tribunal is not convinced by the Respondent's unsubstantiated presumption. The Respondent did not adduce any factual elements that challenge or contradict Dr. Tumanov's account of events. Again, without divulging any confidential information, the Respondent could, for instance, have provided the Tribunal with factual information concerning the type of systems and/or files Dr. Tumanov had access to, whether those systems and/or files contained information relating to this dispute, and the clearance level of a civil servant of Dr. Tumanov's ranking or seniority. Nor did the Respondent provide any information about the officers and departments within the Ministry of Justice that are responsible for this file and the involvement in the matter of Dr. Tumanov or his department. In that context, it is striking that the Respondent omitted even to identify any other officers or departments within the Ministry with whom Dr. Tumanov would have had exchanges on the matter or any occasion during which he would have exchanged confidences with his colleagues.\n\n73.\n\nTo be clear, Dr. Tumanov's explanation, including his description of internal correspondence about the case, in and of itself arguably constitutes information that would be considered confidential under the ethical rules regulating the legal profession in some jurisdictions. However, this information is not of such a nature that it might be of significance in this arbitration or can be misused to the detriment of the Respondent. As such, the information imparted by Dr. Tumanov is not of such a nature that it might prejudice the fairness of these arbitral proceedings, and accordingly the powers of the Tribunal under Article 44 of the ICSID Convention need not be exercised.\n\n74.\n\nAs there are no factual elements on the basis of which Dr. Tumanov's statements in this respect can be called into question, the Tribunal \u2013 like the *ad hoc* Committee in *Fraport*84 \u2013 accepts Dr. Tumanov's factual representations as accurate and concludes that, beyond documents common to both Parties and information available online,85 Dr. Tumanov had no access to confidential information concerning the present dispute that could be of significance in these proceedings.\n\n*Fraport*, paras. 47-52.\n\nTumanov First Letter, p. 2: \"*The only documents to which I had access when that memorandum was prepared were documents from the Claimants. These included: (i) the letter from Dentons dated 28 August 2014; (ii) the document captioned 'Statement of Claim' enclosed with that letter; and (iii) various letters written by Mr. Khudyan to officials within the Armenian government describing his ordeal and other information that was available online.*\"\n\n75.\n\nThe Tribunal is comforted in this conclusion by the fact that, during the three-year period that Dr. Tumanov has been representing the Claimants, the Respondent has not taken any action aimed at preventing Dr. Tumanov from representing the Claimants or at enforcing the duty of confidentiality that he may have been subject to under the terms of his service or employment. The Tribunal accepts the Claimants' argument to the effect that prior to Dr. Tumanov's appearance as counsel of record, there must have been legal avenues available to the Respondent within its domestic legal system, aimed at protecting the confidentiality of information provided to Dr. Tumanov and/or preventing him from representing the Claimants. Had the Respondent considered that there was any real risk that confidential information would pass to the Claimants to the detriment of the Respondent, the Respondent could have taken action to protect its interest, at the latest following the meeting with the Ministry of Justice in March 2017 that Dr. Tumanov attended on the Claimants' behalf. The lack of any action whatsoever, under Dr. Tumanov's terms of service or otherwise, be it by email, formal correspondence or legal action, is consistent with the fact that there was no material risk that Dr. Tumanov would divulge confidential information that may aid the Claimants with their claims and be detrimental to the Respondent in these proceedings.\n\n76.\n\nConsidering that the Respondent has not adduced evidence, let alone clear evidence, of facts demonstrating the likelihood of passing of confidential information of significance - whether by reference to the Claimants' communications and statements over the past three years or the Memorial they filed in this arbitration - it is unlikely that the perceived risk will materialize thereafter. Furthermore, assuming for the sake of argument that Dr. Tumanov was privy to or had access to confidential information that may aid the Claimants with their claims to the detriment of the Respondent, that information would already have passed to the Claimants many years ago. The Respondent's own inaction over the years prior to Dr. Tumanov's designation as counsel of record for the Claimants in this arbitration renders the Claimants' application for the removal of Dr. Tumanov futile.\n\n77.\n\nOn the basis of the foregoing, the Tribunal concludes that there is no evidence that Dr. Tumanov had access, or was privy, to confidential information that would be of significance in these proceedings and thus threaten the fair disposition of the dispute in this arbitration. The Tribunal accordingly rejects the Respondent's Application for the Removal of Dr. Tumanov.\n\n**V. DECISION**\n---------------\n\n78.\n\nFor the above reasons, the Tribunal decides and directs as follows:\n\n(i) REJECTS the Respondent's Application for the Removal of Dr. Tumanov; and\n\n(ii) RESERVES the issue of costs for a later stage of these proceedings."}, {"Title": "Procedural Order No. 3 (Decision on the Respondent's Request for Bifurcation)", "Type": "Bifurcation", "Date": "2018-12-05T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Procedural Order No. 3 (Decision on the Respondent's Request for Bifurcation)\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**I. PROCEDURAL HISTORY**\n-------------------------\n\n1.\n\nOn June 7, 2018, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 1 providing *inter alia* directions on the subsequent conduct of the arbitration and the timetables applicable to these proceedings. Paragraph 1.1 of Procedural Order No. 1 provides that the ICSID Arbitration Rules in force as of April 10, 2006 (\"**Arbitration Rules**\") govern these proceedings.1\n\nCapitalized terms used but not defined in this Procedural Order No. 3 have the meaning ascribed to them in the Decision on the Respondent's Application for the Removal of Dr. Tumanov (Procedural Order No. 2).\n\n2.\n\nOn July 20, 2018, the Claimants submitted the Memorial on Jurisdiction and the Merits, along with the witness statements of Mr. Edmond Khudyan, Mr. Lernik Hovhannisyan, and Mr. Nikolay Baghdasaryan, Exhibits C-0001 through C-0131, and Legal Authorities CL-0001 through CL-0081 (the \"**Memorial**\").\n\n3.\n\nOn August 31, 2018, in accordance with the agreed timetable, the Respondent submitted an application for bifurcation, along with Legal Authorities RL-0009 to RL-0021 (the \"**Application for Bifurcation**\"). The Respondent set out three jurisdictional objections that, it indicated, would be detailed further in the jurisdictional phase. The Respondent also requested that the proceedings be bifurcated into a preliminary phase dealing with its jurisdictional objections and the proceedings on the merits be suspended pending a decision on the Respondent's jurisdictional objections.\n\n4.\n\nOn September 14, 2018, the Respondent submitted its requests for production of documents related to jurisdiction.\n\n5.\n\nOn September 17, 2018, the Claimants filed their response to the Respondent's Application for Bifurcation along with Legal Authorities CL-83 through CL-100 (the \"**Response to the Application for Bifurcation**\"), requesting that the Tribunal deny the Application for Bifurcation.\n\n6.\n\nOn October 1, 2018, the Parties were informed that the Tribunal decided to join the Respondent's jurisdictional objections to the merits and that the reasons for its decision would follow in due course.\n\n7.\n\nThis Procedural Order sets out the reasons for the Tribunal's decision on the Respondent's bifurcation request.\n\n**II. THE POSITION OF THE PARTIES**\n-----------------------------------\n\n**A. The Respondent's Position**\n--------------------------------\n\n8.\n\nIn its Application for Bifurcation, the Respondent presented three jurisdictional objections:\n\na. First, an objection to the Tribunal's jurisdiction *ratione personae* over Mr. Edmond Khudyan (the \"**First Claimant**\") on ground that he is \"*precluded from invoking the jurisdiction of ICSID as he holds an Armenian passport with special residency status on which he relied to make his investment in Armenia*;\"2\n\nb. Second, an objection to the Tribunal's jurisdiction *ratione personae* over Arin Capital & Investment Corp. (the \"**Second Claimant**\") on the ground that the Claimants have failed to establish that the Second Claimant ever made an investment in Armenia;3 and\n\nc. Third, an objection to the Tribunal's jurisdiction *ratione materiae* because the Claimants' alleged investment in Armenia do not constitute an investment within the meaning of Article 25 of the ICSID Convention.4\n\nApplication for Bifurcation, paras. 2 and 26- 29.\n\nApplication for Bifurcation, paras. 2 and 30.\n\nApplication for Bifurcation, paras. 2 and 31.\n\n9.\n\nThe Respondent requests that the Tribunal deal with the jurisdictional objections on a preliminary basis in the interest of procedural efficiency.\n\n*(1) Legal standard*\n--------------------\n\n10.\n\nThe Respondent submits that Article 41(2) of the ICSID Convention and Arbitration Rule 41(3) and 41(4) confer upon the Tribunal the power to determine jurisdictional objections on a preliminary basis, while suspending the proceedings on the merits.5\n\nApplication for Bifurcation, paras. 4-6.\n\n11.\n\nAs to the legal standard by reference to which the Tribunal is to decide whether to bifurcate or not, the Respondent contends that in investment arbitration there is no presumption in favor of the exercise of jurisdiction. It emphasizes that jurisdiction must be established by the Tribunal and cannot simply be presumed. According to the Respondent, there are strong grounds for the Tribunal to consider the question of its jurisdiction as a preliminary issue separate from the merits.6\n\nApplication for Bifurcation, paras. 7-10.\n\n12.\n\nBy reference to the decision in *Mesa v. Canada*,7 the Respondent claims that in international arbitration, and especially in investment arbitration, there *is* a general presumption in favor of addressing issues of jurisdiction on a preliminary basis.8 Although the Respondent recognizes that the *Mesa* arbitration was conducted under the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules (1976 version), which in Article 21(4) set forth a presumption in favor of bifurcation of jurisdictional issues, it argues that cases decided under the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules are relevant to the extent those tribunals \"*discussed the reasons that the presumption exists, or why a tribunal chooses to depart from the presumption in certain circumstances.*\"9 Even if there is no presumption in favor of bifurcation, the Respondent argues that it is standard practice in ICSID arbitration to bifurcate the arbitral proceedings in a jurisdictional and a merits phase.10\n\n*Mesa Power Group, LLC v. Government of Canada*, UNCITRAL, PCA Case No. 2012-17, Procedural Order No. 2 (January 18, 2013) (**RL-0012**).\n\nApplication for Bifurcation, paras. 10-11; **RL-0012**, para. 16.\n\nApplication for Bifurcation, para. 12 (emphasis omitted).\n\nApplication for Bifurcation, para. 14, citing **RL-0014**.\n\n13.\n\nAs to the factors that the Tribunal ought to take into consideration when deciding whether to bifurcate the proceedings, the Respondent argues that the primary concern should be that of procedural efficiency.11 In that context, the Respondent submits that other investment tribunals have developed a number of criteria that the Tribunal should take into account, being:\n\na. Whether the jurisdictional objections are *prima facie* serious or frivolous;\n\nb. Whether the objections, if granted, would result in a material reduction in the proceedings at the next stage; and\n\nc. Whether bifurcation is impractical in the sense that the issues of jurisdiction are too intertwined with the merits.12\n\nApplication for Bifurcation, para. 15.\n\nApplication for Bifurcation, paras. 16-22.\n\n*(2) Application of the standard*\n---------------------------------\n\n14.\n\nThe Respondent further contends in respect of each of its jurisdictional objections that (i) they are *prima facie* serious and not frivolous; (ii) if accepted by the Tribunal, they either completely or substantially dispose of the Claimants' case; and (iii) they are not intertwined with the merits.\n\n15.\n\nFirst, the Respondent submits that its jurisdictional objections are *prima facie* serious and not frivolous. Relying on the decision in *Resolute Forest Products v. Canada*,13 the Respondent argues that the required standard should not \"*entail a preview of the jurisdictional objections themselves* ;\" instead, the Tribunal only needs to satisfy itself that the objections are \"*not frivolous or vexatious*\" and are \"*credible and brought in good faith and cannot be excluded on a prima facie basis.*\"14 Moreover, the Respondent suggests that an objection passes the test of being *prima facie* serious and not frivolous if it has been upheld by tribunals in earlier cases.15 Again by reference to the decision in *Mesa v. Canada*, the Respondent contends that, if other tribunals have declined jurisdiction on the basis of a particular jurisdiction objection, the threshold requirement of being substantial and not frivolous is met.16\n\n*Resolute Forest Products Inc. v. Government of Canada*, UNCITRAL, PCA Case No. 2016-13, Procedural Order No. 4 (November 18, 2016) (**RL-0017**).\n\nApplication for Bifurcation, para. 25, citing **RL-0017**, para. 4.4.\n\nApplication for Bifurcation, para. 29.\n\nApplication for Bifurcation, para. 29, referring to **RL-0012**, para. 18.\n\n16.\n\nIn respect of its first jurisdictional objection, the Respondent argues that the First Claimant is precluded from invoking the jurisdiction of the Tribunal because Mr. Khudyan holds an Armenian passport with special residency status on which he relied to make his investment in Armenia. The Respondent submits that, because ICSID tribunals have previously declined jurisdiction in cases where investors possessed dual nationality of the host state and the contracting state, and that \"[t]*his is precisely the situation before the present Tribunal,*\"17 its first jurisdictional objection \"*clearly satisfies the requirement of being substantial and not frivolous.*\"18\n\nApplication for Bifurcation, paras. 27-28.\n\nApplication for Bifurcation, para. 29.\n\n17.\n\nThe Respondent's second jurisdictional objection is based on the contention that the Second Claimant did not make any investment in Armenia. The Respondent submits that the Claimants only make a \"*vague reference to Claimant 2's alleged investment once in their 160-pages Memorial*\" and that the Claimants did not provide a single factual exhibit or any other evidence in support of the Second Claimant's connection with the alleged investment in Armenia.19 The Respondent argues that this objection is \"*a jurisdictional objection* ratione personae *recognized by numerous investment tribunals*\" and that therefore it is \"*serious and not frivolous*\" in nature.20\n\nApplication for Bifurcation, para. 30 (emphasis in the original).\n\nApplication for Bifurcation, para. 30.\n\n18.\n\nIn support of its third jurisdictional objection, the Respondent contends that the Claimants' alleged investment in Armenia does not constitute an investment within the meaning of Article 25 of the ICSID Convention because, \"[o]*n the face of Claimants' allegations as described in Claimants' Memorial, the alleged investment in Armenia was more of a commercial endeavor than an investment.*\"21 Because a similar jurisdictional objection was accepted by other ICSID tribunals, including the *Emmis v. Hungary* tribunal,22 the Respondent claims that its third jurisdictional objection is *prima facie* serious and not frivolous.23\n\nApplication for Bifurcation, para. 31.\n\n*Emmis International Holding, B.V., Emmis Radio Operating, B.V., MEM Magyar Electronic Media Kereskedelmi \u00e9s Szolg\u00e1ltat\u00f3 Kft. v. Hungary*, ICSID Case No. ARB/12/2, Decision on Respondent's Application for Bifurcation (June 13, 2013) (**RL-0009**).\n\nApplication for Bifurcation, paras. 31-32; **RL-0009**.\n\n19.\n\nSecond, the Respondent submits in respect of all of its jurisdictional objections that, if sustained by the Tribunal in the jurisdictional phase, the proceedings on the merits phase would be materially reduced in scope and length. The Respondent alleges that if its first jurisdictional objection were to be upheld, this would dispose of the Claimants' claims in their entirety because the Second Claimant's alleged investment was made entirely through the First Claimant.24 According to the Respondent, the Claimants' claims would be disposed of in their entirety too if the third jurisdictional objection were to be upheld.25 As to its second jurisdictional objection, the Respondent contends that if the Tribunal were to rule in its favor, there would be a substantial reduction of the \"*scope of the issues to be briefed at the next stage,*\"26 factors which led other ICSID tribunals to bifurcate the arbitral proceedings, notably in *United Utilities and Tallinna Vesi v. Estonia*.27\n\nApplication for Bifurcation, paras. 36-37.\n\nApplication for Bifurcation, para. 38.\n\nApplication for Bifurcation, para. 42.\n\nApplication for Bifurcation, paras. 43-45; *United Utilities (Tallinn) B.V. and Aktsiaselts Tallinna Vesi v. Republic of Estonia*, ICSID Case No. ARB/14/24, Procedural Order No. 2 (June 17, 2015) (**RL-0020**).\n\n20.\n\nFinally, the Respondent argues that its jurisdictional objections are distinct from and not intertwined with the merits of the case.\n\n21.\n\nIn respect of its first jurisdictional objection, the Respondent points out that it is based on the fact that the First Claimant holds an Armenian passport and that the Tribunal thus only needs to examine the applicable rules of international law and Armenian national law concerning nationality in order to make a decision with regard to this objection, without conducting an analysis of any facts or legal arguments relating to the merits of the Claimants' claims.28\n\nApplication for Bifurcation, para. 51.\n\n22.\n\nWith regard to its second jurisdictional objection, the Respondent argues that it is based on the fact that the \"*Claimants have not adequately supported their argument that Claimant 2 made an alleged investment in Armenia*\" and that in order to render its decision, the Tribunal would only need to examine \"*the nature of Claimant 2's involvement in the alleged investment as pleaded by Claimants in Claimants' Memorial*,\" again without conducting any factual or legal analysis regarding the merits of the Claimants' substantive claims in this arbitration.29\n\nApplication for Bifurcation, para. 52 (emphasis in the original).\n\n23.\n\nWith regard to its third jurisdictional objection, the Respondent contends that the Tribunal only needs to examine the nature of the Claimants' investment as described in the Claimants' Memorial and whether based on such description it qualifies as an \"*investment*\" under Article 25 of the ICSID Convention, without the need to \"*examine the substantive grounds pleaded by Claimants in Claimants' Memorial.*\"30 The Respondent alleges that the Claimants' investment were made during the time period between 2004 and 2007, while the merits of the dispute and the Claimants' substantive claims are concerned with separate events which took place from 2010 onwards.31\n\nApplication for Bifurcation, para. 53.\n\nApplication for Bifurcation, paras. 55-58.\n\n24.\n\nBased on the foregoing, the Respondent argues that the Tribunal should exercise its discretion and order the bifurcation of the proceedings in this arbitration.\n\n**B. The Claimants' Position**\n------------------------------\n\n25.\n\nIn their Response to the Application for Bifurcation, the Claimants submit that none of the Respondent's jurisdictional objections \"*justifies the delay and costs that a bifurcated proceeding would necessarily entail.*\"32 They argue that the Respondent's first and third jurisdictional objections are *prima facie* not serious and that the Respondent's second objection, even if upheld, will not materially reduce the scope of issues to be considered by the Tribunal.33\n\nResponse to the Application for Bifurcation, para. 2.\n\nResponse to the Application for Bifurcation, para. 2.\n\n*(1) Legal standard*\n--------------------\n\n26.\n\nThe Claimants agree with the Respondent that the Tribunal has the discretionary power under Article 41(2) of the ICSID Convention and Arbitration Rule 41(3) and 41(4) to order bifurcation but disagree in two respects with the legal standard the Respondent proposes. While the Claimants accept that the Tribunal ought to consider (i) whether bifurcation, if granted, would lead to a material reduction in the proceedings; and (ii) whether the jurisdictional objections are too intertwined with the merits of the case for the bifurcation to be granted,34 they do not agree with the third criterion of *prima facie* serious or frivolous, as formulated by the Respondent. According to the Claimants, the *prima facie* test should rather focus on \"*whether the objections* have merit *and are not frivolous.*\"35\n\nApplication for Bifurcation, para. 21.\n\nResponse to the Application for Bifurcation, para. 10 (emphasis in the original).\n\n27.\n\nIn that framework, the Claimants submit that the standard proposed by the Respondent would allow \"*conclusory objections unsupported by specific factual allegations*\" to serve as a basis for bifurcation without considering whether or not such objection might actually succeed.36 They dispute that, if a jurisdictional objection is of a type that other investment tribunals have upheld in the past, the *prima facie* standard is met. The Claimants assert that, in order for a jurisdictional objection to rise above the threshold of serious and not frivolous, it must be supported by specific factual allegations, demonstrating that the objection might succeed in that specific case.37 In this respect, the mere articulation of a generic objection, upheld in other cases, is not sufficient to satisfy this standard, as held by the tribunals in *Eco Oro v. Colombia* and *Glencore v. Bolivia*.38\n\nResponse to the Application for Bifurcation, paras. 4 and 11.\n\nResponse to the Application for Bifurcation, paras. 11-12.\n\nResponse to the Application for Bifurcation, paras. 13-14; *Eco Oro Minerals Corp. v. Republic of Colombia*, ICSID Case No. ARB/16/41, Procedural Order No. 2 (June 28, 2018) (**CL-85**), para. 51; *Glencore Finance (Bermuda) Limited v. The Plurinational State of Bolivia*, UNCITRAL, PCA Case No. 2016-39, Procedural Order No. 2 (January 31, 2018) (**CL-98**), paras. 45 and 47.\n\n28.\n\nThe Claimants further argue that the Respondent's reliance on the decisions in *Resolute Forest v. Canada* and *Mesa v. Canada* does not advance its case, as both arbitrations were conducted under the 1976 version of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules, which specifically provides for a presumption in favor of bifurcation, which is not the case for the ICSID Arbitration Rules since they were amended in 2006.39 Furthermore, the Claimants point out that in *Mesa v. Canada* the tribunal considered the jurisdictional objection to be *prima facie* serious not because the same type of objection had been upheld by other tribunals before, but because in that case Canada had substantiated its objection with specific factual allegations.40\n\nResponse to the Application for Bifurcation, paras. 8 and 16.\n\nResponse to the Application for Bifurcation, para. 17, referring to **RL-0012**, para. 18.\n\n*(2) Application of the standard*\n---------------------------------\n\n29.\n\nThe Claimants submit that the jurisdictional objections advanced by the Respondent do not merit bifurcation for the following reasons.\n\n30.\n\nFirst, the Claimants deny that there is a presumption in favor of bifurcation in ICSID arbitration and argue that the Respondent's contention to the effect that bifurcation of jurisdictional objections is \"*standard procedure*\" is wrong and contradicted by its own legal authorities.41 The Claimants point out that both the ICSID website and the ICSID Secretariat's Working Paper for the proposed amendment of the Arbitration Rules unequivocally state that there is no presumption in favor of bifurcation, which is in line with the drafting history of the ICSID Convention and the Arbitration Rules.42 In addition, the Claimants contend that the Respondent's assertion is contradicted by the statistics, which reveal that, in the majority of cases, ICSID tribunals did not bifurcate the proceedings to deal with jurisdictional objections on a preliminary basis.43 Lastly, the Claimants argue that the Respondent's reliance on the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules in its attempt to prove a presumption in favor of bifurcation is inapposite because that presumption was part of the 1976 version but has been removed from the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules at the occasion of their revision in 2010.44\n\nResponse to the Application for Bifurcation, paras. 5-6.\n\nResponse to the Application for Bifurcation, para. 7, referring to *inter alia* **CL-97**, **CL-90**, para. 393 and **CL-87**, pp. 35, 148-149 and 151.\n\nResponse to the Application for Bifurcation, para. 9.\n\nResponse to the Application for Bifurcation, para. 8, citing **CL-95** and **CL-96**.\n\n31.\n\nSecond, the Claimants insist that for an objection to be *prima facie* serious, it must be supported by specific factual allegations, showing that the objection might succeed in the specific case. In that framework, the Claimants argue that the Respondent's first and third jurisdictional objections are simple conclusory statements and that neither of them is substantiated by factual allegations or evidence. On that basis, the Claimants conclude that the jurisdictional objections are not sufficiently serious to warrant bifurcation.45\n\nResponse to the Application for Bifurcation, para. 18.\n\n32.\n\nMore specifically, the Claimants submit that the Respondent's first jurisdictional objection to the effect that the Tribunal would lack jurisdiction *ratione personae* over the First Claimant does not warrant bifurcation because it is not *prima facie* serious. The Claimants point out that the Respondent does not allege that the First Claimant ever had Armenian nationality within the meaning of Article 25 of the ICSID Convention.46 In addition, the Claimants argue that the Respondent's reliance on Mr. Khudyan's special residency status in Armenia is futile because that status is not equal to nationality under Armenian law. Rather, it is a special status granted to foreigners under the Law of the Republic of Armenia on Foreigners,47 which defines foreigners as \"*persons who are not citizens of the Republic of Armenia and hold the citizenship of another State (foreign citizens).*\"48 The Claimants argue that the mere fact that the First Claimant enjoyed special residency status demonstrates in and of itself that he was not a national of the Republic of Armenia and, therefore, the Respondent's first jurisdictional objections is not *prima facie* serious and is frivolous.49 Moreover, the Claimants point out that even if one were to equate special residency status with nationality, the First Claimant no longer has special residency status since January 22, 2014.50 As a result, on the date he consented to ICSID arbitration by submitting the Request for Arbitration (September 18, 2017) and on the date when the Request for Arbitration was registered by ICSID (September 27, 2017), Mr. Khudyan was not an Armenian national and therefore would still qualify as an investor under Article 25 of the ICSID Convention.51\n\nResponse to the Application for Bifurcation, para. 20.\n\nResponse to the Application for Bifurcation, para. 21, referring to the Claimants' Memorial, para. 22, as well as **Exhibit C-23**, Articles 14-18.\n\n**Exhibit C-23**, Article 2.\n\nResponse to the Application for Bifurcation, para. 21.\n\nResponse to the Application for Bifurcation, paras. 22-23, referring to **Exhibit C-17**.\n\nResponse to the Application for Bifurcation, paras. 22-25.\n\n33.\n\nFurthermore, the Claimants argue that the Respondent's second jurisdictional objection to the effect that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction *ratione personae* over the Second Claimant does not warrant bifurcation because, even if upheld by the Tribunal, it would not lead to any reduction in the proceedings at the next stage. The Claimants submits that the Respondent's position is based on the erroneous assumption that the investment of each of the Claimants is separate and that the Claimants are requesting an allocation of damages between them, which they are not, because their investment is one and the same.52 It is the Claimants' case that the Second Claimant's standing follows from its indirect control of the First Claimant's investment, and that regardless of whether or not the Second Claimant is a party to this arbitration, the First Claimant can still claim full compensation for the harm caused by the Respondent to the investment.53 As a result, the Tribunal would still need to analyze all of the Respondent's acts and omissions in respect of which the Claimants complain, as well as the issues of liability and damages. The Claimants further argue that there is not a single case in which a tribunal bifurcated proceedings to consider an objection \"*that would remove only one out of multiple claimants in a case.*\"54 On that basis, the Claimants conclude that bifurcation of the Respondent's second jurisdictional objection would not lead to procedural efficiency and should therefore be rejected by the Tribunal.\n\nResponse to the Application for Bifurcation, para. 33.\n\nResponse to the Application for Bifurcation, para. 33.\n\nResponse to the Application for Bifurcation, para. 34.\n\n34.\n\nFinally, the Claimants submit that the Respondent's third jurisdictional objection that the Tribunal does not have jurisdiction *ratione materiae* over the Claimants' investment does not pass the *prima facie* serious and not frivolous test because the Respondent did not allege a single fact in support of its objection but instead proffered the unsubstantiated statement to the effect that \"[o]*n the face of Claimants' allegations as described in Claimants' Memorial, the alleged investment in Armenia was more of a commercial endeavor than an investment.*\"55 The Claimants further point out that the *Emmis v. Hungary* case relied on by the Respondent in support of this objection must be distinguished from the present case because Hungary's objection against the tribunal's jurisdiction *ratione materiae* was supported by specific factual allegations that challenged the existence of specific legal rights under Hungarian law, and Hungary substantiated its objection to such a degree that the claimants in that case adduced expert evidence in response to the objection.56 According to the Claimants, the only thing that the Respondent's objection has in common with Hungary's objection is that, \"*at the most general level, both are objections* ratione materiae.\"57\n\nResponse to the Application for Bifurcation, para. 28, quoting Application for Bifurcation, para. 31.\n\nResponse to the Application for Bifurcation, para. 29 referring to **RL-0009**, paras. 33-34.\n\nResponse to the Application for Bifurcation, para. 30.\n\n**III. THE TRIBUNAL'S ANALYSIS**\n--------------------------------\n\n35.\n\nOn a preliminary note, the Tribunal emphasizes that this decision only concerns the question whether the arbitral proceedings should be bifurcated or not. The Tribunal's analysis of the relevant issues and its decision are based on the record as it stood on October 1, 2018. The Tribunal is yet to form a view as to the merits of the Respondent's jurisdictional objections, which it will do only once these objections have been fully briefed by the Parties. Nothing in this decision is intended to prejudge the Respondent's jurisdictional objections or to preclude the Tribunal's full consideration of the factual or legal issues underlying the Respondent's jurisdictional objections at a later date.\n\n**A. Legal Standard**\n---------------------\n\n36.\n\nThe Parties are in agreement that the Tribunal has the power to rule on the Respondent's Application for Bifurcation. The Tribunal's power stems from Article 41(2) of the ICSID Convention which provides that:\n\n[*a*]*ny objection by a party to the dispute that that dispute is not within the jurisdiction of the Centre, or for other reasons is not within the competence of the Tribunal, shall be considered by the Tribunal which shall determine whether to deal with it as a preliminary question or to join it to the merits of the dispute.*\n\n37.\n\nIn the same vein, Arbitration Rule 41(4) provides in relevant part that the Tribunal:\n\n*may deal with the objection as a preliminary question or join it to the merits of the dispute. If the Tribunal overrules the objection or joins it to the merits, it shall once more fix time limits for the further procedures.*\n\n38.\n\nIt is common ground that this arbitration is brought under the ICSID Convention and conducted in accordance with the Arbitration Rules in force as of April 10, 2006. The Tribunal notes that neither the ICSID Convention nor the applicable Arbitration Rules require the suspension of the proceedings on the merits pending the resolution of jurisdictional objections, as did the ICSID Arbitration Rules before their amendment in 2004.58 The ICSID Convention and the Arbitration Rules leave the matter to the discretion of the Tribunal. As there is no general presumption in favor of bifurcation under the ICSID Convention or the Arbitration Rules, the Tribunal will exercise its discretion under Article 41(2) of the ICSID Convention and Arbitration Rule 41(4) in light of the particular facts and circumstances of the present case.\n\nRule 41(3), ICSID Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings 1984: \"*Upon the formal raising of an objection relating to the dispute, the proceeding on the merits shall be suspended.*\"\n\n39.\n\nThe Tribunal is mindful that in deciding bifurcation applications, other tribunals have identified certain factors as important to their analysis. The Tribunal notes that the Parties are in agreement in respect of two of those factors, and that those factors ought to be taken into consideration by the Tribunal in deciding the Application for Bifurcation before it. These are:\n\na. Whether the objections, if granted, would lead to a material reduction of the proceedings; and\n\nb. Whether substantial procedural economy can be gained by dealing with the jurisdictional objections advanced on a preliminary basis or whether the objections are so intertwined with the merits of the case that bifurcation is impractical.59\n\nApplication for Bifurcation, para. 21; Response to the Application for Bifurcation, para. 10.\n\n40.\n\nThe Parties disagree as to the scope of a third potentially relevant factor, i.e., whether the jurisdictional objections raised by the Respondent are *prima facie* serious or frivolous. The Respondent argues that the *prima facie* test will be satisfied as long as objections similar to those advanced in the present case have been \"*upheld by tribunals in previous decisions.*\"60 The Respondent contends that, because jurisdictional objections of the same or similar nature have been accepted by other ICSID tribunals, the three jurisdictional objections it raised satisfy the *prima facie* test of being serious and therefore justify bifurcation.61 The Claimants, by contrast, contend that \"*the party seeking bifurcation of proceedings must support its application with specific factual allegations from which a tribunal can conclude that the objection might succeed in the specific case.*\"62\n\nApplication for Bifurcation, para. 29.\n\nApplication for Bifurcation, paras. 26-32.\n\nResponse to the Application for Bifurcation, para. 18.\n\n41.\n\nThe Tribunal does not accept that jurisdictional objections of the same or similar nature as jurisdictional objections that have been upheld in the past by other ICSID tribunals automatically satisfy the *prima facie* test. Jurisdictional objections are not raised in the abstract but in the context of a specific factual matrix that gave rise to the dispute. Therefore, the Tribunal will take into consideration all facts and circumstances in respect of the present dispute that have been adduced so far. For the Respondent to demonstrate on a *prima facie* basis that its jurisdictional objections are serious and not frivolous, it must adduce the relevant facts on a preliminary basis and substantiate why in the circumstances of this particular case its jurisdictional objections have a chance of succeeding.63 Like the *Glencore* and *Eco Oro* tribunals, this Tribunal finds that mere assertions are not sufficient to satisfy the required threshold and that, in order for this factor to weigh in favor of bifurcation, the Respondent's jurisdictional objections must be supported by concrete factual allegations and the Respondent must make a *prima facie* showing of their potential success on their merits.64\n\nResponse to the Application for Bifurcation, para. 12.\n\n**CL-98**, paras. 45-47. See also, **CL-85**, para. 51.\n\n42.\n\nIn light of the foregoing, the Tribunal will assess the Respondent's bifurcation request against the three following criteria:\n\na. Whether the jurisdictional objections are *prima facie* serious and not frivolous;\n\nb. Whether the jurisdictional objections, if successful, would dispose of the dispute in whole or in part, thereby leading to a material reduction of the scope of the proceedings; and\n\nc. Whether and to what extent the jurisdictional objections are intertwined with the merits of the case so as to make bifurcation impractical.\n\n**B. Application of the Legal Standard to the Respondent's Jurisdictional Objections**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*(1) Jurisdiction* Ratione Personae *over the First Claimant*\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n43.\n\nThe Respondent's first jurisdictional objection to the effect that the Tribunal does not have jurisdiction *ratione personae* over the First Claimant is based on the allegation that the First Claimant used an Armenian passport with special residency status to make the purported investment in Armenia.65 The Respondent alleges that, because a national of the host state cannot qualify as an \"*investor*\" in the sense of Article 25(2)(a) of the ICSID Convention, the Tribunal does not have jurisdiction over Mr. Khudyan.66\n\n**Exhibit C-17** ; Application for Bifurcation, para. 26.\n\nApplication for Bifurcation, paras. 26-27.\n\n44.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention provides that the jurisdiction of the Centre shall extend to any legal dispute between a Contracting State to the Convention and a \"*national of another Contracting State.*\" Article 25(2)(a) goes on to define the term \"*national of another Contracting State*\" as:\n\n*any natural person who had the nationality of a Contracting State other than the State party to the dispute on the date on which the parties consented to submit such dispute to conciliation or arbitration as well as on the date on which the request was registered pursuant to paragraph (3) of Article 28 or paragraph (3) of Article 36, but does not include any person who on either date also had the nationality of the Contracting State party to the dispute*. (emphasis added)\n\n45.\n\nIt is commonplace that the test of Article 25(2)(a) is based on the notion of nationality. If the First Claimant held Armenian nationality on either the date of the filing of the Request for Arbitration, or on the date when the Request for Arbitration was registered by ICSID, the Tribunal would not have jurisdiction over the First Claimant. The Claimants placed on record the Armenian passport of Mr. Khudyan, which states \"*SPECIAL RESIDENCY STATUS.*\"67 The Tribunal notes that Article 21 of the Law of the Republic of Armenia \"On the Status of Foreign Citizens in the Republic of Armenia\" defines \"*Special Resident Status*\" as follows:68\n\n*Special resident status may be granted to f oreign citizens of Armenian origin.*\n\n*The special resident status may also be granted to other foreign citizens who carry on economic, cultural activity in the Republic of Armenia.*\n\n*The special resident status shall be granted for a period of ten years. It may be granted more than once.* (emphasis added)\n\n**Exhibit C-17**, p. 1.\n\n**Exhibit C-7**, p. 3.\n\n46.\n\nThe Tribunal further notes that the Law of the Republic of Armenia \"On Foreigners' provides in Article 18 \"Grounds and terms for granting special residence status,\" as part of Chapter 3 \"RESIDENT STATUS OF FOREIGNERS IN THE REPUBLIC OF ARMENIA\" as follows:69\n\n*1. Special residence status shall be granted to foreigners of Armenian origin. Special residence status may also be granted to other foreigners who carry out economic or cultural activities in the Republic of Armenia.*\n\n*2. Special residence status shall be granted for a term of ten years. It may be granted more than once.* (emphasis added)\n\n**Exhibit C-23**, p. 9.\n\n47.\n\nIn addition, Article 2 of the same Law defines \"*foreigners*\" as:\n\n*persons who are not citizens of the Republic of Armenia and hold the citizenship of another State (foreign citizens) or do not hold the citizenship of any State (stateless persons).* (emphasis added)\n\n48.\n\nOn the basis of the record at present, the Tribunal understands that, as a matter of Armenian law, special residency status is only granted to \"*foreigners,*\" who - by definition - do not hold Armenian nationality. This appears to have been the case for the First Claimant, as his Armenian passport not only carries the mention \"*SPECIAL RESIDENCY STATUS*\"70 but also identifies Mr. Khudyan's nationality as \"*UNITED STATES.*\"71 On the basis of the record to date, the Respondent has not made a *prima facie* showing that at any relevant moment Mr. Khudyan held Armenian nationality, and thus did not qualify as an \"*investor*\" within the meaning of Article 25(2)(a) of the ICSID Convention.\n\n**Exhibit C-17**, p. 1.\n\n**Exhibit C-17**, p. 2.\n\n49.\n\nMoreover, the Tribunal notes that Mr. Khudyan's Armenian passport with the mention \"*SPECIAL RESIDENCY STATUS*\" expired on January 22, 2014,72 as a result of which his special residency status in the Republic of Armenia had expired on the date of the submission of the Request for Arbitration on September 18, 2017, as well as on the date the Request for Arbitration was registered by ICSID on September 27, 2017.\n\n**Exhibit C-17**, p. 2.\n\n50.\n\nBased on this *prima facie* analysis of the record to date, the Tribunal considers that the Respondent has not made a showing that this objection is *prima facie* serious and not frivolous. In these circumstances, it also appears at present that there is not a realistic chance that the first jurisdictional objection will dispose of the dispute in whole or in part. Therefore, the Tribunal is not convinced that any significant procedural efficiency can be gained by dealing with the first jurisdictional objection on a preliminary basis.\n\n51.\n\nFor these reasons, the Tribunal decides that the Respondent's first jurisdictional objection does not warrant bifurcation of the proceedings.\n\n*(2) Jurisdiction* Ratione Personae *over the Second Claimant*\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n52.\n\nThe Respondent's second jurisdictional objection to the effect that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction *ratione personae* over the Second Claimant is based on the allegation that Arin Capital & Investment Corp. did not have an investment in Armenia. In response, the Claimants submit that, regardless of the merits of this objection, bifurcation would not lead to procedural efficiencies, because the Second Claimant's investment is not distinct and separate from the First Claimant's and the Second Claimant's \"*standing comes from its indirect control of Mr. Khudyan's investment.*\"73\n\nResponse to the Application for Bifurcation, para. 33.\n\n53.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that Claimants do not object to bifurcation of this objection on the basis that it is not *prima facie* serious or is frivolous. Rather, they claim that, even if the objection had merit, bifurcation would not be warranted because it would not result in any procedural efficiencies. In view of the Tribunal's decision that the Respondent's first jurisdictional objection should not be bifurcated, the Tribunal considers that the second objection also should not be bifurcated because it appears unlikely to create procedural efficiencies. This is because the Claimants' claims appear to be one and the same. Even if the Respondent's second objection were successful, the Tribunal would still need to analyze and decide liability and quantum with respect to Mr. Khudyan.\n\n54.\n\nOn that basis, the Tribunal finds that the Respondent's second jurisdictional objection does not justify the bifurcation of the proceedings.\n\n*(3) Jurisdiction* Ratione Materiae *over the Investment*\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n55.\n\nThe Respondent's third jurisdictional objection to the effect that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction *ratione materiae* is based on the allegation that the Claimants' alleged investment does not constitute an \"*investment*\" in the sense of Article 25 of the ICSID Convention. This jurisdictional objection is based on an assertion that \"[o]*n the face of Claimants' allegations as described in Claimants' Memorial, the alleged investment in Armenia was more of a commercial endeavour than an investment*,\"74 without any factual or legal substantiation.\n\nApplication for Bifurcation, para. 31.\n\n56.\n\nThe Tribunal cannot form a *prima facie* view as to whether this jurisdictional objection is serious and has any chance of success on the basis of a mere assertion only, which is neither supported by facts nor by evidence. In light of the skeletal substantiation of the third jurisdictional objection so far, the Tribunal also is not presently in a position to determine whether there is any realistic chance that the third jurisdictional objection would dispose of the dispute in whole or in part and thereby reduce the scope of the proceedings on the merits.\n\n57.\n\nOn the other hand, the inquiry into the question as to whether the Claimants have a qualifying \"*investment*\" in the sense of Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention involves issues of law and fact which are inextricably intertwined with the merits of the dispute. In order to form a view, the Tribunal requires a deeper understanding of the context and the circumstances in which the Claimants invested in Armenia, the use of their investment and their interaction with the Respondent and its organs. Accordingly, the Tribunal believes that the objection raises issues that are intertwined with the merits, rendering bifurcation impractical.\n\n58.\n\nIn light of the foregoing, the Tribunal is not convinced that the arbitral proceedings should be bifurcated to deal with the third jurisdictional objection on a preliminary basis.\n\n**IV.

INTRODUCTION AND PARTIES**\n-------------------------------\n\n1.\n\nThis case concerns a dispute submitted to the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (\"**ICSID**\" or the \"**Centre**\") on the basis of the Treaty between the United States of America and the Republic of Armenia Concerning the Reciprocal Encouragement and Protection of Investment, which entered into force on March 29, 1996 (the \"**BIT**\" or \"**Treaty**\"), and the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States, which entered into force on October 14, 1966 (the \"**ICSID Convention**\").\n\n2.\n\nThe claimants are Mr. Edmond Khudyan (\"**Mr. Khudyan**\" or \"**Claimant 1**\"), a natural person having the nationality of United States of America, and Arin Capital & Investment Corp. (\"**Arin US**\" or \"**Claimant 2**\"), a company incorporated under the laws of California, United States of America (together, the \"**Claimants**\").\n\n3.\n\nThe respondent is the Republic of Armenia (\"**Armenia**\" or the \"**Respondent**\").\n\n4.\n\nThe Claimants and the Respondent are collectively referred to as the \"**Parties**.\" The Parties' representatives and their addresses are listed above on page (i).\n\n5.\n\nThis dispute relates to Mr. Khudyan and Arin US's alleged interests in a luxury apartment real estate development located [REDACTED], held via a locally incorporated company Arin Capital Investments LLC (\"**Arin Armenia**\"), and the Respondent's alleged failure to protect the Claimants from \"*an elaborate criminal scheme*1*\"* resulting in the siphoning off of Arin Armenia's assets.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Memorial, \u00b64.\n\n**II. PROCEDURAL HISTORY**\n--------------------------\n\n6.\n\nOn September 18, 2017, ICSID received a request for arbitration dated September 18, 2017 from Mr. Khudyan and Arin US against Armenia (the \"**Request**\").\n\n7.\n\nOn September 27, 2017, the Secretary-General of ICSID registered the Request in accordance with Article 36(3) of the ICSID Convention and notified the Parties of the registration. In the Notice of Registration, the Secretary-General invited the Parties to proceed to constitute an arbitral tribunal as soon as possible in accordance with Rule 7(d) of ICSID Rules of Procedure for the Institution of Conciliation and Arbitration Proceedings.\n\n8.\n\nOn November 29, 2017, following several exchanges, the Parties agreed upon a method for constituting the Tribunal, providing that the Tribunal shall consist of three arbitrators, one arbitrator appointed by each Party and the third, who shall be the President of the Tribunal, appointed by agreement of the Parties.\n\n9.\n\nOn December 6, 2017, the Claimants appointed Ms. Marney Cheek, a national of the United States of America, as an arbitrator. On December 19, 2017, the Claimants informed the Secretariat that the appointment of Ms. Cheek was withdrawn and that the Parties had agreed to extend the deadlines to appoint the Members of the Tribunal. The Respondent confirmed the Parties\u2019 agreement on the same date.\n\n10.\n\nOn December 21, 2017, the Claimants appointed Ms. Ank Santens, a national of Belgium, as an arbitrator in this case. Ms. Santens accepted her appointment on December 26, 2017.\n\n11.\n\nOn January 16, 2018, the Respondent appointed Prof. Zachary Douglas QC, a national of Australia, as an arbitrator in this case. Prof. Douglas accepted his appointment on January 18, 2018.\n\n12.\n\nOn February 22, 2018, Ms. Santens informed the Centre that the Parties and the co-arbitrators had agreed upon a method for the appointment of the President of the Tribunal, which superseded any prior agreement between the Parties.\n\n13.\n\nOn March 14, 2018, Ms. Santens and Prof. Douglas informed the Centre that the Parties had agreed to appoint Ms. Melanie van Leeuwen, a national of The Netherlands, as President of the Tribunal.\n\n14.\n\nOn March 15, 2018, the ICSID Secretary-General, in accordance with Rule 6(1) of the ICSID Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings (the \"**Arbitration Rules**\"), notified the Parties that all three arbitrators had accepted their appointments and that the Tribunal was therefore deemed to have been constituted on that date. Mr. Jean-Paul Le Cannu, ICSID Legal Counsel, was designated to serve as Secretary of the Tribunal. The Parties were later informed that Ms. Laura Bergamini, ICSID Legal Counsel, would replace Mr. Le Cannu as Secretary of the Tribunal. Ms. Aur\u00e9lia Antonietti, ICSID Senior Legal Counsel, served as Secretary of the Tribunal during Ms. Bergamini\u2019s maternity leave.\n\n15.\n\nOn April 7, 2018, following several exchanges with the Parties, the Secretary of the Tribunal confirmed that the first session would be held on April 24, 2018 and transmitted to the Parties a draft Procedural Order No. 1 and a draft agenda in advance of the first session.\n\n16.\n\nOn April 19, 2018, the Parties jointly submitted their comments on the draft Procedural Order No. 1. In the revised draft, the Claimants identified their representatives as follows: Mr. James H. Boykin and Mr. Alexander Bedrosyan.\n\n17.\n\nOn April 22, 2018, the Parties jointly submitted a proposed timetable for the proceedings.\n\n18.\n\nOn April 24, 2018, the Tribunal held a first session with the Parties by teleconference, in accordance with Arbitration Rule 13(1).\n\n19.\n\nOn May 30, 2018, the Claimants updated the list of their representatives pursuant to Arbitration Rule 18 and requested that Dr. Gevorg Tumanov of ELL Partnership be added as counsel of record.\n\n20.\n\nOn May 31, 2018, the Secretary of the Tribunal transmitted to the Parties a revised draft Procedural Order No. 1 including an updated list of the Parties\u2019 representatives, along with draft timetables for the proceedings.\n\n21.\n\nOn June 6, 2018, the Parties confirmed their agreement with the timetables annexed to the revised draft Procedural Order No. 1.\n\n22.\n\nOn June 7, 2018, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 1 recording the agreement of the Parties on procedural matters. Procedural Order No. 1 provides, *inter alia*, that the applicable Arbitration Rules would be those in effect from April 10, 2006, that the procedural language would be English, and that the place of proceeding would be Washington, D.C., United States of America. Annex B to Procedural Order No. 1 also sets out the agreed schedules applicable to the proceedings (which were later amended, as discussed below).\n\n23.\n\nOn June 27, 2018, the Respondent objected to the addition of Dr. Tumanov as counsel of record for the Claimants, alleging that he had worked on the case while in the employment of the Ministry of Justice of the Republic of Armenia.\n\n24.\n\nOn July 3, 2018, the Claimants responded to the Respondent's letter of June 27, 2018, denying the existence of a conflict of interest.\n\n25.\n\nOn July 12, 2018, the Respondent formally requested that the Tribunal proceed with the removal of Dr. Tumanov as counsel of record (\"**Application for the Removal of Dr. Tumanov**\") and submitted Exhibit R-0001 and Legal Authorities RL-0001 and RL--0002.\n\n26.\n\nOn July 20, 2018, in accordance with the agreed timetable, the Claimants submitted their Memorial on Jurisdiction and the Merits (\"**Memorial**\"), together with: the Witness Statement of Mr. Edmond Khudyan dated July 20, 2018 (\"**Khudyan\u2019s First Witness Statement**\"); the Witness Statement of [REDACTED] dated July 20, 2018; the Witness Statement of [REDACTED] dated June 15, 2018; Exhibits C- 0001 through C--0131; and Legal Authorities CL-0001 through CL-0081.\n\n27.\n\nOn July 27, 2018, the Claimants submitted their response to the Application for the Removal of Dr. Tumanov, along with a letter dated July 25, 2018 from Dr. Tumanov to the Tribunal and Legal Authority CL-0082. The Claimants requested that the Tribunal deny the Respondent's application.\n\n28.\n\nOn August 10, 2018, the Respondent responded to the Claimants' July 27 letter and submitted Legal Authorities RL-0003 through RL-0008.\n\n29.\n\nOn August 17, 2018, the Claimants replied to the Respondent\u2019s letter of August 10, 2018 and submitted a letter dated August 15, 2018 from Dr. Tumanov to the Tribunal.\n\n30.\n\nOn August 31, 2018, in accordance with the agreed timetable, the Respondent submitted an application for bifurcation, together with Legal Authorities RL-0009 through RL-0022 (the \"**Application for Bifurcation**\"). The Respondent set out three jurisdictional objections that, it indicated, would be detailed further in the jurisdictional phase. The Respondent also requested that the proceedings be bifurcated into a preliminary phase dealing with its jurisdictional objections and that the proceedings on the merits be suspended pending a decision on the Respondent\u2019s jurisdictional objections.\n\n31.\n\nOn September 14, 2018, the Respondent submitted its requests for production of documents related to jurisdiction.\n\n32.\n\nOn September 17, 2018, the Claimants filed their response to the Application for Bifurcation along with Legal Authorities CL-0083 through CL-0100, requesting that the Tribunal deny the Application for Bifurcation.\n\n33.\n\nOn October 1, 2018, the Parties were informed that the Tribunal had decided to join the Respondent\u2019s jurisdictional objections to the merits and that the reasons for its decision would follow in due course.\n\n34.\n\nOn December 5, 2018, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 2 rejecting the Application for the Removal of Dr. Tumanov.\n\n35.\n\nOn the same date, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 3, wherein it set out the reasons for its decision on the Respondent\u2019s Application for Bifurcation.\n\n36.\n\nOn January 15, 2019, the Respondent informed the Tribunal that the Parties (i) had agreed on an extension of the deadline to submit the Respondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction and the Merits until February 28, 2019; and (ii) would discuss and attempt to agree on respective extensions to the subsequent deadlines in Annex B-2 to Procedural Order No. 1. The Claimants confirmed their agreement on January 16, 2019.\n\n37.\n\nOn January 17, 2019, the Tribunal approved the modification to the procedural timetable agreed to by the Parties.\n\n38.\n\nOn February 18, 2019, the Parties circulated a revised procedural calendar for these proceedings, which was approved by the Tribunal on February 18, 2019.\n\n39.\n\nOn February 28, 2019, the Respondent filed its Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction and the Merits (\"**counter-Memorial**\"), together with the Expert Opinion of [REDACTED] dated February 21, 2019; the Expert Opinion of [REDACTED] dated February 26, 2019 (**[REDACTED] First Expert Opinion**\"); the Expert Opinion of [REDACTED] dated February 22, 2019; the Expert Opinion of [REDACTED] dated February 22, 2019; Exhibits R-0002 through R-0105; and Legal Authorities RL-0023 through RL-0141.\n\n40.\n\nOn March 21, 2019, the Parties exchanged their requests for production of documents.\n\n41.\n\nOn April 4, 2019, the Parties exchanged their respective objections to the other Party\u2019s requests for production of documents.\n\n42.\n\nOn April 17 and 18, 2019, the Parties filed their replies to the other Party\u2019s objections to the requests for production of documents and asked the Tribunal to rule on certain of their requests.\n\n43.\n\nOn May 13, 2019, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 4 ruling on the Parties\u2019 document production requests. In its Order, the Tribunal, *inter alia,* requested that the Parties provide clarification on the Respondent\u2019s Document Request No. 8.\n\n44.\n\nOn May 19 and 20, 2019, the Claimants and the Respondent responded to the Tribunal\u2019s request for clarification concerning the Respondent\u2019s Document Request No. 8.\n\n45.\n\nOn June 7, 2019, the Tribunal wrote to the Parties indicating that (i) on the basis of the clarifications provided by Mr. Khudyan on May 19, 2019, it concluded that \"*no Documents exist that are responsive to the Respondent\u2019s Request No. 8 in respect of Claimant No. 1 ('Documents showing that Claimant 1 ... duly paid the taxes on income arising out of the sales of the apartments [REDACTED]\u2019)\";* and that (ii)\n\n*Insofar as the Respondent\u2019s Request No. 8 concerns \"Documents showing that ... Arin Capital LLC duly paid the taxes on income arising out of the sales of the apartments [REDACTED],\" the Tribunal concludes on the basis of the Parties\u2019 observations set forth in the Redfern Schedule, as well as the additional clarifications in the Respondent\u2019s letter of May 20, 2019, that the Parties in fact agree that Arin Capital LLC never paid any taxes on the pertinent transactions. On that basis, the Tribunal concludes that there also exist no Documents that are responsive to the Respondent\u2019s Request No. 8 in respect of Arin Capital LLC.*\n\n46.\n\nOn June 13, 2019, the Tribunal invited the Parties *\"to confer in order to attempt to agree on the most suitable place for the hearing and revert to the Tribunal with their common position or their respective position*s.\"\n\n47.\n\nOn June 20, 2019, the Parties informed the Tribunal that they were unable to reach an agreement on a venue for the hearing and provided their respective positions on the matter.\n\n48.\n\nOn June 24, 2019, the Tribunal informed the Parties that, absent a different agreement between the Parties, the hearing would be held in Washington, D.C., in accordance with Article 62 of the Convention and Arbitration Rule 13(3).\n\n49.\n\nOn July 1, 2019, the Claimants filed their Reply, along with the Second Witness Statement of [REDACTED] dated June 25, 2019 (\"**Khudyan\u2019s Second Witness Statement**\"), the Expert Report of [REDACTED] dated June 4, 2019, Exhibits C-0132 through C-0341 and Legal Authorities CL-0101 through CL-0167.\n\n50.\n\nOn July 11, 2019, the Claimants requested leave to submit a corrected version of their Reply and to produce copies of certain exhibits and a legal authority cited therein (Exhibits C-0342-ARM and C-0343-ARM and Legal Authority CL-0168). The Tribunal granted the Claimants' application on July 31, 2019.\n\n51.\n\nOn September 20, 2019, Mr. Teddy Baldwin informed the Tribunal that Armenia had instructed Steptoe & Johnson to replace CMS Hasche Sigle, and requested a one-month extension to file the Respondent's Rejoinder.\n\n52.\n\nOn September 23, 2019, the Centre acknowledged receipt of Mr. Baldwin's communication and invited the Respondent to provide an updated power of attorney.\n\n53.\n\nOn September 27, 2019, the Tribunal informed the Parties that it would confirm the amended deadline for the submission of the Respondent\u2019s Rejoinder following receipt of the updated power of attorney from the Republic of Armenia.\n\n54.\n\nOn November 12, 2019, the Respondent submitted an updated power of attorney identifying Mr. Teddy Baldwin and Mr. Yeghishe Kirakosyan as counsel of record.\n\n55.\n\nOn November 15, 2019, the Respondent filed its Rejoinder, along with the Witness Statement of [REDACTED] dated November 14, 2019, the Second Expert Opinion of [REDACTED] dated November 15, 2019 (**[REDACTED] Second Expert Opinion**\"), the Second Expert Opinion of [REDACTED] dated November 14, 2019, Exhibits R-0106 through R-0190, and Legal Authorities RL-0142 through RL-0198.\n\n56.\n\nOn November 25, 2019, the Tribunal invited the Parties to (i) designate the witnesses and experts they would like to cross-examine during the upcoming hearing; (ii) confirm their availability for a pre-hearing organizational meeting on December 11, 2019; and (iii) present a chronology and a list and a brief description of the individuals and entities who/which are part of the relevant factual background by December 9, 2019. The Tribunal also invited the Parties to work on a list of substantive issues and update the Tribunal on their progress at the pre-hearing conference.\n\n57.\n\nOn November 26, 2019, following exchanges with the Parties, the Centre confirmed that the pre-hearing organizational meeting would take place on December 11, 2019.\n\n58.\n\nOn December 2, 2019, the Parties submitted their respective lists of witnesses and experts that they wished to cross-examine at the hearing.\n\n59.\n\nOn December 5, 2019, the Secretary of the Tribunal circulated a draft agenda for the pre-hearing organizational meeting.\n\n60.\n\nOn December 9, 2019, the Parties responded to the Tribunal\u2019s letter of November 25, 2019.\n\n61.\n\nOn December 10, 2019, the Claimants submitted a draft pre-hearing conference agenda recording the Parties\u2019 agreements regarding the schedule and the organization of the hearing and their disagreement as to whether Mr. Khudyan\u2019s family should be permitted to attend part of the hearing.\n\n62.\n\nOn December 11, 2019, the Tribunal held a pre-hearing organizational meeting with the Parties by telephone conference.\n\n63.\n\nOn December 12, 2019, the Tribunal, informed the Parties that \"[w]*hile* [it] *is not convinced that the presence of the children would be appropriate, it is sympathetic to the request for permission to allow Mrs. Khudyan to accompany her husband during the first two days of the hearing, subject to her signing a confidentiality undertaking. The Tribunal, however, is constrained by ICSID Arbitration Rule 32(2), which was not discussed during the Pre-Hearing Organizational Meeting.\"* The Tribunal invited the Parties to consider Arbitration Rule 32(2) and revert on this issue by December 20, 2019.\n\n64.\n\nOn December 13, 2019, the Claimants submitted new Exhibits C-0344 through C-0346 for use by the Claimants at the hearing and reserved their right to file an additional exhibit (Exhibit C-0347) by December 20, 2019.\n\n65.\n\nOn December 19, 2019, the Claimants submitted the Judgement of the Court of General Jurisdiction of the Kentron and Nork-Marash Administrative Districts of the City of Yerevan dated July 29, 2019, along with a partial translation of that judgement, as Exhibit C-0347-ARM.\n\n66.\n\nOn December 20, 2019, the Respondent objected to the attendance of Mr. Khudyan\u2019s family at the hearing and the Claimants indicated that Mr. Khudyan \"[would] *not press the matter*.\"\n\n67.\n\nOn the same date, the Claimants submitted a copy of their chronology of relevant facts.

FACTUAL BACKGROUND**\n---------------------------\n\n75.\n\nThe factual matrix of this dispute is broad and disputed to a large extent. This **Section III** is intended to provide a succinct overview of the Claimants' main factual allegations from which the dispute between the Parties arises. The Tribunal makes no ruling on these allegations in this section. The Tribunal will address in **Sections V.A** and **V.B** below the disputed elements of the Claimants' factual allegations relating to jurisdiction in the context of its analysis of the question whether the Tribunal has jurisdiction *ratione personae* over the Claimants and jurisdiction *ratione materiae* over their alleged investments. Because, as explained below, the Tribunal considers that it lacks jurisdiction over the dispute, it does not need to address the remaining disputed factual allegations.\n\n**A. [REDACTED]**\n\n**B.

The Respondent\u2019s Position***\n----------------------------------\n\n*(i) Claimant 1 - Mr. Edmond Khudyan*\n-------------------------------------\n\n154.\n\nIt is Armenia\u2019s case that the Tribunal has no jurisdiction over the first Claimant, Mr. Khudyan, because he does not qualify as a foreign investor under the ICSID Convention and the BIT. Armenia argues that the object and purpose of foreign investment protection prevents the Tribunal from exercising jurisdiction over Mr. Khudyan under the BIT and the ICSID Convention because Mr. Khudyan is an Armenian national and his claims amount to an abuse of rights and process.111\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial, Section VI.\n\n155.\n\nArmenia submits that the ICSID Convention prohibits individuals from bringing investment claims within the ICSID framework against the State of which they are a national, and accordingly an ICSID tribunal cannot exercise jurisdiction over a claimant bringing a claim against a State of which it holds nationality.112 Armenia reads a similar intention in the distinction the BIT makes between \"*a Party*\" and \"*the other Party*,\" which according to Armenia makes clear that it was not intended that \"*a Party*\" would be subject to claims of nationals of \"*the same Party.*\"113\n\nRespondent\u2019s Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6476-477.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6473-475.\n\n156.\n\nBased on investment case law and the definition of the term \"*national*\" in the BIT as *\"a natural person who is a national of the Party under its applicable law\"* Armenia states that for the purposes of international investment protection, Mr. Khudyan\u2019s nationality must be determined on the basis of the national law of Armenia.114\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6206-213.\n\n157.\n\nIt is the Respondent\u2019s case that as a matter of Armenian law, Mr. Khudyan is an Armenian national.\n\n158.\n\nThe key question is whether Mr. Khudyan lost his Armenian nationality at any point in view of the facts that:\n\na. [REDACTED]\n\n159.\n\nBy reference to the expert evidence of [REDACTED], the Respondent alleges that Mr. Khudyan did not lose his nationality of the ASSR after Armenia declared its independence from the USSR in 1991. Armenia\u2019s Declaration of Independence of 1991 proclaimed principles, which subsequently had to be implemented and elaborated in new legislation. As the Declaration of Independence was not meant to be a comprehensive legal regulation, it did not have the legal effect of rendering all former ASSR citizens stateless.118\n\nRespondent\u2019s PHB, \u00b66; [REDACTED]s First Expert Opinion, Section B(i); Tr., Day 4, 978:25-979:-17.\n\n160.\n\nThe Respondent argues that the USSR Constitution and the USSR legal framework remained in force in Armenia after the dissolution of the USSR and continued to govern the nationality of the citizens of the former ASSR until the entry into force of the new Armenian Constitution and the new Armenian Law on Citizenship in 1995 (\"**1995 Citizenship Law**\"). In the meantime, the Respondent argues, Mr. Khudyan\u2019s USSR passport remained valid.119\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial, \u00b6220.\n\n161.\n\nThe Respondent submits that in the context of the dissolution of the USSR and the State succession of the Republic of Armenia to the ASSR, Mr. Khudyan automatically became a national of the Republic of Armenia.120\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6220-223; [REDACTED] First Expert Opinion, \u00b6\u00b631-34; Respondent\u2019s PHB, \u00b69.\n\n162.\n\nIn response to the Claimants\u2019 argument [REDACTED] the Respondent insists that the consular registration requirement was contrary to the provisions of the 1961 UN Convention on the Reduction of Statelessness and therefore did not generate legal effect. Article 10(3) of the 1995 Citizenship Law had the potential of rendering citizens stateless for failing to register, which is expressly prohibited by Articles 7(3) and 8 of the 1961 UN Convention.121 Because the Armenian Constitution expressly provides for the primacy of international law over national legislation, the provisions of the 1995 Citizenship Law should be applied in a manner that avoids any conflict with Armenia\u2019s international treaty obligations.122 The Respondent emphasizes that Armenia removed the consular registration requirement from the 1995 Citizenship Law in 2001 because of its inconsistency with the 1961 UN Convention.123\n\nRespondent\u2019s Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6487-488; Respondent\u2019s PHB, \u00b6\u00b66, 16-17; [REDACTED] Second Expert Opinion, \u00b611; United Nations, Convention on the Reduction of Statelessness, 1961 (Legal Authority RL-0157), Articles 1(3)-(4), 7, 8.\n\n[REDACTED] Second Expert Opinion, \u00b6\u00b67-12; Respondent\u2019s Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6487-488; Respondent\u2019s PHB, \u00b618.\n\nTr., Day 4, 1014:2-6; Respondent\u2019s PHB, \u00b619.\n\n163.\n\n[REDACTED] In any event, had Mr. Khudyan taken any initiative to that end, it would not have led to the termination of his Armenian citizenship as a matter of Armenian law124 since Article 1 of the 1995 Citizenship Law provides that \"[r]*enouncing one\u2019s citizenship of the Republic of Armenia itself does not cause losing the citizenship of the Republic of Armenia.*\"125\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6230-231; [REDACTED] First Expert Opinion, \u00b6\u00b644-45.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6490-491; Law of the Republic of Armenia on Citizenship, October 23, 1995 (\"**1995 Citizenship Law**\") (Exhibits C-0167, C-0168 / R-0046), Article 1.\n\n164.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, [REDACTED] obtaining another nationality does not automatically result in the loss of the Armenian nationality.126 Pursuant to Article 25 of the 1995 Citizenship Law, an Armenian citizen \"*may*\" be deprived of his Armenian citizenship if he acquired the citizenship of another country,127 but such deprivation requires affirmative action of the Republic of Armenia through a specific procedure.128 The Respondent alleges that the Armenian authorities never undertook any action aimed at depriving Mr. Khudyan of his Armenian nationality. By reference to [REDACTED] expert evidence concerning the State practice following the Declaration of Independence, the Respondent submits that persons with a USSR passport issued in the ASSR were admitted into the Republic of Armenia without any conditions, including after the expiry of their USSR passports, and were entitled to a passport of the Republic of Armenia.129\n\nRespondent\u2019s Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6492-494.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Rejoinder, \u00b6493; 1995 Citizenship Law (Exhibits C-0167, C-0168 / R-0046), Article 25.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6493-494; Respondent\u2019s PHB, \u00b66; [REDACTED] First Expert Opinion, \u00b6\u00b643-46; Tr., Day 1, 168:8-20; Tr., Day 4, 1010:4-17.\n\nRespondent\u2019s PHB, \u00b6\u00b69-11; Tr., Day 4, 998:4-999-6.\n\n165.\n\n[REDACTED] The Respondent alleges, [REDACTED] that no weight should be given to the special residency passport of Mr. Khudyan for two reasons:\n\na. [REDACTED]\n\n166.\n\nFurthermore, the Respondent claims that even if Mr. Khudyan had lost his Armenian nationality upon the dissolution of the USSR, as the Claimants contend, he re-acquired it when he obtained special residency status [REDACTED]. It is the Respondent\u2019s submission that special residency status is equivalent to the broader notion of *\"nationality\"* of the BIT. In that respect, the Respondent refers to criteria established in the *Nottebohm* case, according to which the concept of nationality is defined by (1) the bonds of kinship between the national and the nation, and (2) the reciprocal rights and duties between national and the nation.132 The Respondent argues that a third criterion must be added, namely that the national enjoy a right to remain undisturbedly on the territory of the nation.133\n\nRespondent\u2019s Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6503-504, citing *Nottebohm Case (Lichtenstein v. Guatemala),* International Court of Justice, Second Phase: Judgment, April 6, 1955 *(\"**Nottebohm**\")* (Legal Authority RL-0159), p. 23.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Rejoinder, \u00b6504.\n\n167.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, Mr. Khudyan\u2019s special residency status meets all of these criteria. First, the special residency status is premised upon Armenian national origin, which forms the bond of kinship that is at the root of the concept of nationality.134 Second, Mr. Khudyan\u2019s special residency status creates reciprocal rights in the sense of the *Nottebohm* test, notably by conferring upon him all rights and obligations of Armenian citizens, except for political rights.135 Third, the special residency status granted to Mr. Khudyan allows him free access to and undisturbed presence on the territory of the Republic of Armenia.136\n\nRespondent\u2019s Rejoinder, \u00b6505.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Rejoinder, \u00b6506.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Rejoinder, \u00b6507.\n\n168.\n\nOn that basis, the Respondent concludes that Mr. Khudyan had Armenian nationality on the day of the filing of the Request for Arbitration on September 18, 2017 and on the day of its registration on September 27, 2017.137 As Article 25(2)(a) of the ICSID Convention excludes dual nationals from ICSID jurisdiction, which is not only confirmed by the text of Article 25(2)(a) itself, but also by the Report of the Executive Directors on the Convention, and case law,138 the Respondent submits that the Tribunal has no jurisdiction over Claimant 1, Mr. Khudyan.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6241-244.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6245-255, citing, *inter alia,* International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, Report of the Executive Directors on the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States, March 18, 1965 (Legal Authority RL-0026), \u00b6\u00b69, 28; *Tokios Tokel\u00e9s v. Ukraine,* ICSID Case No. ARB/02/18, Dissenting Opinion of Prof. Prosper Weil, April 29, 2004 (\"**Weil Opinion**\") (Legal Authority RL-0060), \u00b65.\n\n169.\n\nMoreover, the Respondent posits that Mr. Khudyan\u2019s dual nationality at the time the purported investments were made also constitutes a bar to ICSID jurisdiction. [REDACTED]140\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6262-263.\n\n170.\n\nIn this framework, the Respondent relies on the decision of the tribunal in *Champion Trading v. Egypt,* declining jurisdiction over two claimants who in addition to their US nationality also held Egyptian nationality, and who had relied on their Egyptian nationality when making their investment.141 The Respondent further points to the dissenting opinion of Prof. Francisco Orrego Vicu\u00f1a in *Siag v. Egypt,* where the tribunal exercised jurisdiction over Mr. Waguih Siag. Mr. Siag was an Egyptian national by birth, who did not express, as was required by Egyptian law, his intention to preserve his Egyptian nationality when he became Lebanese and, later, when he became an Italian national. The majority of the tribunal held that the \"negative\" nationality test was satisfied and that Mr. Siag was not an Egyptian national when he initiated ICSID arbitration against Egypt.142 However, Prof. Orrego Vicu\u00f1a dissented on this point, emphasizing the overarching concern of States that ratified the ICSID Convention not to be taken to international arbitration by their own nationals.143 According to Prof. Orrego Vicu\u00f1a, it was wrong to exercise ICSID jurisdiction over Mr. Siag, because he was Egyptian at the time when the investment was made and he benefited from rights that as a matter of Egyptian law are exclusively available to Egyptian citizens. Given that Mr. Siag was treated at all times as an Egyptian national, it appeared to Prof. Orrego Vicu\u00f1a to be inconsistent with the exercise of ICSID jurisdiction over him as a foreign investor within the meaning of the ICSID Convention.144 According to Prof. Orrego Vicu\u00f1a, one has to consider an investor's nationality not only on the date of initiation of ICSID arbitration, as required by the ICSID Convention, but also on the date when the purported investment was made.145\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6270-273, citing *Champion Trading Company and others v. Arab Republic of Egypt,* ICSID Case No. ARB/02/9, Decision on Jurisdiction, October 21, 2003 *(**Champion Trading v. Egypt**\")* (Legal Authority RL-0072).\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6275-277, citing *Waguih Elie George Siag and Clorinda Vecchi v. Arab Republic of Egypt,* ICSID Case No. ARB/05/15, Decision on Jurisdiction and Partial Dissenting Opinion of Prof. Francisco Orrego Vicu\u00f1a, April 11, 2007 *(**Siag v. Egypt**\")* (Legal Authorities CL-0142 / RL-0066).\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial, \u00b6278, citing *Siag v. Egypt* (Legal Authorities CL-0142 / RL-0066), pp. 63-65.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6279-283, citing *Siag v. Egypt* (Legal Authorities CL-0142 / RL-0066), pp. 63-65.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial, \u00b6284, citing *Siag v. Egypt* (Legal Authorities CL-0142 / RL-0066), pp. 63-65.\n\n171.\n\nAccordingly, the Respondent argues that the ICSID Convention does not extend protection to purported investors like Mr. Khudyan, who, in order to make the alleged investments, exercised rights that are under Armenian law exclusively available to Armenian nationals. Mr. Khudyan's invocation of the investment protection that the ICSID Convention reserves for foreign investors, is, according to the Respondent, contrary to the Convention's object and purpose.146\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6285-291.\n\n172.\n\nAlternatively, the Respondent argues that even if the Tribunal were to find that Mr. Khudyan does not hold Armenian nationality in the strict meaning of the term, policy considerations militate against the treatment of Mr. Khudyan as a foreign investor under international law because Mr. Khudyan's behaviour demonstrates that while making the alleged investments, he considered himself an Armenian national and relied only on his Armenian nationality.147 In particular, the right to acquire and own real estate in Armenia is limited to Armenian nationals and those treated on an equal footing, such as foreigners with special residency status and, therefore, Mr. Khudyan could not have made his purported investment as a US national.148\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6294-295.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial, \u00b6296.\n\n173.\n\nThe Respondent insists that Mr. Khudyan was perfectly aware of that limitation, which is the very reason why he initially chose to acquire the [REDACTED] Property in the name of his friend [REDACTED].149 Moreover, the Respondent argues that Mr. Khudyan solely used his Armenian passport to enter and exit Armenia in the relevant period,150 a large number of documents related to his purported investments only include Mr. Khudyan\u2019s Armenian passport information, as well as his address in Armenia (including the documents related to the creation and incorporation of Arin Armenia (fully named Arin Capital Investments LLC), the sale and purchase agreements of land plots, as well as many of the preliminary sale-purchase agreements for apartments concluded by Mr. Khudyan with the buyers).151\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial, \u00b6297.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6262, 300.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6301-310.\n\n174.\n\nIn addition, the Respondent contends that Mr. Khudyan\u2019s alleged investments lack international character and that, for all intents and purposes, Mr. Khudyan was an Armenian national when he made his purported investments,152 relying on the right under domestic laws to purchase real estate, reserved for Armenian nationals.153 Where according to domestic law investments can only be made by the host State\u2019s own nationals, such investments lack international character and thus cannot benefit from investment protection under international law.154\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6311-317.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial, \u00b6318.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial, \u00b6319.\n\n175.\n\nLastly, the Respondent submits that exercising jurisdiction in the particular circumstances of this case would set a dangerous precedent, loosening the nationality requirements of the ICSID Convention.155 The Respondent submits that Mr. Khudyan engaged in an abuse of rights and process by using a status akin to Armenian nationality in making his purported investment.156 According to the Respondent, even if Mr. Khudyan were technically to be considered a foreigner, he was \"*masquerading as a local Armenian to gain access to rights and opportunities otherwise reserved for Armenian nationals.*\"157 The Respondent argues that Mr. Khudyan *de facto* engaged in nationality shopping, using a status akin to Armenian nationality to invest as an Armenian national only subsequently to invoke his US nationality to claim investment protection in respect of the same alleged investments under the Armenia-US BIT.158 Consequently, if the Tribunal were to find that Mr. Khudyan\u2019s status under Armenian law does not amount to nationality, the Respondent submits that the reasoning of the *Champion Trading v. Egypt* tribunal and of Prof. Orrego Vicu\u00f1a in his dissenting opinion in the *Siag v. Egypt* case should also find application in the present case.159\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6327-328.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6320-323, citing *Siag v. Egypt* (Legal Authorities CL-0142 / RL-0066), p. 63.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial, \u00b6324.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial, \u00b6326.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6329-331.\n\n*(ii) Claimant 2 - Arin Capital & Investment Corp.*\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n176.\n\nIn relation to Claimant 2, Arin US, the Respondent advances two jurisdictional objections.\n\n177.\n\nFirst, because Mr. Khudyan is an Armenian national and owns 100% of the share capital of the second Claimant, Arin US, the Respondent submits that the second Claimant is a shell company that is controlled entirely by an Armenian national. Therefore, according to the Respondent, the second Claimant does not qualify either as a foreign entity under Article 25(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention and thus does not satisfy the Convention\u2019s *ratione personae* requirements.160\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6191-196.\n\n178.\n\nSecond, the Respondent submits that the Tribunal also lacks jurisdiction over Arin US because it would have committed an abuse of right by failing to claim for a distinct harm.\n\n179.\n\nRelying on the *Orascom v. Algeria* award, the Respondent submits that it \"*has not consented to being sued by other entities that are controlled by Claimant 1, in relation to the same alleged investment, the same alleged measures and the same alleged harm\"* and asserts that Arin US, which is controlled by Mr. Khudyan, *\"cannot seek protection for the same harm inflicted on Claimant 1\u2019s alleged investment.*\"161\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6198-201, citing *Orascom TMT Investments S.\u00e0 r.l. v. People's Democratic Republic of Algeria,* ICSID Case No. ARB/12/35, Final Award, May 31, 2017 *(**Orascom v. Algeria**)* (Legal Authority RL-0061), \u00b6\u00b6542-543.\n\n180.\n\nIt is the Respondent's case that Arin US's conduct constitutes an abuse of the system of investment protection, which would constitute a further ground for the inadmissibility of Arin US's claims and would preclude the Tribunal from exercising jurisdiction over this dispute.162\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial, \u00b6202.\n\n***b. The Claimants\u2019 Position***\n--------------------------------\n\n*(i) Claimant 1 - Mr. Edmond Khudyan*\n-------------------------------------\n\n181.\n\nThe Claimants characterize the Respondent's jurisdictional objection *ratione personae* with respect to Mr. Khudyan as *\"frivolous*163 on grounds that he is not a citizen of the Republic of Armenia under the applicable law.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Reply, Section I(A).\n\n182.\n\nIt is the Claimants' case that the Respondent's interpretation of the 1995 Citizenship Law is untenable because that Law provides that the former citizens of the ASSR did not automatically become Armenian citizens when the Republic of Armenia succeeded the ASSR as a State. The Claimants argue that pursuant to Articles 9 and 10(3) of the 1995 Citizenship Law, citizens of the former ASSR who were living abroad when that Law entered into force (i.e., on November 28, 1995) had to satisfy two conditions to be recognized as Armenian citizens: (1) they could not have acquired citizenship of another State; and (2) they had to have filed for consular registration before the entry into force of the Law.164\n\nClaimants\u2019 Reply, \u00b6\u00b633-34.\n\n183.\n\nAs it is common ground that Mr. Khudyan left Armenia and moved his permanent residence to the USA [REDACTED] the two requirements of Article 10(3) would have to be met in order for him to be recognized as an Armenian citizen under the 1995 Citizenship Law:165\n\na. As to the first requirement, the Claimants recognize that when the 1995 Citizenship Law entered into force, Mr. Khudyan was yet to acquire his US citizenship, as a result of which he does satisfy the first requirement of Article 10(3) of the 1995 Citizenship Law;166 and\n\nb. As to the second requirement, the Claimants assert that it is not satisfied because [REDACTED] and because Armenia did not open its first consulate in the USA until 1995, the year when the 1995 Citizenship Law was adopted in Armenia.168\n\nClaimants\u2019 Reply, \u00b635.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Reply, \u00b636.\n\nWeb Page Portal, Embassy of Armenia to the United States of America, \"Bilateral Relations\" (Exhibit C-0140).\n\n184.\n\nThe Claimants dismiss the Respondent\u2019s reliance on the 1961 UN Convention on the Reduction of Statelessness as an attempt to circumvent its own statutory requirements for granting nationality.169 They argue under general principles of law that Mr. Khudyan cannot be deprived of the protection of the ICSID Convention and the BIT on grounds of the alleged incompatibility of Armenia\u2019s own laws with the 1961 UN Convention.170 Moreover, the Claimants submit that issues of nationality following State succession are not governed by the 1961 UN Convention but by the 1999 ILC Draft Articles on the Nationality of Natural Persons in relation to the Succession of States (\"**1999 ILC Draft Articles**\").171 Even if the 1961 UN Convention on the Reduction of Statelessness were to apply, the Claimants insist that it does not lead to the affirmative and automatic grant of Armenian nationality to Mr. Khudyan.172\n\nTr., Day 1, 144:19-24.\n\nTr., Day 1, 144:25-145:6.\n\nTr., Day 1, 145:7-145:19, referring to International Law Commission, Draft Articles on Nationality of Natural Persons in Relation to the Succession of States, 1999 (\"**1999 ILC Draft Articles**\") (Legal Authority CL-0107).\n\nTr., Day 1, 145:20-147:10.\n\n185.\n\nWhile the Claimants recognize that the consular registration requirement was removed from the 1995 Citizenship Law in 2001, the parliamentary debate surrounding this amendment confirms that the effect desired by the legislator when introducing the registration requirement had been to leave a large number of the former ASSR citizens stateless.173 This is exactly the case of Mr. Khudyan who, from the point of view of Armenian law, was thus stateless up until the moment he obtained US citizenship [REDACTED]174\n\nClaimants\u2019 Reply, \u00b639, citing Republic of Armenia, National Assembly, Minutes of Fifth Session of Second Convocation, March 19, 2001 (Exhibit C-0172).\n\nClaimants\u2019 Reply, \u00b640.\n\n186.\n\nIn addition, the Claimants reject the Respondent\u2019s submission to the effect that Mr. Khudyan would have preserved his Armenian citizenship because there is no record of Mr. Khudyan terminating his Armenian citizenship. It is the Claimants\u2019 case that Mr. Khudyan could not have terminated a citizenship that he never obtained in the first place.175\n\nClaimants\u2019 Reply, \u00b643.\n\n187.\n\nFurthermore, the Claimants submit that in [REDACTED] the Respondent itself recognized that Mr. Khudyan was not a citizen of the Republic of Armenia by granting him special residency status.176 They claim that it is not credible that the Armenian authorities would not have had sufficient records in [REDACTED] to verify whether or not Mr. Khudyan was an Armenian citizen.177\n\nClaimants\u2019 Reply, \u00b645.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Reply, \u00b6\u00b646-47.\n\n188.\n\nFinally, the Claimants submit that no policy considerations can override the clear wording of Article 25(2)(a) of the ICSID Convention and object against the recognition of Mr. Khudyan\u2019s alleged Armenian nationality on policy grounds for five reasons.\n\na. First, the Claimants deny that Mr. Khudyan would have held himself out as an Armenian national when he applied for special residency status and argue that Mr. Khudyan only referred to his Armenian \"nationality\" in the sense of national or ethnic origins, rather than in terms of legal citizenship status, which is only logical as according to Armenian law, the special residency status can only be granted to people of Armenian origin, holding citizenship of a different State.178\n\nb. Second, the Respondent's assertion that special residency status would be equivalent or akin to Armenian nationality is wrong, as it does not confer upon an individual the same rights and obligations that a national has (notably, the right to vote, run for office and enrol in political organizations), and, unlike nationality, expires after a ten-year period.179\n\nc. Third, the Claimants argue that the investor's nationality should not be assessed on the date of the first investment - as the Respondent submits - because this contradicts both the text of the ICSID Convention and its drafting history, where such requirement was neither specifically discussed nor agreed.180 Therefore, the Claimants argue that the Tribunal should not rely on the partial dissenting opinion in *Siag v. Egypt* but on the actual decision of the majority of the *Siag* tribunal, which applied the plain text of Article 25(2)(a) of the ICSID Convention to determine the investor's nationality and exercised jurisdiction.181\n\nd. Fourth, the Claimants allege that the fact that Mr. Khudyan would have used his Armenian address and special residency status in several transactions related to his investment is irrelevant, as it does not mean that Mr. Khudyan considered himself to be an Armenian national.182 Moreover, just as many documents identify Mr. Khudyan as a US citizen.183\n\ne. Lastly, the Claimants object to the Respondent\u2019s qualification of Mr. Khudyan\u2019s claims in these proceedings as an abuse of process on grounds that the acquisition of real estate is a type of investment that could not be made by foreigners but only by Armenian nationals or those with a special residency status. The Claimants argue that by acquiring special residency status, Mr. Khudyan merely tried to ensure that his investment was made in full compliance with the requirements of Armenian law for ownership of real estate, which cannot be used against him in order to deny him investment protection on jurisdictional grounds.184\n\nClaimants\u2019 Reply, \u00b6\u00b649-50, citing Republic of Armenia, Law on the Status of Foreign Citizens, December 25, 2006 (**Law on Foreign Citizens**\") (Exhibit C-0023), Articles 2, 18; 1995 Citizenship Law (Exhibits C-0167, C-0168 / R-0046), Articles 1, 3.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Reply, \u00b6\u00b652-53.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Reply, \u00b654.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Reply, \u00b655, citing, *inter alia,* *Siag*\u00a0*v.

If the nationality of a person is challenged in international arbitration proceedings, the tribunal is competent to pass upon that challenge. In so doing, the tribunal must accord great weight to the nationality law of the State in question and to the interpretation and application of that law by its authorities. On the basis of the facts and applicable law before it, the tribunal must establish whether the claimant whose nationality is at issue was a national of the relevant State at the relevant time(s). In addition, for the purposes of the ICSID Convention, the tribunal must also establish whether a natural person was also a national of the respondent State at those time(s), and determine what legal consequences follow from that finding. Where, as in the instant case, the jurisdiction of an international tribunal turns on an issue of nationality, the international tribunal is empowered, indeed bound, to decide that issue.189\n\n*Ibid*.\n\n***a. Jurisdiction*** **ratione personae** ***under the BIT***\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n196.\n\nArticles I and VI of the BIT define an *\"investment dispute\"* as *\"a dispute between a Party and a national or company of the other Party.\"* They further define a *\"national\"* of a Party as *\"a natural person who is a national of a Party under its applicable law\"* without further limitation and a \"*company*\" of a Party as \"*any kind of corporation, company, association, partnership, or other organization, legally constituted under the laws and regulations of a Party\"* without further limitation.190\n\nTreaty between the United States of America and the Republic of Armenia Concerning the Reciprocal Encouragement and Protection of Investment, signed September 23, 1992 and entered into force March 29, 1996 (**BIT**\") (Legal Authorities CL-0081 / RL-0037), Articles I, VI.\n\n197.\n\nThe Respondent asserts that the BIT contrasts \"*a Party\"* with *\"the other Party\"* to make clear *\"that it is not intended that 'a Party\u2019 would not be subject to claims by nationals of 'the same Party'* and argues on this basis that dual nationals, holding the nationality of both the host State and home State may not claim under the BIT in their personal capacity.191\n\nRespondent\u2019s Rejoinder, \u00b6474.\n\n198.\n\nThe Tribunal observes that the Respondent has not supported its submission in this respect with any legal authority. The Tribunal also observes that the BIT does not explicitly exclude individuals who hold the nationality of both contracting State Parties to the BIT from bringing claims against a host State under the BIT.\n\n199.\n\nAbsent such express language in the BIT, the Tribunal finds that it cannot alter the treaty carefully negotiated between the USA and Armenia by reading into it the additional requirement that a US national seeking to invoke the protection of the BIT may not also hold the nationality of Armenia, and *vice versa.* Instead, it is sufficient for the purposes of the present BIT that the Claimants demonstrate that they have the nationality of their home or \"other\" State Party to the BIT, i.e., the USA.\n\n200.\n\nIt is undisputed that at the time this arbitration was initiated, Mr. Khudyan was a citizen of the USA and Arin US was a company incorporated under the laws of the State of California (USA).192 The Tribunal is further satisfied that the Claimants were US nationals at the time of the alleged breaches of the BIT. The Tribunal is thus satisfied that both Claimants are US nationals for the purposes of the BIT.\n\nPassport of Mr. Edmond Khudyan (Exhibit C-0128); Articles of Incorporation of Arin Capital & Investment Corp, March 29, 2002 (Exhibit C-0014); State of California Web Portal, Business Entities, \"Arin Capital & Investment Corp.\" (Exhibit C-0130).\n\n***b. Jurisdiction*** **ratione personae** ***under the ICSID Convention***\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n201.\n\nIn order to invoke the jurisdiction of an ICSID tribunal, an investor also has to fall within the scope of the definition of a *\"national\"* set forth in Article 25(2)(a) and (b) of the ICSID Convention, which provides as follows:\n\n*(a) any natural person who had the nationality of a Contracting State other than the State party to the dispute on the date on which the parties consented to submit such dispute to conciliation or arbitration as well as on the date on which the request was registered ..., but does not include any person who on either date also had the nationality of the Contracting State party to the dispute; and*\n\n*(b) any juridical person which had the nationality of a Contracting State other than the State party to the dispute on the date on which the parties consented to submit such dispute to conciliation or arbitration and any juridical person which had the nationality of the Contracting State party to the dispute on that date and which, because of foreign control, the parties have agreed should be treated as a national of another Contracting State for the purposes of this Convention.*\n\n202.\n\nThe Tribunal will proceed to determine whether each of the Claimants in the present arbitration satisfy the requirements of Article 25(2) of the ICSID Convention.\n\n*(i) Claimant 1 - Mr. Edmond Khudyan*\n-------------------------------------\n\n203.\n\nThe ICSID Convention expressly excludes jurisdiction over natural persons having the nationality of the respondent State, thereby barring dual nationals from access to ICSID arbitration.\n\n204.\n\nIn view of the objection against the Tribunal's jurisdiction raised by the Respondent, the Tribunal must determine whether Mr. Khudyan also held Armenian nationality on the date of the submission of the Request for Arbitration to the ICSID Secretariat and on the date of its registration by the ICSID Secretariat.\n\n205.\n\nAs the starting point for its analysis, the Tribunal takes the common ground between the Parties that prior to Mr. Khudyan's departure from Armenia to the USA [REDACTED] and at least until the Declaration of Independence by the Supreme Council of the ASSR on August 23, 1990, Mr. Khudyan was a citizen of the USSR as well as of the ASSR. He held a passport of the USSR, which he used when emigrating to the USA.193\n\nExit Visa of Mr. Edmond Khudyan (Exhibit C-0165).\n\n206.\n\nIt is also common ground that the question whether Mr. Khudyan is an Armenian citizen must be assessed on the basis of Armenian law.194\n\nClaimants\u2019 Reply, \u00b6\u00b632-42; Respondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6205-244; Respondent\u2019s Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6478-495.\n\n207.\n\nThere are four issues to be decided by the Tribunal in this respect: (1) whether Mr. Khudyan lost his USSR/ASSR citizenship after the proclamation of independence by the Supreme Council of the ASSR in 1990; (2) whether Mr. Khudyan lost his Armenian citizenship after the 1995 Citizenship Law entered into force; (3) whether Mr. Khudyan lost his Armenian citizenship when he acquired US nationality [REDACTED]; and (4) whether the issuance of a passport with special residency status [REDACTED] affects Mr. Khudyan's nationality status in any manner. These issues are discussed below.\n\n1) Did Mr. Khudyan lose his USSR/ASSR citizenship upon the Declaration of Independence by the Supreme Council of the ASSR?\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n208.\n\nThe Tribunal will first address the question whether Mr. Khudyan lost his USSR/ASSR citizenship when the ASSR proclaimed its independence in 1990.\n\n209.\n\nThe Tribunal is not convinced that Mr. Khudyan lost his USSR/ASSR citizenship when the ASSR declared its independence from the USSR and changed its name to the Republic of Armenia. In the absence of any evidence that the Respondent intended to deprive its citizens living abroad of their nationality, it is inconceivable that by proclaiming its independence from the USSR on August 23, 1990, the ASSR sought to render stateless the numerous USSR/ASSR citizens living abroad (like Mr. Khudyan).\n\n210.\n\nThe Tribunal does not accept that the Declaration of Independence had the effect of depriving USSR/ASSR citizens living abroad of their nationality for the following three reasons.\n\n211.\n\nFirst, the Declaration of Independence of August 23, 1990 served to record the will of the Armenian people, expressed by the Supreme Council of the ASSR, to exercise its right of self-determination and marked \"[t]*he beginning of the process of establishing of independent statehood positioning the question of the creation of a democratic society based on the rule of law.*195 The Declaration of Independence was followed by a referendum on September 21, 1991, during which 99.5% of the voters voted for Armenia to secede from the USSR.\n\nDeclaration of Independence (Exhibits C-0346 / R-0043).\n\n212.\n\nThe Declaration of Independence was not a constitutive act, establishing a detailed legal regime, but a declaration of principles.196 Indeed, the Declaration of Independence had to be later ratified by the Armenian people in the above-referenced referendum. One of the principles articulated in the Declaration of Independence concerns the basis upon which the Republic of Armenia would administer citizenship: the citizens living in the territory of Armenia were to be granted citizenship of the Republic of Armenia, while the Armenians living abroad were to be granted the right to citizenship of the Republic of Armenia, as discussed further below.\n\nDeclaration of Independence (Exhibits C-0346 / R-0043); Tr., Day 4, 986:3-987:5.\n\n213.\n\nAs the Declaration of Independence was not designed to provide a comprehensive set of rules regulating citizenship,197 it is clear to the Tribunal that it neither conferred citizenship upon individuals, nor deprived individuals of their citizenship.\n\nTr., Day 4, 986:3-10.\n\n214.\n\nSecond, the Tribunal recognizes that Article 4 of the Declaration of Independence appears to distinguish between:\n\n- Armenians residing within the Armenian territory, who are automatically recognized as citizens of the Republic of Armenia; and\n\n- the so-called \"*Armenians of abroad*198 (or in another translation the \"*Armenians of the Diaspora*199*)* who *\"have the right of citizenship of Armenia*.\"200\n\nTr., Day 4, pp. 985:10-986:4; Declaration of Independence (Exhibits C-0346 / R-0043), Article 4.\n\nTr., Day 4, 980-985; Declaration of Independence (Exhibits C-0346 / R-0043), Article 4.\n\nDeclaration of Independence (Exhibits C-0346 / R-0043), Article 4.\n\n215.\n\nHowever, the Tribunal also notes that the text of Article 4 of the Declaration of Independence201 does not clearly provide whether the category of \"*Armenians from abroad*\" comprises only citizens of the former ASSR residing abroad, or whether it encompasses a broader group of people of Armenian origin who may have acquired the citizenship of another State (as attested by the Respondent\u2019s expert [REDACTED]202).\n\nDeclaration of Independence (Exhibits C-0346 / R-0043), Article 4 reads *All citizens living on the territory of Armenia are granted citizenship of the Republic of Armenia. Armenians of the Diaspora have the right of citizenship of Armenia. The citizens of the Republic of Armenia are protected and aided by the Republic. The Republic of Armenia guarantees the free and equal development of its citizens regardless of national origin, race, or creed.\"*\n\nTr., Day 4, 981:12-989:23. *See also* Tr., Day 4, 993:3-994:12; Tr., Day 4, 1005:12-1008:4.\n\n216.\n\nIn any event, the Tribunal notes that the Declaration of Independence does not contain any indication that the newly named Republic of Armenia intended to deprive citizens of the ASSR of their citizenship. On the contrary, the Declaration of Independence confirms that the Republic of Armenia intended to extend citizenship to citizens of the former ASSR living in its territory, as well as to those living abroad.\n\n217.\n\nThird, as credibly attested by the former Head of Foreign Citizen Registration and Visas Department, [REDACTED] - whose evidence stands unrebutted - the Soviet legislative acts (including the laws on nationality) remained in force in Armenia from the date of the promulgation of the Declaration of Independence until the adoption of replacement legislation (with respect to citizenship, a law on citizenship) by the Republic of Armenia by virtue of the Constitutional Law *\"On the legislative acts adopted in accordance with Armenia\u2019s 'Declaration of Independence\u2019*.\"203\n\n[REDACTED] First Expert Opinion, \u00b6\u00b635-40.\n\n218.\n\nAccordingly, following the Declaration of Independence on August 23, 1990, until the adoption of the 1995 Citizenship Law, Mr. Khudyan's Armenian nationality was governed by the 1978 USSR Citizenship Law.204\n\nUnion of Soviet Socialist Republics, Citizenship Law, 1978 (\"**USSR Citizenship Law**\") (Exhibit R-0005).\n\n219.\n\nUpon the dissolution of the USSR in December 1991, every citizen of the former USSR had the right to choose his or her citizenship pursuant to Article 15 of the Soviet Law on the Procedure of Exiting the USSR.205 Failing the exercise of that right, it was State practice that a citizen of a seceding republic was automatically considered a citizen of the seceding republic.206 Therefore, absent any affirmative action taken by a person to become a citizen of another seceding republic, the former citizens of the ASSR were deemed citizens of the Republic of Armenia without any special procedure or decision.207\n\nTr., Day 4, 964:2-15.\n\nTr., Day 4, 987:11-988:18.\n\nTr., Day 4, 989:8-13.\n\n220.\n\nIn addition, [REDACTED] credibly attested that in the 1990s, ASSR citizens with a passport of the USSR - even if it had expired (as would have been the case for Mr. Khudyan) - were admitted to the Republic of Armenia on a *laissez passer* basis and were issued a passport of the Republic of Armenia without the need to go through any recognition procedure.208\n\nTr., Day 4, 998:4-1001:16.\n\n221.\n\nWhile the 1978 USSR Citizenship Law still applied in Armenia, there was no rule in force pursuant to which a person residing outside the USSR or Armenia would be deprived of citizenship, nor were there any procedures in place for the termination of citizenship.209 In this framework, it is important to note that the 1978 USSR Citizenship Law did not provide for the possibility of citizens of the USSR (and by extension, the ASSR) losing their citizenship without any affirmative action on the part of the citizen and the State. Pursuant to Article 16 of the law, citizenship could only be lost in case of:\n\n(1) renunciation;\n\n(2) deprivation;\n\n(3) grounds provided for by the international treaties to which the USSR was a party; and\n\n(4) other grounds provided for by the 1978 USSR Citizenship Law.\n\nUSSR Citizenship Law (Exhibit R-0005), Article 5; Tr., Day 4, 964:16-965:17.\n\n222.\n\nIt has neither been argued, nor proven, that Mr. Khudyan lost his USSR/ASSR citizenship due to the reasons listed above at (1), (3) and (4). There also is no indication that Mr. Khudyan would have lost his USSR/ASSR citizenship through deprivation of citizenship in the sense of the 1978 USSR Citizenship Law.210\n\nClaimants\u2019 Reply, \u00b6\u00b632-42.\n\n223.\n\nAccordingly, the Tribunal finds that the mere fact that Mr. Khudyan resided abroad could not have caused the loss of his USSR/ASSR citizenship while the 1978 USSR Citizenship Law applied in Armenia.211\n\n[REDACTED] First Expert Opinion, \u00b6\u00b616-21.\n\n224.\n\nOn the basis of the foregoing, the Tribunal concludes that Mr. Khudyan did not lose his USSR/ASSR citizenship when, on August 23, 1990, the ASSR proclaimed its independence from the USSR and changed its name to the Republic of Armenia.\n\n2) Did Mr. Khudyan lose his nationality upon the entry into force of the 1995 Citizenship Law for failure to register under Article 10(3)?\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n225.\n\nThe second question concerning Mr. Khudyan\u2019s nationality status is whether he lost his Armenian citizenship as a consequence of his failure to register with an Armenian consulate prior to the entry into force of the 1995 Citizenship Law.\n\n226.\n\nArticle 10(3) of the 1995 Citizenship Law provides as follows:\n\n*The following persons shall be recognized as citizens of the Republic of Armenia:*\n\n*(3) the citizens of the former Armenian SSR, who are Armenians by national origin and reside outside the Republic of Armenia after 21 September 1991 and who have not acquired the citizenship of another State, as well as the citizens of the former Armenian SSR, who are Armenians by national origin and have resided outside Armenia before and have not acquired the citizenship of another State and have placed on consular record-registration before the entry into force of this Law.*212 [emphasis added]\n\n1995 Citizenship Law (Exhibits C-0167, C-0168 / R-0046), Article 10(3).\n\n227.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that Article 10(3) of the 1995 Citizenship Law has two prongs, each identifying one category of citizens of the former ASSR:\n\n- those residing outside the Republic of Armenia after September 21, 1991; and\n\n- those residing outside the Republic of Armenia before September 21, 1991.\n\n228.\n\nWhile the Claimants submit that Mr. Khudyan falls in the second category only,213 the Respondent argues that Mr. Khudyan falls in both categories and is thus recognized in any event as an Armenian citizen as part of the first category, for which no registration was ever required.214\n\nClaimants\u2019 Reply, \u00b6\u00b633-36.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6480-482.\n\n229.\n\nThe Tribunal recognizes that the wording of Article 10(3) lacks clarity in two important respects:\n\n- in the first category, the use of the wording *\"reside outside Armenia after 21 September 1991\"* does not exclude persons who started residing outside Armenia prior to that date; and\n\n- in the second category, the use of the wording \"*have resided outside Armenia before* [September 21, 1991]\" can be read as requiring that a person's residence abroad had ended prior to September 21, 1991.\n\n230.\n\nIrrespective of whether Mr. Khudyan falls in one or both of the categories as defined by Article 10(3), the Tribunal considers that the outcome is ultimately the same.\n\n231.\n\nShould Mr. Khudyan fall into the first category, he would be recognized as an Armenian citizen upon the entry into force of the 1995 Citizenship Law on November 28, 1995 because Mr. Khudyan:\n\n- was a citizen of the former ASSR;215\n\n- was an Armenian by national origin;216\n\n- had not acquired the citizenship of another State;217 and\n\n- resided outside Armenia after September 21, 1991 (having established his principal residence in the USA [REDACTED] and having maintained that residence ever since).218\n\nExit Visa of Mr. Edmond Khudyan (Exhibit C-0165); Application for Naturalization of Mr. Edmond Khudyan (Exhibit R-0191).\n\nApplication for Naturalization of Mr. Edmond Khudyan (Exhibit R-0191); Application of Mr. Edmond Khudyan for Special Residency Status, [REDACTED] (Exhibit R-0007).\n\nCertificate of Naturalization of Mr. Edmond Khudyan, [REDACTED] (Exhibit C-0171).\n\n[REDACTED] First Witness Statement, \u00b63; Exit Visa of Mr. Edmond Khudyan (Exhibit C-0165).\n\n232.\n\nShould Mr. Khudyan fall into the second category, one would arrive at the same conclusion despite the additional consular registration that the second prong of Article 10(3) initially required. While it is common ground that Mr. Khudyan never registered with an Armenian consulate, the Tribunal is not persuaded that Article 10(3) would operate to deprive him of his Armenian nationality for two independent reasons.\n\n233.\n\nFirst, the 1961 UN Convention on the Reduction of Statelessness was ratified by Armenia in 1994, prior to the adoption of the 1995 Citizenship Law. Article 7(3) of the 1961 UN Convention provides in relevant part that \"*a national of a Contracting State shall not lose his nationality, so as to become stateless, on the ground of departure, residence abroad, failure to register or on any similar ground\"* (emphasis added); Article 8(1) of that Convention provides that \"[a] *Contracting State shall not deprive a person of its nationality if such deprivation would render him stateless* .\"219\n\nUnited Nations, Convention on the Reduction of Statelessness, 1961 (Legal Authority RL-0157), Articles 7(3), 8(1).\n\n234.\n\nIf the registration requirement in the initial version of Article 10(3) had operated to deprive Mr. Khudyan of his Armenian nationality at the time of the entry into force of the 1995 Citizenship Law then this would have rendered him stateless.220 As such, the registration requirement would have created a legal situation that directly conflicts with Armenia\u2019s international law obligation arising under the 1961 UN Convention on the Reduction of Statelessness not to render its citizens stateless.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Reply, \u00b6\u00b637-40; Respondent\u2019s Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b643, 484.\n\n235.\n\nAs to the Claimants\u2019 argument that in the context of State succession, the relevant instrument is not the UN Convention on the Reduction of Statelessness but the 1999 ILC Draft Articles,221 the Tribunal notes that due to the absence of State consensus the 1999 ILC Draft Articles were never transformed into a treaty, convention or any other type of legal instrument open to adoption or ratification by individual States. Nor can they be regarded as reflecting customary international law. As Mr. V\u00e1clav Mikulka\u2019s222 2020 Introductory Note to the 1999 ILC Draft Articles reflects, States have proven to be *\"hesitant to enter into clear legal obligations*223 in relation to the administration of nationality of natural persons and, to date, the UN General Assembly has merely invited States to take into account, as appropriate, the principles of the 1999 ILC Draft Articles when dealing with issues of nationality of natural persons in the framework of State succession. Therefore, as a matter of international law, the 1999 ILC Draft Articles do not bind the Respondent.\n\nTr., Day 1, 145:7-19; Claimants\u2019 Reply, fn 12, citing 1999 ILC Draft Articles (Legal Authority CL-0107), Article 8; Claimants\u2019 PHB \u00b65, fn 23, citing 1999 ILC Draft Articles (Legal Authority CL-0107), pp. 7-8.\n\nMr. V\u00e1clav Mikulka is a Former Member and the Special Rapporteur on Nationality in relation to the Succession of States International Law Commission and Former Director Codification Division United Nations Office of Legal Affairs.\n\nV. Mikulka, Introductory Note to the 1999 Articles on Nationality of Natural Persons in Relation to the Succession of States, January 2020 (available at: https://legal.un.org/avl/ha/annprss/annprss.html).\n\n236.\n\nIn any event, Article 8 of the 1999 ILC Draft Articles (entitled *\"Persons concerned having their habitual residence in another State*\") provides in sub-paragraph 1: \"*A successor State does not have the obligation to attribute its nationality to persons concerned if they have their habitual residence in another State and also have the nationality of that or any other State* .\"224 Thus, under Article 8, *a contrario* a successor State does have the obligation to attribute its nationality to persons concerned (i.e., persons who on the date of the succession of States had the nationality of the predecessor State) who have their habitual residence in another State and do not have the nationality of that State or any other State. At the time of the entry into force of the 1995 Citizenship Law, Mr. Khudyan did not have US nationality. The 1999 ILC Draft Articles are, therefore, perfectly consistent with the position under the 1961 UN Convention on the Reduction of Statelessness in respect of the issue under consideration.\n\n1999 ILC Draft Articles (Legal Authority CL-0107), Article 8.\n\n237.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that Article 5(3) of the Armenian Constitution provides that:\n\n*In case of conflict between norms of international treaties ratified by the Republic of Armenia and those of laws, the norms of the international treaties shall apply.*225\n\nConstitution of the Republic of Armenia, July 5, 1995 (Exhibit C-0118), Article 5(3).\n\n238.\n\nFurthermore, Article 2 of the 1995 Citizenship Law reads:\n\n*The legislation about the citizenship of the Republic of Armenia consists of the Constitution of the Republic of Armenia, the international treaties of the Republic of Armenia, the present law and other legislative acts of the Republic of Armenia.*\n\n*2. If the ratified international treaties of the Republic of Armenia establish norms others than are foreseen by the present law, the norms of the international treaties are put into effect.*226\n\n1 995 Citizenship Law (Exhibits C-0167 / C-0168), Article 2.\n\n239.\n\nAccordingly, the Tribunal accepts the Respondent's submission to the effect that, pursuant to Article 5(3) of the Armenian Constitution, as well as Article 2 of the 1995 Citizenship Law, the international law obligations of the Republic of Armenia arising under the 1961 UN Convention on the Reduction of Statelessness would override any conflicting registration requirement that initially formed part of Article 10(3) of the 1995 Citizenship Law (it was later discarded in 2001 in a subsequent revision). Therefore, to the extent there is any conflict with the 1961 UN Convention, the Tribunal is satisfied that no effect is to be given to the registration requirement initially set forth in the second prong of Article 10(3) of the 1995 Citizenship Law. The Tribunal is reinforced in that conclusion by the fact that the registration requirement was removed by the Armenian legislature in 2001 precisely to avoid the problem of statelessness, with specific reference to the 1961 UN Convention on the Reduction of Statelessness.227 Armenians living abroad would have had a mere 12 days (between the adoption of the 1995 Citizenship Law on November 16, 1995 and its entry into force on November 28, 1995) to register at an Armenian consulate if they had not already done so, while at the same time, no consular recognition procedure existed228 and the Republic of Armenia did not have a consulate in many countries (including in the USA until 1995).229\n\nRepublic of Armenia, National Assembly, Minutes of Fifth Session of Second Convocation, March 19, 2001 (Exhibit C-0172); Tr., Day 4, 1014:2-6.\n\nTr., Day 4, 973:12-16.\n\nTr., Day 4, 973:5-11.\n\n240.\n\nThe Tribunal also does not accept the Claimants\u2019 argument that Mr. Khudyan cannot be deprived of the protection of the ICSID Convention and the BIT on grounds of the alleged incompatibility of Armenia\u2019s own laws with the 1961 UN Convention on the Reduction of Statelessness based on general principles of law. This is not a case of a State seeking to excuse its internationally wrongful behaviour by appealing to its domestic law; it is a case in which this Tribunal must determine whether it has jurisdiction over Mr. Khudyan in light of the requirement in the ICSID Convention that a natural person may not have the nationality of the State party to the dispute.\n\n241.\n\nSecond, the Tribunal is not persuaded that, even if the registration requirement in Article 10(3) were to be given full force and effect, Mr. Khudyan would have thereby been deprived of his Armenian nationality automatically upon the entry into force of the 1995 Citizenship Law, [REDACTED] expert evidence on the 1995 Citizenship Law was very clear in this respect: Armenian nationality can only be terminated in accordance with the special procedure set out in Articles 24 to 26 of the Law.230 Termination must ultimately be memorialized in a Presidential Decree.231 If the Claimants\u2019 interpretation of Article 10(3) were correct, a large number of Armenian nationals would have been rendered stateless when the 1995 Citizenship Law came into effect without any special procedure having been followed or official act of the State of Armenia being issued. It is much more plausible to interpret Article 10 as applying *ex nunc*; in other words, that the persons falling into the enumerated categories would henceforth be considered to be Armenian nationals automatically but without prejudice to the status of Armenian citizenship that had been acquired prior to the 1995 Citizenship Law coming into force. Indeed, the 1995 Citizenship Law does not appear to alter the status of Armenian citizenship acquired prior to that law.\n\nTr., Day 4, 968:7-13.\n\nTr., Day 4, 968:13-18.\n\n242.\n\nThe same observation can be made in relation to the amendment to Article 10(3) in 2001 by which the registration requirement was removed. It seems unlikely that an Armenian national would have been automatically deprived of his or her nationality in 1995 when the earlier version of Article 10(3) came into force by virtue of the registration requirement, and then automatically reinstated with Armenian nationality in 2001 when that requirement was removed by the Armenian legislature. If that were the effect of the 2001 amendment, then one would expect a provision in the amending legislation addressing the reinstatement of citizenship that had been lost automatically by application of the registration requirement in 1995. But there is no such provision.\n\n243.\n\nFinally, it is important to note that, in that relevant period [REDACTED], Mr. Khudyan comported himself in a manner that suggests that he considered himself to be a citizen of the Republic of Armenia. Mr. Khudyan attested at the Hearing that until its expiry [REDACTED], he continued using his USSR passport.232 Also after the entry into force of the 1995 Citizenship Law, Mr. Khudyan continued identifying as an Armenian citizen, as is borne out by the fact that [REDACTED] when he applied for naturalization in the USA, Mr. Khudyan - assisted by an immigration lawyer233 - declared on the application form his \"*Citizenship*\" to be *\"Armenia/Russia.*234 In addition, it is undisputed that stateless persons cannot obtain US nationality through naturalization.235\n\nTr., Day 2, 544:25-545:24.\n\nTr., Day 2, 549:23-25.\n\nApplication for Naturalization of Mr. Edmond Khudyan (Exhibit R-0191).\n\nRespondent\u2019s Rejoinder, \u00b6485.\n\n244.\n\nFor these reasons, the Tribunal concludes:\n\n(1) That Mr. Khudyan was a citizen of Armenia prior to the 1995 Citizenship Law coming into force and was recognized as a citizen of the Republic of Armenia on November 28, 1995, when the 1995 Citizenship Law entered into force;\n\n(2) That Mr. Khudyan did not lose his Armenian nationality for failure to register in accordance with the registration requirement of the second prong of Article 10(3) of the 1995 Citizenship Law, while in force; and\n\n(3) That Mr. Khudyan did not become stateless when the 1995 Citizenship entered into force.\n\n3) Did Mr. Khudyan lose his Armenian citizenship when he acquired US nationality in [REDACTED]?\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n245.\n\nThe starting point for the Tribunal\u2019s analysis of the third issue, as to whether Mr. Khudyan lost his Armenian citizenship when he acquired US citizenship, is that:\n\n- [REDACTED] Mr. Khudyan became a citizen of the USA through naturalization;236 and\n\n- Mr. Khudyan was recognized as a citizen of the Republic of Armenia before and after the 1995 Citizenship Law came into force.237\n\nCertificate of Naturalization of Mr. Edmond Khudyan, [REDACTED] (Exhibit C-0171).\n\n1995 Citizenship Law (Exhibits C-0167, C-0168 / R-0046), Article 10(3); *see* the Tribunal\u2019s findings at 244 above.\n\n246.\n\nAlthough the Tribunal appreciates that the Certificate of Naturalization issued to Mr. Khudyan by the US Commissioner of Immigration and Naturalization states *\"Country of former nationality: Armenia,\"* the Tribunal also notes that upon naturalization the USA does not require a person to renounce any nationality or citizenship that the person held prior to naturalization.238 In any event, the question as to whether Mr. Khudyan lost his Armenian citizenship as a consequence of the acquisition of US citizenship is governed by Armenian law.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Rejoinder, \u00b645; Respondent\u2019s PHB, \u00b66; United States of America, \"Dual Nationality\" (Exhibit R-0121).\n\n247.\n\nIn this respect, the Tribunal notes that in line with prior Soviet policy on the issue239 Article 1(3) of the 1995 Citizenship Law, when enacted, provided that:\n\n*A citizen of the Republic of Armenia may not be concurrently a citizen of another State.*240\n\n[REDACTED] First Expert Opinion, \u00b6\u00b635-42; Tr., Day 4, 961:23-969:7.\n\n1 995 Citizenship Law (Exhibits C-0167, C-0168 / R-0046), Article 1(3).\n\n248.\n\nHence, when Mr. Khudyan acquired US citizenship [REDACTED], he did so in violation of Article 1(3) of the 1995 Citizenship Law. Yet, such violation did not cause him to automatically lose his Armenian citizenship because Articles 23 to 25 of the 1995 Citizenship Law, which regulate the termination of citizenship of the Republic of Armenia, require a specific procedure to be followed.\n\n249.\n\nPursuant to Articles 23 to 28 of the 1995 Citizenship Law, an Armenian citizen can only lose citizenship by way of renunciation or deprivation, both of which are subject to a specific application procedure and require a decree of the President of the Republic of Armenia.241 There is neither a record of an application procedure, nor a Presidential Decree, aimed at the termination of the Armenian citizenship of Mr. Khudyan.242\n\n1995 Citizenship Law (Exhibits C-0167, C-0168 / R-0046), Article 26.\n\nTr., Day 4, 967:23-969:7.\n\n250.\n\nShould Mr. Khudyan have wished to terminate his Armenian citizenship, he should have filed an application to renounce citizenship of the Republic of Armenia under Article 24 of the 1995 Citizenship Law. The fact that he did not constitutes a ground for deprivation of Armenian citizenship under Article 25 but such deprivation also is not automatic. It too requires the competent bodies under Article 26 to 28 of the 1995 Citizenship Law to administer a specific procedure aimed at depriving Mr. Khudyan of his Armenian citizenship. It is common ground that no such procedure ever took place. Therefore, from the time of his acquisition of US citizenship, Mr. Khudyan had two citizenships.\n\n251.\n\nWith the amendment of the 1995 Citizenship Act in 2007, any potential issue arising from Mr. Khudyan\u2019s dual citizenship was removed through the introduction of Article 1(6), which provides:\n\n*Renunciation of the citizenship of the Republic of Armenia or accepting the citizenship of another State shall not per se entail to the loss of citizenship of the Republic of Armenia.*243\n\n1995 Citizenship Law (Exhibits C-0167, C-0168 / R-0046 and C-0188).\n\n252.\n\nBased on the foregoing, the Tribunal concludes that the Claimants' claim to the effect that Mr. Khudyan lost his Armenian citizenship when he acquired US citizenship fails for lack of legal foundation.\n\n253.\n\nAccordingly, the Tribunal finds that despite the fact that Mr. Khudyan became a US citizen [REDACTED], he continued to hold Armenian citizenship.\n\n4) Is Mr. Khudyan's nationality status affected by the issuance [REDACTED] of an Armenian passport with special residency status?\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n254.\n\nThe fourth and final issue the Tribunal will address in the context of the analysis of Mr. Khudyan's nationality is whether Armenia's issuance of a passport with special residency status to Mr. Khudyan affected his nationality status under the applicable Armenian law.244\n\n1995 Citizenship Law (Exhibits C-0167, C-0168 / R-0046), Article 10(3); *see* the Tribunal\u2019s findings at paragraphs 225-232 above.\n\n255.\n\nOn [REDACTED] upon the application of Mr. Khudyan,245 the President of the Republic of Armenia granted Mr. Khudyan special residency status on the basis of Articles 21 and 24 of the Law on the Status of Foreign Citizens.246\n\nApplication of Mr. Edmond Khudyan for Special Residency Status, [REDACTED] (Exhibit R- 0007).\n\nRepublic of Armenia, Presidential Decree No. N NK-18-A, [REDACTED] (Exhibit C-0180); Law on Foreign Citizens (version adopted on June 17, 1994) (Exhibit C-0007), Articles 21, 24.\n\n256.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that Article 2 of the version of the Law on the Status of Foreign Citizens in the Republic of Armenia in force at the time defines a \"*foreign citizen*\" as \"*any person who is not a citizen of the Republic of Armenia and who is a citizen of another state*\".247\n\nLaw on Foreign Citizens (version adopted on June 17, 1994) (Exhibit C-0007), Article 2.\n\n257.\n\nIn addition, Article 21 of the same Law sets forth the conditions upon which special residency status can be granted by the Republic of Armenia:248\n\n*Special resident status may be granted to foreign citizens of Armenian origin.*\n\n*The special resident status may also be granted to other foreign citizens who carry on economic, cultural activity in the Republic of Armenia.*\n\n*The special resident status shall be granted for a period of ten years. It may be granted more than once.*\n\nLaw on Foreign Citizens (version adopted on June 17, 1994) (Exhibit C-0007), Article 21.\n\n258.\n\nWhile the Tribunal acknowledges that on the basis of the Law on the Status of Foreign Citizens only foreigners are eligible for special residency status, in the particular circumstances of this case, the Tribunal is not convinced that the issuance of a special residency passport to Mr. Khudyan proves that he is a foreigner. This is for three main reasons.\n\n259.\n\nFirst, at the time Mr. Khudyan took the initiative of seeking special residency status in the Republic of Armenia by filing an application on [REDACTED],249 his USSR passport had expired. But, although a passport forms *prima facie* evidence of a person\u2019s nationality, it is not a pre-requisite for, or constitutive of, nationality.250 Nationality or citizenship is established by reference to the applicable law, which at that moment, in his case, was the 1995 Citizenship Law, as amended. When applying for special residency status in Armenia in [REDACTED] Mr. Khudyan may have been unaware that pursuant to Article 10(3) of the 1995 Citizenship Law he was actually recognized as a citizen of the Republic of Armenia.\n\nApplication of Mr. Edmond Khudyan for Special Residency Status, [REDACTED] (Exhibit R- 0007).\n\nSchreuer Commentary (Legal Authorities CL-0080 / RL-0030), \u00b6\u00b6648-649; Z.

As a mutual mistake is not a ground for the termination of citizenship under the 1995 Citizenship Law, the Tribunal concludes that Mr. Khudyan\u2019s Armenian nationality remained legally unaffected by the issuance of a special residency passport to Mr. Khudyan [REDACTED]. As attested by [REDACTED], such mistakes are rather common and are remedied in practice by means of an invalidation of the decision to grant special residency status and a repeal of the relevant Presidential Decree.256\n\nTr., Day 4, 971:24-972:7.\n\n264.\n\nHaving established that Mr. Khudyan did not lose his Armenian citizenship as a result of (1) the proclamation of independence by the Supreme Council of the ASSR in 1991; (2) the entry into force of the 1995 Citizenship Law; (3) the acquisition of US nationality [REDACTED] and (4) the issuance of a passport with special residency status [REDACTED] , the Tribunal concludes that Mr. Khudyan is a citizen of the Republic of Armenia.\n\n265.\n\nAccordingly, Mr. Khudyan does not satisfy the nationality requirement of Article 25(2)(a) of the ICSID Convention because he is a person who had the nationality of the Contracting State party to the dispute (i.e., the Republic of Armenia) when the Request for Arbitration was filed on September 18, 2017, as well as on September 27, 2017 when the Request for Arbitration was registered by the ICSID Secretariat.\n\n266.\n\nTherefore, the Tribunal has no jurisdiction *ratione personae* over the first Claimant, Mr. Khudyan.\n\n267.\n\nIn light of this conclusion, the Respondent's other arguments in support of its objection to the Tribunal's *ratione personae* jurisdiction in respect of Mr. Khudyan (including those based on (i) an alleged abuse of rights and process; (ii) Mr. Khudyan's dual nationality at the time of the alleged investments; and (iii) other policy arguments said to militate against an exercise of jurisdiction over Mr. Khudyan257) are moot and will not be addressed by the Tribunal.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial, Section E.VI.4-6.\n\n*(ii) Claimant 2 - Arin Capital & Investment Corp.*\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n1) Respondent\u2019s jurisdictional objection *ratione personae* based on Article 25 of the ICSID Convention\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n268.\n\nIn respect of the Claimant 2, Arin US, the Tribunal notes that the requirements for a legal entity, set forth in the first part of Article 25(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention, are similar to those of the BIT. A legal entity is deemed an investor for the purposes of Article 25(2)(b) if it is validly constituted under the laws of its claimed home State.\n\n269.\n\nAs stated at paragraph 200 above, Arin US is incorporated in accordance with the laws of the State of California (USA).\n\n270.\n\nWhile that fact is uncontested, the Respondent argues that for purposes of the ICSID Convention, Arin US should be characterized as a national of Armenia and is hence outside the scope of Article 25(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention and thereby outside the jurisdiction of this Tribunal. Relying on Prof. Schreuer\u2019s Commentary and on ICSID jurisprudence, the Respondent argues that it would be in violation of the object and purpose of the ICSID Convention to qualify Arin US as a *\"national of another Contracting State\"* for purposes of Article 25(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention in circumstances where that company allegedly is nothing but a shell company, wholly owned and controlled by Mr. Khudyan, an Armenian national. According to the Respondent, allowing Arin US to qualify as a foreign investor on the basis of its State of incorporation alone, without having regard to the Armenian nationality of its \"*predominant shareholder and manager*,\" would be tantamount to allowing a national to bring a claim against its own State.258 The Respondent concludes on this basis that Arin US does not qualify as an *\"investor\"* under Article 25(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention and hence falls outside this Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction *ratione personae*.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6191-196, fn 187.\n\n271.\n\nWhile the Claimants in their Reply purport to address the Respondent\u2019s jurisdictional objections in relation to Arin US, their arguments are largely unresponsive to the particular objection raised by the Respondent. The Claimants did not rebut the legal authorities relied on by the Respondent, nor do they offer any observations on the scope and limits of Article 25(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention or on the suggestion that the Tribunal ought to disregard the State of incorporation of Arin US and determine its nationality according to the nationality of its predominant shareholder and manager.259\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial, \u00b6195.\n\n272.\n\nThe only argument that the Tribunal is able to discern in the pleadings of the Claimants in this respect is the general proposition that Mr. Khudyan would be the agent of Arin US under California law and that his control over the alleged investments in Armenia can be imputed to his principal, Arin US. The Tribunal understands the Claimants to allege that not Mr. Khudyan, but Arin US *through* Mr. Khudyan, in his capacity as its CEO, controls the investments that were owned initially by Mr. Khudyan and later by Arin Armenia. For this reason, the Claimants maintain that the Tribunal should reject the Respondent's objection *ratione personae* over Arin US.260\n\nClaimants\u2019 Reply, \u00b665.\n\n273.\n\nThe Tribunal is aware of the legal commentary and the body of ICSID jurisprudence supporting the proposition that reliance on the formal place of incorporation of a legal entity, despite the fact that the investment is in reality owned and controlled by nationals of the host State, would allow formalism to prevail over reality and undermine the actual object and purpose of the ICSID Convention.\n\n274.\n\nIn *TSA Spectrum v. Argentina*, the tribunal observed:\n\n*This text* [Article 25(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention] *may be interpreted in a strict constructionist manner to mean that a tribunal has to go always by the formal nationality. On the other hand, such a strict literal interpretation may appear to go against common sense in some circumstances, especially when the formal nationality covers a corporate entity controlled directly or indirectly by persons of the same nationality as the host State.*261\n\n*TSA Spectrum de Argentina S.A. v. Argentine Republic,* ICSID Case No. ARB/05/5, Award, December 19, 2008 (Legal Authority RL-0059) (***TSA Spectrum v. Argentina***), \u00b6145.\n\n275.\n\nFurthermore, in his dissenting in the *Tokios Tokel\u00e8s v Ukraine* case, Prof. Weil observed that:\n\n*What is decisive in our case is the simple, straightforward, objective fact that the dispute before this ICSID Tribunal is not between the Ukrainian State and a foreign investor but between the Ukrainian State and an Ukrainian investor - and to such relationship and to such a dispute the ICSID Convention was not meant to apply and does not apply.*262[emphasis in original]\n\nWeil Opinion (Legal Authority RL-0060), \u00b621.\n\n276.\n\nThe Respondent also relies on Prof. Schreuer\u2019s Commentary on the ICSID Convention, which cites Mr. Broches\u2019 statement to the effect that \"[i]*n giving effect to such an agreement* [an agreement to submit to ICSID\u2019s jurisdiction], *a commission or tribunal should take account not only of formal criteria such as incorporation but also of economic realities such as ownership and control.*\"263\n\nSchreuer Commentary (Legal Authorities CL-0080 / RL-0030), \u00b6698.\n\n277.\n\nHaving considered the Respondent\u2019s objection and arguments in this respect, the Tribunal first notes that pursuant to Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention, the Centre\u2019s jurisdiction covers \"*any legal dispute arising directly out of an investment, between a Contracting State ... and a national of another Contracting State, which the parties to the dispute consent in writing to submit to the Centre.\"*\n\n278.\n\nFurthermore, Article 25(2)(b) defines a *\"'National of another Contracting State'\"* as:\n\n*(b) any juridical person which had the nationality of a Contracting State other than the State party to the dispute on the date on which the parties consented to submit such dispute to ... arbitration and any juridical person which had the nationality of the Contracting State party to the dispute on that date and which, because of foreign control, the parties have agreed should be treated as a national of another Contracting State for the purposes of this Convention.*\n\n279.\n\nThe ICSID Convention does not itself provide a definition of the concept of *\"nationality\"* for the purposes of Article 25. Instead, it offers State Parties broad discretion to define nationality and to articulate the criteria by which nationality is to be determined. As regards the nationality of a company, the Armenia-US BIT is clear. It stipulates in Article 1(b) that \"company\" of a Party means:\n\n*any kind of corporation, company, association, partnership, or other organization, legally constituted under the laws and regulations of a Party or a political subdivision thereof whether or not organized for pecuniary gain, or privately or governmentally owned or controlled*.264 [emphasis added]\n\nBIT (Legal Authorities CL-0081 / RL-0037), Article I(1)(b).\n\n280.\n\nAs indicated above, it is undisputed that Arin US is legally constituted in accordance with the laws of the State of California (USA) and, therefore, Arin US qualifies for purposes of the BIT as a US company, and, by extension, as \"*a national of another Contracting State\"* for purposes of the Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention.\n\n281.\n\nThe Tribunal does not accept to read into the BIT or the ICSID Convention criteria for establishing nationality other than those that are actually stated in those instruments (such as control). As the tribunal in *Rompetrol v. Romania* correctly observed, this would be \"*tantamount to setting aside the clear language agreed upon by the treaty Parties*\"265 in violation of the customary principles of treaty interpretation as embodied in the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (\"**VCLT**\"), and notably Article 31 thereof pursuant to which a treaty is to be interpreted \"*in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in the light of its object and purpose.*\"266\n\n*The Rompetrol Group N.V. v. Romania,* ICSID Case No. ARB/06/3, Decision on Jurisdiction and Admissibility, April 18, 2008 *(\"**Rompetrol v. Romania**\")* (Legal Authority CL-0063), \u00b685 (available at: https://www.italaw.com/sites/default/files/case-documents/ita0717.pdf).\n\nVienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, May 23, 1969 (Legal Authority CL-0070), Article 31.\n\n282.\n\nHad the State Parties to the Armenia-US BIT wanted to elevate the element of *\"control\"* to a criterion relevant for the determination of a company\u2019s nationality, they could have included a provision to that end. Such provisions are by no means uncommon in treaty practice. They did not. Similarly, had the drafters of the ICSID Convention intended to include a requirement that a juridical person or legal entity cannot be controlled by a national of the Contracting State party to the dispute, they could have included specific wording to this effect in the first limb of Article 25(2)(b), just like they specified in the immediately preceding paragraph that a natural person may not have the nationality of the Contracting State party to the dispute. Again, they did not.\n\n283.\n\nWhile the Tribunal appreciates that in exceptional cases of (suspected) abuse, there may be reasons to analyse the nationality of a corporation beyond the mere incorporation requirement, it notes that the Respondent has not advanced such an argument, nor has it made a *prima facie* showing of abuse of Arin US's corporate form that would warrant investigating such an abuse.\n\n284.\n\nAccordingly, the Tribunal concludes that there are no grounds to, as the Respondent requests, *\"pierce the corporate veil\"* by disregarding *\"Claimant 2's state of incorporation and determine its nationality according to the nationality of its predominant shareholder and manager.*\"267\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial, \u00b6195.\n\n285.\n\nInstead, the Tribunal finds that Arin US is a US national for purposes of the BIT and \"*a national of another Contracting State\"* in the sense of Article 25(1)(b) of the ICSID Convention. Therefore, the Tribunal rejects the Respondent's jurisdictional objection *ratione personae* founded on Article 25 of the ICSID Convention in relation to the second Claimant, Arin US.\n\n2) Respondent's jurisdictional objection based on a purported abuse of right\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n286.\n\nThe Respondent also raised a jurisdictional objection against Arin US on grounds of a purported abuse of right due to its failure to claim for a distinct harm.\n\n287.\n\nRelying on the tribunal's decision in *Orascom v. Algeria,* the Respondent submits that it *\"has not consented to being sued by other entities that are controlled by Claimant 1, in relation to the same alleged investment, the same alleged measures and the same alleged harm\"* and asserts that Arin US, being controlled by Mr. Khudyan, *\"cannot seek protection for the same harm inflicted on Claimant 1's alleged investment*.\"268\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6199-201, citing *Orascom v. Algeria* (Legal Authority RL-0061), \u00b6\u00b6542-543.\n\n288.\n\nIt asserts that Arin US\u2019s conduct amounts to an abuse of the system of investment protection, which would constitute a further ground for the inadmissibility of Arin US\u2019s claim and precludes this Tribunal from exercising jurisdiction over this dispute.269\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial, \u00b6202.\n\n289.\n\nThe Claimants reject the Respondent\u2019s objection, arguing it lacks any merit as they did not start \"*separate arbitration proceedings in connection with the same investment that could create a risk of duplicative liability for Respondent.\"* According to the Claimants, *\"full reparation to either Claimant would compensate both Claimants*,\"270 thereby excluding abuse and the risk of double recovery.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Reply, \u00b665, fn 92.\n\n290.\n\nIn assessing the Respondent\u2019s second jurisdictional objection in relation to Arin US, the Tribunal first notes that in *Orascom v. Algeria,* the single case relied upon by the Respondent, the question of abuse in the sense articulated by Algeria was not so much dealt with as a jurisdictional objection, but more as an issue of standing and admissibility. More importantly, the facts in that case were on a crucial point different from those of the present case. In that case, Algeria had faced claims in relation to the same harm in different proceedings brought under different bilateral investment treaties by different companies placed at various levels of the same vertical corporate chain. It was in view of these circumstances that the *Orascom* tribunal ultimately held that *\"this conduct must be viewed as an abuse of the system of investment protection, which constitutes a further ground for the inadmissibility of the Claimant\u2019s claims and precludes the Tribunal from exercising its jurisdiction over this dispute*.\"271\n\n*Orascom v. Algeria* (Legal Authority RL-0061), \u00b6545.\n\n291.\n\nIn the case at hand, such circumstances have not been argued, let alone demonstrated by the Respondent. Indeed, as the Claimants have correctly pointed out, they did not start separate arbitration proceedings in connection with the same investment but rather brought their claims in one arbitration in which context they have, moreover, represented that \"*full reparation to either Claimant would compensate both Claimants.*\"272 Accordingly, in the present case there is no risk of double recovery or duplicative liability for the Respondent that could be labelled as an abuse of right.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Reply, \u00b665, fn 92.\n\n292.\n\nMoreover, the Tribunal notes that in the present case, Arin US does not assert claims in relation to the exact same investments as Mr. Khudyan does.273 Also for this reason, there is - without more - no ground to presume for purposes of jurisdiction that Arin US is claiming for the exact same harm as Mr. Khudyan and that this amounts to an impermissible abuse of rights, warranting a finding of inadmissibility and barring Claimant 2 from the protection of the BIT.\n\nFor instance, Arin US asserts claims arising out of its purported investment consisting of the receivables purportedly owed to it by Arin LLC in connection with the transfer of the [REDACTED] for investment in the development of the [REDACTED] Building, while Mr. Khudyan does not.\n\n293.\n\nFor these reasons, the Tribunal also rejects the Respondent's second jurisdictional objection in relation to Arin US.\n\n294.\n\nThe next question is whether the Tribunal also has jurisdiction *ratione materiae* over Arin US's purported investments, which will be addressed in **Section V.B** below.\n\n**B.

Bolivia* and *Saba Fakes v. Turkey)* and in legal commentary.281\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b653-54.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b655-56, citing, *inter alia,* *Aguas del Tunari S.A. v.

Uzbekistan,* holding that for an investment to be a protected investment, it must always include the elements of contribution, risk and a certain duration.285 It emphasizes that the *Romak* decision is based on the Switzerland-Uzbekistan BIT, which contains a definition of investment that is \"*meaningfully similar*\" and even \"*facially broader*\" than the investment definition in the Armenia-US BIT because it includes within its scope \"*every kind of assets.\"* Therefore, the holding of the *Romak* tribunal certainly stands in the context of the more narrowly drawn definition of investment of Article I(1)(a) of the Armenia-US BIT.286 The Respondent further refers to *Ulysseas v. Ecuador* and *Alps Finance v. Slovakia,*287 where the tribunals came to a conclusion similar to that of the *Romak* tribunal. Moreover, the *Ulysseas* decision was rendered under another US bilateral investment treaty (the Ecuador-US BIT), which contains a definition of \"*investment*\" that is nearly identical to the definition in the Armenia-US BIT.288\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b666-67.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b667-69; Respondent\u2019s Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6386-387.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial, \u00b669.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b669-71; Respondent\u2019s Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6422-424, citing *Romak S.A. v.

By reference to the Preamble of the BIT and the US President\u2019s Letter of Submittal, transmitting the BIT to the Senate, the Respondent submits that only investments that contribute to economic cooperation between the contracting States, that are made for a certain duration, that involve a contribution and that are exposed to risk, satisfy this criterion.289\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b674-79, referring to, *inter alia,* BIT (Legal Authorities CL-0081 / RL-0037), pp. 2-3.\n\n301.\n\nFurther, with respect to the investment requirement under the ICSID Convention, while the term *\"investment\"* was left undefined in Article 25(1) by the drafters of the ICSID Convention, the Respondent argues that this does not mean that any transaction falls within the scope of application of Article 25(1). The Respondent criticizes the Claimants\u2019 reliance on Prof. Schreuer\u2019s Commentary to the effect that *\"investment in the sense of Art. 25 of the Convention may cover almost any area of economic activity* ...\" as quoted out of context,290 because elsewhere Prof. Schreuer identifies on the basis of ICSID jurisprudence (starting with *Fedax v. Venezuela)* the typical features of an investment required in order for it be recognized as such within the ICSID system.291\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b680-83, citing Claimants\u2019 Memorial, \u00b6161, fn 215 (quoting, in turn, Schreuer Commentary (Legal Authorities CL-0080 / RL-0030), \u00b6148.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial, \u00b684; Respondent\u2019s Rejoinder, \u00b6406, citing *Fedax N.

Morocco* case, that in order for the investment to be recognized as such under the ICSID Convention, an investment must satisfy four criteria: (1) a contribution, (2) a certain duration of the operation, (3) risk and (4) a contribution to the host State's development.292 While the Respondent recognizes that there are certain reservations about the application of the *Salini* criteria, it insists that the *Salini* criteria have been cited in many decisions and accepted to varying degrees by tribunals,293 and should also be taken into account by the Tribunal in conjunction with one another and not in isolation.294\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b685-86, citing, *inter alia,* *Salini Construttori S.p.A. and Italstrade S.p.A. v.

Malaysia,* and decisions criticizing the *\"Salini test,\"* such as *Biwater Gauff v. Tanzania*).295 In any event, other tribunals have found a sensible middle ground, requiring an investment to satisfy the criteria of a contribution, a certain duration and an element of risk, without explicitly referring to the *\"Salini test.*296\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b689-90, citing, *inter alia,* *Malaysian Historical Salvors, Sdn, Bhd v.

Recognizing that \"*contribution*\" can comprise a financial contribution or a contribution in kind, the Respondent points out that the Claimants only claim to have made financial contributions for which there is no evidence.299\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial, \u00b6100.\n\n307.\n\nIn order to prove the contribution of funds, the Respondent submits that the Claimants have to demonstrate the actual transfer of funds invested in relation to the alleged investments, as well as the purported investor\u2019s ownership of the alleged contribution.300 According to the Respondent, there must be proof of a link between the investment and the person who claims to have made the relevant investment.301 It is the Respondent\u2019s case that the Claimants failed to prove a contribution in respect of any of the three transactions alleged by the Claimants to constitute their initial investment in Armenia.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6101-102.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial, \u00b6103.\n\n308.\n\nWith regard to the original purchase of [REDACTED] Property, the Respondent argues that the Claimants\u2019 own evidence shows that it was not Mr. Khudyan who paid the purchase price but [REDACTED] and that the Claimants have failed to prove that either of the Claimants were at the origin of this transaction. The Respondent insists that the Claimants\u2019 mere assertion to the effect that the funds for the purchase were provided by Arin US does not discharge the Claimants\u2019 burden of proof.302 In particular, the Respondent insists that the Claimants failed to adduce any evidence of the alleged relation of [REDACTED] to the Claimants, who was initially described by Mr. Khudyan in his Witness Statement as a friend and then at the Hearing as an employee of Claimant 2, Arin US.303 Nor did the Claimants adduce any evidence to the effect that Mr. Khudyan would be the beneficial owner of the alleged investment made by [REDACTED].304\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6104-107.\n\nRespondent\u2019s PHB, \u00b6\u00b628-30, referring to Tr., Day 2, 311:7-21.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6104-105; Respondent\u2019s Rejoinder, \u00b6430.\n\n309.\n\nArmenia further reiterates that Mr. Khudyan\u2019s explanation of this transaction changed continually during his cross-examination. Specifically, the Respondent questions the explanation that Mr. Khudyan came up with for the first time during the Hearing that the purchase price of the [REDACTED] Property was paid by [REDACTED] using cashiers\u2019 cheques issued by Arin US, as this is contradicted by the tax returns that are in the record of this arbitration.305 The Respondent further notes that Mr. Khudyan\u2019s testimony at the Hearing contradicts the contemporaneous evidence on record. Mr. Khudyan initially testified that [REDACTED] did not have an account at [REDACTED] (the bank that processed the alleged payment), but later stated that the account number indicated on the relevant payment slip is the [REDACTED] account belonging to [REDACTED].306 The Respondent insists that there are multiple outstanding questions in relation to this transaction, including how the money wired by [REDACTED] to [REDACTED] reached the owner of [REDACTED] Property, how the land plot was first transferred to [REDACTED] and later to Mr. Khudyan and what arrangements they were based on, etc.307 In this respect, the Respondent points out that during his cross-examination, Mr. Khudyan attested that he knew neither the owner of the [REDACTED] Property, nor how the price that the Claimants allegedly paid for the land plot was fixed.308\n\nRespondent\u2019s PHB, \u00b6\u00b631-34, referring to Tr., Day 2, 351:11-19, 565:21, 341:14-15.\n\nRespondent\u2019s PHB, \u00b6\u00b635-36, referring to Tr., Day 2, 347:23-348:9.\n\nRespondent\u2019s PHB, \u00b6\u00b637-42.\n\nRespondent\u2019s PHB, \u00b6\u00b641-42. *See also* Tr., Day 2, 356:10-18, 365:11-25.\n\n310.\n\nWith regard to the re-purchase of [REDACTED] Property, the Respondent submits that the lack of the Claimants' contribution towards and ownership of the investment is even more evident, as Mr. Khudyan admits that the [REDACTED] allegedly used to fund this acquisition did not come from either of the Claimants, but was provided by [REDACTED].309 However, the Respondent also queries that explanation, as the payment evidence on record is limited to a single wire transfer [REDACTED] from Arin US to Arin Armenia. The Respondent emphasizes the lack of actual contribution by Mr. Khudyan to this transaction as the [REDACTED] invested by [REDACTED] was repaid with the funds of a loan that Arin Armenia took out from [REDACTED] As the amount was encumbered under the [REDACTED] loan, it does not amount to a contribution by either Mr. Khudyan or Arin US.310\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial, \u00b6106.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Rejoinder, \u00b6432; Respondent\u2019s PHB, \u00b647.\n\n311.\n\nWith respect to the purchase of the [REDACTED] Property, the Respondent submits that the Claimants did not provide any contemporaneous evidence concerning the funding of the alleged purchase and points out that the only evidence adduced by the Claimants to support their investment claim is Mr. Khudyan's testimony.311 In any event, as the amount that Mr. Khudyan claims to have spent on the purchase of [REDACTED] Property was lower than the amount for which he sold the [REDACTED] Property earlier, the difference cannot be qualified as a (new) contribution on Mr. Khudyan\u2019s part but stems from the initial money invested by [REDACTED]312\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial, \u00b6107; Respondent\u2019s Rejoinder, \u00b6431; Respondent\u2019s PHB, \u00b644.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Rejoinder, \u00b6431; Respondent\u2019s PHB, \u00b645.\n\n312.\n\nFurthermore, the Respondent claims that the Claimants failed to demonstrate any value creation with their investment. By reference to the decisions in *Postov\u00e1 banka v. Greece* and *Romak v. Uzbekistan,* the Respondent argues that even if the Claimants were able to prove the existence and their ownership of the alleged funds, the mere fact that the Claimants purchased [REDACTED] plots does not amount to the requisite contribution because they are not part of a process of value creation, which distinguishes investments from ordinary commercial transactions.313 Instead of creating value, the Claimants allegedly paid the purchase price of the land plots, which equates a simple exchange of values, not an investment.314\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6108-109, citing *Po\u0161tov\u00e1 banka, a.s. and Istrokapital SE v.

According to the Respondent, it is clear that none of the initial transactions alleged by the Claimants involved or was aimed at any value creation.318 The construction contracts concluded between Mr. Khudyan and [REDACTED] demonstrate that the construction works were financed by the proceeds from the sales of the future apartment units, not by any contribution from either Mr. Khudyan or Arin US.319\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial, \u00b6111.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial, \u00b6111.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial, \u00b6111.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6112-115.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6115-116.\n\n314.\n\nFinally, the Respondent maintains that even after the alleged restructuring of the purported investment [REDACTED] involving (1) the creation of Arin Armenia, (2) the transfer of [REDACTED] Properties from Mr. Khudyan to the charter capital of Arin Armenia and 3) the Shareholders Agreement [REDACTED], [REDACTED], neither Claimant contributed in any way to the alleged investments.320 It is the Respondent\u2019s case that without further funding or any kind of additional contribution, the restructuring did not rise to the level of an investment, warranting protection under the BIT and the ICSID Convention.321\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial,\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial, \u00b6119.\n\n315.\n\nSecond, in respect of investment risk, Armenia submits that the Claimants did not assume any investment risk in making their purported investment, and to the extent the Tribunal were to find that they did, such risk was purely commercial in nature.322\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial, \u00b6120.\n\n316.\n\nAgain by reference to the decision in *Romak v. Uzbekistan*, the Respondent argues that day-to-day business risks must be distinguished from investment risk, which concerns the uncertainty of the investor with respect to the return on its investment.323\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6121-122; Respondent\u2019s Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6456-461, citing *Romak v. Uzbekistan* (Legal Authority RL-0034), \u00b6\u00b630-35, 37, 53, 56-58, 60, 66, 229-230.\n\n317.\n\nWith the initial purchase of the [REDACTED] Property, the only risk that the Claimants arguably incurred is the risk of fluctuation of the market price of the land, which is a purely commercial risk.324 It is the Respondent\u2019s position that the risks involved in the construction of the apartment building and the sales of the apartments, both of which Mr. Khudyan entrusted [REDACTED], are commercial in nature.325 While an investor is exposed to risk and uncertainty about the return on his investment, Mr. Khudyan did not run any risk as his agreement with [REDACTED] guaranteed him that he would receive [REDACTED].326 In fact, part of his alleged equity investment was repaid to Mr. Khudyan from the mortgage-backed loan that Arin Armenia took out from [REDACTED].327 Moreover, the Respondent contends that the Claimants were not exposed to any fluctuation in real estate prices because the apartments were sold to prospective buyers ahead of the construction.328\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial, \u00b6123.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial, \u00b6124.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial, \u00b6125; Khudyan\u2019s First Witness Statement, \u00b617.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Rejoinder, \u00b6440.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Rejoinder, \u00b6453.\n\n318.\n\nAs Mr. Khudyan knew exactly how much he invested and agreed with [REDACTED] how much his guaranteed return would be, the mere transfer of the [REDACTED] Properties to the charter capital of Arin Armenia does not involve any exposure of his own funds to investment risk.329\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial, \u00b6125.\n\n319.\n\n[REDACTED] As a result, Armenia submits, Mr. Khudyan entered into the underlying transactions on the premise that the investment was not exposed to any risk.330\n\nRespondent\u2019s PHB, \u00b6\u00b650-54; Tr., Day 2, 372:8-13.\n\n320.\n\nThe only risk that materialized were the repeated breaches by [REDACTED] of the contractual obligations he had assumed towards Mr. Khudyan and Arin Armenia. The Respondent is of the view that Mr. Khudyan has only himself to blame for this because he continued working with [REDACTED] despite his repeated breaches of other contractual obligations [REDACTED].331 Despite the unsuccessful cooperation and the lack of reliability, Mr. Khudyan continued buying real estate and concluding new agreements with [REDACTED]. According to the Respondent, Mr. Khudyan was fully aware of the risk of doing business with [REDACTED] but chose to continue his dealings only because he wanted to take a chance on the speculatively high returns promised by [REDACTED].332\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6126-132.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial, \u00b6133; Respondent\u2019s PHB, \u00b6\u00b655-57; Tr., Day 2, 395:6-21.\n\n321.\n\nThird, in respect of duration of the investment the Respondent argues that the duration of the Claimants\u2019 alleged investments was insufficient for it to qualify as an investment. It is the Respondent\u2019s case that the relevant time period to be taken into consideration by the Tribunal for the purposes of determining the duration of the alleged investments, is the period during which the Claimants performed their contractual obligations, which allows the Tribunal to distinguish between one-off commercial transactions and proper investment ventures.333 According to the Respondent, the duration of the performance of the Claimants\u2019 contractual obligations in the context of the alleged investments was insufficient to qualify as an investment.334\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6135-136.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial, \u00b6137.\n\n322.\n\nWith regard to the Claimants\u2019 alleged initial investment in the [REDACTED] Property, the Respondent contends that that alleged investment was limited to a mere purchase without any obligation of construction.335 Mr. Khudyan agreed with [REDACTED] that he would construct a [REDACTED] building at his own expense within one year following the acquisition of the land plot by Mr. Khudyan, who would be paid back the monies allegedly invested with an additional profit from the proceeds of the sales of the apartments.336 The Respondent posits that similar arrangements were concluded with respect to the [REDACTED] and the repurchase of [REDACTED].337\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial, \u00b6138.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial, \u00b6139.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial, \u00b6139.\n\n323.\n\nAs to the alleged restructuring of the Claimants\u2019 purported investment, the Respondent argues that the duration of the Claimants\u2019 performance was equally punctual. Mr. Khudyan\u2019s sole obligation under the contractual arrangement he made with [REDACTED] was limited to the transfer of the land to the charter capital of Arin Armenia and the transfer of a portion of its share capital to [REDACTED].338\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial, \u00b6140.\n\n324.\n\nThe Respondent claims that the short duration of all of the Claimants\u2019 alleged investments must be distinguished from cases where investments were found to have been made in relation to construction projects. Notably, the decision in *Toto v. Lebanon,* in which the tribunal exercised jurisdiction, concerned the construction by the investor of a highway over a period of more than five years.339 By contrast, the Claimants in this case did everything within their power to reduce the duration of the purported investment by seeking to withdraw funds immediately upon becoming available, the most blatant example being the repayment [REDACTED] loan to Mr. Khudyan as part of the equity he had contributed to Arin Armenia under the Shareholders Agreement.340\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial, \u00b6141, citing Toto Costruzioni Generali S.p.A. v. Republic of Lebanon, ICSID Case No. ARB/07/12, Decision on Jurisdiction, September 11, 2009 *(\"**Toto v. Lebanon**\")* (Legal Authority RL-0052), \u00b6\u00b670, 86-87.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Rejoinder, \u00b6462.\n\n325.\n\nThe Respondent further challenges the Claimants\u2019 argument that they held on to an interest in the [REDACTED] development for a period of seven years and thereby would meet the duration requirement for an investment,341 by insisting that the Tribunal must assess the duration of an investment by reference to the anticipated duration of the venture and not by reference to its actual duration.342 In this context, the Respondent emphasizes that the construction contract for the [REDACTED] building was signed on [REDACTED] and provided for completion of the project barely a year later, by [REDACTED].343 As preliminary sale and purchase agreements of apartments had been concluded prior to the start of the construction, the Claimants were not exposed to any risk during the construction period, as a result of which the exposure of the capital committed to any risk was too brief to rise to the levels of an actual investment.344\n\nRespondent\u2019s Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6463-467.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Rejoinder, \u00b6463.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Rejoinder, \u00b6466.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6464-466.\n\n326.\n\nFinally, in respect of the development and/or benefit to the host State, the Respondent submits that the Claimants' transactions in relation to the [REDACTED] Properties were purely speculative and failed to contribute to Armenia's development. It is the Respondent's case that, as a result, the Claimants' alleged investments do not constitute an investment within the meaning of the ICSID Convention.\n\n327.\n\nThe Respondent argues that the construction of a luxury eleven-storey apartment building did not confer any benefit to the Armenian economy or to the Armenian population at large *(cf.* the investment in the case *Jan de Nul v. Egypt)*.345 The Claimants never intended to continue or expand their activity in Armenia (*cf*. the investment in the case *CSOB v. Slovakia*) but instead opted for an exit within the shortest possible timeframe.346 Unlike investment projects in which the investor engages in significant economic activity, aiming to create or facilitate a flow of private international capital to the host State, the Claimants' goal was exactly the opposite. They sought to take their capital out of the country immediately when (preliminary) purchase agreements had been concluded in respect of apartment units.347\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6146-148, citing, *inter alia, Jan de Nul N.V.\u00a0and Dredging International N.V. v. Arab Republic of Egypt, ICSID Case No. ARB/04/13, Decision on Jurisdiction, June 16, 2006 (\"**Jan de Nul v. Egyp**t) (Legal Authority RL-0041), \u00b692*.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6149-150, citing *Ceskoslovenska Obchodni Banka A.S. v. Slovak Republic,* ICSID Case No. ARB/97/4, Decision on Jurisdiction, May 24, 1999 *(**CSOB v. Slovakia**\")* (Legal Authority RL-0046), \u00b6\u00b62, 80-88.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial, \u00b6151.\n\n328.\n\nIn that framework, the Respondent reiterates that the Claimants do not deny that Arin Armenia engaged in tax fraud, large-scale embezzlement, corruption and moreover defrauded Armenian residents by taking their money for apartment units that they would never receive.348 The Respondent denies the Claimants' assertion that real estate projects such as the Claimants' propelled the Armenian economy and caused an increase in residential construction in the 2000s. Instead, the Respondent argues, the Claimants' venture was premised on channelling the funds committed by buyers under preliminary sale and purchase agreement towards the repayment of Mr. Khudyan's alleged investments before the building was completed and the financing of the construction. The Respondent concludes that instead of making an investment, Mr. Khudyan opportunistically pursued a quick profit.349\n\nRespondent\u2019s Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6468-470.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6471-472.\n\n329.\n\nLastly, in respect of control, the Respondent submits that Arin US did not have any control over the alleged investments, either directly or indirectly, as required by the BIT.350 The Claimants did not adduce any evidence to prove the existence of \"control\" by Arin US over the alleged investments under any arguably relevant test. To support this argument, the Respondent makes the following points.\n\n- The Claimants did not prove control of Arin US on the basis of the autonomous test established by the majority of the tribunal in *AdT v. Bolivia*, which is mirrored by the Letter of Submittal of the BIT, defining control as *\"[o]wnership of over 50 percent of the voting stock of a company.*\"351 The Respondent argues that although this test also acknowledges other forms of control, the Claimants failed to make any showing that Arin US possessed any kind of legal rights over the alleged investments.352 In particular, the Respondent notes that, in respect of the initial purchase of the [REDACTED] Property, the Claimants failed to prove that the funds for this acquisition were provided by Arin US, and also failed to prove that it acquired any legal rights over the immovable property in consideration of its funding.353 Arin US\u2019s lack of control over the alleged investments became even more apparent after the alleged restructuring of the investment, when the purported investment, then consisting of Mr. Khudyan\u2019s 100% shareholding in Arin Armenia, was alienated in part to [REDACTED] without any involvement of or any shares being provided to Arin US.354\n\n- The Claimants\u2019 reliance on the decisions in *S.D. Myers v. Canada* and *Standard Chartered v. Tanzania* to argue that the mere funding of an alleged investment is sufficient to constitute \"*control*,\" is misplaced according to the Respondent. In *S.D. Myers* the tribunal did not take the fact that SDMI (the investor company) had provided a loan to Myers Canada (the investment company) into account in its decision.355 The Respondent further argues that the decision in *Standard Chartered* also must be distinguished from the present dispute because it concerned the equity of the alleged investor in a company, which held security for loans given to a Tanzanian borrower. The tribunal held that such ownership was not sufficient and required *\"some activity of investing\"* in order to exercise jurisdiction in relation to the alleged investments.356 The Respondent argues that in the present case, Arin US neither owns any shares of the company that owns the real estate in question, nor has performed any investment activity.357 In addition, the Respondent argues that the tribunal\u2019s decision in *S.D. Myers* was based on pure policy considerations and that it did not consider the evidence before it for the purposes of *\"control.\"* The Respondent insists that such an approach would render the jurisdictional requirements of the ICSID Convention and the BIT meaningless.358\n\n- The Claimants also did not prove control of Arin US on the basis of Section 160 of the Corporations Code of the State of California, where Arin US is incorporated, which defines *\"control\"* as *\"possession, direct or indirect, of the power to direct or cause the direction of the management and policies of a corporation.*\"359 Applying this definition to the present case, the Respondent submits that the Claimants would have had to prove that Arin US has the power to direct or cause the direction of the management of the real estate located at the [REDACTED] Properties (under both the alleged original and restructured investment).360 The Claimants did not provide any evidence of such power. As Arin US was neither a party to, nor otherwise involved in, the Shareholders Agreement and the transfer of the real estate to the share capital of Arin Armenia,361 there is no indication of any control in the sense of Section 160 of the Corporations Code of the State of California. The fact that Mr. Khudyan is the majority shareholder of both Arin US and Arin Armenia does not vest Arin US with any legal right to exercise power over Arin Armenia.362\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial, Section E.III.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6160-162, referring to the BIT (Legal Authorities CL-0081 / RL-0037), p. 3; *AdT v.

United Republic of Tanzania, ICSID Case No. ARB/10/12, Award, November 2, 2012 *(\"**Standard Chartered v.

Bolivia.*363 As there is no intermediary over which Arin US has direct control, and which controls the immovable property located at [REDACTED] no indirect control can be established.364\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6189-190; *AdT v.

The Claimants\u2019 Position***\n--------------------------------\n\n331.\n\nIt is the Claimants' case that both Mr. Khudyan and Arin US have standing to pursue the claims. With respect to Arin US, the Claimants assert on the basis of Article I(1)(a) of the BIT, which defines an investment as \"*controlled directly or indirectly by nationals or companies of the other Party\",* that Arin US is an American company that indirectly controls, through its officer, Mr. Khudyan, the immovable property [REDACTED], and Arin Armenia. According to the Claimants, such indirect control is borne out by the following facts:\n\n- Arin US authorized Mr. Khudyan\u2019s investment and granted him all the necessary powers to purchase the properties located [REDACTED], using funds from Arin US\u2019s bank account;\n\n- Arin US incurred risk in relation to the investment, [REDACTED];\n\n- Arin US benefited from the investment, as is proven by the company\u2019s tax returns, which record income paid to Mr. Khudyan under preliminary sale-purchase agreements for the apartments [REDACTED]; and\n\n- Arin US routinely transferred funds to Arin Armenia, either directly or through Mr. Khudyan\u2019s accounts, to finance the construction of the building and to pay the company\u2019s debts.365\n\nClaimants\u2019 Reply, \u00b6\u00b660-61.\n\n332.\n\nBy reference to the decision in *S.D. Myers v. Canada,* the Claimants submit that it is recognized that a closely-held corporation can indirectly control an investment abroad through its chief officer.366 In that case, the CEO and majority shareholder of claimant (SDMI), Mr. Dana Myers, owned 25% of Myers Canada. The tribunal decided that in his capacity of CEO of SDMI Mr. Myers made decisions regarding the business of Myers Canada and was its \"*authoritative voice*,\" which was subsequently confirmed by the Canadian courts, which refused to set the award aside.367 In respect of Prof. Douglas\u2019 criticism of the fact-based approach of the Canadian courts in establishing control, the Claimants point out that the *S.D. Myers* tribunal and the Canadian courts implicitly applied the legal test for control of the US principles of agency law.368 On that basis, the Claimants submit that the Tribunal should reject the Respondent\u2019s jurisdictional objection based on Arin US\u2019s alleged lack of control over the investment.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Reply, \u00b6\u00b663-65, citing, *inter alia,* *SD Myers v.

The Claimants submit that the parties to the BIT adopted a definition of investment that is *\"granular, expansive, and* [which] *already contains safeguards to exclude simple commercial transactions,\"* and that it would be inappropriate to read further restrictions into the definition beyond the ones that the parties explicitly chose.371\n\nClaimants\u2019 Reply, Section I(C)(1).\n\nClaimants\u2019 Reply, \u00b671.\n\n335.\n\nThe Claimants note that many tribunals simply apply the definition of \"*investment*\" as written in the relevant treaty, without inferring any additional requirements, and point out that several tribunals explicitly rejected attempts of respondent States to introduce additional substantive requirements.372 The Claimants dismiss the Respondent\u2019s reliance on cases where tribunals found that inherent to the term \"investment\" were additional requirements beyond the wording of the definition as inapposite, because they are fact-specific and the investment at issue in those cases did not bear any resemblance to the Claimants' investments in Armenia.373\n\nClaimants\u2019 Reply, \u00b672, citing *Mytilineos Holdings SA v.

Morocco* tribunal and the Tribunal should not condition the recognition of a protected investment on requirements beyond those set forth Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention.374 The Claimants argue that the only authorities cited by the Respondent for the *Salini* test (Prof. Schreuer's Commentary and the decision in *Malaysian Historical Salvors v. Malaysia*) actually do not support the Respondent's case. According to the Claimants, Prof. Schreuer clearly rejected the notion that the term *\"investment\"* in Article 25(1) imposes additional jurisdictional requirements, while the award of the tribunal in *Malaysian Historical Salvors* was annulled because of its application of the *Salini* criteria and its refusal to exercise jurisdiction.375 The Claimants argue that the *Malaysian Historical Salvors ad hoc* committee considered the proper interpretation of Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention by reference to the *travaux preparatoires*, and concluded that the only limitation imposed by Article 25(1) is the simple cross-border sales of goods, in respect of which ICSID jurisdiction cannot be exercised.376\n\nClaimants\u2019 Reply, \u00b675.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Reply, \u00b6\u00b676-77, citing Schreuer Commentary (Legal Authorities CL-0080 / RL-030, 172; *Malaysian Historical Salvors, Sdn, Bhd v.

As a result, the Claimants submit, there is no need for the Tribunal to look beyond the definition of investment contained in the BIT.379\n\nClaimants\u2019 Reply, \u00b678.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Reply, \u00b6\u00b678-79.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Reply, \u00b679.\n\n338.\n\nIn response to the Respondent\u2019s assertion that the alleged investment was a purely commercial transaction, the Claimants insist that their venture did not concern a one-off purchase of land, but rather a development project, involving the establishment of a local company and a construction project with the goal of selling apartments for profit,380 which squarely falls under the ordinary meaning of the term investment in Article I(1)(a) of the BIT and Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention.381\n\nClaimants\u2019 Reply, \u00b669.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Reply, \u00b6\u00b669-70.\n\n339.\n\nIn any event, the Claimants argue that their investment satisfies all of the additional requirements invoked by the Respondent.\n\n340.\n\nFirst, the Claimants contend that there has been a contribution of money and assets. More specifically, Mr. Khudyan spent substantial sums of money to purchase the land plots [REDACTED] and to contribute towards the construction of the buildings.382 To substantiate that allegation the Claimants refer to the detailed breakdown of the investment provided by Mr. Khudyan in the context of the Criminal Investigation in Armenia and the Respondent\u2019s indictment report,383 which reveal the following contributions.\n\n- [REDACTED]\n\nClaimants\u2019 Reply, \u00b681.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Reply, \u00b681; Claimants\u2019 PHB, \u00b6\u00b62-3; City of Yerevan, Decision on Evidence, December 14, 2015 (Exhibit C-0304); 2015 Khudyan Interrogation Report (Exhibit C-0302); Indictment Report (Exhibit C-0121); Wire Transfer Receipt, [REDACTED] (Exhibits C-0179 / R-0183); Summary of Cash Assets of Mr. Edmond Khudyan, December 11, 2015 (Exhibit C-0303); Arin US Bank Statement, [REDACTED] (Exhibit C-0184); Motion to Admit Evidence from Mr. Edmond Khudyan, May 8, 2016 (Exhibit C-0119).\n\n341.\n\nMoreover, the Claimants deny that they would not have created any value. Thanks to the Claimants\u2019 investments, there is now a luxury real estate development at a location [REDACTED] that was until a few years ago vacant and semi-vacant land.387\n\nClaimants\u2019 Reply, \u00b682.\n\n342.\n\nSecond, the Claimants submit that their investment entailed risk, as they obtained financing [REDACTED], which they needed to repay, if necessary, by selling their assets in the US. The Claimants contend that Arin Armenia, of which Mr. Khudyan was the majority shareholder, took out a [REDACTED] to finance the construction project. In addition, Mr. Khudyan spent substantial sums over the following years, when the venture was exposed to a variety of risks, including potential decrease of real estate market prices, and *\"special risks involved with operating in Armenia, including being exposed to harmful action and inaction by the Armenian Government*.\"388\n\nClaimants\u2019 Reply, \u00b683.\n\n343.\n\nThe Claimants reject the Respondent\u2019s reliance on the *Romak v. Uzbekistan* decision for the proposition that the *\"potential default by [a] contractual partner\"* constitutes a commercial rather than an investment risk. They argue that the nature of the contract in *Romak* was very different from the Claimants\u2019 investments, as it concerned a one-off cross-border sale of wheat, whereas in this case the Claimants were involved in a real estate development with the objective of selling apartments for profit.389\n\nClaimants\u2019 Reply, \u00b6\u00b684-85.\n\n344.\n\nThe fact that their return may have been defined in the Shareholders Agreement, according to the Claimants, does not change the fact that the return was never guaranteed, but rather contingent on the successful completion of the real estate development and the sale of apartments. Moreover, the Claimants note that the BIT specifically includes \"*debt*\" as a protected investment and argue that, although in a debt instrument the amount to be repaid is always fixed, no one would claim that debt instruments bear no risk.390\n\nClaimants\u2019 Reply, \u00b686.\n\n345.\n\nThe Claimants deny that Mr. Khudyan would have known the exact amount he would end up spending and criticize the Respondent for the analogy it seeks to draw with the *Romak* case, which concerned a single sale of wheat and where the risk was limited to the value of the wheat delivered, while the present case involves a development project, in which the construction costs were uncertain and were to be borne by Arin Armenia, which was in turn supported by its shareholders.391\n\nClaimants\u2019 Reply, \u00b687.\n\n346.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, their risk was not limited to the contractual defaults of their local partners. In fact, the Claimants suffered from actual criminal acts by their local partner, against which Armenia failed to protect the Claimants, which leads the Claimants to conclude that to the extent that Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention requires an investment to involve an element of risk, that requirement was evidently satisfied.392\n\nClaimants\u2019 Reply, \u00b6\u00b688-89.\n\n347.\n\nThird, with respect to the duration criterion, the Claimants submit that their investments started [REDACTED] at the latest, when Mr. Khudyan incorporated Arin Armenia, and continued until [REDACTED], when the last of Arin Armenia's assets were transferred from the company.393 The Claimants allege that an investment over a seven-year period constitutes a reasonable duration by any standard. The Claimants reject the Respondent's argument that the relevant time period for assessing the duration of the Claimants' investments is the duration of the performance of the Claimants' contractual obligations because that would ignore the difference in nature between the *Salini* investment, which concerned a construction contract under which the investor would construct infrastructure in the host State in exchange for payment, and the present case, where Mr. Khudyan was not the construction contractor, but the indirect owner of the building being constructed.394 Therefore, the Claimants submit, the relevant duration is the period of time during which Mr. Khudyan owned the immovable property and the shares in Arin Armenia.395\n\nClaimants\u2019 Reply, \u00b690.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Reply, \u00b691, citing, *inter alia,* *Salini v. Morocco* (Legal Authority RL-0038), \u00b645, 52, 54.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Reply, \u00b691.\n\n348.\n\nFinally, with respect to the purported requirement of contribution to the economic development of the host State, the Claimants argue that throughout the 2000s and especially in 2007, Armenia\u2019s economy was propelled in important part by a boom in residential construction, driven by investments from members of the Armenian diaspora like Mr. Khudyan. It is the Claimants\u2019 case that their investment contributed to this boom.396 In this context, the Claimants argue that the Respondent\u2019s suggestion that only large infrastructure projects qualify for ICSID protection is not serious, and that there is no basis in either the BIT or the ICSID Convention to exclude investments based on their scale or the amounts invested.397\n\nClaimants\u2019 Reply, \u00b692.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Reply, \u00b693.\n\n349.\n\nThe Claimants further deny the Respondent\u2019s allegation that they would have withdrawn capital from Armenia by reaping profits from the sale proceeds of apartment units that were yet to be built and insist that it is normal for foreign investors to invest with the expectation of earning a profit, as is borne out by Article IV(1)(a) of the BIT that specifically articulates the investor\u2019s right to withdraw returns on an investment from the host State.398\n\nClaimants\u2019 Reply, \u00b6\u00b694-95.\n\n350.\n\nOn that basis, the Claimants conclude that their investment also satisfies each of the additional *Salini* criteria, invoked by the Respondent.\n\n**(3) The Tribunal\u2019s Analysis**\n-------------------------------\n\n351.\n\nThe Tribunal will ascertain its jurisdiction *ratione materiae* by determining whether each of the Claimants owned or controlled an investment within the meaning of Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention and Article 1(a) of the BIT that was protected by the BIT. It undertakes this analysis notwithstanding its previous finding that it cannot exercise jurisdiction over Mr. Khudyan because a comprehensive assessment of the alleged investments is necessary in order to determine whether Arin US distinctly made qualifying investments under the BIT and the ICSID Convention.\n\n352.\n\nArticle 25(1) of the ICSID Convention provides as follows:\n\n*(1) The jurisdiction of the Centre shall extend to any legal dispute arising directly out of an investment, between a Contracting State (or any constituent subdivision or agency of a Contracting State designated to the Centre by that State) and a national of another Contracting State, which the parties to the dispute consent in writing to submit to the Centre. When the parties have given their consent, no party may withdraw the consent unilaterally.*\n\n353.\n\nArticle I(1)(a) of the BIT provides as follows:\n\n*(a) \"investment\" means every kind of investment in the territory of one Party owned or controlled directly or indirectly by nationals or companies of the other Party, such as equity, debt, and service and investment contracts; and includes:*\n\n*(i) tangible and intangible property, including movable and immovable property, as well as rights, such as mortgages, liens and pledges;*\n\n*(ii) a company or shares of stock or other interests in a company or interests in the assets thereof*\n\n*(iii) a claim to money or a claim to performance having economic value, and associated with an investment;*\n\n*(iv) intellectual property which includes, inter alia, rights relating to: literary and artistic works, including sound recordings; inventions in all fields of human endeavor; industrial designs; semiconductor mask works; trade secrets, know-how, and confidential business information; and trademarks, service marks, and trade names; and*\n\n*(v) any right conferred by law or contract, and any licenses and permits pursuant to law* [\u2026]399\n\nBIT (Legal Authorities CL-0081 / RL-0037), Article I(1)(a).\n\n354.\n\nAs stated above, it is the Claimants\u2019 case that Mr. Khudyan\u2019s original investment consisted of his ownership of the immovable property [REDACTED], which he allegedly purchased with funds of Arin US, and that Arin US, in turn, indirectly controlled that investment through its CEO, Mr. Khudyan.

Nor is there any document in the record showing the terms of the agreement between Mr. Khudyan [REDACTED]. Further, there are discrepancies between the Claimants' pleaded case and the limited contemporaneous documentation on the record in respect of each of these essential elements.\n\n358.\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n359.\n\n[REDACTED] Although there are other indications in the record that there may have been a change in the address of one of the plots at issue,410 this was not clearly pleaded by the Claimants, and the discrepancy in the surface of the land plot remains.\n\nCertificate of Registration for Ownership (Use) of Immovable Property, [REDACTED] (Exhibit C-0198) issued to Arin US for a *Multifunctional building* [REDACTED] Expertise Report (Exhibit C-0295), pp. 128-129 [REDACTED]; Tr., Day 3, 693:1-7 [REDACTED]\n\n360.\n\nSecond, in respect of the seller, the Claimants failed to identify in their written submissions the seller from whom [REDACTED] would initially have been bought. [REDACTED]\n\n361.\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n362.\n\nThird, the Claimants' case on the price paid for the initial acquisition [REDACTED] evolved.

While the Claimants alleged at certain times that the loan was repaid with interest, they never indicated the amount of interest that was paid.415 [REDACTED] During his examination at the hearing, Mr. Khudyan acknowledged that the investment must have been [REDACTED] yet the Claimants maintained in their post-hearing brief that it was for [REDACTED]417\n\nClaimants\u2019 PHB, \u00b63, fn 14.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Memorial, \u00b618; [REDACTED] First Witness Statement, \u00b67.\n\nTr., Day 2, 365:11-25.\n\n363.\n\nThe only contemporaneous evidence on the record concerning the payment of the purchase price for the alleged initial investment in [REDACTED] Property is an outgoing wire transfer request of [REDACTED], [REDACTED]418\n\n364.\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n365.\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n366.\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n367.\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n368.\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n369.\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n370.\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n371.\n\nAccordingly, on the limited and contradictory evidence before it, the Tribunal is unable to conclude, as the Claimants ask it to do, that Mr. Khudyan acquired the [REDACTED] and that Arin US funded that acquisition.\n\n*(ii) The transfer of the [REDACTED]*\n-------------------------------------\n\n372.\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n373.\n\nFor this transaction also, the Claimants did not provide any contemporaneous transaction document or other agreement.

Analysis of jurisdiction ratione materiae***\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n416.\n\nWith respect to Mr. Khudyan, the Tribunal has assessed the evidence pertaining to Mr. Khudyan\u2019s alleged investments in Armenia in considerable detail and has concluded that, on the basis of the series of transactions described above, Mr. Khudyan acquired a [REDACTED] shareholding in Arin Armenia, which in turn, held the legal title to the [REDACTED] Properties. The Tribunal has reached different conclusions with respect to other alleged investments. As per the Tribunal\u2019s findings at paragraphs 203 to 266 above, however, it does not have jurisdiction *ratione personae* over Mr. Khudyan. Thus, even if the Claimants had been able to convince the Tribunal that Mr. Khudyan made other investments in **Armenia**, this ultimately would not have assisted the Claimants in view of the Tribunal\u2019s conclusion that it has no jurisdiction over Mr. Khudyan.\n\n417.\n\nThe Tribunal now turns to the question whether Arin US has any protected investment, as it alleges. The Tribunal noted that Arin US acknowledges that it does not have any direct ownership or control over any of the assets acquired and indeed the record provides no indication to that effect. It is the Claimants\u2019 case that Arin US has:492\n\n(1) indirect control - [REDACTED] over the company Arin Armenia and (via Arin Armenia) the immovable property at [REDACTED];493\n\n(2) indirect control over the immovable property [REDACTED] through \"*its funding of Mr. Khudyan\u2019s purchase of the property*\";494and\n\n(3) an entitlement to receivables owed by Arin Armenia in connection with the amount [REDACTED] provided by Arin US for the development of the immovable property [REDACTED]495\n\nClaimants\u2019 Memorial, \u00b6150, fn 208; Claimants\u2019 Reply \u00b6\u00b661-62 (although presented under the heading of jurisdiction *ratione personae,* the Tribunal will consider these arguments too in the context of jurisdiction *ratione materiae);* Claimants\u2019 PHB, \u00b63.\n\nRequest for Arbitration, \u00b660; Claimants\u2019 Memorial, \u00b6150, fn 208; Claimants\u2019 Reply \u00b661.\n\nRequest for Arbitration, \u00b660; Claimants\u2019 Memorial, \u00b6150, fn 208.\n\nRequest for Arbitration, \u00b660.\n\n418.\n\nThe Tribunal now addresses these points.\n\n419.\n\nFirst, it is the Claimants\u2019 case that although Mr. Khudyan held [REDACTED] Properties, as well as the shares in Arin Armenia, in his own name, he did so \"*in his capacity as Chief Executive Officer of Arin* [US].\"496 However, the Tribunal notes that there is no contemporaneous evidence on the record to support that contention. There is no evidence on the record establishing that Mr. Khudyan did not acquire the relevant assets on a personal basis, but in his capacity as CEO of Arin US. None of the sale and purchase agreements on record refers to Mr. Khudyan acting in his capacity of CEO of Arin US, or to Arin US in general for that matter. Nor does the contemporaneous documentary record provide any indication that the assets were acquired with funds of Arin US. The evidence only shows that the legal title to the relevant assets remained at all relevant times with Mr. Khudyan, in his own right.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Reply, \u00b662.\n\n420.\n\nThe Tribunal notes again in this respect that the fact that Arin US declared [REDACTED] 0 worth of properties in Armenia in its Income Tax Return [REDACTED] does not advance the Claimants' case. It merely contradicts their pleaded case [REDACTED]\n\n421.\n\nAccordingly, the Tribunal finds that the Claimants have failed to discharge their burden of proof in relation to the factual allegation that Mr. Khudyan acquired the assets in his capacity as CEO of Arin US.\n\n422.\n\nSecond, the Tribunal also is not persuaded that Arin US indirectly controls Arin Armenia via Arin US's CEO Mr. Khudyan and, as a result, indirectly controlled the immovable property [REDACTED].\n\n423.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that:\n\n- Mr. Khudyan is the sole shareholder and owner of Arin US;\n\n- [REDACTED] Mr. Khudyan was the sole owner [REDACTED] shareholding in Arin Armenia; and\n\n- As of [REDACTED] Arin Armenia alone held the legal title to the [REDACTED] Properties in respect of which Arin US is seeking legal protection.\n\n424.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the Claimants do not argue that Arin US at any point in time owned any of the real estate or shares in Arin Armenia. Rather, the Claimants contend that Arin US had indirect control over the investment through its *\"officer,\"* Mr. Khudyan, relying on the decision of the tribunal in *S.D. Myers v. Canada* to establish control.\n\n425.\n\nThe Respondent challenges the authority of the *S.D. Myers* decision because the tribunal in that case failed to perform any real legal analysis to establish control. The Respondent insists that control can only be established if the purported investor has a legal right by means of which it can influence the business decisions regarding the purported investment.\n\n426.\n\nUnlike the tribunal in *S.D. Myers v. Canada,* which found on general policy grounds that SDMI, through its CEO (Mr. Meyers), was the *\"authoritative voice\"* of Meyers Canada and therefore accepted that SDMI controlled Meyers Canada, this Tribunal is of the view that the question as to whether an investor has direct or indirect control must first and foremost be assessed on the basis of the law governing the corporate entity that is alleged to be controlled, which, in this case, is Armenian law for Arin Armenia.\n\n427.\n\nAlthough the Claimants allege that Arin US controls [REDACTED] in Arin Armenia [REDACTED] they did not make any submissions to establish the alleged control over Arin Armenia by reference to the applicable Armenian corporate law.\n\n428.\n\nIn addition, the Tribunal considers that there also is no evidence of any legal powers that Arin US would have over Arin Armenia. Arin US holds no legal right or corporate position through which it can exercise control over any of the assets that Mr. Khudyan personally owns directly [REDACTED] indirectly [REDACTED]. It is Mr. Khudyan who controls Arin US, not *vice versa.*\n\n429.\n\nFurther, even if control could be exercised in fact without any legal entitlement to direct the company\u2019s affairs, which the Claimants have not shown, such control would not be established here as the Claimants have adduced no evidence showing that Arin US in fact exercised control over Arin Armenia. The only person who exercised control was Mr. Khudyan, and the Claimants have not shown that he did so in his capacity as CEO of Arin US.\n\n430.\n\nThird, the Claimants seek to establish indirect control through \"*its funding of Mr. Khudyan\u2019s purchase of the property,\"* relying on *Standard Chartered v. Tanzania.*499 However, that submission does not advance the Claimants\u2019 case either because unlike the claimant in the *Standard Chartered* case, Arin US never held any equity in Arin Armenia. As a result, the question as to whether mere ownership is sufficient, does not even arise.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Memorial, \u00b6150, fn 208.\n\n431.\n\nFourth and finally, Arin US claims to be entitled to receivables owed by Arin Armenia in connection with an amount [REDACTED] allegedly provided by Arin US for the development of [REDACTED] Properties. While the Tribunal recognizes that pursuant to Article 2 of the Shareholders Agreement, which Mr. Khudyan in his personal capacity made [REDACTED], he is entitled to \"*the value estimated at the time of the share investment from the company and the other Parties* [REDACTED],\"500 the Tribunal finds that there is no evidence that Arin US would have any right of its own to receivables in the amount [REDACTED] allegedly owed by Arin Armenia.501\n\nShareholders Agreement (Exhibit C-0025), Article 2.\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n432.\n\nIn view of the facts that:\n\n- Arin US does not own or control any of the shares in Arin Armenia, either directly or indirectly.\n\n- Arin US does not own or control [REDACTED] Properties, either directly or indirectly. and\n\n- Arin US has not established any entitlement to receivables from Arin Armenia in the amount [REDACTED]; the Tribunal concludes that Arin US did not own or control any asset akin to those listed in Article I(1) of the BIT and therefore did not have a qualifying investment that is protected under Article I(1) of the BIT and Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention.\n\n433.\n\nIn conclusion, for the reasons set out above, Arin US's claims are dismissed for lack of jurisdiction *ratione materiae* because it has failed to establish that it had any direct or indirect ownership of, or control over, any of the assets that are alleged to comprise its investment. Arin US simply holds no rights or entitlements over any assets in Armenia that could qualify as investments under the ICSID Convention and the BIT. Therefore, the Tribunal declines jurisdiction over Arin US's claims.\n\n434.\n\nIn view of this finding, and also in view of the Tribunal's lack of jurisdiction *ratione personae* over Mr. Khudyan, the Tribunal can dispense with the examination of the remaining objections *ratione materiae* to the Tribunal's jurisdiction that were raised by Armenia (including the objections to the effect that the Claimants have not made a lawful investment), as a determination thereof would not change the outcome of this arbitration.\n\n**VI.

The Tribunal\u2019s Decision on Costs**\n---------------------------------------\n\n446.\n\nArticle 61(2) of the ICSID Convention provides:\n\n*In the case of arbitration proceedings the Tribunal shall, except as the parties otherwise agree, assess the expenses incurred by the parties in connection with the proceedings, and shall decide how and by whom those expenses, the fees and expenses of the members of the Tribunal and the charges for the use of the facilities of the Centre shall be paid. Such decision shall form part of the award.*\n\n447.\n\nThis provision gives the Tribunal discretion to allocate all costs of the arbitration, including attorney\u2019s fees and other costs, between the Parties as it deems appropriate.\n\n448.\n\nHaving failed to establish jurisdiction, the Claimants have lost this arbitration. Accordingly, the Tribunal finds that the Claimants must bear the arbitration costs in full, and make a contribution towards the legal fees and other expenses that the Respondent has incurred to defend itself against their claims in this arbitration. Considering the amount of legal fees and other expenses incurred by the Respondent and the fact that the Claimants, who lost the arbitration, spent almost double on legal fees and other expenses compared to the Respondent, the Tribunal accepts that the Respondent's legal fees and other expenses have been reasonably incurred. The Tribunal considers it appropriate to award only a portion of the Respondent's legal fees and other expenses because its decision to change counsel just before the Rejoinder was due inevitably led to a degree of duplication of costs and resulted in a different emphasis in the Respondent's pleaded case. In the circumstances of this case, the Tribunal finds it reasonable that the Claimants contribute USD 400,000 towards the Respondent's legal fees and expenses. The Respondent's claim for interest on legal fees and expenses is unsubstantiated in that it failed to indicate the legal basis for its claim, the applicable interest rate and the period over which interest is claimed. Therefore, the Tribunal does not award the Respondent's claim for interest.\n\n449.\n\nThe costs of the arbitration, including the fees and expenses of the Tribunal, ICSID's administrative fees and direct expenses, amount to (in USD):\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Arbitrators' fees and expenses |  |\n| Melanie Van Leeuwen | 229,925.57 |\n| Ank Santens | 85,715.97 |\n| Zachary Douglas | 83,640.59 |\n| ICSID's administrative fees | 210,000.00 |\n| Direct expenses | 65,650.54 |\n| **Total** | **674,932.67** |\n\n450.\n\nThe above costs have been paid out of the advances made by the Parties in equal parts.520 As a result, each Party's share of the costs of arbitration amounts to USD 337,466.34.\n\nThe remaining balance will be reimbursed to the parties in proportion to the payments that they advanced to ICSID.\n\n451.\n\nAccordingly, the Tribunal orders the Claimants to pay to the Respondent USD 337,466.34 for the expended portion of the Respondent's advances to ICSID and USD 400,000 to cover a reasonable proportion of the Respondent\u2019s legal fees and expenses.\n\n**VII. decision**\n-----------------\n\n452.\n\nFor the reasons set forth above, the Tribunal:\n\n(1) Finds that it lacks jurisdiction *ratione personae* over the first Claimant, Mr. Edmond Khudyan;\n\n(2) FINDS that it has jurisdiction *ratione personae* over the second Claimant, Arin Capital & Investment Corp;\n\n(3) Finds that it lacks jurisdiction *ratione materiae* over the alleged investments of the second Claimant, Arin Capital & Investment Corp;\n\n(4) Dismisses the Claimants\u2019 claims for lack of jurisdiction; and\n\n(5) Orders the Claimants to pay the Respondent the sum of USD 337,466.34 for the expended portion of the Respondent\u2019s advances to ICSID and USD 400,000 towards the Respondent\u2019s legal fees and expenses.\n\n(6) DENIES all other requests for relief.\n\nDate: December 10, 2021"}]}
