Respondent alleges that its RfB meets the criteria for granting bifurcation, based on three arguments1:\n\n1) Bifurcation will reduce the number of issues to be considered in the quantum phase2; the Republic of Belarus is confident that it has a strong case on both jurisdiction and liability and believes that its objections will dispose of the claim3; even if the Tribunal does not dismiss the claim at the first stage, the Tribunal's decision on liability will significantly narrow the scope of the issues to be addressed at the quantum stage4;\n\n2) The facts and issues relevant to jurisdiction and liability are distinct from the facts and issues relevant to the quantum proceedings5; thus, there would be a benefit in having the Tribunal's findings of fact before instructing the experts6;\n\n3) Bifurcation will foster fairness, economy and efficiency in managing these proceedings7; the quantification of Claimant's damages claims will be a complex and time consuming exercise, thus Respondent would be prejudiced if it had to invest substantial time and resources into quantifying claims that may fall away at the jurisdiction and liability phase8.\n\nRfB, paras. 9, 86.\n\nRfB, paras. 62-76.\n\nRfB, paras. 59, 62-67\n\nRfB, paras. 59, 68-74.\n\nRfB, paras. 77-80.\n\nRfB, para. 23.\n\nRfB, paras. 81-85.\n\nRfB, paras. 81, 85.\n\n2.\n\nClaimant submitted its Observations on the Application for Bifurcation on Quantum [the \"**Answer**\"] on June 25, 2018. Claimant opposes bifurcation and demands that the quantum be heard together with the merits of the dispute9 because:\n\n- Bifurcation will cause undue delay and additional cost to the Parties10; and\n\n- The quantification of damages in this arbitration is not complicated and the record is not as voluminous as to warrant a bifurcation of the proceedings on quantum11.\n\nAnswer, para. 14.\n\nAnswer, paras. 15-18.\n\nAnswer, para. 13.\n\n3.\n\nThe procedural calendar allocates one month after Claimant's Answer for the Tribunal to issue a decision on bifurcation. On July 24, 2018, the Tribunal sent a letter to the Parties informing them that deliberations were still ongoing and that it would issue a decision in the course of the following week12. Therefore, this decision is rendered within the time period announced in communication A8.\n\nCommunication A8.\n\n4.\n\nThe Tribunal has carefully examined the Parties' arguments and, on balance, sees advantages in not bifurcating the proceedings:\n\n5.\n\nThe Tribunal acknowledges that, if the dispute were to be bifurcated, Respondent would in the first phase avoid the need for an expert report; and that if Respondent were successful on jurisdiction or merits, no expert report would ever be required. But this advantage is off-set by the contrary scenario: if the Tribunal were to grant bifurcation and then find for Claimant on jurisdiction and merits (even if partially), the procedure would continue into a second phase, devoted exclusively to the calculation of damages. Such second phase would cause unnecessary delay and unwarranted increase in costs.\n\n6.\n\nThe Tribunal is also not convinced by Respondent's argument that the facts and issues relevant to jurisdiction and liability are distinct from the facts and issues relevant to the quantum proceedings; as the case has been pleaded, the Tribunal sees a close relationship between both sets of facts and issues.\n\n7.\n\nRespondent also asserts that bifurcation will foster fairness, economy and efficiency in managing these proceedings, the quantification of Claimant's damages claims being a complex and time-consuming exercise. The Tribunal is unpersuaded: the expert report submitted by Claimant is not overly complex, and is based on straightforward methodology for the calculation of damages and lost profits.\n\n8.\n\nFor the above reasons, and considering the principles of procedural economy and cost efficiency, the Tribunal decides not to bifurcate the proceedings.\n\n9.\n\nConsequently, the procedural calendar established in Timetable B.1 will be followed, adding one week to each Parties' deadline to submit their main pleadings, in order to compensate for the Tribunal's delay in rendering this decision.

Tax Evasion Investigation**\n--------------------------------\n\n19.\n\nIn March 2017, eight months prior to Claimant sending the Notice of Arbitration, the Inspectorate of the Ministry of Taxes and Levies of the Republic of Belarus for the Minsk Region conducted a tax audit of Manolium-Engineering8. The audit was published on March 24, 2017 and found that Manolium-Engineering owed 11,826,511.43 Belarusian rubles in unpaid taxes and 2,698,691.64 in fines9.\n\nDoc. C-186.\n\nDoc. C-186, p. 8.\n\n20.\n\nOn 15 June 2017, the tax inspector - in accordance with the requirement under Belarusian law10 - notified the Department for Financial Investigations of the Belarus State Control Committee **[\"Department for Financial Investigations\"]** about Manoliun-Engineering\u2019s non-payment of tax, identifying the names and positions of the individuals whose actions or failure to act may have caused the non-payment of tax11. The letter identified Manolium-Engineering\u2019s Directors, Mr. Andrey Dolgov and Mr. Aram Ekavyan, the Director of Manolium-Processing (which is the owner of Manolium-Engineering), who are both residents of Russia12.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Response, fn. 5.\n\nDoc.

Insolvency Proceeding**\n----------------------------\n\n29.\n\nClaimant and Mr. Dolgov jointly own Belarusian Foreign Enterprise Manolium-Processing **[\"BMP\"],** a separate legal entity for which Mr. Dolgov was the general director between 2002 and June 201625.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Observations, paras. 8-9.\n\n30.\n\nIn November 2016, a voluntary liquidation procedure was commenced for BMP by Claimant, Mr Dolgov, and other shareholders26. However, on 3 March 2017, a private third-party creditor submitted an application to the Economic Court of the City of Minsk [the **\"Court\"]** seeking to commence insolvency proceedings in relation to BMP27, putting the voluntary liquidation procedure on hold.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Observations, para. 10.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Observations, para. 10.\n\n31.\n\nOn 14 April 2017, the Court granted the creditor\u2019s application, ordering the liquidation procedure to be replaced by insolvency proceedings, and appointed an insolvency administrator **[\"Insolvency Proceeding\"]28.**\n\nRespondent\u2019s Observations, para. 10.\n\n32.\n\nOn 19 February 2018, an expert was appointed by the Court to examine the circumstances of BMP\u2019s insolvency29, in order to assist the administrator in ascertaining whether insolvency was deliberately caused by the officers of the entity, a determination required under Belarusian insolvency law30. In July 2018, the expert report was submitted to the Court and a hearing was held on 7 August 201831. The expert found that the management bodies of BMP had knowingly and deliberately entered into transactions on disadvantageous terms causing detriment to the company\u2019s solvency and economic position32. The expert appeared to have found evidence that the insolvency was intentional, obstructing the ability for creditors to recover losses33.\n\nDoc.

R-10, p. 2.\n\n33.\n\nDining the hearing the Court directed the insolvency administrator to34:\n\n\"... send the case files to the Minsk Prosecutor's Office to arrange for the consideration of whether there are indications of false insolvency, deliberate insolvency, concealment of insolvency or obstruction of recovery of the creditors' losses, subject to informing the court of the decision taken: based on the results of the liquidation procedure, submit to the economic court by 21 December 2018 a report complying with the requirements of Article 149 of the Law of the Republic of Belarus \"On Economic Insolvency (Bankruptcy)\".\n\nDoc. R-10, p. 3.\n\n34.\n\nOn 30 August 2018 the Administrator sent materials from the insolvency case file to the Minsk Prosecutor\u2019s Office35. On 7 September 2018 the Minsk Prosecutor\u2019s Office sent the files to the Department of Financial Investigations, which on 11 September 2018 transmitted the files to the relevant territorial office to commence the investigation36.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Observations, para. 15.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Observations, paras. 15-16.\n\n35.\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n**C. Mr. Koroban\u2019s Interview**\n------------------------------\n\n36.\n\nMr. Vikentiy Koroban is the former Deputy Director of Manolium-Engineering. He provided RWS-1 which was marshalled by Belarus with its Response.\n\n37.\n\nIn July 2018, Mr. Koroban was interviewed at the Minsk City Executive Committee **[\"MCEC\"]** by representatives of Respondent\u2019s counsel, as part of the Respondent\u2019s preparation of its Statement of Defence in the present arbitration42.\n\nWS V. Koroban, RWS-1, para. 8.\n\n38.\n\nSubsequently, Mr. Koroban had a telephone conversation with Mr. Leonid Torot\u2019ko, who he used to work with at Manolium-Engineering, and discussed the meeting at the MCEC43. The Parties and the witnesses disagree on the content of that conversation: in particular, how the interview at the MCEC came about **(a.),** and whether Mr. Koroban\u2019s actions indicate a fearfulness of repercussions within Belarus **(b.).**\n\nWS V. Koroban, RWS-1, para. 9; WS L. Torot\u2019ko, CWS-3, para. 15.\n\n**a. The interview at the MCEC**\n--------------------------------\n\n(i) Mr. Torot\u2019ko\u2019s version of events\n------------------------------------\n\n39.\n\nMr. Torot\u2019ko is a former colonel in the Belarusian Ministry of Internal Affairs and has previously worked at Manolium-Engineering with Mr. Koroban: he is currently employed by Centrobeton. the director of which is Mr. Dolgov\u2019s son44.\n\nWS of L. Torot\u2019ko, CWS-3, paras. 10, 14.\n\n40.\n\nMr. Koroban told him that he was \"summoned\" to the MCEC and questioned about the circumstances of Claimant\u2019s investment project in Belarus, such as the legality of Manolium-Engineering\u2019s operations, the sufficiency of funds for investment under the Investment Contract, and whether Mr. Dolgov bribed Belarusian government officials45.\n\nWS of L. Torot\u2019ko, CWS-3, paras. 15, 18.\n\n(ii) Mr. Dolgov\u2019s recount\n-------------------------\n\n41.\n\nMr. Dolgov states that he was informed by colleagues of Manolium-Engineering that Mr. Koroban was summoned to the MCEC alongside representatives of a foreign law firm and asked questions related to Claimant\u2019s investment in Belarus46.\n\nWS of  A*.* Dolgov, CWS-2, para. 3.\n\n42.\n\nHowever, when he called Mr. Koroban in the presence of Claimant\u2019s Counsel, and asked that he tell him about the meeting at the MCEC, Mr. Koroban47:\n\n\"... informed me that actually, nobody had *\"summoned\"* him and that he had come to the MCEC for his own business and accidentally witnessed the discussion of the arbitration proceedings by the MCEC's representatives.\n\nIn addition, [he] stated that no representatives of an international law firm together with an interpreter were present at the MCEC and that nobody asked him about his work at Manolium-Engineering, the project related to the Investment Contract in Minsk and whether I had offered any bribes to representatives of the governmental authorities of the Republic of Belarus\".\n\nWS of A. Dolgov, CWS-4, paras. 10-12.\n\n43.\n\nMr. Dolgov\u2019s reaction was the following48:\n\n\"I was absolutely shocked by the fact that the man with whom I had worked for such a long time and who had been my deputy, offered me, quite unexpectedly, the version of events completely different from the version that he had offered to L. Torot\u2019ko\n\nWS of A. Dolgov, CWS-4, para. 13.\n\n44.\n\nOn the same day, 20 July 2018, Mr. Dolgov - quite upset by Mr. Koroban\u2019s recollection of the meeting - sent Mr. Koroban the following text message, in which he shows his disbelief49:\n\n\"Vikentiy Vaclavovich! Telling lies at your age is not a nice thing to do! This is what I think! I apologize!\"\n\nWS of A. Dolgov, CWS-4, para. 13.\n\n(iii) Mr. Koroban\u2019s version of the MCEC interview\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n45.\n\nMr. Koroban says he attended the MCEC voluntarily and without coercion, and discussed the circumstances of this arbitration50. He states that during a conversation with Mr. Torot\u2019ko, he mentioned that he51:\n\n\"... had been into the office of MCEC and overheard MCEC staff discussing the dispute relating to the Claimant. Contrary to what is suggested in the WS, I did not tell Mr Torotko or anyone else about meetings with foreign lawyers, let alone meetings in the presence of an interpreter. Nor did I say (nor could I have said) to Mr Torotko that I had been asked whether Mr Dolgov had bribed representatives of the Belarus state authorities\".\n\nWS of V. Koroban, RWS-1, para. 8.\n\nWS of V. Koroban, RWS-1, para. 10.\n\n46.\n\nFurther, Mr. Koroban states that when Mr. Dolgov asked him about the meeting at the MCEC, he answered that he52:\n\n\"... had not gone there, because I did not wish to discuss this topic with him\".\n\nWS of V. Koroban, RWS-1, para. 13.\n\n47.\n\nIn addition, Mr. Koroban says that Mr. Torot'ko said53:\n\n\"... it was a mistake for [Mr. Koroban] to have gone to MCEC, hinting that now Mr Dolgov and [Mr. Koroban] would face a threat of criminal prosecution. Mr Torotko said he would call Mr Dolgov about this\".\n\nWS of V. Koroban, RWS-1, para. 11.\n\n48.\n\nRegarding his safety, Mr. Koroban says54:\n\n\"Mr Dolgov asserts that I am concerned about my safety in the Republic of Belarus. This is not true. I am not worried for my safety. The only one who has ever told me about potential criminal prosecution was Mr Torotko, as I describe in paragraph 11 above\".\n\nWS of V. Koroban, RWS-1, para. 15.\n\n**b. Alleged coercion of Mr. Koroban**\n--------------------------------------\n\n49.\n\nMr. Dolgov asserts that the only explanation for Mr. Koroban's alleged contradictory behaviour is55:\n\n\"... that V. Koroban worries about his own safety in the Republic of Belarus and, for this reason, changes his testimony all the time\".\n\nWS of A. Dolgov, CWS-4, para. 14.\n\n50.\n\nMr. Torot'ko shares the same feeling56:\n\n\"I believe that such a behavior is very strange. It is quite possible that V. Koroban is afraid of something and, hence, does not know how to behave: at first, he called me and told me about the circumstances of his meeting at the MCEC, and then started to deny them. However, I remember everything he told me and everything I stated above very well\".\n\nWS of L. Torot'ko, CWS-3, para. 26.\n\n51.\n\nIn addition, Mr. Torot'ko denies hinting the possibility of criminal prosecution to Mr. Koroban, as alleged by Mr. Koroban57:\n\n\"I don't understand what V. Koroban had in mind when he said that I had hinted to him a threat of criminal prosecution. I haven't worked with government authorities for a long time and, therefore, could not have threatened him with a criminal prosecution even in theory.\n\nWe did discuss the possibility of a criminal liability but only in the context of the fact that Belarus sometimes initiates criminal cases against businessmen in order to exert pressure on them and, so long as V. Koroban was summoned to the MCEC, we may well expect that criminal case will be initiated against management of Manolium-Engineering\".\n\nWS of L. Torot'ko, CWS-3, paras. 22-23.\n\n**2. Claimant\u2019s Position**\n--------------------------\n\n52.\n\nClaimant avers that the requested interim measures fulfil the requirements under the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules of 2013 [\"**UNCITRAL Rules**\"], and are necessary to avoid harm to Claimant which could not be adequately repaired with an award of damages58.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Request, para. 30.\n\n53.\n\nClaimant avers that the following rights are under threat59:\n\n- Right to the procedural integrity of the overall proceedings;\n\n- Right to the non-aggravation of the dispute; and\n\n- The equality of the Parties in the proceeding.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Request, para. 31.\n\n54.\n\nClaimant avers that Respondent is attempting to take justice into its own hands by [REDACTED] key individuals involved in the investment project, aboutissues directly related to this dispute60. Claimant states that Respondent\u2019s [REDACTED] is intimidating Claimant\u2019s witnesses and former employees, putting the procedural integrity of this arbitration at threat61.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Request, paras. 34-35.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Request, para. 32.\n\n55.\n\nRespondent is circumventing the arbitral process by using its law enforcement agencies and domestic criminal procedures to search for harmful information about Claimant, which it intends to use as evidence in this arbitration62.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Request, para. 37.\n\n56.\n\nThis way of behaving is contrary to Respondent\u2019s obligations in this arbitration, as acknowledged in *Quiborax v. Bolivia,* where the tribunal found that the potential criminal proceedings against witnesses violated the integrity of the arbitral proceedings63.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Request, para. 36, citing *Quiborax S.A., Non Metallic Minerals S.A. and Allan Fosk Kaplun v. Plurinational State of Bolivia,* ICSID Case No. ARB/06/2. Decision on Provisional Measures of 26 February 2010, paras. 141-148 (Ex. CL-71).\n\n57.\n\nRespondent cannot be permitted to gain an unfair advantage in the arbitration by using its criminal powers [REDACTED]64.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Comments, paras. 16-17.\n\n58.\n\nClaimant supports its position with the following arguments: that [REDACTED] was likely motivated by an improper purpose (**A.**), that Mr. Koroban was coerced to testify for Respondent (**B.**), and that the Tribunal should look at Belarus\u2019 behaviour in past cases to establish a *modus operandi* (**C.**).\n\n**A. Improper**  [REDACTED] **of****key witnesses**\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n59.\n\nClaimant avers that the Belarusian authorities are considering initiating a criminal case in order to collect evidence outside of this arbitration and/or to pressure Claimant and its witnesses65.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Request, para. 13.\n\n60.\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n61.\n\nClaimant states that even after its Interim Measures Request, Respondent has  continued to use its police powers to intimidate witnesses70. [REDACTED]\n\nClaimant\u2019s Comments, para. 10.\n\n62.\n\nClaimant avers that this is strong evidence that Respondent is attempting to contact and intimidate Mr. Dolgov, by intimidating his family members, present and former colleagues and other affiliated persons76.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Comments, para. 15.\n\n63.\n\nClaimant additionally questions the motivation for Respondent\u2019s demand that Mr. Dolgov include his address in his witness statement, averring that this indicates that the Respondent is preparing some action against Mr. Dolgov outside of this arbitration77.\n\nClaimant's Request, para. 19.\n\n**B. Coercion of Mr. Koroban**\n------------------------------\n\n64.\n\nClaimant points to the questioning of Mr. Koroban, where he was allegedly asked if Mr. Dolgov bribed government officials, to suggest that Respondent is using its powers to collect evidence from Claimant\u2019s former employees outside of the arbitral process78.\n\nClaimant's Request, para. 17.\n\n65.\n\nAccording to Claimant, the facts of the meeting at the MCEC and Mr. Koroban\u2019s contradictory behaviour demonstrate witness coercion and an attempt to pressure and intimidate Mr. Koroban into silence79, and that Mr. Koroban\u2019s cooperation was done out of fear for his well-being; demonstrating the need for granting Claimant\u2019s Request80.\n\nClaimant's Request, para. 18.\n\nClaimant's Comments, para. 35. Claimant's Comments, para. 51. WS of L. Torot'ko, paras. 21-23, 26.\n\n66.\n\nClaimant additionally points to the following three inconsistent statements in Mr. Koroban\u2019s witness statement:\n\n67.\n\nFirst, Mr. Koroban states that he attended the MCEC voluntarily81:\n\n\"I voluntarily and without coercion came to the Minsk City Executive Committee (\"**MCEC**\") and discussed the circumstances relating to this arbitration\".\n\nWS of V. Koroban, RWS-1, para. 8.\n\n68.\n\nSecond, two paragraphs later he asserts that he was in the MCEC and overhead the MCEC staff discussing the arbitration82:\n\n\"I mentioned in the conversation to Mr Torotko that I had been into the office of MCEC and overheard MCEC staff discussing the dispute relating to the Claimant\".\n\nWS of V. Koroban, RWS-1, para. 10.\n\n69.\n\nThird, when discussing the matter with Mr. Dolgov over the phone he denied that the meeting at the MCEC had occurred83:\n\n\"Mr Dolgov also was interested if I had been to MCEC in connection with the arbitration and asked what I had discussed there. I said I had not gone there, because I did not wish to discuss this topic with him\".\n\nWS of V. Koroban, RWS-1, para. 13.\n\n70.\n\nClaimant avers that Mr. Koroban\u2019s contradictory testimony should not be believed84, and the evidence indicates that he was summoned to the MCEC to discuss the arbitration with Respondent\u2019s representatives and counsel85. If anything, Mr. Koroban\u2019s witness statement shows that Respondent\u2019s conduct has already had an adverse effect on him, who as a permanent resident of Belarus is susceptible to pressure from the Belarusian authorities86.\n\nClaimant's Comments, para. 22.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Comments, para. 33.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Request, para. 38; Claimant\u2019s Comments, paras. 20-22.\n\n**C. Belarus\u2019 repeat** ***modus operandi***\n-------------------------------------------\n\n71.\n\nClaimant points to various instances of Belarusian authorities initiating \"baseless\" criminal cases and jailing key witnesses in commercial disputes, to allege that the actions towards Claimant and its affiliate companies and individuals, are indicative of Belarus\u2019 *modus operandi* when engaged in commercial disputes with companies87.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Comments, paras. 36-49.\n\n72.\n\nFor example, just this year Respondent arrested Michael Furman, an official from a Russian company Grand Express, after it brought an ICSID claim against Belarus *(Grand Express v. Belarus)88.* Mr. Furman was arrested in Athens International Airport at the request of Belarusian law enforcement authorities. However, the Greek judiciary overturned the arrest warrant, finding that the criminal proceedings brought by Belarus were based upon artificial grounds, and ordered Mr. Furman\u2019s release89.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Comments paras. 47-49.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Comments para. 48.\n\n73.\n\nFurther in 2013, Vladislav Baumgertner the CEO of a Russian company Uralkali, was invited to Belarus by the Prime Minister to discuss a commercial dispute arising out of a joint venture with a Belarusian state-owned entity90.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Comments paras. 37-40.\n\n74.\n\nAfter the meeting with the Prime Minister of Belarus, Mr. Baumgertner was at the airport of Minsk when he was handcuffed by Belarusian law enforcement authorities and taken to detention facilities, where he spent one month, before his pre-trial restriction was changed to home detention under 24-hour supervision of the Committee of the State Security of the Republic of Belarus91. He was charged with abuse of power and seeking gain at the expense of the Republic of Belarus92.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Comments paras. 41-44.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Comments para. 42.\n\n75.\n\nAfter a three month delay and several rounds of negotiations, Belarus eventually agreed to extradite Mr. Baumgertner (after the initiation of fictitious criminal charges in Russia) on the condition that the loss of approximately USD 1.5 - 2 billion which Belarus had allegedly incurred, be compensated, and after Uralkali\u2019s leading shareholder Mr. Suleiman Kerimov agreed to sell his shares93.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Comments para. 45.\n\n76.\n\nClaimant additionally notes that the European Parliament recently condemned Belarus\u2019 \"repressive and undemocratic policy towards journalists, lawyers, political activists and civil society actors\"94. Claimant avers that Respondent\u2019s pressure of Mr. Koroban and other witnesses and representatives should not come as a surprise. in light of Belarus\u2019 long track record of abuse95.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Comments para. 49, citing Ex. C-213.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Comments para. 50.\n\n**3. Respondent\u2019s position**\n----------------------------\n\n77.\n\nAccording to Respondent, Claimant\u2019s Order Against Criminal Proceedings is moot96 because [REDACTED]\n\nRespondent's Response, para. 76.\n\n78.\n\nIn any event, Respondent avers that Claimant has failed to meet the requirements set out m the UNCITRAL Rules for the gr anting of interim measures **(A. - C.),** and Claimant has brought its Request as an abuse of process **(D.):**\n\n**A. No** ***prima facie*** **case**\n------------------------------------\n\n79.\n\nClaimant has not satisfied the burden of establishing that the Tribunal has *prima facie* jurisdiction or a *prima facie* case on the merits99.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Response, paras. 61-63.\n\n**B. No current or imminent harm likely to occur**\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n80.\n\nRespondent avers that Claimant\u2019s Request fails to meet the applicable legal test under Art. 26 of the UNCITRAL Rules100. Respondent argues that Claimant has failed to provide the Tribunal with the accurate standard for granting interim measures under Art. 26 of the applicable UNCITRAL Rules, relying instead on less onerous tests adopted by tribunals on the basis of an older version of the rules101. Respondent states that regardless of which standard is applied, Claimant\u2019s request for interim measures still fails102.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Response, para. 3, 90; Respondent\u2019s Observations, para. 4.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Response, para. 46; Respondent\u2019s Observations, para. 4.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Response, para. 46.\n\n81.\n\nClaimant has not established that the Order Against Criminal Proceedings is necessary to prevent \"current or imminent\" harm that is \"likely\" to occur under Article 26(2)(b) of the UNCITRAL Rules **103(a.**). And Claimant has failed to provide any concrete evidence to support its position that the pre-investigation inquiries were improper (b.), especially considering that a measure such as the one requested by Claimant, should only be granted in exceptional circumstances and where absolutely necessary104.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Response, para. 77.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Response, para. 87, citing *Teinver S.A., Transportes de Cercan\u00edas SA. and Autobuses Urbanos del Sur S.A. v. The Argentine Republic,* ICSID Case No. ARB/09/1, Decision on Provisional Measures, 8 April 2016. Ex. RL-26, para. 190; *Hydro S.r.l. and others v. Republic of Albania,* ICSID Case No. ARB/15/28. Order on Provisional Measures, 3 March 2016, Ex. CL-77, para. 3.16. Ex. CL-77.\n\n**a. No urgency**\n-----------------\n\n82.\n\nRespondent states that the requirement of urgency fails, as the pre-investigation inquiries were commenced [REDACTED], around [REDACTED] months priortothe commencement of this arbitration105. Claimant fails to substantiate how [REDACTED]\n\nor any of the other factual circumstances on which it relies, have changed the *status quo ante* existing at the time the arbitration was commenced. This supports the Respondent\u2019s position that the Order Against Criminal Proceedings is not urgent106.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Response, para. 55.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Response, para. 84.\n\n**b. No harm**\n--------------\n\n83.\n\nBelarus argues that all of Claimant\u2019s evidence is based only on hearsay and opinion evidence107; and thus, it fails to satisfy the high standard of proof required to establish the occurrence of intimidation108, or satisfied the high burden of proof under Art. 26(3)(a) of the UNCITRAL Rules109.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Observations, para. 3.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Response, para. 80.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Response, para. 88.\n\n84.\n\nParticularly, as regaids to:\n\n85.\n\n(i) [REDACTED] during the Tax Evasion Investigation does not pose any risk to Claimant\u2019s rights in the arbitration, or inhibit Mr. Dolgov\u2019s or Mr. Ekavyan\u2019s ability to effectively participate in the arbitration110.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Response, paras. 56, 83.\n\n86.\n\n[REDACTED]Respondent's investigations were conducted in good faith and Claimant\u2019s request should be dismissed114.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Response, para. 79.\n\n87.\n\nFurther. Respondent\u2019s request for Mr. Dolgov\u2019s address cannot possibly be regarded as proof of an attempt by Respondent to plan action against Mr. Dolgov outside of the arbitral process; to the contrary. Claimant\u2019s suggestion is ludicrous for the following reasons115:\n\n- First, it was Claimant\u2019s suggestion to include in Procedural Order No. 1 para. 35, the requirement that a witness must include its address in its witness statement116.\n\n- Second, Respondent already had Mr. Dolgov's address, [REDACTED]\n\nRespondent\u2019s Response, para. 43.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Response, para. 42.\n\n88.\n\n(ii) [REDACTED] during the Insolvency Proceeding was carried out in good faith, as a result of a proceeding commenced by a private third-party company, and pursuant to the legitimate directions of the Court118. Furthermore, the [REDACTED] concerned routine matters irrelevant to this dispute, since BMP is a separate legal entity engaged in a variety of activities primarily consisting of leasing proper t y, which are unrelated to Manolium-Engineering and to this arbitration, and [REDACTED] dealt with the reasons for BMP\u2019s insolvency119.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Observations, paras. 5, 10, 18.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Observations, para. 6.\n\n89.\n\nAccording to Respondent, the fact that [REDACTED] concerned Mr. Dolgov is logical considering that he was the General Dir ector of BMP dining the time in  which the conduct occurred120. Claimant\u2019s assertion that [REDACTED] indicate a forthcoming attempt by Respondent to improperly contact Mr. Dolgov, are ungrounded and speculative121.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Observations, para. 21.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Observations, para. 21.\n\n90.\n\n[REDACTED] not because Respondent was attempting to intimidate Claimant, but because they played a key role in the events leading to BMP\u2019s insolvency122.\n\nRespondent's Observations, para. 22. Ms. [REDACTED] was the chief accountant of BMP: Ms. [REDACTED] was a party to lease agreements with BMP under which the leased premises to BMP at an alleged inflated price: Mr. [REDACTED] (Mr. Dolgov\u2019s cousin) was the CEO of Centrobeton, the entity which received interest-free loans from BMP: and the liquidator of Oktan-AZS-Service, a company which also received interest-free loans from BMP.\n\n91.\n\nRespondent alleges that Claimant falls manifestly short of fulfilling the high burden of proving an attempt to intimidate Mr. Dolgov or Claimant by the [REDACTED]\n\n92.\n\n(iii) The interview with Mr. Koroban. Respondent argues that Claimant has misrepresented the nature of Mr. Koroban\u2019s meeting with the MCEC and his subsequent phone conversation with Mr. Dolgov, in order to paint the Respondent in a bad light124, and has failed to establish any basis on which the Order to Restrict Conununication should be granted125.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Response, para. 91.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Response, para. 91.\n\n93.\n\nClaimant\u2019s conclusion that Mr. Koroban\u2019s accounts are contradictory is based on the assumption that Mr. Koroban was under an obligation to report fully and accurately to Mr. Dolgov and Mr. Torot\u2019ko126. The fact that Mr. Koroban chose not to, does not justify Claimant\u2019s far-reaching conclusion that Mr. Koroban is acting \"out of fear for his well-being\" or calls \"into serious question the veracity of his testimony\"127.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Observations, para. 37.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Observations, para. 37, quoting Claimant\u2019s Comments, para. 35.\n\n94.\n\nIn addition, Mr. Koroban has confirmed that he came to the MCEC voluntarily and without coercion and that he is not worried about his safety128. Claimant\u2019s failure to support its accusations about the pressure on Mr. Koroban is manifest129.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Observations, para. 38, quoting WS of V. Koroban. RWS-1, paras. 8. 15.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Observations, para. 40.\n\n95.\n\nIn any case, Mr. Koroban is not a shareholder, official or employee of Claimant, and has not been employed by Claimant for four years, thus not correlating with Claimant\u2019s requested Order to Restrict Communications130.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Response, para. 36; Communication RS-12, para. 4.\n\n96.\n\n(iv) Claimant\u2019s reference to unrelated domestic criminal proceedings is an attempt to fill the gaping hole in its non-existent evidence131. These speculations are of no relevance to the arbitration, expecially since [REDACTED]\n\nRespondent\u2019s Observations, para. 41.\n\n**C. Orders are disproportionate**\n----------------------------------\n\n97.\n\nIn regard to the requirement of proportionality under the UNCITRAL Rules, Respondent states that Claimant fails to apply the correct test133.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Response, para. 86.\n\n98.\n\nBut even under the less burdensome proportionality test cited by Claimant, the \"balance of inconvenience\" would still fall strongly in favour of not granting the Orders134, because if Claimant's Request is granted, it would interfere with Respondent\u2019s sovereign right to investigate and prosecute criminal conduct on its territory135.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Response, para. 88.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Response, para. 87.\n\n99.\n\nRespondent avers that it has the right to exercise its normal sovereign functions on its territory, as long as it acts in good faith and respects Claimant\u2019s rights136. Respondent cites to decisions of var ious arbitr al tribunals, which have held that a\n\nState has the right to conduct normal processes of criminal, administrative and civil justice within its territory137, as long as such powers are exercised in good faith and whilst respecting the rights of the claimant138. This position is not contradicted in the authorities relied upon by Claimant, which only granted interim measures when the proceedings were commenced in bad faith or hindered the claimant\u2019s ability to participate in the arbitration:\n\n- In *Quiborax v. Bolivia* the criminal proceedings were commenced because the claimant had initiated the arbitration139;\n\n- In *City Oriente v. Ecuador* the criminal proceedings were being used by Ecuador to secure payment on the basis of a domestic law, which was precisely the subject of the dispute in the arbitration140;\n\n- In *Hydro v. Albania* the tribunal found that the possible incarceration of two of the claimants in Albania posed an imminent risk on their ability to participate in the arbitration141.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Response, para. 47.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Response, paras. 47-48, citing *SGS Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale de Surveillance SA v. Pakistan,* Ex. RL-22, p. 301 and *Quiborax v. Bolivia,* Ex. CL-71, para. 123.\n\n*Quiborax v. Bolivia,* Ex. CL-71, para. 123.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Response, para. 50.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Response, para. 51.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Response, para. 52.\n\n100.\n\nAccording to Respondent, the authorities cited differ to the present case for the following two reasons:\n\n- First, there are no ongoing criminal proceedings in the present case, thus, the Request fails for lack of necessity, urgency and proportionality under the UNCITRAL Rules142; and\n\n- Second, Respondent has proven that all its investigations were carried out in good faith; therefore, Belarus should not see its right to conduct the normal processes of domestic justice restricted, as it would disproportionately harm Respondent\u2019s sovereign interests143; more so, when the rights of third parties - such as BMP\u2019s creditors - require protection144.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Response, para. 54.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Response, para. 92.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Observations, para. 34.\n\n101.\n\nIn relation to Claimant\u2019s Non-Aggravation Order that Respondent be directed to \"refrain from any other actions that could further aggravate the dispute and violate the integrity of the arbitration proceedings\", Respondent repeats that Claimant has failed to show how such an order is necessary, urgent or proportionate, as none of the events have aggravated this dispute, altered the *status quo* or affected the rights of the Claimant in this arbitration in any way145. Further, Claimant has not explained the need for such a broad and vague order, considering the Parties\u2019 general right to the non-aggravation of the dispute and integrity of the arbitral proceedings146.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Observations, para. 3.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Response, para. 95.\n\n**D. Abuse of process**\n-----------------------\n\n102.\n\nRespondent states that the Tribunal has discretion to refrain from issuing interim measures if a request is made in bad faith to delay the proceedings or to harass the opposing party147, which is precisely what has occurred in the present case:\n\nRespondent\u2019s Response, para. 64.\n\n103.\n\n(i) Claimant has intentionally distorted the facts and failed to disclose relevant information in order to present the Respondent in a poor light and mislead the Tribunal148: Claimant was aware of the court ruling ordering the commencement of the Insolvency Proceeding since 16 August 2018149; however, Claimant did not notify the Tribunal or Counsel for the Respondent of its alleged concerns, instead waiting for the investigations to take their natural course so as to accuse the Respondent of acting against the Tribunal\u2019s directions150.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Response, para. 65.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Observations, para. 30.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Observations, paras. 30-31.\n\n104.\n\n(ii) Claimant is attempting to interfere with Respondent\u2019s legitimate preparation and gathering of information and evidence for its Statement of Defence151: Claimant knew of the Tax Evasion Investigation since at least summer of 2017, yet failed to raise it with the Tribunal until eight months into the arbitration, indicating that Claimant\u2019s real motive for submitting the Application is to interfere with Respondent\u2019s preparation of its Statement of Defence, not to protect the procedural integrity of the arbitration or any other rights that Claimant alleges are under threat152.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Response, para. 93; Communication R-10, 2 August 2018, p. 2.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Response, para. 65.\n\n105.\n\n(iii) Claimant is trying to use these arbitral proceedings to avoid any investigations or inquiries into their wrongdoings, however irrelevant they are to this dispute153. Respondent submits that this is an abuse of process: interim measures cannot give a party immunity from any type of state control and a *carte blanche* for breaking the law154. Respondent quotes the tribunal in *Quiborax v. Bolivia* which held that155:\n\n\"... the international protection granted to investors does not exempt suspected criminals from prosecution by virtue of their being investors\".\n\nRespondent\u2019s Observations, para. 33.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Observations, para. 33.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Observations, para. 33, quoting *Quiborax S.A., Non Metallic Minerals S.A. and Allan Fosk Kaplun v. Plurinational State of Bolivia,* ICSID Case No. ARB/06/2, Decision on Provisional Measures of 26 February 2010, para. 164, Ex. CL-71.\n\n**4. Discussion**\n-----------------\n\n106.\n\nIn this section, the Tribunal discusses and rules on the three requested interim measures submitted by Claimant under Art. 26 of the UNCITRAL Rules.\n\n107.\n\nClaimant requests the Arbitral Tribunal to issue an order directing Respondent to156:\n\n- Abstain from initiating criminal proceedings and/or suspend any current criminal proceedings against the former and current officials of Claimant and the companies affiliated with Claimant until the completion of the arbitration [\"**Order Against Criminal Proceedings**\"];\n\n- Refrain from contacting the shareholders, officials and employees of Claimant and Manolium-Engineering, without the consent from Claimant and prior authorization of the Tribunal [\"**order to Restrict Communication**\"]; and\n\n- Refrain from any other actions that could further aggravate the dispute and violate the integrity of the arbitral proceedings [\"**Non-Aggravation order**\"].\n\nClaimant\u2019s Request, para. 59; Claimant\u2019s Comments, para. 55.\n\n108.\n\nUnder the UNCITRAL Rules, the Arbitral Tribunal is empowered to grant an interim measure, defined as157:\n\n\"... any temporary measure by which, at any time prior to the issuance of the award by which the dispute is finally decided, the arbitral tribunal orders a party, for example and without limitation, to:\n\n*(a)* Maintain or restore the status quo pending determination of the dispute;\n\n*(b)* Take action that would prevent, or refrain from taking action that is likely to cause, (i) current or imminent harm or (ii) prejudice to the arbitral process itself\".\n\nArt. 26(2).\n\n109.\n\nTo grant the requested interim measures, Claimant's bears the burden of proving that158:\n\n\"(a) Harm not adequately reparable by an award of damages is likely to result if the measure is not ordered, and such harm substantially outweighs the harm that is likely to result to the party against whom the measure is directed if the measure is granted; and\n\n(b) There is a reasonable possibility that the requesting party will succeed on the merits of the claim. The determination on this possibility shall not affect the discretion of the arbitral tribunal in making any subsequent determination\".\n\nUNCITRAL Rules, Art. 26(3)(a), (b).\n\n110.\n\nFor the reasons discussed below, the Arbitral Tribunal has decided that under the current factual circumstances the requested interim measures are either moot or unnecessary and therefore dismisses the Request. Nevertheless, the Tribunal considers it necessary to remind the Parties of their implicit duties which are fundamental to investment arbitration proceedings and must be respected by both Parties. The Tribunal will establish its reasons for dismissing each requested order **(A. - C.),** and then restate the duties of the Parties **(D.).**\n\n**A. Order Against Criminal Proceedings**\n-----------------------------------------\n\n111.\n\nFor the first order, Claimant requests the Arbitral Tribunal order Respondent to159:\n\n- Suspend any current criminal proceedings against the former and current officials of Claimant and Manolium-Engineering until the completion of the arbitr ation **(a.);** and/or\n\n- Abstain from initiating criminal proceedings **(b.).**\n\nClaimant\u2019s Request, para. 59.\n\n112.\n\nClaimant avers that Respondent is using its police powers to take justice into its own hands by [REDACTED]160. Claimant states that Respondent's [REDACTED] is intimidating Claimant\u2019s witnesses and former employees and putting the procedural integrity of this arbitration at threat161.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Request, paras. 34-35; Claimant\u2019s Comments, para. 10.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Request, para. 32.\n\n113.\n\nRespondent replies that the requested Order Against Criminal Proceedings is moot [REDACTED].\n\n114.\n\nRespondent adds that, even if [REDACTED], the requested Order should still fail as Claimant has not established that it is necessary to prevent current or imminent harm that is likely to occur163, or satisfied the high burden of proof under the UNCITRAL Rules164.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Response, para. 77.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Response, para. 88.\n\n**a. Ol der to suspend criminal proceedings**\n---------------------------------------------\n\n115.\n\nThe Tribunal notes firstly that contrary to Claimant\u2019s assertion, there are no \u2018criminal proceedings\u2019 pending against any former or current official of Claimant or Manolium-Engineering. However, there are two investigations which were brought by Belarus to ascertain whether criminal proceedings should be brought -the Tax Evasion Investigation **(i.**) and the Insolvency Proceeding **(ii.).**\n\n116.\n\nThe Tribunal will examine the circumstances of these investigations to determine whether:\n\n- Claimant has established that it is likely to suffer current or imminent harm or prejudice to the arbitral process itself that would not adequately be reparable by an award of damages if the measure is not ordered; and\n\n- The investigations were brought for an improper purpose, in bad faith, or were conducted in violation of Claimant\u2019s rights, so as to justify an order restricting Respondent from initiating any criminal proceedings against the former and current officials of Claimant and Manolium-Engineering until the completion of this arbitration.\n\n(i) The Tax Evasion Investigation\n---------------------------------\n\n117.\n\nBased on [REDACTED], the Tribunal agrees with Respondent that the requested Order Against Criminal Proceedings is moot.\n\n118.\n\nIn any case, Claimant has failed to discharge its burden of proving that the Tax Evasion Investigation was conducted in bad faith or violated the Claimant\u2019s rights, which could justify a showing of likely imminent harm to Claimant or prejudice to the arbitral process itself, which would not be adequately reparable by an award of damages.\n\n119.\n\nThe Tax Evasion Investigation was commenced by Belarusian authorities prior to the initiation of this arbitration and after a tax audit of Manolium-Engineering published in March 2017 found that Manolium-Engineering owed unpaid taxes and fines165.\n\nDoc. C-186. p. 8.\n\n120.\n\nBased on this finding, an investigation was commenced to ascertain whether the non-payment of taxes amounted to a criminal offence. [REDACTED]\n\n121.\n\nBelarus has a sovereign right to investigate alleged tax evasion of companies operating within its territory. If this right is misused to intimidate relevant witnesses through a domestic investigation, Claimant has the burden of proving it through concrete evidence167.\n\n*Churchill Mining and Planet Mining Pty Ltd* v. *Republic of Indonesia,* ICSID Case No. ARB/12/14 and 12/40, Procedural Order No. 14, 22 December 2014, paras. 72, 87, RL-25.\n\n122.\n\nClaimant, however, has produced no evidence showing that [REDACTED],went beyond a legitimate exercise of this sovereign right: [REDACTED]\n\n123.\n\nThe  [REDACTED]  alone are insufficient to justify Claimant\u2019s allegation of attempted intimidation. In the absence of such evidence, an order to restrict Respondent\u2019s sovereign right to investigate criminal conduct is not warranted, as Claimant has failed to discharge its burden of proving the first element required by Art. 26(3)(a), that harm not adequately reparable by an award of damages is likely to result if the measure is not ordered, and such harm substantially outweighs the harm that is likely to result to Respondent if the measure is gr anted.\n\n(ii) The Insolvency Proceeding\n------------------------------\n\n124.\n\nThe second investigation is an Insolvency Proceeding against Belarusian Foreign Enterprise Manolium-Processing (BMP), jointly owned by Claimant and Mr. Dolgov168. Tire Insolvency Proceeding was set in motion after an application by a private third-party creditor169. This is significant, as it does not support an argument of an illegitimate use of Respondent\u2019s policing powers.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Observations, paras. 8-9.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Observations, para. 10.\n\n125.\n\nFurther. the procedures that followed appear to have been a legitimate investigation in accordance with Belarusian insolvency law, which mandates an enquiry as to whether insolvency was deliberately caused by the officers of the entity170: the expert appointed by the administrator found that the management deliberately entered into transactions on disadvantageous terms causing detriment to the company\u2019s solvency and economic position171, then the Minsk Prosecutor\u2019s Office initiated an investigation to ascertain whether there was any evidence of false insolvency, deliberate insolvency, concealment of insolvency or obstruction of recovery of the creditors\u2019 losses172, the result of which should be rendered by 21 December 2018173.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Observations, para. 11, citing Insolvency Law of the Republic of Belarus, Art. 77(1).\n\nDoc. R-10, p. 2.\n\nDoc. R-10, p. 3.\n\nDoc. R-10, p. 3.\n\n126.\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n127.\n\nClaimant fails to provide evidence other than a witness statement of Mr. Dolgov, of how [REDACTED] was made in bad faith, with an intent to intimidate any of these individuals or put the arbitration\u2019s procedural integrity at threat, so as to justify an order to prevent an imminent harm178.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Request, para. 32.\n\n128.\n\nThe Tribunal finds that Claimant has failed to discharge its burden of proving the first element required by Art. 26(3)(a), that harm not adequately reparable by an award of damages is likely to result if the measure is not ordered, and that such harm substantially outweighs the harm that is likely to result to Respondent if the measure is granted.\n\n**b. Request to abstain from initiating criminal proceedings**\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n129.\n\nClaimant additionally requests that the Tribunal order Respondent to abstain from initiating criminal proceedings until the completion of this arbitration.\n\n130.\n\nThe Tribunal respects the sovereign right of a State to investigate criminal conduct occurring within its territory179. This right does not disappear- by virtue of an international arbitration, nor does the international arbitration automatically shield a claimant from investigation of any alleged breaches of the State\u2019s domestic criminal law180. As tribunals have consistently held, an order that restricts the investigation or prosecution of suspected criminal conduct should only be ordered if it is absolutely necessary181.\n\n*Sergei Viktorovich Pugachev v.

However, in the present case, the Claimant has not established that the Tax Evasion Investigation or the Insolvency Proceeding, have any correlation to this arbitration or put Claimant's rights in this arbitration at risk, which would justify an order to estop Respondent from commencing new criminal proceedings until the end of the arbitration.\n\n*City Oriente Limited v. Republic of Ecuador and Empresa Estatal Petr\u00f3leos del Ecuador (Petroecuador)*, ICSID Case No. ARB/06/21, Decision on Provisional Measures of 19 November 2007, paras. 61-66, Ex.

CL-71.\n\n132.\n\nClaimant has not proved that it is likely to suffer a harm that is not adequately reparable by an award of damages if the measure is not ordered, which would substantially outweigh the harm that is likely to result to Respondent if the Tribunal restricts its sovereign right to conduct criminal investigations.\n\n133.\n\nIf a situation arises where criminal proceedings are commenced against Claimant, and Claimant considers that it is at risk of current or imminent harm or that its rights in the arbitration or the arbitral process are at risk of prejudice183, Claimant is directed to raise its concerns before the Tribunal.\n\nUNCITRAL Rules, Art. 26(2)(b).\n\n**B. Order to Restrict Communication**\n--------------------------------------\n\n134.\n\nIn its Order to Restrict Communication, the Claimant requests that the Tribunal order the Respondent to:\n\n\"Refrain from contacting the shareholders, officials and employees of Claimant and Manolium-Engineering, without the consent from Claimant and prior authorization of the Tribunal\".\n\n135.\n\nClaimant states that Respondent's questioning is intimidating Claimant's witnesses and former employees, putting the procedural integrity of this arbitration at threat184.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Request, para. 32.\n\n136.\n\nClaimant avers that [REDACTED] was likely motivated by an improper purpose185, and additionally questions the motivation for Respondent's request that Mr. Dolgov include his address in his witness statement, alleging that this shows that Respondent is preparing action against Mr. Dolgov outside of this arbitration186.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Request, para. 8.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Request, para. 19.\n\n137.\n\nAs the Tribunal has already dealt with [REDACTED] in the prior section *(supra* paras. M18-123), and [REDACTED]  relation to the Insolvency Proceeding *(supra* paras. 124 - 128), it will now address the questioning of Mr. Koroban **(a.**) and Respondent\u2019s request that Mr. Dolgov provide his address in his witness statement **(b.).**\n\n**a. Questioning of Mr. Koroban**\n---------------------------------\n\n138.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that there are two contradictory versions of the former Deputy Director of Manolium-Engineering, Mr. Koroban\u2019s, meeting at the MCEC. The version provided by Mr. Koroban, and the version provided by Mr. Torot\u2019ko and Mr. Dolgov.\n\n139.\n\nIt is Claimant\u2019s case that the Order to Restrict Communication is necessary as Mr. Koroban\u2019s contradictory versions of events is evidence of coercion, and an effort by Respondent to pressure and intimidate him into silence187. As a resident of Belarus, Mr. Koroban\u2019s cooperation was motivated by a fear of criminal prosecution and a fear for his well-being, despite his allegation to the contrary188. Further. Claimant alleges that Mr. Koroban\u2019s meeting with the MCEC shows that \"Respondent is using its powers to collect evidence from Claimant\u2019s employees outside of the arbitral process\"189.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Request, paras. 18, 38: Claimant\u2019s Comments, paras. 20-22.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Comments, para. 51.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Request, para. 17.\n\n140.\n\nOn the other hand. Respondent states that Mr. Koroban has not been employed by Manoloium-Engineering for at least four years, thus not correlating with the requested Order as formulated190. Respondent states that Claimant has failed to establish any basis on which the Order to Restrict Communication should be gr anted191, or adduce any concrete evidence in support of its accusations about the pressure on Mr. Koroban192. The fact that Mr. Koroban\u2019s fust-hand account of his visit to the MCEC contradicts subsequent conversations with Mr. Torot\u2019ko and Mr. Dolgov, does not justify Claimant\u2019s far-reaching conclusion that Mr. Koroban is acting \"out of fear for his well-being\" or calls \"into serious question the veracity of his testimony\"193.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Response, para. 36.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Response, para. 91.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Observations, para. 40.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Observations, para. 37, quoting Claimant\u2019s Comments, para. 35.\n\n141.\n\nThe Tribunal agr ees with Respondent that Claimant has failed to provide concrete evidence in support of its allegations, which it must in order to discharge its burden of proof194.\n\n*Churchill Mining and Planet Mining Pty Ltd v. Republic of Indonesia.* ICSID Case No. ARB/12/14 and 12/40, Procedural Order No. 14, 22 December 2014, paras. 72, 87, RL-25.\n\n142.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that whilst there are inconsistencies between Mr. Koroban\u2019s witness statement and the witness statements of Mr. Dolgov and Mr. Torot\u2019ko, contradictory witness statements does not provide evidence of witness intimidation. Claimant has failed to substantiate its allegations of coercion and witness intimidation with anything other than the speculations of Mr. Dolgov and Mr. Torot\u2019ko, that Mr. Koroban\u2019s inconsistent behaviour (which in itself is only supported by hearsay testimony) can likely be attributed to his fear \"of something\"195.\n\nWS of L. Torot\u2019ko, CWS-3, para. 26.\n\n143.\n\nIn Mr. Koroban\u2019s first-hand account, he states that he attended the MCEC voluntarily and without coercion and that he is not worried about his safety196. In the absence of stronger evidence to contradict these statements, Mr. Koroban\u2019s witness statement is to be believed.\n\nWS of V. Koroban, RWS-1, paras. 8, 15.\n\n144.\n\nIn regard to Respondent\u2019s ability to contact other shareholders, officials and employees of Claimant and Manolium-Engineering, the Tribunal notes that Respondent has a sovereign right to conduct normal State functions in good faith and whilst respecting the rights of Claimant197, and a Tribunal should not restrict the exercise of sovereign powers, in the absence of convincing evidence that such powers are being exercised in bad faith or in violation of the other party\u2019s rights.\n\n*SGS Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale de Surveillance SA v. Pakistan*, Ex. RL-22, p. 301 and *Quiborax v. Bolivia*, Ex. CL-71, para. 123.\n\n145.\n\nIn conclusion, Claimant has failed to establish that Respondent\u2019s [REDACTED] is putting the procedural integrity of this arbitration at threat. The Tribunal thus finds that in respect of its Order to Restrict Communication, Claimant has failed to satisfactorily discharge its burden under the UNCITRAL Rules, of establishing that it is likely to suffer a harm that is not adequately reparable by an award of damages if the measure is not ordered, which would substantially outweigh the harm that is likely to result to Respondent if the measure is granted.\n\n**b. Request for Mr. Dolgov\u2019s address**\n---------------------------------------\n\n146.\n\nClaimant additionally questions the motivation for Respondent\u2019s demand that Mr. Dolgov include his address in his witness statement, averring that this indicates that the Respondent is preparing some action against Mr. Dolgov outside of this arbitration198.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Request, para. 19.\n\n147.\n\nRespondent strongly denies Claimant\u2019s allegation, replying that it was merely requesting compliance with PO No. 1 para. 35, and in any case, Respondent already has Mr. Dolgov\u2019s address [REDACTED]199.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Response, paras. 41-43.\n\n148.\n\nThe Tribunal finds Respondent\u2019s position to be more convincing.\n\n**C. Order for Non-Aggravation**\n--------------------------------\n\n149.\n\nIn its third and final order, Claimant requests that the Tribunal order Respondent to200:\n\n\"Refrain from any other actions that could further aggravate the dispute and violate the integrity of the arbitral proceedings\".\n\nClaimant's Request, para. 59.\n\n150.\n\nAs the Tribunal will discuss below, it is widely accepted that parties in an investment arbitration have a general duty not to engage in conduct which may aggravate the dispute201. As outlined by the tribunal in *Amco v. Indonesia,* within arbitral disputes exists a202:\n\n\"... good and fair practical rule, according to which both Parties to a legal dispute should refrain, in their own interest, to do anything that could aggravate or exacerbate the same, thus rendering its solution possibly more difficult\".\n\n*City Oriente Limited v. Republic of Ecuador and Empresa Estatal Petr\u00f3leos del Ecuador (Petroecuador)*, ICSID Case No. ARB/06/21. Decision on Provisional Measures of 19 November 2007, para. 57, Ex.

Republic of Ecuador,* ICSID Case No. ARB/08/5, Procedural Order No. 1 of 29 June 2009, paras. 62-64, Ex. CL-73.\n\n*Amco Asia v. Indonesia,* Decision on request for provisional measures of 9 December 1983, ICSID Reports, 1993, p. 412, cited in *Quiborax S.A., Non Metallic Minerals S.A. and Allan Fosk Kapl\u00fan v. Plurinational State of Bolivia*, ICSID Case No. ARB/06/2, Decision on Provisional Measures of 26 February 2010, para. 135, Ex. CL-71.\n\n151.\n\nThe Tribunal confirms that both Parties should refrain from any conduct which could have the effect of aggravating the dispute or violating the integrity of the arbitral proceedings.\n\n152.\n\nConsidering that the duty to not aggravate the dispute is a general duty implicit in the arbitral process, the Tribunal does not consider it necessary to make a specific order in this regard.\n\n153.\n\nIf the Parties require guidance as to whether any future action could aggravate the dispute or violate the integrity of the arbitral proceedings, they are encouraged to contact the Tribunal *ex ante* and request additional guidance.\n\n**D. General duties of parties in investment arbitration proceedings**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n154.\n\nNotwithstanding the above decision, the Tribunal wishes to remind the Parties of the four duties that are implicit in all investment arbitration proceedings, which both the State and investor must respect at all times:\n\n- The duty to not aggravate the dispute (**a.**);\n\n- The duty to not obtain evidence improperly (**b.**);\n\n- The duty to not unduly influence witnesses (**c.**); and\n\n- The duty to not put undue pressure on anyone related to the investor, including its directors, shareholders or employees (**d.)**.\n\n155.\n\nRespect for these duties becomes particularly paramount in investment arbitral proceedings, due to the inherent power imbalance between a State, endowed with a wealth of special sovereign powers, and a foreign investor who does not have equal power and is subject to the control of the State when operating within its jurisdiction.\n\n156.\n\nWhen agreeing to arbitrate a dispute, a State has agreed to cede part of its sovereignty to be subject to the arbitration\u2019s procedural rules and the authority of the arbitral tribunal. By doing so, the State and foreign investor agree to comply with the duty to arbitrate fairly and in good faith, whilst respecting the procedural integrity of the arbitration and avoiding conduct which upsets the balance of equality between the parties203.\n\nArt. 17(1), UNCITRAL Rules 2010. See also *Methanex Corporation v. United States of America* (UNCITRAL), Final Award of the Tribunal on Jurisdiction and Merits, para. 54, Part II - Chapter I - p. 26; T. W\u00e4lde, \"Equality of Arms in Investment Arbitration: Procedural Challenges\", in Yannaca-Small, K. \"Arbitration Under International Investment Agreements: A Guide to Key Issues\"; Oxford University Press (2010).\n\n**a. Duty to not aggravate the dispute**\n----------------------------------------\n\n157.\n\nParties to an investment arbitration must always observe the duty to not aggravate the dispute and to maintain the *status quo ante,* the legal situation existing prior to the institution of the arbitration. The Permanent Court of International Justice first recognized the duty on parties to not aggravate the dispute or take action that impairs the rights of the other party, when in 1939 it issued provisional measures against Bulgaria and in favour of Belgium204.\n\n*Electricity Company of Sofia and Bulgaria (Belgium v. Bulgaria),* Judgment of 5 December 1939, PCIJ series A/B, No 79, p. 199.\n\n158.\n\nSince then, arbitral tribunals have consistently confirmed this duty, under which parties must abstain from any action which might aggravate or extend the dispute, alter the *status quo*, or take justice into their own hands205.\n\n*City Oriente Limited v. Republic of Ecuador and Empresa Estatal Petr\u00f3leos del Ecuador (Petroecuador)*, ICSID Case No. ARB/06/21. Decision on Provisional Measures of 19 November 2007, para. 57, Ex. CL-72; *Quiborax S.A., Non Metallic Minerals S.A. and Allan Fosk Kapl\u00fan v. Plurinational State of Bolivia,* ICSID Case No. ARB/06/2, Decision on Provisional Measures of 26 February 2010, paras. 133-135, Ex. CL-71; *Burlington Resources Inc. v. Republic of Ecuador,* ICSID Case No. ARB/08/5, Procedural Order No. 1 of 29 June 2009, paras. 62-64, Ex. CL-73.\n\n**b. Duty to not obtain evidence improperly**\n---------------------------------------------\n\n159.\n\nParties in an investment arbitration have a duty to not obtain evidence through improper means. This is derived from the obligation to arbitrate fairly and in good faith206, and the principle of equality of arms implicit in all international arbitrations between a State party and a foreign investor207.\n\n*Libananco Holdings Co. Limited v. Republic of Turkey* (ICSID Case No. ARB/06/8), Decision on Preliminary Issues, 23 June 2008, para. 78 (\"Nor does the Tribunal doubt for a moment that, like any other international tribunal, it must be regarded as endowed with the inherent powers required to preserve the integrity of its own process - even if the remedies open to it are necessarily different from those that might be available to a domestic court of law in an ICSID Member State.\"). See also *Cementownia \"Nowa Huta\" S.A. v. Republic of Turkey* (ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/06/2), Award, para. 153.\n\nSee *Methanex Corporation v. United States of America* (UNCITRAL), Final Award of the Tribunal on Jurisdiction and Merits, para. 54, Part II - Chapter I - p. 26; T. W\u00e4lde, \"Equality of Arms in Investment Arbitration: Procedural Challenges\", p. 161 in Yannaca-Small, K. \"Arbitration Under International Investment Agreements: A Guide to Key Issues\"; Oxford University Press (2010).\n\n160.\n\nThe duty to not obtain evidence improperly requires a Respondent State to abstain from the use of special domestic powers, for example, to investigate suspected criminal conduct, or conduct intelligence for national security purposes, to obtain evidence to defend itself in an investment arbitration. Whilst the capacity for a foreign investor to obtain evidence from a State party through improper means is significantly reduced, the duty not to engage in improper activities applies equally to a foreign investor.\n\n161.\n\nAs expressed by the tribunal in *Methanex v. USA*208:\n\n\"As a general principle, therefore, just as it would be wrong for the USA *ex hypothesi* to misuse its intelligence assets to spy on Methanex (and its witnesses) and to introduce into evidence the resulting materials into this arbitration, so too would it be wrong for Methanex to introduce evidential materials obtained by Methanex unlawfully\".\n\nSee also *Methanex Corporation v. United States of America* (UNCITRAL), Final Award of the Tribunal on Jurisdiction and Merits, para. 54, Part II - Chapter I - p. 26.\n\n162.\n\nThis duty to not obtain evidence through improper means is reflected in the IBA Guidelines on the Taking of Evidence, whereby arbitral tribunals are empowered to exclude evidence for compelling reasons of \"fairness or equality of the Parties\"209. Further, Art. 17(1) of the UNCITRAL Rules provides that the Tribunal must treat the parties with equality and maintain procedural fairness:\n\n\"Subject to these Rules, the arbitral tribunal may conduct the arbitration in such manner as it considers appropriate, provided that the parties are treated with equality and that at an appropriate stage of the proceedings each party is given a reasonable opportunity of presenting its case. The arbitral tribunal, in exercising its discretion, shall conduct the proceedings so as to avoid unnecessary delay and expense and to provide a fair and efficient process for resolving the parties\u2019 dispute\". [Emphasis added]\n\nIBA Rules on the Taking of Evidence, Article 9.2.(g).\n\n**c. Duty to not unduly influence witnesses**\n---------------------------------------------\n\n163.\n\nIt is a basic premise of both domestic and international dispute resolution that parties have a duty to refrain from any behaviour which could be seen as an attempt to exert undue influence or pressure on a witness or a potential witness. This could be regarded as a general principle of law recognized by civilized legal systems210.\n\nArt. 38(1), Statute of the International Court of Justice.\n\n164.\n\nAs stated in the UNCITRAL Rules, a party must be given a reasonable opportunity to present its case211. To do so, a party must be able to adduce witness statements.\n\nArt. 17(1), UNCITRAL Rules 2010.\n\n165.\n\nIt is imperative to the functioning of any system of justice, that witnesses feel as though they are able to give free and accurate testimony. Any attempt by a party to hinder a witnesses\u2019 liberty to testify freely, whether it be through intimidation, coercion, or undue pressure in any form, constitutes a violation of the duty to arbitrate in good faith, and a violation of the procedural integrity of the arbitration212.\n\nArt. 17(1), UNCITRAL Rules 2010; *Quiborax S.A., Non Metallic Minerals S.A. and Allan Fosk Kaplun v. Plurinational State of Bolivia,* ICSID Case No. ARB/06/2, Decision on Provisional Measures of 26 February 2010, para. 123, Ex. CL-71; T. W\u00e4lde, \"Equality of Arms in Investment Arbitration: Procedural Challenges\", in Yannaca-Small, K. \"Arbitration Under International Investment Agreements: A Guide to Key Issues\"; Oxford University Press (2010).\n\n166.\n\nIn *Quiborax v. Bolivia*, the tribunal found that the domestic criminal proceedings, which appeared to be motivated by the investment arbitration, restricted the ability for certain witnesses to testify in the arbitration, and thus constituted a threat to the procedural integrity of the arbitration213. The tribunal additionally stated that214:\n\n\"Even if no undue pressure is exercised on potential witnesses, the very nature of these criminal proceedings is bound to reduce their willingness to cooperate in the ICSID proceeding. Given that the existence of this ICSID arbitration has been characterized within the criminal proceedings as a harm to Bolivia, it is unlikely that the persons charged will feel free to participate as witnesses in this arbitration\". [Emphasis added]\n\nRespondent\u2019s Response, para. 50.\n\n*Quiborax S.A., Non Metallic Minerals S.A. and Allan Fosk Kaplun v. Plurinational State of Bolivia,* ICSID Case No. ARB/06/2, Decision on Provisional Measures of 26 February 2010, para. 146, Ex. CL-71.\n\n167.\n\nIf a witness is unable or unwilling to testify due to actions of the other party, this will violate the party\u2019s right to be heard and to present its case before the tribunal.\n\n**d. Duty not to exert pressure on claimant or its representatives**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n168.\n\nUnderpinned by the obligation to arbitrate fairly and in good faith, and the right to the procedural integrity of the arbitration, is the principle that a party shall have the opportunity to access arbitration and present its claim, free from all forms of coercion and undue pressure215.\n\nArt. 17(1), UNCITRAL Rules 2010.\n\n169.\n\nParties thus have a duty to refrain from any behaviour which could be seen as an attempt to exert any form of undue pressure on the other party or its representatives.\n\n170.\n\nA State has a reinforced duty to abstain from using its authority as a sovereign power to exert pressure on a foreign investor or its current and former personnel, including its directors, shareholders, employees, affiliate companies, or legal representatives, in an attempt to dissuade the bringing of a claim, impair the procedural rights of the Claimant in the arbitration, or deter a potential witness\u2019 or legal counsel\u2019s participation in the arbitral process in support of the foreign investor. In *Hydro v. Albania*, the tribunal found that the possible incarceration of two of the claimants in Albania posed an imminent risk on their ability to participate in the arbitration216.\n\n*Hydro S.r.l. and others v. Republic of Albania,* ICSID Case No. ARB/15/28, Order on Provisional Measures of 3 March 2016, para. 3.29, Ex. CL-77.\n\n171.\n\nFurther, as outlined by the tribunal in *Quiborax v. Bolivia*217:\n\n\"Bolivia has the sovereign power to prosecute conduct that may constitute a crime on its own territory, if it has sufficient elements justifying prosecution. Bolivia also has the power to investigate whether Claimants have made their investments in Bolivia in accordance with Bolivian law and to present evidence in that respect. But such powers must be exercised in good faith and respecting Claimants\u2019 rights, including their *prima facie* right to pursue this arbitration\". [Emphasis added]\n\n*Quiborax S.A., Non Metallic Minerals S.A. and Allan Fosk Kapl\u00fan v. Plurinational State of Bolivia,* ICSID Case No. ARB/06/2, Decision on Provisional Measures of 26 February 2010, para. 123, Ex. CL-71.\n\n172.\n\nAny attempt by an investor or a State party to unduly coerce or exert pressure on the other party, would constitute a breach of the duty to arbitrate fairly and in good faith, and would violate the procedural integrity of the arbitration, and could hinder the right for the party to have its request for relief fairly considered by the Tribunal218.\n\nSee for example, *Quiborax S.A., Non Metallic Minerals S.A. and Allan Fosk Kapl\u00fan v. Plurinational State of Bolivia,* ICSID Case No. ARB/06/2, Decision on Provisional Measures of 26 February 2010, para. 141, Ex. CL-71; *City Oriente Limited v. Republic of Ecuador and Empresa Estatal Petr\u00f3leos del Ecuador (Petroecuador)*, ICSID Case No. ARB/06/21, Decision on Provisional Measures of 19 November 2007, paras. 133, 141-148, Ex. CL-72 and *Hydro S.r.l. and others v. Republic of Albania,* ICSID Case No. ARB/15/28, Order on Provisional Measures of 3 March 2016, paras. 3.18-3.20, Ex. CL-77.\n\n173.\n\nFor all the foregoing reasons, the Arbitral Tribunal decides:\n\n174.\n\nNot to grant Claimant\u2019s request that Respondent be ordered to abstain from initiating criminal proceedings and/or suspend any current criminal proceedings against the former and current officials of Claimant and the companies affiliated with Claimant until the completion of the arbitration.\n\n175.\n\nNot to grant Claimant\u2019s request that Respondent be ordered to refrain from contacting the shareholders, officials and employees of Claimant and Manolium-Engineering, without the consent of Claimant and prior authorization of the Tribunal.

Dolgov of 28 February 2019 (**CWS-5)** [\"**Dolgov IV**\"], para. 102).\n\n57.\n\nOn 14 October 2013, the Minsk Municipality and Minsktrans jointly filed a claim to terminate the Investment Contract before the Economic Court of Minsk.17 A year thereafter, the Court rendered a judgement terminating the Investment Contract [the \"**Termination Decision**\"].18 The ruling was confirmed by the Appellate Division of the Economic Court of Minsk on 29 October 2014 [the \"**Appellate Court Decision**\"]19 and by the Supreme Court of the Republic of Belarus on 27 January 2015 [the \"**Cassation Decision**\"].20\n\nC I, para. 256; Statement of claim to terminate the Investment Contract of 14 October 2013, filed with the Economic Court of Minsk on 12 November 2013 (Doc. **C-140/R-201**).\n\nJudgement of the Economic Court of Minsk of 9 September 2014 (Doc. **C-147**).\n\nJudgement of the Appellate Division of the Economic Court of Minsk of 29 October 2014 (Docs. **C-150** and **TT-6**).\n\nResolution of the Supreme Court of the Republic of Belarus of 27 January 2016 (Doc. **C-152**).\n\n58.\n\nThe termination resulted in all parties being discharged of their obligations under the Investment Contract.21 However, since the Facilities had been constructed on municipal land and the Minsk Municipality wished to use them, Manolium-E had to be reimbursed for the construction costs.\n\nC I, para. 523; Code of the Republic of Belarus No. 218-Z \"Civil Code of the Republic of Belarus\" of 7 December 1998 (Doc. **RL-127**), Art. 423 and (Doc. **CL-155**), Art. 682; Transcript of the hearing held in this matter from 29 July to 1 August 2019 [\"**HT**\"] Day 1, 148:3-21; 263:5-12; R II, paras. 264-265; R III, paras. 381-386, 438 and 806.\n\n59.\n\nDifferent government agencies issued reports valuing the Facilities: the Republican Unitary Enterprise \"Minsk City Agency for State Registration and Land Cadaster\" [the \"**Minsk Cadaster Agency**\"] issued a report, valuing the Facilities at USD 18.1 M.22 A few months later, in February 2016, the Ministry of Finance [the \"**MoF**\"] conducted an audit and issued a report [the \"**MoF Report**\"] reaching a similar conclusion: the cost incurred by Manolium-E in the construction of the Facilities amounted to USD 19.4 M.23\n\nExpert Report No. 3 of the Minsk Cadaster Agency of 16 June 2015 (Doc. **C-154**), p. 43.\n\nReport of the Ministry of Finance of 22 February 2016 (Doc. **C-160**), p. 15.\n\n60.\n\nDespite these reports, the Minsk Municipality was reluctant to use the municipal budget to pay for the Facilities, which under the Investment Contract should have been delivered free of charge into municipal ownership.\n\n61.\n\nThe Minsk Municipality proposed to the Council of Ministers of the Republic of Belarus that Claimant be invited to transfer the Facilities to the Municipality for free; otherwise, the Minsk Municipality would enforce the tax imposed on owners or users of land under Belarusian law [the \"**Land Tax**\"] calculated at a penalty rate, which Manolium-E had failed to pay, and other outstanding liabilities, against Manolium-E.24\n\nLetter from MCEC to the Council of Ministers of the Republic of Belarus of 29 February 2016 (Doc. **R-140**), pp. 2-3.\n\n62.\n\nThe proposal was accepted and immediately executed. On 2 March 2016, the Minsk Municipality issued administrative offense reports,25 and then commenced administrative court proceedings26 for the delayed return of the land plots on which the Facilities were located [the \"**Facilities Land Plots**\"].\n\nAdministrative Offence Reports of the MCEC Land Planning Service Nos. 17, 20 and 21 of 18 March 2016 (Docs. **C-343**, **C-344** and **C-345**).\n\nResolution of the Minsk City Court of 13 May 2016 (Doc. **C-162**); Resolution of the Minsk City Court of 14 June 2016 (Doc. **C-163**); Appeal of Manolium-E against the 17 May 2016 Ruling of the Court of the Pervomaysky District of Minsk of 9 June 2016 (Doc. **C-183**); Resolution of the Minsk City Court of 3 August 2016 (Doc. **C-184**).\n\n63.\n\nBased on these administrative offences, the Belarusian tax authorities conducted a tax audit on Manolium-E, which resulted in the imposition of the accrued Land Tax for the unauthorized occupation of the Facilities Land Plots and penalties.27 In total, the tax liabilities exceeded the value of the Facilities.\n\nLetter from the Tax Inspectorate to Manolium-E of 21 June 2016 (Doc. **C-165**); Amendments and supplements of 21 June 2016 to the desk tax audit report of Manolium-E No. 2-5/1299 dated 17 May 2016 (Doc. **C-166**).\n\n64.\n\nOn 5 July 2016, the Inspectorate of the Ministry of Taxes and Levies of the Republic of Belarus [the \"**Tax Inspectorate**\"] issued an order for the attachment of the Facilities28 [the \"**Attachment order**\"] and started court proceedings to recover Manolium-E\u2019s tax liability.29 On 18 August 2016, the Economic Court of Minsk ordered the enforcement of the tax liability against the Facilities [the \"Enforcement Order\"].30 On 20 January 2017, in execution of the Attachment Order and the Enforcement Order, the President of the Republic of Belarus ordered the transfer, without consideration, of the Facilities into the ownership of the Minsk Municipality, to set off Manolium-E\u2019s tax liability [the \"Presidential Order\"].31\n\nOrder No. 1110590 on attachment and/or seizure of property of 5 July 2016 (Doc. **C-167**).\n\nRequest of the Tax Inspectorate to institute writ proceedings for the recovery of 20,699,817.70 rubles at the expense of the payer's property of 20 July 2016 (Doc. **C-169**).\n\nRuling of the Economic Court of Minsk of 18 August 2016 (Doc. **C-170**).\n\nOrder No. 10rp-dsp of the President of the Republic of Belarus of 20 January 2017 (Doc. **R-242**).\n\n65.\n\nThe principal of Manolium-E\u2019s tax liability and part of the penalty were written off.32 But since Manolium-E still owed part of the tax penalty, the company was forced into bankruptcy.33 As a result of the bankruptcy proceedings, the Tax Inspectorate conducted a second tax audit on Manolium-E, which resulted in a new tax liability.34\n\nR II, paras. 349-350.\n\nLetter from MCEC to Manolium-E of 14 October 2016 (Doc. **C-8**); Official portal of the system of general jurisdiction courts of the Republic of Belarus, *Information on cases in connection with economic insolvency (bankruptcy) for the period from 1 February 2017 through 28 February 2017* (Doc. **C-179**).\n\nAmendments of 18 May 2017 to the Unscheduled field audit report of Manolium-E No. 543 dated 24 March 2017 (Doc. **C-186**); Unscheduled field audit report of Manolium-E in connection with economic insolvency (bankruptcy) of 24 March 2017 (Doc. **C-187**); Decision of the Tax Inspectorate No. 121 of 13 June 2017 on the unscheduled desk tax audit report of Manolium-E of 24 March 2017 No. 543 with amendments of 18 May 2017 (Doc. **C-188**); Letter from the Tax Inspectorate to Manolium-E of 22 September 2017 (Doc. **C-189**).\n\n66.\n\nThese facts will be further developed in the following two sections, separating the two disputes submitted by Claimant: the Termination Dispute (**1.**) and the Tax Dispute (**2.**). Thereafter, the Tribunal will devote two short sections to Manolium-E\u2019s bankruptcy (**3.**), and to the personal involvement of President Lukashenko (**4.**)\n\n**1.** **T****he** **T****ermination** **D****ispute**\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n67.\n\nThe first dispute submitted by Claimant refers to the termination of the Investment Contract. The Tribunal will analyze the terms of the Investment Contract (**1.1.**), and then describe the progress in the execution of the Investment Contract (**1.2.**), the negotiations between the Parties (**1.3**), the termination of the Investment Contract (**1.4**.) and the legal consequences of the termination of the Investment Contract (**1.5**).\n\n**1.1** **T****he terms of the** **I****nvestment** **C****ontract**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n68.\n\nOn 6 June 2003, Manolium, the Minsk Municipality and Minsktrans entered into the Investment Contract.35 Initially, the key terms of the Investment Contract were the following:\n\n- the Municipality granted the Investor *(i.e.,* Claimant) the right to develop a substantial real estate project, which included a mall and other public and residential facilities, on a municipal land plot located in the center of Minsk and owned by the Municipality (already defined as the Mall Land Plot);36\n\n- in exchange for this right, the Investor undertook to invest up to USD 15 M in the design, construction and reconstruction of certain facilities37 (a bus depot, a motor transport base and a building) on a municipal land plot and, upon construction, to transfer those facilities into municipal ownership;38 and\n\n- the Investor also agreed to provide financial or other assistance to public companies located in Minsk that were in unsatisfactory financial standing.39\n\nInvestment Contract (Doc. **C-34**).\n\nInvestment Contract (Doc. **C-34**), clause 1.\n\nInitially Claimant had to design, construct and reconstruct. *See* Investment Contract (Doc. **C-34**), clause 1.\n\nTender documentation of 24 April 2003 (Doc. **C-28**), clause 2.4.2; Investment Contract (Doc. **C-34**), clause 2.\n\nTender documentation of 24 April 2003 (Doc. **C-28**), clause 2.4.4; Investment Contract (Doc. **C-34**), clause 6.13.\n\n69.\n\nAlthough the parties signed the contract in June 2003, during the next three and a half years the project stalled: the design documents for the bus depot, drawn up in 2004, showed that the estimated construction cost of that single facility exceeded USD 12 M, which made it impossible for the Investor to build the totality of the contractually-agreed facilities by investing only USD 15 M - the ceiling agreed upon in the Investment Contract.40 The Investor and the Municipality were forced to renegotiate.\n\nTermination Decision (Doc. **C-147**), p. 2.\n\n70.\n\nThus, between 2003 and 2007, the terms of the Investment Contract were substantially changed through the signature of four amendments.41 The most relevant amendment was signed on 8 February 2007 [the \"**4th Amendment**\"]. This 4th Amendment reduced the scope of the facilities,42 but also increased Manolium-E\u2019s investment commitments.43 Two further amendments were signed in 2008 and 2011.44\n\nAdditional Agreement No. 1 of 10 October 2003 (Doc. **C-47**); Additional Agreement No. 2 of 22 October 2003 (Doc. **C-48**); Additional Agreement No. 3 of 25 November 2003 (Doc. **C-49**); Additional Agreement No. 4 of 8 February 2007 (Doc. **C-66**).\n\nInitially, Claimant agreed to construct the Depot and two other facilities: (i) a joint production base for motor cars with capacity for 450 buses on a land plot provided by the Minsk Municipality (Investment Contract (Doc. **C-34**), clause 2.2); and (ii) the design and reconstruction of the building located at 36 Mendeleeva St. to accommodate the administrative and management personnel of the company located on the Mall Land Plot, and a training center to prepare trolleybus and tram drivers (Investment Contract (Doc. **C-34**), clause 2.3). However, on 11 July 2006, the President approved changes to the list of facilities to be constructed (Resolution of the President of the Republic of Belarus of 11 July 2006 (Doc. **C-64**)), and on 8 February 2007, the Parties executed the 4th Amendment, by which they agreed that the facilities to be constructed would be the Depot, the Pull Station and the Road (Doc. **C-66**).\n\n4th Amendment (Doc. **C-66**), clause 8.\n\nAdditional Agreement No. 5 of 16 December 2008 (Doc. **C-72**); Additional Agreement No. 6 of 20 April 2011 (Doc. **C-76**).\n\n71.\n\nThe following section summarizes the terms of the Investment Contract as amended in 2011.\n\nParties\n-------\n\n72. .\n\nInitially, the Investment Contract was executed by Manolium, the Minsk Municipality and Minsktrans. However, in 2007 Manolium-E, Claimant\u2019s Belarusian subsidiary, was added as a party, assuming the obligation to implement the Investment Contract, construct the Facilities and develop the Mall, with the financing and under the supervision of Claimant.45\n\n4th Amendment (Doc. **C-66**), preamble, para. 2.\n\nObject\n------\n\n73.\n\nThe object of the Investment Contract was the construction by Manolium-E, with financing supplied by Claimant, of a Mall on a 6.5 hectare [\"**ha**\"] plot of land at Kiseleva - Krasnaya - Masherova streets in Minsk.46 The Mall Land Plot hosted the old trolleybus depot and a building located at 3 Masherova avenue,47 which Claimant had to buy from Minsktrans and demolish.48\n\n4th Amendment (Doc. **C-66**), clause 1.\n\n4th Amendment (Doc. **C-66**), clause 10.4-6.\n\n4th Amendment (Doc. **C-66**), clauses 8.15-17.\n\n74.\n\nThe Mall Land Plot was to be leased by the Minsk Municipality to Claimant.49 Claimant agreed to spend USD 81.6 M on the design and construction of the Mall.\n\n4th Amendment (Doc. **C-66**), clauses 7.9 and 9.3.8.\n\n75.\n\nIn exchange for the right to develop the Mall, Claimant agreed to payment in kind. It accepted to design, construct and finance three Facilities in Minsk:\n\n- the \"**Depot**\": a new trolley bus station with capacity for 220 trolley buses located in the Uruchye-6 microdistrict;50\n\n- the \"**Pull Station**\": a complete pull station with high voltage cable lines to supply electricity to the Depot and a trolley line along Gintovta street;51 and\n\n- the \"**Road**\": a road for the section of Gorodetskaya street reaching from Gintovta street up to the entrance into the Depot, together with all utility networks and a trolley line.52\n\nInvestment Contract (Doc. **C-34**), clause 2.\n\n4th Amendment (Doc. **C-66**), para. 3 and clause 2.2.\n\n4th Amendment (Doc. **C-66**), para. 3 and clause 2.3.\n\n76.\n\nThe Investor undertook to transfer the Facilities into the communal ownership of the city of Minsk, once the construction had been executed, the buildings commissioned and the property registered in the Unified State Registry of Immovable Property of the Republic of Belarus [the \"**Immovable Property Registry**\"].53\n\n4th Amendment (Doc. **C-66**), clause 2.\n\n77.\n\nClaimant had initially agreed to spend a maximum of USD 15 M to build the Facilities.54 However, this contractual provision was materially changed in the 4th Amendment.55 In exchange for a reduction in the scope of the Facilities, Claimant and Manolium-E assumed the obligation to design and build the Facilities, even if the cost exceeded USD 15 M,56 and additionally agreed to compensate the Minsk Municipality if the required investment was less than USD 15 M.57\n\nInvestment Contract (Doc. **C-34**), clause 2.\n\n4th Amendment (Doc. **C-66**), clauses 7.10, 8.19 and 11.\n\nClaimant alleges that it agreed to the changes to the Investment Contract because it had already spent USD 3 M on the design of the Facilities and the Mall and did not want to risk losing this investment.

In July 2010, Manolium-E and Minsktrans signed an agreement, under which Manolium-E granted Minsktrans \"gratuitous temporary use\" of the Pull Station, so that Minsktrans could operate and maintain it until formal transfer into the communal ownership of Minsk.96 At the end of the month, the Pull Station was commissioned for operation,97 and on 1 October 2010 the building was registered in the Immovable Property Registry.98\n\nDecision of MCEC No. 1129(2) of 30 May 2008 (Doc. **C-97**).\n\nPermission No. 2-2064-042/08 for construction and installation works of 19 August 2009 (Doc. **C-98**).\n\nAgreement on Temporary Gratuitous Use of Property between Minsktrans and Manolium-E of 6 July 2010 (Doc. **C-99**).\n\nAct of Acceptance of completed building of 30 July 2010 (Doc. **C-100**).\n\nExtract from the registry book on rights, limitations (encumbrances) of rights for permanent structure of the Immovable Property Registry of 1 October 2010 (Doc. **C-101**).\n\n90.\n\nUnder the Investment Contract, the Minsk Municipality was obliged to accept the Pull Station into communal ownership within one month of the date of commissioning or registration in the Immovable Property Registry.99 Thus, on 11 October 2010, Claimant requested that the Minsk Municipality accept the Pull Station into communal ownership.100 Minsktrans refused to do so,101 stating that it would only consider such acceptance once the Pull Station had been in operation for a year (*i.e.*, by July 2011).\n\n4th Amendment (Doc. **C-66**), clause 9.3.3.\n\nLetter from Manolium-E to MCEC of 11 October 2010 (Doc. **C-102**).\n\nLetter from Minsktrans to Manolium-E of 17 November 2010 (Doc. **C-104**).\n\n91.\n\nThereafter, Minsktrans continued refusing acceptance, providing different reasons (e.g. that there were outstanding defects, that the Pull Station was still working at a fraction of its capacity).102 Notwithstanding repeated attempts by Manolium-E to force acceptance of the Pull Station into communal ownership, the Minsk Municipality refused to accept the facility, and when the Investment Contract was eventually terminated, the Pull Station was still registered in the name of Claimant, while the \"right of economic management for permanent construction\" corresponded to Manolium-E.103\n\nLetter from Minsktrans to Manolium-E of 22 July 2011 (Doc. **C-78**); Letter from Minsktrans to Manolium-E of 19 September 2011 (Doc. **C-105**); Letter from Manolium-E to MCEC of 11 August 2011 (Doc. **C-106**); Letter from Manolium-E to MCEC of 11 October 2011 (Doc. **C-107**); Letter from Manolium-E to MCEC of 12 October 2011 (Doc. **C-80**); Letter from Manolium-E to the State Control Committee of the Republic of Belarus of 21 October 2011 (Doc. **C-108**); Letter from Minsktrans to Manolium-E of 27 October 2011 (Doc. **C-81**); Letter from Minsktrans to Manolium-E of 31 October 2011 (Doc. **C-109**); Letter from Manolium-E to MCEC of 28 October 2013 (Doc. **C-319**).\n\nC I, para. 212.\n\n92.\n\nIn accordance with the agreement for the gratuitous use of the Pull Station, Minsktrans accepted the Pull Station for temporary gratuitous use and assumed the obligation to maintain and operate the facility until its transfer into the communal ownership of Minsk.104 However, it is unclear whether after the termination of the Investment Contract *de facto* possession of the Pull Station was returned to Manolium-E, and whether Minsktrans continued to operate and maintain the Pull Station.\n\nAgreement on Temporary Gratuitous Use of Property between Minsktrans and Manolium-E of 6 July 2010 (Doc. **C-99**), clauses 1.1 and 6.1.\n\n**B.** **The Road**\n-------------------\n\n93.\n\nManolium-E was granted the Land Permit that allowed the temporary possession of the land plot where the Road was to be constructed on 2 May 2008,105 and five months later - on 31 October 2008 -the Construction Permit was granted.106 On 1 July 2011, within the deadline established in the Investment Contract, Claimant completed the works on the Road, and a committee with various municipal authorities was created to supervise commissioning.107\n\nExtract from Decision of MCEC No. 951 of 2 May 2008 (Doc. **C-86**).\n\nPermission No. 2-2064-034/08 issued by Gosstroy on 29 May 2008 (Doc. **C-87**).\n\nOrder No. 1-C of Manolium-E of 1 July 2011 (Doc. **C-91**).\n\n94.\n\nUnder the Investment Contract, acceptance into communal ownership should have occurred within one month of commissioning. *De facto* acceptance of the Road must have happened, because by 2012 the Road was in public use.108 However, formal transfer into municipal ownership never occurred. The file shows that on 13 December 2011, in preparation for such a transfer, Minsktrans requested that Claimant provide a calculation of the costs incurred.109 However, the file is silent on the subsequent communications between the Parties, and it is undisputed that, by the time of the termination of the Investment Contract, transfer of the Road into communal ownership had still not been formalized.110\n\nGeneral view of the Facilities Land Plots (Google Earth shot) as of 29 May 2011 (Doc. **C-331**) shows cars parked on the Road.

The parties first tried to extend the Investment Contract (**A.**), and then considered terminating the Investment Contract and signing a new contract for the development of the Mall (**B.**) None of the solutions proved acceptable.\n\n**A.** **Negotiations to extend the Investment Contract**\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n108.\n\nDuring the first year - July 2011 until June 2012 - the parties\u2019 negotiations were focused on the signature of a new supplemental agreement extending the deadline to finalize the Facilities.\n\n109.\n\nNegotiations were fraught with difficulties: the Municipality was not prepared to offer additional time periods to finish construction,135 rejected the renewal of Constructions Permits136 and requested that if Manolium failed to complete the Facilities within the extended deadline, as a penalty the city of Minsk would receive the Facilities free of charge.137\n\nLetter from MCEC to Claimant and Manolium-E of 6 April 2012 (Doc. **R-80**); R III, para. 287; Letter from MCEC to Claimant with draft Supplemental Agreement to the [Investment] Contract of 18 June 2012 (Doc. **R-89**), p. 3; Letter from MCEC to Claimant of 18 June 2012 (Doc. **C-126**).\n\nLetter from MCEC Construction and Investment Committee to Manolium-E of 5 July 2012 (Doc. **R-90**); Letter from Gosstroy to Manolium-E of 21 April 2012 (Doc. **C-127**); Letter from Manolium-E to Gosstroy of 25 April 2012 (Doc. **R-84**).\n\nLetter from MCEC to Claimant and Manolium-E of 6 April 2012 (Doc. **R-80**); Letter from MCEC to Claimant with draft Supplemental Agreement to the [Investment] Contract of 18 June 2012 (Doc. **R-89**), para. 1; Letter from MCEC to Claimant of 18 June 2012 (Doc. **C-126**), p. 3.\n\n110.\n\nClaimant refused to sign a new agreement under such terms138 and in July 2012, Mr. Ekavyan, Claimant\u2019s ultimate shareholder and Director, made his last offer: he proposed to invest an additional USD 3.6 M to finalize the Facilities by December 2012, but in exchange requested ownership (and not simply a lease) over the Mall Land Plot.139 On 26 July 2012, the Minsk Municipality rejected Mr. Ekavyan\u2019s final offer.140\n\nLetter from Manolium-E to MCEC of 30 April 2012 (Doc. **R-85**).\n\nLetter from Claimant to MCEC of June 2012 (Doc. **R-88**).\n\nLetter from MCEC to Claimant of 26 July 2012 (Doc. **R-92**).\n\n**B.** **Negotiations to terminate the Investment Contract by mutual consent**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n111.\n\nA few days later, on 2 August 2012, the Minsk Municipality met with Mr. Dolgov, a Director of Manolium-E,141 and this time the termination of the Investment Contract by mutual agreement, with compensation to the Investor for the costs incurred, was also discussed.142 No decision was recorded, but termination plus compensation seems to have been the preferred choice.\n\nMinutes of the Meeting Regarding Implementation of the Investment Project by Manolium of 2 August 2012 (Doc. **R-93**).\n\nMinutes of the Meeting Regarding Implementation of the Investment Project by Manolium of 2 August 2012 (Doc. **R-93**), p. 1.\n\n112.\n\nThe termination of the Investment Contract by mutual consent implied that three different issues had to be settled:\n\n- the compensation of Manolium-E\u2019s construction costs (**a.**);\n\n- the fate of the Mall (**b.**); and\n\n- the *de iure* transfer of the Facilities into municipal ownership (**c.**).\n\n**a. Compensation of Manolium-E\u2019s construction costs**\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n113.\n\nThe first issue addressed by the parties to the Investment Contract was how to establish the compensation owed to Manolium-E for the construction of the Facilities. Two different valuations were prepared.\n\n114.\n\nFirst, Minsktrans (with the support of the State-owned Center for Pricing in the Construction Sector) estimated, using the certificates of completion, that the total costs of construction and purchase of equipment amounted to USD 14.7 M.143\n\nLetter from Minsktrans to MCEC of 14 September 2012 (Doc. **R-95**) and Letter from Minsktrans to Manolium-E of 14 September 2012 (Doc. **C-326**). Minsktrans initially made a valuation of USD 13.5 M (Letter from Minsktrans to Manolium-E of 28 August 2012 (Doc. **C-128**)), but Manolium-E responded to this valuation with an alternative calculation of USD 16.3 (Letter from Manolium-E to Minsktrans of 11 September 2012 (Doc. **R-94**)), and Minsktrans accepted the inclusion of certain items and updated its valuation to USD 14.7 M.\n\n115.\n\nManolium-E considered that the Minsktrans valuation underestimated the construction costs.144 Thus, with the approval of the Minsk Municipality,145 Manolium-E created a commission - formed by the Municipality, Manolium-E and the independent audit firm Paritet-Standart - to carry out an independent audit.146 By early November 2012, Paritet-Standart issued a report finding that as of 31 October 2012 the amount invested by Manolium-E was equivalent to USD 18.3 M.147\n\nFirst witness statement of A.

The fate of the Mall**\n---------------------------\n\n116.\n\nDespite having agreed to the preparation of these two valuations, the Minsk Municipality was not eager to spend several million USD from its own budget to compensate Claimant for the construction of the Facilities. Its intention remained to secure the Facilities free of charge,148 and in exchange to entice Claimant to develop the Mall.\n\nLetter from MCEC to Claimant of 7 June 2013 (Doc. **R-108**).\n\n117.\n\nBy the end of 2012, the Minsk Municipality and Minsktrans proposed to terminate the existing Investment Contract by mutual agreement, and to execute a new investment contract for the development of the Mall,149 insisting that this was the best solution.150\n\nMinutes of a meeting on the implementation of an investment project by Claimant of 5 December 2012 (Doc. **R-97**), paras. 4-5; Letter from MCEC to Claimant of 10 December 2012 (Doc. **C-132**) and attached draft investment contract (Doc. **R-98**); Letter from MCEC to Manolium-E of 18 January 2013 (Doc. **C-134**).\n\nLetter from MCEC to Claimant of 11 March 2013 (Doc. **C-137**).\n\n118.\n\nThe offer was not well received by Claimant. By then Manolium had lost interest in the development of the Mall under the terms of the Investment Contract and, thus, \"found no economic sense in signing a new investment contract\".151 It was however willing to accept development of the Mall Land Plot under its own terms152 or without having to pay a lease.153\n\nLetter from Claimant to MCEC of 19 March 2013 (Doc. **C-83**).\n\nLetter from Claimant to MCEC of 19 March 2013 (Doc. **C-83**).\n\nLetter from Claimant to MCEC of June 2012 (Doc. **R-88**).\n\n119.\n\nClaimant tried to break the deadlock by appealing to the President of the Republic. On 4 September 2013, Manolium wrote directly to President Lukashenko, representing that it had invested USD 20 M in the Facilities and accusing the Minsk Municipality of refusing to accept the Facilities into municipal ownership.154 Claimant asked the President to remedy the situation and offered two solutions:\n\n- either termination by mutual agreement of the Investment Contract and compensation of Manolium-E\u2019s costs and expenses, or, as compensation for its investment,\n\n- the free transfer by Presidential decree of the Mall Land Plot.155\n\nLetter from Claimant to the President of the Republic of Belarus of 4 September 2013 (Doc. **R-109**).\n\nLetter from Claimant to the President of the Republic of Belarus of 4 September 2013 (Doc. **R-109**).\n\n120.\n\nThe record does not show any reaction either from President Lukashenko or his office.\n\n**c. The Minsk Municipality\u2019s refusal to transfer the Facilities into municipal ownership**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n121.\n\nOne of the main obligations of the Minsk Municipality under the Investment Contract was the acceptance of the Facilities into municipal ownership within one month of their commissioning or registration in the Immovable Property Registry.156\n\n4th Amendment (**Doc. C-66**), clauses 2.3 and 9.3.9.\n\n122.\n\nDuring 2012 and 2013, when the negotiations to terminate the Investment Contract took place, Minsktrans was *de facto* in possession of the Pull Station and the completed parts of the Depot, while the Road was in public use. Thus, *de facto* possession of all completed Facilities lay with Minsktrans or the Minsk Municipality.\n\n123.\n\n*Pro memoria,* the Pull Station was completed in June 2010 and on 6 July 2010 Manolium-E temporarily transferred *de facto* possession to Minsktrans through an agreement on gratuitous temporary use.157 On 30 July 2010, the Pull Station was commissioned for operation158 and, on 8 October 2010, it was registered in the Immovable Property Registry.159 Having fulfilled its contractual duties, Claimant had requested that the Municipality take *de iure* possession of the Pull Station by accepting the transfer of title on numerous occasions,160 but the Municipality repeatedly refused to do so.161\n\nAgreement on Temporary Gratuitous Use of Property between Minsktrans and Manolium-E of 6 July 2010 (Doc. **C-99**).\n\nAct of Acceptance of completed building of 30 July 2010 (Doc. **C-100**).\n\nExtract from the registry book on rights, limitations (encumbrances) of rights for permanent structure of the Immovable Property Registry of 1 October 2010 (Doc. **C-101**).\n\nLetter from Manolium-E to MCEC of 11 August 2011 (Doc. **C-106**); Letter from Manolium-E to MCEC of 11 October 2011 (Doc. **C-102/107**); Letter from Manolium-E to MCEC of 21 October 2010 (Doc. **C-103**); Letter from Manolium-E to the State Control Committee of the Republic of Belarus of 21 October 2011 (Doc. **C-108**); Letter from Manolium-E to MCEC of 28 October 2013 (Doc. **C-319**).\n\nLetter from Minsktrans to Manolium-E of 17 November 2010 (Doc. **C-104**); Letter from Minsktrans to Manolium-E of 22 July 2011 (Doc. **C-78**); Letter from Minsktrans to Manolium-E of 19 September 2011 (Doc. **C-105**); Letter from Minsktrans to Manolium-E of 27 October 2011 (Doc. **C-81**); Letter from Minsktrans to Manolium-E of 31 October 2011 (Doc. **C-109**).\n\n124.\n\nAs for the Road, on 1 July 2011 Claimant completed works on the Road, and created a committee to supervise commissioning by the municipal authorities.162 By 2012, the Road was in public use.163 Thus, *de facto* possession of the Road laid with the Municipality. However, *de iure* transfer had not taken place.164\n\nOrder No. 1-C of Manolium-E of 1 July 2011 (Doc. **C-91**).\n\nGeneral view of the Facilities Land Plots (Google Earth shot) as of 29 May 2011 (Doc. **C-331**) shows cars parked on the Road. Also, the Tests on pavement of the Road conducted on 22 August 2012 (Doc. **C-318**) rendered positive results.\n\nOn 13 December 2011, in preparation for such transfer, Minsktrans requested that Claimant provide a calculation of the costs incurred (Letter from Minsktrans to Manolium-E of 13 December 2011 (Doc. **C-92**)). However, the file is silent on the subsequent communications between the parties on the Road transfer (Letter from Claimant to MCEC of 19 March 2013 (Doc. **C-83**); Letter from Claimant to MCEC of 27 May 2013 (Doc. **C-93**); Letter from Claimant to MCEC of 27 June 2013 (Doc. **C-94**); Letter from Claimant to MCEC of 18 July 2014 (Doc. **C-95**)).\n\n125.\n\nFinally, as regards the Depot, Manolium-E completed the administrative block by 1 July 2011,165 and the checkpoint, by October 2011166 (the production block was never completed). On 14 November 2011, Manolium-E and Minsktrans entered into an agreement under which Minsktrans assumed *de facto* temporary and gratuitous possession of the two finalized buildings.167 However, title to the Depot had not been transferred to the Minsk Municipality.\n\nThese facilities were completed by 29 June 2011 (Letter from Manolium-E to MCEC of 29 June 2011 (Doc. **C-77**)), but Minsktrans refused to transfer ownership and put them into operation as an independent facility, pointing to electric defects (Letter from Minsktrans to Manolium-E of 22 July 2011 (Doc. **C-78**)).\n\nLetter from Manolium-E to MCEC of 12 October 2011 (Doc. **C-80**); Acts of Working Commission's Facility Acceptance of 5 September 2011 and 14 October 2011 (Docs. **C-314** and **C-315**).\n\nAgreement on Gratuitous Use of Property between Manolium-E and Minsktrans of 14 November 2011 (Doc. **C-82**), clause 5.2; R II, para. 144. Once the Investment Contract was terminated, the parties terminated their gratuitous transfer agreement by mutual consent, and Manolium-E regained *de facto* possession of the finalized buildings on 30 December 2014 (Agreement of 30 December 2014 on termination of Agreement for the Gratuitous Use of Property dated 14 November 2011 (Doc. **C-84**)).\n\n126.\n\nDuring the spring and summer of 2013, Manolium-E repeatedly requested the Minsk Municipality to formally accept the Facilities into communal ownership.168 However, none of its requests were accepted,169 the Municipality insisting that transfer should be free of charge.170\n\nLetter from Claimant to MCEC of 19 March 2013 (Doc. **C-83**); Letter from Claimant to MCEC of 27 May 2013 (Doc. **C-93**); Letter from Claimant to MCEC of 27 June 2013 (Doc. **C-94**). Claimant's shareholders approved the transfer in a general assembly held on 12 June 2013 (Minutes of General Participants Meeting of 12 June 2013 (Doc. **C-342**)).\n\nLetter from MCEC to Claimant of 7 June 2013 (Doc. **R-108**).\n\nLetter from Minsktrans to Manolium-E of 26 March 2013 (Doc. **C-338**); Letter from MCEC to Manolium-E of 28 March 2013 (Doc. **C-339**); Letter from MCEC to Manolium-E of 9 April 2013 (Doc. **R-107**).\n\n**1.4** **T****he** **T****ermination of the** **I****nvestment** **C****ontract**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n127.\n\nThe negotiations to amend the Investment Contract or sign a new agreement being in deadlock, on 12 November 2013 the Minsk Municipality and Minsktrans filed a claim before the Economic Court of Minsk against Claimant and Manolium-E, requesting the termination of the Investment Contract.171\n\nStatement of claim to terminate the Investment Contract of 14 October 2013, filed with the Economic Court of Minsk on 12 November 2013 (Doc. **C-140/R-201**).\n\n128.\n\nIn essence, the Minsk Municipality and Minsktrans alleged that they had complied with their contractual obligations, while Claimant and Manolium-E had only partially performed and had ceased construction of the Facilities in June 2012.172 The Minsk Municipality asserted that Manolium had no intention to continue construction of the Facilities or to develop the Mall, and thus requested the termination of the Investment Contract.173\n\nStatement of claim to terminate the Investment Contract of 14 October 2013, filed with the Economic Court of Minsk on 12 November 2013 (Doc. **C-140/R-201**), p. 2.\n\nStatement of claim to terminate the Investment Contract of 14 October 2013, filed with the Economic Court of Minsk on 12 November 2013 (Doc. **C-140/R-201**), p. 3.\n\n129.\n\nClaimant and Manolium-E filed their statement of defense, requesting that the claim be dismissed.174 Claimant and Manolium-E argued that the execution of the Investment Contract had been delayed because the Contract had to be renegotiated, and that most of the Facilities had been finalized and were in fact being used on a free-of-charge basis by Minsktrans.175 Finally, Claimant and Manolium-E also explained that on 1 July 2011, the Land Permits to the Facilities Land Plots expired and thus, there was no possibility to continue construction of the Depot.176\n\nStatement of defense of Manolium-E in case No. 399-3/2013 (Doc. **R-102**).\n\nStatement of defense of Manolium-E in case No. 399-3/2013 (Doc. **R-102**), p. 3.\n\nStatement of defense of Manolium-E in case No. 399-3/2013 (Doc. **R-102**), p. 3.\n\n130.\n\nOn 9 September 2014, the Economic Court of Minsk rendered its Termination Decision. It declared the following facts as proven:177\n\n- the Pull Station, in operation since 30 July 2010, operated at no more than 1% of the design capacity; this facility had not been accepted into municipal ownership, because the list of equipment provided by Claimant did not correspond to the actual equipment and because technical maintenance problems had not been resolved; and\n\n- construction of the Road had been completed, but the trolleybus line had not been put into operation due to the lack of an approval from the State Construction Supervision authorities.\n\nTermination Decision (Doc. **C-147**), p. 4.\n\n131.\n\nNo reference to the status of the Depot was made in the decision.178 The Court concluded that Claimant and Manolium-E \"ha[d] not fulfilled the obligation to construct and transfer the communal facilities [...] into ownership of the City of Minsk\"179, arguing that, under the Civil Code, Manolium-E\u2019s obligations to design and build the Facilities could only be considered as fulfilled if all three Facilities were finalized and transferred, and not parts thereof.180\n\nStatement of claim to terminate the Investment Contract of 14 October 2013, filed with the Economic Court of Minsk on 12 November 2013 (Doc. **C-140/R-201**), p. 2.\n\nTermination Decision (Doc. **C-147**), p. 4.\n\nTermination Decision (Doc. **C-147**), p. 4.\n\n132.\n\nThe Court further analyzed whether the delays in the construction of the Facilities could be attributed to the Minsk Municipality, and thus, whether Manolium-E could be exonerated of responsibility or could be granted further time for completion of the works.181 However, since the Court found no evidence of delays in the Minsk Municipality\u2019s performance of the Investment Contract, it concluded that no extension of the terms of construction could be granted.182\n\nClause 5.4 of the Investment Contract (Doc. **C-34)** provides that:  \n\"In the event of untimely (delayed) performance by Mingorispolkom, Communal Unitary Enterprise Minsktrans of their obligations contained in this contract, acts (omission) on the part of competent communal bodies of Minsk preventing proper performance of the investment project, the deadlines of performing the works of designing, constructing and commissioning the facilities specified in Sub-Clauses 6.1-6.2 of this Clause shall be proportionately extended by a reasonable period necessary to properly perform the terms and conditions of this contract. Provided that the Investor shall not be deemed to be in delay in performance.\"\n\nTermination Decision (Doc. **C-147**), p. 4.\n\n133.\n\nAs regards the Mall, the Court rejected Claimant\u2019s argument that a significant increase in the amount to be invested prevented the timely implementation of the project.183 The Court also found that Claimant and Manolium-E had breached the time limits to develop the Mall, and that such breaches were unreasonable and unrelated to the actions of the Minsk Municipality, Minsktrans or third parties.184\n\nTermination Decision (Doc. **C-147**), pp. 4-5.\n\nTermination Decision (Doc. **C-147**), p. 5.\n\n134.\n\nAs a result of the Court\u2019s conclusions, it rendered a judgement terminating the Investment Contract.185\n\nTermination Decision (Doc. **C-147**).\n\n135.\n\nThe ruling was confirmed by the Appellate Court on 29 October 2014, and on that date, pursuant to its own terms186 and Art. 204 of the Belarusian Code of Commercial Procedure,187 the decision became effective.\n\nAppellate Court Decision (Docs. **C-150** and **TT-6**), p. 5:  \n\"Thus, the conclusions reached by the court of first instance are consistent with the circumstances of the case, rules of the substantive and procedural law, have been applied correctly and the court has appraised all the parties' arguments in full. Hence, there are no grounds for upholding the appeal.  \nIn view of the foregoing and being guided by Articles 279-281 of the Economic Procedural Code of the Republic of Belarus the Appellate Division of the Minsk Economic Court has DECIDED that:  \nThe September 9, 2014, decision of the Minsk Economic Court in Case No.399-3/2014, shall be affirmed and the appeal filed by foreign trade and production unitary enterprise Manolium-Engineering shall be held against.  \nThe judgment shall come into effect since its passing and may be appealed under the cassation procedure within one month from the judgment passing.\"\n\nCode of Commercial Procedure of the Republic of Belarus No. 219-Z of 15 December 1998 (Doc. **RL-50**), Art. 204:  \n\"Entry into force of a judgement considering economic cases  \nThe judgement of the court considering economic cases of the first instance, unless otherwise established by this Code or other legislative acts, enters into force upon the expiration of fifteen days from the date of its adoption, unless an appeal is filed.

This implied that from a legal perspective Manolium-E became an unauthorized user of publicly owned land.\n\n154.\n\nThis unauthorized use215 triggered the filing by the Minsk Municipality of an administrative proceeding under Art. 23.42 of the Code of Administrative Offenses, a provision which states that delays in the return of temporarily occupied lands constitutes an administrative offence [the \"**First Administrative Proceeding**\"].216\n\nLand Code of the Republic of Belarus of 23 July 2008, No. 425-3 (edition in force between 13 January 2011 and 25 April 2013) (Doc. **CL- 152**), Art. 72, reproduced in note 209 *supra*.\n\nResolution of Pervomaysky District Court of Minsk of 23 July 2012 (Doc. **C-346**), p. 1.\n\n155.\n\nA few months later, in June 2012, while the First Administrative Proceeding was pending, the negotiations to extend the term of the Investment Contract broke down.\n\n156.\n\nManolium-E reacted by sending a letter dated 11 June 2012 to the Minsk Municipality, in which it offered to return the land on which the Facilities had been constructed:217\n\n\"[W]e return the land plots to the lands of the City of Minsk in connection with non-extension of the investment contract\".\n\nLetter from Manolium-E to MCEC of 11 June 2012 (Doc. **C-336**).\n\n157.\n\nHowever, about a month later, on 17 July 2012, the Municipality wrote to Manolium-E, rejecting the return of the Facilities Land Plots. The reason given was that an uncompleted facility - the Depot - was located on that land.218 The Municipality added that the return of the Facilities Land Plots could be considered when the Investment Contract was terminated:219\n\n\"Considering that an uncompleted construction facility is located on the land plots in question (the facility has neither been commissioned, nor transferred to the communal property), a return of the land plots is impossible.\n\nAt the same time, we hereby inform that the question of conveyancing of the land plots can be considered when terminating the investment contract of 06 June 2003 and transferring the customer\u2019s functions to a different party\".\n\nLetter from Minsk Land Planning Service to Manolium-E of 17 July 2012 (Doc. **C-337**).\n\nLetter from Minsk Land Planning Service to Manolium-E of 17 July 2012 (Doc. **C-337**), paras. 2 and 3.\n\nThe Pervomaysky Court finds for Manolium-E\n------------------------------------------\n\n158.\n\nOn 23 July 2012, the Pervomaysky District Court in Minsk issued its decision in the First Administrative Proceeding, finding that Manolium-E was not liable for failing to meet the deadline to return the Facilities Land Plots [the \"**Pervomaysky Decision**\"].220 The Court found that Manolium-E had taken measures to return the Land Plots and had used its best efforts to resolve the situation, yet under the circumstances - non-extension of the Investment Contract, absence of a construction permit and the Minsk Municipality\u2019s refusal to accept the return of the Facilities Land Plots - it had no chance to discharge its duty.221\n\nResolution of Pervomaysky District Court of Minsk of 23 July 2012 (Doc. **C-346**).\n\nPervomaysky Decision (Doc. **C-346**), p. 2.\n\nFurther request\n---------------\n\n159.\n\nThe situation reached an *impasse.* Under Belarusian law, there is no legal procedure which permits a constructor, whose Land Permit has expired, to unilaterally return the land to the public owner.222 A written offer (as made by Manolium-E in its letter of 11 June 2012)223 is insufficient; the proper procedure under Art. 72 of the 2008 Land Code of the Republic of Belarus requires that the municipality formally adopt a decision to accept the offer and withdraw the Facilities Land Plots - something which the Minsk Municipality refused to do.224\n\n*See* paras. 144-147 *supra*.\n\nLetter from Minsk Land Planning Service to Manolium-E of 11 June 2012 (Doc. **C-336**).\n\nLand Code of the Republic of Belarus of 23 July 2008, No. 425-3 (edition in force between 13 January 2011 and 25 April 2013) (Doc. **CL-152**), Art. 72.\n\n160.\n\nFour years later, when the Investment Contract had already been terminated, Manolium-E again took up the issue, insisting on the return of the Facilities Land Plots: in a letter dated 19 September 2016, Manolium-E formally requested once more that the Minsk Municipality accept the offer and withdraw the Facilities Land Plots.225\n\nLetter from Manolium-E to MCEC of 19 September 2016 (Doc. **C-340**).\n\n161.\n\nThe Minsk Municipality again denied the return of the Facilities Land Plots by letter of 29 September 2016, explaining *inter alia* that226 the court decision to terminate the Investment Contract never considered the withdrawal of the Facilities Land Plots and that Manolium-E still had property located there, a situation that ruled out return of the Land Plots.\n\nLetter from MCEC to Manolium-E of 29 September 2016 (Doc. **C-341**).\n\n**2.2 T****he** **L****and** **T****ax starts to accrue**\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n162.\n\nStarting on 1 January 2013, companies using a simplified taxation system were required to pay Land Tax if they held over 0.5 hectares of land. As has been explained above, such Land Tax accrued at a penalty rate on certain plots.227\n\nSee para. 149 *supra*.\n\n163.\n\nIt is undisputed that on 1 January 2013:\n\n- Manolium-E used a simplified taxation system and held over 0.5 ha of land;\n\n- Manolium-E\u2019s Land Permit granting it a right to the temporary use of the Facilities Land Plots had expired on 1 July 2011;\n\n- Manolium-E\u2019s attempt to return the Facilities Land Plots had been unsuccessful, the Minsk Municipality refusing to accept the withdrawal of such Plots; and\n\n- the Facilities Land Plots held unfinished construction works - the Depot, for which construction permits had expired.228\n\nManolium-E's construction permits expired on 30 December 2011 (Permit No. 2-206Ch-067-07 to perform construction and assembly works issued by Gosstroy on 3 October 2011 (Doc. **R-71**)) and 1 September 2011 (Site Profile 2-206Ch-034 issued by Gosstroy (Doc. **R-36**)). Manolium-E made several requests to have the construction permits renewed (Letter from Manolium-E to Gosstroy of 13 April 2012 (Doc. **R-81**); Letter from Manolium-E to Gosstroy of 25 April 2012 (Doc. **R-84**)) and the terms of construction extended (Letter from Manolium-E to MCEC of 17 April 2012 (Doc. **R-83**); Letter from Manolium-E to MCEC of 18 May 2012 (Doc. **R-87**)). All petitions were denied (Letter from Gosstroy to Manolium-E of 21 April 2012 (Doc. **C-127**); Letter from MCEC and the Construction and Investment Committee to Manolium-E of 5 June 2012 (Doc. **R-90**)).\n\n164.\n\nThus, given the new tax regulation as of 1 January 2013, the tax authorities could argue that Manolium-E was not only subject to the Land Tax, but also liable for the penalty rates (notwithstanding the fact that Manolium-E had *de facto* transferred possession of the Facilities to Minsktrans, that the company had offered to return the Facilities Land Plots to the Minsk Municipality, and that it is the Municipality which had refused to accept the withdrawal of the Facilities Land Plots).229\n\nLetter from Manolium-E to MCEC of 11 June 2012 (Doc. **C-336**).\n\n165.\n\nManolium-E\u2019s chief accountant flagged the situation,230 and on 21 February 2014 Manolium-E received two notices from the Tax Inspectorate requesting that it submit Land Tax calculations for the years 2013 and 2014 and pay the outstanding amounts.231 Relying on the Pervomaysky Decision, Manolium-E refused to do so.232\n\nWitness statement of [REDACTED] of 12 November 2018 (**RWS-3**), paras. 30-38; Internal Memorandum from Ms.[REDACTED] to Mr. Dolgov of 15 March 2013 (Doc. **R-7**).\n\nDemands of an officer of the Tax Inspectorate to Manolium-E for 2013 and 2014 of 21 February 2014 (Docs. **R-111** and **R-112**).\n\nSecond witness statement of A.

Claimant and the Minsk Municipality initiated a new round of negotiations; since the Contract had been terminated, the only outstanding issue was to agree the compensation due to Manolium-E for the costs incurred in the construction of the Facilities. The negotiations focused on this aspect.\n\n**A.** **Report from the Minsk Cadaster Agency**\n------------------------------------------------\n\n167.\n\nOn 4 February 2015, Mr. Ekavyan, Claimant's Director, and Mr. Dolgov, Manolium-E's Director, held a meeting with executives of the Minsk Municipality and the General Director of Minsktrans233 to discuss Manolium-E's compensation due to the termination of the Investment Contract. The meeting ended with the agreement234 to have a public appraisal organization (the Minsk Cadaster Agency) calculate the direct costs incurred in the construction of the Facilities, and based on such report, to establish the investor's compensation.\n\nMinutes of the meeting attended by MCEC, Minsktrans and Claimant on 4 February 2015 (Doc. **C-153**).\n\nMinutes of the meeting attended by MCEC, Minsktrans and Claimant on 4 February 2015 (Doc. **C-153**), para. 2.\n\n168.\n\nFour months later, on 16 June 2015, the Minsk Cadaster Agency issued its report, valuing the Facilities at USD 18.1 M.235\n\nExpert Report No. 3 of the Minsk Cadaster Agency of 16 June 2015 (Doc. **C-154**), p. 43.\n\n169.\n\nManolium-E promptly requested that the Minsk Municipality pay this amount, plus the USD 1 M paid to the National Library.236 However, on 7 August 2015, the Minsk Municipality refused,237 alleging *inter alia* that the report was not an independent assessment.238\n\nLetter from Manolium-E to MCEC of 17 June 2015 (Doc. **C-155**).\n\nThe Minsk Municipality seems to have based its refusal on two facts:  \n- the State Property Committee of the Republic of Belarus informed the Minsk Municipality that the R &C Report was not an independent valuation of assets in accordance with the Decree of the President of Belarus No. 615 dated 13 November 2006 \"On assessment activities in the Republic of Belarus\" (Letter from State Property Committee of the Republic of Belarus to MCEC of 9 July 2015 (Doc. **R-126**)); and  \n- the Minsk Cadaster Agency confirmed to the Minsk Municipality that it had \"not carr[ied] out tasks relating to identifying individual cost items and analyzing (assessing) the method of their calculation in terms of the intended purpose for the 'design, survey, construction and installation works to construct [the Facilities]', taking into account their construction readiness\" (Letter from Minsk Cadaster Agency to MCEC of 26 June 2015 (Doc. **R-124**)).\n\nLetter from MCEC to Manolium-E of 7 August 2015 (Doc. **C-156**).\n\n170.\n\nClaimant reacted with surprise, explaining in a letter dated 20 August 2015 that the costs reflected in the report were those recorded in the accounting of Manolium-E, requested the Minsk Municipality to conduct its own calculation within 10 days and reserved its legal actions.239\n\nLetter from Manolium-E to MCEC of 20 August 2015 (Doc. **C-157**).\n\n171.\n\nThe Municipality's reaction went one step further. Until then, the thrust of the discussion had been the proper quantification of the compensation owed to Manolium-E. In its 4 September 2015 reply letter, the Municipality rejected the proposition that Manolium-E was entitled to any compensation and requested the gratuitous transfer of the Facilities.240\n\nLetter from MCEC to Manolium-E of 4 September 2015 (Doc. **C-158**).\n\nClaimant appeals to the President of the Republic\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n172.\n\nClaimant was shocked by this change of opinion, and decided to bring the dispute to the attention of the Presidency of the Republic. On 12 November 2015, it wrote directly to President Lukashenko bringing to his \"attention all aspects of the 'lawlessness\u2019 that the Republic\u2019s executive officials\" were conducting against the Russian investor and requesting a personal meeting.241\n\nLetter from Manolium-E to the President of the Republic of Belarus of 12 November 2015 (Doc. **R-127**).\n\n173.\n\nClaimant\u2019s letter to President Lukashenko obtained no direct answer, but it seems to have had certain effects.\n\n174.\n\nThus, on 2 December 2015, acting \"pursuant to instruction No 39/225-4419 of the Council of Ministers of the Republic of Belarus\", the Minsk Municipality applied to the Ministry of Architecture for the designation of an entity which could develop an appropriate methodology to establish the compensation owed to Manolium-E, and review the calculation already performed by the Minsk Cadaster Agency.242\n\nLetter from MCEC to the Ministry of Architecture and Construction of the Republic of Belarus and the State Property Committee of the Republic of Belarus of 2 December 2015 (Doc. **R-132**).\n\n175.\n\nAnd three weeks later, on 26 November 2015, the Minsk Municipality, acting \"pursuant to instruction No. 39/105-726 of the Prime Minister of the Republic of Belarus\", backtracked from its position that the transfer of the Facilities should be gratuitous, and informed the Ministry of Economy that\n\n\"when the value and the terms of the acquisition of the property are clarified, [the Minsk Municipality] will meet with the investor and propose those terms and conditions\".243\n\nLetter from MCEC to the Ministry of Economy of the Republic of Belarus of 26 November 2015 (Doc. **R-129**). The Ministry of Economy sent a letter reproducing the information obtained from the Minsk Municipality to the President on 27 November 2015 (Doc. **R-130**).\n\n**B.** **The MoF Report**\n-------------------------\n\n176.\n\nOn 30 December 2015, a meeting was held between the Minsk Municipality and the various Ministries concerned, in order to reach a common opinion. The outcome was a request for the Council of Ministers to instruct\n\n- the MoF;\n\n- the Ministry of Architecture; and\n\n- the Technology Center for Pricing in Construction,\n\nto carry out a very detailed assessment and to establish\n\n- the value of the work actually carried out by Manolium-E;\n\n- the present state of the Facilities; and\n\n- whether the Facilities complied with the design specifications.244\n\nLetter from MCEC to the Council of Ministers of the Republic of Belarus of 30 December 2015 (Doc. **R-135**), pp. 2-3.\n\n177.\n\nThe decision added that if the Investor disagreed with this methodology, \"the issue of recovery of [Manolium-E\u2019s] losses should be settled in court.\"245\n\nLetter from MCEC to the Council of Ministers of the Republic of Belarus of 30 December 2015 (Doc. **R-135**), p. 3.\n\n178.\n\nA month later, on 27 January 2016, the Prime Minister accepted the request and ordered the Minsk Municipality\n\n\"to subsequently use this information in adopting a decision on the recovery of [Manolium-E\u2019s] costs in return for the transfer of the facilities - which are to be suitable for State Enterprise Minsktrans to use (operate) them in accordance with their designated purpose - into the municipal ownership of the city of Minsk\".246\n\nInstruction of the Council of Ministers of the Republic of Belarus No. 39/1078p of 27 January 2016 (Doc. **R-137**).\n\n179.\n\nIn compliance with those instructions,247 consultants from three government entities248 conducted an audit of Manolium-E\u2019s commercial and financial activities and rendered the MoF Report**.**\n\nInstruction of the MoF No. 8 of 3 February 2016 (Doc. **R-139**); Prescription issued by the MoF No. 8 of 2 February 2016 (Doc. **C-159**).\n\nThe MoF, the Republic Science and Technology Center for Pricing in Construction of the Ministry of Architecture and the Real Estate Valuation Department, and the Complex Norms Directorate.\n\n180.\n\nThe MoF Report, which was issued on 22 February 2016, came to a conclusion which was almost identical to that reached by the report of the Minsk Cadaster Agency. While the Cadaster Agency had valued the Facilities at USD 18.1 M, the MoF Report came to a slightly higher number, USD 19.4 M, by adding the construction management costs:\n\n\"documented costs of [Manolium-E] directed to the establishment of [the Facilities] amount[ed] (including construction management costs) to [...] BYR 67.271 M, which is equivalent to USD 19.4 M\"249\n\nMoF Report (Doc. **C-160**), p. 15.\n\n**2.4** **T****he** **M****insk** **M****unicipality submits a proposal to the** **C****ouncil of** **M****inisters**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n181.\n\nThe outcome of the MoF Report did not satisfy the Minsk Municipality: it was reluctant to pay, out of its own budget, an amount of almost USD 20 M to Manolium-E, as compensation for the construction of the (still unfinished) Facilities. The original plan had been for these Facilities to be financed off-budget, and the Municipality\u2019s preferred solution was for Manolium-E to transfer the Facilities to the city of Minsk for free.\n\n182.\n\nOn 29 February 2016, the Minsk Municipality held a meeting with representatives of all agencies involved in the preparation of the MoF Report, to discuss the results of the audit and the way forward.250\n\nLetter from MCEC to the Council of Ministers of the Republic of Belarus of 29 February 2016 (Doc. **R-140**).\n\n183.\n\nAs a result of that meeting, on that same day the Minsk Municipality wrote an extensive letter to the Council of Ministers and attached a draft report for the President, rejecting the use of the MoF Report because \"the audit was largely performed without establishing the facts of actual works carried out\".251 The letter concluded that the valuation established in the MoF Report \"may not be used as ground for the repayment of the said amount out of the budget\".252 In other words, the Municipality was not prepared to pay compensation to Manolium-E, in the amount of almost USD 20 M determined by the MoF Report, funded with its own budget.\n\nLetter from MCEC to the Council of Ministers of the Republic of Belarus of 29 February 2016 (Doc. **R-140**), pp. 1-2.\n\nLetter from MCEC to the Council of Ministers of the Republic of Belarus of 29 February 2016 (Doc. **R-140**), p. 2.\n\n184.\n\nThe Minsk Municipality proposed an alternative solution to the Council of Ministers, which would secure the gratuitous transfer of the Facilities Land Plots into municipal ownership.\n\n185.\n\nThe Minsk Municipality had \"found\" that Manolium-E had outstanding liabilities to the State budget amounting to USD 24.4 M, far in excess of the compensation determined in the MoF Report.253 These liabilities resulted basically from two items:254\n\n- the accrual of the Land Tax on the Facilities Land Plots; applying the penalty rates and the other charges for late payment, the Municipality calculated that the outstanding amount had reached USD 19.6 M; and\n\n- the sum required to complete the construction and commissioning of the Facilities, which the Municipality estimated at USD 4.7 M.\n\nLetter from MCEC to the Council of Ministers of the Republic of Belarus of 29 February 2016 (Doc. **R-140**), p. 2.\n\nTaxes are assessed by the Tax Inspectorate; there is no evidence in the record showing how and when the Minsk Municipality obtained knowledge of Manolium-E's tax liability. *See* HT Day 1, 253:10-12.\n\n186.\n\nBased on this information, the Minsk Municipality submitted a plan to the Council of Ministers, which was consistent with the Municipality\u2019s long-standing objective of achieving the gratuitous transfer of the Facilities into municipal ownership. The plan had two steps:\n\n- first, Claimant and Manolium-E would be invited to accept the transfer for free of the Facilities into municipal ownership; and\n\n- second, should Claimant or Manolium-E disagree, and refuse the free transfer, the second leg of the plan would be activated: the Minsk Municipality would order Manolium-E to pay the outstanding Land Tax, and if Manolium-E failed to do so, it would enforce the debt through the courts and foreclose on the Facilities.255\n\nLetter from MCEC to the Council of Ministers of the Republic of Belarus of 29 February 2016 (Doc. **R-140**), pp. 2-3.\n\n187.\n\nSumming up, the thrust of the Minsk Municipality\u2019s plan was to force the investor to choose between two evils:\n\n- transferring the Facilities free of charge; or\n\n- paying the outstanding Land Tax and other liabilities, which amounted to USD 24.4 M, or, upon refusal to pay, being deprived of the Facilities through the judicial enforcement of the unpaid amounts.\n\n**2.5** **T****he implementation of the plan**\n----------------------------------------------\n\n188.\n\nThe Minsk Municipality\u2019s 29 February 2016 letter was addressed to the Council of Ministers of the Republic of Belarus. The record does not include any document formalizing the reaction of the Council. But such reaction must have been positive, and an authorization to proceed must have been granted, because the Minsk Municipality promptly enforced the plan. First it filed a fresh administrative proceeding against Manolium-E (**A.**), then the Tax Inspectorate established that Manolium-E was liable for the payment of Land Tax (**B.**), leading to the enforcement of the tax liability (**c.**). Then, there was a change of tack by the Municipality, which finally accepted the return of the Facilities Land Plots (**D.**), culminating in the issuance of a Presidential Order which formalized the transfer of the Facilities into municipal ownership (**E.**).\n\n**A.** **The Second Administrative Proceeding**\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n189.\n\n*Pro memoria*, Manolium-E\u2019s failure to return the Facilities Land Plots into municipal ownership had already triggered four years before the so-called First Administrative Proceeding, in which the Minsk Municipality claimed that Manolium-E had committed an administrative offense and should be fined. But on 23 July 2012, the Pervomaysky District Court in Minsk had dismissed the Municipality\u2019s claims: the judge found that Manolium-E had taken measures to return the Land Plots and had used its best efforts to resolve the situation, but that under the circumstances - non-extension of the Investment Contract, absence of a construction permit and the Municipality\u2019s refusal to accept the return of the Land Plots - it had no chance to discharge its duty.256\n\nPervomaysky Decision (Doc. **C-346**), p. 2.\n\nFiling of the Second Administrative Proceeding\n----------------------------------------------\n\n190.\n\nAs a first step in the implementation of its plan, on 2 March 2016, only two days after the letter submitted to the Council of Ministers, the Minsk Municipality decided to file a new administrative proceeding against Manolium-E [the \"**second Administrative Proceeding**\"**]**. The Municipality again audited the Facilities Land Plots, issued administrative offense reports,257 and thereafter started administrative court proceedings claiming that the delayed return of the Facilities Land Plots gave rise to an administrative offense.258\n\nAdministrative Offence Reports of the Land Planning Service of MCEC Nos. 17, 20 and 21 of 18 March 2016 (Docs. **C-343**, **C-344** and **C-345**).\n\nResolution of the Minsk City Court of 13 May 2016 (Doc. **C-162**); Resolution of the Minsk City Court of 14 June 2016 (Doc. **C-163**); Appeal against the Ruling of the Court of the Pervomaysky District of Minsk dated 17 May 2016 of 9 June 2016 (Doc. **C-183**), Resolution of the Minsk City Court of 3 August 2016 (Doc. **C-184**).\n\n191.\n\nWhat had happened in the First Administrative Proceeding occurred again: on 5 April 2016, the Pervomaysky Court of Minsk found for Manolium-E and decided that its actions \"did not constitute an administrative offense\".259\n\nThis is referenced in the Resolution of the Minsk City Court of 13 May 2016 (Doc. **C-162**).\n\nAppeal\n------\n\n192.\n\nThe Minsk Municipality did not accept the decision of the Pervomaysky Court and appealed the judgement to the Minsk City Court. A month later, on 13 May 2016, a hearing was held, and shortly thereafter the appeal judge issued his decision, annulling the first instance judgement and remanding the case to the Pervomaysky Court, but to a different judge. The reason given was that the first instance judge had failed to ensure a complete and objective investigation of the circumstances of the case and had failed to properly verify all evidence.260\n\nResolution of the Minsk City Court of 13 May 2016 (Doc. **C-162**), in the translation provided by Respondent.\n\nRemand\n------\n\n193.\n\nA new first instance trial took place four days later, before a different judge of the Pervomaysky Court, and the original outcome was reversed: in a judgement dated 17 May 2016, Manolium-E was found liable for breaching Arts. 23.41 and 23.42 of the Code of Administrative Offenses:261\n\n\"Having heard the explanations of the representative of [Manolium-E] and the representatives of [...] the [Minsk Municipality], and having studied the case file, I arrive at the conclusion that in the actions undertaken by [Manolium-E] one can perceive features of administrative offences as specified by articles 23.41 and 23.42 Code of Administrative Offences\".\n\nResolution of the Minsk City Court of 13 May 2016 (Doc. C-162), in the translation provided by Respondent\n\n194.\n\nIn a statement of reasons dated 26 May 2016, the judge explained that Manolium-E had failed to apply for extension of its Land Permits, and that after expiry of the Permits, it continued to use the Facilities Land Plots without authorization. As regards Manolium-E\u2019s argument that it had tried to return the Facilities Land Plots, the judge found that such return was impossible, because Manolium-E had property located on the Plots. Finally, Manolium-E\u2019s submission that the issue was already *res iudicata,* due to the final judgement rendered in the First Administrative Proceeding, which had been in Manolium-E\u2019s favor, was dismissed with the argument that the First and the Second Administrative Proceedings referred to different land plots (a statement which does not conform to reality).262\n\nRuling in a case concering an administrative offense of the Court of Pervomaysky District of Minsk of 17 May 2016, Statement of Reasons of 26 May 2017 (Doc.

In the appeal, Manolium-E alleged that: there was an absence of features of an administrative offense in the actions of Manolium-E because it had tried to return the Facilities Land Plots to the Minsk Municipality; there was a statute of limitation on the imposition of administrative penalties; and there was a ruling on the same facts by the same court on 23 July 2012 which had not been overturned.\n\nResolution of the Minsk City Court of 14 June 2016 (Doc. **C-163**).\n\nResolution of the Minsk City Court of 3 August 2016 (Doc. **C-184**).\n\n197.\n\nSumming up, the Minsk Municipality initiated the Second Administrative Proceeding in March 2016. Three months thereafter, by mid-June 2016, the Municipality had reached its goal: an initial judgement in favour of Manolium-E had been quashed, and substituted by a second judgement, confirmed upon appeal, which found that Manolium-E, by failing to return the Facilities Land Plots, had made an unauthorized use of such Plots and had committed an administrative offence, and imposed a fine of BYR 52.5 M.\n\n**B.** **Decision of the Tax Inspectorate**\n-------------------------------------------\n\n198.\n\nIn the meantime, the enforcement of the Land Tax owed by Manolium-E was also progressing.\n\nTax audits\n----------\n\n199.\n\nOn 17 May 2016, the Tax Inspectorate conducted a tax audit267 on Manolium-E, focused on Manolium-E\u2019s failure to submit Land Tax declarations for the years 2013 to 2016.268 This first tax audit concluded that, as of 17 May 2016, Manolium-E\u2019s Land Tax liability amounted to BYR 18,538 M and late payment penalties amounted to BYR 4,380 M.\n\nReport on the documentary [desk] tax audit of Manolium-E No. 2-5/1299 of 17 May 2016 (Doc. **C-164**); Letter from the Tax Inspectorate to Manolium-E of 18 May 2016 (Doc. **R-141**); Letter from the Tax Inspectorate to Claimant of 18 May 2016 (Doc. **R-142**).\n\nAppendix 1 to the Report on documentary [desk] tax audit of Manolium-E No. 2-5/1299 of 17 May 2016 (Doc. **C- 164**), referring to Art. 22(4)(1) of the General part of the Tax Code of the Republic of Belarus and Art. 202 of the Special part of the Tax Code of the Republic of Belarus.\n\n200.\n\nThe calculations made by the Tax Inspectorate were communicated to Manolium-E in late May 2016.269\n\nReport on the documentary [desk] tax audit of Manolium-E No. 2-5/1299 of 17 May 2016 (Doc. **C-164**), p. 4; Letter from the Tax Inspectorate to Manolium-E of 18 May 2016 (Doc. **R-141**); Letter from the Tax Inspectorate to Claimant of 18 May 2016 (Doc. **R-142**).\n\nNew calculation\n---------------\n\n201.\n\nHowever, a few weeks thereafter, on 21 June 2016, the Tax Inspectorate recalculated the amount of Land Tax owed by Manolium-E, taking into consideration \"new information received\", *i.e.*, the outcome of the Second Administrative Proceeding.\n\n202.\n\nUnder the new calculation, the Tax Inspectorate multiplied the tax rate by 10 and by two (depending on the land plot areas), and reassessed the penalties. In essence, the Tax Inspectorate redistributed the amount of hectares for each land plot270 and applied:\n\n- twenty times the tax rate to a land plot of 7.1407 ha, which accommodated a fenced area with uncompleted parts of the Depot;271\n\n- ten times the tax rate to 2.293 ha, which partly held Manolium-E\u2019s construction facilities;272 and\n\n- the normal tax rate to 0.11 ha, which presumably accommodated construction materials (asphalt covering) and the Pull Station.273\n\nThe redistribution seems to follow the decision in the Second Administrative Proceeding (Ruling in a case concerning an administrative offense of the Court of Pervomaysky District of Minsk of 17 May 2016, (Doc. **C-182**)):  \n- the land plot of 7.1.407 h held a fenced unfinished construction site granted for construction and maintenance of the Depot; and  \n- the land plot of 0.1126 ha, which later without explanation increases to 0.1342 ha, may be formed by the addition of a land plot of 0.0438 ha (Administrative Offence Report No. 17 of the MCEC Land Planning Service of 18 March 2016 (Doc. **C-343**)), which accommodated construction materials (asphalt covering), plus a land plot of 0.0325 ha which accommodated the Pull Station, and other land plot.\n\nRuling in a case concerning an administrative offense of the Court of Pervomaysky District of Minsk of 17 May 2016 (Doc. **C-182**); Administrative Offence Report No. 17 of the Land Planning Service of MCEC of 18 March 2016 (Doc. **C-343**).\n\nThe land plot of 2.293 ha seems to be formed by two land plots: one of 1.4219 (Administrative Offence Report No. 20 of Minsk Land Planning Service of MCEC on administrative offence of 18 March 2016 (Doc. **C-344**)), which holds Manolium-E's property (construction facilities), plus a land plot of 0.8624 ha (Administrative Offence Report No. 21 of Minsk Land Planning Service of MCEC of 18 March 2016 (Doc. **C-345**)), which was granted to construct the Depot and was not returned on time.\n\n*See* fn. 271 *supra*.\n\n203.\n\nUnder the new calculation, as of 21 June 2016, Manolium-E\u2019s amended Land Tax liability increased to BYR 200,464 M, approximately ten times more than the previous calculation;274 late payment penalties increased 15 times to BYR 63,976 M.275\n\nLetter from the Tax Inspectorate to Manolium-E of 21 June 2016 (Doc. **C-165**).\n\nLetter from the Tax Inspectorate to Manolium-E of 21 June 2016 (Doc. **C-165**), p. 4.\n\nDecision\n--------\n\n204.\n\nOn 19 July 2016, the Tax Inspectorate issued its decision276 and confirmed the new calculation: it found that Manolium-E had breached the obligation to submit Land Tax declarations to the Tax Inspectorate for the years 2013, 2014, 2015 and 2016.277 Thus, applying penalty rates multiplied by 10 for land used without authorization and by two for land with uncompleted facilities, the Tax Inspectorate found that the outstanding Land Tax amounted to BYR 200,464 M and the penalties to BYR 63,976 M.\n\nDecision of the Tax Inspectorate of 19 July 2016 (Doc. **C-168**).\n\nDecision of the Tax Inspectorate of 19 July 2016 (Doc. **C-168**), referring to Art. 22(4)(1) of the General part of the Tax Code of the Republic of Belarus and Art. 202 of the Special part of the Tax Code of the Republic of Belarus.\n\n205.\n\nOn 24 November 2016, the Tax Inspectorate imposed an additional administrative fine of BYR 46,000 M.278\n\nC III, para. 355; Resolution of the Tax Inspectorate to impose an administrative sanction of 24 November 2016 (Doc. **R-146**).\n\n206.\n\nIn summary, by the end of February 2016 the Minsk Municipality submitted to the Council of Ministers its plan to enforce Manolium-E\u2019s outstanding Land Tax liabilities, if Manolium-E did not agree to transfer the Facilities gratuitously into municipal ownership. Four months thereafter, the Tax Inspectorate had completed one of the legs of the plan: it had adopted a resolution, applying the 10x and 2x penalty rates, and established that the outstanding Land Tax debt amounted to BYR 200,464 M, to which penalties for late payment in an amount of BYR 63,976 M had to be added; the penalties were further increased in November 2016 by a fine of BYR 46,000 M.\n\n**C.** **Enforcement of the tax liability****279**\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nAmounts until now have been expressed in BYR. On 1 July 2016, the New Belarusian Ruble [\"**BYN**\"] replaced the Belarusian Ruble (BYR) at a ratio of 1:10,000. Henceforth amounts will be expressed in the new currency (BYN). *See* R PHB, n. 218.\n\n207.\n\nOn 5 July 2016, even before the Tax Inspectorate had issued its liability decision, it issued an \"Order on arrest and/or seizure of property\" against Manolium-E, and attached (\"arrested\" in the words of the Order) the Facilities (*i.e.*, the Pull Station, the Depot and the Road) constructed by Manolium-E on municipal land.\n\n208.\n\nAs a next step, the Tax Inspectorate asked the Economic Court of Minsk to recover Manolium-E\u2019s tax liability against the attached Facilities,280 and on 18 August 2016 the Court accepted the request and issued the Enforcement Order - a ruling authorizing the tax authorities to collect from Manolium-E \"on account\" of the Facilities (which the ruling values at BYN 20.7 M).281\n\nApplication of the Tax Inspectorate of 20 July 2016 (Doc. **C-169**); Tax Code of the Republic of Belarus (general provisions) of 19 December 2002 No. 166-Z (Doc. **CL-8**), Art. 37(5):  \n\"5. Non-fulfillment or improper performance by the payer (other obliged person) of the tax obligation is the basis to apply measures for enforcement of the tax obligation and payment of the according penalties, as well as for application of the sanctions to the specified person in the manner and under conditions established by the legislation.\"\n\nEnforcement Order (Doc. **C-170**).\n\n209.\n\nUnder Belarusian law, upon a court\u2019s decision to enforce the payment of a tax debt, the attached assets are to be sold, unless such sale is impossible or impractical282 -an exception which applied to the Facilities, which had been constructed on municipal land and were intended for public use. In such case, the asset is simply transferred into municipal ownership for free, and the tax liability is set off in an amount equal to the value of the asset.283\n\nRegulation \"On accounting, safekeeping, evaluation and sale of confiscated, attached or forfeited assets\" adopted by President's Decree No. 63 dated 19 February 2016 (Doc. **RL-126**), Art. 17.\n\nRegulation \"On accounting, safekeeping, evaluation and sale of confiscated, attached or forfeited assets\" adopted by President's Decree No. 63 dated 19 February 2016 (Doc. **RL-126**), Arts. 17, 164, 165 and 185.\n\n210.\n\nTransfer of real estate assets into municipal ownership requires a Presidential Order,284 which must be preceded by an inventory285 and an expert evaluation.286\n\nRegulation \"On accounting, safekeeping, evaluation and sale of confiscated, attached or forfeited assets\" adopted by President's Decree No. 63 dated 19 February 2016 (Doc. **RL-126**), Art. 165.\n\nRegulation \"On accounting, safekeeping, evaluation and sale of confiscated, attached or forfeited assets\" adopted by President's Decree No. 63 dated 19 February 2016 (Doc. **RL-126**), Arts. 248 and 249.\n\nRegulation \"On accounting, safekeeping, evaluation and sale of confiscated, attached or forfeited assets\" adopted by President's Decree No. 63 dated 19 February 2016 (Doc. **RL-126**), Art. 43.\n\n211.\n\nThus, once the Economic Court of Minsk issued the Enforcement Order in August 2016, the next procedural step consisted in a Presidential Order authorizing the transfer of the Facilities into municipal ownership.\n\n212.\n\nOn 18 November 2016, a preparatory meeting, hosted by the Administrative Office of the President, and with the participation of the affected public entities, took place, to set in motion the administrative procedure for the issuance of the Presidential Order,287 which included a new inventory and a new valuation of the Facilities.288\n\nLetter from the Department of Humanitarian Activities of the Administrative Office of the President of the Republic of Belarus of 18 November 2016 (Doc. **C-172**); First witness statement of Nikolay Akhramenko of 19 November 2018 (**RWS-2**), paras. 149-156.\n\nDeed No. 018366 of property transfer of 27 January 2017 (Doc. **R-148**).\n\n**D.** **Minsk accepts the return of the Facilities Land Plots**\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n213.\n\nWhile the enforcement proceedings were progressing, the legal situation of the Facilities Land Plots had remained unchanged.\n\n214.\n\n*Pro memoria,* in 2012 Manolium-E had offered to return the Land Plots,289 but the Minsk Municipality had refused, alleging that an uncompleted constructed facility - the Depot - made the return impossible.290 The Municipality\u2019s refusal triggered the accrual of Land Tax, starting on 1 January 2013, at penalty rates of 10x and 2x the normal rate, and this tax plus the penalties ballooned into a figure which exceeded the value of the Facilities.\n\nLetter from Manolium-E to MCEC of 11 June 2012 (Doc. **C-336**).\n\nLetter from Minsk Land Planning Service to Manolium-E of 17 July 2012 (Doc. **C-337**); Letter from MCEC to Manolium-E of 29 September 2016 (Doc. **C-341**).\n\n215.\n\nOn 1 December 2016, when issuance of the Presidential Order was imminent, the Minsk Municipality decided to change tack: it issued a formal decision withdrawing the Facilities Land Plots from Manolium-E.291 The decision is a two-page document, which does not provide any reasoning. In 2012, the Minsk Municipality had argued that the withdrawal was impossible, due to the existence of the uncompleted Depot. By 2016, the Depot was still uncompleted, no new construction activity having been performed, but the Minsk Municipality now accepted the return of the Land Plots, without raising any objection. No justification for this change of position was provided.\n\nDecision of MCEC No. 3539 of 1 December 2016 (Doc. **C-173**).\n\n**E.** **The Presidential Order**\n---------------------------------\n\n216.\n\nOn 20 January 2017, the President of the Republic issued the Presidential Order that permitted the transfer of the Facilities into the ownership of Minsk, without consideration:\n\n\"To transfer without consideration into the ownership of Minsk property that is owned by [Manolium-E], said property having been attached by the [Tax Inspectorate] by way of [an order dated 5 July 2016], towards payment of [Manolium-E\u2019s] arrears to the budget of Minsk, which are subject to collection based on a ruling [...] issued by the Economic Court of Minsk on 18 August 2016\".292\n\nPresidential Order (Doc. **R-242**).\n\n217.\n\nThe Presidential Order set off Manolium-E\u2019s liabilities293 in an amount equivalent to the value of the property, which it established at BYN 27.3 M.294 The principal of Manolium-E\u2019s tax liability (BYN 20.0 M) was completely written off,295 but the value of the assets transferred was insufficient to extinguish the totality of Manolium-E\u2019s outstanding debt.296 After the transfer, Manolium-E still owed Belarus BYN 6.3 M (a sum which included BYN 1.6 M of tax penalty plus BYN 4.6 M of administrative fine imposed in the Second Administrative Proceeding).297\n\nPresidential Order (Doc. **R-242**).\n\nAppendix to the Presidential Order (Doc. **R-242**), p. 5.

Thus, on 7 May 2012, Claimant wrote to President Lukashenko requesting his intervention to ensure a productive dialogue with the Minsk authorities:\n\n\"The reason for addressing you personally was the unconstructive, if not untenable, policy of the Minsk authorities headed by the mayor of Minsk Mr. N.A.

But on 9 September 2014, after learning about the decision of the Economic Court of Minsk to terminate the Investment Contract, Claimant insisted on writing to President Lukashenko asking him:\n\n\"to look once more at the issues you are already familiar with which are associated with the infringement of our rights and legal interests by the Minsk City Executive Committee, and to take drastic steps in response, aimed at a compromise solution to all the existing problems in this regard, typical of the established style and methods of your many years of leadership of the Republic of Belarus.\"318\n\nLetter from Claimant to the President of the Republic of Belarus of 19 September 2014 (Doc. **R-247**).\n\n232.\n\nNo formal answer to the letter appears in the record, but the instructions issued subsequently by the President are clear: to monitor the situation and \"to defend the interests of the state at all times.\"319\n\nResolution No. 09/219 P1937 of 26 December 2014, mentioned in Draft report to the Administration of the President of the Republic of Belarus (appended to the letter from MCEC to the Council of Ministers of the Republic of Belarus of 29 February 2016 (Doc. **R-248**)); Letter from MCEC to the Council of Ministers of the Republic of Belarus of 29 February 2016 (Doc. **R-140**).\n\n233.\n\nIn 2015, after the termination of the Investment Contract and during the negotiations to evaluate the compensation owed, Claimant sent further letters to the President,320 requesting the transfer of the Facilities into communal ownership321 and the President\u2019s personal involvement322 to reach an agreement on the compensation owed to Claimant.323\n\nLetter from Claimant to the Administration of the President of the Republic of Belarus of 8 January 2015 (Doc. **R-120**); Letter from Manolium-E to the President of the Republic of Belarus of 30 June 2015 (Doc. **R-125**).\n\nLetter from Claimant to the Administration of the President of the Republic of Belarus of 8 January 2015 (Doc. **R-120**).\n\nLetter from Manolium-E to the President of the Republic of Belarus of 30 June 2015 (Doc. **R-125**).\n\nLetter from Manolium-E to the President of the Republic of Belarus of 12 November 2015 (Doc. **R-127**).\n\n234.\n\nOnce again, no answer to those letters can be found in the record. However, there is no doubt that the President of Belarus was promptly informed of the steps taken by the Minsk Municipality. In fact, on 4 February 2016, while the MoF audit was taking place, the President ordered the First Deputy Prime Minister to \"take control over settling the situation\" and report back by 1 March 2016.324\n\nInstruction of the Administrative Office of the President of the Republic of Belarus No. 09/124-185 of 5 February 2016 (Doc. **R-244**).\n\n235.\n\nRight before this deadline, on 29 February 2016 the Minsk Municipality laid out its plan to ensure the free transfer of the Facilities through a letter to the Council of Ministers,325 which attached a draft report for the President.326\n\nLetter from MCEC to the Council of Ministers of the Republic of Belarus of 29 February 2016 (Doc. **R-140**).\n\nLetter from MCEC to the Council of Ministers of the Republic of Belarus of 29 February 2016 (Doc. **R-140**).\n\n236.\n\nPresident Lukashenko clearly agreed with the Municipality\u2019s plan, which was subsequently executed with the President\u2019s support: he issued the Presidential Order which authorized the gratuitous transfer of the Facilities into the ownership of Minsk.327\n\nPresidential Order (Doc. **R-242**).\n\n**IV.** **RELIEF SOUGHT BY THE PARTIES**\n----------------------------------------\n\n237.\n\nClaimant requests the following relief in its post-hearing brief:328\n\n\"I.

Section XV, which encompasses Arts. 65 to 69, and Annex 16 [the \"**Protocol**\"], regulate \"trade in services, incorporation, activities and investments in the Member States.\"370\n\nThe Protocol has two annexes: one devoted to procedures for trade in telecommunication services, and another, containing a list of horizontal restrictions retained by Member States for all sectors and activities.\n\n258.\n\nSection VII of the Protocol, encompassing Arts. 67 through 87, is devoted to investments. Arts. 84 and 85(3) of the Protocol establish a dispute resolution clause for investor-State disagreements, and afford the Tribunal jurisdiction to adjudicate\n\n\"all disputes between a recipient State and an investor of another Member State arising from or in connection with an investment of that investor on the territory of the recipient State [...]\".\n\n259.\n\nAccording to Art. 65, section VII shall apply to all investments made by investors of a Member State in the territory of another Member State \"starting from December 16, 1991\". The Protocol lacks any other provision regarding its *ratione temporis* application.\n\n260.\n\nThe Tribunal is called upon to determine whether it has *ratione temporis* jurisdiction to adjudicate the claims submitted by Claimant. To do so, the Tribunal must address three separate questions:\n\n- First, when did the EEU Treaty come into force?\n\n- Second, when did Claimant invest in Belarus?\n\n- Third, when did Belarus breach the Treaty as per Claimant\u2019s allegations?\n\n- And, finally, Claimant\u2019s additional arguments.\n\n261.\n\nThe Parties agree that the Treaty came into force on 1 January 2015 (the Effective Date). Thus, the answer to the first question requires no further discussion.\n\n262.\n\nThe other two questions and Claimant\u2019s additional arguments will be addressed by the Tribunal in the following sections (**A.** through **C.**)\n\n**A.** **When did Claimant invest in Belarus?**\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n263.\n\nArt. 65 of the Protocol provides that the EEU Treaty protects all investments made by investors of other Member States in Belarus after 16 December 1991:\n\n\"65. The provisions of this section shall apply to all investments made by investors of the Member States on the territory of another Member State starting from December 16, 1991.\"\n\n264.\n\nClaimant alleges that it made the following investments in Belarus:371\n\n- financing of the design and construction of the Facilities and the Mall, in accordance with the Investment Contract signed on 6 June 2003; and\n\n- incorporating Manolium-E in the territory and under the laws of Belarus on 18 March 2004.372\n\nC I, para. 343.\n\nCertificates of State Registration of Manolium-E in the Unified State Register of Legal Entities and Individual Entrepreneurs of 18 March 2004 and 16 April 2014 (Docs. **C-5** and **C-6**); Charter of Manolium**-**E of 16 April 2004 (Doc. **C-7**).\n\n265.\n\n(The issue of whether such alleged investments are effectively protected under the EEU Treaty is addressed in detail in section V.3 *infra.)*\n\n266.\n\nClaimant\u2019s alleged investments were made in 2003 and 2004. The EEU Treaty covers investments made since 1991. Thus, Claimant\u2019s investments are covered by the EEU Treaty, so long as all other conditions are met.\n\n**B.** **When did the alleged breaches of the Treaty occur?**\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n267.\n\nIndeed, the fact that Claimant\u2019s investments can be covered by the Treaty is not sufficient. Claimant and Respondent agree that an additional temporal requirement must be complied with: the Tribunal only has jurisdiction to adjudicate breaches of the Treaty committed by Belarus *after* the Effective Date.373\n\nC III, para. 391; C PHB para. 9; R II, para. 392; R III, para. 625; R PHB, para. 2(a).\n\n268.\n\nThe Tribunal concurs: as a general rule, international treaties are not to be applied retroactively to acts committed before the treaty came into effect. The prohibition of retroactivity is an obvious consequence of the principle of legality, and it is enshrined in Art. 28 of the VCLT:\n\n\"Article 28. NON-RETROACTIVITY OF TREATIES\n\nUnless a different intention appears from the treaty or is otherwise established, its provisions do not bind a party in relation to any act or fact which took place or any situation which ceased to exist before the date of the entry into force of the treaty with respect to that party.\" [Emphasis added]\n\n269.\n\nThe prohibition of retroactivity implies that the legality of a Member State\u2019s actions under the EEU Treaty can only be assessed if the Treaty was in force at the time the act was performed. This principle - which is considered \"well established\"374 and supported by State practice375 - is also reflected in Art. 13 of the International Law Commission\u2019s Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts of 2001 [the \"**ILC Articles**\"]:\n\n\"Article 13: International Obligation in Force for a State\n\nAn act of a State does not constitute a breach of an international obligation unless the State is bound by the obligation in question at the time the act occurs.\"\n\nCommentary (9) to Art. 13 of the ILC Articles (Doc. **CL-87**).\n\nCommentary (4) to Art. 13 of the ILC Articles (Doc. **CL-87**).\n\n270.\n\nClaimant identifies the following acts committed by Belarus that allegedly gave rise to the Termination and Tax Disputes;

There can be no question of retroactive application of the Treaty: when the violations allegedly occurred, the Treaty was already in force.\n\nRespondent\u2019s counter-argument\n-----------------------------\n\n272.\n\nRespondent says that the obligation for Manolium-E to pay Land Tax accrued in January 2013 as a result of amendments to the 2009 Tax Code of the Republic of Belarus - not in 2016. Belarus adds that the dispute arose in February 2014 when the Tax Inspectorate demanded that Manolium-E pay its Land Taxes, and Manolium-E refused to do so - well before the Effective Date.393\n\nR PHB, para. 8.\n\n273.\n\nThe Tribunal does not agree.\n\n274.\n\nIt is true, as Respondent asserts, that in February 2014 the Tax Inspectorate demanded that Manolium-E pay its 2013 and 2014 Land Taxes accrued on the Facilities.394 But these tax demands did not include a ten-fold multiplier to the alleged tax liability and did not give rise to a Treaty claim. It was in 2016, when the Tax Inspectorate applied the multiplier, that (in Claimant\u2019s allegation) the tax became confiscatory and expropriatory and rose to the level of a Treaty breach.395 At that time, the Treaty had already come into force.\n\nDemand of an officer of the Tax Inspectorate to Manolium-E for 2013 of 21 February 2014 (Doc. **R-111**) and Demand of an officer of the Tax Inspectorate to Manolium-E for 2014 of 21 February 2014 (Doc. **R-112**).\n\nC PHB, para. 23; Instruction of the Administrative Office of the President of the Republic of Belarus No. 09/124-185 of 5 February 2016 (Doc. **R-244**); Instruction of the Council of Ministers of the Republic of Belarus No. 39/105-74/1691r of 9 February 2016 (Doc. **R-243**); Letter from MCEC to the Council of Ministers of the Republic of Belarus No. 1/2-11/1084-2 of 29 February 2016 (Doc. **R-140**); Protocol of Minsk Land Planning Service of MCEC on administrative offence No. 17 of 18 March 2016 (Doc. **C-343**); Protocol of Minsk Land Planning Service of MCEC on administrative offence No. 20 of 18 March 2016 (Doc. **C-344**); Ruling in a case concerning an administrative offense of the Court of Pervomaysky District of Minsk of 17 May 2016 (Doc. **C-182**); HT Day 2 (Cross-examination of Mr. Akhramenko), 438:413-15.\n\n**b. The Termination Dispute**\n------------------------------\n\n275.\n\nUnder the Termination Dispute, Claimant submits that Belarus committed two composite breaches of its Treaty obligations: it committed a creeping expropriation, which began before the Effective Date, but culminated thereafter, when the Treaty had already come into effect (**ii.**), and it also breached the FET standard both before and after the Effective Date (**iii**.). Both alleged breaches must be analyzed separately, to establish whether the Tribunal has *ratione temporis* jurisdiction. But first the Tribunal must analyze Art. 15 of the ILC Articles - the legal basis for the finding of a composite breach (**i.**). In a final section, the Tribunal will address Claimant\u2019s counter-arguments (**iv.**)\n\n(i) ILC Articles\n----------------\n\n276.\n\nBoth Parties rely on Art. 15 of the ILC Articles:\n\n\"Article 15: Breach consisting of a composite act\n\n1. The breach of an international obligation by a State through a series of actions or omissions defined in aggregate as wrongful occurs when the action or omission occurs which, taken with the other actions or omissions, is sufficient to constitute the wrongful act.\n\n2. In such a case, the breach extends over the entire period starting with the first of the actions or omissions of the series and lasts for as long as these actions or omissions are repeated and remain not in conformity with the international obligation.\"\n\n277.\n\nArt. 15.1 defines the moment when a composite breach is deemed to occur and Art. 15.2 the date and extension in time of the breach. The composite act is deemed to occur when the action or omission happens which, taken together with the previous actions or omissions, is sufficient to constitute the wrongful act. And the breach starts with the date of the first act of the series and extends over the entire period.\n\n278.\n\nThe Commentary to the ILC Articles contains the following explanation:\n\n*\"****Article 15. Breach consisting of a composite act***\n\nCommentary\n\n(8) Paragraph 1 of article 15 defines the time at which a composite act \"occurs\" as the time at which the last action or omission occurs which, taken with the other actions or omissions, is sufficient to constitute the wrongful act, without it necessarily having to be the last in the series.\n\n[...]\n\n(10) Paragraph 2 of article 15 deals with the extension in time of a composite act. Once a sufficient number of actions or omissions has occurred, producing the result of the composite act as such, the breach is dated to the first of the acts in the series. The status of the first action or omission is equivocal until enough of the series has occurred to constitute the wrongful act; but at that point, the act should be regarded as having occurred over the whole period from the commission of the first action or omission. If this were not so, the effectiveness of the prohibition would thereby be undermined\".\n\n279.\n\nThe Commentary reiterates that the purpose of Art. 15.1 is to set a criterion to determine the occurrence of a composite act *(i.e.,* when the last action has occurred, which taken with the previous ones, is sufficient for the breach to have occurred); while Art. 15.2 determines the relevant date of the breach *(i.e.,* the date of the first act in the series).396\n\n*Rusoro Mining Ltd. v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/12/5, Award dated 22 August 2016 [\"***Rusoro***\"] (Doc. **RL-96**), para. 226.\n\n280.\n\nAlthough the general thrust of the ILC Articles regarding composite acts is clear, the Articles do not address every single question, and in particular do not solve the issue of how the entry into force of a treaty affects a string of acts, where some acts have occurred before and others after the entry into force of that treaty.397 In other words: what happens if the string of acts is divided into two parts, because the Effective Date falls somewhere within this period?\n\n*Rusoro* (Doc. **RL-96**), para. 227.\n\n281.\n\nThe appropriate solution is to break down the composite claim into individual claims related to measures prior to the Effective Date and claims related to measures after the Effective Date - the Tribunal only having jurisdiction to adjudicate those claims arising out of measures which occurred after the Effective Date.398 The question which the Tribunal must adjudicate is whether the portion of the composite act that takes place after the Effective Date (without taking into consideration the portion before) is sufficient to constitute a breach.\n\n*Rusoro* (Doc. **RL-96**), para. 231, citing to *William Ralph Clayton, William Richard Clayton, Douglas Clayton, Daniel Clayton and Bilcon of Delaware, Inc. v. Government of Canada*, UNCITRAL, PCA Case No. 2009-04, Award on Jurisdiction and Liability dated 17 March 2015 [\"***Bilcon***\"], para. 266 where the tribunal found it \"possible and appropriate, as did the tribunals in *Feldman, Mondev* and *Grand River*, to separate a series of events into distinct components, some time barred, some still eligible for consideration on the merits.\"\n\n(ii) Creeping expropriation\n---------------------------\n\n282.\n\nClaimant avers that its primary claim is for creeping expropriation,399 which is a composite act400 that gives rise to \"continuing breaches\",401 extending over the entire period during which the act continues.402 In particular, Claimant argues that the proceedings for the termination of the Investment Contract constituted a continuous, uninterrupted breach, which began with the petition by the Minsk Municipality in 2013 to terminate the Investment Contract, and concluded with the Cassation Decision in 2015403 and the sale of the right to develop a similar project in 2017.404 Thus, if the Tribunal finds that the Cassation Decision and the sale of the right to develop the Mall form part of a continuing chain of events, it should assert jurisdiction over the entire Termination Dispute, even if certain links in that chain occurred prior to the Effective Date.405\n\nC III, para. 412.\n\nC III, para. 413.\n\nC III, para. 415, citing to the commentary to the ILC Articles (Doc. **CL-87**).\n\nC III, para. 416, citing to the ILC Articles (Doc. **CL-11**).\n\nC II, paras. 43-51; C PHB, paras. 42-45; C I, paras. 512-526; C III, paras. 528-577.\n\nC PHB, para. 45.\n\nC PHB, paras. 42-43.\n\n283.\n\nRespondent disagrees. In its opinion, the termination of the Investment Contract is a single act406 that took place before the Effective Date,407 and thus, cannot breach the EEU Treaty.408\n\nR II, paras. 419-428; R III, paras. 727-739.\n\nR II, paras. 415 *et seq*; R PHB, paras. 10-12.\n\nR PHB, paras. 10-12, R II, para. 395, 419; R III, paras. 740-755.\n\nDiscussion\n----------\n\n284.\n\nThe Arbitral Tribunal agrees with Respondent that it lacks *ratione temporis* jurisdiction to adjudicate the claim for creeping expropriation - regardless of whether Claimant\u2019s expropriation claim is analyzed as a composite act (as proposed by Claimant) or as a single act (as defended by Respondent):\n\n- Assuming Claimant\u2019s position and considering the termination of the Investment Contract as a composite act, such composite act took place, when the last action occurred, which, taken together with the State\u2019s previous actions, would be sufficient to provoke a breach; applying this rule, the Termination Decision by the Minsk Economic Court, which effectively terminated the Investment Contract, would be the last action, which (taken together with all prior actions, e.g. Minsk Municipality\u2019s submission to the court) was sufficient to cause an expropriation;409\n\n- If the position of Respondent is preferred, and it is assumed that the termination is a single act, the single measure which would have caused the expropriation would again have been the Termination Decision issued by the Minsk Economic Court.\n\nThis is confirmed by Prof. Crawford when discussing exhaustion of local remedies: \"The breach of international law occurs at the time when the treatment occurs. The breach is not postponed to a later date when local remedies are exhausted.\" Second Report on State Responsibilityby Mr. James Crawford, Special Rapporteur, 1st Sess., U.N. Doc. A/CN.4/498 (1999), para. 145.\n\n285.\n\nThe Tribunal has already found that the Termination Decision is excluded *ratione temporis* from the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction.\n\n286.\n\nIn fact, Claimant only refers in its creeping expropriation claim to two measures which occurred after the Effective Date, 1 January 2015, when the Treaty came into force:\n\n- the Supreme Court\u2019s Cassation Decision rejecting Manolium-E\u2019s motion for annulment of the Appellate Court Decision, which was rendered on 27 January 2015;410 and\n\n- the 2017 decision of the Minsk Municipality to organize a public auction to award to a third party the right to develop a similar project on the land plot that had been intended for the Mall, against payment of USD 8.8 M.411\n\nCassation Decision (Doc. **C-152**).\n\nMinutes of the Results of Public Auction No. 09-U-17 with Conditions for the Right for Design and Construction of Permanent Structures (Buildings, Constructions) of 12 September 2017 (Doc. **R-153**); C III, paras. 384-385.\n\n287.\n\nWhether the Cassation Decision and the sale of the right to develop a similar project, over which the Tribunal has jurisdiction *ratione temporis*, by themselves are sufficient to support a claim for expropriation, is a question which pertains to the merits, and will be adjudicated in section VI.2.4 *infra.*\n\n(iii) FET\n---------\n\n288.\n\nClaimant also includes within its Termination Dispute an allegation that Respondent breached the FET standard, by failing to act in good faith at all stages of the Investment Contract (signature, execution and termination), both before and after the Effective Date.412\n\nC I, para. 415.\n\n289.\n\nAll alleged FET breaches committed prior to the Effective Date fall outside the *ratione temporis* jurisdiction of the Tribunal.\n\n290.\n\nBut Claimant also contends that the Cassation Decision was adopted in bad faith and gave rise to a denial of justice,413 and that the 2017 decision to award the project to a third party also constituted a breach of the FET standard.414 These breaches were allegedly committed after the Effective Date, within the *ratione temporis* jurisdiction of the Tribunal. Whether these measures amount to a breach of the FET standard is a question for the merits, which will be decided in sections VI.2.2 and VI.2.3 *infra*.\n\nC III, paras. 549, 723 and 732.\n\nC I paras. 500-503; C PHB, para. 7.\n\n(iv) Claimant\u2019s counter-argument\n--------------------------------\n\n291.\n\nThe EEU Treaty was signed on 29 May 2014. It entered into force on 1 January 2015. Between these two dates, the Appellate Court Decision terminating the Investment Contract, and allegedly destroying Claimant\u2019s investment, was rendered (on 29 October 2014).\n\n292.\n\nTo support its contention that the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction also includes the Appellate Court Decision, Claimant invokes Art. 18 of the VCLT, which provides that States must \"refrain from acts which would defeat the object and purpose of a treaty\" after signing of the treaty but prior to its entry into force, and says that the Tribunal may consider actions by Respondent between the signing and entry into force of the EEU Treaty in considering Claimant\u2019s treaty claims.415\n\nC PHB para. 47.\n\n293.\n\nRespondent counters that it did not commit any acts or omissions which defeated the object and purpose of the EEU Treaty prior to its entry into force and that no evidence has been submitted by Claimant in support of its position.416\n\nR PHB para. 14.\n\nDiscussion\n----------\n\n294.\n\nAs a starting point, the Tribunal agrees with the finding in *Tecmed* that\n\n\"[i]n assessing the Respondent\u2019s conduct [...] the Arbitral Tribunal shall take into account the principle of good faith, both as a general expression of the principle of international law embodied in Article 26 of the Vienna Convention and in its particular manifestation embodied in Article 18 of such Convention with respect to the Respondent\u2019s conduct between [...] the date on which the Agreement was signed by the Contracting Parties and the date of its entry into force [...]\"417 [Emphasis added]\n\n*T\u00e9cnicas Medioambientales Tecmed S.A. v. United Mexican States*, ICSID Case No. ARB (AF)/00/2, Award dated 29 May 2003 [\"***Tecmed***\"] (Doc. **CL-32**), para.70.\n\n295.\n\nGood faith requires that between the signing and the entry into force of a treaty, signatory States abstain from acts which are incompatible with the treaty\u2019s object and purpose.\n\n296.\n\nIn the present case, however, there is no evidence that the EEU Treaty was invoked before the Court of Appeal or that the Appellate Court Decision was issued in breach of the principle of good faith, with the purpose of \"defeat[ing] the object and purpose\" of the EEU Treaty.\n\n**C.** **Claimant\u2019s additional arguments**\n------------------------------------------\n\n297.\n\nClaimant says that the EEU Treaty can be applied retroactively to disputes which arose before the Treaty entered into force on the Effective Date.\n\n298.\n\nClaimant submits two arguments:\n\n- First, it invokes Art. 28 of the VCLT and argues that the circumstances of the EEU Treaty \"otherwise establish\" an intent of retroactivity;418 Claimant submits as evidence of the parties\u2019 intent of retroactive application, the approach followed in the EEC Investment Treaty,419 signed in 2008 by the Russian Federation, the Republic of Belarus and the Republic of Kazakhstan - five years before the signature of the EEU Treaty in 2008;420 the EEC Investment Treaty specifically stated that it did not apply to disputes that had arisen before the treaty\u2019s entry into force;421 since the EEU Treaty lacks an equivalent provision, Claimant argues that this shows that the parties intended the EEU Treaty to apply retroactively.422\n\n- Second, Claimant submits that additional evidence of intent can be derived from the fact that Art. 84 of the Protocol is drafted in present continuous, rather than future tense.423\n\nC II, paras. 22-31; C III, paras. 390-392; C PHB, para. 9.\n\nThe EEC Investment Treaty, signed on 12 December 2008 by the Russian Federation, the Republic of Belarus, the Republic of Kazakhstan, the Kyrgyz Republic and the Republic of Tajikistan entered into force on 11 Janaury 2016 (Doc. **CL-35**). The EEU Treaty was signed on 29 May 2014 by three member states of the Eurasian Economic Community: the Russian Federation, the Republic of Belarus and the Republic of Kazakhstan and entered into force on 1 January 2015 (Doc. **RL-136**).\n\nThe EEC Investment Treaty was later signed by the Kyrgyz Republic and the Republic of Tajikistan (Doc. **CL-35**).\n\nC II, paras. 26-28; C PHB, paras. 9-10.\n\nC III, paras. 398-402; C PHB, paras. 10-11.\n\nC PHB, para. 12.\n\n299.\n\nThe Tribunal does not share Claimant\u2019s position.\n\nClaimant\u2019s first argument\n-------------------------\n\n300.\n\nThe principle of non-retroactivity of international treaties, enshrined in Art. 28 of the VCLT, is a general principle of international law: a treaty does not bind a party in relation to acts or facts which took place, or any situation which ceased to exist, before its entry into force. The VCLT only permits deviation from this principle if \"a different intention appears from the treaty or is otherwise established\".\n\n301.\n\nThe 2008 EEC Investment Treaty, executed between Belarus, Kazakhstan and Russia (the same parties as to the EEU Treaty), explicitly excluded its application to disputes which had arisen before its entry into force:\n\n\"The Agreement does not apply to disputes that arose before entry of the Treaty into force.\"424\n\nEEC Investment Treaty (Doc. **CL-35**), Art. 12.\n\n302.\n\nThe EEU Treaty does not include such an exception and therefore may apply to pre-existing disputes. This, however, does not bear on the application of the principle of non-retroactivity set forth in Art. 28 of the VCLT. Whether or not a dispute arose before the Effective Date, a treaty can only be applied to acts or facts which took place (or a situation which continued to exist) *after* the Effective Date.425\n\nTribunals have consistently followed this approach. *See e.g.* *ATA v. Jordan* (Doc. **RL-32**), para. 98; *MCI v. Ecuador* (Doc. **RL-1**), para. 59-61; *Salini* (Doc. **RL-30**), para. 170; *Impregilo v. Pakistan* (Doc. **RL-36**), para. 300. *See also* *The Mavrommatis Palestine Concessions (Greece v. Britain)*, P.C.I.J., Series A, No. 2, Judgement dated 30 August 1924 [\"***Mavrommatis Palestine Concessions***\"] (Doc. **RL-9/CL-33**), p. 35.\n\n303.\n\nThe general rule is thus that the EEU Treaty does not apply to acts or omissions that occurred before the Effective Date. Any acts or omissions pertaining to the Termination Dispute that took place before the Effective Date cannot constitute breaches of the EEU Treaty and, consequently, the general rule mandates that the Tribunal lacks *ratione temporis* jurisdiction.\n\nException to the general rule\n-----------------------------\n\n304.\n\nThe general rule, however, knows one exception: if a dispute arises before the entry into force of the Treaty, but the State adopts additional measures after the Effective Date,\n\n- which pertain to the same dispute and\n\n- which imply a continuous or composite breach of the Treaty.\n\nIf this happens, a tribunal must still assess whether the portion of that continuous or composite act, which occurred after the Effective Date, by itself constitutes a Treaty breach.\n\n305.\n\nThe exception to the general rule confirms the Tribunal\u2019s previous finding: that it does have *ratione temporis* jurisdiction to decide Claimant\u2019s Termination Dispute (which had arisen before the Effective Date), but only with regard to measures which the State adopted after the Effective Date *(i.e.,* the Cassation Decision and the 2017 decision to award the project to a third party).\n\nClaimant\u2019s second argument\n--------------------------\n\n306.\n\nClaimant notes that Art. 84 of the Protocol is drafted in present continuous, rather than in future tense, and argues that the choice of grammatical tense proves the Treaty parties\u2019 intent to permit retroactive application to existing disputes.\n\n307.\n\nAgain, the Tribunal sees the matter differently. The present continuous tense is normally used to show that an action is happening now - either at the moment of speech or now in a larger sense - or is going to take place in the near future. The use of present continuous tense, by itself, does not prove that the parties\u2019 intent was to override the general international law principle of non-retroactivity of treaties.\n\n**D.** **Conclusion**\n---------------------\n\n308.\n\nSumming up, the Tribunal finds that it has jurisdiction *ratione temporis* to decide the Tax Dispute in its entirety.\n\n309.\n\nAs regards the Termination Dispute, the Tribunal partially accepts the *Ratione Temporis* Objection, and decides:\n\n- that it does have jurisdiction to adjudicate the alleged breaches of the Treaty (expropriation and FET standard, including denial of justice), with regard to measures which occurred after the Effective Date (*i.e.*, (i) the Cassation Decision and (ii) the auctioning in favour of a third party of the right to develop a project similar to the Mall); and\n\n- that it lacks jurisdiction to adjudicate all other alleged breaches of the Treaty forming part of the Termination Dispute which occurred before the Effective Date.\n\n**2.** **D****omestic** **L****aw** **O****bjection**\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n310.\n\nClaimant initiated this arbitration under the provisions of the Protocol to the EEU Treaty and \"taking into account the provisions of national laws of the Republic of Belarus.\"426 Claimant\u2019s intention was reflected in para. 59 of the Terms of Appointment:\n\n\"The Tribunal shall decide this dispute in accordance with the EEU Treaty, complemented by International Law, and in accordance with Belarusian Law when applicable\".\n\nC I, para. 8.\n\n311.\n\nClaimant submits that the Investment Law of the Republic of Belarus No. 53-Z of 12 July 2013 [the \"**Belarusian Investment Law**\"]427 is applicable to the present dispute,428 and asserts that:\n\n- it is an investor pursuant to the requirements of both the EEU Treaty and the Belarusian Investment Law;429\n\n- it made an investment in Belarus in accordance with both the EEU Treaty and the Belarusian Investment Law;430\n\n- its claims comply with both legal instruments;431 and\n\n- its investment is protected by and the Tribunal has jurisdiction under both legal instruments.432\n\nDoc. **CL-10**.\n\nC I, section 5.2.\n\nC I, section 5.3.\n\nC I, section 5.4.\n\nC I, section 5.5.\n\nC I, section 5.6.\n\n312.\n\nTherefore, it asks the Tribunal to find that Respondent has violated its obligations to Claimant under \"Belarusian Law and the EEU Treaty\"433 by unlawfully expropriating its investment and violating the FET standard.\n\nC PHB, para. 100.

This statement prompted Respondent\u2019s Domestic Law Objection.\n\nToA, para. 51(d).\n\n318.\n\nClaimant rebuts Respondent\u2019s argument on the inapplicability of the Belarusian Investment Law by arguing that the plain terms of the preamble and Art. 2 of the Belarusian Investment Law show that its purpose is not only to attract investments but also to protect existing investments.441 If the law did not apply to existing investments, Respondent would be entitled to discriminate against Claimant; an absurd result.442 The purpose of the Law is not to withdraw the protection granted by the previous investment law,443 and thus the Law must apply to existing investments.\n\nC III, paras. 477-490.\n\nC III, para. 483.\n\nC III, paras. 484-486.\n\n319.\n\nIn response to Respondent\u2019s alternative arguments, Claimant contends that:\n\n- Manolium-E is a wholly-owned subsidiary, which meets the requirements to be considered as an \"investment\" under Art. 1 of the Belarusian Investment Law, and is not subject to any of the exclusions of Art. 2;444\n\n- the Belarusian courts do not have exclusive jurisdiction over the Tax or Termination Disputes because these Disputes are not included in any of the categories of disputes for which the Belarusian Code of Commercial Procedure grants the Belarusian courts exclusive jurisdiction;445 and\n\n- the present dispute does not arise under the Investment Contract, but rather under the EEU Treaty;446 hence, the dispute resolution clause in the Investment Contract does not preclude the jurisdiction of the Tribunal.447\n\nPresentation of Claimant's opening statement, Part II (Jurisdiction) [\"**H2, II**\"], slide 76.\n\nC III, paras. 491-493.\n\nC III, para. 498.\n\nC III, para. 500.\n\n**2.2** **D****ecision of the** **T****ribunal**\n------------------------------------------------\n\n320.\n\nThe Republic of Belarus enacted three successive laws for the protection of investments:\n\n- the Law \"On Foreign Investments on the Territory of the Republic of Belarus\", dated 14 November 1991;\n\n- the Investment Code dated 22 June 2011; and\n\n- the Belarusian Investment Law, which entered into force on 24 January 2014.448\n\nR III, para. 918.\n\n321.\n\nClaimant says that the Tribunal has jurisdiction to adjudicate the present dispute, not only pursuant to the EEU Treaty, but also under the Belarusian Investment Law\n\n- an averment which is denied by the Republic of Belarus.\n\n322.\n\nThe answer to this dispute is to be found in Arts. 3 and 13 of the Belarusian Investment Law:\n\n- Art. 3 acknowledges the *lex specialis* principle, providing that the special investment protection afforded by international treaties entered into by the Republic of Belarus prevails over the general protection set forth in the Belarusian Investment Law (**A.**);\n\n- while Art. 13 of the Belarusian Investment Law permits investors to access investment arbitration, but without clarifying whether it covers investments made prior to its promulgation in 2014 (**B.**)\n\n**A.** **Art. 3: the** ***lex specialis*** **principle**\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n323.\n\nArt. 3 of the Belarusian Investment Law deals with the law applicable to investments made in Belarus. Crucially, it provides that if international treaties signed by the Republic of Belarus provide distinct rules for the protection of investments, such rules take precedence over those contained in the Belarusian Investment Law:449\n\n\"Article 3. Law of the Republic of Belarus in the field of investments\n\n[...]\n\nIf the international treaty of the Republic of Belarus establishes other rules, than those that are provided by this Law, then the rules of the international treaty shall apply\". [Emphasis added].\n\nBelarusian Investment Law (Doc. **CL-10**), Art. 3.\n\n324.\n\nThe EEU Treaty, signed and ratified by Russia and Belarus after enactment of the Belarusian Investment Law, protects investments made by investors of a Member State in the territory of another Member State. There is no controversy that Claimant is a Russian investor, which holds an investment in Belarus. Thus, in matters relating to investment protection, simultaneously regulated in the EEU Treaty and in the Belarusian Investment Law, the Tribunal is bound to give preference to the EEU Treaty provisions.\n\n**B.** **Art. 13: access to international investment arbitration**\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n325.\n\nArt. 13 of the Belarusian Investment Law deals with the resolution of disputes between investors and the Republic of Belarus, and under certain circumstances permits that such disputes be adjudicated through international investment arbitration.\n\n326.\n\nThis provision gives rise to two distinct issues:\n\n- the first is whether access to arbitration is afforded only to those investors which made their investments *after* enactment of the Belarusian Investment Law in 2014 (as Respondent contends)450, or if it is open to all investors, without temporal limitation (as Claimant alleges)451 (**a.**);\n\n- the second is the compatibility between the dispute resolution method defined in the Belarusian Investment Law and the methods provided for in international investment treaties entered into by Belarus (**b.**)\n\nR III, paras. 910-920.\n\nC III, paras. 480-490.\n\n**a. Art. 13 applies only to post-2014 investments**\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n327.\n\nThe first question to be addressed is whether the dispute resolution method provided for in Art. 13 of the Belarusian Investment Law is available to investors which made their investments before promulgation of that Law. The matter has been hotly disputed by the Parties,\n\n- the Republic saying that investments made while the 1991 Investment Law and the 2011 Investment Code were in force are protected by those rules, while the 2014 Belarusian Investment Law only benefits investments made after its entry into force on 24 January 2014,\n\n- and Claimant averring the contrary: that the protection of the 2014 Belarusian Investment Law extends to prior investments.\n\n328.\n\nAs regards the interpretation of a domestic law which grants benefits to aliens, and in the absence of clear regulation of this question in the Law, the Tribunal, by majority, gives deference to the Respondent\u2019s reasonable interpretation of this Law.\n\n329.\n\nFirst, the Belarusian Investment Law does not contain any indication that it extends to existing investments. Contrary to Claimant\u2019s argument,452 the preamble of the Law does not address this question: the purpose of the Law is stated to be \"attracting investments\", \"ensuring guarantees, rights and legitimate interests of investors\". The phrase means that such guarantees and rights are provided to attract new investments, implicitly confirming that existing investments will continue to enjoy the protection afforded by the 1991 Investment Law and the 2011 Investment Code, which did not open up the possibility to access international arbitration.\n\nC III, para. 482.\n\n330.\n\nMoreover, the definition of investments covered by the Belarusian Investment Law in Art. 1 refers to \"any property... being invested in the territory of the Republic of Belarus in ways provided by this Law\", which can only mean investments made once the law was in force.\n\n331.\n\nIn addition, the preamble and other provisions of the Belarusian Investment Law are written in the present tense, which is commonly used in Russian when one undertakes an obligation in the future.453\n\nR III, para. 920.\n\n332.\n\nSecond, the wording of Art. 13 of the Belarusian Investment Law limits the investor\u2019s right to access arbitration to \"disputes between an investor and the Republic of Belarus in the carrying out of investments\" - the expression seems to be referring to future investments, made after the promulgation of the Law and thereafter giving rise to disputes with the State.\n\n333.\n\nThird, Belarus invokes Art. 67 of the Law \"On Normative Legal Acts\" of the year 2000,454 which establishes that a law, to be applied retroactively, must contain an express provision. No such provision was inserted into the Belarusian Investment Law, and consequently Claimant\u2019s investments, made long before January 2014, did not become retroactively subject to this law, but continued to be regulated by the 1991 Investment Law and the 2011 Investment Code455 - two regulations which did not afford investors the right to access international investment arbitration.456\n\nR III, para. 912, citing to Law of the Republic of Belarus No. 361-Z \"On Normative Legal Acts\" of 10 January 2000 (Doc. **RL-49**).\n\nR III, para. 914.\n\nR III, para. 917.\n\n334.\n\nSumming up, the Tribunal, by majority, finds that the better interpretation of Belarusian law is the one defended by Respondent. Claimant\u2019s investments continue to enjoy the protection afforded by the 1991 Investment Law and the 2011 Investment Code, which did not open up the possibility to access international arbitration. However, Art. 13 of the 2014 Belarusian Investment Law does not afford Claimant, whose investments were made before the Law was promulgated, and thus could not have been invested \"in ways provided by this Law\", access to international investment arbitration, with the consequence that this Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction is limited to adjudicating the present dispute under the terms of the EEU Treaty.\n\nDissenting opinion\n------------------\n\n335.\n\nArbitrator Alexandrov disagrees with this conclusion.\n\n336.\n\nFirst, while it is correct that the Belarusian Investment Law does not contain any indication that it extends to existing investments, it does not contain any indication to the contrary either. The general rule, therefore, is that the Law protects all investments; thus, pre-existing investments would be excluded only if there was a specific provision to that effect. This is consistent with the object and purpose of the Law, which includes \"ensuring guarantees, rights and legitimate interests of investors\" - all investors, not only \"future\" investors. It is also telling that Chapter II of the Law (Articles 7-10) deals with the State regulation of investments and addresses the powers of the various State organs (the President, the Government, State agencies and organizations) in the area of investments. It is illogical, indeed absurd, that such provisions would only apply to new investments.\n\n337.\n\nSecond, the argument based on the wording of Art. 13 of the Belarusian Investment Law is unavailing. Art. 13 covers \"disputes between an investor and the Republic of Belarus in the carrying out of investments.\" The majority concludes incorrectly that this provision refers only to future investments. This would only make sense if the term \"carrying out\" is interpreted to cover solely the stage of \"making\" the investment rather that the subsequent operation of the investment. But there is no doubt that the Law covers the post-establishment stage of the \"carrying out\" of an investment. Consequently, its scope cannot exclude existing investments that are at the stage of operation or post-establishment.\n\n338.\n\nThird, the principle of non-retroactive application of Belarusian laws is entirely irrelevant to this analysis. Claimant is not seeking the retroactive application of the Law. Claimant is asserting breaches of the Law after the Law\u2019s entry into force with respect to an investment that exists after the Law\u2019s entry into force. This would not be a retroactive application of the Law by any stretch of the imagination.\n\n339.\n\nTherefore, Arbitrator Alexandrov concludes that there is jurisdiction *ratione temporis* under the Belarusian Investment Law.\n\n**b. International treaties prevail over the Belarusian Investment Law**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n340.\n\nThere is a second argument which supports the Tribunal\u2019s finding that it lacks jurisdiction under the 2014 Belarusian Investment Law.\n\n341.\n\nWhen the 2014 Belarusian legislator promulgated the new Investment Law, permitting access to international arbitration, it was aware that certain investors were entitled (or could in the future become entitled) to a specific dispute resolution regime, defined (or to be defined) in investment treaties entered into by Belarus.\n\nThe last paragraph of Art. 13 regulates this situation, providing that, if there is an overlap between the dispute resolution method incorporated in the Belarusian Investment Law and that provided for in an international treaty, the latter will prevail:457\n\nArticle 13. Resolution of disputes between the investor and the Republic of Belarus\n\n[...]\n\nIn case the international treaty of the Republic of Belarus and (or) the agreement concluded between the investor and the Republic of Belarus establishes otherwise with regard to the resolution of disputes between the investor and the Republic of Belarus arising when making investments, then the provisions of the international treaty of the Republic of Belarus and (or) the agreement concluded between the investor and the Republic of Belarus shall apply\". [Emphasis added].\n\nBelarusian Investment Law (Doc. **CL-10**), Art. 13.\n\n342.\n\nThis is precisely what happened in the present case once the EEU Treaty entered into force.\n\n343.\n\nThe EEU Treaty, which entered into force on 1 January 2015, almost a year after the enactment of the Belarusian Investment Law, contains (in Art. 85 of the Protocol) a specific procedure for the settlement of investment disputes between a Russian investor and the Republic of Belarus, entitling the investor to access *ad hoc* arbitration under the UNCITRAL Rules and affording jurisdiction to the arbitral tribunal.\n\n344.\n\nArt. 13 *in fine* of the Belarusian Investment Law regulates the situation where an investor has the option to access two dispute resolution methods, one provided for in a treaty and the other in the Investment Law. The solution given in the Investment Law is that the treaty procedure will prevail.\n\n345.\n\nThe implications for this case are evident. Claimant filed the notice of arbitration in 2017. At that time, Art. 13 of the Belarusian Investment Law was in force and, thus, precluded the possibility that an investor covered by the EEU Treaty could seek access to investment arbitration based on the domestic law. Even if it is assumed *arguendo* that Claimant\u2019s investment is covered by the Belarusian Investment Law *(quod non*), the last paragraph of Art. 13 of the Law provides that the jurisdictional \"provisions of the international treaty [...] shall apply\" in preference to those of the Law.\n\nDissenting opinion\n------------------\n\n346.\n\nArbitrator Alexandrov does not share that conclusion either. During the period between 24 January 2014, when the Belarusian Investment Law entered into force, and 1 January 2015, when the EEU Treaty entered into force, there was no conflict between the two. The EEU Treaty could not apply 'in preference to\u2019 the Law prior to the EEU Treaty\u2019s Effective Date because the EEU Treaty was not yet in force. Therefore, no conflict existed prior to 1 January 2015, and the Belarusian Investment Law applied to Claimant\u2019s investment during that period.\n\n\\* \\* \\*\n\n347.\n\nIn summary: the Tribunal, by majority, accepts Respondent\u2019s Domestic Law Objection, and declares that it lacks jurisdiction to adjudicate the Termination and Tax Disputes submitted by Claimant applying the Belarusian Investment Law. The Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction emanates from the EEU Treaty, and is limited to adjudicating breaches of the obligations assumed by the Republic of Belarus under that Treaty.\n\n**3.** ***Ratione Materiae*** **O****bjection**\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n348.\n\nClaimant alleges that it made two investments in Belarus, protected under the EEU Treaty:458\n\n- financing of the design and construction of the Facilities and the Mall; and\n\n- incorporation of Manolium-E to implement the Investment Contract and finance the construction of the Facilities and the Mall.\n\nC I, para. 343.\n\n349.\n\nIn the *Ratione Materiae* Objection, Respondent contests that the alleged investments meet the requirements to be considered as such under the EEU Treaty.\n\n**3.1** **P****ositions of the** **P****arties**\n------------------------------------------------\n\n**A.** **Respondent\u2019s position**\n--------------------------------\n\n350.\n\nRespondent does not contest that Claimant is an investor in Belarus, but alleges that Claimant has failed to prove that it is the beneficial owner of the sums invested through Manolium-E459 in the Facilities. Thus, Respondent considers there is insufficient evidence that the Facilities are Claimant\u2019s \"qualifying investment\" pursuant to the EEU Treaty.460\n\nR II, para. 482.\n\nRII, paras. 482-486; R III, paras. 901-904; R PHB, para. 15.\n\n351.\n\nRespondent admits that the source of the funds received by Claimant is irrelevant to the question of whether the Tribunal has jurisdiction *ratione materiae,* but takes issue with the fact that the funds were not channeled through Claimant.461 Instead, the funds were transferred by third parties directly to Manolium-E, with Claimant itself not contributing anything or bearing any risk in respect of the Facilities. Accordingly, the Facilities are neither an investment of Claimant according to the definition of the EEU Treaty, nor as that term has been discussed in investment treaty jurisprudence.462\n\nR PHB, para. 15.\n\nR PHB, para. 15, citing to *Romak S.A.

Claimant avers that it owns 100% of the shares of Manolium-E and that the investment was structured through affiliate companies which provided loans to Manolium-E.466\n\nH2, II, slide 41.\n\nx\n\n354.\n\nClaimant argues that the Tribunal has jurisdiction *ratione materiae* for three main reasons:\n\n355.\n\nFirst, the EEU Treaty explicitly provides that incorporation is a form of investment. Since there is no dispute that Claimant incorporated a local subsidiary in Belarus, Manolium-E, this alone qualifies as an investment.467\n\nC PHB, para. 51.\n\n356.\n\nSecond, the EEU Treaty includes in its definition of investment an assignment of \"rights to engage in entrepreneurial activities granted [...] under a contract [...]\". There is no dispute that Claimant assigned some of its rights under the Investment Contract to Manolium-E.468\n\nC PHB, para. 52.\n\n357.\n\nThird, there is no dispute that Claimant\u2019s wholly-owned subsidiary, Manolium-E, spent millions of dollars on construction of the Facilities.469\n\nC PHB, para. 53.\n\n358.\n\nThus, Claimant submits it is entitled to submit direct claims based on assets of a company it controls.470\n\nH2, II, slide 41, citing to *Mera Investment Fund Limited v.

Claimant counters by saying that it incorporated a company in Belarus, and that it financed that company through intra-group loans.\n\n360.\n\nThe Tribunal will first establish the relevant facts (**A.**), then the applicable law (**B.**) and finally discuss the Objection and reach a conclusion (**C.**).\n\n**A.** **Proven facts**\n-----------------------\n\n361.\n\nOn 6 June 2003, Claimant, the Minsk Municipality and Minsktrans signed an Investment Contract,471 which authorized the Investor *(i.e.,* Claimant) to construct the Mall; in exchange, the Investor assumed the commitment to construct at its own cost certain Facilities, which were then to be transferred into the ownership of the Minsk Municipality.472\n\nInvestment Contract (Doc. **C-34**).\n\nInvestment Contract (Doc. **C-34**), clause 1.\n\n362.\n\nA year thereafter, on 18 March 2004, Claimant incorporated a wholly-owned subsidiary in Belarus, officially called \"Foreign Industrial and Commercial Private Unitary Enterprise Manolium-Engineering\" (already defined as Manolium-E), with the purpose of implementing the Investment Contract.473 Claimant paid-in a nominal capital of just USD 30,000 - as proven by the company's Charter474 and an extract from the registry of legal entities.475\n\nCertificates of State Registration of Manolium-E in the Unified State Register of Legal Entities and Individual Entrepreneurs of 18 March 2004 and 16 April 2014 (Docs. **C-5** and **C-6**); Charter of Manolium-E (Doc. **C-7**), Art. 2.1.\n\nCharter of Manolium-E (Doc. **C-7**), Arts. 6.1 and 6.2.\n\nExtract from the Unified State Register of Legal Entities and Individual Entrepreneurs on Manolium-E of 22 March 2017 (Doc. **C-3**), p. 3, item 20.\n\n363.\n\nThree years thereafter, on 8 February 2007, the Investment Contract was amended476 to incorporate Manolium-E as a party and to redefine the scope of the project. Under the Amended Investment Contract, the parties assumed specific obligations:\n\n- the investor, the Russian company Manolium, assumed the obligation to provide financing for the project, using \"their own and/or borrowed cash funds\", and to \"exercise control\" over the proper performance by Manolium-E;477\n\n- Manolium-E undertook the construction of the Facilities (which now included the Pull Station, the Road and the Depot) and the development of the Mall; and\n\n- in exchange, the Minsk Municipality undertook to make available to Manolium-E the plot of land on which the Mall was to be constructed.478\n\n4th Amendment (Doc. **C-66**), preamble, paras. 2, 5, clauses 3, 5, 8.\n\n4th Amendment (Doc. **C-66**), clauses 3.7.1 and 3.7.2.\n\n4th Amendment (Doc. **C-66**), clause 3.9.2.\n\n364.\n\nThe ultimate owner of Claimant is a Russian citizen, Mr. Aram Ekavyan,479 who controls Claimant through a number of holding companies located in the Isle of Man and in Cyprus.480 The director of Manolium-E is Mr. Andrey Dolgov, also a Russian citizen. Mr. Ekavyan and Mr. Dolgov financed Manolium-E though a complex arrangement of interest-free inter-company loans, which in total amounted to approximately USD 25 M.481 These funds were used by Manolium-E for the implementation of the Investment Contract, including the partial construction of the Facilities.\n\nAlso spelt Yekavyan.\n\nGraphic of the Flow of Capital and Financing of Claimant's Group of Companies (Doc. **C-395**).\n\nGraphic of the Flow of Capital and Financing of Claimant's Group of Companies (Doc. **C-395**); Loans provided to Manolium-E between 2003 and 2013 (Doc. **C-215**).\n\n**B.** **Applicable law**\n-------------------------\n\n365.\n\nArt. 6(7) of the Protocol contains the following definition of \"investment\":\n\n\"7) 'investments\u2019 means tangible and intangible assets invested by an investor of a Member State into subjects of entrepreneurial activity on the territory of another Member State in accordance with the legislation of the latter, including:\n\n- funds (cash), securities and other property;\n\n- rights to engage in entrepreneurial activities granted under the legislation of the Member States or under a contract, including, in particular, the right to exploration, development, production and exploitation of natural resources;\n\n- property rights and other rights having monetary value\"\n\n366.\n\nThe definition of \"investment\" in the Protocol has two elements:\n\n- first, the protected investor must provide \"tangible and intangible assets\" to a \"subject of entrepreneurial activity\" incorporated in the territory of the host State; and\n\n-second, the \"tangible and intangible assets\" which the investor must contribute include cash, rights to engage in entrepreneurial activities under a contract, and any other type of property rights or rights having monetary value.\n\n367.\n\nArt. 66 of the Protocol reiterates that the incorporation of a company constitutes an investment:\n\n\"66. Incorporation within the meaning of sub-paragraph 24 of paragraph 2 of this Protocol shall constitute a form of investment. All provisions of this Protocol, except for the provisions of paragraphs 69-74 of this Protocol, shall apply to such investments\".\n\n368.\n\n(Arts. 69-74 refer to National Treatment, Most Favoured Nation Treatment, the obligation to create favourable conditions for investments, the right to restrict activities of investors and the non-extension of double taxation treaties or of treaties on economic integration - these rules are not to be applied to investments which take the form of incorporation).\n\n369.\n\nThe Protocol defines incorporation in very broad terms, including not only the creation or acquisition of a legal entity in the host State, but also the direct or indirect control of a legal entity, the opening of a branch or representative office, and even the registration as an individual entrepreneur:\n\n\"24) 'incorporation\u2019:\n\ncreation and/or acquisition of a juridical person (participation in the capital of a created or incorporated juridical person) with any organisational legal form and form of ownership provided for by the legislation of the Member State on the territory of which such juridical person is created or incorporated;\n\nacquisition of control over a juridical person of a Member State through obtaining of an opportunity to, either directly or via third persons, determine decisions to be adopted by such juridical person, including through the management of votes granted by voting shares (stakes) and participation in the board of directors (supervisory board) and other management authorities of such juridical person;\n\nopening of a branch;\n\nopening of a representative office;\n\nregistration as an individual entrepreneur.\n\nIncorporation shall be carried out, among other things, for the purposes of trade in services and/or manufacture of goods.\"\n\n**C.** **Discussion**\n---------------------\n\n370.\n\nThe proven facts show that Claimant has indeed carried out an investment which meets the requirements set forth in the EEU Treaty:\n\n- OOO Manolium-Processing is a Russian company, whose share capital is wholly owned (indirectly through various holding companies) by a Russian citizen, Mr. Aram Ekavyan; this Russian entity incorporated and paid-in the capital of a 100%-owned subsidiary in Belarus, Manolium-E; under Art. 66 of the Protocol, such an incorporation \"shall constitute a form of investment\";\n\n- Manolium contributed to Manolium-E, as share capital, certain \"rights to engage in entrepreneurial activities granted [...] under a contract\", as required by Art. 6(7) of the Protocol: the right to implement the Investment Contract and to construct the Facilities and the Mall; this was achieved by amending, with the consent of the Minsk Municipality and of Minsktrans, the original Investment Contract;\n\n- Manolium also contributed \"fund (cash)\" to Manolium-E, as permitted by Art. 6(7) of the Protocol; the contribution was made in the form of a nominal capital contribution of USD 30,000 and complemented by various shareholder and director\u2019s loans in an amount of USD 25 M; these funds were used by Manolium-E to further its entrepreneurial activities and to partially implement the Investment Contract; the Investment Contract specifically authorizes Claimant to finance the construction of the Facilities and the Mall with \"own and/or borrowed cash funds\";482 and\n\n- as a result of its entrepreneurial activities, Manolium-E constructed and became the owner of the Facilities - another form of investment protected under Art. 6(7) of the Protocol.\n\n4th Amendment (Doc. **C-66**), clause 3.7.1.\n\n371.\n\nRespondent argues, in defense of its *Ratione Materiae* Objection, that the funds used to finance the entrepreneurial facilities were transferred by third parties directly to Manolium-E, bypassing Claimant, with Claimant not contributing anything or bearing any risk.483\n\nR PHB para. 15.\n\n372.\n\nThe Tribunal disagrees.\n\n373.\n\nArt. 6(7) of the Protocol defines \"investments\" by requiring that a protected investor create a \"subject of entrepreneurial activity\" in Belarus and then make certain contributions to that entity. That is exactly what Claimant did: it incorporated a subsidiary in Belarus, and through that subsidiary carried out entrepreneurial activities in Belarus, consisting in the design and construction of the Facilities and the Mall, in accordance with the Investment Contract. These activities were financed by a small capital contribution and in their major part through inter-company loans, granted by companies controlled by Mr. Ekavyan, a Russian citizen, who is the ultimate owner of Claimant, and (in a smaller percentage) by Mr. Dolgov, also a Russian citizen, the director of Manolium-E.\n\n374.\n\nManolium-E\u2019s entrepreneurial activities have been (in their major part) financed not directly by Claimant, but by other companies controlled by Messrs. Ekavyan and Dolgov, two Russian citizens, who are Manolium-E\u2019s ultimate shareholder and director, respectively. The way in which Claimant chose to finance its investment in Belarus does not affect its status as an investment under the EEU Treaty. The Treaty, with good reason, does not impose any restriction on how investors finance the entrepreneurial activities of the Belarusian subsidiaries. This may be done through capital contributions, through financing by third parties or - as has happened in this case - through inter-company loans, from entities which belong to the same group or are related to shareholders or directors; whichever alternative is chosen, the status as protected investment under the EEU Treaty remains unaffected.\n\n375.\n\n*Ubi lex non distinguit nec nos distinguere debemus.*\n\n*Romak*\n-------\n\n376.\n\nRespondent draws the Tribunal\u2019s attention to the award in *Romak.*484 This decision stands for the conclusion that the term \"investment\" has a meaning in itself, which cannot be ignored when considering the list of examples contained in the relevant treaty; the inherent meaning entails a contribution that extends over a certain period of time and that involves risk.485\n\nDoc. **RL-140**.\n\n*Romak* (Doc. **RL-140**), paras. 180 and 207.\n\n377.\n\nThere are marked differences between the facts underlying *Romak,* which involved a wheat supply agreement, and the present arbitration, where Claimant incorporated a subsidiary in Belarus, and where that subsidiary carried out entrepreneurial activities for a period of several years.\n\n378.\n\nThe discussion about the \"inherent meaning of an investment\" is relevant where (as happened in *Romak*), the alleged investment consists in a contract, and the tribunal is called upon to establish whether that contract is a commercial transaction, which cannot be protected as an investment, or whether the contract has certain \"inherent characteristics\" which are typical for all types of investment, and consequently merits protection under the relevant investment treaty.\n\n379.\n\nIn the present case, where Claimant\n\n- incorporated and made a capital contribution to a subsidiary in Belarus,\n\n- assumed the legal and financial risk of being the 100% shareholder of a Belarusian company, and\n\n- secured financing from other entities of the group,\n\n- to enable the Belarusian subsidiary to carry out, over a period of several years, an entrepreneurial activity in Belarus, consisting in the construction of the Facilities and the development of the Mall,\n\nthe discussion is inapposite. Whatever definition of investment is applied, whatever its \"inherent meaning\", there can be no doubt that foreign direct investment, where the foreign investor directly owns and manages an enterprise situated in the host country, and such enterprise carries out entrepreneurial activities in the host country, qualifies as such.486\n\n*Edenred S.A. v.

Claimant argues that it is a common practice for States to conceal expropriations through tax measures.493 In such cases, tribunals have held that the guise of taxation will not save the host State from liability for actions, based on an abuse of tax laws, if such actions result in the total loss or a substantial impairment of the investment.494\n\nC III, para. 600; H2, III, slide 10, citing to *UP and C.D Holding Internationale v.

Respondent\u2019s position**\n----------------------------\n\n397.\n\nRespondent submits that the transfer of the Facilities into municipal ownership does not constitute an expropriation.506 Belarus submits:507\n\n- that it did not commit an abuse of tax law (i);\n\n- that Claimant and Manolium-E caused the accrual of the tax liabilities which were enforced against the Facilities (ii); and\n\n- that in any case the conditions for a lawful expropriation under Art. 79 of the Protocol have been satisfied (iii).\n\nR II, para. 638.\n\nR III, para. 1115.\n\n(i) Abuse of tax law\n--------------------\n\n398.\n\nRespondent agrees with Claimant that an abuse of tax law may constitute an indirect expropriation.508 However, Respondent submits that Claimant\u2019s allegations are unfounded, for the following reasons:509\n\nR III, para. 1114.\n\nR III, para. 1122.\n\n399.\n\nFirst, Manolium-E was liable under Belarusian law to pay Land Tax for the Facilities Land Plots. Claimant has failed to support its allegations that the taxes were imposed arbitrarily :510 to the contrary, Claimant was fully aware that as long as Manolium-E continued to occupy the Facilities Land Plots it was liable for the Land Tax.511\n\nR III, para. 1123.\n\nR III, paras. 1126-1129.\n\n400.\n\nSecond, Respondent alleges that the Minsk Municipality acted reasonably and proportionately:\n\n- Manolium-E failed to request the extension of the Land Permits necessary to continue construction after the Commissioning Date;512\n\n- Claimant\u2019s proposals to postpone the contractual deadlines were unreasonable or impracticable - particularly given Claimant\u2019s previous breaches;513\n\n- while the Investment Contract was in force, under its terms the Minsk Municipality was prevented from accepting the Facilities in an incomplete state;514 and\n\n- upon termination of the Investment Contract, the valuations of the Facilities were carried out in breach of agreed instructions, did not acknowledge the outstanding amounts required for finalization of the construction and did no properly represent the value of the Facilities.515\n\nR III, para. 1135.\n\nR III, paras. 1135-1136.\n\nR III, para. 1137 (a).\n\nR III, para. 1137(b).\n\n401.\n\nThird, the tax authorities acted transparently, setting out the legal basis for the tax assessments and providing Manolium-E with the opportunity to raise objections at every step.516 When the Economic Court of Minsk ordered the enforcement of the tax liability against the Facilities, Manolium-E chose not to appeal.517 Claimant\u2019s failure to object to the conduct of the tax authorities shows there was no abuse of tax law.518\n\nR III, para. 1140. Respondent alleges that Claimant does not dispute that:  \n- the Tax Inspectorate demanded that Manolium-E comply with its obligations to submit land tax returns in early 2014, which Manolium-E ignored;  \n- the Tax Inspectorate sent copies of its first audit report on 17 May 2016, to which Manolium-E did not raise any objection;  \n- the Tax Inspectorate sent a document setting out the amendments and supplements to its first audit report of 17 May 2016 to Manolium-E on 21 June 2016, to which Manolium-E did not raise any objection; and  \n- the Tax Inspectorate sent copies of its decision setting out the grounds for and calculation of Manolium-E's outstanding land tax liabilities on 19 July 2016, which Manolium-E chose not to appeal.\n\nR III, para. 1141.\n\nR III, paras. 1142-1143.\n\n402.\n\nFinally, Manolium-E\u2019s tax liabilities were not imposed at the President\u2019s instruction.519 Respondent explains that the President\u2019s instruction of 10 October 2016 and the Presidential Order of 20 January 2017 were issued as part of the procedure for enforcing Manolium-E\u2019s tax liabilities, and only gave effect to the Attachment and Enforcement Orders.\n\nR III, paras. 1144-1148.\n\n(ii) Claimant\u2019s and Manolium-E\u2019s own conduct\n--------------------------------------------\n\n403.\n\nRespondent says that Claimant has not satisfied the burden of proving that the Land Tax liabilities that were set off against the value of the Facilities in 2017 resulted from conduct attributable to the State in breach of international standards.520\n\nR II, para. 641; R III, paras. 1149-1152.\n\n404.\n\nTo the contrary, Respondent alleges that it was Claimant\u2019s and Manolium-E\u2019s own negligent actions and omissions which caused the accrual of the Land Tax liabilities:521\n\n- Claimant and Manolium-E negligently failed to complete the construction of the Facilities due to their own inability or unwillingness to finance the construction works;522\n\n- Manolium-E negligently failed to apply for extension of its Land Permits, which caused a significant increase in its Land Tax liabilities;523\n\n- Claimant was fully aware that Manolium-E was liable to pay Land Tax but ignored it;524 and\n\n- Claimant and Manolium-E chose not to raise objections to or appeal the Tax Inspectorate\u2019s first tax assessment against Manolium-E of 17 May 2016 and its amendment of 21 June 2016, the Enforcement Order or the deed of 27 January 2017 transferring the Facilities into the communal ownership of the Minsk Municipality.525\n\nR III, para. 1153.\n\nR III, paras. 1156-1160.\n\nR III, paras. 1159-1163.\n\nR III, paras. 1164-1165.\n\nR III, paras. 1166-1172.\n\n(iii) Illegal expropriation\n---------------------------\n\n405.\n\nRespondent submits that the transfer of the Facilities did not amount to an expropriation. However, if the Tribunal were to disagree, Respondent says that the\n\nnecessary requirements under Art. 79 of the Protocol were satisfied, making the expropriation lawful.526\n\nR III, paras. 1173-1184.\n\n406.\n\nAs regards the first criterion, that the measures be carried out in accordance with the legislation of the State, Respondent submits that the assessment and enforcement of the Land Tax was conducted entirely in accordance with Belarusian law and procedure. Thus, the first criterion is fulfilled.527\n\nR III, para. 1174.\n\n407.\n\nAs for the second criterion, that the measures be for the public benefit, Respondent alleges that the enforcement of domestic tax laws in accordance with the prescribed procedures and respecting the rights of investors, falls squarely within sovereign measures for the public benefit. Thus, the second criterion is also satisfied.528\n\nR III, para. 1175.\n\n408.\n\nAs regards the third criterion, that the measures not be discriminatory, Claimant has failed to allege that the tax authorities discriminated against Manolium-E in any way. Accordingly, Respondent submits that the third criterion is satisfied.529\n\nR III, para. 1176.\n\n409.\n\nFinally, as regards the criterion that the measures involve \"prompt and adequate consideration\", Respondent alleges that tribunals have consistently held that adequate compensation is the fair market value of the investment.530 Respondent argues that it is for Claimant to prove that the valuation of the Facilities made by the Minsk Cadaster Agency in 2016, which was used to set off Manolium-E's tax liabilities, was not appropriate.531 Furthermore, under Belarusian law Claimant could have challenged the deed of 27 January 2017 transferring the Facilities to the Mink Municipality and the underlying valuation of the Minsk Cadaster Agency, but chose not to do so.532\n\nR III, paras. 1177-1178.\n\nR III, paras. 1180-1182.\n\nR III, para. 1182.\n\n**B.** **Decision of the Tribunal**\n-----------------------------------\n\n410.\n\nClaimant submits that Respondent adopted the following measures, which, considered as a whole, resulted in the indirect533 expropriation of the Facilities in violation of Art. 79 of the Protocol, without prompt and adequate compensation:534\n\n- Respondent imposed illegitimate tax liabilities and seized the Facilities;\n\n- Respondent transferred the Facilities into municipal ownership by Presidential Order;\n\n- Respondent refused to pay compensation for the Facilities; and\n\n- Respondent sold the right to develop the Mall Land Plot to a third party.\n\nC I, paras. 513 *et seq*; H2, III, slide 9.\n\nC III, paras. 584, 585, 590, 604 and 605; H2, III, slide 11.\n\n411.\n\nBelarus disagrees. It alleges that the transfer of the Facilities into municipal ownership does not constitute an expropriation.535 Furthermore, Respondent submits that it did not commit an abuse of tax law: what happened was that Claimant consented that Manolium-E accrue tax liabilities, which it failed to pay, and eventually Belarus had to enforce the outstanding debts against the Facilities.536 Subsidiarily, Belarus avers that the conditions for a lawful expropriation under Art. 79 of the Protocol have been satisfied.537\n\nR II, para. 638.\n\nR III, paras. 1153-1155.\n\nR III, paras. 1173-1184.\n\n**a. Prohibition of expropriation under Art. 79 of the Protocol**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n412.\n\nArts. 79 to 81, within Section VII(4) of the Protocol, record the guarantees provided to investors against unlawful expropriation. Art. 79 of the Protocol reads as follows:\n\n\"79. Investments of investors of a Member State made on the territory of another Member State shall not be subject to direct or indirect expropriation, nationalisation and other measures with consequences equivalent to those of expropriation or nationalisation (hereinafter 'expropriation'), except in cases where such measures are taken for the public benefit in the procedure determined by the legislation of the recipient state, are not discriminatory and involve prompt and adequate compensation\". [Emphasis added]\n\n413.\n\nArt. 79 of the Protocol contains a general prohibition against three types of dispossession measures taken by the host State:\n\n- expropriations,\n\n- nationalizations, and\n\n- other measures with equivalent consequences.\n\n414.\n\nAs a rule, such measures are improper; as an exception, they are licit if the host State meets four cumulative requirements:\n\n- the measure is taken for the public benefit,\n\n- in accordance with the procedure determined by the host State's legislation,\n\n- it is not discriminatory, and\n\n- the investor receives prompt and adequate compensation.\n\nMeasures\n--------\n\n415.\n\nThe concept of \"measures\" used in Art. 79 of the Protocol, is defined in Art. 6(11) of the Protocol:\n\n\"11) 'measure of a Member State\u2019 means the legislation of a Member State, as well as any decision, action or omission of an authority or official of that Member State adopted or applied at any level of state or local authorities or organisations in the exercise of the powers delegated thereto by such authorities.\" [Emphasis added]\n\n416.\n\nThe term \"legislation of a Member State\" is defined by Art. 6(5) of the Protocol:\n\n\"5) 'legislation of a Member State\u2019 means legislation and other regulatory legal acts of a Member State.\"\n\n417.\n\nConsequently, the term \"measures\" encompasses all\n\n- administrative acts taken by the Belarusian State, including its agencies and territorial bodies; and\n\n- legislative acts of general application formalized as laws approved by Parliament or as decrees or other regulations authorized by the Government, and\n\n- judicial decisions.538\n\nSee paras. 591-593 *infra*.\n\nExpropriation, nationalization\n------------------------------\n\n418.\n\nThe EEU Treaty does not provide a definition of \"expropriation\" or \"nationalization\", but the terms are well established international law concepts.\n\n419.\n\nIn an \"expropriation\" a State, exercising its sovereign powers, dispossesses an investor of a protected investment, depriving the investor of the use and benefit (but not necessarily of the ownership or title) of the investment. The definition of expropriation is centered on the taking suffered by the investor: there is no requirement that the investor\u2019s loss translate into enrichment of the State (or of the State\u2019s designee) - although typically expropriations will result in wealth passing from the investor to the state, to a public entity, or to a private beneficiary favoured by the State.\n\n420.\n\n\"Nationalization\" is a concept analogous to expropriation, where control of the expropriated assets, normally complete industrial sectors of the economy or certain types of natural resources, is taken over by the State or a State controlled entity.539\n\nBrownlie, I., *Principles of Public International Law*, 2008, p. 532; *OI European Group B.V. v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela*, ICSID Case No. ARB/11/25, Award dated 10 March 2015 [\"***OIEG v. Venezuela***\"], para. 328.\n\nIndirect expropriation or equivalent measures\n---------------------------------------------\n\n421.\n\nStates have traditionally taken property from aliens by means of direct expropriations, *i.e.,* by overt administrative or legislative measures declaring the State's decision to dispossess the foreign investor. Such direct expropriations have, however, become less frequent,540 while the number of so-called \"indirect expropriations\" has increased:541 these latter measures are characterized by State interferences, sometimes formalized as legislative acts of general application, sometimes as administrative or tax measures, which result in a destruction or significant erosion of the investor's assets, without outright taking of the property.542\n\nStern, B., \"In Search of the Frontiers of Indirect Expropriation\" in Rovine, A.W, *Contemporary Issues in International Arbitration and Mediation*, Fordham Paper 2007, pp. 31-53.\n\nHoffmann, A. K., \"Indirect Expropriation\" in Reinisch, A., *Standards of Investment Protection*, 2008, p. 151.\n\nUNCTAD, *Taking of Property*, Series on Issues in International Investment Agreements, 2000, p. 20.\n\n422.\n\nArt. 79 of the Protocol acknowledges this shift and (like most bilateral and multilateral investment treaties) extends the scope of protection to cover \"indirect expropriations\", defined as \"measures with consequences equivalent to those of expropriation or nationalization\". Other treaties use similar definitions, referring to \"measures equivalent to\" or \"tantamount to\" expropriation.543 Whatever the precise wording, when treaties use these expressions, they refer to measures which substantially deprive the investor of the fundamental attributes of property, including the right to use, enjoy and dispose of its investment, without formal transfer of title or outright seizure.544\n\n\\* \\* \\*\n\nThere is widespread inconsistency in the use of concepts; but it is commonly held that indirect, creeping, *de facto*, disguised, regulatory expropriations are used interchangeably (Muchlinski, P., Ortino, F. and Schreuer, C., *The Oxford Handbook of International Investment Law*, 2008, p. 422; McLachlan, C., Shore, L. and Weiniger, M., *International Investment Arbitration: Substantive Principles*, 2007, p. 292).\n\n*See e.g.* the definition contained in the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA) between Canada, and the European Union and its Member States, of 30 October 2016, Annex 8-A, 1(b).\n\n423.\n\nHaving established the proper interpretation of Art. 79 of the Protocol, the Tribunal will now analyze expropriation through taxation, *i.e.*, the use of tax laws as a measure tantamount to expropriation (**b.**).\n\n**b. Expropriatory taxation**\n-----------------------------\n\n424.\n\nStates are sovereign, and sovereignty implies the right to regulate the general welfare. The State's sovereign rights are especially intense in matters of taxation: a sovereign State, in furtherance of what it perceives to be the common good and general welfare, has the right to enact and enforce tax legislation increasing, reducing or re-distributing the financial burden imposed on taxpayers, including foreign investors. Tax inevitably results in a taking by the State of taxpayers' assets, but it does not constitute an expropriation and is not compensable.545\n\n*Burlington* (Doc. **CL-103**), para. 391.\n\n425.\n\nThere is a general presumption that measures adopted by States are intended for the furtherance of the common good. When assessing tax measures and their enforcement, tribunals must assume that the State acted *bona fide*, unless there is convincing evidence to the contrary. In the words of the *Quasar de Valores* tribunal:546\n\n\"181. The preceding observations are not meant to suggest that international tribunals should quickly reach the conclusion that ostensible tax measures are in fact compensable takings. To the contrary, the presumption must be that measures are *bona fide,* unless there is convincing evidence that, upon a true characterisation, they constitute a taking\". [Emphasis added]\n\n*Quasar de Valores SICAV S.A., Orgor de Valores SICAV S.A., GBI 9000 SICAV S.A. and ALOS 34 S.L. v. The Russian Federation*, SCC Case No. 24/2007, Award dated 20 July 2012 [\"***Quasar de Valores***\"] (Doc. **RL-61**), para. 181.\n\n426.\n\nThe proposition that States must be granted deference in matters of taxation cannot be misconstrued to grant States discretion whether or not to comply with their international treaty obligations.547 Indeed, the State\u2019s sovereign right to impose taxation and enforce tax laws can also be misused, as acknowledged by the tribunal in *Rosinvest:*548\n\n\"On the other hand, it is generally accepted that the mere fact that the measures by a host state are taken in the form of application and enforcement of its tax law, does not prevent a tribunal from examining whether this conduct of the host state must be considered, under the applicable BIT or other international treaties on investment protection, as an abuse of tax law to in fact enact an expropriation\". [Emphasis added]\n\n*Quasar de Valores* (Doc. **RL-61**), para. 179.\n\n*RosInvest* (Doc. **CL-117**), para. 628.\n\nLimits to the State\u2019s power to tax\n----------------------------------\n\n427.\n\nLimits to the State\u2019s power to tax derive (in the absence, as happens in this case, of a specific regulation in the applicable Treaty) from customary international law. In the words of the *Burlington* tribunal:549\n\n\"Customary international law imposes two limitations on the power to tax. Taxes may not be discriminatory and they may not be confiscatory.\" [Emphasis added]\n\n*Burlington* (Doc. **CL-103**), para. 393.\n\n428.\n\nClaimant is not alleging discrimination. The Tribunal is thus only concerned with confiscatory taxes: those which impose a charge of such magnitude, that taxpayers are forced to abandon their property in the hands of the State or to sell assets at a distressed price.550 Customary international law prohibits that States impose confiscatory taxes on aliens, depriving them of their properties.\n\n*Burlington* (Doc. **CL-103**), para. 393.\n\n429.\n\nWhen a foreign investor is protected by an international investment treaty, an additional protection against abusive taxation arises. Excessive taxation or improper enforcement of tax obligations can result in an unlawful expropriation, in breach of the treaty, provided that the measures produce the effect required by any indirect expropriation: that the investor be deprived of the totality (or at least of a material part) of its investment. In the words of the *Rosinvest* tribunal, a taxation measure is expropriatory if it has\n\n\"the effect of a substantial deprivation of property forming all or a material part of the investment, and the measure is attributable to Respondent.\"551 [Emphasis added]\n\n*RosInvest* (Doc. **CL-117**), para. 623.\n\n430.\n\nConfiscatory taxation (under customary international law) and expropriatory taxation (in breach of an applicable investment treaty) are in fact equivalent concepts. Both hinge on the effects of the measure, which must consist in the investor being deprived of the investment (or at least of a material part thereof). A temporary reduction in value, a loss of expected profits or similar misfortunes affecting the investment, do not cause an indirect expropriation or a confiscation. Expropriation requires that the investor prove that title or ownership over the investment has been lost, or that the investment\u2019s capacity to generate a return has been virtually extinguished.552\n\n*Sergei Paushok, CJSC Golden East Company and CJSC Vostokneftegaz Company v. The Government of Mongolia*, UNCITRAL, Award on Jurisdiction and Liability dated 28 April 2011 [\"***Paushok***\"] (Doc. **CL-29**), paras. 331-334; *Burlington* (Doc. **CL-103**), para. 399.\n\nAbuse of tax law\n----------------\n\n431.\n\nIn addition to the effect of the tax measure, the State\u2019s intent is another factor which must be considered to draw the line between the general rule and the exception, between permissible taxation and confiscatory/expropriatory taxation.\n\n432.\n\nThere are many cases where an investor may lose the investment, but the State does not carry out confiscatory or expropriatory taxation:\n\n- an investor may lose the investment because of a reckless decision to improperly withhold payment of taxes validly imposed by the State; or\n\n- the tax authorities\u2019 decision to enforce outstanding tax liabilities may provoke the demise of an enterprise which already was in financial difficulties.\n\n433.\n\nThese cases do not attract State responsibility, and they must be distinguished from situations where the State abused the tax law, using taxation not to legitimately obtain resources for the general welfare, but to deprive a foreign investor of its enterprise or other investment. To prove abuse, the investor may show that when it adopted the taxation or enforcement measure, the State acted with *mens rea*, with the objective of appropriating property rightfully belonging to the investor.\n\n434.\n\nThe tribunal in *Quasar de Valores* explained that the purpose of the measures adopted by the Russian Federation had been the expropriation of the investor, justifying a finding of expropriation through taxation:553\n\n\"Yukos' tax delinquency was indeed a pretext for seizing Yukos assets and transferring them to Rosneft. [...] This finding supports the Claimants' contention that the Russian Federation's real goal was to expropriate Yukos, and not to legitimately collect taxes.\"\n\n*Quasar de Valores* (Doc. **RL-61**), para. 177.\n\nArbitrariness\n-------------\n\n435.\n\nAnother factor which supports a finding of expropriation is arbitrariness.\n\n436.\n\nThe tribunal in *Tza Yap Shum* summarized existing case law, saying that it shows\n\n\"a considerable consensus that the imposition and application of tax measures can acquire expropriatory character if [the measures] are confiscatory, arbitrary, abusive or discriminatory\"554 [Emphasis added].\n\n*Se\u00f1or Tza Yap Shum v.

In its enquiry the Tribunal will first establish the proven facts (**c.**), before adopting its decision (**d.**).\n\nc. **Proven facts**\n-------------------\n\n439.\n\nThe Tribunal has examined in detail the proven facts in section III above. In this section it will summarize those aspects which are relevant for the discussion of whether Respondent committed an expropriation.\n\n440.\n\nFirst, in September 2014, the Economic Court of Minsk issued its decision, declaring the Investment Contract terminated.\n\n441.\n\nIn accordance with Art. 682 of the Belarusian Civil Code, when a contract to construct immovable property on alien land is commenced and thereafter terminated, the owner of the land retains the right to require transfer of the facilities which have been built, but must compensate the constructor for the costs incurred.556\n\nDoc. **CL-155**.\n\n442.\n\nIn accordance with this general principle, upon termination of the Investment Contract, the Minsk Municipality, as the owner of the land, was entitled to the transfer of the Facilities, while Manolium-E, as constructor of the Facilities, was entitled to be reimbursed for its expenses. Aware of its legal obligation, the Minsk Municipality initiated a new round of negotiations, with the aim of agreeing the compensation owed to Manolium-E.\n\n443.\n\nRespondent has argued that the Investment Contract does not qualify as a construction contract, and that Art. 682 of the Belarusian Civil Code is not applicable, because Manolium-E was required to enter into subcontracts, obtain construction permits, engage a designer and finance the construction.557 Respondent\u2019s argument is difficult to follow: to finance the transaction, to engage subcontractors and designers and to obtain all necessary building permits are typical traits of construction contracts.\n\nR III para. 28.\n\n444.\n\nSecond, in order to agree on the compensation due to Manolium-E, consultants from the MoF and two other public agencies conducted an audit of Manolium-E\u2019s commercial and financial activities and on 22 February 2016 rendered the MoF Report, concluding that the documented costs incurred by Manolium-E in the construction of the Facilities amounted to USD 19.4 M.558\n\nMoF Report (Doc. **C-160**), p. 15.\n\n445.\n\nThird, the outcome of the MoF Report did not satisfy the Minsk Municipality: it was reluctant to pay, out of its own budget, an amount of almost USD 20 M to Manolium-E, as compensation for the construction of the (still unfinished) Facilities.\n\n446.\n\nOn 29 February 2016, the Minsk Municipality, after a meeting with representatives of all agencies involved in the preparation of the MoF Report, wrote an extensive letter to the Council of Ministers of the Republic of Belarus and attached a draft report for the President, rejecting the conclusions of the MoF Report because \"the audit was largely performed without establishing the facts of actual works carried out.\"559\n\nLetter from MCEC to the Council of Ministers of the Republic of Belarus of 29 February 2016 (Doc. **R-140**), pp. 1-2.\n\n447.\n\nThe Minsk Municipality proposed an alternative solution to the Council of Ministers, which would secure the gratuitous transfer of the Facilities Land Plots into municipal ownership.\n\n448.\n\nThe Minsk Municipality averred that Manolium-E had outstanding liabilities to the State budget amounting to USD 24.4 M, far in excess of the compensation determined in the MoF Report.560 These liabilities resulted basically from two items: the accrual of the Land Tax on the Facilities Land Plots (USD 19.6 M), plus the sum required to complete the construction and commissioning of the Facilities, which the Municipality estimated at USD 4.7 M.\n\nLetter from MCEC to the Council of Ministers of the Republic of Belarus of 29 February 2016 (Doc. **R-140**), p. 2.\n\n449.\n\nBased on this information, the Minsk Municipality submitted a plan to the Council of Ministers, which was consistent with the Municipality\u2019s long-standing objective of achieving the gratuitous transfer of the Facilities into municipal ownership. The plan was comprised of two steps:\n\n- first Claimant and Manolium-E would be invited to accept the transfer for free of the Facilities into municipal ownership; and\n\n- second, should Claimant or Manolium-E disagree, and refuse the free transfer, the second leg of the plan would be activated: the tax authorities would order Manolium-E to pay the outstanding Land Tax, and if Manolium-E failed to do so, the Minsk Municipality would enforce the debt through the courts and foreclose on the Facilities.561\n\nLetter from MCEC to the Council of Ministers of the Republic of Belarus of 29 February 2016 (Doc. **R-140**), pp. 2-3.\n\n450.\n\nFourth, the plan was implemented.\n\n451.\n\nAs a first step, the Minsk Municipality filed a Second Administrative Proceeding, to reverse the findings of the First Administrative Proceeding. The Belarusian courts eventually found that Manolium-E, by failing to return the Facilities Land Plots, had made an unauthorized use of such Plots and had committed an administrative offence\n\n452.\n\nAs a second step, the Tax Inspectorate carried out a tax audit to establish Manolium-E\u2019s Land Tax liability for the years 2013 through 2016. A first audit calculated this liability to amount to only BYR 18,538 M and late payment penalties to BYR 4,380 M, but these calculations were redone within a few weeks, and an increased tax liability was established: under the new calculation Manolium-E\u2019s Land Tax liability increased to BYR 200,464 M, approximately ten times more than the previous calculation;562 late payment penalties increased 15 times to BYR 63,976 M.563 An additional administrative fine of BYR 46,000 M was added shortly thereafter.\n\nLetter from the Tax Inspectorate to Manolium-E of 21 June 2016 (Doc. **C-165**), p. 2.\n\nLetter from the Tax Inspectorate to Manolium-E of 21 June 2016 (Doc. **C-165**), p. 4.\n\n453.\n\nFifth, upon Manolium-E\u2019s failure to pay the Land Tax liability, the tax administration initiated enforcement procedures and on 18 August 2016 a court issued an Enforcement Order, authorizing the tax authorities to collect from Manolium-E \"on account\" of the Facilities.564\n\nEnforcement Order (Doc. **C-170**).\n\n454.\n\nSixth, transfer of real estate assets into municipal ownership required a Presidential Order,565 preceded by an inventory566 and an expert evaluation.567\n\nRegulation \"On accounting, safekeeping, evaluation and sale of confiscated, attached or forfeited assets\" adopted by President's Decree No. 63 dated 19 February 2016 (Doc. **RL-126**), Art. 165.\n\nRegulation \"On accounting, safekeeping, evaluation and sale of confiscated, attached or forfeited assets\" adopted by President's Decree No. 63 dated 19 February 2016 (Doc. **RL-126**), Arts. 248 and 249.\n\nRegulation \"On accounting, safekeeping, evaluation and sale of confiscated, attached or forfeited assets\" adopted by President's Decree No. 63 dated 19 February 2016 (Doc. **RL-126**), Art. 43.\n\n455.\n\nOn 20 January 2017, the President of the Republic of Belarus issued the Presidential Order that permitted the transfer of the Facilities into the ownership of Minsk, without consideration:568\n\n\"To transfer without consideration into the ownership of Minsk property that is owned by [Manolium-E], said property having been attached by the [Tax Inspectorate] by way of [an order dated 5 July 2016], towards payment of [Manolium-E\u2019s] arrears to the budget of Minsk, which are subject to collection based on a ruling [...] issued by the Economic Court of Minsk on 18 August 2016.\"\n\nPresidential Order (Doc. **R-242**).\n\n456.\n\nThe Presidential Order set off Manolium-E\u2019s liabilities569 in an amount equivalent to the value of the property, which it established at BYN 27.3 M.570 The principal of Manolium-E\u2019s tax liability (BYN 20.0 M) was completely written off,571 but the value of the assets transferred was insufficient to extinguish the totality of Manolium-E\u2019s outstanding debt.572 After the transfer, Manolium-E still owed Belarus BYN 6.3 M.573\n\nPresidential Order (Doc. **R-242**).\n\nAppendix to the Presidential Order (Doc. **R-242**), p. 5. This was consistent with Statement No. 004819 of property inventory and evaluation (Doc. **R-147**), in which Manolium-E's property was also valued at BYR 27,287,748.05.\n\nR II, para. 349.\n\nR II, paras. 349-350.\n\nR II, paras. 349-350; Letter from the Tax Inspectorate to Manolium-E of 28 April 2017 (Doc. **R-151**).\n\n457.\n\nSeventh, once the transfer of the Facilities had taken place, on 8 February 2017 the Economic Court of Minsk ordered the commencement of bankruptcy proceedings against Manolium-E and appointed an insolvency administrator.574\n\nOfficial portal of the system of general jurisdiction courts of the Republic of Belarus, *Information on cases in connection with economic insolvency (bankruptcy) for the period from 1 February 2017 through 28 February 2017* (Doc **C-179**).\n\n458.\n\nAs a result of the bankruptcy proceedings, in March 2017 the Tax Inspectorate conducted a second, comprehensive tax audit of all of Manolium-E\u2019s tax liabilities starting from 2010.575 On 24 March 2017, the Tax Inspectorate issued its report concluding that Manolium-E owed a total tax liability of BYN 14.5 M.576\n\nR II, para. 356.\n\nUnscheduled field audit report of Manolium-E in connection with economic insolvency (bankruptcy) of 24 March 2017 (Doc. **C-187**).\n\n459.\n\nOn 13 June 2017, the Tax Inspectorate issued its decision to recover from Manolium-E the tax liability due pursuant to the second tax audit.577 By 22 September 2017, Manolium-E's total indebtedness to the state amounted to BYN 20.9 M.578\n\nDecision No. 121 of the Tax Inspectorate of 13 June 2017 on the Unscheduled desk tax audit report of Manolium-E of 24 March 2017 No. 543 with amendments dated 18 May 2017 (Doc. **C-188**).\n\nR II, para. 362; Amendments of 18 May 2017 to the Unscheduled field audit report of Manolium-E No. 543 dated 24 March 2017 (Doc. **C-186**).\n\n460.\n\nManolium-E's only relevant asset had been the Facilities, which had been transferred into municipal ownership without payment of any compensation. Devoid of other assets, Manolium-E was confronted with a BYN 20.9 M tax liability vis-\u00e0-vis the Belarusian State. The value of Claimant's shareholding in Manolium-E had been reduced no nil.\n\n**d. The Respondent committed an indirect expropriation, in breach of Art. 79 of the Protocol**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n461.\n\nThe Tribunal has already found that States are empowered to impose taxation, on citizens and aliens. Although the law assumes that the State uses its taxation powers *bona fide* in the furtherance of the common good, such powers are not unfettered: taxes may not be confiscatory nor discriminatory, nor result in the unlawful expropriation of the investor's protected assets, in breach of the treaty provisions.\n\n462.\n\nThe first requirement which a taxation or enforcement measure must meet, in order to be considered as an unlawful expropriation, is that such measure cause the effect necessary for any indirect expropriation: that the investor be deprived of the totality (or at least a substantial part) of its investment.\n\n463.\n\nAssuming that deprivation has occurred, other factors which must be considered, to draw the line between permissible and expropriatory taxation, are whether the State committed an abuse of tax law or whether its actions were arbitrary.\n\n464.\n\nIn the present case, the Tribunal finds that the taxation and enforcement measures adopted by the Republic of Belarus caused consequences equivalent to those of an expropriation in breach of Art. 79 of the Protocol:\n\n- the taxation and enforcement measures resulted in (i) Manolium-E being deprived of the Facilities, which were transferred to the Minsk Municipality without compensation, and (ii) Claimant being deprived of the value of its shareholding in Manolium-E, which was reduced to nil (**e.**);\n\n- the Minsk Municipality, aided and abetted by other organs of the Belarusian State, including the President of the Republic, committed an abuse of tax law: the purpose of the tax and enforcement measures adopted against Manolium-E was to achieve transfer of the Facilities for free, without paying the compensation to which Manolium-E was entitled (**f.**); and\n\n- the tax and enforcement measures adopted by the Belarusian authorities against Manolium-E inflicted unnecessary damage on the investor, without serving any apparent legitimate purpose, and must therefore be considered as arbitrary (**g.**).\n\n**e. Deprivation**\n------------------\n\n465.\n\nThe tax and enforcement measures adopted by the Republic of Belarus resulted in the deprivation of Manolium-E and of Claimant:\n\nManolium-E\n----------\n\n466.\n\nBefore the adoption of the tax and enforcement measures, Manolium-E held title over the Facilities, which the company had constructed, in accordance with the Investment Contract, on land plots owned by the Minsk Municipality. Upon termination of the Investment Contract, Art. 682 of the Belarusian Civil Code afforded Manolium-E with the right to request compensation for the costs incurred in the construction.\n\n467.\n\nThe Presidential Order of 20 January 2017 gave the instruction that the Facilities be transferred \"without consideration into the ownership of Minsk [...].\"579 Manolium-E was thus deprived of its title over the Facilities and of its right to receive compensation for the construction work it had performed.\n\nPresidential Order (Doc. **R-242**), para. 1.\n\nClaimant\n--------\n\n468.\n\nThe taxation and enforcement measures did not stop with the Presidential Order.\n\n469.\n\nOn 8 February 2017, the Economic Court of Minsk ordered the commencement of the bankruptcy proceedings against Manolium-E and appointed an insolvency administrator.580 As a result of the bankruptcy proceedings, in March 2017 the Tax Inspectorate conducted a second, comprehensive tax audit of all of Manolium-E\u2019s tax liabilities starting from 2010.581 By 22 September 2017, Manolium-E\u2019s total indebtedness to the State amounted to BYN 20.9 M.582\n\nOfficial portal of the system of general jurisdiction courts of the Republic of Belarus, *Information on cases in connection with economic insolvency (bankruptcy) for the period from 1 February 2017 through 28 February 2017* (Doc. **C-179**).\n\nR II, para. 356.\n\nR II, para. 362; Amendments of 18 May 2017 to the Unscheduled field audit report of Manolium-E No. 543 dated 24 March 2017 (Doc. **C-186**).\n\n470.\n\nThe result of the continuing taxation and enforcement measures against Manolium-E was that the company, after the termination of the Investment Contract and the expropriation of the Facilities, was still held to owe BYN 20.9 M to the Republic for outstanding tax liabilities.\n\n471.\n\nIn that situation, the value of Claimant\u2019s shareholding in Manolium-E had been reduced to nil.\n\n**f. Abuse of tax law**\n-----------------------\n\n472.\n\nThe evidence marshalled proves, beyond reasonable doubt, that the Belarusian authorities adopted the taxation and enforcement measures with the aim of avoiding payment of the outstanding debt to Manolium-E, and securing transfer of the Facilities into municipal ownership without paying compensation.\n\n473.\n\nThere is documentary evidence showing this abuse of tax law:\n\n474.\n\nThe first piece of evidence is the letter of the Minsk Municipality to Manolium-E of 4 September 2015;583 in this document the Municipality brings up the proposal that Manolium-E should waive the right to be compensated for the costs incurred and accept that the Facilities be gratuitously transferred into municipal ownership.\n\nLetter from MCEC to Manolium-E of 4 September 2015 (Doc. **C-158**).\n\n475.\n\nClaimant was shocked by the Minsk Municipality\u2019s proposal, and wrote directly to the President of the Republic of Belarus, complaining about the \"lawlessness\" of the Municipality\u2019s action.584\n\nLetter from Manolium-E to the President of the Republic of Belarus of 12 November 2015 (Doc. **R-127**).\n\n476.\n\nThe second piece of evidence is an extensive letter from the Minsk Municipality to the Council of Ministers of the Republic of Belarus, to which a draft report for the President was attached.585 The letter was issued upon receipt of the MoF Report, which had valued the compensation owed to Manolium-E at USD 19.4 M. The letter established in clear terms that the Minsk Municipality was unwilling to pay the compensation to Manolium-E, and proposed an alternative plan: to levy a Land Tax of USD 19.6 M against Manolium-E for the unauthorized use of the Facilities Land Plots, and then to invite Claimant and Manolium-E to accept the transfer for free of the Facilities into municipal ownership. Should the investor disagree, the Minsk Municipality proposed that the tax debt should be enforced through the foreclosure on the Facilities.\n\nLetter from MCEC to the Council of Ministers of the Republic of Belarus of 29 February 2016 (Doc. **R-140**).\n\n477.\n\nThe alternative plan is not disguised through the use of embellishing terms. The letter of the Minsk Municipality is blunt, leaving no doubt about its true intentions:586\n\n\"In view of the foregoing, we consider it expedient to propose that the investor transfers the communal facilities into municipal ownership of Minsk free of charge, which would release it from any additional expenses, including those for vacating the land plot.\n\nShould the investor disagree with the set-out proposal (fail to sign an agreement on transfer of the property on the terms and conditions specified within one month) MCEC will:\n\n- order the investor to pay the amount of tax for the unauthorised occupation of the land plot, and where the latter fails to comply with the said demands, refer the materials to the court to hold the investor administratively liable for the unauthorised occupation of the land plot under Article 23.41 of the Code of Administrative Offences and to subsequently enforce the collection of land tax and other payments to the budget;\n\n- take measures to take out the incomplete facilities (trolleybus depot, pull station and sector of the road) from [Manolium-E] to the state revenue by enforcement (in the procedure for enforcing outstanding liabilities of the investor against the property).\" [Emphasis added]\n\nLetter from MCEC to the Council of Ministers of the Republic of Belarus of 29 February 2016 (Doc. **R-140**).\n\n478.\n\nThe plan was discussed in a meeting held on the date of issuance of this letter between representatives of the Minsk Municipality, the MoF and other agencies, and was then carried out in the manner anticipated. The Land Tax for the unauthorized use of the Facilities Land Plots was levied, Manolium-E failed to pay, and the ensuing tax obligation was enforced through the courts and resulted in a Presidential Order, dated 20 January 20 1 7,587 which gave instructions for the transfer of the Facilities into municipal ownership without consideration.\n\nPresidential Order (Doc. **R-242**).\n\n**g. Arbitrariness**\n--------------------\n\n479.\n\nThe conclusion that Respondent acted in abuse of tax law is reinforced by the fact that the Minsk Municipality\u2019s stance vis-\u00e0-vis Manolium-E can only be labelled as arbitrary: Manolium-E repeatedly tried to return the Facilities to the Municipality, which dismissed the proposal and thus provoked the accrual of the Land Tax.\n\nProven facts\n------------\n\n480.\n\nFirst, Manolium-E was perfectly aware that, upon expiration of its Land Permits and the standstill of any further construction activity, it had to devolve possession of the Facilities Land Plots to the Minsk Municipality.\n\n481.\n\nAs a first step, Manolium-E permitted Minsktrans to enjoy *de facto* possession of part of the Facilities gratuitously:\n\n- the Pull Station from mid-2010;588 and\n\n- the administrative block and the checkpoint of the Depot from November 2011 (until the end of 2014).589\n\nAgreement on Temporary Gratuitous Use of Property between Minsktrans and Manolium-E of 6 July 2010 (Doc. **C-99**).\n\nAgreement on Gratuitous Use of Property between Manolium-E and Minsktrans of 14 November 2011 (Doc. **C-82**); Agreement of 30 December 2014 on termination of Agreement for the gratuitous use of property dated 14 November 2011(Doc. **C-84**).\n\n482.\n\nBut this was not sufficient from a legal point of view. Under Belarusian law, upon expiration of a Land Permit, the constructor must return the land to the public owner, with the public owner accepting the return. Otherwise, the constructor becomes an unauthorized user of public lands.590 Manolium-E was obliged to return possession of the Facilities Land Plots, and the Minsk Municipality to accept such transfer.\n\nLand Code of the Republic of Belarus of 23 July 2008, No. 425-3 (edition in force between 13 January 2011 and 25 April 2013) (Doc. **CL-152**), Art. 70.\n\n483.\n\nOn 11 June 2012, Manolium-E sent a first letter to the Minsk Municipality in which it purported to return the land on which the Facilities had been constructed.591 But a few days later, on 17 July 2012, the Municipality rejected the return of the Facilities Land Plots. The reason given was that an uncompleted facility - the Depot - was located on that land.592 The Minsk Municipality added that the return of the Facilities Land Plots could be considered when the Investment Contract was terminated.593\n\nLetter from Manolium-E to MCEC of 11 June 2012 (Doc. **C-336**).\n\nLetter from Minsk Land Planning Service to Manolium-E of 17 July 2012 (Doc. **C-337**).\n\nLetter from Minsk Land Planning Service to Manolium-E of 17 July 2012 (Doc. **C-337**), para. 3.\n\n484.\n\nSecond, in the meantime the Minsk Municipality had initiated the First Administrative Proceeding, and on 23 July 2012 the Pervomaysky Court in Minsk issued its decision, finding for Manolium-E and establishing that Manolium-E was not liable for failing to meet the deadline to return the Facilities Land Plots.594 The Court found that Manolium-E had taken measures to return the Facilities Land Plots and had used its best efforts to resolve the situation, yet under the circumstances it had no chance to discharge its duty.595\n\nPervomaysky Decision (Doc. **C-346**).\n\nPervomaysky Decision (Doc **C-346**), p. 2.\n\n485.\n\nThird, Manolium-E repeated its willingness to transfer ownership of the Facilities to the Minsk Municipality on many occasions,596 but the city of Minsk never agreed thereto, even after termination of the Investment Contract in 2014.\n\nLetter from Claimant to MCEC of 4 March 2013 (Doc. **C-136**); Letter from Claimant to MCEC of 19 March 2013 (Doc. **C-83**); Letter from Manolium-E to MCEC of 3 April 2013 (Doc. **R-106**); Letter from Claimant to MCEC of 27 May 2013 (Doc. **C-93**); Letter from Claimant to MCEC of 27 June 2013 (Doc. **C-94**); Letter from Claimant to MCEC of 18 July 2014; Minutes of General Participants Meeting of 12 June 2013 (Doc. **C-342**).\n\n486.\n\nFourth, the behavior of the Minsk Municipality provoked tax consequences: as of 1 January 2013, Manolium-E became the subject of Land Tax accrued with regard to the Facilities Land Plots. And, if Manolium-E was held to be an unauthorized user of these Land Plots, the Land Tax would be calculated at an exorbitant rate: multiplying the ordinary rate by 10 or by 20.\n\n487.\n\nOn 21 February 2014, Manolium-E received two notices from the Tax Inspectorate requesting that it submit Land Tax calculations for the years 2013 and 2014 and pay the outstanding amounts.597 Relying on the Pervomaysky Decision, Manolium-E refused to do so.598\n\nDemand of an officer of the Tax Inspectorate to Manolium-E for 2013 of 21 February 2014 (Doc. **R-111**); Demand of an officer of the Tax Inspectorate to Manolium-E for 2014 of 21 February 2014 (Doc. **R-112**).\n\nDolgov II (**CWS-2**), para. 6; C PHB, para. 34.\n\n488.\n\nFinally, four years after its initial rejection, on 1 December 2016, when issuance of the Presidential Order was imminent, the Minsk Municipality finally changed its mind: it issued a formal decision withdrawing the Facilities Land Plots from Manolium-E.599 The decision is a two-page document, which does not provide any reasoning.\n\nDecision of MCEC No. 3539 of 1 December 2016 (Doc. **C-173**).\n\nDiscussion\n----------\n\n489.\n\nProfessor Schreuer has defined (and the Tribunal in *EDF* has accepted) as \"arbitrary\":600\n\n\"a. a measure that inflicts damage on the investor without serving any apparent legitimate purpose;\n\nb. a measure that is not based on legal standards but on discretion, prejudice or personal preference;\n\nc. a measure taken for reasons that are different from those put forward by the decision maker;\n\nd. a measure taken in wilful disregard of due process and proper procedure.\"\n\n*EDF (Services) Limited v. Romania*, ICSID Case No. ARB/05/13, Award dated 8 October 2009 [\"***EDF***\"], para. 303; Professsor Schreuer acted as expert and his opinion was quoted and accepted by the tribunal.\n\n490.\n\nThe successive decisions of the Minsk Municipality to dismiss Manolium-E\u2019s requests for the return of the Facilities Land Plots must be considered arbitrary: these measures inflicted heavy damage on the investor (Manolium-E became subject to a confiscatory Land Tax, which in three years ballooned to a liability in excess of the value of the asset), without being justified by any reasonable argument nor serving any apparent legitimate purpose.\n\n491.\n\nBy the Commissioning Date in July 2011, a significant part of the Facilities had been finalized, and Manolium-E had already permitted Minsktrans to enjoy *de facto* free possession of the Pull Station, and of the administrative block and the checkpoint of the Depot. On the Commissioning Date, the Land Permits expired and no additional construction activity was carried out thereafter. This was the overall situation when Manolium-E first requested that the Minsk Municipality accept the return of the Facilities Land Plots.\n\n492.\n\nThe Minsk Municipality refused acceptance. In the Tribunal\u2019s opinion, no legitimate ground justifies the Municipality\u2019s stance.\n\n493.\n\nThe reason given by the Minsk Municipality to dismiss the requests varied from case to case (existence of an uncompleted Depot; terms of the Termination Decision; assets belonging to Manolium-E still being located on the Facilities Land Plots). None of these reasons is substantiated: when in 2016 the Minsk Municipality became interested in recuperating title over the Facilities Land Plots, so that the President could order transfer of the Facilities into municipal ownership, the Municipality adopted the withdrawal decision - notwithstanding the fact that the reasons which had justified earlier refusals where still prevalent.\n\n494.\n\nA counterfactual scenario further confirms the arbitrariness of the Minsk Municipality's behavior: if the Municipality had taken the 2016 decision in 2012, reacting positively to Manolium-E's first request, Manolium-E's right to use the Facilities Land Plots would have been terminated as of 2012, with the result that no Land Tax would have accrued (accrual started in 2013), and Manolium-E would have avoided the tax and administrative liabilities which eventually resulted in the gratuitous transfer of the Facilities to the Minsk Municipality.\n\n495.\n\nThe counterfactual scenario proves beyond any doubt the arbitrariness of the Minsk Municipality's behavior.\n\n**h. Respondent\u2019s counter-arguments**\n-------------------------------------\n\n496.\n\nRespondent submits various counter-arguments:\n\n497.\n\nFirst, Respondent argues that under Belarusian law Manolium-E was liable to pay Land Taxes for the Facilities Land Plots. Claimant and Manolium-E were fully aware that as long a Manolium-E continued to occupy the land plots on which the Facilities stood, Land Taxes would accrue.601\n\nR III, paras. 1126-1129.\n\n498.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees with Respondent that Manolium-E became liable to pay Land Taxes for the Facilities Land Plots. The Tribunal also accepts that Manolium-E and Claimant were aware of this situation, which was flagged by Manolium-E's chief accountant. The crucial point is, however, that the Land Taxes accrued only because between 2012 and 2016 the Minsk Municipality refused Manolium-E's repeated requests to accept the return of the Facilities Land Plots.\n\n499.\n\nSecond, Respondent alleges that the Minsk Municipality acted reasonably and proportionately when conducting the tax assessments because:\n\n- Manolium-E either failed to submit the necessary documents or failed to apply altogether to extend the necessary Land Permits to continue construction after the Commissioning Date;602\n\n- while the Investment Contract was in force, it was not possible for the Minsk Municipality to accept the Facilities in an incomplete state;603 and\n\n- once the termination of the Investment Contract came into force, the valuations of the Facilities were carried out against the agreed instructions, and did not represent the value of the Facilities or the amount that would need to be spent to finalize them.604\n\nR III, para. 1135.\n\nR III, para. 1137 (a).\n\nR III, para. 1137(b).\n\n500.\n\nThe Tribunal does not agree.\n\n501.\n\nBy the agreed Commissioning Date, Manolium-E\u2019s Land Permits had expired, but the construction of the Facilities was not finalized. Eventually the Investment Contract was terminated through a judicial decision, adopted at the request of Respondent. The Republic of Belarus cannot have it both ways: it cannot promote termination of the Investment Contract, and simultaneously reproach Manolium-E for not having requested new Land Permits so as to continue construction.\n\n502.\n\nRespondent tries to justify its refusal to accept return of the Facilities Land Plots based on two arguments:\n\n- the first argument is that, while the Investment Contract was in force, the Minsk Municipality could not accept the Facilities in an incomplete state; the reasoning does not convince: what the Minsk Municipality refused was the acceptance of the Facilities Land Plots, not of the buildings themselves; the Minsk Municipality could have accepted the Land Plots, with an express reservation of its rights under the Investment Contract; it chose not to so;\n\n- the second argument is that, upon termination of the Investment Contract, the valuations of the Facilities by the MoF and other agencies were improperly carried out; the argument is a *non sequitur:* the Minsk Municipality could have accepted the Facilities Land Plots, reserving its rights.\n\n503.\n\nThe proof of the pudding is in the eating: when in 2016 the Minsk Municipality became interested in withdrawing the Facilities Land Plots from Manolium-E, it adopted the requisite decision, although the Facilities were still uncompleted, and although the contested valuations had not been changed.\n\n504.\n\nThird, Respondent says that the tax authorities acted transparently in respect of Claimant and Manolium-E, setting out the legal basis for the tax assessments and providing Manolium-E with the opportunity to raise objections at every step.605 Even when the Economic Court of Minsk ordered the enforcement of the tax liability against the Facilities, Manolium-E chose not to appeal.606 Thus, Respondent contends that Claimant\u2019s failure to raise any material objections to the conduct of the tax authorities shows there was no abuse of tax law.607\n\nR III, para. 1140. Respondent's argument is further elaborated in note 516 *supra*.\n\nR III, para. 1141.\n\nR III, paras. 1142-1143.\n\n505.\n\nRespondent\u2019s argument is again a *non sequitur.* The Tribunal\u2019s decision that the taxation and enforcement measures were expropriatory is not based on the argument that Manolium-E was not properly informed, or that it was deprived of opportunities to raise objections. Rather, the Tribunal has found that the measures were expropriatory, because they were improperly used to deprive Manolium-E of the value of the Facilities and Claimant of the value of its shareholding.\n\n506.\n\nFinally, Respondent says that Manolium-E's tax liabilities were not imposed at the President's instruction:608 the President's instruction of 10 October 2016 and the Presidential Order of 20 January 2017 were issued as part of the procedure for enforcing Manolium-E's tax liabilities, and therefore only gave effect to the Attachment and Enforcement Orders.\n\nR III, paras. 1144-1148.\n\n507.\n\nThe proven facts show that it was the Minsk Municipality that prepared the plan to expropriate the Facilities, and that various other agencies and entities within the Belarusian State cooperated in the plan's implementation. The Presidential Order -issued in fulfilment of the Attachment Order and the Enforcement Order - gave instructions for the transfer, without consideration, of the Facilities into the ownership of Minsk to set off Manolium-E's tax liabilities - and thus culminated the expropriation.609\n\nPresidential Order (Doc. **R-242**).\n\n**C.** **Conclusion**\n---------------------\n\n508.\n\nIn summary, the Tribunal finds that the Republic of Belarus adopted taxation and enforcement measures against Manolium-E and Claimant with consequences equivalent to those of expropriation in breach of Art. 79 of the Protocol.\n\n509.\n\nThe taxation and enforcement measures resulted in an expropriation of two separate assets:\n\n- Manolium-E was deprived of the Facilities, which were transferred to the Minsk Municipality without compensation; and\n\n- Manolium-E was forced into bankruptcy, and Claimant lost the value of its shareholding, which was reduced to nil.\n\n510.\n\nThe conclusion that the Republic of Belarus committed an expropriation is confirmed by two additional findings:\n\n- the Minsk Municipality, aided and abetted by other organs of the Belarusian State, including the President of the Republic, committed an abuse of tax law: the purpose of the tax and enforcement measures adopted against Manolium-E was to achieve transfer of the Facilities for free, without paying the compensation to which Manolium-E was entitled; and\n\n- the tax and enforcement measures adopted by the Belarusian authorities against Manolium-E inflicted unnecessary damage on the investor, without serving any apparent legitimate purpose, and must therefore be considered as arbitrary.\n\n**1.2 F****air and** **E****quitable** **T****reatment**\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n511.\n\nArt. 68 of the Protocol creates an obligation for Member States to ensure fair and equitable treatment to protected investments:\n\n\"Each Member State shall ensure on its territory fair and equitable treatment to investments and investment-related activities by investors of other Member States\".\n\n512.\n\nClaimant seeks a declaration that the measures adopted by the Republic of Belarus, which form part of the Tax Dispute, not only resulted in the unlawful expropriation of Claimant\u2019s investments, but also in a violation of the FET standard guaranteed by the EEU Treaty. Claimant specifically argues that the Minsk Municipality\u2019s refusal to accept the return of the Facilities into municipal ownership, when offered by Manolium-E, was a breach of good faith, transparency and legitimate expectations and resulted in a breach of the FET standard.610\n\nC I, paras. 389, 415-418, 452-471; HT, Day 1, 108:3-8.\n\n513.\n\nClaimant\u2019s requested relief regarding the FET standard is merely declaratory. The alleged breach of the FET provision does not result in a separate claim for compensation.\n\n514.\n\nRespondent affirms that it always treated Claimant fairly and equitably and submits that the Minsk Municipality did not artificially create a situation in which Manolium-E was unable to avoid tax liability,611 and that the Presidential Order did not breach Respondent\u2019s obligation to act transparently.612\n\nR III, paras. 1130-1139, 1260.\n\nR III, paras. 1270-1278.\n\nDecision of the Tribunal\n------------------------\n\n515.\n\nThe Tribunal has already found that the Republic of Belarus adopted taxation and enforcement measures against Manolium-E and Claimant with consequences equivalent to those of expropriation in breach of Art. 79 of the Protocol. Under Art. 80, such violation of the Treaty results in an entitlement to \"prompt and adequate\" compensation, which \"shall correspond to the market value of investments\" plus interest. The Tribunal has also concluded that the Minsk Municipality committed an abuse of tax law, and that the tax and enforcement measures adopted by the Belarusian authorities were arbitrary.\n\n516.\n\nThe Parties agree that the FET standard requires good faith, non-discrimination, transparency, consistency, proportionality, and satisfaction of the investor\u2019s legitimate expectations.613 The Tribunal\u2019s findings that the Minsk Municipality committed an abuse of tax law, and that the tax and enforcement measures were arbitrary, are on their face incompatible with the FET standard. Consequently, the Tribunal will accept Claimant\u2019s request for declaratory relief, and declare that the Republic of Belarus violated the FET standard towards Claimant and its investments. This finding has no implication for the compensation to be awarded to Claimant.\n\nH2, III, slide 24.\n\n**2.** **T****he** **T****ermination** **D****ispute**\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n517.\n\nThe Tribunal has already found in section V.4 above\n\n- that it only has *ratione temporis* jurisdiction to adjudicate certain claims that form part of the Termination Dispute: alleged breaches of the Treaty (expropriation and FET standard, including denial of justice), with regard to measures which occurred after the Effective Date (*i.e.*, (i) the Cassation Decision and (ii) the auctioning in favour of a third party of the right to develop a project similar to the Mall); and\n\n- that it lacks jurisdiction to adjudicate all other alleged breaches of the Treaty forming part of the Termination Dispute which occurred before the Effective Date.\n\n518.\n\nIn this section, the Tribunal will analyze whether the two measures adopted by Respondent after the Effective Date (the Cassation Decision and the auctioning of the right to develop a project similar to the Mall) constitute a denial of justice (**2.2**), a breach of FET (**2.3**) or an expropriation (**2.4**). Before that, the Tribunal will establish the proven facts (**2.1**).\n\n**2.1 P****roven facts**\n------------------------\n\n519.\n\nOn 12 November 2013, the Minsk Municipality and Minsktrans filed a claim before the Economic Court of Minsk, requesting that the Court declare the termination of the Investment Contract.614\n\nStatement of claim to terminate the Investment Contract of 14 October 2013, filed with the Economic Court of Minsk on 12 November 2013 (Doc. **C-140/R-201**).\n\n520.\n\nOn 9 September 2014, the Court declared that Claimant and Manolium-E had breached the time limits to implement the Investment Project, and that the delays were unreasonable and unrelated to the actions of the Minsk Municipality, Minsktrans or third parties,615 and rendered a judgement terminating the Investment Contract (Termination Decision).616\n\nTermination Decision (Doc. **C-147**), p. 5.\n\nTermination Decision (Doc. **C-147**).\n\n521.\n\nUpon appeal by Claimant and Manolium-E, the Termination Decision was confirmed by the Appellate Court on 29 October 2014,617 which found that\n\n\"the conclusions reached by the court of first instance are consistent with the circumstances of the case, rules of the substantive and procedural law, have been applied correctly and the court has appraised all the parties\u2019 arguments in full. Hence, there are no grounds for upholding the appeal.\"\n\nAppellate Court Decision (Docs. **C-150** and **TT-6**).\n\n522.\n\nThe Appellate Court Decision became effective on the date of issuance, pursuant to its own terms and as provided for in Art. 204 of the Belarusian Code of Civil Procedure.618\n\nCode of Commercial Procedure of the Republic of Belarus of 15 December 1998 No. 219-Z (Doc. **RL-50**). Article 204 is reproduced in note 187 *supra*. *See also* Belarusian Civil Code (Doc. **RL-127**), Art. 423.3.\n\n523.\n\nClaimant and Manolium-E filed an appeal under the cassation procedure on 29 November 2014.619 On 27 January 2015, the Belarusian Supreme Court rendered a Cassation Decision dismissing the appeal:620\n\n\"In such circumstances, the Panel for Economic Cases of the Supreme Court of the Republic of Belarus considers the court\u2019s conclusions that there are grounds for the termination of the contract to be lawful and justified.\n\nThe economic court of first instance and the court of appeals did not allow any violations of the rules of material and/or procedural law that would entail the annulment of the court decisions.\"\n\nCassation appeal of Manolium-E of 29 November 2014 (Doc. **C-151**).\n\nCassation Decision (Doc. **C-152**).\n\n524.\n\nMore than two years thereafter, on 12 September 2017, the Minsk Municipality held a public auction for the right to lease the Mall Land Plot, and to develop a new real estate project on that site.621 As a result of the auction, the Municipality awarded the project to OOO Astomaks, against payment of USD 8.87 M.622\n\nAnnouncement of the public auction (under conditions) No. 09-U-17 for the right for design and construction of capital structures of 12 September 2017 (Doc. **R-152**); Minutes of the Results of Public Auction No. 09-U-17 with Conditions for the Right for Design and Construction of Permanent Structures (Buildings, Constructions) of 12 September 2017 (Doc. **R-153**).\n\nMinutes of the Results of Public Auction No. 09-U-17 with Conditions for the Right for Design and Construction of Permanent Structures (Buildings, Constructions) of 12 September 2017 (Doc. **R-153**).\n\n**2.2 D****enial of justice**\n-----------------------------\n\n525.\n\nThe first claim submitted by Claimant is that the Cassation Decision amounts to a denial of justice.\n\n**A.** **Position of the Parties**\n----------------------------------\n\n**a. Claimant\u2019s position**\n--------------------------\n\n526.\n\nClaimant contends in its Statement of Reply that it suffered a denial of justice,623 because the whole system of the Belarusian courts failed to treat Claimant in accordance with international judicial standards:\n\n- the Belarusian judicial system does not comply with international standards of justice; and\n\n- the Supreme Court denied Claimant justice and failed to remedy the wrongs of the lower courts.\n\nC III, paras. 698-708, 723-734.\n\n527.\n\nFirst, Claimant says that the judicial system of the Republic of Belarus falls manifestly short of being impartial and independent, and in support of this averment submits an expert report prepared by Mrs. Elena Tonkacheva, the head of the Board of the Legal Transformation Center.624 Claimant also submits various reports on the Belarusian judicial system, issued by the Heritage Foundation, the Fraser Institute, Freedom House, the World Bank and the UN Human Rights Committee.625 In Claimant\u2019s opinion, the President has almost unlimited powers in the appointment of judges, and while the independence of courts is formally guaranteed by law, in practice courts are dependent on the executive bodies.626 Claimant adds that the overall dependence of the courts from the executive branch played a huge role in the violation of Claimant\u2019s rights.627\n\nExpert report of Elena Tonkacheva of 25 February 2019 (**CER-2**) [\"**Tonkacheva**\"].\n\nThe Heritage Foundation, 2017 Index of Economic Freedom, available at: (Doc. **ET-14**); The Heritage Foundation, 2019 Database of the Economic Freedom Index, available at: https://www.heritage.org/index/explore?view=by-regioncountry-year (Doc. **ET-15**); The Heritage Foundation, 2018 Index of Economic Freedom, available at: https://www.heritage.org/index/pdf/2018/book/index\\_2018.pdf (Doc. **ET-16**); Fraser Institute, Economic Freedom of the World, 2018 Annual Report, available at: https://www.fraserinstitute.org/sites/default/files/economic-freedom-of-the-world-2018.pdf (Doc. **ET-17**); Freedom House, Nations in Transit Methodology of 2018, available at: METHODOLOGY.pdf (Doc. **ET-20**); Freedom House, Nations in Transit 2017, Belarus Country Profile, available at: https://freedomhouse.org/country/belarus/nations-transit/2017 (Doc. **ET-21**); Freedom House, Nations in Transit 2012, Belarus (Doc. **ET-22**); Freedom House, Nations in Transit 2018, Belarus Country Profile, available at: https://freedomhouse.org/country/belarus/nations-transit/2018 (Doc. **ET-23**); World Bank website, Rule of Law, available at: http://info.worldbank.org/governance/wgi/#reports (Doc. **ET-18**); World Bank website, Control of corruption, available at: wgi/Home/Documents (Doc. **ET-19**); UN Human Rights Committee, General Comment No. 32.

The courts ignored certain facts, such as, *inter alia,*\n\n- the funding provided by Claimant;\n\n- Claimant\u2019s readiness to invest an additional USD 3 M to finish the Facilities; and\n\n- the Minsk Municipality\u2019s responsibility for the increase of costs and for the delay.628\n\nC III, paras. 728-731.\n\n529.\n\nThird, when the Supreme Court upheld the termination of the Investment Contract, the issue had been ruled upon long before, when the President of the Republic of Belarus took the decision to deprive Claimant of the project and award it to another company.629\n\nC III, paras. 732 and 733.\n\n**b. Respondent\u2019s position**\n----------------------------\n\n530.\n\nRespondent says that a denial of justice claim must rest on the specific treatment of the investor by the courts of the host State, rather than on an assessment of the courts in general,630 and that Claimant falls manifestly short of demonstrating denial of justice on the facts of the case given that631\n\n- there was no procedural irregularity or breach of due process in the judicial proceedings for the termination of the Investment Contract;632\n\n- the outcome of the termination proceedings was correct as a matter of Belarusian law;633\n\n- the outcome of the termination proceedings was proportionate;634\n\n- the outcome of the termination proceedings was not pre-ordained;635\n\n- Claimant and Manolium-E did not exhaust all local remedies in the termination proceedings;636 and\n\n- the Minsk Municipality cannot be faulted for acting in a manner validated by the Belarusian courts in the termination proceedings.637\n\nR III, para. 963.\n\nR III, para. 973\n\nR III, para. 977.\n\nR III, paras. 985-991.\n\nR III, para. 992.\n\nR III, para. 997.\n\nR III, paras.1003-1008.\n\nR III, paras.1009-1012.\n\n**B.** **Decision of the Tribunal**\n-----------------------------------\n\n531.\n\nClaimant submits that the Cassation Decision upholding the termination of the Investment Contract constitutes a denial of justice which violates the FET standard guaranteed in Art. 68 of the Protocol - a claim which is vigorously contested by Respondent.638\n\nC III, para. 723; R II, paras. 487 *et seq*.\n\n532.\n\nTo reach a decision, the Tribunal will, first, analyze the applicable law and the requirements for the existence of a denial of justice (**a.**) and then discuss whether in the present case such requirements are met (**b.**).\n\n**a. Applicable law and requirements**\n--------------------------------------\n\n533.\n\nArt. 68 of the Protocol provides that the Republic of Belarus must \"ensure on its territory fair and equitable treatment\" to protected investments. A State can breach the FET standard by measures adopted by any of its powers:\n\n- the legislative power can approve laws of general application, which result in improper treatment of aliens;\n\n- the executive power can adopt discriminatory or arbitrary administrative acts, directed against protected investors; and\n\n- the judicial power can violate the standard by making judgements which result in a denial of justice.\n\n534.\n\nDenial of justice thus constitutes a violation of the FET standard. Tribunals have unanimously held that the FET standard subsumes the prohibition of denial of justice.639 The prohibition is anchored in customary international law640 - a body of law which the Parties have agreed the Tribunal must take into consideration to supplement the EEU Treaty.641\n\n*Jan de Nul N.V. and Dredging International N.V. v. Arab Republic of Egypt*, ICSID Case No. ARB/04/13, Award dated 6 November 2008 [\"***Jan de Nul***\"] (Doc. **RL-12**), para. 188; J*an Oostergetel and Theodora Laurentius v.

Republic of Chile*, ICSID Case No. ARB/98/2, Award dated 8 May 2008 [\"***Pey Casado***\"] (Doc. **CL-82**), para. 655.\n\nIn the words of Professor Paulsson: \"[\u2026] the duty to provide decent Justice to foreigners arises from customary international law. Indeed, it is one of the oldest principles.\" Paulsson, J., *Denial of Justice in International Law*, Cambridge University Press, 2005 (Doc. **CL-132**), p. 1.\n\nSee para. 51 *supra*.\n\n535.\n\nA different issue is whether the facts of the case fulfill the requirements to be considered as a denial of justice. For this to happen, it is common ground that the claimant must prove two requirements:\n\n- the first requirement is material, and implies that the judicial system of the host State has given the foreign investor a treatment that is clearly and manifestly illegal (i.); and\n\n- the second criterion requires the exhaustion of local remedies by the investor (ii.).\n\n(i) Clear and manifest illegality\n---------------------------------\n\n536.\n\nDomestic courts must impart justice to nationals and aliens, without impairing a minimum standard defined by international customary law. Judge Tanaka described the following clear examples of denial of justice in *Barcelona Traction:**642*\n\n\"Conspicuous examples would be: corruption, threats, unwarranted delay, flagrant abuse of judicial procedure, a judgement dictated by the executive or so manifestly unjust that no court which was both competent and honest could have given it\".\n\n*Barcelona Traction, Light and Power Company, Limited (Belgium v. Spain)* (Second Phase) I.C.J. Reports 1970, p. 3 [\"***Barcelona Traction***\"]), Judge Tanaka's Separate Opinion dated 5 February 1970, p. 159, concluding that the Spanish judicial system had not committed a denial of justice against the Canadian investors.\n\n537.\n\nThe most traditional form of denial of justice occurs when a State denies a foreigner access to domestic courts.643 Court decisions also amount to a denial of justice when, having obtained access to local courts, the alien is subject to unwarranted delay, or having obtained a favorable decision, is prevented from enforcing it in the host State.644\n\nPaparinskis, M., *The International Minimum Standard and Fair and Equitable Treatment*, 2013, p. 190.\n\nPaparinskis, M., *The International Minimum Standard and Fair and Equitable Treatment*, 2013, p. 192.\n\n538.\n\nA violation of the fundamental principles of due process, a \"disregard of due process, [...] which shocks, or at least surprises, a sense of judicial propriety\",645 will also entail a denial of justice. This category may be divided into three types of breaches:\n\n- violations of rights that affect the intrinsic fairness of the proceeding; *inter alia,* the right to be notified about the existence of a proceeding and its development,646 the right to be heard,647 or the right to marshal evidence;\n\n- clearly arbitrary decisions that lack motivation, have no justification or are contrary to all legal logic, and which exceed a mere judicial error;648 and\n\n- decisions rendered by tribunals that lack independence or impartiality, and whose decisions are impaired by external interferences.649\n\n*Case Concerning Elettronica Sicula S.p.A.

A judicial error does not give rise to a claim for denial of justice.650 Incorrect application of the law does not constitute denial of justice - otherwise aliens would be afforded a new opportunity to appeal, once all local remedies have been exhausted. Denial of justice requires a \"clear and malicious misapplication of the law\",651 a specific *mens rea,* the will to wrongfully apply the law against the alien,652 frequently evidenced by a willful disregard of due process.653\n\n*Robert Azinian, Kenneth Davitian, and Ellen Baca v.

Did the Supreme Court commit a denial of justice?**\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n542.\n\nClaimant alleges that the Cassation Decision constitutes a breach of good faith and a denial of justice. It makes three main arguments:\n\n- the courts in Belarus are not independent from the executive branch of the government (i);656\n\n- the Supreme Court failed to assess crucial issues (ii);657 and\n\n- the decision to terminate the Investment Contract had been preordained by the President of Belarus and the courts had no option but to create an appearance of legitimacy (iii).658\n\nC III, paras. 709 *et seq*.\n\nC III, para. 727.\n\nC III, paras. 732-734.\n\n(i) The lack of independence of the Belarusian judicial system\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n543.\n\nClaimant has marshalled the following evidence, in an effort to prove an erosion of the rule of law in Belarus, and in particular, a lack of independence of the Belarusian judicial system:\n\n544.\n\nFirst, Claimant filed the expert report of Mrs. Elena Tonkacheva, which provides a general assessment of the situation of the judicial system in Belarus.659 Mrs. Tonkacheva\u2019s report points out that the best source for assessing the independence of judges in Belarus660 is the report prepared by the UN Special Rapporteur on the results of a fact-finding mission conducted in June 2000,661 which concluded the following:662\n\n\"The Special Rapporteur acknowledges that Belarus is a country in transition and suffers heavily from economic deprivation and the after-effects of the Chernobyl accident. However, the pervasive manner in which executive power has been accumulated and concentrated in the President has turned the system of government from parliamentary democracy to one of authoritarian rule. As a result, the administration of justice, together with all its institutions, namely the judiciary, the prosecutorial service and the legal profession, are undermined and not perceived as separate and independent. The rule of law is therefore thwarted.\" [Emphasis added]\n\nTonkacheva (**CER-2**).\n\nTonkacheva (**CER-2**), para. 10.\n\nReport of the Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers, Dato' Param Cumaraswamy, submitted in accordance with resolution 2000/42 \u2013 Addendum report on the mission to Belarus (Doc. **ET-7**).\n\nReport of the Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers, Dato' Param Cumaraswamy, submitted in accordance with resolution 2000/42 \u2013 Addendum report on the mission to Belarus (Doc. **ET-7**), p. 2.\n\n545.\n\nThe report made the following comments with regard to the status of the judiciary:663\n\n\"Executive control over the judiciary and the manner in which repressive actions are taken against independent judges appear to have produced a sense of indifference among many judges for the importance of judicial independence in the system. [...]\n\nThe existence of an independent judiciary requires not only the enactment of legal provisions to that effect but full respect for the independence of the judiciary in practice. The Special Rapporteur is of the view that the creation of an overseeing interdepartmental commission to monitor cases, or direct interference in individual cases by government officials constitutes inappropriate and unwarranted interference in the judicial process. The Government must abolish this commission.\n\nThe judicial selection process should ensure that candidates are selected on the basis of objective criteria, and should be seen by the wider public to do so, otherwise the independence of the judiciary will be compromised. The Special Rapporteur considers that the placing of absolute discretion in the President to appoint and remove judges is not consistent with judicial independence. The executive may be involved in the formal appointment process, but not in the selection, promotion or disciplining of judges. [...]\n\nThe length of their tenure will play a decisive role in ensuring that judges are free to decide matters before them without any improper influences, inducements, pressures, threats or interference, direct or indirect, as too short a tenure will subject judges to pressures arising from the reappointment process. These pressures are amplified by placing the power of reappointment under the control of the executive, since the executive will frequently appear before the courts as a party or have an interest in the outcome of proceedings decided by the judges. The Special Rapporteur has previously concluded that a five-year tenure is too short to be consistent with judicial independence. Courts in other jurisdictions have expressed similar opinions.\n\nAs judges who are appointed on probation do not have the security of tenure that is so essential to ensure their independence, the system of appointing judges on probation and the award of permanent tenure should be under the exclusive control of an independent judicial council.\n\nThe substantial number of inexperienced judges compounds the problems associated with a short initial tenure. Many of the persons the Special Rapporteur met during the mission expressed concern that the significant numbers of inexperienced judges, their poor conditions of service and their dependence on the Government threatened the independence of the judiciary and exposed judges to pressure and opportunities for corruption.\" [Emphasis added]\n\nReport of the Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers, Dato' Param Cumaraswamy, submitted in accordance with resolution 2000/42 \u2013 Addendum report on the mission to Belarus (Doc. **ET-7**), pp. 4-5.\n\n546.\n\nSecond, the World Bank's Worldwide Governance Indicators considered Belarus's rule of law rating to be very poor, with a qualification of 22.6 over 100664 for the year 2015 (when the Cassation Decision was issued).\n\nWorld Bank website, Rule of Law, available at: http://info.worldbank.org/governance/wgi/#reports. Accessed by the Tribunal on 29 January 2021 (Doc. **ET-18**).\n\n547.\n\nThird, the Heritage Foundation in its Index of Economic Freedom for 2018 ranks Belarus as a \"mostly unfree\" economy.665 One of the reasons for this rating is that the index describes the rule of law in Belarus in the following terms:666\n\n\"The president constitutionally controls the entire government, the courts, and even the legislative process through presidential decrees that have greater legal force than ordinary legislation.\"\n\nThe Heritage Foundation, 2018 Index of Economic Freedom, available at: https://www.heritage.org/index/pdf/2018/book/index\\_2018.pdf (Doc. **ET-16**).\n\nThe Heritage Foundation, 2018 Index of Economic Freedom, Belarus, available at: https://www.heritage.org/index/pdf/2018/book/index\\_2018.pdf (Doc. **ET-16**), p. 99.\n\n548.\n\nFourth, the Fraser Institute in its Economic Freedom of the World annual report for Belarus issued in 2018 assessed the impartiality of Belarusian courts - a clear indicator of the rule of law - with 4.2 out of 10. The indicator of integrity of the legal system was also low (5.83/10).667\n\nFraser Institute, Economic Freedom of the World, 2018 Annual Report, available at: https://www.fraserinstitute.org/sites/default/files/economic-freedom-of-the-world-2018.pdf (Doc. **ET-17**).\n\n549.\n\nFifth, the index on judicial framework and independence of the American non-governmental organization Freedom House identified the following fundamental problems in the judicial system of Belarus for 2017:668\n\n- the independence of the Belarusian courts is formally guaranteed by the constitution and the law, but in practice courts are dependent on the executive bodies; and\n\n- the President and other executive bodies can exercise decisive influence on judicial appointments.\n\nFreedom House, Nations in Transit 2017, Belarus Country Profile, available at: https://freedomhouse.org/country/belarus/nations-transit/2017 (Doc. **ET-21**), p. 20.\n\n550.\n\nIn the updated 2020 version of this report, the answer to the question \"Is there an independent judiciary?\" was the following:669\n\n\"Courts are subservient to the president, who appoints Supreme Court justices with the approval of the rubber-stamp parliament.\"\n\nFreedom House website, Nations in Transit 2020 Report, Belarus, available at: https://freedomhouse.org/country/belarus/freedom-world/2020.\n\nDiscussion\n----------\n\n551.\n\nThe evidence marshalled by Claimant shows that the judicial system in Belarus has significant room for improvement, especially as regards the independence of judges from the executive branch and the control by the President of the appointment of judges.\n\n552.\n\nThat said, a claim for denial of justice must rest on the specific treatment given by the courts of the host State to the alien, rather than on the general assessment of the host State\u2019s judicial system. As pointed out by one scholar:670\n\n\"The allegation of denial of justice must be individual and on a case specific basis; systemic problems regarding the judicial system do not suffice to establish a breach.\"\n\nDemirkol, B., *Judicial Acts and Investment Treaty Arbitration*, 2018 (Doc. **RL-79**), p. 174.\n\n553.\n\nInvestment arbitration case law also confirms that it is not sufficient for a claimant to base its claims on general allegations regarding the judicial system of the host State, if it is unable to prove that it has suffered a denial of justice on the facts of the case. In *Jan Oostergetel,* the claimants sought to support a denial of justice claim by offering general reports of corruption in Slovak courts. The tribunal held that such general reports were not sufficient for a denial of justice claim to succeed:671\n\n\"296. [...] As regards a claim for a substantial denial of justice, mere suggestions of illegitimate conduct, general allegations of corruption and shortcomings of a judicial system do not constitute evidence of a treaty breach or a violation of international law.\n\n[...]\n\n303. While such general reports are to be taken very seriously as a matter of policy, they cannot substitute for evidence of a treaty breach in a specific instance. [...] Mere insinuations cannot meet the burden of proof which rests on the Claimants.\"\n\n*Jan Oostergetel* (Doc. **CL-21**), paras. 296 and 303.\n\n(ii) The Cassation Decision\n---------------------------\n\n554.\n\nThe Cassation Decision is a six-page document, approved by the Supreme Court of Belarus, which analyzes Manolium and Manolium-E\u2019s main claim: that the lower courts\u2019672\n\n\"conclusions on the existence of grounds for terminating the investment contract of 6 June 2003 were made without taking into account all the circumstances connected with the performance of the contract.\"\n\nDoc. **C-152**, p. 1.\n\n555.\n\nClaimant says that in the Cassation Decision the Supreme Court failed to assess crucial issues regarding the termination of the Investment Contract and thus committed a denial of justice.\n\n556.\n\nA careful review of the Cassation Decision does not support Claimant\u2019s allegation:\n\n557.\n\nFirst, Claimant and Manolium- E were granted full access to the domestic judicial system, and were able to plead their case up to the Supreme Court. The Cassation Decision declares that Manolium was duly notified of the time and place of the hearing, but that its representatives did not attend, and the Supreme Court was forced to review the case in Claimant\u2019s absence.673\n\nDoc. **C-152**, p. 2.\n\n558.\n\nSecond, Claimant is not alleging that the Supreme Court committed any due process violation. To the contrary: the Cassation Decision reviewed the handling of the case by the first instance court and by the court of appeals, and did not find violations of the rules of material and/or procedural law that would entail the annulment of their decisions.674\n\nDoc. **C-152,** p. 6.\n\n559.\n\nThird, Claimant is not alleging any unwarranted delays. The Cassation Decision was rendered in a period of less than three months.\n\n560.\n\nFinally, the content of the Cassation Decision, while simple, is still properly reasoned. In particular, the Supreme Court:\n\n- reviewed the record, finding that Manolium and Manolium-E had only partially fulfilled their obligations under the Investment Contract:675 the Pull Station was accepted by Minsktrans but operated at no more than 1% of the design capacity; the Depot was not accepted into municipal ownership because it was not completed and the Road was complete but had not been put in operation; facts which apparently were not denied by Manolium and Manolium-E;676 the Supreme Court also analyzed and responded to several of Claimant\u2019s and Manolium-E\u2019s arguments, dismissing them one by one;677\n\n- analyzed the evidence, referring to several documents in which the Minsk Municipality described Claimant\u2019s and Manolium-E\u2019s failure to fulfill their contractual obligations and to take remedial actions;678 and\n\n- applied the law: according to Art. 297 of the Economic Procedural Code of the Republic of Belarus, a cassation decision must be grounded on lack of substantiation for the judicial decision or on violation or improper application of the rules of material and/or procedural law;679 the Supreme Court concluded that the findings of the lower courts were correct \"based on the case record and the rules of current legislation.\"680\n\nDoc. **C-152**, p. 4.\n\nDoc. **C-152**, pp. 4-5.\n\nDoc. **C-152**, pp. 5-6.\n\nDoc. **C-152**, p. 4.\n\nDoc. **C-152**, p. 2.\n\nDoc. **C-152**, p. 3.\n\n(iii) The Cassation Decision was pre-ordained by the President\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n561.\n\nClaimant finally says that the Cassation Decision was pre-ordained by the President of Belarus, who had taken the decision to terminate the Investment Contract long before the courts issued their judgements.\n\n562.\n\nThe Tribunal acknowledges the gravity of Claimant\u2019s accusation: if it were true that the decision to terminate the Investment Contract was taken by the President of Belarus, and that the courts, when they issued their successive judgements terminating the Investment Contract, simply followed political instructions, such behavior would undoubtedly meet the stringent requirements of denial of justice.\n\n563.\n\nThe crux of the question is whether Claimant\u2019s allegation is supported by convincing evidence.\n\n564.\n\nIn international law, the general principle is *actori incumbit probatio:* the party who alleges a certain fact has the burden to prove it.681 The Tribunal sees no reason to deviate from this principle. Since Claimant is alleging that President Lukashenko ordained the result of the Cassation Decision, it is for Claimant to marshal the appropriate evidence.\n\n*Flughafen Z\u00fcrich A.G. and Gesti\u00f3n e Ingenier\u00eda IDC S.A. v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela*, ICSID Case No. ARB/10/19, Award dated 18 November 2014 [\"***Flughafen***\"], para. 136; *Metal-Tech Ltd. v. Republic of Uzbekistan*, ICSID Case No. ARB/10/3, Award dated 4 October 2013 [\"***Metal-Tech***\"], para. 237.\n\n565.\n\nClaimant has presented the following documents that it claims lead to the conclusion that the President pre-ordained the Cassation Decision:\n\n- Mr. Dolgov\u2019s fourth witness statement of 28 February 2019;682\n\n- a news report published on 4 August 2014 on the website TUT.BY, under the title \"Lukashenko Instructed to Revise the Investment Project on the Construction of Multifunctional Center of Squares of Horizon in Minsk\";683\n\n- a decision of the Minsk Municipality transferring certain property from Minsktrans to another public entity, Minskstroy, on 15 August 2014;684\n\n- a letter sent by the Minsk Municipality to Claimant dated 11 December 2014;685 and\n\n- a news article published on 10 March 2017 on the website TUT.BY, under the title: \"Depot on the Horizon or How the Authorities Are Planning to Use Two Dainty Land Plots in the Center of Minsk?\"686\n\nDolgov IV (**CWS-5**), paras. 152-163.\n\nDoc. C-363.\n\nDecision of MCEC No. 1957 of 15 August 2014 (Doc. **C-142**); Second witness statement of Nikolay Akhramenko of 30 May 2019 (**RWS-4**), para. 71.\n\nLetter from MCEC to Claimant of 11 December 2014 (Doc. **C-365**).\n\nDoc. C-364.\n\n566.\n\nIn his witness statement, Mr. Dolgov affirms that in the summer of 2014, President Lukashenko decided that the Mall Land Plot and a neighboring plot (which belonged to a company named Horizon) would be considered a single investment project;687 this implied, in Mr. Dolgov\u2019s opinion, that the investment project under the Investment Contract had to be terminated.688\n\nDolgov IV (**CWS-5**), paras. 153-154.\n\nDolgov IV (**CWS-5**), para. 155.\n\n567.\n\nIn the summer of 2014, the Minsk Municipality and Minsktrans had already started the termination proceedings against Claimant and Manolium-E, but the Termination Decision was rendered a few weeks later, on 9 September 2014. Mr. Dolgov says that the President\u2019s decision to dispose of the Mall Land Plot had been taken before the Investment Contract was terminated by the Belarusian courts.\n\n568.\n\nClaimant seeks to confirm Mr. Dolgov\u2019s account by pointing to the fact that on 15 August 2014 the Minsk Municipality transferred certain properties from Minsktrans to another State agency, Minskstroy.689 Claimant submits that the Mall Land Plot was among these properties,690 while Respondent explains that what was transferred were certain buildings, but not the Land Plot itself.691 Be that as it may, even if the Mall Land Plot was transferred, Claimant\u2019s argument is difficult to follow. The transfer of certain real estate from one public entity to another does not seem to have a direct cause-effect relationship with the termination of the Investment Contract; if the investment project had gone forward, because the courts had rejected the claim for termination, it would have been Minskstroy (instead of Minsktrans) which would have leased the Mall Land Plot to Claimant.\n\nDecision of MCEC of 15 August 2014 (Doc. **C-142**).\n\nC I, para. 258.\n\nR II, para.205; R III, paras. 396-397.\n\n569.\n\nClaimant also tries to support Mr. Dolgov\u2019s statement with a contemporary news article, published on 4 August 2014 on the website TUT.BY, which described the President\u2019s plans to improve the investment project on the Horizon land plot. According to the news site, the President\u2019s plans were confirmed by several members of the executive branch, including the chairman of the Minsk Municipality, Mr. Ladutko, who is quoted as saying that the Mall Land Plot was also under consideration:692\n\n\"We are considering this territory [the Mall Land Plot] together with improvement of the Horizon territory. It will be a single investment project.\"\n\nWebsite of news portal TUT.BY, *Lukashenko Instructed to Revise the Investment Project on the Construction of Multifunctional Center of Squares of Horizon in Minsk* of 4 August 2014 (Doc. **C-363**).\n\n570.\n\nMr. Ladutko\u2019s statement is confirmed in a letter sent by the Minsk Municipality to Claimant on 11 December 2014693 (after the Termination Decision and the Appellate Court Decision, but pending the Cassation Decision), which admits that the President had issued instructions affecting the Mall Land Plot:\n\n\"The right to implement the investment construction project for the shopping, cultural and recreation center within streets Kiseleva-Krasnaya-Nezavisimosti-Masherova in Minsk was granted to the investor under clause 1 of the contract dated 6 June 2003. [...]\n\nHowever, the investor did not perform its contractual obligations, as result of which the contract was terminated by a court decision.\n\nIn addition, the Head of the State issued an instruction to develop the land plot located within streets Kiseleva-Krasnaya-Nezavisimosti-Masherova in Minsk using resources of the [Minsk Municipality] and at its expense.\n\nIn this regard, a concept of development of the territory within these boundaries has been worked out, which will be taken into account during the preparation of the detailed urban planning design.\" [Emphasis added]\n\nLetter from MCEC to Claimant of 11 December 2014 (Doc. **C-365**).\n\n571.\n\nThe evidence clearly suggests that in the second half of 2014, at around the time when the Belarusian courts issued the Termination Decision and the Appellate Court Decision, the President ordered that the neighboring plot belonging to Horizon should be incorporated and jointly developed. But such change does not prove that the President pre-ordained the outcome of the Cassation Decision.\n\n572.\n\nIndeed, the other news article submitted by Claimant, published in 2017, explains that a draft decision to combine the two projects had been prepared in 2015, but that it did not crystalize. The news site literally says:694\n\n\"According to our sources, the corresponding draft combining document was prepared as long ago as 2015 but all this time 'it has been going from office to office and the state bodies could not agree on a single vision for implementation of this project'.\"\n\nWebsite of news portal TUT.BY, *\"Depot on the Horizon\" or How the Authorities Are Planning to Use Two Dainty Land Plots in the Center of Minsk?* of 10 March 2017 (Doc. **C-364**).\n\n573.\n\nSumming up, the evidence marshalled by Claimant does not conclusively prove that, before the Investment Contract was terminated, Respondent actually decided to amalgamate the Mall Land Plot with the Horizon land plot. But even if it is accepted *arguendo* that this is what actually happened, the proven facts would still not prove that the Cassation Decision was pre-ordained by President Lukashenko.\n\n\\* \\* \\*\n\n574.\n\nIn conclusion, Claimant has been unable to prove that the Cassation Decision adopted by the Supreme Court amounted to a denial of justice.\n\n**2.3 F****air and equitable treatment**\n----------------------------------------\n\n575.\n\nIn September 2017, the Minsk Municipality organized a public auction and awarded a lease to the Mall Land Plot and the right to design and construct a similar project to a different developer, against payment of USD 8.8 M.695\n\nMinutes of the Results of Public Auction No. 09-U-17 with Conditions for the Right for Design and Construction of Permanent Structures (Buildings, Constructions) of 12 September 2017 (Doc. **R-153**).\n\n**A.** **Positions of the Parties**\n-----------------------------------\n\n576.\n\nClaimant says that all of Respondent\u2019s actions constitute one interlinked chain of breaches aimed at depriving Claimant of the benefits provided by the Investment Contract. These events included numerous breaches committed after 1 January 2015, including the September 2017 decision to transfer the Mall Land Plot to another investor, OOO Astomaks.696 Claimant argues that it suffered a FET violation, because the Minsk Municipality failed to perform its obligation to act in good faith, when it sold the Mall Land Plot to OOO Astomaks without notifying Claimant or offering Claimant the option to acquire the plot.697\n\nC III, para. 613\n\nC I, paras. 500-503; C PHB, para. 7.\n\n577.\n\nRespondent acknowledges that OOO Astomaks acquired in a public auction the right to develop the Mall Land Plot for USD 8.87 M.698 Respondent explains that Claimant lost its right to develop the Mall when the Investment Contract was terminated in 2014. Once the parties\u2019 rights and obligations under the Contract were extinguished, the Minsk Municipality was free to dispose of the Mall Land Plot as it pleased.699\n\nR II, para. 612.\n\nR II, para. 613.\n\n**B.** **Decision of the Tribunal**\n-----------------------------------\n\n578.\n\nThe Tribunal must determine whether by publicly auctioning the right to develop the Mall Land Plot, Respondent violated the FET standard. The Tribunal will briefly summarize the facts (**a.**) and then discuss its decision (**b.**).\n\n**a. Facts**\n------------\n\n579.\n\nOn 9 September 2014, the Economic Court of Minsk rendered a judgement terminating the Investment Contract.700 The ruling was confirmed by the Appellate Court on 29 October 2014701 and by the Supreme Court of Belarus on 27 January 2015.702\n\nTermination Decision (Doc. **C-147**).\n\nAppellate Court Decision (Docs. **C-150** and **TT-6**).\n\nCassation Decision (Doc. **C-152**).\n\n580.\n\nOn 12 September 2017, the Minsk Municipality held a public auction for the right to design and construct permanent structures on the Mall Land Plot.703 The Municipality awarded the right to design and construct a similar project on the same Land Plot to OOO Astomaks, against payment of USD 8.87 M.704\n\nAnnouncement of the public auction (under conditions) No. 09-U-17 for the right for design and construction of capital structures of 12 September 2017 (Doc. **R-152**); Minutes of the Results of Public Auction No. 09-U-17 with Conditions for the Right for Design and Construction of Permanent Structures (Buildings, Constructions) of 12 September 2017 (Doc. **R-153**).\n\nMinutes of the Results of Public Auction No. 09-U-17 with Conditions for the Right for Design and Construction of Permanent Structures (Buildings, Constructions) of 12 September 2017 (Doc. **R-153**).\n\n**b. Discussion**\n-----------------\n\n581.\n\nThe Arbitral Tribunal agrees with Respondent.\n\n582.\n\nThe Termination Decision issued on 9 September 2014 terminated the Investment Contract.705 The necessary consequence is that as of such date Claimant\u2019s right to develop the Mall in exchange for the construction of the Facilities was permanently extinguished, and that Respondent was free to dispose of the Mall and the Mall Land Plot. This is what Respondent did three years after the Termination Decision.\n\nThe ruling was confirmed by the Appellate Court Decision issued on 29 October 2014, which came into effect on the date of the issuance, pursuant to its own terms (Appellate Court Decision (Docs. **C-150** and **TT-6**), p. 5) and Art. 204 of the Code of Commercial Procedure of the Republic of Belarus No. 219-Z of 15 December 1998 (Doc. **RL-50**). Art. 204 is reproduced in note 187 *s**upra*. *See also* Belarusian Civil Code (Doc. **RL-127**), Art. 423.3.\n\n583.\n\nClaimant says that it was not notified of the auction, and that it was not offered a right of first refusal. But the fact is that since 2014 Claimant\u2019s rights related to the Investment Contract had been terminated, and that Claimant has not indicated any alternative source affording such rights.\n\n584.\n\nIn summary, the Tribunal dismisses Claimant\u2019s FET claim relating to the sale in public auction of the right to design and develop the Mall Land Plot.\n\n**2.4 E****xpropriation**\n-------------------------\n\n585.\n\nClaimant alleges that the termination of the Investment Contract culminated Respondent\u2019s indirect expropriation.706\n\nC I, para. 513.\n\n586.\n\nThe Tribunal will briefly summarize the Parties\u2019 positions (**A.**) and then issue its decision (**B.**).\n\n**A.** **Positions of the Parties**\n-----------------------------------\n\n587.\n\nClaimant submits that the Termination Dispute only ripened after the Supreme Court of Belarus issued the Cassation Decision on 27 January 2015. Until that moment, according to Claimant, it had not been irreversibly deprived of its right to develop the Mall in accordance with the Investment Contract: Claimant says that \"only upon this ruling was the right permanently and irreversibly destroyed.\"707\n\nC III, para. 383.\n\n588.\n\nClaimant also alleges that by selling the right to develop a project on the Mall Land Plot in 2017, the Minsk Municipality destroyed any capacity Claimant may have had to reclaim its right to develop the Mall.708\n\nC III, para. 532(iv).\n\n589.\n\nRespondent argues that under Belarusian law the termination of the Investment Contract came into force on 29 October 2014, the date of issuance of the Appellate Court Decision.709 Thus, any alleged expropriation had already taken place when the Cassation Decision was issued and would fall outside the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction.\n\nR III, para. 388.\n\n**B.** **Decision of the Tribunal**\n-----------------------------------\n\n590.\n\nThe Tribunal has already decided that it lacks jurisdiction to adjudicate all alleged breaches of the Treaty related to the Termination Dispute which occurred before the Effective Date, and that for this reason the Termination Decision and the Appellate Court Decision fall outside the Tribunal\u2019s *ratione temporis* jurisdiction -the Tribunal is only entitled to review the Cassation Decision, which affirmed the decision of the Appellate Court Decision.\n\n591.\n\nThe question now before the Tribunal is whether the Cassation Decision, a judgement rendered by the Supreme Court of Belarus, constituted an indirect expropriation. Taking of property through a judicial process can indeed give rise to an expropriation, but the Tribunal710 considers that the standard must be equivalent to that applied to judicial decisions which violate the FET standard: judicial expropriation must result from denial of justice. This conclusion is confirmed by case law711 and by scholarly opinion:712\n\n\"[w]hile taking of property through the judicial process could be said to constitute expropriation, the rules and criteria to be applied for establishing the breach should come from denial of justice.\"\n\nThis finding is made by majority, Arbitrator Alexandrov dissenting.\n\n*Loewen*, para. 141: \"Claimant's reliance on Article 1110 adds nothing to the claim based on Article 1105. In the circumstances of this case, a claim alleging an appropriation in violation of Article 1110 can succeed only if Loewen established a denial of justice under 1105.\"\n\nPaparinskis, M., *The International Minimum Standard and Fair and Equitable Treatment*, 2013, p. 208.\n\n592.\n\nThe Tribunal has already decided that the Cassation Decision did not constitute a denial of justice, and this finding precludes the possibility that the Cassation Decision gives rise to a judicial expropriation.713\n\nThis conclusion is made by majority, Arbitrator Alexandrov dissenting.\n\n593.\n\nFuthermore, in this case, even if the Tribunal\u2019s views (as expressed by the majority) were mistaken, and judicial expropriation could be found independently of a denial of justice, the Cassation Decision merely affirmed the judgements of the lower courts. If any judgement would amount to an expropriation, it would be the Termination Decision, over which the Tribunal has already decided that it has no jurisdiction. An affirmation of that decision by a higher court, in and of itself and absent more, does not amount to an expropriation.\n\n594.\n\nIn summary, the Tribunal concludes that the Cassation Decision does not constitute an expropriation under the EEU Treaty.714\n\nThis decision is made unanimously.\n\n**VII.** **QUANTUM**\n--------------------\n\n595.\n\nOn the merits, the Tribunal has found that the Republic of Belarus adopted taxation and enforcement measures against Manolium-E and Claimant with consequences equivalent to those of expropriation, in breach of Art. 79 of the Protocol, which resulted in the taking of two separate assets:\n\n- Manolium-E was deprived of the Facilities, which were transferred to the Minsk Municipality without compensation; and\n\n- Claimant lost the value of its shareholding in Manolium-E, a company which was forced into bankruptcy and whose value was reduced to nil.\n\n596.\n\nThe Tribunal has dismissed Claimant\u2019s claim in respect of the termination of the Investment Contract.\n\n597.\n\nThe Tribunal must now address the issue of quantum.\n\n**1.** **T****he** **P****arties****\u2019** **positions**\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n**1.1** **C****laimant****\u2019****s position**\n-------------------------------------------\n\n598.\n\nClaimant requests compensation for the construction of the Facilities (**A.**) and for the non-development of the Mall (**B.**)\n\n**A.** **Compensation for the construction of the Facilities**\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n599.\n\nClaimant says that it constructed the Facilities, that these were transferred into the ownership of the Minsk Municipality and that no consideration has been paid. The only issue therefore is the value of the Facilities.715\n\nC PHB, para. 66.\n\n600.\n\nClaimant alleges that it incurred construction costs in an amount of USD 19,434,679. In support of this figure, Claimant submits a calculation by its expert, Mr. Taylor, which is based on three contemporaneous Belarusian audits (one by Paritet-Standart, another by the Minsk Cadaster Agency and the third by the MoF).716\n\nC PHB, paras. 68-80; First expert report of Travis A.P. Taylor, FCA MRICS of 24 April 2017 (**CER-1**) [\"**Taylor I**\"], paras. 6.2.1-6.2.4; Second expert report of Travis A.P. Taylor, FCA MRICS of 28 February 2019 (**CER-3**) [**Taylor II**\"], para. 5.4.4 (Table 21); Paritet-Standart Report of 5 November 2012 (Doc. **C-131**); Expert Report No. 3 of the Minsk Cadaster Agency of 16 June 2015 (Doc. **C-154**), p. 43; MoF Report (Doc. **C-160**).\n\n601.\n\nAdditionally, Claimant also invested a further USD 1 M as part of this project, as a payment to the Belarusian National Library. This amount was part of the consideration provided for in the Investment Contract and its return is necessary to avoid unjust enrichment.717\n\nC PHB, para. 81.\n\n602.\n\nIn total, under this first heading, Claimant is asking for USD 20,434,679.\n\n**B.** **Compensation for the non-development of the Mall**\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n603.\n\nClaimant says that it is also entitled to compensation for the non-development of the Mall. Using again the expert evidence of Mr. Taylor, Claimant avers that if the Investment Contract had been complied with, it would have been able to build the Mall at a cost of USD 243 M, sell the real estate at a market price of USD 399 M, and on the basis of these estimates, it requests a nominal lost profit of USD 155.924 M, or alternatively a discounted lost profit of USD 68.9 M, or under an alternative calculation, of USD 31.87 M.718\n\nC PHB, paras. 82 (Table 1) and 100(II)(c)(i)-(ii); Taylor II (**CER-3**), paras. 3.11.2-3.11.3 (Tables 17 and 18).\n\n604.\n\nFinally, Claimant submits that, as \"the absolute floor\", it should receive as compensation for the non-development of the Mall the value another investor was willing to pay in a public auction for the same development right, USD 8.87 M. The price an independent buyer was willing to pay in an arm\u2019s length transaction is the gold standard in determining fair market value.719\n\nC PHB, para. 87.\n\n**1.2 R****espondent****\u2019****s position**\n-----------------------------------------\n\n605.\n\nRespondent significantly reduces the value of the Facilities and denies Claimant\u2019s entitlement to any compensation for the non-development of the Mall.\n\n**A.** **Compensation for the construction of the Facilities**\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n606.\n\nRespondent\u2019s first argument is that the valuation carried out by the MoF is unreliable because:\n\n- it contradicted instructions from the Council of Ministers;\n\n- the sampling was minimal;\n\n- the methodology is unknown;\n\n- it includes Claimant\u2019s management fees, without further explanation; and\n\n- it has not been confirmed in these proceedings on the basis of primary documents.720\n\nR PHB, paras. 90-93.\n\n607.\n\nRespondent prefers the methodology of its own expert, Mr. Qureshi, who applies a methodology based not on actual costs, but on the 2005 and 2006 estimates, adjusted to take account of changes in market prices.721 This methodology results in a quantum of USD 15.9 M,722 to which the Tribunal should apply an appropriate reduction to take account of Claimant\u2019s contributory negligence.723\n\nR PHB, para. 93.\n\nR III, n. 2182; First expert report of Abdul Sirshar Qureshi (Respondent's expert) of 15 November 2018 (**RER-1**) [\"**Qureshi I**\"], para. 202.\n\nR III, para. 1402.\n\n608.\n\nAdditionally, Respondent says that the payment to the Belarusian National Library should be excluded from the valuation.724\n\nR PHB, para. 100.\n\nExchange rate\n-------------\n\n609.\n\nRespondent agrees that the compensation owed must be paid in \"freely convertible currency\" under Art. 81 of the Protocol, and does not dispute that damages should be paid in USD.\n\n610.\n\nThe MoF Report converted Manolium-E\u2019s costs from BYR into USD at the exchange rate on the final day of each calendar month on which the costs were incurred.725 This conversion, says Respondent, transfers the risk of currency devaluation during the course of the investment onto Respondent - contrary to the principle that currency risk is to be borne by the investor. Since the Facilities were transferred into municipal ownership on 27 January 2017, the costs incurred in BYR should be converted into USD at the exchange rate prevailing on that date.726\n\nR PHB, para. 98.\n\nR PHB, para. 99.\n\n**B.** **Compensation for the non-development of the Mall**\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n611.\n\nAs an initial argument, Respondent explains that Claimant cannot be entitled to simultaneously claim compensation for the construction of the Facilities and compensation for the non-development of the Mall. The *quid pro quo* for the right to develop the Mall was precisely Claimant\u2019s obligation to deliver the Facilities without compensation.727\n\nR II, paras. 674-676; R III, paras. 1303-1306.\n\n612.\n\nSecond, Respondent submits that Claimant is not entitled to any compensation for the non-development of the Mall because:\n\n- it lost interest in the development of an unprofitable project in the middle of an economic crisis;728\n\n- the lost profits are highly speculative, no detailed documentation, projections and assessments having been made, and construction not having begun;729\n\n- the project would not have been profitable;730 and\n\n- Claimant's calculations do not take into consideration the lease payments owed to the Minsk Municipality.731\n\nR III, paras. 1311-1322; R PHB, paras. 78-80.\n\nR PHB, paras. 81-84; R III, paras. 1323-1345.\n\nR III, paras. 1346-1368.\n\nR PHB, para. 85.\n\n613.\n\nThird, Respondent avers that Claimant is not entitled to a minimum compensation equal to the amount paid by OOO Astomaks for the awarding of the right to develop a new project on the land ear-marked for construction of the Mall, because its right to develop the land was on different terms and conditions.732\n\nR III, paras. 1382-1389; R PHB, para. 86.\n\n**2.** **D****ecision of the** **T****ribunal**\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n614.\n\nArts. 80 and 81 of the Protocol provide as follows:\n\n80. The compensation referred to in paragraph 79 of this Protocol shall correspond to the market value of investments expropriated from investors on the date immediately preceding the date of their actual expropriation or the date when it becomes known about the upcoming expropriation.\n\n81. The compensation referred to in paragraph 79 of this Protocol shall be paid without delay, within the period provided for by the legislation of the recipient state, but not later than within 3 months from the date of expropriation and shall be freely transferable abroad from the territory of the recipient state in a freely convertible currency. [...]\" [Emphasis added]\n\n615.\n\nThe Treaty only contains very few specific rules regarding damages: the expropriation must \"involve prompt and adequate compensation\", based on the \"market value of the investment\" on the \"date immediately preceding the date of their actual expropriation or the date when it becomes known\". The Treaty adds that the compensation shall be paid \"in a freely convertible currency\", that \"shall be freely transferable abroad\".\n\n616.\n\nAny assessment of compensation in a complex factual situation includes some degree of estimation - the same degree which is also applied by (private and government) actors in the real world when valuing enterprises. Because of this difficulty, tribunals retain a certain margin of appreciation. This should not be mistaken with acting *ex aequo et bono,* because the Tribunal's margin of appreciation can only be exercised in a reasoned manner and with full respect of the principles of international law for the calculation of compensation (and damages).733\n\n*Rusoro* (Doc. **RL-96**), para. 642.\n\n617.\n\nThe legal standard under the Protocol which the Tribunal must apply is not disputed by the Parties: it is the market value of the investments expropriated on the date immediately preceding the date of actual expropriation or the date when the upcoming expropriation becomes known.\n\n618.\n\nThe provision of the Protocol stating that adequate compensation shall be calculated as the fair market value is in line with the principle of full reparation of the injury caused, firmly established in jurisprudence since the seminal *Chorz\u00f3w Factory* decision734 of the Permanent Court of International Justice and subsequently codified in the ILC Articles.735\n\n*Case Concerning the Factory at Chorz\u00f3w (Germany v.

Mr. Taylor presented two extensive expert reports736 and a presentation used as the basis for his expert testimony during the hearing.737\n\nTaylor I (**CER-1**) and Taylor II (**CER-3**).\n\nPresentation of Travis A.P. Taylor at the hearing on 31 July 2019 [\"**H5**\"].\n\n620.\n\nRespondent also availed itself of an economic expert, Mr. Qureshi, who submitted two expert reports,738 and also used a presentation for his expert testimony during the hearing.739\n\nQureshi I (**RER-1**); Second expert report of Abdul Sirshar Qureshi of 27 May 2019 (**RER-2**) [\"**Qureshi II**\"].\n\nPresentation of Abdul Sirshar Qureshi at the hearing on 31 July 2019.\n\n621.\n\nThe Tribunal thanks the experts for the quality and independence of their advice.\n\n622.\n\nBased on the provisions of the Protocol explained *supra,* Claimant requests compensation for two items:\n\n- compensation for the construction of the Facilities amounting to USD 19,434,679, plus USD 1 M for the payment made to the National Library of Belarus, plus\n\n- compensation for the non-development of the Mall, of USD 155.9 M or any other amount the Tribunal finds justified.\n\n623.\n\nThe Tribunal will first address Claimant\u2019s claim for compensation for the construction of the Facilities (**2.1**.) and then for the non-development of the Mall (**2.2.**).\n\n**2.1** **C****ompensation for the construction of the** **F****acilities**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n624.\n\nClaimant\u2019s claim under this heading is straightforward: it requests that Respondent pay the construction costs of the Facilities, as incurred by Manolium-E (**A.**), plus the payment to the National Library of Belarus (**B.**).\n\n**A.** **Valuation of the construction costs incurred**\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n625.\n\nThe task of the Tribunal is to establish the fair market value of the Facilities. Both Parties agree that the proper methodology is to make the calculation by reference to Manolium-E's actual investments: the fair market value of the Facilities is equal to the costs actually incurred by Manolium-E in their construction.740\n\nC PHB, para. 64.\n\n626.\n\nThe Parties diverge when trying to quantify these costs. Claimant says that the right quantification is USD 19,434,679, while Respondent submits the better figure is either USD 11.2 M (the amount of costs actually incurred according to Mr. Qureshi741) or USD 15.9 M (the figure used by Respondent in its Rejoinder, which would include additional costs needed to complete the Facilities742).\n\nQureshi I, para. 232; Qureshi II, para. 27.\n\nQureshi I, para. 202 and note 276.\n\nMr. Taylor's position\n---------------------\n\n627.\n\nClaimant's expert, Mr. Taylor, on whose opinion Claimant relies, used three separate contemporaneous audits conducted under Belarusian audit law to determine the amount invested by Claimant in the construction of the Facilities:\n\n- the first audit was conducted by Paritet-Standart in November 2012 and valued the Facilities at USD 18.3 M;743\n\n- the second audit was conducted in June 2015 by the Minsk Cadaster Agency,744 and valued the Facilities at USD 18.1 M;745\n\n- finally, the third audit report was conducted in February 2016 by consultants from the MoF and other State agencies and valued the costs incurred in constructing the Facilities at USD 19,434,679.746\n\nParitet-Standart Report of 5 November 2012 (Doc. **C-131**).\n\nExpert Report No. 3 of the Minsk Cadaster Agency of 16 June 2015 (Doc. **C- 154**).\n\nExpert Report No. 3 of the Minsk Cadaster Agency of 16 June 2015 (Doc. **C-154**), p. 43.\n\nMoF Report (Doc. **C-160**), p. 15.\n\n628.\n\nMr. Taylor relies on the MoF Report, the last and most official of the three reports, and confirms that the cost of the Facilities amounted to the figure established in the MoF Report.\n\nMr. Qureshi's position\n----------------------\n\n629.\n\nMr. Qureshi rejects the MoF Report and calculates the value of the Facilities using different approaches, depending on whether the buildings were completed or not:\n\n- with respect to the Pull Station, Mr. Qureshi relies on costs specified in its act of acceptance dated 30 July 2010;747 and\n\n- for the Road and the Depot, Mr. Qureshi calculates the costs on the basis of 2005 and 2006 cost estimates, adjusted to take into account changes in market prices during the period of actual construction;748 Mr. Qureshi then excludes the components which were not constructed.749\n\nR PHB, para. 93; Qureshi I (**RER-1**), paras. 224(c) and 230.\n\nR PHB, para. 93; HT Day 3, 511:13-19.\n\nR PHB, para. 93; HT Day 3, 609:11-13; Qureshi II (**RER-2**), para. 190.\n\n630.\n\nThe Depot accounts for the bulk of the difference between the valuations of the experts, as shown in the following chart:750\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Communal Facilities US$ 000' | Taylor | Qureshi | Difference | Percent \u2206 |\n| Trolleybus Depot | 15,704 | 7,536 | 8,169 | 88% |\n| Library Payment | 1,000 | Not Included | 1,000 | 11% |\n| Road | 1,039 | 757 | 282 | 3% |\n| Pull Station | 2,692 | 2,869 | (177) | -2% |\n| **Total Loss** | **20,435** | **11,161** | **9,273** | **100%** |\n\nH5, slide 20.\n\n631.\n\nMr. Taylor applies the cost of the Depot as calculated in the MoF Report, while Mr. Qureshi uses 2005 and 2006 cost estimates adjusted to take into account the changes in market prices during the time of construction. Such cost estimates are made in 1991 prices. Since the Depot was incomplete, Mr. Qureshi relies on the findings of the Belcommunproject to ascertain which components of the Depot were not built and deducts the estimated expenses for such components.751\n\nR PHB, para. 93.\n\nThe Tribunal\u2019s views\n--------------------\n\n632.\n\nThe Tribunal finds the position of Claimant\u2019s expert more convincing:\n\n633.\n\nFirst, the MoF Report is the result of an audit conducted by Respondent, which was the only potential buyer for the Facilities. The MoF Report is a contemporaneous document prepared at the request of the Minsk Municipality752 pursuant to the instructions of the Council of Ministers and the MoF753 in order to determine the work performed, the current state of the Facilities, their compliance with the design specifications and their market value.754\n\nLetter from MCEC to the Council of Ministers of the Republic of Belarus of 30 December 2015 (Doc. **R-135**), pp. 2-3.\n\nInstruction of the MoF No. 8 of 3 February 2016 (Doc. **R-139**); Prescription issued by the MoF No. 8 of 2 February 2016 (Doc. **C-159**).\n\nLetter from MCEC to the Council of Ministers of the Republic of Belarus of 30 December 2015 (Doc. **R-135**), pp. 2-3. The list of audited issues included in the instruction was the following (Instruction of the MoF No. 8 of 3 February 2016 (Doc. **R-139**)):  \n- \"[a]nalysis of costs incurred by [Manolium-E] during the construction of the facilties, ownership of which is meant to be transferred to the city of Minsk\", entrusted to the MoF and the Ministry of Architecture;  \n- \"[c]heck measurements and other actions to establish data about the works performed. Compliance of the facilities constructed by Manolium-E with their functional use\" entrusted to the MoF and the Ministry of Architecture; and  \n- \"[a]nalysis of space-planning parameters, design characteristics and general utilities of the facilities that have been created in order to assess whether they conform with the design documentation\" entrusted to the Ministry of Architecture.\n\n634.\n\nThe audit was carried out over a period of 17 days and included the review of commercial and financial activities from April 2004 - the early stages of the Investment Contract - until January 2016.755 The audit was recorded in the book of audits and\n\n\"was conducted in accordance with the Regulations of Audit Organization and Conduct approved by Decree No. 510 of 16 October 2009 of the President of the Republic of Belarus [...].\"756\n\nMoF Report (Doc. **C-160**), p. 1.\n\nMoF Report (Doc. **C- 160**), p. 1.\n\n635.\n\nSecond, the MoF Report uses actual costs incurred, not estimates, and reflects design revisions, a fact recognized by Mr. Qureshi.757\n\nHT Day 3, 573:18-20; 595:16-20.\n\n636.\n\nThird, the MoF Report was based on a review and measurement of the physical structures758 and of documentation:759\n\n\"[The] audit included sample inspection of contracts, statements of works performed and associated expenses, certificates of acceptance of construction or other special works, design and as-built documentation, primary records, waybills and consignment notes, payment orders and any other documents or information carriers kept by [Manolium-E].\"760\n\nMoF Report (Doc. **C- 160**), p. 5.\n\nH5, slide 21.\n\nMoF Report, p. 1 (Doc. **C- 160**).\n\n637.\n\nFourth, the MoF Report was issued on 22 February 2016, only a few days before the Minsk Municipality outlined its plan to the Council of Ministers which ultimately resulted in the expropriation of the Facilities.\n\n638.\n\nFinally, the general finding of the MoF Report is corroborated by two other independent reports:\n\n- in a letter of 3 October 2012, the Minsk Municipality suggested that Manolium-E undertake an independent audit to determine the costs borne in relation to the Investment Contract.761 Paritet-Standard\u2019s audit report, dated 5 November 2012, confirmed costs associated with the \"design and construction of the communal facilities\" of USD 18,313,814.96 as of 31 October 2012:762 additional costs of USD 308,212.72 were identified as being incurred but not paid at the date of the audit;763 Paritet-Standart\u2019s report noted that there were certain costs incurred by Claimant which were not included in the valuation;764\n\n- in February 2015, in the context of the negotiations between Claimant and the Minsk Municipality for the acquisition of the Facilities, Manolium-E entered into another audit arrangement: this time the entity conducting the review was the Minsk Cadaster Agency,765 which rendered its report in June 20 1 5766 and confirmed that the costs borne by the investor in the construction of the Facilities amounted to USD 18.1 M.767\n\n\\* \\* \\*\n\nLetter from MCEC to Manolium-E of 3 October 2012 (Doc. **C-130**).\n\nParitet-Standart Report of 5 November 2012 (Doc. **C-131**), pp. 4-5.\n\nParitet-Standart Report of 5 November 2012 (Doc. **C-131**), p. 5.\n\nParitet-Standart Report of 5 November 2012 (Doc. **C-131**), p. 4.\n\nExpert Report No. 3 of the Minsk Cadaster Agency of 16 June 2015 (Doc. **C- 154**).\n\nExpert Report No. 3 of the Minsk Cadaster Agency of 16 June 2015 (Doc. **C-154**), p. 43.\n\nExpert Report No. 3 of the Minsk Cadaster Agency of 16 June 2015 (Doc. **C-154**), p. 43.\n\n639.\n\nIn summary, the Tribunal finds that the MoF Report, prepared *in tempore insuspecto* by an agency of Respondent, at the request of the Council of Ministers of the Republic of Belarus, accurately reflects\n\n- the costs incurred by Manolium-E in the construction of the Facilities,\n\n- which amounted to USD 19,434,679 as of February 2016 (the date of the MoF Report).\n\nThe Tribunal also concludes that these construction costs fairly represent the market value of the Facilities, as of that date.\n\n640.\n\nArt. 80 of the Protocol requires that the compensation awarded shall correspond to the market value of the expropriated investment on the date immediately preceding the expropriation. The date of expropriation was 27 January 2017, almost a year after the MoF Report. During this period, no additional work was carried out at the Facilities, nor is there any evidence that the Facilities suffered any particular deterioration. The Tribunal consequently accepts that the figure established in the MoF Report continued to accurately reflect market value as of the date when the expropriation was carried out.\n\nCurrency exchange methodology\n-----------------------------\n\n641.\n\nThe Protocol to the EEU Treaty requires that compensation be paid in a \"freely convertible currency\" and both Parties agree that damages should be paid in USD.768 However, the Parties disagree over the exchange rate that should be used for converting Manolium-E's costs - which were incurred in BYR - into USD.769\n\nHT Day 3, 654:1-18; R PHB, para. 96.\n\nThe MoF Report establishes Manolium-E's costs in BYR on p. 7 (Doc. **C-160**). On 1 July 2016, the New Belarusian Ruble (BYN) replaced the Belarusian Ruble (BYR) at a ratio of 1:10,000. *See* R PHB, n. 218.\n\n642.\n\nClaimant follows the approach taken by the MoF Report: costs are converted to USD using the exchange rate of the National Bank of the Republic of Belarus [the \"**NBB**\"] on the final day of each calendar month.770\n\nTaylor I (**CER-1**), para. 6.2.1; MoF Report (Doc. **C-160**), pp. 7, 10-18.\n\n643.\n\nRespondent disagrees: by converting Manolium-E\u2019s costs from BYR into USD at the exchange rate prevailing when the costs were incurred, instead of the date of expropriation, Claimant is allegedly transferring the risk of currency devaluation during the course of the investment to Respondent.771\n\nR PHB, para. 98.\n\n644.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees with Claimant.\n\n645.\n\nThe BYR was at the relevant time a weak currency, subject to continuous devaluation against the USD.772 The costs incurred by Manolium-E for the construction of the Facilities accrued between 2007 and 2011, while the MoF calculation was done in 2016. To provide a financially meaningful calculation, the MoF adopted the methodology of converting cost incurred in BYR into USD, at the prevailing exchange rate at the end of each month. The MoF did so with full knowledge of the currency situation in Belarus, using the approach that it considered most appropriate to provide to the Council of Ministers a figure expressed in USD which accurately reflected the true value of the construction work carried out by Manolium-E.\n\nTaylor I (**CER-1**), paras. 3.4.6 and 3.4.7.\n\n646.\n\nRespondent is now precluded from criticizing that methodology, and from proposing a self-serving alternative, that does not take into account the devaluation of the BYR against the USD, and which would decrease the USD 19.4 M established in the MoF Report by approximately 80%, to a mere USD 3.4 M.773\n\nR PHB, n. 223.\n\n**B.** **The payment to the National Library**\n----------------------------------------------\n\n647.\n\nMr. Qureshi excludes the payment to the National Library from his calculation of the fair market value of the Facilities, arguing that it does not represent a proper cost.774 On the other side, Mr. Taylor includes the sum in his calculation, because it formed part of the consideration agreed upon in the Investment Contract and its exclusion would result in unjust enrichment.\n\nR PHB, para. 100; R III, paras. 1447-1450; R II, paras. 712-714.\n\n648.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees with Claimant.\n\n649.\n\nThe original public tender for the awarding of the Mall required the successful bidder to provide financial or other assistance to public companies located in Minsk that were in unsatisfactory financial standing.775 This provision was then included in clause 6.13 of the initial Investment Contract as an investor\u2019s obligation: Claimant assumed the obligation to provide a sum of USD 1 M for the construction of a radioelectronic laboratory in Minsk.\n\nTender documentation of 24 April 2003 (Doc. **C-28**), clause 2.4.4; Investment Contract (Doc. **C-34**), clause 6.13.\n\n650.\n\nA few months thereafter, clause 6.13 was amended. The beneficiary of the 1 M USD payment was no longer the Minsk radioelectronic laboratory, but the National Library of Belarus:776\n\n\"6.13. Until 30 December 2003, to credit the amount equivalent to 1 million US dollars in Belarusian rubles at the exchange rate of the National Bank of the Republic of Belarus as of the date of making the relevant payments. Such amount shall be credited to account No. 3604200001114 opened with the National Bank of the Republic of Belarus, code of the bank 042, UNN 100691903, beneficiary - the Ministry of Finance of the Republic of Belarus\".\n\nIt is undisputed that, on 30 December 2003, Claimant paid USD 1 M to the National Library of Belarus.777\n\nAdditional Agreement No. 1 of 10 October 2003 (Doc. **C-47**), clause 1.\n\nConfirmation of the library payment of 30 December 2003 (Doc. **C-50**).\n\n651.\n\nThe Library payment was not a voluntary donation - it represented a contractual obligation, and implied an ancillary, albeit obligatory cost to the construction of the Facilities, imposed by Respondent in the Investment Contract. In order to establish the fair market price of the Facilities, the totality of costs, which Manolium-E was obliged to assume, must be taken into consideration. The position adopted by Respondent is contradictory: in the Investment Contract it required Manolium-E to contribute a sum of 1 M USD towards the construction of the National Library; but now, it disputes Claimant's right to seek compensation for that amount.\n\n652.\n\nThus, the National Library payment falls within the scope of costs properly and obligatorily incurred by Claimant in the construction of the Facilities and must form part of Claimant's compensation.\n\n**C.** **Conclusion**\n---------------------\n\n653.\n\nThe taxation and enforcement measures adopted by the Republic of Belarus, resulted in an expropriation,\n\n- Manolium-E being deprived of the Facilities, which were transferred to the Minsk Municipality without compensation, and\n\n- Claimant being deprived of the value of its shareholding in Manolium-E, which was reduced to nil.\n\n654.\n\nThe costs incurred by Manolium-E for the construction of the Facilities amounted to USD 20,434,679. This figure fairly represents the market value of the Facilities, and is the amount which the Tribunal will order Respondent to pay to Claimant as compensation for their unlawful expropriation.\n\n**2.2 C****ompensation for the non****-****development of the** **M****all**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n655.\n\nClaimant says that it is also entitled to compensation for the non-development of the Mall: if the Investment Contract had been complied with, the investor avers that it would have been able to build the Mall at a cost of USD 243 M, sell the real estate at a market price of USD 399 M, and obtain a significant profit of up to USD 156 M.778 Subsidiarily, Claimant alleges that as \"the absolute floor\" Claimant should receive under this heading the value, USD 8.87 M, another investor, known as OOO Astomaks, paid in a public auction for the right to develop a project similar to the Mall and located on the same premises.779\n\nC PHB, paras. 82 (Table 1) and 100(II)(c)(i)(a).\n\nC PHB, para. 87.\n\n656.\n\nRespondent disagrees, saying that Claimant is not entitled to compensation under this heading,780 that the lost profits are speculative and unproven781 and that the calculation is erroneous.782 Finally, Respondent disputes that Claimant is entitled to a minimum compensation equal to the amount paid by OOO Astomaks, because that company\u2019s right to develop the land was on different terms and conditions than those of Claimant.783\n\nR II, paras. 674-676; R III, paras. 1303-1306.\n\nR PHB, paras. 81-84; R III, paras. 1323-1345.\n\nR PHB, para. 85.\n\nR III, paras. 1382-1389; R PHB, para. 86.\n\nDiscussion\n----------\n\n657.\n\nThe first element which the Tribunal must analyze is the existence of causation: it is a general principle of international law that injured claimants bear the burden of demonstrating that there is a sufficiently close relationship between the host State\u2019s irregular conduct and the compensation which is being claimed. The duty to compensate extends only to those damages which are legally regarded as the consequence of an unlawful act.784 Art. 36.1 of the ILC Articles reflects this general principle:\n\n\"The State responsible for an internationally wrongful act is under an obligation to compensate for the damage caused thereby.\" [Emphasis added]\n\nCheng, B., *General Principles of Law as applied by International Courts and Tribunals*, 1987, p. 322.\n\n658.\n\nIn the present case, the Republic of Belarus adopted certain taxation and enforcement measures, which resulted in the expropriation of Claimant\u2019s investment, and is now obliged to compensate the investor, in an amount equal to the market value of the expropriated assets. In the previous section, the Tribunal has already concluded that the market value of the Facilities, as of the date of expropriation, amounted to USD 20.4 M.\n\n659.\n\nThe question which the Tribunal must now address is whether Claimant is entitled to a separate compensation, for the bankruptcy of and loss of value in Manolium-E, further to the compensation for the expropriation of the Facilities.\n\n660.\n\nThe Investment Contract, which authorized the development of the Mall, was executed in 2003, and 11 years later, in 2014, Respondent decided to approach the Belarusian courts requesting a judicial decision which would terminate the Investment Contract. The courts eventually accepted Respondent\u2019s claim, and declared the termination of the Investment Contract. The court decisions gave rise to the Termination Dispute, which the Tribunal analysed - as far as it had jurisdiction - and dismissed.\n\n661.\n\nThe necessary consequence of the Tribunal's lack of jurisdiction and dismissal of the Termination Dispute is that the termination of the Investment Contract did not amount to a breach of the Treaty, that Manolium-E was judicially deprived of its contractual right to develop the Mall, and that Respondent was entitled to award the same or a similar project to a new developer (something which Respondent eventually did, in September 2017).\n\n662.\n\nClaimant is now requesting additional compensation for the non-development of the Mall. The problem with Claimant's claim is that there is no cause-effect relationship between the breach committed by the Republic of Belarus and accepted by the Tribunal (the expropriation of the Facilities and of the shareholding in Manolium-E) and the damage for which compensation is being sought. Claimant and Manolium-E lost their entitlement to develop the Mall, because Respondent terminated the Investment Contract without violating the EEU Treaty - and are precluded from requesting additional compensation for this reason.\n\n663.\n\nClaimant's claim for compensation for the non-development of the Mall fails for lack of causation.\n\nOther grounds\n-------------\n\n664.\n\nThere are other additional arguments which militate against Claimant's entitlement to be compensated for the non-development of the Mall.\n\n665.\n\nFirst, Claimant has failed to prove that the profits it expected from the development, construction and sale of the project, can reasonably be anticipated, and are not based on unfounded speculations.\n\n666.\n\nThe Tribunal's opinion relies mainly on the following facts:\n\n- the calculations made by Claimant and its expert are a mere paper exercise: Claimant never obtained access to the Mall site, never developed a detailed design and precise projections, and construction never started;785 and\n\n- during the long period of negotiation and implementation of the Investment Contract, the Belarusian real estate market conditions for the development of a project like the Mall deteriorated;786 Respondent's allegation that the investor lost interest in developing an unprofitable project in the middle of an economic crisis rings true.787\n\nHT Day 3, 488:21-23; R III, paras. 1316-1322; R PHB, para. 81.\n\nHT Day 3, 489:3-14; Qureshi II (**RER-2**), para. 56.\n\nR III, paras. 1311-1322; R PHB, paras. 78-80.\n\n667.\n\nThus, any assessment of the lost profits in this case would be highly speculative.\n\n668.\n\nFinally, Claimant says that \"the absolute floor\" it should receive as compensation for the non-development of the Mall is the price of USD 8.87 M another investor, called OOO Astomaks, was willing to pay in a public auction for the same development right. Manolium adds that the price an independent buyer was willing to pay in an arm's length transaction is the gold standard in determining fair market value.788\n\nC PHB, para. 87.\n\n669.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees with Claimant's statement that a price agreed between willing buyer and willing seller is the gold standard of fair market value. But the question here is not to establish the fair market value of the right to develop the Mall, but the fair market price of Claimant's shares in Manolium-E at the time when the expropriation occurred. In this specific case, the value of the shares can be considered equivalent to the value of the company's sole asset: the Facilities, and specifically, the cost of constructing them, since Manolium-E was entitled to be compensated for these costs. But there is no reason to add an additional surcharge, to compensate for the failure to develop the Mall. There is no causal link between both magnitudes: upon valid termination of the Investment Contract, Manolium-E had no entitlement to the development of the Mall.\n\n\\* \\* \\*\n\n670.\n\nIn summary, the Tribunal concludes that Claimant is not entitled to any further compensation for the non-development of the Mall.\n\n**VIII.** **INTEREST**\n----------------------\n\n671.\n\nArt. 81 of the Protocol provides:\n\n\"In case of a delayed payment of compensation, interest shall be accrued in the period from the date of expropriation till the date of actual payment of compensation, to be calculated at the domestic interbank market rate for actually provided loans in US dollars for up to 6 months, but not below the rate of LIBOR or in the procedure determined by agreement between the investor and the Member State.\" [Emphasis added]\n\n672.\n\nThe rule is straightforward: interest accrues from the date of expropriation through the date of payment, at the higher of these two rates:\n\n- the domestic interbank market rate for loans of a maturity of up to six months; and\n\n- the London Inter-Bank Offered Rate [\"**LIBOR**\"].\n\nClaimant\u2019s position\n-------------------\n\n673.\n\nClaimant says that the rate most in line with the Treaty is the six-month USD LIBOR rate, plus a country risk premium of 6.5%, calculated in accordance with the methodology of Prof. Damodaran.789 Although the National Bank of Belarus (NBB) publishes interbank rates in foreign currencies, these rates are a mix of USD and EUR currencies, without information about the blend. Claimant explains that such a blended rate would be inappropriate for a debt denominated in USD.790\n\nC PHB, para. 90\n\nC PHB, para. 88.\n\nRespondent\u2019s position\n---------------------\n\n674.\n\nRespondent acknowledges that the precise rate foreseen in the Treaty (\"domestic interbank market rate for actually provided loans in US dollars for up to 6 months\") does not exist, because the NBB only publishes a blended interbank market rate for a period of over 60 days [the \"**NBB Published Rate**\"]. Respondent says that it is therefore necessary to apply a rate that is most in line with what the Treaty provides.791\n\nR PHB, para. 102.\n\n675.\n\nRespondent\u2019s position is that the NBB Published Rate is the closest to what is stipulated in the Treaty. The maturity of over 60 days complies with the up to six months period provided for in the Treaty. When the NBB Published Rate drops below the USD LIBOR rate, LIBOR should be adopted as the floor.792\n\nR PHB, para. 103.\n\n676.\n\nRespondent says that as a matter of treaty interpretation, no margin should be added to the NBB Published Rate/LIBOR, and especially not a margin which reflects the risk profile of the respondent State: Tribunals are loath to do so, because in such case the rate would reflect the country risk, rather than the investor\u2019s actual loss. This would run counter to the fundamental premise of compensation, which is to restore the position in which the claimant would have been, but for the breach.793\n\nR PHB, para. 110.\n\nDiscussion\n----------\n\n677.\n\nEvery decision on interest must distinguish the rate, calculation methodology, *dies a quo, dies ad quem,* and principal amount.\n\n678.\n\nSince the Tribunal has determined that the compensation due to Claimant amounts to USD 20,434,679, that is the \"**Principal Amount**\".\n\n**1.** **R****ate**\n-------------------\n\n679.\n\nThe Treaty provides precise guidance on the rate to be applied: interest accrues at the higher of\n\n- the domestic interbank market rate for loans of a maturity of up to six months; and\n\n- LIBOR.\n\n680.\n\nThe difficulty arises because the NBB does not publish a domestic interbank market rate for loans denominated in USD with a maturity of up to six months: both Parties agree that the NBB only publishes a blended USD/EUR interbank market rate for a period of over 60 days (already defined as the \"NBB Published Rate\").\n\n681.\n\nRespondent proposes to use the NBB Published Rate as a proxy of the \"domestic interbank market rate for loans of a maturity of up to six months\" foreseen in the Treaty.\n\n682.\n\nThe Tribunal concurs; the NBB Published Rate is closest to what is stipulated in the Treaty:\n\n- both rates are interbank lending rates;\n\n- both are applied in Belarus;\n\n- both relate to loans with maturities between two and six months; and\n\n- both are denominated in a hard currency with low inflation (USD and EUR).\n\n683.\n\nSince the precise rate established in the Treaty does not exist, the best solution to comply with the object and purpose of the Treaty is to adopt among those rates which the NBB actually publishes, that which is closest to the Treaty rate. The rate which meets this test is the NBB Published Rate, and this is the basic rate to be applied.\n\n684.\n\nWhen the NBB Published Rate drops below the LIBOR rate, the Treaty provides that LIBOR should be adopted as a floor. LIBOR is determined by the equilibrium between supply and demand, representing the interest rate at which banks can borrow funds from other banks in the London interbank market; it is fixed daily by the British Bankers\u2019 Association for different maturities and for different currencies.\n\n685.\n\nSince the Protocol speaks of loans in USD for up to six months, and the compensation is expressed in USD, the appropriate rate of reference should be the LIBOR rates for six-month deposits denominated in USD.\n\n686.\n\nA final caveat: Art. 81 of the Protocol foresees that \"interest shall be accrued\" in favour of the investor. If the NBB Published Rate and LIBOR were to become negative, the result should be that interest ceases to accrue, and that the Principal Amount would not be reduced by applying a negative interest rate.\n\nSurcharge or spread\n-------------------\n\n687.\n\nClaimant says that in accordance with the Treaty a country risk premium of 6.5%, calculated with the methodology of Prof. Damodaran, should be added to LIBOR.794\n\nC PHB, para. 90\n\n688.\n\nThe problem with Claimant\u2019s position is that the wording of the Treaty does not support its position: Art. 81 of the Protocol establishes that the applicable interest rate will be the higher of the NBB Published Rate and LIBOR. The ordinary meaning of the terms used by the Treaty does not give rise to doubt: in the absence of any reference to a surcharge or spread, or of an indication that a commercial rate of interest is to be applied, the Tribunal is not empowered *sua sponte* to increase the applicable interest rate.\n\n**2.** **C****alculation methodology**\n--------------------------------------\n\n689.\n\nBoth Parties have applied a compound interest to their interest calculations: Claimant has calculated the interest rate quarterly795 and Respondent monthly.796\n\nH5, slide 24; Taylor I (**CER-1**), para. 7.2.7.\n\nQureshi II (**RER-2**), para. 198.\n\n690.\n\nThe question whether interest should be accumulated periodically to the principal has been the subject of diverging decisions in international investment case law. Some case law797 tends to repudiate this possibility, but other case law tends to accept annual or semi-annual capitalization of unpaid interest.798\n\n*CMS Gas Transmission Company v. The Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/01/8, Award dated 12 May 2005 [\"***CMS***\"] (Doc. **RL-63**), paras. 470-471.\n\n*MTD Equity Sdn. Bhd. and MTD Chile S.A. v. Republic of Chile*, ICISD Case No. ARB/01/7, Award dated 25 May 2004 [\"***MTD***\"] (Doc. **CL-23**), para. 251; *PSEG Global Inc.and Konya Ilgin Electrik \u00dcretim ve Ticaret Limited Sirketi v. Republic of Turkey*, ICSID Case No. ARB/02/5, Award dated 19 January 2007 [\"***PSEG***\"], para. 348; *Joseph Charles Lemire v. Ukraine*, ICSID Case No. ARB/06/18, Award dated 28 March 2011 [\"***Lemire***\"], para. 361.\n\n691.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees with the later decisions. Loan agreements in which interest is calculated on the basis of LIBOR usually include a provision that unpaid interest must be capitalized at the end of the interest period, and will thereafter be considered as capital and accrue interest. The financial reason for this provision is that an unpaid lender has to resort to the LIBOR market, in order to fund the amounts due but defaulted, and the lender\u2019s additional funding costs have to be covered by the defaulting borrower.\n\n692.\n\nThis principle implies that, if Claimant had taken out a LIBOR loan to pay for the construction of the Facilities, the bank would have insisted that unpaid interest be capitalized at the end of each interest period. Consequently, if Claimant is to be kept fully indemnified for the harm suffered, interest owed under the Award should be capitalized at the end of each 6-month interest period.\n\n693.\n\nThe Tribunal, thus, decides that due and unpaid interest shall be capitalized semi-annually, from the *dies a quo.*\n\n**3.** ***Dies a quo***\n-----------------------\n\n694.\n\nClaimant requests that interest be calculated based on one of four alternative scenarios:799\n\n- from 31 January 2015;\n\n- from the dates of *de facto* transfer of the Facilities;\n\n- from the dates when expenses were incurred; and\n\n- from the expropriation date, 27 January 2017.\n\nC PHB, para. 100(II)(c)(iii)(b).\n\n695.\n\nRespondent argues that interest on the loss of the Facilities ought to be calculated from the actual date of transfer of the Facilities into municipal ownership on 27 January 2017.\n\n696.\n\nParagraph 81 of the Protocol provides that interest shall accrue \"from the date of expropriation\". In this case the expropriation culminated on 27 January 2017, with the transfer of the Facilities into municipal ownership. Thus, the Tribunal agrees with Respondent and finds that interest on the Principal Amount should accrue from 27 January 2017.\n\n**4.** ***Dies ad quem***\n-------------------------\n\n697.\n\nThe *dies ad quem* shall be the date of effective payment.\n\n\\* \\* \\*\n\n698.\n\nIn summary, the Tribunal decides that the Principal Amount of USD 20,434,679 will accrue interest from 27 January 2017 through the date of actual payment, at the higher of (i) the NBB Published Rate or (ii) LIBOR for six-month deposits denominated in USD, such interest to be capitalized six-monthly in arrears.\n\n**IX.** **COSTS**\n-----------------\n\n699.\n\nIn this section of the Award the Tribunal establishes and allocates the costs of this arbitration.\n\n700.\n\nArts. 40 to 42 of the UNCITRAL Rules govern the determination and allocation of costs.\n\n701.\n\nArt. 40.1 of the UNCITRAL Rules provides that \"[t]he arbitral tribunal shall fix the costs of arbitration in the final award [...].\"\n\n702.\n\nArt. 40.2 of the UNCITRAL Rules specifies that the notion of costs of arbitration covers the following expenses:\n\n(a) The fees of the arbitral tribunal to be stated separately as to each arbitrator and to be fixed by the tribunal itself in accordance with Art. 41 [the \"**Arbitrators\u2019 Fees**\"];\n\n(b) The reasonable travel and other expenses incurred by the arbitrators [the \"**Arbitrators\u2019 Expenses**\"];\n\n(c) The reasonable costs of expert advice and of other assistance required by the arbitral tribunal [the \"**Tribunal\u2019s Other Costs**\"];\n\n(d) The reasonable travel and other expenses of witnesses to the extent such expenses are approved by the arbitral tribunal;\n\n(e) The legal and other costs incurred by the Parties in relation to the arbitration to the extent that the arbitral tribunal determines that the amount of such costs is reasonable [the \"**Parties\u2019 Legal Costs**\" or \"**Legal Cost**s\"];\n\n(f) Any fees and expenses of the appointing authority as well as the fees and expenses of the Secretary-General of the PCA.\n\n**1.** **T****he** **P****arties****\u2019 L****egal**

prescribes the following:\n\n\"The fees and expenses of the arbitrators shall be reasonable in amount, taking into account the amount in dispute, the complexity of the subject matter, the time spent by the arbitrators and any other relevant circumstances of the case.\"\n\n707.\n\nThus, Art. 41.4(a) of the UNCITRAL Rules provides that, when informing the Parties of the Arbitrators\u2019 Fees and Expenses, \"the arbitral tribunal shall also explain the manner in which the corresponding amounts have been calculated.\"\n\n708.\n\nIn accordance with the ToA,801 approved by the Parties, the fees of the members of the Tribunal shall be calculated by reference to work done in connection with this arbitration and will be charged at the hourly rates agreed upon in this document.802 In addition, the Secretary to the Tribunal designated by the Tribunal with the consent of the Parties shall receive an hourly fee at an agreed rate for her participation in the Tribunal\u2019s sessions and for other work performed in connection with this arbitration.803 Likewise, the PCA\u2019s services as Registry were agreed to be billed in accordance with the PCA\u2019s schedule of fees.804\n\nToA, paras. 73-78.\n\nToA, para. 74.\n\nToA, para. 75.\n\nToA, para. 14.\n\n709.\n\nThe ToA also provide that the members of the Tribunal, the Secretary to the Tribunal and the PCA shall be entitled to recover such expenses as are reasonably incurred in connection with this arbitration, and as are reasonable in amount, provided that claims for expenses (e.g. travel and accommodation costs) are supported by invoices or receipts.805\n\nToA, paras. 14, 77.\n\n710.\n\nThe Arbitrators\u2019 Fees and Expenses are the following:\n\n|  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|  | **Fees** | **Expenses** |\n|

costs.\n\n712.\n\nIn summary, the Arbitrators' Fees and Expenses and the Tribunal's Other Costs under Art. 40.2(a) to (c) of the UNCITRAL Rules total EUR 804,849.77.\n\n**3.** **D****eposits for costs**\n---------------------------------\n\n713.\n\nAs set out in the ToA, the PCA has managed the funds deposited by the Parties as advances for the Tribunal's costs under Art. 40.2(a) to (c) of the UNCITRAL Rules.807 During the course of these proceedings, the Parties have made deposits totaling EUR 900,000. This amount was paid in equal shares by the Parties, in accordance with Art. 43 of the UNCITRAL Rules *(i.e.,* EUR 450,000 from Claimant and EUR 450,000 from Respondent).\n\nToA, para. 15.\n\n714.\n\nThe unexpended balance of the deposit, in the total amount of EUR 95,150.23, shall be returned to the Parties in equal shares in accordance with Art. 43.5 of the UNCITRAL Rules (*i.e.*, EUR 47,575.12 to each Party).\n\n**4. A****llocation of costs**\n------------------------------\n\n715.\n\nEach Party seeks that the counterparty be ordered to bear all costs and expenses of the present arbitral proceedings.808\n\n*See* paras. 237-238 *supra*.\n\n716.\n\nThe allocations of costs is governed by Art. 42 of the UNCITRAL Rules, which provides as follows:\n\n\"1. The costs of the arbitration shall in principle be borne by the unsuccessful party or parties. However, the arbitral tribunal may apportion each of such costs between the parties if it determines that apportionment is reasonable, taking into account the circumstances of the case.\n\n2. The arbitral tribunal shall in the final award or, if it deems appropriate, in any other award, determine any amount that a party may have to pay to another party as a result of the decision on allocation of costs\".\n\n717.\n\nThis provision gives the Tribunal broad discretion to allocate the costs between the Parties, the principal guideline being that the costs should be borne by the \"unsuccessful parties\". Otherwise, the provision directs the Tribunal to allocate the costs as it deems \"reasonable [...] taking into account the circumstances of the case.\"\n\nSuccess of the Parties\u2019 claims\n------------------------------\n\n718.\n\nAs for the outcome of this procedure, in general Claimant has been the successful party. Claimant has convinced the Tribunal that it has jurisdiction and that Claimant has suffered measures tantamount to an expropriation. The principle that costs follow the event mandates, in principle, that Respondent bear the costs of the arbitration, at least in their majority.\n\n719.\n\nHowever, Claimant sought damages in excess of USD 175 M for all its claims. The Tribunal has however concluded that the damage suffered by Claimant for Belarus\u2019 expropriation of the Facilities only amounts to USD 20.4 M plus interest809 - a quantum much lower than the one sought.\n\n*See* section VII *supra*.\n\n720.\n\nThus, although Claimant has prevailed, it has obtained a compensation that is substantially below the claimed amount.\n\nReasonability under the circumstances\n-------------------------------------\n\n721.\n\nTurning to other guidelines for apportioning of costs, Art. 42.1 of the UNCITRAL Rules permits the Tribunal to apportion costs between the Parties if it determines that apportionment is reasonable, taking into account the circumstances of the case. Typically, tribunals consider under this category aspects such as the conduct of each party throughout the proceedings or the complexity and novelty of the questions raised.\n\n722.\n\nAs for the conduct of the Parties, the Tribunal is pleased to report that neither Claimant nor Respondent have failed to comply with any procedural orders, fallen into unreasonable, obtrusive behavior, or acted in bad faith.\n\n723.\n\nAs to the other criterion - the complexity and novelty of the questions raised - the Parties have brought and argued complex matters of fact and law, which have required significant amounts of time and effort.\n\n**5.** **C****onclusion**\n-------------------------\n\n724.\n\nAll things being considered, the Tribunal thus finds it reasonable under the circumstances that the costs be divided in the following way:\n\n725.\n\nFirst, as for the Arbitrators\u2019 Fees and Expenses and the Tribunal\u2019s Other Costs, the Tribunal finds that these costs should be assumed by Respondent, given that Claimant has prevailed in the majority of the jurisdictional objections and the Tribunal has found a breach by Belarus of the EEU Treaty.\n\n726.\n\nThus, Belarus must reimburse Claimant the totality of Claimant\u2019s contribution to the Arbitrators\u2019 Fees and Expenses and the Tribunal\u2019s Other Costs (net of any final reimbursements made by the PCA), which amounts to EUR 402,424.88.810\n\nEUR 450,000.00 - EUR 47,575.12 = EUR 402,424.88\n\n727.\n\nSecond, as for the Parties\u2019 Legal Costs, the Tribunal finds that Respondent should assume 75% of these costs, given that although Claimant has prevailed in general, there is a significant difference between the compensation requested by Claimant and the one effectively awarded by the Tribunal.\n\n728.\n\nThus, Belarus must reimburse Claimant 75% of Claimant\u2019s Legal Costs, which amounts to USD 1,438,405.46.811\n\nUSD 1,917,873.95 \\* 0.,75= USD 1.438.405,46\n\nInterest\n--------\n\n729.\n\nThe Parties have requested that interest be applied over the amounts awarded as costs.812 And the Tribunal agrees.\n\nC I, para. 576; C II, para. 127; C III, para. 871; C PHB, para. 100; R II, para. 719; R III, para. 1464.\n\n730.\n\nThe Tribunal has already decided that the compensation awarded to Claimant shall accrue interest at the higher of (i) the NBB Published Rate or (ii) LIBOR for six-month deposits denominated in USD, such interest to be capitalized six-monthly in arrears.\n\n731.\n\nThe same shall be applied to the amounts that Respondent is ordered to reimburse as costs.\n\n732.\n\nThe *dies a quo* shall be the date of issuance of this Award.\n\n733.\n\nThe *dies ad quem* shall be the date of effective payment.\n\n**X.** **SUMMARY**\n------------------\n\n734.\n\nThe dispute brought before the Tribunal required that the Tribunal decide on Respondent\u2019s jurisdictional objections (1.), on the breach of Respondent's obligations under the EEU Treaty (**2.**) and on the compensation owed to Claimant plus interest and costs (**3**.).\n\n**1.** **J****urisdiction**\n---------------------------\n\n735.\n\nRespondent submitted the following five jurisdictional objections:\n\n- first, the *Ratione Temporis* Objection alleging that the Tribunal lacked jurisdiction to decide both the Termination and the Tax Disputes which arose before the Treaty entered into force on 1 January 2015;\n\n- second, the Contractual Objection alleging that the Termination Dispute was a contract claim and not a Treaty claim;\n\n- third, the Minsktrans Objection averring that Minsktrans was not empowered to exercise government authority and performed its obligations under the Investment Contract in a private capacity;\n\n- fourth, the Domestic Law Objection, arguing that the Tribunal lacked jurisdiction under the Belarusian Investment Law; and\n\n- finally, the *Ratione Materiae* Objection alleging that Claimant failed to prove that it owns the investment made through Manolium-E.\n\n736.\n\nOf the five jurisdictional objections, the Tribunal partially entertained Respondent's *Ratione Temporis* Objection, which rendered the Contractual and Minsktrans Objections moot, and found - by majority - for Respondent in the Domestic Law Objection. The Tribunal decided as follows:\n\n- The Tribunal has jurisdiction *ratione temporis* to decide the Tax Dispute in its entirety.\n\n- As regards the Termination Dispute, the Tribunal partially accepted the *Ratione Temporis* Objection, and decided:\n\no that it does have jurisdiction to adjudicate the alleged breaches of the Treaty (expropriation and FET standard, including denial of justice), with regard to measures which occurred after the Effective Date (*i.e.*, (i) the Cassation Decision and (ii) the auctioning in favour of a third party of the right to develop a project similar to the Mall); and\n\no that it lacks jurisdiction to adjudicate all other alleged breaches of the Treaty forming part of the Termination Dispute which occurred before the Effective Date.\n\n- The Tribunal\u2019s decision regarding the *Ratione Temporis* Objection rendered the Contractual Objection and the Minsktrans Objection moot.\n\n- The Tribunal lacks jurisdiction to adjudicate the Termination and the Tax Disputes submitted by Claimant applying the Belarusian Investment Law.\n\n- Finally, the Tribunal dismissed the *Ratione Materiae* Objection and declared that it has jurisdiction over Claimant\u2019s claims, Claimant being the owner of several investments in Belarus protected under the EEU Treaty.\n\n**2.** **M****erits**\n---------------------\n\nThe Tax Dispute\n---------------\n\n737.\n\nThe Tax Dispute gives rise to claims for expropriation and for breach of the FET standard.\n\n738.\n\nThe Tribunal has found that the Republic of Belarus adopted taxation and enforcement measures against Manolium-E and Claimant with consequences equivalent to those of expropriation in breach of Arts. 79, 80 and 81 of the Protocol. The taxation and enforcement measures resulted in an expropriation: Manolium-E was deprived of the Facilities, which were transferred to the Minsk Municipality without compensation, while Claimant was deprived of the value of its shareholding in Manolium-E, which was reduced to nil.\n\n739.\n\nThe Tribunal\u2019s findings that the Minsk Municipality committed an abuse of tax law, and that the tax and enforcement measures were arbitrary, imply that the Republic of Belarus also violated the FET standard towards Claimant and its investments.\n\nThe Termination Dispute\n-----------------------\n\n740.\n\nThe Tribunal dismissed Claimant\u2019s claims under the Termination Dispute. The Tribunal decided that:\n\n- the Cassation Decision did not constitute a denial of justice nor a judicial expropriation, and that\n\n- Respondent\u2019s decision to auction the right to design and construct a project similar to the Mall did not constitute a Treaty violation.\n\n**3.** **Q****uantum**\n----------------------\n\n741.\n\nManolium claimed the following:813\n\n- first, lost profits for the Mall of USD 155.9 M or any other amount the Tribunal finds justified;\n\n- second, loss of the Facilities amounting to USD 20,434,679;\n\n- alternatively, damages in the form of loss of profits for the non-development of the Mall for USD 31.87 M or 8.87 M;814\n\n- interest on all sums awarded to Claimant; and\n\n- an order that Respondent reimburse all arbitration costs, including legal costs.\n\nC PHB, para. 100(II)(c)(i).\n\nC PHB, para. 100(II)(c)(ii).\n\n742.\n\nThe Tribunal concluded that the proper compensation due to Claimant under the Treaty amounts to USD 20,434,679. This Principal Amount will accrue interest from 27 January 2017 through the date of actual payment, at the higher of (i) the NBB Published Rate or (ii) LIBOR for six-month deposits denominated in USD, such interest to be capitalized six-monthly in arrears.\n\n743.\n\nFinally, the Tribunal decided that Belarus must reimburse Claimant the totality of Claimant\u2019s contribution to the Arbitrators\u2019 Fees and Expenses and the Tribunal\u2019s Other Costs, as well as 75% of Claimant\u2019s Legal Costs, plus interest from the date of this Award through the date of actual payment, at the higher of (i) the NBB Published Rate or (ii) LIBOR for six-month deposits denominated in USD, such interest to be capitalized six-monthly in arrears.\n\n**XI.** **DECISION**\n--------------------\n\n744.\n\nFor the foregoing reasons the Tribunal:\n\n1. Declares that it has *ratione temporis* jurisdiction to decide (i) all measures related to the Tax Dispute (ii) those measures related to the Termination Dispute which occurred after the Effective Date.\n\n2. Declares that it lacks jurisdiction to adjudicate the Termination and the Tax Disputes applying the Belarusian Investment Law.\n\n3. Dismisses Respondent\u2019s *Ratione Materiae* Objection.\n\n4. Declares that the Republic of Belarus adopted taxation and enforcement measures against Manolium-E and Claimant with consequences equivalent to those of expropriation, in breach of Arts. 79, 80 and 81 of the Protocol.\n\n5. Declares that the Republic of Belarus breached the FET standard established in Art. 68 of the Protocol.\n\n6. Orders the Republic of Belarus to pay Claimant USD 20,434,679 as compensation.\n\n7. Orders the Republic of Belarus to pay Claimant interest on the compensation, accrued between 27 January 2017 and the date of actual payment, calculated at the higher of (i) the NBB Published Rate or (ii) LIBOR for six-month deposits denominated in USD, such interest to be capitalized six-monthly in arrears.\n\n8. Orders the Republic of Belarus to pay Claimant (i) the totality of Claimant\u2019s contribution to the Arbitrators\u2019 Fees and Expenses and the Tribunal\u2019s Other Costs, which amounts to EUR 402,424.88, and (ii) 75% of Claimant\u2019s Legal Costs, which amount to USD 1,438,405.46.\n\n9. Orders the Republic of Belarus to pay Claimant interest on the amounts awarded in point 8 *supra,* from the date of this Award until the date of payment calculated at the higher of (i) the NBB Published Rate or (ii) LIBOR for six-month deposits denominated in USD, such interest to be capitalized six-monthly in arrears.\n\n10. Dismisses all other claims.\n\n745.\n\nAll Decisions are unanimous, except for decision 2 *supra,* which was taken by majority."}]}
