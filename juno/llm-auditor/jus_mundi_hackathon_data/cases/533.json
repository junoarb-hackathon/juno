FACTUAL BACKGROUND**\n-------------------------\n\n4.1.\n\nThis arbitration arises from an alleged violation by Respondent of Articles 10(1), 10(7) and 13 of the 1994 Energy Charter Treaty (the \"ECT\" or the \"Treaty\").1 Claimants argue that an act of the Republic of Hungary, which was the reintroduction in 2006 and 2007 of administrative pricing pursuant to two Price Decrees, after administrative prices had been abolished as of 1 January 2004, violated their rights under the ECT.\n\nArticle 10(1) and 10(7), and Article 13 of the ECT read as follows:\n\nArticle 10(1) Each Contracting Party shall, in accordance with the provisions of this Treaty, encourage and create stable, equitable, favourable and transparent conditions for Investors of other Contracting Parties to make Investments in its Area. Such conditions shall include a commitment to accord at all times to Investments of Investors of other Contracting Parties fair and equitable treatment. Such Investments shall also enjoy the most constant protection and security and no Contracting Party shall in any way impair by unreasonable or discriminatory measures their management, maintenance, use, enjoyment or disposal. In no case shall such Investments be accorded treatment less favourable than that required by international law, including treaty obligations. Each Contracting Party shall observe any obligations it has entered into with an Investor or an Investment of an Investor of any other Contracting Party.\n\nArticle 10(7) Each Contracting Party shall accord to Investments in its Area of Investors of other Contracting Parties, and their related activities including management, maintenance, use, enjoyment or disposal, treatment no less favourable than that which it accords to Investments of its own Investors or of the Investors of any other Contracting Party or any third state and their related activities including management, maintenance, use, enjoyment or disposal, whichever is the most favourable.\n\nArticle 13(1) Investments of Investors of a Contracting Party in the Area of any other Contracting Party shall not be nationalized, expropriated or subjected to a measure or measures having effect equivalent to nationalization or expropriation (hereinafter referred to as \"Expropriation\") except where such Expropriation is:  \n (a) for a purpose which is in the public interest;  \n (b) not discriminatory;  \n (c) carried out under due process of law; and  \n (d) accompanied by the payment of prompt, adequate and effective compensation.\n\nSuch compensation shall amount to the fair market value of the Investment expropriated at the time immediately before the Expropriation or impending Expropriation became known in such a way as to affect the value of the Investment (hereinafter referred to as the \"Valuation Date\").\n\nSuch fair market value shall at the request of the Investor be expressed in a Freely Convertible Currency on the basis of the market rate of exchange existing for that currency on the Valuation Date. Compensation shall also include interest at a commercial rate established on a market basis from the date of Expropriation until the date of payment.\n\nArticle 13(2) The Investor affected shall have a right to prompt review, under the law of the Contracting Party making the Expropriation, by a judicial or other competent and independent authority of that Contracting Party, of its case, of the valuation of its Investment, and of the payment of compensation, in accordance with the principles set out in paragraph (1).\n\nArticle 13(3) For the avoidance of doubt, Expropriation shall include situations where a Contracting Party expropriates the assets of a company or enterprise in its Area in which an Investor of any other Contracting Party has an Investment, including through the ownership of shares.\n\n4.2.\n\nIn 1995, Hungary announced an energy sector privatization as part of a modernization strategy, which included the privatization of certain state-owned power stations.\n\n4.3.\n\nOn 4 July 1996, a Purchase and Sale Agreement (\"PSA\")2 was signed between, on the one hand, two Hungarian state-owned entities, APV and MVM, and on the other hand, AES Summit, pursuant to which AES Summit purchased a majority shareholding in the company Tiszai Er\u00f6m\u00fc R\u00e9szv\u00e9nyt\u00e1rsas\u00e1g (now called AES Tisza - the second Claimant in this arbitration). The assets of AES Tisza included a power station known as Tisza II as well as two older coal-fired power stations, known as the Borsod power station and the Tiszapalkonya power station. The investment made by AES Summit was approximately US$ 130 million.\n\nExhibit C-4\n\n4.4.\n\nAs a result of the PSA, Hungary was obliged to amend and extend the term of the existing power purchase agreement with Tisza II - which had been signed on 10 October 1995 (\"Original Tisza II PPA\")3 - and to enter into a new long-term power purchase agreement for the Borsod power station (\"Borsod PPA\"). For its part, AES Summit agreed to pursue and complete a retrofit of all four units at the Tisza II power station and the construction of a new power plant at Borsod.\n\nThe Original PPA required MVM to pay several different types of fees to AES Tisza, of which there were two major components: (a) the Availability Fee (payment for capacity to be in place in case it is needed); and (b) the Energy Fee (payment for the cost of the power it actually requires to have generated).\n\n4.5.\n\nIn October 2000, AES Corporation (the ultimate parent company of the Claimants) and AES Summit commenced an arbitration against APV and MVM regarding an alleged failure of Hungary, APV and MVM to grant the promised amendment and extension of the Original Tisza II PPA and the Borsod PPA (the \"2000 PSA Claim\").4\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 79.\n\n4.6.\n\nA month later, in November 2000, AES Summit commenced another arbitration against Hungary under the ECT and the Agreement Between the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the Government of the People\u2019s Republic of Hungary for the Promotion and Reciprocal Protection of Investments (the \"2000 Treaty Claim\").5\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 79.\n\n4.7.\n\nBoth arbitrations were settled by a Settlement Agreement dated 19 December 20016 (the \"2001 Settlement Agreement\"), by which the Claimants granted a release by way of a full and final settlement of all claims made in the arbitration proceeding. Hungary was a party to the 2001 Settlement Agreement. The 2001 Settlement Agreement superseded all prior agreements, understandings, negotiations and discussions of the parties. Some other terms of the 2001 Settlement Agreement that concern this arbitration are the following:\n\n(a) the 2001 Settlement Agreement contained \"amendments to the 1995 Tisza PPA [Original Tisza II PPA] to be entered into pursuant to this Agreement, in the form contained in schedule 1 [of the Settlement Agreement];\"7\n\n(b) AES Summit and AES Corporation were released \"from any and all obligations and/or liabilities arising under the PSA to pursue the implementation of the Development Projects.\"\n\nExhibit C-7.\n\nExhibit C-7, p. 4.\n\n4.8.\n\nThe 2001 Settlement Agreement also contained a waiver of sovereign immunity clause, which reads as follows:\n\n\"WAIVER OF SOVEREIGN IMMUNITY\n\nEach of APV and MVM (as to (a) through (d)) and the Republic (as to (a) only) unconditionally and irrevocably:\n\n(a) agrees that the execution and performance by it of this Agreement constitute private and commercial acts rather than public, administrative or governmental acts;\n\n(b) agrees that should any proceedings arising out of this Agreement be brought against it or its assets, no immunity from such proceedings shall be claimed by or on behalf of itself or with respect to its assets;\n\n(c) waives any right of immunity which it or any of its assets now has or may acquire in the future in any jurisdiction in connection with proceedings arising out of this Agreement; and\n\n(d) consents to the enforcement of any arbitration award against it in proceedings brought in accordance with Clause 11 in any jurisdiction (including without limitation the making, enforcement or execution against or in respect of any property whatsoever, irrespective of its use or intended use).\"\n\n4.9.\n\nThe inclusion of the sovereign immunity clause indicates that the parties agreed that the execution and performance of the 2001 Settlement Agreement and its Annexes constituted private and commercial acts, which means that Hungary was acting in its private character rather than in a public or governmental character.\n\n4.10.\n\nAlso on 19 December 2001, as required by clause 4.1 of the 2001 Settlement Agreement, the Original Tisza II PPA was amended by agreement between MVM and AES Tisza (the \"2001 Amendment Agreement\"). The Original Tisza II PPA, as amended by the Amendment Agreement, will be referred hereinafter as the \"2001 PPA.\" The Amendment Agreement was to be governed by Hungarian Law and read and construed as one document with the Original Tisza II PPA.8 In pertinent part, the Amendment Agreement provided that:\n\n(a) the term of the Original Tisza II PPA was to be extended to 31 December 2016;\n\n(b) AES Tisza would make a four-phased series of improvements (\"Retrofit\") to the power stations and, in order to finance the proposed retrofit, it could assign, and/or create security interests in the Amendment Agreement; and\n\n(c) a new clause was to be inserted into the Original Tisza II PPA, Clause 3.7, regarding a possible change in the law. That clause provides:\n\n\"3.7 Change in Law\n\n(a) Illegality\n\nIf, during the term of this Agreement, a Change in Law occurs as a result of which either party's obligations under this Agreement become illegal, unenforceable or impossible to perform, the Parties must give each other notice of the relevant Change in Law and its effect on this Agreement and the Parties shall be obliged for the Negotiating Period following such notice to conduct good faith negotiations and use all reasonable efforts to agree to changes (if any) that can be made to this Agreement in order to reflect the intent of the Parties at the date of the Amendment Agreement and the nature of the circumstances in question. If, despite their reasonable efforts, the Parties are unable to agree upon such changes by the expiration of such Negotiating Period, either Party shall have the right to terminate this Agreement by written notice to the other Party. Upon such termination:\n\n(i) if the Law affected by the relevant Change in Law is of the type specified in point (i) of the definition of \"Laws\", the following shall apply:\n\n(A) if the relevant Change in Law occurs on or prior to January 1, 2007 or the date of the accession of the Republic of Hungary to the European Union, if later then Section 3.3 (c) shall apply and on the first day of effectiveness of the Utilization Agreement of New PPA, the Transmission Company shall pay to Generator an amount equal to the Recognized Debt, outstanding at the date of the termination notice (and, without prejudice to the terms of the Settlement Agreement, no other termination charge or other compensation, liquidated damages or any indemnification shall be payable by either Party to the other Party relating to a condition or circumstance occurring because of such Change in Law or such termination); and\n\n(B) if the relevant Change of Law occurs after January 1, 2007 or the date of the accession of the Republic of Hungary to the European Union, if later, then, without prejudice to the terms of the Settlement Agreement, neither Party shall be obliged to pay a termination charge or other compensation, liquidated damages or any indemnification to the other Party Relating to a condition or circumstance occurring because of such Change in Law or such termination.\n\n(ii) if the Law affected by the relevant Change in Law is not of the type specified in point (i) of the definition of \"Laws\", then Section 3.3 (c) shall apply and on the first day of effectiveness of the Utilization Agreement or New PPA, Transmission Company shall pay compensation to Generator in the amount of the Recognized Debt outstanding at the time of the termination notice.\"\n\nExhibit C-9, p. 2.\n\n4.11.\n\nPursuant to the Amendment Agreement, the existing pricing schedule in the Original Tisza II PPA (Schedule 6) was replaced by a new pricing schedule which provided, *inter alia,* that \"... as long as the public utility generator prices are subject to administrative pricing, the prices published by Decree No. 55/1996 (20 December) of the Ministry of Economy (GM) (and any amendments thereof, including currently published GM Decree No. 46/2000 (21 December)) and determined on the basis of the cost review and price review of [the Hungarian Energy Office (\"HEO\")] pursuant to the rules and prescriptions set forth in GM Decree No. 45/2000 (21 December) shall be acknowledged and applied.\"9 The new pricing schedule also went on to set out detailed pricing formula which were to be applied \"following the termination of price administration of public utility generator prices.\"10\n\nExhibit C-9, p. 24 of the 2001 Amendment Agreement.\n\nThis latter provision is to be understood against Act CX of 2001 on Electricity (\"2001 Electricity Act\") which provided for termination of Hungary\u2019s existing administrative pricing regime for generators from 1 January 2004.\n\n4.12.\n\nIn 2004, Hungary acceded to the European Union.\n\n4.13.\n\nAs of 1 January 2004, the administrative pricing regime for generators was terminated as had been foreshadowed by the 2001 Electricity Act. Thereafter, at least for a time, the specific formula established in the new pricing schedule in the 2001 PPA was used to calculate the prices paid to AES Tisza IT\n\n4.14.\n\nBy December 2004, AES Tisza had completed three of the four phases of the Tisza II Retrofit at a cost of \u20ac 98 million.11\n\nClaimants\u2019 Request for Arbitration, p. 8. This is not contested by the Respondent.\n\n4.15.\n\nIn 2005, a political debate arose in Hungary regarding what were thought by some to be the high profits of the energy generators.\n\n4.16.\n\nThe debate included argumentations in parliamentary sessions and publication of articles in the media, which discussed the existence of alleged excessive profits being earned by the generators.12 Amongst other things, MVM was said to be charging less to the consumers than the price it was paying to the generators for such electricity.13\n\nAs the debate developed, references in the press and elsewhere were made to generators profits as \"extra,\" \"too high,\" \"huge\" and \"luxury.\" The Hungarian public was described as \"defenceless\" against rising prices and it was said that such \"luxury profits\" must be \"knocked down.\"\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 110.\n\n4.17.\n\nOn 23 March 2005, during a debate before the Economic Committee of Parliament, Ferenc Horv\u00e1th, president of the Hungarian Energy Office, argued that if the HEO was to meet the deadline for market pricing in 2007, a financially feasible solution for the problems of MVM\u2019s stranded costs14 had to be found. He stated that a \"reasonable\" profit rate for the generators of below 10% could be acceptable.\n\nThe difference between what MVM paid for electricity and what it could recover.\n\n4.18.\n\nOn 10 November 2005, HEO sent a letter to AES Tisza in which it claimed that the profits of the company were \"unjustifiable high\" and suggested that the profits should be capped at a maximum of 7.1%.\n\n4.19.\n\nOn 28 November 2005, a first meeting took place between representatives of HEO, MVM and the Claimants. At least four more meetings took place without reaching an agreement between the parties.\n\n4.20.\n\nOn 3 March 2006, the Hungarian parliament amended the 2001 Electricity Act (the \"2006 Electricity Act\") by reintroducing a regime of administrative prices for electricity sold by generators to MVM.\n\n4.21.\n\nOn 6 November 2006, the GKM Decree No. 80/2006 was issued, which became effective on 9 December 2006 (\"2006 Price Decree\").\n\n4.22.\n\nOn 26 January 2007, the GMK issued Decree No. 14/2007, which was to remain effective until December 2007 (\"2007 Price Decree\").\n\n4.23.\n\nBoth Decrees provided a fixed price for each generator. Consequently, the formula established in Schedule 6 of the 2001 PPA was no longer applicable.\n\n4.24.\n\nThe Claimants allege that due to the issue of both Price Decrees, they have suffered a price cut of approximately 43% (under the 2006 Price Decree) and 35% (under the 2007 Price Decree) of the Availability Fee that MVM was obligated to pay pursuant to the 2001 Tisza II PPA.\n\n4.25.\n\nThe Claimants contend that the Price Decrees were reintroduced for political reasons and that, in addition to the direct loss of revenue for AES Tisza, their lenders have declared it in default under the loan documentation in respect to the \u20ac 98 million project finance loan facilities made to the company to finance the Tisza II Retrofit.\n\n4.26.\n\nThe Claimants filed a Request for Arbitration on 6 July 2007.\n\n**5. THE CLAIMS**\n-----------------\n\n5.1.\n\nThe Claimants submit that Hungary violated its obligations under the ECT by reintroducing administrative pricing through the issuance of the Price Decrees. Specifically the alleged violations are the following:\n\n(a) breach of its obligation to provide fair and equitable treatment;\n\n(b) impairment of AES\u2019 investment by unreasonable and discriminatory measures;\n\n(c) breach of its obligation to provide national treatment;\n\n(d) breach of its obligation to provide most favoured nation treatment;\n\n(e) breach of its obligation to provide constant protection and security; and\n\n(f) expropriation.\n\n5.2.\n\nThe Respondent did not question the Claimants\u2019 right to bring its claims to ICSID arbitration. Nevertheless, there are some conditions which define the jurisdiction of an ICSID tribunal. In order for the Centre to have jurisdiction over a dispute, three - well-known-conditions must be met, according to Article 25 of the ICSID Convention, to which one must add a condition resulting from the general principle of non-retroactivity:\n\n(a) a condition *ratione personae* : the dispute must oppose a contracting state and a national of another contracting state;\n\n(b) a condition *ratione materiae:* the dispute must be a legal dispute arising directly out of an investment;\n\n(c) a condition *ratione voluntatis, i.e.,* the contracting state and the investor must consent in writing that the dispute be settled through ICSID arbitration;\n\n(d) a condition *ratione temporis:* the ICSID Convention must have been applicable at the relevant time.\n\n5.3.\n\nPursuant to Article 41 of the ICSID Convention, the Tribunal is the judge of its own competence and therefore compliance with certain preconditions must be analyzed.\n\n**6. JURISDICTION AND ADMISSIBILITY**\n-------------------------------------\n\n**6.1 The Parties (*****ratione personae*****)**\n------------------------------------------------\n\n6.1.1.\n\nThe conditions for the existence of ICSID jurisdiction are stated in the Washington Convention and the Energy Charter Treaty.\n\n***Claimants***\n---------------\n\n6.1.2.\n\nThe UK signed the ICSID Convention on 26 May 1965 and deposited instruments of ratification on 19 December 1966. The ICSID Convention entered into force for the UK on 18 January 1967.\n\n6.1.3.\n\nThe UK ratified the ECT on 16 December 1997 and the Treaty entered into force on 16 April 1998.\n\n6.1.4.\n\nAES Summit Generation Limited (\"AES Summit\") is a company incorporated under the laws of the United Kingdom on 7 December 1995 and has its principal place of business at 37-39 Kew Foot Road, Richmond, Surrey, TW9 2SS. As a national of the United Kingdom, AES Summit is a national of a \"contracting state\" for purposes of Article 25(1) of the Convention.\n\n6.1.5.\n\nAES-Tisza Eromu Kft (\"AES Tisza\") is a company incorporated under the laws of the Republic of Hungary and has its principal place of business at H-3581 Tisza\u00fajv\u00e1ros, Pf: 53, Hungary.\n\n6.1.6.\n\nAES Summit owns 99% of, and exercises ownership and control over, AES Tisza. Therefore, pursuant to Article 26(7)15 of the ECT, AES Tisza shall be treated as a national of \"another contracting state\" for purposes of Article 25(2)(b) of the Convention.\n\nArticle 26(7) ECT reads:  \n (7) An Investor other than a natural person which has the nationality of a Contracting Party party to the dispute on the date of the consent in writing referred to in paragraph (4) and which, before a dispute between it and that Contracting Party arises, is controlled by Investors of another Contracting Party, shall for the purpose of article 25(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention be treated as a \"national of another Contracting State\" and shall for the purpose of article 1(6) of the Additional Facility Rules be treated as a \"national of another State.\"\n\n***Respondent***\n----------------\n\n6.1.7.\n\nHungary signed the ICSID Convention on 1 October 1986 and deposited instruments of ratification on 4 February 1987. The ICSID Convention entered into force for Hungary on 6 March 1987.\n\n6.1.8.\n\nRespondent signed the ECT on 27 February 1995, ratified the Treaty on 8 April 1998, and the Treaty entered into force on 16 April 1998.\n\n**6.2 Legal Dispute Arising Directly out of an Investment (*****ratione materiae*****)**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n6.2.1.\n\nClaimants allege violations of their rights under the ECT. There are disagreements on different points of law and fact, which creates a conflict of legal views and interests between the parties, and the present dispute hence qualifies as a legal dispute under Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention.\n\n6.2.2.\n\nClaimants claim to have invested approximately US$ 130 million and \u20ac 98 million into the Hungarian electricity sector.\n\n6.2.3.\n\nFirst, in 1996, AES Summit entered into a Purchase and Sale Agreement of approximately US$ 130 million with the Hungarian state privatization and electricity transmission companies, APV and MVM respectively, for a majority shareholding in a Hungarian electricity generation company which, after its purchase, became known as AES Tisza.\n\n6.2.4.\n\nLater in 2001, AES Tisza invested approximately \u20ac 98 million to retrofit the power station.\n\n6.2.5.\n\nBoth actions (purchasing the company and carrying out the Retrofit of the power station) qualify as investments in accordance with Article 1(6) of the ECT and Article 25 of the ICSID Convention.16\n\nArticle 1(6) of the ECT reads:\n\n(6) \"Investment\" means every kind of asset, owned or controlled directly or indirectly by an Investor and includes: tangible and intangible, and movable and immovable, property, and any property rights such as leases, mortgages, liens, and pledges; (b) a company or business enterprise, or shares, stock, or other forms of equity participation in a company or business enterprise, and bonds and other debt of a company or business enterprise; (c) claims to money and claims to performance pursuant to contract having an economic value and associated with an Investment; (d) Intellectual Property; (e) Returns; (f) any right conferred by law or contract or by virtue of any licences and permits granted pursuant to law to undertake any Economic Activity in the Energy Sector. A change in the form in which assets are invested does not affect their character as investments and the term \"Investment\" includes all investments, whether existing at or made after the later of the date of entry into force of this Treaty for the Contracting Party of the Investor making the investment and that for the Contracting Party in the Area of which the investment is made (hereinafter referred to as the \"Effective Date\") provided that the Treaty shall only apply to matters affecting such investments after the Effective Date. \"Investment\" refers to any investment associated with an Economic Activity in the Energy Sector and to investments or classes of investments designated by a Contracting Party in its Area as \"Charter efficiency projects\" and so notified to the Secretariat.\n\n**6.3 Written Consent (*****ratione voluntatis)***\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n6.3.1.\n\nIn the Request for Arbitration, Claimants provide their written consent to submit the dispute to the jurisdiction of the Centre.\n\n6.3.2.\n\nIn addition, in their Request for Arbitration and in their Memorial, Claimants maintain that Hungary gave its consent to the submission of the dispute to the jurisdiction of the Centre pursuant to Articles 26(3) and 26(5)(a) of the ECT.\n\n6.3.3.\n\nThis statement was not disputed by Hungary in its Counter-Memorial, nor was it contested in the Respondent\u2019s Rejoinder. Hence, the parties have consented in writing to ICSID jurisdiction in accordance with Article 25 of the ICSID Convention.\n\n**6.4 Condition** ***ratione temporis***\n----------------------------------------\n\n6.4.1.\n\nHungary signed the Treaty on 27 February 1995 and expressly declared that it did not accept the provisional application of the ECT *(see* Article 45(2)(a) of the ECT). Nevertheless, in accordance with Article 1(6), the investments protected by the ECT include those made before the entry into force of this Treaty, provided that it shall only apply to matters affecting such investments after the Effective Date.\n\n6.4.2.\n\nConsequently this Tribunal can analyze the alleged breaches of the ECT given that they are said to have occurred after the entry into force of the Treaty, and after the entry into force of the ICSID Convention.\n\n**6.5 Procedural requirements pursuant to Article 26 of the ECT.**\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n6.5.1.\n\nRegarding Article 26(1) and (2) of the ECT,17 the Tribunal observes that communications between the Claimants and the Respondent regarding negotiations of the dispute began in January 2007. Furthermore, in April 2007, the parties conducted in person negotiations without reaching a resolution of the dispute.\n\nArticle 26(1) and (2) of the ECT read:\n\n(1) Disputes between a Contracting Party and an Investor of another Contracting Party relating to an Investment of the latter in the Area of the former, which concern an alleged breach of an obligation of the former under Part III shall, if possible, be settled amicably.\n\n(2) If such disputes can not be settled according to the provisions of paragraph (1) within a period of three months from the date on which either party to the dispute requested amicable settlement, the Investor party to the dispute may choose to submit it for resolution...\n\n6.5.2.\n\nTherefore, the Tribunal considers that the three month \"cooling-off period\" was respected and that the Claimants had the right to submit the dispute to resolution according to Article 26(2) of the Convention.\n\n6.5.3.\n\nBased on the evidence provided in the proceeding, there is no record that Claimants chose to submit their dispute before Hungary\u2019s courts or administrative tribunals. Therefore, it is clear to this Tribunal that the dispute does not fall within the scope of Article 26(2)(a) of the ECT.\n\n6.5.4.\n\nSimilarly, there is no evidence that either party used any applicable or previously agreed dispute settlement procedure in order to settle the dispute.18\n\nEven though there was a procedure started by the European Commission to investigate the alleged state aid awarded by Hungary through Power Purchase Agreements, it is to be noted that such procedure was not between the parties to this dispute but between the European Commission and Hungary. In addition, the subject matter in such investigation was to determine whether the Power Purchase Agreements contained state Aid, under European Law (Final Decision C(2008)2223 of June 04, 2008), which is a different dispute than the one subject to this arbitration. The subject matter of that proceeding being different from the subject matter of this dispute, allows the Tribunal to sustain that the claim should not be barred by *res judicata.*\n\n6.5.5.\n\nConsequently, the Tribunal concludes that Article 26(3)19 of the ECT applies to this case.\n\nArticle 26(3) of the ECT reads:\n\n(3)(a) Subject only to subparagraphs (b) and (c), each Contracting Party hereby gives its unconditional consent to the submission of a dispute to international arbitration or conciliation in accordance with the provisions of this Article.\n\n(b)(i) The Contracting Parties listed in Annex ID do not give such unconditional consent where the Investor has previously submitted the dispute under subparagraph (2)(a) or (b)\n\n(ii) For the sake of transparency, each Contracting Party that is listed in Annex ID shall provide a written statement of its policies, practices and conditions in this regard to the Secretariat no later than the date of the deposit of its instrument of ratification, acceptance or approval in accordance with Article 39 or the deposit of its instrument of accession in accordance with Article 41.\n\n**7. APPLICABLE LAW**\n---------------------\n\n**7.1 Claimants\u2019 Applicable Law Arguments as Presented in the Memorial**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n7.1.1.\n\nOn 7 March 2008, Claimants filed their Memorial, asserting that the law applicable to the dispute was found in Article 26(6) of the ECT, which provides that \"[a] tribunal established under paragraph (4) [referring to ICSID arbitration] shall decide the issues in dispute in accordance with this Treaty and applicable rules and principles of international law.\" This was not further developed.\n\n**7.2 Respondent\u2019s Applicable Law Arguments as presented in the Counter-Memorial**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n7.2.1.\n\nIn its CounterMemorial, Respondent highlighted the inconveniences and the negative consequences of a ruling under the ECT, which, in its opinion, requires Hungary to act inconsistently with mandatory laws of the EU.\n\n7.2.2.\n\nIt is Hungary\u2019s contention that the ECT must be read in light of one of its own objectives, which is to promote the European Union\u2019s key energy objectives, market liberalization and free competition, and not as if it was entirely independent of critical EU laws and developments.\n\n7.2.3.\n\nConsequently, Hungary states that \"it defies logic to suggest, as Claimants do, that the ECT can be read as entirely divorced from EC competition law.\" It argues that when a state has obligations under two different treaties involving overlapping subject matter, those obligations should - to the extent possible - be read in harmony and be interpreted to minimize conflict.\n\n7.2.4.\n\nIn addition, Respondent says that the fact that Claimants\u2019 2001 PPA was governed by the law of Hungary, now an EU member state, further underscores the need to take European Community (\"EC\") competition law into account in determining whether any modification of the 2001 PPA transgressed the limits set forth in the ECT. Hungary relies on part of a text that Bernard Hanotiau wrote in 1995 which states that: \"if the applicable law... is the law of a state of the European Union, such law includes the rules of Community law, and these rules should therefore be applied...\"\n\n7.2.5.\n\nFinally, Hungary alleges that there is no true conflict between the provisions of the ECT and the mandatory public policy reflected in the EC competition law (incorporated in Hungarian law governing the 2001 PPA), because:\n\n\"Accepting the notion that \"legitimate expectations\" is the bedrock on which many of the ECT\u2019s investor-protection provisions rest, this notion fully supports a finding that Hungary honored its commitments. As set forth below, Claimants could have had no \"legitimate\" expectation that Hungary would blithely ignore EC demands to minimize or eliminate prohibited State aid. Nor could they legitimately expect that Hungary would never consider, as a rational vehicle for addressing these concerns, the temporary reintroduction of administrative price controls, predicated on the very notions of \"reasonable return\" upon which Claimants originally invested.\"\n\n**7.3 Claimants\u2019 Applicable Law Arguments as Presented in the Reply**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n7.3.1.\n\nOn 31 October 2008, the Claimants filed their Reply. There, they stated that the parties to this arbitration made a clear choice as to the applicable law and that choice does not include Community competition law or Hungarian law. They argue that the applicable law will only be the ECT and applicable rules and principles of international law under article 26(6) of the ECT. The law applicable to the merits of this ICSID proceeding is governed by Article 42(1) of the ICSID Convention and, thus, by Article 26(6) of the ECT.\n\n7.3.2.\n\nThe Claimants say that Community law is irrelevant to the interpretation of the ECT, and that assertions to the contrary ignore the basic principles of treaty interpretation.\n\n7.3.3.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, this is so because the ECT is to be interpreted in accordance with customary international law as codified in the Vienna Convention, Articles 31 and 32. They maintain that the principles set out in the Vienna Convention require that the ECT \"be interpreted in accordance with the Law of Nations, and not any municipal code.\"\n\n7.3.4.\n\nThis is also said to be so given that Community law, including Community competition law, is considered the equivalent of internal or municipal law for the purposes of this proceeding. Community law is thus merely a fact to be considered by the Tribunal when determining the applicable law.\n\n7.3.5.\n\nClaimants state that Respondent argues that, under Article 32 of the Vienna Convention, there is some unidentified provision of the ECT which is either ambiguous or absurd, and therefore recourse should be had to supplementary means of interpretation, including the preparatory work or the circumstances surrounding the conclusion of the ECT. Nevertheless, in their opinion, Hungary fails to point to any specific provision of the ECT which it believes to be ambiguous or absurd.\n\n7.3.6.\n\nIn addition, Claimants argue that the ECT was not solely a European initiative, because Russia, Canada, USA, Japan, and other countries were each heavily involved in its inception.\n\n7.3.7.\n\nClaimants also mention that their \"legitimate expectations\" are irrelevant to the interpretation of the ECT and they underscore that Hungary did not identify any provision of either the Vienna Convention or customary international law which suggests that this Tribunal should interpret the ECT by reference to the expectations of an investor.\n\n7.3.8.\n\nClaimants further claim that Community law is not a defence to Hungary\u2019s breaches of the ECT, because Article 27 of the Vienna Convention provides that a \"Party may not invoke the provisions of its internal law as justifications for its failure to perform a treaty.\"\n\n7.3.9.\n\nRegarding Respondent\u2019s alleged \"conflict\" between Community Law and the ECT, Claimants posit that the EC is a signatory to the ECT and is thus bound by its provisions, including those as to the choice of law. Claimants conclude that it is clear that the \"EC institutions are bound by the provisions of an international treaty concluded by the EC, and that all acts of those institutions should comply with such treaties.\"\n\n7.3.10.\n\nClaimants point out that despite not articulating any legal basis for its Community competition law defence, and despite the established legal principle that a state cannot invoke its own internal law as a defence to its violations of international law, Hungary suggests that any finding by this Tribunal that Hungary should be held accountable for its violations of international law would \"seriously undermine the integrity of EC State aid law.\"\n\n7.3.11.\n\nIn answer to this point, Claimants assert that Respondent\u2019s argument ignores the parties\u2019 express choice of law in Article 26(6) and the provisions of the ECT on investor protection that flow, automatically, from that choice.\n\n7.3.12.\n\nFurthermore, Claimants say that the ECT has addressed this issue and determined that, while the notion of state aid covers all aid granted by a member state to undertakings which might have the effect of distorting trade, it is fundamentally different in its legal nature from the damages which Hungary may have to pay as a result of this arbitration.\n\n7.3.13.\n\nIn their view, all Community institutions, including the Commission, must, as a matter of Community law, respect any award issued by this Tribunal.\n\n7.3.14.\n\nClaimants\u2019 conclusion is that Hungary\u2019s alleged \"circularity\" problem does not exist as a matter of fact or as a matter of Community law, and that the alleged \"circularity\" problem has been invented by Hungary in an effort to avoid responsibility for its internationally wrongful acts. The Eeckhout Report confirms that this is the case.\n\n**7.4 Respondent\u2019s Applicable Law Arguments as Presented in the Rejoinder**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n7.4.1.\n\nOn 13 February 2009, Hungary filed its Rejoinder and clarified that it never contended, as Claimants asserted, that EC law rather than the ECT governs this arbitration. Hungary insists that it has always acknowledged that the ECT supplies the decisional standards that this Tribunal must apply. But it argues that in applying these standards, the EC law framework as well as the illegality of the 2001 PPA under Hungarian law have to be considered as facts.\n\n7.4.2.\n\nThe Respondent notes that Claimants themselves admitted that issues of national law are frequently factual predicates for the application of ECT decisional standards.\n\n7.4.3.\n\nConsequently, the Respondent concludes that there is thus no real dispute between the parties on this issue.\n\n**7.5 Arguments Expressed During the Hearing**\n----------------------------------------------\n\n7.5.1.\n\nDuring the hearing, Claimants argued (on 9 March 2009) that Hungary had retreated from its previous position as set out in the Counter-Memorial, and thus that this Tribunal no longer had to determine the conflict regarding the applicable law (Transcript, p. 170:5-8). Claimants further asserted that there is \"no dispute between the parties that the ECT is the applicable law\" (Transcript, page 346:8).\n\n7.5.2.\n\nDuring the hearing (on 13 March 2009), both parties and experts agreed that:\n\n(a) the ECT was the applicable law;\n\n(b) the EC law is relevant as a fact (Transcript, Slot: p. 1469: 8-11), (Transcript, Eeckhout: p. 1415: 6-9).\n\n7.5.3.\n\nEven though there was a consensus between the parties that the ECT is the applicable law to this dispute, and that the EC law is to be taken into account as a relevant fact, the parties maintained different interpretations regarding the following issues:\n\n(a) should the ECT be interpreted due to ambiguous provisions? And, in such case, should the interpretation method be a historical interpretation of the formation of the ECT, or the Vienna Convention?\n\n(b) does Article 16 of the ECT apply to this dispute?\n\n(c) should Article 307 of the EC Treaty be applied to this dispute?\n\n***Interpretation of the ECT***\n-------------------------------\n\n7.5.4.\n\nThe Respondent alleged that the ECT should be interpreted using a historical method that takes into account the formation of the ECT, and therefore the EC law principles. Claimants disagreed, stating that any interpretation of the ECT had to be made in accordance with the Vienna Convention.\n\n***Application of Article 16 of the ECT***\n------------------------------------------\n\n7.5.5.\n\nClaimants also noted that the Respondent failed to make reference to Article 16 of the ECT, which states that if there is a conflict between the ECT and any other treaty which deals with the subject matter of ECT Part III or Part V, then according to the law expressly chosen by the parties, the provisions which are more favourable to the investor or the investment prevail. The Respondent denied that Article 16 of the ECT was applicable to the dispute.20\n\nRespondent\u2019s post-hearing submission, \u00b6 95.\n\n***Application of Article 307 of the EC Treaty***\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n7.5.6.\n\nDuring the hearing, Claimants\u2019 expert Professor Eeckhout stated that, in his opinion, Article 307 of the EC Treaty is a \"crucial provision which enables member states to honor international obligations under an agreement they signed and concluded before joining the European community, and that insofar as there are those obligations, Article 307 of the EC Treaty authorized Hungary to ignore the Commission\u2019s order for the benefit of a EU member state company.\"21\n\nTranscript, p. 1422: 1-6\n\n7.5.7.\n\nFor its part, Respondent argued that as the admitted purpose of Article 307 was to protect non-member states, Article 307 of the EC Treaty should be read as authorizing Hungary to ignore the Commission\u2019s binding order for the benefit of an EU member state company \"even though AES\u2019s home state (from which its ECT rights derive) by no means could be deemed a beneficiary of Article 307.\"22\n\nRespondent\u2019s post-hearing submission, \u00b6 96.\n\n**7.6 Findings of the Tribunal**\n--------------------------------\n\n7.6.1.\n\nArticle 41(2) of the ICSID Convention provides that this Tribunal shall decide the dispute \"in accordance with such rules of law as may be agreed by the parties.\"\n\n7.6.2.\n\nArticle 26(6) of the ECT provides that \"a tribunal established under paragraph (4) shall decide the issue in dispute in accordance with this Treaty [ECT] and applicable rules and principles of international law.\"\n\n7.6.3.\n\nGiven that this Tribunal is established under paragraph (4) of Article 26 of the ECT, it is Article 26(6) of the ECT which contains the rules of law agreed by the parties and the ones that this Tribunal will use to decide the dispute.\n\n7.6.4.\n\nWe therefore conclude that the applicable law to this proceeding is the ECT, together with the applicable rules and principles of international law.\n\n***Interpretation of the ECT***\n-------------------------------\n\n7.6.5.\n\nIf interpretation of the ECT is required, the general rules of interpretation of the Vienna Convention, established in its Articles 31 and 32 should be applied. Although Article 32 provides for the use of historical interpretation, the Tribunal notes that such use is only as a complementary method of interpretation.\n\n7.6.6.\n\nRegarding the Community competition law regime, it has a dual nature: on the one hand, it is an international law regime, on the other hand, once introduced in the national legal orders, it is part of these legal orders. It is common ground that in an international arbitration, national laws are to be considered as facts. Both parties having pleading that the Community competition law regime should be considered as a fact, it will be considered by this Tribunal as a fact, always taking into account that a state may not invoke its domestic law as an excuse for alleged breaches of its international obligations.\n\n***Application of Article 16 of the ECT***\n------------------------------------------\n\n7.6.7.\n\nThe Tribunal observes that the application of Article 16 of the ECT only requires to be analyzed in the event the ECT contains a provision that conflicts with EC law. In the case of any conflict that is said to exist between the ECT and Community law, the relevant provision is Article 16 of the ECT:\n\n\"Where two or more Contracting Parties have entered into a prior international agreement, or enter into a subsequent international agreement, whose terms in either case concern the subject matter of Part III or V of this Treaty,\n\n(1) nothing in Part III or V of this Treaty shall be construed to derogate from any provision of such terms of the other agreement or from any right to dispute resolution with respect thereto under that agreement; and\n\n(2) nothing in such terms of the other agreement shall be construed to derogate from any provision of Part III or V of this Treaty or from any right to dispute resolution with respect thereto under this Treaty, where any such provision is more favourable to the Investor or Investment.\"\n\n7.6.8.\n\nHowever, the Tribunal concludes that, properly understood, the dispute under analysis in the present arbitration is not about a conflict between the EC Treaty or Community competition law and the ECT.\n\n7.6.9.\n\nRather, the dispute is about the conformity or non-conformity of Hungary\u2019s acts and measures with the ECT. Therefore, it is the behaviour of the state (the introduction by Hungary of the Price Decrees) which must be analyzed in light of the ECT, to determine whether the measures, or the manner in which they were introduced, violated the Treaty. The question of whether Hungary was, may have been, or may have felt obliged under EC law to act as it did, is only an element to be considered by this Tribunal when determining the \"rationality,\" \"reasonableness,\" \"arbitrariness\" and \"transparency\" of the reintroduction of administrative pricing and the Price Decrees.\n\n***Application of Article 307 of the EC Treaty***\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n7.6.10.\n\nFinally, the Tribunal concludes that Article 307 of the EC Treaty is not applicable, as such, in this arbitration. Article 307 (ex Article 234) states:\n\n\"The rights and obligations arising from agreements concluded before 1 January 1958 or, for acceding States, before the date of their accession, between one or more Member States on the one hand, and one or more third countries on the other, shall not be affected by the provisions of this Treaty.\n\nTo the extent that such agreements are not compatible with this Treaty, the Member State or States concerned shall take all appropriate steps to eliminate the incompatibilities established. Member States shall, where necessary, assist each other to this end and shall, where appropriate, adopt a common attitude.\n\nIn applying the agreements referred to in the first paragraph, Member States shall take into account the fact that the advantages accorded under this Treaty by each Member State form an integral part of the establishment of the Community and are thereby inseparably linked with the creation of common institutions, the conferring of powers upon them and the granting of the same advantages by all the other Member States.\"\n\n7.6.11.\n\nArticle 307 only applies to agreements between member states and non-member states, and Hungary and the United Kingdom are both member states. Moreover, the Claimants are not states, and even if sometimes individuals are granted rights under international law, Article 307 of the EC Treaty specifies that it only applies to states.\n\n7.6.12.\n\nIn summary, the Tribunal determines that the Respondent\u2019s acts/measures are to be assessed under the ECT as the applicable law but that the EC law is to be considered and taken into account as a relevant fact.\n\n**8. THE TRIBUNAL\u2019S APPROACH TO THE SUBSTANTIVE CLAIMS**\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n8.1.\n\nThe Tribunal starts its analysis of the substantive issues before it by dealing first, in Section 9 below, with Hungary\u2019s obligation to provide fair and equitable treatment to Claimants and their investment(s). This is followed, successively, by the Tribunal\u2019s analysis of Claimants\u2019 claim regarding unreasonable and discriminatory measures (Section 10), national treatment (Section 11), most favoured nation treatment (Section 12), constant protection and security (Section 13), and, finally expropriation (Section 14).\n\n8.2.\n\nIn addressing each claim, the Tribunal summarizes briefly the scope of Claimants\u2019 and Respondent\u2019s positions as advanced in their initial pleadings, written memorials, during the course of oral argument and in their written post-hearing submissions. The Tribunal also acknowledges the efforts made by the European Commission to explain its own position to the Tribunal and has duly considered the points developed in its *amicus curiae* brief in its deliberations. After having thus thoroughly examined the whole file, the Tribunal presents its analyses and conclusions.\n\n**9. OBLIGATION TO PROVIDE FAIR AND EQUITABLE TREATMENT**\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n**9.1 Claimants\u2019 Position**\n---------------------------\n\n9.1.1.\n\nRegarding the obligation of Hungary to provide fair and equitable treatment, the Claimants advance four main arguments which are summarized under the relevant descriptive headings below.\n\n***Contractual Obligations***\n-----------------------------\n\n9.1.2.\n\nThe Claimants state that the obligation of Hungary to provide fair and equitable treatment includes the obligation of honouring contractual obligations, upon which the investor reasonably relied.23 These are said to include promises by Hungary \"not to interfere with Claimants\u2019 PPA,\" \"not to frustrate...[the 2001 Settlement Agreement\u2019s] purposes and intent\" and to require another overall price and cost review prior to the introduction of any new pricing mechanism.24\n\nIn order to support this claim, Claimants mention that: a) in *CME v. Czech Republic**,* the Tribunal found that the breach of legal security of contract rights underpinned the Claimants\u2019 investment; b) Schreuer has maintained that \" *a willful refusal by a government authority to abide* *by its* *contractual obligations, abuse of government authority to evade agreements with foreign investors and action in bad faith in the course of contractual performance may well lead to a finding that the Standard of fair and equitable treatment has been breached\"',* and c) in the *CMS v. Argentina* case, the Tribunal considered that the fair and equitable treatment standard was violated when the state put a freeze on contractually agreed tariff adjustments intended to increase gas prices. Claimants\u2019 Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 200-204.\n\nClaimants\u2019 post-hearing submission, \u00b6\u00b6 101-103.\n\n9.1.3.\n\nSpecifically, Claimants allege that with the March 2006 amendment of the 2001 Electricity Act and the introduction of the 2006 and 2007 Price Decrees, Hungary caused and encouraged MVM to refuse to fulfill its contractual commitments to AES Tisza under the 2001 PPA, and refused to fulfill its own contractual obligations to the Claimants as set out in the 2001 Settlement Agreement.25\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 215\n\n***Breach of the Obligation to Act in Good Faith and to Respect Legitimate Expectations***\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n9.1.4.\n\nClaimants argue that, by amending the 2001 Electricity Act in 2006 and by introducing the Price Decrees, Hungary failed to act in good faith and in accordance with the basic and legitimate expectations (described above) upon which the Claimants relied when making their investments in Hungary in 1996 and following the 2001 Settlement Agreement and the execution of the 2001 PPA.\n\n***Stability and Predictability of Business***\n----------------------------------------------\n\n9.1.5.\n\nClaimants say that Hungary agreed to provide a certain level of financial and legal stability to the Claimants\u2019 investment by way of the 2001 PPA. The ECT also expressly requires Hungary to provide \"stable, equitable, favourable and transparent conditions\" for Claimants\u2019 investment.26 But Claimants argue that the promised stability was short-lived, as the organs of the state began accusing AES of earning luxury profits and tried to force a re-negotiation of the PPA, and the Hungarian parliament finally amended the 2001 Electricity Act which would reintroduce administrative pricing. This action eviscerated the legal framework upon which the Claimants had legitimately relied.27\n\nExhibit C-l, Article 10(1).\n\nClaimants note that in *Metalclad* and in *Tecmed,* the Tribunals found that stability and predictability of business framework was an accepted element of the fair and equitable standard. Memorial, \u00b6 202.\n\n***The Reintroduction of the Price Decrees was Arbitrary, Non-Transparent and Lacking in Due Process***\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n9.1.6.\n\nClaimants also contend that Hungary\u2019s conduct was non-transparent, arbitrary, lacking in due process, and discriminatory.28\n\nIn order to support this claim, Claimants mention that: a) the *Tecmed* Tribunal resolved that \"the foreign investor expects the host state to act in a consistent manner, free from ambiguity and totally transparently in its relations with the foreign investor\"; b) in *Maffezini v. Spain**,* the Tribunal said that \"the lack of transparency with which this loan transaction was conducted is incompatible with Spain\u2019s commitment to ensure the investor a fair and equitable treatment in accordance with Article 4(1) of the same treaty. Accordingly, the Tribunal finds that, with regard to this contention, the claimant has substantiated his claim and is entitled to compensation..and c) the Tribunal in *Waste Management* determined that the lack of due process may be a \"manifest failure of natural justice in judicial proceedings or a complete lack of transparency and candor in an administrative process.\" Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 205-208.\n\n9.1.7.\n\nIn support of this claim, they argue that the 2006 Electricity Act Amendment was adopted for purely political reasons (arising out of the political debate about the generators\u2019 \"excessive\" and \"intolerable\" profits), and was aimed specifically at reducing the profits being earned by generators such as AES Tisza. Claimants note that even minister Kokka acknowledged that it was a measure that would \"effect centralization or take over by the state.\"\n\n9.1.8.\n\nIn addition, Claimants allege that the manner in which the Price Decrees were issued demonstrates a lack of transparency, lack of due process and inherent arbitrariness in Hungary\u2019s actions.\n\n9.1.9.\n\nClaimants point out that the maximum profit figure of 7.1% set forth by the HEO was based on the profit figure used for distribution companies, which bears no rational relationship to generation companies.\n\n9.1.10.\n\nMoreover, the HEO gave no explanation as to how it actually arrived at the prices set out in the Price Decrees. Unlike previous administrative prices, AES Tisza was given no opportunity to comment on the prices before the Price Decrees were issued. Hungary is also said to have demanded that Claimants comment on the draft language of the draft Price Decrees within four business days, and on the language of the Price Decrees themselves within one business day.29 And Hungary failed to perform a costs and assets\u2019 review prior to issuing the Price Decrees.\n\nClaimants\u2019 post-hearing submission, \u00b6\u00b6 84-86.\n\n**9.2 Respondent\u2019s Position**\n-----------------------------\n\n9.2.1.\n\nHungary\u2019s defence may be summarized as follows:\n\n(a) Claimants can have had no legitimate expectations that administered prices would not be reintroduced;\n\n(b) Hungary\u2019s decision to do so was neither arbitrary, nor an abuse of state power;\n\n(c) Hungary\u2019s dealing with Claimants prior to the decision to reintroduce administered pricing were both reasonable and in good faith having regard to the concerns being expressed in various quarters about the generators\u2019 PPAs;\n\n(d) there were no due process failings (*i.e.,* there was nothing arbitrary or unfair in HEO\u2019s methodology or its procedures) which led to the adoption of the Price Decrees themselves.\n\n***Legitimate Expectations***\n-----------------------------\n\n9.2.2.\n\nHungary says that Claimants invested originally in the full expectation of administrative price regulation. Even though Claimants rely on the 2001 expectations, the expectations that should count are the ones that Claimants had at the moment of deciding to make the investment, which was in 1996.\n\n9.2.3.\n\nHungary accepts that there were limitations on the future regulation, *i.e.,* (a) prices would be set at levels sufficient to provide a \"reasonable return\" on investment; and (b) returns of 8% on equity had been targeted, but it was understood that this figure might change.\n\n9.2.4.\n\nFor these reasons, Hungary contends that no legitimate expectations were created that administrative prices would never be reintroduced. Hungary points out that, in their submission to the EC, Claimants themselves stated that the price controls were simply \"suspended for a brief interlude\" commencing 1 January 2004.\n\n9.2.5.\n\nIn order for legitimate expectations to exist, Hungary says that two elements are necessary:\n\n(a) the existence of government representations and assurances. In this regard, Hungary maintains that the 2001 Settlement Agreement mentioned nothing in connection with prices and that although the 2001 PPA contained a pricing schedule for when the regulatory prices regime ended, it contained no representations by MVM or anyone else that the pricing regime would never change again in the future; and\n\n(b) the reliance of the investor on such assurances to make its investment. Hungary claims that the fact that clause 3.7 of the 2001 PPA referred to a change in the law shows that the investor knew that there could be changes as regards regulatory pricing, amongst other changes in the law.\n\n9.2.6.\n\nHungary accepts that \"[a]s of 2001, based on the new 2001 Electricity Act, it did appear that administrative price caps would be phased out beginning 2004.\"30 However, it says that this did not create legitimate expectations because those were created in 1996 and not in 2001.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 125.\n\n9.2.7.\n\nBut even if expectations could have been created by the 2001 PPA, in the absence of stability agreement or the like *(e.g,* an undertaking that the government would never again regulate prices), Claimants could have had no such legitimate expectation in 2001.\n\n9.2.8.\n\nHungary argues that even if new \"expectations\" were created, this did not create objective rights because the expectations were not \"legitimate.\" In order for the expectations to be legitimate, they have to be based on affirmative government representations or assurances and these were not made. Some tribunals say that the investor\u2019s expectations are legitimate if the investor received an explicit promise or guaranty from the host state.31\n\nHungary refers to the *Saluka* case and says \"that the tribunal found that regulatory changes, if not discriminatorily applied, would not amount to a fair and equitable treatment violation.\" Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 326.\n\n***No Abusive or Arbitrary Behaviour***\n---------------------------------------\n\n9.2.9.\n\nHungary says that, in the absence of legitimate expectations, only \"manifestly arbitrary conduct\" or the \"abuse of state power\" can provoke a violation of the fair and equitable treatment obligation.\n\n9.2.10.\n\nHungary contends that its decision temporarily to restore administrative pricing was neither arbitrary nor an abuse of state power. It places special emphasis on the fact that countries which are in the process of becoming members of the European Community are likely to have legislative changes.\n\n9.2.11.\n\nHungary further says that Claimants did not show that the temporary reintroduction of administrative price caps was either an abuse of state power or manifestly arbitrary.\n\n9.2.12.\n\nHungary points out that Claimants submitted no expert opinion on Hungarian law regarding the power of the state to regulate maximum prices.\n\n9.2.13.\n\nRegarding Claimants assertion that the Price Decrees were enacted for \"purely political reasons\" and without any \"rational public policy\" objective of the state, Hungary notes that the generators\u2019 PPAs had been a concern to Hungary since 2002 and that \"it was under serious pressure from the EC to take action at least to minimize the effects of what the EC considered to be unlawful state aid, if not to terminate the PPAs outright. In these circumstances, it tried to increase the pressure on the generators (including AES Tisza) to renegotiate the PPAs. Hungary insists on the fact that AES Tisza refused any renegotiation of the PPA which created great difficulties for Hungary in its endeavour to develop a free market, in line with the European Community standards. When the authorities were unable to renegotiate the PPAs, they took the next step, which was the least drastic of the alternatives available. They temporarily restored the system of administrative price caps, based on notions of reasonable return that had long been used in Hungary.\n\n9.2.14.\n\nHungary responds to Claimants\u2019 argument, that the expiration of the 2007 Price Decrees demonstrates that it \"could not have been related to any rational policy goal,\" by stating that, to the contrary, there were rational and legal reasons why administrative price regulation could not be continued in 2008, because it was contrary to the notion of full liberalization which had been introduced by the 2001 Electricity Act and which entered into effect on 1 January 2008. Hungary had also become legitimately concerned about the profit levels generators enjoyed under noncompetitive PPAs, at the expense of consumers, as well as by the failure of generators to agree to any reductions in contracted PPA capacity, to free up electricity for direct sale to the parallel free market. These were thus transitional measures, put in place while Hungary sought to negotiate with the generators to find alternative commercial arrangements that would meet the EC\u2019s competition law concerns and address its own political issues.\n\n***Dealings were Reasonable and in Good Faith***\n------------------------------------------------\n\n9.2.15.\n\nAs regards Claimants allegation that Hungary threatened AES Tisza to terminate the PPA, Hungary contends that Hungarian officials were simply acknowledging what the EC had indicated, that there was a possibility that the PPAs would have to be terminated.\n\n9.2.16.\n\nHungary did not violate fair and equitable treatment in its consultations with Claimants. Hungary says that Claimants equate a notion of a failure to act in good faith with Hungary\u2019s unwillingness to capitulate to Claimants\u2019 unilateral demands that they receive the full value of PPA pricing, notwithstanding the EC\u2019s condemnation of that pricing as illegal state aid. In fact, Hungary argues, it was Claimants who acted unreasonably in the negotiations which preceded the reintroduction of administered pricing, by refusing even to acknowledge the new realities imposed by the EC's position and by market liberalization.\n\n***Due Process Observed in Implementing Price Regulation***\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n9.2.17.\n\nHungary asserts that neither HEO\u2019s methodology and procedures for implementing maximum prices, nor the resulting prices were arbitrary or irrational.\n\n9.2.18.\n\nAccording to Hungary, no \"due process\" or transparency rights were violated because, even though Claimants allege that there was no explanation as to how the HEO actually arrived at the prices set out in the Price Decrees, AES Tisza was well aware that the HEO was planning to use the 7.1% profit level as the target for determining appropriate prices, and knew that the HEO had drawn that figure from the level used to set maximum prices for distribution companies.\n\n9.2.19.\n\nHungary argues that the 7.1% rate of return on assets is comparable to the 8% return on equity target in place at the time of privatization, particularly given the fact that return on assets is a more favorable measure than return on equity. It also contends that there was nothing wrong in applying the same Weighted Average Cost of Capital (\"WACC\") calculation to different players in the regulated electricity market. Hungary says that, according to Navigant\u2019s report, AES Tisza could have paid all its debt prior to 2007.\n\n9.2.20.\n\nAs to Claimants\u2019 allegation that, unlike in previous administrative price cycles, AES Tisza was given no opportunity to comment on the prices set out in the Price Decrees before they were issued, Hungary responds that Claimants were invited to comment on the appropriateness of this approach, and did so, in November 2005 and in May 2006.\n\n9.2.21.\n\nIn addition, Hungary says that, as Dr. Fazekas discusses in her expert report, the obligation of the state to address petitions for review of individual price levels arises only after their publication and not prior to it and that AES Tisza did not submit any request for price review during 2006 and 2007. In addition, Hungary recalls that Dr. Fazekas also said that the AAP (administrative proceeding) rules do not apply because it is a lawmaking function and not an administrative case or proceeding.\n\n9.2.22.\n\nHungary argues that even if the Tribunal finds that there were imperfections in the execution of the state\u2019s obligation of transparency, this is not enough to determine that a violation of fair and equitable treatment occurred.32\n\nHungary notes that in the *Eastern Sugar* case, the Tribunal stated that an investment treaty may not be invoked \"each time the law is flawed or not fully and properly implemented by a State,\" otherwise \"every aspect of any legislation or its implementations could be brought before an international arbitral tribunal under the guise of a violation of a BIT.\" Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 359.\n\n9.2.23.\n\nIn connection with a state\u2019s obligation to act in a transparent manner, Claimants maintain that the ECT imposes its own transparency obligations, separate and apart from the requirements of national law. In this regard, Hungary says that Article 10(1) does not impose a particularly high threshold for transparency.33\n\nHungary indicates that \"As Thomas W\u00e4lde has explained, \"[t]he general investment standards under Article 10(1)... need to be specified and applied in light of Article 20(2),\" which is the ECT\u2019s specific provision on transparency. This imposes a \"relatively toothless obligation,\" requiring only that States promptly publish laws and regulations affecting investments.\" Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 360.\n\n9.2.24.\n\nHungary also says that the general investment treaty jurisprudence does not require states to comply with ideal notions of transparency, in which every single consideration in policy making is first publicly announced.\n\n**9.3 Findings of the Tribunal**\n--------------------------------\n\n***Findings Concerning Contractual Obligations***\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n9.3.1.\n\nThe Tribunal makes it clear at the outset that it only has jurisdiction over Treaty claims. In connection with the alleged breach of contractual rights and consequently the violation of fair and equitable treatment obligation, the Tribunal considers that it cannot hear this claim as such.\n\n9.3.2.\n\nIt is true that Article 26 of the ECT contains an umbrella clause which allows the submission to international arbitration of disputes concerning an alleged breach of an obligation under Part III of the Treaty. Specifically the last sentence of Article 10(1) - which is contained in Part III of the ECT - establishes that \"[e]ach Contracting Party shall observe any obligations it has entered into with an Investor or an Investment of an Investor of any other Contracting Party.\"\n\n9.3.3.\n\nHowever, Annex IA of the ECT contains a List of Contracting Parties, which includes Hungary, which do not allow an Investor or Contracting Party to submit a dispute concerning the last sentence of Article 10(1) to international arbitration.34\n\nCounter-Memorial, footnote 561; Memorial, footnote 222.\n\n9.3.4.\n\nTherefore, this Tribunal cannot rule on the scope of contract obligations and consequently cannot determine if the Claimants\u2019 contract rights under the 2001 Settlement Agreement - and the 2001 PPA - were eviscerated because it has no jurisdiction to do so.\n\n9.3.5.\n\nNonetheless, the Tribunal considers that it has the right and duty to determine whether Hungary\u2019s conduct - which include acts that could have breached contractual obligations - violated a specific Treaty obligation. In making this assessment, the Tribunal should not be considered to be analyzing the performance of contractual obligations as such.\n\n***Findings Concerning Legitimate Expectations***\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n9.3.6.\n\nIn connection with the reintroduction of administrative prices in 2006 and 2007, and the context in which such reintroduction took place, Claimants allege a breach of the basic and legitimate expectations upon which they relied when making their investment and consequently a violation of the fair and equitable treatment standard.\n\n9.3.7.\n\nAs stated above, the Respondent argues that no new expectations could be created in 2001 due to the fact that the original investment was made in 1996, and that legitimate expectations can only be created at the moment of the investment, which, in its eyes, was 1996.\n\n9.3.8.\n\nThis rule that legitimate expectations can only be created at the moment of the investment, has been supported by several ICSID tribunals (for example: *Duke Energy Electroquil Partners and Electroquil S.A. v. Republic of Ecuador* (ICSID Case No. ARB/04/19), Award, Aug. 18, 2008, \u00b6 340; *T\u00e9cnicas Medioambientales Tecmed, S.A. v. United Mexican States* (ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/00/2), Award, May 29, 2003, \u00b6 154 and *LG&E Energy Corp., LG&E Capital Corp. and LG&E International Inc. v. Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/02/1), Decision on Liability, Oct. 6, 2006).\n\n9.3.9.\n\nIn *Duke Energy,* the Tribunal stated that \"[t]o be protected, the investor\u2019s expectations must be legitimate and reasonable at the time when the investor makes the investment.\"\n\n9.3.10.\n\nThe above interpretation was confirmed by the *Tecmed* Tribunal, which concluded that \"this provision of the Agreement, in light of the good faith principle established by international law, requires the Contracting Parties to provide to international investments treatment that does not affect the basic expectations that were taken into account by the foreign investor to make the investment.\"\n\n9.3.11.\n\nThe *LG&E* Tribunal determined that \"[i]n addition to the state\u2019s obligation to provide a stable legal and business environment, the fair and equitable treatment analysis involves consideration of the investor\u2019s expectations when making its investment in reliance on the protections to be granted by the host state.\"\n\n9.3.12.\n\nIndeed, several other tribunals have established, as quoted above, that the expectations can only be created at the time of the investment. Nevertheless, the interpretation of \"time of the investment\" has been quite broad. For example, in *CMS Gas Transmission Company v. Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/01/8), the Tribunal held that it is the time when \"the investment was decided and made.\" (Award, May 12, 2005, \u00b6 275).\n\n9.3.13.\n\nAs an initial question, this Tribunal therefore has to determine whether Claimants\u2019 investment(s) was/were decided and made in 1996, at the time AES Summit purchased the outstanding shares of Tiszai Er\u00f6m\u00fc R\u00e9szv\u00e9nyt\u00e1rsas\u00e1g (now AES Tisza), and/or in 2001, at the time AES Tisza actually began to invest in (spend money on) the Retrofit of the Tisza II plant.\n\n9.3.14.\n\nDealing first with the 1996 PPA, there is no question that AES Summit made an investment in Hungary at that time. Accordingly, it is proper to consider whether it had legitimate expectations at that time, with which Hungary has wrongfully interfered.\n\n9.3.15.\n\nAs to that question, the Tribunal concludes that AES Summit can have had no legitimate expectation at that time regarding the conduct of Hungary about which it now complains *(i.e.,* the fact of, motivation for and methodology relating to the reintroduction of administrative pricing in 2006/2007). Both the privatization materials and the relevant investment agreements (the Original Tisza II PPA and the 1996 PSA) were explicit that Hungary would continue to set maximum administrative prices for electricity sales indefinitely into the future. This was subject only to the principle that such pricing would provide a \"reasonable return\" on investment, which would \"target\" returns in the general range of 8% on equity for the first regulatory period beginning in 1997.\n\n9.3.16.\n\nTurning to the year 2001, there can also be no question that AES Tisza then and thereafter made an investment in Hungary as the term \"investment\" is defined in the Treaty. It is not contested that, between 2001 and 2005, AES Tisza spent approximately \u20ac 98 million to complete three of the four phases of the Tisza II Retrofit. It is also clear that the decision to make the investment was re-confirmed at the time of the 2001 Settlement Agreement. This fact is self-evident from the terms of the relevant agreements that were then executed.\n\n9.3.17.\n\nThe enquiry therefore turns to whether: (a) there were government representations and assurances made or given to Claimants at that time, and upon which they relied, of the sort alleged; and (b) Hungary acted in a manner contrary to such representations and assurances.\n\n9.3.18.\n\nAnd as to this, the Tribunal concludes that Hungary made no representations/gave no assurances of a nature that go to the heart of Claimants\u2019 complaint - *i.e.,* that following the termination of price administration on 31 December 2003, regulated pricing would not again be introduced.\n\n9.3.19.\n\nAs regards Claimants\u2019 reliance on statements found in the 1996 Industry Information Memorandum relating to \"an 8% return on shareholder funds\"35 and the requirement for \"another overall price and cost review\" prior to the introduction of \"any new pricing mechanism,\"36 the first was simply a target rate for a \"reasonable return\" for the first regulatory period and the second was made in the context of the HEO not expecting radical changes in Hungary\u2019s administrative pricing system. It is of course true that Hungary moved away from administrative pricing at the end of 2003 (and that this future course was known in 2001 at the time of the 2001 Settlement), but the 1996 statement simply does not relate in a sufficiently material way to Claimants\u2019 central complaint (the reintroduction of administrative pricing in 2006/2007) for the Tribunal to find that Hungary\u2019s conduct in 2006/2007 was contrary to representations and assurances said to have been made to AES Summit in 1996.\n\nExhibit C-111, pp. 102 *et seq.* and F(i).\n\nClaimants\u2019 post-hearing submission, \u00b6 101.\n\n9.3.20.\n\nAs regards Hungary\u2019s letter of 21 October 1999 from Mr. Pal Ligati (Head of Department, Ministry of Economic Affairs), which Claimants classify as an \"express promise not to interfere with Claimants\u2019 PPA,\" as well as a promise that \"the contractual pricing formula set out in the PPA would not be altered by political considerations,\"37 all that sensibly can be said is that, whatever the context of the letter (it was produced only during the hearing and never explained), it does not say what Claimants\u2019 say it does. Moreover, it predated the 2001 Tisza II PPA by approximately two years and no evidence was led to suggest that such a new PPA was then contemplated. Indeed, the letter was written immediately before Claimants commenced the PSA and Treaty arbitrations in 2000. Accordingly, the Tribunal does not consider it plausible that Claimants can be said to have relied on this assurance when, two years later, they entered into the 2001 Settlement Agreement and the 2001 Amendment Agreement.\n\nClaimants\u2019 post-hearing submission, \u00b6 102.\n\n9.3.21.\n\nThis then leaves for consideration Claimants\u2019 contention that, as a party to the 2001 Settlement Agreement, Hungary, by reason of clause 21, \"expressly promised... not to frustrate the purposes and intent\" of the agreement, which promise it breached through the reintroduction of regulated pricing which was said to be directly contrary to the object and intent of that agreement.\n\n9.3.22.\n\nAgain, the Tribunal concludes that Claimants' reliance on frustrated legitimate expectations based on clause 21 is unavailing.\n\n9.3.23.\n\nClause 21 of the 2001 Settlement Agreement provides as follows:\n\n\"Each of the Parties agrees to execute and deliver all such further instruments and documents and to do and perform all such acts and things as may be necessary and any Party may reasonably request to enable it to carry out the provisions of this Agreement and/or to effect the purposes and intent of this agreement\" (Emphasis added).\n\n9.3.24.\n\nSuch \"further acts\" clauses are commonplace in commercial agreements, including settlements. Properly construed, the plainly worded provisions of clause 21 do no more than obligate a party to the 2001 Settlement Agreement, if requested reasonably by another party, to execute and deliver specific instruments/documents or to take specific steps as may be necessary, to enable the requesting party to carry out or effect the purposes and intent of the 2001 Settlement Agreement. This does not, as alleged, constitute a specific promise by Hungary not to frustrate the purposes and intent of the 2001 Settlement Agreement by the reintroduction of administrative pricing.\n\n9.3.25.\n\nIt is also common ground that the 2001 Settlement Agreement does not contain a so-called \"stabilization clause\" - *i.e.,* a covenant not to change the relevant law, usually for a certain period. To the contrary, the 2001 Settlement Agreement introduced a \"Change in Law\" provision (clause 3.7) into the Original Tisza II PPA (or the 2001 PPA), which dealt carefully with the PPA parties\u2019 rights (including financial) should a change of law occur during the now extended term of the PPA. And \"Law,\" as defined, included all acts of the Hungarian parliament, as well as other governmental or ministerial decrees as might be issued from time to time. In the case under consideration, in 2001, there was a great probability that there would be no administrative pricing after 2004, but this does not equate to absolute certainty, giving rise to internationally protected legitimate expectations.\n\n9.3.26.\n\nIn these circumstances, the Tribunal concludes that Claimants cannot legitimately have been led by Hungary to expect that a regime of administrative pricing would not be reintroduced under any circumstances during the term of the 2001 Tisza II PPA.\n\n***Findings Concerning Stable Legal and Business Framework***\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n9.3.27.\n\nThe analysis of the duty to provide a stable legal and business framework has to be made in light of the ECT and the applicable rules and principles of international law.38\n\nArticle 26(6) ECT.\n\n9.3.28.\n\nSpecifically, article 10(1) of the ECT provides that \"each contracting Party shall, in accordance with the provisions of this Treaty, encourage and create stable... conditions for investors of other Contracting Parties...\"\n\n9.3.29.\n\nThe stable conditions that the ECT mentions relate to the framework within which the investment takes place. Nevertheless, it is not a stability clause. A legal framework is by definition subject to change as it adapts to new circumstances day by day and a state has the sovereign right to exercise its powers which include legislative acts.\n\n9.3.30.\n\nTherefore, to determine the scope of the stable conditions that a state has to encourage and create is a complex task given that it will always depend on the specific circumstances that surrounds the investor\u2019s decision to invest and the measures taken by the state in the public interest.\n\n9.3.31.\n\nIn this case, however, the Tribunal observes that no specific commitments were made by Hungary that could limit its sovereign right to change its law (such as a stability clause) or that could legitimately have made the investor believe that no change in the law would occur.39\n\nSpecifically, the 2001 Settlement Agreement and the 2001 PPA did not contemplated that after 2004 no reintroduction of regulated pricing could take place.\n\n9.3.32.\n\nMoreover, it is clear from clause 3.7 of the 2001 PPA that the parties to the agreement were aware that a change in the law could occur that could make the obligations under the agreement become illegal, unenforceable or impossible to perform.\n\n9.3.33.\n\nMechanisms were established in clause 3.7 of the 2001 PPA, which dealt with the possible actions that could be taken by the parties in the event that a change of law, as defined, occurred. Consequently, the Tribunal concludes that the investment(s) by the Claimants in 2001 and thereafter were made in the knowledge that a change in law could occur that could make the obligations of the 2001 PPA illegal, unenforceable or impossible to perform.\n\n9.3.34.\n\nIn these circumstances, absent a specific commitment from Hungary that it would not reintroduce administrative pricing during the term of the 2001 PPA, Claimants cannot properly rely on an alleged breach of Hungary\u2019s Treaty obligation to provide a stable legal environment based on the passage of Act \"V and the Price Decrees. This is because any reasonably informed business person or investor knows that laws can evolve in accordance with the perceived political or policy dictates of the times.\n\n9.3.35.\n\nThe Tribunal therefore concludes that no breach of the fair and equitable treatment standard took place based on Hungary\u2019s alleged failure to provide a stable legal and business framework.\n\n***Findings Concerning Due Process / Arbitrariness / Transparency***\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n9.3.36.\n\nIn their unfair and inequitable treatment case, Claimants rely both on the irrational and unreasonable character of Hungary\u2019s decision to reintroduce administrative pricing, as well as the arbitrary and unfair manner (failures in due process) in which the Price Decrees were issued.\n\n9.3.37.\n\nFor reasons which are set out in Section 10 below (dealing with Unreasonable and Discriminatory Measures), the Tribunal has concluded that there was nothing so irrational or otherwise unreasonable in Hungary\u2019s policy decision to reintroduce administrative prices in 2006 as would constitute a breach of its Treaty obligation to ensure that Claimants were treated fairly and equitably and that their investments were not impaired by unreasonable or discriminatory measures.\n\n9.3.38.\n\nFor this reason, the Tribunal limits its analysis here to the manner or methodology in or by which the Price Decrees were brought into force, with a view to assessing whether \"process\" failures existed which were such as would constitute a failure to provide Claimants with fair and equitable treatment.\n\n9.3.39.\n\nTo the Tribunal, this ultimately became the heart of the case, and this is why it asked the parties to address this question in detail in their post-hearing submissions.\n\n9.3.40.\n\nThe Tribunal has approached this question on the basis that it is not every process failing or imperfection that will amount to a failure to provide fair and equitable treatment. The standard is not one of perfection. It is only when a state\u2019s acts or procedural omissions are, on the facts and in the context before the adjudicator, manifestly unfair or unreasonable (such as would shock, or at least surprise a sense of juridical propriety) - to use the words of the *Tecmed* Tribunal40 - that the standard can be said to have been infringed.\n\nAward, May 29, 2003, \u00b6 154, quoting the International Court of Justice, Case: *Elettronica Sicula S.p.A. (ELSI) (United States of America v. Italy),* 128, p. 65, July 20, 1989, ICJ, General List No. 76.\n\n9.3.41.\n\nAnd for the reasons noted below, the Tribunal does not believe the process of implementing the Price Decrees was so flawed as to amount to a breach of the fair and equitable standard of the ECT.\n\n9.3.42.\n\nIn reaching this conclusion, the Tribunal was greatly assisted by the testimony offered by Gy\u00f6rgy B\u00e9k\u00e9s, the head of the Electricity Office Preparation Department of the HEO at the time. To our minds, his evidence describes a not culpably unreasonable implementation process in relation to the Price Decrees.\n\n9.3.43.\n\nIt is also to be noted that Mr. B\u00e9k\u00e9s was not cross-examined. This was, of course, Claimants\u2019 right. Mr. Jagusch made the point during the hearing that, in international arbitration, it is not necessary for a party to cross-examine a witness with whose testimony that party may disagree. While this may be so, Mr. B\u00e9k\u00e9s was not confronted by Claimants on his evidence and his relevant testimony on process also stands un-contradicted by other testimony or contrary documentation.\n\n9.3.44.\n\nTurning to the implementation process itself, Respondent\u2019s post-hearing brief provides a useful comparison of Hungary\u2019s three administrative pricing cycles for the public utility sector that bears on the issue before the Tribunal.41 Because Claimants do not fault the first two cycles, it is relevant to their allegation of procedural failings that each and every of the three cycles were somewhat similar.\n\nFirst Cycle, 1992-2000; Second Cycle, 2001-2004 (generators exempted for 2004); Third Cycle, 2005-2008 (applied to generators from December 2006-2007).\n\n9.3.45.\n\nMr. B\u00e9k\u00e9s recalled that, following the Hungarian parliament\u2019s authorization of a return to administrative pricing for generators in early March 2006, the Ministry expected a proposal for an implementing decree from HEO by the end of May, which it intended would go into effect by July 2006.\n\n9.3.46.\n\nMr. B\u00e9k\u00e9s explained that for HEO to have done a bottom up cost study in the spring of 2006, in the time frame the Ministry had in mind to issue a decree, was impractical.\n\n9.3.47.\n\nHowever, at this time, the HEO had in hand a study for 2005-2009, that indicated a 7.1% WACC for the electricity sector as a whole.42 The generators had also previously been informed, on 10 November 2005, in Mr. Horvath\u2019s (the HEO president) letter, that a 7.1% return on assets was the target.\n\nThis study had been done earlier by HEO economists to determine the appropriate figure for return on assets for the initial price calculation for the 2005-2009 pricing cycle for electricity supply and distribution companies which had remained under an administrative pricing regime for that period.\n\n9.3.48.\n\nCapping profits was the objective at this time. Thus, on 14 March 2006, HEO asked AES and other generators for their financial figures for the 2003-2005 calendar years, *i.e.,* their books. AES supplied its figures by letter, dated 30 March 2006. HEO had previously identified four generators whose returns exceeded 7.1%. It thus determined (based on the generators\u2019 own figures) by how much each generator exceeded the 7.1% return concept, and proceeded on the basis that each generator\u2019s fees would be reduced accordingly. The same methodology was then applied to all generators. Mr. B\u00e9k\u00e9s also made the point that the value of AES\u2019s post-retrofit assets were taken into account in determining the price that AES would be able to charge.\n\n9.3.49.\n\nOn 11 May 2006, the HEO sent each generator the text of the draft 2006 Price Decree, and solicited comments by 18 May 2006 on its proposed approach. (Although no specific prices were provided - this was the same approach HEO had applied in the previous two cycles).\n\n9.3.50.\n\nAES commented on 18 May 2006 in accordance with HEO\u2019s, admittedly short, deadline. It then amended its comments, four days later, on 22 May 2006. These amended comments were substantive, detailed and led to changes to the draft 2006 Price Decree.\n\n9.3.51.\n\nHEO next met AES, on 31 May 2006, to discuss possible changes to the draft 2006 Price Decree.\n\n9.3.52.\n\nOn 2 June 2006, HEO presented the draft 2006 Price Decree to the Ministry. All of the principal comments that had been received from the generators, along with HEO\u2019s preliminary views regarding these comments, were summarized in a table that HEO presented to the Ministry.\n\n9.3.53.\n\nSubsequent to HEO\u2019s initial proposal to the Ministry, several changes were made to the draft 2006 Price Decree, although the capacity fee proposed for AES Tisza II remained unchanged.\n\n9.3.54.\n\nNevertheless, one important change that was made was the elimination of the original post-hoc profit sharing provision that would have required generators to make payments to MVM, if their profits exceeded the 7.1% target.\n\n9.3.55.\n\nThis change, which was made by the Ministry in response to the objections in May 2006 from a number of the generators, including AES Tisza, provides at least a partial answer to Claimants\u2019 allegations of arbitrary behaviour by Hungary at this time. It also moved the proposed Price Decree to a price capping, not a profit capping model.\n\n9.3.56.\n\nThus, each of Hungary\u2019s three relevant pricing cycles used price caps (not a profit cap in the third cycle, as alleged by Claimants). Moreover, the prices established in the last two cycles were both based on returns on assets.\n\n9.3.57.\n\nThe so-called \"reasonable\" rate of return (of 7.1% return on assets) was also based on a WACC calculated for the electricity sector as a whole. It can therefore not be said that it bore no rational relationship to the generation companies. Generators also had the ability to exceed the target 7.1% rate of return and AES subsequently did so.\n\n9.3.58.\n\nOn 17 November 2006, AES wrote to Mr. Horvath complaining about there having been no comprehensive cost review and asserting a right to participate in a price determination process.\n\n9.3.59.\n\nThe final text of the draft Decree was adopted by the Ministry on 24 November 2006 for the 2006 year.\n\n9.3.60.\n\nHEO replied to AES\u2019s cost review complaint on 30 November 2006, expressing its position that such a cost review was not required.\n\n9.3.61.\n\nWith the 2006 Price Decree about to take effect, on 5 December 2006, HEO wrote to AES and the other generators to propose that the prices fixed for each generator for 2006 would be adjusted upward (to the same extent the relevant generator\u2019s 2007 PPA price was predicted to exceed the relevant generator\u2019s 2006 PPA price) for use in 2007. A two-day comment period was given. AES did not comment.\n\n9.3.62.\n\nThe 2006 Price Decree went into effect on 9 December 2006.\n\n9.3.63.\n\nThe 2007 Price Decree was adopted on 26 January 2007, and came into force on 1 February 2007.\n\n9.3.64.\n\nThe March 2006 amendments to the 2001 Electricity Act (that provided for the reintroduction of administrative prices) did not affect its existing provisions which allow generators to petition for individual price review. Mr. B\u00e9k\u00e9s testified that AES Tisza did not submit a request for price review during the relevant review period applicable to the Price Decrees.\n\n9.3.65.\n\nAES also had the opportunity to seek to review the process under which the Price Decrees were introduced by proceedings in the Hungarian courts, but did not do so.\n\n9.3.66.\n\nHaving regard to this uncontested procedural history, the Tribunal does not feel that the several procedural shortcomings in Hungary\u2019s implementation of the price decrees (the most obvious being the short-fused periods given by HEO on 11 May and 5 December 2006 to AES to comment on the text of the draft Price Decrees) are sufficient to constitute unfair and inequitable treatment.\n\n9.3.67.\n\nThe Tribunal was comforted in this view because HEO made it clear to the generators, not later than November 2005, that it considered a 7.1% return on assets to be an appropriate rate of return.\n\n9.3.68.\n\nThus, pre-warned as it had been, AES found it possible to respond to HEO\u2019s 11 May 2006 letter requesting comment on the draft 2006 Price Decree within the very short (in the Tribunal\u2019s view, over-short) time specified. AES did not apparently consider it necessary to seek an extension of the deadline. Moreover, it supplemented and amended its comments four days later.\n\n9.3.69.\n\nAES\u2019s 'late\u2019 amendments were not only accepted by HEO as being timely; HEO also acted on some of them. This is not conduct that can substantiate in this case allegations of such a degree of arbitrariness, a lack of transparency, or a lack of due process that amounts to unfair or inequitable treatment.\n\n9.3.70.\n\nAnd, as already indicated, the fact that HEO, following criticism from the generators, eliminated its proposed post-hoc profit sharing provision, shows that it was not behaving in an arbitrary manner. In short, while HEO\u2019s consultations with Claimants on the Prices Decrees may not have been optimal, they do not amount to a culpable \"failure to consult properly\" as alleged.\n\n9.3.71.\n\nAs regards HEO\u2019s failure to perform a costs and assets review, it is true that this was done in the case of the two previous prices cycles. Nevertheless, the Tribunal has concluded that HEO\u2019s decision not to follow this practise at this time was not unfair to AES.\n\n9.3.72.\n\nThis is because HEO accepted AES\u2019s costs as reflected in AES\u2019s 2004 and 2005 own financial statements as supplied to HEO and its return-on-assets calculations were based on the book value of assets, also as reported in AES\u2019s financial statements, precisely as it had done for the second price cycle with which Claimants have no complaint.\n\n9.3.73.\n\nIn summary, Respondent\u2019s process of introducing the Price Decrees, while sub-optional, did not fall outside the acceptable range of legislative and regulatory behaviour. That being the case, it cannot be defined as unfair and inequitable.\n\n**10. UNREASONABLE AND DISCRIMINATORY MEASURES**\n------------------------------------------------\n\n**10.1 Claimants\u2019 Position**\n----------------------------\n\n10.1.1.\n\nAs regards the Treaty\u2019s prohibition of the impairment of investments by unreasonable or discriminatory measures, Claimants say that Hungary\u2019s actions must be judged against a standard that its conduct bears a reasonable relationship to some rational policy - rationality to be assessed objectively by the Tribunal.\n\n10.1.2.\n\nTo support these claims, Claimants say that a return to regulated pricing was irrational, if it was aimed at state aid concerns, because:\n\n(a) Hungary did not believe, at the time, that there was a state aid problem;\n\n(b) there is no obligation under Community law to introduce profit caps - profitability having no direct relationship to state aid;\n\n(c) Hungary had promised to respect civil law contracts; and\n\n(d) Hungary never consulted the State Aid Monitoring Office of the Ministry of Finance (\"SAMO\"), which was the state agency responsible for dealing with state aid issues.\n\n10.1.3.\n\nOn discrimination, Claimants point to the fact that HEO\u2019s letter of 10 November 2005 was sent to just four generators, indicating that they should voluntarily give up their contractual rights and reduce their PPA prices. And when the 2006 Price Decree was issued on 24 November 2006, it affected only these four generators. Discrimination is thus evident having regard to the fact that the Commission was concerned that all generator PPAs contained state aid.\n\n**10.2 Respondent\u2019s Position**\n------------------------------\n\n10.2.1.\n\nHungary contends it is well settled that states may implement regulatory change as long as they do so for rational, non-arbitrary reasons, and that such regulatory changes do not discriminate unlawfully against a foreign investor that is protected by an applicable investment treaty.\n\n10.2.2.\n\nThe standard for examining a state\u2019s reasons for acting is not a testing one. States have a broad discretion in deciding whether and how to regulate and the burden is on the challenger to demonstrate irrationality, arbitrariness, or a lack of a reasonable relationship to some rational policy.\n\n10.2.3.\n\nAs regards Claimants\u2019 allegations that Hungary\u2019s decision to re-regulate prices was a \"money grab\" to help MVM, based on nothing more than domestic policy grandstanding about \"luxury profits,\" Hungary says that there were legitimate and inter-related reasons for temporarily reintroducing price regulation in 2006:\n\n(a) Hungary was legitimately concerned about the failure of generators to agree to negotiate any reductions in contracted PPA capacity, to free up electricity for sale to the free market;\n\n(b) Hungarian policymakers were well aware of the Commission\u2019s state aid investigations and of the Commission\u2019s concern that generator PPAs contained state aid and prevented new market entrants; and\n\n(c) the Hungarian authorities were legitimately concerned about the profit levels that some generators were enjoying under non-competitive PPAs.\n\n10.2.4.\n\nThus, Hungary says that there were rational reasons that led it to reintroduce the price regulation for a transitional period, pending full market liberalization and while awaiting the EC's Final Decision on the legality of the PPAs\u2019.\n\n10.2.5.\n\nHungary also argues that there was nothing irrational about the government\u2019s use of its right to exercise supervisory authority over generator prices by setting certain maximum levels, for generators that were not under market conditions. Moreover, the fact that the methodologies for implementing the policy evolved over the intervening decade does not suggest that the underlying policy itself was no longer rational.\n\n10.2.6.\n\nAs to Claimants\u2019 discrimination case, Hungary says that Claimants must show there was: (a) differential treatment between parties similarly situated; and (b) no justification for such differentiation.\n\n10.2.7.\n\nIn this regard, Hungary argues that Claimants cannot succeed because there was no differential treatment at all. This is because prices (and especially capacity fees) were never uniform across generators in Hungary - they were always set in relation to each power plant\u2019s underlying costs, and the generators\u2019 cost structures varied substantially. Also, Tisza Il's capacity fee had always been lower than that of other generators, whether under administrative or PPA pricing, because of its lower fixed costs.\n\n10.2.8.\n\nIn addition, Hungary maintains that price caps were set by a uniform methodology which was applied to all generators and was based on a uniform measure of reasonable return *(i.e.,* a 7.1% return on assets). It was simply the fact that each plant had a different starting point of prior returns that made the resulting price outcomes different.43\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 376.\n\n10.2.9.\n\nIn response to Claimants\u2019 allegation that only four generators were targeted and affected by the Price Decrees, Hungary relies on Mr. B\u00e9k\u00e9s\u2019s uncontradicted explanation that the HEO reviewed financial performance data for all generators and determined that only four had exceeded the identified target return of 7.1%. The fact that only those generators whose returns exceed a maximum permitted level would be affected by a price cap does not constitute unlawful discriminatory targeting.\n\n**10.3 Findings of the Tribunal**\n---------------------------------\n\n10.3.1.\n\nArticle 10(1) of the ECT provides that \"no Contracting Party shall in any way impair by unreasonable or discriminatory measure their [investment\u2019s] management, maintenance, use, enjoyment or disposal.\"\n\n10.3.2.\n\nHungary was thus obliged to avoid any impairment of Claimants\u2019 investment as a consequence of either: (a) unreasonable or (b) discriminatory measures.\n\n10.3.3.\n\nAn analysis of the nature of a state\u2019s measures, in order to determine if they are unreasonable or discriminatory, is only necessary when an impairment of the investment took place.\n\n10.3.4.\n\nIt is undisputed that, as a result of the reintroduction of the Price Decrees, Claimants received lower prices than they had been receiving pursuant to the formula set out in the 2001 PPA.\n\n10.3.5.\n\nIt follows that AES\u2019s receipt of a lower payment from MVM, whilst burdened by unchanged costs, had a detrimental impact on Claimants\u2019 investment, as it altered - in a negative way - AES Tisza\u2019s regular income.\n\n10.3.6.\n\nHowever, for such impairment to amount to a breach of the ECT, it must be the result of an unreasonable or discriminatory measure.\n\n10.3.7.\n\nThere are two elements that require to be analyzed to determine whether a state\u2019s act was unreasonable: the existence of a rational policy; and the reasonableness of the act of the state in relation to the policy.\n\n10.3.8.\n\nA rational policy is taken by a state following a logical (good sense) explanation and with the aim of addressing a public interest matter.\n\n10.3.9.\n\nNevertheless, a rational policy is not enough to justify all the measures taken by a state in its name. A challenged measure must also be reasonable. That is, there needs to be an appropriate correlation between the state\u2019s public policy objective and the measure adopted to achieve it. This has to do with the nature of the measure and the way it is implemented.\n\n10.3.10.\n\nHungary has argued that it had three main reasons for introducing the Price Decrees.44\n\nRespondent\u2019s post-hearing submission, \u00b6 65.\n\n10.3.11.\n\nFirst, Hungary was concerned about the failure of generators to agree over several years to any reductions in contracted PPA capacity, to free up electricity for direct sale to the parallel free market, that had to be developed during the period of transition from the centralized economy to a liberal market.45\n\nRespondent\u2019s post-hearing submission, \u00b6 67.\n\n10.3.12.\n\nAs to this point, the Tribunal finds that it cannot be considered a reasonable measure for a state to use its governmental powers to force a private party to change or give up its contractual rights. If the state has the conviction that its contractual obligations to its investors should no longer be observed (even if it is a commercial contract, which is the case), the state would have to end such contracts and assume the contractual consequences of such early termination.\n\n10.3.13.\n\nThis does not mean that the state cannot exercise it governmental powers, including its legislative function, with the consequence that private interests - such as the investor\u2019s contractual rights - are affected. But that effect would have to be a consequence of a measure based on public policy that was not aimed only at those contractual rights. Were it to be otherwise, a state could justify the breach of commercial commitments by relying on arguments that such breach was occasioned by an act of the state performed in its public character.\n\n10.3.14.\n\nTherefore, the Tribunal cannot consider it to have been reasonable for Hungary to have issued the Price Decrees because of Claimants\u2019 failure to agree to, or even to negotiate for, a reduction in the capacity to which it was contractually entitled under the 2001 PPA.\n\n10.3.15.\n\nHungary\u2019s second stated reason for the introduction of the Price Decrees was the pressure of the EC Commission\u2019s investigations and the foreseeable obligation to correct (recover) state aid that the Commission\u2019s decision would impose.\n\n10.3.16.\n\nHad Hungary been motivated to reintroduce price regulation with a view to addressing the EC\u2019s state aid concerns, there is no doubt that this would have constituted a rational public policy measure. However, the Tribunal notes that as long as the Commission\u2019s state aid decision was not issued, Hungary had no legal obligation to act in accordance with what it believed could be the result of the decision and to start a limitation of potential state aid.\n\n10.3.17.\n\nDuring the hearing, it became clear to the Tribunal that SAMO, the Hungarian agency in charge of dealing with state aid issues, had not even been consulted when the government reintroduced regulated pricing in March 2006. Another important fact is that the use of the 7.1% cap on profits had no direct relation with state aid, because state aid occurs when the entity is receiving above-market prices. The elimination of above-market prices is not achieved by a cap on profits. To address such price concerns requires a general market price analysis.\n\n10.3.18.\n\nConsequently, the majority concludes that Hungary\u2019s decision to reintroduce administrative pricing was not motivated by pressure from the EC Commission.\n\n10.3.19.\n\nArbitrator Stem considers that it was not exclusively so motivated, but that the enquiry and subsequent pressures from the Commission certainly was in the Hungarian authorities\u2019 mind when they decided to reintroduce price regulation. In her view, it appears from the record that the high prices were also a serious problem for the Commission and it is quite evident that even before Hungary was under a legal obligation to follow the Commission\u2019s decision, it had been made abundantly clear to Hungary that the PPAs raised considerable concerns at the European level, as being in contradiction with the European free market policies. For example, in a meeting with the Commission in Brussels on 15 July 2004, concerns were expressed by the Commission that the stranded costs mechanism of Decree 183/ 2002 constitutes state aid to the generators, stating that \"it must be ensured that none of the power plants reaches *extra profits* under the PPAs.\" In other words, the EC position on the PPAs cannot be separated from the motivation that was behind the Price Decrees. It is noticeable that it is on 10 November 2005, one day after a European Commission\u2019s decision strongly critical of the PPAs, that HEO sent the letter to AES Tisza in which it claimed that the profits of the company were \"unjustifiable high\" and suggested that the profits should be capped at a maximum of 7.1%. Several factors - the state aid investigation, the obstacles to liberalization and the generators\u2019 excessive returns - were clearly interrelated, in the minds of the Hungarian government and regulators, when faced with the high profits of the generators. To arbitrator Stem, the evidence is overwhelming that the decision to reintroduce maximum administrative prices was a rational, non-arbitrary response to a complex set of legitimate policy concerns.\n\n10.3.20.\n\nHungary\u2019s third reason for acting had to do with the allegations that the profits enjoyed under the PPAs, in the absence of either competition or regulation, exceeded reasonable rates of return for public utility sales. Hungary does not deny that one of its reasons for acting had to do with these concerns.\n\n10.3.21.\n\nIn 2005, HEO made calculations that showed that several generators were earning returns in excess of the WACC level for the regulated electricity sector as a whole. After a series of unsuccessful attempts at PPA renegotiations, HEO presented the data regarding the generator\u2019s returns to the parliament\u2019s Energy Subcommittee.46\n\nExhibit R-196.\n\n10.3.22.\n\nIn the meantime, the level of the generators\u2019 returns became a public issue and something of a political lightning rod in the face of upcoming elections.\n\n10.3.23.\n\nHowever, the fact that an issue becomes a political matter, such as the excessive profits of the generators and the reintroduction of the Price Decrees, does not mean that the existence of a rational policy is erased.\n\n10.3.24.\n\nIn fact, it is normal and common that a public policy matter becomes a political issue; that is the arena where such matters are discussed and made public.\n\n10.3.25.\n\nEventually, an amendment to the 2001 Electricity Act and the Price Act, to enable the reintroduction of regulatory pricing, was proposed to parliament by Mr. Podol\u00e1k on 5 December 2005. The objective of the amendment was that \"the transmission and distribution of electricity, the controlling of the system, the selling of electricity contracted for public utility purposes by generators, trading between the public utility wholesaler and the public utility service provider and the electricity sold to consumers in the public utility sector are subject to the regulatory pricing stipulated under the act on the determination of prices.\"47\n\nExhibit C-82.\n\n10.3.26.\n\nThis amendment proposal contained a general explanation in the following terms:\n\n\"This act shall be enacted by the Parliament to include the generators\u2019 price of electricity contracted for public utility purposes in the scope of regulatory pricing.\n\nDuring the privatization of power stations in 1995-96, long-term power purchase agreements were concluded between power stations and MVM Rt. State revenue resulting from the conclusion of long-term power purchase agreements represented revenue from privatization. By way of the agreements stable and foreseeable returns are ensured to those investors who secure the availability of electricity generation capacities necessary to meet domestic demand through the modernization of existing power stations (or the construction of new ones).\n\nPrice formulas had been identified in the agreements but the application of these formulas was abrogated by regulatory pricing.\n\nIn the Government Decree 1074/1995 (4th August) on the regulation of electricity prices and price correction to be in effect until 1st January 1997 the Hom Cabinet guaranteed an 8% return on capital by way of regulatory pricing during the conclusion of privatization agreements. Pursuant to the above decree an administrative price regulation scheme came into effect for a period of 4 years (JKM Decree No. 63/1995 (24th November) Annex 1).\n\nIn 1997 the generators\u2019 average profit was 8.23%, a percentage that steadily increased until 2000 as a result of the efficiency improvement of power stations. By 2000 the average profit of generators was 15.71%.\n\nIn 2000 PriceWaterhouseCoopers International consulting company, upon engagement by the Orb\u00e1n Cabinet, indicated in its report titled \"Energy Market Opening Program\" that the long-term agreements are impeding the liberalization of the energy market as the agreements contract nearly all domestic power station capacities until 2010-2015 and as such there is no free marketable electricity remaining in the market. Due to the above the international consultant proposed to the Orb\u00e1n Cabinet to reduce regulatory prices during the new price regulatory period using this as an additional measure to encourage generators to renegotiate the agreements.\n\nHad the Orb\u00e1n Cabinet given consideration to the proposal presented by the international consultant engaged by it, then the Hungarian Energy Office (lead by Director General P\u00e9ter Kaderj\u00e1k, appointed by Gyorgy Matolcsi Minister of Economy) would have been required to propose an administrative price determination that would have repeatedly reduced the generators\u2019 profit to 8% in relation to the on-coming 4-year price regulation period to be determined in 2000. On the contrary the administrative price decree (No. 45/2000 (21st December) issued by the Ministry of Economy) abrogated the regulation concerning the 8% profit margin and introduced new price formulas.\n\nAs a result of the decision made by the Minister of Economy on the Orb\u00e1n Cabinet, the 2001 profit of power stations was 22.83% as opposed to the expected 8%. This price regulation was in effect until the end of 2003 ensuring a steadily high profit level to power station investors. Act 110 (in its final clauses, Section 117 paragraph (2)) on electricity presented by the Orb\u00e1n Cabinet and approved by the Fidesz-FKGP MPs on 18th December 2001 terminated administrative price regulation for generators as of 1st January 2004. Therefore the previously unapplied price formulas that are based on administrative pricing and are stipulated in the agreements came into effect.\n\nThe margins generated by power stations between 1997 and 2004 were as follows:\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1997 | 1998 | 1999 | 2000 | 2001 | 2002 | 2003 | 2004 |\n| 8.23% | 12,73% | 12.70% | 15.71% | 22.83% | 21.62% | 14.49% | 22.36% |\n\nThis draft legislation includes a proposal for correcting the regulatory error by the Orb\u00e1n Cabinet and allows for the Government to exercise the measure of administrative pricing in the absence of agreement between the parties, which measure also affects the sale prices stipulated in long-term power purchase agreements providing high profit levels.\"\n\n10.3.27.\n\nFor its part, the FIDESZ presented an independent representative proposal,48 which did not propose the reintroduction of the Price Decrees but requested the government, among other things, to review the PPAs, to create the conditions of fair competition in the national electric energy market and to ensure affordable prices.\n\nExhibit C-83.\n\n10.3.28.\n\nThe reasoning behind the FIDESZ proposal was similar to Mr. Podol\u00e1k\u2019s proposal, as it indicated that:\n\n\"the prices of electric power are unfairly high compared to the price level of countries around us. For the security of the people and in order to lighten the financial burden of families and to increase the competitiveness of enterprises and with the intention to perceivably reduce the price of electric energy and to create honest competition in the market, the National Assembly passes the following resolution...\n\nREASONING\n\nOf all new EU members states, it is we, Hungarians, that pay the most for electric energy. A Hungarian household and family pays twice as much for electricity as the Baltic States, 40% more than the Polish and the Czech and 20% more than Slovaks. The price of electric energy turned out like this despite of the fact that there is official price setting giving the State the opportunity to set a more favorable price...\"49\n\nExhibit C-83.\n\n10.3.29.\n\nOn 3 March 2006, the Electricity Act was amended by the Hungarian parliament, reflecting the amendment proposed by Mr. Podol\u00e1k on 5 December, 2005.50 The FIDESZ abstained from voting on the proposal.\n\nExhibit C-82.\n\n10.3.30.\n\nBased on the debates in parliament and outside parliament, the majority of the Tribunal has concluded that Hungary\u2019s decision to reintroduce administrative pricing was not based on the EC Commission\u2019s investigation. Nor, however, was it made with the intention of affecting Claimants\u2019 contractual rights\n\n10.3.31.\n\nRather, against this factual background, the majority has concluded that Hungary\u2019s reintroduction of administrative pricing in 2006 was motivated principally by widespread concerns relating to (and it was aimed directly at reducing) excessive profits earned by generators and the burden on consumers.51\n\nTranscript, pp. 844:2-845:2; Exhibit R-172, \u00b6 229.\n\n10.3.32.\n\nThis is because virtually all of the debate in parliament at the relevant time was about \"profits.\" Indeed, government minister Mr. Tibor Kov\u00e1cs specifically asked the opposition parties if they were prepared to support the proposal, which he said \"gives tools for the government to limit the alleged and so-called luxury profits.\"52\n\nExhibit SF 19, p. 9.\n\n10.3.33.\n\nThere is also no reference to be found to EC state aid or negotiations with EC in the official reasons for Act XXXV.\n\n10.3.34.\n\nHaving concluded that Hungary was principally motivated by the politics surrounding so-called luxury profits, the Tribunal nevertheless is of the view that it is a perfectly valid and rational policy objective for a government to address luxury profits. And while such price regimes may not be seen as desirable in certain quarters, this does not mean that such a policy is irrational. One need only recall recent wide-spread concerns about the profitability level of banks to understand that so-called excessive profits may well give rise to legitimate reasons for governments to regulate or re-regulate.\n\n10.3.35.\n\nAs to the need for a reasonable correlation between the state\u2019s policy objective and the measures adopted to achieve it, the Tribunal notes that before the amendment of the 2001 Electricity Act, Hungary had approached the generators to renegotiate the PPAs. Given that no agreement was reached, and in the absence of a specific commitment to the Claimants that administrative pricing was never going to be reintroduced, the Hungarian parliament voted for the reintroduction of administrative pricing, which parliament considered to be the best option at the moment.\n\n10.3.36.\n\nThe Tribunal finds that both the 2006 Electricity Act and the implementing Price Decrees were reasonable, proportionate and consistent with the public policy expressed by the parliament.\n\n10.3.37.\n\nHaving determined that the decision to introduce the Price Decrees was not an arbitrary or unreasonable measure, it is also necessary to determine if, as stated by Hungary, the generators were still going to receive a reasonable return.\n\n10.3.38.\n\nThe regulatory regime in place at the time of the privatization was provided by the 1994 Electricity Act. Under the 1994 Act, the HEO would issue detailed rules on pricing, based on which the minister would determine prices to be announced in the form of a decree.53 The 1994 Electricity Act also provided, in Article 55(3), that the HEO should review the price levels and actual prices on the basis of the initiative of any interested party, and shall make the results of the process public. This provision is understood by the Tribunal as providing the right to any interested party (obviously including generators) to request a costs review of the prices, but only after they have been issued by the minister.\n\nExhibit C-58, Article 55 of the 1994 Electricity Act.\n\n10.3.39.\n\nIn addition, the Original PPA provided that payment was to be made by reference mainly to both the Availability Fee which is \"paying the need for capacity to be in place in case it is needed\" and the Electricity Fee which is \"the cost of the power it actually requires to have generated.\"54 Both fees\u2019 values to be specified in the Annual Commercial Agreement should be considered based upon the order of the Ministry of Industry and Trade.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 65.\n\n10.3.40.\n\nThe HEO issued a detailed framework pertaining to the pricing every four years, beginning in 1997. Under the 1994 Electricity Act, there were two pricing frameworks:\n\n(a) the 1995 Framework Decree. Both parties agree that with this decree, the profit was supposed to be an 8% return on equity, approximately;55\n\n(b) the 2000 Framework Decree. The starting point of the price regulation mechanism was provided by the base prices on 1 January 2001 and the preceding assets and cost reviews carried out by HEO. A mechanism of yearly price correction was established, and inflation was also taken into account.\n\nOn the one hand, Claimants stated that the 8% return on equity was a starting price, on the other hand, Respondent stated that the 8% return on equity was a maximum cap.\n\n10.3.41.\n\nThe 2000 Framework Decree was valid until 1 January 2004, which was the date established in the 2001 Electricity Act for the abolishment of regulated prices.\n\n10.3.42.\n\nTherefore, starting on 1 January 2004, the formula established in Schedule 6 of the 2001 PPA was applied to AES Tisza\u2019s payments.\n\n10.3.43.\n\nThe Price Decrees provided a 7.1% pre-tax return on assets.\n\n10.3.44.\n\nAgainst the factual background which preceded the March 2006 price re-regulation, the Tribunal considers that the 7.1% rate of return on assets, which it prescribed, to be comparable to the 8% return on equity target that was in place at the time of the privatization.56 Consequently, in the Tribunal\u2019s view, the prices fixed for AES Tisza pursuant to the Price Decrees were reasonable, taking into account their consistency with the original returns it earned at the time of the Claimants\u2019 original investment.\n\nKovacs Statement, \u00b6 39.\n\n10.3.45.\n\nTurning finally to Claimants\u2019 case based on discrimination, the Tribunal observes that the Price Decrees, which were applicable to all the generators, established a specific price per KHUF/MW/YR to be paid for the Availability Fee (Capacity Fee) depending on the generator.\n\n10.3.46.\n\nClaimants contend that this constitutes discrimination, given that the price fixed for AES Tizsa was the lowest of all the generators (including foreign and local).\n\n10.3.47.\n\nHowever, the Tribunal finds that the price established for each of the generators was reached using the same methodology. The fact that the price for each generator was different was simply the result of the use of a different starting point of prior returns which was fed into the methodology.57\n\nB\u00e9k\u00e9s First Statement, p. 36 and p. 38.\n\n10.3.48.\n\nMoreover, to suggest that AES\u2019s low capacity fee ranking (in comparison to other generators) is indicative of discrimination is misleading. AES\u2019s capacity fees were always at the bottom of the scale *(see* Appendix C, Respondent\u2019s post-hearing brief) in each of the three relevant price cycles. But, as Mr. B\u00e9k\u00e9s explained, that was because capacity fees were based on cost structure, and the Tisza II plant had relatively low fixed costs per unit of capacity.\n\n10.3.49.\n\nBy contrast, energy fees (Electricity Fees) were based on variable operating costs, which were relatively high at Tisza II. This resulted in AES Tisza always receiving amongst the highest energy fee of any of the generators.\n\n10.3.50.\n\nThe Tribunal thus concludes that neither its low capacity fees, nor its high energy fees suggest discrimination. Both were the logical result of a uniform methodology that was applied equally to all generators, based on their differing assets and operating cost structures.\n\n10.3.51.\n\nThe same can be said for Claimants\u2019 assertions of discrimination based on the fact that only four generators were affected (\"targeted\") by the reintroduction of price regulation. This is because the notion of a cap on prices based on a starting target of \"reasonable returns\" means that generators that are already earning below that return will not be affected by the regulation.\n\n10.3.52.\n\nAnd having regard to the objective of 2006/2007 price cap regulation, of protecting consumers from having to fund so-called \"excessive profits\" of generators, it is perfectly logical that generators whose returns were not \"excessive\" at the time of re-regulation would not be affected by the cap.\n\n10.3.53.\n\nDiscrimination necessarily implies that the state benefited or harmed someone more in comparison with the generality. In this case, on the uncontradicted facts, the Tribunal finds that there has been no different treatment of AES Tisza in comparison with the other generators and, thus, that it was not the subject of discriminatory treatment.\n\n**11. NATIONAL TREATMENT**\n--------------------------\n\n**11.1 Claimants\u2019 Position**\n----------------------------\n\n11.1.1.\n\nClaimants argue in support of their national treatment case that the treatment received by the Paks power station, a domestically owned electricity generator, and wholly-owned subsidiary of MVM, was more favorable than the treatment received by all the other generators, because Paks actually received a price increase under the Price Decrees in comparison with the one agreed in its PPA.58\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 239.\n\n**11.2 Respondent\u2019s Position**\n------------------------------\n\n11.2.1.\n\nThe Respondent denies a breach of the ECT\u2019s national treatment obligation and asserts that the Price Decrees \"only overrode contractual pricing when it exceeded the \"maximum\" level set by the uniform 7.1% return-on-assets methodology\" and that such situation did not happen in the case of Paks because, based on contractual formula in its PPA, its actual return was significantly lower than the target level.59\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 383.\n\n**11.3 Findings of the Tribunal**\n---------------------------------\n\n11.3.1.\n\nArticle 10(7) of the ECT obliges each signatory party to accord \"treatment no less favorable than that which it accords to Investments of its own Investors or for the Investors of any other Contracting Party or any third state and their related activities.\"\n\n11.3.2.\n\nThe alleged breach of the obligation to provide national treatment is based on the same facts that Claimants alleged amounted to a discriminatory measure,60 where the Tribunal found that no discriminatory measure was taken by the government. Indeed, Claimants\u2019 admitted that the generator with the highest capacity fee was, like itself, foreign.\n\nWith the difference that Claimants specify that the national generator that received a better treatment is Paks. Memorial, \u00b6 239.\n\n11.3.3.\n\nTherefore, as was concluded in Section 10 above, the Tribunal finds that Hungary did not breach its ECT obligation to provide national treatment to AES Tisza.\n\n**12. MOST FAVOURED NATION TREATMENT**\n--------------------------------------\n\n**12.1 Claimants\u2019 Position**\n----------------------------\n\n12.1.1.\n\nThe Claimants allege that the facts relied on in relation to discriminatory measures also establish a violation of the most favoured nation treatment obligation.\n\n**12.2 Respondent\u2019s Position**\n------------------------------\n\n12.2.1.\n\nThe Respondent claims that \"the application of a uniform methodology to all power plants with PPAs, based on the objective of capping returns at prescribed rates of reasonableness, is not rendered discriminatory simply because some plants had previously exceeded the \"reasonable\" level by more than others.\"\n\n**12.3 Findings of the Tribunal**\n---------------------------------\n\n12.3.1.\n\nArticle 10(7) of the ECT obliges each signatory party to accord \"treatment no less favorable than that which it accords to Investments of its own Investors or for the Investors of any other Contracting Party or any third state and their related activities.\"\n\n12.3.2.\n\nThe alleged breach of the most favoured nation treatment obligation is based on the same facts that Claimants alleged amounted to a discriminatory measure,61 where the Tribunal found that no discriminatory measure was taken by the government - *i.e.,* that each generator\u2019s price was determined based on the application of a uniform methodology. This being the case, there can be no suggestion that AES was treated \"less favourably\" than any other similarly positioned investor.\n\nWith the difference that Claimants specify that the other generators that received a better treatment are Budapesti, Pannon, M\u00e1tra and Csepeli. Memorial, \u00b6 245.\n\n12.3.3.\n\nTherefore, as was concluded in Section 10, the Tribunal finds that Hungary did not breach its ECT obligation to provide most favoured nation treatment to AES Tisza.\n\n**13. CONSTANT PROTECTION AND SECURITY**\n----------------------------------------\n\n**13.1 Claimants\u2019 Position**\n----------------------------\n\n13.1.1.\n\nClaimants maintain that the state\u2019s obligation to provide constant protection and security covers not only the physical security of the investment but also the legal security and protection.\n\n13.1.2.\n\nIn their opinion, Hungary breached the standard when it failed to ensure the legal security of the investments through the 2006 Electricity Act Amendment and the ensuing implementation of the Price Decrees, given that such acts have substantially devalued their investment.\n\n13.1.3.\n\nRelying on the duty identified by the Tribunal in *CME**,* Claimants say that the 2006 Electricity Amendment Act and the Price Decrees eviscerated their rights under the 2001 Settlement Agreement and the 2001 PPA. Hungary thus made it \"impossible to preserve and continue contractual arrangements underpinning the investment\" and has therefore breached the most constant protection and security provisions of Article 10(1).62\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 254.\n\n13.1.4.\n\nThe requirement to provide constant protection and security is a duty:\n\n\"to use the powers of government to ensure the foreign investment can function properly on a level playing field, unhindered and not harassed by the political and economic domestic powers that be.\"63\n\nExhibit CA-80, T.M. W\u00e4lde, Energy Charter Treaty-based Arbitration, Transactional Dispute Management, Vol. 1, Issue 3, p.30.\n\n13.1.5.\n\nAnd the level playing field here, which Hungary itself destroyed, was the pre-existing, freely negotiated contractual relationship that the generators enjoyed with MVM.\n\n**13.2 Respondent\u2019s Position**\n------------------------------\n\n13.2.1.\n\nTo the contrary, Hungary argues that the obligation to provide constant protection and security cannot be understood as a treaty-based stabilization clause, tantamount to a guarantee of a \"legal security\" under which a state will take no action that interferes with the \"contractual arrangements underpinning [an] investment.\" Respondent says that the standard imposes a duty of \"due diligence\" that requires the state to afford reasonable protection to investors against foreseeable harm from third parties. It adds that there can be no credible suggestion that the Price Decrees were designed to destroy a \"level playing field on which Claimants could properly function unhindered and not harassed by the political and economic powers that be\" when their very purpose was to ensure a reasonable return for all generators with PPAs.\n\n13.2.2.\n\nRespondent admits that some tribunals have recently expanded the scope of protection beyond the two traditional areas *(i.e.,* physical protection and the provision of reasonable legal avenues to enforce investors\u2019 rights) to include general references to legal security. But even under such an expansive reading, the protection is not absolute, and applies only in exceptional circumstances.\n\n**13.3 Findings of the Tribunal**\n---------------------------------\n\n13.3.1.\n\nIn addition to the fair and equitable standard, Article 10(1) of the ECT establishes that the \"investments shall also enjoy the most constant protection and security and no Contracting Party shall in any way impair by unreasonable or discriminatory measures their management, maintenance, use, enjoyment or disposal.\"\n\n13.3.2.\n\nIn the Tribunal\u2019s view, the duty to provide most constant protection and security to investments is a state\u2019s obligation to take reasonable steps to protect its investors (or to enable its investors to protect themselves) against harassment by third parties and/or state actors. But the standard is certainly not one of strict liability. And while it can, in appropriate circumstances, extend beyond a protection of physical security,64 it certainly does not protect against a state\u2019s right (as was the case here) to legislate or regulate in a manner which may negatively affect a claimant\u2019s investment, provided that the state acts reasonably in the circumstances and with a view to achieving objectively rational public policy goals.\n\n*Compa\u00f1\u00eda de Aguas del Aconquija, S.A. and Vivendi Universal S.A. v. Argentine Republic,* Award, 20 August 2007, \u00b6 7.4.16\n\n13.3.3.\n\nIn the words of Brownlie, the duty is no more than to provide \"a reasonable measure of prevention which a well-administered government could be expected to exercise under similar circumstances.\"65\n\nBrownlie, Ian, System of the Law of Nations: State Responsibility (1986), p. 162.\n\n13.3.4.\n\nClaimants\u2019 argument, that the \"level playing field,\" defined as \"the pre-existing, freely negotiated contractual relationship that the generators enjoyed with MVM\" had somehow to be protected by Hungary is seriously overreaching, given that neither the 2001 Settlement Agreement, nor the 2001 PPA, contemplated that pricing regulation could not be reintroduced. The PPA only stipulated that if the administrative pricing disappeared specific formulas would be applied.\n\n13.3.5.\n\nTo conclude that the right to constant protection and security implies that no change in law that affects the investor\u2019s rights could take place, would be practically the same as to recognizing the existence of a non-existent stability agreement as a consequence of the full protection and security standard.\n\n13.3.6.\n\nThe Tribunal finds that there can have been no breach of the obligation to provide constant protection and security as a result of Hungary\u2019s reintroduction of regulated pricing in 2006-2007, such reintroduction being based on rational public policy grounds.\n\n**14. EXPROPRIATION**\n---------------------\n\n**14.1 Claimants\u2019 Position**\n----------------------------\n\n14.1.1.\n\nClaimants\u2019 argue that Hungary \"summarily and arbitrarily expropriated substantial revenues which AES Tisza had been contractually entitled to receive under the 2001 PPA\"66 by amending the 2001 Electricity Act and issuing of the Price Decrees. This act is considered by Claimants as a conduct \"equivalent to nationalization or expropriation.\"67\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 255.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 255.\n\n14.1.2.\n\nIn this regard, Claimants state that, as it has been decided by numerous arbitral tribunals, an act tantamount to expropriation occurs when the state deprives an investor of its contractual rights even when the act does not involve a taking of physical property.68\n\nMemorial, \u00b6\u00b6 256 *et seq.*\n\n14.1.3.\n\nIn addition, Claimants maintain that the expropriation may be indirect when there is an interference with the use of property, even if is incidental and even if the state does not benefit from such interference.69\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 258.\n\n14.1.4.\n\nMoreover, Claimants contend that a state\u2019s measures can amount to expropriation even when they are in force for only a limited period. Reliance is placed on *Wena Hotels v. Arab* *Republic of Egypt* (ICSID Case No. ARB/98/4), in which the Tribunal determined that an expropriation can take place even when the interference was executed only during a limited period of time.70\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 263.\n\n**14.2 Respondent\u2019s Position**\n------------------------------\n\n14.2.1.\n\nRespondent contends, in brief, that Claimants have no legal basis to claim an expropriation (direct or indirect) given that Hungary\u2019s acts did not deprive the Claimants from the use and control of their investment and the investment was not deprived of all meaningful value.71 Respondent says that such requirements are preconditions to a finding of an expropriation by the Tribunal. Furthermore, the Respondent argues that Claimants do not contend that AES suffered harm remotely equivalent to a traditional expropriation and that they cannot expand the doctrine of indirect expropriation to cover acts which may lead to the temporary diminution of their profits. According to the Respondent, Claimants themselves acknowledged to the EC that regulating prices was more the rule than the exception in Hungary: in a letter dated 13 February 2006, Claimants described price controls as having been simply *\" suspended for a brief interlude* commencing 1st January 2004.\"72\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 406.\n\nAES\u2019s memorandum to the EC, R-93, 13 February 2006.\n\n**14.3 Findings of the Tribunal**\n---------------------------------\n\n14.3.1.\n\nIt is evident that many state\u2019s acts or measures can affect investments and a modification to an existing law or regulation is probably one of the most common of such acts or measures. Nevertheless, a state\u2019s act that has a negative effect on an investment cannot automatically be considered an expropriation. For an expropriation to occur, it is necessary for the investor to be deprived, in whole or significant part, of the property in or effective control of its investment: or for its investment to be deprived, in whole or significant part, of its value.\n\n14.3.2.\n\nBut, in this case, the amendment of the 2001 Electricity Act and the issuance of the Price Decrees did not interfere with the ownership or use of Claimants\u2019 property. Claimants retained at all times the control of the AES Tisza II plant, thus there was no deprivation of Claimants\u2019 ownership or control of their investment.\n\n14.3.3.\n\nMoreover, Claimants continued to receive substantial revenues from their investments during 2006 and 2007, which proves that the value of their investment was not substantially diminished and that they were not deprived of the whole or a significant part of the value of their investments.\n\n14.3.4.\n\nIn these circumstances, the Tribunal concludes that the effects of the reintroduction of the Price Decrees do not amount to an expropriation of Claimants\u2019 investment(s).\n\n**15. COSTS**\n-------------\n\n**15.1 Claimants\u2019 Position**\n----------------------------\n\n15.1.1.\n\nOn 8 July 2010, the Claimants filed their final Statement of Costs which amounted to a total cost of US$ 8,787,993.70 and included legal fees and expenses. To date, Claimants have paid an advance on costs to ICSID and the Tribunal in the amount of US$ 459,945.00.\n\n**15.2 Respondent\u2019s Position**\n------------------------------\n\n15.2.1.\n\nFor its part, on 25 June 2010, Respondent filed its final Statement of Costs which amounted to a total cost of US$ 5,522,883.00 which included legal fees and expenses. To date, Respondent has paid an advance on costs to ICSID and the Tribunal in the amount of US$ 460,000.00.\n\n**15.3 Findings of the Tribunal**\n---------------------------------\n\n15.3.1.\n\nThe cost of the arbitration, which includes, *inter alia,* the arbitrators' fees, the expenses of the Tribunal, the Secretariat's administrative fee and the charges for the use of the facilities of the Centre, at the time of the award, amounts to US$ 887,839.04.73\n\nThe total cost of the arbitration proceeding (US$ 887,839.04) includes an estimate of the courier expenses for the dispatch of the award and may thus be subject to slight change. A final financial statement will be issued by the Centre upon the closure of the trust fund account established for this case.\n\n15.3.2.\n\nPursuant to Article 61(2) of the ICSID Convention, as well as Rule 28 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules, the Tribunal has the discretion in the absence of a prior agreement between the parties to decide the allocation of the costs and the legal fees and expenses between the parties.\n\n15.3.3.\n\nIt is the view of the Tribunal that no frivolous claim was filed in the proceeding and that no bad faith was observed from the parties. In fact, the Tribunal notes that the submissions and the argumentations of both parties were presented in a professional manner. Consequently, the Tribunal concludes that each party shall bear its own costs and expenses and share equally in the costs and charges of the Tribunal and the ICSID Secretariat.\n\n**16. OPERATIVE PART**\n----------------------\n\n16.1.\n\nOn the basis of the foregoing reasons, this Tribunal **ORDERS AND AWARDS** as follows:\n\n(a) The Tribunal has jurisdiction over all the ECT claims presented in this arbitration;\n\n(b) The Respondent did not breach Articles 10(1), 10(7) and 13 of the ECT;\n\n(c) The parties shall bear the costs of the arbitration in equal shares;\n\n(d) The parties shall bear their own costs and legal fees;\n\n(e) All other claims are dismissed."}, {"Title": "Decision of the ad hoc Committee on the Application for Annulment", "Type": "Annulment", "Date": "2012-06-29T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Decision of the ad hoc Committee on the Application for Annulment\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**I.** Introduction and Procedural History\n------------------------------------------\n\n1.\n\nOn 19 January 2011, AES Summit Generation Limited and AES-Tisza Er\u00f6m\u00fc Kft. (together, the \"Applicants\" or \"AES\") filed a timely application for annulment, pursuant to Article 52 of the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States (the \"ICSID Convention\" or \"Convention\"), of the Award which was rendered on 23 September 2010 (the \"Award\") in favour of Hungary (\"Hungary\" or \"Respondent\") by an Arbitral Tribunal composed of Mr. Claus von Wobeser (President), Professor Brigitte Stem and J. William Rowley QC (the \"Tribunal\").\n\n2.\n\nThe Award determined that the dispute between Applicants and Respondent (the \"Parties\") related to an alleged violation by Respondent of its obligations under the Energy Charter Treaty (the \"ECT\"). Applicants\u2019 original claim arose out of Hungary\u2019s enactment of the 2006 Electricity Act Amendment, which provided for the re-introduction of regulated prices for electricity generators pursuant to two price decrees in December 2006 and February 2007 respectively. Administrative prices had been abolished as from 01 January 2004, pursuant to the Electricity Act 2001, prior to Hungary\u2019s accession to the European Union. Specifically, Applicants alleged that Hungary violated its obligations under the ECT in the following respects: (i) breach of its obligation to provide fair and equitable treatment; (ii) impairment of AES\u2019s investment by unreasonable and discriminatory measures; (iii) breach of its obligation to provide national treatment; (iv) breach of its obligation to provide most-favoured nation treatment; (v) breach of its obligation to provide constant protection and security; and (vi) expropriation.\n\n3.\n\nHungary did not question Applicants\u2019 right to bring its claim to ICSID arbitration. In any case, the Tribunal found that it had jurisdiction over all the ECT claims brought in that arbitration, in accordance with the conditions contained in Article 25 of the ICSID Convention. The Tribunal found that Hungary had not breached Articles 10(1), 10(7) and 13 of the ECT, and dismissed all other claims. The Tribunal ordered the Parties to bear in equal shares the costs of the arbitration as well as their own costs and legal fees.\n\n4.\n\nOn 19 January 2011, Applicants filed the present Application for Annulment (the \"Application\" or \"A-A\"). The Application requests annulment of the Award in its entirety, under the grounds contained in Article 52(1)(b) (manifest excess of powers) and Article 52(1)(e) (failure to state reasons) of the ICSID Convention.\n\n5.\n\nOn 21 January 2011, the ICSID Secretariat confirmed receipt of electronic and hard copies of the Application on 19 January 2011 and 20 January 2011 respectively.\n\n6.\n\nOn 28 January 2011, the ICSID Secretariat registered the Application pursuant to Rule 50(2)(b) of the ICSID Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings (the \"ICSID Arbitration Rules\"), and informed the Parties accordingly.\n\n7.\n\nOn 21 March 2011, the ICSID Secretariat informed the Parties of the constitution of the *ad hoc* Committee comprising Professor Bernard Hanotiau (President), Professor Dr. Rolf Knieper and Judge Abdulqawi Ahmed Yusuf (the *\"ad hoc* Committee\" or \"Committee\"). On 22 March 2011, the ICSID Secretariat transmitted copies of the Committee Members\u2019 signed declarations in accordance with Rules 53 and 6(2) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules.\n\n8.\n\nOn 11 May 2011, the First Session of the *ad hoc* Committee was held at the World Bank offices in Paris. During the First Session, various procedural matters were agreed between the Parties and the *ad hoc* Committee. The Parties agreed, *inter alia,* that the present proceedings would be governed by the 2006 ICSID Arbitration Rules and that they had no objection to the constitution of the *ad hoc* Committee as described above.1 They also agreed on a provisional timetable. Applicants assured that their Application was to be considered as their Memorial on Annulment. Summary Minutes of the First Session were dispatched to the Parties by the ICSID Secretariat on 01 June 2011.\n\nSee \u00b6 7.\n\n9.\n\nOn 10 August 2011, Respondent filed its Counter-Memorial on Annulment (\"Counter-Memorial on Annulment\" or \"A-CM\"), together with accompanying exhibits and authorities.\n\n10.\n\nOn 19 October 2011, Applicants filed their Reply to Hungary\u2019s Counter-Memorial on Annulment (\"Reply on Annulment\" or \"A-Ry\"), together with accompanying exhibits and authorities.\n\n11.\n\nOn 30 December 2011, Respondent filed its Rejoinder on Annulment (\"Rejoinder on Annulment\" or \"A-Rj\"), together with a single accompanying exhibit and a single accompanying authority.\n\n12.\n\nBy letter of 10 January 2012, the ICSID Secretariat invited the Parties to inform the *ad hoc* Committee of any joint proposal they would like to make with regard to the hearing\u2019s agenda and related questions of procedure.\n\n13.\n\nOn 17 January 2012, the Parties submitted an agreed draft agenda for the hearing on annulment. The Parties also agreed that two days would be sufficient for the hearing, rather than three days, as previously proposed.\n\n14.\n\nOn 13 February 2012 and 14 February 2012, a hearing was held at the ICC Hearing Centre in Paris. The proceeding was closed on 14 June 2012 in accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rules 53 and 38(1).\n\n**II.** Preliminary Remarks\n---------------------------\n\n15.\n\nAs a preliminary matter, the Committee notes that the scope of its present task is limited to determining whether to annul either all or part of the Award, or to let the Award stand. As unambiguously expressed in Article 53 of the Convention, an award is not subject to an appeal. Annulment must therefore be different from appeal. It is well settled in international investment arbitration that an *ad hoc* committee may not substitute its own judgment on the merits for that of a tribunal. As such, the Committee has no competence to express any view on the substantive correctness of the Tribunal\u2019s reasoning.\n\n16.\n\nThe grounds upon which annulment may be based are listed exhaustively in Article 52(1) of the ICSID Convention. In the present case, Applicants invoke two of these grounds, namely:\n\n(b) that the Tribunal has manifestly exceeded its powers;\n\nand\n\n(e) that the award has failed to state the reasons on which it is based.\n\n17.\n\nThe Committee is bound to interpret these terms of the Convention \"in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms... in their context and in the light of its object and purpose\", as required by Article 31 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties of 1969. The text of the ICSID Convention is the result of long and profound debates. With respect to Articles 52 and 53 the drafters have taken great care to use terms which clearly express that annulment is an exhaustive, exceptional and narrowly circumscribed remedy and not an appeal. The interpretation of the terms must take this object and purpose into consideration and avoid an approach which would result in the qualification of a tribunal\u2019s reasoning as deficient, superficial, sub-standard, wrong, bad or otherwise faulty, in other words, a re-assessment of the merits which is typical for an appeal. In this perspective, the ordinary meaning of a manifest excess of power is either an obvious transgression of a tribunal\u2019s mandate or its obvious non-execution; and the ordinary meaning of a failure to state the reasons on which the decision is based is the absence of reasons or a presentation which is unintelligible in relation to the decision thus equating a lack of reasons.\n\n18.\n\nIn the analysis below, the Committee has not only considered the positions of the Parties as summarised in this Decision, but also the numerous detailed arguments made in their written submissions and at the hearing. To the extent that these arguments are not referred to expressly, they must be deemed to be subsumed in the Committee\u2019s analysis.\n\n**III.** The Relevant Legal Standards\n-------------------------------------\n\nA. Article 52(1)(b): Manifest Excess of Powers\n----------------------------------------------\n\n19.\n\nWhilst the Parties do not disagree to a great extent regarding the applicable legal standard for annulment under Article 52(1)(b), nevertheless their submissions contain divergent emphases in various respects.\n\n(a) Summary of the Parties\u2019 Positions\n-------------------------------------\n\n20.\n\nFirst, Applicants submit that the grounds for annulment under Article 52(1)(b) extend to instances where a tribunal has exceeded its jurisdiction both by exercising a power it does not have, and also by failing to decide claims that are properly before it.2\n\nA-A, \u00b6 95.\n\n21.\n\nIn support of this proposition, they cite passages from various annulment decisions. They refer, for instance, to the decision of the *ad hoc* committee in *Soufraki* which states that:3\n\nThe *manifest* and *consequential* non-exercise of one\u2019s full powers conferred or recognized in a tribunal\u2019s constituent instrument such as the ICSID Convention and the relevant BIT, is as much a disregard of the power as the overstepping of the limits of that power.\n\nA-A, \u00b6 97, referring to *Hussein Nuaman Soufraki v. U.A.E.,* Decision on Annulment, 5 June 2007, \u00b6 43 (\"*Soufraki*\") (emphasis in original).\n\n22.\n\nHungary, for its part, submits that very few cases have explored the \"counterintuitive notion\" that a tribunal may exceed its powers through a shortfall in the exercise of its jurisdiction, and that even if it is accepted in principle, its application should be narrowly circumscribed.4 Moreover, an award may only be annulled on these grounds where a tribunal has failed to decide a claim in its entirety, as opposed to mere \"questions\" or \"arguments\" in support of a claim.\n\nA-CM, \u00b6 248.\n\n23.\n\nSecond, concerning the requirement that an excess of power be \"manifest\", Applicants submit that the relevant criteria are that the excess of power be textually obvious and substantively serious. Again, they cite *Soufraki:5*\n\nThe Committee believes that a strict opposition between two different meanings of \"manifest\" - either obvious or serious - is an unnecessary debate. It seems to this Committee that a manifest excess of power implies that the excess of power should at once be textually obvious and substantively serious.\n\nA-A, \u00b6 99, referring to *Soufraki,* \u00b6 40\n\n24.\n\nWhilst Hungary does not dispute this definition, it nevertheless emphasises the limited scope of Article 52(1)(b) by citing the following passage from the annulment committee\u2019s decision in *CDC*:6\n\nAs interpreted by various *ad hoc* Committees, the term \"manifest\" means clear or \"self-evident\". Thus, even if a Tribunal exceeds its powers, the excess must be plain on its face for annulment to be an available remedy. Any excess apparent in a Tribunal\u2019s conduct, if susceptible of argument \"one way or the other,\" is not manifest. As one commentator has put it, \"If the issue is debatable or requires examination of the materials on which the tribunal\u2019s decision is based, the tribunal\u2019s determination is conclusive\".\n\n*CDC Group plc. v. Republic of Seychelles,* Decision on Annulment, 29 June 2005, \u00b6 41 (\"CDC\"), referring to *Wena Hotels v. Arab Republic of Egypt,* Decision on Annulment, 5 February 2002, \u00b6 25 (\"Wena\"), and M.B. Feldman, *The Annulment Proceedings and the Finality of ICSID Arbitration Awards,* 2 ICSID Rev. 85 (1987), p. 101.\n\n25.\n\nFurther, relyingon the *Repsol* annulment decision, Hungary argues that an error is only manifest where the mistake is serious enough to \"cast doubt on the legitimacy of proceedings\":7\n\nUnder Article 52(1) of the ICSID Convention, the Committee is empowered to annul awards containing manifest errors only when they are serious enough to cast doubt on the legitimacy of the proceedings.\n\n*Repsol YPF Ecuador SA v. Empresa Estatal Petr\u00f3leos del Ecuador (Petroecuador),* Decision on Annulment, 8 January 2007, \u00b6 75 (\"*Repsol*\").\n\n26.\n\nThird, AES argues that grounds for annulment may exist under Article 52(1)(b) where a tribunal has disregarded the applicable law. However, it notes the decision of the *Enron* annulment committee, which states that:8\n\nThere is a distinction between *non-application* of the applicable law (which is a ground for annulment), and an *incorrect application* of the applicable law (which is not), although this is a distinction that may not always be easy to draw.\n\nA-A, \u00b6 105, referring to *Enron Creditors Recovery Corporation (Formerly Enron Corporation) and Ponderosa Assets, L.P. v. Argentine Republic,* Decision on Annulment, 30 July 2010, \u00b6 68 (\"*Enron*\"*).*\n\n27.\n\nHungary does not in principle contest AES\u2019s argument that grounds for annulment may exist where a tribunal has disregarded the applicable law. Hungary submits, however, that this can only be the case where a tribunal has disregarded the law agreed upon by the parties in its entirety. An award may not be annulled due to an incorrect application or interpretation of a body of law or a specific provision. In support of this, Hungary cites the recent decision of the *Duke Energy* annulment committee:9\n\nWhen a tribunal engages in interpretation of a written instrument of consent in light of the surrounding circumstances or in the context of other documents, its final construction of the meaning of the document in light of all the evidence and submissions of the parties is unlikely to amount to a manifest excess of powers. Interpretation, which leaves room for discussion [...], is not likely to give rise to a manifest excess of powers.\n\nA-CM, \u00b6 262, referring to *Duke Energy International Peru Investments No. 1 Ltd. v. Republic of Peru,* Decision on Annulment, 11 March 2011, \u00b6 160 *(Duke Energy\").*\n\n28.\n\nFinally, Applicants qualify their stated standard by citing the first annulment decision in *Vivendi v. Argentina,* where it was found that a failure to exercise jurisdiction must be outcome-determinative. In other words, the manifest non-exercise of jurisdiction must affect the outcome of the tribunal\u2019s inquiry in order to justify annulment.10\n\nA-A, \u00b6 95, referring to *Compa\u00f1\u00eda de Aguas del Aconquija SA and Vivendi Universal SA v. Argentine Republic,* Decision on Annulment, 3 July 2002, \u00b6 86 (\"*Vivendi I*\"*).*\n\n29.\n\nHungary, meanwhile, argues that an award cannot be annulled for having failed to decide such claims correctly. According to Hungary, a tribunal does not exceed its powers where its interpretation and conclusion are \"tenable\", \"adequately founded\" or merely \"the result of careful consideration\".11\n\nA-CM, \u00b6 250, referring *inter alia* to: *Kl\u00f6ckner IndustrieAnlagen GmbH and others v. United Republic of Cameroon and Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Camerounaise des Engrais,* Decision on Annulment, 3 May 1985, \u00b6 52(b) (\"*Kl\u00f6ckner I*\"*); Fraport AG Frankfurt Airport Services Worldwide v. Republic of the Philippines,* Decision on Annulment, 23 December 2010, \u00b6 112 (\"*Fraport*\"); *Duke Energy,* \u00b6 99; *CMS Gas Transmission Company v. Argentine Republic,* Decision on Annulment, 25 September 2007, \u00b6 85 (\"CMS\"); *Vivendi I,* \u00b6 89.\n\n(b) The ***ad hoc*** Committee\u2019s Analysis\n-----------------------------------------\n\n30.\n\nThe Committee shares the view put forward by Applicants in these proceedings, and noted by Professor Schreuer, that a tribunal may exceed its power by failing to exercise the jurisdiction which it possesses.12 As also noted by Hungary and Professor Schreuer, however, this notion \"relates to a deviation from the arbitration agreement and not to a quantitative concept of jurisdiction\".13 Whilst the precise boundaries of such a distinction may be difficult to discern, it is uncontroversial that such a non-exercise must be \"manifest\" in the sense of being somehow significant or consequential. Indeed, the Parties in the present case are in agreement that such a non-exercise must be \"result-determinative\". This approach was confirmed, *inter alia,* by the *Soufraki* annulment committee in the passage cited by Applicants.14\n\nC.H. Schreuer, *The ICSID Convention: A Commentary,* (2nd Edition, 2009, Cambridge), p. 938 (\"Schreuer\").\n\nSchreuer, p. 947.\n\nSee \u00b6 21.\n\n31.\n\nConcerning the meaning of \"manifest\", the Committee shares Professor Schreuer\u2019s view that the term relates to the ease with which an excess of powers is perceived, rather than its gravity, and that such an excess must be able to \"be discerned with little effort and without deeper analysis\".15 Such an approach is consistent with a manifest excess being one which is at once \"textually obvious and substantively serious\".16\n\nSchreuer, p. 938.\n\n*Soufraki,* \u00b6 40.\n\n32.\n\nThe Committee notes, however, that the practice of *ad hoc* committees is mixed as regards how to apply such a test. On the one hand, some committees have adopted a two-step approach: determining first whether there has been an excess of powers before going on to determine whether such excess was manifest. Others, on the other hand, have adopted a *prima facie* approach under which a summary examination is undertaken in order to ascertain if any alleged excess of powers was so egregious as to be manifest. To the extent these tests are not explicitly referred to, the Committee\u2019s findings below should be understood in light of the application of both tests. As will be shown below, the Committee\u2019s conclusions are in any case not dependent on such a distinction.\n\n33.\n\nFurther, the Committee notes that there is \"widespread agreement that a failure to apply the proper law may amount to an excess of powers by the tribunal\",17 the underlying basis being that the issues put to a tribunal are circumscribed by the parties\u2019 consent.18 The Committee takes note of the sparse yet well-known jurisprudence confirming this.19 However, the Committee again notes the importance of the distinction between *non-application* and mere *misapplication* of the applicable law. Whilst the precise boundaries of these concepts can be difficult to gauge, the Committee is mindful of the criticism that has been levelled against certain *ad hoc* committees for overstepping the line between annulment and appeal.20 The prevailing, and correct, view in modem investment jurisprudence must be understood as setting a very high threshold. As put by the *Soufraki* annulment committee:21\n\nMisinterpretation or misapplication of the proper law may, in particular cases, be so gross or egregious as substantially to amount to failure to apply the proper law. Such gross and consequential misinterpretation or misapplication of the proper law which no reasonable person (\"*bon p\u00e8re de famille*\") could accept needs to be distinguished from a simple error - or even a serious error - in the interpretation of the law which in many national jurisdictions may be the subject of ordinary appeal as distinguished from, e.g., an extraordinary writ of *certiorari.*\n\nSchreuer, p. 955.\n\nSchreuer, p. 958, referring to *Soufraki* \u00b6 37.\n\nFor instance, *Maritime International Nominees Establishment v. Republic of Guinea,* Decision on Annulment, 14 December 1989 (\"*MINE*\"); *Kl\u00f6ckner I.*\n\nSchreuer, p. 960.\n\n*Soufraki,* \u00b6 86.\n\n34.\n\nThe Committee therefore notes that in order to annul the Award under Article 52(1)(b) for a manifest excess of the Tribunal\u2019s powers consisting of a failure to apply the applicable law, at the very least something more than a \"serious error\" is required.\n\n35.\n\nFinally, the Committee considers that annulment for non-application of the applicable law is only sustainable where there has been a failure to apply the proper law *in toto*. As Professor Schreuer notes, this is because a finding of partial non-application of the applicable law *(i.e.* relating to a specific provision) is indistinguishable from a finding of erroneous application, the latter constituting appellate review for which the Committee has no competence.22\n\nSchreuer, p. 964.\n\nB. Article 52(1)(e): Failure to State Reasons\n---------------------------------------------\n\n(a) Summary of the Parties\u2019 Positions\n-------------------------------------\n\n36.\n\nApplicants submit that under Article 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention, a tribunal\u2019s failure to state reasons will justify annulment if its reasoning is \"impossible to follow, essentially missing in a key respect, or if it contains *lacunae* which render the analysis unintelligible\".23\n\nA-A,\u00b651.\n\n37.\n\nApplicants elaborate on the requisite standard of reasoning for annulment of ICSID awards with reference to various decisions of previous *ad hoc* committees. For instance, *in MINE,* the *ad hoc* committee stated that an award:24\n\nMust enable the reader to follow the reasoning of the Tribunal on points of fact and law... the requirement to state reasons is satisfied as long as the award enables one to follow how the Tribunal proceeded from Point A. to Point B. and eventually to its conclusion, even if it made an error of fact or law. This minimum requirement is in particular not satisfied by either contradictory or frivolous reasons.\n\n*MINE,* \u00b6 5.09.\n\n38.\n\nIn this connection, in their written submissions Applicants rely on the decision in *MINE* in arguing that an award may be annulled if it contains \"frivolous\" reasoning even if it is not contradictory.\n\n39.\n\nApplicants also cite *Vivendi I,* where the *ad hoc* committee stated that:25\n\nAnnulment under Article 52(1)(e) should only occur in a clear case. This entails two conditions: first, the failure to state reasons must leave the decision on a particular point essentially lacking in any expressed rationale; and the second, that point must itself be necessary to the tribunal\u2019s decision.\n\n*Vivendi I,* \u00b6\u00b6 64-65.\n\n40.\n\nApplicants submit that sufficient *lacunae* in reasoning to warrant annulment may be found to exist where a tribunal has: (i) given genuinely contradictory reasons on a material point; or (ii) failed to deal with a necessary question and thus rendered its award unintelligible.26\n\nA-A, \u00b6 54.\n\n41.\n\nHungary makes four main arguments regarding the applicable legal standards under Article 52(1)(e).\n\n42.\n\nFirst, Hungary submits that an award may be annulled for a \"complete absence of reasons\", although this is extremely unlikely since applicants face a very heavy burden of proof in this respect and *ad hoc* committees may not be drawn into reviewing the merits of a tribunal\u2019s decision. Furthermore, a tribunal is not required to substantiate every legal principle relied upon in its award and its reasoning need not be explicit. It is sufficient that a careful reader can follow an award\u2019s implicit reasoning.27\n\nA-CM, \u00b6 228, referring to *Duke Energy,* \u00b6 162\n\n43.\n\nSecond, Hungary does not contest that the *ad hoc* committee in *Kl\u00f6ckner* v. *Cameroon* held that an award may be annulled if it gives genuinely contradictory reasons on a material point. However, it also notes that subsequent *ad hoc* committees have found the scope of this principle to be limited to where such contradictory reasons \"cancel each other out\". Again, this ground requires a high threshold and must be carefully distinguished from review of the merits.28\n\nA-CM, \u00b6\u00b6 233-234, referring, *inter alia,* to the *ad hoc* committees\u2019 decisions in *Vivendi I* and *Duke Energy**.*\n\n44.\n\nThird, Hungary argues that an award may be annulled where there is a failure to answer an outcome-determinative question which leads to a failure of intelligibility of a tribunal\u2019s reasoning. In this context, Respondent distinguishes between \"questions\" and \"arguments\" - arguing that whilst the former requires an explicit or implicit response from a tribunal, the latter does not. According to Respondent, such \"questions\" must have been squarely presented to the tribunal during the underlying proceedings, and must be objectively understood as crucial or decisive issues, the acceptance of which would have altered the tribunal\u2019s conclusions. Hungary submits that even if AES succeeds in presenting such a question, it still faces a heavy burden in proving that the Tribunal failed to deal with it since it may have been dealt with implicitly.\n\n45.\n\nFinally, Hungary refutes AES\u2019s submissions concerning \"frivolous\" reasons. Primarily, this is because to allow such grounds would constitute an impermissible assessment of the quality of the Tribunal\u2019s reasoning.29\n\nA-CM, \u00b6\u00b6 240 - 244.\n\n(b) The ***ad hoc*** Committee\u2019s Analysis\n-----------------------------------------\n\n46.\n\nAs a preliminary remark, the Committee notes that arbitral tribunals are under a fundamental obligation to provide a reasoned award. As stated by the *ad hoc* committee in *Wena:*30\n\nThis requirement is based on the Tribunal\u2019s duty to identify, and to let the parties know, the factual and legal premises leading the Tribunal to its decision.\n\n*Wena,* \u00b6 79.\n\n47.\n\nOf all the grounds of annulment listed in Article 52(1) of the ICSID Convention, it is the failure to state reasons that holds the greatest danger of overlapping with an inadmissible review of the merits. As Professor Schreuer notes:\n\nIt is difficult to determine with any degree of objectivity what standard of reasoning should be held sufficient by an *ad hoc* committee. Of all the grounds for annulment, an evaluation of the tribunal\u2019s reasoning is most likely to blend into an examination of the award\u2019s substantive correctness and hence to cross the border between annulment and appeal.31\n\nSchreuer, pp. 997-998.\n\n48.\n\nIn light of the above, the Committee recognises that application of this ground of annulment must be made within parameters which characterise a failure to state reasons as opposed to a failure to state convincing or good reasons. Indeed, as submitted by Hungary and explained by Professor Schreuer:32\n\nThe duty to state reasons refers only to a minimum requirement. It does not call for tribunals to strain every sinew in an attempt to convince the losing party that the decision was the right one.\n\nSchreuer, p. 997; A-CM \u00b6 225.\n\n49.\n\nNevertheless, there are certain circumstances in which annulment on these grounds will be permissible. The clearest example is where there is a total absence of reasons for the award. This, however, is \"extremely unlikely\".33 As put by the *Soufraki* annulment committee, \"there will probably never be a case where there is a total absence of reasons for the award\".34\n\nSchreuer, p. 998.\n\n*Soufraki,* \u00b6 122.\n\n50.\n\nIn *Kl\u00f6ckner I,* the *ad hoc* committee found the tribunal\u2019s reasoning to be sufficiently defective to warrant annulment of the award, stating that:35\n\n\"...[t]he Award in no way allows the *ad hoc* Committee or for that matter the parties to reconstitute the arbitrators\u2019 reasoning in reaching a conclusion that is perhaps ultimately perfectly justified and equitable (and the Committee has no opinion on this point) but is simply asserted or postulated instead of being reasoned.\n\nThe complaint must therefore be regarded as well founded, to the extent that it is based on Article 52(1)(e).\"\n\n*Kl\u00f6ckner I,\u00b6* 144.\n\n51.\n\nThe Committee is mindful that even in *Kl\u00f6ckner I,* the threshold for annulment was set very high since there had to be \"no way\" that the committee could reconstitute the tribunal\u2019s reasoning. Moreover, this decision has consistently come in for strong criticism. As Professor Schreuer notes:36\n\n*Ad hoc* committees have consistently confirmed that Art. 52(1)(e) does not permit any enquiry into the quality or persuasiveness of reasons. *Ad hoc* committees may be dissatisfied with the adequacy of reasons, but provided they meet the conditions set out in *MINE,* and confirmed in *Vivendi I,* there will not be grounds for annulment.\n\nSchreuer, p. 1011.\n\n52.\n\nIn view of the settled doctrine on this issue, the Committee again emphasises that it will not enter into an assessment of the merits of the dispute, either directly or indirectly.\n\n53.\n\nHowever, as the Parties agree, annulment may be permitted in the exceptional circumstance that a tribunal\u2019s reasons are so contradictory that they effectively amount to no reasons at all. As stated by the *ad hoc* Committee in *Vivendi I.37*\n\nIt is frequently said that contradictory reasons cancel each other out, and indeed, if reasons are genuinely contradictory so they might. However, tribunals must often struggle to balance conflicting considerations, and an *ad hoc* committee should be careful not to discern contradiction when what is actually expressed in a tribunal\u2019s reasons could be more truly said to be but a reflection of such conflicting considerations.\n\n*Vivendi I,* \u00b6 64.\n\n54.\n\nFinally, for the reasons discussed above, the Committee also takes the view that the giving of frivolous reasons will almost never amount to a failure to state reasons within the meaning of Article 52(1)(e), since this would impermissibly encroach into appellate territory. The better approach is to recognise that reasons which are sufficiently frivolous or absurd in nature would in effect amount to no reasons at all.38\n\nSchreuer, p. 997.\n\n**IV.** The Relevance of AES\u2019s Profitability\n--------------------------------------------\n\n55.\n\nApplicants argue that the Award should be annulled under Articles 52(1)(b) and 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention since the Tribunal failed to address the question of whether AES\u2019s historic profits were sufficiently excessive to justify Hungary\u2019s reintroduction of regulated pricing. They argue that the Tribunal failed to exercise its jurisdiction, meriting annulment under Article 52(1)(b), and failed to state reasons in support of its conclusions, meriting annulment under Article 52(1)(e).\n\n56.\n\nConcerning AES\u2019s fair and equitable treatment and non-impairment claims in the original arbitration, Applicants note the adoption by the Tribunal of the twopronged test enunciated in *Saluka v. Czech Republic39* The first prong of this test requires the identification of a rational policy goal aimed at addressing a matter of public interest. The second requires an assessment of the reasonableness of the measure adopted to implement the policy, including, as the Tribunal noted, the finding of a reasonable correlation between the policy objective and the impugned measure.\n\nAward, \u00b6 10.3.7.\n\n(a) Summary of the Parties\u2019 Positions\n-------------------------------------\n\n57.\n\nApplicants\u2019 primary argument under this heading relates to the Tribunal\u2019s application of the second prong of the *Saluka* test. They submit that having (incorrectly) found the regulation of luxury profits to be a rational policy, the Tribunal was obliged, yet failed, to make an assessment of AES\u2019s historic profitability and to determine whether or not it was in fact excessive.40 In this connection, they also argue that the Tribunal failed to determine the appropriate methodology and threshold for determining whether AES\u2019s profits were in fact excessive.\n\nA-A, \u00b6\u00b6 56-57; A-Ry, \u00b6\u00b6 7-8.\n\n58.\n\nAES also submits that the Tribunal was obliged to fulfil these steps since it found that Hungary\u2019s only rational policy goal was to address historically excessive profits, having previously considered and rejected various alternatives. They argue that the Tribunal therefore effectively rendered an award in the abstract without reference to the specific facts of the case, contrary to the requirements outlined by the tribunal in *Mondev**.*41 They further argue that it is impossible to tell how the Tribunal arrived at its conclusion that the implementation of the Price Decrees was \"reasonable, proportionate and consistent with the public policy\" without examining whether and to what extent Applicants in fact earned \"luxury profits\", and whether and to what extent the Price Decrees regulated those profits in a reasonable manner.42 As such, they submit that the Tribunal did not try to find a reasonable correlation between Hungary\u2019s policy objective and the adopted measures.43\n\nHearing on Annulment Transcripts (\"Tr.\"), Tr. p. 83:16-19; Tr. p. 138:19-21, referring to *Mondev International Ltd. v. U.S.A.,* Award, 11 October 2002, \u00b6 118 (\"*Mondev*\").\n\nA-A, \u00b6\u00b6 56-62.\n\nTr. p. 66:10-13, referring to Award, \u00b6 10.3.9.\n\n59.\n\nApplicants further submit that the issue of historic profitability was placed squarely before the Tribunal since the Parties submitted substantial arguments and (expert) evidence on the matter.44 They argue that the Tribunal nevertheless reached a summary conclusion without adequately assessing the evidence and behaved unreasonably in relying on the figures provided by Hungary which had been included in its draft pricing act.45\n\nA-Ry \u00b6\u00b6 10, 49-92, referring *inter alia* to the Parties\u2019 written submissions, Witness Statements of Mr. Horrocks (Applicants\u2019 Application for Annulment Exhibit AC-34 at \u00b6 21) and Mr. Lithgow (Respondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial on Annulment Exhibit ARE-08 at \u00b6\u00b6 37, 55), Respondent\u2019s expert reports by Navigant Consulting (AC-25, AC-26), First Expert Report of LECG (AC-20, submitted by Applicants).\n\nTr. p. 68:7-9, referring to Award \u00b6 10.3.36; A-Ry, \u00b6\u00b6 47, 108-116.\n\n60.\n\nFinally, Applicants submit that the Award must also be annulled under Article 52(1)(e) since the Tribunal\u2019s reasoning is contradictory as regards its identification of a rational policy objective under the first prong of the *Saluka* test. They submit that at one stage the Award states that forcing the power purchase agreement\u2019s (\"PPA\") renegotiations with the perspective to reduce capacities was not a rational policy objective, yet the Award later states that Hungary exercised lawful government authority to specifically deprive AES of its contractual rights with respect to the pricing mechanism. Applicants argue that these are genuinely contradictory reasons which cancel each other out in accordance with the prevailing legal standards and the decision of the *ad hoc* Committee in *Kl\u00f6ckner I*.46\n\nA-A, \u00b663; A-Ry, \u00b6\u00b647, 117-124, referring to Award, \u00b6\u00b6 10.3.12-10.3.14, 10.3.35.\n\n61.\n\nApplicants also argue that the Tribunal gave \"frivolous\" reasons in respect of this issue by dismissing Applicants\u2019 claims due to \"the absence of a specific commitment to the Claimants that administrative pricing was never going to be reintroduced\"47\n\nA-A, \u00b6 64, referring to Award, \u00b6 10.3.35.\n\n62.\n\nHungary refutes all of Applicants\u2019 claims and submits that the Tribunal was not required to express an independent view as to Applicants\u2019 actual historic profits in order to avoid an annullable error.48\n\nA-CM, \u00b6 332-338; A-Rj, \u00b6\u00b6 26-29.\n\n63.\n\nThe relevant legal question before the Tribunal, it claims, was whether the government acted reasonably based on the information available to it at the time, or whether its actions were based on prejudice, abuse, or discrimination.49 It argues that the Tribunal adequately examined these requirements before finding that Hungary had met its obligations.50\n\nA-CM, \u00b6 331.\n\nA-CM, \u00b6 313.\n\n64.\n\nIndeed, Hungary submits that it was this aspect of reasonableness, rather than historic profitability, which was the focus of AES\u2019s arguments in the original proceedings. Hungary therefore submits that AES has mischaracterised the issues before the Tribunal since the issue of historic profitability was not placed squarely before it.\n\n65.\n\nFurther, Hungary submits that tribunals in international arbitration are not obliged to address every single point argued before them.51 As stated by the *Enron* annulment committee, the Tribunal was only obliged to state \"its pertinent findings of fact, its pertinent findings as to the applicable legal principles and its conclusions in respect of the application of the law to the facts\".52\n\nA-Rj,\u00b631;Tr.pp.l49:24-150:3;Tr. p. 157:9-11.\n\n*Enron,* \u00b6 222.\n\n66.\n\nAlternatively, Hungary submits that the Tribunal made ample findings on profitability to resolve the dispute in sections 9 and 10 of the Award in respect of both the nature of the measures and their reasonableness. Its reasoning was relevant and could be easily followed \"from Point A to Point B\".53\n\nA-CM, \u00b6\u00b6 344-347, referring to Award, \u00b6\u00b6 9.3.42-9.3.73, 10.3.37-10.3.44.\n\n67.\n\nAs regards both prongs of the *Saluka* test, Hungary argues that the Tribunal\u2019s reasoning was neither contradictory nor frivolous. It acted appropriately in referencing the stated purpose of the legislation as provided by Hungary.54 The Tribunal\u2019s interpretation of these issues could not satisfy the extremely high threshold of being so untenable that it cannot possibly be supported by reasonable arguments.55 Hungary argues that AES uses the term \"frivolous\" as a synonym for \"deficient\" and thus is attempting to challenge the quality of the Tribunal\u2019s reasoning and reargue the merits of the case.56\n\nA-CM, \u00b6 322.\n\nA-CM, \u00b6 362.\n\nA-CM, \u00b6 355.\n\n(b) The ***ad hoc*** Committee\u2019s Analysis\n-----------------------------------------\n\n68.\n\nThe Committee has reached the conclusion that Applicants\u2019 claim is unfounded for the following reasons.\n\n69.\n\nConcerning the first prong of the *Saluka* test, the Tribunal set forth the standard that \"a rational policy is taken by a State following a logical (good sense) explanation and with the aim of addressing a public interest matter\".57 Having considered the various arguments presented to it, the Tribunal identified Hungary\u2019s aim in implementing regulated pricing as addressing the concern that \"profits enjoyed by the PPAs, in the absence of either competition or regulation, exceeded reasonable rates of return for public utility sales\".58 The Tribunal noted that Hungary \"was motivated principally by widespread concerns relating to [...] excessive profits earned by generators and the burden on consumers\".59 As such, the Tribunal concluded that \"it was a perfectly valid and rational policy objective for a government to address luxury profits\".60 The Committee is therefore unable to find, as argued by AES, that Hungary\u2019s sole objective was to address *historic* luxury profits.\n\nAward, \u00b6 10.3.8.\n\nAward, \u00b6 10.3.20.\n\nAward, \u00b6 10.3.31.\n\nAward, \u00b6 10.3.34.\n\n70.\n\nThe Committee is unable to accept Applicants\u2019 contention that the Tribunal employed contradictory or frivolous reasoning in coming to this conclusion.\n\n71.\n\nConcerning the second prong of the *Saluka* test, in determining whether the impugned measures taken by Hungary were reasonable, the Tribunal enunciated that there needs to be an appropriate correlation between the State\u2019s public policy objective and the measure adopted to achieve it, and that this had to do with the nature of the measure and the way it is implemented\".61\n\nAward, \u00b6 10.3.9.\n\n72.\n\nThe following paragraphs outline the Tribunal\u2019s approach in determining whether the measures taken by Hungary were reasonable, whereby it analysed the methodology followed by Hungary in adopting the price regulation measures.\n\n73.\n\nThe Tribunal first noted that the Hungarian Energy Office (\"HEO\") determined that a 7.1% return on assets constituted the relevant reasonable profit benchmark for generators in the non-competitive \"public utility\" sector of the electricity market.62 The Award notes that in 2006 Hungary reviewed all electricity generators\u2019 financial statements for the last available reporting period and set price caps in a manner that would cover each generator\u2019s actual costs and still produce a 7.1% return on assets.63 The Tribunal went on to note that having initially focused on profit capping, the Hungarian Ministry jettisoned a *post hoc* profit-sharing provision contained in the draft 2006 Price Decree, opting instead for a pricecapping model.64 In light of the foregoing, the Tribunal concluded that Hungary had not behaved in an arbitrary manner.65\n\nAward, \u00b6 9.3.47.\n\nAward, \u00b6 9.3.48.\n\nAward, \u00b6\u00b6 9.3.53-9.3.55.\n\nAward, \u00b6 9.3.70.\n\n74.\n\nFurther, the Tribunal noted that following introduction of the price-capping regime, generators were still able to attempt to achieve a return on assets higher than 7.1% during the course of the relevant cycle, until prices were realigned with costs at the beginning of the next cycle.66\n\nAward, \u00b6 9.3.57.\n\n75.\n\nThe Tribunal noted that only generators whose prior-year profits were already below a 7.1% return on assets were unaffected by the reintroduction of price regulation. As such, the pricing regime was not discriminatory since the effect on AES was the logical result of a uniform methodology that was applied equally to all generators, based on their differing assets and operating cost structures. AES had not received different treatment in comparison with other generators.67 Further, the Tribunal concluded that whilst regulated prices unquestionably reduced generator prices, they still permitted generators (including AES) to receive a reasonable return.68\n\nAward, \u00b6 10.3.50.\n\nAward, \u00b6\u00b6 10.3.4, 10.3.37, 10.3.44.\n\n76.\n\nThe Committee considers that the methodology followed by the Tribunal on this question was within the bounds of its discretion. A determination as to the alleged excessiveness of AES\u2019s profits was not required. The reintroduction of regulated pricing was prospective and based on sector-wide concerns. It did not single out AES. It applied to all generators with a return on assets of higher than 7.1%.69\n\nAward, \u00b6 9.3.48.\n\n77.\n\nFurther, having been presented at the hearing with expert evidence confirming the HEO\u2019s conclusions, the Tribunal opted to rely on the HEO\u2019s calculations instead of attempting to evaluate their substantive accuracy *de novo.* This was fully within the limit of the Tribunal\u2019s discretionary power.\n\n78.\n\nFor the same reasons as listed above, the Committee is also unable to find that the Tribunal\u2019s reasoning was either contradictory or frivolous. The Tribunal observed that it cannot be a reasonable measure for a state to force a private party to change or give up its contractual rights with respect to its production capacities. It found, however, that a state can exercise its legislative powers with respect to consumer protection against overly burdensome prices even if this has the consequence that private interests such as an investor\u2019s contractual rights are affected, as long as that effect is the consequence of a measure based on public policy that was not aimed solely at affecting those contractual rights.70 The Tribunal found that this was the case here. Hungary acted in furtherance of a distinct, legitimate objective.71 Indeed, the Tribunal explicitly stated that \"the decision was not made with the intention of affecting Claimants\u2019 contractual rights\".72 It is not the Committee\u2019s task to appraise the quality of the Tribunal\u2019s distinction and reasoning. It finds, however, that the distinction is understandable and thus neither contradictory nor frivolous.\n\nAward, \u00b6 10.3.13.\n\nAward, \u00b6\u00b6 10.3.20, 10.3.31.\n\nAward, \u00b6 10.3.30.\n\n79.\n\nFor the above reasons, the *ad hoc* Committee finds that Applicants\u2019 claims as to the alleged need for the Tribunal to make a finding as to AES\u2019s profitability, as well as its claims that the Tribunal did not find a rational policy goal on Hungary\u2019s part, must fail.\n\n**V.**  **AES\u2019s** Legitimate Expectations\n-----------------------------------------\n\n80.\n\nDuring proceedings before the Tribunal, in connection with the reintroduction of administrative pricing in 2006 and 2007, AES alleged a breach of the basic and legitimate expectations upon which they relied when making their investment, and consequently a violation of the fair and equitable treatment standards under the ECT. The Tribunal considered, however, that AES \"cannot legitimately have been led by Hungary to expect that a regime of administrative pricing would not be reintroduced under any circumstances during the term of the 2001 Tisza II PPA\".73\n\nAward, \u00b6 9.3.26.\n\n(a) Summary of the Parties\u2019 Positions\n-------------------------------------\n\n81.\n\nAES claims annullable error under both Articles 52(1)(b) and 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention.\n\n82.\n\nApplicants\u2019 main argument is that the Award must be annulled since the Tribunal failed to apply the applicable law regarding legitimate expectations by applying a non-existent \"absolute certainty\" standard.74 The impugned section of the Award states that:75\n\nIn 2001, there was a great probability that there would be no administrative pricing after 2004, but this does not equate to absolute certainty giving rise to internationally protected legitimate expectations.\n\nA-Ry, \u00b6 135; Tr. p. 9:9-17.\n\nAward, \u00b6 9.3.25.\n\n83.\n\nAES contrasts this alleged standard with the following test which, in its view, the Tribunal had earlier purported, yet ultimately failed, to apply:76\n\nThe enquiry therefore turns to whether: (a) there were government representations and assurances made or given to Claimants at that time, and upon which they relied, of the sort alleged; and (b) Hungary acted in a manner contrary to such representations and assurances.\n\nAward, \u00b6 9.3.17; Tr. pp. 33:5-14, 118:2-18.\n\n84.\n\nAs well as constituting a failure to apply the law since the \"absolute certainty\" standard simply does not exist in international law, AES submits that employing this standard constituted such an egregious error of law as to warrant annulment for failure to apply the proper law, and is so inherently contradictory and frivolous as to constitute a failure to state reasons.77\n\nTr. p. 129:24-25.\n\n85.\n\nAES further argues that the Tribunal failed to state reasons since, *inter alia,* it incorrectly cited the 1996 Information Memorandum despite its irrelevance in the context of the existence of expectations in 2001, and erroneously interpreted a letter from the Ministry of Economic Affairs, dated October 21, 1999.78\n\nA-A, \u00b6 81, referring to Award \u00b6\u00b6 9.3.19-9.3.20.\n\n86.\n\nFurther, according to AES, the Tribunal was presented with ample alternative authority which it could follow, or at least discuss, in its reasoning on legitimate expectations, yet failed to fulfil its obligation to give reasons for rejecting it. In particular, AES points to the general standards for legitimate expectations enunciated by the *Thunderbird Gaming* tribunal, and the three-stage test envisaged by the *Parkerings-Compagniet* tribunal.79\n\nA-Ry, \u00b6\u00b6 139-143; *International Thunderbird Gaming Corporation v. The United Mexican States,* Award, 26 January 2006 (\"*Thunderhird*\"); *Parkerings-Compagniet AS v. Republic of Lithuania,* Award, 11 September 2007 (\"*Parkerings-Compagniet*\" or \"*Parkerings*\").\n\n87.\n\nLastly, AES argues that the Award must be annulled since the Tribunal failed to state reasons for its finding that the absence of a \"Stabilization Clause\" and the presence of a \"Change of Law\" clause in the PPA and Settlement Agreement were legally significant.80\n\nA-A, \u00b6\u00b6 81-82, A-Ry \u00b6\u00b6 171-177.\n\n88.\n\nHungary refutes all of Applicants\u2019 claims and argues that the Tribunal acted entirely within its discretion.\n\n89.\n\nHungary submits that the reference to \"absolute certainty\" in the Award was not intended to be a self-contained legal standard. It argues that it was:81\n\nA non-essential sentence added after the Tribunal\u2019s clear explanation of the relevant standard, representations and assurances, and after its clear factual finding that the standard had not been met.\n\nTr. pp. 224:22-225:2.\n\n90.\n\nMoreover, since the Tribunal\u2019s reasoning would still stand even if the sentence on \"absolute certainty\" were stricken from the Award, it cannot constitute grounds for annulment. Nor is the reference to \"absolute certainty\" contradictory, since it was merely shorthand for the Tribunal\u2019s conclusion that an investor\u2019s subjective expectations do not give rise to legally-protected rights with regard to future government action.82\n\nA-CM, \u00b6 278.\n\n91.\n\nHungary further argues that Applicants\u2019 arguments pertain not so much to the absence of (sufficient) reasons, but to the substantive merits of the Tribunal\u2019s reasoning itself. In any case, argues Hungary, the Tribunal conducted a comprehensive analysis of the issue of legitimate expectations by examining whether any representations had been made in either 1996, 1999, or 2001.83\n\nTr. p. 217:13-19, referring to Award, \u00b6\u00b6 9.3.15, 9.3.20, 9.3.24-9.3.25, 9.3.31, 13.3.4.\n\n92.\n\nHungary submits that the Tribunal was not obliged to state reasons to substantiate every principle relied upon for its reasons. It notes that whilst the Tribunal was presented with multiple legal authorities on the relevant standards, it was not obliged to choose one over the other. The Tribunal was simply obliged to fulfil the test in *Enron,* as discussed above.84\n\nSee \u00b6 65.\n\n93.\n\nFinally, Hungary notes that the Committee in any case may not evaluate the substantive correctness of the Tribunal\u2019s decision. Therefore, even if the Tribunal had articulated a novel \"absolute certainty\" standard, it is outside of the Committee\u2019s jurisdiction to evaluate its correctness since this would constitute appellate review.\n\n(b) The ***ad hoc*** Committee\u2019s Analysis\n-----------------------------------------\n\n94.\n\nThe Committee has determined that Applicants\u2019 arguments are unfounded for the following reasons.\n\n95.\n\nRegarding the \"absolute certainty\" issue, the Committee is unable to find that the Tribunal has introduced a distinct legal standard which is invented, illogical or otherwise incorrect. As noted by Hungary, the reference only appears in the Award after the Tribunal found that, as a matter of law, in order to be legitimate and bind government conduct, an expectation has to be based on express governmental assurances and representations.85 The Tribunal then found, as a matter of fact, that AES failed to produce evidence of those assurances or representations.86\n\nAward, \u00b6 9.3.17.\n\nAward, \u00b6\u00b6 9.3.15, 9.3.20, 9.3.24-9.3.25.\n\n96.\n\nContrary to AES\u2019s submissions, the relevant section of the Award does not enunciate a self-contained standard.87 Its effect is to distinguish between probabilities which may be the basis for subjective expectations of an investor and binding obligations on a state under international law. Although AES may have subjectively believed that it was probable there would be no reintroduction of administrative pricing after 2004, absent any specific governmental assurance, there was no absolute legal certainty in this respect. The only assurance for the investor was that there would be a reasonable rate of return.88\n\nAward, \u00b6 9.3.25.\n\nAward, \u00b6 9.3.15.\n\n97.\n\nIn any case, determination of the legal test for legitimate expectations was within the Tribunal\u2019s discretion. Having determined that the reference to \"absolute certainty\" was not the creation of a new legal standard, the Committee does not, in principle, have to address AES\u2019s claim that the Tribunal did not apply the proper law. In this connection, the Committee notes the determination of the *Duke Energy* annulment committee that:\n\nThe obligation upon a tribunal... to apply [the applicable law] is a reference to the whole of that law, such as the tribunal may determine to be relevant and applicable to the issue before it, and not to any portion of it. [A party] may well disagree with the view that the tribunal formed as to the correct solution of the issue before it under [the applicable body of law] but an *ad hoc* committee may not enter upon an assessment of whether a tribunal made a correct assessment of the content of the applicable law.\n\n98.\n\nWhilst the Committee is mindful that in exceptional circumstances an error of law may be so egregious as to merit annulment, it does not consider this to be the case with respect to the Tribunal\u2019s reference to an \"absolute certainty standard\". The Committee does not therefore find it necessary to engage in an analysis of whether the Tribunal adopted the preferable legal test for legitimate expectations, be it under *Parkerings* or otherwise. This is all the more so, since the tribunal in *Parkerings* convincingly stated:89\n\nIt is evident that not every hope amounts to an expectation under international law...contracts involve intrinsic expectations from each party that do not amount to expectations as understood in international law.\n\n*Parkerings,* \u00b6 344.\n\n99.\n\nMoreover, the mere fact that a Tribunal does not follow the prevailing jurisprudence on a given issue is not an error of law *per se.* There is no system of binding precedent in ICSID jurisprudence. If one were to follow AES\u2019s theory, ICSID jurisprudence would be condemned to remain static and immutable, without the possibility of any evolution or innovative decisions.\n\n100.\n\nThe Committee also finds that the Tribunal did not fail to state reasons. For the sake of completeness, the Committee now summarises the reasoning employed by the Tribunal.\n\n101.\n\nIn its application of the legal standards to the facts, the Tribunal determined that legitimate expectations can only be created at the moment of investment.90\n\nAward, \u00b6\u00b6 9.3.8-9.3.12.\n\n102.\n\nIt then proceeded to consider whether AES had made investments in 1996 when AES Summit purchased the outstanding shares of Tisza, and in 2001 at the time AES Tisza actually began to invest in the Retrofit of the Tisza II Plant.91 It concluded that AES had made investments in both 1996 and 2001.92\n\nAward, \u00b6 9.3.13.\n\nAward, \u00b6\u00b6 9.3.14, 9.3.16.\n\n103.\n\nWith respect to 1996, the Tribunal concluded that:93\n\nAES Summit can have had no legitimate expectation at that time regarding the conduct of Hungary about which it now complains (i.e., the fact of, motivation for and methodology relating to the reintroduction of administrative pricing in 2006/2007). Both the privatization materials and the relevant investment agreements (the original Tisza II PPA and the 1996 PSA [Purchase and Sale Agreement]) were explicit that Hungary would continue to set maximum administrative prices for electricity sales indefinitely into the future. This was subject only to the principle that such pricing would provide a \"reasonable return\" on investment, which would \"target\" returns in the general range of 8% on equity for the first regulatory period beginning in 1997.\n\nAward, \u00b6 9.3.15.\n\n104.\n\nThe Tribunal reached the same conclusion with respect to 2001. Asking itself whether \"there were government representations and assurances made or given to Claimants at that time,\" it concluded that \"Hungary made no representations/gave no assurances of a nature that go to the heart of Claimants\u2019 complaint - i.e., that following the termination of price administration on 31 December 2003, regulated pricing would not again be introduced\".94\n\nAward, \u00b6\u00b6 9.3.17-9.3.18.\n\n105.\n\nHaving considered this issue, the Tribunal ultimately did not accept Claimants\u2019 reliance, in trying to establish the existence of legitimate expectations, on two statements found in the 1996 Industry Information Memorandum. The first statement concerned an 8% return on shareholder funds. The Tribunal found that this was simply a target rate of reasonable return for the first regulatory period. The second related to an alleged requirement for another overall price and costs review prior to the introduction of any new pricing mechanism. The Tribunal observed that this was made in the context of the HEO not expecting radical changes in Hungary\u2019s administrative pricing system. It further found that the statements did not relate in a sufficiently material way to Claimants\u2019 central complaint (the reintroduction of administrative pricing in 2006-2007). Therefore it could not find that Hungary\u2019s conduct in 2006-2007 was contrary to representations and assurances said to have been made to AES Summit in 1996.95\n\nAward, \u00b6 9.3.19.\n\n106.\n\nThe Tribunal then considered Claimants\u2019 reliance on Hungary\u2019s letter of 21 October 1999 from Mr. Pal Ligati (Head of Department, Ministry of Economic Affairs) which, AES argued, constituted an express promise not to interfere with the PPA, as well as a promise that the contractual pricing formula set out in the PPA would not be altered by political considerations. The Tribunal found that:96\n\n[The letter] does not say what Claimants said it does. Moreover, it predated the 2001 Tisza II PPA by approximately two years and no evidence was led to suggest that such a new PPA was then contemplated. The letter was written immediately before Claimants commenced the PSA and treaty arbitrations in 2000. Accordingly, the Tribunal does not consider it plausible that Claimants can be said to have relied on this assurance when, two years later, they entered into the 2001 Settlement Agreement and the 2001 Amendment Agreement.\n\nAward, \u00b6 9.3.20.\n\n107.\n\nThe Tribunal further considered that \"the language of the 2001 Settlement Agreement does not, as alleged, constitute a specific promise by Hungary not to frustrate the purpose and intent of the 2001 Settlement Agreement by the reintroduction of administrative pricing\",97 and that \"no specific commitments were made by Hungary that could limit its sovereign right to change its law (such as a \"Stability Clause\") or that could legitimately have made the investor believe that no change in the law would occur\".98\n\nAward, \u00b6 9.3.24.\n\nAward, \u00b6 9.3.31.\n\n108.\n\nFurther, the Tribunal found that \"the 2001 Settlement Agreement introduced a \u2018Change of Law\u2019 provision... into the Original Tisza II PPA\" which allocated the risks among AES and MVM (Maggar Villamos M\u00fcvek Z\u00e1rtk\u00f3r\u00ed\u00eden M\u00fak\u00f3d\u00f3 R\u00e9szv\u00e9nyt\u00e1rsas\u00e1g) of \"a change in law... during the now extended term of the PPA\".99 Later in the Award, it noted that \"neither the 2001 Settlement Agreement, nor the 2001 PPA, contemplated that pricing regulation could not be reintroduced. The PPA only stipulated that if the administrative pricing disappeared specific formulas would be applied\".100\n\nAward, \u00b6 9.3.25.\n\nAward, \u00b6 13.3.4.\n\n109.\n\nIn light of these considerations, the Tribunal concluded that \"Claimants cannot legitimately have been led by Hungary to expect that the regime of administrative pricing would not be reintroduced under any circumstances during the term of the 2001 Tisza II PPA\".101\n\nAward, \u00b6 9.3.26.\n\n110.\n\nThe Committee cannot accept Applicants\u2019 argument that the Tribunal failed to state reasons either for rejecting AES\u2019s preferred *Parkerings-Compagniet* test, or more generally, for finding an absence of legitimate expectations.\n\n111.\n\nIn accordance with several previous awards, the Tribunal decided that the correct test was whether there were government representations and assurances made or given to Claimants at the time of the investment and upon which they relied, of the sort alleged and whether Hungary acted in a manner contrary to such representations and assurances. There was no requirement that the Tribunal, in adopting this standard, should explain why it preferred such a test over any other. Moreover, the Tribunal\u2019s reasoning can be easily followed \"from Point A to Point B\", in accordance with the *MINE* standards.\n\n112.\n\nThe Committee also rejects Applicants\u2019 argument that the Tribunal\u2019s reference to the \"Change of Law\" clause in the 2001 Settlement Agreement was frivolous, in effect being treated as a waiver of AES\u2019s rights to fair and equitable treatment under the ECT.102\n\nA-Ry,\u00b6171.\n\n113.\n\nAs explained above, an Award may only be annulled for giving \"frivolous\" reasons in the exceptional event that they amount to no reasons at all.103\n\nSee \u00b6 54.\n\n114.\n\nSince the Tribunal had already found that no legitimate expectations existed, there could not be any waiver. It was only after it had made this finding that the Tribunal pointed out that the \"Change in Law\" provision had been introduced into the original Tisza II PPA by the 2001 Settlement Agreement.104\n\nAward, \u00b6 9.3.25.\n\n115.\n\nFor the Tribunal, the \"Change in Law\" provision was further evidence that the Parties were aware that future legal changes could affect the PPA. This was already clear in the PPA which defined law as including \"all acts of the Hungarian parliament, as well as other governmental or ministerial decrees as might be issued *from time to time*\".105\n\nAward, \u00b6 9.3.25 (emphasis added).\n\n116.\n\nThe Committee therefore rejects AES\u2019s claim that the Tribunal failed to state reasons for finding the absence of a stabilization clause or the presence of a change of law clause to be legally significant.\n\n117.\n\nIn summary, therefore, the Committee finds that all of AES\u2019s arguments on legitimate expectations must fail.\n\n**VI.** Due Process\n-------------------\n\n118.\n\nIn claiming unfair and inequitable treatment by Hungary before the Tribunal, AES relied both on the irrational and unreasonable character of Hungary\u2019s decision to reintroduce administrative pricing as well as the arbitrary and unfair manner in which it was implemented.106 The Tribunal found that since it had concluded that there was nothing so irrational or unreasonable in Hungary\u2019s reintroduction of administrative prices as would constitute unfair and inequitable treatment, and AES\u2019s investment had not been impaired by unreasonable or discriminatory measures, it would limit its analysis of AES\u2019s due process claims to the manner and methodology by which the Price Decrees were brought into force. It would do so with a view to assessing whether \"process\" failures existed that constituted a failure to provide fair and equitable treatment.107\n\nAward, \u00b6 9.3.36.\n\nAward, \u00b6\u00b6 9.3.37-9.3.38.\n\n119.\n\nThe Tribunal referred to the decision of the *Tecmed* tribunal in enunciating the applicable legal standard:108\n\nIt is not every process failing or imperfection that will amount to a failure to provide fair and equitable treatment. The standard is not one of perfection. It is only when a State\u2019s acts or procedural omissions are, on the facts and in the context before the adjudicator, manifestly unfair or unreasonable such as would shock, or at least surprise a sense of juridical propriety... that the standard can be said to have been infringed.\n\nAward, \u00b6 9.3.40, referring to *Tecnicas Medioambientales Tecmed SA v. The United* *Mexican States,* Award, 29 May 2003, \u00b6 154 *(''Tecmed').*\n\n120.\n\nThe Tribunal ultimately concluded that it did not believe that the process of implementing the Price Decrees was so flawed as to amount to a breach of the fair and equitable standards of the ECT.109\n\nAward, \u00b6 9.3.41.\n\n(a) Summary of the Parties\u2019 Positions\n-------------------------------------\n\n121.\n\nApplicants submit that in making the above determinations, the Tribunal failed to adequately assess Hungary\u2019s conduct in determining that the Price Decrees had been issued in accordance with due process and procedural propriety. AES submits that these are errors which warrant annulment of the Award under Article 52(1)(e) in their own right.\n\n122.\n\nFirst, AES alleges that the Tribunal failed to provide reasons for its finding that Hungary\u2019s arbitrarily short timeframe for implementation of the Price Decrees did not constitute a due process violation.110 AES submits that a gap in the Tribunal\u2019s logic exists since it failed to step back from its analysis of the HEO\u2019s individual actions in implementing the Price Decrees and take account of the fact that the deadlines were imposed on the HEO by the Ministry of Economy.111 The Tribunal therefore examined the conduct of the HEO to the exclusion of the Ministry of Economy or indeed Hungary as a whole.112\n\nA-Ry, \u00b6\u00b6 181-185.\n\nA-Ry, \u00b6 183.\n\nA-Ry, \u00b6 182.\n\n123.\n\nSecond, AES alleges that \"the Tribunal\u2019s finding on Hungary\u2019s failure to fully review AES\u2019s costs and assets before establishing prices under the Price Decrees is contradictory and frivolous\".113 The alleged contradiction is based, according to AES, on the fact that:114\n\nThe Tribunal... concedes that even though no costs and assets review took place in the third cycle, the HEO accepted AES\u2019s costs as reflected in its own financial statements *\"precisely as it had done for the second price cycle with which the Claimants have no complaint.*\" AES had no complaint about the second price cycle because it included the *very feature* it complained was missing from the third: a full costs and assets review. Obviously, if the third cycle did not include a costs and assets review, as the Tribunal conceded, then it cannot be said that Hungary carries out the third cycle regulatory process *\"precisely as it had done for the second cycle\".*\n\nA-Ry,\u00b6186.\n\nA-Ry, \u00b6 190, referring to Award, \u00b6 9.3.72 (emphasis in original).\n\n124.\n\nRegarding \"frivolity\", AES submits, *inter alia,* that the Tribunal\u2019s reasoning was frivolous because it accepted without any explanation that the non-performance of a costs review was justified by the short time frame that the Hungarian Ministry had in mind to enact the Price Decrees.\n\n125.\n\nHungary refutes Applicants\u2019 claims.\n\n126.\n\nIt argues that the alleged shortcomings in the Tribunal\u2019s reasoning only pertain to one facet of Hungary\u2019s conduct in relation to the procedure for the enactment of the Price Decrees. In order to establish grounds for annulment, AES would need to prove that the Award is silent on the claim as a whole, rather than simply one given aspect of it.115 In its written submissions, Hungary cites the following passage from the decision of the *Helnan* annulment committee:116\n\n[Article 52(1)(e)] permits annulment on the ground \"that the award has failed to state the reasons on which it is based. Thus, the object of this ground is the reasoning which leads to the Tribunal\u2019s Award. It does not permit annulment simply because the tribunal has not determined it necessary to discuss every argument raised by one of the parties.\n\nA-CM, \u00b6 366; A-Rj, \u00b6 99.\n\nA-Rj, \u00b6 99, referring to *Helnan International Hotels AS v. Arab Republic of Egypt,* Decision on Annulment, 14 June 2010, \u00b6 36 (\"*Helnan*\").\n\n127.\n\nAlternatively, Hungary argues that, in order to merit annulment the issue in question would in any case need to have been an \"essential question\" that could have changed the outcome of the case.117 This, Hungary submits, was not the case.\n\nA-CM,\u00b6368.\n\n(b) The ***ad hoc*** Committee\u2019s Analysis\n-----------------------------------------\n\n128.\n\nThe Committee considers that Applicants\u2019 claims are unfounded.\n\n129.\n\nWith respect to Applicants\u2019 first claim, the Tribunal found that on 11 May 2006, the HEO sent each generator a draft text of the 2006 Price Decree, soliciting comments on its proposed approach by 18 May 2006.118 AES submitted its comments on this date in accordance with the HEO\u2019s (admittedly short) deadline. AES then amended its comments, four days later, on 22 May 2006. The Tribunal found that these amended comments were substantive, detailed and led to changes to the draft 2006 Price Decree.119\n\nAward, \u00b6 9.3.49.\n\nAward, \u00b6 9.3.50.\n\n130.\n\nThe Tribunal went on to note that the HEO next met with AES on 31 May 2006 to discuss possible changes to the draft.120 The HEO subsequently presented the draft to the Ministry on 2 June 2006, including a summary table of the principal comments that had been received from the generators (including AES).121\n\nAward, \u00b6 9.3.51.\n\nAward, \u00b6 9.3.52.\n\n131.\n\nSeveral changes were thereafter made to the draft, including elimination of the original *post hoc* profit sharing provision as requested by a number of generators, including AES.122\n\nAward, \u00b6\u00b6 9.3.53-9.3.55.\n\n132.\n\nThe Arbitral Tribunal concluded that although there were several procedural shortcomings in Hungary\u2019s implementation of the Price Decrees (the most obvious being the short deadline to submit comments) none was sufficient to constitute unfair and inequitable treatment.123 The Tribunal considered that having been informed by the HEO no later than November 2005 that the HEO considered a 7.1% return on assets to be an appropriate rate of return, AES had been sufficiently forewarned to enable it to respond to the HEO\u2019s letter of 11 May 2006 within this timeframe. AES had not found it necessary to seek an extension. It further took the opportunity to supplement and amend its comments four days later. These late amendments were accepted as timely by the HEO, and were ultimately acted upon through Hungary\u2019s elimination of the proposed *post hoc* profit-sharing provision.124\n\nAward, \u00b6 9.3.66.\n\nAward, \u00b6\u00b6 9.3.67-9.3.70.\n\n133.\n\nIn light of the Tribunal\u2019s analysis, as described above, the Committee is unable to find that Applicants\u2019 claim that the Tribunal failed to specifically address the role of the Ministry of Economy in setting the time frame is well-founded. Moreover, the Committee does not see in what way such an omission would have been result-determinative.\n\n134.\n\nApplicants\u2019 claim in the original proceedings was based on one single sentence in their post-hearing brief to the effect that \"Hungary has never explained its self-imposed May deadline that appears arbitrary considering that the 2006 Price Decree was not issued until 24 November\".125\n\nAES\u2019s Post-Hearing Submission, \u00b6 78.\n\n135.\n\nIn the Committee\u2019s view, this argument barely required a response by the Tribunal given the limited degree of prominence with which it was advanced by AES in the original proceedings.126 Much less can it be regarded as \"outcome-determinative\".\n\nSee *Continental Casualty Company v. Argentina,* Decision on Annulment, 16 September 2011, \u00b6 129 (\"*Continental Casualty*\").\n\n136.\n\nWith respect to Applicants\u2019 second complaint, AES submits that the Tribunal did not make any independent findings on the issue of Hungary\u2019s alleged failure to perform a full costs and assets review during the implementation of pricing-regulation. Instead, AES argues, the Tribunal merely \"recited Hungary\u2019s unhelpful explanation that it was \u2018impractical\u2019 to perform a full costs review in the timeframe that the Ministry \u2018had in mind\u2019\".127\n\nA-Ry, \u00b6 186.\n\n137.\n\nIn dealing with this question, the Tribunal was, by its own admission, greatly assisted by the testimony of Mr. B\u00e9k\u00e9s, head of the Electricity Office Preparation Department of the HEO at the time. The Tribunal found that his evidence described \"a not culpably unreasonable implementation process in relation to the Price Decrees\".128 Mr. B\u00e9k\u00e9s was not cross-examined. His testimony on the relevant process was contradicted neither by competing testimony, nor by contrary documentation.\n\nAward, \u00b6 9.3.42.\n\n138.\n\nSpecifically, Mr. B\u00e9k\u00e9s testified that for a number of reasons, it was impractical for the HEO to perform a detailed bottom up cost review for the generators in early 2006.\n\n139.\n\nThere was therefore no reason for the Tribunal to make any other independent findings on the issue that Hungary had failed to perform a full costs and assets review during implementation of the pricing regulation.\n\n140.\n\nThe Committee is also unable to find that the Tribunal\u2019s reasoning is contradictory. As discussed above, such a contradiction must amount to the Tribunal having effectively given no reasons at all.129 In light of the Tribunal\u2019s reasoning described above, the Committee is unable to contemplate annulment of the Award on this basis. To do so would impermissibly cross the line into appellate review.\n\nSee \u00b6 53.\n\n141.\n\nIn any event, the Tribunal properly found that AES had not been denied due process with respect to a costs review, a determination of assets review, or a further opportunity for a price review.\n\n142.\n\nConcerning the costs review, the Tribunal acknowledged that no such audit took place during the third pricing cycle. It concluded, however, that \"HEO\u2019s decision not to follow this practice at this time was not unfair to AES... because HEO accepted AES\u2019s costs as reflected in AES\u2019s 2004 and 2005 own financial statements as supplied to HEO\".130\n\nAward, \u00b6\u00b6 9.3.71-9.3.72.\n\n143.\n\nWith respect to the asset review, the Tribunal noted that the HEO\u2019s return-on-assets calculations were based on the book value of assets as reported in AES\u2019s financial statements. This methodology was identical to that employed in the second pricing cycle (with which Claimants had no complaint).131 The Tribunal also found that \"because Claimants do not fault the first two cycles, it is relevant to their allegation of procedural failings that each and every of the three cycles were somewhat similar\".132\n\nAward, \u00b6 9.3.72.\n\nAward, \u00b6 9.3.44.\n\n144.\n\nIf Claimants considered that costs were not included that should have been, they could have asked for a price review. However, they did not. The Tribunal stated as follows:133\n\nThe March 2006 amendments to the 2001 Electricity Act (that provided for the reintroduction of administrative prices) did not affect its existing provisions which allow generators to petition for individual price review. Mr. B\u00e9k\u00e9s testified that AES Tisza did not submit a request for price review during the relevant review period applicable to the Price Decrees.\n\nAward, \u00b6 9.3.64.\n\n145.\n\nOn the basis of the Tribunal\u2019s reasoning as described above, under the prevailing legal standards the Committee considers it impossible to conclude that Claimants\u2019 complaint that the Tribunal\u2019s reasoning on due process was frivolous or contradictory is well founded.\n\n**VII.** Stable Conditions\n--------------------------\n\n146.\n\nIn the original proceedings, the Tribunal found that Hungary had not violated its obligation under Article 10(1) of the ECT to \"encourage and create stable, equitable, favourable and transparent conditions for Investors\".\n\n(a) Summary of the Parties\u2019 Positions\n-------------------------------------\n\n147.\n\nAES requests annulment of the Award since, it alleges, the Tribunal failed to give positive content to the applicable legal standards under Article 10(1) of the ECT. It argues that \"by characterizing the legal standard only by what it is not, the Tribunal gave frivolous reasons for its decision on this issue which requires annulment under Article 52(1)(e) of the Convention\".134 It argues further that \"this error constitutes a manifest excess of power under Article 52(1)(b) in that the Tribunal failed to exercise its jurisdiction by not making any findings on the abundant record on profitability\".135\n\nA-Ry, \u00b6 195.\n\nA-Ry, \u00b6 131.\n\n148.\n\nApplicants also argue that whilst the Tribunal purported to deal with the scope of this obligation by reference to the factual circumstances in the case, the Award is in fact concerned exclusively with Hungary\u2019s sovereign right to change its law in the abstract, without specific consideration of the reintroduction of regulated prices in the relevant context.136\n\nA-A, \u00b691.\n\n149.\n\nFurther, AES submits that since the Tribunal made no affirmative findings as to the legal test that it should apply to the facts of the case before it, it has disregarded the applicable law. This disregard of the applicable law, AES argues, is manifest insofar as it is both serious and obvious.\n\n150.\n\nHungary, for its part, submits that throughout the original proceedings, Applicants used the phrase \"stable legal and business framework\" as shorthand for all of Hungary\u2019s obligations under Article 10(1) - that is, including the obligation to provide both stable conditions and fair and equitable treatment. Hungary submits that in the Award, the Tribunal responded to the question that had been presented to it, and found that the ECT\u2019s \"stable conditions\" provision is not a stability clause preventing a sovereign entity from changing its laws. This approach, Hungary argues, is consistent with the findings of previous tribunals.137\n\nA-CM, \u00b6\u00b6 295-297, 304.\n\n151.\n\nHungary further submits that the Tribunal could not find a specific commitment by Hungary that could mandate obedience to a given framework. Rather, the Tribunal held that the business framework (the 2001 Electricity Act, 2001 Settlement Agreement and PPA Amendment) in itself contemplated changes. Moreover, Hungary submits that the Tribunal made specific findings about the extent and nature of the changes that occurred in this case, which were directly relevant to its finding that Hungary did not violate the ECT.138\n\nA-CM, \u00b6\u00b6 298-302.\n\n152.\n\nIn any event, as discussed above with reference to the applicable legal standards,139 it is Hungary\u2019s position that whilst the Tribunal\u2019s interpretation of the ECT\u2019s \"stable conditions\" provisions may not have been definitive or exhaustive, Article 52(1)(b) only requires that the Tribunal interpret the correct \"body of law\" and respond to the claims before it.140\n\nSee \u00b6 29.\n\nA-CM, \u00b6 312.\n\n(b) The ***ad hoc*** Committee\u2019s Analysis\n-----------------------------------------\n\n153.\n\nThe Committee considers that Applicants\u2019 claims are unfounded.\n\n154.\n\nIn the Committee\u2019s view, the Tribunal did, in fact, give positive content to the standard. It stated that:141\n\nTo determine the scope of the stable conditions that a State has to encourage and create is a complex task given that it will always depend on the specific circumstances that surrounds [sic] the investor\u2019s decision to invest and the measures taken by the State in the public interest.\n\nAward, \u00b6 9.3.30.\n\n155.\n\nFurthermore, the Tribunal applied the law to the facts in stating that:142\n\nIn this case however, the Tribunal observes that no specific commitments were made by Hungary that could limit its sovereign right to change its law (such as a stability clause) or that could legitimately have made investors believe that no change in the law would occur.\n\nAward, \u00b6 9.3.31.\n\n156.\n\nThe Tribunal then went on to state that: \"Specifically, the 2001 Settlement Agreement and the 2001 PPA did not [contemplate] that after 2004 no reintroduction of regulated pricing could take place\".143 The Tribunal noted that \"Moreover, it is clear from clause 3.7 of the 2001 PPA that the parties to the agreement were aware that a change in the law could occur that could make the obligations under the agreement become illegal, unenforceable or impossible to perform\".144\n\nAward, note 39.\n\nAward, \u00b6 9.3.32.\n\n157.\n\nThe Tribunal also carefully examined the specific circumstances surrounding the measures taken by the State in the public interest and noted that a pricing regime in the third period did not significantly differ from those in the earlier cycles.145 The fact that these findings are contained in various other sections of the Award is irrelevant. Under the prevailing legal standards recently enunciated by the *Continental Casualty* annulment committee:146\n\nIn determining whether the reasons given for a conclusion on a particular question are sufficient, is it [sic] necessary not to look in isolation at the particular paragraphs of the award dealing specifically with that question. Those paragraphs must always be read together with the award as a whole.\n\nAward, \u00b6\u00b6 9.3.44, 9.3.56, 9.3.72, 10.3.44.\n\n*Continental Casualty, \u00b6* 261.\n\n158.\n\nIt was therefore entirely rational for the Arbitral Tribunal to decide that in these circumstances, \"absent a specific commitment from Hungary that it would not reintroduce administrative pricing during the term of the 2001 PPA, Claimants cannot properly rely on an alleged breach of Hungary\u2019s Treaty obligations to provide a stable legal environment\".147\n\nAward, \u00b6 9.3.34.\n\n159.\n\nApplicants\u2019 contentions under this heading therefore fall short of proving a manifest excess of the Tribunal\u2019s powers, and must accordingly be rejected.\n\n**VIII.** Legality Under Hungarian and **EU** Law\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n160.\n\nIn its Award the Tribunal had summarized Claimants\u2019 position as to applicable law to the effect that \"the parties to this arbitration made a clear choice as to the applicable law and that choice does not include Community competition law or Hungarian law\".148 It had concluded, based on Article 41(2) of the ICSID Convention and Article 26(6) of the ECT that, as agreed by the parties, \"the applicable law to this proceeding is the ECT, together with the applicable rules and principles of international law\".149\n\nAward, \u00b6 7.3.1.\n\nAward, \u00b6 7.6.4.\n\n(a) Summary of the Parties\u2019 Positions\n-------------------------------------\n\n161.\n\nApplicants claim annulment of the Award under both Articles 52(1)(b) and 52(1)(e) because, they submit, the Tribunal failed entirely to address its claim that Hungary\u2019s measures were in breach of both Hungarian law and EU law.\n\n162.\n\nThey argue that this presents a significant *lacuna* in the Tribunal\u2019s reasoning, constituting a failure to address an essential question and warranting annulment under Article 52(1)(e).150 They stress the importance of such a determination since the evidential weight of such a determination was \"crucial to a fulsome determination of whether [Hungary\u2019s] policy goal was rational\".151 They submit that:152\n\nThe policy\u2019s compliance with the law is a *factor* in determining its rationality. Were the Tribunal to have determined that Hungary\u2019s actions were illegal under one or both legal regimes, that determination would have had substantial weight in adjudicating the rationality of Hungary\u2019s proffered policy goal.\n\nA-Ry,\u00b6 208.\n\nA-Ry, \u00b6 206; A-A, \u00b6\u00b6 75-77.\n\nA-Ry, \u00b6 206 (emphasis in original).\n\n163.\n\nApplicants further contend that the Tribunal\u2019s finding that Hungary pursued a legitimate policy objective cannot amount to an implicit rejection of its claim concerning the illegality of the Price Decrees.153\n\nA-A, \u00b676.\n\n164.\n\nThey submit that the question of legality under Hungarian and EU law was a significant issue in the original proceedings, having been raised at the hearing and having received substantial attention in their written submissions.154 According to AES, the evidential weight that such a finding would have had renders the issue outcome-determinative.\n\nA-Ry, \u00b6 202, referring to AES\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 33.\n\n165.\n\nHungary argues that contrary to Applicants\u2019 submission that a rational or legitimate policy goal can only be found where a State\u2019s actions fully comply with national law and EC secondary legislation (in the case of EU Member States), neither of these issues was essential to the proper resolution of the claim before the Tribunal.155 Respondent does not dispute that the Award does not discuss issues of Hungarian law or EC Liberalization Directives, which were \"the only components of EC law Claimants alleged had been violated\".156 In any case, it submits that AES\u2019s argument mischaracterises the way in which the issue was presented to the Tribunal.157\n\nA-CM, \u00b6 375.\n\nA-CM, \u00b6 377.\n\nA-CM, \u00b6 379, referring to Tr. p. 76:22-77:9.\n\n166.\n\nHungary submits that AES\u2019s argument must fail since: (i) the legal standard adopted by the Tribunal did not contain the \"local law\" legality element that Applicants argue was essential;158 (ii) confirmation of the legality of a state\u2019s actions under domestic law cannot be understood empirically as a prerequisite to finding that a state acted pursuant to a rational or legitimate policy goal under international law;159 and (iii) Applicants\u2019 complaint that the Tribunal failed to accord determinative weight to Applicants\u2019 evidence on this issue does not provide a valid basis for annulment, since tribunals are free to address only those arguments which they regard as particularly pertinent.\n\nA-CM, \u00b6 389, referringto Award \u00b6\u00b6 9.3.40, 10.1.1, 10.3.8, 10.3.13, 10.3.23.\n\nA-CM, \u00b6\u00b6 393-395.\n\n(b) The ***ad hoc*** Committee\u2019s Analysis\n-----------------------------------------\n\n167.\n\nThe Committee considers that Applicants\u2019 claims are unfounded.\n\n168.\n\nIn its written submissions on the merits, AES itself argued that the only applicable law was the ECT and the applicable rules and principles of international law under Article 26(6) of the ECT.160 Indeed, the Tribunal found that AES said that \"Community law is irrelevant to the interpretation of the ECT, and that assertions to the contrary ignore the basic principles of treaty interpretation\".161\n\nAward, \u00b6 7.3.1.\n\nAward, \u00b6 7.3.2.\n\n169.\n\nThe Tribunal further found that:162\n\nThis is... said to be so given that Community law, including Community competition law, is considered the equivalent of internal or municipal law for the purposes of this proceeding. Community law is thus merely a fact to be considered by the Tribunal when determining the applicable law.\n\nAward, \u00b6 7.3.4.\n\n170.\n\nHaving considered the Parties\u2019 arguments on this point, the Tribunal concluded, as already stated, that \"the applicable law to this proceeding is the ECT, together with the applicable rules and principles of international law\" *(i.e.* excluding domestic Hungarian law).163\n\nAward, \u00b6 7.6.4.\n\n171.\n\nAs mentioned above, the Tribunal adopted the standard that a \"rational policy is taken by a State following a logical (good sense) explanation and with the aim of addressing a public interest matter\".164 The key point, as submitted by Hungary, is that a tribunal has a wide discretion to formulate and apply the relevant enquiry under the treaty standard.165 Such a determination is not open to appeal.\n\nSee \u00b6 69, referring to Award, \u00b6 10.3.8.\n\nA-Rj, \u00b6 128.\n\n172.\n\nThe Committee notes that the majority of the Tribunal found that Hungary\u2019s decision to reintroduce administrative pricing was not motivated by pressure from the EC Commission. However, the majority found that \"had Hungary been motivated to reintroduce price regulation with a view to addressing the EC\u2019s state aid concerns, there is no doubt that this would have constituted a rational public policy measure\".166\n\nAward, \u00b6 10.3.16.\n\n173.\n\nAs discussed above, the Tribunal arrived at the conclusion that \"it is a perfectly valid and rational policy objective for a government to address luxury profits\".167\n\nAward, \u00b6 10.3.34.\n\n174.\n\nThe Tribunal therefore was not required to evaluate the legality of Hungary\u2019s reintroduction of regulated pricing under Hungarian or EU law, since this was not part of its adopted standard.\n\n175.\n\nIn any case, as discussed at length above, an error of law is not a valid basis for annulment. It is not open to AES or the *ad hoc* Committee to challenge the correctness of the standards applied by the Tribunal. Further, a tribunal is not required to address every argument invoked by a party if it considers that this argument is not essential in deciding the issue before it.\n\n176.\n\nApplicants\u2019 claim for annulment of the Award on the above grounds must therefore also fail.\n\n**IX.** Costs\n-------------\n\n177.\n\nUnder Article 61(2) of the ICSID Convention and Rule 47(1) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules, read in conjunction with Article 52(4) of the ICSID Convention and Rule 53 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules, the *ad hoc* Committee has discretion to determine how and by whom the costs and expenses of ICSID, the Committee and the Parties should be borne.\n\n178.\n\nThe Parties submitted their respective submissions on costs on 17 March 2012.\n\n179.\n\nApplicants seek to recover their legal costs and expenses incurred in connection with this annulment proceeding, amounting to GBP 474,156.54. Hungary requests that the Committee issue an \"appropriate\" award of costs and fees in light of its decision. Hungary\u2019s legal costs and expenses amount to USD 920,427.04. The Committee finds both parties\u2019 cost submissions reasonable within the meaning of Rule 28(2) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules.\n\n180.\n\nIn accordance with Regulation 14(3)(e) of the ICSID Administrative and Financial Regulations, Applicants have been \"solely responsible for making the advance payments requested by the Secretary-General to cover expenses following the constitution of the Committee\". This is without prejudice to the Committee\u2019s final decision on cost allocation.\n\n181.\n\nIn its decision on the allocation of costs the Committee has been guided, as other committees and tribunals before it, that \"costs follow the event\" if no specific circumstances impose a different approach. Such circumstances do not exist here. Not only has Hungary prevailed in totality but the application for annulment was clearly without merit. Hungary was forced to go through the process and should not be burdened further by having to pay for its defence. This notwithstanding, the Committee recognises that both parties and their counsel have conducted the proceedings diligently and efficiently.\n\n182.\n\nIn weighing these criteria, the Committee concludes that the Applicants are to bear all ICSID costs, *i.e.* the fees and expenses of the members of the *ad hoc* Committee and of the ICSID Secretariat, amounting to USD 350,000.00168 as well as Hungary\u2019s legal costs and expenses amounting to USD 920,427.04.\n\nThe amount includes estimated charges (courier, printing, and copying) in respect of the dispatch of this Decision. The ICSID Secretariat will provide the Parties with a detailed financial statement of the case account as soon as all of the invoices are received and the account is final.\n\n**X.**  **Decisions**\n---------------------\n\n1. For the foregoing reasons, the *ad hoc* Committee decides unanimously that:\n\n(1) Applicants\u2019 claims for annulment under Article 52(1)(b) and Article 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention are dismissed in their entirety;\n\n(2) Applicants shall bear the full costs and expenses incurred by ICSID in these annulment proceedings, including fees and expenses of the arbitrators.\n\n(3) Applicants shall bear Hungary\u2019s legal expenses and costs."}]}
