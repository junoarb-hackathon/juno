PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND**\n----------------------------\n\n**A. Request for Arbitration**\n------------------------------\n\n1.\n\nOn 19 October 2007, the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (\"ICSID\") received a request for arbitration dated 16 October 2007 (the \"Request\") from SGS Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale de Surveillance S.A. (\"SGS\" or \"Claimant\") against the Republic of Paraguay (\"Paraguay\" or \"Respondent\") (collectively, the \"Parties\").\n\n2.\n\nThe Request was made under the Agreement on the Promotion and Reciprocal Protection of Investments between Switzerland and Paraguay signed 31 January 1992 and entered into force 28 September 1992 (the \"BIT\" or the \"Treaty\"), and the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States (\"ICSID Convention\" or \"Convention\").\n\n**B. Notice of Registration**\n-----------------------------\n\n3.\n\nOn 19 November 2007, the Deputy Secretary-General of ICSID sent Claimant and Respondent a Notice of Registration in accordance with Article 36(3) of the ICSID Convention.\n\n4.\n\nIn issuing the Notice, the Deputy Secretary-General invited the Parties to proceed to constitute an Arbitral Tribunal as soon as possible in accordance with Rule 7(d) of the Centre\u2019s Rules of Procedure for the Institution of Conciliation and Arbitration Proceedings.\n\n**C. Appointment of Arbitrators**\n---------------------------------\n\n5.\n\nOn 30 January 2008, Claimant requested, in accordance with Rule 2(3) of the Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings (\"Arbitration Rules\"), that the Arbitral Tribunal be constituted in accordance with the provisions of Article 37(2) (b) of the Convention. This letter was acknowledged by a letter from ICSID to the Parties of the same date. It was accordingly confirmed that: (1) the Tribunal would consist of three arbitrators; (2) one arbitrator would be appointed by each Party and the third, the president of the Tribunal, would be appointed by agreement of the Parties; and (3) the appointments would follow the procedures set out in Rule 3 of the Arbitration Rules.\n\n6.\n\nBy letter of 31 January 2008, Claimant appointed Mr. Donald Francis Donovan, Esq., a national of the United States of America, as a member of the Tribunal. On 31 March 2008, Respondent appointed Dr. Pablo Garc\u00eda Mexia, a national of Spain. No objections were raised to either appointment.\n\n7.\n\nOn 20 February 2008, the Parties having failed to reach agreement on the appointment of the President of the Tribunal, Claimant requested the appointment of the third, presiding arbitrator by the Chairman of the ICSID Administrative Council as provided for in Article 38 of the Convention and Rule 4(1) of the Arbitration Rules.\n\n8.\n\nBy letter of 20 May 2008, the Chairman of the ICSID Administrative Council appointed Dr. Stanimir A. Alexandrov, a national of Bulgaria, as the third arbitrator and president of the Tribunal. No objections were raised to this appointment.\n\n9.\n\nThe Tribunal was officially constituted on 27 May 2008, in accordance with the Convention and ICSID Arbitration Rules. Mr. Gonzalo Flores, Senior Counsel, ICSID, was initially designated to serve as the Secretary of the Tribunal. On 16 April 2009, the Acting Secretary General informed the Tribunal that due to the redistribution of the Centre\u2019s workload, Dr. Sergio Puig de la Parra, ICSID, would serve as the new Secretary of the Tribunal.\n\n**D. Objections of Respondent to Jurisdiction**\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n10.\n\nOn 8 April 2008, Respondent delivered its Memorial with Objections to Jurisdiction to the Centre, an electronic copy of which was transmitted to Claimant on 10 April 2008.\n\n11.\n\nRespondent filed a further document on the question of jurisdiction dated 26 June 2008 during the first session of the Tribunal on 30 June 2008 (discussed below).\n\n12.\n\nThe submissions of 8 April 2008 and 26 June 2008 were confirmed by Respondent to together constitute Respondent\u2019s Memorial on Jurisdiction.\n\n**E. First Session**\n--------------------\n\n13.\n\nThe first session of the Tribunal was held on 30 June 2008 at the seat of the Centre in Washington, D.C. At the session the Parties expressed their agreement that the Tribunal had been properly constituted in accordance with the relevant provisions of the ICSID Convention and the Arbitration Rules. The Parties also agreed upon a number of procedural matters reflected in written minutes signed by the President and the Secretary of the Tribunal\n\n14.\n\nAt the first session, the Tribunal heard the Parties\u2019 proposals for handling the objections to jurisdiction raised in Respondent\u2019s Memorial on Jurisdiction. It was agreed that the proceedings on the merits would be suspended as envisaged in Article 41(2) of the ICSID Convention and Arbitration Rule 41(3).\n\n15.\n\nThe following procedural calendar was agreed for the preliminary phase of the proceedings:\n\n- Claimant would submit its Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction by Monday, 22 September 2008; Respondent would submit its Reply on Jurisdiction by Monday, 15 December 2008; and Claimant would submit its Rejoinder on Jurisdiction by Monday, 23 February 2009;\n\n- a pre-hearing conference would be held on 9 March 2009;\n\n- a hearing on jurisdiction would then be held at the seat of the Centre in Washington, D.C., from 6 April 2009 through 8 April 2009.\n\n16.\n\nBy letter of 11 December 2008 Respondent subsequently requested an extension of time to respond to Claimant\u2019s Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction. Claimant consented to this extension of time by a letter dated 15 December 2008. The revised schedule was agreed as follows:\n\n- Respondent would submit its Reply on Jurisdiction by Monday, 29 December 2008, and Claimant would submit its Rejoinder on Jurisdiction by Monday, 9 March 2009;\n\n- the hearing on jurisdiction would be held as originally scheduled, from 6 April 2009 through 8 April 2009.\n\n17.\n\nBy letter of 20 March 2009 Respondent requested the adjournment of the hearing on jurisdiction until May, due to the hearing date\u2019s proximity to Holy Week observances. Claimant objected to such a delay by letter of the same date. By letter of 24 March 2009 the\n\nTribunal advised the Parties that the hearing would take place on the originally scheduled date (6 April), noting that that date had been set with the consent of the Parties at the 30 June 2008 first session and had been re-confirmed by both Parties in their letters of 11 and 15 December 2008.\n\n18.\n\nAs the Parties had agreed on procedures to be followed for the hearing on jurisdiction in their letters of 20 March 2009, no pre-hearing conference was necessary.\n\n**F. Hearing on Respondent\u2019s Objections to Jurisdiction**\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n19.\n\nThe hearing on Respondent\u2019s Objections to Jurisdiction was held in Washington, D.C., on 6 April 2009, the Parties having agreed that the additional reserved dates (7 and 8 April) were not needed.\n\n20.\n\nThe Parties were represented as follows:\n\nClaimant\n\nMr. Paul Friedland, Mr. Mark Luz, Mr. Rafael E. Llano Oddone & Mr. Damien Nyer, White & Case LLP Mr. Nicolas Gr\u00e9goire, SGS\n\nRespondent\n\nDr. Jos\u00e9 Enrique Garcia Avalos, Attorney General of the Republic of Paraguay Mr. Ra\u00fal Sapena, Counsel to the Treasury of the Republic of Paraguay\n\nMr. Jorge Brizuela, Embassy of the Republic of Paraguay in Washington, D.C.\n\nMr. Pedro Espin\u00f3la Vargas Pe\u00f1a, Advisor to the Executive Director, the World Bank\n\nMr. Agust\u00edn Saguier Abente, Saguier Abente Law Firm\n\nMr. Brian C. Dunning & Ms. Irene R. Dubowy, Thompson & Knight LLP\n\n21.\n\nMessrs. Garc\u00eda and Dunning and Ms. Dubowy addressed the Tribunal on behalf of Respondent. Mr. Friedland addressed the Tribunal on behalf of Claimant. The jurisdictional hearing was audio recorded and a verbatim transcript in English and Spanish was prepared and delivered to the Parties.\n\n**G. Further Submissions**\n--------------------------\n\n22.\n\nOn 9 June 2009, Respondent wrote to draw the Tribunal\u2019s attention to the decision on jurisdiction rendered on 29 May 2009 in the case of Bureau *Veritas, Inspection, Valuation, Assessment and Control, BIV AC B.V v. Republic of Paraguay,* ICSID Case No. ARB/07/9.1 The Tribunal granted both Parties leave to file brief post-hearing submissions limited to the relevance of the *BIVAC* decision to arguments already put forward by the Parties in the present case. Respondent made its filing by letter dated 3 July 2009, with Claimant following suit by letter dated 23 July 2009.\n\n*Bureau Veritas, Inspection, Valuation, Assessment and Control, BIVAC B.V. v. Republic of Paraguay,* ICSID Case No. ARB/07/9, Decision of the Tribunal on Objections to Jurisdiction, 29 May 2009 *(\"BIVAC v. Paraguay,* Decision on Jurisdiction\").\n\n23.\n\nThe Tribunal has deliberated and considered carefully all of the Parties\u2019 written submissions on jurisdiction as well as the oral arguments that were delivered in the course of the jurisdictional hearing. In the following sections, the Tribunal will briefly summarize the factual background, so far as it is necessary to rule on Respondent\u2019s preliminary objections (Section II), and address some preliminary considerations relevant to jurisdiction (Section III). It will then turn first to Respondent\u2019s objections based on specific jurisdictional limitations of the BIT and the ICSID Convention (Section IV), and next to Respondent\u2019s objections that Claimant has not stated proper claims under the Treaty over which we could exercise jurisdiction (Section V). Finally, the Tribunal will address the issue of costs (Section VI) and set forth its decision on jurisdiction (Section VII).\n\n**II. FACTUAL BACKGROUND**\n--------------------------\n\n**A. The Contract**\n-------------------\n\n24.\n\nBased on the submissions of the Parties, the Tribunal understands the events surrounding the dispute to be as follows. Except where characterized as the allegation of one Party or the other, the following facts are understood to be undisputed.\n\n25.\n\nClaimant is a Swiss company providing, *inter alia,* certification services based on preshipment inspections of goods. The inspections are typically carried out in the country of export, resulting in certifications that are used by governmental authorities of an importing country, *eg.,* in collecting import duties and taxes.\n\n26.\n\nThis dispute concerns a contract entered into between SGS and the Ministry of Finance of Paraguay. Under the contract, SGS was to perform pre-shipment inspection and certification services for cargoes destined for Paraguay.\n\n27.\n\nThe Ministry of Finance of Paraguay was authorized by Presidential Decree No. 12311 of 31 January 1996 (Ex. C-6) to enter into contracts with two companies, SGS and Bureau Veritas International (\"BIVAC\"), for pre-inspection services. On 6 May 1996, SGS and Paraguay\u2019s Ministry of Finance signed the Contract for Technical Services Involving Pre-Shipment Inspection of Imports (\"the Contract\") (Ex. C-4). Services under the Contract were to begin on 15 July 1996, and the Contract had an initial duration of three years.2 According to the Contract, the purpose of the Contract was the optimization of tax collection volume and the improvement of the mechanisms for controlling compliance with the tax obligations relating to import transactions.3\n\nArts. 8.1.1 & 8.2, Contract (Ex. C-4).\n\n\"El Ministerio, con el objeto de optimizar el volumen de las recaudaciones impositivas y mejorar los mecanismos para el control del cumplimiento de las obligaciones tributarias referidas a las operaciones de importaci\u00f3n, ha decidido establecer un Programa de Inspecci\u00f3n de Pre-Embarque...Para la ejecuci\u00f3n del Programa de Servicios T\u00e9cnicos de Inspecci\u00f3n a ser prestados en el exterior, se ha decidido contratar a dos empresas especializadas, por su experiencia, idoneidad y alta calificaci\u00f3n en la prestaci\u00f3n de este tipo de Servicios T\u00e9cnicos con Gobiernos de otros pa\u00edses, que garanticen el cumplimiento de presente Programa.\" Preamble, Contract (Ex. C-4) (emphasis omitted).\n\n28.\n\nSGS established a liaison office in Asunci\u00f3n, as well as two smaller offices in Ciudad del Este and Encarnaci\u00f3n, Paraguay, and carried out inspections of goods in the ports of origin.\n\nAccording to Claimant, Paraguay\u2019s Ministry of Finance paid SGS\u2019s invoices for the period between July 1996 and February 1997, but no payment was made for the March 1997 invoice or the invoices that followed thereafter (with the exception of one payment). SGS continued to conduct pre-inspection services, however. Respondent does not dispute that payment was not made on some number of SGS\u2019s invoices, although it contests whether all amounts were owed and raises questions as to whether nonpayment was justified or excused.\n\n29.\n\nOn 24 February 1999, the Ministry of Finance informed SGS of its intent to terminate the Contract pursuant to Article 8.2, which allows either party to choose not to renew the Contract with four months\u2019 notice prior to the expiration of the Contract\u2019s original term (or any renewal term). Subsequently, on 1 June 1999, representatives of the Ministry of Finance and SGS met. According to SGS, which points to correspondence following the meeting, the Ministry of Finance and SGS mutually agreed to terminate the Contract by June 7, 1999.\n\n30.\n\nSGS made repeated requests for payment on the outstanding invoices, which remain unpaid to date. SGS contends that at different points in time, various Paraguayan officials acknowledged Paraguay\u2019s obligation to make payment to SGS. Paraguay and its agencies initiated a number of investigations into the validity of the Contract and the services performed under it.\n\n**B. Relevant Contractual Provisions**\n--------------------------------------\n\n31.\n\nAccording to Article 2.1 of the Contract, SGS was to carry out the physical inspection of goods prior to shipment in their country of origin, and determine whether the goods submitted to inspection corresponded to the importer\u2019s declaration. Article 2.2 required SGS to verify the price invoiced by the seller and establish whether it fell within reasonable limits. SGS was then to provide its opinion on the customs value of the imported goods, under Article 2.3. Under Article 2.4, SGS was also to provide a recommendation for the tariff classification of the goods, and under Article 2.6, SGS was to establish the country of origin of the goods. Upon completion of the verification process, based on its findings, SGS was to issue an Inspection Certificate or Discrepancy Report to the General Customs Department of Paraguay under Article 2.8. Under Articles 2.9 and 2.10, SGS agreed to provide Paraguay with training programs for General Customs Department officials, to provide technical assistance and advice, and to contribute to the implementation of a Data Bank based upon the information contained in the Inspection Certificates.\n\n32.\n\nThe Contract also provided, under Article 3.4, that SGS would receive at its liaison office in Paraguay, for each commercial transaction, an Inspection Request from the importer and accompanying documentation.\n\n33.\n\nIn exchange for the performance of SGS\u2019s obligations, according to Article 4, Paraguay agreed to pay SGS, in United States Dollars, a fee amounting to 1.3% of the FOB value of the goods shown in the Inspection Certificate or in the Discrepancy Report. A minimum US$ 280 fee would be applicable where the rate of 1.3% would produce a smaller fee amount.\n\n34.\n\nArticle 9, concerning dispute resolution *(soluci\u00f3n de conflictos),* provided that \"[a]ny conflict, controversy or claim deriving from or arising in connection with this Agreement, breach, termination or invalidity, shall be submitted to the Courts of the City of Asunci\u00f3n under the Law of Paraguay.\"4\n\n\"Cualquier conflicto, controversia o reclamo que se derive o se produzca en relaci\u00f3n al presente Contrato, incumplimiento, resoluci\u00f3n o invalidez, deber\u00e1 ser sometido a los Tribunales de la Ciudad de Asunci\u00f3n seg\u00fan la Ley Paraguaya.\" Art. 9.1, Contract (Ex. C-4).\n\n35.\n\nFinally, with regard to termination, Article 7.1 provided that either party could terminate the Contract by reason of non-compliance. Article 7.2 allowed the Ministry of Finance to unilaterally terminate the Contract on grounds of opportunity, merit or convenience, caused by or related to the public interest, with 120 days\u2019 notice. Article 8.2 provided that the Contract\u2019s original three-year term could be renewed unless either party notified the other in writing of its intention not to extend the Contract beyond the originally agreed upon or renewal term, and did so at least four months before the expiration of that term.\n\n**III. PRELIMINARY CONSIDERATIONS**\n-----------------------------------\n\n36.\n\nBefore proceeding to consider Respondent\u2019s various objections to this Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction to hear Claimant\u2019s claims, it will be helpful to address certain general considerations that guide the Tribunal\u2019s analysis.\n\n**A. Relevant Texts**\n---------------------\n\n37.\n\nClaimant\u2019s case is premised on alleged acts and omissions by Respondent that, according to Claimant, violate Respondent\u2019s obligations under the BIT. Necessarily, therefore, the Tribunal will look first to the text of the BIT itself. Jurisdiction under the BIT is founded on Article 9, which provides, \"for purposes of solving disputes with respect to investments between a Contracting Party and an investor of the other Contracting Party,\" that \"[i]f...consultations do not result in a solution within six months from the date of request for settlement, the investor may submit the dispute either to the national jurisdiction of the Contracting Party in whose territory the investment has been made or to international arbitration. In the latter event, the investor has the choice between\" ICSID and *ad hoc* arbitration under the UNCITRAL rules.\n\n38.\n\nHere, Claimant having elected ICSID arbitration under BIT Article 9(2)(a), Article 25 of the ICSID Convention is also applicable to the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdictional inquiry. Article 25 provides, in pertinent part:\n\n(1) The jurisdiction of the Centre shall extend to any legal dispute arising directly out of an investment, between a Contracting State...and a national of another Contracting State, which the parties to the dispute consent in writing to submit to the Centre....\n\n39.\n\nArticle 9(6) of the BIT specifies that:\n\n[t]he arbitral tribunal shall decide on the basis of the present Agreement [i.e., the BIT] and other relevant agreements between the Contracting Parties; of the terms of any particular agreement that may have been concluded with respect to the investment; of the law of the Contracting State party to the dispute, including its rules on the conflict of laws; of such principles and rules of international law as may be applicable.\n\n40.\n\nAmong the applicable principles and rules of international law will be the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (both Switzerland and Paraguay having ratified the Convention), and in particular the principles of treaty interpretation set forth in Articles 31-33 thereof.\n\n41.\n\nBoth Parties have also drawn the Tribunal\u2019s attention to the decisions of other investment treaty tribunals, where helpful to their arguments, to contend that this Tribunal should or should not come to similar conclusions on similar questions. It is of course clear that there is no rule of *stare decisis* in investment treaty arbitration, that each Tribunal has its own mandate and competence, and that the decisions of prior tribunals in other cases are not binding on us in any respect. However, we find it appropriate to consider the reasoning of and conclusions reached by such tribunals, and to assess their persuasive force in the particular circumstances presented in this case before us.\n\n42.\n\nFor the sake of the coherent and reasoned development of investment law, it is likewise appropriate in many cases to articulate where and why we do or do not follow the approaches of other tribunals, particularly on issues where prior tribunals\u2019 approaches have diverged. Such discussions are all the more likely in this case, where the Parties have made heavy reference to two prior investment treaty cases involving SGS contracts for preshipment inspection services\u2014 *SGS v. Pakistan*5 and *SGS v. Philippines6\u2014* and where there has now emerged a decision on jurisdiction in another investment treaty case\u2014 *BIVAC v. Paraguay* \u2014involving Paraguay\u2019s contract for such services on terms claimed to be \"substantially similar, if not identical\"7 to the Contract between SGS and Paraguay in this case.\n\n*SGS Sati\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale de Surveillance SA. v. Islamic Republic of Pakistan,* ICSID Case No. ARB/01/13, Decision of the Tribunal on Objections to Jurisdiction, 6 August 2003 (\" *SGS v. Pakistan,* Decision on Jurisdiction\").\n\n*SGS Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale de Surveillance SA. v. Republic of the Philippines,* ICSID Case No. ARB/02/6, Decision of the Tribunal on Objections to Jurisdiction, 29 January 2004 *(\"SGS v. Philippines,* Decision on Jurisdiction\").\n\nRespondent\u2019s Letter to the Tribunal, 9 June 2009 (regarding *BIVAC v. Paraguay* Decision on Jurisdiction).\n\n**B. Standards at the Jurisdictional Stage**\n--------------------------------------------\n\n43.\n\nAt this stage of the proceedings, the Tribunal has before it only the Parties\u2019 arguments on jurisdiction and a limited evidentiary record, reflecting the extent to which the Parties have seen fit to address factual matters at this time. Accordingly, lacking a full presentation of the Parties\u2019 claims, defenses, and evidence at this preliminary, jurisdictional stage, the Tribunal must take care to give the proper treatment to the Parties\u2019 factual allegations and legal arguments.\n\n44.\n\nThe Parties both invoked the now-familiar notion that, for purposes of determining whether Claimant has stated a BIT claim over which the Tribunal has jurisdiction, the Tribunal should consider whether the facts alleged by Claimant, if proven, could give rise to a violation of the Treaty. For example, referring to certain claims of SGS, Respondent argued in its Reply that this Tribunal \"need not take this claim at face value. Rather, it should consider if the facts asserted by SGS are capable of being regarded as breach of the B.I.T.\"8 Respondent contended that Claimant has failed to allege facts that would amount to a breach of the BIT, as required to pass jurisdictional muster on such a *prima facie* standard. In turn, Claimant, quoting the opinion of its legal expert, argued that:\n\n[a]t the jurisdictional threshold, the [C]laimant need only establish that, *assuming* the truth of the facts alleged, those facts **could** violate the provisions of the treaty at issue. Conversely, the Claimant need *not,* for jurisdictional purposes, prove the fact[s] alleged. Nor need the [C]laimant establish that were it ultimately to prove those facts, they necessarily *would* violate the relevant treaty. It suffices for jurisdiction if the facts, the truth of which must be presupposed, **could** violate the treaty.9\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply to Claimant\u2019s Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, 29 December 2008 (\"Respondent\u2019s Reply\"), at para. 105.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, 9 March 2009 (\"Claimant\u2019s Rejoinder\"), at para. 87 (quoting Reisman Opinion at para. 7) (emphasis in original).\n\n45.\n\nAt the hearing on jurisdiction, Claimant confirmed its position that the Tribunal should take as true *all* facts asserted by Claimant: not only those facts that go to the sufficiency of the claims as stated, but also those facts that may be necessary for the determination of the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction under the BIT and the ICSID Convention.10\n\nTranscript, Hearing on Jurisdiction, 6 April 2009 at 65:10 to 67:9; *see also* Reisman Opinion at para. 34.\n\n46.\n\nIn the Tribunal\u2019s view, however, it is necessary to distinguish the two inquiries. The question of what standard the Tribunal should apply at the jurisdictional stage in addressing facts relevant to whether a claimant has adequately stated its claims and can proceed to the merits is different from the question of the standard for findings of fact necessary to establish jurisdiction.\n\n47.\n\nIt is well accepted that, at the jurisdictional stage, Claimant need not prove the facts that it alleges in order to state a claim over which this Tribunal has jurisdiction. All Claimant needs to do is to allege facts that, if proven at the merits stage, could constitute a violation of Treaty protections. That is, absent exceptional circumstances,11 the Tribunal will evaluate whether the acts and omissions of Respondent, taken as they are alleged by Claimant, are capable of making out a Treaty violation\u2014leaving it to the merits stage for Claimant to prove those allegations.\n\nFor example, the tribunal in *Amco* left room to depart from this approach in the event of \"manifest or obvious misdescription or error in the characterization of the dispute by the Claimants.\" *Amco Asia Corp. v. Republic of Indonesia,* ICSID Case No. ARB/81/1, Decision on Jurisdiction, 25 September 1983, at para. 38.\n\n48.\n\nThis is the oft-quoted approach of Judge Higgins\u2019 separate opinion in the ICJ\u2019s *Oil Platforms* case: a tribunal should \"accept *pro tern* the facts as alleged by [the claimant] to be true and in that light to interpret [the treaty] for jurisdictional purposes \u2014 that is to say, to see if on the basis of [the claimant\u2019s] claims of fact there could occur a violation of one or more of [the treaty provisions].\"12\n\n*Case Concerning Oil Plaforms (Islamic Republic of Iran v. United States of America),* 1996 I.C.J. 803 *(\u2018Oil Plaformf,* Separate Opinion of Judge Rosalyn Higgins at para. 32.\n\n49.\n\nMany investment treaty tribunals have echoed this approach.13 As the tribunal observed in *SGS v. Pakistan,* \"we consider that if the facts asserted by Claimant are capable of being regarded as alleged breaches of the BIT, consistently with the practice of ICSID tribunals, the Claimant should be able to have them considered on their merits.\"14 This approach was succinctly expressed by the tribunals in *Impregilo v. Pakistan,* which considered \"whether the facts as alleged by Claimant in this case, if established, are capable of coming within those provisions of the BIT which have been invoked,\"15 and *Bayindir v. Pakistan,* which asked whether the facts alleged \"fall within those provisions [invoked] or are capable, if proved, of constituting breaches of the obligations they refer to.\"16\n\n*See, eg.,* *Methanex v. United States,* UNCITRAL (NAFTA), Partial Award, 7 August 2002, at para. 112; *Plama Consortium Ltd. v. Republic of Bulgaria,* ICSID Case No. ARB/03/24, Decision on Jurisdiction, 8 February 2005, at para. 132.\n\n*SGS v. Pakistan,* Decision on Jurisdiction at para. 145 (citation omitted).\n\n*Impregilo SpA. v. Islamic Republic of Pakistan,* ICSID Case No. ARB/03/03, Decision on Jurisdiction, 22 April 2005, at para. 254 *(\u2018Impregilo v. Pakistan,* Decision on Jurisdiction\") (emphasis in original).\n\n*Bayindir Insaat Turizn Ticaret Ve Sanayi A.S. v. Islamic Republic of Pakistan,* ICSID Case No. ARB/03/29, Decision on Jurisdiction, 14 November 2005, at para. 197 *(\u2018Bayindir v. Pakistan,* Decision on Jurisdiction\").\n\n50.\n\nWe note that this standard is different from a *\"prima facie* \" standard\u2014a term that is frequently invoked, but that has the potential needlessly to confuse the issue. A *prima facie* standard would apply at the merits stage to the evidence that is put forward by a claimant (or by a respondent, in the case, for example, of an affirmative defense). Black\u2019s Law Dictionary explains that *prima facie* evidence is, **inter alia,** \"[t]hat quantum of evidence that suffices for proof of a particular fact until the fact is contradicted by other evidence\" and that a *prima facie* case is one, **inter alia,** in which \"not only...plaintiff s evidence would reasonably allow\n\n[the] conclusion plaintiff seeks, but also that plaintiff s evidence compels such a conclusion if the defendant produces no evidence to rebut it.\"17 Once a claimant has offered evidence that makes a **prima facie** showing, respondent must then produce evidence to rebut the claimant\u2019s factual assertions. But this is a matter for the merits phase, during which the tribunal weighs the sufficiency of the Parties\u2019 evidence. At the jurisdictional phase, the claimant is not asked to make a **prima facie** showing of its case on the merits; it is not required to produce evidence to support its allegations about the respondent\u2019s purported default. As discussed above, all a claimant needs to do is show that the facts that it has alleged (though not yet proven) could violate the treaty in question.18\n\nBlack\u2019s Law Dictionary (6th ed. 1990) at 1189-90.\n\nOne might say that a claimant must allege a *prima facie* case at the jurisdictional stage, but it need not make that case until the merits stage.\n\n51.\n\nIt is equally well accepted that, for jurisdictional purposes, it is sufficient that the facts as asserted by Claimant, if proven, *could* (not would) violate the provisions of the BIT. In other words, at the jurisdictional stage, the Tribunal need not decide whether, assuming the factual allegations were proven, the claim would prevail as a matter of law. Judge Higgins drew this distinction, too, in her separate opinion:\n\nIt is interesting to note that in the *Mavrommatis* case the Permanent Court said it was necessary, to establish its jurisdiction, to see if the Greek claims \"would\" involve a breach of the provisions of the article. This would seem to go too far. Only at the merits, after deployment of evidence, and possible defences, may \"could\" be converted to \"would\". The Court should thus see if, on the facts as alleged by Iran, the United States actions complained of might violate the Treaty articles.19\n\n*Oil Platforms,* Separate Opinion of Judge Rosalyn Higgins at para. 33.\n\n52.\n\nIf the rule were otherwise, the inquiry could not properly be considered jurisdictional. A determination that a given set of alleged facts, even if proven, would not constitute a violation of a legal right is, in effect, a holding on the merits. That would be the consequence, for example, if a tribunal were to uphold an objection that a claim is \"manifestly without legal merit\" under ICSID Arbitration Rule 41(5). Thus, so long as the objection goes only to the authority of the Tribunal to hear claims for the breach of the legal right identified by the Claimant, the Tribunal\u2019s review of the sufficiency of the legal allegations, like its review of the factual allegations, is limited.\n\n53.\n\nA fundamentally different approach is required, however, for issues that are directly determinative of the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction\u2014such as, for example, issues of consent, nationality, covered investment, territoriality, or the temporal scope of treaty protection. If the Tribunal is to make jurisdictional determinations on such issues in a threshold jurisdictional stage (rather than joining them to the merits), the Tribunal must reach definitive findings of fact and conclusions of law. Without such determinations, the Tribunal cannot satisfy itself that it has jurisdiction to hear the merits of the dispute.\n\n54.\n\nThis is because the investment treaty context brings with it specific, threshold jurisdictional requirements that are articulated in the relevant investment treaty, and (in some cases such as this one) in the ICSID Convention. For example, the Switzerland-Paraguay Treaty may be invoked only by an investor of a Contracting Party, as defined in Article 1(1) of the Treaty. Likewise, under Article 25 of the ICSID Convention, an ICSID tribunal may hear only a legal dispute between a Contracting State and a national of another Contracting State. It is not sufficient merely to allege the nationality of the investor in order to determine that the Tribunal has jurisdiction *rationae personae-,* nationality must be established conclusively at the jurisdictional stage.\n\n55.\n\nWhere the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction with respect to threshold requirements of the Treaty or ICSID Convention turns on the existence (or absence) of certain disputed facts, the Tribunal cannot merely take Claimant\u2019s factual allegations as true, and wait until the merits stage to ascertain whether those facts are established. Such disputed facts must be proven at the jurisdictional stage, so that the Tribunal can make a definitive determination of its own jurisdiction. If the evidence is insufficient to ascertain the facts, the Tribunal can choose to join the jurisdictional determination to the merits stage for further development of the evidence\u2014but it cannot determine that it has jurisdiction on a *pro tempore* basis, without assuring itself that the necessary facts are proven.\n\n56.\n\nAs stated by the Tribunal in *Inceysa v. El Salvador,* \"because the ICSID Convention obligates the Arbitral Tribunal to decide its own competence, it implicitly gives the Tribunal the right to analyze all factual and legal matters that may be relevant in order to fulfill this obligation.\"20 With respect to facts that go to the issue of *jurisdiction,* this Tribunal agrees with the *Inceysa* tribunal\u2019s conclusion that it is \"obligated to analyze facts and substantive normative provisions that constitute premises for the definition of the scope of the Tribunal\u2019s competence.\"21\n\n*Inceysa Vallisoletana, S.P. v. Republic of EL Salvador,* ICSID Case No. ARB/03/26, Award, 2 August 2006, at para. 149 *(\u2018Inceysa v. Pl Salvador,* Award\") (referring to Article 41 of the ICSID Convention, which states \"The Tribunal shall be the judge of its own competence\").\n\n*Inceysa v. Pl Salvador,* Award at para. 155; *see also* *Ioan Micula et at v. Romania,* ICSID Case No. ARB/05/20, Decision on Jurisdiction and Admissibility, 24 September 2008, at para. 66 (\"[A] tribunal need not go beyond determining whether the facts alleged by a claimant, if established, are capable of constituting violations of the provisions that are invoked. However, when a jurisdictional issue hinges on a factual determination that may also relate to the merits of the claims, the Tribunal must proceed to a determination of the facts that are presented to it to the extent necessary for jurisdictional purposes. Therefore, a tribunal can make definitive factual findings at the jurisdictional stage too. For example, a tribunal must determine the nationality of a claimant in order to establish its jurisdiction *ratione personae* in a definitive manner.\").\n\n57.\n\nThe Tribunal\u2019s approach here is also consistent in this particular respect with that in *Phoenix Action v. Czech Republic,* where the tribunal concurred with the respondent that in addition to *alleging* sufficient facts to support one or more claims on the merits, \"the claimant must *prove* the facts necessary for the establishment of jurisdiction.\"22 The *Phoenix* tribunal went on to endorse this \"double approach\" to facts relevant to the merits and facts relevant to jurisdiction.23 As to the former, the tribunal stated that \"they have indeed to be accepted as such at the jurisdictional stage, until their existence is ascertained or not at the merits level.\"24 However, as to the latter, a different approach is required: \"On the contrary, if jurisdiction rests on the existence of certain facts, they have to be proven at the jurisdictional stage.\"25\n\n*Phoenix Action, Ptd. v. The (Czech Republic,* ICSID Case No. ARB/06/5, Award, 15 April 2009, at para. 59 (emphasis added) *(\u2018Phoenix Action,* Award\").\n\n*Phoenix Action,* Award at para. 62.\n\n*Phoenix Action,* Award at para. 61.\n\n*Phoenix Action,* Award at para. 61; *see also id.* at paras. 63-64.\n\n58.\n\nClaimant suggested at the hearing that the Tribunal should accept as true *all* factual assertions of the Claimant, both those that go to threshold questions of jurisdiction and those needed to make out its claims on the merits. But that cannot be the case, because it would require the Tribunal to forgo the very inquiry it is required to undertake, *i.e.,* determining whether or not the Tribunal has jurisdiction.26 As the *Pan American v. Argentina* tribunal noted in another jurisdictional context, \"if everything were to depend on characterisations made by a claimant alone, the inquiry to jurisdiction and competence would be reduced to naught, and tribunals would be bereft of the *competence de la competence* enjoyed by them under Article 41(1) of the ICSID Convention.\"27 Either at a preliminary jurisdictional stage, or before proceeding to the merits if the tribunal has joined jurisdiction to the merits, an ICSID tribunal must conclusively determine all issues that are necessary to establish its jurisdiction, including by making all necessary factual findings.\n\n*See, eg.,* Dissenting Opinion of Sir Franklin Berman, *Industria Nacional de Alimentos, SA. and Indalsa Per\u00fa SA. v. Republic of Peru,* ICSID Case No. ARB/03/4, Decision on Annulment, 5 September 2007, at para. 17 (\"[I]f particular facts are a critical element in the establishment of jurisdiction itself, so that the decision to accept or to deny jurisdiction disposes of them once and for all for this purpose, how can it be seriously claimed that those facts should be assumed rather than proved?\").\n\n*Pan American Energy EEC and BP Argentina Exploration Co. v. The Argentine Republic,* ICSID Case No. ARB/03/13 and *BP America Production Co. et al. v. The Argentine Republic,* ICSID Case No. ARB/04/8, Decision on Preliminary Objections, 27 July 2006, at para. 50. The *Pan American* tribunal was considering the parties\u2019 conflicting positions on the proper characterization of various issues as either \"jurisdictional\" or \"merits\" issues.\n\n**IV. JURISDICTIONAL LIMITS OF THE BIT AND THE ICSID CONVENTION**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n59.\n\nRespondent advanced multiple objections to this Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction, several of which crystallized between its Memorial submissions and its Reply. In light of the different standards to be applied (as just discussed in Section III.B above), the Tribunal will separate the objections into those that rest on specific jurisdictional limitations imposed by the terms of the Treaty or the ICSID Convention, addressed in this Section IV, and those that challenge the adequacy, for purposes of jurisdiction, of the claims stated, to be addressed in Section V below.\n\n**A. Was There a Valid Expression of Consent?**\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n60.\n\nThe first of Respondent\u2019s jurisdictional objections to which we turn is its contention that the Republic of Paraguay has not consented to the arbitration of this dispute under ICSID\u2019s auspices.\n\n61.\n\nIn both of its Memorial submissions, Respondent argued that, although Paraguay is a party to the ICSID Convention, it has not expressed its consent to ICSID jurisdiction with respect to this dispute, as required under the Convention. Respondent pointed to the Preamble of the ICSID Convention, which declares that \"no Contracting State shall by the mere fact of its ratification, acceptance or approval of this Convention and without its consent be deemed to be under any obligation to submit any particular dispute to conciliation or arbitration.\"28\n\nPreamble, ICSID Convention.\n\n62.\n\nRespondent contended that, according to Paraguayan law, Paraguay\u2019s consent to arbitration must be exercised by a representative of the State with full powers, *i.e.,* one constitutionally authorized to bind Paraguay. Respondent maintained that the sole authority capable of giving Paraguay\u2019s consent to ICSID jurisdiction over this dispute is the President of Paraguay, and that he has not given such consent.\n\n63.\n\nRespondent further contended that domestic law prohibits the international arbitration of Claimant\u2019s claims, as the Paraguayan Constitution mandates judicial sovereignty in matters of public law. Respondent argued that Paraguay\u2019s Constitution bars the arbitration of claims such as this, which affect Government patrimony.\n\n64.\n\nRespondent did not reiterate this objection to the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction in its Reply or at the hearing. However, the Reply was characterized as being \"in further support\" of Respondent\u2019s objections to jurisdiction, and \"in addition to the bases set forth in the Republic of Paraguay\u2019s previous submissions.\"29 Accordingly, the Tribunal understands that Paraguay maintains the objection, and that the Tribunal is required to rule upon it.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply, Introduction.\n\n65.\n\nClaimant pointed to Article 9 of the BIT as evidence of Paraguay\u2019s express written consent to ICSID jurisdiction for the resolution of this dispute, which in turn meets the written consent requirement of Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention. Claimant maintained that no further action by Paraguay was required to perfect or confirm its consent to ICSID arbitration of this dispute.\n\n66.\n\nClaimant argued that, pursuant to Article 27 of the Vienna Convention, Respondent cannot invoke its domestic law to excuse or ignore its international obligations. The arbitrability of the dispute under Paraguayan law therefore cannot and does not affect the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction. Claimant also maintained that the dispute *is* arbitrable under Paraguayan law, because under Paraguay\u2019s Constitution the BIT is incorporated into Paraguayan law.\n\n67.\n\nIn the Tribunal\u2019s analysis, it is a straightforward matter to conclude that Respondent has consented to ICSID arbitration of this Treaty dispute.\n\n68.\n\nRespondent is, of course, correct that Paraguay\u2019s ratification of the ICSID Convention did not, standing alone, constitute consent by Paraguay to ICSID arbitration of this particular dispute. The Preamble and Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention are both clear that the Contracting State in question must \"consent in writing\" to submit a given dispute to the Centre for arbitration; the ICSID Convention is not itself an instrument of consent.\n\n69.\n\nRespondent errs, however, in its claim that no such express written consent has been given by Paraguay. Paraguay explicitly consented to ICSID jurisdiction of this and any other \"disputes with respect to investments between a Contracting Party [to the BIT] and an investor of the other Contracting Party [to the BIT]\" in Article 9 of the Switzerland-Paraguay Treaty. BIT Article 9(4) provides that \"[e]ach Contracting Party hereby consents to the submission of an investment dispute to international arbitration.\" Article 9(2) provides that if \"consultations do not result in a solution within six months,\" \"the investor may submit the dispute... to international arbitration,\" and gives the investor a choice between (a) ICSID arbitration, and (b) *ad hoc* arbitration under the UNCITRAL arbitration rules.\n\n70.\n\nAlthough it was the subject of some discussion in the early years of investment treaty arbitration, it is now uniformly accepted that the ratification of a bilateral investment treaty containing such provisions constitutes a State\u2019s written consent to arbitration of covered disputes.30 The State\u2019s consent in a BIT is often described as an \"open invitation\" or a \"standing offer\" to covered investors to submit such disputes to international arbitration, which the investor \"accepts\" by giving its own written consent to resort to such arbitration (whether prior to or in its Request for Arbitration).31\n\n*See Lanco International Inc. v. The Argentine Republic,* ICSID Case No. ARB/97/6, Preliminary Decision on Jurisdiction of the Arbitral Tribunal, 8 December 1998, at paras. 43-44 *(\u2018Lanco v. Argentina,* Decision on Jurisdiction\"); *see also, eg.,* *Impregilo v. Pakistan,* Decision on Jurisdiction at para. 108; *SGS v. Philippines,* Decision on Jurisdiction at para. 31; Christoph H. Schreuer, The ICSID CONVENTION: A COMMENTARY at pp. 190-91, 205-06 (2nd ed. 2009) (\"Schreuer, Commentary\").\n\n*See, eg.,* *Lanco v. Argentina,* Decision on Jurisdiction, at paras. 31-33; Georges Delaume, *ICSID Arbitration: Practical Considerations,* 1 J. INT\u2019L Arb. 101, 104 (1984) (\"Consent may also result from the investor\u2019s acceptance of a unilateral offer from the Contracting State involved, when that State has already consented to ICSID arbitration in relevant provisions of its investment legislation or of a bilateral treaty with the Contracting State of which the investor is a national.\"); Schreuer, COMMENTARY at p. 9 (\"Alternatively, consent may be contained in a standing offer by the host State which may be accepted by the investor in appropriate form....A standing offer may also be contained in a treaty to which the host State and the investor\u2019s State of nationality are parties.\" (citations omitted)); *see generally* Antonio Parra, *ICSID and New Trends in International Dispute Settlement,* 10/1 NEWS FROM ICSID 7, 8 (1993) (discussing emergence of \"general \u2018offers\u2019\" in bilateral investment treaties to submit disputes to ICSID arbitration).\n\n71.\n\nParaguay concluded and ratified the Switzerland-Paraguay BIT. Paraguay has not argued that the BIT was not properly ratified, or that it never entered into force. The BIT\u2014and Article 9\u2019s unequivocal \"consent[] to the submission of an investment dispute to international arbitration\"\u2014therefore constitutes a binding international obligation of the Republic of Paraguay. This is not an \"indirect means\" of finding that Paraguay has consented to ICSID arbitration of this dispute, as Paraguay has claimed.32 Article 9 of the BIT represents a direct and express consent by Paraguay to arbitration of the dispute under ICSID\u2019s auspices (provided, of course, that the other jurisdictional requirements of the BIT and the ICSID Convention are satisfied).\n\nRespondent\u2019s Memorial on Jurisdiction (26 June 2008 Submission) at p. 4.\n\n72.\n\nParaguay nevertheless maintained that some additional act or statement by the Head of State is required under Paraguayan law to bestow the State\u2019s consent to arbitration. However, no such limitation or conditionality is anywhere to be found in Article 9 of the BIT; Paraguay did not qualify Article 9(4), for example, in any way. Thus Paraguay\u2019s international obligation to submit to ICSID arbitration if the investor so chooses is not limited by any such domestic law requirement. And Claimant is correct that Respondent cannot invoke its domestic law to avoid its obligations under international law. Article 27 of the Vienna Convention provides that \"[a] party may not invoke the provisions of its internal law as justification for its failure to perform a treaty....\" Accordingly, Paraguay\u2019s claims that domestic Paraguayan law imposes certain procedural or substantive limitations on its consent cannot change or derogate from the unequivocal consent given\u2014and binding on Paraguay as a matter of international law\u2014in the BIT.\n\n73.\n\nThe Tribunal concludes that Paraguay has given the requisite consent in Article 9 of the BIT to international arbitration of this dispute under ICSID\u2019s auspices, and that that provision likewise constitutes Paraguay\u2019s written consent under Article 25 of the ICSID Convention.\n\n**B. Is There a Covered Investment?**\n-------------------------------------\n\n74.\n\nArticle 2(1) of the BIT provides, in pertinent part, that the BIT \"shall apply to investments in the territory of one Contracting Party, made in accordance with its legislation, including possible admission procedures, prior or after the entry into force of the [BIT] by investors of the other Contracting Party.\" All of Claimant\u2019s claims are stated as claims for breach of the BIT, which will be applicable in the first instance only if these Article 2(1) conditions are met.\n\n75.\n\nParaguay has not disputed that SGS is a qualified investor of Switzerland for purposes of the nationality requirements of the BIT (and the ICSID Convention). It is undisputed that SGS is a company constituted under Swiss law, with its seat and real economic activities in Geneva, Switzerland. As such, the Tribunal concludes that SGS meets the definition of an \"investor\" under Article l(1)(ii)(b) of the BIT, which refers to \"legal entities, including companies, corporations, business associations and other organisations, which are constituted or otherwise duly organised under Swiss law and have their seat, together with real economic activities, in the territory of the Swiss Confederation.\" Likewise, it is undisputed that SGS had the nationality of Switzerland, an ICSID Contracting State, at the time it filed its Request for Arbitration, thus meeting the nationality requirement of Article 25(2) of the ICSID Convention.\n\n76.\n\nRespondent does, however, object that Claimant has not made a covered investment within the meaning of the BIT and the ICSID Convention. Absent a proper \"investment,\" there can be no \"disputef] with respect to [an] investment\" (BIT Article 9(1)) nor a \"legal dispute arising out of an investment\" (ICSID Convention Article 25(1)) over which this Tribunal could exercise jurisdiction. Respondent\u2019s objection is multifaceted and intertwined, but it can be separated for analytical purposes into three questions, each of which will be addressed in turn:\n\n(1) Are Claimant\u2019s alleged investments of the type that is covered by the protections of the BIT, and by the ICSID Convention (to the extent they may differ) ?\n\n(2) Does Claimant have an investment or investments \"in the territory of\u2019 Paraguay, as required in order to obtain the BIT\u2019s protections?\n\n(3) Was the investment \"made in accordance with [Paraguay\u2019s] legislation,\" as also required to be covered under the BIT?\n\n**1. Nature of the Investment**\n-------------------------------\n\n77.\n\nRespondent contends that Claimant\u2019s claimed investments do not meet the \"investment\" requirements of the BIT, or, in the alternative, the requirements of Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention. If the claimed investments are not investments within the meaning of the Treaty, that would foreclose the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction entirely. Accordingly, we turn first to the question of whether Claimant has made an investment within the meaning of Article 1 (2) of the BIT.\n\n**a. The Switzerland-Paraguay BIT**\n-----------------------------------\n\n78.\n\nArticle 1(2) of the BIT defines \"investment\" to include \"every kind of assets and particularly\", *inter alia,* (c) \"claims to money or to any performance having an economic value,\" and (e) \"concessions under public law, including... rights given by law, by contract or by decision of the authority in accordance with the law.\"\n\n79.\n\nClaimant in its Request stated that it had made an investment \"on the basis of\u2019 the Contract that qualified as an investment under the BIT.33 In its Counter-Memorial, Claimant identified \"the Contract and [its] performance\" or \"the Contract in itself and SGS\u2019s rights thereunder\" as its investments,34 a phrasing echoed in the Rejoinder\u2019s references to \"the Contract and associated rights.\"35 Claimant also pointed out that pursuant to the Contract it had established liaison offices in Asunci\u00f3n, Ciudad del Este, and Encarnaci\u00f3n, which Claimant alleged cost approximately US$ 2,225 million per year to maintain and were staffed by approximately 70 local and foreign personnel.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Request for Arbitration, 16 October 2007, at para. 18.\n\n*See, eg.,* Claimant\u2019s Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, 22 September 2008, at paras. 67, 74 (\"Claimant\u2019s Counter-Memorial\").\n\n*See, eg.,* Claimant\u2019s Rejoinder at paras. 49-64.\n\n80.\n\nClaimant contended that the Contract and associated rights, as well as the liaison office, are assets of value, meeting the foundational \"every kind of assets\" requirement of Article 1(2). Furthermore, Claimant maintained that they also fall within several of the \"particular\" examples of such assets listed in Article 1(2), in that the Contract gives SGS claims to money and claims to performance having an economic value (Article l(2)(c)) and it also encompasses rights given \"by decision of the authority\" involving the provision of public services, making it, in Claimant\u2019s view, \"akin to\" a \"concession under public law\" (Article l(2)(e)).\n\n81.\n\nRespondent objected that Paraguay has not made a protected investment under the BIT. Respondent contended that the Contract is not an asset and suggests that SGS may not have in fact treated the Contract as an asset for accounting purposes. Respondent further contended that the Contract is not a right to a claim to money because it is not a document evidencing a liquidated debt, such as a promissory note or a judgment. Respondent argued that the Contract is not a concession under Paraguayan law, as it was purely a right to receive payment for services performed abroad, not a right granted under public law. And with respect to the liaison office, Respondent argued that the establishment of such an office was not required under the Contract, and that it was incidental to the performance of the Contract.\n\n82.\n\nIt is not disputed that a contract was entered into by SGS and the Ministry of Finance of Paraguay, that in the exercise of that contract SGS performed pre-shipment inspections and certifications of imports to Paraguay, and that the contract provided that Paraguay would pay SGS for such services. Furthermore, Respondent did not dispute that SGS established an office of considerable size in Paraguay that was responsible for handling certain aspects of SGS\u2019s inspection and certification services, at some meaningful expense to SGS.\n\n83.\n\nThe Tribunal is satisfied that the Contract itself, and certainly in conjunction with the services performed under it and the offices in Paraguay, constitutes a covered investment under Article 1(2) of the BIT. They qualify under the general BIT definition, as \"assets.\" While the Contract and SGS\u2019s rights thereunder may be intangible, they are proprietary to SGS and they have economic value that accrues to SGS. Likewise, the liaison office is a tangible manifestation of SGS\u2019s activities under the Contract. The Tribunal is not persuaded, as Paraguay argued, that the characterization of something as an \"asset\" for purposes of the BIT\u2019s \"investment\" definition should turn on the Claimant\u2019s accounting treatment of the claimed investment\u2014 *i.e.,* whether the Contract is recorded on SGS\u2019s books as an asset.36 Rather, the question of what constitutes an asset (whether tangible or intangible) must be viewed more broadly, in terms of the item\u2019s economic value, rather than limited to the potentially artificial confines of accounting treatment.\n\n*See* Respondent\u2019s Reply at para. 47.\n\n84.\n\nThe Tribunal is also persuaded that the Contract and associated rights are encompassed within the \"particular\" examples cited by Claimant in Article 1(2). The Contract and the Parties\u2019 performance of it give rise to \"claims to money or to any performance having an economic value\" (Article l(2)(c)). Claimant will of course have to prove its particular claims to be meritorious in the next phase of the arbitration, but for the purpose of defining an \"investment,\" the Tribunal\u2019s determination that, on its face, the Contract contemplates payment in exchange for services rendered that may give rise to such claims is sufficient. The Tribunal is not persuaded by Respondent\u2019s contention that assets in the form of \"claims to money\" under Article l(2)(c) are limited to promissory notes or judgments or other documents evidencing liquidated debts.37 The ordinary meaning of the BIT text itself signals no such limits, and the textual pairing of \"claims to money\" with the undoubtedly broad \"claims...to performance having economic value\" together in Article l(2)(c) suggests that a similar degree of breadth and flexibility should apply to both. In the Tribunal\u2019s opinion, Article l(2)(c) can properly encompass assets in the form of unliquidated just as well as liquidated claims to money.\n\nAccording to Black\u2019s Law Dictionary, \"[a] debt is liquidated when it is certain what is due and how much is due\" whether by agreement of the parties or by operation of law. Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (6th ed. 1990) at 930.\n\n85.\n\nWe note that the tribunal in *SGS v. Pakistan* did not hesitate to classify a SGS pre-shipment inspection services contract and SGS\u2019s rights thereunder as investments within the Switzerland-Pakistan treaty\u2019s \"claims to money\" provision, which is identical to the Switzerland-Paraguay BIT provision at issue here.38 The *SGS v. Philippines* tribunal did not consider the question directly, as the Philippines apparently had not objected to jurisdiction on that basis. But it applied a definition of \"investment\" substantially identical to Article 1(2) of the Switzerland-Paraguay BIT\u2014including an entirely identical \"claims to money\" provision\u2014to conclude that \"SGS made an investment...under the CISS Agreement, considered as a whole.\"39 The *BIVAC* tribunal did not reach the question, having determined that BIVAC\u2019s pre-shipment inspection services contract gave it \"rights granted under public law,\" one of the examples of \"investment\" within the definition of the Netherlands-Paraguay BIT at issue in that case.40\n\n*See* *SGS v. Pakistan,* Decision on Jurisdiction at para. 135.\n\n*SGS v. Philippines,* Decision on Jurisdiction at para. 112.\n\n*See BIVAC v. Paraguay,* Decision on Jurisdiction at para. 93.\n\n86.\n\nThe Tribunal is also persuaded that the Contract and SGS\u2019s rights thereunder fall within the example of covered assets stated in BIT Article l(2)(e): \"concessions under public law... as well as other rights given by law, by contract or by decision of the authority in accordance with the law.\"\n\n87.\n\nWe need not, for this purpose, conclude that the Contract is a concession as that term is specifically defined in Paraguayan law. Paraguay has argued that the Contract is an administrative contract, which it maintains is distinct from a concession under Paraguayan law. The BIT, however, describes a broader category of assets, in that it includes not only \"concessions,\"41 but also \"other rights given by law, by contract or by decision of the authority in accordance with the law.\" Thus, Claimant argues only that the Contract was \"akin to\" a concession under public law, and rests also on the fact that the Contract encompasses rights granted \"by a decision of the authority in accordance with the law\"\u2014 namely, granted by the Ministry of Finance in accordance with Presidential Decree No. 12311 of 31 January 1996 (Ex. C-6).\n\nThere is a difference in this respect between the English text of the Switzerland-Paraguay BIT and the French and Spanish texts. The latter both refer simply to \"concessions,\" whereas the English text\u2014\"concessions under public law\"\u2014adds a clause. The BIT provides (in its concluding paragraph) that in the event of a discrepancy among the three texts, the English text shall prevail. In this case, however, the Tribunal does not consider that any point of significance in its analysis turns on the distinction (if any) between a concession and a concession under public law.\n\n88.\n\nIn this vein, it seems clear that the services carried out by SGS were services of a public nature, or at the very least were intimately intertwined with the administration of State functions. Absent inspections and certifications by an entity such as SGS, it would be the function of the State to inspect cargoes, identify and value the goods, and collect the requisite customs duties and taxes on the imports. Paraguay delegated certain of these tasks to SGS, according to Decree No. 12311, to \"optimiz[e] the tax collections volume in order to obtain the revenue levels\" and to \"improve the control mechanisms of compliance with tax liabilities.\"42 The services performed by SGS under the Contract were apparently integral to the State\u2019s import operations, including the collection of import duties and taxes: the certifications issued by SGS (or by BIVAC under its corresponding contract) pursuant to inspections were required by law in order to clear a cargo through Paraguayan customs.43 Whether or not SGS\u2019s certifications were final and binding, in the sense that Paraguay contends that its customs authorities retained the right to re-inspect shipments previously certified by SGS,44 SGS\u2019s certifications were apparently integral to the Paraguayan authorities\u2019 customs clearance and duty collection procedures.\n\nPresidential Decree No. 12311, 31 January 1996, at Preamble (Ex. C-6) (\"Decree No. 12311\"); *see also* Preamble, Contract (Ex. C-4). Respondent reiterated this purpose of the Contract in its Memorial on Jurisdiction (8 April 2008 Submission) at p. 4 (Ministry entered into the Contract \"with the view of increasing tax revenues and of improving the control mechanisms for the enforcement of the tax obligations relating to the import transactions subject to the Preshipment Inspection Services\").\n\n*See* Decree No. 12311, Art. 2 (Ex. C-6); *see also* Resolution No. 1171/96, Art. 4 (Ex. RL-3B).\n\n*See* Respondent\u2019s Reply at paras. 28, 30 (citing Resolution No. 1171/96, Art. 21 (Ex. RL-3B)).\n\n89.\n\nAs noted above, the *BIVAC* tribunal concluded that BIVAC\u2019s similar if not identical contract with Paraguay conferred \"rights granted under public law\" upon BIVAC, per one of the examples of covered assets in the Netherlands-Paraguay BIT\u2019s definition of investment.45 While the asset example set out in Article l(2)(e) of the Switzerland-Paraguay BIT is worded differently from the definition contained in the Netherlands-Paraguay BIT, it embraces a sufficiently similar concept that we think it worth taking note of the *BIVAC* tribunal\u2019s comparable conclusion. Our conclusion is also consistent with that of the *SGS v. Pakistan* tribunal, which characterized an SGS inspection services contract (albeit a contract not before us here) as \"conferring] certain powers [on SGS] that ordinarily would have been exercised by the Pakistani Customs service (the identification and valuation of goods for duty purposes).\"46 That tribunal concluded that \"Pakistan effectively granted SGS a public law concession,\" and that the SGS contract there \"amounted to \u2018a concession under public laws\u2019 falling well within the [Switzerland-Pakistan] BIT\u2019s definition of investment.\"47\n\n*See BIVAC v.

Pakistan,* Decision on Jurisdiction at paras. 135, 140 (emphasis omitted).\n\n90.\n\nIn sum, the Tribunal holds that the Contract, SGS\u2019s associated rights thereunder, and its operations undertaken in conjunction with the Contract constitute an \"investment\" within the definition of Article 1 (2) of the BIT.\n\n**b. Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention**\n--------------------------------------------\n\n91.\n\nHaving concluded that the BIT\u2019s requirements for a covered \"investment\" are satisfied and pose no barrier to this Tribunal\u2019s exercise of jurisdiction over Claimant\u2019s BIT claims, the next question confronting the Tribunal is whether anything in the ICSID Convention compels a different result. Claimant elected under Article 9(2) of the BIT to pursue arbitration of those Treaty claims before ICSID. As a result, Claimant must meet not only the jurisdictional requirements of the BIT, but also the jurisdictional requirements of the ICSID Convention. The question here is whether, and if so, how, those requirements differ with respect to the nature of the \"investment\" out of which Claimant\u2019s claims must arise.\n\n92.\n\nAlthough Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention extends jurisdiction to legal disputes arising directly out of an investment, it does not define \"investment.\" The Report of the Executive Directors on the ICSID Convention specifically explains that \"[n]o attempt was made to define the term \u2018investment\u2019 given the essential requirement of consent by the parties, and the mechanisms through which the Contracting States can make known, in advance, if they so desire, the classes of disputes which they would or would not consider submitting to the Centre....\"48 As the tribunal in *Mihaly v. Sri Lanka* elaborated, \"the definition was left to be worked out in the subsequent practice of States, thereby preserving its integrity and flexibility and allowing for future progressive development of international law on the topic of investment.\"49 Thus, the Tribunal agrees with Claimant that \"it was understood that the contracting states would determine the scope of protected and excluded investments in their respective instruments of consent,\"50 such as in the bilateral investment treaty at issue here.\n\nReport of the Executive Directors on the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States, 18 March 1965, at para. 27 (\"Report of the Executive Directors\").\n\n*Mihaly International Corp. v. Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka,* ICSID Case No. ARB/00/2, Award, 15 March 2002, at para. 33.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Counter-Memorial at para. 37.\n\n93.\n\nIt would go too far to suggest that *any* definition of investment agreed by states in a BIT (or by a state and an investor in a contract) must constitute an \"investment\" for purposes of Article 25(1). To cite the classic example, one would not say that a simple contract for the sale of goods, without more, would constitute an investment within the meaning of Article 25(1), even if defined as such in a BIT or in the contract itself. But the fact that one can conceive of such an outlier example does not change the fact that, in most cases\u2014including, in the Tribunal\u2019s view, this one\u2014it will be appropriate to defer to the State parties\u2019 articulation in the instrument of consent *(e.g.* the BIT) of what constitutes an investment. The State parties to a BIT agree to protect certain kinds of economic activity, and when they provide that disputes between investors and States relating to that activity may be resolved through, *inter alia,* ICSID arbitration, that means they believe that that activity constitutes an \"investment\" within the meaning of the ICSID Convention as well. That judgment, by States that are both Parties to the BIT and Contracting States to the ICSID Convention, should be given the greatest weight.51 A tribunal would have to have very strong reasons to hold that the mutually agreed definition of investment should be disregarded.\n\n*Cf* *Rompetrol Group N.V. v. Romania,* ICSID Case No. ARB/06/3, Decision on Respondent\u2019s Preliminary Objections on Jurisdiction and Admissibility, 18 April 2008, at paras. 81, 83 (adopting similar approach with respect to criteria of nationality).\n\n94.\n\nThe **BIVAC** tribunal approached the question from this direction: \"At a formal level, the question may be put as follows: does the definition [of investment] in the BIT exceed what is permissible under the Convention?\"52 For the Netherlands-Paraguay BIT, the **BIVAC** tribunal concluded that \"the answer is self-evidently negative. The definition in the BIT follows the approach adopted in many other BITs concluded around the world. Paraguay would have to argue that its own BIT is inconsistent with the requirements of the ICSID Convention. Sensibly, it has chosen not to go down that path.\"53\n\n*BIVAC v. Paraguay,* Decision on Jurisdiction at para. 94.\n\n*BIVAC v. Paraguay,* Decision on Jurisdiction at para. 94.\n\n95.\n\nWe find that approach compelling. The BIT\u2019s offer of ICSID arbitration for investments covered by the Treaty may fairly be taken as an averment by the State that it believes that all such covered investments are \"ICSID investments\" as well. Thus, if the State were to claim in an arbitration that an investment that satisfies the BIT\u2019s definition is nevertheless not an investment within the ICSID Convention, it would contradict its prior stance to the contrary.54\n\n*Cf.* Devashish Kristian, *A Notion of ICSID Investment,* 6:1 Transnat\u2019l DlSP. Mgmt. (March 2009) at p. 7 & n.22.\n\n96.\n\nWe thus come to the same conclusion with respect to the Switzerland-Paraguay BIT as did the *BIVAC* tribunal under the Netherlands-Paraguay BIT. Nothing in the Switzerland-Paraguay BIT\u2019s definition of investment would support characterizing it as an aberration that risks capturing economic activity clearly outside the ICSID Convention\u2019s intended reach with respect to investments. Accordingly, it is reasonable to proceed on the basis that if a claimed investment satisfies the BIT\u2019s definition of investment (as we have held above that it does here), it is also consistent with the ICSID Convention\u2019s understanding of investment.\n\n97.\n\nThis is a question on which ICSID tribunals have differed. Some tribunals and *ad hoc* committees have proceeded to test claimed investments\u2014investments that may very well satisfy the jurisdictional definitions of investment found in the applicable treaty or contract\u2014against a separate, abstract conception of what an investment pursuant to the ICSID Convention must comprise. This test, however, appears nowhere in the ICSID Convention itself. Its elements, which tribunals have applied as cumulative *(i.e.,* if one feature is missing, a claimed investment will be ruled out of ICSID jurisdiction), are not found in Article 25(1). Rather, the test seeks to create and enforce a universal definition of \"investment\" for the ICSID Convention55\u2014despite the fact that its drafters and signatories decided that it should not have one.56 In our view, however, criteria announced by tribunals do not qualify, narrow, or take precedence over the plain meaning of the BIT\u2019s definition of investment. It is not for this Tribunal to impose additional requirements beyond those agreed to by the States in Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention and in the BIT.\n\n*See, eg.,* *Joy Mining Machinery Ltd. v. Arab Republic of Egypt,* ICSID Case No. ARB/03/11, Award on Jurisdiction, 6 August 2004, at para. 53; *Victor Pey Casado and President Allende Foundation v. Republic of Chile,* ICSID Case No. ARB/98/2, Award, 8 May 2008, at para. 232; *Patrick Mitchell v. Democratic Republic of the Congo,* ICSID Case No. ARB/99/7, Decision on the Application for Annulment of the Award, 1 November 2006, at paras. 29, 33.\n\n*See* Report of the Executive Directors at para. 27 (\"No attempt was made to define the term \u2018investment\u2019 given the essential requirement of consent by the parties...\") The *travaux pr\u00e9paratoires* of the ICSID Convention with respect to this question are reviewed in detail in *Malaysian Historical Salvors Sdn. Bhd. v. Government of Maleysia,* ICSID Case No. ARB/05/10, Decision on the Application for Annulment, 16 April 2009, at paras. 63-71 *(MHS v. Malaysia,* Annulment\").\n\n98.\n\nSome of the elements discussed in this test might prove to be useful in the event that a tribunal were concerned that a BIT or contract definition of investment was so overreaching that it might have captured a transaction that manifestly was not an investment under any acceptable definition. These elements could be useful in identifying such aberrations. Indeed, of late tribunals and *ad hoc* committees have expressed the view that these elements should be viewed as non-binding, non-exclusive means of identifying (rather than defining) investments that are consistent with the ICSID Convention.57\n\n*See, eg.,* *Biwater Gauff (Tanzania) Ltd. v. United Republic of Tanzania,* ICSID Case No. ARB/05/22, Award, 24 July 2008, at paras. 312-18; *MHS v. Malaysia,* Annulment at paras. 75-79; *cf, MCI Power Group, LC and New Turbine, Inc. v. Republic of Ecuador,* ICSID Case No. ARB/03/6, Award, 31 July 2007, at para. 165; *RSM Production Corp. v. Grenada,* ICSID Case No. ARB/05/14, Award, 13 March 2009, at paras. 236-38. The first tribunals to confront directly an objection that claimant lacked an \"investment\" under the ICSID Convention did not search for or apply definitions. In *Fedax N.V. v. Republic of Venezuela,* ICSID Case No. ARB/96/3, Decision of the Tribunal on Objections to Jurisdiction, 11 July 1997, the tribunal merely surveyed prior cases involving investments under the Convention before concluding that the promissory notes before it also qualified; in *Ceskoslovenska Obchodni Banka, a.s. v. The Slovak Republic,* ICSID Case No. ARB/97/4, Decision of the Tribunal on Objections to Jurisdiction, 24 May 1999, the tribunal resisted respondent\u2019s call to apply a definition, stating that while the \"elements of the suggested definition...tend as a rule to be present in most investments, [they] are not a formal prerequisite for the finding that a transaction constitutes an investment as that concept is understood under the Convention.\" *Id.* at para. 90. For more on the distinction between identifying and defining investments, *see* Prof. Emmanuel Gaillard, *Identify or Define? Reflections on the Evolution of the Concept of Investment in ICSID Practice,* in International Investment Law for the 21st Century: Essays in Honor of Christoph Schreuer (2009) (\"Gaillard, *Identify or Define?).*\n\n99.\n\nIn this case, however, the Parties dedicated considerable argument to the question of whether SGS\u2019s claimed investment is compatible with the various criteria catalogued in *Salini v. Morocco.58* Respondent, taking the position that the criteria are compulsory, argued that SGS\u2019s claimed investments fall short and that this Tribunal therefore lacks jurisdiction under the ICSID Convention. Claimant, while maintaining that the **Salini** criteria are typical but not exclusive features of ICSID Convention investments, insisted that all of the criteria are satisfied. The Tribunal is persuaded that Claimant\u2019s investment meets the **Salini** criteria, whether or not such criteria are applicable. Given the limited extent to which such criteria might be relevant (if at all), the Tribunal will set out here only briefly the basis for that assessment.\n\n*See* *Salini Construittori SpA. and Italstrade SpA. v. The Kingdom of Morocco,* ICSID Case No. ARB/00/4, Decision on Jurisdiction, 23 July 2001 *(\u2018Salini v. Morocco,* Decision on Jurisdiction\"), at para. 53. Contrary to some suggestions, the *\"Salini* test\" elements for an investment\u2014commitment of capital or resources; a certain duration; regularity of profits and returns; an element of risk; and (in some tribunals\u2019 views) contributions to the development of the host state\u2014were not previously identified as *requirements.* Professor Christoph Schreuer in his 2001 first edition of his COMMENTARY on The ICSID CONVENTION: A Commentary (1st ed. 2001) at p.140; *see also id.* (2nd ed. 2009) at p. 128.\n\n100.\n\nThe criteria in question include: (i) commitment of resources or assets in the host state; (ii) a certain duration in time; (iii) an element of risk; and (iv) contribution to the economic development of the host state.59\n\n*See* *Salini v. Morocco,* Decision on Jurisdiction at para. 52.\n\n101.\n\nWith respect to the commitment of resources, it appears to be undisputed that Claimant has committed significant monetary and in-kind assets to the operation of liaison offices in Paraguay. Those offices, in turn, apparently played a critical role in the operation of the Paraguayan customs process: inspections performed by SGS abroad led to the issuance of final certifications by those offices in Paraguay, which certifications in turn were required under Paraguayan law in order to clear cargoes through customs in Paraguay. In order to distinguish this activity from the contractually mandated office that the tribunal in *SGS v. Philippines* found to be a sufficient investment in the territory of the Philippines, Respondent has argued that in this case, a liaison office was not required by the Contract. We are not persuaded that this distinction makes a difference; the key is that the offices were established in Paraguay and played an integral part of the performance of SGS\u2019s inspection and certification services under the Contract.\n\n102.\n\nThe Tribunal also takes note of the fact that, in connection with the inspection operations, SGS necessarily committed substantial economic resources at the behest of and for the direct benefit of Paraguay under the Contract. We do not agree with Respondent\u2019s contention that the location where those economic resources were deployed necessarily the ICSID Convention described them only as typical characteristics of investments: \"[t]hese features should not necessarily be understood as jurisdictional requirements....\" Christoph H. Schreuer, disqualifies them for purposes of identifying an \"investment.\" In this context, at least\u2014a contract entered into directly with the State, whose benefits accrued in the State\u2014the whole of the resources committed to implement the Contract may be taken into consideration. (This issue may be of greater significance with respect to the requirement of an investment \"in the territory\" of Paraguay, discussed in the next section, although there too we ultimately are not persuaded that Claimant\u2019s activities can be divided and allocated to distinct locations.)\n\n103.\n\nClaimant also contended that it contributed time, human, and data resources in training Paraguayan customs officials and assisting Paraguay in modernizing its customs infrastructure. Respondent claimed that the technical assistance required under the Contract was not provided (or at a minimum that Claimant did not prove that it was provided). Because of our findings above, we need not resolve the factual dispute at this time, and we do not rely upon Claimant\u2019s claimed technical assistance to Paraguay to reach our conclusion that SGS committed resources in and for the state of Paraguay.\n\n104.\n\nWith respect to duration, the Tribunal notes that, quite apart from the fact that the Contract provides for an initial three-year term and for automatic renewals thereof absent notice of termination, it is undisputed that Claimant did in fact provide services under the Contract for an extended period (nearly three years, according to Claimant). Respondent objects that the Contract\u2019s three-year term is, in effect, illusory, because Respondent had the right to terminate the Contract at its convenience (and to refuse to renew it). But in the face of Claimant\u2019s actual activity over an extended period, the duration element is established, without any need to delve into the specific terms of the Contract.\n\n105.\n\nWith respect to the element of risk, while it is undisputed that under the Contract Claimant received a minimum fee for each inspection performed, that minimum did not make the Contract a risk-free undertaking. Claimant\u2019s total fees payable were dependent upon both the volume and value of the imports into Paraguay, which fees might or might not exceed its costs of providing the services. Claimant also encountered risk as a result of direct competition with BIVAC to perform inspection services for Paraguay-bound cargoes. If importers chose BIVAC inspections over SGS inspections, SGS\u2019s volume of inspections might not be sufficient to cover SGS\u2019s costs.60 As such, the Tribunal is persuaded Claimant did, contrary to Respondent\u2019s contention, bear the risks\u2014profit or loss\u2014of \"participation in the outcome of the investment.\"61\n\n*See* Claimant\u2019s Rejoinder at paras. 30-31.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply at para. 18. The Tribunal therefore need not reach the question whether, as argued by Claimant, the US$ 250,000 performance bond that it provided to the Ministry also reflected the kind of risk on SGS\u2019s part that should be taken into account for purposes of the *Salini* \"risk\" element.\n\n106.\n\nFinally, with respect to a contribution to the economic development of the host state (or, alternatively, a contribution to the economy of the host state),62 the Tribunal sees that element as met by the purpose of the Contract itself, as expressed in its preambular language stating that the Ministry entered into the contract with the objective of optimizing tax collection volume and improving the control mechanisms for compliance with tax liabilities. Both objectives serve the State, not least by contributing to its coffers. The analysis does not depend on an arithmetic balance sheet calculation of whether Paraguay paid out to SGS more or less than it obtained in increased tax revenues, as Respondent suggests. To the extent the question is one of development, Respondent itself characterized the services of SGS and BIVAC as constituting a \"transitional measure\" to be used until the State reaches the point where \"national customs authorities are able to carry out these tasks on their own\"63\u2014in other words, until the State\u2019s capabilities develop sufficiently. It is no great leap to see the \"transitional measure\" (the Contract) as facilitating and contributing to that development, based not only on technical assistance (the existence and sufficiency of which is a disputed issue between the Parties) but also on the inspection and certification services themselves. To the extent the question is one of contributing to the economy, Claimant\u2019s economic activity in and for the benefit of Paraguay is sufficient to establish such a contribution.\n\n*See* *Phoenix Action,* Award at para. 85 (arguing that a contribution to host state \"development\" is impossible to ascertain and that a contribution to the \"economy\" of the host state is a more appropriate requirement).\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply at para. 39.\n\n107.\n\nThis analysis illustrates the need for special caution before resorting to this criterion, in particular. Should a tribunal find it necessary to check for an aberrational transaction falling outside any reasonable understanding of investment, the first three criteria of resources, duration, and risk would seem fully to serve that objective. The contribution-to-development criterion, on the other hand, would appear instead to reflect the consequences of the first three criteria, bringing little independent content to the inquiry.64 At the same time, it invites a tribunal to engage in *post hoc* evaluation of the business, economic, financial and/or policy assessments that prompted the claimant\u2019s activities\u2014a form of second-guessing that would not appropriately drive a tribunal\u2019s jurisdictional analysis.\n\nApparently this fourth criterion (contribution to the host state\u2019s economic development) was, in fact, originally proposed as a more flexible alternative to the first three criteria. However, the *Salini* tribunal and those following it have added it as a fourth required element in the definitional test. *See* Gaillard, *Identify or Define?* at pp. 405-06.\n\n108.\n\nIn sum, while the Tribunal does not see the features of investments identified in **Salini** as a definitional test, nor does it believe that it is necessary to even look for those elements here absent any suggestion that the BIT\u2019s definition of investment is improperly overreaching, it has nevertheless considered the **Salini** elements in light of the Parties\u2019 extensive briefing of the issue. The Tribunal finds all of those elements to be present in Claimant\u2019s claimed investments.\n\n**2. In the Territory**\n-----------------------\n\n109.\n\nAs noted above, Article 2(1) of the BIT specifies that the Treaty applies only to \"investments in the territory\" of the host state (here, Paraguay).65 Respondent objects that the Contract was principally performed by SGS outside the territory of Paraguay, and that SGS\u2019s claims relate to (nonpayment for those services rendered abroad, not to any injury to SGS\u2019s assets in Paraguay. Accordingly, Respondent contends that this Tribunal lacks jurisdiction over Claimant\u2019s claims as they do not pertain to an investment in the territory of Paraguay.\n\nTreaty, Art. 2(1).\n\n110.\n\nThis issue is potentially intertwined with the question (above) of whether the nature of the investment is such that it is protected under the BIT and subject to dispute resolution under the ICSID Convention. If a tribunal finds occasion to inquire into the *Salini* elements, the first of those is typically articulated in terms of a contribution of resources *in the host stated.*66 Analytically, however, the question is more properly addressed separately\u2014an approach reinforced here by the fact that the BIT itself imposes a territorial requirement in addition to (not as part of) the \"investment\" requirement.\n\nThe *Salini* decision itself referred only to \"contributions.\" *Salini v. Morocco,* Decision on Jurisdiction at paras. 52-53.\n\n111.\n\nRespondent principally objects that the preponderance of Claimant\u2019s performance under the Contract took place outside the territory of Paraguay, in connection with Claimant\u2019s inspection activities abroad. Respondent notes that the Contract specifically provides that it was for the performance of \"services to be rendered abroad.\"67 While acknowledging the existence of SGS\u2019s liaison offices in Paraguay, Respondent contends that the Contract did not require the use of offices within the territory of Paraguay and that the activities of those offices were incidental or ancillary to SGS\u2019s principal activity of inspection activities in other countries. Moreover, Respondent contends that Claimant\u2019s claims turn on alleged nonpayment for the services performed abroad and not on acts and omissions affecting SGS\u2019s in-country activities (as would be the case, for example, if SGS were complaining of an expropriation of the liaison office in Asunci\u00f3n). Thus, in Respondent\u2019s view, Claimant\u2019s claims do not arise out of investments made in the territory of Paraguay.\n\n*See, eg.,* Preamble, Provision Concerning the \"Nature and Subject-Matter of the Agreement,\" Contract (Ex. C-4).\n\n112.\n\nClaimant contends that it performed services and incurred expenditures in Paraguay in accordance with the Contract, including in connection with the liaison office in Asunci\u00f3n and the employees who worked there, as well as the training of Paraguayan officials and the development of a customs database. Furthermore, the purpose of those services was aimed at increasing Paraguay\u2019s customs revenues, and the effect of those services was felt in Paraguay alone. In Claimant\u2019s view, these activities in the territory of Paraguay, particularly when coupled with the fact that the benefits of its activities outside Paraguay were experienced in Paraguay, are sufficient to constitute investment \"in the territory\" of Paraguay that is covered by the Treaty and its protections.\n\n113.\n\nIn the Tribunal\u2019s view, Respondent\u2019s approach rests on a parsing of SGS\u2019s investments and its activities under the Contract that is not sustainable. Like the tribunal in *SGS v. Philippines*,68 this Tribunal does not consider it consistent with the facts presented to subdivide Claimant\u2019s activities into services provided abroad and services provided in Paraguay, and to then attribute Claimant\u2019s claims solely to the former category. SGS\u2019s inspections abroad were not carried out for separate purposes, but rather in order to enable it to provide, in Paraguay, a final Inspection Certificate on which the Paraguayan authorities relied to enter goods into the customs territory of Paraguay and to assess and collect the resulting customs revenue. These inspections, and the resulting information that was conveyed to the liaison offices in Paraguay, were indispensable operations for the issuance of the final certifications in Paraguay.69 Thus they were also indispensable to the benefits of the Contract that were received by the Paraguayan state.\n\n*See* *SGS v. Philippines,* Decision on Jurisdiction at paras. 100-101.\n\nRespondent sought to rely on the distinction suggested in *SGS v. Philippines,* in which the tribunal indicated that the result might have been different if the certificates were issued abroad rather than in the putative host state. *See* *SGS v. Philippines,* Decision on Jurisdiction at para. 102. Respondent contended that in this case, SGS prepared its certificates outside Paraguay. Claimant responded with evidence showing that, while certificates were prepared provisionally in other jurisdictions, such drafts were reviewed in Paraguay and the final certificates were issued in Spanish in Paraguay at the liaison offices. Having reviewed this evidence, the Tribunal is persuaded that the final certificates were issued in Paraguay, although it notes that a contrary conclusion would not have compelled it to conclude that SGS lacked an investment in Paraguay.\n\n114.\n\nIt is undisputed that as part of these intertwined operations under the Contract, SGS maintained several offices in Paraguay, including in particular a sizeable office in Asuncion that employed a significant number of people. Whether or not the Contract required or merely contemplated the operation of such offices in Paraguay,70 it is the case that Claimant did in fact operate them in Paraguay in connection with the Contract, and injected funds and resources into the territory of Paraguay for the sake of those operations. There is no suggestion in the BIT that an investment in the territory of the State is limited to only those investments that a State *requires* to be made in its territory; it covers any qualifying investments that merely *are* in the territory.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the Contract clearly anticipates that SGS would establish a liaison office: Art. 3.4 specifies that SGS shall receive at its liaison office various inspection-related documents for each shipment, and Art. 3.5 provides that the Ministry will assist SGS to arrange, *e.g.,* work permits as required for the liaison office. *See* Arts. 3.4 & 3.5, Contract (Ex. C-4).\n\n115.\n\nAnd because the Claimant\u2019s investment is not divisible in the way Paraguay contends, the suggestion also fails that this dispute does not arise directly out of an investment in the territory of Paraguay. The services provided by SGS in Paraguay were not severable or ancillary; they were part and parcel of the services for which SGS expected to be paid under the Contract. Even if it were possible to segregate the services in the manner Respondent suggests, on the facts presented, it is not plausible to maintain that Paraguay\u2019s alleged nonpayment relates solely to SGS\u2019s services abroad. SGS claims that its invoices for the periods after June 1996 (with only one exception) went unpaid in their entirety. There has been no suggestion by Paraguay that it paid some portions of those invoices that were attributable to in-country services while leaving unpaid only those portions attributable to services rendered outside Paraguay. Thus, for purposes of ICSID Convention Article 25(1)\u2019s jurisdictional requirement, the Tribunal holds that Claimant\u2019s claims give rise to the requisite \"legal dispute arising directly out of an investment\".\n\n116.\n\nFurthermore, the Tribunal is of the view that the Contract\u2019s designation of SGS\u2019s services as being performed abroad does not change the analysis. Claimant made a reasonable case that that language of the Contract reflected the parties\u2019 agreement that SGS would not be taxed in Paraguay. Clearly, the domestic tax treatment of SGS\u2019s investment is not determinative of the territorial situs of the investment for purposes of the BIT. The two issues arise under distinct legal orders. The *SGS v. Philippines* tribunal succinctly explained that \"[t]he tax treatment of investments is a matter for local law with its own regime of rules as to where income is considered to have been earned, a regime distinct from that of the BIT.\"71\n\n*SGS v. Philippines,* Decision on Jurisdiction at para. 107.\n\n117.\n\nWe note that our conclusion is consistent with that of all three tribunals to have examined similar contractual arrangements in disputes brought under investment treaties. In *SGS v. Pakistan,* the tribunal held that an investment resting on comparable pre-inspection services was \"in the territory of the host State\" because there had been an \"injection of funds into the territory of Pakistan for the carrying out of SGS\u2019s engagements under the PSI Agreement.\"72 As noted, the *SGS v. Philippines* tribunal likewise insisted that SGS\u2019s activities were to be considered as an integrated undertaking, a sufficient portion of which took place in the host state.73 And in *BIVAC v. Paraguay,* the tribunal likewise had \"little difficulty\" in concluding, with respect to a contract virtually identical to the one before the Tribunal here, that BIVAC had made an investment in the territory of Paraguay for purposes of the Netherlands-Paraguay BIT\u2019s comparable \"in the territory\" requirement.74\n\n*See* *SGS v. Pakistan,* Decision on Jurisdiction at para. 136.\n\n*SGS v. Philippines,* Decision on Jurisdiction at para. 101.\n\n*BIVAC v. Paraguay,* Decision on Jurisdiction at para. 104.\n\n**3. Made in Accordance with Law**\n----------------------------------\n\n118.\n\nArticle 2(1) of the BIT further limits the scope of the Treaty\u2019s application to investments \"made in accordance with [here, Paraguay\u2019s] legislation, including possible admission procedures...\"75 Although the framing of its argument evolved over the course of its pleadings, Respondent in its Reply argued directly that Claimant\u2019s investment was not made in accordance with Paraguayan legislation.\n\nTreaty, Art. 2(1).\n\n119.\n\nRespondent grounded this objection on the contention that, because it is a contract for services, the Contract could not be registered as an investment under Paraguay\u2019s Law No. 60/90, a law providing certain incentives for the investment of capital (including foreign capital), and therefore, according to Respondent, it cannot be an investment under Paraguayan law. Claimant insisted that even if the Contract might not fall within the scope of investments eligible for registration and benefits under Law No. 60/90, the BIT requirement that an investment be \"made in accordance with [the Contracting Party\u2019s] legislation\" concerns the legality of the investment, not the definition of the investment. Respondent, however, maintains that it is not seeking to rely on this domestic law to \"define\" investment, which it accepts is to be defined instead by reference to the BIT, but rather it insists that the law sets the limits of which investments (among those that might be identified as such under the BIT) can be deemed to be \"in accordance with\" Paraguayan law.\n\n120.\n\nThe Tribunal is not persuaded by Respondent\u2019s proffered distinction. Respondent does conflate the *definition* of an investment with the *legality* of an investment. Respondent contends that because the SGS investments cannot be registered under Law No. 60/90, they are not \"in accordance\" with Paraguayan law. But that contention necessarily rests on a definition: Respondent reasons that the SGS Contract cannot be so registered because it does not meet the domestic law\u2019s definition of an investment subject to registration (which is claimed to exclude services contracts). Thus Respondent is, in effect, seeking to substitute Law No. 60/90\u2019s definition of investment for the definition found in the BIT\u2014an approach that we cannot deem compatible with our obligation to interpret and apply the Treaty itself.\n\n121.\n\nOur purpose is not to determine whether or not Claimant\u2019s investment can be registered and receive incentives under Law No. 60/90; we must determine whether the investment is \"made in accordance\" with Paraguay\u2019s laws, as required by the Treaty. Respondent does not contend that the Contract was invalid, or in any way illegal or improper, under Paraguayan law. Indeed, such a suggestion would be surprising given that the Contract was entered into *pursuant* to Paraguayan law, namely Decree No. 12311. Nor does Respondent contend that SGS\u2019s activities under the Contract (such as the customs inspections, or the operation of the liaison offices in Paraguay) were illegal under Paraguayan law. Thus, the assets that this Tribunal has identified as \"investments\" of SGS within the meaning of the BIT are not alleged to have violated Paraguayan law. Moreover, Respondent does not contend that Law No. 60/90 constitutes a mandatory or exclusive procedure for the admission of foreign investments into Paraguay; there is no suggestion that investments made outside its parameters are not permitted in Paraguay.\n\n122.\n\nNor is our analysis affected by Respondent\u2019s argument pointing to the fact that the Switzerland-Paraguay BIT contains this \"in accordance with [the host state\u2019s] legislation\" requirement, whereas other BITs signed by Paraguay (such as with France, Germany, and the Netherlands) do not.76 Respondent contends that this difference reinforces the need to give effect to Article 2(1) here. Quite apart from any claimed distinctions among Paraguay\u2019s treaties, however, the fact is that this Tribunal\u2019s reading *does* give effect to Article 2(1), as we must, by requiring that an investment is not illegal or invalid at the time it is made. The Tribunal\u2019s reading does not give Article 2(1) the more broadly sweeping effect that Respondent would have liked us to attribute to it, but that does not mean the provision is deprived of *efpet utile.*\n\n*See* Respondent\u2019s Reply at para. 69\n\n123.\n\nIn the Tribunal\u2019s view, the object of Article 2(1)\u2019s \"in accordance with [the host state\u2019s] legislation\" provision is to deny the Treaty\u2019s benefits to investments that transgress the host state\u2019s laws at the time the investment was made\u2014a situation not alleged to exist here.77 Accordingly, Respondent\u2019s objection to jurisdiction on this ground is rejected.\n\nThis situation thus differs from, for example, that faced by the *SGS v. Pakistan* tribunal. There, Pakistan indicated that there were questions about the lawfulness of SGS\u2019s actions in entering into the inspection services contract which were the subject of proceedings in Switzerland and Pakistan, and which, if borne out, could be the basis for objections to the tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction on the grounds that SGS had not invested \"in accordance with the laws and regulations\" of Pakistan, as required under the Switzerland-Pakistan BIT. (The tribunal deferred consideration of the issue because there were, at that point, only *potential* allegations of illegality.) *See* *SGS v. Pakistan,* Decision on Jurisdiction at paras. 141-43.\n\n**V. JURISDICTION OVER CLAIMANT\u2019S CLAIMS AS STATED**\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n124.\n\nWe turn now from some of the specific jurisdictional limits imposed by the BIT and the ICSID Convention to Respondent\u2019s broader jurisdictional objections that Claimant has not stated claims under the Treaty over which this Tribunal has jurisdiction, or which are admissible.\n\n**A. Contract Claims and the Impact of the Contract\u2019s Forum Selection Clause**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n125.\n\nBefore turning to the particular substantive Treaty provisions under which Claimant has articulated its claims, however, it is appropriate first to address an issue that potentially affects all of the claims: whether our jurisdiction is precluded by the claims\u2019 contractual roots and, as a consequence, by the Contract\u2019s forum selection clause.\n\n126.\n\nRespondent has objected, in many variations and forms, to this Tribunal\u2019s exercise of jurisdiction over this dispute because Article 9 of the Contract states that \"[a]ny conflict, controversy or claim deriving from or in connection with this Agreement, breach, termination or invalidity, shall be submitted to the Courts of the City of Asunci\u00f3n under the Law of Paraguay.\" In Respondent\u2019s view, Claimant\u2019s claims are, at their core, claims for breach of the Contract, over which Article 9 of the Contract vests exclusive jurisdiction in the domestic courts of Paraguay.\n\n127.\n\nClaimant argues that the Contract\u2019s forum selection clause cannot divest the Tribunal of jurisdiction because Claimant has advanced no claims under the Contract. Claimant maintains that it has asserted claims only for breach of the BIT. Claimant acknowledges that, as a factual matter, the acts and omissions that found its BIT claims may also constitute breaches of the Contract by Paraguay, but Claimant points to the distinction between contract and treaty claims enumerated by previous tribunals, and argues that treaty and contract claims can co-exist and be subject to separate dispute resolution procedures.\n\n128.\n\nIn the Tribunal\u2019s view, the distinction between treaty and contract claims is well established, and it disposes of Respondent\u2019s core objection here. Claimant has advanced claims for breach of the Switzerland-Paraguay BIT: it claims that SGS suffered unfair and inequitable treatment in violation of Article 4(2) of the BIT; that its use and enjoyment of its investment was impaired by undue and discriminatory measures of the authorities of Paraguay in violation of Article 4(1) of the BIT; and that the Republic of Paraguay failed to constantly guarantee the observance of commitments it had entered into with respect to the investments of SGS, in violation of Article 11 of the BIT.\n\n129.\n\nClaimant has not asked this Tribunal to decide claims by SGS under the Contract for breach of that Contract. We note in passing that the Treaty\u2019s dispute resolution provisions are arguably broad enough that Claimant would have been entitled to do so: Article 9 provides for the resolution of \"disputes with respect to investments between a Contracting Party and an investor of the other Contracting Party,\" and, as discussed in Section IV.A above, Article 9(2) contains Paraguay\u2019s consent to international arbitration of such a dispute. There is no qualification or limitation in this language on the types of \"disputes with respect to investments\" that a Swiss investor may bring against the Republic of Paraguay. The ordinary meaning of Article 9 would appear to give this Tribunal jurisdiction to hear claims for violation of Claimant\u2019s rights under the Contract\u2014surely a dispute \"with respect to\" Claimant\u2019s investment\u2014should Claimant have chosen to bring them before us. But Claimant has not done so.\n\n130.\n\nOf course, it is apparent that several of Claimant\u2019s claims under the Treaty will stem from Respondent\u2019s alleged failure to pay for SGS\u2019s services under the Contract. That is an action that may (or may not) also constitute a contractual breach, but we are not called upon to decide that question as such. We are called upon to decide whether Respondent\u2019s actions, such as its alleged non-payment, breach the aforementioned Articles of the Treaty. In doing so, we are in concert with the well-established jurisprudence regarding the distinction between contract claims and treaty claims.\n\n131.\n\nThe *ad hoc* committee in *Vivendi I* aptly described this distinction:\n\n[W]hether there has been a breach of the BIT and whether there has been a breach of contract are different questions. Each of these claims will be determined by reference to its own proper or applicable law \u2014 in the case of the BIT, by international law; in the case of the Concession Contract, by the proper law of the contract....78\n\nThe committee rightly noted that \"[a] state may breach a treaty without breaching a contract, and *vice versa.\"79* It is also possible that the same act of the State will breach both the treaty and a contract, but in this case we are asked to consider only the former question.\n\n*Compania de Aguas del Aconquija SA. and Vivendi Universal v. Argentine Republic,* ICSID Case No. ARB/97/3, Decision on Annulment, 3 July 2002, at para. 96 *(\u2018Vivendi I,* Annulment\").\n\n*Vivendi I,* Annulment at para. 95.\n\n132.\n\nOther investment treaty arbitration decisions are in accord. The tribunal in *SGS v. Pakistan* averred that \"[a]s a matter of general principle, the same set of facts can give rise to different claims grounded on differing legal orders: the municipal and the international legal orders.\"80 Likewise, the tribunal in *Impregilo v. Pakistan* held that \"contrary to Pakistan\u2019s approach in this case, the fact that a breach may give rise to a contract claim does not mean that it cannot also \u2014 and separately \u2014 give rise to a treaty claim. Even if the two perfectly coincide, they remain analytically distinct, and necessarily require different enquiries.\"81 And the *Agurix* tribunal was clear that claims that are rooted in contractual performance are not thereby excluded from the treaty sphere: \"Even if the dispute as presented by the Claimant may involve the interpretation or analysis of facts related to performance under the Concession Agreement, the Tribunal considers that, to the extent that such issues are relevant to a breach of the obligations of the Respondent under the BIT, they cannot *per se* transform the dispute under the BIT into a contractual dispute.\"82\n\n*SGS v. Pakistan,* Decision on Jurisdiction at para. 147.\n\n*Impregilo v. Pakistan,* Decision on Jurisdiction at para. 258.\n\n*Azurix Corp. v. Argentine Republic,* ICSID Case No. ARB/01/12, Decision on Jurisdiction, 8 December 2003, at para. 76 *(\u2018Azurix v. Argentina,* Decision on Jurisdiction\").\n\n133.\n\nRespondent has insisted that to adopt and apply this distinction between treaty claims and contract claims here is to improperly defer to Claimant\u2019s mere \"labeling\" of its claims. According to Respondent, the Tribunal \"need not accept uncritically SGS\u2019s characterization of its claim as a treaty violation.\"83 Respondent would have us examine Claimant\u2019s claims and conclude that they are in fact contract claims that have merely been dressed as BIT claims.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply at para. 79.\n\n134.\n\nIn Respondent\u2019s view, the reason the claims are properly characterized as strictly contractual is because Claimant has alleged no more than non-performance of contractual obligations (principally, the obligation to make payment). Respondent maintains that a State\u2019s nonperformance of a contract cannot, without more, give rise to a breach of a BIT; Claimant must show (and in Respondent\u2019s view it has not shown) more: sovereign interference, *jure imperii,* acts beyond the ordinary conduct of a commercial counterparty.\n\n135.\n\nThe Tribunal notes here the challenge of drawing a line between an ordinary commercial breach of contract and acts of sovereign interference or *jure imperii,* particularly in the context of a contract entered into directly with a State organ (here, the Ministry of Finance). Logically, one can characterize every act by a sovereign State as a \"sovereign act\"\u2014including the State\u2019s acts to breach or terminate contracts to which the State is a party. It is thus difficult to articulate a basis on which the State\u2019s actions, solely because they occur in the context of a contract or a commercial transaction, are somehow no longer acts of the State, for which the State may be held internationally responsible.\n\n136.\n\nIn any event the Tribunal need not, and cannot, at this stage decide whether Claimant has made a showing of Treaty breach. As we explained in Section III.B above, the threshold at the jurisdictional stage is whether the facts alleged by Claimant could, if proven, make out a claim under the Treaty. Claimant maintains it has alleged sufficiently \"sovereign\" acts in connection with contractual non-performance; Respondent maintains it has not. Resolution of that dispute is properly reserved to such time as both Parties have fully presented their evidence and arguments.\n\n137.\n\nReturning to the question whether Claimant has adequately articulated claims under the Treaty (rather than the Contract), this Tribunal, like the tribunal in *SGS v. Pakistan,* is generally of the view that \"at this jurisdiction phase, it is for the Claimant to characterize the claims as it sees fit.\"84 As the *Vivendi I ad hoc* committee observed, \"[i]t was open to Claimants to claim, and they did claim, that these acts [in breach of administrative law or the contract] taken together, or some of them, amounted to a breach of Articles 3 and/or 5 of the [France-Argentina] BIT.\"85 Likewise, here, it is open to Claimant to contend that acts or omissions of the Paraguayan authorities\u2014acts or omissions that may (or may not) have breached the Contract\u2014also breached the provisions of the Switzerland-Paraguay BIT. Whether Claimant has managed to state claims under those Articles that are legally and factually adequate for jurisdictional purposes is a question we will address claim-by-claim in Section V.B below.\n\n*SGS v. Pakistan,* Decision on Jurisdiction at para. 145.\n\n*Vivendi I,* Annulment at para. 112.\n\n138.\n\nGiven that the Tribunal does not adopt Respondent\u2019s characterization of Claimant\u2019s claims as contractual rather than treaty claims, the Contract\u2019s forum selection clause is readily disposed of. That is, if Claimant had not advanced claims for breach of the Treaty and had brought forward only claims for breach of the Contract, we would be faced with different questions, including the relationship between Article 9 of the Contract (providing for dispute resolution of contract claims in the courts of the City of Asunci\u00f3n) and Article 9 of the BIT (providing for resolution of \"disputes with respect to investments\"). Here, however, we accept that Claimant has stated claims under the Treaty, and so the question before us is simply whether a contractual forum selection clause can divest this Tribunal of its jurisdiction to hear claims for breach of the Treaty. The answer to that question is undoubtedly negative.\n\n139.\n\nOn this point, both the **Vivendi I** tribunal and the **Vivendi I** annulment committee were in agreement. According to the tribunal, a forum selection clause of a contract \"does not divest this Tribunal of jurisdiction to hear this case because that provision did not and could not constitute a waiver by [claimant] of its rights under Article 8 of the BIT to file the pending claims against the Argentine Republic.\"86 The forum-selection clause \"of the Concession Contract cannot be deemed to prevent the investor from proceeding under the ICSID Convention against the Argentine Republic on a claim charging the Argentine Republic with a violation of the Argentine-French BIT.\"87\n\n*Compa\u00f1\u00eda de Aguas del Aconquija SA. and Vivendi Universal v. Argentine Republic,* ICSID Case No. ARB/97/3, Award, 21 November 2000, at para. 53 *(\u2018Vivendi I,* Award\").\n\n*Vivendi I,* Award at para. 54.\n\n140.\n\nAnd according to the *ad hoc* committee:\n\nIn the Committee\u2019s view, it is not open to an ICSID tribunal having jurisdiction under a BIT in respect of a claim based upon a substantive provision of that BIT, to dismiss the claim on the ground that it could or should have been dealt with by a national court. In such a case, the inquiry which the ICSID tribunal is required to undertake is one governed by the ICSID Convention, by the BIT and by applicable international law. Such an inquiry is neither in principle determined, nor precluded, by any issue of municipal law, including any municipal law agreement of the parties.\n\nMoreover the Committee does not understand how, if there had been a breach of the BIT in the present case (a question of international law), the existence of Article 16(4) of the Concession Contract could have prevented its characterisation as such. A state cannot rely on an exclusive jurisdiction clause in a contract to avoid the characterisation of its conduct as internationally unlawful under a treaty.88\n\n*Vivendi l,* Annulment at paras. 102-03.\n\n141.\n\nIt further explained:\n\n[W]here \"the fundamental basis of the claim\" is a treaty laying down an independent standard by which the conduct of the parties is to be judged, the existence of an exclusive jurisdiction clause in a contract between the claimant and the respondent state or one of its subdivisions cannot operate as a bar to the application of the treaty standard.89\n\n*Vivendi I,* Annulment at para. 101. Conversely, according to the *Vivendi I ad hoc* committee, \"[i]n a case where the essential basis of a claim brought before an international tribunal is a breach of contract, the tribunal will give effect to any valid choice of forum clause in the contract.\" *Vivendi I,* Annulment at para. 98. The committee made that statement in reliance on the ***Woodruff*** case, in which jurisdiction was declined based upon a contractual waiver of international rights to claim against the state. *See Vivendi I,* Annulment at paras. 97-99 (citing ***Woodruff*** Case, IX Rep. of Int\u2019l Arb. Awards 213 (1903) (Venezuela Mixed Claims Commission) (\" ***Woodruff*** Case\")). As we have noted, because Claimant here presses claims under only the Treaty, we have no occasion to address this aspect of the *Vivendi I* committee\u2019s analysis.\n\n142.\n\nIn anticipation of the analysis of Claimant\u2019s claims under Article 11 of the Treaty in Section V.B.3 below, we note that in our view, this rule applies with equal force in the context of an umbrella clause. It has been argued that, if the umbrella clause violation is premised on a failure to observe a *contractual* commitment, one cannot say (in the *Vivendi I* annulment committee\u2019s words) that the \"\u2018fundamental basis of the claim\u2019 is a treaty laying down an independent standard by which the conduct of the parties is to be judged\"\u2014because, for that type of umbrella clause claim, the treaty applies no legal standard that is independent of the contract. But that argument ignores the source in the treaty of the State\u2019s claimed obligation to abide by its commitments, contractual or otherwise. Even if the alleged breach of the treaty obligation depends upon a showing that a contract or other qualifying commitment has been breached, the source of the obligation cited by the claimant, and hence the source of the claim, remains the treaty itself.90\n\n*See also* discussion at Section V.B.3 below.\n\n**B. Has Claimant Stated Claims over Which the Tribunal Has Jurisdiction?**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n143.\n\nWe turn now to the question whether Claimant has adequately set forth claims for violation of Articles 4(2), 4(1), and 11 of the Treaty.\n\n**1. Fair and Equitable Treatment**\n-----------------------------------\n\n144.\n\nArticle 4(2) of the Treaty provides that \"[e]ach Contracting Party shall ensure fair and equitable treatment within its territory of the investments of the investors of the other contracting Party.\" Claimant maintains that Respondent has breached this Treaty obligation.\n\n145.\n\nRespondent objected to the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction over this claim because, according to Respondent, even if proven on the merits, Claimant\u2019s allegations would fail to establish any breach of the fair and equitable treatment standard. At the core of Respondent\u2019s objection is the premise that, to support a claim for Treaty breach, Claimant must allege acts or omissions beyond those that an ordinary counterparty to a contract may take. Respondent argued that Claimant\u2019s claim rests on allegations of non-payment under the Contract, and that no breach of the fair and equitable treatment standard can be shown based on simple non-payment.\n\n146.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that the facts alleged by Claimant, if proven, are capable of coming within the purview of the fair and equitable treatment provision of the BIT. First, a State\u2019s non-payment under a contract is, in the view of the Tribunal, capable of giving rise to a breach of a fair and equitable treatment requirement, such as, perhaps, where the nonpayment amounts to a repudiation of the contract, frustration of its economic purpose, or substantial deprivation of its value. Whether anything more than a wrongful refusal to pay, and, if so, what more, is required to prevail on a claim of breach of a fair and equitable treatment standard are questions for the merits.\n\n147.\n\nSecond, whether or not one were to accept Respondent\u2019s premise that a State\u2019s non-payment under a contract, alone, cannot give rise to a Treaty breach, it is the case that, here, Claimant alleges more than mere non-payment. It is true that, fundamentally, Claimant contends that Respondent arbitrarily and unjustly refused to compensate SGS for services rendered, and unjustly enriched the State by enjoying the benefits of SGS\u2019s services for nearly four years without paying for them. Claimant claims that Respondent thereby breached the Treaty by frustrating SGS\u2019s legitimate expectations.\n\n148.\n\nBut while Claimant contends that SGS was entitled to expect that Paraguay would abide by the Contract and Paraguayan law, and that it would be compensated for services rendered to the State under the Contract, Claimant\u2019s Article 4(2) claim does not rest on that alone. In addition to this baseline expectation of contractual compliance, Claimant contends that it had also specific legitimate expectations based on multiple written and oral representations allegedly made by representatives of Paraguay to SGS, in which, according to Claimant, the State acknowledged the debt owed and promised that it would honor the Contract and make payment. Those expectations, according to Claimant, were frustrated when Paraguay failed to live up to any of its alleged undertakings.\n\n149.\n\nClaimant also contends generally that Respondent acted in bad faith, capriciously, arbitrarily and in a non-transparent manner towards SGS. In particular, Claimant alleges that Respondent subjected SGS to spurious administrative investigations that, according to Claimant, were not required by law or fact but instead were conducted with the purpose of thwarting or delaying payments due to SGS. According to Claimant, these internal administrative investigations lacked transparency, were untimely and unnecessary and again contradicted various Paraguayan officials\u2019 alleged acknowledgments of the debt owed to SGS at the time the investigations were conducted.\n\n150.\n\nOf course, our recitation of these allegations does not reflect any views on the Tribunal\u2019s part about their veracity or about whether Claimant will be able to prove them at the merits stage. The point is simply that Claimant\u2019s allegations with respect to unfair or inequitable treatment by Paraguay extend beyond mere non-payment in breach of the Contract. Thus the necessary premise of Respondent\u2019s objection\u2014that Claimant is alleging only nonpayment\u2014fails, and its objection to jurisdiction on that ground must be rejected.\n\n151.\n\nFor both of the foregoing reasons, the Tribunal is content that Claimant has met\u2014at this stage\u2014the requirements for a claim for breach of Article 4(2) of the BIT, and Claimant\u2019s fair and equitable treatment claim should be taken up on the merits.\n\n**2. Undue and Discriminatory Measures**\n----------------------------------------\n\n152.\n\nArticle 4(1) of the Treaty provides that \"[e]ach Contracting Party...shall not impair, through undue or discriminatory measures, the management, maintenance, use, enjoyment, extension, sale and, should it so happen, liquidation of such investments.\" Claimant contends that Respondent impaired SGS\u2019s use and enjoyment of its investments through undue and discriminatory measures in violation of this Treaty protection.\n\n153.\n\nClaimant\u2019s claims under Article 4(1) rest on many of the same factual allegations discussed under Article 4(2) above. Claimant focuses, however, on what it sees as the allegedly unjustified nature of Respondent\u2019s acts and omissions\u2014that is, the \"undue\" prong of the quoted provision of Article 4(1).91\n\nBoth Claimant and Respondent are apparently content to equate the adjectives \"undue and discriminatory\" in Article 4(1) with \"arbitrary.\" Indeed, Claimant\u2019s Rejoinder even uses the heading \"Undue and Arbitrary Measures\" for its discussion of its Article 4(1) claim. The Tribunal does not take issue with this approach, but merely takes note that Claimant has not advanced arguments that Respondent\u2019s actions were discriminatory in the sense of singling out SGS as a Swiss investor (or otherwise).\n\n154.\n\nClaimant thus argues that the alleged decision of Paraguay not to abide by the Contract was unjustified and unreasonable, and was taken for political purposes and in bad faith. Claimant contends that Respondent\u2019s continued refusal to pay SGS\u2019s debt was likewise unreasonable in view of the alleged repeated acknowledgements by Paraguayan officials regarding the existence and amount of the outstanding debt, and in light of the alleged results of Paraguay\u2019s own internal investigations concerning the Contract. In this vein, Claimant alleges, for example, that the Ministry of Finance willfully refused to disburse amounts allocated in the national budget for payments to SGS, and that this action demonstrates that the Government\u2019s failure to make payment to SGS was based on political reasons.\n\n155.\n\nClaimant also argues that Respondent\u2019s non-payment was a breach of Article 4(1) because, Claimant contends, it occurred in disregard of Paraguayan domestic law and international law. Claimant further alleges that the administrative investigations instigated by Respondent lacked factual or legal justification, and that Respondent\u2019s alleged refusals to abide by the results of its own internal reports amounted to a willful disregard of due process of law.\n\n156.\n\nRespondent objected that Claimant failed to allege any undue or discriminatory measures that impaired its investment. However, most of Respondent\u2019s objections in this instance were based on the facts themselves and not on any claimed insufficiency of Claimant\u2019s factual allegations. For example, Respondent claimed that the alleged debt to SGS was not acknowledged, and that the internal reports cited by Claimant are not binding under Paraguayan law. On that basis, Respondent maintained that it was not unreasonable for Respondent to refrain from paying the amounts claimed by SGS. As another example, Respondent alleged that investigations of SGS were justified by the cost of the Contract to Paraguay and by corruption in the pre-shipment inspection industry.\n\n157.\n\nJust as Claimant will have a full opportunity to adduce evidence in support of its factual allegations, Respondent will have a full opportunity to rebut those allegations\u2014at the merits stage. Disputes over the facts, however, are not a proper basis for an objection that Claimant has failed to state a sufficient claim under Article 4(1) over which this Tribunal can exercise jurisdiction. Whether Paraguay\u2019s investigations were justified or unjustified, for example, is a question for the merits; for purposes of exercising jurisdiction, however, the allegation that they were unjustified\u2014and thus allegedly \"undue\"\u2014is sufficient to state a proper claim under Article 4(1). To the extent Respondent challenged Claimant\u2019s Article 4(1) claims on the facts, Respondent\u2019s arguments present no obstacles to this Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction.\n\n158.\n\nEven those objections that were articulated in terms of the sufficiency of Claimant\u2019s claims (rather than in terms of contesting Claimant\u2019s factual allegations) are also tied up in factual and legal contentions that must be resolved on the merits. For example, Respondent maintains that the debt claimed by SGS is unliquidated, and that Claimant therefore cannot have suffered any impairment because Paraguay has not refused to pay a final judgment against it. In effect, this invites an assessment of whether Paraguay\u2019s alleged non-payment is excusable\u2014clearly a question for the merits.\n\n159.\n\nLikewise, Respondent\u2019s objection that an omission to include the alleged debt in Paraguay\u2019s national budget is still nothing more than a failure to pay, and lacks **jure imperii,** does not exclude jurisdiction. As noted above, the Tribunal doubts whether a State\u2019s failure to pay under a contract necessarily lacks **jure imperii,** or (stated differently) whether an additional showing of *jure imperii* is required. But even if one were to assume *arguendo* that *jure imperii* was required, the answer to whether it was present here would depend on inquiries, such as an inquiry into the nature of Paraguay\u2019s budgeting process, that are beyond the scope of a jurisdictional analysis. It is sufficient at this stage that the alleged budget episodes could (perhaps depending on their details) make out a claim for undue or arbitrary treatment.\n\n160.\n\nRespondent also contended that Claimant can assert no due process violations, because SGS has never sought its day in court in Paraguay. Whether or not one could be persuaded that concepts of due process are applicable only to court proceedings, as Respondent claimed,92 this argument simply rests too much on Claimant\u2019s passing use of the term \"due process.\" In essence, Claimant maintains that Respondent\u2019s behavior\u2014 *i.e.,* non-payment notwithstanding alleged internal government reports that were claimed to be in SGS\u2019s favor\u2014was \"undue\" or arbitrary. Regardless of whether or not that behavior can also be characterized as contrary to due process, the question before the Tribunal is whether it can be characterized as \"undue or discriminatory\" within the meaning of Article 4(1)\u2014and that is a question to be resolved on the merits. Accordingly, Respondent\u2019s argument does not present a basis for declining jurisdiction over this aspect of Claimant\u2019s Article 4(1) claim.\n\n*See* Respondent\u2019s Reply at para. ill.\n\n161.\n\nIn sum, we consider that the facts alleged by Claimant, if proven, are capable of coming within the purview of Article 4(1)\u2019s prohibition on impairment of an investment by undue and discriminatory measures. Claimant\u2019s undue and discriminatory measures claims will be considered on the merits.\n\n**3. Observance of Commitments**\n--------------------------------\n\n162.\n\nArticle 11 of the Treaty provides, in its entirety, that \"[e]ither Contracting Party shall constantly guarantee the observance of the commitments it has entered into with respect to the investments of the investors of the other Contracting Party.\"\n\n163.\n\nClaimant contends that Respondent failed to observe the commitments it entered into with respect to Claimant\u2019s investment, in violation of Article 11 of the BIT. Specifically, Claimant argues that Respondent\u2019s failure to pay the amounts due to SGS under the Contract constituted a breach of Respondent\u2019s commitments to Claimant. In addition, Claimant argues that Respondent\u2019s failure to abide by subsequent alleged promises to honor the Contract and to pay such debts also represents a breach of Respondent\u2019s Treaty obligation under Article 11.\n\n164.\n\nRespondent objected that Claimant failed to allege a breach of Article 11. Respondent argued that an \"umbrella clause\" provision in a BIT such as Article 11 cannot \"elevate a pure breach of a commercial contract into a treaty violation.\"93 In its Reply, Respondent argued that an umbrella clause is implicated only if the host state abuses its power or exerts undue governmental interference in breaching a contract or any other type of undertaking. In Respondent\u2019s view, any ordinary commercial counterparty could fail to pay under a contract, and Claimant has failed to allege that Paraguay committed any other wrongful action constituting an abuse of governmental power. On that basis, Respondent contended that Claimant did not allege a viable claim under Article 11.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply at para. 88.\n\n165.\n\nRespondent adopted additional arguments in its later submission discussing the *BIVAC v. Paraguay* decision (which was issued after the Parties\u2019 original briefing and the hearing on jurisdiction). While maintaining its argument that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction over Claimant\u2019s Article 11 claim as stated, Respondent argued, in the alternative, that this Tribunal should follow the *BIVAC* tribunal\u2019s approach and find the Article 11 claim to be inadmissible in light of the Contract\u2019s forum selection clause in favor of the courts of the City of Asuncion.\n\n166.\n\nAs a first step in our analysis, we turn back to Claimant\u2019s claims under Article 11. As noted above, Claimant has not asked this Tribunal to adjudicate directly any claims for breach of the Contract as such. Claimant has, however, put before us Treaty claims under Article 11. The predicate for those claims is one or more breaches of the State\u2019s commitments to SGS\u2014some of which commitments are, indeed, to be found in the Contract. But that does not alter the fact that, for purposes of the long-recognized distinction between contract and treaty claims discussed in Section V.A above, we are presented with claims under Article 11 of the Treaty.\n\n167.\n\nOn this basis, we have little difficulty in finding jurisdiction over Claimant\u2019s claims under Article 11. That article creates an obligation for the State to constantly guarantee observance of its commitments entered into with respect to investments of investors of the other Party. The obligation has no limitations on its face\u2014it apparently applies to all such commitments, whether established by contract or by law, unilaterally or bilaterally, etc. Not all of Claimant\u2019s Article 11 claims are predicated on breach of the Contract itself: Claimant has also alleged that Paraguayan officials subsequently made various oral and written commitments to respect the Contract and to make payment of amounts owed to SGS, which commitments were allegedly breached. But even as to the Article 11 claims that are predicated directly on Paraguay\u2019s alleged breach of the Contract, we have no hesitation in treating the Contract\u2019s obligations as \"commitments\" within the meaning of Article 11.\n\n168.\n\nGiven the unqualified text of Article 11 of the Treaty, and its ordinary meaning, we see no basis to import into Article 11 the non-textual limitations that Respondent proposed in its Reply. Article 11 does not exclude commercial contracts of the State from its scope. Likewise, Article 11 does not state that its constant guarantee of observance of such commitments may be breached only through actions that a commercial counterparty cannot take, through abuses of state power, or through exertions of undue government influence. Respondent\u2019s appeal to the putative \"true meaning\"94 of umbrella clauses cannot take precedence over the plain language of the umbrella clause that is before us. In effect, we see no basis on the face of the clause to believe that it should mean anything other than what it says\u2014that the State is obliged to guarantee the observance of its commitments with respect to the investments of the other State party\u2019s investors.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply at para. 86.\n\n169.\n\nThe Tribunal necessarily acknowledges that in so holding, it is parting ways with the decision in *SGS v. Pakistan,* which addressed an umbrella clause in the Switzerland-Pakistan BIT that is worded identically to Article 11 of the Switzerland-Paraguay BIT.95 In *SGS v. Pakistan,* concerns that \"the scope of [the umbrella clause]...appears susceptible of almost indefinite expansion,\" and that the consequences of reading the clause literally to include contractual commitments would be \"far-reaching in scope,\" led the tribunal to decide that the clause\u2019s ordinary meaning could not be followed unless it saw clear and convincing evidence that the State party signatories intended those consequences.96 To the contrary, we believe that Article Il\u2019s ordinary meaning must be respected, as required by the Vienna Convention (Article 31(1))- Without revisiting the extensive legal commentaries that have engaged the umbrella clause issue since the **SGS v. Pakistan** decision, we note that it has emerged that at least one State party indeed intended the provision to have its literal reach: the Swiss government is on record objecting to the **SGS v. Pakistan** holding and opining that a violation of such a contractual commitment is covered by the umbrella clause and should be subject to the Treaty\u2019s dispute settlement procedures.97\n\nThe **SGS v. Philippines** tribunal suggested that it reached a different result from the ***SGS v. Pakistan*** tribunal and gave full effect to the umbrella clause based at least in part on differences between the umbrella clause language of the Switzerland-Philippines BIT and the supposedly less direct or less specific language of the umbrella clause in the Switzerland-Pakistan BIT. *See* *SGS v. Philippines,* Decision on Jurisdiction at para. 119. However, the Swiss government, in a note on its interpretation of the Switzerland-Pakistan BIT that was circulated following the ***SGS v. Pakistan*** decision, described that same language\u2014identical to the language before this Tribunal\u2014as being directed to \"a commitment to a specific investment or a specific investor.\" *See* \"Interpretation of Article 11 of the Bilateral Investment Treaty between Switzerland and Pakistan in Light of the Decision of the Tribunal on Objections to Jurisdiction of ICSID in Case No. ARB/01/13 SGS Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale de Surveillance S.A. versus Islamic Republic of Pakistan,\" Note under Cover of Letter from Swiss Government to ICSID Deputy Secretary-General, 1 October 2003, 19 Mealey\u2019s INT\u2019L Arb. Rep. E-1, E-2 (Feb. 2004) (Ex. CLA-47) (\"Swiss Government Note\"). Thus the Swiss Government, at least, evidently did not understand such language to be general or non-specific. Inasmuch as we reach the same result on jurisdiction as the **SGS v. Philippines** tribunal, on the basis of the same Treaty language as was before the ***SGS v. Pakistan*** tribunal, it follows that this Tribunal does not see the language as meaningfully different. That is, we do not consider that the wording of Article 11 of the Treaty is so general or hortatory as to preclude reading it as an obligation of the State to comply with, *inter alia,* its contractual commitments.\n\n*SGS v. Pakistan,* Decision on Jurisdiction at paras. 166-67.\n\n*See* Swiss Government Note at p. E-2.\n\n170.\n\nIn permitting the umbrella clause to encompass host State commitments of all kinds, including contractual commitments, we are in agreement with the tribunals in *SGS v.* *Philippines* and *BIVAC v. Paraguay,* among others.98 Like the *BIVAC* tribunal, we conclude that the umbrella clause before us \"establishes an international obligation for the parties to the BIT to observe contractual obligation[s] with respect to investors\" and that this interpretation is necessary to give the umbrella clause purpose and effect.99\n\n*See* *SGS v. Philippines,* Decision on Jurisdiction at paras. 114-28; *BIVAC v. Paraguay,* Decision on Jurisdiction at paras. 134-42. *See also* *Noble Ventures, Inc. v. Romania,* ICSID Case No. ARB/01/11, Award, 12 October 2005, at paras. 51-62; *Duke Energy Electroquil Partners V Electroquil SA. v. Republic of Ecuador,* ICSID Case No ARB/04/19, Award, 18 August 2008, at paras. 317-25; *Eureko BV. v. Republic of Poland,* Partial Award, 19 August 2005, at paras. 257-60.\n\n*BIVAC v. Paraguay,* Decision on Jurisdiction at para 141. We reach that conclusion notwithstanding the fact that the language of the umbrella clause before us arguably is not as broad or explicit as the Netherlands-Paraguay BIT considered in *BIVAC.*\n\n171.\n\nThus the Tribunal finds that it has jurisdiction over Claimant\u2019s claims under Article 11 that Paraguay failed to observe commitments it allegedly made to SGS, both under the Contract and under its alleged subsequent oral and written promises to make good on the claimed debt to SGS. And having found jurisdiction, we are of course mindful of the *Vivendi I* annulment committee\u2019s admonition that a \"[t]ribunal, faced with such a claim and having validly held that it had jurisdiction, [is] obliged to consider and to decide it.\"100\n\n*Vivendi I,* Annulment at para. 112\n\n172.\n\nIt is from that standpoint that we must address the latest proposition put to us by Respondent: that this Tribunal should adopt the rest of the **BIVAC** tribunal\u2019s analysis, and find that we will not hear Claimant\u2019s umbrella clause claims arising out of the Contract\u2014 claims over which we have jurisdiction\u2014because the parties to the Contract included a forum selection clause directing disputes under it to Paraguayan domestic courts. The **BIVAC** tribunal accepted that the umbrella clause in the Netherlands-Paraguay BIT encompassed obligations under the BIVAC contract into the Treaty, giving the tribunal jurisdiction, but insisted that all of the contract\u2019s obligations\u2014including its forum selection clause\u2014must then be given effect in that treaty setting.101 On that basis, the *BIVAC* tribunal found the umbrella clause claims to be inadmissible and left open only the question of whether to stay them or dismiss them outright. Given the extensive factual commonalities of the cases confronting both tribunals, including Paraguayan contracts for pre-shipment inspection services that are claimed to be substantially if not entirely identical, we have of course considered carefully the reasoned analysis of that distinguished tribunal.\n\nIn this Tribunal\u2019s view, however, a decision to decline to hear SGS\u2019s claims under Article 11 on the grounds that they should instead be directed to the courts of Asunci\u00f3n would place the Tribunal at risk of failing to carry out its mandate under the Treaty and the ICSID Convention.\n\n*BIVAC v. Paraguay,* Decision on Jurisdiction, at paras. 142-58.\n\n173.\n\nFirst, Claimant\u2019s Article 11 claims are not co-extensive with claims under the Contract, and they are not necessarily disposed of by the four comers of the Contract. Claimant has advanced Article 11 claims not only for breach of the Contract\u2019s payment obligation but also for breach of alleged subsequent commitments by Paraguay\u2019s representatives. Whether or not both might be within the reach of the Contract\u2019s broadly worded forum selection clause,102 the latter cannot be judged under the Contract alone. Whether Paraguayan representatives made the alleged commitments, whether those commitments could be relied upon by SGS, and whether the commitments were breached, must all be decided by this Tribunal with reference to the Treaty and the applicable bodies of law specified under it. Accordingly, it would sweep too broadly to say that all umbrella clause claims\u2014and, in particular, all of the umbrella clause claims before us\u2014can be disposed of on contractual grounds by the contractual forum.\n\n\"Any conflict, controversy or claim deriving from or in connection with this Agreement, breach, termination or invalidity, shall be submitted to the Courts of the City of Asunci\u00f3n under the Law of Paraguay.\" Art. 9.1, Contract (Ex. C-4).\n\n174.\n\nSecond, even to the extent that certain of the Article 11 claims may be co-extensive with claims under the Contract, the Tribunal is not persuaded that this presents a basis to find them inadmissible. Respondent argued strenuously, in many forms, that the fundamental basis of Claimant\u2019s claims\u2014and in particular Claimant\u2019s umbrella clause claims\u2014is the Contract and not the Treaty. From that premise, as we noted earlier,103 one might contend that, at least for the Contract-based claims, the Article 11 breach will not be assessed under an independent, international law standard in the Treaty, but rather under the Contract. But that is an argument for declining *jurisdiction,* not for inadmissibility, and this Tribunal has already rejected that jurisdictional argument.\n\n*See* discussion at para. 142 above.\n\n175.\n\nFor the reasons set forth in Section V.A and in the first part of this Section V.B.3, this Tribunal\u2014like the *BIVAC* tribunal\u2014has found that we have jurisdiction over Claimant\u2019s Article 11 claims. And having so found jurisdiction, we do not see a basis for finding such claims inadmissible. To the contrary, having found jurisdiction, we would have to have very strong cause indeed to decline to exercise it.104\n\n*See Vivendi I,* Annulment at para. 102 (\"In the Committee\u2019s view, it is not open to an ICSID tribunal having jurisdiction under a BIT in respect of a claim based upon a substantive provision of that BIT, to dismiss the claim on the ground that it could or should have been dealt with by a national court. In such a case, the inquiry which the ICSID tribunal is required to undertake is one governed by the ICSID Convention, by the BIT and by applicable international law. Such an inquiry is neither in principle determined, nor precluded, by any issue of municipal law, including any municipal law agreement of the parties.\").\n\n176.\n\nThird, as noted above, one reason to read Article 11 as providing jurisdiction over contractual claims is to give purpose and effect to that provision. The State parties to the BIT intended to provide this Treaty protection in addition to whatever rights the investor could negotiate for itself in a contract or could find under domestic law, and they gave the investor the option to enforce it, including through arbitrations such as this one.105 It would be incongruous to find jurisdiction on this basis, but then to dismiss the greater part of all Article 11 claims on admissibility grounds\u2014because the effect would be, once again, to divest the provision of its core purpose and effect, to the same extent as if we had denied jurisdiction outright. As Professor Gaillard put it when assessing the approach taken by the tribunal in *SGS v. Philippines (i.e.,* accepting jurisdiction but then staying the tribunal\u2019s resolution of the claim):\n\n[T]o the extent this solution recognises, \"in principle,\" an investor\u2019s right to choose an international arbitral tribunal for the settlement of its investment disputes and, in the same breath, requires that the selected tribunal stay the proceedings on the basis of an exclusive forum selection clause contained in the investment contract, it results in the BIT tribunal having jurisdiction over an empty shell and depriving the BIT dispute resolution process of any meaning.106\n\n*See, e.g,* *SGS v. Philippines,* Decision on Jurisdiction, Declaration of Prof. Crivellaro at paras. 3, 5.\n\nProf. Emmanuel Gaillard, *Investment Treaty Arbitration and Jurisdiction over Contract Claims\u2014the SGS Cases Considered, in* International Investment Law and Arbitration: Leading Cases from the ICSID, NAFTA, Bilateral Investment Treaties and Customary International Law 325, 334 (2005). *See also* Thomas W. W\u00e4lde, *Energy Charter Treaty-based Investment Arbitration,* 5 J. WORLD Inv. & Trade 373, 393 (2004) (discussing *SGS v. Philippines* as \"impractical,\" having \"recognizejd] the effect of the \u2018umbrella clause\u2019 to bring a contract dispute to the level of international law but reversed this, in effect, by giving full effect to a national court\u2019s jurisdiction clause\").\n\n177.\n\nFourth, this Tribunal is concerned that to dismiss umbrella clause claims as inadmissible on the ground that a forum selection clause is applicable to the parties\u2019 commitments under the Contract will be, in effect, to read an implied waiver of BIT rights into every investment agreement that specifies a dispute resolution mechanism other than ICSID\u2014a result we would not embrace.\n\n178.\n\nThe *BIVAC* tribunal reasoned that because the claimant\u2019s contract post-dated the BIT, it should take precedence: \"[t]he parties could have included a provision in [the forum selection clause] to the effect that the obligations it imposed were without prejudice to any rights under the BIT, including the possible exercise of jurisdiction by\" a treaty tribunal under the umbrella clause.107 While the same sequence is in play here\u2014the Switzerland-Paraguay BIT entered into force in 1992, while the Contract was concluded in 1996\u2014we would reverse the presumption. Given the significance of investors\u2019 rights under the Treaty, and of the international law \"safety net\" of protections that they are meant to provide separate from and supplementary to domestic law regimes, they should not lightly be assumed to have been waived. Assuming *arguendo* that the parties to the later-in-time Contract could have expressly excluded the right to resort to arbitration under the extant BIT, at least as to Contract-based claims under Article 11,108 they did not do so\u2014and we would not take their silence as effecting that same waiver of Treaty rights.\n\n*BIVAC v. Paraguay,* Decision on Jurisdiction at para. 146.\n\nThere is a serious question whether individuals are capable of waiving rights conferred upon them by a treaty between two States. *See* *SGS v. Philippines,* Decision on Jurisdiction at para. 154. The tribunals in *Azurix v. Argentina* and *Aguas del Tunari v. Bolivia* both sidestepped a direct ruling on the question, although the tribunal in *Aguas del Tunari* indicated it would have been prepared to give effect to a clear, express waiver of ICSID jurisdiction. *See* *Azurix v. Argentina,* Decision on Jurisdiction at para. 85; *Aguas del Tunari SA. v. Republic of Bolivia,* ICSID Case No. ARB/02/3, Decision on Respondent\u2019s Objections to Jurisdiction, 21 October 2005 (\" *Aguas del Tunari v. Bolivia,* Decision on Jurisdiction\"), at para. 118. This Tribunal is similarly situated to those in *Azurix* and *Aguas del Tunari.* because we would not give effect to an alleged waiver that is merely implied, we need not address the question whether we would have given effect to an express waiver.\n\n179.\n\nIn this regard, we agree with the tribunal in *Aguas del Tlunari v. Bolivia,* which considered the question of whether and under what circumstances a contractual forum selection clause could be held to work a waiver of the treaty right to invoke ICSID jurisdiction. The *Aguas del Tlunari* tribunal drew a distinction between \"(1) a separate document [i.e., a contract] that waives the right to invoke, or modifies the extent of, ICSID jurisdiction (where the intent of the parties to alter the possibility of ICSID jurisdiction is direct); and, (2) a separate document that contains an exclusive forum selection clause designating a forum other than ICSID (where the intent of the parties to alter the possibility of ICSID jurisdiction must be implied).\"109 As to the second circumstance\u2014the one that we also face in the present case\u2014 the *Aguas del Hunan* tribunal insisted that the mere designation of a non-ICSID forum in a contract, without an express waiver of ICSID jurisdiction, was insufficient to cause the tribunal to refrain from exercising its jurisdiction under the BIT:\n\nThe Tribunal does not find the authority under the ICSID Convention for it to abstain from exercising its jurisdiction simply because a conflicting forum selection clause exists. To the contrary, it is the Tribunal\u2019s view that an ICSID tribunal has a duty to exercise its jurisdiction in such instances absent any indication that the parties specifically intended that the conflicting clause act as a waiver or modification of an otherwise existing grant of jurisdiction to ICSID.\n\nA separate conflicting document should be held to affect the jurisdiction of an ICSID tribunal only if it clearly is intended to modify the jurisdiction otherwise granted to ICSID.110\n\n*Aguas del Tunari v. Bolivia,* Decision on Jurisdiction at para. 115.\n\n*Aguas del Tunari v. Bolivia,* Decision on Jurisdiction at para. 119. The claims in **Aguas del Tunari** did not include any claims under an umbrella clause, but there is nothing in the **Aguas del Tunari** tribunal\u2019s reasoning to suggest that its analysis would apply any differently to an alleged implied waiver of umbrella clause claims. The ***Woodruff*** case is not contrary to our analysis; the ***Woodruff*** commission emphasized that its dismissal turned on the claimant\u2019s express, written waiver: \"[A]s the claimant by his own voluntary waiver has disabled himself from invoking the jurisdiction of this Commission, the claim has to be dismissed without prejudice on its merits, when presented to the proper judges.\" ***Woodruff*** Case at p. 223.\n\n180.\n\nWe are in accord. In the instant case, there is no showing that the parties to the Contract clearly intended to exclude the jurisdiction of a tribunal formed under the Treaty to review SGS\u2019s Treaty claims. Paraguay, at least, must be deemed to have known the content of its own Treaty at the time its Ministry of Finance entered into the Contract; it either did not try, or did not obtain SGS\u2019s agreement, to clearly waive SGS\u2019s rights to seek separately arbitration of claims under the Treaty (necessarily including claims under Article 11 thereof). At least in the absence of an express waiver, a contractual forum selection clause should not be permitted to override the jurisdiction to hear Treaty claims of a tribunal constituted under that Treaty.\n\n181.\n\nWe are also in accord with Professor Crivellaro in his partial dissent in *SGS v. Philippines,* when he argued that posing the question as whether a BIT dispute settlement clause should override a contractual forum selection clause (or *vice versa,* presumably) creates a conflict where there need not be one. As Professor Crivellaro explained, both provisions \"survive and coexist\"\u2014both remain effective, with the only difference that the contract clause ceases to be an \"exclusive\" forum from the investor\u2019s perspective.111 As the *Bayindir v. Pakistan* tribunal expressed it: \"[W]hen the investor has a right under both the contract and the treaty, it has a self-standing right to pursue the remedy accorded by the treaty.\"112 That choice should not be foreclosed.\n\n*See* *SGS v. Philippines,* Decision on Jurisdiction, Declaration of Prof. Crivellaro at para. 4.\n\n*Bayindir v. Pakistan,* Decision on Jurisdiction at para. 167.\n\n182.\n\nFinally, certain other aspects of the Treaty counsel against letting the Contract\u2019s forum selection clause divest this Tribunal of its obligation to decide the Treaty claims over which it has jurisdiction (including claims under Article 11). Provisions of the Treaty other than Article 11, such as Article 9(1) and 9(6), contemplate that tribunals constituted under it will be deciding contractual matters; they too should not be rendered *inutile* by the dismissal on admissibility grounds of all such claims for breach of contract.\n\n183.\n\nAs previously noted, the BIT\u2019s dispute resolution provisions (Article 9) are not on their terms limited to claims for breach of the BIT itself. Article 9(1) arguably extends the Treaty dispute settlement process to all manner of \"disputes related to investments\"\u2014a category broad enough to encompass contract disputes. But deference to a contractual forum selection clause would significantly cut back Article 9\u2019s scope. It will be the rare State contract that has no dispute resolution clause of any kind. And faced with a contract containing such a clause, we would expect that the same reasoning that led the *BIVAC* tribunal to find contract-based umbrella clause claims inadmissible would presumably lead one also to dismiss any contract claims against a State that are advanced directly under an \"any dispute\"-style dispute resolution provision like Article 9. This approach would effectively negate Article 9\u2019s open-ended language, reducing it to a mechanism solely for resolving claims of Treaty breach. If that were the Treaty parties\u2019 intent, they presumably could have said so.113 Their choice of language giving a broader scope to the dispute resolution articles of the BIT should not be so readily disregarded.\n\nFor example, in two treaties signed prior to the Switzerland-Paraguay BIT, Switzerland limited investor-state dispute settlement to claims for breach of obligations under the respective treaty. The Switzerland-Turkey BIT (signed 3 March 1988) provides that, \"for purposes of this Article [investor-state dispute settlement], what is meant by dispute relating to an investment is a dispute in which is alleged the non-observance of rights and obligations created or conferred by this Agreement.\" Switzerland-Turkey BIT, Art. 8 (\"Aux fins du pr\u00e9sent article, on entend par diff\u00e9rend relatif \u00e0 un investissement, le diff\u00e9rend dans lequel est all\u00e9gu\u00e9 le non-respect de droits et obligations conf\u00e9r\u00e9s ou cr\u00e9\u00e9s par le pr\u00e9sent Accord.\") The Switzerland-Ghana BIT (signed 8 October 1991) provides for investor-state dispute settlement for disputes \"relating to an undertaking by the [host State] in the present Agreement.\" Switzerland-Ghana BIT, Art. 12 (\"diff\u00e9rends entre une Partie Contractante et un investisseur de l\u2019autre Partie Contractante relatifs \u00e0 un engagement pris par la premi\u00e8re dans le pr\u00e9sent Accord et concernant un investissement d\u2019un investisseur de l\u2019autre Partie Contractante sur le territoire de la premi\u00e8re\"). *See also* Switzerland-Mexico BIT, Schedule II, Art. 2(2) (investor may bring \"a claim based on the fact that the other Party has breached an obligation under this Agreement\"); Switzerland-Cuba BIT, Art. 10 (investor-state dispute settlement of disputes \"relatifs \u00e0 une obligation qui incombe \u00e0 cette derni\u00e8re en vertu du pr\u00e9sent Accord\"); Switzerland-South Africa BIT, Art. 10 (same). Paraguay likewise has entered into BITs whose investor-state dispute settlement provisions are limited to claims for treaty breach. *See* Paraguay-Venezuela BIT, Art. 9 (investor-state dispute resolution for a \"controversia entre un inversor de una Parte Contratante y la otra Parte Contratante respecto del cumplimiento del presente Convenio en relaci\u00f3n con una inversi\u00f3n de aquel\"), Paraguay-Spain BIT, Art. 11 (investor-state dispute resolution for a \"controversia relativa a las inversiones que surja entre una de las Partes Contratantes y un inversor de la otra Parte contratante respecto a cuestiones reguladas por el presente Acuerdo\").\n\n184.\n\nArticle 9(6) of the Treaty also contemplates that tribunals constituted under the Treaty will engage in the resolution of contract claims. That provision states the law to be applied by ICSID or UNCITRAL tribunals adjudicating disputes related to investments under Article 9:\n\nThe arbitral tribunal shall decide on the basis of the present Agreement [ *i.e.,* the BIT] and other relevant agreements between the Contracting Parties; of the terms of any particular agreement that may have been concluded with respect to the investment; of the law of the Contracting State party to the dispute, including its rules on the conflict of laws; of such principles and rules of international law as may be applicable.\n\nThe parties to the Switzerland-Paraguay BIT evidently had no qualms about the prospect that disputes under the Treaty would call for the application of \"the terms of any particular agreement that may have been concluded with respect to the investment\"\u2014such as the Contract at issue here. Yet a decision to exclude as inadmissible all contract-based umbrella clause claims under Article 11 and contract claims that are directly advanced under Article 9 (unless the contract lacks a forum selection clause altogether) eliminates a large swath of claims for which this clause of Article 9(6) is applicable. Given Article 9(6)\u2019s readiness to interpret and apply contracts to disputes, there is little reason to think that the State parties were expecting to see it so underutilized.\n\n185.\n\nFor all of the foregoing reasons, the Tribunal concludes not only that it has jurisdiction under Article 11 over Claimant\u2019s claims as stated, but also that those claims are admissible. The Tribunal will exercise its jurisdiction over them on the merits.\n\n**VI. COSTS**\n-------------\n\n186.\n\nEach Party requested that the Tribunal award them costs and fees, including ICSID fees and attorney\u2019s fees, in the event that they prevail. The Parties confirmed these requests at the hearing on jurisdiction.\n\n187.\n\nThe Tribunal takes note that Respondent has not complied with ICSID\u2019s 27 April 2009 and 24 August 2009 requests for payment of each Party\u2019s share of the advance on costs. Instead, Claimant has paid the entirety of the requested advance on costs (including Respondent\u2019s share).\n\n188.\n\nHowever, the Tribunal has decided to reserve its determination on costs until the conclusion of the proceedings, consistent with Article 61 of the ICSID Convention and Rule 28 of the Arbitration Rules.\n\n**VII. DECISION**\n-----------------\n\n189.\n\nFor the reasons set out above, the Tribunal decides as follows\n\n\u2022 The Tribunal has jurisdiction to decide Claimant\u2019s claims under Articles 4(1), 4(2) and 11 of the Treaty. Respondent\u2019s objections to jurisdiction are dismissed,\n\n\u2022 The Tribunal\u2019s determination on the Parties\u2019 costs is reserved until the conclusion of the proceedings.\n\n190.\n\nThe Parties are instructed to confer and seek to reach agreement on a schedule for the merits proceedings, and to report to the Tribunal thereon within 30 days following the issuance of this Decision."}, {"Title": "Award", "Type": "Award (Final)", "Date": "2012-02-10T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Award\n-----\n\n**I. PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND**\n----------------------------\n\n**A. Initiation of the Arbitration**\n------------------------------------\n\n1.\n\nOn 19 October 2007, the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (\"ICSID\" or the \"Centre\") received a request for arbitration dated 16 October 2007 (the \"Request\") from SGS Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale de Surveillance S.A. (\"SGS\" or \"Claimant\") against the Republic of Paraguay (\"Paraguay\" or \"Respondent\") (collectively, the \"parties\"). The Request was made under the Agreement on the Promotion and Reciprocal Protection of Investments between Switzerland and Paraguay signed 31 January 1992 and entered into force 28 September 1992 (the \"BIT\" or the \"Treaty\"), and the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States (\"ICSID Convention\" or \"Convention\").\n\n2.\n\nOn 19 November 2007, the Deputy Secretary-General of ICSID sent Claimant and Respondent a Notice of Registration in accordance with Article 36(3) of the ICSID Convention.\n\n3.\n\nOn 30 January 2008, Claimant requested, in accordance with Rule 2(3) of the ICSID Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings (\"Arbitration Rules\"), that the Arbitral Tribunal be constituted in accordance with the provisions of Article 37(2)(b) of the Convention. This letter was acknowledged by a letter from ICSID to the parties of the same date. It was accordingly confirmed that: (1) the Tribunal would consist of three arbitrators; (2) one arbitrator would be appointed by each party and the third, the president of the Tribunal, would be appointed by agreement of the parties; and (3) the appointments would follow the procedures set out in Rule 3 of the Arbitration Rules.\n\n4.\n\nBy letter dated 31 January 2008, Claimant appointed Mr. Donald Francis Donovan, Esq., a national of the United States of America, as a member of the Tribunal. On 31 March 2008, Respondent appointed Dr. Pablo Garcia Mexia, a national of Spain. No objections were raised to either appointment.\n\n5.\n\nOn 20 February 2008, the parties having failed to reach agreement on the appointment of the President of the Tribunal, Claimant requested the appointment of the presiding arbitrator by the Chairman of the ICSID Administrative Council as provided for in Article 38 of the Convention and Rule 4(1) of the Arbitration Rules.\n\n6.\n\nBy letter of 20 May 2008, the Chairman of the ICSID Administrative Council appointed Dr. Stanimir A. Alexandrov, a national of Bulgaria, as the third arbitrator and president of the Tribunal. No objections were raised to this appointment.\n\n7.\n\nThe Tribunal was officially constituted on 27 May 2008, in accordance with the Convention and ICSID Arbitration Rules. Mr. Gonzalo Flores, Senior Counsel, ICSID, was initially designated to serve as the Secretary of the Tribunal. On 16 April 2009, the Acting Secretary-General informed the Tribunal that due to the redistribution of the Centre\u2019s workload, Dr. Sergio Puig de la Parra, ICSID, would serve as the new Secretary of the Tribunal. On November 5, 2010, the Secretary-General informed the Tribunal that Dr. Puig would be replaced by Mrs. Mercedes Cordido-Freytes de Kurowski.\n\n**B. Objections of Respondent to Jurisdiction**\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n8.\n\nOn 8 April 2008, Respondent submitted a Memorial with Objections to Jurisdiction to the Centre.

The Contract**\n-------------------\n\n26.\n\nIn 1995, the Ministry of Finance of Paraguay invited five companies - SGS; Bureau Veritas, Inspection, Valuation, Assessment and Control, BIVAC B.V. (\"BIVAC\"); Cotecna Inspection S.A.; Inchcape Testing Services Ltd.; and Inspectorate Worldwide Services - to submit their bids to provide \"pre-shipment\" inspection services, i.e., services involving the inspection of imported goods prior to shipment to ensure the accurate collection of import information and facilitate collection of customs duties. SGS and BIVAC were selected. On 6 May 1996, the Ministry of Finance and SGS signed an Agreement on the Rendering of Technical Services for Import Pre-Shipment Inspection (the \"Contract\").2 The Contract was to remain in effect for three years, starting on 15 July 1996.\n\nContract, Ex. C-4.\n\n27.\n\nUnder the heading \"NATURE AND SUBJECT-MATTER OF THE AGREEMENT,\" the Contract states that the pre-shipment inspection program was designed \"with the purpose of optimizing the tax collection volume and to improve the mechanisms for controlling the compliance with the tax obligations referred to [sic] the import transactions... \"3\n\nContract, Ex. C-4.\n\n28.\n\nIn broad terms, the Contract required SGS to provide three categories of \"technical services\":\n\n29.\n\nUnder Articles 2.1 through 2.8 of the Contract, SGS was to provide pre-shipment inspection and related services, which would include the issuance of Inspection Certificates or Discrepancy Reports, as discussed below.\n\n30.\n\nUnder Article 2.9 of the Contract, SGS was to provide training to Paraguayan Customs officials that would \"include... the techniques used by SGS personnel, the technical, administrative and organizational procedures, with the purpose of reaching an efficient and effective execution and protection of tax revenues and to make up a body of officials specialized in customs valuation.\"\n\n31.\n\nUnder Article 2.10 of the Contract, SGS was to help create a Customs database for organizing the information in the Inspection Certificates and train Paraguayan officials to use the database.\n\n32.\n\nThe process for conducting pre-shipment inspections took place in several stages. Importers would submit requests to an SGS liaison office in Paraguay to inspect designated shipments. SGS established a liaison office in Asunci\u00f3n, as well as two smaller offices in Ciudad del Este and Encamaci\u00f3n, to assist in its performance under the Contract. If SGS determined that an inspection was necessary, it would, pursuant to Article 2.1 of the Contract, \"carry out the physical inspection of goods prior to shipment, in the country of origin, in order to determine if the goods submitted to inspection correspond to what the importer has declared to SGS.\" In certain instances, SGS informed an importer that an inspection was not necessary.4 Pursuant to Article 2.2 of the Contract, if SGS determined that an inspection was necessary, it would \"verify the price invoiced by the seller and... establish whether this is within the reasonable limits, for the export price levels, prevailing in such market or in the international market.\" In accordance with Articles 2.3 and 2.4 of the Contract, SGS would provide Customs with its opinion on the appropriate customs value and tariff classification of the shipment, and, under Article 2.6, verify the country of origin.\n\nDay 1 Tr. (Merits) at pp. 163-164.\n\n33.\n\nAfter the inspection, pursuant to Article 2.8 of the Contract, SGS would provide Customs with a copy of either an Inspection Certificate or, if SGS disagreed with the importer\u2019s shipment documentation, a Discrepancy Report. Under Article 5.2 of the Contract, SGS would also provide Customs with a monthly report that would include, among other things, the details of the inspections conducted during the month.\n\n34.\n\nUnder Article 4 of the Contract, for each inspection, Paraguay agreed to pay SGS the larger of (a) a fee equal to 1.3% of the FOB value of the goods shown in the Inspection Certificate or the Discrepancy Report or (b) US$ 280. SGS would send the Ministry a monthly invoice denominated in U.S. dollars, and the invoices were to be paid within 20 days after receipt. Under Article 4.5 of the Contract, if the Ministry of Finance disputed an invoice, the Ministry was required to pay any undisputed amounts. According to Article 5.6 of the Contract, SGS was not to be \"liable for any claim not filed within twelve (12) months upon the issuance date of the Inspection Certificate.\"\n\n35.\n\nPursuant to Article 5.4 of the Contract, SGS posted a US$ 250,000 performance bond.\n\n36.\n\nArticle 9 of the Contract contained a forum selection clause that stated that \"[a]ny conflict, controversy or claim deriving from or in connection with this Agreement, breach, termination or invalidity, shall be submitted to the Courts of the City of Asunci\u00f3n under the Law of Paraguay.\"\n\n37.\n\nThe Contract contained several mechanisms for termination. Under Article 7.1 of the Contract, either party could terminate the Contract for non-compliance by the other party. Under Article 7.2, the Ministry of Finance could, with 120 days\u2019 notice, unilaterally terminate the Contract on grounds of \"opportunity, merit or convenience.\" Finally, under Article 8.2, the Contract would terminate if, at least four months before the Contract was to expire, either party notified the other party that it did not intend to renew the Contract.\n\n38.\n\nIn addition to the Contract, Paraguay issued several regulations governing the provision of services. These included Resolution 1171 of 3 July 1996 (\"Resolution 1171\") that, among other things, required inspections for small shipments valued at less than US$ 3,000 when such shipments were part of a larger order or a consolidated bill of lading that exceeded US$3,000. In addition, Resolution 1579 of 10 September 1996 (\"Resolution 1579\") exempted certain shipments from pre-shipment inspection, including \"[a]quellas importaciones liberadas y las exoneradas de los tributos aduaneros e internos, contenidas en las disposiciones de car\u00e1cter general o en Leyes Especiales.\"5\n\nRespondent translates this provision as exempting from inspection \"any and all tax free imports free and clear of those duties or internal taxes, as described in general or special laws.\" Respondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial at para. 24. The translation in Claimant\u2019s Ex. C-76 is slightly different: \"Those imports released and those exempted from customs duties and internal taxes contained in the general provisions or Special Laws.\"\n\n**B. Unpaid Invoices**\n----------------------\n\n39.\n\nThe Contract commenced in July 1996. As discussed in detail below, the parties decided by mutual agreement not to renew the Contract at the end of its initial three-year term, and the Contract was terminated in June 1999. During the term of the Contract, SGS conducted approximately 100,000 inspections and issued 35 monthly invoices.6 The Ministry of Finance paid only 10 of those invoices.7 Twenty-five of SGS\u2019s 35 invoices were not paid, totaling (in principal, not including interest) US$ 39,025,950.86.8 These facts are not in dispute.\n\nLironi Statement at para. 17.\n\nLironi Statement at para. 17.\n\nLironi Statement at para. 18.\n\n**C. Discussions Regarding Respondent\u2019s Failure to Pay Invoices During the Term of the Contract**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n40.\n\nBetween July 1996 and the time when the Contract was terminated in June 1999, officials from SGS and the Government of Paraguay engaged in an ongoing dialogue regarding the unpaid invoices and the terms of the Contract.\n\n41.\n\nParaguay paid the invoices covering the period July-November 1996. The December 1996 invoice was paid several months late9 and the Paraguayan Congress failed to allocate funds to pay Claimant\u2019s invoices for 1997.10 According to Mr. Musalem, the Minister of Finance told SGS in March 1997 that the failure to allocate funds for 1997 was an oversight and that \"a provision would be made for the payment of the invoices in the budget of the following year.\"11\n\nLironi Statement, Annex B.\n\nFirst Musalem Statement at para. 35; Ex. C-84.\n\nFirst Musalem Statement at para. 3 5.\n\n42.\n\nIn an exchange of letters with the Ministry of Finance in March and April 1997, SGS offered to modify the payment terms of the Contract, and the Ministry of Finance offered to pay SGS at least in part for services performed in 1997.12 The Ministry of Finance also indicated in its letter that it \"would propose a budget increase to the National Parliament\" so that the payments might be increased later in 1997 and that, \"starting in January 1998, the payments would be made normally and regularly since we would be including these expenses in the 1998 budget.\"13\n\nClaimant\u2019s Memorial at 57-58, *citing* Exs.

C-83.\n\n43.\n\nSGS eventually accepted a repayment plan proposed by Paraguay. It also agreed to reduce the minimum fee to US$ 200 per inspection and agreed to two changes with respect to inspections of oil products.14 First, SGS agreed to reduce retroactively the *ad valorem* fee on oil products from 1.3% to 0.8% of the FOB value for the period January-August 1997. SGS credited the Ministry for the difference.15 Second, SGS agreed to stop inspections of oil products altogether as of 1 September 1997.16\n\nLetter from SGS and BIVAC to Customs dated 7 October 1997, Ex.

In July 1998, the Ministry sent a letter to SGS in which it \"acknowledge[d] receipt of [SGS\u2019s invoices]\" that \"pertain[ed] to the preshipment inspection services rendered to the government of the Republic of Paraguay,\" totaling, at that time, approximately US$ 24 million, and stated that \"[t]his sum represents the outstanding debt payable by the Paraguayan State in favor of SGS.\"17 The letter also stated as follows:\n\nThis Ministry wishes to comply with the payment for the services rendered in 1998 pursuant to the contractual provisions and with respect to the debt accrued in 1997, we inform you that this Ministry is reviewing and analyzing the possibilities and legal mechanisms that would permit the regularization of this debt to our mutual satisfaction.18\n\nLetter No. 663 from Minister of Finance to SGS Liaison Office General Manager dated 28 July 1998, Ex.

On 27 January 1999, SGS told the Ministry of Finance that it would be authorized to terminate the Contract within 15 business days if Paraguay did not make a good faith partial payment of US$ 5,000,000.26 The Ministry responded by a letter dated 29 January 1999, in which it stated that the delays in payment were due to \"the mismanagement of the year 1998 Budget carried out by the previous Government, as it was publicly and timely denounced by this Administration and many of these commitments were not even accounted for, with the logical difficulty involved.\" The letter went on to state that the \"current Administration will soon start to make [disbursements in order to meet the obligations that have been assumed and fulfilled in accordance with the legal rules in force.\"27\n\nClaimant\u2019s Memorial at para. 77; Letter from SGS Senior Executive Vice President to Minister of Finance dated 27 January 1999, Ex.

According to Mr. Musalem, \"[d]uring this meeting, the President also called the newly appointed Minister of Finance and instructed him to grant [SGS] a meeting in order to reach an agreement to put an end to [SGS\u2019s] claim.\"31 According to Mr. Musalem, a few days later \"the Minister [of Finance] reiterated the Government\u2019s commitment to pay SGS... \"32 In April, SGS wrote a letter to the Minister of Finance explaining that it would postpone terminating the Contract and expressing the hope that it would be paid.33 SGS also referred to the possibility of entering into a new agreement with the Ministry.\n\nFirst Musalem Statement at para. 46.\n\nFirst Musalem Statement at para. 47.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Memorial at para. 92; Letter from SGS to Ministry of Finance dated 6 April 1999, Ex.

The **2000 budget,** for which I was able to consult the entry \"Other Fees,\" does not provide for any payment to SGS or Bivac. Still according to [Rub\u00e9n Dario Maciel], parliament supposedly prohibited other payments from being recorded in this category without its approval, hence the need for the treasury department to submit an ad hoc legislative bill to parliament, which has not been done.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Memorial at para. 107; Newspaper clipping titled \"Switzerland Demands Paraguay Payment of US$ 30 Million Debt\" dated 26 November 1999, Ex.

However, it also stated (in para. 5) that \"the Comptroller General of Paraguay is verifying the services provided by the contracting companies in order to determine whether the works performed comply with the contract and the principles and rules governing this type of business transactions\" and (in para. 7) that \"the Paraguayan State cannot pay outstanding debts until the Comptroller General\u2019s Special Examination is concluded.\" The opinion recommended (in para. 10.2) that \"[t]he Ministry of Finance shall take action to request the budget items for the payment of the debts owed to SGS and BIVAC INTERNACIONAL, in accordance with the final settlement to be made based on the special examination performed by the Comptroller General of Paraguay.\"49\n\nOpinion No. 139 issued by Legal Counsel for the Counsel of the Treasury, Ministry of Finance dated 12 February 2001, Ex.

However, she ordered that the information she had collected be sent to the Attorney General for \"investigation into acts of tax evasion.\"56 According to Claimant, the inquiry was dismissed on 16 December 2002.57\n\nClaimant\u2019s Memorial at para. 126; Letter from Prosecutor Delvalle to Under-Ministry of Taxation of the Ministry of Finance dated 18 January 2002, Ex.

C-136.\n\n61.\n\nIn May 2005, the Ministry of Finance launched an investigation of SGS\u2019s and BIVAC\u2019s performance, and, based on an exchange of letters between the parties, it appears that a special committee was continuing to investigate the matter as late as the second half of 2006.63\n\nClaimant\u2019s Memorial at paras. 138, 143; Newspaper clipping titled \"Ministry of Finance Announces Investigation of Debts to SGS and BIVAC\" dated 7 May 2005, Ex.

In June 2005, SGS wrote to the Ministry of Finance requesting a proposed payment plan.64 In August 2005, the Comptroller General issued a report noting that the Ministry of Finance did not include the debt to SGS in the Ministry\u2019s balance sheet for the 2004 fiscal period.65 In 2006-2007, SGS wrote a number of letters to the Ministry of Finance, proposing settlement terms and requesting new negotiations.66 A letter from SGS from April 2007 recounts a meeting with the Minister of Finance on 18 December 2006 in which the Minister expressed an interest in SGS\u2019s proposal to negotiate a monthly payment plan.67 An SGS letter dated 24 May 2007 recounts a meeting with the Minister of Finance on 10 May 2007 in which the Minister offered to set up a meeting with the President to present the debt situation and make proposals to finalize an agreement.68 In addition to the referenced letters, and after the Contract's termination in June 1999, SGS sent interest invoices to the Ministry of Finance between April 2000 and March 2006.69\n\nLetter from SGS Legal Counsel to Minister of Finance dated 8 June 2005, Ex.

Decree 10485 stated, \"In order to safeguard the proprietary interests of the Government, it is first necessary to verify that the services were actually performed in order to determine the material and legal existence of the alleged credit claimed, with the pertinent clarification that the administrative measure does not signify recognition, confirmation or acceptance of the claims of the affected companies and/or cause disruptions or suspensions in statutory periods.\"70\n\nDecree No. 10485 dated 22 June 2007, Ex. C-141.\n\n64.\n\nClaimant initiated this arbitration in October 2007.\n\n**D. Uncontested Nature of the Facts**\n--------------------------------------\n\n65.\n\nThe general sequence of events described above and contemporaneous written documentation are not in dispute. Respondent questions the recollection of Mr. Musalem, as his written and oral testimony was prepared several years after the events in question took place. Respondent also asserts that at no point did Paraguay make an unequivocal promise to pay and that much of the discussion between the parties is protected by settlement privilege. The Tribunal will address the relevance of these matters in due course. However, apart from these points, neither party contests the occurrence of the events as described.\n\n**III. MERITS OF CLAIMS**\n-------------------------\n\n66.\n\nClaimant alleges that Respondent breached its obligations under Article 11 of the BIT to observe commitments it entered into with SGS. Claimant also alleges that Respondent impaired Claimant\u2019s investment by undue and discriminatory measures in violation of Article 4(1) of the BIT and denied Claimant fair and equitable treatment in violation of Article 4(2) of the BIT.\n\n67.\n\nFor the reasons explained below, the Tribunal concludes that Respondent breached its obligations under Article 11 of the BIT. Therefore, it need not address Claimant\u2019s claims under Article 4(1) and 4(2) of the BIT, as they arise out of identical facts and would not, even if the Tribunal were to find a violation, result in increasing the damages owed to Claimant. The Tribunal shall return to this matter after its discussion of the claims under Article 11.\n\n**A. Assessment of Claims Under Article 11 of the BIT**\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n68.\n\nArticle 11 of the BIT, the so-called \"umbrella clause,\" states that \"[e]ither Contracting Party shall constantly guarantee the observance of the commitments it has entered into with respect to the investments of the other investors of the Contracting Party.\"\n\n69.\n\nClaimant makes two related but independent claims under Article 11. First, Claimant asserts that Respondent breached the Contract by failing to meet its payment obligations, and such breach in itself amounts to a breach of Article 11. Second, Claimant asserts that Respondent made - and broke - additional promises to pay SGS\u2019s invoices through various oral and written representations during and after the term of the Contract. Claimant asserts that these additional representations are enforceable commitments under Article 11.\n\n70.\n\nRespondent raises several objections to Claimant\u2019s claims under Article 11, each of which will be addressed below. However, prior to doing so, and given the overlap between Respondent\u2019s defenses on the merits and the arguments it raised during the jurisdictional stage of the proceedings, the Tribunal shall begin its examination of Claimant\u2019s Article 11 claims with a summary of its relevant findings from the Decision on Jurisdiction. The Tribunal will then refer to these findings in its analysis of the specific arguments Claimant and Respondent presented during the merits phase.\n\n**1. Tribunal\u2019s Decision on Jurisdiction**\n------------------------------------------\n\n71.\n\nIn its Decision on Jurisdiction, the Tribunal made three findings with respect to Claimant\u2019s claims under Article 11: (a) the Tribunal had jurisdiction over the claims; (b) having taken jurisdiction over the claims, the Tribunal was required to decide them notwithstanding the existence of the forum selection clause in the Contract; and (c) the claims were admissible. We will not repeat the reasoning behind each of these findings, as the Decision on Jurisdiction is incorporated in full here. However, in the course of its analysis, the Tribunal reached several conclusions that are directly relevant to its assessment of the merits of the claims and that bear repeating.\n\n72.\n\nFirst, the Tribunal rejected Respondent\u2019s argument that a mere breach of contract cannot rise to the level of a breach of Article 11 unless it is coupled with additional \"sovereign\" action. The Tribunal concluded (at para. 167) that, \"even as to the Article 11 claims that are predicated directly on Paraguay\u2019s alleged breach of the Contract, we have no hesitation in treating the Contract\u2019s obligations as \u2018commitments\u2019 within the meaning of Article 11.\" The Tribunal explained as follows (at para. 168):\n\nGiven the unqualified text of Article 11 of the Treaty, and its ordinary meaning, we see no basis to import into Article 11 the non-textual limitations that Respondent proposed in its Reply. Article 11 does not exclude commercial contracts of the State from its scope. Likewise, Article 11 does not state that its constant guarantee of observance of such commitments may be breached only through actions that a commercial counterparty cannot take, through abuses of state power, or through exertions of undue government influence.... In effect, we see no basis on the face of the clause to believe that it should mean anything other than what it says\u2014that the State is obliged to guarantee the observance of its commitments with respect to the investments of the other State party\u2019s investors. (Citations omitted).\n\n73.\n\nThe Tribunal also concluded that, even if it were necessary to show an abuse of sovereign authority in order to prove an Article 11 claim, a breach of contract by Paraguay could very well constitute a sovereign act. As stated in the Decision on Jurisdiction (at para. 135), \"Logically, one can characterize every act by a sovereign State as a \u2018sovereign act\u2019\u2014including the State\u2019s acts to breach or terminate contracts to which the State is a party. It is thus difficult to articulate a basis on which the State\u2019s actions, solely because they occur in the context of a contract or a commercial transaction, are somehow no longer acts of the State, for which the State may be held internationally responsible.\"\n\n74.\n\nThe consequence of the Tribunal\u2019s holding is that Claimant can prove an Article 11 claim if it can prove that Paraguay failed to observe its commitments under the Contract, regardless of whether Paraguayan officials subsequently acknowledged the debt to Claimant through additional written or verbal assurances of payment, or took some other form of \"sovereign action\" such as amending a law or regulation in a manner that prevented payment of SGS\u2019s invoices.\n\n75.\n\nSecond, the Tribunal (at paras. 173-185) rejected Respondent\u2019s argument that the forum selection clause in the Contract deprived the Tribunal of jurisdiction to hear Claimant\u2019s Article 11 claims or rendered such claims inadmissible to the extent such claims were premised on a theory that Respondent breached the Contract. The Tribunal found that, having already decided that it had jurisdiction over the claims, it was compelled to decide them. The Tribunal concluded (at para. 172) that \"a decision to decline to hear SGS\u2019s claims under Article 11 on the grounds that they should instead be directed to the courts of Asuncion would place the Tribunal at risk of failing to carry out its mandate under the Treaty and the ICSID Convention.\"\n\n76.\n\nThird, the Tribunal concluded that its finding that it had jurisdiction over claims for Paraguay\u2019s alleged failure to observe its contractual commitments under Article 11 is consistent with the Parties\u2019 intent when negotiating the BIT. The Tribunal stated (at para. 176), \"[t]he State parties to the BIT intended to provide this Treaty protection in addition to whatever rights the investor could negotiate for itself in a contract or could find under domestic law, and they gave the investor the option to enforce it, including through arbitrations such as this one\" (citations omitted).\n\n77.\n\nNone of the above findings excluded the possibility that any additional statements or alleged promises to pay made by Paraguayan officials might in themselves constitute binding commitments under Article 11 of the BIT. Indeed, the Tribunal concluded (at para. 167) that Article 11 \"creates an obligation for the State to constantly guarantee observance of its commitments entered into with respect to investments of investors of the other Party. The obligation has no limitations on its face\u2014it apparently applies to all such commitments, whether established by contract or by law, unilaterally or bilaterally, etc.\" Oral and written representations outside the Contract could, therefore, be enforceable under Article 11 in certain circumstances. However, the Tribunal clearly found in its Decision on Jurisdiction that it was not necessary to prove the binding nature - or even the relevance - of such statements outside the Contract in order to prove a claim that a party\u2019s failure to meet its contractual commitments itself violated Article 11.\n\n78.\n\nWith this background, the Tribunal will now turn to the parties\u2019 arguments presented during the merits phase of the proceeding.\n\n**2. Whether Respondent Has Failed to Guarantee the Observance of Its Contractual Commitments**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**a. Claimant Has Met Its Initial Burden of Proof That Respondent Has Failed to Guarantee the Observance of Its Contractual Commitments**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n79.\n\nAs stated in *Soufraki v. United Arab Emirates,* \"In accordance with accepted international (and general national) practice, a party bears the burden of proof in establishing the facts that he asserts.\"71 Consequently, Claimant bears the initial burden of proof in substantiating its claims, and Respondent bears the burden of proving its defenses. Claimant thus bears the burden of proving that Respondent\u2019s failure to pay SGS\u2019s invoices breached Respondent\u2019s contractual commitments and, therefore, Article 11 of the BIT. Respondent bears the burden of proving its defenses by showing, for example, that Respondent\u2019s failure to pay the invoices is justified by Claimant\u2019s own breaches of its contractual obligations or is otherwise excused.\n\n*Hussein Nuaman Soufraki v. United Arab Emirates,* ICSID Case No. ARB/02/7, Award, 7 July 2004, para. 58. See also *Middle East Cement Shipping and Handling Co. S.A. v. Arab Republic of Egypt,* ICSID Case No. ARB/99/6, Award, 12 April 2002, para. 90; *Alpha Projektholding GMBH v. Ukraine,* ICSID Case No. ARB/07/16, Award, 8 November 2010, para. 236; *Asian Agricultural Products Ltd. (AAPL) v. Republic of Sri Lanka,* ICSID Case No. ARB/87/3, Final Award, 27 June 1990, para 56.\n\n80.\n\nOn the facts before us, it is clear that Claimant has met its initial burden of proof. It is not disputed that Paraguay has failed to pay 25 invoices to SGS, totaling in principal US$ 39,025,950.86. It is also undisputed that such invoices were issued pursuant to the Contract, and failure to pay properly issued invoices constitutes a breach of Paraguay\u2019s contractual commitments. Furthermore, as the Tribunal has already found, a Party\u2019s failure to observe its contractual commitments may in itself constitute a breach of Article 11 of the BIT. Therefore, Claimant has met its initial burden of proof that Paraguay has failed to observe its contractual commitments and has shifted the burden onto Respondent to prove its defenses that the non-payment was justifiable.\n\n**b. Respondent\u2019s Defenses**\n----------------------------\n\n81.\n\nRespondent makes three principal arguments in its defense: (i) the alleged breach of its contractual commitments was \"committed by Paraguay (if at all) as a normal market player and did not involve abuse of its sovereign powers\"; (ii) in any event, the forum selection clause in the Contract precludes a finding of liability; and (iii) Claimant itself breached the Contract, and such breach relieves Respondent of its contractual obligations. The Tribunal shall examine each of these defenses in turn.\n\n**(i) Respondent\u2019s Argument That Paraguay Did Not Abuse Its Sovereign Powers**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**(a) Respondent\u2019s Position**\n-----------------------------\n\n82.\n\nRespondent asserts that a breach of contract by a State may only violate an umbrella clause in a BIT if the government action in question constituted an abuse of sovereign authority. According to Respondent, \"SGS must establish that Paraguay abused its government power,\" and mere non-payment of invoices is not sufficient to establish a breach of Article 11.72 Even assuming Respondent breached its contractual commitments, Respondent argues, Paraguay\u2019s actions \"are of the kind that can and often do occur in private commercial transactions, and without more, they cannot be characterized as instances of \u2018abuse of government power.\u2019\" \"After all,\" Respondent argues, \"mere non-payment of sums allegedly due under a contract is an act that any private party could engage in.\"73\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial at para. 78.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial at para. 87.\n\n83.\n\nRespondent recognizes that the Tribunal has already concluded in its Decision on Jurisdiction that a mere breach of contract could in itself violate Article 11 without being coupled with an abuse of sovereign authority. However, Respondent argues that the Tribunal mischaracterized its argument in the Decision on Jurisdiction. To ensure that there is no confusion on the matter, the Tribunal shall quote Respondent\u2019s clarification of its position:74\n\nParaguay does not sustain that every breach of contract by the State will automatically be insulated from international liability. Some contractual breaches may in certain circumstances not present here may [sic] derive from an abuse of government power, and as a result may be actionable under a fair and equitable treatment standard or even an umbrella clause. However, other contractual breaches, such as simple breaches of payment obligations do not entail abuse of government power, and as a result are not protected by the umbrella clause.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial at para. 79.\n\n84.\n\nIn support of its position, Respondent cites a string of cases including *Siemens v. Argentina, Bayindir v. Pakistan, RFCC v. Morocco, Waste Management v. Mexico, Impregilo v. Pakistan* and *Duke v. Ecuador75* for the proposition that a government\u2019s breach of contract can only rise to the level of a breach of the BIT if it involved an abuse of sovereign authority.\n\n*Siemens A.G. v. Argentine Republic,* ICSID Case No. ARB/02/8, Award, 6 February 2007, para. 253; *Bayindir Insaat Turizm Ticaret Ve Sayani A.S. v. Islamic Republic of Pakistan,* ICSID Case No. ARB/03/29, Award, 27 August 2009, para. 179; *Consortium R.F.C.C. v. Kingdom of Morocco,* ICSID Case No. ARB/00/6, Award, 22 December 2003, paras. 51, 100; *Waste Management Inc. v. United Mexican States,* ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/00/3, Award, 30 April 2004, para. 115; *Impregilo S.p.A. v. Islamic Republic of Pakistan,* ICSID Case No. ARB/03/3, Decision on Jurisdiction, 22 April 2005, paras. 259-62; *Duke Energy Electroquil Partners v. Republic of Ecuador,* ICSID Case No. ARB/04/19, Award, 18 August 2008, para. 340.\n\n85.\n\nRespondent also urges the Tribunal not to construe Article 11 in broader terms than the Swiss Government has construed a similar provision in the Swiss-Pakistan BIT.76 In addition, Respondent argues that the Tribunal should conclude, like the *SGS v. Pakistan* tribunal, that the umbrella clause does not extend to breach of contract claims.77\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial at para. 92.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial at para. 93 and n. 94.\n\n86.\n\nRespondent argues that Claimant has not proven that Paraguay abused its sovereign authority, and, therefore, has not proven that Respondent breached Article 11 of the BIT.\n\nWhile Claimant pointed to several acts and statements by Paraguayan government authorities as \"sovereign\" acts that blocked payment to SGS, Respondent argues that such acts were not sufficient to prove Claimant\u2019s claim. According to Respondent:78\n\nParaguay\u2019s supposedly obstreperous post-breach conduct makes it no different.... Like Paraguay here, any commercial party could have multiple changes in leadership in a short period of time, conduct more than one internal inquiry into its rights and obligations under a contract and object at various times and in different ways to aspects of the counterparty\u2019s performance. And, like a private commercial party would do, the government of Paraguay made itself subject to the jurisdiction of its judicial system for the resolution of disputes over its conduct.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial at para. 87.\n\n**(b) Claimant\u2019s Position**\n---------------------------\n\n87.\n\nClaimant notes that the Tribunal has already decided in the Decision on Jurisdiction that a breach of contract could violate Article 11 even if there was no abuse of sovereign authority. Claimant argues that the decisions that Respondent cites in favor of its position either did not require the exercise of sovereign power in order to establish a breach of an international obligation or, with respect to the sections of the awards upon which Respondent relies, did not deal with a claim under an umbrella clause. In fact, Claimant contends, the *Siemens* tribunal actually adopted an approach similar to that taken in the Decision on Jurisdiction79\n\nClaimant\u2019s Reply at para. 80.\n\n88.\n\nClaimant furthermore argues that, even if it must prove an abuse of sovereign authority in order to prove an Article 11 claim, \"in the years that followed the termination of the Contract, Paraguay commissioned investigations and inquiries into the Contract and the debt to SGS, with the effect of stalling payment.\"80 In Claimant\u2019s view, these acts constitute the type of sovereign acts that Respondent claims are necessary prerequisites to an Article 11 claim. According to Claimant, these are not the acts of a private party. In Claimant\u2019s view, \"A private corporation cannot cloak its acts with the mantle of governmental authority. Nor can a private corporation invoke at will the machinery of the criminal justice system. Nor would SGS have seen parties distinct from its contractual counter-party, such as the Prosecutor General and the Comptroller General, inject themselves into the performance of the Contract, had it been dealing with a private corporation.\"81\n\nClaimant\u2019s Reply at para. 66.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Reply at para. 69.\n\n**(c) Tribunal\u2019s Analysis**\n---------------------------\n\n89.\n\nThe Tribunal does not accept Respondent\u2019s argument that an abuse of sovereign authority is necessary to prove a violation of Article 11. Indeed, despite Respondent\u2019s protestations to the contrary, there is no meaningful distinction between the argument Respondent has raised in the merits phase and the argument that Respondent raised - and the Tribunal rejected - during the jurisdictional phase of the proceeding.\n\n90.\n\nArticle 11 of the BIT states, \"Either Contracting Party shall constantly guarantee the observance of the commitments it has entered into with respect to the investments of the investors of the other Contracting Party.\" As a matter of the ordinary meaning of the term, a contractual obligation is the prototypical legally binding \"commitment.\" Hence, applying standard principles of treaty interpretation,82 a contractual obligation is a \"commitment\" within the meaning of Article 11.\n\nArticle 31(1) of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties states that, \"[a] treaty shall be interpreted in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in the light of its object and purpose.\"\n\n91.\n\nArticle 11 requires the \"observance\" of commitments. Also as a matter of the ordinary meaning of the term, a failure to meet one\u2019s obligations under a contract is clearly a failure to \"observe\" one\u2019s commitments. There is nothing in Article 11 that states or implies that a government will only fail to observe its commitments if it abuses its sovereign authority. Hence, again applying standard principles of treaty interpretation, a breach of contract by Paraguay with respect to an investment of a Swiss investor is a breach of Article 11.\n\n92.\n\nMost of the decisions that Respondent cites in support of its position are inapposite, in that they do not stand for the proposition that an abuse of sovereign authority is necessary in order to establish a breach of an umbrella clause. The section of *Bayindir* (at para. 180) upon which Respondent relies dealt with a fair and equitable treatment claim. The same is true with respect to Respondent\u2019s citation to the *RFCC* (at paras. 51, 100), *Waste Management* (at para. 115), and *Duke* (at paras. 332-345) awards. *Impregilo* (at paras. 259-285) dealt with claims for breach of the fair and equitable treatment standard, imposition of unfair and discriminatory measures, and expropriation without compensation.\n\n93.\n\nRespondent cites *SGS v. Pakistan* for the proposition that the \"commitment\" protected by an umbrella clause does not include mere contracts.83 However, as the Tribunal already decided in the Decision on Jurisdiction, Article 11 of the BIT provides no basis for excluding contracts from the scope of \"commitments\" covered in the article. As stated in the Decision on Jurisdiction (at para. 169), on this point it is \"parting ways with the decision in *SGS v. Pakistan..*..\" Similarly, the Tribunal disagrees with the *Siemens* award to the extent that it concluded that an abuse of sovereign power was necessary to establish a breach of an umbrella clause. In so doing, the Tribunal follows the reasoning of other ICSID tribunals that have concluded that the umbrella clause may apply whether or not the exercise of sovereign power is involved.84\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial at para. 93.\n\n*See, e.g.,* *Burlington Resources Inc. and others v. Republic of Ecuador and Empresa Estatal Petr\u00f3leos del Ecuador (PetroEcuador),* ICSID Case No. ARB/08/5, Decision on Jurisdiction, 2 June 2010, para. 190; *Duke Energy Electroquil Partners & Electroquil S.A. v. Republic of Ecuador,* ICSID Case No. ARB/04/19, Award, 18 August 2008, para. 320 (recognizing that the majority of decisions that have addressed the issue have not found that \"sovereign interference\" is necessary to establish a breach of an umbrella clause).\n\n94.\n\nWith respect to Respondent\u2019s concern that the Tribunal is construing the umbrella clause more broadly than the Swiss Government,85 the Tribunal need only note that both it and the Swiss Government are in accord that Article 11 extends to contractual commitments. Again, the Tribunal already addressed this matter in the Decision on Jurisdiction (at para. 169).\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial at paras. 92-93.\n\n95.\n\nIn light of these conclusions, the parties\u2019 discussion of whether Paraguay took actions of a sovereign nature, and, if so, whether such actions were an abuse of government authority, is irrelevant. In short, if Paraguay failed to observe its contractual commitments, then it breached Article 11. No further examination of whether Paraguay\u2019s actions are properly characterized as \"sovereign\" or \"commercial\" in nature is necessary.\n\n**(ii) Respondent\u2019s Argument That the Forum Selection Clause Precludes a Finding of Liability**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**(a) Respondent\u2019s Position**\n-----------------------------\n\n96.\n\nRespondent argues that, under Paraguayan law and the terms of the Contract, the forum selection clause in Article 9 of the Contract precludes a finding of liability by the Tribunal. As explained above, Article 9 of the Contract states that \"[a]ny conflict, controversy or claim deriving from or arising in connection with this Agreement, breach, termination or invalidity, shall be submitted to the Courts of the City of Asunci\u00f3n under the Law of Paraguay.\" Respondent argues that the forum selection clause precludes the Tribunal from finding Respondent liable for its failure to observe its contractual commitments because any determination of whether Respondent breached the Contract must be submitted to local courts.\n\n97.\n\nRespondent asserts that this argument pertains to the merits of the dispute. According to Respondent, the forum selection clause in Article 9 of the Contract and the payment obligations set forth in Article 4 of the Contract comprise a single, unified obligation. According to Respondent, \"the \u2018commitment\u2019 that Paraguay made was to pay SGS or to resolve disputes about payment in the local courts. It has not breached that commitment; the Paraguayan courts have been available throughout the parties\u2019 dispute to resolve SGS\u2019s claims to payment.\"86\n\nRespondent\u2019s Rejoinder at para. 45.\n\n98.\n\nRespondent recognizes that the Tribunal has already concluded in the Decision on Jurisdiction that the forum selection clause does not deprive the Tribunal of jurisdiction or render Claimant\u2019s claims inadmissible. Respondent argues that the position it has articulated at the merits stage is not incompatible with the Tribunal\u2019s previous decision. Respondent argues that \"the issue for the merits is not whether the Tribunal should decline to hear the claim based on the forum-selection clause *(i.e.,* in favor of an alternative local forum), but whether SGS has failed to prove its claim because Paraguay has never repudiated its commitment of a local forum to resolve disputes regarding payment. That merits issue has not been decided.\"87\n\nRespondent\u2019s Rejoinder at para. 46.\n\n99.\n\nRespondent further recognizes that the Swiss Government, one of the Parties to the BIT, has taken the position that an umbrella clause covers claims for mere breaches of contract but argues that \"[t]he Swiss government did not address whether a contract as a whole makes up the relevant contractual commitment (as Paraguay maintains), or whether each contractual clause can be divided into a separate commitment (as SGS argues)\"88 In other words, Respondent argues that the Swiss Government\u2019s position on the scope of an umbrella clause did not preclude the possibility that a forum selection clause in a contract could prevent a finding of liability under the BIT, at least as long as the Respondent remains willing to submit the contractual dispute for resolution in accordance with such clause.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Rejoinder at para. 48.\n\n**(b) Claimant\u2019s Position**\n---------------------------\n\n100.\n\nClaimant argues that the Tribunal\u2019s Decision on Jurisdiction already rejected Respondent\u2019s argument that the forum selection clause in the Contract prevented the Tribunal from finding Respondent liable under Article ll.89 According to Claimant, \"What Paraguay seems to suggest is that this Tribunal is not the permissible forum to make such a finding of breach. This conclusion, of course, flies in the face of the Tribunal\u2019s earlier findings in its Decision on Jurisdiction that the Tribunal has jurisdiction over SGS\u2019s Article 11 claim and that such claim is immediately admissible despite the forum selection clause.\"90\n\nClaimant\u2019s Reply at paras. 86-89.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Reply at para. 88.\n\n**(c) Tribunal\u2019s Analysis**\n---------------------------\n\n101.\n\nThe Tribunal does not accept Respondent\u2019s argument. The law applicable to Claimant\u2019s claim is the BIT, including Article 11 of the BIT and the investor-state dispute settlement provisions in Article 9 of the BIT. Article 11 requires Respondent to observe its commitments with respect to Swiss investors. The \"commitment\" at issue in this dispute is the Contract. There is no dispute that the Contract requires payment in accordance with the invoicing procedures set forth therein and that Respondent has not paid the vast majority of the invoices SGS issued. In these circumstances, the Tribunal has no difficulty concluding that Respondent did not fulfill its contractual commitments.\n\n102.\n\nRespondent goes to great pains to argue that it is not rearguing the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdictional finding but is making a defense on the merits. Respondent argues that it cannot be found to have failed to observe its contractual commitments unless Claimant proves that Respondent has failed to meet its payment obligations under the Contract *and* frustrated the operation of the forum selection clause. These two elements are, in Respondent\u2019s view, part and parcel of a single contractual commitment. Therefore, Respondent argues, a mere failure to meet its payment obligations does not in itself breach the Contract, much less the BIT.\n\n103.\n\nRespondent\u2019s argument can be summarized as follows: (1) Article 11 of the BIT requires compliance with the Contract; (2) the Contract requires that Respondent pay SGS; (3) while Respondent has not paid most of SGS\u2019s invoices, the Contract states that any disputes regarding payment must be submitted to local courts; and (4) until the local courts resolve the dispute, Respondent is not in breach of its contractual obligations.\n\n104.\n\nThere are several problems with Respondent\u2019s defense. First, Respondent has not cited any legal authority, including under Paraguayan law, in support of its position. Certainly, there is nothing explicit in the Contract on that point. In fact, Article 7.1 of the Contract, which allows one party to terminate the Contract for the other party\u2019s breach of contract, implies the opposite, *i.e.,* that no court determination or frustration of the forum selection clause is necessary for a breach to have occurred.91\n\nArticle 7.1 of the Contract states as follows:  \n The parties may terminate this Agreement by reason of non-compliance with the provisions set forth herein and with the applicable legal provisions.  \n If non-compliance is attributable to THE MINISTRY, SGS shall notify the grounds invoked which, if not remedied in a reasonable period of time, shall authorize the termination of the agreement.  \n If the non-compliance is attributable to SGS, THE MINISTRY shall notify the grounds invoked, setting forth a term within which contractual and legal provisions shall be fulfilled, as required by the public interest, and which, if not met duly and timely, shall produce the agreement termination effect by law.\n\n105.\n\nSecond, in the absence of any legal authority to the contrary, in the Tribunal\u2019s view, it is clear that the payment and dispute resolution provisions in the Contract are not alternative options but two discrete obligations. If Respondent failed to comply with its payment obligations and if it frustrated Claimant\u2019s attempt to submit disputes to local courts in accordance with the forum selection clause, then, in the Tribunal\u2019s view, Respondent would have failed to comply with two commitments under the Contract, not one. The two obligations are discrete, separate commitments as between the parties. Assuming the contrary would, in effect, imply that one can only breach a contract when it breaches, not one, but more than one of its clauses.\n\n106.\n\nStated differently, Respondent\u2019s argument, taken on its face, lacks logical coherence. Paraguay argues that \"the \u2018commitment\u2019 that Paraguay made was to pay SGS or to resolve disputes about payment in the local courts.\"92 This cannot be correct. It cannot be that Paraguay had the option of *either* paying its invoices *or* submitting the dispute to local courts.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Rejoinder at para. 45.\n\n107.\n\nThird, if Respondent negotiated the Contract in the expectation that the forum selection clause in the Contract would negate its responsibility under the BIT, then Respondent\u2019s assumptions were misplaced. Respondent argues that the forum selection clause was part of the bargain the parties struck when negotiating the Contract, and that a finding of liability by the Tribunal would undermine that bargain because all of the substantive requirements of the Contract were negotiated under the expectation that any disputes would be submitted to local courts. However, Respondent ignores the fact that, in addition to agreeing to the forum selection clause in the Contract, it separately agreed to arbitration in accordance with the BIT. By doing so, Respondent offered to Swiss investors an alternative forum for dispute settlement. The BIT arbitration mechanism formed part of the applicable legal framework and became, in effect, an irrevocable part of the bargain.\n\n108.\n\nThe flaw in Respondent\u2019s position is well illustrated by the position it has taken in this arbitration as to its own allegations of breach. As discussed in further detail below, Respondent argues at length that it was justified in withholding payment because Claimant breached its obligations under the Contract. For example, in Respondent\u2019s Rejoinder (at para. 49), Respondent argues, \"Because the Contract requires SGS to comply strictly with the terms of the Contract, any of these three grounds [related to SGS\u2019s alleged failure to meet its obligations] rendered SGS in breach of the Contract. Under Paraguayan law, therefore, Paraguay was entitled to withhold payments and did not breach its contractual \u2018commitments.\u2019\" Yet, if Respondent is correct that its payment obligations are part of a unified obligation with the forum selection clause, then so too are Claimant\u2019s performance commitments. There was certainly no disclaimer in Respondent\u2019s discussion of Claimant\u2019s alleged breaches - or in any contemporaneous documentation that Respondent has produced regarding Claimant\u2019s performance - that would indicate that Claimant cannot breach its contractual obligations until such time as it may refuse to submit disputes for resolution in local courts.\n\n109.\n\nRespondent\u2019s argument is, in effect, simply an attempt to relitigate the arguments it raised in the jurisdictional stage, and which the Tribunal rejected. In the Decision on Jurisdiction, the Tribunal found that the forum selection clause did not deprive the Tribunal of jurisdiction over the dispute nor did it render Claimant\u2019s claims inadmissible. Furthermore, the Tribunal found that, once having taken jurisdiction over the claims, it was compelled to decide them. The Tribunal would not be deciding the claims if it now concludes that the claims must be resolved by local courts. Respondent\u2019s attempt now to repackage its argument as a defense on the merits does not change that conclusion.\n\n**(iii) Respondent\u2019s Argument That Claimant Breached the Contract**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n110.\n\nRespondent argues that its failure to pay SGS\u2019s invoices is excused by the fact that Claimant breached its own obligations under the Contract. According to Respondent, \"Even a small deviation from the Programme\u2019s requirements\u2014and SGS\u2019s deviation was anything but small\u2014excused Paraguay\u2019s performance.\"93 Respondent claims that,\n\n\"[u]nder Paraguayan law, therefore, Paraguay was entitled to withhold payments and did not breach its contractual \u2018commitments.\u2019\"94\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial at para. 114.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Rejoinder at para. 49\n\n111.\n\nRespondent argues that Claimant breached its obligations by: (a) failing to train Customs officials and establish a usable database; (b) issuing multiple invoices for certain Certificates of Inspection; (c) improperly conducting inspections and issuing invoices for imports from the Mercosur region; and (d) improperly conducting inspections and issuing invoices for imports of petroleum products. The Tribunal shall examine each of these allegations below.\n\n**(a) Whether Claimant Breached Its Contractual Obligations with Respect to Training Customs Officials and the Establishment of a Database**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**(1) Respondent\u2019s Position**\n-----------------------------\n\n112.\n\nRespondent alleges that Claimant breached its obligations under Articles 2.9 and 2.10 of the Contract. Under Article 2.9 of the Contract (\"Technical Cooperation\"), ****SGS****  was required to provide training twice a year for up to six Customs officials. The training program was to \"include, but not [be] limited to, the techniques used by ****SGS****  personnel, the technical, administrative and organizational procedures, with the purpose of reaching an efficient and effective execution and protection of tax revenues and to make up a body of officials specialized in customs valuation.\"\n\n113.\n\nUnder Article 2.10 of the Contract, **SGS** was to help create a database for Customs \"based upon the information contained in the Inspection Certificates issued by it.\" **SGS** was also to \"provide Customs with technical assistance and advice for the creation of programs and procedures that may enable the monitoring of the database...\"\n\n114.\n\nAccording to Respondent, the training and database were intended not simply to enhance revenue collection but to enable local customs authorities to operate a customs system independently, with the longer term objective of creating an efficient and modem customs system to strengthen the local economy. Respondent argues that **SGS** merely held a few small training sessions in Paraguay and simply turned over the raw data in the Inspection Certificates in digital form. According to Respondent, \"These actions, although important, are insufficient to demonstrate that SGS discharged its technical assistance obligations so as to permit Customs to perform price comparisons using a database developed by SGS and BIVAC. No database or usable data was ever given to Paraguay.\"95\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial at para. 39.\n\n115.\n\nIn support of its position, Respondent refers to a 30 March 1999 report by the Comptroller General of Customs,96 a 22 June 1999 report to the Minister of Finance,97 and a 28 January 2003 report of the Ministry of Finance\u2019s internal auditor,98 which, Respondent claims, found that SGS had not met its obligations under the Contract.\n\nReport from Victor Jos\u00e9 Soler to Celso Guillermo Romero Rol\u00f4n dated 30 March 1999, Ex. RE-2 (\"Customs Report\").\n\nReport from Internal Auditors to Minister of Finance dated 22 June 1999, Ex. RE-17.\n\nReport from Internal Audit Coordinator to Minister of Finance dated 28 January 2003, Ex. RE-18.\n\n**(2) Claimant\u2019s Position**\n---------------------------\n\n116.\n\nClaimant argues that it met its obligation to provide training under Article 2.9 of the Contract by providing equipment to Customs and training officials on the methodologies and procedures of tariff classification and valuation.99 SGS claims that it met its obligations under Article 2.10 of the Contract by providing Customs with software, computers, and modem connections, and providing Customs with data from the Inspection Certificates in electronic form. Furthermore, Mr. Musalem testified that SGS conducted several training seminars for Customs officials and trained Customs officials on the equipment and the database that SGS provided. According to Claimant, SGS employees traveled to Paraguay from Miami, Peru and Ecuador to provide training. SGS claims that it spent approximately US$ 317,000 on these training programs, and Customs never complained directly to SGS about the training program.\n\n*See* First Musalem Statement at paras. 32-34.\n\n117.\n\nClaimant questions the accuracy of the 30 March 1999 Customs report and the January 28, 2003 report of Ministry of Finance\u2019s internal auditor. Claimant notes that neither report provided evidence for its conclusions. Claimant believes that Customs\u2019 conclusions in the March 1999 report were due to a general lack of knowledge of the services SGS was providing. For example, in response to a 30 July 1998 request by Customs, SGS provided a full report showing that \"[t]he analysis, development, testing and approval of the databases for Customs have been performed and coordinated...\" and that the relevant customs information had been transferred and updated weekly.100 According to Claimant, the fact that Customs did not already possess this information, and instead required a full reporting by SGS, indicates that Customs was not fully aware of the services that SGS had been providing. According to Claimant, \"As with Customs\u2019 unawareness in July 1998 of the technical services provided by SGS with respect to the database (clarified through SGS\u2019s August 1998 letter), the Customs inspector\u2019s unawareness in March 1999 of SGS\u2019s training services can be explained only by a lack of internal coordination and thoroughness.\"101\n\nLetter from SGS to Customs dated 4 August 1998, Ex. C-90. SGS also provided an internal company e-mail dated 3 August 1998 that explains how SGS coordinated with a Customs representative to provide weekly file updates for the database. Internal e-mail dated 3 August 1998, Ex. C-89.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Memorial at para. 52.\n\n118.\n\nClaimant argues that both the 2003 report and the June 1999 report that Respondent cites merely refer back to the March 1999 report and, therefore, have the same deficiencies.102\n\nDay 1 Tr. (Merits) at p. 44.\n\n**(3) Tribunal\u2019s Analysis**\n---------------------------\n\n119.\n\nIn the Tribunal\u2019s view, Respondent has not carried its burden of proving that Claimant failed to meet its contractual obligations under Articles 2.9 and 2.10 of the Contract. Claimant has provided contemporaneous documentation (in the form of its 1998 letter to Customs) as well as testimony from Mr. Musalem, a knowledgeable and credible witness, regarding the services that it provided.103 Such services included training, the provision of hardware and software, and the provision of data for the database. No evidence has been provided that Respondent contested the information in SGS\u2019s 1998 letter. The author of the first document invoked by Respondent, z'.e., the Customs Report dated 30 March 1999,104 expressly admits that he is \"totally ignorant\" (\"cabe manifestar el total desconocimiento\") of most of the issues referred to in the Report and in the Contract. The Report simply states that the training \"has not been done\" but does not provide any further justification. The other two documents that Respondent relies upon are conclusory and fail to identify deficiencies in the services SGS provided with any meaningful specificity.\n\n*See* First Musalem Statement at paras. 32-34.\n\nCustoms Report dated 30 March 1999, Ex. RE-2.\n\n120.\n\nFurthermore, as Claimant notes and Respondent does not dispute, the reports were never provided to Claimant and, therefore, any discrepancies were clearly not significant enough to be brought to Claimant\u2019s attention during the life of the Contract. In fact, there is no evidence that any problem with respect to SGS\u2019s training program was raised during any of the weekly (and sometimes more frequent) meetings between SGS and Customs.105 The Tribunal finds it telling that, so far as the record reflects, Respondent made no contemporaneous complaints about SGS\u2019s compliance with its training obligations under the Contract.\n\nDay 1 Tr. (Merits) at pp. 166:14-22, 167:1-9. Mr. Musalem testified that \"meetings were held on a weekly basis, or even twice weekly, with the government, with customs, with the director of customs, specifically who was the person who would receive our certificates and was going to use them for clearance of merchandise through customs.... We never, on the part of the government, nor the ministry or customs, did we hear any protests regarding any poor practice or poor implantation |.w| of the contract. Until the day I left Paraguay, I never received anything from the government, from any authority, from the three administrations during that period.\"\n\n121.\n\nIn any case, even if SGS has breached its obligations, Respondent has provided no legal authority supporting its position that it would therefore be relieved of any obligation to make payments under the Contract even while continuing to accept SGS\u2019s inspection services. No provision in the Contract provides such authority. In fact, under Article 7.1 of the Contract, if one party believes that the other has breached its contractual obligations, the proper remedy for the aggrieved party is to terminate the Contract for non-performance and, subject to the limitation of liability in Article 5.3, seek damages for any harm suffered. But the Contract does not allow the allegedly aggrieved party to continue to demand performance while simply ceasing to meet its own contractual obligations.\n\n**(b) Multiple Invoices for Certain Inspection Certificates**\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**(1) Respondent\u2019s Position**\n-----------------------------\n\n122.\n\nAccording to Respondent, Articles 6 and 16 of Resolution 1171 required that SGS issue only a single Inspection Certificate for each commercial invoice associated with an imported shipment. Respondent translates Article 16 of Resolution 1171 to require the issuance of \"one\" Inspection Certificate.106\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial at para. 44, n. 45. Article 16 of Resolution 1171 states, \"[U]na vez recibida del exportador la factura comercial y/u otros documentos requeridos por las Empresas Verificadoras, y despu\u00e9s de comprobar que la cantidad, precio y descripci\u00f3n de los bienes consignados en dicha factura correspondan a los resultados de la inspecci\u00f3n f\u00edsica y comparaci\u00f3n de precio, o cuando las anomal\u00edas observadas hayan sido corregidas, las Empresas Verificadoras emitir\u00e1n un Certificado de Inspecci\u00f3n.\" Respondent translates Article 16 as follows: \"[O]nce the commercial invoice or other documents requested by the Verifying Companies is received from the exporter, and after the verification that the quantity, price and description of goods consigned in said commercial invoice correspond to the results of the physical inspection and price comparison, or, in the event of any discrepancies, once these discrepancies have been resolved and corrected, the Verifying Companies shall issue one Inspection Certificate.\"\n\n123.\n\nRespondent argues that Claimant violated this requirement by \"routinely\" issuing multiple Inspection Certificates. In support of its position, Respondent points to a 22 June 1999 internal report to the Minister of Finance, which concluded as follows:107\n\nThere is... evidence of bills of lading for amounts higher than $21,800 that have two, three or more Certificates of Inspection, which, in many cases, do not reach individually the minimum amount. The inspection companies present their assessment as separate inspections, and in cases of convenience they charge the minimum fee, in open contradiction to what is established in Article No. 6, 4th paragraph, which requires in all cases that the inspection company treat these together, when they refer to a single operation.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial at para. 46, n. 47.\n\n**(2) Claimant\u2019s Position**\n---------------------------\n\n124.\n\nClaimant notes that SGS was never provided with the 1999 report of the Ministry of Finance to which Respondent refers, and was not otherwise put on notice of any problems with its invoicing practices during the weekly meetings with Customs. In any case, according to Claimant, the report did not find that SGS engaged in wrongdoing but merely stated that it was:108\n\nnecessary to improve the legal framework governing the work of the inspection companies, especially as concerns payments for services, as such framework does not today contemplate several situations that currently result in a significant loss for the State, contrary to what we consider to be the object of implementation of this program, *i.e.,* increase tax collection.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Reply at para. 36, *citing* Report from Internal Auditors to Minister of Finance dated 22 June 1999, Ex. RE-17.\n\n125.\n\nIn other words, according to Claimant, the report was describing certain adjustments that needed to be made to the Contract but did not conclude that Claimant was breaching its existing contractual obligations.\n\n126.\n\nFurthermore, Claimant argues, its conduct was appropriate and, in fact, necessary in order to meet its contractual commitments. Claimant describes two situations in which multiple Inspection Certificates would be necessary for a single invoice. First, large sales associated with a single invoice might be divided into a number of lower value shipments. In these situations, SGS would need to inspect each individual shipment and issue multiple Inspection Certificates, even though there would be only one commercial invoice. Claimant believes that this procedure fully conformed with Article 6, paragraph 2, of Resolution 1171, which states that \"Partial shipments with values of less than THREE THOUSAND U.S. DOLLARS (US$ 3000) FOB that are part of a request or purchase/sale order exceeding THREE THOUSAND U.S. DOLLARS (US$ 3000) FOB shall be subject to Pre-shipment Inspection.\"\n\n127.\n\nSecond, SGS would need to issue multiple Inspection Certificates when several exporters shipped goods that were combined into a single import shipment. In this situation, SGS would need to inspect the goods of each exporter separately. Claimant argues that this approach was mandated by Article 6, paragraph 4, of Resolution 1171, which states that \"Merchandise shipped to the same importer or by a single shipper from several suppliers and consolidated in a single bill of lading shall be subject to the Pre-shipment Inspection Program if the total amount thereof equals or exceeds THREE THOUSAND U.S. DOLLARS (US$ 3000) FOB.\"\n\n128.\n\nClaimant argues that, properly translated, Article 6 of Resolution 1171 does not limit the number of Inspection Certificates to one per invoice.109 It also argues that, pursuant to Article 4.1.1 of the Contract, it was entitled to submit an invoice for each inspection.110\n\nClaimant\u2019s Reply at para 33, n. 35.\n\nDay 1 Tr. (Merits) at p. 35. Article 4.1.1 of the Contract states, \"The fees for the Technical Services shall be calculated upon 1.3 % (one point three percent) on the FOB value of the goods shown in the Inspection Certificate or in the Discrepancy Report and expressed in United States dollars.\"\n\n**(3) Tribunal\u2019s Analysis**\n---------------------------\n\n129.\n\nThe Tribunal finds that Respondent has not carried its burden of proof that Claimant\u2019s invoicing practices were impermissible.\n\n130.\n\nResolution 1171 states that, in the two circumstances described by Claimant, SGS was required to conduct a pre-shipment inspection. The only apparent way SGS could do so was for SGS to inspect the small shipments associated with the larger invoice.\n\n131.\n\nResolution 1171 is not clear how such inspections should be charged, and neither party has provided legal authority to assist the Tribunal in understanding how Resolution 1171 should be interpreted. In the Tribunal\u2019s view, it would not be reasonable to conclude that the parties intended that SGS charge nothing for the inspections. We are left, then, with deciding whether SGS should have charged the minimum fee for each inspection, or whether it should have charged Respondent based on a percentage of the shipment as a whole.\n\n132.\n\nSGS charged the minimum amount. In the Tribunal\u2019s view, this was a reasonable approach, as there is no evidence to show that the cost of any individual inspection would be lower if the component shipments were of lower value. Furthermore, there is no dispute that SGS\u2019s uniform practice throughout the performance of the Contract was to charge the minimum fee in these circumstances, yet Respondent has provided no evidence that it told SGS that it objected to this approach. As noted above, Claimant\u2019s witness, Mr. Musalem, testified that SGS and Customs met on a weekly basis, and sometimes twice weekly, and Customs never raised concerns.111 Even if the March 1999 report concluded that Claimant\u2019s methodology was inappropriate, Claimant notes - and Respondent does not dispute - that the report was not communicated to Claimant at the time.112 In the circumstances here, we find persuasive in interpreting the Contract the parties\u2019 uncontentious conduct in performing it. The Tribunal therefore concludes that Claimant\u2019s invoicing methodology did not violate its contractual obligations.\n\nDay 1 Tr. (Merits) at p. 166:14-167:9.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Reply at para. 32.\n\n**(c) Mercosur Program**\n------------------------\n\n**(1) Respondent\u2019s Position**\n-----------------------------\n\n133.\n\nRespondent argues that SGS improperly inspected goods originating from the Mercosur region. Resolution 1579 exempted from inspection \"[a]quellas importaciones liberadas y las exoneradas de los tributos aduaneros e internos, contenidas en las disposiciones de caracter general o en Leyes Especiales,\" which Respondent translates as \"any and all tax free imports free and clear of those duties or internal taxes, as described in general or special laws.\"113 Respondent argues that duty-free goods coming from free trade areas (such as Mercosur) were thereby exempt from pre-shipment inspection.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial at para. 24.\n\n134.\n\nRespondent argues that inspections of imports from the Mercosur region likely accounted for a very significant portion of SGS\u2019s total inspections. According to Respondent, imports from Mercosur countries represented over 50% of all imports into Paraguay during the life of the Contract.114 (Respondent later estimated that imports from the Mercosur region accounted for closer to 70% of the goods SGS inspected).115 Extrapolating from the import data, Respondent argues that at least 50% of all of SGS\u2019s Inspection Certificates were associated with Mercosur imports and, therefore, improper. Citing a 28 January 2003 internal report of the Ministry of Finance, Respondent argues that \"[t]he indiscriminate inspection of goods without regard to the Programme\u2019s regulations was duly noted by the Paraguayan authorities during SGS\u2019s performance and afterward.\"116\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial at para. 25.\n\nDay 1 Tr. (Merits) atp. 75:1-11.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial at para. 51, *citing* Report from Internal Audit Coordinator to Minister of Finance dated 28 January 2003, Ex. RE-18.\n\n135.\n\nRespondent also argues that inspections were not necessary to confirm the origin of Mercosur goods as the Treaty of Asunci\u00f3n requires Paraguay to accept at face value the import declaration that goods originate in a Mercosur country. Respondent notes that Mercosur goods could only be imported with a declaration certifying that the goods came from a Mercosur country and that, under the terms of the Treaty of Asunci\u00f3n, \"[i]n no case may the importing country hold up import procedures for products covered by the certificates [of origin].\"117\n\n*See* Annex II, Chapter II, Articles 11 and 16 of the Treaty of Asunci\u00f3n, Ex. RE-26.\n\n136.\n\nRespondent argues that an internal report to the Minister of Finance, dated 22 June 1999, concluded that, for imports from Mercosur countries, Paraguay receives no customs duties and can receive as little as 1.5% in VAT. Therefore, Respondent argues, if Paraguay has to pay SGS fees of 1.3%, it only retains 0.2% in revenue. The report therefore concludes that the legal framework should be improved.118\n\n*See* Report from Internal Auditors to Minister of Finance dated 22 June 1999, Ex. RE-17.\n\n137.\n\nRespondent notes Claimant\u2019s argument (discussed in further detail below) that the exemption in Resolution 1579 applied only to imports that were exempt from both duties *and* taxes. However, Respondent argues that the exemption should be interpreted to apply to goods that were exempt from *either* duties *or* taxes.119\n\nRespondent\u2019s Rejoinder at paras. 15-18.\n\n138.\n\nRespondent also notes Claimant\u2019s argument that inspections were necessary because VAT and other taxes were assessed based on import value, and most Mercosur imports were subject to taxes. However, Respondent argues that even if goods imported from Mercosur countries were subject to VAT and other taxes assessed on the basis of import value, Paraguay was obligated to accept the importer declarations at face value, and so no inspection was needed.120 Respondent also argues that Claimant admits that not all imports from the Mercosur region were subject to VAT or other taxes, Claimant has not adequately proven the percentage of such imports that were subject to taxes, and Claimant has not shown that it did not inspect the portion of Mercosur imports that were exempt from taxes.121\n\nRespondent\u2019s Rejoinder at para. 19.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Rejoinder at para. 20.\n\n**(2) Claimant\u2019s Position**\n---------------------------\n\n139.\n\nClaimant does not deny that it inspected imports from the Mercosur region but argues that it was required to do so. Claimant argues that it would be \"inconceivable\" that Customs and the Ministry of Finance had not caught the error if SGS was, in fact, improperly inspecting more than 50% of the imports into Paraguay or that Customs would not have brought it to Claimant\u2019s attention.122\n\nClaimant\u2019s Reply at para. 43.\n\n140.\n\nClaimant raises several arguments in support of its position. First, according to Claimant, SGS was required to confirm that the origin of the goods was properly designated. Claimant refers specifically to Article 2(6) of the Contract, which stated that \"SGS shall prove the country of origin of goods based upon the documents issued by official entities or authorized agencies, submitted by the supplier upon the importer\u2019s request, for the consideration thereof in the cases of tariff treatments and special regimes.\" In Claimant\u2019s view, imports from the Mercosur region are subject to a \"special regime.\"123\n\nDay 1 Tr. (Merits) at p. 29:1-5.\n\n141.\n\nSecond, according to Claimant, Resolution 1579 did not exempt imports from the Mercosur region from inspection. Claimant translates Resolution 1579 as exempting \"[t]hose imports released and those exempted from customs duties and internal taxes contained in the general provisions or Special Laws.\"124 In Claimant\u2019s view, Resolution 1579 exempted from inspection only those goods that were exempted from *both* customs duties *and* internal taxes, such as VAT and sales tax.125 While goods originating from the Mercosur region were usually exempt from customs duties, they were not usually exempt from VAT. Claimant notes that more than 90% of goods from Mercosur were subject to VAT and taxed, and VAT and sales tax were paid based on the price referenced in the Inspection Certificate provided by the inspection company, either SGS or BIVAC.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Reply at para. 40.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Reply at para. 41.\n\n142.\n\nThird, with respect to the 2003 internal Ministry of Finance report to which Respondent refers, Claimant notes that the document was produced four years after the fact, and, therefore, questions its accuracy.126\n\nClaimant\u2019s Reply at para. 45.\n\n143.\n\nFourth, with respect to the 1999 internal report of the Ministry of Finance, Claimant argues that this document did not, in fact, conclude that SGS was improperly inspecting Mercosur imports. Instead, in Claimant\u2019s view, it was arguing only for a change of the existing legal framework in light of the fact that Respondent retained very little revenue after SGS\u2019s fees were paid.\n\n144.\n\nFifth, Claimant emphasizes that SGS conducted inspections at the request of importers. Claimant argues that an importer would not request an inspection of a shipment from the Mercosur region if it did not need one.127 Claimant also notes that, if an inspection were not necessary, then SGS would decline to carry it out. If the importer nevertheless wanted to have its shipment inspected, it would be charged directly for the service.128\n\nDay 1 Tr. (Merits) at p. 142:5-15.\n\nDay 1 Tr. (Merits) at pp. 160, 163-164:2. Claimant also argues that SGS could not charge the importer for an inspection of a shipment from the Mercosur region because that would constitute an impermissible restraint on trade. Day 1 Tr. (Merits) at p. 199:8-14.\n\n145.\n\nFinally, Claimant notes that Customs never raised concerns about its inspection and invoicing practices despite the fact that SGS and Customs met weekly (and sometimes twice weekly) to discuss SGS\u2019s invoices.129\n\nDay 1 Tr. (Merits) at pp. 166-167.\n\n**(3) Tribunal\u2019s Analysis**\n---------------------------\n\n146.\n\nThe Tribunal finds that Respondent has not carried its burden of proof in establishing that Claimant improperly inspected shipments from the Mercosur region. Respondent has provided no legal authority for its position apart from the language of Resolution 1579. In the Tribunal\u2019s view, however, the language of Resolution 1579 supports Claimant\u2019s position.\n\n147.\n\nResolution 1579 exempts from inspection those goods that are exempted from customs duties and internal taxes. The Tribunal interprets the relevant provision, as written and in context, as exempting a single class of goods, *i.e.,* those that are exempt from both customs duties and internal taxes. In fact, the preamble to Resolution 1579 states in its second paragraph that the purpose of the Resolution is to ensure that merchandise is not subject to pre-shipment inspection if the merchandise is exempt from \"all customs duties and non-customs taxes\" *(\"todo* tributo, aduanero y no aduanero\") (emphasis added). Moreover, Respondent\u2019s reading would lead to a perverse result. Respondent argues that the phrase should be interpreted to exempt goods from inspection if they were exempt from *either* customs duties *or* internal taxes. However, under this interpretation, goods that were exempt from internal taxes but *assessed customs duties* would also be exempt from inspection.130 The Tribunal finds it difficult to believe that the parties intended such a result given that the primary purpose of the pre-shipment inspection process was to ensure the proper collection of customs duties.\n\nIt is not clear whether there is a class of goods that is subject to internal taxes but not tariffs. However, if there is no such class of goods, then it would make little sense to exempt that non-existent class from inspection.\n\n148.\n\nFurthermore, as Claimant argues and Respondent does not dispute, imports from the Mercosur region were subject to VAT and sales tax, and such taxes were assessed based on the price referenced in the Inspection Certificate. While Respondent argues that the Treaty of Asuncion requires Paraguay to accept, for duty assessment purposes, the declared customs value without the need for an inspection, the portions of the Treaty of Asuncion on which Respondent relies do not require Paraguay to accept the declared value for purposes of assessing internal taxes. Therefore, it does, in fact, appear to the Tribunal that it was necessary for SGS to conduct the inspections for tax assessment purposes, and it would be remarkable if SGS were prohibited from invoicing for them, particularly if, as Respondent argues, such imports accounted for 50-70% of the total imports into Paraguay. The Tribunal is also persuaded that it would be unlikely for an importer to request an inspection for an import from the Mercosur region that was exempt from both customs duties and internal taxes. For these reasons, the Tribunal concludes that Respondent has not carried its burden in proving that Claimant breached its contractual commitments.\n\n149.\n\nThe Tribunal again notes that Claimant\u2019s witness, Mr. Musalem, testified that SGS and Customs met weekly, and sometimes twice a week, to discuss the Inspection Certificates, and yet, according to Mr. Musalem, Customs never raised any objections to the invoices associated with Mercosur imports.131 Respondent has not presented evidence contradicting Mr. Musalem\u2019s testimony. Again, we find persuasive the common understanding of the Contract reflected in the parties\u2019 contemporaneous performance.\n\n*See, e.g.,* Day 1 Tr. (Merits) at pp. 166:14-167:9.\n\n**(d) Petroleum-Related Invoices**\n----------------------------------\n\n**(1) Respondent\u2019s Position**\n-----------------------------\n\n150.\n\nRespondent argues that SGS improperly inspected imports of certain petroleum products even though SGS agreed to cease inspecting petroleum shipments as of 1 September 1997. According to Respondent, SGS charged Paraguay approximately US$ 65,800.00 for inspections on and after that date for imports by Petropar, Paraguay\u2019s state oil company.132 According to Respondent, SGS is not entitled to damages for unpaid invoices associated with those inspections.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Rejoinder at para. 29.\n\n**(2) Claimant\u2019s Position**\n---------------------------\n\n151.\n\nClaimant notes that this issue was not raised until Respondent\u2019s Rejoinder. In any case, Claimant argues that such imports were not of petroleum products but of equipment. It further argues that, to the extent any invoices from September 1997 were associated with petroleum products, it retroactively credited Paraguay for these amounts.133\n\nDay 1 Tr. (Merits) atpp. 40:17-41:7; Day 1 Tr. (Merits) atp. 136.\n\n**(3) Tribunal\u2019s Analysis**\n---------------------------\n\n152.\n\nThe Tribunal concludes that Respondent has not carried its burden in proving that Claimant improperly invoiced Paraguay for the inspection of petroleum imports after 1 September 1997. Respondent has provided no evidence that the imports in question were for petroleum products rather than equipment and has not disputed Claimant\u2019s contention that it credited Paraguay for any invoices associated with petroleum product shipments in September 1997.\n\n**c. Conclusion**\n-----------------\n\n153.\n\nOn the basis of the foregoing, the Tribunal concludes that Respondent has failed to meet its contractual commitments and that such breach violates Respondent\u2019s obligation under Article 11 of the BIT to observe \"the commitments it has entered into with respect to the investments of the other investors of the Contracting Party.\"\n\n154.\n\nClaimant has demonstrated, and Respondent does not dispute, that Claimant\u2019s invoices were not paid. Furthermore, Respondent has failed to carry its burden of proof in showing that the non-payment was justified due to Claimant\u2019s failure to meet its contractual obligations. Indeed, it does not appear that Respondent raised any complaint with Claimant regarding its invoicing procedures during the life of the Contract. The failure of Respondent to raise any concerns during the life of the Contract is particularly telling given the ample opportunity it had to do so during Customs\u2019 weekly meetings with SGS.\n\n155.\n\nThe Tribunal also notes that, according to Article 4.5 of the Contract, \"[s]hould any discrepancy event arise between the Ministry and SGS, in connection with the documentation attached to the invoice, payment of the non-objected amounts shall be made, the parties having to promptly settle such discrepancies.\" Therefore, if there were any disagreement between the parties regarding the invoices, Respondent could have paid the uncontested portions of the invoices and contested the remainder. Respondent did not, however, contest the invoices at the time. Eventually, Respondent simply ceased making payments, but it did not link the non-payment to Claimant\u2019s invoicing practices and did not pay even plainly uncontested amounts.\n\n156.\n\nAccordingly, the Tribunal finds that Respondent has failed to observe its contractual commitments in breach of Article 11 of the BIT.\n\n**3. Article 11 Claims Based on Alleged Extra-Contractual Commitments**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n157.\n\nClaimant asserts that the \"extra-contractual\" statements made by Paraguayan officials promising to pay SGS\u2019s invoices created additional enforceable commitments under Article 11 of the BIT. Respondent has argued that any statements by Paraguayan officials outside the Contract itself are not binding promises that are enforceable under Article 11. Respondent also argues that any such statements are inadmissible as they related to settlement discussions between the parties.\n\n158.\n\nThe Tribunal concludes that it need not resolve these matters. Even if the extra-contractual statements Claimant references constituted binding commitments, and even if Respondent broke such commitments, the breach would not result in any additional liability on behalf of Respondent. Even under Claimant\u2019s argument, the extra-contractual statements were merely promises to meet Respondent\u2019s underlying commitments under the Contract, and the Tribunal has already decided that Respondent has failed to observe those commitments. Having reached that conclusion, the Tribunal need not decide whether Respondent made additional promises that at best merely confirmed those commitments.\n\n159.\n\nWith respect to the admissibility of the extra-contractual statements, the Tribunal did not rely upon those statements in reaching its conclusion that Respondent failed to observe its commitments under the Contract. Therefore, the Tribunal need not resolve the issue of whether the statements are protected as settlement discussions or otherwise inadmissible.\n\n**IV. CLAIMANT\u2019S REMAINING CLAIMS**\n-----------------------------------\n\n160.\n\nIn addition to its claims under Article 11 of the BIT, Claimant asserts that Respondent\u2019s actions impaired Claimant\u2019s investment by undue and discriminatory measures in violation of Article 4(1) of the BIT and amounted to a denial of fair and equitable treatment under Article 4(2) of the BIT.\n\n161.\n\nIn light of the Tribunal\u2019s conclusion that Respondent breached Article 11 of the BIT by failing to meet its payment obligations under the Contract, the Tribunal need not address Claimant\u2019s remaining claims. Each of those claims arises from the same facts, and reduces to a claim that Respondent failed to pay the invoices. Even if the Tribunal were to find in favor of Claimant with respect to these claims, Claimant\u2019s damages would be unchanged. Therefore, any additional legal findings on these matters are unnecessary.134\n\nWhile the Tribunal need not resolve Claimant\u2019s claims that Respondent has breached the fair and equitable treatment standard, the Tribunal notes that there is support for the proposition that a breach of contract may rise to the level of a breach of the fair and equitable treatment obligation. *See, e.g., News from ICSID,* Vol. 11, No. 1 (Winter 1994), at 5 (noting that the Investment Protection Principles adopted in 1992 by the Council of the European Communities to provide details for the application of the investment protection and promotion principles contained in the Fourth Lom\u00e9 Convention on cooperation between the group of African, Caribbean, and Pacific countries and the EC and its Member States, define \"fair and equitable\" treatment to encompass observance of undertakings); UNCTAD, Fair and Equitable Treatment 35 (UNCTAD Series on Issues in International Investment Agreements, 1999) (concluding, with reference to the United Kingdom model BIT, that \"the idea of *pacta sunt servanda...* may also be viewed as a part of the fair and equitable standard\").\n\n**V. RESPONDENT\u2019S CLAIM OF PREJUDICE**\n--------------------------------------\n\n162.\n\nRespondent argues that its defense of this case was unduly prejudiced by the fact that Claimant waited several years after the termination of the Contract to initiate dispute settlement proceedings. During the intervening period, Respondent argues, records were lost and personnel changed.\n\n163.\n\nIn the Tribunal\u2019s view, Respondent was not prejudiced by the passage of time. Again, the basic facts are not in dispute. It is not disputed that Respondent was obligated to pay properly issued invoices. As discussed above, Respondent has failed to do so, and there is no evidence to the contrary.\n\n164.\n\nFurthermore, Respondent has argued throughout the arbitration that it continued to review SGS\u2019s performance of the Contract long after the agreement had terminated, and at least until 2006. Respondent must have believed that its own internal records were sufficient at least for purposes of those reviews, as it was able at the time to reach certain internal conclusions on certain aspects of the Contract, as discussed above. At a minimum, as it was itself continuing to review the matter with the ultimate objective of deciding whether or not payment was appropriate, it was incumbent on Respondent to preserve its own records. If it failed to do so, Claimant cannot be required to bear the consequences.\n\n165.\n\nFinally, Respondent was well aware that Claimant continued to seek payment of its invoices. As Claimant notes, the delay in initiating the arbitration is in part due to the fact that the parties were continuing to discuss ways to resolve the dispute during the several years after the Contract terminated. Respondent certainly knew that the claims for payment had not been forgotten or withdrawn, even if it could not know with certainty that Claimant would initiate arbitration proceedings. The fact that it did not retain and protect its records is an unfortunate problem of its own making. In light of these considerations, the Tribunal does not believe that Respondent has been unfairly prejudiced.\n\n166.\n\nThe Tribunal also notes that, unlike certain other investment agreements, the BIT at issue in this dispute does not contain a limitation period that would prevent Claimant from bringing a claim several years after the events in question took place. Therefore, there is no basis in the text to punish Claimant for failing to exercise its rights sooner.\n\n**VI. DAMAGES**\n---------------\n\n**A. Claimant\u2019s Position**\n--------------------------\n\n167.\n\nClaimant claims that it is entitled to damages equal to the sum of the unpaid invoices plus interest accruing from July 1999.\n\n168.\n\nOver the course of the Contract, SGS issued 35 invoices to Respondent. Respondent paid 10 of those invoices, leaving 25 unpaid. The total of the unpaid invoices is US$ 39,025,950.86.135\n\n*See* Lironi Statement, Annexes B and C.\n\n169.\n\nClaimant calculated interest by applying, on a simple rather than compound basis, the U.S. dollar 30-day LIBOR rate average for each month plus two percentage points, starting in July 1999. Claimant does not claim interest for any period prior to July 1999.136 Calculated in this manner, Claimant claims damages for interest in the amount of approximately USS 22.5 million through February 2011.137\n\n*See, e.g.,* Day 2 Tr. (Merits) atpp. 287-292.\n\nInterest Calculations as of 28 February 2011 and projected to 30 September 2011, prepared by M. K. Lironi, Ex. C-158.\n\n170.\n\nClaimant argues that LIBOR plus two percentage points is the appropriate interest rate \"[b]ecause, for companies like SGS, commercial borrowing is usually more expensive than the LIBOR rate, [and] it is SGS\u2019s practice in pre-shipment inspection contracts similar to the Contract to mark up the referenced LIBOR rate by 2 percentage points when calculating interest on overdue payments.\"138 Claimant also refers to a letter SGS submitted to the Ministry of Finance dated 16 September 1999, in which it noted that it would be charging interest at the rate of LIBOR plus two percentage points starting on 1 July 1999.139\n\nLironi Statement at para. 21.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Memorial at para. 214; Letter from SGS to Minister of Finance dated 16 September 1999, Ex. C-35.\n\n171.\n\nClaimant asserts that its position that interest should accrue from July 1999, the first month after the Contract was terminated, is consistent with Article 38(2) of the International Law Commission\u2019s (ILC) Articles on State Responsibility and the UNIDROIT Principles of International Commercial Contracts. Claimant argues that both documents suggest that interest should begin to accrue from the time when payment is due. Claimant notes Respondent\u2019s argument (discussed below) that, under Paraguayan law, interest should only begin to accrue on the date Claimant initiated arbitration. However, Claimant argues that the cases Respondent cites are inapposite as they do not deal with unpaid contractual obligations.140\n\nClaimant\u2019s Reply at para. 236, n. 361.\n\n172.\n\nClaimant also notes Respondent\u2019s argument that Claimant waited several years after termination of the Contract to initiate arbitration and should have mitigated its losses either by terminating the Contract once payments ceased or by initiating dispute settlement proceedings earlier. However, according to Claimant, \"[a]n injured party does not fail to \u2018mitigate\u2019 its losses by not commencing legal action to prevent interest from accruing, especially where, as here, the contention is merely that legal action (resort to courts in Paraguay) should have been commenced sooner than it ultimately was (this arbitration). Interest is not an independent head of damage, but an aspect of the full reparation due for a loss.\"141 Furthermore, Claimant argues, Claimant did not terminate the Contract because Respondent continued to promise to make payments.142\n\nClaimant\u2019s Reply at para. 231.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Reply at para. 232.\n\n173.\n\nFinally, Claimant notes Respondent\u2019s argument that Claimant is inappropriately availing itself of the arbitration process to insulate itself from the risks of investing in Paraguay. However, according to Claimant, \"Paraguay does not allege any lack of diligence on the part of SGS when entering into the Contract, and it sits ill in Paraguay\u2019s mouth to suggest that SGS should not have trusted its contractual counterparty, the Ministry of Finance, or relied on the representations of the President of Paraguay and the Minister of Justice.\"143\n\nClaimant\u2019s Reply at para. 233.\n\n**B. Respondent\u2019s Position**\n----------------------------\n\n174.\n\nRespondent does not dispute Claimant\u2019s mathematical calculations,144 but contests several of Claimant\u2019s underlying assumptions.145\n\n*See,* Day 2 Tr. (Merits) at p. 298:2-14.\n\n*See,* Day 1 Tr. (Merits) at pp. 102:19-105.\n\n175.\n\nFirst, Respondent argues that Claimant has not proven that any breach of Articles 4(1) and 4(2) of the BIT was the proximate cause of any damages Claimant may have suffered. Rather, Respondent argues, any damages were related solely to the alleged breach of the Contract.146 Respondent argues that \"if SGS was damaged in the amount of $60 million\u2014a claim Paraguay categorically rejects\u2014those damages are the consequence of Paraguay\u2019s supposed breach of the Contract, a dispute we argue can only be resolved in Paraguay\u2019s courts.\"147 As a result, according to Respondent, \"aside from the contractual losses, which SGS can recover only if it prevails on its Article 11 claim, SGS does not allege any losses arising from the violation of BIT provisions.\"148\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial at paras. 223-226; Respondent\u2019s Rejoinder at paras. 179-180.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial at para. 223.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial at para. 224.\n\n176.\n\nSecond, Respondent argues that Claimant is not entitled to damages for invoices associated with inspections on Mercosur imports and for damages associated with multiple invoices for single shipments.\n\n177.\n\nThird, Respondent notes that it has been hindered in its defense against Claimant\u2019s damages claims by the fact that it does not possess all of the Inspection Certificates.\n\n178.\n\nFourth, Respondent argues that Claimant is using the arbitration to insulate itself from the risks of investing in Paraguay, and that Claimant should have taken steps to mitigate any damages. Respondent argues that \"SGS willfully, or at least negligently, let the interest on the purported debt mount by failing to exercise its contractual right to recover the debt in local courts.\"149 Respondent also notes that Claimant let the damages continue to mount rather than terminate the arrangement in accordance with the terms of the Contract.150 At a minimum, Respondent asserts, Claimant should not be entitled to interest, particularly given the long delay in initiating dispute settlement proceedings. Respondent argues that its position is consistent with the ILC\u2019s Commentary to the Articles on State Responsibility, which state that \"failure to make a timely claim for payment is relevant in deciding whether to allow interest.\"151\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial at para. 234.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial at para. 236.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Rejoinder at para. 181.\n\n179.\n\nAlternatively, Respondent argues that Paraguayan law requires that interest accrue beginning only on the date Claimant initiated arbitration.152 Respondent furthermore asserts that Claimant\u2019s suggested interest rate is too high but does not suggest an alternative rate.153\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial at para. 239.\n\nDay 1 Tr. (Merits) at p. 105.\n\n**C. Tribunal\u2019s Analysis**\n--------------------------\n\n180.\n\nThe Tribunal concludes that Claimant is entitled to damages equal to the amount of the unpaid invoices plus interest accruing from July 1999. Respondent itself concedes that, if Claimant were to prevail on its Article 11 claim arising out of Respondent\u2019s breach of contract, then Claimant would be entitled to damages. The Tribunal has upheld that claim and damages are, therefore, appropriate.\n\n181.\n\nDifferent legal issues arise with respect to Claimant\u2019s claims for principal and interest, and the Tribunal shall address each category separately.\n\n182.\n\nWith respect to principal, the Tribunal finds that Claimant is entitled to the entire amount of the unpaid invoices totaling US$ 39,025,950.86. While Respondent argues that it has been prejudiced by the fact that it does not have copies of all of the underlying Inspection Certificates, Claimant has provided copies of the invoices,154 and Respondent has not provided evidence questioning their accuracy or authenticity. The Tribunal has also already rejected Respondent\u2019s argument that SGS improperly submitted invoices associated with inspections of Mercosur imports and issued multiple invoices for single shipments. As a result, no offset or deduction from the principal would be appropriate.\n\nSGS unpaid invoices with accompanying credit notes, Ex. C-143.\n\n183.\n\nWith respect to interest, whether or not interest awarded to compensate for the time value of money lost as a result of a wrongful failure to make a payment on the date due may be characterized as an independent head of damage, there can be no doubt that it is an essential component of full reparation. Nor can it be said that it would be in any way punitive or unfair to award interest given that Respondent has been in possession of the unpaid sums for several years and has presumably made use of those funds. If it had not been in possession of those funds, then it presumably would have had to borrow the money and been required to repay it with interest. It is fully appropriate, therefore, to apply interest to the principal awarded to Claimant.\n\n184.\n\nThe virtually universal principle of international law and international arbitration practice in the case of a delayed payment of monetary obligations due is to apply interest as of the date payment became due. This is clear, for example, from the ILC\u2019s Articles on State Responsibility.155 The Tribunal notes that here Claimant has adopted the conservative approach of requesting interest only as from July 1999, the date of contract termination, rather than from the date when each invoice became due.\n\nAccording to Article 38(2) of the ILC\u2019s Article on State Responsibility, \"Interest runs from the date when the principal sum should have been paid until the date the obligation to pay is fulfilled.\"\n\n185.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees with Claimant that the authorities Respondent cites for the proposition that Paraguayan law permits interest only from the date the claim is filed are inapposite in that they do not deal with contract claims. As noted, Respondent points to the statement in the Commentary to the Articles on State Responsibility that a \"failure to make a timely claim for payment is relevant in deciding whether to allow interest.\" However, the \"claim\" to which the Commentary refers is not the initiation of the dispute but the time when the injured party demanded payment.156 In this case, Claimant first demanded payment of its invoices during the life of the contract, and indicated in July 1999 that it would assess interest in the amount of LIBOR plus two percentage points. Claimant\u2019s claim for payment was clearly timely, indeed it was contemporaneous with Respondent\u2019s non-payment. The Tribunal concludes, therefore, that even were interest to run only from the date of demand for payment, rather than the date of non-payment, interest should begin to accrue in July 1999.\n\nThe relevant paragraph appears on p. 109, n. 619 of the Commentary (Ex. RL-48) and states:  \n Using the date of the breach as the starting date for calculation of the interest term is problematic as there may be difficulties in determining that date, and many legal systems require a demand for payment by the claimant before interest will run. The date of formal demand was taken as the relevant date in the *Russian Indemnity* case... by analogy from the general position in European legal systems. In any event, failure to make a timely claim for payment is relevant in deciding whether to allow interest.\n\n186.\n\nClaimant has requested simple interest based on the U.S. dollar 30-day LIBOR rate average (the \"LIBOR rate\") plus two percentage points.157 Claimant has explained this is the rate SGS typically charges on unpaid invoices.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that Claimant\u2019s spreadsheet showing its calculation of interest based on LIBOR plus two percentage points appears to contain an error for the applicable interest in June 2006. The spreadsheet shows an interest rate of 5.2455%, which appears to be the LIBOR rate rather than LIBOR plus two percentage points. Assuming that the applicable interest rate should have been LIBOR plus two percentage points, correcting the error would increase Claimant\u2019s claimed damages by approximately USS 100,000.\n\n187.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the Contract does not specify the amount of interest to be paid on unpaid amounts, and, in fact, does not refer to interest at all. Claimant\u2019s 16 September 1999 letter to the Ministry of Finance indicating that it would charge interest at the rate of LIBOR plus two percentage points was merely a unilateral statement of intent, which was neither accepted nor apparently even acknowledged by Respondent. Neither Respondent nor this Tribunal is bound by that rate.\n\n188.\n\nIn light of all the circumstances in this case, the Tribunal has concluded that it would be appropriate to apply the LIBOR rate plus one percentage point.\n\n**VII. COSTS**\n--------------\n\n189.\n\nClaimant seeks an award for costs based on Respondent\u2019s continuing refusal to pay the invoices and Respondent\u2019s failure to pay its share of the costs associated with this proceeding.158 On July 1, 2011, Claimant provided its Statement of Costs, in which it claimed US$ 1,792,605.95 in legal fees and US$ 1,121,180.55 in other costs and disbursements.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Memorial at para. 218.\n\n190.\n\nRespondent also seeks an award of legal fees and related expenses, travel and lodging costs, and the costs of the arbitration. Respondent argues that an award of costs and fees would be appropriate given that Claimant alleges only a breach of contract, which in Respondent\u2019s view is not actionable under the BIT, and such contract contains a forum selection clause that precludes arbitration.159 In its 1 July 2011 Statement of Costs, Respondent requested US$ 696,985.20 in fees and US$ 31,222.03 in costs.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Rejoinder at paras. 183-184.\n\n191.\n\nIn the absence of agreement of the parties with respect to the allocation of costs, Article 61(2) of the Convention authorizes the Tribunal to \"assess the expenses incurred by the parties in connection with the proceedings, and [to] decide how and by whom those expenses, the fees and expenses of the members of the Tribunal and the charges for the use of the facilities of the Centre shall be paid.\"\n\n192.\n\nThe Tribunal believes that both sides have presented their positions ably and in good faith, and neither has caused undue delay or expense in the proceeding. However, Respondent has not paid its portion of the costs associated with this proceeding, and has forced Claimant to bear the entire cost itself. The Tribunal finds that Respondent should pay its share, and, therefore, awards to Claimant half of the costs of the arbitration, i.e., the amount of the ICSID costs and fees that Respondent should have advanced. The Tribunal does not believe it is appropriate to make any other award with respect to costs and fees.\n\n**VIII. AWARD**\n---------------\n\n193.\n\nOn the basis of the foregoing, the Tribunal:\n\n194.\n\nFinds that Respondent has breached its obligations under Article 11 of the BIT by failing to guarantee the observance of the commitments it has entered into with respect to Claimant\u2019s investment;\n\n195.\n\nFinds that it does not need to resolve Claimant\u2019s claim that Respondent\u2019s failure to fulfill its alleged extra-contractual promises of payment constituted an additional breach of Article 11 of the BIT because (i) those claims ultimately derive from the same set of facts and commitments that gave rise to the Tribunal\u2019s conclusion that Respondent breached Article 11 of the BIT by failing to guarantee the observance of the contractual commitments it has entered into with respect to Claimant and (ii) even if the Tribunal were to find an additional breach of the BIT due to Respondent\u2019s alleged failure to fulfill its extra-contractual promises, the finding would not affect the quantum of damages;\n\n196.\n\nFinds that it does not need to resolve Claimant\u2019s claims that Respondent breached Articles 4(1) and 4(2) of the BIT because (i) such claims ultimately derive from the same set of facts and contractual commitments that gave rise to the Tribunal\u2019s conclusion that Respondent breached Article 11 of the BIT by failing to guarantee the observance of the contractual commitments it has entered into with respect to Claimant\u2019s investment and (ii) even if the Tribunal were to find an additional breach of Articles 4(1) and 4(2) of the BIT, the finding would not affect the quantum of damages;\n\n197.\n\nAwards Claimant US$ 39,025,950.86 plus interest at the U.S. dollar 30-day LIBOR rate average plus one percentage point beginning on 1 July 1999 until the date of payment; and\n\n198.\n\nAwards Claimant one-half of the amount of US$ 673,923.28, which is the total amount of the costs of the arbitration."}, {"Title": "Decision on Paraguay's Request for the Continued Stay of Enforcement of the Award", "Type": "Stay of Enforcement", "Date": "2013-03-22T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Decision on Paraguay's Request for the Continued Stay of Enforcement of the Award\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**GLOSSARY**\n------------\n\nAward: Award rendered by the Arbitral Tribunal on February 10, 2012.\n\nBIT: Agreement between the Republic of Paraguay and the Swiss Confederation on the Promotion and Reciprocal Protection of Investments, entered into on January 31, 1992 and in force and effect since September 28, 1992.\n\nICSID Arbitration Rules: Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings.\n\nICSID or Centre: International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes.\n\nICSID Convention: Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States.\n\nICSID Financial Regulations: ICSID Administrative and Financial Regulations.\n\nSGS: SGS Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale de Surveillance S.A.\n\n**I. PROCEDURAL HISTORY**\n-------------------------\n\n1.\n\nOn February 10, 2012, the Tribunal in the original arbitration proceeding presided by Dr. Stanimir A. Alexandrov (Bulgarian), appointed by the Chairman of the Administrative Council of the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes, and also comprising Mr. Donald Francis Donovan (U.S.A.), appointed by SGS, and Dr. Pablo Garc\u00eda Mexia (Spanish), appointed by the Republic of Paraguay, rendered an Award partially upholding SGS\u2019s claims and awarding it US$39,025,950.86, plus simple interest as compensation. The Tribunal concluded that Paraguay had breached its obligation, under Article 11 of the 1992 Agreement on the Promotion and Reciprocal Protection of Investments between Switzerland and Paraguay, to guarantee the observance of the commitments it had entered into with respect to SGS\u2019s investment.\n\n2.\n\nThe Tribunal also found that it did not need to resolve SGS\u2019s claims that (i) Paraguay\u2019s failure to fulfill its alleged extra-contractual promises of payment constituted an additional breach of Article 11 of the BIT; and that (ii) Paraguay had breached Articles 4(1) and 4(2) of the BIT, by taking undue and discriminatory measures and by denying fair and equitable treatment. According to the Tribunal, such claims ultimately derived from the same set of facts and contractual commitments that gave rise to the Tribunal\u2019s conclusion that Respondent had breached Article 11 of the BIT, and because in any event a further finding in favor of SGS would not affect the quantum of damages.\n\n3.\n\nOn June 7, 2012, ICSID received from the Republic of Paraguay an application for annulment and a request for stay of the enforcement of the Award.\n\n4.\n\nOn June 8, 2012, pursuant to Rule 50(2) (a) and (b) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules, the Secretary-General of ICSID registered the Application and notified the Parties of the provisional stay of enforcement of the Award, pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule 54(2).\n\n5.\n\nBy letter of June 25, 2012, in accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 54(2), SGS requested that the Committee rule, within 30 days of the date of its constitution, on whether the provisional stay of enforcement of the Award should be continued. SGS expressed its opposition to a continued stay of enforcement and requested that Paraguay be ordered to post a bond in the event that the Committee should decide to continue such stay.\n\n6.\n\nOn July 27, 2012, the Secretary-General, in accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 6(1), notified the Parties that the three members of the **ad hoc** Committee had accepted their appointments and that the Committee was therefore deemed to have been constituted on that date. The **ad hoc** Committee was composed of Mr. Rodrigo Oreamuno, a national of Costa Rica, President of the Committee; Dr. Eduardo Zuleta, a national of Colombia; and Mr. Salim Moollan, a national of Mauritius and France. Ms. Mercedes Cordido-Freytes de Kurowski, ICSID Legal Counsel, was designated to serve as Secretary of the Committee.\n\n7.\n\nOn July 30, 2012, pursuant to Regulation 14(3) (e) of the ICSID Administrative and Financial Regulations, the Centre requested that the Republic of Paraguay make a first advance payment of US$200,000 (two hundred thousand United States dollars) within thirty (30) days to cover the initial costs of the annulment proceedings, including the First Session of the Committee.\n\n8.\n\nBy letter of August 8, 2012, the Committee invited the Parties to file written observations on the request for continued stay of enforcement prior to the First Session. The Republic of Paraguay was invited to file its observations by August 14, 2012 and SGS by August 20, 2012.\n\n9.\n\nOn the same date and pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule 54(2), the Committee extended the provisional stay of the enforcement of Award until it had heard the Parties and reached a final determination on the continuation of the stay.\n\n10.\n\nOn August 14, 2012, the Committee confirmed that, as agreed by the Parties, the First Session would be held on August 31, 2012, at the seat of the Centre in Washington, DC.\n\n11.\n\nAs scheduled, on August 14, 2012, the Republic of Paraguay filed its \"Observations in Support of its Request for a Continued Stay of the Award\".\n\n12.\n\nOn August 20, 2012, the Republic of Paraguay informed that it would not be able to make the requested advance payment in time for the First Session, acknowledging that in such circumstances it might no longer be possible to hold the First Session on August 31, 2012. As a result, the Republic of Paraguay waived the requirement of ICSID Arbitration Rule 13(1) that the Committee hold its First Session within 60 days after its constitution.\n\n13.\n\nAs scheduled, on August 20, 2012, SGS filed its response to the Observations by the Republic of Paraguay in Support of its Request for a Continued Stay of the Award.\n\n14.\n\nOn August 21, 2012, the Committee informed the Parties that in view of Paraguay\u2019s message of August 20, 2012, the First Session was canceled. SGS was invited to agree to the Committee holding the First Session after the 60-day period prescribed in ICSID Arbitration Rules 13(1) and 53.\n\n15.\n\nOn August 21, 2012, SGS gave its consent to the Committee holding its First Session after the 60-day period prescribed in the ICSID Arbitration Rules. SGS also requested that, if payment had not been received by August 26, 2012, the Committee confirm in writing that the provisional stay of the Award should be lifted.\n\n16.\n\nOn August 23, 2012, the Committee, referring to the Parties\u2019 recent submissions on the stay of enforcement, indicated that it would like to hear the Parties\u2019 oral presentations on this matter before reaching a decision.\n\n17.\n\nBy letters of August 23 and 24, 2012, the Parties expressed their positions on whether or not the stay of enforcement should expire on August 26, 2012.\n\n18.\n\nOn August 24, 2012, the Committee informed the Parties about its decision to continue the stay of enforcement until September 17, 2012, when it would automatically be terminated should the Centre not have received Paraguay\u2019s payment.\n\n19.\n\nOn August 30, 2012, the Committee confirmed that, as agreed by the Parties, the First Session would be held on October 29, 2012, provided that Paraguay pay the first advance by September 17, 2012.\n\n20.\n\nOn September 14, 2012, the Centre acknowledged receipt of Paraguay\u2019s payment and the Committee confirmed that the First Session and hearing on the stay of enforcement would be held on October 29, 2012, at the seat of the Centre in Washington, D.C.\n\n21.\n\nOn October 27, 2012, the Committee informed the Parties that in view of the fact that a hurricane was expected to affect the Washington D.C. area and cause major disruptions in the East Coast of the United States, the First Session would be held on October 29, 2012 by telephone conference and not in person. The hearing about the stay of enforcement was therefore canceled and the Parties were directed to make their presentations in writing by November 2, 2012.\n\n22.\n\nThe Committee held its First Session with the Parties on October 29, 2012 by telephone conference. The Parties confirmed that the Members of the Committee had been validly appointed. It was agreed *inter alia* that the applicable Arbitration Rules would be those in effect from April 10, 2006, that the procedural languages would be English and Spanish and that the place of the proceeding would be Washington D.C. In the absence of an agreement between the Parties, the Committee fixed a schedule for the submissions of pleadings on the application for annulment. The agreements of the Parties and the schedule for the submissions were embodied in Procedural Order No. 1, dated November 13, 2012, signed by the President and circulated to the Parties.\n\n23.\n\nOn November 7, 2012, each Party filed further presentations about SGS\u2019s request to terminate the stay of enforcement of the Award. The original deadline had to be postponed, as agreed by the Parties, because of the serious disruptions that hurricane Sandy caused in New York, which affected the ability of Paraguay\u2019s counsel to respond.\n\n24.\n\nOn November 14, 2012, following the resignation of the *ad hoc* Committee member Salim Moollan, the Secretary-General notified the Parties of the vacancy on the *ad hoc* Committee and the proceeding was suspended pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rules 53 and 10(2).\n\n25.\n\nOn November 26, 2012, after consulting with the Parties, the Chairman of the ICSID Administrative Council appointed Judge Abdulqawi A. Yusuf, a national of Somalia, to the *ad hoc* Committee to fill the vacancy caused by Mr. Salim Moollan\u2019s resignation.\n\n26.\n\nOn November 29, 2012, following Judge Yusufs acceptance of his appointment, the *ad hoc* Committee was reconstituted and the proceeding was resumed pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rules 53 and 12.\n\n27.\n\nThe Members of the Committee have deliberated by various means of communication and have taken into consideration the Parties\u2019 entire submissions on the matter.\n\n**II. THE PARTIES\u2019 POSITIONS CONCERNING THE STAY OF ENFORCEMENT OF THE AWARD**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**A. Paraguay\u2019s Position**\n--------------------------\n\n28.\n\nBy means of a written submission filed on June 7, 2012, pursuant to Article 52(5) of the ICSID Convention and Rule 54 of ICSID Arbitration Rules, the Republic of Paraguay requested that the enforcement of the Award issued on 10 February 2012 be stayed until the Committee renders a decision on the application for annulment thereof.\n\n29.\n\nParaguay stated that strong grounds for the annulment of the Award existed and that it did not request such annulment and the stay of enforcement of the award simply to delay payment.1\n\nParaguay\u2019s Application for Annulment, June 7, 2012, \u00b670.\n\n30.\n\nIn support of its request for a continued stay of enforcement of the Award, Paraguay stated that:\n\n(a) Its application for annulment of the award is substantial.\n\n(b) It is not a dilatory tactic.\n\n(c) The continued stay of enforcement of the award does not prejudice SGS.\n\n(d) No bond or guarantee is necessary as mounting interest on the award and Paraguay\u2019s obligations under the ICSID Convention suffice to protect SGS\u2019s right to payment if the annulment were denied.2\n\nParaguay's Written Submission of August 14, 2012, \u00b63.\n\n31.\n\nFurthermore, Paraguay maintained that annulment committees have routinely and consistently stayed awards pending a decision on annulment, provided that they are satisfied that the annulment petition is not merely dilatory. Quoting *Azurix v. Argentina,* Paraguay highlighted that a stay should be granted absent exceptional circumstances.3\n\nId., \u00b6 9.\n\n32.\n\nAccording to Paraguay, \"[a] stay pending a decision on annulment makes eminent practical sense: if the stay is lifted, Paraguay will face the prospect of having to pay the Award before a decision on annulment is rendered, and then seek to recover the money if the Award is annulled. It is far more efficient to await a final determination of the Parties\u2019 obligations\"4\n\nId., \u00b6 10.\n\n33.\n\nIn addition, Paraguay pointed out that the delay that SGS may encounter in recovering on the Award \"... is incidental to the Convention system of annulment, which permits stays of enforcement pending annulment proceedings\".5 It went on to cite *Enron v. Argentina* as follows: \"... the postponement of the right to payment of the award caused by a stay cannot, by definition, *per se* constitute prejudice\"6. It added that SGS is not a struggling enterprise that needs to recover on the Award as soon as possible but a multinational company with more than 70,000 employees that recorded US$4.93 billion in revenue for 2011.7\n\nId., \u00b6\u00b6 14 and 15.\n\nId.\n\nId.\n\n34.\n\nIn its written submission of November 7, 2012, Paraguay requested once again that the stay of enforcement of the Award be continued, without conditions.8 It highlighted that, according to the \"Background Paper on Annulment for the Administrative Council of ICSID\" of August 2012, *ad hoc* committees have never declined to continue the stay of enforcement of an award and that there is no reason for this case to be the first exception.9\n\nParaguay's Written Submission of November 7, 2012, \u00b62.\n\nId.,\u00b64.\n\n35.\n\nParaguay insisted that there are several reasons why the Committee should continue the stay of enforcement of the Award:\n\n(a) SGS will be sufficiently compensated for any delay in the enforcement of the Award by the continued accrual of interest. In Paraguay's opinion, even if it were not to prevail, SGS would be in the same economic position as it is in now.\n\n(b) Paraguay has no history of non-compliance with international awards and has paid the amount determined by the Tribunal in the only award issued against it.\n\n(c) No exceptional circumstances exist that would require Paraguay to provide security in order to continue the stay of enforcement of the award.\n\n(d) Paraguay\u2019s application for annulment is not dilatory.10\n\nId., \u00b6 5.\n\n36.\n\nParaguay cited *MTD v. Chile, Vivendi v. Argentina* and *Libananco v. Turkey* in support of its position whereby SGS may not use this annulment proceeding to improve the interest awarded thereto. It reiterated that the simple interest awarded is sufficient to compensate SGS for the delay in the event that Paraguay\u2019s application for annulment of the Award was denied.11\n\nId. \u00b6\u00b6 7-10.\n\n37.\n\nParaguay denied having a history of non-compliance with international obligations and non-payment of awards. It explained that it had recently been involved in two international arbitrations and that in the proceeding instituted by Grupanor Cercampo S.A. Paraguay paid the award, whereas in the *BIVAC* case, the Tribunal concluded that Paraguay had not breached the relevant treaty.12\n\nId. \u00b6\u00b6 11 and 12.\n\n38.\n\nParaguay claimed that:\n\n\"[t]here is no indication, past or present, that Paraguay will not enforce the Award should its annulment request fail.\n\nParaguay is in full compliance with Article 69 of the ICSID Convention. It has passed Law No. 944/1982, which incorporated the ICSID Convention into Paraguayan law.\n\nMoreover, Article 536 of the Paraguayan Code of Civil Procedure establishes that international arbitral awards shall have full force and effect in accordance with the terms of the treaties under which they are rendered\".13\n\nId., \u00b6 14.\n\n39.\n\nParaguay insisted that its application for annulment is not dilatory. It also pointed out that in *SGS v. Philippines* and *SGS v. Pakistan,* both based on the umbrella clause, the Tribunal declared that it lacked jurisdiction *(SGS v. Pakistan)* or that the claim was inadmissible *(SGS v. Philippines).* According to Paraguay the Award represents a grave abuse of power and an intrusion in the realm of negotiated contracts.14\n\nId., \u00b6\u00b6 15-19.\n\n40.\n\nParaguay summarized its viewpoint in the following manner:\n\n\"As the *ad hoc* committee in *Mitchell v. Congo* explained, \u2018in a different field but with the same \u2018raison d\u2019\u00eatre\u2019, stay of enforcement pending an appeal from a judicial decision is, according to several national laws, almost automatic\u2019\".15\n\nParaguay\u2019s Written Submission of August 14, 2012, \u00b6 10.\n\n**B. SGS\u2019s Position**\n---------------------\n\n41.\n\nSGS disagrees with Paraguay as far as the continued stay of enforcement of the award is concerned. It contests Paraguay\u2019s suggestions that \"... a stay of enforcement is almost automatic and should be granted absent \u2018very exceptional circumstances\u2019\" and that, in the present case, there are \"no exceptional circumstances [that] warrant denying a stay\". According to SGS, Paraguay misstates the applicable standard. Under the plain language of the ICSID Convention, awards are immediately binding and a stay of enforcement is the exception\".16\n\nSGS\u2019s Written Submission of August 20, 2012,\u00b6\u00b6 11 and 12.\n\n42.\n\nBy citing, *Compania de Aguas del Aconquija S.A. and Vivendi Universal S.A. v. Argentina,* and *Kardassopoulos and Fuchs v. Georgia,* among others, SGS argued that \"[consistent with the plain meaning of the ICSID Convention, *ad hoc* committees have recognized that there is no automatic right to a stay and that a stay is a remedy of an \u2018exceptional nature\u2019\".17\n\nId., \u00b6 14.\n\n43.\n\nSGS also contested Paraguay's allegation that the stay of enforcement of the Award would not prejudice SGS, and asserted that:\n\n\"[s]imple interest at LIBOR + 1% (as was awarded by the Tribunal) does not constitute adequate compensation for the time value of money. The unchallenged evidence, at the hearing below, by SGS\u2019s Vice President, Finance and Administration (Governments and Institutions Services Division), Michael Lironi, was that interest even at LIBOR + 2% was below SGS\u2019s \u2018actual cost of borrowing\u2019. SGS would suffer a further prejudice if Paraguay - as it has done with respect to the 2005 judgment of the Swiss Federal Tribunal -were to reorganize or conceal its foreign assets so as to make itself judgment proof\u2019.18\n\nId., \u00b6 18.\n\n44.\n\nIn response to Paraguay\u2019s second argument that its application is not dilatory SGS contended that \"[e]ven if one accepts that Paraguay is exercising in good faith its right to seek annulment, that cannot justify a stay of enforcement... An applicant cannot be entitled to receive the benefit of a stay of enforcement merely because it acted as it was expected to\".19\n\nId., \u00b6 21.\n\n45.\n\nSGS stated that it had doubts as to Paraguay\u2019s intent to comply with the Award and whether or not the application for annulment is a dilatory tactic.20\n\nId., \u00b6 22.\n\n46.\n\nSGS cited Professor Schreuer, asserting that \"[a]nnulment is only concerned with the legitimacy of the process of decision [in the arbitration]: it is not concerned with its substantive correctness\", and that the application for annulment should allege \"... defects that go far beyond \u2018mere errors of fact or law\u2019 and, if proved, would indeed justify annulment\".21 SGS added that \"... Paraguay alleges no procedural vice or impropriety. Instead, the essence of Paraguay's Annulment Application is a disagreement with the Tribunal's interpretation of the umbrella clause of the BIT and its application of the dispute resolution provision of the BIT\".22 SGS concluded that: \"Paraguay's Annulment Application therefore facially has no basis under the ICSID Convention\".23\n\nId., \u00b6 27.\n\nId., \u00b6 28.\n\nId., \u00b6 30.\n\n**III. THE PARTIES\u2019 POSITIONS CONCERNING THE PROSPECTIVE REQUIREMENT THAT A BOND BE POSTED FOR THE CONTINUED STAY OF ENFORCEMENT OF THE AWARD**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**A. Paraguay\u2019s Position**\n--------------------------\n\n47.\n\nAccording to Paraguay, the stay of enforcement of the Award should be continued without the requirement of a bond. There is no requirement in the ICSID Convention or the Arbitration Rules whereby a party must provide security in order to continue a stay.24\n\nParaguay\u2019s Written Submission of August 14, 2012, \u00b6 16.\n\n48.\n\nParaguay pointed out that many committees have held that no bond should be required unless there is evidence that the State would not comply with its obligations if annulment were to be denied.25\n\nId., \u00b6 17.\n\n49.\n\nParaguay highlighted that SGS has been unable to establish circumstances creating doubt that Paraguay would comply with the Award should the annulment application be denied. It also insisted that Paraguay has no history of non-payment under the ICSID Convention.26\n\nId., \u00b6 19.\n\n50.\n\nFurthermore, Paraguay asserted that requiring security would put SGS in a better position, would penalize Paraguay for exercising its rights under the ICSID Convention, and would create a disincentive for developing countries to submit applications for annulment.27\n\nParaguay's Written Submission of November 7, 2012, \u00b6 5\n\n51.\n\nBy citing *CMS v. Argentina,* Paraguay concluded that several *ad hoc* committees have adopted the interpretation that a bank guarantee represents a windfall for the respondent in an annulment proceeding.28\n\nId., \u00b6 22.\n\n**B. SGS\u2019s Position**\n---------------------\n\n52.\n\nSGS stated that if the Committee were to accept Paraguay\u2019s request for a continued stay of enforcement of the Award, it should require that Paraguay post security for the full amount of the Award, plus interest.\n\n53.\n\nSGS pointed out that Paraguay owes over US$39 million that it promised to pay on several occasions but failed to do so.29 Moreover, it stated that \"Paraguay repeatedly failed to pay its share of the advances on costs requested by ICSID, with the result that SGS was forced to bear the entire costs of the arbitration proceedings\".30 SGS asserted that, in addition to the amount owed to SGS, Paraguay also owes BIVAC, (SGS\u2019s competitor), approximately US$36.1 million.31 SGS added that there is another case against Paraguay before the Swiss Federal Tribunal and that Paraguay has openly declared that it will not honor such debt.32\n\nSGS's Written Submission of August 20, 2012, \u00b6 5.\n\nId., \u00b6 7.\n\nId., \u00b6 8.\n\nId., \u00b6 9.\n\n54.\n\nAfter citing the *Libananco* and *Kardassopoulos* cases, SGS asserted that \"... many committees have ordered the provision of security as the necessary and natural *quid pro quo* for a continuation of a stay of enforcement and have not required any further showing of special circumstances. Even if this Committee were minded to require a positive showing by SGS (which it does not need to)... there are circumstances that justify the provision of security in the present case\".33\n\nId., \u00b6 34.\n\n55.\n\nSGS pointed out that Paraguay \"... nowhere suggests that it is unable to pay the Award in full immediately or would suffer economic hardship if required to do so. Paraguay merely contends that it would be \u2018far more efficient\u2019 for it to pay the Award only after the Committee renders its decision..,\"34\n\nId., \u00b6 35.\n\n56.\n\nSGS stated that, in ICSID cases, the parties have the joint obligation to make an advance payment to cover the costs of the proceedings. It also added that \"Paraguay violated that obligation, in a sustained fashion over the three years that the case below was pending, until Paraguay cynically paid its share of the costs on the day it filed this annulment proceeding\".35\n\nId., \u00b6 38.\n\n57.\n\nMoreover, SGS asserted that \"Paraguay has not designated any court or other authority, in accordance with Article 54(2), for the recognition and enforcement of ICSID arbitral awards. Nor has Paraguay identified to ICSID any legislative or other measures taken, pursuant to Article 69 of the Convention, to make the Convention effective in its territory\".36\n\nId., \u00b6 39.\n\n58.\n\nBased on *Repsol* and the statements made by Professor Schreuer, SGS asserted that \"[t]he requirement of security serves as an important deterrent against \u2018automatic\u2019 annulment applications\".37\n\nId. \u00b6\u00b6 42 and 43.\n\n59.\n\nAfter pointing out that it had been trying to cause Paraguay to pay the amounts owed thereto for over 15 years, SGS stated that such sole reason would suffice for the Committee to order Paraguay to post a bond or other security as a condition precedent to continuing the stay of enforcement of the Award.38\n\nId., \u00b645.\n\n60.\n\nSGS requested that the provisional stay of enforcement of the Award be lifted, and, in the alternative, that is to say, in the event that the Committee decided to continue such stay, the Committee order that, within the term of thirty days as from the date of issuance of the decision, Paraguay \"... post security in the form of an unconditional and irrevocable bank guarantee or standby letter of credit with a reputable international bank headquartered in Western Europe or North America for the full amount of the Award (including interest to the date of the Committee\u2019s order, plus 30 days) or in such other form and amount as may be determined by the Committee\". In addition, it requested that the Committee order \"... that the security so provided be collectible by SGS in full and on first demand if Paraguay\u2019s Annulment Application is rejected, or in the event of partial annulment, partially collectible by SGS in the remaining amount of the Award rendered in its favor\".39 Lastly, it concluded that \"... if Paraguay fails to provide the security so ordered within 30 days or defaults in paying any other amount required by ICSID to be paid in the course of Paraguay\u2019s Annulment Application (including the costs of ICSID and/or the costs of the Committee), the stay of enforcement of the Award shall be terminated...\"40\n\nId., \u00b6 49.\n\nId.\n\n61.\n\nIn its written submission of November 7, 2012, SGS stated that there are three circumstances that warrant the prospective requirement to provide security in the case at issue here:\n\n(a) Posting a bond would not prejudice Paraguay. In such regard, it asserted that \"Paraguay does not and cannot say that it would suffer economic hardship if required to post a bond. Nor would Paraguay suffer any harm if the Award were annulled. In such circumstance, the bond would simply be rescinded, thereby fully addressing Paraguay\u2019s stated concern about efficiency\"41\n\n(b) The Committee would safeguard the integrity of the ICSID system and ensure that Paraguay honor its obligations under the ICSID Convention. In connection therewith, SGS stated that \"[t]he Committee will have noted that Paraguay nowhere undertakes to comply with the Award should the Committee reject its application for annulment. (In any event, assurances would have little value given the history of broken promises by Paraguay to pay SGS.) Paraguay\u2019s failure even to undertake to comply with the Award comes on top of a record of defiance by Paraguay of its ICSID obligations - Paraguay paid its share of the arbitration costs below only after it decided to commence these annulment proceedings - and evidence of attempts by Paraguay to make itself judgment-proof and frustrate enforcement of a Swiss court judgment rendered in favor of European banks. By ordering a bond, this Committee would prevent this case from becoming another black mark for the ICSID system of a dishonored award\"42\n\n(c) The nature of the application for annulment submitted by Paraguay warrants a bond or other security. SGS asserts that the Committee should determine whether or not the application for annulment is dilatory. In the words of SGS, \"...Paraguay\u2019s application is a disagreement about treaty interpretation. Paraguay does not allege procedural vice, due process violation or unfairness. The core issue raised by Paraguay is a disagreement with the Tribunal about the proper interpretation of the dispute resolution clause of the BIT in light of the forum selection clause in the underlying contract\"43\n\nSGS's Written Submission of November 7, 2012, page 3.\n\nId., page 3.\n\nId., page 3.\n\n62.\n\nSGS added that in *Kardassopoulos v. Georgia* the Committee ordered Georgia to post a bond in circumstances similar to these. According to SGS \"... in that case the key consideration was Georgia's protracted history of broken promises to compensate the investor. That history (12 years) was shorter than ours (15 years)\"44. SGS also cited Lemire v. Ukraine where the Committee ordered Ukraine to post security on the basis of Ukraine's poor record of non-compliance with its international obligations45 In contrast, SGS referred to the fact that, in two cases against Chile *(Pey Casado* and *MTD),* the Committees did not order the posting of a bond. This fact \"... could point to a spotless record of compliance with its international payment obligations\"46 SGS also stated: that the Committee in *Pey Casado* considered \"...that Chile\u2019s \u2018faithfulness and utmost seriousness\u2019 in complying with its international commitments and duties \u2018should itself constitute a sufficient assurance\u2019 of future compliance\".47 In *MTD* the Tribunal pointed out that \"... Chile \u2018has always complied with its International payment obligations and with all judgments or awards of international courts and tribunals\u2019\".48\n\nId. pages 3 and 4.\n\nId., pages 3 and 4.\n\nId., page 4.\n\nId., page 4.\n\nId., page 5.\n\n63.\n\nThe Committee will now proceed to analyze the Parties\u2019 written submissions and to adopt a decision on the request submitted by Paraguay. Before doing so, it will, however, examine recent facts that have been brought to its attention in connection with the request for continued stay of enforcement of the Award.\n\n**IV. RECENT FACTS**\n--------------------\n\n64.\n\nOn January 15, 2013, SGS sent a letter to the Committee stating that Paraguay had issued a \"preliminary offering circular\" (the \"Offering\") for a bond issuance that it would circulate through investment bankers and international law firms.\n\n65.\n\nThe Committee examined the Offering carefully and was able to verify that, as SGS stated, Paraguay had actually made reference to the Award holding it liable to pay SGS approximately US$39 million, plus interest thereon.\n\n66.\n\nIn its letter of January 15, 2013, SGS added that, on account of the stay of enforcement of the Award, it was disabled from attaching, *even provisionally,* the monies that would flow through the New York banking system in connection with the bond issuance.\n\n67.\n\nMoreover, SGS pointed out that, on page 10 of the Offering, Paraguay had made reference to the possibility of SGS, or any other creditor mentioned in the Offering, attaching part of the proceeds of the bond placement.\n\n68.\n\nOn page 10 of the Offering, Paraguay listed the following outstanding credits:\n\nCreditor Approx. Amount Arbitral Tribunal or Court\n\nNine Banks US$85,000,000 plus interest Swiss Federal Tribunal\n\nSGS US$39,000,000 plus interest ICSID Arbitral Tribunal\n\nBIVAC US$36,000,000 ICSID Arbitral Tribunal and Paraguayan Courts.\n\n69.\n\nOn pages 9 and 10 of its Offering, Paraguay included the two following paragraphs:\n\n***Part of the offering proceeds could be attached by creditors to satisfy outstanding and pending judgments and awards against Paraguay.***\n\nCreditors holding outstanding court judgments or arbitral awards present a risk of disruption to the offering. The risk with respect to the offering is that the initial purchasers in the offering could be said to have an obligation to pay money to Paraguay and Paraguay\u2019s judgment creditors may attempt to restrain Paraguay\u2019s interest in any such obligation. Further, Paraguay\u2019s creditors could attempt to attach the proceeds of the offering\".49\n\nPreliminary Offering Circular, Republic of Paraguay, evidence submitted by SGS on January 15, 2013, pages 9 and 10.\n\n70.\n\nIn its letter of January 15 referred to *supra,* SGS requested that this \"... Committee lift with immediate effect the provisional stay of enforcement\" of the Award. SGS concluded its letter stating that \"[t]his may be the last opportunity that SGS will have to force Paraguay to respect its ICSID obligations by attaching monies due to SGS under the ICSID Award\".50\n\nSGS\u2019s Letter of January 15, 2013, pages 1 and 2.\n\n71.\n\nOn the same day, the Committee invited the Republic of Paraguay to address SGS\u2019s request on or prior to January 18, 2013.\n\n72.\n\nBefore receiving Paraguay\u2019s response, the Committee received another communication from SGS dated January 17, whereby it stated that, \"as a matter of urgency\", it addressed it directly to the Committee. In this second letter, SGS requested the following provisional measures:\n\n\"... as a matter of urgency and in accordance with its powers under Article 39(1) of the Rules, the Committee order that Paraguay direct its agents - including Citigroup and its affiliates (as Global Coordinator, Joint Book-Runner, Trustee, Principal Paying Agent, Transfer Agent and Registrar of the Offering), Bank of America Merrill Lynch (as Joint Book-Runner of the Offering) and any other financial institutions involved in the Offering - to place the proceeds of the Offering (up to the amount of the ICSID Award plus interest) in an interest-bearing trust account with Citigroup in New York pending the Committee\u2019s decision on the Parties\u2019 respective requests regarding the stay of enforcement\".51\n\nSGS's Letter of January 17, 2013, pages 1 and 2.\n\n73.\n\nOn January 18, 2013, the Committee received Paraguay\u2019s answer to SGS\u2019 letter. In this reply, Paraguay:\n\n(a) Stated that, \"... although it is true that Paraguay is raising funds on the international debt markets... this fact does nothing to change the debate over continuation of the stay of enforcement of the Award..,\".52\n\n(b) Stated once again that since no *ad hoc* committee has declined to continue the stay enforcement of an award, such stay should be continued pending the Committee\u2019s final decision in the context of this annulment proceeding.53\n\n(c) Submitted a copy of the special power granted by the President of the Republic of Paraguay to the Attorney General \"... to provide a sworn commitment before the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID), in the name and in representation of the Paraguayan State, [in] the litigation Societe Generale de Surveillance S.A. (S.G.S.) against the Republic of Paraguay, No. ARB/07/29...\".54\n\nParaguay\u2019s Letter of January 18, 2013, page 1.\n\nId., page 1.\n\nDecree No. 9949 of October 24, 2012, submitted by Paraguay on January 18, 2013.\n\n74.\n\nBy means of a further communication dated January 24, 2013, Paraguay strongly opposed the provisional measure requested by SGS and referred to in paragraph 72 *supra,* arguing that such measure would negatively affect the actions it is undertaking in order to raise funds in international capital markets.\n\n75.\n\nOn January 25, 2013, SGS sent a letter to the Committee in which it withdrew the request for provisional relief that it had made in its January 17 letter. It stated that:\n\n(a) \"For the avoidance of doubt, such withdrawal does not entail acceptance by SGS of the arguments raised in Paraguay\u2019s letter of 24 January 2013...\".55\n\n(b) \"... Paraguay had hitherto offered *no* assurances that it intended to comply with the Award should this Committee reject its annulment application\".56\n\n(c) \"The decree that authorizes Paraguay to offer assurances was issued on 24 October 2012...\" but Paraguay preferred to keep it in reserve and it was not until it \"... was faced with the prospect of seeing the proceeds of its first sovereign bond offering seized that Paraguay undertook to represent to this Committee that it intended to comply with the Award\".57\n\n(d) \"... Paraguay *anticipated future enforcement actions* and specified that \"any action taken to enforce... the SGS Award\" would not be regarded as an event of default under the bonds\".58\n\n(e) \"SGS maintains its request that the Committee not extend the provisional stay of enforcement or, alternatively, order Paraguay to provide financial security for the full amount of the Award with interest\".59\n\nSGS\u2019s Letter of January 25, 2013, page 1.\n\nId., page 2.\n\nId., page 2.\n\nId., page 2.\n\nId., page 3.\n\n76.\n\nOn January 30, Paraguay sent its reply to SGS\u2019s January 25th letter. With respect to Decree 9949, it stated:\n\n\"SGS\u2019s unfounded speculation about the timing of the letter cannot detract from the fact that Paraguay has conveyed its assurances that it will pay the Award if it is not annulled. As Paraguay has already pointed out, annulment committees routinely accept such assurances to support extending provisional stays\".60\n\nParaguay\u2019s Letter of January 30, 2013, page 2.\n\n77.\n\nIn that response Paraguay stated that the Offering \"... does not purport to state a government policy that an enforcement action will be required to enforce the Award\".61 It also reiterated its request that the stay of the Award be extended.\n\nId., page 2.\n\n**V. ANALYSIS OF THE** ***AD HOC*** **COMMITTEE**\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n**A. Annulment Regime Under ICSID**\n-----------------------------------\n\n78.\n\nBefore analyzing the arguments of the Parties, the Committee considers it important to refer to Article 52(5) of the ICSID Convention which reads as follows:\n\n\"The Committee may, if it considers that the circumstances so require, stay enforcement of the award pending its decision. If the applicant requests a stay of enforcement of the award in his application, enforcement shall be stayed provisionally until the Committee rules on such request\".\n\n79.\n\nRule 54 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules provides the following:\n\n\"Stay of Enforcement of the Award\n\n(1) The party applying for the interpretation, revision or annulment of an award may in its application, and either party may at any time before the final disposition of the application, request a stay in the enforcement of part or all of the award to which the application relates. The Tribunal or Committee shall give priority to the consideration of such a request.\n\n(2) If an application for the revision or annulment of an award contains a request for a stay of its enforcement, the Secretary-General shall, together with the notice of registration, inform both parties of the provisional stay of the award. As soon as the Tribunal or Committee is constituted it shall, if either party requests, rule within 30 days on whether such stay should be continued; unless it decides to continue the stay, it shall automatically be terminated.\n\n(3) If a stay of enforcement has been granted pursuant to paragraph (1) or continued pursuant to paragraph (2), the Tribunal or Committee may at any time modify or terminate the stay at the request of either party. All stays shall automatically terminate on the date on which a final decision is rendered on the application, except that a Committee granting the partial annulment of an award may order the temporary stay of enforcement of the unannulled portion in order to give either party an opportunity to request any new Tribunal constituted pursuant to Article 52(6) of the Convention to grant a stay pursuant to Rule 55(3).\n\n(4) A request pursuant to paragraph (1), (2) (second sentence) or (3) shall specify the circumstances that require the stay or its modification or termination. A request shall only be granted after the Tribunal or Committee has given each party an opportunity of presenting its observations.\n\n(5) The Secretary-General shall promptly notify both parties of the stay of enforcement of any award and of the modification or termination of such a stay, which shall become effective on the date on which he dispatches such notification\".\n\n80.\n\nThe Parties hold different views with regard to the interpretation of the annulment regime under ICSID. Moreover, Paraguay affirmed that it has always complied with its international obligations, especially those arising from ICSID arbitrations. It added that annulment committees have routinely and consistently stayed awards pending a decision on annulment, provided that they are satisfied that the annulment petition is not merely dilatory. Quoting *Azurix v. Argentina,* Paraguay highlighted that a stay should be granted absent exceptional circumstances.62 In contrast, SGS alleged that Paraguay has repeatedly failed to comply with its international obligations; there is no automatic right to a stay of enforcement of an award and that a stay is a remedy of an exceptional nature.63\n\nParaguay\u2019s Written Submission of August 14, 2012, \u00b6 9.\n\nSGS\u2019s Written Submission of August 20, 2012, \u00b6\u00b6 7, 8, 9, 11 and 12.\n\n81.\n\nArticle 52 of the ICSID Convention and Arbitration Rules 52 to 54 lay down the fundamental rules on annulment of awards. The relevant mechanism deriving from the conjunction of such rules is the following:\n\n(a) Upon registration of an application for the annulment of an award, ICSID authorities appoint an *ad hoc* Committee to decide on such application.\n\n(b) If the application for annulment contains a request for stay of enforcement of the award, the Secretary-General of ICSID shall order the provisional stay thereof.\n\n(c) In the event that the Committee considers \"that the circumstances so require\", it may order that the stay be continued pending its decision on the application for annulment.\n\n(d) Unless the Committee decides to continue the stay, it shall automatically be terminated.\n\n(e) If the Committee grants a stay of enforcement, it may at any time modify or terminate the stay at the request of either party.\n\n82.\n\nBased on the plain language of the ICSID Convention and Arbitration Rules on annulment, it is clear to the Committee that a continued stay of enforcement of the award is not, in any event, automatic. Pursuant to article 52(5) of the ICSID Convention, a continued stay is dependent on the specific circumstances of the case. Indeed, to order the continuation of the provisional stay, the Committee must be convinced that within the context of the case at hand such continuation is required.\n\n83.\n\nThe above conclusion is further reinforced by Article 53 of the Convention, pursuant to which the binding nature of the award is the rule and its annulment the exception:\n\n\"The award shall be binding on the parties and shall not be subject to any appeal or to any other remedy except those provided for in this Convention. Each party shall abide by and comply with the terms of the award except to the extent that enforcement shall have been stayed pursuant to the relevant provisions of this Convention\".\n\n84.\n\nThe actions taken by the \"Contracting Parties\", who created the ICSID system must lead us to the conclusion that the binding nature of the award is the rule, whereas its annulment is the exception. The ICSID system is built on the premise that the awards rendered by ICSID tribunals settle in a definite manner the issues submitted to their consideration, and that only under exceptional and highly limited circumstances may their annulment be declared.\n\n85.\n\nThe inevitable consequence of the foregoing reasoning is that, despite an application for annulment, awards must be enforced and only in very specific cases where the circumstances so require, may enforcement be stayed by the corresponding committee.\n\n86.\n\nBased on the plain language of Rule 54(4) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules, it is also clear to the Committee that the party interested in the continued stay bears the burden of proof to demonstrate the existence of circumstances that warrant said continuation. Indeed, Rule 54(4) provides that \"[a] request [for a stay of enforcement]... shall specify the circumstances that require the stay...\". In the present case, the burden of establishing circumstances justifying a continued stay clearly falls on Paraguay.\n\n87.\n\nThe Committee also notes that Article 52(5) of the ICSID Convention provides that the stay shall only be continued if the Committee considers that \"the circumstances so **require\".** The Convention does not use other less categorical verbs, such as \"recommend\", \"deserve\", \"justify\" or similar words, but resorts to the imperative verb \"require\".\n\n88.\n\nIn sum, to order a continued stay of enforcement of the award, the Committee must be certain that the circumstances of the particular case so require. It is for the interested party to show that such circumstances exist, and thus, the stay of enforcement of the award should be continued.\n\n89.\n\nThe reasoning set forth above is in conformity with decisions of previous *ad hoc* committees,e. *g.,* the Committee in *Sempra v. Argentina* held that:\n\n\"Against that background, the view of the present Committee as to the prerequisites for granting a stay can be summarized as follows. An ICSID award is immediately payable by the award debtor, irrespective of whether annulment is sought or not. A stay of enforcement should not in any event be automatic, and there should not even be a presumption in favour of granting a stay of enforcement. This follows, in the Committee\u2019s opinion, from the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of Article 52(4) of the ICSID Convention, which authorizes the Committee to stay enforcement of the award pending its decision \u2018if it considers that the circumstances so require\u2019. Although the ICSID Convention does not give any indication as to what circumstances would warrant a stay, it is nonetheless clear from this language that there must be *some* circumstances present that speak in favour of granting a stay. As a consequence, it cannot be assumed that there should be a presumption in favour of a stay or that the primary burden is placed on the award creditor to show that continuation of the stay should not be granted\".64\n\nSempra Energy International v. Argentine Republic (ICSID Case No. ARB/02/16). Decision on the Argentine Republic\u2019s Request for a Continued Stay of Enforcement of the Award (Rule 54 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules) of March 5, 2009, \u00b6 27\n\n90.\n\nAs was highlighted by Paraguay, some *ad hoc* committees have considered that, absent unusual circumstances, the granting of a stay of enforcement pending the outcome of the annulment proceeding has now become almost automatic.\n\n**B. The Circumstances of the Present Case**\n--------------------------------------------\n\n91.\n\nThe Committee gave careful consideration to the rules set forth in the ICSID Convention and Rules of Arbitration with regard to the stay of enforcement of awards and to the Parties\u2019 submissions. As a result, the Committee concluded that Paraguay has failed to discharge its burden of proof. Indeed, Paraguay has not demonstrated that there are specific circumstances in the present case that require the stay to be continued.\n\n92.\n\nParaguay has limited its arguments to an attempt to prove that SGS would not be prejudiced by a continued stay and that it would be \"far more efficient\" to await a final determination of the Parties\u2019 obligations. The Committee agrees with SGS in that Paraguay has \"reversed the prejudice issue\". As stated above, under the ICSID Convention, awards are immediately binding and SGS is entitled to the amounts that were awarded by the Tribunal. It was Paraguay\u2019s burden to show that it would be prejudiced if enforcement were allowed and that such prejudice warranted a continued stay of enforcement. However, Paraguay did not even argue that it is unable to immediately pay the Award or that it would suffer economic hardship if required to do so.\n\n93.\n\nThe Committee must also reject Paraguay\u2019s argument that it would be far more efficient for it to pay only after the Committee denies its annulment request. That Paraguay may have to pay now only to be reimbursed later \u2014 if the Award were annulled \u2014 is the natural consequence of the enforcement regime created by the ICSID Convention, where a stay is the exception and not the rule. Furthermore, Paraguay has not claimed that it would be unable to recoup any payments made to SGS; it has, on the contrary, acknowledged that SGS is a large and solvent multinational company.\n\n94.\n\nParaguay repeatedly manifested that its annulment application was not presented with a dilatory purpose. In the Committee\u2019s view, the mere fact that the application is not dilatory does not justify a stay of enforcement of the Award. The Committee considers that SGS is correct in stating that Paraguay cannot be entitled to receive the benefit of a stay of enforcement merely because it acted as it was expected to.\n\n95.\n\nIn addition to the strict legal reasoning and to the analysis of the specific circumstances of the case that may warrant a stay, this Committee must assess, in order to make a determination on such a delicate matter, the recent history of Paraguay\u2019s compliance with its ICSID- related payment obligations.\n\n96.\n\nIn paragraph 187 of the Decision on Jurisdiction, issued on February 12, 2010 in the arbitration proceeding giving rise to this annulment proceeding, the Tribunal stated that:\n\n\"The Tribunal takes note that Respondent has not complied with ICSID\u2019s 27 April 2009 and 24 August 2009 requests for payment of each Party\u2019s share of the advance on costs. Instead, Claimant has paid the entirety of the requested advance on costs (including Respondent\u2019s share)\".65\n\nSGS Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale de Surveillance S.A. v. Republic of Paraguay, (ICSID Case No. ARB/07/29), Decision on Jurisdiction of February 12, 2010), \u00b6 187.\n\n97.\n\nIn paragraph 192 of the Award issued on February 10, 2012, in that same arbitration, the Tribunal pointed out that:\n\n\"The Tribunal believes that both sides have presented their positions ably and in good faith, and neither has caused undue delay or expense in the proceeding. However, Respondent has not paid its portion of the costs associated with this proceeding, and has forced Claimant to bear the entire cost itself. The Tribunal finds that Respondent should pay its share, and, therefore, awards to Claimant half of the costs of the arbitration, i.e., the amount of the ICSID costs and fees that Respondent should have advanced. The Tribunal does not believe it is appropriate to make any other award with respect to costs and fees\".66\n\nSGS Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale de Surveillance S.A. v. Republic of Paraguay, Award of February 10, 2012 (ICSID Case No. ARB/07/29), \u00b6 192.\n\n98.\n\nIn furtherance of the obligation imposed by Rule 13 of the Arbitration Rules, soon after it had been constituted, on July 30, 2012, this Committee requested that Paraguay make an advance payment of US$200,000 not later than August 29, 2012, so that the Committee would have the necessary funds to cover the expenses of the first session. On August 14, 2012, the Committee decided that the first session was to be held on August 31, 2012, provided that Paraguay made the relevant deposit in a timely fashion. In spite of other actions undertaken by the Committee and by its Secretary, payment was not received in time and the first session had to be cancelled.\n\n99.\n\nIn view of the foregoing, the Committee agreed to continue the stay of enforcement of the award until September 17, 2012 and warned Paraguay that if on such date ICSID had not received US$200,000 deposit it would terminate the stay of enforcement of the Award. Finally, on September 13, 2012 Paraguay made the deposit.\n\n100.\n\nMoreover, in the Offering the Republic of Paraguay itself acknowledged the existence of three outstanding obligations, two of them related to ICSID, to pay very considerable amounts, respectively, to nine banks, SGS and BIVAC. It also referred in the Offering to \"other creditors of Paraguay\" and to the possibility of any of those creditors (the three it identified as well as the others that it mentioned but failed to identify) attaching part of the proceeds of the Offering.\n\n101.\n\nThe purpose of the special power that the President of the Republic of Paraguay granted to the Attorney General, to which reference is made in paragraph 73 above, was to provide a \"sworn commitment\". In this Committee\u2019s opinion, such a commitment is neither provided for under the Rules of ICSID nor does it amount to the posting of security. Besides, it is not categorical enough to evidence Paraguay\u2019s firm undertaking to pay the amounts owed to SGS, in the event that the annulment of the Award were denied.\n\n102.\n\nSGS strongly opposed Paraguay's request for the continued stay of enforcement of the Award. It argued that, in any case, such stay could only be continued if Paraguay were ordered to post a bond or security. By virtue of the determination to be made *infra,* an analysis of the bond issue becomes unnecessary.\n\n103.\n\nLikewise, in view of the fact that in its letter dated January 25, 2013 SGS withdrew its request for provisional measures, the Committee will not refer to it.\n\n104.\n\nThe Parties based the arguments advanced in their written submissions on many decisions issued by other courts and arbitral tribunals. Therefore, the Committee deems it necessary to make some general comments in this regard.\n\n105.\n\nThe Committee considers that the decisions adopted by other arbitral tribunals or *ad hoc* committees are not decisive for the purpose of the settlement of this dispute and are clearly not binding upon this Committee. However, this has not prevented the Committee from taking into consideration the content of the decisions issued by other arbitral tribunals and *ad hoc* committees as well as the arguments raised by the Parties based on such decisions, insofar as they shed light on the matter to be settled in this stage of the proceeding.\n\n106.\n\nThe Committee deems it necessary to establish that its duty at this stage of the proceeding is solely to decide on the continued stay of enforcement of the Award.\n\n107.\n\nThe Committee declares that nothing contained herein may or shall be interpreted as a preview of the criteria that will be used in the decision to be issued at the end of this proceeding.\n\n108.\n\nThe Committee gave careful consideration to the content of the arguments advanced by the Parties in their written submissions, with regard to factual and legal matters, as well as to the documents contributed by them to the file. All these documents have been of utmost importance to the Committee. In this decision, the Committee refers to the arguments raised by the Parties that it deemed most relevant. Even where it fails to make express reference to all the arguments advanced by the Parties, the reasoning of the Committee considered most of them.\n\n109.\n\nBased on the conclusions reached in the foregoing paragraphs, the Committee finds that Paraguay\u2019s request for a continued stay of enforcement of the Award must be rejected.\n\nVI.

The Application for Annulment was submitted within the time period provided for by Article 52(2) of the ICSID Convention.\n\n2.\n\nThe Secretary-General of ICSID registered the Application for Annulment on June 8, 2012, in accordance with Rule 50(2) (a) and (b) of the Arbitration Rules, and at the same time notified the Parties of the provisional stay of enforcement of the Award, in accordance with Rule 54(2) of the Arbitration Rules.\n\n3.\n\nBy letter of June 25, 2012, in accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 54(2), SGS requested that the Committee rule, within 30 days of the date of its constitution, on whether the provisional stay of enforcement of the Award should be continued. SGS expressed its opposition to a continued stay of enforcement and requested that Paraguay be ordered to post a bond in the event that the Committee should decide to continue such stay.\n\n4.\n\nOn July 27, 2012, the Secretary-General, in accordance with Article 52(2) of the Arbitration Rules, informed the Parties that the *ad hoc* Committee (the \"Committee\") had been constituted. It was composed of Mr. Rodrigo Oreamuno, a national of Costa Rica, President, Mr. Eduardo Zuleta, a national of Colombia, and Mr. Salim Moollan, a national of Mauritius and France. The Parties were also informed that Mrs. Mercedes Cordido-Freytes de Kurowski, ICSID Legal Counsel, would be the Secretary of the Committee.\n\n5.\n\nBy letter of August 8, 2012, the Committee invited the Parties to file written observations on the request for continued stay of enforcement prior to the First Session. Paraguay was invited to file its observations by August 14, 2012 and SGS by August 20, 2012. Both Parties presented their submissions in a timely manner.\n\n6.\n\nThe first session was held on October 29, 2012 by telephone conference. During the First Session the Parties confirmed that the Committee had been properly constituted, in accordance with the ICSID Convention and the Arbitration Rules, and that they had no objections to the appointment of any member of the Committee. It was agreed that the proceeding would be conducted in accordance with the ICSID Arbitration Rules in effect from April 10, 2006. The Parties agreed on several other procedural matters, *inter alia,* that the procedural languages would be English and Spanish, and that the place of the proceeding would be the seat of the Centre in Washington D.C. The Parties\u2019 joint agreement and the procedural calendar were incorporated in Procedural Order No. 1 dated November 13, 2012, signed by the President and circulated to the Parties.\n\n7.\n\nOn November 7, 2012, each party filed further observations with regard to SGS\u2019 request to terminate the stay of enforcement of the Award.\n\n8.\n\nOn November 14, 2012, following the resignation of the *ad hoc* Committee member Mr. Salim Moollan, the Secretary-General notified the Parties of the vacancy, and the proceeding was suspended pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rules 53 and 10(2).\n\n9.\n\nOn November 26, 2012, after consulting with the Parties, the Chairman of the ICSID Administrative Council appointed Judge Abdulqawi A. Yusuf, a Somali, Djiboutian and Canadian national, to the *ad hoc* Committee to fill the vacancy caused by Mr. Salim Moollan\u2019s resignation.\n\n10.\n\nFollowing the appointment of Judge Abdulqawi A. Yusuf, the *ad hoc* Committee was reconstituted and the proceeding was resumed on November 29, 2012, pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rules 53 and 12.\n\n11.\n\nIn accordance with the procedural calendar set forth in Procedural Order No. 1, the Republic of Paraguay filed its Memorial on Annulment on January 4, 2013, and SGS filed its Counter-Memorial on March 8, 2013. On March 22, 2013, the Tribunal decided that a second round of pleadings was not needed.\n\n12.\n\nOn January 17, 2013, SGS filed a request for provisional measures. By a communication dated January 24, 2013, Paraguay strongly opposed the provisional measures requested by SGS and on January 25, 2013, SGS sent a letter to the Committee in which it withdrew its request for provisional relief.\n\n13.\n\nOn March 22, 2013, the *ad hoc* Committee issued its Decision on Paraguay\u2019s Request for the Continued Stay of Enforcement of the Award and SGS\u2019 request to terminate it. In it, the Committee decided to reject Paraguay\u2019s request, declared that the provisional stay granted by the Secretary-General was terminated as of that date, and that it would rule on the allocation of costs and expenses in its decision on the annulment of the Award.\n\n14.\n\nThe Hearing on Annulment was scheduled to take place on June 13, 2013. However, it was cancelled because Paraguay failed to pay in time the corresponding fees. It was subsequently rescheduled for November 1, 2013.\n\n15.\n\nOn August 6, 2013, Counsel for SGS, with the assent of Counsel to Paraguay, informed the Tribunal that the Parties had successfully concluded settlement negotiations and executed a Settlement Agreement dated July 20, 2013. This Agreement required specific actions to be taken by the Parties by December 15, 2013. The Parties agreed that, pending such actions, the annulment proceeding should continue as scheduled and requested the Tribunal to maintain the scheduled date for the Hearing on Annulment.\n\n16.\n\nOn September 20, 2013, the Tribunal requested the Parties to inform whether the Hearing on Annulment that had been scheduled for November 1, 2013 would go forward. Counsel for Paraguay replied on September 24, 2013, indicating that the specified actions required by the Settlement Agreement had not been undertaken and that it was unlikely that they would before November 1, 2013. The Parties therefore agreed that the Hearing on Annulment should go forward on November 1, 2013, as scheduled.\n\n17.\n\nOn 1 November 2013, the Hearing on Annulment was held at the seat of the Centre in Washington, D.C. The three members of the *ad hoc* Committee and the Secretary were present during the hearing.\n\n18.\n\nDuring the hearing, SGS was represented by Messrs. Olivier Merkt and Nicolas Gr\u00e9goire from the Legal Department of SGS Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale de Surveillance S. A., and by Messrs. Paul Friedland, Damien Nyer and Daniel Aun from White & Case LLP.\n\n19.\n\nThe Republic of Paraguay was represented by Dr. Roberto Moreno Rodr\u00edguez, *Procurador General de la Rep\u00fablica,* Dr. Giuseppe Fossati, Legal Counsel from the *Procuradur\u00eda* *General de la Rep\u00fablica',* Dr. Benigno L\u00f3pez, and by Mr. Brian C. Dunning, Mr. David Cinotti and Ms. Irene Ribeiro Gee from Venable LLP.\n\n20.\n\nOn March 26, 2014, the proceeding was declared closed in accordance with Rules 53 and 38(1) of the Arbitration Rules.\n\n21.\n\nThe *ad hoc* Committee conducted its deliberations by various modes of communication among its members and in issuing this Decision has taken into account all written submissions and oral arguments of the Parties.\n\nII **THE PARTIES\u2019 POSITIONS**\n-----------------------------\n\n**A PARAGUAY\u2019S POSITION**\n-------------------------\n\n22.\n\nIn its Application, Paraguay requested the *ad hoc* Committee to annul the Award in its entirety on the basis of two grounds contained in Article 52 of the ICSID Convention: (i) that the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers (Article 52(1)(b) of the ICSID Convention); and (ii) that the award failed to state the reasons on which it is based (Article 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention).\n\n23.\n\nParaguay argued these two grounds for annulment in its Memorial. However, at the hearing, Paraguay said that the main question that it would address was whether or not the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers1. Paraguay would therefore not refer to the parts of its brief related to sovereign acts and the failure to state reasons, but it would rest on its Memorials about these two matters.2\n\nTr., 8:18-20\n\nTr., 9:4-9\n\n***Manifest Excess of Powers***\n-------------------------------\n\n24.\n\nAccording to Paraguay the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers in two ways. First, the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers in deciding the merits of a dispute over which it lacked jurisdiction, because of an exclusive forum selection clause in the contract in favour of the exclusive jurisdiction of Paraguayan courts. Second, the Tribunal also manifestly exceeded its powers by deciding SGS\u2019s claims on the merits, because a pure breach of contract by a State without the exercise of sovereign powers cannot violate the BIT.3\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6 36-37\n\n25.\n\nIn its Memorial on Annulment Paraguay stated:\n\n\"The Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers by refusing to give effect to this forum-selection clause and instead deciding that Paraguay violated the BIT because it breached the payment obligations in the Contract.\"4\n\nId., \u00b6 2\n\n26.\n\nParaguay added:\n\n\"The Tribunal also manifestly exceeded its jurisdiction in deciding the merits of SGS\u2019s claims because a failure to pay under a contract, without any use or abuse of sovereign authority, cannot amount to a treaty breach, as many ICSID tribunals have held. Because the alleged breach of contract could not violate the BIT, the claim was manifestly outside the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction.\"5\n\nid., \u00b6 3\n\n27.\n\nParaguay divided its argument on manifest excess of power in two parts:\n\n\"First, the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers when it considered and decided SGS\u2019s claim that Paraguay breached the Contract by failing to pay SGS\u2019s invoices. This contract claim was within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Paraguayan courts pursuant to the clear and unambiguous terms of the parties\u2019 Contract. No other ICSID tribunal has held that an Umbrella Clause in a BIT renders within its jurisdiction and admissible a breach of contract, without more, that is undisputedly subject to an exclusive contractual forum-selection clause.\"6\n\n\"The Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers in this case by deciding a claim that was outside its jurisdiction under the BIT and that was inadmissible because it was within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Paraguayan courts. Because the Tribunal lacked authority to decide the merits of the case, it manifestly exceeded its powers.\"7\n\n\"Second, the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers by deciding SGS\u2019s claim on the merits because a pure breach of contract, without any sovereign act, cannot violate the Umbrella Clause in the BIT. SGS\u2019s claim based solely on failure to pay under the Contract was manifestly outside the Tribunal\u2019s power to decide.\"8\n\nId., \u00b6 36\n\nId., \u00b6 38\n\nId., \u00b6 37\n\n28.\n\nParaguay also affirmed:\n\n\"Although the *ad hoc* Committee is not a court of appeal, the Tribunal\u2019s decision to consider SGS\u2019s claim on the merits goes far beyond mere error of law or treaty misinterpretation\" \"...the Award should be annulled because the Tribunal had no authority to consider the merits of SGS\u2019s claims in the first place. Indeed, in rejecting BIVAC\u2019s claims, the *BIVAC* tribunal held that \"[f]or this Tribunal to exercise jurisdiction in relation to a pure contractual dispute, in the circumstances of this case, would plainly amount to an excess of jurisdiction.\"9\n\nId. \u00b6 44 (footnote omitted)\n\n29.\n\nWith respect to the forum-selection clause, Paraguay asserted:\n\n\"It was a manifest excess of powers to refuse to enforce the forum-selection clause and instead decide the merits of SGS\u2019s contract claim pursuant to the Umbrella Clause in the BIT. This excess of power is \u2018obvious from a simple reading of the reasons of the Tribunal\u2019. The Tribunal\u2019s exercise of jurisdiction violated fundamental principles of party autonomy or *pacta sunt servanda,* and is inconsistent with the rule that specific agreements control over general agreements on the same issue.\"10\n\nId., \u00b6 47 (footnote omitted)\n\n30.\n\nParaguay concluded its argumentation about the forum-selection clause stating:\n\n\"For these reasons, the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers by refusing to abide by the clear language in the Contract and instead deciding the merits of SGS\u2019s Umbrella Clause claim, a claim fundamentally based on a contract rather than any independent treaty standard.\"11\n\nId., \u00b693\n\n31.\n\nParaguay argued that the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers in a second way, by deciding the merits of a contractual dispute, outside the scope of the Umbrella Clause12.\n\nId., \u00b6 94\n\n32.\n\nIn Paraguay\u2019s view, a breach of contract by a State, without the exercise of sovereign powers, cannot violate the Umbrella Clause in the BIT13. Paraguay referred to the decisions in *Pan American Energy LLC v Argentine Republic, Impregilo S.p.A v Islamic Republic of Pakistan* and *Joy Mining Machinery Ltd v. Arab Republic of Egypt,* to state that Umbrella Clauses and BIT standards are not breached by a commercial conduct like the failure to pay under a contract. On the contrary, \"only governmental or sovereign conduct can breach a BIT standard\"14\n\nId., \u00b6\u00b6 35-37\n\nId., \u00b6 94\n\n33.\n\nMoreover, the Umbrella Clause in the BIT does not transform a mere contract breach into a treaty breach and is not sufficiently specific to override this rule15. Further, the Umbrella clause is not a substantive standard of protection16 and does not automatically convert contract claims into treaty claims. Paraguay cites, the decisions in *Bayandir v. Pakistan* and *Impregilo v. Pakistan* which confirm the basic principle that a State does not violate international law by simply breaching a contract17.\n\nId., \u00b6 97\n\nId., \u00b6 98\n\nId., \u00b6\u00b6 102-104\n\n34.\n\nWith respect to the umbrella clause, Paraguay concluded:\n\n\"Accordingly, the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers by exercising jurisdiction over a pure breach of contract on the theory that the Umbrella Clause elevates a breach of contract to a breach of treaty. Paraguay\u2019s alleged failure to pay invoice, the sole basis of the Award here, involves no sovereign act or abuse of sovereign authority, and therefore cannot amount to breach of the BIT.\"18\n\nId., \u00b6 105\n\n35.\n\nAccording to Paraguay:\n\n\"... if the commitments protected by the Umbrella Clause included contractual commitments, the Tribunal was required to examine the Contract as a whole, not merely parts of it... The Tribunal\u2019s basis for rejecting this argument is far from clear and was based on reasoning that contradicted its explanation for exercising jurisdiction over SGS\u2019s Umbrella Clause claim.\"19\n\nId., \u00b6 108 (internal quotation and footnote omitted)\n\n36.\n\nParaguay asserted that:\n\n\"In its Decision on Jurisdiction, the Tribunal repeatedly relied on a distinction between treaty and contract claims... the Tribunal performed no separate treaty analysis or different inquiry; instead, the tribunal entirely focused on whether Paraguay breached the Contract, not whether it breached an independent treaty standard.\"20\n\nId., \u00b6\u00b6 109 and 110 (internal quotations and footnotes omitted)\n\n37.\n\nAt the hearing on annulment held in Washington D.C. on November 1, 2013, Paraguay summarized the arguments on which it based its request for the annulment of the Award.\n\n38.\n\nParaguay stated: \"...the main question to be addressed today is whether or not the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers.\"21\n\nTr., 8:18-20\n\n39.\n\nParaguay added that it would point out \"...the standard under which this Committee should review our challenges to the award\"22, and said that its argument about the standard for the review rests on three main propositions.\n\nTr., 9:16-18\n\n40.\n\nAccording to Paraguay, those three propositions are the following:\n\na) \"... a tribunal exceeds its powers when it decides an issue that the parties committed to the exclusive jurisdiction of a different tribunal or forum.\"\n\nb) \"...that power, not jurisdiction or admissibility, is the key issue under Article 52(1)b.\"\n\nc) \"...whether the term \"manifest\" requires obvious excess, series (sic) excess, or simply an excess of jurisdiction..,\"23\n\nTr., 9:21-22 to 10:1-7\n\n41.\n\nWhen explaining its first proposition, Paraguay stated:\n\n\"This application is not about perceived errors on the merits of a Tribunal's Award, but the illegitimacy of the Tribunal's rendering an award on the merits at all.\"24\n\nTr., 10:15-18\n\n42.\n\nParaguay also argued as follows: \"... what could go more to the heart of the legitimacy of the decision-making process than an argument that the Tribunal lacked any power to render a decision at all on the merits. A tribunal's power is necessarily tied to the consent of the parties.\"25\n\nTr., 11:4-8\n\n43.\n\nIn its PowerPoint presentation Paraguay cited the Decision on Annulment issued in *CDC Group PLC v. Republic of the Seychelles,* in which it was affirmed that a \"Tribunal\u2019s **legitimate exercise of power** is tied to the consent of the parties, and so it exceeds its powers where it acts in contravention of that consent..,\"26\n\nParaguay\u2019s Presentation, November 1, 2013, p. 4\n\n44.\n\nIt also referred to *Helnan v. Egypt (Decision on Annulment),* saying that \"[t]he concept of the powers of a tribunal **goes further than its jurisdiction.. \"27**\n\nId.\n\n45.\n\nParaguay then explained its second proposition, saying that:\n\n\"The second proposition is that the issue before this committee is whether the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers. The committee need not decide whether the challenges here pertain to jurisdiction or admissibility.\"\n\n\"Article 52(1)b speaks of exceeding powers, not jurisdiction.\"28\n\nTr., 12:6-10 to 12-13\n\n46.\n\nParaguay also quoted Professor Vaughan Lowe saying that \"the tribunal of general jurisdiction must decline to accept the case, because the parties are legally bound to refer the case to another tribunal.\"29\n\nParaguay\u2019s Presentation, November 1, 2013, p. 5\n\n47.\n\nWith respect to the standard of the term \"manifest\", Paraguay referred to the ICSID Background Paper on Annulment saying that *\"ad hoc* committees have interpreted \u2018manifest\u2019 to mean \u2018obvious, clear or self-evident, and which is discernible without the need for an elaborate analysis of the award\u2019.\"30\n\nId., p. 7\n\n48.\n\nAccording to Paraguay, in this case, \"[t]he Tribunal\u2019s excess of power was obvious, clear, self-evident, and requires no elaborate analysis to understand.\"31\n\nTr., 16:11-14\n\n49.\n\nParaguay also stated that \"...a tribunal that exceeds the boundaries of the parties' consent to arbitrate has necessarily committed a manifest excess of power.\"32\n\nTr., 16:19-21\n\n50.\n\nParaguay then affirmed that \"...the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers when it decided SGS's umbrella clause claim.\"33\n\nTr., 17:7-9\n\n51.\n\nDuring the hearing, Paraguay referred expressly to the forum-selection clause of the agreement:\n\n\"Any conflict, controversy or claim deriving from or in connection with the Contract, its breach, termination or invalidity shall be submitted to the Courts of the City of Asunci\u00f3n.\"34\n\nTr., 17:14-17\n\n52.\n\nParaguay added that \"[t]he Tribunal should, therefore, have acknowledged and enforced the forum-selection clause in the contract and declined to hear SGS's claim for nonpayment.\"35\n\nTr., 17:20-22\n\n53.\n\nParaguay further explained that \"...at least the following aspects of the Tribunal's decision are evidence of manifest excess of the Tribunal's powers\":\n\na) \"...the Tribunal ignored party autonomy by refusing to enforce the forum-selection clause\";\n\nb) \"The Tribunal's disregard of the forum-selection clause is completely inconsistent... with the internationally-accepted legal doctrine of pacta *sunt servanda.*\n\nc) \"...the Tribunal also disregarded the universally-accepted rules of legal interpretation, *generalia specialibus non derogant* and *lex specialis generalibus derogant '..*\n\nd) \"...other ICSID Tribunals have dismissed umbrella clause claims based on breach of contract when contract disputes are subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of another formula.\"36\n\nTr., 18:6-7, 19:18-21, 21:6-9 and 22:3-6\n\n54.\n\nDuring the hearing, Paraguay referred specifically to the decision on annulment issued in the Vivendi I case and quoted the following from that decision:\n\n\"Whether there has been a breach of the BIT and whether there has been a breach of contract are different questions. Each of these claims will be determined by reference to its own proper or applicable law.\"37\n\nTr., 23:13-17\n\n55.\n\nParaguay also quoted paragraph 98 of the Vivendi I decision on annulment:\n\n\"In a case where the essential basis of a claim brought before an international tribunal is a breach of contract, the tribunal will give effect to any valid choice of forum clause in the contract.\"38\n\nParaguay\u2019s Presentation, November 1, 2013, p. 16\n\n56.\n\nParaguay argued that: \"...the umbrella clause and the commitments here do not arise from an independent treaty standard. The basis of the claim is the breach of a contractual commitment; a contract that contained the provision that expressly withdrew consent to arbitrate contractual claims.\"39\n\nTr., 26:5-10\n\n57.\n\nParaguay concluded that:\n\n\"The Tribunal's failure to give effect to the parties' bargain in the form of a forum-selection clause constituted a manifest excess of power.\"40\n\nTr., 27: 2-4\n\n58.\n\nIn its rebuttal in the Hearing Paraguay stated:\n\n\"...Paraguay is not asking this Committee to substitute its judgment for that of the Tribunal, or to decide the merits of the case de novo.\"41 It is asking the Committee \"...to recognize that the Tribunal never had the power to hear this claim in the first place.\"42\n\nTr., 47: 12-14\n\nTr., 47: 17-19\n\n59.\n\nIt added that:\n\n\"...Paraguay believes that the basic principle in issue in this case is consent of the parties\"; and argued that: \"... Paraguay never consented to arbitrate these contract claims before an arbitration Tribunal of any kind.\"43\n\nTr., 48: 3-7\n\n60.\n\nParaguay also affirmed that on the question of specific versus general, \"SGS has turned the concept on its head a bit in arguing that the treaty is the specific and the forum-selection clause is the general and would argue that the treaty is clearly the more general as it mentions no specific party except for Paraguay, no specific contract or specific aspect of the contract.\"44\n\n\"The Tribunal simply repeatedly talked about what it took to breach the contract rather than what it took to breach the commitment clause in the treaty. That is, it engaged in no separate treaty inquiry.\"45\n\nTr., 48: 16-22\n\nTr., 51:11-15\n\n61.\n\nParaguay further argued that:\n\n\"... the Tribunal refused to deal with the central issue as to what constituted the separate legal inquiry, the separate legal inquiry that the Vivendi annulment committee set forth as the distinction between treaty and contract that the Tribunal said in its decision of jurisdiction applied.\"46\n\nTr., 52:10-15\n\n62.\n\nParaguay summarized its position as follows:\n\n\"...what we are asking is that the committee put everything in context and try to reconcile this big tension between international law and domestic law..,\"47\n\n\"... and in that context of the mandate of the BIT,... try to make sense of all this, respecting the principle that the parties made an agreement to dispute contractual claims somewhere else.\"48\n\nTr., 53:18-21\n\nTr., 54:1-5\n\n63.\n\nFinally, Paraguay stated the following:\n\n\"... the other point... is about what SGS coined as non-textual limitations of the umbrella clause, like we\u2019re trying to create textual limitations to the meaning of the umbrella clause.\"49\n\nTr., 54:7-11\n\n***Failure to State Reasons***\n------------------------------\n\n64.\n\nIn its Memorial, Paraguay stated that the Award should be annulled on the additional ground that it failed to state reasons50.\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6 106\n\n65.\n\nParaguay argued that the failure to state reasons not only exists when the Tribunal gives no reasons at all but also \"... applies when the tribunal\u2019s reasons \u2018are so inadequate that the coherence of the reasoning is seriously affected\u2019 or when the reasons are not \u2018adequate and sufficient reasonably to bring about the result reached by the Tribunal\u2019.\"51\n\nId., \u00b6 106 (footnotes omitted)\n\n66.\n\nParaguay contended that the Tribunal did not conduct independent treaty analysis on the contract commitment to provide access to local courts as encompassed by the Umbrella Clause; and instead, it merely acted as a commercial tribunal deciding a contract case52.\n\nId., \u00b6 119\n\n67.\n\nAccording to Paraguay the Tribunal's analysis did not respond to the arguments on independent treaty analysis, which required the Tribunal to examine contractual commitments as a whole and whether or not Paraguay could have violated the contract without blocking access to domestic courts53. In this connection, Paraguay referred to the decisions in *BIVAC v. Paraguay* and *SGS v. Philippines,* where the Tribunals considered that the treaty standard had to incorporate the whole Contract and not ignore the forum-selection clause54. Despite the incorporation of the BIT into the contract, the Tribunal's analysis does not explain why it considered one commitment and not the other55.\n\nId., \u00b6 114\n\nId., \u00b6 115\n\nId.,\u00b6\u00b6 116-118\n\n68.\n\nReferring to the Tribunal\u2019s alleged failure to state reasons, Paraguay argued that:\n\n\"... if the umbrella clause elevated the contract to a commitment protected by the treaty... then the treaty inquiry... required the Tribunal to consider the entire contract.\"56\n\nTr., 50: 17-22\n\n69.\n\nFor the reasons stated in its Memorial and at the hearing, Paraguay asked the Committee to \"... annul the Award in its entirety.\"57\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6 121\n\n**B SGS\u2019 POSITION**\n-------------------\n\n70.\n\nSGS affirms that Paraguay\u2019s Annulment Application rests on a disagreement about the Tribunal\u2019s interpretation of the BIT and that it raises before the Committee the same arguments that it presented before to the Tribunal58.\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, 1-2\n\n71.\n\nOn its March, 8 2013 Counter-Memorial SGS referred to Paraguay\u2019s claims about the forum-selection clause stating:\n\n\"The Tribunal here found that the contractual forum selection clause did not deprive the investor of its right under the BIT to seek international arbitration to resolve its treaty claim. To find otherwise would depart from the plain and ordinary meaning of the BIT, which makes a contractual breach a treaty breach and which provides for international arbitration for any treaty claim. Even if, contrary to fact, the Tribunal\u2019s reasoning had been inconsistent with the language of the BIT, that would not matter for the purposes of Article 52. It does not matter under Article 52 whether the Tribunal was right or wrong in its interpretation of the Treaty. It does not matter under Article 52 whether other ICSID tribunals have taken a different view, or the same view, of the issue presented. And it does not matter under Article 52 whether some or all of the members of this Committee, had they been asked to decide the merits of the dispute, might have come to a different or the same conclusion as to how to harmonize the tension between the provisions of the BIT and the contractual forum selection clause.\"59\n\nId., \u00b6 3\n\n72.\n\nSGS added:\n\n\"Paraguay likewise argues that, on both jurisdictional and admissibility grounds, the Tribunal should have disregarded the clear and explicit dispute resolution provisions of the BIT in favour of the forum selection clause of the Contract because of the maxims of *pacta sunt servanda* and *lex specialis generalibus derogat.* Whatever their merits (and this Committee need not endorse or reject them), Paraguay\u2019s arguments fall far short of establishing that the Tribunal\u2019s conclusions had no basis in the BIT and were, therefore, *untenable* and constituting a *manifest* excess of powers.\"60\n\nId., \u00b6 48 (footnote omitted)\n\n73.\n\nSGS also affirmed the following:\n\n\"Commentators have similarly rejected Paraguay\u2019s interpretation of the ICSID Convention as requiring a different standard for jurisdictional determinations. The main drafter of the ICSID Convention, Aron Broches, explained:\n\n\u2018Art. 41 of the Convention declares that the Tribunal is the judge of its competence. An *ad hoc* Committee constituted to rule on a request for annulment may not substitute its view for that of the Tribunal as if it were an appellate and hierarchically superior body, which it is not. It may annul the award only if the Tribunal\u2019s decision on competence was *manifestly* wrong\u2019.\"61\n\nId., \u00b6 43 (footnote omitted)\n\n74.\n\nWith respect to Paraguay\u2019s assertion that the Tribunal did not reason the Award properly, SGS affirmed that the Tribunal expressed its reasons amply in paragraphs 101 to 109 of the Award and in paragraphs 173-185 of the Decision on Jurisdiction62.\n\nId., \u00b670 and \u00b675.\n\n75.\n\nSGS also affirmed:\n\n\"Paraguay is wrong. The Tribunal, while observing that Paraguay\u2019s argument \u2018taken on its face, lack[ed] logical coherence\u2019 because it could not be correct that \u2018Paraguay had the option of *either* paying its invoices *or* submitting the dispute to the local courts\u2019, nonetheless offered a detailed rebuttal of the argument and conducted an analysis under the BIT.\"\n\n\"The Tribunal\u2019s premise was its earlier conclusion in the Decision on Jurisdiction and the Award that an umbrella clause elevates contractual commitments into treaty obligations\".63\n\n\"Paraguay appears to fault the Tribunal for not having articulated further why, if the effect of Article 11 of the BIT was to elevate Paraguay\u2019s contractual obligation to pay its invoices into a treaty obligation, the parties\u2019 obligation under the Contract to litigate their disputes in the Paraguayan courts was not likewise elevated.\"64\n\nId., \u00b6\u00b6 70-71 (footnotes omitted)\n\nId.. \u00b6 73 (footnote omitted)\n\n***Manifest Excess of Powers***\n-------------------------------\n\n76.\n\nAt the hearing, SGS referred to the Article 52 standard and to the *CDC* case, which in its view is about legitimacy of the process. It stated that \"Article 52 was included in the Convention primarily to assure the legitimacy of the process, not to assure a correct result...\"65\n\nTr., 28:14-16\n\n77.\n\nFor SGS, \"Legitimacy ha[d] two notions. One concerns jurisdiction, and the other concerns the process.\"66\n\nTr., 28: 20-21\n\n78.\n\nSGS quoted from the Decision of the *AES v. Hungary* Committee the following:\n\n*\"Ad hoc* committees must avoid \u2018an approach which would result in the qualification of a tribunal\u2019s reasoning as deficient, superficial, sub-standard, wrong, bad or otherwise faulty, in other words, a re-assessment of the merits which is typical for an appeal.\"67\n\nSGS\u2019 Presentation, November 1, 2013, page 4\n\n79.\n\nSGS then referred to the functions of annulment committees stating:\n\n\"Where there\u2019s disagreement among ICSID Tribunals about an issue of treaty interpretation, it\u2019s not the task of an *ad hoc* committee to pick one side or the other or to try to harmonize ICSID jurisprudence.\"68\n\nTr., 30:6-10\n\n80.\n\nWith respect to the forum-selection clause, SGS also stated that it was not asking the Committee: \"\n\n\"... to characterize Paraguay\u2019s arguments about the forum-selection clause debate as admissibility rather than jurisdiction.\"69\n\n\"You can characterize them as both ways,... and we will respond to both. And we will treat them independently, addressing... the jurisdictional aspect of the forum-selection clause argument first.\"70\n\nTr., 31: 9-11\n\nTr., 31:13-17\n\n81.\n\nWith respect to what it called Paraguay\u2019s jurisdictional argument, SGS cited paragraphs 141-142 of the Decision on Jurisdiction, that quoted *Vivendi I v. Argentina* and read as follows:\n\n\"Where \u2018the fundamental basis of the claim\u2019 is a treaty laying down an independent standard by which the conduct of the parties is to be judged, the existence of an exclusive jurisdiction clause in a contract between the claimant and the respondent state or one of its subdivisions cannot operate as a bar to the application of the treaty standard. We note that in our view, this rule applies with equal force in the context of an umbrella clause.\"71\n\nTr., 32: 3-11, quoting from Decision on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6141-142\n\n82.\n\nCommenting on ICSID\u2019s jurisprudence about the jurisdictional matter, SGS affirmed:\n\n\"...the tribunal\u2019s jurisdictional ruling relied on the plain language of the BIT which provides for ICSID arbitration under all treaty claims..,\"72\n\n\"... ICSID jurisprudence is so well-established on this jurisdictional point that Dolzer and Schreuer call it a consistent practice, that the treaty-based jurisdiction of international arbitral Tribunals to decide on violations of these treaties is not affected by domestic forum-selection clauses in contracts.\"73\n\nTr., 33: 4-6\n\nTr., 33: 11-16\n\n83.\n\nSGS further argued that:\n\n\"...Paraguay just asks to take a different view than the overwhelming weight of ICSID authority and commentary. Well, even if you had a different view, it's not a basis for an Article 52 claim. In fact, it wouldn\u2019t be a basis for an Article 52 claim even if the overwhelming weight of jurisdiction and commentary were contrary to fact on Paraguay's side.\"74\n\n\"The Tribunal here based its jurisdictional ruling on the plain language of the BIT; and it can\u2019t be and wasn\u2019t an excess of power, let alone a manifest excess of power.\"75\n\nTr., 33: 21-22 and 34:1-6\n\nTr., 34:7-10\n\n84.\n\nSGS then referred to the forum-selection clause, which, in its view, is about:\n\n\"... the issue of how to resolve the tension when a BIT provides for ICSID arbitration over all claims arising under the treaty, including an umbrella clause. And then an umbrella clause claim is based on a contract that contains a local court submission. This is a much-debated, very interesting issue in international investment law. And it's an interesting and much-debated issue because there\u2019s no easy answer.\"76\n\nTr., 35:15-22\n\n85.\n\nSGS further stated \"One or the other has to take primacy, either the ICSID consent in the BIT that is perfected when the investor files its claims for ICSID arbitration or the local court submission in the contract.\"77\n\nTr., 36:2-7\n\n86.\n\nSGS quoted paragraph 171 of the Decision on Jurisdiction, which reads as follows:\n\n\"Thus the Tribunal finds that it has jurisdiction over Claimant\u2019s claims under Article 11 that Paraguay failed to observe commitments it allegedly made to SGS, both under the Contract and under its alleged subsequent oral and written promises to make good on the claimed debt to SGS. And having found jurisdiction, we are of course mindful of the Vivendi I \u2018annulment committee\u2019s admonition that a \u2018[t]ribunal, faced with such a claim and having validly held that it had jurisdiction, [is] obliged to consider and to decide it\u2019.\"78\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 171 and SGS\u2019 Presentation, November 1, 2013, page 12\n\n87.\n\nAccording to SGS, this meant that:\n\n\"... the Tribunal recognized that the two instruments in question, the BIT and the contract, gave the investor a choice. And by ruling this way it\u2019s our submission (sic) the Tribunal resolved the tension as best as the tension can be resolved. But it doesn\u2019t matter whether we\u2019re wrong. And it doesn\u2019t matter whether you disagree with the way the Tribunal resolved this tension. This is indisputably a subject matter about which reasonable minds can differ.\"79\n\nTr., 36:19-22 and 37:1-6\n\n88.\n\nSGS then quoted the decision rendered in the *Azurix Corp. v. Argentina* Annulment Proceeding (ICSID Case No. ARB/01/12, \u00b6 68), that concluded:\n\n\"If (...) reasonable minds might differ as to whether or not the Tribunal has jurisdiction, that issue falls to be resolved definitively by the Tribunal.\"80\n\nSGS\u2019 Presentation, November 1, 2013, page 13\n\n89.\n\nSGS further stated:\n\n\"... another way to characterize this interesting tension in international investment law is that its resolution is debatable. And as you see on page 14 (of SGS\u2019s presentation), where the matter is debatable, Article 52 does not apply.\"81\n\n\"As the *CDC* committee said, any excess apparent in a Tribunal\u2019s conduct if susceptible of argument one way or the other is not manifest.\"82\n\nTr., 37:19-22 and 38:1\n\nTr., 38:2-4\n\n90.\n\nSGS then quoted the *Duke Energy International Peru Investments No. I Limited v. Peru,* ICSID Case No. ARB/03/28, Decision of the *ad hoc* Committee (March 1, 2011), at \u00b6 99 that stated:\n\n\"A debatable solution is not amenable to annulment [under Article 52], since the excess of powers would not then be \u2018manifest\u2019.\"83\n\nTr., 38:9-12\n\n91.\n\nSGS further stated that:\n\n\"Paraguay has argued that the \u2018where reasonable minds differ\u2019 standard doesn\u2019t apply to jurisdiction or admissibility issues; but that reads manifest out of Article 52. And *ad hoc* committees have rejected just that argument.\"84\n\nTr., 38:13-17\n\n92.\n\nWith respect to this issue, which was referred specifically in the *Soufraki* and *Lucchetti* cases, SGS affirmed that they basically agree in that \"the requirement that an excess of power must be \u2018manifest\u2019 applies equally if the question is one of jurisdiction.\"85\n\n\"The Committee [ *Lucchetti v Peru* Committee] considers that the word \u2018manifest\u2019 should be given considerable weight also when matters of jurisdiction are concerned.\"86\n\nSGS\u2019 Presentation, November 1, 2013, page 15\n\nId.\n\n93.\n\nSGS further contended that:\n\n\"The extreme complexity of the jurisdictional requirements under the convention makes it necessary to limit the permissible reassessment of the Tribunal's competence by an ad hoc committee.\"87\n\nTr., 39:6-9\n\n94.\n\nQuoting from the *M.C.I Power* Decision, SGS argued that:\n\n\"...As the M.C.I. Power v. Ecuador Committee said \u2018the annulment mechanism is not designed to bring about consistency in the interpretation and application of international investment law.\"88\n\nSGS\u2019 Presentation, November 1, 2013, page 17 (footnote omitted)\n\n95.\n\nSGS then referred to another argument raised by Paraguay:\n\n\"Paraguay\u2019s contention..., not raised this morning but raised in its brief, is that the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its power by allowing the umbrella clause claim to proceed, absent evidence of sovereign action.\"89\n\nTr., 40:13-17\n\n96.\n\nSGS expressed the view that:\n\n\"... the key point here is that nothing in the text of the BIT\u2019s umbrella clause says or suggests that sovereign action is required. And given that our Tribunal applied and followed the plain text of the BIT, I don\u2019t see how it could have been a manifest excess of power.\"90\n\nTr., 41:10-15\n\n97.\n\nSGS then quoted paragraph 168 of the Decision on Jurisdiction which reads as follows:\n\n\"Given the unqualified text of Article 11 of the Treaty, and its ordinary meaning, we see no basis to import into Article 11 the non-textual limitations that Respondent proposed in its Reply. Article 11 does not exclude commercial contracts of the State from its scope. Likewise, Article 11 does not state that its constant guarantee of observance of such commitments may be breached only through actions that a commercial counterparty cannot take, through abuses of state power, or through exertions of undue government influence.\"91\n\nSGS\u2019 Presentation, November 1, 2013, page 19 (footnote omitted)\n\n***Failure to State Reasons***\n------------------------------\n\n98.\n\nSGS then referred to Paraguay\u2019s contention that the Tribunal failed to state the reasons on which it based the Award. SGS summarized Paraguay\u2019s position about this issue asserting that the \"...Tribunal stated that contract claims are distinct from treaty claims but then treated the treaty claim as indistinguishable from the contract claim. And that\u2019s a failure to state reasons.\"92\n\nTr., 43:3-6\n\n99.\n\nSGS answered Paraguay\u2019s assertion arguing that \"...the point that our Tribunal was making was that the BIT and contract provide independent bases for a claim. Our Tribunal also held that the same act can breach both the treaty and the contract and that the umbrella clause equated a breach of contract with the treaty breach\"93 and quoted the last sentence of paragraph 105 of the Award where it is stated that:\n\n\"The two obligations are discrete, separate commitments as between the parties, assuming the contrary would, in effect, imply that one can only breach a contract when it breaches, not one, but more than one of its clauses.\"94\n\nTr., 43:7-12\n\nTr., 43: 18-22\n\n100.\n\nSGS concluded this part of its presentation by stating that:\n\n\" [A]s the Vivendi I committee stated on the Article 52 standard with respect to reasons, it is well accepted, both in the cases and the literature, that Article 52(1)(e) concerns a failure to state any reasons with respect to all or part of an award, not the failure to state correct or convincing reasons.\"95\n\n\"It bears reiterating that an *ad hoc* Committee is not a court of appeal. Provided that the reasons given by a Tribunal can be followed and relate to issues that were before the Tribunal, their correctness is beside the point in terms of Article 52(1)(e).\"96\n\nTr., 44: 4-9\n\nTr., 44:10-15\n\n101.\n\nSGS requested the Committee to:\n\na. Reject Paraguay\u2019s Annulment Application in its entirety;\n\nb. Order Paraguay immediately to comply with the Award; and\n\nc. Order Paraguay to bear all costs incurred by SGS in connection with this annulment proceeding, including its legal fees and expenses, as well as the fees and expenses of ICSID\u2019s Secretariat and the members of the Committee97.\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, \u00b681\n\nIII **ANALYSIS OF THE** ***AD HOC*** **COMMITTEE**\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n102.\n\nIn order to arrive to the conclusions contained in this Decision the Committee reviewed and considered all the arguments of the Parties and the documents submitted by them in this proceeding. The fact that the Committee does not specifically mention a given argument or reasoning does not mean that it has not considered it. In their submissions the Parties produced and cited numerous awards and decisions dealing with matters that they consider relevant to this Decision on Annulment. The Committee has also considered these documents carefully and may have taken into account the reasoning and findings of the Committees referred to during the proceeding as well as other committees on annulment. However, in coming to a decision on the matter of annulment raised by **Paraguay,** the Committee must perform, and in fact has performed, an independent analysis of the **ICSID Convention,** the **Arbitration Rules,** and the particular facts of this case.\n\n103.\n\nThe mission of *ad hoc* Annulment Committees has been defined clearly by many jurists that have dealt with this matter, by ICSID\u2019s jurisprudence and by ICSID itself, in the Background Paper on Annulment.\n\n104.\n\nIn the said Background Paper on Annulment, the ICSID Secretariat concluded that the drafting history of the Convention demonstrated that annulment of ICSID awards was designed as a limited remedy to safeguard against procedural errors in the decisional process98 and that it did not \"(...) *provide a mechanism to appeal alleged misapplication of the law or mistakes in fact\"99.*\n\nBackground Paper on Annulment, p.29, \u201872\n\nBackground Paper on Annulment, p.29, \u2018 73\n\n105.\n\nIn essence, there is a unanimous agreement that annulment is distinct from appeal100. The *ad hoc* committees are not courts of appeal and their task is not to harmonize ICSID\u2019s jurisprudence,101 or as the *M.C.I. Power v. Ecuador* annulment committee stated: \"[t]he annulment mechanism is not designed to bring about consistency in the interpretation and application of international investment law.\"102\n\nSchreuer, Christoph, et at, *The ICSID Convention, A Commentary,* Second Edition, Cambridge, 2011, pg. 901, 1(1(8-11; ICSID Background Paper on Annulment, pgs. 33-37; Schreuer, Christoph, \"From ICSID Annulment to Appeal Half Way Down the Slippery Slope\", *The Law and Practice of International Courts and Tribunals,* vol. 10, 2011, pgs. 211-215, pg. 212; Broches, Aron, \"Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States of 1965: Explanatory Notes and Survey of its Application\"; Van den Berg, Albert Ian, *Yearbook of Commercial Arbitration,* vol.

Republic of Ecuador* (ICSID Case No. ARB/03/6), Decision on Annulment, October 19, 2009,\u00b6 24\n\n106.\n\nFor these reasons, the Committee will not elaborate further on these matters, and will directly address the questions submitted to it, pursuant to Article 52 of the ICISD Convention, i.e.: (i) whether the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers and (ii) if the Award failed to state the reasons on which it is based.\n\n***Manifest Excess of Powers***\n-------------------------------\n\n107.\n\nAccording to Paraguay\u2019s submissions, the first manner in which the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers consisted in deciding the merits of a dispute over which it lacked jurisdiction, in light of the existence of an exclusive forum selection clause in the contract that favours the exclusive jurisdiction of Paraguayan courts.\n\n108.\n\nParaguay contended that under Article 52(1)(b) a Tribunal exceeds its power when it decides a dispute that the Parties have submitted to the jurisdiction of a different court or Tribunal103. Power is the question under Article 52(1)(b),104 and the Tribunal lacks power to reach a decision on a matter that was reserved to a different court105. This excess of power by the Tribunal was obvious and clear, and requires no further analysis106.\n\nTr., 9: 20-10:2\n\nTr., 15:16\n\nTr., 12:7-11\n\nTr., 16:10-14\n\n109.\n\nFurthermore, Paraguay expressed the view that, unlike a decision on the merits of a claim, a decision by a Tribunal to exercise jurisdiction that it lacks must be subject to annulment, even if the tribunal indicated an arguable basis to reach the merits107. Paraguay invoked support for the application of this standard on the *Vivendi* / Decision on Annulment and on Philippe Pinsolle\u2019s paper \"Manifest Excess of Powers and Jurisdictional Review of ICSID Awards\"108.\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6 43\n\nId., \u00b6 43, footnote 36\n\n110.\n\nFor SGS, on the other hand, the Tribunal\u2019s decision was based on the plain language of the BIT and cannot be considered a manifest excess of powers109. Annulment is only available in exceptional and highly limited circumstances and it is not the task of an *ad hoc* Committee to decide an issue on which there is disagreement between ICSID Tribunals or to harmonize ICSID jurisprudence110. Based on analysis by Commentators and on decisions of prior *ad hoc* Committees, SGS rejected Paraguay's argument that a different standard for manifest excess of powers applies to a Tribunal's decision on jurisdiction, because it does away with the *kompetenz-kompetenz* power of the Tribunal and deletes the qualifier \"manifest\" from Article 52(1)(b) of the ICSID Convention111.\n\nTr., 34:7-10\n\nTr., 30:6-10 and 30:21-31:1\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, 40-44\n\n111.\n\nPursuant to Article 52(1)(b) of the ICSID Convention, an award can be annulled whenever the Tribunal has manifestly exceeded its powers. Other Committees have understood annulment as limited in scope112. The excess of powers must be manifest, and thus must be easily perceived, self-evident and not result from extensive interpretation113.\n\n*Enron Creditors Recovery Corporation (formerly Enron Corporation) and Ponderosa Assets, L.P. v.

In other words, an Annulment Committee will not assess the correctness of the Tribunal\u2019s decision, even if it considers that it is incorrect115.\n\n*Victor Pey Casado and President Allende Foundation v. Republic of Chile,* (ICSID Case No. ARB/98/2), Decision on Annulment, December 18, 2012, \u00b6 70 (Quoting the decision of the Annulment Committee in *Klockner II*)\n\n*Helnan International Hotel A/S v.

Thus, even if a Tribunal exceeds its powers, the excess must be plain on its face for annulment to be an available remedy. Any excess apparent in a Tribunal\u2019s conduct, if susceptible of argument \u2018one way or the other\u2019, is not manifest.\n\nAs one commentator has put it, \u2018If the issue is debatable or requires examination of the materials on which the tribunal\u2019s decision is based, the tribunal\u2019s determination is conclusive\u2019\".\n\n*CDC,* referring to *Wena,* \u00b6 25, and M.B.

Under Article 41 of the ICSID Convention, the Tribunal shall be the judge of its own competence, and thus its decision on the scope of its jurisdiction cannot be reviewed *de novo* by an Annulment Committee117. This Committee agrees with others that have stated that nothing in the ICSID Convention indicates that a different standard shall be applied to issues of jurisdiction, and therefore an award can only be annulled if the lack or excess of jurisdiction was manifest118.\n\nBroches, Aron, \"Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States of 1965: Explanatory Notes and Survey of its Application\"; Van den Berg, Albert Jan, *Yearbook of Commercial Arbitration,* vol.

The Republic of Peru,* (ICSID Case No. ARB/03/4), Decision on Annulment, September 5, 2007,\u00b6101\n\n115.\n\nThis position was recognized by ICSID in the Background Paper on Annulment:\n\n\"At the same time, ***ad hoc*** Committees have acknowledged the principle specifically provided by the Convention that the Tribunal is the judge of its own competence. This means that the Tribunal has the power to decide whether it has jurisdiction to hear the parties\u2019 dispute based on the parties\u2019 arbitration agreement and the jurisdictional requirements in the ICSID Convention. In light of this principle, the drafting history suggests -and most ***ad hoc*** Committees have reasoned -that in order to annul an award based on a Tribunal\u2019s determination of the scope of its own jurisdiction, the excess of powers must be \u2018manifest\u2019. However, one ***ad hoc*** Committee found that an excess of jurisdiction or failure to exercise jurisdiction is a manifest excess of powers when it is capable of affecting the outcome of the case.\"119\n\nBackground Paper on Annulment, \u00b6 89\n\n116.\n\nThe Tribunal\u2019s Decision on Jurisdiction portrays the different positions that have been advanced on these issues by various tribunals. For example, it quotes the decisions of *SGS* v. *Pakistan, SGS v. Philippines* and *BIVAC v. Paraguay,* on the different approaches to the issue of the umbrella clause120.\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 169-171\n\n117.\n\nIn this case, the Tribunal was faced with the difficult decision concerning the distinction between treaty claims and contract claims, in order to determine if the existence of a forum selection clause in a Contract precluded its jurisdiction121. It decided that the claims advanced by SGS corresponded to treaty claims and therefore a contractual forum selection clause did not divest the Tribunal of its jurisdiction to hear claims for breach of treaty122. Based on this finding, the Tribunal assessed the scope of the BIT\u2019s Umbrella Clause and concluded that this clause established an international obligation for the parties to the BIT to observe contractual obligations with respect to investors123 and that, in consequence, it had jurisdiction over SGS\u2019s claims under Article 11 of the BIT124.\n\nId., \u00b6 125\n\nId., \u00b6 138\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction, 170\n\nIdem, \u00b6 171\n\n118.\n\nThe Tribunal could have decided that, according to the Agreement, it did not have jurisdiction and that the dispute should be resolved by the Asunci\u00f3n Courts; or it could have ruled that pursuant to the BIT, it had jurisdiction and, therefore, should decide the dispute submitted to its consideration. The Tribunal chose the second option.\n\n119.\n\nThe Members of this Committee may agree or disagree with the choice made by the Tribunal. However, for the purposes of this proceeding that agreement or disagreement does not have much relevance unless it can be shown that the Tribunal has manifestly exceeded its powers.\n\n120.\n\nAccording to Article 41 (1) of the ICSID Convention, the Tribunal had to define if it had or did not have jurisdiction. In doing so, it assessed the different submissions by the Parties and the possible positions it could take. Nothing in the Tribunal\u2019s analysis demonstrates that it manifestly exceeded its powers.\n\n121.\n\nThis Committee\u2019s responsibility is not to rule about the correctness of the Award. Its mission is simply to decide if any of the situations described in Article 52 of the ICSID Convention existed in this case.\n\n122.\n\nAccording to SGS the Tribunal\u2019s Decision was correct. In Paraguay\u2019s opinion, it was not. Regardless of what the correct answer is, it is obvious that by deciding in the manner that it did, the Tribunal did not incur in a \"manifest excess of powers\". It simply chose one of the alternatives that it had. In this connection, the Committee insists that for an excess of power to be \"manifest\" it has to be textually obvious and substantively serious.\n\n123.\n\nAt the hearing Paraguay stated that it would concentrate on the issue of whether the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers.\n\n124.\n\nParaguay\u2019s basic argument in this matter was that the tribunal\u2019s powers originate exclusively from the consent of the parties. Based on the decision rendered in *Helnan v. Egypt,* it affirmed that \"[t]he concept of the powers of a tribunal goes further than its jurisdiction and refers to the scope of the task which the parties have charged the tribunal to perform in discharge of its mandate, and the manner in which the parties have agreed that task is to be performed.\"125\n\n*Helnan,* \u00b6 41\n\n125.\n\nThe Tribunal had to decide if it had jurisdiction or not. As explained in paragraphs 117 and 118 above, the Tribunal ruled that it did have jurisdiction, pursuant to the BIT. Therefore, in this Committee\u2019s judgment, Paraguay\u2019s position alleging that the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers as described above is incorrect.\n\n126.\n\nParaguay insisted repeatedly on its argument that the Tribunal violated the forum-selection clause of the Contract and thus incurred in a manifest excess of its powers.\n\n127.\n\nParaguay broke down its forum-selection clause argument into the following parts (paragraph 53 above):\n\na) \"...the Tribunal ignored party autonomy by refusing to enforce the forum-selection clause\";\n\nb) \"The Tribunal's disregard of the forum-selection clause is completely inconsistent... with the internationally-accepted legal doctrine of *pacta sunt servanda.*\n\nc) \"...the Tribunal also disregarded the universally-accepted rules of legal interpretation, *generalia specialibus non derogant* and *lex specialis generalibus derogat\"126*\n\nTr., 18:6-7, 19:18-21, 21:6-9 and 22:3-6\n\n128.\n\nConcerning the forum selection clause, the Tribunal followed the reasoning of the *Vivendi I* Tribunal and Committee and concluded that the forum selection clause did not constitute a waiver to the investor\u2019s rights under the treaty and therefore could not prevent the investor from presenting claims under the BIT127. The Tribunal added that: \"[e]ven if the alleged breach of the treaty obligation depends upon a showing that a contract or other qualifying commitment has been breached, the source of the obligation cited by the claimant, and hence the source of the claim, remains the treaty itself\u2019128. This conclusion was premised on the existence of treaty claims that SGS could assert under the BIT129.\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 140\n\nId., \u00b6 142\n\nId., \u00b6 142\n\n129.\n\nAccording to Paraguay, the Tribunal disregarded the principles of *\"generalia specialibus non derogate* and *\"lex specialis generalibus derogate\".* The Tribunal was faced with the decision of determining which set of rules (the BIT or the Agreement) was particular to the situation submitted to it and, therefore, applicable. It decided for the BIT. That decision may be considered to be correct or incorrect, but it certainly does not constitute a valid basis to annul the Award.\n\n130.\n\nThis Committee cannot act as an appeals tribunal and review whether the interpretation of the umbrella clause and the forum-selection clause by the Tribunal were correct. The Committee could only annul the award upon verification of the existence of a manifest excess of powers on the part of the Tribunal, which can be easily perceived and does not require extensive interpretation of the Award to be perceived. This is not the case in the Tribunal\u2019s Award.\n\n131.\n\nParaguay asserted that the Tribunal also manifestly exceeded its powers by deciding SGS\u2019s claims on the merits, because a pure breach of contract by a State does not suffice to breach Umbrella Clauses and other BIT standards. According to Paraguay, only sovereign conduct can breach a BIT standard130.\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6 94\n\n132.\n\nSGS contended that the BIT\u2019s Umbrella Clause does not require the exercise of sovereign action and that neither the Tribunal, nor the Committee can read non-textual limitations into the clause131.\n\nTr., 41:10-17 and 42:4-8\n\n133.\n\nThe Tribunal addressed this issue in the Decision on Jurisdiction and in the Award. It acknowledged that some arbitral tribunals had deemed an abuse of sovereign powers necessary to breach an umbrella clause132, but decided to follow the reasoning of other tribunals, such as *Burlington Resources v. Ecuador* and *Duke Energy v. Ecuador,* and concluded that the Umbrella Clause could apply whether or not the exercise of sovereign powers was involved133.\n\nFor example, *Siemens v. Argentina* and *SGS v. Pakistan*\n\nAward, \u00b6 93; Decision on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 168-169\n\n134.\n\nIn the Committee\u2019s view, Paraguay\u2019s submission seeks that this Committee conduct a new analysis on the application of the Umbrella Clause. The scope of the Umbrella Clause is an issue over which there is much debate in international investment law, and the Tribunal decided to opt for one of the possible avenues of interpretation. Again, the Committee is not charged with analysing the correctness of the Tribunal\u2019s reasoning, but instead it must evaluate if the position held by the Tribunal exceeded the scope of its adjudicative power.\n\n135.\n\nThe Committee considers that the Tribunal\u2019s interpretation of the Umbrella Clause was exercised within the bounds of its power to determine its jurisdiction and thus did not involve a manifest excess of power.\n\n136.\n\nFor these reasons, the Committee concludes that the Tribunal did not manifestly exceed its powers and therefore the Award cannot be annulled on this ground.\n\n***Failure to State Reasons***\n------------------------------\n\n137.\n\nParaguay argued that the Award provides inadequate reasons that seriously affect its coherence, insofar as it did not conduct an independent treaty analysis of the contract as a whole134. Its reasoning also contradicts the distinction between treaty and contract claims contained in the Decision on Jurisdiction135.\n\nTr., 50:17-51:3\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6 114\n\n138.\n\nSGS submitted that the Tribunal asserted that the BIT and the Contract provided different basis for a claim. According to SGS, all of Paraguay\u2019s arguments were addressed by the Tribunal136 in a manner that satisfies the standard under Article 52(1)(e), which concerns failure to state reasons with respect to the Award and not failure to state correct or convincing reasons137.\n\nTr., 43:13-17\n\nTr., 44:4-9\n\n139.\n\nArticle 52(1)(e) enables a Committee to annul an award on the basis that it has failed to state the reasons on which it is based. ICSID\u2019s Background Paper on Annulment referred to decisions taken by other *ad hoc* Committees that \"... explained that this requirement is intended to ensure that parties can understand the reasoning of the Tribunal, meaning the reader can understand the facts and law applied by the Tribunal in coming to its conclusion. The correctness of the reasoning or whether it is convincing is not relevant.\"138\n\nBackground Paper on Annulment, p.29, \u00b6 106\n\n140.\n\nIn addition, prior Annulment Committees have recalled that the standard under Article 52(1)(e) is a minimum standard that allows a reasonable reader to understand the award139. As stated by the *MTD v. Chile* Annulment Committee: \"In the end the question is whether an informed reader of the Award would understand the reasons given by the Tribunal and would discern no material contradiction in them\"140.This ground for annulment only concerns the absence of reasons and not their quality or correctness141.\n\n*Wena,* \u00b6 79\n\n*MTD Equity Sdn Bhd. v Republic of Chile,* (ICSID Case No. ARB/01/7), Decision on Annulment, March 21, 2007, \u00b6 92\n\n*Compania Aguas del Aconquija S.A. & Vivendi Universal S.A. v. Argentine Republic,* (ICSID Case No. ARB/97/3), Decision on Annulment, July 3, 2002, 64-65; *CDC,* 70 and 75\n\n141.\n\nFurthermore, it is not necessary to state reasons for assertions that are in themselves reasons.142\n\n*Soufraki.'* \u00b6131\n\n142.\n\nThis is the standard of review that this Committee considers applicable. Moreover, in view of the settled doctrine on this issue, the Committee emphasizes that it will not enter into an assessment of the merits of the dispute, either directly or indirectly.\n\n143.\n\nIn paragraphs 167 to 170 of the Decision on Jurisdiction, the Tribunal explained clearly its interpretation of the Umbrella Clause contained in Article 11 of the BIT with respect to obligations originated in the Agreement and reached the conclusion that it had jurisdiction.\n\nThis conclusion was confirmed in paragraphs 72 to 74 of the Award. In paragraphs 173 to 184 of the Decision on Jurisdiction, the Tribunal explained its interpretation of the forum selection clause in the Agreement in relation with the BIT and reached the same conclusion with respect to its jurisdiction; paragraph 75 of the Award confirmed that conclusion. Whether Paraguay or this Committee agrees with the Tribunal's reasoning is irrelevant for the purposes of this proceeding and clearly does not constitute valid grounds for the annulment of the Award.\n\n144.\n\nIn the Award, the Tribunal stated:\n\n\"The Tribunal does not accept Respondent\u2019s argument. The law applicable to Claimant\u2019s claim is the BIT, including Article 11 of the BIT and the investor-state dispute settlement provisions in Article 9 of the BIT. Article 11 requires Respondent to observe its commitments with respect to Swiss investors. The \"commitment\" at issue in this dispute is the Contract. There is no dispute that the Contract requires payment in accordance with the invoicing procedures set forth therein and that Respondent has not paid the vast majority of the invoices SGS issued. In these circumstances, the Tribunal has no difficulty concluding that Respondent did not fulfill its contractual commitments.\"143\n\n\"Respondent argues that it cannot be found to have failed to observe its contractual commitments unless Claimant proves that Respondent has failed to meet its payment obligations under the Contract *and* frustrated the operation of the forum selection clause.\"144\n\nAward, \u00b6 101\n\nId., \u00b6 102\n\n145.\n\nThe Tribunal stated that Paraguay has not cited any legal authority to support this position145. It considered that, contrary to Respondent\u2019s arguments, the obligations in the Contract on payment and to provide access to local courts are not \"alternative options but two discrete obligations.\"146 The Tribunal concluded that \"[t]his cannot be correct. It cannot be that Paraguay had the option of either paying its invoices or submitting the dispute to local courts.\"147\n\nId., \u00b6 104\n\nId., \u00b6 105\n\nId., \u00b6 106\n\n146.\n\nFinally, the Tribunal characterized this argument as an attempt of the Respondent to discuss again arguments on jurisdiction, namely the absence of the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction on the basis of the existence of a forum selection clause in the Contract148. The Tribunal rejected this argument149.\n\nId., \u00b6 109\n\nId., \u00b6 109\n\n147.\n\nThe abovementioned sections of the Award show that the Tribunal provided reasons for its conclusions150. Such reasons can be followed by the reader from the starting point to its conclusion. The Tribunal's analysis departs from a characterization of the type of claim advanced by SGS and concludes that (i) the two obligations under the Contract are discrete and (ii) the insertion of a forum selection clause in the Contract could not negate Respondent's responsibility under the BIT.\n\nId., \u00b6\u00b6 101-109.\n\n148.\n\nConsequently, in the Committee\u2019s opinion the Award did not fail to express the reasons on which it is based.\n\n149.\n\nFor the above reasons the Committee will dismiss completely Paraguay\u2019s application for the annulment of the Award.\n\nIV **COSTS**\n------------\n\n150.\n\nPursuant to Article 52(4) of the ICSID Convention, Chapter VI of said Convention (Articles 59 through 61) shall apply *mutatis mutandis* to the proceedings before this Committee.\n\n151.\n\nArticle 61(2) of the ICSID Convention states:\n\n\"In the case of arbitration proceedings the Tribunal shall, except as the parties otherwise agree, assess the expenses incurred by the parties in connection with the proceedings, and shall decide how and by whom those expenses, the fees and expenses of the members of the Tribunal and the charges for the use of the facilities of the Centre shall be paid. Such decision shall form part of the award. \"\n\n152.\n\nThe Parties did not agree on a method for apportionment of costs different from that envisaged in Article 61(2) of the ICSID Convention.\n\n153.\n\nAlthough the Application of the Republic of Paraguay is being rejected in its entirety, the Committee does not consider the Application frivolous. Accordingly, exercising its discretion under Article 61(2) of the ICSID Convention, the Committee shall decide the following:\n\n(a) Paraguay shall bear the costs of the proceeding, comprising the fees and expenses of the Committee Members, and the costs of using the ICSID facilities; and\n\n(b) Each party shall bear its own legal costs and expenses incurred with respect to this annulment proceeding.\n\n**V DECISION**\n--------------\n\n154.\n\nFor the reasons set forth above, the Committee unanimously decides:\n\ni. To dismiss in its entirety the Application for Annulment of the Award submitted by the Republic of Paraguay.\n\nii. Each party shall bear its own legal costs and expenses incurred with respect to this annulment proceeding.\n\niii. The Republic of Paraguay shall bear the costs of the proceeding, comprising the fees and expenses of the Committee Members, and the costs of using the ICSID facilities."}]}
