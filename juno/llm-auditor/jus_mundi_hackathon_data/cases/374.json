On December 23, 2011, the Respondent requested an extension to submit its statement. On December 30, 2011, the Tribunal granted the requested extension, but only until Friday, February 3, 2012.\n\n[3].\n\nThe Tribunal did not receive the Parties' joint statement by the due date, i.e., February 3, 2012. Therefore, on February 7 and 9, 2012, the Tribunal renewed its request that the Parties should present a joint document addressing the first session agenda items without further delay.\n\n[4].\n\nThe Parties submitted their comments to the Draft Agenda on February 10, 2012 (Respondent) and February 20, 2012 (Claimants).\n\n[5].\n\nOn February 21, 2012, the Tribunal requested the Parties to confirm their agreement that the first session be held outside of the 60-day period prescribed in Arbitration Rule 13(1). On February 22, 2012, the Parties confirmed their agreement to extend the 60-day period by 60 additional days.\n\n[6].\n\nThe Tribunal prepared a procedural order taking into consideration the comments made by the Parties. On February 23, 2012, the Tribunal submitted the procedural order to the Parties in draft form and invited them to comment on it.\n\n[7].\n\nOn March 2, 2012, the Parties filed their comments on the draft procedural order. The Parties filed further comments on the draft order on March 7, 8, 19, and April 4, 2012.\n\n[8].\n\nOn March 30, 2012, the Respondent filed its preliminary objections to jurisdiction and its request for bifurcation. On April 13, 2012, the Claimants filed their response to the request for bifurcation. The Tribunal notes that these pleadings were filed in accordance with the schedule set by the Tribunal through correspondence with the Parties.\n\n[9].\n\nOn April 17, 2012, the Tribunal held its first session by telephone conference with the Parties, in accordance with Arbitration Rule 13. During that session, the Tribunal noted that the Parties, through their various prior comments, had reached agreement on most of the Draft Agenda items, leaving open for the Tribunal's decision only a few issues concerning time limits for pleadings and the question of bifurcation (item 13.2).\n\n[10].\n\nAfter consideration of the prior submissions of the Parties and deliberation among its Members, the Tribunal adopts and issues this Procedural Order which consolidates its rulings of March 6 and 12, 2012, records the areas of the Parties' agreement, and resolves the outstanding issues.\n\n**II.- PROCEDURAL ORDER**\n-------------------------\n\n**1. Constitution of the Tribunal and Tribunal Members' Declarations (Arbitration Rule 6)**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[11].\n\nThe Parties agree that the Tribunal was properly constituted on November 22, 2011.\n\n[12].\n\nThe Parties acknowledge that the Members of the Tribunal have signed the declarations required under Arbitration Rule 6(2) and that copies of the declarations have been sent to the Parties by the Secretary by way of letter dated November 22, 2011.\n\n**2. Representation of the Parties (Arbitration Rule 18)**\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n[13].\n\nThe Claimants are represented by, and all notices and communications addressed to the Claimants in connection with this proceeding shall be sent, to the following, and such other person as may be designated by the Claimants:\n\nPatrizia Di Nunno   \nAttorney at Law   \nVia Vittorio Venete, n. 108   \n25128, Brescia   \nItaly   \ndinunnopatrizia@virgilio.it\n\n[14].\n\nThe Respondent is represented by, and all notices and communications addressed to the Respondent in connection with this proceeding shall be sent, to the following and such other person as may be designated by Respondent:\n\nc/o Ms. Ledina Mandia   \nGeneral State Advocate   \nMinistry of Justice   \nTirana, Albania   \noltion.toro@avokaturashtetit.gov.al\n\nDr. Hamid Gharavi   \nDerains & Gharavi   \n25 Rue Balzac   \n75008 Paris   \nFrance   \nEmail: hgharavi@derainsgharavi.com\n\n**3. Applicable Arbitration Rules (Convention Article 44)**\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n[15].\n\nThe Parties agree that ICSID's Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings in force as of 10 April 2006 shall apply to this arbitration.\n\n**4. Place of Proceedings (Convention Articles 62 and 63; Administrative and Financial Regulation 26; Arbitration Rule 13(3))**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[16].\n\nThe Parties agree that the place of proceedings shall be Paris, without prejudice to the Tribunal holding sessions with the Parties at any other place with the Parties' agreement. The Tribunal may meet without the Parties at any place convenient to its Members.\n\n**5. Procedural Language (Arbitration Rules 20(1)(b) and 22)**\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[17].\n\n5.1 The Parties agree that the language of the proceedings shall be English. Therefore, there is no need for the Claimants to file correspondence and pleadings in Italian.\n\n[18].\n\n5.2 Any document filed in a language other than English must be accompanied by a translation. If the document is lengthy and relevant only in part, it is sufficient if only the relevant parts, which must be precisely specified, are translated.\n\n[19].\n\nThe Tribunal reiterates its request for professional quality translations. Translations need not be certified. Should a dispute arise about the accuracy of a translation, the parties shall seek first to resolve the matter between themselves, which may include obtaining certified translations. If such a dispute cannot be resolved, the matter shall be decided by the Tribunal.\n\n[20].\n\n5.3 If a witness or expert intends to give oral testimony in a language other than English, advance notice of at least four weeks shall be given to the ICSID Secretariat so that simultaneous interpretation into English can be provided. The costs of such interpretation shall form part of the costs of the proceedings.\n\n[21].\n\nIf the Claimants or their counsel require interpretation from English into Italian or Italian into English during the hearings, the Claimants shall, in consultation with the Secretary, arrange at their expense for simultaneous, not consecutive, interpretation. The costs of such interpretation shall be borne by the Claimants.\n\n**6. Apportionment of Costs and Advance Payments to the Centre (Convention Article 61; Administrative and Financial Regulation 14; Arbitration Rule 28)**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[22].\n\nThe Parties agree that they should contribute to the costs of the proceeding in equal parts, in accordance with Convention Article 61, Administrative and Financial Regulation 14, and Arbitration Rule 28, without prejudice to the Tribunal's decision on the apportionment of costs.\n\n**7. Fees and Expenses of the Tribunal Members (Convention Article 60; Administrative and Financial Regulation 14; ICSID Schedule of Fees)**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[23].\n\nThe Parties agree that the fees and expenses of the Tribunal shall be set in accordance with Article 60 of the Convention and Administrative and Financial Regulation 14 and are limited to what is provided in the Centre's prevailing fee schedule.\n\n**8. Presence and Quorum (Arbitration Rules 14(2) and 20(1)(a))**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[24].\n\nThe Parties agree that a quorum for any meeting or session of the Tribunal shall require the three Members of the Tribunal.\n\n**9. Decisions of the Tribunal by Correspondence (Arbitration Rule 16(2))**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[25].\n\nThe Parties agree that the Tribunal may take decisions, including on issues of procedure, by correspondence among its members or by any other appropriate means of communication, provided that all of its members are consulted.\n\n**10. Delegation of Power to Fix Time Limits (Arbitration Rule 26(1))**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[26].\n\nThe Parties agree that the Tribunal may delegate to the President of the Tribunal the power to fix time limits, if required.\n\n**11. Means of Communication and Copies of Instruments (Arbitrations Rules 20(1)(d) and 23; Administrative and Financial Regulation 24 and 30)**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[27].\n\nThe Parties agree that all communications with the Members of the Tribunal, outside of hearings, shall be through the Centre. Correspondence shall be submitted to the Centre by email, with simultaneous copies to the other Party. The Secretary shall acknowledge receipt and forward such correspondence to the Tribunal as soon as possible.\n\n[28].\n\nPleadings (i.e. written submissions other than correspondence) shall be filed by dispatching, on or before the date on which the filing is due, an original and four paper copies, as well as 4 CD-ROM, DVD-ROM, or USB flash drive copies, of the pleadings and all accompanying witness statements, expert reports, and exhibits for delivery to the Centre via an international express courier service.\n\n[29].\n\nIn addition, the submitting Party shall on the date of filing submit by email to the Centre and to the other Party electronic copies of the pleadings and any accompanying witness statements or expert reports (but not accompanying exhibits). The electronic copy of the pleading shall be a searchable copy.\n\n[30].\n\nWith respect to exhibits or other supporting documentation, a certified true copy may be filed with the Centre instead of an original. It is sufficient for the submitting Party to provide an umbrella certification with a pleading, certifying all copies of supporting documentation, to the best of its knowledge.\n\n[31].\n\nEach Party shall provide the other Party with one paper copy of the pleading and all accompanying witness statements, expert reports, and exhibits, as well as three CD-ROM, DVD-ROM, or USB flash drive copies of the same. These shall be sent to the addresses requested by the receiving Party.\n\n**12. Written and Oral Procedures (Arbitration Rules 20(1)(e) and 29)**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[32].\n\nThe Parties agree that the proceedings shall, unless otherwise agreed, consist of a written phase followed by an oral hearing before the Tribunal.\n\n**13. Number and Sequence of Pleadings, Time Limits, Supporting Documentation (Arbitration Rules 20(1)(c) and 31)**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[33].\n\n13.1 The written phase shall consist of the pleadings filed in the sequence described below.\n\n[34].\n\nA Party's responsive written submissions should generally be limited to responding to or rebutting maters raised by the other Party's first written submission. The paragraphs of written submissions shall be numbered.\n\n[35].\n\nSupporting documentation shall be filed together with the instrument to which it relates, and in any case within the time limit fixed for the filing of such instrument. All exhibits shall be sequentially numbered, with each Party using a single numbering series beginning with C-1 or R-1, respectively.\n\n[36].\n\nThe Parties are not required to submit copies of publicly-available investment treaty awards or decisions, International Court of Justice judgments, or other publicly-available international (i.e. non-domestic) legal authorities, so long as full citations to those authorities are included in the written submission, except that the submitting Party will furnish an electronic copy to the Tribunal or upon request of the other Party for a particular legal authority or authorities. The electronic copy will be provided by the submitting Party within two working days of the request.\n\n[37].\n\n13.2 Regarding the Respondent's request for bifurcation, the Tribunal believes that substantial questions on jurisdiction were raised, but that they are inextricably tied to issues of the merits (liability) and are best appreciated in that context.\n\n[38].\n\nTherefore, after deliberation among its Members, the Tribunal has decided to join the issue of jurisdiction to that of the merits (liability). However, given the significance of the jurisdictional questions, the Tribunal will defer consideration of damages until after it has reached a decision (or award) on jurisdiction and merits.\n\n[39].\n\nAccordingly, and taking into account the views of the Parties, the Tribunal modifies the sequence and timing of the proceedings as follows:\n\n|  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| **Date** | **Party/Tribunal** | **Description** |\n| 4 June 2012 | Claimants | Memorial on Jurisdiction and Merits (liability) |\n| 17 September 2012 | Respondent | Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction and Merits (liability) |\n| 22 October 2012 | Claimants | Reply on Jurisdiction and Merits (liability) |\n| 26 November 2012 | Respondent | Rejoinder on Jurisdiction and Merits (liability) |\n| 10 December 2012 | Claimants and Respondent | Witness and Experts Notification |\n| TBD | Presiding Arbitrator, Claimants and Respondent | Telephone conference regarding organization of Hearing |\n| 21-23 January 2013 |  | Hearing in Paris (to cover issues of jurisdiction and merits, but not damages) |\n\n[40].\n\nThe Tribunal will fix the damages calendar in due course, should it be necessary to reach that phase.\n\n[41].\n\n13.3 Extensions of time shall, upon the application of a Party before the expiry of a time limit, be granted by the Tribunal in exceptional cases only, as determined by the Tribunal at its discretion or as agreed between the Parties.\n\n**14. Witnesses and Experts; Written Statements and Reports (Arbitration Rules 35 and 36)**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[42].\n\nThe Parties agree as follows:\n\n(a) The Parties shall include with their written submissions not only their legal arguments, but also all of the evidence on which they intend to rely in support of the legal arguments advanced therein, including written witness statements, expert witness reports, documents, and all other evidence in whatever form. All witness statements or expert reports shall be signed by the submitting witnesses or experts and shall contain a disclosure of the relationship, if any, of such witness or expert to the Parties.\n\n(b) In any Reply or Rejoinder submissions, the Parties may include only additional written witness testimony, expert opinion testimony, documents or other evidence that respond to or rebut matters raised by the other Party's preceding submission.\n\n(c) The Tribunal shall not receive any documentary evidence that has not been introduced in writing and attached to the Memorial, the Counter-Memorial, the Reply or the Rejoinder, unless the Tribunal determines that exceptional circumstances are present that requires the admission of the additional evidence. A Party that considers such exceptional circumstances are present may request leave from the Tribunal to introduce the evidence. The requesting Party shall not introduce said evidence unless it has obtained express authorisation from the Tribunal.\n\n(d) The Parties shall submit any evidence in chief on which they may rely in the form of written witness statements, expert reports, and supporting documentation, in accordance with the time limits specified in Item 14 above (or as and when otherwise agreed or instructed by the Tribunal).\n\n(e) Before any hearing and within time limits to be agreed by the Parties or announced by the Tribunal, each Party shall have the right to call upon the other Party to produce at the hearing for cross-examination any witness or expert whose written testimony has been advanced. The Party whose witness or expert has been called for cross-examination must make the witness or expert available for the hearing. In the event of a failure to do so, without good cause, the Tribunal shall strike the witness's or expert's testimony from the record.\n\n(f) A Party that does not call for cross-examination of a particular witness or expert, whose evidence has been submitted by the opposing Party, shall not be deemed thereby to accept the evidence given in the relevant statement or report.\n\n(g) Written witness statements, expert reports, and supporting documentation shall stand as each Party's evidence in chief and, in the case of witness statements and expert reports, as the witnesses' or experts' direct examination.\n\nA Party may not examine its own witness or expert, except that, at any hearing the Party presenting a witness or expert who has been called for cross-examination by the opposing Party may conduct a very brief direct examination of the witness or expert (not to exceed 15 minutes, absent leave of the Tribunal).\n\n(h) A witness (other than a witness who is a representative or employee of a Party) or expert who will offer testimony at a hearing shall not be present in the hearing room prior to his testimony.\n\n(i) The Tribunal shall issue more specific directions concerning the order of proceeding for examination of witnesses and experts in advance of any hearing.\n\n**15. Records of Hearings (Arbitration Rule 20(1)(g))**\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n[43].\n\nThe Parties agree that verbatim transcripts and complete sound recordings shall be made for all hearings.\n\n[44].\n\nFor any substantive hearing, such transcripts shall be prepared on a same-day basis. In addition, the Parties may later agree that \"real time\" or \"LiveNote\" transcription be used.\n\n[45].\n\nFor any procedural hearing, such transcripts need not be prepared on a same-day basis. In addition, the Secretary of the Tribunal shall keep minutes of each procedural hearing in summary form, which shall be circulated to the Parties for review and comments prior to being submitted to the Tribunal.\n\n[46].\n\nThe costs of any transcripts and recordings shall form a part of the costs of the proceedings.\n\n**16. Pre-Hearing Conference (Arbitration Rule 21)**\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n[47].\n\nThe Tribunal proposes that a pre-hearing conference call be held at a time to be determined.\n\n**17. Dates of Subsequent Sessions (Arbitration Rule 13(2))**\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[48].\n\nThe Parties anticipate a hearing on January 21-23, 2013.\n\n**18. Publication of Decisions and Award (Arbitration 48(4))**\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[49].\n\nThe Parties agree to the application of Arbitration Rule 48(4)."}, {"Title": "Procedural Order No. 2 (Provisional Measures Concerning Security for Costs)", "Type": "Interim & Provisional Measures", "Date": "2012-05-03T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Procedural Order No. 2 (Provisional Measures Concerning Security for Costs)\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**I. PROCEDURAL HISTORY**\n-------------------------\n\n1.\n\nOn July 12, 2011, the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID) registered a Request for Arbitration submitted by Burimi S.R.L. and Eagle Games SH.A., (the \"Claimants\") against the Republic of Albania (the \"Respondent\"). The Request for Arbitration was filed on the basis of the dispute-settlement provisions of the Agreement for the Promotion and Protection of Investments (the BIT) between the Republic of Italy and the Republic of Albania.\n\n2.\n\nOn November 22, 2011, the Arbitral Tribunal was constituted in accordance with Article 37(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention. Its members are: Daniel M. Price (U.S.), President, appointed by the Chairman of the Administrative Council in accordance with Article 38 of the ICSID Convention; Bernardo M. Cremades (Spain), appointed by the Claimants; and Ibrahim Fadlallah (Lebanon/France), appointed by the Respondent.\n\n3.\n\nOn March 30, 2012, the Respondent filed a request for provisional measures concerning security for costs (the \"Respondent's Request\") pursuant to Article 47 of the ICSID Convention. On the same day, the Respondent submitted objections to jurisdiction pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule 41(1) and a request for bifurcation.\n\n4.\n\nPursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule 39(4), the Tribunal invited the Claimants to file their observations on the Respondent's Request by April 9, 2012. On April 3, 2012, the Claimants requested an extension to file their observations by April 13, 2012. On the same day, the Tribunal granted the extension.\n\n5.\n\nAccordingly, on April 13, 2012, the Claimants filed their observations (the \"Claimants' Observations\") on the Respondent's Request, as well as a counter-application for provisional measures concerning security for costs (the \"Claimants' Request\"). The Claimants also submitted their response to the Respondent's request for bifurcation on this date.\n\n6.\n\nOn April 17, 2012, the Tribunal held a first session with the Parties by telephone conference.\n\n7.\n\nPursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule 39(4), the Tribunal invited the Respondent to file its observations on the Claimants' Request by April 23, 2012.\n\n8.\n\nOn April 18 2012, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 1 and its Decision on Bifurcation.\n\n9.\n\nOn April 20, 2012, the Respondent filed its observations (the \"Respondent's Observations\") on the Claimants' Request.\n\n**II. PARTIES' POSITIONS**\n--------------------------\n\n**A. The Respondent's Request**\n-------------------------------\n\n10.\n\nThe Respondent argues that \"[e]xceptional circumstances exist that would justify the issuance of a recommendation granting security for costs in ICSID proceedings.\"1 It further contends that it \"would suffer irreparable harm should its request\u2026be denied.\"2\n\nRespondent's Request, para. 15.\n\n*Id*., para. 22\n\n11.\n\nRespondent bases its Request on the fact that the Claimants \"do not have sufficient funds to honour any resulting award on costs.\"3\n\n*Id*., para. 17 (\"It is precisely for this reason that the Republic of Albania is requesting security for costs\").\n\n12.\n\nFirst, it argues that Claimant I, Eagle Games Sh.a. (i) does not own any assets; (ii) never generated any profit during its entire existence; and (iii) has been under suspension since December 3, 2010.4\n\n*Id*., para. 19.\n\n13.\n\nSecond, it asserts that Claimant II, Burimi S.r.l. \"has never really generated any profits, which amounted to merely EUR 83 (eighty three) in 2008 and EUR 2,293 (two thousand two hundred ninety three) in 2009.\"5\n\n*Id*., para. 20.\n\n14.\n\nFinally, it avers that the Claimants' funds \"are likely not to be their own but those injected by Mr. Burimi and/or Ms. Leka, who are not parties to these proceedings.\"6\n\n*Id.*, para. 21.\n\n15.\n\nTherefore, the Respondent requests the Tribunal \"to order that Claimants provide security for costs, either in the form of deposit by Claimants in an escrow account supervised by the Tribunal or by the ICSID Secretariat, or alternatively, in the form of a guarantee, bond or similar instrument or in another form deemed appropriate by the Tribunal, in the amount of USD 400,000, representing the costs expected to be incurred by Respondent in defending against this action up to an Award on jurisdiction, and USD 1,000,000 should the matter proceed to the merits.\"7\n\n*Id*., para. 1.\n\n**B. The Claimants' Observations on the Respondent's Request**\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n16.\n\nThe Claimants object to the Respondent's Request, arguing that they have sufficient funds and assets.\n\n17.\n\nFirst, the Claimants have paid USD 125,000 (USD 25,000 of the administrative fee and USD100,000 of the first advance payment) to ICSID.\n\n18.\n\nSecond, Eagle Games Sh.a.'s 2010 balance sheet (exhibit R-13) shows that \"it has total assets of 13,614,761 Lek equal to EUR 96,527.67.\"8 The Claimants further argue that Eagle Games Sh.a.'s suspension of its business activities is \"solely because of the unlawful conduct of the Republic of Albania that has constantly blocked and prevented it to operate on the market.\"\n\nClaimants' Request (unnumbered pages and paragraphs).\n\n19.\n\nThird, Burimi S.r.l.'s balance sheet (exhibit R-14) illustrates that it has \"total assets of EUR 498,527.00, which for itself give more than enough warranty.\"9 Moreover, Burimi S.r.l. has paid twice the minimum EUR 10,000 of share capital required under Italian law for a corporate entity.10\n\n*Id*.\n\n*Id*.\n\n20.\n\nAccordingly, the Claimants request the Tribunal to dismiss Respondent's security for costs application.\n\n**C. The Claimants' Request**\n-----------------------------\n\n21.\n\nThe Claimants argue that their request is \"necessary\"11 because the Respondent has yet to pay the advance payment of USD 100,000 to ICSID. They further contend that the Tribunal needs to \"ensure the coverage of the arbitration award and court costs.\"12\n\n*Id*., penultimate paragraph (\"It is of patent evidence that the guarantees are *necessary\u2026\").*\n\n*Id*.\n\n22.\n\nTherefore, the Claimants request the Tribunal to order that the Republic of Albania \"deposit[] the security for the amount required by the claimants and therefore equal to EUR 7,593,863.75 (equal to $ 9,980,107.44) as well as $ 1,000,000 as an estimate of total expenditures in this proceeding, in the form of an escrow account to the order of the Court of Arbitration.\"13\n\n*Id*., last paragraph.\n\n**D. The Respondent's Observations on the Claimants' Request**\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n23.\n\nThe Respondent objects to the Claimants' Request because in its view \"there are no exceptional circumstances that create either a necessity, or an urgency to preserve Claimants alleged right for payment in case of a favourable monetary award being rendered.\"14\n\nRespondent's Observations, para. 7.\n\n24.\n\nMoreover, the Respondent argues that \"there cannot be any irreparable harm, a prerequisite to the issuance of any security, when a State potential debtor is concerned as the State necessarily has and will always have assets far in excess of the amounts at stake in this arbitration.\"15\n\n*Id*., para. 4.\n\n25.\n\nThe Respondent confirms that it paid its full advance on costs to ICSID on April 12, 2012, and that \"the (timely) payment - or non-payment for that matter \u2026 of its advance on costs is in and by itself utterly irrelevant for a decision on security.\"16\n\n*Id*., para. 6.\n\n26.\n\nFinally, it states that \"there is no legal ground or precedent, in commercial or public international arbitration\u2026for any such a measure [security for costs] against a Sovereign State before the issuance of any Award.\"17\n\n*Id*., para. 4.\n\n27.\n\nTherefore, the Respondent asks the Tribunal to dismiss the Claimants' Request.\n\n**III. TRIBUNAL'S ANALYSIS**\n----------------------------\n\n**A. Legal Framework**\n----------------------\n\n28.\n\nThe authority of ICSID tribunals to recommend provisional measures is governed by Article 47 of the ICSID Convention and Rule 39 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules.\n\n29.\n\nArticle 47 of the ICSID Convention provides:\n\n\"Except as the parties otherwise agree, the Tribunal may, if it considers that the circumstances so require, recommend any provisional measures which should be taken to preserve the respective rights of either party.\"\n\n30.\n\nRule 39(1) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules further provides that:\n\n\"At any time after the institution of the proceeding, a party may request that provisional measures for the preservation of its rights be recommended by the Tribunal. The request shall specify the rights to be preserved, the measures the recommendation of which is requested, and the circumstances that require such measures.\"\n\n31.\n\nRegarding the issue of costs, the following provisions are applicable. First, Article 61(2) of the ICSID Convention states that:\n\n\"In the case of arbitration proceedings the Tribunal shall, except as the parties otherwise agree, assess the expenses incurred by the parties in connection with the proceedings, and shall decide how and by whom those expenses, the fees and expenses of the members of the Tribunal and the charges for the use of the facilities of the Centre shall be paid. Such decision shall form part of the Award.\"\n\n32.\n\nFurthermore, Rule 47(1) of the Arbitration Rules provides:\n\n\"The Award shall be in writing and shall contain:\n\n[...]\n\n(j) any decision of the Tribunal regarding the cost of the proceeding.\"\n\n33.\n\nFinally, Regulation 14(3)(d) of the Administrative and Financial Regulations reads as follows:\n\n\"(d) in connection with \u2026every arbitration proceeding unless a different division is provided for in the Arbitration Rules or is decided by the parties or the Tribunal, each party shall pay one half of each advance or supplemental charge, without prejudice to the final decision on the payment of the cost of an arbitration proceeding to be made by the Tribunal pursuant to Article 61(2) of the Convention\u2026\"\n\n**B. The Requirements for Provisional Measures**\n------------------------------------------------\n\n34.\n\nProvisional measures are \"extraordinary measures\" which should be recommended only in limited circumstances.18 Specifically, an order for provisional measures will be made only where such measures are (i) necessary to avoid imminent and irreparable harm and (ii) urgent.19\n\n*Emilio Agust\u00edn Maffezini v. Kingdom of Spain* (ICSID Case No. ARB/97/7), Procedural Order No. 2 of October 28, 1999 [*Maffezini v. Spain*], para. 10.\n\n*See e.g.,* *Occidental Petroleum Corporation and Occidental Exploration and Production Company v. Ecuador* (ICSID Case No. ARB/06/11), Decision on Provisional Measures of August 17, 2007 [*Occidental v. Ecuador*], para. 59; *Perenco Ecuador Ltd v. Republic of Ecuador* (ICSID Case No. ARB/08/6), Decision on Provisional Measures of May 8, 2009 [*Perenco v. Ecuador*] para. 43; *Burlington Resources Inc. and others v.

Ecuador*], para. 51.\n\n35.\n\nMeasures are *necessary* when they are \"required to avoid harm or prejudice being inflicted upon the applicant.\"20 In assessing necessity, tribunals usually weigh the interests of both parties and order the measure only if the harm spared the petitioner \"exceeds greatly the damage caused to the party affected\"21 by it. Provisional measures are not meant to protect against potential or hypothetical harm that could be caused by future actions.22 Rather, they are meant to protect the requesting party from *imminent* harm.23\n\n*Burlington v.

Spain*, para. 10.\n\n**C. The Respondent's Request**\n-------------------------------\n\n38.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, the measure requested by the Respondent is neither necessary nor urgent.\n\n39.\n\nThe measure is not *necessary* because the harm it seeks to avoid is not imminent but contingent on future action or inaction by the Claimants, which the Respondent provides no persuasive evidence is likely to occur. Respondent \"believes\" that because the Claimants are legal persons \"with no real activity,\" and that the funds are \"likely not to be their own\", \"[t]hey *could* simply organize their bankruptcy when faced with an adverse award.\"26 The Tribunal is unwilling to find imminent danger of harm based on the Respondent's speculation about the Claimants' future conduct.\n\nRespondent's Request, para. 21.\n\n40.\n\nFor similar reasons, the matter is not *urgent*. Because the alleged harm is speculative, there is no basis for finding that the matter cannot await the outcome of an award.\n\n41.\n\nEven if there were more persuasive evidence than that offered by the Respondent concerning the Claimants' ability or willingness to pay a possible award on costs, the Tribunal would be reluctant to impose on the Claimants what amounts to an additional financial requirement as a condition for the case to proceed. Notably, there are no provisions in the ICSID Convention or the Arbitration Rules imposing such a condition, except the advance on costs under Administrative and Financial Regulation 14(3)(d). The Claimants met this requirement on January 11, 2012. After weighing the interests of both parties, the Tribunal rejects the Respondent's Request.\n\n42.\n\nThe Tribunal notes the Respondent's statement that \"exceptional circumstances\"27 exist and thereby \"security for costs should be granted by this Tribunal, *for the first time* in an investment dispute*.*\"28 The Tribunal would not shy away from ordering security costs for the first time, had the Respondent established that the circumstances of this case required the requested relief. Based on the facts presented, however, the Tribual does not find compelling reasons to depart from the previous rulings of ICSID tribunals denying security for costs requests.29\n\n*Id.*, para. 15.\n\n*Id.*, para. 23.\n\n*Atlantic Triton Company Limited v. People's Revolutionary Republic of Guinea* (ICSID Case No. ARB/84/1), Decision of December 18, 1984; *Inceysa Vallisoletana S.L. v.

Kingdom of Spain* (ICSID Case No. ARB/97/7), Procedural Order No. 2 of October 28, 1999.\n\n43.\n\nIn light of the above, the Tribunal concludes that the Respondent has failed to demonstrate that an order for security for costs is justified in the present circumstances. Accordingly, the Tribunal rejects the Respondent's Request.\n\n**D. The Claimants' Request**\n-----------------------------\n\n44.\n\nLikewise, in the Tribunal's view, the Claimants have not met the burden of demonstrating necessity. According to the Claimants, their Request is *necessary* because the Respondent has failed to pay the USD 100,000 advance on costs to ICSID.30 They further contend that \"[t]his circumstance by itself reveals the serious difficulties of the respondent that could vanish all the efforts made by the applicants in case the request is accepted.\"31\n\nClaimants' Request.\n\n*Id.*\n\n45.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that ICSID received the Respondent's payment on April 30, 2012. Therefore, the principal reason adduced by the Claimants for its requests is no longer present. In addition, as in the case of the Respondet's Request, the measures requested by the Claimants would protect against hypothetical harm (\"*could* vanish all efforts\") from uncertain, future actions, not imminent harm from actions likely to occur.\n\n46.\n\nFurthermore, the Tribunal finds that the measures requested by the Claimants are not *urgent* because they can wait until the award is rendered. According to the Respondent, \"there is no legal ground or precedent, in commercial or public international arbitration\u2026for any such a measure against a Sovereign State *before the issuance of any Award*.\"32 The Claimants have not cited legal authority in support of the urgency criterion. In the Tribunal's view, the Claimants failed to meet their burden to demonstrate that the requested measures are urgent.\n\nRespondent's Observations, para. 4.\n\n47.\n\nIn any event, the Tribunal has the discretion to decide how and by whom the expenses of the parties in connection with the proceedings shall be paid pursuant to Article 61(2) of the ICSID Convention. Such decision shall form part of the award. Therefore, the Tribunal finds that the measures requested by the Claimants are unwarranted at this stage of the proceeding.\n\n48.\n\nIn conclusion, the Tribunal finds that the Claimants have failed to demonstrate that their Request is justified in the circumstances. Accordingly, the Tribunal rejects the Claimants' Request.\n\n49.\n\nThe Tribunal acknowledges that non-payment of awards of damages or costs by respondents and claimants poses a systemic risk to the arbitration of international investment disputes. Too often, the rendering of an award results not in prompt payment but rather the beginning of a negotiation, or in some notable cases a willful refusal to honor the terms of the award and the provisions of the Convention. However, the Tribunal finds no reason in the circumstances of this case and at the present stage of this proceeding to intervene to ameliorate that systemic risk for the benefit of either party.\n\n**IV. ORDER**\n-------------\n\n50.\n\nOn this basis, the Arbitral Tribunal makes the following order:\n\na. The Respondent has failed to prove that the circumstances of this case require provisional measures for security for costs. Accordingly, the Tribunal rejects the Respondent's Request.\n\nb. The Claimants have failed to prove that the circumstances of this case require provisional measures for security for costs. Accordingly, the Tribunal rejects the Claimants' Request.\n\nc. The allocation of costs are reserved for a later decision or award.\n\nd.

Respondent**\n-----------------\n\n5.\n\nRespondent is the Republic of Albania and is hereinafter referred to as \"Albania\" or \"Respondent.\"\n\n6.\n\nRespondent is represented by Mr. Hamid Gharavi and Ms. Sophie von Dewall, of Derains & Gharavi, Paris, France.\n\n7.\n\nClaimants and Respondent are hereinafter collectively referred to as the \"Parties.\"\n\n**B. The Dispute**\n------------------\n\n8.\n\nOn December 1, 2000, the Albanian Government enacted Law No. 8701 on Gambling, Casinos, and Hippodromes (the \"Gambling Law\").3 This law introduced a new regulatory framework for the gambling industry and was aimed at reducing illicit gambling and associated practices.4\n\nExhibit R-6.\n\nExhibit R-20\n\n9.\n\nOn March 29, 2004, Eagle Games was founded by two Albanian nationals, Ms. Alma Leka and Mr. Artan Serjani.5 Each owned 50 percent of the shares in the company.6 Eagle Games' objective was to organize games of chance, mainly through the sale of \"scratch and win\" instant lottery tickets.7 Mr. Fatjon Luniku, also an Albanian national, was appointed General Director of the company.\n\nExhibits C-1 and C-2.\n\nExhibits C-1.\n\n*Id.* (\"The activity object of the company \u2018EAGLE GAMES' S.A. is the organization of the Lucky Games winning immediately.\").\n\n10.\n\nPursuant to the Gambling Law, Eagle Games had to obtain a gambling permit from Albania's Finance Ministry before commencing its activities.8 To obtain a permit, Eagle Games had to comply with the following criteria:9 (i) be a private company registered in the commercial register, (ii) have gambling activity as its statutory object, (iii) have its headquarters in Albanian territory, (iv) identify its founders, directors, and key personnel, (v) provide itself the total investment for its gambling business, and (vi) guarantee the prize money by freezing a certain amount in its bank account.\n\nExhibit R-6, Gambling Law, Article 6(1).\n\nExhibit R-5.\n\n11.\n\nOn April 6, 2004, Eagle Games was registered in Albania.10\n\nExhibit C-2.\n\n12.\n\nSoon thereafter, Eagle Games applied for a gambling permit. At that time, Eagle Games was an Albanian company, with two Albanian shareholders and an Albanian director.\n\n13.\n\nOn 18 June, 2004, the Finance Ministry granted Eagle Games a 10-year permit to organize instant lottery games.11 The permit fee was 10,000,000 Albanian Lek (\"ALL\") (80,334.19 euros [\"EUR\"]).12\n\nExhibit C-12.\n\nRequest \u00b6 13.\n\n14.\n\nAlbania submits that the permit provided nothing more than the legal framework within which Eagle Games was authorized to develop its gambling activities.13 For each instant lottery game that the company sought to introduce in the market, it had to meet certain conditions, namely: (i) the Gambling Commission needed to approve the standard and format of the tickets, and (ii) the Finance Ministry had to approve and supervise the printing of the tickets and control their distribution in the market.14\n\nCM \u00b6 50.\n\nExhibit R-6, Gambling Law, Article 6(5) and 6(6); CM \u00b6 50.\n\n15.\n\nAccording to Claimants, Eagle Games commenced its business activities at the end of September 2004.15 Respondent disputes this fact.16\n\nRequest \u00b6 14. According to Claimants, Eagle Games placed its first lot of instant lottery tickets in the market in late September.\n\nCM \u00b6 52.\n\n16.\n\nOn August 24, 2004, Ms. Alma Leka, a shareholder of Eagle Games, entered into a loan agreement (\"the financing agreement\") with Burimi SRL.17 The financing agreement was for an indefinite period of time. Under this agreement, Burimi SRL would finance all of the investments made by Ms. Alma Leka in Eagle Games. The agreement also distributed any prospective profits deriving from Eagle Games' operations as follows: 90 percent to Burimi SRL and 10 percent to Ms. Alma Leka.18 Burimi SRL would absorb all of the losses incurred by Eagle Games.\n\nExhibit C-4.\n\n*Id*.\n\n17.\n\nOn the same day, Ms. Alma Leka also entered into a \"pledge agreement.\"19 Under this agreement, Ms. Alma Leka pledged her shares in Eagle Games as a guarantee for Burimi SRL's financing of those shares.20 The term of this agreement was also for an indefinite period.\n\nExhibit C-5.\n\n*Id*.\n\n18.\n\nClaimants submit that pursuant to the financing and pledge agreements, Burimi SRL invested EUR 204,431.00 towards the development of Eagle Games.21\n\nExhibit C-6; Request \u00b6 7 and p. 6.\n\n19.\n\nOn September 9, 2004, Ms. Alma Leka and Mr. Artan Serjani each transferred 15 percent of their shares to Mr. Edmond Shoto, an Albanian national, notwithstanding Ms. Alma Leka's earlier pledge agreement and without any apparent consent of Burimi SRL. Thereafter, Eagle Games had the following structure: Ms. Alma Leka 35 percent, Mr. Artan Serjani 35 percent, and Mr. Edmond Shoto 30 percent.\n\n20.\n\nOn November 26, 2004, Eagle Games held a shareholders meeting. The company's board appointed Mr. Ilir Burimi, a national of Albania and Italy, as General Director, to replace Mr. Luniko. The board also authorized Ms. Alma Leka to represent the company in dealings with banks.22\n\nExhibit R-28.\n\n21.\n\nMr. Ilir Burimi and Ms. Alma Leka are brother and sister, a fact which Respondent has accused Claimants of having kept intentionally hidden.23\n\nRejoinder \u00b6 14.\n\n22.\n\nOn June 1, 2005, Eagle Games' board appointed Mr. Adrian Kosturi, an Albanian national, as its new General Director in replacement of Mr. Ilir Burimi. In addition, the company's board revoked Ms. Alma Leka's power of attorney and conferred these powers upon Mr. Adrian Kosturi.24\n\nExhibit R-29.\n\n23.\n\nOn July 4 and August 2, 2005, Eagle Games filed requests with the Gambling Commission25 and the Finance Ministry26 for the approval of the production of lottery tickets.\n\nClaimants refer to the Commission as the \"Directorate of Fortune Games.\"\n\nExhibits R-30 and R-31.\n\n24.\n\nIn September 2005, the new Albanian Government took office.27 Around the same time, the Trade Ministry28 was tasked with the supervision of games of chance, replacing the Finance Ministry.\n\nRequest, \u00b6 16.\n\nMinistry of Economy, Trade, and Industry. Also called the Ministry of Economics, Department of Trade and Industry.\n\n25.\n\nOn September 11, 2005, Eagle Games withdrew its July and August requests.29 It also asked the Finance Ministry to unfreeze ALL 5,000,000\u2014approximately USD 49,500\u2014that served as security for amounts due to prospective lottery winners.30\n\nExhibit R-32 **.**\n\n*Id*.; CM \u00b6 58.\n\n26.\n\nThe Parties disagree on the reasons behind the withdrawal. Claimants contend that \"since the beginning of the year 2005, the Albanian Ministry of Finance, do not conform to the law relating to the centralized printing of lottery tickets for all game of chance operators, preventing the issuance of new tickets by Eagle Games SH.A and preventing de facto the exercise of each activity.\"31 Respondent argues that Eagle Games withdrew the requests because of \" *internal reasons,* \" in particular, lack of funding. In doing so, it prevented the Gambling Commission and the Finance Ministry from responding to Eagle Games' petition.32\n\nRequest, \u00b6 15.\n\nCM \u00b6\u00b6 57-58.\n\n27.\n\nOn December 16, 2005, Eagle Games changed ownership and management once again. By resolution of its General Assembly, Mr. Artan Serjani and Mr. Edmond Shoto transferred their shares to Mr. Ilir Burimi.33 Thereby, Mr. Ilir Burimi became the majority shareholder of Eagle Games with 65 percent of the shares. Mr. Ilir Burimi was also reappointed General Director. Ms. Alma Leka was granted another special power of attorney to represent the company in dealings with banks.\n\nExhibit R-33. Claimants submit that the purchase of 65 percent of company shares was made by Mr. Ilir Burimi upon explicit request of Burimi SRL. (*See* Mem \u00b6\u00b6 9-10.)\n\n28.\n\nOn November 30, 2006, Eagle Games submitted a new request for approval of the printing of a lottery ticket named \"HAPPY NEW YEAR 2007.\"34\n\nExhibit R-34; CM \u00b6 62.\n\n29.\n\nIn December 2006, the Trade Ministry initiated the supervision of the games of chance.35 Claimants contend that Eagle Games' activity was blocked for more than one year because the Trade Ministry had not created the Gambling Commission in charge of authorizing the issuance of new tickets for games of chance.\n\nMem \u00b6 17.\n\n30.\n\nOn January 17, 2007, Eagle Games withdrew its November 2006 request, replacing it with a request for approval of an instant lottery ticket named \"FORTUNE WITH YOU.\"36\n\nExhibits R-34 and R-35.\n\n31.\n\nOn March 20, 2007, the Gambling Commission approved the ticket \"FORTUNE WITH YOU\" by Decision No. 5.37 According to Claimants, upon receipt of the Commission's approval, they \"began preparing the new tickets by investing large amounts of money [,..].\"38\n\nExhibit R-36.\n\nMem, \u00b6 21.\n\n32.\n\nOn or around that time, discussions took place in the Council of Ministers and Parliament about amending the Gambling Law.\n\n33.\n\nOn April 2, 2007, the Trade Ministry published on its website the main proposed amendments to the Gambling Law.39 These included the creation of a centralized National Lottery that would replace the multiple lottery companies.\n\nExhibit C-16.\n\n34.\n\nOn April 11, 2007, Eagle Games wrote to the Trade Ministry regarding its pending request for approval of the instant lottery ticket \"FORTUNE WITH YOU.\"40\n\n*Id.*\n\n35.\n\nOn May 4, 2007, the Trade Ministry informed Eagle Games that for the time being, its request would not be considered further because of the amendments proposed in the draft bill. The Finance Ministry also released Eagle Games' funds held as prize money of its \"FORTUNE WITH YOU\" game.41\n\nExhibit C-24; Request \u00b6 20; Mem, \u00b6 22.\n\n36.\n\nOn May 28, 2007, Albania adopted Law No. 9744 (the \"2007 Gambling Law\").42 The new law introduced a single license for the exploitation of the National Lottery. It also revoked all existing permits and licenses for instant lotteries, including Eagle Games' permit.43 The revocation of Eagle Games' permit is the subject of the present dispute.\n\nExhibit C-20.\n\n*Id*.\n\n37.\n\nArticle 20 of the 2007 Gambling Law provided that:\n\n\"1. [...] the state has the obligation to return to the entities the sums derived by such revocation.\n\n2. The Council of Ministers defines the criteria, method and form of compensation for these companies.\"44\n\n*Id.*\n\n38.\n\nOn June 23, 2010, the Finance Minister issued Order No. 21, setting out the criteria and method by which the affected companies had to apply for compensation.45\n\nExhibit C-9.\n\n39.\n\nOn August 25, 2010, Eagle Games wrote to Albania, disagreeing with the compensation that it would be entitled to pursuant to Order No. 21.46 According to Claimants, the compensation amounted to ALL 9,970,000, which was in their view \"essentially only the reimbursement of the cost of obtaining the license of ALL 10,000,000.\"47 Claimants further note that Albania \"has always rejected any request made [for compensation].\"48\n\nExhibit C-14; CM \u00b6 94.\n\nRequest \u00b6 27.\n\nRequest \u00b6 28.\n\n40.\n\nRespondent submits that Eagle Games did not apply for compensation and instead \"went straight to ICSID arbitration.\"49\n\nCM \u00b6\u00b6 68-69.\n\n**II. PROCEDURAL HISTORY**\n--------------------------\n\n41.\n\nOn June 16, 2011, Mr. Ilir Burimi, Burimi SRL, and Eagle Games SH.A (the \"Requesting Parties\") submitted a Request for Arbitration (the \"Request\") to ICSID.50\n\nRequest was accompanied by Exhibits C-1 to C-25.\n\n42.\n\nThe Request invoked the consent to ICSID arbitration contained in: (i) the Agreement for the Promotion and Protection of Investments concluded between the Republic of Italy and the Republic of Albania (the \"BIT\")51, which entered into force on September 12, 1991; and (ii) Albania's Foreign Investment Law No. 7764/93 (the \"FIL\")52, which entered into force on November 2, 1993.\n\nExhibit C-21.\n\nExhibits C-19 and R-4.\n\n43.\n\nOn the same day, ICSID transmitted a copy of the Request to Albania in accordance with ICSID Institution Rule 5(2).\n\n44.\n\nOn June 22, 2011, ICSID wrote to the Requesting Parties as follows:\n\n\"We note that the Request was submitted by (i) Mr. Ilir Burimi, (ii) Burimi SRL, and (iii) Eagle Games SH.A.\n\n(i) We understand from page 6 and exhibit 18 that Mr. Burimi is a dual national of Albania and Italy with his residence in Italy. In this respect, please note that, pursuant to the mandatory provisions of Article 25(1) and (2) of the ICSID Convention, jurisdiction under the Convention does not extend to \"any person who on either date [of consent or registration of a request for arbitration] also had the nationality of the Contracting State party to the dispute.\" It would therefore appear that Mr. Burimi is manifestly ineligible to appear as a party in this case.\"\n\n45.\n\nOn June 28, 2011, ICSID sought the following clarification from the Requesting Parties:\n\n\"You have not confirmed that Mr. Ilir Burimi is not a national of Albania. If Mr. Burimi had the Albanian nationality on the date of consent or date of the request for arbitration (i.e. on 15 June 2011 according to your letter of 27 June), Mr. Burimi would be ineligible as a party under the ICSID Convention. This is irrespective of the provisions of any other treaty or law because Article 25 of the Convention is mandatory. Therefore, the Request for Arbitration would be manifestly outside ICSID's jurisdiction regarding Mr. Burimi.\"\n\n46.\n\nOn July 1, 2011, ICSID wrote to the Requesting Parties indicating that \"[u]nless you confirm that Mr. Ilir Burimi is not a national of Albania, the Request for Arbitration would be manifestly outside ICSID's jurisdiction regarding Mr. Burimi.\"\n\n47.\n\nOn July 6, 2011, Mr. Ilir Burimi withdrew his Request, stating that:\n\n\"In relation to these proceedings, took note of your position in relation to Mr. [Ilir] Burimi [...], who, besides being an Italian citizen is also a citizen of Albania, today's defense waives the instance of Mr. [Ilir] Burimi, requesting that the arbitration procedure must be recorded in favor of the companies Eagle Games Sh.a and Burimi SRL.\"\n\n48.\n\nOn the same day, ICSID took note of Mr. Ilir Burimi's withdrawal as a Requesting Party.\n\n49.\n\nOn July 12, 2011, the Secretary-General of ICSID registered the Request (of Burimi SRL and Eagle Games SH.A) in accordance with Article 36 of the ICSID Convention. In the Notice of Registration, the Secretary-General invited the Parties to proceed to constitute an Arbitral Tribunal as soon as possible in accordance with Articles 37 to 40 of the ICSID Convention.\n\n50.\n\nIn the absence of an agreement between the Parties, Claimants elected to submit the arbitration to a Tribunal constituted of three arbitrators, as provided in Article 37(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention.\n\n51.\n\nOn September 23, 2011, Prof. Bernardo M. Cremades, a national of Spain, accepted his appointment by Claimants. On October 4, 2011, Prof. Ibrahim Fadlallah, a national of Lebanon and France, accepted his appointment by Respondent. On November 22, 2011, Mr. Daniel M. Price, a national of the United States, accepted his appointment as Tribunal President by the Chairman of the Administrative Council in accordance with Article 38 of the ICSID Convention.\n\n52.\n\nOn November 22, 2011, the Secretary-General, in accordance with Rule 6(1) of the ICSID Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings (the \"Arbitration Rules\") notified the Parties that the Tribunal was deemed to have been constituted on that date. Mr. Marco Tulio Monta\u00f1\u00e9s-Rumayor, ICSID Legal Counsel, was designated to serve as Secretary of the Tribunal.\n\n53.\n\nImmediately thereafter, the Tribunal circulated the first session's provisional agenda, inviting the Parties to agree on the items contained therein.\n\n54.\n\nOn December 23, 2011, Respondent requested a 60-day extension to comment on the provisional agenda.\n\n55.\n\nOn December 30, 2011, the Tribunal granted the extension but only until February 3, 2012.\n\n56.\n\nOn February 22, 2012, the Parties agreed to hold the first session outside of the 60-day period prescribed in Arbitration Rule 13(1), extending the 60-day period by 60 additional days.\n\n57.\n\nOn February 23, 2012, Respondent informed ICSID that it had instructed Mr. Hamid Gharavi of Derains & Gharavi to represent it in this proceeding.\n\n58.\n\nOn March 30, 2012, Respondent filed objections to jurisdiction pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule 41(1) and a request for bifurcation. It also submitted a request for provisional measures concerning security for costs pursuant to Article 47 of the ICSID Convention.\n\n59.\n\nOn the same date, the Tribunal invited Claimants to file their observations on both of Respondent's requests by April 9, 2012.\n\n60.\n\nOn April 3, 2012, Claimants requested an extension to file their observations by April 13, 2012. The Tribunal granted the extension on the same day.\n\n61.\n\nOn April 13, 2012, Claimants filed their response to the request for bifurcation. They also submitted observations on Respondent's provisional measures request, as well as a counterapplication for provisional measures concerning security for costs.\n\n62.\n\nOn April 17, 2012, the Tribunal held a first session by telephone conference with the Parties. During that session, the Tribunal noted that the Parties, through their various prior comments, had reached agreement on most of the Draft Agenda items, leaving open for the Tribunal's decision only a few issues concerning time limits for pleadings and the question of bifurcation.\n\n63.\n\nOn April 18, 2012, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 1 which recorded the Parties' agreements and resolved the outstanding first session matters. It also ruled on the Respondent's request for bifurcation, holding that:\n\n\"...the Tribunal believes that substantial questions on jurisdiction were raised, but that they are inextricably tied to issues of the merits (liability) and are best appreciated in that context.\n\nTherefore, after deliberation among its Members, the Tribunal has decided to join the issue of jurisdiction to that of the merits (liability).\n\nHowever, given the significance of the jurisdictional questions, the Tribunal will defer consideration of damages until after it has reached a decision (or award) on jurisdiction and merits.\"53\n\nProcedural Order No. 1, item 13.2.\n\n64.\n\nOn April 20, 2012, Respondent filed its observations on Claimants' counter-application for provisional measures concerning security for costs.\n\n65.\n\nOn May 3, 2012, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 2, denying the Parties' requests for provisional measures concerning security for costs.\n\n66.\n\nOn June 4, 2012, Claimants filed a memorial on jurisdiction and merits (liability). [\"Memorial\" or \"Mem\"].54\n\nAccompanied by Exhibits C-28 to C-33.\n\n67.\n\nOn September 17, 2012, Respondent filed a counter-memorial on jurisdiction and merits (liability) [\"Counter-Memorial\" or \"CM\"].55\n\nAccompanied by Exhibits R-15 to R-43 and Legal Authorities R-L1 to R-L10.\n\n68.\n\nOn October 17, 2012,56 Claimants filed their reply on jurisdiction and merits (liability) [\"Reply\"].57\n\nAlthough the Memorial was dated October 17, 2013 it was not transmitted to ICSID until October 22, 2013.\n\nAccompanied by Exhibit C-34.\n\n69.\n\nOn November 28, 2012, Respondent filed its Rejoinder on jurisdiction and merits (liability) [\"Rejoinder\"].58\n\nAccompanied by Exhibits R-44 to R-51 and the Legal Expert Opinions of Mr. Neritan Kallfa and Mr. Besnik Cobaj.\n\n70.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that written pleadings were submitted by Claimants in Italian, not an official language of ICSID. The English translations bordered on incomprehensible, despite repeated requests from the Secretariat for the submission of professional translations. It struck the Tribunal at times that the pleadings had been translated from Italian to English using a web-based translation service. The poor quality of Claimants' English language pleadings posed great difficulties for the Tribunal in understanding the arguments advanced and for Respondent in formulating its rebuttal arguments.\n\n71.\n\nOn December 12, 2012, the Tribunal ruled on an exchange between the parties concerning Claimants' intention to call for direct examination witnesses who had not submitted witness statements. The Tribunal held that no such witness testimony could be heard because Claimants' request ran contrary to the clear terms of the parties' agreements as reflected in Procedural Order No. 1 (see in particular item No. 14). The Tribunal decided that to hear such witnesses would be not only contrary to the Procedural Order, but also prejudicial to Respondent, which would not be in a position to prepare cross-examination.\n\n72.\n\nOn December 18, 2012, Claimants requested that the Tribunal (i) reconsider its Decision of December 12, 2012 not to allow oral testimony at the hearing of witnesses who had not submitted written statements, and (ii) exclude Respondent's expert reports submitted with its Rejoinder.\n\n73.\n\nOn December 20, 2012, Respondent objected to both of the above requests.\n\n74.\n\nOn January 8, 2013, the President of the Tribunal, on behalf of the Tribunal, convened a telephone conference with the Parties to discuss (i) outstanding procedural matters, (ii) issues relating to the hearing, and (iii) financial matters.\n\n75.\n\nDuring the conference call, Claimants renewed their request (first stated in their Reply of October 17, 2012) for an in-person pre-hearing conference under Arbitration Rule 21(2) to seek an amicable settlement of the dispute. Respondent objected to this request both in its Rejoinder of November 28, 2012 and during the conference call.\n\n76.\n\nOn January 9, 2013, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 3, which addressed outstanding procedural matters. First, regarding the request for reconsideration, the Tribunal confirmed its Decision of December 12, 2012 and held that \"it will not permit the Claimants to present and examine witnesses at the hearing who have not previously submitted written statements as required by Procedural Order No. 1.\"59\n\nProcedural Order No. 3, item 1(a).\n\n77.\n\nSecond, regarding the request for exclusion of Respondent's expert reports, the Tribunal denied the request. The Tribunal concluded that the expert reports submitted by Respondent with its Rejoinder were \"admissible because they are responsive to arguments made by the Claimants in their Reply of October 17, 2012.\"60\n\n*Id*., item 1(b).\n\n78.\n\nFinally, regarding the request for a pre-hearing conference, the Tribunal noted that Respondent did not join in Claimants' request. Therefore, the Tribunal denied the request because there was no \"request of the parties\" as called for by Arbitration Rule 21(2).61\n\n*Id*., item 1(c).\n\n79.\n\nOn January 21, 2013, a hearing on jurisdiction and merits (liability) was held in Paris, France. In addition to the Members of the Tribunal and the Secretary of the Tribunal, present at the hearing were:\n\nFor Claimants:\n\nMs. Patrizia Di Nunno Attorney-at-law\n\nMr. Italo Moreschi Attorney-at-law\n\nMr. Denny Iacobazzi Attorney-at-law\n\nFor Respondent:\n\nDr. Hamid Gharavi Derains & Gharavi\n\nMs. Sophia von Dewall Derains & Gharavi\n\nMrs. Carmela Viccaro Derains & Gharavi\n\nMrs. Ledina Mandia State Attorney General, Albania\n\nMr. Armer Juka State Attorney, Albania\n\n80.\n\nMr. Moreschi presented oral arguments on behalf of Claimants. Mr. Gharavi and Ms. von Dewall presented oral arguments on behalf of Respondent.\n\n81.\n\nThe hearing was sound recorded and transcribed *verbatim*, and copies of the sound recordings and the transcripts were subsequently delivered to the Parties.\n\n82.\n\nOn January 28, 2013, Respondent filed minor corrections to the hearing transcript. Claimants did not file any corrections.\n\n83.\n\nOn January 31, 2013, Respondent filed its statement on costs.\n\n84.\n\nOn February 5, 2013, Claimants filed their statement on costs.\n\n85.\n\nThe Tribunal has deliberated and carefully considered the arguments presented by the Parties. The Tribunal shall now proceed to summarize the Parties' positions (Part III), to analyze the arguments behind those positions (Part IV), and finally, on the basis of its analysis, to render its Award (Part V).\n\n**III. SUMMARY OF THE PARTIES' CONTENTIONS AND RELIEF SOUGHT**\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**A. The Claims**\n-----------------\n\n86.\n\nClaimants submit that Respondent has effectively prevented Eagle Games from carrying out its business.62 In particular, Claimants contend that Albania, through its different instrumentalities\u2014the Finance Ministry, the Trade Ministry, and the Gambling Commission, among others\u2014 (i) blocked and delayed Eagle Games from issuing new tickets, (ii) failed to promptly create the government entity in charge of authorizing the issuance of tickets, (iii) changed the regulatory framework governing the games of chance sector, and finally, (iv) revoked Eagle Games' permit in 2007.63\n\nRequest \u00b6 21.\n\n*Id*. \u00b6\u00b6 16-23; Mem, unpaginated.\n\n87.\n\nAs a result of the above measures, Claimants request that the Tribunal:\n\n1. Declare that Albania expropriated the investments of Eagle Games and Burimi SRL, in violation of BIT Article 5, FIL Article 4, and customary international law;\n\n2. Declare that Albania breached the minimum standard of treatment pursuant to FIL Article 2(3); and thus\n\n3. Award compensation to Claimants in the sum of ALL 1,034,794.456 (approximately USD 10,244,465, corresponding to the company's actual value on December 31, 2004 (ALL 803,111,584 or approximately USD 8 million), plus interest from January 1, 2005 to December 31, 2009 (ALL 231,682,872 or approximately USD 2.4 million).64\n\n*Id*. pp. 13-15.\n\n88.\n\nAlbania contends that the revocation of Eagle Games' gambling permit was fully justified as a matter of public policy.65 It also denies the rest of the claims on the merits. Finally, it challenges ICSID jurisdiction.\n\nCM \u00b6\u00b6 66-70.\n\n**B. The Objections to Jurisdiction**\n-------------------------------------\n\n89.\n\nAlbania advances the following objections to jurisdiction:\n\n1. Eagle Games is an Albanian company owned by Albanian nationals and does not qualify as a national \"of a Contracting State other than the State party to the dispute\";\n\n2. Burimi SRL is owned by Mr. Ilir Burimi, who is a national of both Albania and Italy; therefore, Burimi SRL is an Albanian company;\n\n3. Burimi SRL has not made an \"investment\" in Albania and is not an \"investor\";\n\n4. Claimants failed to comply with the best efforts negotiation provisions of the BIT and FIL.\n\n90.\n\nTherefore, Albania asks the Tribunal:\n\n\"To declare that Eagle Games and Burimi S.r.l., individually and/or collectively, lack standing before this Tribunal, and to reject all of their claims for lack of jurisdiction *ratione personae* and/or *ratione materiae*, as the case may be, accordingly.\"66\n\n*Id.* \u00b6449.\n\n91.\n\nThe Tribunal will refer to the Parties' positions in more detail in the course of its analysis.\n\n**IV. ANALYSIS**\n----------------\n\n**A. Law Applicable to the Jurisdiction of the Tribunal**\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n92.\n\nJurisdiction is governed by the relevant provisions of the (i) ICSID Convention and Rules, (ii) BIT, and (iii) FIL.\n\n93.\n\nArticle 25 of the ICSID Convention provides that:\n\n(1) The jurisdiction of the Centre shall extend to any legal dispute arising directly out of an investment, between a Contracting State (or any constituent subdivision or agency of a Contracting State designated to the Centre by that State) and a national of another Contracting State, which the parties to the dispute consent in writing to submit to the Centre. When the parties have given their consent, no party may withdraw its consent unilaterally.\n\n(2) \"National of another Contracting State\" means:\n\n(a) any natural person who had the nationality of a Contracting State other than the State party to the dispute on the date on which the parties consented to submit such dispute to conciliation or arbitration as well as on the date on which the request was registered pursuant to paragraph (3) of Article 28 or paragraph (3) of Article 36, but does not include any person who on either date also had the nationality of the Contracting State party to the dispute; and\n\n(b) any juridical person which had the nationality of a Contracting State other than the State party to the dispute on the date on which the parties consented to submit such dispute to conciliation or arbitration and any juridical person which had the nationality of the Contracting State party to the dispute on that date and which, because of foreign control, the parties have agreed should be treated as a national of another Contracting State for the purposes of this Convention.\n\n94.\n\nArticles 1 and 8 of the BIT read as follows:67\n\n**Article 1: Definitions**\n\n[\u2026]\n\n1. The term \"investment\" means, whatever the legal form chosen by the legal and reference, every asset invested by investors of one Contracting Party in the territory of the other, in accordance with the laws and regulations of the latter.\n\nIn this context of a general nature, the term investment shows in particular but not exclusively:\n\n(a) movable and immovable property and any real right, including, as it can be invested, mortgages, liens and privileges;\n\n(b) shares, bonds, shares and any other instruments of credit;\n\n(c) claims to money or any right arising from commitments or services having an economic value and an investment, as well as income reinvested;\n\n(d) intellectual property rights and hence the industry, including copyrights, trademarks, patents, industrial designs and know-how, trade secrets, business, trade names, goodwill and other similar rights;\n\n(e) any economic rights conferred by law, contract, license or administrative action including prospecting, cultivation, extraction and exploitation of natural resources.\n\n2. The term \"investor\" means a natural person or legal entity of a Contracting Party which has made, granted or assumed to have obtained any necessary authorization, irrevocable obligation to make investments in the territory of the other Contracting Party shall, in accordance with the laws and regulations of the latter.\n\n[\u2026]\n\n3. The term \"income\" means fees that are derived from an investment, especially profits, interest, capital gains, dividends, royalties and other income from investments.\n\n[\u2026]\n\n**Article 8: Regulation of disputes between investors and one of the Contracting Parties**\n\n1. Any dispute concerning investments arising between an investor and the other Contracting Party, including disputes concerning compensation for expropriation, nationalization, requisition and similar measures should be, wherever possible, resolved amicably.\n\n2. If the dispute cannot be settled amicably within six months from the date of a request made in writing, the investor may, as its option, submit:\n\n(a) [\u2026]\n\n(b) [\u2026]\n\n(c) The International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes relating to Disputes (ICSID) for the application of arbitration and conciliation procedures under the Washington Convention 18 March 1965 on \"Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States\" as soon as the contracting parties had validly accepted both, or of regulations concerning the \"mechanisms\" for the additional settlement of the arbitration of the International Center said.\n\nFor the purposes of Article 25 of the Washington Convention March 18, 1965 and as of the date on which this will be applicable for both Contracting Parties, a company having legal nationality of a Contracting Party to the dispute, but with a majority of capital owned by investors of the other Contracting Party or other third party, will be considered as having the nationality of the latter.\n\n[\u2026].\n\nExhibit C-21.\n\n95.\n\nArticles 1 and 8 of the FIL provide in the relevant part:68\n\n**Article 1: General Provisions**\n\nFor the purpose of this law [\u2026]:\n\n- \"Foreign investor\" means:\n\n(a) Any natural entity who is a citizen of a foreign country, or\n\n(b) Any natural entity who is a citizen of the Republic of Albania, but who resides outside the country, or\n\n(c) Any legal entity established in accordance with the law of a foreign country, who directly or indirectly seeks to carry out or is carrying out an investment in the territory of the Republic of Albania in conformity with its laws, or has carried out an investment in conformity with its laws during the period from 31.07.1990 in continuation.\n\n- \"Foreign investment\" means any kind of investment in the territory of the Republic of Albania, performed directly or indirectly by a foreign investor that consists of:\n\n(a) Movable or immovable, tangible or intangible assets, or any other kind of ownership;\n\n(b) A company, rights that derive from any kind of participation in a company, by stock shares etc.;\n\n(c) Loans, monetary obligations or obligations in an activity of an economic value and related to an investment;\n\n(\u00e7) Intellectual property, including literary and artistic, scientific and technological products, audio recording, inventions, industrial designs, schemes of integrated circles, know how, trademarks, designs of trademarks and trade names;\n\n(d) Any right recognized by law or contract, and any license or permission issued in accordance with the laws.\n\n- \"Dispute over foreign investment\" means every disagreement or presumption caused by a foreign investment or that relates to it.\n\n- \"Revenue\" means an amount of money that derives from or is associated with an investment, including profit, dividend, interest, reinvestment of the capital, costs of direction and administration, costs of technical assistance or other costs or contributions in kind.\n\n[...]\n\n**Article 8: Dispute Resolution**\n\n[\u2026]\n\n2. If a dispute about a foreign investment arises between a foreign investor and the Albanian public administration, which has not been settled through an agreement, the foreign investor may submit the dispute for resolution to a competent court or arbitrator of the Republic of Albania, according to its laws. If the dispute relates to expropriation, compensation for expropriation or discrimination, as well as to transfers as provided in article 7 of this law, the foreign investor may submit the dispute for resolution to the International Center [ **sic** ] for the Settlement of Investment Disputes (\"Center\" [ **sic** ]), established by the Convention for the settlement of investment disputes between the states and citizens of other states, approved in Washington, on 18 March 1965.\n\n3. [\u2026].\n\nExhibit C-19.\n\n**B. The Objections to Jurisdiction**\n-------------------------------------\n\n96.\n\nTo summarize, Respondent argues that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction: (i) *ratione personae* with respect to the claims of Eagle Games; and (ii) *ratione personae* and *ratione materiae* with respect to the claims of Burimi SRL. Respondent further argues that the claim is inadmissible because Claimants failed to comply with the best efforts negotiation provisions of the BIT and FIL.\n\n**1. Whether there is jurisdiction** ***ratione personae*** **with respect to the claims of Eagle Games**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**(i) Claimants' Position**\n---------------------------\n\n97.\n\nClaimants argue that Eagle Games has standing before this Tribunal because it is an \"investor\" as defined in Article 1 of the BIT and the FIL.\n\n98.\n\nMoreover, Claimants contend that Eagle Games has standing pursuant to ICSID Convention Article 25(2)(b). According to Claimants, although Eagle Games is an Albanian company, it should be treated as under the control of the Italian company Burimi SRL because Mr. Ilir Burimi, the General Director and sole shareholder of Burimi SRL, holds 65 percent of the shares in Eagle Games.69\n\nRequest \u00b6\u00b6 9-10 and pp. 5-8.\n\n99.\n\nTherefore, Claimants conclude that the Tribunal has jurisdiction *ratione personae* with respect to the claims of Eagle Games.\n\n**(ii) Respondent's Position**\n------------------------------\n\n100.\n\nRespondent argues that this Tribunal has no jurisdiction with respect to the claims of Eagle Games under the first or second clauses of ICSID Convention Article 25(2)(b), and that Burimi SRL does not own the 65 percent shareholding in Eagle Games.\n\n101.\n\nFirst, there is no jurisdiction under the first clause of Article 25(2)(b) because Eagle Games is an Albanian company.70 As such, it does not qualify as a national \"of a Contracting State other than the State party to the dispute\" (i.e., Albania).\n\nCM \u00b6 101 (\"It is a matter of fact and record that Eagle Games, the company holding the gambling permit, is a company incorporated under Albanian Law\").\n\n102.\n\nRespondent further contends that Article 8(2)(c) of the BIT does not alter Eagle Games' Albanian nationality for purposes of the ICSID Convention.71 The majority of Eagle Games' capital is owned by Mr. Ilir Burimi, an Albanian national and the company's ultimate beneficial owner.72 Therefore, Eagle Games is an Albanian national under the first clause of Article 25(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention, notwithstanding that Mr. Ilir Burimi is also an Italian national.\n\n*Id.* \u00b6\u00b6 102-104.\n\nId.\n\n103.\n\nSecond, there is no jurisdiction under Article 25(2)(b) second clause given that the parties did not agree to treat Eagle Games as a non-Albanian national \"because of foreign control.\"73 According to Respondent \"[n]o such consent is included in the provisions of the BIT (or the FIL for the matter), whereby it is noted that the \"nationality\" stipulation in Article 8(2)(c) of the BIT [...] for the purposes of the first clause of Article 25(2)(b) of the ICSID, must not be confused with a specific agreement concerning host State nationals for purposes of the second clause of Article 25(2)(b) of the ICSID\" Convention.74\n\n*Id.* \u00b6\u00b6 105-107.\n\n*Id.* \u00b6 106 (*emphasis omitted*).\n\n104.\n\nMoreover, Albania argues that even if the \"foreign control\" exception applied, Eagle Games still would not qualify as a non-Albanian national because its shares are held by two Albanian nationals as follows: 65 percent by Mr. Ilir Burimi and 35 percent by Ms. Alma Leka.75\n\n*Id.* \u00b6 112.\n\n105.\n\nFurthermore, \"the fact that Mr. Burimi is also an Italian national is. irrelevant.\"76 \"[D]ual nationals that also hold the nationality of the State party to the dispute are categorically ineligible to qualify as \u2018national of another Contracting State', or simply as a \u2018foreigner'.\"77\n\n*Id.* \u00b6113.\n\n*Id.*\n\n106.\n\nTherefore, according to Respondent, as Eagle Games is an Albanian company under Albanian control, this Tribunal lacks jurisdiction *ratione personae* pursuant to the second clause of Article 25(2)(b) of the Convention.\n\n107.\n\nFinally, Respondent claims that there is no evidence on the record showing that Mr. Ilir Burimi's 65 percent shareholding in Eagle Games is in fact owned by Burimi SRL. To the contrary, Claimants produced a company extract for Eagle Games from the Albanian Trade Registry,78 in which Mr. Ilir Burimi - and *not* Burimi SRL - is listed as the company's 65 percent shareholder.79 In addition, the sale contract by which Mr. Ilir Burimi purchased the shares from Mr. Edmond Shoto and Mr. Artan Serjani again identifies Mr. Ilir Burimi as the buyer and owner of the shares and does not indicate that he acted \"on behalf of\" Burimi SRL.80\n\nExhibit C-3.\n\nCM \u00b6 118.\n\n*Id*. \u00b6\u00b6 118-119.\n\n108.\n\nTherefore, Respondent concludes that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction *ratione personae* with respect to the claims of Eagle Games.\n\n**(iii) Tribunal's Analysis**\n-----------------------------\n\n109.\n\nTo have standing under ICSID Convention Article 25(2)(b), Eagle Games must show that it is a national \"of a Contracting State other than the State party to the dispute\" or that it should, by way of exception, \"be treated\" as such for the purposes of the ICSID Convention \"because of foreign control.\"81\n\nArticle 25 of the ICSID Convention.\n\n110.\n\nEagle Games is a legal entity incorporated in Albania. As such, it does not qualify as a national \"of a Contracting State other than the State party to the dispute\" under the first clause of Article 25(2)(b).\n\n111.\n\nUnder the second clause of Article 25(2)(b), Eagle Games could, by way of exception, \"be treated as a national of another Contracting State\" if, \"because of foreign control, the parties have agreed\" that it would be treated as such.\n\n112.\n\nThe requirement of \"foreign control\" is not expressly defined in the ICSID Convention. The wording of the second clause of 25(2)(b) allows the parties \" *to decide under what circumstances a company could be treated as a \u2018national of another Contracting State*.\"82 Accordingly, the Tribunal must consider whether the parties to this dispute have agreed that Eagle Games is under foreign\u2014in this case, Italian\u2014control and thereby qualifies as a national of Italy.\n\nBroches, *The Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes Between States and Nationals of Other States,* Receuil des Cours 1972 II, Vol 136, pp. 337-410, at pp. 358-359.\n\n113.\n\nAs Eagle Games has not concluded an agreement, such as an investment contract, directly with Respondent in which there is a direct or implied (by virtue of an ICSID arbitration clause) agreement to treat Eagle Games as a foreign national, the Tribunal must look to the relevant investment treaty and foreign investment law to determine whether there is an agreement on the meaning of \"foreign control\" for the purposes of fulfilling the requirement established by the second clause of Article 25(2)(b).83\n\nClaimants brought this case under the BIT and the FIL. The Tribunal notes that unlike the BIT, the FIL does not contain an agreement on the meaning of \"foreign control\" for purposes of the second clause of Article 25(2)(b).\n\n114.\n\nArticle 8(2)(c) of the Italy-Albania BIT states \"[\u2026] For the purposes of Article 25 of the Washington Convention March 18, 1965 and as of the date on which this will be applicable for both Contracting Parties, *a company having legal nationality of a Contracting Party to the dispute, but with a majority of capital owned by investors [of] the other Contracting Party or other third party, will be considered as having the nationality of the latter*.\"\n\n115.\n\nClaimants are thus correct in their assertion that, if the majority of Eagle Games' shares were owned by an Italian national, Eagle Games would qualify as having Italian nationality under the second clause of Article 25(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention.\n\n116.\n\nClaimants argue that 100 percent of Eagle Games' shares are owned by Burimi SRL, an Italian entity incorporated in Italy because Ms. Alma Leka's 35 percent shareholding is attributable to Burimi SRL via the financing agreement84 and the pledge agreement,85 and Mr. Ilir Burimi's 65 percent shareholding is attributable to Burimi SRL as Mr. Ilir Burimi was acting as an agent of Burimi SRL when he purchased the shares.\n\nExhibit C-4.\n\nExhibit C-5.\n\n117.\n\nThe Tribunal finds that the financing and pledge agreement do not represent ownership by Burimi SRL of the 35 percent shareholding in Eagle Games, nor have Claimants provided sufficient evidence that Mr. Ilir Burimi was acting on behalf of Burimi SRL as the purchaser and owner of the 65 percent of shares. The Share Sale Contract86 and the attestation by the Albanian judge of the sale of shares,87 in addition to trade data extracts and balance sheets,88 show that the shares were purchased in the name of Mr. Ilir Burimi and contain no reference to his acting as an agent of Burimi SRL.\n\nExhibit R-33.\n\nExhibit C-8.\n\nExhibits C-3, R-3, R-13.\n\n118.\n\nAccordingly, the Tribunal finds that Mr. Ilir Burimi, a dual national of Italy and Albania, is the majority shareholder of Eagle Games and therefore the relevant party for determining whether Eagle Games can be treated as a national of a Contracting State other than the State party to the dispute because it is under \"foreign control.\"\n\n119.\n\nWhile Claimants did not make this argument in its written submissions, the conclusion that Mr. Ilir Burimi\u2014a dual national of Italy and Albania\u2014is the majority shareholder of Eagle Games raises an important question about whether a dual national may rely on his \"foreign\" nationality\u2014that is, the nationality other than the nationality of the Contracting State party to the dispute\u2014for the purposes of establishing \"foreign control\" over a company bringing a claim before ICSID.\n\n120.\n\nThe ICSID Convention makes it very clear that a dual national may not invoke one of his two nationalities to establish jurisdiction over a claim brought in his own name under Article 25(2)(a).89 Indeed, it is for this very reason that Mr. Ilir Burimi was required to withdraw as a Requesting Party from the Request for Arbitration dated June 16, 2011.\n\nPursuant to Article 25(2)(a) of the ICSID Convention, jurisdiction under the Convention does not extend to \"any person who on either date [of consent or registration of a request for arbitration] also had the nationality of the Contracting State party to the dispute.\"\n\n121.\n\nWhile neither the ICSID Convention nor relevant precedents address the potential for a dual national invoking one of his two nationalities to establish jurisdiction over a claim brought in the name of a juridical person under the second clause of Article 25(2)(b), it strikes the Tribunal as anomalous that the principle against use of dual nationality in 25(2)(a) would not transfer to the potential use of dual nationality in 25(2)(b). Otherwise, any dual national who is a national of the Contracting State to a dispute could circumvent the bar on claims in Article 25(2)(a) by establishing a company in that state and asserting foreign control of that company by virtue of his second (foreign) nationality. Accordingly, the Tribunal finds that for the purposes of considering whether Eagle Games could be treated as a national of another Contracting State (i.e., Italy) because of \"foreign control,\" Mr. Ilir Burimi cannot invoke his Italian nationality to establish \"foreign control\" of Eagle Games.\n\n122.\n\nThe Tribunal thus concludes that it lacks jurisdiction *ratione personae* with respect to the claims of Eagle Games.\n\n**2. Whether there is jurisdiction** ***ratione personae*** **and** ***ratione materiae*** **with respect to the claims of Burimi SRL**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**2.1. Jurisdiction** ***ratione personae***\n--------------------------------------------\n\n**(i) Claimants' Position**\n---------------------------\n\n123.\n\nClaimants allege that Burimi SRL has standing before this Tribunal because it is a company incorporated in Italy. As such, it is a \"national of another Contracting State\" pursuant to Article 25(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention.90\n\nMem, unpaginated.\n\n124.\n\nMoreover, according to Claimants, Mr. Ilir Burimi acted on behalf of Burimi SRL when he purchased shares of Eagle Games, as clearly indicated in the records of the transaction.91 As a result, Claimants assert that Burimi SRL has exercised control over Eagle Games.\n\nExhibit C-26.\n\n**(ii) Respondent's Position**\n------------------------------\n\n125.\n\nRespondent argues that Burimi SRL lacks standing because it is owned by Mr. Ilir Burimi, who is a national of both Albania and Italy. As a consequence, Burimi SRL is an Albanian company\u2014as opposed to an Italian company\u2014for purposes of Article 25 of the ICSID Convention.\n\n126.\n\nFurthermore, Respondent submits that the Republics of Italy and Albania included a specific stipulation as to the investor's nationality in Article 8(2)(c) of the BIT. Under this provision, the nationality of a legal entity is determined by who controls it, and not by the company's place of incorporation. To apply correctly this provision, Albania contends that one has to pierce the corporate veil of the company to identify the nationality of the person or legal entity holding the majority of the capital for purposes of the first clause of Article 25(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention.92 In this case, 90 percent of the shares in Burimi SRL are held and owned by Mr. Ilir Burimi, who is an Albanian national.\n\nCM \u00b6 129.\n\n127.\n\nTherefore, Respondent concludes that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction *ratione personae* with respect to the claims of Burimi SRL.\n\n**(iii) Tribunal's Analysis**\n-----------------------------\n\n128.\n\nArticle 8(2)(c) of the Italy-Albania BIT states that \" *For the purposes of Article 25 of the Washington Convention March 18, 1965 and as of the date on which this will be applicable for both Contracting Parties, a company having legal nationality of a Contracting Party to the dispute, but with a majority of capital owned by investors [of] the other Contracting Party or other third party, will be considered as having the nationality of the latter.* \" Respondent argues that this provision requires the Tribunal to pierce the corporate veil and determine the nationality of Burimi SRL based on the nationality of the majority shareholder. As Mr. Ilir Burimi is a citizen of Albania, Respondent claims that for the purposes of Article 25(2)(b), Burimi SRL is an Albanian company.\n\n129.\n\nRespondent's argument is based on a fundamental misunderstanding of Article 25(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention.\n\n130.\n\nThe first clause of Article 25(2)(b) defines a \"national of another Contracting State\" as \"any juridical person which had the nationality of a Contracting State *other than the State party to the dispute* on the date on which the parties consented to submit such dispute to conciliation or arbitration.\" Burimi SRL is a juridical person with nationality of a Contracting State (Italy) other than the State party to the dispute (Albania).\n\n131.\n\nThe second clause of Article 25(2)(b) defines a \"national of another Contracting State\" as \"any juridical person *which had the nationality of the Contracting State party to the dispute* on that date and which, because of foreign control, the parties have agreed should be treated as a national of another Contracting State\". Burimi SRL does not have the nationality of the Contracting State party to the dispute (Albania). It is an Italian legal entity. Therefore, whether it is under \"foreign control\" is irrelevant to the determination of its nationality.\n\n132.\n\nRespondent mistakenly argues that piercing the corporate veil\u2014as is required by Article 8(2)(c) of the Italy-Albania BIT\u2014is necessary to determine the nationality of a company that *already* has the nationality of a State other than the State party to the dispute. The purpose of Article 8(2)(c), however, is to determine whether companies *with* the nationality of the State party to the dispute (Albania), can be considered under foreign control and therefore should be treated as a \"national of another Contracting State\" for the purposes of the ICSID Convention.\n\n133.\n\nThe Tribunal thus concludes that it does have jurisdiction *ratione personae* with respect to the claims of Burimi SRL.\n\n**2.2. Jurisdiction** ***ratione materiae***\n--------------------------------------------\n\n**(i) Claimants' Position**\n---------------------------\n\n134.\n\nClaimants submit that Burimi SRL (an Italian company) invested in Eagle Games by virtue of the financing agreement entered into with Ms. Alma Leka to fund her purchase of shares in Eagle Games.93\n\nMem, unpaginated.\n\n135.\n\nClaimants therefore argue that Burimi SRL holds an indirect investment under the terms of the ICSID Convention, the BIT, and the FIL.\n\n**(ii) Respondent's Position**\n------------------------------\n\n136.\n\nRespondent objects to jurisdiction *ratione materiae* on six grounds.94 First, Albania argues that the dispute does not arise directly out of an investment but rather out of a commercial financing agreement. In Albania's view, the financing agreement is a private *inter-partes* agreement concluded between one of the shareholders of Eagle Games (Ms. Alma Leka) and a third party (Burimi SRL).95 Respondent further argues that \"the objective of the financing agreement was not to invest in Eagle Games, the gambling permit holder, but to finance investments *belonging to* Ms. Leka.\"96 Albania thus concludes that Burimi SRL's claims do not arise directly out of the gambling permit or the transactions associated therewith.97\n\nCM \u00b6 137-355.\n\n*Id.* \u00b6 145.\n\n*Id.* \u00b6 146.\n\n*Id.* \u00b6 147.\n\n137.\n\nSecond, Respondent argues that Burimi SRL has not made an investment within the meaning of ICSID Convention Article 25, FIL Articles 1(3) and 1(5), and BIT Articles 1(1) and 1(3). Albania further argues that this Tribunal should \"irrespective of the requirements stipulated in the BIT or FIL\u2014not accept jurisdiction *ratione materiae* if the \u2018investment' requirements of Article 25 of the ICSID Convention are not met.\"98 According to Respondent, those requirements include (i) a (substantial) contribution; (ii) a certain duration; (iii) risk; and (iv) a contribution to the host State's development.99\n\n*Id.* \u00b6\u00b6 211-235.\n\n*Id.* \u00b6 227 citing *Salini Costruttori S.p.A. v. Kingdom of Morocco* (ICSID Case No. ARB/00/4) Decision on Jurisdiction, 23 July 2001, \u00b6 52.\n\n138.\n\nThird, Respondent contends that Burimi SRL has failed to prove \"that it is the holder of the right it claims, i.e., the \u2018investment' in Eagle Games.\"100 To satisfy this burden, Albania submits that Burimi SRL must show two separate facts: first, full proof of its investment,101 and second, that the documents in question provide a minimally sufficient degree of confidence in their authenticity.102 Albania contends that Claimants have failed to meet \"even at this advanced stage of the jurisdictional and merit proceedings, either of these two obligations.\"103\n\n*Id.* \u00b6 161.\n\n*Id.* \u00b6 162.\n\n*Id.* \u00b6 163.\n\n*Id.* \u00b6 181.\n\n139.\n\nFourth, Respondent argues that there is no *bona fide* investment because Mr. Ilir Burimi \"single-handedly designed and construed the financing arrangements between Burimi SRL and Ms. Leka with no other objective than to create - on paper - the illusion of a foreign investment, where there was, in reality, none.\"104 Respondent thus contends that the financing arrangements were designed not only as an attempt to create ICSID jurisdiction where there was none, but that these actions further constitute a violation of the principle of good faith.105\n\n*Id.* \u00b6 284.\n\n*Id.* \u00b6\u00b6 284-285.\n\n140.\n\nFifth, Respondent alleges that Burimi SRL's investment is illegal because it was made in violation of several domestic laws and regulations in Albania.106 In light of these breaches, Albania argues that the alleged investment cannot benefit from protection under the FIL, the BIT and the ICSID Convention.107\n\n*Id.* \u00b6\u00b6 297-330.\n\n*Id.* \u00b6 331.\n\n141.\n\nSixth, Respondent contends that Burimi SRL has not established a *prima facie* expropriation of its alleged investment because it failed to indicate (i) how its property\u2014the financing and pledge agreements\u2014was \"taken\"; and (ii) how this taking is attributable to Albania.108\n\n*Id.* \u00b6\u00b6 333-355.\n\n**(iii) Tribunal's Analysis**\n-----------------------------\n\n142.\n\nArticle 25(1) of the ICSID Convention states that \"the jurisdiction of the Centre shall extend to any legal dispute arising directly out of an investment, between a Contracting State [\u2026] and a national of another Contracting State.\" Claimants argue that the legal dispute at hand arises directly out of Burimi SRL's investment in Albania, which consists of (i) Burimi SRL's 65 percent shareholding in Eagle Games, an Albanian company, and (ii) Burimi SRL's financing agreement with Ms. Alma Leka as regards her 35 percent shareholding in Eagle Games.\n\n143.\n\nWith respect to Burimi SRL's alleged ownership of the 65 percent shareholding of Eagles Games, the Tribunal has already concluded that Claimants have not provided sufficient proof that Mr. Ilir Burimi was acting on behalf of Burimi SRL as the purchaser and owner of the 65 percent of shares. The Share Sale Contract109 and the attestation by the Albanian judge of the sale of shares,110 in addition to trade data extracts and balance sheets,111 show that the shares were purchased in the name of Mr. Ilir Burimi and contain no reference to his acting as an agent of Burimi SRL. Accordingly, the Tribunal concludes that Burimi SRL does not own the 65 percent of shares held by Mr. Ilir Burimi and those shares therefore do not represent an investment in Albania by Burimi SRL.\n\nExhibit R-33.\n\nExhibit C-8.\n\nExhibits C-3, R-3, R-13.\n\n144.\n\nWith respect to Burimi SRL's alleged ownership of the 35 percent shareholding of Eagle Games, Claimants argue that the financing agreement112 and the share pledge agreement113 between Ms. Alma Leka and Burimi SRL together constitute an investment by Burimi SRL in Eagle Games. However, the financing agreement\u2014by which Burimi SRL financed Ms. Alma Leka's share purchase in exchange for 90 percent of the profits she would receive\u2014does not represent ownership by Burimi SRL of Eagle Games. Rather, it represents a private, contractual loan agreement between Burimi SRL and Ms. Alma Leka, a private citizen, to finance investments belonging to her. The financing agreement states: \"The object of this contract is to ratify an agreement between the company Burimi Srl, which engages to finance *all the belonging investments of the shareholder Ms. Alma Leka* [\u2026]\".114\n\nExhibit C-4.\n\nExhibit C-5.\n\nExhibit C-4 (emphasis added).\n\n145.\n\nMoreover, the dispute at hand does not arise out of any government measure affecting Burimi SRL's agreement with Ms. Alma Leka. The financing and pledge agreements are free-standing contracts between Ms. Alma Leka and Burimi SRL, and exist independently of Eagle Games' gambling business. Burimi SRL's claims in this dispute arise out of its agreement with Ms. Alma Leka and do not arise out of the investment in question, namely, the enterprise of Eagle Games.\n\n146.\n\nOn these grounds alone, the Tribunal concludes that it lacks jurisdiction *ratione materiae* with respect to the claims of Burimi SRL *.* Therefore the Tribunal does not address Respondent's many other arguments on this jurisdictional question.\n\n**3. Whether Claimants have complied with the best efforts negotiation provisions of the BIT and FIL**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**(i) Claimants' Position**\n---------------------------\n\n147.\n\nClaimants contend that they have complied with FIL Article 8(2) and BIT Article 8(2). In their view, Claimants attempted to settle this dispute prior to initiating ICSID arbitration but their notice letters were rejected by Respondent.115 Claimants further contend that they also informed the Italian Embassy of the dispute, the latter suggesting that legal action should be taken.116\n\nExhibits C-14 and C-16.\n\nExhibit C-33; Mem, unpaginated.\n\n**(ii) Respondent's Position**\n------------------------------\n\n148.\n\nRespondent argues that Claimants did not make an effort to engage in proper amicable settlement negotiations with Albania.117\n\nCM \u00b6 74 and \u00b6\u00b6 85-98.\n\n149.\n\nBurimi SRL did not send any notification at all of a dispute to Albania prior to submitting the request for arbitration.118\n\nCM \u00b6 92.\n\n150.\n\nWith respect to Eagle Games, only one letter was sent on August 25, 2010. In Respondent's view, the letter was \"nothing but a formal notification of Eagle Games' claims and its intention to resort to legal proceedings\" if Albania failed to pay the amount in dispute in this arbitration.119\n\nCM \u00b6 94.\n\n151.\n\nMoreover, the letter did not invite Albania to enter into amicable settlement negotiations and made no reference to ICSID, the BIT, or the FIL\u2014instead it only mentioned the European Court of Human Rights.120\n\nCM \u00b6\u00b6 94-95.\n\n152.\n\nTherefore, Respondent concludes that Claimants have not complied with the best efforts obligation of FIL Article 8(2) and BIT Article 8(2).\n\n**(iii) Tribunal's Analysis**\n-----------------------------\n\n153.\n\nGiven the Tribunal's disposition of the other jurisdictional objections, it need not decide this question.\n\n**V. COSTS**\n------------\n\n**A. The Parties' Statements**\n------------------------------\n\n154.\n\nAfter the hearing, the Tribunal asked the Parties to submit their statements of costs.\n\n155.\n\nOn January 31, 2013, Respondent claimed costs as follows:\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ICSID fees | USD 150,000 |\n| Legal representation costs | EUR 348,856 |\n\n156.\n\nOn February 5, 2013, Claimants submitted the following statement:\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ICSID fees | USD 175,000 |\n| Legal representation costs | EUR 407,000 |\n\n**B. The Costs of the Proceeding**\n----------------------------------\n\n157.\n\nThe costs of the proceeding include the Tribunal's fees and expenses as well as ICSID's administrative fees and expenses. They are paid out of the advances made by the Parties.121\n\nThe remaining balance will be reimbursed to the Parties in proportion to the payments that they advanced to ICSID.\n\n158.\n\nThe costs of the proceeding are summarized as follows:122\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Description** | **USD** |\n| | | | |\n| Tribunal\u2019s fees and expenses | $122,408.17 |\n| ICSID's fees and expenses (estimated) | $64,142.42 |\n| Total | **$186,550.59** |\n\nThe ICSID Secretariat will provide the Parties with a detailed financial statement of the case account as soon as all invoices are received and the account is final.\n\n**C. The Tribunal's Decision on Costs**\n---------------------------------------\n\n159.\n\nCosts are governed by Article 61 of the ICSID Convention and Arbitration Rule 47(j).\n\n160.\n\nArticle 61 of the ICSID Convention reads as follows:\n\n(2) In the case of arbitration proceedings the Tribunal shall, except as the parties otherwise agree, assess the expenses incurred by the parties in connection with the proceedings, and shall decide how and by whom those expenses, the fees and expenses of the members of the Tribunal and the charges for the use of the facilities of the Centre shall be paid.\n\nSuch decision shall form part of the award.\n\n161.\n\nArbitration Rule 47 provides that:\n\n(1) The award shall be in writing and shall contain:\n\n[\u2026]\n\n(j) any decision of the Tribunal regarding the costs of the proceeding.\n\n162.\n\nIt is clear from the above-mentioned provisions that the Tribunal has broad powers to rule on the costs incurred by the Parties and ICSID in connection with this proceeding.\n\n163.\n\nRespondent prevailed on its jurisdictional arguments. Indeed, some of the grounds for jurisdiction asserted by Claimants did not withstand even moderate scrutiny. Moreover, Respondent's task (as well as the Tribunal's) was rendered difficult by the often incoherent presentation by Claimants.\n\n164.\n\nIn the circumstances, the Tribunal exercises its discretion pursuant to Article 61 of the Convention and awards all costs in favor of Respondent. Therefore, Claimants shall pay to Respondent:\n\n1. USD 93,225.30123 for Respondent's costs of these proceedings; and\n\n2. EUR 348,856 for Respondent's legal costs and expenses in this arbitration.\n\nThe Tribunal awards Respondent 100 percent of its arbitration costs. After ICSID refunds Albania with its share of the remaining balance in the case account, Albania will have incurred USD 93,275.30 in arbitration costs. This amount is calculated by subtracting USD 56,997.93 (the amount to be refunded to Albania) from USD 150,000 (the total amount paid into the case account by Albania.) For a detailed breakdown of the arbitration costs, please refer to the financial statement to be provided with the refund letters.\n\n165.\n\nInterest on the amount awarded to Respondent shall run from the date of this Award and be set at the Euro Interbank Offered Rate (Euribor) three-month rate in effect on the date of this Award, plus two percent (2%) compounded semi-annually from the date of this Award.\n\nVI. AWARD\n---------\n\nFor the reasons and on the grounds set out above, the Tribunal unanimously decides that:\n\n1. The Tribunal lacks jurisdiction *ratione personae* with respect to the claims of Eagle Games SH.A;\n\n2. The Tribunal lacks jurisdiction *ratione materiae* with respect to the claims of Burimi SRL;\n\n3. Claimants shall pay to Respondent USD 93,225.30 for Respondent\u2019s costs of these proceedings;\n\n4. Claimants shall pay to Respondent EUR 348,856 for Respondent\u2019s legal costs and expenses in this arbitration;\n\n5. Interest on the amounts awarded to Respondent shall run from the date of this Award and be set at the Euro Interbank Offered Rate (Euribor) three-month rate in effect on the dale of this Award, plus two percent (2%) compounded semi-annually from the date of this Award;\n\n6. All other claims and requests by the Parties are dismissed."}]}
