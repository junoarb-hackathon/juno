Procedural History**\n-------------------------\n\n1.\n\nOn 25 February 2010, AbitibiBowater Inc. (the **\"Claimant\")** served a Notice of Arbitration and Statement of Claim on the Government of Canada (the **\"Respondent\"),** pursuant to Articles 3 and 18 of the Arbitration Rules of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law, 1976 (the **\"UNCITRAL Rules\"****)** and Articles 1116, 1117 and 1120 of the North American Free Trade Agreement **(\"NAFTA\")** (the **\"Notice of Arbitration\").**\n\n2.\n\nIn the Notice of Arbitration, the Claimant sought compensation under NAFTA Chapter 11 for damages arising out of an act passed by the Government of Newfoundland and Labrador on 16 December 2008, *An Act to Return to the Crown Certain Rights Relating to Timber and Water use Vested in Abitibi-Consolidated and to Expropriate Assets and Lands Associated with the Generation of Electricity Enabled by Those Water Use Rights* (the **\"Act\"),** on its own behalf and on behalf of Abitibi-Consolidated Company of Canada, Abitibi-Consolidated Inc. and AbitibiBowater Canada Inc. (the **\"Claims\").**\n\n3.\n\nOn 22 June 2010, the Arbitral Tribunal was constituted as follows: Mr. Doak Bishop (American) and Dr. Gavan Griffith, Q.C. (Australian), were each appointed as arbitrators by the Claimant and the Respondent, respectively, and Professor Andreas Bucher (Swiss) was appointed as presiding arbitrator by agreement of the Parties.\n\n4.\n\nOn 6 July 2010, further to a joint request by the Claimant and the Respondent (together, the **\"Parties\"),** the Secretariat of the International Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes (the **\"Centre\")** agreed to serve as administering authority in the arbitration.\n\n5.\n\nOn 19 July 2010, the Centre conveyed to the Parties the Arbitral Tribunal\u2019s proposal to hold a first procedural meeting in Washington, D.C. on 26 August 2010, circulating at the same time a provisional agenda. The Parties were invited to confer on the agenda items and revert to the Tribunal with their agreement on these items, if any, by August 3, 2010.\n\n6.\n\nOn 2 August 2010, the Parties jointly wrote to the Arbitral Tribunal to advise that significant progress had been made on an agreement concerning the agenda for the first procedural meeting and requesting that the meeting therefore be held telephonically, as opposed to in person, with the assistance of the Centre.\n\n7.\n\nOn 4 August 2010, the Centre conveyed the Arbitral Tribunal\u2019s agreement to hold the first procedural meeting telephonically.\n\n8.\n\nOn 25 August 2010, the Parties jointly wrote to the Arbitral Tribunal advising of their agreement on certain procedural matters. In their joint letter, the Parties also advised that they had reached and executed a final settlement, dated 24 August 2010 (the **\"Settlement Agreement\"),** a copy of which was attached, and had agreed to request that the Arbitral Tribunal record the Settlement Agreement in the form of a Consent Award, pursuant to Article 34.1 of the UNCITRAL Rules.\n\n9.\n\nOn the same day, the Arbitral Tribunal wrote to the Parties, requesting their joint consideration of the effect, if any, on the Tribunal\u2019s continued jurisdiction over these arbitral proceedings, including its jurisdiction to issue a Consent Award, once the Settlement Agreement had, by its terms, taken effect.\n\n10.\n\nDuring the first procedural meeting, held by teleconference on 26 August 2010, the Parties confirmed their joint request, pursuant to Article 34.1 of the UNCITRAL Rules and paragraph 9 of the Settlement Agreement, that the terms of the Settlement Agreement be recorded in the form of a Consent Award, and made submissions on the timing of the Settlement Agreement\u2019s taking effect *vis-\u00e0-vis* the Arbitral Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction to issue the requested Consent Award.\n\n11.\n\nOn 17 September 2010, the ICSID Secretariat issued Minutes of Meeting for the first procedural meeting, which record the Parties\u2019 joint request for a Consent Award, and confirm the basic procedural framework for the arbitration agreed by the Parties in contemplation of issuance of the present Consent Award.\n\n**II. The Settlement Agreement**\n--------------------------------\n\n12.\n\nThe Parties provided the Arbitral Tribunal with an original copy of the Settlement Agreement, which was received on 13 September 2010.\n\n13.\n\nParagraph 1 of the Settlement Agreement provides that the Claimant \"hereby irrevocably and permanently withdraws its Notice of Arbitration served against the Government of Canada\". Paragraph 9 further records the Parties\u2019 agreement to request the incorporation of the Settlement Agreement in the present Consent Award, which will formally and permanently discontinue the arbitration proceedings:\n\nThe Parties agree jointly to request the incorporation in full of this Settlement Agreement in the form of a Consent Award, pursuant to NAFTA Article 1136 and Article 34(1) of the UNCITRAL Rules, to be issued by the Arbitral Tribunal constituted under NAFTA Chapter 11 to hear the dispute between the Parties, which will result in the formal and permanent discontinuance and termination of the NAFTA Chapter 11 arbitration proceedings commenced by AbitibiBowater with the filing of its Notice of Arbitration.\n\n14.\n\nThe Settlement Agreement takes effect upon the satisfaction of certain conditions. In particular, paragraph 13 of the Settlement Agreement provides as follows:\n\nThis Settlement Agreement shall be executed in three original copies in counterparts, one original for each Party and one original for the Arbitral Tribunal, and shall take effect upon the court approval referred to in paragraph 6 being obtained and all relevant appeal periods for such approvals having lapsed, and the New Company being constituted.\n\n15.\n\nParagraph 6 of the Settlement Agreement, referred to above, further provides as follows:\n\nThis Settlement Agreement is conditional upon AbitibiBowater [defined so as to include AbitibiBowater Inc. and its Canadian subsidiaries Abitibi-Consolidated Company of Canada, Abitibi-Consolidated Inc. and AbitibiBowater Canada Inc.] obtaining the approval of its terms by the Superior Court of Quebec in the CCAA Proceedings and by the U.S. Court in the Chapter 11 Bankruptcy Proceedings and court approval of AbitibiBowater\u2019s restructuring plan. AbitibiBowater shall apply for such approvals promptly. Should AbitibiBowater fail to obtain the approvals referred to in this paragraph 6, this Agreement shall become null and void and AbitibiBowater shall retain the full benefit of the Claims.\n\n16.\n\nThe Settlement Agreement, in its recitals, also notes, among other things, that \"AbitibiBowater is currently finalizing its restructuring process under the Chapter 11 Bankruptcy Proceedings and CCAA Proceedings and intends to continue operations in Canada under a new corporate structure (the \u2018New Company\u2019).\" Paragraph 5 of the Settlement Agreement confirms that payment made under that Agreement shall be made to the New Company.\n\n17.\n\nAccordingly, the Settlement Agreement takes effect once the conditions in paragraphs 6 and 13 of the Settlement Agreement have been met.\n\n18.\n\nIn a joint letter to the Arbitral Tribunal dated October 15, 2010, the Parties confirmed their agreement that the Tribunal has jurisdiction to issue this Consent Award upon the coming into effect of the Settlement Agreement as the Parties further confirmed their understanding that, in relation to paragraph 1 of the Settlement Agreement, the Notice of Arbitration shall be deemed to be withdrawn by AbitibiBowater Inc. no sooner than upon issuance of the Consent Award, which shall formally and permanently discontinue and terminate these proceedings.\n\n19.\n\nIn a joint letter to the Arbitral Tribunal dated 14 December 2010, the Parties confirmed that the above-cited conditions having been satisfied, the Settlement Agreement has taken effect and accordingly, this Consent Award can be issued.\n\n**III.
