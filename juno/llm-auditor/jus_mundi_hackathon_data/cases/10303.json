Procedural Background**\n----------------------------\n\n1.\n\nThe Request for Arbitration of Mr. Hasanov dated October 19, 2020, was registered by the Secretary-General of ICSID on October 30, 2020, in accordance with Article 36(3) of the ICSID Convention.1 The Tribunal was subsequently constituted on February 18, 2021, in accordance with Article 37(2)(a) of the ICSID Convention.\n\nThe Request for Arbitration included an application for provisional measures (RfA, paras 110-124). In accordance with Arbitration Rule 39(5), the Secretary-General fixed a schedule for further submissions on the provisional measures request following registration of the Request for Arbitration. The parties' further submissions on provisional measures were filed on December 21, 2020 (Respondent's observations); January 12, 2021 (Claimant's response) and February 5, 2021 (Respondent's reply). Correspondence from the parties of March 17 and 18, 2021, addressed factual developments connected to the provisional measures request. In its letter of March 18, 2021, the Claimant stated that his provisional measures application should be postponed *sine die*, given the developments.\n\n2.\n\nOn February 24, 2021, the Respondent filed a request for bifurcation of the proceeding (\"**Bifurcation Request**\"). With reference to Articles 41(2) and 44 of the ICSID Convention, as well as ICSID Arbitration Rules 19 and 41(3), the Bifurcation Request asked that the Tribunal exercise its discretion to bifurcate the proceeding to hear the Respondent's objection based on Article 9 of the Azerbaijan-Georgia Bilateral Investment Treaty as a preliminary objection.\n\n3.\n\nThe Claimant opposed the Bifurcation Request by letter dated March 8, 2021. The Claimant argued that the objection was not meritorious, and that bifurcation would not promote procedural economy and would cause unnecessary cost and delay. If the Bifurcation Request were granted, the Claimant requested that the bifurcated issue proceed on an expedited calendar.\n\n4.\n\nPursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule 13(1), the Tribunal held a first session with the parties on March 19, 2021, by videoconference, during which the parties made oral submissions on the Bifurcation Request, supported by \u2018power point' slides.\n\n5.\n\nFollowing the first session, the Tribunal informed the parties, by ICSID's letter of March 19, 2021, of its decision to grant the request for bifurcation:\n\n*In view of the parties' agreed timetable for a potential bifurcation phase, the Tribunal wishes to indicate now the determination that it reached in deliberations following today's first session. In due course, once Procedural Order No. 1 has been issued, the Tribunal shall issue a further procedural order in which the bifurcation determination is formally rendered.*\n\n*The Tribunal has decided that Respondent's Application for Bifurcation of the \"Inter-State Negotiation Objection\" shall be granted. Accordingly, the parties are directed to adhere to Steps 1-3 in the joint timetable previously submitted to the Tribunal, with the hearing date in Step 3 being 12 May 2021, as discussed during the first session.*\n\n*The Tribunal thanks the parties for their submissions today.*\n\n6.\n\nOn March 26, 2021, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 1 recording the agreement of the parties on procedural matters as indicated by the parties' comments on the draft Order and the discussion during the First Session. Procedural Order No. 1 sets out the agreed procedural calendar, including the timetable for addressing the bifurcated issue.\n\n**II. Tribunal's Analysis**\n---------------------------\n\n7.\n\nICSID Arbitration Rule 19 states that \"[t]he Tribunal shall make the orders required for the conduct of the proceeding*.*\"\n\n8.\n\nThe Tribunal further notes that bifurcation is a matter for the Tribunal's discretion under the ICSID Convention and the applicable 2006 ICSID Arbitration Rules. Article 41(2) of the ICSID Convention indeed provides that:\n\n*Any objection by a party to the dispute that that dispute is not within the jurisdiction of the Centre, or for other reasons is not within the competence of the Tribunal, shall be considered by the Tribunal which shall determine whether to deal with it as a preliminary question or to join it to the merits of the dispute.*\n\n9.\n\nICSID Arbitration Rule 41(4) provides in relevant part that the Tribunal \"may deal with the objection as a preliminary question or join it to the merits of the dispute [...].\"\n\n10.\n\nThe objection at issue is, as the Respondent characterizes it, the \"Inter-State Negotiation Objection\" (\"**Objection**\").\n\n(i) Article 9.1 of the Azerbaijan-Georgia BIT (\"**BIT**,\" translation of the Russian text) provides as follows: \"Any dispute that may arise between an investor of one Contracting Party and the other Contracting Party in connection with an investment in the territory of the latter Contracting Party, will be subject to negotiation between the Contracting Parties in dispute.\n\n(ii) Article 9.2 of the BIT provides, in pertinent part: \"If any dispute between an investor of one Contracting Party and the other Contracting Party cannot be settled in such a manner within six months from the day on which a written claim was submitted, the investor shall be entitled to refer the matter :....\"\n\nThe Respondent contends that Article 9 \"conditions resort to international arbitration on prior negotiations between Georgia and the Republic of Azerbaijan for six months,\" and it \"is undisputed that no such negotiations have even been sought or initiated, much less conducted for six months. Claimant's claims must therefore be dismissed at the outset\" (letter dated February 24, 2021).\n\n11.\n\nAs noted above, the Claimant opposes the Bifurcation Request on the grounds that the Objection is \"highly unmeritorious\" and bifurcation would not promote procedural economy. If the Tribunal were to grant bifurcation, the Claimant requests an expedited schedule (letter dated March 8, 2021).\n\n12.\n\nThe parties broadly agree (letters of February 24 and March 8, 2021) that the following tripartite test applies in investment arbitration for determining whether bifurcation is warranted:\n\n\u2022 whether the Objection is substantial or frivolous;2\n\n\u2022 whether the Objection is closely intertwined with the merits; and\n\n\u2022 whether all or an essential part of the claims may be disposed of by the Objection.\n\nThe cases cited by the parties regarding this test include, but are not limited to, *Emmis International v. Hungary*, ICSID Case No. ARB/12/2 (Decision on Respondent's Application for Bifurcation dated June 13, 2013; RL-55); *A11Y Ltd. v. Czech Republic*, UNCT 15/1 (Decision on Bifurcation dated October 5, 2015; RL-56); and *Glamis Gold, Ltd. v. USA*, UNCITRAL (Procedural Order No. 2 dated May 31, 2015; RL-61).3\n\nIn oral submissions, the parties diverged on the precise meaning of this element. The Claimant citing *Eco Oro Minerals Corp. v. Colombia*, ICSID Case No. ARB/16/41 (Procedural Order No. 2 dated June 28, 2018; RL-58), that the Objection must have merit in the sense that it is serious and substantial; *i.e.*, the threshold is higher than merely showing that the Objection is not frivolous. Transcript (\"**Tr.**\") p. 40. The Respondent referred to the authorities cited at fn 3 of its February 24 letter, and submitted that the Tribunal should bifurcate if the Objection is \"prima facie plausible, prima facie arguable.\" Tr. p. 58. See also Tr. p. 29: \"the applicable standard is whether the objection is prima facie serious.\"\n\nSee fn 3 in the Respondent's letter of February 24, 2021. The Claimant adds that even if the Respondent satisfies the test elements, bifurcation is not obligatory and remains a matter of discretion for the Tribunal (letter dated March 8, 2021).\n\nA. The Respondent's Position in Support of Bifurcation\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n13.\n\nThe Respondent submits that its Objection satisfies each element of the tripartite test:\n\n(i) The language of the prevailing Russian of Article 9, with the phrase \"the Contracting Parties\" being expressly defined as the Government of Georgia and the Government of Azerbaijan, requires that negotiations between the two Governments are a condition of their consent to arbitration. To adopt the Claimant's position \u2013 the phrase refers to the investor and the host State \u2013 would be to rewrite the BIT. Other investment treaties also require inter-State negotiations as a condition to arbitration. Further, the doctrine of estoppel, invoked by the Claimant, is inapplicable in this context, and the Respondent rejects any allegation that it has not acted in good faith in raising the Objection (Tr. pp. 30-36).\n\n(ii) It is clear \u2013 and the Claimant does not contest \u2013 that the issues raised by the Objection are \"entirely separate from the merits of the case\" (Tr. p. 29).\n\n(iii) The Objection would effectively dispose of the entire case whether characterized as a matter or jurisdiction or admissibility. If the former, many treaty tribunals have ruled that a negotiation requirement must be satisfied to establish the arbitral jurisdiction. If the latter, all claims of the investor should be dismissed as inadmissible. Even if the case were stayed to allow for negotiations rather than dismissed, inter-State negotiations may lead to a settlement, thereby disposing of the entire case (Tr. pp. 38-39).\n\nB. The Claimant's Opposition to Bifurcation\n-------------------------------------------\n\n14.\n\nThe Claimant submits that the Objection is not meritorious and bifurcation would not support procedural economy:\n\n(i) On its face, the Objection is entirely lacking in merit; it is frivolous (Tr. p. 55). The Respondent's interpretation of Article 9 is plainly incorrect,4 and by raising it at this time, rather than in the March to September 2020 time frame, the Respondent is not acting in good faith. The Respondent has not identified an award in favor of its position regarding language similar to that in Article 9. However, the award in *Capital Financial holdings Luxembourg SA v. Cameroon*, ICSID Case No. ARB/15/18 (June 22, 2017),5 is instructive and points, in a similar context, to there not being an obligation on the investor to ensure that diplomatic conciliation takes place.6\n\n(ii) The Claimant does not contest that the Objection raises a discrete issue not intertwined with the merits. However, the Claimant argues that briefing the Objection separately for there to be a separate hearing while the Claimant is preparing its memorial will cause cost and prejudice to the Claimant (Tr. p. 64).\n\n(iii) The Objection does not raise a jurisdictional condition: it relates to a purely procedural matter that has no effect on the Tribunal's jurisdiction. It would not be just, in this context, to consider that the Objection would dispose of the entire proceeding (Tr. p. 56).\n\nAlthough Article 9.1 refers to the \"Contracting Parties,\" \"the drafters of this treaty intended to refer to the investor and the sovereign having a dispute.\" Tr. p. 55.\n\nThe Claimant relied on this case in oral submissions. Tr. pp. 49-53. The Respondent objected to the Claimant's referring to an authority not previously in the record. The Tribunal notes that in view of the Tribunal's resolution of the Bifurcation Request, it has not been necessary to provide an opportunity to the Respondent to submit any new authorities in response. Tr. p. 51.\n\nThe Claimant's March 8, 2021, letter includes a footnote (fn 18) which states that the Claimant requested the Azerbaijani Government to \"engage with\" the Government of Georgia to resolve the dispute, but the Azrebiajani Government did not take any action. The Claimant says that it will provide details when the Objection is briefed. Absent such details, this point does not bear on the Tribunal's assessment of the Bifurcation Request.\n\nC. The Tribunal's Resolution of the Bifurcation Request\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n15.\n\nWhile the parties have devoted substantial portions of their submissions, written and oral, to discussion of the merits of the Objection, the evaluation of the Bifurcation Request does not entail an extensive examination of the merits. The tripartite test identifies the relevant elements for the Tribunal's consideration. The Tribunal finds that each individual element weighs in the Respondent's favor, and the elements taken collectively support the Tribunal's granting the Bifurcation Request:\n\n(i) The Objection is not frivolous. On its face, the Objection is arguable; the text of Article 9 raises a question about the potential relevance of Inter-State negotiation as a condition to arbitration that requires further submissions from the parties. It is not apparent that, as the Claimant asserts, the Objection is based on a \"***patently***  incorrect interpretation of Article 9\" (emphasis supplied; letter of March 8, 2021, para. 12). Thus, whether the standard under the cited authorities is taken to be either \"prima facie plausible\" or a \"higher threshold\" than merely not frivolous or vexatious, the Objection satisfies the standard.\n\n(ii) The Objection clearly raises a discrete issue that is not intertwined with the merits. While the Claimant does not contest that this element weighs in favor of bifurcation, it argues that it will be disadvantaged in terms of time and costs by a separate briefing and a separate hearing. However, the Tribunal considers that an expedited briefing schedule, early hearing, quick decision, and lack of intertwining with the merits point to bifurcation as being consistent with procedural economy while causing relatively limited cost to the Claimant.\n\n(iii) If the Tribunal were to find that Article 9 of the BIT includes a jurisdictional requirement that has not been fulfilled in this case, all claims may potentially be disposed of by the Objection.\n\n**III. Decision**\n-----------------\n\n16.\n\nFor the reasons set out in paragraph 15 above, the Tribunal determines that the Bifurcation Request is GRANTED. The briefing and hearing schedule for addressing the Objection as a preliminary issue shall proceed as set out in Annex A to Procedural Order No. 1.\n\n17.\n\nCosts are reserved."}, {"Title": "Procedural Order No. 3 (Claimant's Request for Provisional Measures)", "Type": "Interim & Provisional Measures", "Date": "2021-04-15T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Procedural Order No. 3 (Claimant's Request for Provisional Measures)\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**I. Background**\n-----------------\n\n1.\n\nThe Request for Arbitration dated October 19, 2020, includes an application for urgent provisional measures at paragraphs 110-124 ('**Application'**).\n\n2.\n\nIn accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 39(5), the Secretary-General fixed a schedule for further submissions on the Application following the registration of the Request for Arbitration.\n\n3.\n\nFurther to the calendar fixed by the Secretary-General, the Respondent filed observations on the Application on December 21, 2020.\n\n4.\n\nOn January 12, 2021, the Claimant filed its response, which modified the provisional measures requested in the Application. At paragraph 143 of the response, the Claimant seeks an order:\n\n*\"143.1 Staying the making or execution of any administrative decisions by the [**Georgian National Communications Commission (\"****GNCC****\")]* *in respect of [**Caucasus Online LLC (\"****CO****\")]**, including (specifically but non-exclusively) decisions that: (i) would have the effect of suspending or would lead to the suspension of CO's authorisation to operate; (ii) impose further sanctions against CO for its alleged breaches (in dispute in these proceedings) of the Communications Law, the 2016 GNCC Decision and/or the 2019 GNCC Decision; and/or (iii) are designed to procure and/or may directly or indirectly lead to the forced reversal of the Transaction;*\n\n*143.2 Proscribing the Special Manager from exercising any of the powers conferred on her in respect of CO by the 1 October 2020 Decision, including (specifically but non-exclusively) by taking any measures (by action or inaction) that: (i) are adverse to CO; (ii) interfere in or obstruct the day-to-day management and business activities of CO; and/or (iii) are designed to procure and/or may directly or indirectly lead to the forced reversal of the Transaction; and*\n\n*143.3 Ordering that the Special Manager approve the request made by Mr Teymur Taghiyev, a director of Nelgado Limited, in his letter dated 11 January 2021,150 that CO's governing bodies (its director, supervisory board and shareholders) be empowered to carry out the managerial activities listed in that letter.*\"\n\n5.\n\nThe Respondent submitted its reply on February 5, 2021, which requests that the Tribunal deny the Application.\n\n6.\n\nFollowing the constitution of the Tribunal on February 18, 2021, the first session of the Tribunal was scheduled for March 19, 2021. Following consultations with the parties concerning the matters to be addressed during the first session, the Application was included in the agenda for the first session and each party was allocated time for oral submissions and rebuttals concerning the Application.\n\n7.\n\nShortly before the first session, correspondence from the parties dated March 17 and 18, 2021, addressed developments connected to the Application.\n\n8.\n\nBy letter dated March 17, 2021, the Respondent informed the Tribunal that the Tbilisi Court of Appeals had, further to an application from International Online Networks (\"ION\"), a shareholder of CO, granted interim measures that suspended the powers of the Special Manager. Based on this development, the Respondent requested that the Tribunal \"(i) order Claimant to clarify its case on provisional measures; and (ii) postpone the hearing on provisional measures, currently scheduled for this Friday, March 19, 2021, to allow Respondent to properly prepare its defense to the latest iteration of Claimant's case.\"\n\n9.\n\nIn his letter of March 18, 2021, the Claimant agreed that the Application be postponed *sine die* given the developments, but \"reserve[d] his right to request that the Tribunal convene an emergency hearing on relatively short notice for the two or three hours required to hear the Parties on the provisional measures request.\"\n\n10.\n\nDuring the first session held on March 19, 2021, each party had the opportunity to make introductory comments, including addressing the circumstances relating to the Application. The developments related to the Application were noted in the Tribunal's Procedural Order Nos. 1 and 2, both dated March 26, 2021.\n\n11.\n\nBy letter of April 8, 2021, the Claimant informed the Tribunal that the Tbilisi Court of Appeals had reversed its interim measures decision based on the evidence that had been presented by GNCC. The Claimant therefore renewed his Application and asks that the Tribunal \"urgently reconvene to hear Claimant's Request for Provisional Measures.\" The Claimant requested, in particular, \"that the Tribunal convene a hearing on the Request for Provisional Measures, at its earliest convenience, on or after 12 April 2021.\"\n\n12.\n\nFollowing the Tribunal's invitation, the Respondent responded by letter of April 9, 2021. The Respondent states that \"[i]t would not be practically feasible or procedurally appropriate to hold a hearing on Claimant's requests for provisional measures on such short notice\" and requested that the Tribunal \"convene the hearing on provisional measures no earlier than May 12, 2021\". The Respondent argues, *inter alia*, that (a) \"the hearing should not be scheduled until the Court of Appeal's reasoned decision reinstating the powers of the Special Manager, which forms the basis of Claimant's request for a hearing, becomes available and can be introduced into the record\"; and (b) \"procedural economy dictates that the Tribunal should decide the Inter-State Negotiation Objection before Claimant's request for provisional measures.\"\n\n13.\n\nOn April 12, 2021, following the Tribunal's invitation, the Claimant maintained its request that the Tribunal \"convene a hearing on the Request for Provisional Measures at its earliest convenience this week.\" The Claimant notes that the parties were previously prepared to address the Application during the first session, and \"save for the reinstatement of the Special Manager following\" the Court of Appeal's decision, there have been no developments that would alter the grounds for the Application and would therefore justify further preparation time. The Claimant states that, if the Tribunal were minded to wait for the reasoned decision of the Tbilisi Court of Appeals before deciding on the Provisional Measures Request, the Claimant requests \"that the hearing take place on Monday 26 or Tuesday 27 April 2021, on the basis that the reasoned decision of the Tbilisi Court of Appeal should as a matter of Georgian procedural law be handed down by 21 April 2021[\u2026].\" However, the Claimant emphasizes that the reasoning of the Court of Appeal's decision \"has no impact whatsoever on the Tribunal's ability to grant Provisional Measures.\" Moreover, the Respondent's challenge to jurisdiction should not delay the hearing of the Application (citing *Caratube International Oil Company v. Kazakhstan*, ICSID Case No. ARB/08/12, Decision dated December 4, 2014, para 106).\n\n14.\n\nOn April 14, 2021, the Respondent replied to the Claimant's letter of April 12, 2021, reiterating its request that the Tribunal convene the hearing on provisional measures no earlier than May 12, 2021. Regarding the need for additional time for preparation, the Respondent notes *inter alia* that \"circumstances have evolved\" since the first session and that it has not had an opportunity to \"fully review the record of the Court of Appeals proceedings.\" With regard to the objection on jurisdiction, the Respondent states that there is \"no urgency that would require a decision on provisional measures in the short period of time needed to resolve the Inter-State Negotiation Objection\" and in this regard argues that in *Caratube*, cited by the Claimant, the Tribunal \"expressly confirmed that, in exercising its discretion whether or not to recommend provisional measures, it is necessary to '[d]*ecide whether or not the urgency of the matter requires* [the Tribunal] *to defer the provisional measures until after the issue of the tribunal's jurisdiction has been argued and decided*.'\" (citing *Caratube v. Kazakhstan*, Decision dated December 4, 2014, para 108). Finally, the Respondent asserts that there is no basis for the provisional measures requested in paragraphs 143.2 and 143.3 of the Claimant's January 12, 2021 submission (i.e. an undertaking that the GNCC will not suspend CO's authorization to operate and approval of the request made by Mr. Teymur Taghiyev).\n\n**II. The Tribunal's Directions**\n---------------------------------\n\n15.\n\nICSID Convention Article 47 states:\n\n\"*Except as the parties otherwise agree, the Tribunal may, if it considers that the circumstances so require, recommend any provisional measures which should be taken to preserve the respective rights of either party*.\"\n\n16.\n\nFurther, ICSID Arbitration Rule 39 provides that:\n\n*\"(1) At any time after the institution of the proceeding, a party may request that provisional measures for the preservation of its rights be recommended by the Tribunal. The request shall specify the rights to be preserved, the measures the recommendation of which is requested, and the circumstances that require such measures.*\n\n*(2) The Tribunal shall give priority to the consideration of a request made pursuant to paragraph (1).*\n\n*(3) The Tribunal may also recommend provisional measures on its own initiative or recommend measures other than those specified in a request. It may at any time modify or revoke its recommendations.*\n\n*(4) The Tribunal shall only recommend provisional measures, or modify or revoke its recommendations, after giving each party an opportunity of presenting its observations. [\u2026]*\"\n\n17.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that the Application is ripe for review. The record may be further supplemented with the reasoning of the of the Tbilisi Court of Appeal's April 7, 2021 decision, if the reasoning appears sufficiently in advance of the hearing on provisional measures (see below). However, the absence of the Court's reasoning would not preclude the Tribunal's consideration of the Application. Further, the Tribunal's determination of the Application is not predicated on its prior determination of the Republic of Georgia's pending Inter-State Negotiation Objection, for which a hearing is scheduled on May 12, 2021.\n\n18.\n\nAs a practical matter, it is unfeasible for the Tribunal to hold a hearing on the Application before May 12, 2021. Taking into account the timing of the renewed Application, the parties' submissions and the Tribunal's availability, the Tribunal will hear the parties' oral arguments on the Application during the hearing scheduled for May 12, 2021, together with oral submissions on the Inter-State Negotiation Objection. As previously arranged, the May 12 hearing shall be held remotely. The Tribunal shall issue a hearing schedule in due course. The Parties will please liaise with Ms. Mowatt to make the necessary logistical arrangements for the remote hearing on May 12.\n\n19.\n\nIn the period from this date until the Tribunal issues its final decision on the Application, the Tribunal issues the directions in paragraph 20, below, to the parties on the basis of the parties' submissions to date, with a view to preventing the aggravation of the parties' dispute, and ***without forming any judgment whatsoever on the merits of the Application and the jurisdiction of this Tribunal.***\n\n20.\n\nThe Tribunal directs that the Respondent refrain from taking any of the steps listed in para. 143.1-.3 of the Claimant's submissions of January 12, 2021, including, in particular:\n\na) an undertaking that the GNCC will not suspend CO's authorization to operate; and\n\nb) an undertaking to allow that the governing bodies of CO exercise, without the Special Manager's further approval, the list of activities requested by Mr. Teymur Taghiyev in his letter of January 11, 2021.\n\nEach party is at liberty to apply for modification of these directions upon a showing of good cause."}, {"Title": "Decision on Respondent\u2019s Inter-State Negotiation Objection", "Type": "Jurisdiction", "Date": "2022-04-19T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Decision on Respondent\u2019s Inter-State Negotiation Objection\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Table of Selected Defined Terms**\n-----------------------------------\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Arbitration Rules | ICSID Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings 2006 |\n| Azerbaijan-Georgia BIT or the BIT | Agreement between the Government of Georgia and the Government of the Republic of Azerbaijan on the Encouragement and Reciprocal Protection of Investments, which entered into force on July 10, 1996 |\n| C-[#] | Claimant\u2019s Exhibit |\n| CJ-slides | Claimant\u2019s Presentation of November 23, 2021 titled \"Hearing on the Inter-State Negotiation Objection\" |\n| CLA-[#] | Claimant\u2019s Legal Authority |\n| Cl.

INTRODUCTION AND PARTIES**\n-------------------------------\n\n1.\n\nThis case concerns a dispute submitted to the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (\"**ICSID**\" or the \"**Centre**\") on the basis of the Agreement between the Government of Georgia and the Government of the Republic of Azerbaijan on the Encouragement and Reciprocal Protection of Investments, which entered into force on July 10, 1996 (the \"**Azerbaijan-Georgia BIT**\" or the \"**BIT**\"), and the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States, which entered into force on October 14, 1966 (the \"**ICSID Convention**\").\n\n2.\n\nThe claimant is Mr. Nasib Hasanov (\"**Mr. Hasanov**\" or the \"**Claimant**\"), a natural person having the nationality of Azerbaijan.\n\n3.\n\nThe respondent is Georgia (\"**Respondent**\" or \"**State**\" or \"**Georgia**\").\n\n4.\n\nThe Claimant and the Respondent are collectively referred to as the \"**Parties**.\" The Parties' representatives and their addresses are listed above on page (i).\n\n5.\n\nThis Decision addresses the Respondent's objection to jurisdiction on the basis that the Claimant failed to satisfy the requirements of Articles 9(1) and (2) of the BIT, which, the Respondent argues, \"conditions resort to international arbitration on prior negotiations between\" the Georgian and Azerbaijani Governments, and the Claimant did not seek or initiate such negotiations (the \"**Inter-State Negotiation Objection**\").1\n\nSee Respondent\u2019s Reply to Claimant\u2019s Response on Provisional Measures (February 5, 2021) (\"**Resp. Reply**\"), para. 63. The Inter-State Negotiation Objection is also referred to as the \"bifurcated objection\" in this Decision.\n\n6.\n\nThe underlying dispute in this arbitration concerns the Claimant's status as the ultimate beneficial owner of Caucasus Online LLC (\"**CO**\"), a telecommunications company formed under the laws of Georgia. The Claimant explains that he \"made and acquired his investment in CO\" in January 2019 (the \"**Transaction**\"). According to the Claimant, CO is the sole owner of a submarine, fibre-optic cable under the Black Sea, by which it \"transits internet traffic from Europe to the South Caucasus and Caspian region.\" The Georgian National Communications Commission (\"**GNCC**\"), a State administrative agency, authorizes CO\u2019s operations.2\n\nRequest for Arbitration (October 19, 2020) (\"**Request**\"), paras. 10-13.\n\n7.\n\nThe Claimant\u2019s position is that GNCC has (a) arbitrarily and illegitimately asserted a right to control and veto the Transaction by which Mr. Hasanov attained his CO beneficial ownership status; and (b) wrongfully taken retaliatory measures when the Claimant \"insisted that the Transaction was unconstrained by the GNCC\u2019s overreaching attempt to regulate.\" The Claimant contends, in short, that the GNCC did not have the power to oblige CO to obtain the GNCC\u2019s \"prior consent to any future change in the beneficial ownership of CO (rather than just for a change in direct shareholdings in CO, as required by the Communications Law).\"3 Nonetheless, he and the \"Seller\" in the Transaction (Mr. Khvicha Makatsaria) kept the GNCC and the Georgian Government \"fully informed of the potential change in beneficial ownership of CO.\"4\n\nRequest, paras. 14-16. The \"**Communications Law**\" is The Law of Georgia on Electronic Communications, June 2, 2005 (CLA-2).\n\nRequest, para. 17.\n\n8.\n\nThe Respondent\u2019s position in the underlying dispute is that the Claimant has attempted, \"in plain defiance of the applicable admission requirements, to invest in and take over a company that has a dominant market position in a highly regulated industry and owns strategic infrastructure.\" The Respondent explains that \"Georgian law requires notification to and prior approval by the\" GNCC \"of any proposed investment in a telecommunications company authorized by the GNCC that would result in a transfer, direct or indirect, of five percent or more of the ownership in the company.\" This notification requirement applies to CO, but the Claimant \"never sought\" the GNCC\u2019s prior approval \"for any of the transactions that purported to transfer to him a 100 percent indirect, beneficial interest in CO.\" Instead, the Claimant concealed this acquisition from the Georgian authorities.5\n\nRespondent\u2019s Observations on Claimant\u2019s Request for Provisional Measures (December 21, 2020) (\"**Resp. Observations**\"), paras. 2-4.\n\n9.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, Mr. Hasanov willfully defied the GNCC's orders to comply with the law, which prompted the GNCC to issue administrative proceedings and an instruction to CO to eliminate its ownership violation. However, the violation remained and the Claimant \"continued to unlawfully interfere with CO's management.\" The GNCC therefore appointed a \"special manager\" for CO, pursuant to the Communications Law, on October 1, 2020, rather than suspend CO's authorization to operate. The latter option would have carried the risk of harming the economic interests of the State, as well as the \"legitimate interests of authorized persons/licensees in the field of electronic communications, the consumers or the competitive environment in the market.\"6\n\nResp. Observations, paras. 33, 49, 50.\n\n10.\n\nThe Parties' underlying dispute is briefly described by way of background. The issue that this Decision addresses, as identified above, is the Respondent's Inter-State Negotiation Objection. The Tribunal, per its previous ruling,7 considers this objection as a preliminary question.8 The Respondent contends that the Inter-State Negotiation Objection, if successful, would dispose of the entire case.9 The Claimant's position is that even if the objection were successful, it would not dispose of the entire case or of any of the Claimant's claims, because the Claimant would, \"in line with an extensive line of jurisprudence, simply seek a stay of the proceedings and would make renewed attempts to initiate interstate negotiations before pursing the same claims with the same scope.\"10\n\nProcedural Order No. 2, March 26, 2021.\n\nThe State has noted a reservation of right to raise \"substantial jurisdictional objections\" in addition to the Inter-State Negotiation Objection. Resp. Reply, para. 104.\n\nResp. Letter dated February 24, 2021.\n\nCl. Letter dated March 8, 2021; *see also* Claimant\u2019s Submission on Bifurcated Issue, April 23, 2021, para. 107: \"if the Tribunal were minded to give credence to the Respondent\u2019s objection, the appropriate course would be to stay the proceedings, in order for any prior negotiation requirement tob e complied with by the Claimant (or here, its home State).\"\n\n**II. PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND**\n-----------------------------\n\n11.\n\nOn October 19, 2020, ICSID received a Request for Arbitration (\"**Request**\") dated October 19, 2020, from Mr. Nasib Hasanov against Georgia.11\n\nThe Request included an application for provisional measures at paragraphs 110-124. The provisional measures application was subsequently amended on January 12, 2021, as noted below, and the subject of further written and oral submissions by the Parties.\n\n12.\n\nOn October 30, 2020, the Secretary-General of ICSID registered the Request in accordance with Article 36(3) of the ICSID Convention and notified the Parties of the registration. In the Notice of Registration, the Secretary-General invited the Parties to proceed to constitute an arbitral tribunal as soon as possible in accordance with Rule 7(d) of ICSID\u2019s Rules of Procedure for the Institution of Conciliation and Arbitration Proceedings.\n\n13.\n\nFurther to the calendar fixed by the Secretary-General in accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 39(5), on December 21, 2020, the Respondent filed observations on the provisional measures application set out in the Request. On January 12, 2021, the Claimant filed his response, which modified the application for provisional measures. The Respondent submitted its reply on February 5, 2021.\n\n14.\n\nThe Parties agreed to constitute the Tribunal in accordance with Article 37(2)(a) of the ICSID Convention as follows: the Tribunal would consist of three arbitrators, one to be appointed by each Party and the third, presiding arbitrator to be appointed by agreement of the two co-arbitrators.\n\n15.\n\nThe Tribunal is composed of Laurence Shore, a national of the United Kingdom and the United States, President, appointed by agreement of the two co-arbitrators; Stanimir Alexandrov, a national of Bulgaria, appointed by the Claimant; and J. William Rowley, a national of Canada and the United Kingdom, appointed by the Respondent.\n\n16.\n\nOn February 18, 2021, the Secretary-General, in accordance with Rule 6(1) of the ICSID Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings (the \"**Arbitration Rules**\"), notified the Parties that all three arbitrators had accepted their appointments and that the Tribunal was therefore deemed to have been constituted on that date. Ms. Celeste Mowatt, ICSID Legal Counsel, was designated to serve as Secretary of the Tribunal.\n\n17.\n\nOn February 24, 2021, the Respondent submitted an application for bifurcation of the proceedings, seeking to have its Inter-State Negotiation Objection heard as a preliminary issue.\n\n18.\n\nThe Claimant filed his observations in response to the application for bifurcation on March 8, 2021, opposing the request.\n\n19.\n\nFollowing consultations with the Parties, the first session of the Tribunal was scheduled for March 19, 2021, with the provisional measures application and request for bifurcation included in the agenda.\n\n20.\n\nCorrespondence from the Parties dated March 17 and 18, 2021, addressed developments connected to the provisional measures application. The Respondent requested that submissions on the provisional measures application be postponed in light of those developments, and the Claimant accepted postponement of the application *sine die.*\n\n21.\n\nIn accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 13(1), the first session of the Tribunal was held by video conference on March 19, 2021. In addition to the Members of the Tribunal and Tribunal Secretary, the following persons were in attendance:\n\n*For the Claimant:*\n\nMr. Michael Ostrove, DLA Piper France  \nMs. Kate Cervantes-Knox, DLA Piper France  \nMs. S\u00e9r\u00e9na Salem, DLA Piper France  \nMr. Angus Eames, DLA Piper UK  \nMr. Victor Croci, DLA Piper UK  \nMr. Anthony Sinclair, Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan UK  \nMr. Jagdish Menezes, Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan UK  \nMr. Vano Gogelia, PWC Georgia  \nMr. Teymur Taghiyev, Director, Nelgado Ltd\n\n*For the Respondent:*\n\nMs. Claudia Annacker, Dechert (Paris) LLP  \nMr. Eduardo Silva Romero, Dechert (Paris) LLP  \nMs. Erica Stein, Dechert (Paris) LLP  \nMs. Ruxandra Esanu, Dechert (Paris) LLP  \nMr. Panos Theodoropoulos, Dechert (Paris) LLP  \nMr. Hayk Kupelyants, Dechert (London) LLP  \nMs. Mariam Gotsiridze, Ministry of Justice of Georgia  \nMs. Ana Goglidze, Ministry of Justice of Georgia\n\n22.\n\nThe Tribunal deliberated following the session and communicated by letter of March 19, 2021, its decision on the bifurcation request, confirming that its reasons would follow.\n\n23.\n\nFollowing the first session, on March 26, 2021, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 1 recording the agreement of the Parties on procedural matters. Procedural Order No. 1 provides, *inter alia*, that the applicable Arbitration Rules would be those in effect from April 10, 2006, that the procedural language would be English, and that the place of proceeding would be Paris, France. Procedural Order No. 1 also sets out the agreed procedural calendar.\n\n24.\n\nOn the same date, March 26, 2021, the Tribunal also issued Procedural Order No. 2, which set out the Tribunal\u2019s decision on the request for bifurcation. As a result of this Procedural Order, the proceeding on the merits was suspended, pending a decision on the Inter-State Negotiation Objection.\n\n25.\n\nOn April 6, 2021, the Respondent filed a submission on the bifurcated objection.\n\n26.\n\nBy letter of April 8, 2021, the Claimant requested that the Tribunal convene a hearing on the request for provisional measures at its earliest convenience. On April 9, 2021, the Respondent requested that the Tribunal convene the hearing no earlier than May 12, 2021.\n\n27.\n\nOn April 15, 2021, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 3 concerning the request for provisional measures. The Order confirmed that submissions on provisional measures would be heard at the hearing scheduled for May 12, 2021, and provided directions to the Parties pending the Tribunal\u2019s decision on the request for provisional measures.\n\n28.\n\nOn April 23, 2021, the Claimant filed a submission on the bifurcated objection.\n\n29.\n\nBy emails of May 11, 2021, the Parties informed the Tribunal that the Parties had agreed to request the postponement of the hearing to pursue settlement of the dispute. The Tribunal confirmed its approval of the suspension by ICSID\u2019s email of May 11, 2021.\n\n30.\n\nBy email of June 25, 2021, the Claimant informed the Tribunal that the Parties were engaged in ongoing discussions regarding the settlement of the dispute, and agreed to the temporary suspension of the procedural calendar.\n\n31.\n\nThe Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 4 on June 29, 2021, which confirmed that the procedural calendar was suspended in view of the Parties\u2019 agreement.\n\n32.\n\nOn July 26, 2021, the Claimant requested that the hearing on provisional measures and the bifurcated objection be rescheduled. The hearing was subsequently scheduled for November 23, 2021.\n\n33.\n\nOn November 11, 2021, the Claimant filed an updated submission regarding the request for provisional measures.\n\n34.\n\nOn November 18, 2021, the Respondent filed observations on the Claimant\u2019s submission of November 11, 2021.\n\n35.\n\nOn November 19, 2021, the Respondent filed a request for the Tribunal to decide on confidentiality of documents. The Claimant filed observations on this request on November 22, 2021, and the Tribunal\u2019s decision on the request was conveyed to the Parties by letter of November 22, 2021.\n\n36.\n\nOn November 23, 2021, the Tribunal held a hearing on provisional measures and the bifurcated objection by video conference (the '**Hearing**\u2019). In support of their respective positions on these two issues, the Parties filed slide presentations (one presentation per Party, per issue; a total of four presentations) on the day of the Hearing.\n\n37.\n\nIn addition to the Members of the Tribunal and the Secretary of the Tribunal, the following persons attended the Hearing:12\n\n*For the Claimant:*\n\nMr. Michael Ostrove, DLA Piper France  \nMs. Kate Cervantes-Knox, DLA Piper France  \nMs. Serena Salem, DLA Piper France  \nMs. Lucia Bizikova, DLA Piper UK  \nMs. Katherine Roe, DLA Piper UK  \nMr. Anthony Sinclair, Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan UK  \nMr. Vano Gogelia, PWC Georgia  \nMs. Natia Kobosnidze, PWC Georgia  \nMr. Teymur Taghiyev, Director, Nelgado Ltd  \nMr. Toghrul Ahmadov, CLO, Neqsol Holding\n\n*For the Respondent:*\n\nMs. Claudia Annacker, Dechert (Paris) LLP  \nMr. Eduardo Silva Romero, Dechert (Paris) LLP  \nMs. Erica Stein, Dechert (Paris) LLP  \nDr. Eniko Horvath, Dechert (Paris) LLP  \nMs. Ruxandra Esanu, Dechert (Paris) LLP  \nMr. Hayk Kupelyants, Dechert (London) LLP  \nMr. Panos Theodoropoulos, Dechert (Paris) LLP  \nMs. Mariam Gotsiridze, Ministry of Justice of Georgia  \nMs. Ana Goglidze, Ministry of Justice of Georgia  \nDr. Beka Dzamashvili, Ministry of Justice of Georgia\n\nThe Hearing was transcribed by T. McGowan, G. Vaughan, and L. Gulland, with the Parties\u2019 corrections to the transcript (transmitted on December 23 and 27, 2021) subsequently incorporated. The Hearing transcript (as amended to reflect the Parties\u2019 corrections) is referred to as \"Tr. [page]\" in this Decision.\n\n38.\n\nFollowing the Hearing, by letter of November 26, 2021, the Tribunal informed the Parties that that it intended to issue a motivated decision as soon as possible, but that it did not consider that it would be procedurally efficient for the Tribunal to issue its ruling without reasons, followed by a motivated decision, as had been raised at the conclusion of the Hearing. The Tribunal further confirmed by the same correspondence that the Tribunal would confer with the Parties regarding the date for costs submissions following the ruling on the bifurcated objection, consistent with the Parties\u2019 communication of May 3, 2021 in this regard.\n\n39.\n\nFurther to para. 21.3 of Procedural Order No. 1, the Parties were invited to indicate any corrections to the transcript of the Hearing, and the corrections transmitted by the Parties on December 23 and 27, 2021, were incorporated and the amended version of the Transcript was distributed to the Parties.\n\n40.\n\nThe Parties were also invited to indicate any desired redactions to the Transcript, in reference to para. 20.6 of Procedural Order No. 1 and the Parties\u2019 correspondence of May 3, 2021, and November 5, 2021, indicating an agreement to publication of the transcript. Redactions were requested by the Respondent on December 27, 2021. The Claimant\u2019s objected to the requested redactions on January 25, 2022, and the Respondent replied to the Claimant\u2019s objections on February 1, 2022. The Tribunal\u2019s decisions on the redactions were set out in the Tribunal\u2019s letter of February 15, 2022.\n\n**III. THE PARTIES' WRITTEN AND ORAL SUBMISSIONS**\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n**A. The Respondent's Inter-State Negotiation Objection**\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n41.\n\nThe Tribunal summarizes, in this section of the Decision, the Respondent\u2019s position on the bifurcated objection. While this summary is not intended to be comprehensive, the Tribunal has carefully considered all written and oral submissions, documentary evidence, and legal authorities presented by the Parties.\n\n42.\n\nThe Respondent observes that the BIT must be interpreted in accordance with the general rule of interpretation codified in Article 31(1) of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (\"**VCLT**\") (May 23, 1969, CLA-12) *(i**.e.,* \"in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to its terms, in their context, and in light of the BIT\u2019s object and purpose\").13 Pursuant to the VCLT, Article 9 of the BIT conditions investor-State arbitration on \"prior negotiations between the Republic of Azerbaijan and Georgia for six months.\"14\n\nRespondent\u2019s Submission on the Bifurcated Issue (April 6, 2021) (\"**Resp. Submission**\"), para. 15.\n\nResp. Submission, para. 16.\n\n43.\n\nArticle 9 of the BIT15 provides, in pertinent part:\n\n\" 1. Any dispute that may arise between an investor of one Contracting Party and the other Contracting Party in connection with an investment in the territory of the latter Contracting Party, will be subject to negotiations between the Contracting Parties in dispute.\n\n2. If any dispute between an investor of one Contracting Party and the other Contracting Party cannot be settled in such a manner within 6 months from the day on which a written claim was submitted, the investor shall be entitled to refer the matter:\n\n...\n\nb) to the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID), having regard to the relevant provisions of the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of other States, opened for signature in Washington, District of Columbia, on 18 March 1965, when both Contracting Parties have become parties to this Convention, or ... .\"\n\nThe Parties agree that the Russian version of the BIT prevails for the purposes of interpretation. The Claimant adduces in CLA-1 the Russian version translated into English; the Respondent adduces in RL-65 the Preamble and Article 9 of the Russian text translated into English. The only difference between the translations (which the Tribunal considers to be insignificant and the Parties do not address) is in Article 9 (1): CLA-1 uses the word \"negotiation\"; RL-65 uses the word \"negotiations.\" The Tribunal will use, for convenience, \"negotiations,\" but reiterates that it does not view the difference to carry any significance.\n\n44.\n\nThe BIT\u2019s Preamble provides that the \"Government of Georgia and the Government of the Republic of Azerbaijan, hereinafter referred to as the 'Contracting Parties.\u2019\"\n\n45.\n\nIn view of these provisions, the Respondent argues that the negotiation precondition to arbitration plainly refers to negotiation between Georgia and the Republic of Azerbaijan - the \"Contracting Parties.\" The BIT employs the terms \"Contracting Parties\" or \"Contracting Party\" 75 times, in each instance to refer to one or both of Georgia and the Republic of Azerbaijan. On the other hand, when the BIT refers to an investor and the host State, \"it consistently employs the undefined term \"parties,\" as in Article 9(2)(c) and Article 6.\n\n46.\n\nThe BIT\u2019s use of \"Contracting Parties\" was clearly deliberate and conveys a different meaning than \"parties.\" The Respondent cites, *e.g.,* a WTO Appellate Body ruling (RL-20, *EC Measures Concerning Meat and Meat Products (Hormones),* para. 164) in support: the use of different words in different places is designed to convey different meanings; a treaty interpreter is not entitled to assume that such usage was merely inadvertent.\n\n47.\n\nThe Claimant nonetheless contends that the use of \"Contracting Parties\" in Article 9(1) was a drafting error, on the basis that it is an oxymoron: (a) only one Contracting Party can be \"in dispute\" in an investor-State arbitration, and (b) requiring negotiations by the contracting States to attempt to settle an investor-State dispute would defeat the purpose of investor-State arbitration. This position, however, is contrary to investment treaty practice: at least twenty BITs condition resort to arbitration on prior inter-State negotiations or conciliation. In at least seven Azerbaijani and Georgian BITs there is a pre-condition-to-arbitration provision similar to that in Article 9 of the BIT. It is in in the interest of contracting States to resolve disputes before going to arbitration. These inter-State negotiation pre-conditions are clearly not drafting errors; Article 9\u2019s terms \"make sense in their context.\"16\n\nResp. Submission, para. 37.\n\n48.\n\nFurther, the Claimant\u2019s position, which would effectively rewrite Article 9(1), is incompatible with the treaty interpretation rule that every treaty term must be interpreted to give it meaning rather than to deprive it of meaning. Authorities in support of this rule include, *e.g., Murphy v. Ecuador* (RL-81) and *Japan - Taxes on Alcoholic Beverages* (RL-83). Treaty interpretation must also proceed from the common intentions of the contracting States as expressed in the treaty text, not from presumed intentions. Here, the Respondent refers to, *e.g.*, *Wintershall v. Argentina* (RL-33) and *Ping An v. Belgium* (RL-86).\n\n49.\n\nThe Claimant refers to one aspect of the BIT\u2019s object and purpose in the Preamble (\"Intending to create and support favourable conditions for investors of one Contracting Party in the territory of the other Contracting Party\") in support of his position that Article 9(1) should be interpreted to mean investor-State negotiation. However, the Claimant ignores another purpose of the BIT as expressed in the Preamble, which supports the Respondent\u2019s Inter-State negotiation interpretation: \"Desiring to strengthen economic cooperation on a long-term basis for the mutual benefit of both Contracting Parties.\" Moreover, the object and purpose of the BIT cannot in any event override an express condition precedent to arbitration, such as that contained in Article 9(1). The authorities supporting this proposition include *Daimler v. Argentina* (RL-31): \"It is for States to decide how best to protect and promote investments.\"\n\n50.\n\nUnder the plain meaning of Article 9(1), unless the Inter-State Negotiation condition is satisfied, \"the Centre lacks jurisdiction and the Tribunal lacks competence.\"17 Consent is the basis for ICSID jurisdiction, and any conditions to a State\u2019s consent to international adjudication constitute limits to that consent. See, *e.g.,* the ICJ\u2019s ruling in *Armed Activities in the Territory of the Congo* (RL-91), and the award in *K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7 v. Turkmenistan* (RL-99). In *K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7,* the tribunal stated that \"an arbitration agreement, such as would provide for the Centre to have jurisdiction under Article 25 of the ICSID Convention, can only come into existence through a qualifying investor\u2019s acceptance of a host state\u2019s standing offer as made *(i.e.,* under its terms and conditions).\" The phrasing in Article 9(2) of the BIT points to a mandatory requirement, not an option, and the word \"If\u2019 at the beginning of Article 9(2) indicates that \"the exercise of the right to arbitrate granted in Article 9(2) is conditional on prior inter-State negotiations.\"18\n\nResp. Submission, para. 55.\n\nResp. Submission, para. 60.\n\n51.\n\nThe Respondent reiterates that \"Article 9 of the BIT thus expressly articulates a layered sequential dispute resolution system, requiring, as a first step, inter-State negotiations, after which the dispute, if not resolved within 6 months, may escalate to investor-State arbitration.\"19 The fulfilment of the condition is therefore a jurisdictional requirement. The *K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7* tribunal emphasizes that compliance with conditions constitutes a jurisdictional requirement \"in the sense that a failure to meet the conditions has the consequence that there is no jurisdiction to be exercised.\" A long line of cases has held that a negotiation pre-condition is a jurisdictional requirement.20 The Claimant merely cites a handful of cases in support of the contention that it is only \"desirable,\" rather than mandatory for jurisdiction, that the Contracting Parties should negotiate, and those cases are distinguishable on a number of grounds.21\n\nResp. Submission, para. 60.\n\nResp. Submission, paras. 61-65.\n\nResp. Submission, para. 67.\n\n52.\n\nThe Claimant cannot overcome the jurisdictional bar by arguing that inter-State negotiations are outside his control or that they would have been futile. Moreover, non-compliance with the condition cannot be cured by a stay of the arbitral proceedings. At the very least, an investor \"must use reasonable efforts to bring about inter-State negotiations before resorting to international arbitration.\" At a minimum, an investor must submit a \"written claim\" and request that the Contracting States engage in negotiations pursuant to Article 9(1) of the BIT. The Contracting Parties are then under an obligation to negotiate in good faith.\n\n53.\n\nHowever, in this case the Claimant did not take the necessary steps to bring about inter-State negotiations. The BIT does not impose any obligations on a Contracting Party to initiate inter-State negotiations on its own accord. Regardless of whether the Claimant must prompt inter-State negotiations, the critical point is that \"there is a bar to ICSID arbitration if inter-State negotiations have not taken place for six months.\"22 See, *e.g., Urbaser v. Argentina* (RL-88). Thus, if the Contracting Parties failed to act in accordance with their good faith obligations under Article 9(1), their failure would not eliminate the applicability of the condition. See, *e.g.*, the ICJ\u2019s ruling in *Interpretation of Peace Treaties with Bulgaria, Hungary and Romania* (RL-84).\n\nResp. Submission, para. 77.\n\n54.\n\nA stay of the proceedings cannot be implemented as a way to cure non-compliance with a mandatory pre-condition. The Respondent again cites *K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7 v. Turkmenistan:* \"the conditions for jurisdiction not having been met, the Tribunal has no jurisdiction to suspend the proceedings.\" Further, the Claimant\u2019s \"futility\" argument founders on the fact that where \"negotiations have not even been initiated under Article 9(1) of the BIT, Claimant cannot simply assume their futility.\"23 This is especially the case where the Contracting Parties \"have an evident interest in the settlement of the present dispute.\"24\n\nResp. Submission, para. 82.\n\nResp. Submission, para. 83.\n\n55.\n\nWhile initially arguing that no inter-State negotiations are required under Article 9(1), the Claimant has also taken the position that he requested the Azerbaijani Government to engage with the Georgian Government to assist in resolving the dispute, but the Azerbaijani Government took no action to do so.25 The Claimant subsequently alleged that his request to the Azerbaijani Government had been acted on, but no settlement had ensued.26 However, as of April 6, 2021, the Claimant had produced no evidence to support either of these contradictory contentions.27\n\nResp. Submission, para. 86; citing Cl. Letter dated March 8, 2021.\n\nResp. Submission, para. 87; citing First Procedural Session Tr., March 19, 2021, p. 48.\n\nResp. Submission, para. 89. The Respondent observes (footnote 124) that it reserves the right to submit additional evidence and arguments or to object to any evidence that Claimant might adduce, \"should he eventually provide the promised 'details\u2019 of either the Republic of Azerbaijan\u2019s purported refusal to engage with Georgia concerning this dispute or 'contact\u2019 at the inter-State level.\"\n\n56.\n\nAs for the evidence of inter-State negotiations that the Claimant produced with his April 23, 2021 filing,28 the Respondent makes the following points in its hearing presentation slides29 (RJ-slides 23- 24; Tr., pp. 119-124; 159-162) and oral submissions:\n\n\u2022 It is insufficient for the Claimant merely to draw the Contracting Parties\u2019 attention to the existence of an investment dispute.\n\n\u2022 The *Capital Financial Holdings v. Cameroon* case relied on by the Claimant30 is inapposite, since the treaty in that case provided for two alternative pre-arbitral mechanisms (investor-State or inter-State negotiations) and the Respondent (Cameroon), unlike Georgia, had not even acknowledged the investor\u2019s claims.\n\n\u2022 In addition to submitting a written claim, informing the State of the dispute, a potential claimant should also \"explicitly request that the contracting parties engage in inter-state negotiations pursuant to Article 9(1). And there is simply no evidence on record, ..., that Claimant ever made such a request for inter-state negotiations to the contracting parties in the present case\" (Tr., p. 120).\n\n\u2022 C-43, a note dated April 1, 2021, created by the Azerbaijani Ministry of Foreign Affairs for the stated \"purposes of protecting the interests of Claimant in the arbitration,\" does not assist the Claimant\u2019s latest position, which is that some inter-state contacts occurred, thereby satisfying the inter-State negotiation requirement.\n\n\u2022 First, C-43 is an advocacy note, in which the Azerbaijani Government was simply seeking to help the Claimant\u2019s case. Second, the note has no context or details, and does not record that the Claimant requested the Republic of Azerbaijan to initiate negotiations with Georgia pursuant to Article 9. Third, there is no evidence when Azerbaijan actually contacted Georgia. Fourth, the note \"points to no settlement discussions regarding Georgia\u2019s substantive obligations under the BIT,\" and not even a mention of the BIT (Tr., p. 123).\n\n\u2022 Any diligent investor \"would have done something in connection with Article 9(1), and the record shows to us that the investor of our case did simply nothing\" (Tr., p. 160).\n\nClaimant\u2019s Submission on Bifurcated Issue, April 23, 2021 (\"**Cl. Submission**\"), paras. 127-140.\n\nGeorgia\u2019s Statement on the Inter-State Negotiations Requirement, November 23, 2021 (\"**RJ-slides**\").\n\nCl. Submisssion, paras. 128-135, CLA-90.\n\n57.\n\nThe Respondent also rejects the Claimant\u2019s estoppel and \"Most Favoured Nation\" (\"**MFN**\") arguments to establish jurisdiction.31 As for estoppel, under Article 41(1) of the ICSID Convention and the doctrine of Kompetenz-Kompetenz, an arbitral tribunal cannot abdicate the task of determining jurisdiction by reference to the parties\u2019 (pre-arbitral) conduct. It follows that jurisdiction, as stated by the tribunal in *Oded Besserglik v. Republic of Mozambique,* \"cannot be created by invoking the doctrine of estoppel.\"32 The Respondent also refers to other ICSID cases in accordance with this conclusion, such as *Vieira v. Chile* (RL-36Bis-SPA) and *Quiborax v. Bolivia* (RL-129). The Claimant's reliance on *Fraport v. Philippines* (RL-87) and *Desert Line Projects v. Yemen* (RL-132) is misplaced, because those cases involved the \"question whether a respondent State could raise a factual issue - the illegality of an investment - in the context of an objection to jurisdiction *ratione materiae*. Neither case involved an attempt by the claimant to establish jurisdiction on the basis of the doctrine of estoppel.\"33 Estoppel may only preclude a party from invoking a factual premise, \"not the invocation of a jurisdictional objection as such.\"34\n\nOn estoppel, see Resp. Submission, paras. 90-113; RJ-slides 18-21; Tr. pp. 114-118; on MFN, see RJ-slides 14-16; Tr., pp. 113-114.\n\nResp. Submission, para. 92, quoting *Oded Besserglik v. Republic of Mozambique* (RL-34).\n\nResp. Submission, para. 95.\n\nResp. Submission, paras. 96-99.\n\n58.\n\nIf the estoppel doctrine were deemed to apply, the Claimant would have to establish that Georgia made a clear and unequivocal representation concerning the proper interpretation of Article 9 of the BIT, and the Claimant reasonably relied on that representation to his detriment or to Georgia's disadvantage. As a factual matter, the Claimant has not demonstrated either of these elements. The GNCC's participation in discussions with the Claimant without bringing the inter-State negotiation requirement to the Claimant's attention does not constitute a \"clear and unequivocal representation.\"35 Moreover, the purpose of the GNCC's meeting with the Claimant's lawyers was to discuss a resolution \"within the framework of the Georgian legislation\" (R-57). The Claimant's reliance on C-42, the Administration of Georgia's August 25, 2020 letter to the Claimant's lawyers is also unavailing: that letter did not take any position concerning the negotiations required by Article 9. Further, the Claimant has not shown that he changed his position to his detriment or to Georgia's advantage: the Claimant \"had already settled on his erroneous interpretation of Article 9 of the BIT long before he entered into discussions with the GNCC on July 20, 2020, and indeed at the latest by June 22, 2020, when Claimant sent his Notice of Dispute.\"36\n\nResp. Submission, para. 102, citing *Quiborax v. Bolivia* (RL-129).\n\nResp. Submission, para. 108. See also RJ-slides 21 (\"Estoppel cannot be based on a failure to say something where nothing ought 'to have been said,\u2019\" citing *ELSI (US v. Italy)* (RL-141).\n\n59.\n\nThe Claimant\u2019s reliance on the BIT\u2019s MFN clause (Article 4)37 to avoid the inter-State negotiation requirement also fails on several grounds. As a matter of principle, an MFN clause does not apply to a State\u2019s offer to arbitrate \"unless the MFN clause leaves no doubt that the contracting parties intended to include dispute settlement within the scope of operation of the MFN clause.\"38 No such language or intention is expressed in Article 4 of the BIT. Instead, in Article 4, the MFN treatment is closely linked to fair and equitable treatment *(i.e.,* substantive rights). Moreover, an MFN clause cannot override carefully negotiated preconditions to arbitration (*see*, *e.g., Wintershall v. Argentina,* RL-33): these \"are part and parcel of the contracting parties\u2019 integrated offer to arbitrate, which must be accepted by the investor on the terms offered.\"39\n\nArticle 4 (1), (2) states as follows: \"1. Each Contracting Party shall in its territory accord to investments of investors of the other Contracting Party treatment which is fair and equitable and no less favorable than that which it accords to investments of its own investors or of investors of any third State. 2. Each Contracting Party shall in its territory accord to investors of the other Contracting Party, as regards the management, support, use or disposal of its investments, treatment which is fair and equitable and no less favorable than that which it accords to investments of its own investors or of investors of any third State.\"\n\nTr., p. 113; RJ-slides 14, citing, *e.g., Plama v. Bulgaria* (RL-144).\n\nTr., p. 114.\n\n60.\n\nFinally, in respect of costs, the Respondent requests the Tribunal to \"[o]rder Claimant to pay to Respondent the full costs arising out of these proceedings\" and to grant any further relief that the Tribunal deems appropriate (Resp. Submission, para.114).\n\n**B. The Claimant's Opposition to the Inter-State Negotiation Objection**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n61.\n\nThe Claimant\u2019s primary argument is that Article 9 of the BIT, \"properly construed,\" does not require Azerbaijan and Georgia to negotiate in an attempt to resolve the dispute between the Claimant and Georgia. The secondary argument is that even if the Tribunal were to find that Article 9 contains an inter-State negotiations requirement, the Claimant complied with it by appealing to Azerbaijan (early in 2020) to discuss the dispute with the Georgian government (though the Claimant did so \"not because he felt obliged to by the BIT\")40. Further, regardless of the proper interpretation of Article 9, further negotiations, whether between Azerbaijan and Georgia or the Claimant and Georgia, would be pointless, and the \"cooling-off\" period in a treaty should not impede arbitration proceedings.41\n\nCl. Submission, para. 6.\n\nCl. Submission, para. 10, citing *Biwater Gauff v. Tanzania* (RL-114).\n\n62.\n\nThe primary argument: the Respondent\u2019s reading of Article 9 is erroneous. Pursuant to the most basic rules of treaty interpretation, whereby the negotiators\u2019 intent is determined by reference to the ordinary meaning of the treaty\u2019s terms taken in their context, and in light of the treaty\u2019s object and purpose, Article 9(1) requires negotiations between the parties \"in dispute\" - *i.e.,* the investor and the host State - prior to resort to arbitration. Article 9(1)\u2019s reference to \"Contracting Parties in dispute\" is otherwise nonsensical and must be a drafting error. When BITs genuinely require inter-State negotiations, the language is clear and unambiguous.42\n\nCl. Submission, paras. 18-19.\n\n63.\n\nCiting Richard Gardiner\u2019s treatise on treaty interpretation and the *Alemanni v. Argentina* tribunal (CLA-57 and CLA-13), the Claimant contends that \"ordinary meaning\" must not be detached from context, object, and purpose; Article 31 of the VCLT does not impose a \"lexicographical literalism.\" There can be more than one \"ordinary meaning,\" and the task is to decide what the negotiators intended, which requires consideration of context, object, and purpose.43\n\nCl. Submission, paras. 22-25.\n\n64.\n\nThe Respondent\u2019s approach to Article 9(1) amounts to lexicographical literalism that leads to a meaningless result. Read literally, the term \"Contracting Parties in dispute\" is meaningless because the Contracting Parties are not in dispute; only the investor and the host State are in dispute. The Tribunal must adopt an interpretation that goes beyond the ordinary meaning of \"Contracting Parties\" taken in isolation. The words \"in dispute\" cannot be ignored: \"In order to make the phrase *'Contracting Parties in dispute'* meaningful, it is necessary to interpret it as *'parties in dispute'* or as 'the Contracting Party and the investor in dispute\u2019 (as used in the title of Article 9), as the literal words *'Contracting Parties in dispute'* refer to no one at all in the context of Article 9 and thus would lead to no requirement of negotiations of any kind.\"44\n\nCl. Submission, para. 41.\n\n65.\n\nThe Claimant reiterates that his position is that Article 9 is \"inherently ambiguous and must be construed in accordance with the context and the object and purpose of the BIT.\" Among the relevant points of context is that Article 9 - undisputedly - is concerned with investor-State disputes. The title of Article 9 (\"Settlement of disputes between the Contracting Party and an Investor of the other Contracting Party\") establishes this explicitly. Disputes between the Contracting Parties are dealt with in Article 10. Additionally, Article 9(2)\u2019s reference to a \"written claim\" is evidently a claim submitted by the investor and not the investor\u2019s home State. The exercise of diplomatic protection is incompatible with the ICSID system. Since the investor submits the written claim, it must be assumed that the investor participates in the negotiations. Further, only the investor and the host State are in a position to settle the dispute. Thus, the only plausible explanation for Article 9(1)\u2019s reference to \"Contracting Parties\" is that it is a drafting error; the obvious intention was to refer to the investor and the host State, the \"parties in dispute.\"45\n\nCl. Submission, paras. 44-50.\n\n66.\n\nThe Respondent\u2019s interpretation is also contrary to the BIT\u2019s object and purpose. The BIT\u2019s chapeau clarifies that the objective was to \"create and support favourable conditions\" for home State investors in the host State, and to recognise that reciprocal protection of investments will \"stimulate business initiative.\" A main purpose of investor-State arbitration is to \"depoliticize disputes by removing the home State from the picture.\" Thus, the object and purpose of the BIT supports the conclusion that the Claimant\u2019s interpretation of Article 9(1) - the Claimant and the Respondent are to negotiate with each other - is correct. The Respondent\u2019s references to other treaties providing for inter-State negotiations does not assist the Respondent\u2019s interpretation. Almost universally, BITs provide for investor-State negotiations; where two States play any role at all, the role is purely faciliatory.46\n\nCl. Submission, paras. 51-53.\n\n67.\n\nThe Respondent\u2019s interpretation would in fact undermine an investor\u2019s ability to settle a dispute and thereby contravene the object and purpose of the BIT. The Claimant cannot force Azerbaijan to negotiate, and the investor would have no right to participate in the negotiation process. While the Respondent points to the \"economic cooperation\" provision in the chapeau, it does not explain how this provision supports its reading of Article 9(1). Moreover, since there is no inter-State negotiation precondition to arbitration, the BIT\u2019s object and purpose have not overridden a precondition, as alleged by Georgia.47\n\nCl. Submission, paras. 54-57.\n\n68.\n\nThe Respondent\u2019s reliance on \"at least twenty BITs\" which allegedly include an inter-State negotiation precondition is misplaced. First, even if the Respondent\u2019s characterisation of those BITs were accurate, the characterisation is not relevant to the interpretive exercise under the VCLT. Second, the Respondent\u2019s characterisation is misleading:\n\no The Respondent identified fifteen BITs, not twenty, only ten of which have come into force.\n\no The ten in force are a tiny minority of the BITs currently in force around the world.\n\no Where BITs do include the unusual inter-State negotiation requirement, the wording is clear and unambiguous in the dispute resolution clause, as are any notification requirements.\n\no The Respondent\u2019s identification of two BITs (Georgia-Ukraine and Azerbaijan-Kazakhstan) that contain a similar drafting error does not help the Respondent\u2019s case that there can be more than one Contracting Party \"in dispute.\"\n\no Notably, the Respondent omitted to mention the Georgia-BLEU BIT, which demonstrates that \"when the Respondent actually intended to subject recourse to arbitration to inter-State negotiations, it knew perfectly well how to clearly do so.\"\n\no The Respondent has not identified a single treaty award that has interpreted a \"similar clause to require inter-State negotiations as a condition precedent to the commencement of arbitration proceedings.\"48\n\nCl. Submission, paras. 58-62.\n\n69.\n\nThe Claimant contends that even if the Tribunal were to find in favour of the Respondent regarding the existence of an inter-State negotiation requirement, that requirement would be superseded by a more favourable dispute settlement provision in another Georgian BIT by effect of the MFN clause. The Netherlands-Georgia BIT provides direct access to arbitration. The Claimant is entitled to invoke the MFN clause in the BIT, Article 4, to rely on the Netherlands-Georgia dispute resolution clause. Dispute settlement is not an excluded matter under Article 4(3) of the BIT. *See, e.g., Suez v. Argentina* (CLA-62; the failure to refer to dispute settlement in a list of exclusions reinforces the position that an MFN clause can extend to dispute settlement matters). Moreover, many tribunals have concluded that investors may invoke MFN clauses to \"borrow\" dispute settlement provisions from other treaties that do not contain local remedy or negotiation preconditions.49\n\nCl. Submission, paras. 63-75.\n\n70.\n\nEven if the inter-State negotiation requirement existed and was not superseded by the MFN clause, the Tribunal would maintain discretion on whether to apply the requirement. That is the case because an obligation to engage in prior negotiations is procedural and not jurisdictional in nature. This is the prevailing view of treaty tribunals. At most, this procedural issue affects the admissibility of the claim. Additionally, Professor J. Paulsson has opined (CLA-68) that conditions precedent such as participating in a conciliation attempt pose \"no problem\" to the authority of the tribunal itself.50\n\nCl. Submission, paras. 76-79.\n\n71.\n\nAlong these lines, Georgia's objection is at best an admissibility objection. The phrases in Article 9 \"simply denote a conditionality to the reference of the dispute to arbitration, without illuminating the nature of the conditionality.\" Article 9 of the BIT establishes the consent of the Contracting Parties to \"any dispute\" and then defines the procedure that an investor should follow before it involves the State's consent to arbitrate. The negotiation requirement \"cannot be read to condition the consent to arbitrate itself.\" *See, e.g.,* *\u0130**\u00e7kale* *\u0130**n**\u015f**aat Limited* *\u015e**irketi v. Turkmenistan* (CLA-69), which should be preferred to the reasoning in *K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7 v. Turkmenistan*; *Burlington Resources v. Ecuador* (CLA-70); *Merrill & Ring v. Canada* (CLA-54); *Westwater Resources v. Turkey* (CLA-55). The Respondent relies on cases that reflect a minority view or provide obiter comments or concern contexts distinguishable from the present case (*e.g.*, *Mabco v. Kosovo* (RL-103); *Enron v. Argentina* (RL-101); *Tulip v. Turkey* (RL-105); *Itisaluna Iraq v. Iraq* (RL-104); *Almasryia v. Kuwait* (RL-105); *Murphy v. Ecuador* (RL-108)).51\n\nCl. Submission, paras. 80-100.\n\n72.\n\nThe Claimant\u2019s \"purported non-compliance\" with a negotiation precondition should not in any event result in the dismissal of his claims. Any prejudice that the Respondent might claim to suffer from non-compliance could be addressed by a costs order (which would in any event be negligible). In reality, Georgia has suffered no prejudice, since it has been in negotiations with the Claimant since at least March 2020. Dismissal, on the other hand, could prompt a number of negative reactions from the Respondent, which could endanger the Claimant\u2019s investment. If the Tribunal were nonetheless minded to give credence to the inter-State Negotiation Objection, the appropriate step would be to suspend the proceedings, so that the Claimant (or Azerbaijan) could comply any prior negotiation requirement. Several investment treaty tribunals and the ICJ have adopted the suspension approach.52\n\nCl. Submission, paras. 102-109.\n\n73.\n\nAssuming an inter-State negotiation precondition existed, the doctrines of estoppel and good faith preclude the Respondent from enforcing the precondition. Estoppel applies in circumstances where, from March to September 2020, the Claimant sought to resolve the dispute through meetings the Respondent\u2019s representatives and issuing \"written invitations\" to the Respondent\u2019s representatives (including but not limited to the GNCC) to participate in negotiations. The invitations referenced Article 9 of the BIT, as did C-26, the Claimant\u2019s letter of June 22, 2020, which constituted a written claim of dispute under Article 9(2). The Respondent participated in meetings, and at no time did Georgia indicate that negotiations should instead take place between Azerbaijan and Georgia. It should have done so had it thought so; evidently, Georgia understood that Article 9 required investor-State negotiations (assuming that Georgia was acting in good faith).53\n\nCl. Submission, paras. 110-112.\n\n74.\n\nThe Respondent is therefore estopped from arguing that the settlement negotiations did not satisfy Article 9. Further, the duty of good faith in Articles 26 and 31(1) of the VCLT also precludes the Respondent from challenging the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction.54\n\nCl. Submission, para. 113.\n\n75.\n\nThe Respondent\u2019s reliance on arbitral awards that reject the use of estoppel and related doctrines to establish jurisdiction is misplaced. First, they are inapposite because the alleged inter-State negotiation requirement is procedural, not jurisdictional. Second, it is well-established that tribunals can apply the estoppel doctrine as a defence to jurisdictional challenges. *See, e.g., Fraport v. Philippines* (RL-87); *Desert Line Projects v. Yemen* (RL-132). The elements of estoppel have been made out in this case: the Respondent impliedly represented that it considered the Claimant\u2019s settlement attempts to accord with Article 9; the Claimant relied on those representations; and it would be unjust if the Respondent were allowed to change its position.55\n\nCl. Submission, paras. 113-123.\n\n76.\n\nThe duty of good faith, independently from the estoppel doctrine, also precludes the Respondent\u2019s jurisdictional objection. By failing to correct the Claimant\u2019s alleged misunderstanding of Article 9, the Respondent acted contrary to Article 26 of the VCLT.56\n\nCl. Submission, paras. 124-125.\n\n77.\n\nThe Claimant concludes its April 23, 2021 Submission with sections on (a) its compliance with the inter-State negotiation requirement in the event that such a requirement exists (Cl. Submission, paras. 126-157); and alternatively (b) the futility of compliance (C1. Submission, paras. 158-163). These topics were also the starting points for the Claimant\u2019s presentation at the November 23, 2021 Hearing (jurisdictional part): CJ-slides 2-10 and Tr., pp. 127-135, 169-176 (compliance); CJ-slides 11-14 and Tr., pp. 135-137 (futility).\n\n*(i) Compliance*\n----------------\n\n78.\n\nThe award in *Capital Financial Holdings* (CLA-90) is instructive. There, even though the language referred to conciliation between the Contracting Parties through the diplomatic channel, the tribunal found that the investor had no obligation to ensure that such conciliation occurred or to initiate such conciliation. Instead, the investor was required only to \"take all necessary measures that could reasonably be expected from it, in order to inform the authorities of both Contracting Parties to the Treaty about the existence and evolution of the dispute.\" The Contracting Parties were then responsible for initiating conciliation, if they so wished (CLA-90, paras. 158-166).\n\n79.\n\nThe *Capital Financial Holdings* approach applies to the present case. At most, Article 9(1) obligates the Claimant to inform the Contracting Parties about the dispute so that they may undertake negotiations. The Claimant did so: *see, e.g.,* C-26 (Cl. Letter dated June 22, 2020); C-43 (Letter from the Azerbaijani Ministry of Foreign Affairs dated April 23, 2021). Azerbaijan raised the issue with Georgian officials during the course of several meetings, including but not limited to meetings in September, October, and November 2020. Moreover, the BIT does not require that the investor request that the Contracting Parties engage in inter-State negotiations; the BIT only requires the investor to submit a written claim to the host State.\n\n80.\n\nAt the Hearing (Tr., pp. 127-128), the Claimant stated that it does not matter whether the BIT requires that the States \"negotiate for six months prior to filing a claim., ... . [W]e learnt belatedly that our client actually had requested the Azerbaijani Government to reach out to Georgia, starting nearly a year before the case was filed; not because of an obligation to do so, but simply because Mr Hasanov was trying all methods available to resolve the dispute.\" The Claimant further argued that, with respect to Georgia, \"after months of in-person discussions seeking to resolve the dispute, Claimant wrote several times to Respondent formally seeking an amicable settlement... . Claimant also informed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Azerbaijan, his home State, back in January 2020\" (Tr., pp. 131-132). The Respondent incorrectly contends that six months of negotiations must actually have taken place: the BIT says that \"arbitration can be filed if the two Contracting Parties - reading it the way Respondent does - cannot settle the -if the case cannot be settled in such a manner\" (Tr., p. 134).\n\n81.\n\nThe Claimant reiterated during the Hearing (Tr., pp. 169-176) that, as reflected in C-25 (Cl. Letter dated May 22, 2020), meetings with the Georgian Prime Minister\u2019s office and the Claimant\u2019s representatives had previously taken place, but without any meaningful progress. Thus, the Respondent is wrong to say that the Claimant did nothing to fulfil its Article 9 obligations. C-43 (the Azerbaijani Foreign Ministry\u2019s April 1, 2021, letter), read with R-73 (the translation of the cover note), also shows that when Azerbaijani officials contacted or attempted to contact Georgian officials, they did so in relation to, as Azerbaijan understood it, an investor-protection dispute.\n\n*(ii) Futility*\n---------------\n\n82.\n\nWhether the Tribunal determines that the inter-State negotiation requirement is a matter of admissibility or of jurisdiction, it is clear that any further efforts to satisfy the requirement would be futile; such efforts would have no reasonable prospect of resolving the dispute. In these circumstances, many tribunals have found that there is no requirement to comply with a \"cooling-off\" period, and that failure to do so is not a jurisdictional bar. *See, e.g., Ethyl Corp. v. Canada* (CLA-64); *Orazul v. Argentina* (CLA-92).\n\n83.\n\nFinally, in respect of costs, the Claimant has requested that the Tribunal order the Respondent \"immediately to pay the Claimant\u2019s full costs arising out of the Bifurcated Issue, to be assessed following further submissions from the parties,\" and to grant such further relief as the Tribunal may consider appropriate (Cl. Submission, para. 164.2).\n\n**IV. THE TRIBUNAL'S ANALYSIS**\n-------------------------------\n\n84.\n\nThere are four main questions that the Tribunal must initially address to resolve Georgia\u2019s Inter-State Negotiation Objection:\n\n(i) Does Article 9 of the BIT include an inter-State negotiation precedent step to arbitration?\n\n(ii) If so, is this precedent step a precondition to arbitration?\n\n(iii) If it is a precondition to arbitration, what must be done to satisfy the precondition?\n\n(iv) Has the precondition been satisfied in this case?\n\n85.\n\nDepending on the answers to the above questions, it may be necessary to address the issues of estoppel, futility, good faith, and the operation of the MFN clause (Article 4) in the BIT.\n\n**A. Article 9 and Inter-State Negotiation**\n--------------------------------------------\n\n86.\n\nWhile certain awards and rulings of international tribunals, cited by the Parties, may aid the Tribunal in reaching its answers, the assistance is limited to possible approaches for resolving arguably similar matters. The Tribunal has not been referred to an on-point decision that considered the same treaty terms. While such a decision would not of course constitute precedential authority, it would have provided a useful platform for analysis of the questions.\n\n87.\n\nThe phrase that causes the Article 9(1) interpretive difficulties is \"will be subject to negotiation between the Contracting Parties in dispute.\" The initial quandary is posed by the last part of the phrase - \"Contracting Parties in dispute.\" Baldly stated, the Respondent contends that \"Contracting Parties,\" a defined term in the BIT, cannot be removed from the interpretive framework, and the words \"in dispute\" need to be understood in the context of the clause as a whole and the BIT as a whole. The Claimant, on the other hand, contends that \"Contracting Parties\" must be a drafting error; those words cannot fit with \"in dispute\" and must be replaced by the word \"parties.\"\n\n88.\n\nThe Tribunal is guided by the interpretive principles set out in Article 31 of the VCLT (\"A treaty shall be interpreted in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in light of its object and purpose\") and by generally accepted principles that are consistent with Article 31, such as interpretation should give meaning and effect to all treaty terms. Pursuant to this guidance, the Tribunal makes the following observations.\n\n(i) The interpretive starting point is that the Contracting Parties, Azerbaijan and Georgia, meant to draft \"Contracting Parties in dispute,\" and therefore it is necessary to seek to give meaning to that term without rewriting it, which would entail removing and/or adding words. The intention of the Contracting Parties as expressed in the text of the BIT is the best guide to their common intentions. This does not preclude the possibility that the textual approach may itself lead to a choice of possible meanings, and that in exercising its choice a tribunal will need to pay particular attention to the treaty\u2019s objects and purposes (of which there may also be a range of policies in play). However, it should not be presumed, as a starting point, that a certain type of instrument - here, an investment protection treaty - entails a certain formulation, and if the text does not reflect that formulation, it should further be presumed that the Contracting Parties have made a drafting error. In short, neither intentions nor mistakes should be presumed; the text should be examined.\n\n(ii) The Respondent has correctly placed importance on \"Contracting Parties\" being a defined term in the BIT, on its appearing many times in the BIT and clearly referring to Azerbaijan and Georgia, and, above all, on the contrary appearance of \"parties\" in Article 9(2)(c) (which, tellingly, is part of the same dispute resolution provision) and Article 6 of the BIT, where the reference to the investor and the State is clearly intended. It is apparent, then, that in using \"Contracting Parties\" the intent was to refer to Azerbaijan and Georgia.\n\n(iii) While not a textual point, it is nonetheless noteworthy in relation to the Claimant\u2019s \"drafting error\" position that, at approximately the same time as the BIT (March 8, 1996), Azerbaijan entered into an investment protection treaty with Kazakhstan (RL-23; September 16, 1996) that includes the phrase \"shall be the subject of negotiations between the Contracting Parties involved in the dispute;\" and Georgia entered into an investment protection treaty with Ukraine (RL-27; January 9, 1995) that includes the phrase \"will be subject to negotiations between the Contracting Parties in dispute.\" While the Claimant rightly says that these treaties (and others relied on by the Respondent for its \"Contracting Parties\" argument) form an extremely small proportion of the approximately 3,000 investor protection instruments, this minority status carries less significance than the fact that, during the same general time frame as the BIT (both before and after its entry into force), Azerbaijan and Georgia used a substantially similar phrase to designate - on the face of the treaty texts - inter-State negotiations for an investor-State dispute.\n\n(iv) To be sure, the words \"in dispute\" are problematic, as the Claimant contends, since, in Article 9(1), the \"dispute\" that may arise is between an investor and the host State. Additionally, given the Respondent\u2019s position on the nature of the negotiation requirement, the words \"in dispute\" might have been omitted. However, the words \"in dispute\" do not nullify the viability of an inter-State negotiation requirement; to the contrary, they support such a requirement.\n\n\u2022 First, there is the textual or semantic point. Article 9(1) and Article 9(2), in their opening lines, recognize that the dispute is between the investor and the host State. However, read in context with the beginning of Article 9(1) - and the need to retain the defined term, \"Contracting Parties,\" in the phrase /'Contracting Parties in dispute,\" the words \"in dispute\" denote not only that Azerbaijan and Georgia are the States involved in the dispute (\"involved in the dispute\" is the usage in the Azerbaijan-Kazakhstan BIT; see above), but also are effectively \"in dispute,\" since they are to negotiate with each other - albeit not in a diplomatic protection framework. Article 9(1) refers to any dispute that may arise between, first, the investor of one Contracting Party, and, second, the other Contracting Party in which the investor has an investment *(i.e.,* the host State); the dispute is then subject to negotiation between the Contracting Parties (\"in dispute\"). In seeking to give meaning to all treaty terms, it is reasonable to posit that the words \"in dispute\" indicate that the investor brings the home State into the dispute with the host State through negotiation on the investor\u2019s behalf.\n\n\u2022 As the Respondent has argued, negotiation by the Contracting States to seek to resolve an investor-State dispute is neither unheard of nor contrary to the purpose, in general terms, of investor-State dispute settlement nor inconsistent with the object and purpose of this particular BIT. Again, the issue is not whether the majority - or, in fact, the overwhelming majority - of BITs eschew the notion of inter-State negotiations to resolve investor-State disputes. A few BITs, as identified by the Respondent, do include such a procedure, and among these are BITs entered into by Azerbaijan and Georgia at around the same time as the BIT in this case. While certain fundamental features of diplomatic protection do not have a place in the ICSID framework, the notion of a home State seeking to negotiate on behalf of its investor in advance of an ICSID arbitral proceeding is not precluded by the ICSID Convention, would not upend investor-State arbitration, and does not signify the revival of diplomatic protection. It reflects, in part, the reality that nationality is a fundamental feature of investor-State arbitration.\n\n\u2022 As the Respondent has commented, an inter-State negotiation requirement is consistent with the object and purpose of the BIT (Resp. Submission, para. 52). Negotiation between the Contracting Parties in an attempt to resolve an investor-State dispute supports the BIT\u2019s purpose to strengthen the Contracting Parties\u2019 long-term economic cooperation. Moreover, an inter-State negotiation requirement is not at odds with the object and purpose relied upon by the Claimant (\"create and support favorable conditions for investors of one Contracting Party in the territory of the other Contracting Party\") or the third objective and purpose in the Preamble (\"reciprocal protection of investments\").\n\n89.\n\nFor the reasons set out above, the Tribunal finds that Article 9(1) of the BIT provides for inter-State negotiation. Read with Article 9(2) it is clear that inter-State negotiation, in some manner (discussed below), precedes the investor\u2019s entitlement to refer his dispute with the host State to ICSID arbitration. The next question for the Tribunal to consider is whether this precedent step is a *precondition* to ICSID arbitration: that is, must the precedent step be satisfied in order for the investor to proceed to arbitration. If that is the case, the Tribunal must then determine what is required to satisfy the precondition and whether the precondition has been satisfied.\n\n**B. Admissibility or Jurisdiction**\n------------------------------------\n\n90.\n\nThe Parties have each cited to the Tribunal lengthy lines of awards/decisions in which the admissibility/jurisdiction question is considered. The Claimant\u2019s position, discussed above, is that \"a time-restricted 'cooling-off\u2019 or prior negotiation requirement, such as the asserted inter-State negotiation requirement, is a procedural condition, at most affecting the admissibility of the claim. It is not a matter concerning the jurisdiction of the Tribunal\" (Cl. Submission, para. 77). This is, the Claimant contends, the prevailing view of tribunals. The Claimant relies, in particular, on the reasoning of the tribunal majority in *\u0130**\u00e7kale* *\u0130**n**\u015f**aat v. Turkmenistan,* CLA-69 (including the *\u0130**\u00e7kale* critique of the tribunal majority\u2019s reasoning in *K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7 v. Turkmenistan,* RL-99, on which the Respondent relies), as well as the scholarly article of Professor J. Paulsson (CLA-68). The Claimant also dismisses the cases relied on by the Respondent as *obiter* or inapposite for factual reasons.\n\n91.\n\nThe Respondent\u2019s position, as discussed above, is that any conditions to a State\u2019s consent to arbitration (or international adjudication), including negotiation requirements, constitute limits on that consent. Thus, the inter-State negotiation requirement is jurisdictional in nature; more than twenty cases confirm that \"jurisdictional\" is the correct designation for such a requirement (Resp. Submission, paras. 55-57; RJ-slides 8-12). Moreover, numerous tribunals have relied on findings that the Claimant characterizes as *obiter*. The Respondent places particular weight on the reasoning in the *K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7 v. Turkmenistan* decision.\n\n92.\n\nIn reaching its finding on this issue, the Tribunal first notes that while both Parties fully appreciate that the Tribunal is not bound by any \"precedent,\" they nonetheless wish to impress upon the Tribunal that many previous awards (the Claimant posits a prevailing view in its favor) support their respective positions. The Claimant also cautions the Tribunal that it should not reach its determination \"on this important doctrinal issue by reference to *obiter* remarks of previous tribunals\" (Cl. Submission, para. 96).\n\n93.\n\nHowever, the Tribunal considers that a \"scorecard\" of admissibility/jurisdiction rulings will not be of particular assistance to it, nor will an exercise in distinguishing *\"obiter\"* from \"holdings\" - in investment arbitration, where Parties often refer to scholarly writings to support their positions and where no *stare decisis* doctrine applies, every authority that is adduced is effectively *\"obiter.\"* Suffice it to say that there are *many* eminent tribunals and scholarly opinions on opposite sides of this question, and many have motivated their rulings effectively. The potential usefulness of the authorities depends on the strength of their analysis of reasonably similar issues, taking into account the underlying context of the relevant BIT. Moreover, in this particular area of international investment law, the authorities on which the Parties - represented, as in this arbitration, by extremely experienced counsel - have themselves placed the greatest weight may provide the most efficient route to reaching a determination. As indicated above, the authorities in this instance are *K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7 v. Turkmenistan* (for the Respondent), and, for the Claimant, *\u0130**\u00e7kale* *\u0130**n**\u015f**aat v. Turkmenistan* (which relies in part on Professor Paulsson\u2019s article; consequently, the Tribunal does not quote that article; see Cl. Submission, para. 79 for a lengthy quotation).\n\n94.\n\nThe *K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7* tribunal57 made, *inter alia,* the following observations:\n\n(i) An arbitration agreement that would provide for jurisdiction under Article 25 of the ICSID Convention \"can only come into existence through a qualifying investor\u2019s acceptance of a host state's standing offer as made *(i.e.,* under its terms and conditions)\" (para. 6.2.1).\n\n(ii) \"There is no dispute between the parties that states which wish to agree to ICSID arbitration are free to impose conditions that inform their consent to arbitrate\" (para. 6.2.3).\n\n(iii) \"The adoption of language which requires that a series of steps *shall* be taken, and which provide for a right to arbitrate, *provided that* another step has been taken, is an obvious construction of a condition precedent. Indeed, a number of reputed dictionaries offer a definition of 'provided\u2019 (followed by 'that\u2019) to indicate a meaning of 'on the condition or understanding (that).\u2019 When such conditions are set out in the [Dispute Resolution Provisions] of a BIT (*as conditions of the Contracting Parties\u2019 offer to arbitrate),* which are the very source of an ICSID tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction, compliance with them constitutes a jurisdictional requirement, in the sense that a failure to meet the conditions has the consequence that there exists no jurisdiction to be exercised\" (para. 6.2.9).\n\n(iv) \"Article 26 of the ICSID Convention explicitly recognises that a Contracting State may impose conditions on its consent to arbitration under the ICSID Convention, in a manner that determines the conditions in which jurisdiction may be said to exist and be capable of being exercised (without prejudice to any issue as to admissibility)\" (para. 6.3.4).\n\n(v) Quoting *Daimler v. Argentina:* \"All BIT-based dispute resolution provisions, on the other hand, are by their very nature jurisdictional. The mere fact of their inclusion in a bilateral treaty indicates that they are reflections of the sovereign agreement of two States - not the mere administrative creation of arbitrators. They set forth the conditions under which an investor-State tribunal may exercise jurisdiction with the contracting state parties\u2019 consent, much in the same way in which legislative acts confer jurisdiction upon domestic courts *\"* (para. 6.3.5).\n\nIn a Decision that preceded the unanimous award, Arbitrator W. W. Park dissented (Separate Opinion, dated, 20 May 2013) on the interpretation of the specific language in Art. VII(2) of the Turkey-Turkmenistan BIT; he discerned a disjuncture between a jurisdictional subsection and a second \"permissive\" subsection. His dissent did not raise a specific doctrinal concern, such as asserting that a \"cooling-off\"\u2019 period is by nature a matter of admissibility rather than jurisdiction.\n\n95.\n\nThe *\u0130**\u00e7kale* *\u0130**n**\u015f**aat* majority58 made, *inter alia,* the following observations:\n\n(i) \"In the Tribunal\u2019s view, the proper way to characterize Article VII of the BIT is that it is a dispute resolution clause which, apart from establishing the consent of the State parties to arbitrate, sets out the procedure that an investor must follow, or the steps it must take, before it can invoke the consent to arbitrate given by a State party to the Treaty. First, the investor must notify the State party to the dispute in writing of the dispute that has arisen between them and seek to settle the dispute by consultation and negotiation; this procedural step is set out in Article VII(l). If the dispute cannot be settled in this way within six months from the date of notification, the investor may choose to submit the dispute to international arbitration pursuant to Article VII(2) of the Treaty, 'provided that, if the investor concerned has brought the dispute before the courts of justice of the Party that is a party to the dispute and a final award has not been rendered within one year.\u2019 The Tribunal has decided above that this prior step is in principle mandatory, and accordingly, before the investor can submit the dispute to international arbitration, it must take the additional step of submitting the dispute to local courts. If no final judgment has been rendered within a period of one year, the investor may proceed to arbitration\" (para. 241).\n\n(ii) \"When conceptualized in these terms, it is plain that the 'provided that, if clause does not constitute a jurisdictional requirement that delimits the scope of consent of the State parties to arbitrate; it sets out the procedure, or the step to be taken, in the event the dispute cannot be settled by way of negotiations between the parties, and thus constitutes a procedural rather than a jurisdictional requirement. The provision does not concern the issue of whether the State parties have given their consent to arbitrate - they have - but rather the issue of how that consent is to be invoked by a foreign investor; as an issue of 'how\u2019 rather than 'whether,\u2019 it must be considered a matter of procedure and not as an element of the State parties\u2019 consent. Consequently, any objection raised on the basis of alleged non-compliance by an investor with any of the required procedural steps must be characterized as an objection to the admissibility of the claim rather than as an objection to the tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction. A claim that has not been first submitted to local courts may be said to be inadmissible before an international tribunal on grounds that it is not yet ripe for such submission as all the required procedural steps have not yet been taken\" (para. 242).\n\n(iii) \"On this issue, the Tribunal\u2019s decision diverges from the approach adopted in the *K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7* Award, in which the majority of the tribunal took the view that the domestic litigation requirement constitutes a condition precedent to the State parties\u2019 consent to arbitrate and is therefore an issue of jurisdiction. The majority of the *K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7* tribunal characterized the dispute resolution clause in Article VII of the BIT as the State parties\u2019 'standing offer\u2019 to arbitrate, which then had to be 'accepted\u2019 by the investor. In the view of the *K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7* majority, an arbitration agreement therefore could come into existence only 'through a qualifying investor\u2019s acceptance of a host state\u2019s standing offer as made (i.e., under its terms and conditions).\u2019 The majority referred, in support of its reasoning, to Article 26 of the ICSID Convention, which provides, *inter alia*, that '[a] Contracting State may require the exhaustion of local administrative or judicial remedies as a condition of its consent to arbitration under the Convention.\u2019 Citing Professor Schreuer\u2019s article 'Consent to Arbitration,\u2019 Professor Georges Abi-Saab\u2019s dissenting opinion in *Abaclat and others v. Argentine Republic* and the *Daimler v. Argentine Republic* decision, the majority concluded that 'the requirements set forth in Article VII.2 are to be treated as conditions, and that the failure to meet those conditions goes to the existence of the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction, and are not to be treated as issues of admissibility\u2019\" (para. 243).\n\n(iv) \"With the greatest respect to the distinguished majority of the *K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7* tribunal, this Tribunal is unable to agree with the *K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7* tribunal\u2019s characterization of the issue. The BIT is not a contract; it is a treaty concluded by two States, and consequently the arbitration agreement concluded between one of the State parties and an investor of the other State party is not an arbitration agreement concluded on the basis of privity of contract, that is, on the basis of an 'offer\u2019 and 'acceptance.\u2019 On the contrary, the State\u2019s consent, which is addressed to an anonymous class of foreign investors meeting the relevant nationality requirements, and not specifically to any particular foreign investor, is expressed in a binding manner even before any dispute has arisen, whereas the investor\u2019s consent is usually - including in the present case - expressed only after the dispute has arisen, often with a considerable time interval ... . While it is common and often harmless to somewhat loosely refer to dispute resolution clauses such as Article VII of the BIT as provisions containing the State parties\u2019 'standing offer\u2019 to arbitrate, this is in fact conceptually inaccurate and legally incorrect; Article VII rather contains the State parties\u2019 'consent\u2019 to arbitrate, which is binding on the State as such, without any further '\u2019perfecting,\u2019 as a unilateral undertaking vis-\u00e0-vis a class of foreign investors. Such consent can be invoked by a qualified investor once it has complied with and taken the procedural steps set out in the provision, as analyzed above in paragraph 241. While it is possible to refer, loosely speaking, to each of these steps as a 'condition\u2019 to the State parties\u2019 consent to arbitrate, this is conceptually misleading as compliance with these procedural steps is not a 'condition precedent\u2019 to the State parties\u2019 consent to arbitrate. The State\u2019s consent has been given in Article VII, and it became effective, and as such unconditional, as soon as the Treaty entered into force; there is nothing conditional about it. It is another matter that, in order for the investor to be in a position to invoke the State\u2019s consent to arbitrate in Article VII, it must first take the procedural steps set out in that Article. An investor taking these steps in order to be able to invoke the State\u2019s consent does not affect the consent itself in any way; it only affects the investor\u2019s right to invoke it. In other words, Article VII regulates the procedure for invoking consent; it does not condition the State\u2019s consent. If anything, it rather 'conditions\u2019 the investor\u2019s right to invoke the State\u2019s consent. The *K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7* majority appears to have based its approach on a contractual analogy which, as noted above, is both conceptually inaccurate and legally incorrect. An arbitration agreement included in a contract and an arbitration agreement construed on the basis of a unilateral consent of the State, as expressed in an investment treaty, and the investor\u2019s subsequent invocation of that consent after the dispute has arisen, are two very different types of agreements. While the former is based on privity, the latter is construed after the fact, once the dispute has arisen, and therefore effectively constitutes a hybrid between an arbitration agreement based on privity and an arbitration agreement based on a compromise\" (para. 244).\n\n(v) \"The Tribunal is mindful of the fact that the distinction between jurisdiction and admissibility is often a fine one, and reasonable arbitrators may reasonably disagree on how it should be made and in particular, on how it should be applied in a particular case... . [T]here are two strands of investment treaty jurisprudence on the issue, one of which it considers more persuasive. [The tribunal proceeds to quote Professor Paulsson\u2019s article.]\" (para. 245).\n\nThere is a \"Partially Dissenting Opinion of Professor Philippe Sands QC,\" discussed below. Notably, the *\u0130**\u00e7kale*Parties agreed with the *Kih\u00e7majority* (which included Professor Sands QC) that compliance with Art. VII(2) of the Turkey-Turkmenistan BIT (the same provision at issue in *Kih\u00e7)* was a matter of jurisdiction rather than admissibility.\n\n96.\n\nAs indicated above, Professor Sands QC dissented on the question of admissibility versus jurisdiction in the *\u0130**\u00e7kale* *\u0130**n**\u015f**aat* award, and, in particular, disagreed with the analysis in the paragraphs quoted above. The Tribunal considers his dissenting opinion to be particularly apt.59 Professor Sands QC observes, in relation to paragraph 242, that the majority cites no authority \"for the proposition that a procedure that the drafters of a BIT have required a potential claimant to take is not such as to create an obligation that goes to the existence of a jurisdiction\" (para. 6). He comments that the *\u0130**\u00e7kale* majority criticizes the *K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7* majority for premising its finding on a contractual analogy, when the BIT is not a contract. However, Professor Sands QC notes that the *K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7* majority did not contend that the BIT is a contract or should be treated as such: the agreement that the award referred to is an offer made by the State (in the BIT) and accepted by the investor (para. 7). Further, the *K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7* decision relied heavily on Article 26 of the ICSID Convention and its use in interpreting the BIT and the condition incorporated into the arbitration agreement (para. 8).\n\nAlthough the Claimant relied on the *\u0130**\u00e7kale* *\u0130**n**\u015f**aat* award and the Respondent could have addressed the award in the Hearing (but did not do so), neither Party discussed the partially dissenting opinion of Prof. Sands. The Sands dissent of course forms a part of the *\u0130**\u00e7kale* *\u0130**n**\u015f**aat* award, which both Parties could have discussed.\n\n97.\n\nProfessor Sands QC also commented that the *\u0130**\u00e7kale* *\u0130**n**\u015f**aat* majority accepted that the distinction between admissibility and jurisdiction is \"often a fine one,\" but did not develop its reasoning on that point. Instead, in relying on Professor Paulsson\u2019s article, the majority omitted to address a relevant passage and misconstrued the article. Properly read, the Paulsson article supports the jurisdictional position taken by the *K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7* majority - a position that the Parties themselves accepted in *\u0130**\u00e7kale* *\u0130**n**\u015f**aat*.\n\n98.\n\nThe Tribunal recognizes that the BIT provision at issue in *K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7* and *\u0130**\u00e7kale* *\u0130**n**\u015f**aat* does not contain a negotiation requirement, and therefore the analyses in both of those awards may be of limited assistance to the Tribunal in making its own \"fine distinction\" between admissibility and jurisdiction. However, the explication of consent in relation to mandatory steps in the *K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7* award is instructive in the context of this case. It is apparent that an inter-State negotiation step, to be undertaken in some manner, must be complied with before an investor can refer a dispute to arbitration under Article 9 of the BIT: Article 9 provides that any dispute \"will be subject\" to inter-State negotiation, and \"if the dispute\" cannot be settled in such a manner (within a certain time frame), the investor may refer the dispute to arbitration. A mandatory precedent step connected to a time frame indicates that the Contracting Parties have established a *condition precedent* to arbitration. As the *K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7* majority explains it, a condition precedent qualifies or limits a Contracting Party\u2019s consent to arbitration under the BIT, in the sense that non-compliance with the condition means that the offer extended by the State has not been accepted.\n\n99.\n\nWhile the Tribunal might have been inclined to conclude that non-compliance with the inter-State negotiation condition precedent, set out in Article 9 of the BIT, would have deprived the Tribunal of jurisdiction over the investor\u2019s dispute, the Tribunal does not need to reach that conclusion.60 The Tribunal notes that whether the inter-State negotiation condition precedent, set out in Article 9 of the BIT, is one of jurisdiction or admissibility, it would nevertheless preclude the Tribunal from proceeding to the merits of this dispute if the condition was not met. Therefore, the Tribunal will proceed to discuss what must be done to satisfy the condition and whether the Claimant has complied with it.\n\nThe Respondent has stated that it intends to adduce substantive jurisdictional objections in the event that this Inter-State Negotiation Objection were not to succeed.\n\n**C. What Must be Done to Satisfy the Inter-State Negotiation Precondition?**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n100.\n\nThe Tribunal makes two preliminary observations in considering this issue: (i) Article 9 of the BIT lacks clear guidance on what compliance with the negotiation precondition would entail; and (ii) the Claimant correctly points to *Capital Financial Holdings*, CLA-90, as providing useful guidance on the limited obligations of an investor to satisfy an analogous precondition (CJ-slides 6-10; Cl. Submission, paras. 128-133, 141).\n\n101.\n\nAs discussed above, the Tribunal finds that Article 9 contains an inter-State negotiation precondition to arbitration. However, the manner in which that precondition is to be achieved is left unclear in Article 9. That is, Article 9 contains no standard, much less any guidance, on *how* the investor may comply with the precondition. There is nothing more than the Article 9(1) provision that the investor-State dispute \"will be subject to\" inter-State negotiation, and the Article 9(2) provision that if the dispute \"cannot be settled in such a manner within 6 months from the day on which a written claim was submitted,\" the investor may refer the dispute to arbitration. The words \"in such a manner\" clearly refer to inter-State negotiation, but the words \"cannot be settled\" leave the door quite open to various possibilities that entail unsuccessful negotiation. In these circumstances, what must the investor do, and/or what must one or both Contracting Parties do? Article 9 is silent.\n\n102.\n\nArticle 9\u2019s silence suggests minimal requirements to satisfy the inter-State negotiation precondition, both for the investor and the Contracting Parties. If the Contracting Parties had intended to impose specific obligations, they could readily have done so. Interpretation under Article 31 of the VCLT is textually based, and the interpretive task is to give meaning (in context, in light of the BIT\u2019s object and purpose, and in good faith) to the Article 9 provisions without imposing obligations that the drafters could have included but did not do so.\n\n103.\n\nIn this context, the only requirement that Article 9 arguably imposes on the investor is a notification obligation: informing one or both Contracting Parties of the investor\u2019s dispute with the host State such that it may be possible for inter-State negotiation to occur, and the submission of a written claim to the host State -though the timing of these notifications need not be the same.61 The Claimant correctly observes that Article 9 cannot fairly be read to impose an obligation on the investor somehow to initiate inter-State negotiation. Nor can it be read to oblige the investor to deliver a request to the Contracting Parties that they engage in negotiation. The words \"will be subject to negotiation\" do not entail such a request, and Article 9(2) does not provide any elaboration. Further, Article 9 cannot fairly be read to require that inter-State negotiation actually occur or even that a Contracting Party must attempt to initiate negotiation with the other Contracting Party. The words \"cannot be settled in such a manner\" require nothing more than the possibility for inter-State negotiation to occur must be created; if the negotiation fails for any reason - including that it never took place because a Contracting Party was uninterested in negotiating - the precondition is still satisfied.\n\nUpon questioning by Arbitrator Rowley, the Respondent argued, Tr., p. 165, that the investor must submit a communication to both Contracting Parties, requesting that they engage in negotiations, at the same time that the investor submits a written claim. However, the Tribunal considers that the Respondent\u2019s argument is not supported by the text of Article 9, and the Tribunal rejects this argument.\n\n104.\n\nIn short, the text of Article 9 contains an inter-State negotiation precondition, but no compliance action is required of the Contracting Parties. The only compliance action that can reasonably be required of the investor is to inform the Contracting Parties (or possibly only one Contracting Party, if it then informs the other) of the existence of a dispute, such that six months are given for potential inter-State negotiation to be successful. This is, indeed, a precondition without much bite, but that is all that the text of the BIT reasonably requires.\n\n105.\n\nDuring the November 23, 2021 Hearing, Arbitrator Alexandrov put this point to the Respondent: (Tr., p. 163): \"Applying the rules of treaty interpretation of the Vienna Convention, is there an argument that all we need to decide is whether the dispute could be settled in the manner provided for in paragraph 1; and if it couldn\u2019t, within six months, then the investor is entitled to submit the dispute to arbitration?\" Dr. Alexandrov also observed that the text of Article 9 does not \"specify any particular result other than the dispute could not be settled through negotiations between Georgia and Azerbaijan; and it doesn\u2019t seem controversial here that the dispute could not be settled in such a manner, meaning through negotiations between the Contracting Parties.\" Arbitrator Rowley further queried (Tr., p. 165) whether the submission of a claim in writing would make much of a difference if a dispute was made known to the host State. The Respondent agreed with this proposition, but added that the investor did not send a letter to either Contracting Party referring specifically to Article 9(1) and asking both States to undertake inter-State negotiation. Again, however, the text of Article 9 imposes no such letter requirement on the investor, and the Respondent was not able to contest effectively the interpretation of the inter-State negotiation precondition posed by Dr. Alexandrov.\n\n106.\n\nThe interpretation of the precondition described above finds support in the *Capital Financial Holdings* award. There, the tribunal found, in arguably analogous circumstances, that the investor had no obligation \"to initiate conciliation through diplomatic channels.\" The tribunal pointed out that the investor had no capacity to force the State to carry out such a procedure; the investor \"took all the necessary measures that could reasonably be expected from it, in order to inform the authorities of both Contracting Parties to the Treaty about the existence and the evolution of the dispute.\" Absent a specific provision in the Treaty, the investor was not required to go any further. It was up to the States to initiate conciliation, if they so wished, using the usual means of communication between States (paras. 159, 166). These conclusions in *Capital Financial Holdings* are relevant to the present case. The Claimant\u2019s obligation in this arbitration was to inform the Contracting Parties of the dispute, so that inter-Sate negotiation could take place -if the Contracting Parties so wished - for six months before the commencement of the arbitration.\n\n**D. Compliance with the Inter-State Negotiation Precondition**\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\n107.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that a review of the Request with certain exhibits filed by the Claimant - specifically, C-43, C-25, and C-26 - is sufficient to establish the Claimant\u2019s compliance with the inter-State negotiation precondition, on the basis of the Article 9 requirements, discussed above.\n\n108.\n\nC-43 is the April 1, 2021 letter provided by the Azerbaijani Ministry of Foreign Affairs to the Claimant, at the Claimant\u2019s request, in which the Ministry provides a brief history of the CO-Georgia dispute. Importantly, the Ministry states that the \"representative of Azerbaijani investor, Neqsol Holding, has informed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Azerbaijan about the referred dispute in January 2020 and the Ministry has communicated the matter to Georgian side. However, Georgian side did not respond to the queries of the Ministry.\" The Respondent has not denied receipt of the communication, which denial might at least cast doubt on the information provided by the Ministry. Moreover, the Tribunal has been given no reason to discount this information, which indicates that the Claimant, as early as January 2020 (the arbitration was commenced on October 19, 2020), informed its home State of its dispute with the host State (arguably a dispute under the BIT, even if Article 9 is not specifically referenced), and Azerbaijan sought to engage Georgia in negotiation (at an unstated subsequent time).\n\n109.\n\nIn addition to this important foundational and undisputed fact, the Claimant reported in C-25, the DLA Piper letter dated May 22, 2020, that previous meetings had taken place \"between the Georgian Prime Minister\u2019s office and our client\u2019s representatives in Tbilisi, where government representatives have committed to procure an amicable solution, ...\" The \"amicable solution\" was sought in relation to a dispute and possible claim under the BIT. The Respondent has not denied the timing of the meetings (see below; the timing reference appears to be to March 2020) or that it was informed of a dispute and possible filing of a claim under the BIT. The point here is not that investor-State negotiations took place, such negotiations are not called for under Article 9. Instead, the point is that Georgia was notified of a BIT dispute - in addition, apparently, to having received the above-mentioned queries from the Azerbaijani Foreign Ministry - more than six months before the filing of the Request.\n\n110.\n\nIn the Request (paras. 27, 39-43), and reiterated in Cl. Submission, para. 110.1, the Claimant states that from \"March to September 2020, the Claimant sought to resolve the dispute, through attending meetings with the Respondent, and issuing to the Respondent written invitations to participate in amicable negotiations.\" Again, on this basis, Georgia had the opportunity, pursuant to Article 9,62 to seek to engage in inter-State negotiation, if it so wished. By issuing a written invitation to discuss a dispute involving the investor\u2019s investment in the territory of Georgia, and having previously (in January 2020) informed the Azerbaijani Government of this dispute, the Claimant was in compliance with the precondition when it commenced this ICSID arbitration in October 2020.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that Article 9(2) does not specify the form or content of the \"written claim\" to be submitted. There is no requirement that Article 9 be mentioned in such a claim. The only information that must be conveyed is the existence of dispute \"in connection with the investor\u2019s investment in the territory of the latter Contracting Party\" *(i.e.,* the host State).\n\n111.\n\nC-26, the DLA Piper/Quinn Emanuel letter dated June 22, 2020, is stated to be the Claimant\u2019s \"written claim within the meaning of Article 9.2\" of the BIT. However, as noted above, the Claimant had already informed the Contracting Parties of the existence of a dispute in connection with the Claimant\u2019s (purported) investment in the territory of Georgia, and one Contracting Party had even attempted to engage the other in negotiations. In these circumstances, the \"formal\" Article 9.2 written claim did not itself constitute fulfilment of the investor\u2019s Article 9 precondition obligations in any respect. Rather, information in the June 22 letter demonstrated partial fulfilment of the obligations, by referencing, with further details, the notification to Georgia in, apparently, February (or March) 2020 of a dispute involving CO (the purported investment in Georgia) (para. 14): \"In view of these adverse and unlawful decisions of the GNCC,63 the Investor\u2019s representatives entered into discussions with the Georgian government and the GNCC to seek to resolve the matter. Meetings took place in Tbilisi between (a) the Prime Minister, Mr Giorgi Gakharia, Mr Yusif Jabbarov (the CEO of Neqsol), the Seller and Mr Shmagi Kobakhidze (a former shareholder in Nelgado); and (b) the Chairman of the GNCC, Mr Kakhi Bekauri, Mr Jabbarov, Mr Ermin Karimov (Neqsol\u2019s Chief Legal Officer) and the Seller.\"\n\nThe letter references a February 6, 2020 GNCC decision in the preceding paragraph, and a February 14, 2020 CO notice in paragraph 16.\n\n112.\n\nC-26 incorrectly states (para. 51) that the BIT provides in Article 9 \"that an investor must first attempt to resolve any dispute through amicable discussions, before it refers the matter to arbitration.\" Apparently inadvertently (as the Claimant acknowledged during the November 23, 2021 Hearing, in the event the Tribunal were to find an inter-State negotiation precondition), the Claimant had months earlier64 taken the steps it needed to take to comply with the precondition - it had informed both Contracting Parties of the existence of a dispute in connection with CO, its purported investment in Georgia, such that the Contracting Parties were in a position to engage in negotiation, if they so wished.\n\nIn addition to the misreading of the negotiation requirement in Article 9 (inter-State, not investor-State), the Claimant\u2019s proffered \"written claim\" was not submitted six months prior to his commencement of this arbitration - nor was the Claimant\u2019s May 22, 2020 Letter (C-25). Neither Party discussed this in written or oral submissions.\n\n113.\n\nThe Tribunal therefore finds that the Claimant has complied with the Article 9 precondition to arbitration, and the Respondent\u2019s Inter-State Negotiation Objection is dismissed.\n\n114.\n\nBased on this finding, the Tribunal need not reach the MFN, futility or good faith arguments that the Claimant has submitted.\n\n**V. DECISION**\n---------------\n\n115.\n\nFor the reasons set forth above, the Tribunal decides as follows:\n\n(1) The Respondent\u2019s Inter-State Negotiation Objection is **dismissed**.\n\n(2) On the question of costs, the Tribunal previously informed the Parties (November 26, 2021; see above, para. 38) that, consistent with the Parties\u2019 suggestion (May 3, 2021) and para. 22.2 of Procedural Order No. 1, the Tribunal will confer with the Parties regarding the date for costs submissions (limited to two pages of argument together with a summary of cots incurred)."}, {"Title": "Decision on Claimant's Application for Provisional Measures", "Type": "Interim & Provisional Measures", "Date": "2022-06-14T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Decision on Claimant's Application for Provisional Measures\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n**I. PROCEDURAL HISTORY**\n-------------------------\n\n1.\n\nThe Arbitral Tribunal (\"**Tribunal**\") refers the Parties to the Tribunal\u2019s \"Decision on Respondent\u2019s Inter-State Negotiation Objection\" (April 19, 2022) and, in particular, to the identification of Party Representatives, Table of Selected Defined Terms, and paragraphs 1-40, which are incorporated as if fully set forth herein.\n\n2.\n\nThe Request for Arbitration, dated October 19, 2020 (\"**Request**\"), contained a \"request for urgent provisional measures\" at paragraphs 110-124 (\"**Application**\").\n\n3.\n\nThe developments related to the Application through April 15, 2021 - including the Parties\u2019 pleadings and correspondence related to the Application - are summarized in the Tribunal\u2019s Procedural Order No. 3, dated April 15, 2021 (\"**PO3**\").\n\n4.\n\nPO3 addressed the pending Application and, in response to the Claimant\u2019s request that a hearing on provisional measures be held as early as possible, noted that it was not feasible for the Tribunal to hold such a hearing prior to the one already scheduled for May 12, 2021. PO3 confirmed that oral submissions on both the provisional measures application and the bifurcated jurisdictional objection would be heard during the hearing (by video conference) on May 12, 2021.\n\n5.\n\nPO3 further provided the following directions pending the Tribunal\u2019s decision on the Application:\n\n*19. In the period from this date until the Tribunal issues its final decision on the Application, the Tribunal issues the directions in paragraph 20, below, to the parties on the basis of the parties' submissions to date, with a view to preventing the aggravation of the parties' dispute, and* ***without forming any judgment whatsoever on the merits of the Application and the jurisdiction of this Tribunal****.*\n\n*20. The Tribunal directs that the Respondent refrain from taking any of the steps listed in para. 143.1-.3 of the Claimant's submissions of January 12, 2021, including, in particular:*\n\n*a) an undertaking that the GNCC will not suspend CO's authorization to operate; and*\n\n*b) an undertaking to allow that the governing bodies of CO exercise, without the Special Manager's further approval, the list of activities requested by Mr. Teymur Taghiyev in his letter of January 11, 2021.*\n\n*Each party is at liberty to apply for modification of these directions upon a showing of good cause.*1\n\nEmphasis in original.\n\n6.\n\nSubsequently, on May 11, 2021, the Parties informed the Tribunal that they had reached a mutual agreement to postpone the May 12, 2021, hearing to provide an opportunity for the Parties to pursue settlement discussions, while reserving the \"right of either Party to request that the hearing be rescheduled in the event they consider circumstances so require.\" The Claimant confirmed by email of June 25, 2021, that the Parties were engaged in ongoing discussions and had agreed to the suspension of the procedural calendar.\n\n7.\n\nOn June 29, 2021, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 4 (\"**PO4**\"), confirming the Tribunal\u2019s approval of the suspension of the procedural calendar. The Parties were invited to provide an update concerning the status of their negotiations by September 1, 2021.\n\n8.\n\nOn July 26, 2021, the Claimant requested that the hearing on the bifurcated objection and provisional measures request be rescheduled. The hearing was subsequently rescheduled for November 23, 2021.\n\n9.\n\nOn November 5, 2021, in response to the Tribunal\u2019s invitation to the Parties dated November 1, 2021, the Parties filed their respective comments on the Tribunal\u2019s proposed Hearing timetable as well as their positions on further filings concerning the Application. The Tribunal issued directions on these matters dated November 8, 2021.\n\n10.\n\nOn November 11, 2021, the Claimant filed an \"Update to its Request for Provisional Measures.\"\n\n11.\n\nOn November 18, 2021, the Respondent filed its observations on the Claimant\u2019s submission of November 11, 2021.\n\n12.\n\nOn November 19, 2021, the Respondent filed an application seeking an order that certain documentary exhibits be treated as confidential. The Claimant responded to the application on November 22, 2021, and the Tribunal\u2019s decision on the application was issued later that day, November 22, 2021.\n\n13.\n\nOn November 23, 2021, the Tribunal held a hearing on provisional measures and the bifurcated jurisdictional objection by video conference (\"**Hearing**\").2\n\nAll transcript references (\"**Tr., p** ...\") are to the transcript of the November 23, 2021, Hearing, as corrected further to the agreement of the parties.\n\n14.\n\nAt the conclusion of the Hearing (Tr., p. 177), the Tribunal informed the Parties that until it issues its decision on the Application, \"PO3, with its provisions, remains in effect.\" By letter dated November 24, 2021, the Secretary of the Tribunal informed the Parties that \"the Tribunal has asked me to reiterate for the avoidance of doubt that, pending the Tribunal\u2019s further decision on the request for provisional measures, paragraph 19 of the Tribunal\u2019s Procedural Order 3 remains in effect.\"\n\n**II. THE PARTIES' POSITIONS**\n------------------------------\n\n15.\n\nThe Tribunal summarizes, in this section, the Parties\u2019 respective positions on the Application. While the Tribunal has carefully considered all written and oral submissions, documentary evidence, and legal authorities presented by both Parties, this summary is intended as a general description. In the following section, \"Analysis and Decision,\" the Tribunal addresses the specific points that the Parties have adduced in making their respective cases on each element of the provisional measures standard.\n\n**A. The Claimant's Position**\n------------------------------\n\n16.\n\nIn his Request, the Claimant asks the Tribunal to order the following provisional measures (the \"**Requested Measures**\"):3\n\na. Staying the making or execution of administrative decisions by the Georgian National Communications Commission (\"**GNCC**\") including the suspension of Caucasus Online LLC\u2019s (\"**CO**\") authorization to operate;\n\nb. Restricting the taking of adverse steps against CO by the \"Special Manager\" (at that time, Ms. Mariam Sulaberidze), appointed by GNCC;\n\nc. Preventing prejudicial interference by the Government, the GNCC or the Special Manager in CO\u2019s business and management; and\n\nd. Directing the Government to forebear taking steps to escalate the present dispute until the arbitration\u2019s conclusion.\n\nRequest, paras. 115, 123.\n\n17.\n\nThe Claimant subsequently reformulated the Requested Measures in his \"Response in Support of his Request for Provisional Measures,\" dated 12 January 2021 (\"**Cl. Response**\"):4\n\n*143.1 Staying the making or execution of any administrative decisions by the GNCC in respect of CO, including (specifically but non-exclusively) decisions that: (i) would have the effect of suspending or would lead to the suspension of CO\u2019s authorisation to operate; (ii) impose further sanctions against CO for its alleged breaches (in dispute in these proceedings) of the Communication Law, the 2016 GNCC Decision and/or the 2019 GNCC Decision; and/or (iii) are designed to procure and/or may directly or indirectly lead to the forced reversal of the Transaction;*\n\n*143.2 Proscribing the Special Manager from exercising any of the powers conferred on her in respect of CO by the 1 October 2020 Decision, including (specifically but non-exclusively) by taking any measures (by action or inaction) that: (i) are adverse to CO; (ii) interfere in or obstruct the day-to-day management and business activities of CO; and/or (iii) are designed to procure and/or may directly or indirectly lead to the forced reversal of the Transaction; and*\n\n*143.3 Ordering that the Special Manager approve the request made by Mr Teymur Taghiyev, a director of Nelgado Limited, in his letter dated 11 January 2021,*5 *that CO\u2019s governing bodies (its director, supervisory board and shareholders) be empowered to carry out the managerial activities listed in that letter*.\n\nCl. Response, paras. 89; 143.\n\nExhibit C-41 (footnote reference is in the original).\n\n18.\n\nThe Claimant submits that in July 2020, Georgia passed Amendments to the Communications Law with the purpose of specifically targeting CO and enabling GNCC to take over control of the company through the appointment of a Special Manager, which occurred on October 1, 2021. The Respondent\u2019s plan was that the Special Manager would then use her \"unlawful and excessive powers\" to take \"adverse steps in relation to the business of CO in order to coerce the Claimant into returning\" his shares and thereby reversing the Transaction: the \"very existence of that constant threat is in and of itself a significant impairment of Claimant\u2019s investment and may drive it into bankruptcy.\"6 Under the Communications Law, the Respondent could have undertaken a competition assessment of the Transaction,7 but it instead decided to pursue the most intrusive option by appointing such a Special Manager, who was and is not independent from the GNCC.8 The Special Manager\u2019s partiality was demonstrated soon after the Request was filed, by, for example, her making CO\u2019s commercially sensitive information available to the Georgian Government and/or the GNCC, and her obstruction of CO\u2019s business operations.9\n\nRequest, para. 37; Cl. Response, para. 6-7. The \"**Transaction**\" is the Claimant\u2019s acquisition of his investment in CO in January 2019.\n\nSee Tr., p. 74.\n\nCl. Response, paras. 31, 34.\n\nCl. Response, paras. 40-50. The Claimant states (Request, paras. 111-112) that pursuant to the GNCC\u2019s decision by which she was appointed, the Special Manager has the remit to ensure the restoration of CO\u2019s shareholding that existed before the Transaction. However, CO has no power to effect the transfer of shares in its parent company. Thus, the Special Manager has been appointed \"for a stated purpose that she cannot legitimately achieve.\" The GNCC has granted her powers that go beyond \"her purported authority to effect the reversal of the Transaction\": *e.g.,* restricting distributions to shareholders; invalidating previous management decisions; requiring her own involvement in certain management decisions; and engaging third parties to perform due diligence on CO.\n\n19.\n\nAbove all, according to the Claimant, the Respondent has threatened to suspend CO\u2019s license to operate, which would \"entirely destroy CO as a going concern.\"10\n\nRequest, para. 114.\n\n20.\n\nThe Tribunal may recommend provisional measures pursuant to Article 47 of the ICSID Convention, and Rule 39(1) and (5) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules. Provisional measures may be recommended in circumstances where: (i) the Tribunal has *prima facie* jurisdiction; (ii) the measures are intended to preserve the rights the protection of which has been sought; (iii) the measures are urgent; and (iv) they are necessary to preserve the *status quo* or avoid irreparable harm.11 The Claimant also contends that in this case the Requested measures are narrow and specific and would not impermissibly improve the Claimant\u2019s situation.12\n\nRequest, paras. 117-118.\n\nCl. Response, para. 53.\n\n21.\n\nThe Claimant argues that the facts set out in his Request and Cl. Response are sufficient to establish *prima facie* jurisdiction.13 The Claimant relies on *Pey Casado v. Chile* for the proposition that what must be demonstrated of the purposes of provisional measures is \"the prima facie existence of jurisdiction, or, to couch this in negative terms, the absence of a clear lack of jurisdiction.\"14 The threshold for a showing *prima facie* jurisdiction is, therefore, \"extremely low,\" and the Claimant has met it.15\n\nCl. Response, para. 60.\n\nCl. Response, para. 61; CLA-10.\n\nTr., p. 10.\n\n22.\n\nThe Claimant is an Azerbaijani national and the ultimate beneficial owner of CO. He therefore satisfies the \"investor\" and nationality requirements of the BIT and the ICSID Convention. He also holds a qualifying investment under the BIT and his legal dispute with Georgia arises out of that investment, satisfying Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention. The Parties have consented to ICSID arbitration pursuant to Article 9 of the BIT.16 In light of the context, purpose and object of the BIT, Article 9(1) must be interpreted as requiring prior negotiations between the Claimant and Respondent - and not between the Governments of Azerbaijan and Georgia.17\n\nCl. Response, para. 62 ff.\n\nCl. Response, para. 64 ff.\n\n23.\n\nRegarding the Respondent\u2019s argument that Art 9(1) of the Treaty requires prior negotiations between Georgia and Azerbaijan (\"**Inter-State Negotiation Objection**\"), the Claimant argues that the BIT must be interpreted as requiring prior negotiations between the investor and Georgia, which has been satisfied.18 A detailed summary of the Claimant\u2019s arguments regarding the Inter-State Negotiation Objection is set out in the Tribunal\u2019s April 19, 2022 Decision.19\n\nCl. Response, paras. 64 ff.\n\nDecision on Respondent\u2019s Inter-State Negotiation Objection, April 19, 2022 (paras. 61-83)\n\n24.\n\nAs for the Respondent\u2019s argument concerning an alleged \"fork-in-the-road\" provision under Article 9(2) of the BIT, the mere existence of dispute settlement options does not automatically create a fork-in-the-road, which is confirmed by the authorities that the Claimant has submitted.20 Even if the Tribunal were to find that the BIT contains a fork-in-the-road provision, it would not apply to the present case, because the Claimant has not submitted his BIT dispute to any other tribunal or court.21\n\nTr., p. 10; CLA-95.\n\nTr., p. 12.\n\n25.\n\nPursuant to the applicable legal test, the Claimant must show that the Requested Measures are urgently needed, which means that they cannot wait the outcome of an award on the merits, and there is a sufficient or probable risk that serious or grave harm will occur if the Requested Measures are not granted.22 The bar is not as high as Respondent portrays it, and the wording 'irreparable\u2019 used by several investment treaty tribunals does not mean that the harm cannot be otherwise repaired.23\n\nCl. Response, para. 119; CLA-24.\n\nTr., pp. 12-13.\n\n26.\n\nThe Claimant states that he has shown that if the Requested Measures are not urgently granted, his investment will suffer irreparable harm and serious prejudice. During the Hearing the Claimant observed that:\n\n*for so long as the Special Manager is in place and for so long as there is the threat that the authorization to carry out business may be revoked, you will, I think, plainly appreciate that third parties are extremely reluctant to do business with Caucasus Online. The company needs to renew very substantial contracts with its major customers, and in the present circumstances of uncertainty, it cannot do so... . For so long as the Special Manager is in place, is controlling the operations of the company and there is the threat of license revocation, the company cannot secure the contracts that it needs to generate cash flow and to meet its debt obligations.*\n\nThe threat of license revocation and the Special Manager's interference with the CO's business are two distinct grounds for the Requested Measures and both are \"properly necessary and appropriate for the grant of provisional relief.\"24\n\nTr., pp. 37-41.\n\n27.\n\nThe Respondent's challenge to the Claimant's reliance on cases that involve claims for specific performance has no merit. The test that the harm should be serious and substantial applies independently of whether specific performance is sought.25 In any event, the Claimant's Application seeks the equivalent of specific performance.26\n\nTr., p. 13.\n\nTr., p. 14.\n\n28.\n\nMoreover, when a claimant seeks interim relief from a tribunal to prevent the non-aggravation of the dispute, as in this case, the measures requested are always urgent.27\n\nCl. Response, para. 92.\n\n29.\n\nThe Special Manager is blocking the day-to-day activities of CO, which is therefore unable to carry out its business plan, in plain violation of PO3.28 By way of example, the Special Manager issued a power of attorney to CO's director (Mr. Revaz Kopaladze), authorizing him to undertake a restricted set of activities. For actions not listed in the power of attorney, the prior written consent of the Special Manager is required. This means that CO's director is subject to the constant supervision and effective right of veto of the Special Manager.29 Further, the Special Manager has continued to deny CO its fundamental right to represent itself in legal proceedings.30\n\nAs noted above, the Tribunal issued PO3 on April 15, 2021, which directed the Respondent to undertake that (i) the GNCC will not suspend CO\u2019s authorization to operate; and (ii) to allow the governing bodies of CO to exercise a set of certain activities, without the Special Manager\u2019s further approval. Tr., pp. 17-19; C-54.\n\nCl. Update, paras. 13 ff.\n\nCl. Update, paras. 24 ff.\n\n30.\n\nThe Venice Commission and the Director General on Rule of Law, both from the Council of Europe, have highlighted the harm that the Special Manager can cause. In March 2021, the Venice Commission considered the Special Manager\u2019s powers in view of the remit to reverse the Transaction and concluded that \"it was neither legitimate nor was it proportional to put in place a special manager, and [it] violated the right to property under Article 1, protocol 1, of the ECHR.31\n\nTr., pp. 23-24; C-44.\n\n31.\n\nThe Requested Measures are therefore urgent and cannot wait the final award on the merits.32 Such urgency, as noted above, is not undermined by the fact that the Claimant seeks monetary compensation: the possibility of monetary compensation on the merits \"does not eliminate the need for provisional measures.\"33\n\nCl. Response, paras. 91 ff.\n\nCl. Response, paras. 98 ff.\n\n32.\n\nThe Requested Measures are also necessary to preserve the *status quo* and prevent the dispute from being aggravated.34 The preservation of the *status quo* is a self-standing procedural right also recognized by the ICSID Rules and several investment treaty tribunals.35\n\nCl. Response, paras. 131 ff.\n\nTr., p. 24; CLA-45; RL-13.\n\n33.\n\nThe Claimant has the right to preserve his substantive rights and, in particular, his right to indirect ownership and control of CO, which have been prejudiced by the GNCC and the Special Manager.36 In fact, while the Special Manager was appointed with the sole purpose of reversing the Transaction by which the Claimant acquired his ownership in CO,37 she is now improperly managing CO and exercising powers that are interfering with the business of the company.38\n\nTr., p. 25.\n\nC-34.\n\nTr., p. 29.\n\n34.\n\nThe Respondent is incorrect in asserting that if the Requested Measures are granted, the Claimant\u2019s position would be impermissibly improved. The Claimant is seeking preservation of the *status quo* of the dispute and not a ruling from the Tribunal on the legality of the Transaction and his investment.39\n\nTr., p. 26.\n\n35.\n\nContrary to the Respondent\u2019s assertion, the Claimant is not required to show that if the Requested Measures are denied the resolution of the dispute would be rendered more difficult. The Respondent relies on one case to support this assertion. However, most tribunals have found that, generally, provisional measures are justified when they prevent the dispute from being aggravated.40\n\nTr., pp. 32-33.\n\n36.\n\nThe Requested Measures are narrow and specific. In citing cases in which tribunals rejected certain provisional measures because they were too broad, the Respondent failed to identify the principle behind such rejections. An application for provisional measures is rejected if neither the respondent nor the tribunal can determine with precision the scope of the measures. In the present case, however, the Claimant has described with precision the actions that the Respondent would be prohibited from taking.41\n\nSee also Claimant\u2019s Requested Measures as reformulated, Cl. Response, para. 143.\n\n37.\n\nFinally, during the Hearing, the Claimant explained that the Tbilisi Court of Appeals suspended the imposition of the Special Manager on the grounds that the Special Manager was likely to cause irreparable harm to CO. The Respondent refused to accept the non-appealable decision of its own Court and brought a revision procedure based on alleged newly discovered evidence. But there was no such evidence. The State and the GNCC manipulated their judiciary and obtained a reversal of the Court of Appeals\u2019 judgment.\n\n38.\n\nThe Claimant seeks the costs of the arbitral proceedings (but has not expressed requested the costs of the Application).\n\n**B. The Respondent's Position**\n--------------------------------\n\n39.\n\nThe Respondent contends that the Claimant is seeking the Requested Measures to take control over CO in plain violation of Georgian law and the regulator\u2019s orders, especially when the so-called investment was not made in accordance with Georgian law.42 If the Tribunal were to award the Requested Measures, the Claimant would be granted rights - such as control over strategic infrastructure in Georgia - that he does not have, even if the Claimant were ultimately to prevail on the merits of this arbitration.43\n\nRespondent\u2019s Observations on Claimant\u2019s Request for Provisional Measures dated December 21, 2020 (\"**Resp. Observations**\"), para. 8; Tr., p. 42.\n\nTr., p. 47.\n\n40.\n\nThe Requested Measures should not be granted because the Claimant has failed: (i) to establish a *prima facie* case on jurisdiction; (ii) to overcome the high bar of showing that the Requested Measures are urgently needed to avoid irreparable harm; (iii) to demonstrate that the Requested Measures are necessary to preserve the *status quo* and prevent the dispute from being aggravated; and (iv) to show that the Requested Measures are narrow and specific.\n\n41.\n\nThe provisional measures that the Claimant seeks are extraordinary measures and require exceptional circumstances. Not only has the Claimant failed to demonstrate that exceptional circumstances exist, but he has also failed to establish a *prima facie* case on jurisdiction.\n\n42.\n\nPursuant to Article 9(1) of the BIT, the Governments of Azerbaijan and Georgia should have engaged in negotiations before the Claimant resorted to ICSID arbitration. Since there were no negotiations between Georgia and the Republic of Azerbaijan before the commencement of the arbitration, the Claimant has not established *prima facie* jurisdiction.44\n\nA detailed summary of the Respondent\u2019s arguments in this regard is included in the Decision on the Inter-State Negotiation Objection (paras. 41-60).\n\n43.\n\nFurther, contrary to the Claimant's position, the Claimant's briefs are not sufficient to establish a *prima facie* case for the Requested Measures. The BIT only protects assets invested in accordance with the laws of Georgia, and the Claimant's purported investment was made in violation of Georgian law. The Respondent has never accepted and does not accept that the Claimant is the ultimate beneficial owner of CO. Thus, at \"a minimum, the fact that Respondent has reserved its right to raise serious jurisdictional objections needs to be taken into account by the Tribunal\" in deciding whether or not the alleged urgency requires the Tribunal to defer consideration of the provisional measures until after the question of jurisdiction has been decided.45\n\nResp. Reply, para. 104 ff; RL-7.\n\n44.\n\nMoreover, the fork-in-the-road provision in Article 9(2) of the BIT bars the Claimant from seeking the Requested Measures because the Claimant submitted a request for suspending the execution of the GNCC decision to the Georgian Courts. The 2019 GNCC Decision, which the Claimant previously submitted to the Georgian Courts, forms a fundamental basis of the Claimant's treaty claims.46 The Claimant should be precluded from making duplicative requests for relief.\n\nResp. Reply, para. 98 ff.\n\n45.\n\nThe Requested Measures are wholly disproportionate, and the Claimant has not met his burden of showing that the Requested Measures are urgent and necessary to prevent irreparable harm.47 The Claimant should have demonstrated that the harm he is allegedly likely to incur if the Requested Measures are not granted cannot be compensated by monetary damages. Numerous authorities - including those relied upon by the Claimant - have confirmed that provisional measures can only be granted if there is harm that cannot be repaired by an award of damages.48 Several treaty tribunals have rejected provisional measures requests by investors whose local companies were placed under state administration; these requests, like the Claimant\u2019s, \"did not satisfy the necessity requirement because any harm that the Claimant may suffer could be remedied by damages.\"49\n\nTr., p. 56.\n\nSee, *e.g.,* RL-3; RL-5; RL-6; RL-13; RL-14; RL-42; RL-43; RL-44; RL-45; RL-46; CLA-9; CLA-39.\n\nResp. Reply, para. 142 ff; Tr., p. 56.\n\n46.\n\nAt present, there is no risk that the GNCC will suspend CO\u2019s license to operate within the Georgian telecommunications market, as alleged by the Claimant, because such a suspension would negatively affect the Georgian internet and telecommunications market (\"including substantial harm to more than 2.5 million internet subscribers and more than 300 public agencies whose internet supply depends on CO, to stability and cost of internet services, and to internet transit to Armenia\"). The Respondent notes that as \"recorded in the GNCC\u2019s Decision on the Appointment of the Special Manager, the GNCC appointed a Special Manager for CO precisely to avoid this harm by allowing CO to continue to operate in compliance with Georgian law.\"50\n\nResp. Observations, para. 76 ff; C-34; R-1; Respondent\u2019s Response to Claimant\u2019s Update to its Request for Provisional Measures dated 18 November 2021 (\"**Resp. Response**\"), para. 4 ff.\n\n47.\n\nAs for the request to proscribe the Special Manager from exercising her powers, the Respondent comments that the Claimant has not only failed to prove the urgency of such a measure, but he has also failed to show that the Special Manager has exercised her powers improperly and with the sole purpose of damaging CO and obstructing CO\u2019s day-to-day business.51\n\nResp. Reply, para. 160 ff; Resp. Response, para. 11 ff.\n\n48.\n\nThe Special Manager granted CO\u2019s management residual freedom in the conduct of the company\u2019s day-to-day business operations by issuing a power of attorney to CO\u2019s director. Although the Special Manager\u2019s approval is required for certain payments and transactions not included in the power of attorney, the Claimant has failed to show how this would harm CO or pose a threat to CO as a going concern. The Claimant cannot show that the few instances in which the Special Manager has withheld approvals have created any threat to CO\u2019s continued existence.52 Further, the Special Manager has continued to facilitate CO\u2019s operations by approving the conclusion by CO of numerous contracts for the provision of services, the expansion and improvement of CO\u2019s infrastructure, and the increase of its transit capacity.53\n\nTr. pp. 67-69; C-47.\n\nResp. Response, para. 11.\n\n49.\n\nThe Claimant has not presented sufficient evidence to substantiate his allegations that the Special Manager would act in a partial manner and cause serious harm to CO. The Special Manager was appointed in accordance with the relevant regulations and because of the Claimant\u2019s refusal to comply with Georgian law.54 It is simply irrelevant that the Special Manager is a former employee of the GNCC and once applied to become a GNCC Board member.55\n\nResp. Reply, para. 37 ff.\n\nResp. Reply, para. 47.\n\n50.\n\nThe mere fact that the Special Manager may exercise all or some of the powers granted to her - which were specifically designed to prevent the Claimant from continuing to violate the Georgian law - does not justify the issuance of the Requested Measures.56 Further, since her appointment the Special Manager has always acted in the best interests of CO and has exercised her powers properly.57 Accordingly, the Claimant\u2019s allegations are nothing more than speculative.58\n\nResp. Reply, para. 44.\n\nTr., p. 69.\n\nResp. Observations, para. 78 ff.\n\n51.\n\nAs for the Claimant\u2019s request that CO be provided with powers that can be exercised without the Special Manager\u2019s approval, this is an attempt to circumvent and interfere with the Special Manager's powers. If this request were granted, the Claimant would have the opportunity to take unlawful measures, in blatant violation of Georgian law.59\n\nResp. Reply, para. 176 ff.\n\n52.\n\nFor more than two years the Claimant has applied to Georgian courts requesting interim relief, and the Georgian Courts have repeatedly found that a stay of the 2019 GNCC decision is not warranted.60\n\nTr., p. 69.\n\n53.\n\nThe Requested Measures do not aim at preserving the *status quo.* Rather, the Requested Measures would alter the *status quo* in the Claimant's favor*,* and if the Tribunal were to award them, the Claimant's position would be impermissibly improved. The Claimant would be granted rights that he does not have under either Georgian law or the BIT. The \"status quo is that Claimant's putative investment in CO has not even been admitted.\" If the Requested Measures were granted, not only\n\n*would Claimant be treated as if the GNCC actually approved his attempted takeover, but Claimant could control CO free of any regulatory supervision or constraint. Respondent, by contrast, would be stripped of its regulatory powers over critical infrastructure to Georgia and deprived of its ability to develop into the region's primary digital hub.*61\n\nResp. Observations, para. 86 ff; Tr., p. 58.\n\n54.\n\nAs explained by an ICSID tribunal, the non-aggravation of the dispute must be related to the specific issues in the arbitration, which are defined by the Claimant's claims and requests for relief.62 Thus, in this case, the right to non-aggravation must relate to the Claimant's claim for monetary compensation. However, the Requested Measures as formulated by the Claimant do not relate to his claim, but are intended to enable the Claimant benefit from the investment he has made, even when this investment has violated Georgian law.63\n\n*Ipek Investment v. Turkey,* Procedural Order No. 5 (CLA-30).\n\nResp. Reply, para. 183 ff.\n\n55.\n\nThe right to maintain the *status quo* and the principle of non-aggravation of the dispute refer to actions that would make the resolution of the dispute more difficult. This right does not extend to any action that may aggravate the dispute, as the Claimant argues.64\n\nResp. Reply, para. 190 citing RL-5.\n\n56.\n\nFinally, the Requested Measures are not narrow and specific, as they must be.65 In his Response, the Claimant reformulated his Requested Measures. However, in doing so, the Claimant has only broadened the Requested Measures, rather than specified or narrowed them. As reformulated, the Requested Measures extend to any GNCC decision and do not specify the nature of the \"further sanctions\" that would be covered. The reformulated measures seem to consider all powers conferred on the Special Manager to be adverse to CO. The new request that CO\u2019s governing bodies be empowered to carry out managerial activities listed in Mr. Taghiyev\u2019s letter is \"a blatant attempt to have the Tribunal confer on Claimant, through the management he installed at CO, far-reaching powers that he does not have under Georgian law or the BIT, including, but not limited to, entering into and terminating any commercial agreement, appointing and dismissing CO\u2019s CEO and supervisory board members, and even introducing amendments to CO\u2019s charter, effectively allowing him to neutralize the Special Manager\u2019s powers\" (emphasis in the original).66\n\nRL-3; RL-8; RL-9; RL-10; RL-11; RL-12.\n\nResp. Reply, para. 114 ff (in particular, paras. 114-122).\n\n57.\n\nThe Respondent requests that the Claimant\u2019s Application be denied and that the Claimant be ordered to pay the full costs arising out of the Application.\n\n**III. ANALYSIS AND DECISION**\n------------------------------\n\n58.\n\nThe issue that the Application raises for resolution is twofold: (i) whether there is an ongoing threat to CO of license revocation or suspension for which the Claimant is entitled to provisional relief;67 and (ii) whether the appointment of the Special Manager pursuant to the GNCC\u2019s list of regulatory powers would cause CO to cease to exist as a viable business, therefore justifying provisional relief.68 The Claimant acknowledges that these are \"two distinct grounds\" upon which they request relief in the form of provisional measures, though he contends that \"relief which is only cast in terms of enjoining Georgia from revoking the license would not preserve the value of the [Hasanov] investment pending\" the Award. *(See* Tr., p 40.)69\n\nThis ground equates to the Claimant\u2019s \"First measure,\" as expressed in Cl. \"Hearing on Provisional Measures Slides\" (November 23, 2021) (\"**Cl. Slide(s)**\") Slide 39, and Cl. Response (January 12, 2021), para. 143.1.\n\nThis ground equates to the Claimant\u2019s \"Second measure\" and \"Third measure,\" Cl. Slide 39 and Cl. Response paras. 143.2 and 143.3.\n\nIn effect, the Claimant requests that the temporary, provisional relief issued in PO3, covering all three measures and paragraphs 143.1, 143.2, and 143.3, be adopted as provisional measures to remain in place pending the issuance of the final award in this arbitration.\n\n59.\n\nThe Tribunal addresses these two grounds separately, in the context of the standard for provisional measures in an ICSID arbitration. While the Parties broadly agree on certain elements that constitute the standard and that the Claimant must establish such elements, they differ on the stringency of the elements as well as the overall standard.\n\n60.\n\nBroadly then, under the frameworks presented by the Parties, the Tribunal may recommend provisional measures (ICSID Convention Article 47; ICSID Arbitration Rule 39) where (a) the Tribunal has *prima facie* jurisdiction over the Claimant\u2019s claim; (b) the measures would preserve the rights for which protection is sought; (c) the measures are urgent; (d) the measures are narrow and specific;70 (e) the measures would preserve the *status quo* and prevent aggravation of the dispute, without impermissibly improving the Claimant\u2019s position; and (f) the measures are necessary to avoid irreparable harm.71 The Tribunal applies each element in assessing the two grounds of requested relief, taking into account the Parties\u2019 differing understandings of the elements.\n\nAlthough the Claimant does not accept this element as part of the provisional measures standard (Tr., p. 34), it nonetheless addresses it and argues that it has satisfied it if the Tribunal were to determine that the element should be considered.\n\nThe Respondent adds - and the Claimant disagrees - that the Claimant must show that if provisional measures are denied, the resolution of the dispute will be rendered more difficult.\n\n**A. The Question of License Revocation or Suspension**\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n61.\n\nThe Claimant contends that although \"Respondent and the GNCC have been holding off on the ultimate threat of the withdrawal of the authorization to operate, that still hangs over us as a sword of Damocles and has a tremendous impact on the business\" (Tr., p. 8). The GNCC has preserved its ability \"to withdraw the authorization to operate\" (Tr., p. 8). Accordingly, the Claimant seeks an order enjoining Georgia from revoking or suspending CO's license to operate during the pendency of the arbitration. Absent such an order, third parties \"will be extremely reluctant to do business\" with CO (Tr., p. 37).72\n\nIn the provisional relief sections in his written submissions, the Claimant addressed suspension of CO\u2019s license to operate. The Claimant also discussed a request for an order enjoining revocation in his written submissions and in the Hearing, which the Respondent opposed both in its written submissions and in the Hearing. The Claimant explained, during the Hearing, *e.g.,* Tr., p. 90, that an order enjoining revocation of CO\u2019s license to operate is included in his Application. The First measure, Cl. Response, at para. 143.1, further includes a bar against GNCC actions that \"may directly or indirectly lead to the forced reversal of the Transaction.\" The Claimant\u2019s reformulation of his para. 143.1 request also refers to GNCC decisions \"including (specifically but non-exclusively) decisions that would have the effect of suspending or would lead to the suspension of CO\u2019s authorization to operate ...\". As discussed below, under ICSID Convention Article 47 and ICSID Arbitration Rule 39(3), the Tribunal is not bound by the Claimant\u2019s formulation or reformulation of his provisional relief requests.\n\n62.\n\nThe Respondent objects that there \"is nothing in the record that would suggest that there is\" an \"imminent threat to revoke CO's authorisation to operate\" (Tr., p. 95). Moreover, the GNCC \"has made a firm decision not to revoke CO's or not even to suspend CO's authorization in light of the harm very substantial harm that the revocation of CO's authorization would cause for the Georgian telecommunications market.\" The GNCC decided in 2020 that suspension \"would deprive 40% of the Georgian wholesale internal market of internet access, which would in turn deprive more than 2.5 million internet subscribers and more than 300 public agencies of internet access. In addition, internet transit to neighbouring countries would be severely compromised\" (Tr., pages 61-63).\n\n*(a) Prima Facie Jurisdiction*\n------------------------------\n\n63.\n\nThe principal jurisdictional challenge that the Claimant has had to overcome in seeking provisional measures is the Respondent's inter-State negotiation objection. As set out in the Tribunal's Decision of April 19,2022, that objection no longer poses any barrier to the Application. However, the Respondent maintains other objections to the Tribunal's jurisdiction: *see, e.g.,* Resp. Observations, para. 60, which identifies its BIT-Article 1 objection to jurisdiction,73 and Resp. Reply (February 5, 2021), paras. 98-103, which sets out its \"fork-in-the-road\" jurisdictional objection pursuant to BIT Article 9. During the Hearing,74 the Respondent argued at some length that the Claimant failed to meet the Georgia's \"admission requirements\" for an investment, as required by Article 1 the BIT. The Respondent submits, *inter alia,* that the Claimant secretly took control of CO in January 2019 and never obtained prior approval by the GNCC, as required by Georgian law.\n\nResp. Observations (December 21, 2020), para. 60: \"Respondent will raise substantial jurisdictional objections at the appropriate stage of the proceedings.\" Article 1(1) of the BIT provides for protection of investments made \"in accordance with the laws in force in\" the host State.\n\nHearing - \"Georgia\u2019s Statement on Provisional Measures Slides\" (\"**Resp. Slide(s)\"**) 2-16; Tr., pp. 41-46.\n\n64.\n\nThe Claimant disputes the \"admission requirements\" objection and the Respondent's \"fork-in-the-road\" objection.75 The Tribunal observes that these jurisdictional challenges will involve a full examination of facts and law in the merits phase of this arbitration. The Tribunal also considers the Claimant to be correct in submitting that the *prima facie* jurisdictional test does not set a high bar.76 At this stage of the proceedings then, and for the purposes of his Application, the Claimant has presented a *prima facie* basis for BIT jurisdiction on the issues of \"investor\" and \"investment\" under the BIT (Article 1(1) and Article 1(2)), as well as \"fork-in-the-road.\"77 Of primary importance, as noted above, the Claimant prevailed on the inter-State negotiation objection, which, unlike the other jurisdictional objections that the Respondent has raised, was ripe for consideration.\n\n*See, e.g.,* Cl. Response, paras. 15-26; Cl. Slides 8-9.\n\n*See, e.g.,* Cl. Response, paras. 60-62, citing CLA-9 *(Gerald International v. Sierra Leone)* and CLA-10 *(Victor Pey Casado v. Chile).*\n\nCl. Response, para. 62; Tr., pp. 10-12; Cl. Slides 8-9.\n\n65.\n\nFor these reasons, the Tribunal determines that the Claimant has satisfied the *prima facie* jurisdictional element of the provisional measures standard.78 The Tribunal emphasizes that this *prima facie* determination has no bearing on its later assessment of the Respondent\u2019s Article 1 and fork-in-the-road challenges, which the Parties are expected to address comprehensively in the merits phase.\n\nThe Claimant has therefore also satisfied this element for his second ground of requested provisional relief, relating to the appointment of the Special Manager.\n\n*(b) Preserving the Rights for Which Protection Is Sought*\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n66.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that an order enjoining Georgia from suspending or revoking CO\u2019s license during the pendency of the arbitration, or enjoining Georgia from seeking to reverse the Transaction, would entail protection of the Claimant\u2019s asserted ownership interest in CO. However, the Respondent argues that since the Claimant\u2019s underlying request for relief is a damages claim, \"any harm that the Claimant may suffer could be remedied by damages\" (Tr., p. 56.); thus, provisional measures directed to preserving an as asserted ownership right would be unjustified. Referring, in particular, to CLA-30 *(Ipek Investment v. Turkey),* CLA-39 *(Menzies v. Senegal),* and RL-3 *(Plama v. Bulgaria),* the Respondent contends that many investment treaty tribunal decisions confirm that since the Claimant\u2019s requested measures \"are neither necessary to protect any right to damages, claims he may suffer, nor to maintain the status quo,\" the measures must be rejected (Tr., pages 56-57).79 The Respondent\u2019s overarching point derives from *Plama v. Bulgaria* (RL-3: Resp. slide 31): \"the rights to be preserved by provisional measures are circumscribed by the requesting party\u2019s claims and requests for relief. They may be general rights, such as the rights to due process or the right not to have the dispute aggravated, but those general rights must be related to the specific disputes in arbitration, which, in turn, are defined by the Claimant\u2019s claims and requests for relief to date.\"\n\nCLA-30 is *Ipek Investment v. Turkey;* CLA-39 is *Menzies v. Senegal; see also* Resp. Slides 31-34.\n\n67.\n\nThe Claimant\u2019s response is twofold (Tr., pages 13-14; Cl. slides. 12-13). First, while specific performance is rarely sought in investment arbitration, provisional measures are not rare. Tribunals have \"often granted provisional measures when specific performance was not either any of the relief or the main relief, and where damages were sought as an equivalent.\" Second, in this case the Claimant \"has sought the functional equivalent of specific performance\": \"[i]n our Notice of Dispute on June 22nd 2020, C-26, we indicated that we would be seeking *restituto in integrum*. In the end, when we formulated the claim, Claimant asked for a declaration of rights.\" The Claimant adds that if the declaration is granted, the Respondent will be bound to abide by the award, pursuant to Article 53(1) of the ICSID Convention.\n\n68.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, the *Plama v. Bulgaria* passage relied on by the Respondent does not set a rigid, formalistic constraint on the acceptability of provisional measures in investment treaty arbitration. Rather, the *Plama* tribunal simply observes that the rights to be protected by provisional measures must be related to the specific disputes in the arbitration, which in turn derive from a Party's claims as well as its requests for relief. Whether a Party only or principally seeks damages as its relief does not foreclose the possibility that the Party's claims may involve certain rights that are the subject of specific disputes in the arbitration, and which arguably may come under threat. In that event, if the provisional measures being requested would protect such rights, a tribunal may determine that this element of the provisional measures test has been satisfied.\n\n69.\n\nIn the present arbitration, as noted above, it is specifically disputed whether the Claimant is entitled to his asserted ownership of CO. A provisional measure that would prohibit revocation or suspension of CO's operating license (and/or reversal of the Transaction) pending the final award clearly would protect the ownership right that Mr. Hasanov asserts in CO, which is at the heart of the claims in dispute in this arbitration, leaving aside whether the declarations sought by the Claimant are the functional equivalent of specific performance. On this basis, the Tribunal finds that the first provisional measure ground requested by the Claimant *(i.e.,* para. 143.1) would preserve a right that is related to a specific dispute in this arbitration; therefore the Claimant has therefore satisfied this element of the provisional measures standard.\n\n*(c) Urgency*\n-------------\n\n70.\n\nThe Claimant cites the urgency standard adopted in CLA-24 *(Biwater Gauff v. Tanzania),* where the tribunal quoted C. Schreuer, The ICSID Convention, p. 751: \"it is clear that provisional measures will only be appropriate where a question cannot await the outcome of the award on the merits.\"80 The Respondent chiefly relies on the standard expressed in RL-6 *(Occidental v. Ecuador)* and CLA-31 *(Rizzani de Echer v. Kuwait)* (Resp. slide 41): \"Provisional measures are not meant to protect against any potential or hypothetical harm susceptible to result from uncertain actions. Rather, they are meant to protect the requesting party from imminent harm\" (RL-6).81\n\nCl. Slide 15.\n\nCLA-31 is to the same effect: \"Further, in view of the twin requirements of urgency and necessity, it must follow that the harm alleged by the requesting party must be \"imminent,\" and not \"potential or \"hypothetical.\"\n\n71.\n\nThe Claimant insists (Tr., pages 15-16) that \"imminent\" simply means that something is not purely hypothetical and speculative; \"it means it could be happening soon. So if it\u2019s happening before you issue your award, that\u2019s imminent enough to make it necessary to issue provisional measures to protect the situation.\" The Respondent contends (Tr., p.61) that the Claimant \"has not established any risk of a suspension of CO\u2019s authorization to operate, let alone an imminent one.\"\n\n72.\n\nThe Tribunal sees no need to choose between the competing formulations of \"urgency\" presented by the Parties. The relevant question in the context of this arbitration is whether the Claimant has demonstrated that there would be a genuine risk of license revocation or suspension (or Transaction reversal) before the issuance of the final award on the merits, absent provisional relief from the Tribunal.\n\n73.\n\nThe Claimant\u2019s answer is that the GNCC has never made a decision, \"let alone a firm decision,\" to not revoke CO\u2019s license. Rather, the GNCC and Georgia have indicated that they would prefer not to revoke, but in at least two GNCC meetings (May 2020 and October 2021)82 \"it was very clearly stated that that\u2019s the only option that is left if they are unable to obtain the reversal through the Special Manager\" (Tr., pages 75-76). The Claimant adds that revocation would \"not permanently cut off all of the millions of people that are involved: the asset would just be put into some other entity. The company would go bankrupt, the State would take it over in bankruptcy, or the banks would take it over, and they would just simply destroy Mr. Hasanov\u2019s investment.\" When pressed during the Hearing (Tr., pages 91-92) on whether the Claimant can show that he will be *imminently* harmed absent a formal constraint from the Tribunal preventing revocation or suspension, the Claimant stated that the \"GNCC has made it plain that it has no other recourse available to it in order to procure compliance with its decisions than revocation, and thus we must fear that revocation is an imminent possibility.\" Since, there is a serious risk of revocation, \"it\u2019s neither here nor there whether there\u2019s a third party out there who shares our concerns.\"\n\nDuring the Hearing (Tr., pp. 76-77), the Claimant did not vigorously pursue its suggestion (Cl. Update, para. 32) that the possibility of license revocation was also discussed during the July 29, 2021, GNCC meeting.\n\n74.\n\nThe Respondent\u2019s answer is, as stated above, that no risk exists (Tr., pages 95-96, 63-65). There is no imminent threat of revocation. According to the Respondent, the record suggests \"that the GNCC has identified substantial harm [to Georgia from revocation], has put the Special Manager in place and will not proceed with the revocation.\" The GNCC did consider suspension, not revocation, in the spring of 2020, but the October 1, 2020, decision (C-34: R-1) detailed the substantial harm to Georgia\u2019s interests from suspension, and that is why the Special Manager was appointed. There is \"not the slightest indication\" that Georgia \"would be planning to revoke CO\u2019s authorization.\" [REDACTED] The deadline of December 31, 2021, that was set at the October 15, 2021, meeting was simply to avoid the expiration of the statute of limitations and to provide an opportunity for settlement; it had nothing to do with a hope to revoke authorization to operate.\n\n75.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that while the GNCC assessed in 2020 that suspension would substantially harm Georgia\u2019s interests, it is significant for provisional measures purposes, as the Claimant argues, that Georgia is unwilling to undertake that it shall not revoke or suspend CO\u2019s authorization (or otherwise reverse the Transaction) during the pendency of this arbitration. In this context, the Tribunal credits the Claimant's argument that there is a non-speculative risk that Georgia, if unconstrained by this Tribunal and appreciating that it may not be able to achieve Transaction reversal other than by revocation, may seek to implement a financial arrangement so that CO's core assets are maintained and consumers are protected, with the Claimant's purported investment having been removed. Although the GNCC decided not to revoke or suspend CO's authorization in 2020, it certainly contemplated that option. In short, it would be neither hypothetical nor speculative to consider that the GNCC (if unconstrained by a provisional measures) may again entertain that option and decide to implement it before a final award is issued in this arbitration.\n\n76.\n\nThe Tribunal concludes that the Claimant has demonstrated that there would be a genuine risk of license revocation or suspension (or Transaction reversal) before the issuance of the final award on the merits, absent provisional relief from the Tribunal.\n\n*(d) Narrow and Specific*\n-------------------------\n\n77.\n\nThe Claimant states (Tr., p. 34) that this is a non-element: the cases \"do not speak of any requirement that measures be narrow or specific of the minimum necessary in the circumstances.\" He relies on RL-9 (Cl. slide-39, *PNG Sustainable Development v. Papua New Guinea):* \"A tribunal, and the party defending the request for provisional measures, are able to clearly identify the measures, and ensure compliance therewith.\" The Respondent contends (Resp. Observations, paras. 65-70; Resp. Reply, 107-122) that investment treaty tribunals have consistently rejected \"broad and general requests for provisional measures,\" and cites several cases affirming this proposition. The Respondent further asserts that Article 47 of the ICSID Convention, empowering tribunals to recommend provisional measures, is \"an exception to the general principle of state sovereignty,\" and therefore ICSID tribunals should \"recommend only the minimum steps necessary to meet the objectives of the Convention\" (quoting RL-5, *Nova Group v. Romania).* The Respondent asserts that Claimant's reliance on *PNG v. Papua New Guinea* is misplaced, since that tribunal explained that overly broad requests, by their very nature, are inconsistent with the purpose of provisional relief.\n\n78.\n\nWhile the Claimant maintains its position that \"narrow and specific\" is not a requirement, he adds (Tr., p. 34) that his requested measures are not overly broad or difficult to understand or police, \"which are the considerations that have concerned tribunals in the past. They merely seek to protect the status quo, to prevent further aggravation of the dispute, to keep the business alive pending the determination of these proceedings.\"\n\n79.\n\nThe Respondent (Resp. Reply, paras. 110-115; Resp. slide 18) points out that the Claimant\u2019s request in para. 143.1, as reformulated (with the reformulated request being even broader than the original request), seeks a stay of the making of any administrative decision by the GNCC in respect of CO. The request includes vague as well as overly broad provisions. Thus, the \"First measure\" request (as well as the requested constraints on the Special Manager) would \"place CO, a closely regulated company with a dominant market position that owns critical infrastructure, in a regulatory vacuum, allowing Claimant to control strategic infrastructure in Georgia as he deems fit\" (Tr., p. 47).\n\n80.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the Claimant accepts, pursuant to *PNG Sustainable v. Papua New Guinea,* that a provisional measure must be clearly identified by the Tribunal and the Respondent, such that compliance may be ensured. Accordingly, if the Tribunal considers that the Claimant\u2019s stated need for provisional relief against the risk of revocation, suspension, and Transaction reversal is justified, the provisional measure must provide for clear identification of the enjoined action. A broad, general request could in principle be permissible, provided that it is necessary to protect the disputed right and is - pursuant to the reasoning in *Nova Group v. Romania* - the minimum step necessary to protect the disputed right.\n\n81.\n\nThe Claimant\u2019s request in para. 143.1 (\"First measure,\" Cl. Slide 39) is, however, too general, too broad, and too vague to constitute a measure that provides a clear identification of the enjoined action, leaving aside the omission of a term expressly designating revocation. For example, the parenthetical, \"(specifically but non-exclusively),\" arguably enjoins *any* GNCC decision concerning CO, which obviously covers much more ground than revocation, suspension, or Transaction reversal. The phrase \"would lead to the suspension,\" is vague, and it provides insufficient guidance to the Respondent as to what would be impermissible. The phrase, \"may directly or indirectly lead to the forced reversal of the Transaction,\" is, again, vague, and it provides insufficient guidance as to what would be impermissible.\n\n82.\n\nSince the \"First measure\" (Cl. Response, para. 143.1) lacks the necessary specificity to provide clear guidance to the Respondent of the action to be enjoined, if the Tribunal were to determine that provisional measures are warranted to protect the Claimant\u2019s asserted rights against the risk of revocation/suspension and Transaction reversal, the Tribunal would need to exercise its authority pursuant to ICSID Convention Article 47 and ICSID Arbitration Rule 39(3) to recommend measures other than those contained in the Claimant\u2019s First measure. Indeed, the Claimant recognizes (Tr., p. 90) that it is within the Tribunal\u2019s discretion \"to formulate the relief in the way\" that the Tribunal considers more precise. As currently written then, the Claimant\u2019s First measure cannot be accepted as a provisional measure, as it is overly broad and vague.\n\n83.\n\nA revision of the Claimant\u2019s requested \"First measure\" (para.143.1 of Cl. Resp.) would read as follows:\n\n\u2022 ***Pending the conclusion of this arbitration, the Respondent (including the GNCC and all other State entities) shall not revoke or suspend CO\u2019s authorization to operate. Further, the Respondent shall not seek to restore the shareholding of CO that existed prior to the time that Claimant obtained a purported indirect 100 percent shareholding in CO. This provisional measure may be modified or withdrawn upon a showing of good cause.***\n\n*(e) Preserving the Status Quo and Preventing Aggravation of the Dispute; Improving the Claimant\u2019s Position*\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n84.\n\nThe Claimant refers to the ICSID Explanatory Notes to ICSID Arbitration Rule 39 (CLA-45, Cl. Slide 29): \"Article 47 of the Convention ... is based on the principle that once a dispute is submitted to arbitration the parties should not take steps that might aggravate or extend their dispute, or prejudice the execution of the award.\" In relation to the question of preserving the *status quo,* the Claimant cites, *e.g*., RL-6 *(Occidental v. Ecuador,* Cl. Slide 31), for the proposition that, where the ownership in a piece of property is in dispute, a provisional measure could be ordered \"to require that the property not be sold or alienated before the final award of the arbitral tribunal. Such an order would preserve the *status quo* of the property, thus preserving the rights of the party in the property.\" As for the question whether such an order would impermissibly improve the Claimant's position, the Claimant further notes that the *Occidental v. Ecuador* tribunal stated (Cl. Slide 33) that \"although a right might not yet have been recognized by the Tribunal, such a right may nonetheless be deserving of protection by way of provisional measures.\" The Claimant disagrees with the Respondent's position that provisional measures must be necessary to prevent actions that would make the resolution of the dispute in arbitration more difficult (Tr., pages 32-33). The Claimant states that this restrictive view was taken by the *Plama* tribunal and followed in *Nova Group*, but the prevailing approach is that provisional measures are justified where the actions to be restrained would cause \"an aggravation of the dispute more generally, including because they would escalate or extend the dispute\" (citing *Tokios Tokeles v. Ukraine,* Tr., p. 33, CLA-100, Cl. Slide 37).\n\n85.\n\nThe Respondent comments that in the *Occidental* case, the claimants sought specific performance. Since the Claimant in this arbitration only asserts a right to monetary compensation, that alleged right (the claim to damages) will not be jeopardized if the provisional measure request is rejected (Resp. Reply, para. 182, also citing RL-1, *Phoenix v. Czech Republic).* As the *Occidental* tribunal also observed, provisional measures must preserve the respective rights of either party (Resp. Reply, para. 186). Further the Claimant's right to non-aggravation of the dispute must relate to his claim for monetary compensation (Resp. Reply, para. 183).\n\n86.\n\nThe Respondent's alternative position is that even if the Claimant had asserted a right to restitutionary relief, the provisional measures request would have to be dismissed; provisional measures must preserve the rights at issue, not give the requesting party enjoyment of those rights before the final award. The requested measures in this case would give the Claimant full benefit of controlling CO by fiat, rather than preserving his alleged right to do so (Resp. Reply, paras. 184-185). The Respondent quotes *Plama* (RL-3) (Resp. Reply, para. 189) for the proposition, followed by numerous tribunals, that \"the right to non-aggravation of the dispute refers to actions which would make resolution of the dispute by the Tribunal more difficult.\"83 Also as *Nova Group* explained (Resp. Reply, para. 190), it would be inappropriate if \"the simple step of initiating an ICSID claim\" gave an investor \"a sweeping right to freeze all circumstances as they then exist (perhaps for a period of years).\" On the Claimant\u2019s own case, the provisional measures would \"reinstate his unlawful control of CO, not preserve the *status quo*\" - which would impermissibly improve the Claimant\u2019s situation. (Resp. Reply, para. 193).\n\n*Nova Group* (RL-5) is to the same effect: the claimant must demonstrate the \"continuing events in the host State threaten to interfere unduly with the parties\u2019 ability to present positions in the arbitration, or the tribunal\u2019s ability to fashion meaningful relief at the close of the case.\"\n\n87.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that this composite element *(status quo*/aggravation of the dispute/impermissible improvement) has particular relevance to the Claimant\u2019s requested Second and Third Measures, concerning the powers of the Special Manager (Cl. Slide 39). In terms of the requested First measure, it is clear that, as of the commencement date of the arbitration (October 19, 2020), the Claimant still held his purported indirect 100 percent shareholding in CO. The Special Manager\u2019s appointment arose from that purported shareholding. The Claimant\u2019s First measure (as modified by the Tribunal, above) would thus preserve the *status quo* by preserving the Claimant\u2019s purported ownership rights, and would not improve the Claimant\u2019s position from that when the arbitration was commenced. If the Respondent were able to revoke or suspend CO\u2019s authorization or reverse the Transaction, it is apparent that the Parties\u2019 dispute would be extended. The nature of the relief sought by the Claimant does not negate this adjudicative reality. While the *Plama* and *Nova Group* tribunals placed an additional wrinkle on \"aggravation of the dispute\" element, the Tribunal\u2019s view is that the Claimant need not show that revocation or suspension or reversal of the Transaction would make the Tribunal\u2019s resolution of the dispute more difficult - though, it appears to the Tribunal that such actions by the State would certainly add complications to the resolution of the dispute.\n\n88.\n\nFinally, in view of the Respondent\u2019s position that it has firmly decided not to revoke or suspend CO\u2019s authorization, the Tribunal considers that the First measure does not in itself impose any disproportionate burden on the Respondent, though this question also needs to be considered in the context of the Claimant\u2019s requested Second and Third Measures (discussed below).\n\n*(f) Irreparable Harm*\n----------------------\n\n89.\n\nRelying again on *PNG Sustainable Development v. Papua New Guinea* (RL-9, Cl. Slide 11; see also Cl. Slides 1284 and 14 for other cases that the Claimant relies on), the Claimant argues that \"irreparable harm\" requires a showing of a material risk of serious or grave damage, but not harm that is literally irreparable in the narrow common law sense of the term. The relative harm to be suffered by each party is also to be taken into account.\n\nCl. Slide 12 identifies cases in which, according to the Claimant, an underlying claim for specific performance was not required in order for provisional measures to be granted.\n\n90.\n\nTo the Respondent (Resp. Reply, paras. 125-137), which relies on *Metalclad v. Mexico* (RL-42) and a string of other investment treaty awards, \"irreparable harm\" means an injury \"that cannot be made good by the subsequent payment of damages.\" Georgia argues that the relied on by the Claimant to dilute the high threshold posed by this element are mostly specific performance cases. Moreover, the Claimant does report that, in cases that he cites, the tribunals commented that there must be a high likelihood that the irreparable harm will occur and the harm must be imminent.\n\n91.\n\nThe Tribunal has already addressed the issues of imminent, genuine risk of revocation/suspension/Transaction reversal. The remaining issues raised by this element are the definition of irreparable harm and the balancing of potential harms. While in some contexts the availability of damages may negate the basis for provisional relief, the availability of damages is not dispositive, particularly when an issue in the case is whether a purported investment, which the State did not eliminate in advance of the arbitration, shall remain in place. In this sense, \"irreparable harm\" and preservation of the *status quo* are mirror images. As for the balancing of potential harms Georgia's repeated statements that the GNCC has decided not to seek revocation or suspension because of the importance of CO's ongoing operations to the State and its citizens would strongly indicate that Georgia would not be harmed in any significant way, if at all, by the adoption of the First measure (as modified by the Tribunal). The Respondent, in fact, has not identified any harm to Georgia from its being prevented to revoke or suspend CO's license; it simply says (Tr., pages 62-63) that the Claimant must establish that the provisional measure is necessary and urgent. The Tribunal has already found that it is (as modified), precisely because the GNCC declines to undertake that it will not revoke or suspend CO's license.\n\n*(g) Conclusion - License Revocation/Suspension: The Claimant\u2019s Request for Provisional Measures*\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n92.\n\nFor the reasons discussed above, the Tribunal finds that, in relation to its First measure, concerning the issues of license revocation or suspension,85 the Claimant has established the elements that compose the provisional measures standard, with one important exception: the Claimant's proposed reformulated First measure is overly broad and vague. The Tribunal, exercising its authority under ICSID Convention 47 and ICSID Arbitration Rule 39(3), accordingly revises the First measure, as follows, and recommends this revised provisional measure be adhered to by the Parties - ***Pending the conclusion of this arbitration, the Respondent (including the GNCC and all other State entities) shall not revoke or suspend CO's authorization to operate. Further, the Respondent shall not seek to restore the shareholding of CO that existed prior to the time that Claimant obtained a purported indirect 100 percent shareholding in CO. This provisional measure may be modified or withdrawn upon a showing of good cause****.*\n\nThe Claimant\u2019s First measure, as noted above, includes a broader category concerning reversal of the Transaction *(i.e.,* restoration of CO\u2019s shareholding prior to the Claimant\u2019s purported investment). Although it is not specifically apparent how such reversal might be achieved, the Tribunal considers it appropriate that this category be included in a provisional measure that concerns a bar to the removal of the Claimant\u2019s purported investment.\n\n**B. The Question of the Special Manager**\n------------------------------------------\n\n93.\n\nThe Claimant contends (Tr., pages 17-20) that unless the Second and Third measures are adopted by the Tribunal, CO will be prevented from carrying out its business plan to grow the company and the Claimant will be unable to \"get a return on investment and survive and long-term finance itself.\" The Claimant cites, by way of example, CO\u2019s inability to negotiate properly with Amazon and the loss of a major contract with MagtiCom because of the Special Manager\u2019s alleged interference and day-to-day blocking of company activities. The Claimant relies, in particular, on the Venice Commission\u2019s review of the Special Manager\u2019s powers (C-44, Cl. Slide 1786), in view of her remit to reverse the Transaction, in which the Commission determined (Tr., p. 24) that the Special Manager\u2019s role \"violated the right to property under Article 1, Protocol 1, of the ECHR.\" The Claimant asserts (Tr., pages 28-31) that the GNCC\u2019s October 1, 2020, decision (C-34: Cl. Slide 34) meant, in effect, that the Special Manager \"was only required to reverse the Transaction,\" so that her further intention to operate CO in a way that she thinks is efficient is outside her remit (assuming that her appointment was valid, which the Claimant rejects).\n\nJoint Opinion of the Venice Commission and the Directorate of Human Rights and Rule of Law of the Council of Europe on the recent amendments to the Law on Electronic Communications and the Law on Broadcasting, paras. 29, 35, 36.\n\n94.\n\nThe Respondent argues (Tr., p. 42) that the Special Manager is Georgia\u2019s protection against the Claimant\u2019s attempt to take control of CO in violation of Georgian law and to \"use the company as a vehicle to carry out the Azerbaijan Digital Hub Project.\" The Second measure, if granted, would place CO, a company that owns critical infrastructure, \"in a regulatory vacuum,\" and the Third measure \"would effectively neutralize the powers of the Special Manager, given the breadth of the powers that would be vested in the management that Claimant installed in CO; in CO\u2019s supervisory board, composed of members selected by Claimant; and CO\u2019s shareholders\u2019 meeting, composed of Nelgado and ION, each controlled by Claimant\" (Tr., pages 47-48). The Second and Third measures, according to the Respondent, would preserve none of Georgia\u2019s rights and would instead strip Georgia of its regulatory powers over CO (Tr., p. 48).\n\n*(a) Prima Facie Jurisdiction*\n------------------------------\n\n95.\n\nAs discussed above, paragraph 65 footnote 78, the Claimant has satisfied this element of the provisional measures standard for his Second and Third measures requests as well as for his First measure request.\n\n*(b) Preserving the Rights for Which Protection Is Sought*\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n96.\n\nAs discussed above, paragraph 68, the rights to be protected by provisional measures must be related to the specific disputes in the arbitration, which in turn derive from a Party\u2019s claims as well as its requests for relief. However, the applicant\u2019s purported rights are not the only ones to be considered; the potential effect of the provisional measures on the Respondent\u2019s purported rights must also be part of the decisional matrix.\n\n97.\n\nThe Claimant requests the Second and Third measures to protect the value of his purported investment - for which he seeks damages or compensation in this arbitration87 - and to proceed with the execution of CO\u2019s business plan, which the Claimant seeks to institute, presuming that his ownership interest is accepted, at least during the arbitration.88 The Second measure (Cl. Response, para. 143.2; Cl. Slide 39) would proscribe the Special Manager from \"exercising any of the powers conferred on her\" by the October 1, 2020, GNCC Decision, including, specifically (but non-exclusively), actions that (i) are adverse to CO; (ii) interfere with CO\u2019s day-to-day management and business activities; and (iii) are designed to procure the forced reversal of the Transaction. The Third measure would order the Special Manager to approve a Nelgado director\u2019s (Mr. Taghiyev) request that CO\u2019s governing bodies be empowered to carry out an array of managerial activities.\n\nSee Request, paras. 125-127.\n\nSee Request, para. 108: The Special Managers\u2019 actions have \"stymied CO\u2019s ability to complete the Digital Silk Road Project\" and have created losses of \"many millions of dollars.\"\n\n98.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that, taken together, the Second and Third measures would completely erase the Special Manager's powers under the GNCC's October 1, 2020, Decision. The allegation is that unless these powers are removed, the Claimant will be prevented from enjoying the financial benefits he planned to derive from his purported investment (though, as pointed out above, the relief that the Claimant seeks in this arbitration is damages or compensation for the diminished value of his purported investment). The Claimant has not adduced (at least not at this stage) the particulars of CO's business plan, the further investments in CO that he planned to attract, and the revenue streams that he had projected for the company. The Claimant, instead, provides certain instances where, he alleges, the Special Manager has taken \"detrimental actions towards CO\" since her appointment and obstructed CO's business *(e.g.,* Cl. Slides 18-25). There is no quantitative assessment of the losses allegedly suffered by CO if the Special Manager acts pursuant to the powers accorded to her by the GNCC. In particular, there is no showing by the Claimant that the Special Manager, acting pursuant to the powers accorded to her, would destroy CO as a going concern (*see* Request, para. 122). On this basis, the Second and Third measures can only be said to possibly to lessen the amount of damages that the Claimant may be entitled to if he prevails on liability at the merits stage of this arbitration.\n\n99.\n\nGeorgia's rights, on the other hand, are based on its position that the Claimant's investment is illegal. It argues that its regulatory powers over CO - including, in particular, its capacity to preserve Georgia's ability to compete with the Azerbaijan Digital Hub project - will be eliminated if the Second and Third measures are adopted as provisional measures. The Bakcell Report (R-32, Resp. Slides 25-27), according to the Respondent, demonstrates that unless Georgia can exercise regulatory control -through the Special Manager - over CO for the pendency of this arbitration, Georgia's political economy is at serious risk of grave damage. Thus, the broad wording of the Second and Third measures, whereby the Special Manager would have no substantive powers, would eliminate a regulatory right that Georgia is entitled to have protected until the conclusion of this arbitration. This right would be eliminated in circumstances where there has been no showing of a threat to CO\u2019s financial well-being.\n\n100.\n\nThe Respondent observes (Tr., p. 55) that even if the Claimant loses the arbitration, \"the company would entirely change its strategy of provision of services and would change its strategic directions\" - to the detriment of Georgia and in ways that Georgia could not correct \"far beyond the completion of the arbitration.\" The Respondent adds (Tr., p. 98) that \"the lawfulness of the decision on the appointment of the Special Manager is one of the core issues in dispute in this case\"; it is a merits issues that has not yet been briefed and should not be prejudged by the Tribunal.\n\n101.\n\nThe Tribunal finds the Claimant has identified a number of potential risks to CO\u2019s economic attainments from the appointment of the Special Manager (with the powers accorded to her by the GNCC).89 Blocking the Special Manager\u2019s powers during the arbitration arguably may reduce the damages/compensation that the Claimant would otherwise seek to recover in a final award. From a related perspective, protection of the Claimant\u2019s purported ownership rights - which the Tribunal has granted through the revised First measure - would be of little value if the purported investment were at risk of dissolution and the Second and Third measures would preserve that investment. The record before the Tribunal, however, does not contain compelling evidence that the Special Manager\u2019s exercise of her October 1, 2020, powers would threaten CO as a going concern (*see* Tr., pages 96-102; Resp. November 18, 2021, Resp. Update Response, paras. 11-21). The thinness of the evidence of economic disruption due to the Special Manager\u2019s exercise of her powers must also be weighed against the Respondent\u2019s regulatory rights, and its specific right in this arbitration to have its position adjudicated - and not pre-judged - that the Claimant\u2019s investment was illegal and the Special Manager\u2019s appointment and powers were legal. The Tribunal\u2019s weighing of these issues leads it to conclude that the Second and Third measures are not necessary to preservation of the rights for which protection is sought by the Claimant. Further, the Tribunal credits the Respondent\u2019s argument concerning disproportionality (Tr., p. 103): \"On the one hand, Claimant would suffer a compensable loss of a business opportunity: on the other hand, in a worst case scenario, Georgia would suffer very substantial economic harm, and potentially irreparable harm.\"\n\nThe Tribunal also considers that the Respondent has persuasively rebutted certain allegations of disruption and obstruction caused by the Special Manager: *see, e.g.,* Respondent\u2019s Nov. 18, 2021, Response to Claimant\u2019s Update (\"**Resp. Update Response**\"), paras. 11-21. In particular, the Respondent has provided a detailed dissection of the Claimant\u2019s \"Amazon\" allegation (Cl. Update, para. 19.1) at Resp. Update Response, para. 14; see also Tr., pp. 97-98.\n\n*(c) Urgency*\n-------------\n\n102.\n\nAlong the lines of the Tribunal\u2019s discussion in paragraph 72, above, the relevant question under this heading is whether (a) the Claimant has demonstrated that there would be a genuine risk to CO as a going concern before the issuance of the final award, absent the Tribunal\u2019s adoption of the Second and Third measures as recommended provisional measures, or (b) even absent a bankruptcy risk, has the Claimant established that the Special Manager would seek to act in with the purpose of damaging the economic wellbeing of CO.90 As already considered in paragraph 101 above, the Tribunal finds that such a risk does not exist, and therefore the Claimant has not satisfied the urgency element.\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n*(d) Narrow and Specific*\n-------------------------\n\n103.\n\nThe Second measure would, on its face, completely eliminate the Special Manager\u2019s powers and, in effect, overrule the GNCC\u2019s October 1, 2020 Decision for the duration of the arbitration. (The Third measure is a parallel provision whereby CO\u2019s director, supervisory board and shareholders would be expressly authorized to manage the company and take decisions without seeking the Special Manager\u2019s approval; see C-41, Letter from the Nelgado Director to the Special Manager, dated January 11, 2021.)\n\n104.\n\nWhile the Second and Third measures certainly convey clarity to the Respondent (and the Tribunal) about enjoined actions, the problem with these requested measures is that they would enjoin *all* actions; *i.e.,* these measures would nullify a regulatory decision of the State in its entirety; as the Respondent argues, this would effectively amount to a prejudgment that the Special Manager's appointment was illegal. In circumstances where the Claimant has not sought to identify specific powers of the Special Manager that might arguably be enjoined as a provisional measure and would not amount to a prejudgment of illegality, the Tribunal considers that the clarity of the requested measures - an elimination of all powers of the Special Manager - is outweighed by the Claimant not having proposed the minimum step necessary to protect the disputed right. (See above, paragraph 80, including the reference to RL-5, *Nova Group v. Romania.)*\n\n*(e) Preserving the Status Quo and Preventing Aggravation of the Dispute; Improving the Claimant\u2019s Position*\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n105.\n\nThe Claimant's *status quo* difficulty is that the GNCC's October 1, 2020 Decision, in which the Special Manager is accorded the powers that the Claimant seeks to block with the Second and Third measures, pre-dates the filing of the Request for Arbitration (October 19, 2020). As a practical matter, then, preserving the *status quo* would appear to entail preserving the Special Manager's October 1 powers. The Claimant's counter-argument focuses (C-34, C-44, C-57, Cl. Slides 17, 34-35, Tr., pages 29-31, 79-89) on the purpose of the Special Manager's appointment (Cl. Slide 34) - \"The Special Manager shall be in charge of ensuring restoration\" of CO's pre-acquisition shareholding, and shall exercise her powers with the \"belief that each of her actions/omissions will best ensure the fulfillment\" of the restoration obligation. On this basis, the Claimant asserts (Tr., p. 30) that the GNCC's Decision does not give the Special Manager \"a mandate\" to operate CO or to interfere in its day-to-day management. Along these lines, by seeking to interfere in the company's management (C-57, Cl. Slide 35), the Special Manager has misinterpreted her remit. Accordingly, (Tr., p. 31), to preserve the *status quo* would mean to prevent the Special Manager from exercising her powers and interfering in the business of the company.\n\n106.\n\nThe Claimant reiterates (Tr., pages 79-80) that the *status quo* was \"a Special Manager in place with a remit to reverse the Transaction\"; nothing more. For support, the Claimant refers to the Venice Commission (C-34), which found that the Special Manager Law violates the European Convention on Human Rights because \"it gives powers that have nothing to do with the purported goal\" - which, moreover, was a goal that the Special Manager could not achieve in any event. The Claimant rejects the notion (Tr., pages 82-84) that the Special Manager\u2019s understanding of her powers, as expressed, *e.g.,* in R-79, has any bearing on what the GNCC actually authorized her to do; her actions are \"simply not a legally protected right,\" since she is \"trying to do more\" than her legal authorization would permit.\n\n107.\n\nThe Respondent\u2019s *status quo* position focuses (Resp. Reply, paras. 187, 193-195) on \"prejudgment\": *i.e.,* absent a finding that the Special Manager\u2019s appointment was unlawful, the Special Manager has the power to manage CO. Thus, to grant the requested Second and Third measures would require the Tribunal to prejudge a merits issue. Further, as a factual matter, the appointment of the Special Manager was part pf the *status quo* and the dispute submitted to the Tribunal - indeed, the Claimant\u2019s own case is that he lost \"all control over CO\" by virtue of the October 1, 2020 GNCC Decision (Request, para. 89). To restore the Claimant\u2019s unlawful (as the Respondent sees it) control over CO would be to \"impermissibly improve Claimant\u2019s situation\" and to impose on Georgia the Claimant\u2019s \"attempted investment in CO as a *fait accompli\"* (Resp. Reply, paras. 194-195).\n\n108.\n\nThe Tribunal cannot simply adopt, and at this stage of the arbitral proceedings takes no view on, the finding of the Venice Commission (C-44, Cl. Slide 17). The Tribunal has not heard full evidence and submissions on the proper interpretation under the applicable law of the GNCC\u2019s October 1, 2020 Decision, and the alleged disjuncture between the Special Manager\u2019s mandate and the powers accorded to her. The Tribunal observes that Special Manager Miriam Sulaberidze made the following comments in her Report (October 1, 2020 - February 28, 2021, R-79), which the Tribunal is not now in position to question:\n\n*My powers and mandate as a special manager are determined by the decision of the Commission. My main task and function is to enforce the decision of the Commission and to neutralize the risks set out in the decision of the Commission, in particular, as a result of illegal alienation of the share of Caucasus Online Ltd. Illegal alienation of shares must not threaten the competitive environment in the relevant segment of the Internet service delivery market in Georgia and must not harm the users of Internet services in Georgia and the regional competitiveness of Georgia.*\n\n*During the reporting period, my main activities were to study the situation of the company in order to plan further decisions to implement the decision of the commission....*\n\n*Every decision made by me was dictated by the belief and motives that it is the best decision for enforcing the Commission\u2019s decision. The main goal of my activities was distancing the person who illegally acquired the shares of Caucasus Online Ltd., as much as possible, from the company\u2019s activities and agreeing in advance with the existing management decisions of the company. As a Special Manager, I assisted the CEO of the company in the smooth running of the day-to-day operations of the company. During the reporting period, the company did not have any delays in its normal business activities. In addition, during the reporting period, I did not consent to any activities that were inconsistent with the decision of the Commission, the execution of which is the responsibility of the Special Manager. I did not consent to the following issues: [e.g., an MOU with certain companies, since CO was mentioned as a subsidiary of NEQSOL Group]..*\n\n109.\n\nThe Tribunal\u2019s recommendation of the revised First measure prevents what the Claimant states that the Special Manager herself could not (and cannot) achieve, though the State might otherwise seek to achieve - the reversal of the Transaction. However, the Tribunal deems it inappropriate to consider whether, at this time, the Special Manager\u2019s determination \"to neutralize the risks set out in the decision of the Commission, in particular, as a result of illegal alienation of the share of Caucasus Online Ltd*.*\" is improper and should therefore be enjoined, particularly since her determination was apparently the approach taken before this arbitration commenced. Further, when the Special Manager reports that the \"main goal of my activities was distancing the person who illegally acquired the shares of Caucasus Online Ltd., as much as possible, from the company\u2019s activities*,*\" the Tribunal cannot now determine whether this approach constitutes action outside the Special Manager\u2019s mandate. The Special Manager\u2019s approach supports Georgia\u2019s position that, without the Special Manager\u2019s exercise of the powers accorded to her by the GNCC, Georgia will be unable as a practical matter to preserve its challenge to the legality of the Claimant's purported investment and the implications of his disputed ownership interest.91\n\nSee Tr., p. 99, where the Respondent states that the \"powers conferred on the Special Manager allow the Special Manager to counteract any unlawful influence by the Claimant on CO\u2019s management and operations.\"\n\n110.\n\nIn view of the Tribunal's finding that (a) the Special Manager's powers predated the commencement of this arbitration, and (b) it would be inappropriate at this stage of the proceedings to adjudicate the Special Manager's legality in exercising those powers, the Tribunal considers that the *status quo* and \"aggravation of the dispute\" elements weigh in the Respondent's favor.\n\n*(f) Irreparable Harm*\n----------------------\n\n111.\n\nThe Tribunal has found (see paragraph 101 above) that the Claimant has not adduced compelling evidence showing that the Special Manager's exercise of her October 1, 2020, powers would threaten CO as a going concern. See*,* for example, the Respondent's arguments (Tr., pages 67-68 and 97-98), which indicate that the Special Manager's exercise of her powers has not damaged CO. In considering the balance of harms, the Tribunal also credits the Respondent's contention (Tr., p. 48) that the Second and Third measures \"would strip Georgia of its regulatory powers over CO, prohibit from addressing serious and deliberate violations of its laws, and cause it substantial and potentially irreparable harm.\" The Respondent adds (Tr., p. 103) that the Georgian courts \"have identified that there is substantial harm to the Georgian telecommunications market in terms of competition, in terms of the risk of a change in strategy in a manner that would negatively affect retail subscribers and Georgian public agencies and, third, the harm to international competitiveness.\"\n\n*(g) Conclusion - The Special Manager: The Claimant\u2019s Request for Provisional Measures*\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n112.\n\nFor the above reasons, the Claimant's requested Second and Third measures (Cl. Response, paras. 143.2 and 143.3) do not satisfy the elements that compose the provisional measures standard. The Tribunal therefore declines to recommend these measures. Upon a showing of good cause, the Claimant is at liberty to apply for significantly more limited measures that would not, *inter alia,* entail a prejudgment of the legality of the GNCC\u2019s October 1, 2020, Decision.\n\n**IV. RECOMMENDATION UNDER ICSID CONVENTION ARTICLE 47; ICSID ARBITRATION RULE 39(3)**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n113.\n\nThe Claimant\u2019s requested First measure is recommended in revised form as follows:\n\n***Pending the conclusion of this arbitration, the Respondent (including the GNCC and all other State entities) shall not revoke or suspend CO\u2019s authorization to operate. Further, the Respondent shall not seek to restore the shareholding of CO that existed prior to the time that Claimant obtained a purported indirect 100 percent shareholding in CO. This provisional measure may be modified or withdrawn upon a showing of good cause.***\n\n114.\n\nThe Claimant\u2019s requested Second and Third measures are denied. Upon a showing of good cause, the Claimant is at liberty to apply for significantly more limited measures that would not, *inter alia,* entail a prejudgment of the legality of the GNCC\u2019s October 1, 2020, Decision.\n\n115.\n\nCosts are reserved."}, {"Title": "Decision on Costs (Inter-State Negotiation Objection)", "Type": "Costs", "Date": "2022-08-02T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Decision on Costs (Inter-State Negotiation Objection)\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n**I. INTRODUCTION**\n-------------------\n\n1.\n\nThe Parties have each submitted, on May 5, 2022, succinct statements of costs and requests for allocation of costs in relation to the Tribunal's Decision on the Inter-State Negotiation Objection.\n\n2.\n\nICSID Convention Article 61(2) states as follows:\n\n\"In the case of arbitration proceedings the Tribunal shall, except as the parties otherwise agree, assess the expenses incurred by the parties in connection with the proceedings, and shall decide how and by whom those expenses, the fees and expenses of the members of the Tribunal and the charges for the use of the facilities of the Centre shall be paid. Such decision shall form part of the award.\"\n\n3.\n\nICSID Arbitration Rule 28(1) (2006 edition) provides as follows:\n\n\"Without prejudice to the final decision on the payment of the cost of the proceeding, the Tribunal may, unless otherwise agreed by the parties, decide:\n\n(a) at any stage of the proceeding, the portion which each party shall pay, pursuant to Administrative and Financial Regulation 14, of the fees and expenses of the Tribunal and the charges for the use of the facilities of the Centre;\n\n(b) with respect to any part of the proceeding, that the related costs (as determined by the Secretary-General) shall be borne entirely or in a particular share by one of the parties.\"\n\n4.\n\nThe Azerbaijan-Georgia BIT does not refer to costs allocation.\n\n5.\n\nAlthough not applicable to this proceeding, the Tribunal notes that the recently amended ICSID Arbitration Rules (2022) contain guidance on costs decisions. New Rule 52 provides as follows:\n\n\"(1) In allocating the costs of the proceeding, the Tribunal shall consider all relevant circumstances, including:\n\n(a) the outcome of the proceeding or any part of it;\n\n(b) the conduct of the parties during the proceeding, including the extent to which they acted in an expeditious and cost- effective manner and complied with these Rules and the orders and decisions of the Tribunal;\n\n(c) the complexity of the issues; and\n\n(d) the reasonableness of the costs claimed.\"\n\nNew Arbitration Rule 3(1) is also relevant to costs decisions: the \"Tribunal and the parties shall conduct the proceeding in good faith and in an expeditious and cost-effective manner.\n\n6.\n\nThe Parties agree that the Tribunal has discretion to allocate costs. The Tribunal briefly summarizes the Parties' positions and then provides its analysis and ruling.\n\n**II. THE CLAIMANT'S POSITION**\n-------------------------------\n\n7.\n\nThe Claimant seeks an award of all costs that he incurred. He states that his costs are reasonable and proportionate in view of the issues addressed and the work undertaken to respond to Georgia's Objection. In particular, the Claimant asserts that the Objection was a wasteful, dilatory tactic. The Claimant accepts that the Tribunal found that Article 9 of the BIT contains an inter-State negotiation precondition, but comments that the Tribunal rejected Georgia's view on how the precondition can be satisfied. Additionally, the inter-Sate negotiation had occurred long before the Request for Arbitration (\"Request\") was filed, which Georgia obviously knew, and would have further understood from the Request and accompanying exhibits. The Claimant also asserts that even if the Objection had succeeded, the Claimant would simply have refiled the arbitration. For these reasons, the Claimant seeks recovery of his total costs of pounds sterling 420,671.39 and USD 89,733.00.\n\n**III. THE RESPONDENT'S POSITION**\n----------------------------------\n\n8.\n\nGeorgia states that the Tribunal should use its discretion to order that each Party shall bear its own costs incurred in connection with the Objection. Georgia comments that its Objection was advanced in good faith and was reasonable, in view of the Tribunal's Decision. Georgia points out that the Tribunal first granted its application for bifurcation and then endorsed Georgia's positions that (a) the\n\nBIT contains an inter-State negotiation requirement; and (b) the Claimant's non-compliance with the requirement would have brought the arbitration to an end (whether as a matter of jurisdiction or admissibility). While the Tribunal ultimately ruled that the Claimant has inadvertently complied with the requirement, the Claimant's position on the issue of compliance evolved significantly over the course of the proceedings. Georgia's total costs incurred amount to EUR 545,360.34, which it asserts is a reasonable amount given the issues and the Claimant's evolving positions.\n\n**IV. THE TRIBUNAL'S ANALYSIS**\n-------------------------------\n\n9.\n\nThe Tribunal considers the following factors to be significant in reaching its costs allocation determination:\n\n(i) Both sides conducted themselves with a very high degree of professionalism and civility, which the Tribunal expected but for which it is nonetheless grateful.\n\n(ii) The written and oral submissions of both sides were uniformly excellent.\n\n(iii) Georgia's Objection was lodged in good faith. Moreover, as Georgia notes, Georgia's application for bifurcation was successful, and resolution of the Objection entailed detailed consideration of important and very complex issues.\n\n(iv) While the Claimant ultimately prevailed on the Objection, Georgia's position on the existence of the inter-State negotiation requirement was upheld, which the Claimant had strongly opposed, particularly in his initial written and oral submissions.\n\n(v) The costs of each Party were reasonably incurred.\n\n10.\n\nIn view of these factors, the Tribunal considers that the appropriate allocation regarding the Decision on the Inter-State Negotiation Objection is for each Party to bear its own costs.\n\n11.\n\nThis allocation determination does not affect other allocation determinations that the Tribunal may be required to make. That is, this particular determination and the reasoning underlying it does not constrain the Tribunal's discretion in reaching and rendering any future allocation determination(s).\n\n**V. DECISION**\n---------------\n\n12.\n\nFor the reasons set out above, the Tribunal decides and orders:\n\nEach Party shall bear the costs that it incurred in relation to the Decision on the Inter-State Negotiation Objection."}]}
