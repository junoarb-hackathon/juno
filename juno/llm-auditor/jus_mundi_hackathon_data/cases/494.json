My dissent relates to matters of law and of facts.\n\n2.\n\nIn my view, the Tribunal has jurisdiction *ratione personae, ratione materiae and ratione temporis* under both the BIT and the ECT.\n\n**A- Jurisdiction ratione personae**\n------------------------------------\n\n3.\n\nAs to *ratione personae,* Article 1(a) of the BIT defines \"investor\" as meaning, *inter alia,* \"a legal person duly incorporated, constituted or otherwise duly organized under the applicable laws of a Contracting Party\". Similarly, Article 1(7) of the ECT includes in the definition of \"investor\" \"a company or other organization organized in accordance with the law applicable in that Contracting Party\". That is all that is required.1 Contrary to some other BITs, there are no further restrictions to qualify as an investor under either instrument.\n\nSee *Alpha Projektholding GmbH v. Ukraine,* ICSID Case No. ARB/07/16, Award (8 November 2010).\n\n4.\n\nIn the present case, Claimant having registered as a Dutch company on 26 April 1999 clearly meets the definition of \"an investor\" under both the BIT and the ECT. I believe that Prof. Stern shares that view.2\n\nParagraph 390; unless otherwise stated the mention \"Paragraph\" in the footnotes refers to a paragraph of the Award.\n\n5.\n\nI agree with the Majority that \"(i)n signing the Netherlands-Turkey BIT and the ECT, Turkey could not have expected that the treaty benefits would extend to just any Dutch company, regardless to its relationship to a Turkish investment. (...) Turkey agreed to arbitrate with Dutch entities that had actually made investments in Turkey.\"3 However, this is a different question that goes rather to *ratione materiae.*\n\nParagraphs 335 and 336 of the Award.\n\n6.\n\nIt is also well established that the investor must be a bona fide investor; there cannot be an abuse of process whereby a company is created in a Contracting State by nationals of the other Contracting State (or other investors) after a dispute has arisen in order to claim the benefits of a BIT. Again, this is a different question which I will address below.\n\n**B- Jurisdiction ratione materiae**\n------------------------------------\n\n7.\n\nAs to *ratione materiae,* both the BIT4 and the ECT5 contain a broad definition which includes shares, stock and other forms of equity participation in a company. In the present instance, Claimant held a 50% equity participation in [...] (the Second Turkish Project Company) which detained valuable rights relating to the Concession Contract, and, more particularly, the right to operate the [...] power plant for a period of 20 years with a guaranteed income stream.\n\nArticle 1(b).\n\nArticle 1(6).\n\n8.\n\nI disagree with Prof. Park's conclusion6 that \"Claimant cannot be considered as an \"Investor\" pursuant to either the ECT or the Netherlands-Turkey BIT\", Claimant having made \"no relevant contribution to the Project\".\n\nParagraph 349.\n\n9.\n\nIn his analysis, Prof. Park refers some time to \"contribution\" and some time to \"investment\", e.g. \"(...) to be an investor a person must actually make an investment, in the sense of an active contribution. (...) The Dutch entity, Alapli Elektrik, has not demonstrated that it actually made an investment in Turkey, in the sense of a meaningful contribution to Turkey\".7 There is a risk of confusion in the indifferent use of those terms as \"contribution\" is sometimes interpreted as requiring a meaningful contribution to the economic development of the receiving State, a notion that has been the subject of considerable controversy both in awards and in the literature relating to investment arbitration. The views expressed in that regard by the Tribunal in the *Salini v. Morocco**8* have not been adopted by other tribunals addressing the issue, the prevailing view being that the criteria mentioned in those two cases are not to be considered as \"jurisdictional requirements\".9 In any event, in the present case, I am of the view that the Project Company (and thereby Claimant) would meet even the *Salini* criteria if they were to be applied. For the purpose of brevity, I am assuming that when Prof. Park uses \"contribution\", he refers to \"investment\" as that word is defined in the BIT and the ECT.\n\nParagraph 350.\n\n*Salini Cosstruttori S.p.A, and Italstrade S.p.A. v. Kingdom of Morocco,* ICSID Case No. ARB/00/4, Decision on Jurisdiction (23 July 2001).\n\nSee *Malaysian Historical Salvors SDN, BHD v. Malaysia,* ICSID Case No. ARB/05/10, Decision on the Application of Annulment (16 April, 2009) para. 77; see also *Bayindir Insaat Turizm Ticaret Ve Sanayi A.S. v. Islamic Republic of Pakistan,* ICSID Case No. ARB/03/29, Decision on Jurisdiction (14 November.2005) para. 130 and other cases cited in that Decision. Even in the case of *Toto Costruzioni Generali S.p.A. v. Republic of Lebanon* (ICSID Case No. ARB/07/12, Decision on Jurisdiction (11 September 2009) mentioned by Prof. Park, the Tribunal rejected a strict reliance on the *Salini* tests.\n\n10.\n\nContrary to his conclusion, I am very much of the view that Claimant made a qualifying investment in Turkey.\n\n11.\n\nIt has been clearly established that Claimant had equity capital of US$ 60,800, most, if not all, of which was invested in [the Second Project Company], It thus acquired 50% equity ownership in [the Second Project Company] which detained valuable rights in the form of the Concession Contract.10\n\nSee *PSEG Global Inc. and Konya Ilgin Elektrik Uretim ve Ticaret Limited Sirketi v. Republic of Turkey,* ICSID Case, No. ARB/02/5, Award (19 January 2007), para. 104.\n\n12.\n\nProf. Park argues that, since the capital constituting the equity had been advanced by [X], Claimant could not be an investor under either the BIT or the ECT. In my view, nothing in either instrument allows for such an interpretation. Whether Claimant has obtained its equity money through a bank loan, a lottery win, a gift from a benevolent friend or found it on the street, is totally irrelevant. The question is whether Claimant has made an investment into Turkey directly or through a local company; pursuing how it raised that money is getting into a wild goose chase, which is neither required nor authorized by the BIT or the ECT.\n\n13.\n\nThis issue has already been addressed by previous tribunals and, more specifically in *Saipem S.p.A V. Bangaldesh**,* where the Tribunal stated the following:\n\n*(...) it is true that the host State may impose a requirement that an amount of capital in foreign currency be imported into the country. However, in the absence of such a requirement, investments made by foreign investors from local funds or from loans raised in the host State are treated in the same manner as investments funded with imported capital.* *In other words, the origin of the funds is irrelevant* (My underlining). *This results from the drafting history of the ICSID Convention and is confirmed by several arbitral decisions relating to BITs.11*\n\nICSID Case No. ARB/05/07, Decision on Jurisdiction and Recommendation on Provisional Measures (21 March 2007), paragraph 106. See also in that Decision several other Decisions and Awards cited in support.\n\n14.\n\nSimilarly, Prof. Schreuer has concluded:\n\n*It follows that the origin of the funds is irrelevant for the purposes of jurisdiction.* (My underlining). *Whether investments are made from imported capital, from profits made locally, from payments received locally or from loans makes no difference to the degree of protection enjoyed. The decisive criterion for the existence of a foreign investment is the nationality of the investor. There is no additional requirement of foreignness for the investment in terms of its origin. In the same way, the origin of capital from persons who are foreigners but do not enjoy protection under the Convention because they do not meet the nationality requirements is immaterial.\"12*\n\nChristoph H. Schreuer, *The ICSID Convention: A Commentary* (2nd Edition, Cambridge University Press, 2009, p.137).\n\n15.\n\nIn the present instance, it does not matter whether the equity investment into Claimant by [...] (through [...], a Virgin Islands holding company) was advanced or repaid by [X], The fact is that Claimant was a 50% shareholder in [the Second Project Company]; [X] did not hold a single share in Claimant or [the Second Project Company] and had no equity right whatever; all those rights belonged exclusively, on a 50% basis each, to Claimant and the other Sponsor.13\n\n[...]\n\n16.\n\nIt has been established that [...] (\"the Project Sponsors\"), two Turkish citizens, joined forces in December 1995 in relation to the Project. They established [the First Project Company] and they produced three interim feasibility studies in 1996 and a final one in February 1997, almost doubling the size of the Project. In March 1997, the Turkish Ministry [...] approved the final feasibility study.\n\n17.\n\nIt was only on 24 February 1997 that a letter of intent was signed with [...] and, on 8 July 1997, that a Joint Development Agreement (\"the JDA\") was signed with [...]. The nature of the arrangements between the parties is described in the Award.\n\n18.\n\nOn 27 October 1998, a Concession Contract was signed between [the First Project Company] and [Turkish Ministry], On 26 April 1999, Claimant14 was registered under the laws of the Netherlands and, on 27 March 2000, the Second Turkish Project Company15 was registered. On 30 March 2000, Claimant paid for and acquired a 50% share in [the Second Project Company] and, on the same day, the rights and obligations of [the First Project Company] were assigned to [the Second Project Company], At that moment, Claimant, through its shareholding in [the Second Project Company], became the 50% owner of what could legitimately be considered a very valuable Concession Contract which, if allowed to proceed, would have been a significant investment in Turkey, as recognized by the Government at least at the time it signed it. To argue that Claimant contributed nothing to Turkey (if this criterion were to be retained) is to ignore not only the payment by Claimant for its shares in [the Second Project Company] but also that it had thus become the halfowner of the Concession Contract which resulted from the initiatives previously undertaken by [...] and [the First Project Company], In fact and in law, it was indirectly substituted to [...] as far as his rights in the Project were concerned. Claimant thereby had valuable rights under the Concession Contract.\n\nAlapli Elektrik, B.V.\n\n[...]\n\n19.\n\nI have found nothing in the arrangements between either the Project Sponsors or Claimant and [X] which deprived Claimant of its status as an investor in Turkey under either the BIT or the ECT. The Project Sponsors recognizing that, even though they succeeded in obtaining a Concession Contract, they did not have the competence nor the funds to build the Project, wisely decided to join forces with an internationally recognized company in a position to provide them with all the required technical and financial support. There is nothing strange or incongruous in such arrangements; they are part of ordinary business life anywhere in the world.\n\n20.\n\n[X] saw an attractive business deal whereby it would be in a position of exclusivity to supply all the technical services and the equipment in connection with a large Turkish project without compromising itself by becoming a shareholder and appearing to compete with other similar projects in Turkey which might be willing to buy [X] products or use its consulting services.\n\n21.\n\nIn order to benefit from an exclusive arrangement, it was ready to advance the funds necessary to bring the Project to fruition, with the risk of losing its advances if the Project was not realized (except under the following circumstances: 1- a sale or other disposition of the Project; 2- [...] mandatory withdrawal pursuant to Articles 2.1.3 and 6 of the JDA; 3-successful arbitration against the [Turkish Ministry] pursuant to Article 3.2.3 of the Termination Protocol). In the case of success, [X] would be fully reimbursed for all the money advanced plus 10% interest per annum and would receive a US$ 1,000,000 success fee.\n\n22.\n\nBut, again, at no time did [X] become a shareholder in any of the entities controlled by the Project Sponsors. Claimant, not [X], would have been entitled to its share of the profits generated by the Project. [X]'s interest in the Project was of a totally different nature from that of an investor under the BIT or the ECT.\n\n23.\n\nI therefore disagree with Prof. Park's view that Claimant somehow acted only \"as a conduit\" for the [X]16 and that \"[X]'s interest was more akin to that of an investor than that of a lender\".17 In my view, [X]'s financial contribution to the Project had all the characteristics of a conditional loan. The conditions may appear to some as generous in favor of the debtor but this is the arrangement that was arrived at legally and freely between two groups of knowledgeable business people who each saw to the advancement of their interests in the transaction. I see nothing in the JDA (reimbursement of the advances plus 10% interest and a $1million success fee) which transforms that arrangement into an \"investment\" by [X].\n\nParagraphs 350, 367, 386.\n\nFootnote 37 of the Award.\n\n24.\n\nFrom the evidence submitted to the Tribunal, it is clear that, at all times, the Project Sponsors remained the full and exclusive owners of the various Turkish or foreign companies (including Claimant) they created in connection with the Project. Had the Project succeeded, it would have been the Sponsors (Claimant being in for 50%), not [X], which would have benefited from the return on equity.\n\n25.\n\nA related argument of Prof. Park which gives me concern is his statement regarding the contribution of Turkish actors.18 If it is recognized - as it should be - that contributions were made by the Turkish Project Sponsors, there is nothing either in the BIT or in the ECT prohibiting those persons from arranging their affairs in such a way as to be able to benefit from investment protection and international arbitration granted by such treaties.\n\n\"To the extent that contributions were made, they came from nationals or companies of the United States and Turkey\", Paragraph 350.\n\n26.\n\nReference was made, during the proceedings, to cases where jurisdiction was denied when the incorporation by a national of one Contracting Party of a company in the other Contracting Party was patently artificial, was not proven, or occurred after the facts giving rise to the dispute had arisen. In particular, each Party referred to *Mobil Corporation, Venezuela Holdings B.V. and ors. v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela**.19*\n\n*Mobil Corporation and others v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela,* ICSID Case No. ARB/07/27, Decision on Jurisdiction, 10 June 2010.\n\n27.\n\nI fully subscribe to the following paragraphs of that Decision which read as follows:\n\n*190. It thus appears to the Tribunal that the main, if not the sole purpose of the restructuring was to protect Mobil investments from adverse Venezuelan measures in getting access to ICSID arbitration through the Dutch-Venezuela BIT.*\n\n*191.*  *Such restructuring could be \"legitimate corporate planning\" as contended by the Claimants or an \"abuse of right\" as submitted by the Respondents. It depends upon the circumstances in which it happened. \"* (My underlining).\n\n(...)\n\n*204. As stated by Claimants, the aim of the restructuring of their investments in Venezuela through a Dutch holding was to protect those investments against breaches of their rights by the Venezuelan authorities by gaining access to ICSID arbitration through the BIT.*  *The Tribunal considers that this was a perfectly legitimate goal as far as it concerned future disputes.* (My underlining).\n\n*205. With respect to pre-existing disputes, the situation is different and the Tribunal considers that to restructure investments only in order to gain jurisdiction under a BIT for such disputes would constitute, to take the words of the Phoenix Tribunal, \"an abusive manipulation of the system of international investment protection under the ICSID Convention and the BITs. (...).\"*\n\n28.\n\nI will deal below with the *ratione temporis* issue; for the moment, I will concentrate on the abuse of process argument.\n\n29.\n\nProf. Park considers that there are three elements to the investment in this case.20 1- the Concession Contract; 2- technological expertise and 3- the statutory capital of [the Second Project Company], I have already addressed the last two elements. In connection with the first, Prof. Park argues that \"(...) Claimant has not demonstrated any contribution to obtaining this Concession. Claimant did not negotiate the terms. Claimant is not a signatory. Nor did Claimant become a party by virtue of assignment\"21 and earlier on22, he states that \"Claimant's ownership of the Second Project Company derives from [...], not a Dutch entity otherwise entitled to treaty provision.\"\n\nParagraph 363.\n\nParagraph 364.\n\nParagraph 351.\n\n30.\n\nIn my view, in order to qualify under the BIT or the ECT, Claimant did not need to contribute to obtaining the Concession Contract, did not need to negotiate its terms, did not need to sign it, did not need to become a formal party to it nor to go through some \"other Dutch entity otherwise entitled to treaty provision\". Claimant's ownership in [the Second Project Company] certainly derived from [...] and the assignment of rights and obligations made in favor of [the Second Project Company] by [the First Project Company] fully entitled Claimant, with its acquisition of a 50% equity in [the Second Project Company], to the rights that [...] or [the First Project Company] might have had in the Concession Contract; to use Prof. Park's words, \"Claimant would be stepping into the shoes of a Turkish national\".23 There is nothing illegitimate or contrary to the BIT or the ECT in that regard. As seen in the *PSEG* case24, a concession contract can represent an investment.\n\n*Id**.*\n\n*PSEG Global Inc. v. Konya Ilgin Eledtrik Uretim ve Ticaret Limited Sirekti v. Republic of Turkey,* ICSID Case No. ARB/02/4, Decision on Jurisdiction, 4 June 2004.\n\n31.\n\nThere is no doubt in my mind that Claimant was created pursuant to \"legitimate corporate planning\", as in the *Mobil* case.\n\n32.\n\nIn the present instance, the intention of the Turkish sponsors to create a foreign company was mentioned several years before the dispute arose and it was well known by the Turkish authorities who never raised the matter as an issue until after the initiation of the present arbitration. In November 1998, the Project Sponsors obtained opinions from [...] and [...] as to the advisability of such a step and it was pointed out to them that there would be advantages in proceeding in that direction, for tax purposes, for the attraction of foreign investors as well as for the purpose of international arbitration.\n\n33.\n\nClaimant was registered in April 1999 and acquired a 50% equity ownership in [the Second Project Company] on 30 March 2000.\n\n34.\n\nThe Tribunal was given sufficient evidence to conclude that Claimant was created in order to achieve the three purposes mentioned by its professional advisors.\n\n35.\n\nFirst, as to tax, why would the Project Sponsors have each bothered to create a Cura\u00e7ao holding company for any purpose other than tax planning? If their purpose had merely been to access international arbitration, they did not need the addition of that unnecessary legal intermediary. The direct creation of a Dutch company would have been amply sufficient. Prof. Stern says that \"it has transpired from the file that the tax benefits were quite minor\".25 Leaving aside the rather skimpy evidence received by the Tribunal in that respect, I see nothing in awards or in the doctrine requiring that, in order to qualify as legitimate under a BIT, the tax benefits of a legal structuring have to be substantial.\n\nParagraph 399.\n\n36.\n\nSecondly, it has also been established that the Project Sponsors were repeatedly told by their advisors that, if they wished to recruit foreign investors, they needed to create a company in a jurisdiction which would give the investors the protection available under a BIT and/ or the ECT. With the help of their financial advisor26 which had prepared documents in 1997 and 1998 concerning the eventual participation of foreign equity investors and lenders, the Project Sponsors received, from December 1998 to February 2001, expressions of interest from more than a dozen large financial and business institutions. They were advised that, in order to maximize the premium for entry into the Project, it would be preferable to bring an equity partner as late as possible and, preferably, after the conversion of the Concession Contract into an implementation contract.27 In December 2000, [...] were instructed to draft a sale and purchase agreement and a shareholders agreement.\n\n, appointed in 1997.\n\nSecond W.S. of [...], Paragraph 15.\n\n37.\n\nThirdly, taking into account the nature and size of the project, it was quite natural that the Project Sponsors would have wished to have access to international arbitration through the creation of an appropriate foreign company. This matter has already been discussed above. I would merely repeat, in line with the *Mobil* Decision, that, even if the sole purpose of the legal structuring had been to gain access to international arbitration, this would not render such operation *per se* illegal.\n\n38.\n\nFinally, Prof. Park seems to attach some importance28 to the statement made by [...], during his cross-examination at the Tribunal hearing, that Claimant ended up never paying out any money in connection with the Project. [...] is a businessman without any legal training; I respectfully submit that he is not an authoritative source to determine whether Claimant qualifies as an investor under the BIT and/ or the ECT.\n\nParagraphs 388 and 389\n\n**C- Jurisdiction *ratione temporis***\n--------------------------------------\n\n39.\n\nThe next issue to be addressed is the one of jurisdiction *ratione temporis,* which appears to be the main point upon which Prof. Stern bases her conclusion that the Tribunal has no jurisdiction in this case. My disagreement with her is not so much with her interpretation of the law in that regard but with her interpretation of the facts.\n\n40.\n\nHer view is that \"the main purpose\" of the creation of Claimant was \"to gain access to ICSID arbitration at a time when there were already important disagreements between the Turkish company and the Turkish authorities, the precise disagreements that are at the core of the present claim of Claimant\".29 I beg to differ.\n\nParagraph 390.\n\n41.\n\nI have no quarrel with her references to *Mobil* (which I have already commented upon) or to *Phoenix**.30* I also agree with her that, to quote *Phoenix**,* \"once the acts which the investor considers are causing damages to its investment have already been committed\", the investor cannot re-arrange its affairs so to claim the benefits of investment protection under a BIT or the ECT.\n\nParagraphs 391 and 392. *Phoenix Action, Ltd. v. The Czech Republic,* ICSID Case No. ARB/06/5, Award, 15 April 2009, Paragraphs 94 and 95.\n\n42.\n\nI also agree that there is a dividing line between good faith and bad faith restructuring. However, I have serious concerns about reaching a negative conclusion about a restructuring, on the basis of an investor \"seeing a dispute looming with his own government\"31 or when \"the investor is aware that events have occurred that negatively affect its investment and may lead to arbitration\".32 Large development projects, whether a State is a party or not, regularly give rise to disagreements between the parties. Entrepreneurs are constantly sailing in a fog of \"looming disputes\".\n\nParagraph 311.\n\nParagraph 403.\n\n43.\n\nProf. Stern is right to state that \"(t)he dividing line occurs when the relevant party can see an actual dispute or can foresee a specific future dispute as a high probability and not merely a general future controversy\"33 but I would add that one is not talking here about any dispute but about the one which is specifically the subject of a claim under an investment treaty.\n\n*Id**.*\n\n44.\n\nIn my view, the present case is very far from even approaching that famous dividing line and my conviction in that regard rests on two factors: 1- the restructuring in question had been planned for a long time, justified on three grounds and was finalized for valid reasons at the time it took place; 2- the events which are the basis of Claimant's claim are events which took place after the corporate creation of Claimant and after [the Second Project Company] (and thus Claimant) acquired rights in the Project.\n\n45.\n\nI have already addressed the first factor above and there is no need to repeat my views in that regard. However, taking into account the detailed analysis and interpretation of the facts made by Prof. Stern, I believe I should at least stress some of the points where I am parting ways with her.\n\n46.\n\nShe seems to attach importance to a Confidential Briefing Memorial prepared by [X], at the beginning of May 2000, which indicated that the shareholding structure would be finalized once one or more major international developers would enter into the project and that suddenly later in May, the strategy was changed and the restructuring took place, with the sole participation of the two Turkish sponsors. I do not see how the decision to proceed at the end of March 2000 with the acquisition by Claimant of a 50% share in [the Second Project Company] somehow jeopardized the finalization of the shareholding structure; it remained quite possible to make further adjustments to that structure once international partners were ready to invest into the Project.\n\n47.\n\nProf. Stern also seems to attach significance to the fact that it was only upon discovery during the arbitration process that it came out that the two Turkish sponsors were the only \"investors\" implicated at that time. I fail to see how such a fact has any relevance to the question as to whether the creation of the Claimant was done in good faith or was abusive of the BIT or the ECT process.\n\n48.\n\nAs to the second factor, Respondent, in its pleadings, referred to \"threats and risks\"34 faced by [the Second Project Company] by March 2000 and to the possibility of \"difficulties, delays, uncertainties, and likely tariff reductions.35 Apart from the issue of tariff reduction which I will address below, such general statements cannot constitute the basis for a jurisdictional challenge about abuse of process.\n\nTr., 2306:8-9.\n\nTr., 2314:22. 2315:1.\n\n49.\n\nHowever, Respondent makes more specific allegations in that regard36 which are retained by Prof. Stern in her analysis37 to the effect that [...] confirmed during the hearing that, before March 27 March 2000, he was aware that Law 4501 would involve: (i) negotiating a new contract; (ii) renegotiating the tariff; (iii) agreeing to complete the project by the end of 2002.\n\nTr. 417:21-22; 418:1-2; 408-21-409:03; 437:20-440:8.\n\nPara. 415.\n\n50.\n\nBefore dealing with the main issue relating to these allegations, a few preliminary comments on each of them appears necessary.\n\n51.\n\nAs to the fact that a new contract would have to be negotiated to go from a Concession Contract to an implementation contract, this was not, before 30 March 2000, a matter which was the subject of any dispute. Law 4501 had been enacted in January 2000 by Respondent to further encourage foreign investment, by giving the choice to investors to use private implementation contracts rather than concession contracts; [...] (through [...], the First Project Company) made a deliberate decision in February 2000 to opt for the route of an implementation contract, a choice which was approved by Respondent's Council of Ministers on 8 September of that year. Far from being seen as a matter of dispute, that choice was seen as a potential improvement of the Sponsors' situation compared to the arrangement under the 1998 Concession Contract.\n\n52.\n\nAs to the renegotiation of the tariff, [the First Project Company] was aware, by the end of March 2000, that Respondent would request a reduction of the electricity tariff contained in the Energy Sales Agreement of 1999 between [...] and [the First Project Company], in order to take into account the financial benefit to the Project Company which would result from the conversion of the Concession Contract into a private law contract, under the provisions of Law No. 4501. In June 2000, the [Turkish Ministry] gave the Project Company 48 hours to accede to its demand for a 15% reduction of the non-fuel elements of the tariff that had been agreed in the Concession Contract. In order to proceed with the Project, the Project Company accepted the revised terms imposed upon it. In fact, it had received advice on 28 March 2000 from [X] that, in the new environment of a private contract, the Project could readily sustain a reduction in the electricity tariff. However, what is not mentioned in the Award is that, in July 2000, the [Turkish Ministry] issued new demands for further reductions, without which, it said, it would not forward the Project to the Council of Ministers for approval as a private law contract.38\n\n[...], Exh. C-61.\n\n53.\n\nAs to the deadline of the Project, it is not contested that [the First Project Company] was aware, before the entry on the scene of Claimant, that the Turkish authorities would insist on its completion by the end of December 2002 (a deadline which was already in the Concession Contract in any event). In fact, [the Second Project Company] (supported by [X]) confirmed, on 27 June 2000, that, with a prompt resolution by Respondent of the outstanding issues, it could finalize the power plant by the end of 2002.\n\n54.\n\nBut the essential element to retain on this subject is that the Claimant's claim is not based on the necessity to negotiate a new contract, or on the first request to amend the electricity tariff or on the obligation to complete the Project by the end of 2002 but on Respondent's decisions (or lack of them) subsequently to 30 March 2000 which made it impossible to complete the Project. I am of the firm opinion that Claimant had no reason at that time to believe that Respondent would adopt what Claimant considers as dilatory tactics and steps that would derail not only the Project, but also the 28 other BOT projects which had been prioritized under Law No. 4501 on 30 May 2000 and were declared eligible to Treasury guarantees provided they were completed by the end of December 2002 (in fact, not a single one of them ended up being able to achieve conversion under Law 4501 or received a Treasury guarantee; Respondent argues however that more than one-third of those companies completed their projects instead through the conditions created by Law 4628).\n\n55.\n\nAccording to Claimant, the following events (all subsequent to 30 March 2000) are the components of the dispute and constitute alleged breaches of the BIT and the ECT:\n\n1) The [Turkish Ministry] failed to implement the Council of Minister's decree of 8 September 2000 and arbitrarily refused to convert the Concession Contract into a private law implementation contract.\n\n2) Respondent unilaterally abrogated the Project Company's right to the Treasury guarantee.\n\n3) Respondent sought unilaterally to revoke the \"take-or-pay\" obligation, contained in the Concession Contract and the Energy Sales Agreement.\n\n4) Respondent liquidated the [...].\n\n56.\n\nAll these allegations would have to be proven at the merits stage but Claimant produced evidence to the effect that:\n\n1) In a letter of 21 June 2000, the [Turkish Ministry] unilaterally stipulated that, if the Project Company did not commission the plant by the end of 2002, it would lose its right to the power purchase guarantee (i.e. the \"take-or-pay\" obligation).\n\n2) In late July 2000, a second demand for tariff reduction was made by the [Turkish Ministry] under the threat of blocking the conversion of the Concession Contract into an implementation contract. Such demand was repeated at meetings held on 20-21 December 2000 and on 12 January 2001.\n\n3) On 16 January 2001, Respondent announced that, unless the Project (and the other 28 retained) was completed by the end of 2002, no Treasury guarantee would be available.\n\n4) On 3 March 2001, Law No. 4628 was enacted which confirmed the announcement of 16 January 2001. That law was subsequently declared unconstitutional by Respondent's Constitutional Court in a decision rendered in February 2002.\n\n5) Then, on 9 May 2001, a letter was sent by the Treasury Under secretariat to the [Turkish Ministry] stating that Respondent would be in a situation of excess energy capacity from 2003-2005 and that, after the two-year transition period under Law No. 4628, [...] should pay only for the actual energy purchased by [...]. The same letter indicated that Respondent had taken the decision to liquidate by the end of 2001 the [...] which was committed to enter into the Fund Agreement with the Project Company pursuant to the Concession Agreement.\n\n6) On 24 October 2001, at a meeting chaired by [...] to evaluate the situation regarding the 29 retained BOT projects, it was repeated that Treasury guarantees would only be available for projects which started operation by the end of 2002 but it was also announced that such guarantees would only cover [...] payment obligation under ESAs for ten years and that thereafter only energy actually purchased would be guaranteed. Moreover, it was announced that [...] obligation to purchase electricity would in every case terminate in 2012. Those decisions were confirmed in a letter of 27 December 2001 which the [Turkish Ministry] sent to the Project Company: the Project had to be commissioned by the end of 2002; a Treasury guarantee would be provided only for the first ten years of the Contract and the \"take or pay\" obligation by [...] would end in 2012 at the latest.\n\n57.\n\nThe important point at this stage of the proceedings is that none of the allegations of breaches of the BIT and ECT provisions relate to events which occurred before 30 March 2000. In my view, there was no way that Claimant could have reasonably anticipated, on or before 30 March 2000, such a turn of events. It has been shown that, during 2000-2001, Respondent suffered a severe financial crisis which forced it to call on the IMF and the World Bank for assistance. Those institutions recommended a number of amendments to some of Respondent's policies, including abandoning resort to BOTS and the use of Treasury guarantees to support such projects. But no evidence has been adduced to show that, before the end of March 2000, Claimant or anybody else outside government officials was made aware of the eventuality of drastic measures like those which were subsequently taken.\n\n58.\n\nIf Claimant had concerns in that regard in March 2000, they would at best have been of a general nature and the resort to the assignment to Claimant of 50% of the Project Company's right in the Concession Contract would have been, like stated in paragraph 204 of the *Mobil* Decision quoted above, \"a perfectly legitimate goal as far as it concerned future disputes.\" It was, in fact, the wise and proper thing to do.\n\n59.\n\nI therefore conclude that the Tribunal has jurisdiction, under both the BIT and ECT, to hear the dispute between Claimant and Respondent concerning all events arising after 30 March 2000, the date of the acquisition of 50% of the shares of [the Second Project Company] by Claimant.\n\n60.\n\nIn light of the Majority decision reached by the Tribunal, there is no point in proceeding to discuss the other jurisdictional objections raised by Respondent or the merits issues."}], "Content": "Award\n-----\n\n**I. Introduction**\n-------------------\n\n1.\n\nThis case concerns a dispute submitted to the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (\"ICSID\" or the \"Centre\") pursuant to the terms of the Energy Charter Treaty (\"ECT\"), the Agreement on Reciprocal Encouragement and Protection of Investments between the Kingdom of the Netherlands and the Republic of Turkey of 27 March 1986 (the \"Netherlands-Turkey BIT\") (together, sometimes referred to as the \"Treaties\"), and the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States (\"ICSID Convention\").\n\n2.\n\nThe dispute concerns an alleged investment by a Dutch company in a power project in Turkey, which was purportedly made in reliance upon governmental assurances and legislation intended to attract international investment. The Dutch company asserts that the Republic of Turkey undermined the project by conduct that contradicted its assurances and by making several adverse legislative changes. As a result, it claims that the Republic of Turkey violated the investment protections provisions of the ECT and the Netherlands-Turkey BIT.\n\n3.\n\nThe claimant, Alapli Elektrik B.V., is a company incorporated under the laws of the Netherlands (\"Alapli Elektrik\" or \"Claimant\"). It is represented by Messrs. Robert Volterra and Stephen Fietta of the law firm of Volterra Fietta, and Ms. Aimee-Jane Lee, Mr. Charles Claypoole, Ms. Catriona Paterson, and Mr. Sebastian Seelmann-Eggebert of the law firm Latham & Watkins (of which Messrs. Volterra and Fietta were previously partners).\n\n4.\n\nThe respondent is the Republic of Turkey (the \"Republic of Turkey,\" \"Turkey\" or \"Respondent\"), represented by Mr. Stanimir Alexandrov, Ms. Marinn Carlsson and Ms. Jennifer Haworth McCandless of the law firm of Sidley Austin LLP. Mr. Daniel M. Price of the same firm represented the Respondent until 30 June 2011.\n\n5.\n\nClaimant and Respondent shall be referred to collectively as the \"Parties.\"\n\n**II. Procedural History**\n--------------------------\n\n6.\n\nOn 16 July 2008, Alapli Elektrik filed a Request for Arbitration against the Republic of Turkey (the \"Request\"), which was registered by the Acting Secretary-General of ICSID on 27 August 2008 pursuant to Article 36(3) of the ICSID Convention.\n\n7.\n\nThe notice of registration invited the Parties to communicate to ICSID any provisions agreed by them regarding the number of arbitrators and the method of their appointment. By letter of 26 September 2008, the Parties informed the Centre that they had reached an agreement on the method, according to which the Tribunal was to consist of three arbitrators, one appointed by each Party within a certain time limit, and the presiding arbitrator (sometimes referred to as the \"President\") was to be appointed by agreement of the Parties. If the Parties were unable to reach an agreement on the President by 30 December 2008, either Party could request that the Chairman of the Administrative Council of ICSID appoint the President pursuant to Article 38 of the ICSID Convention.\n\n8.\n\nOn 31 October 2008, Claimant appointed The Honorable Marc Lalonde, PC, OC, QC, a national of Canada. On 4 December 2008, Respondent appointed Professor Brigitte Stem, a national of France. The Parties failed to reach an agreement on the President of the Tribunal by 30 December 2008; therefore, by letter dated 5 January 2009, Claimant requested that the Chairman of the Administrative Council of ICSID appoint the presiding arbitrator under the default mies.\n\n9.\n\nAfter consultations with the Parties, on 27 February 2009, the Chairman appointed Professor William W. Park, a U.S. national, as the President of the Tribunal. The Tribunal was thus constituted and the proceedings began on 2 March 2009, pursuant to Rule 6(1) of the ICSID Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings of April 10, 2006 (the \"Arbitration Rules\"). Ms. Martina Polasek, Senior Counsel, ICSID, was designated as the Tribunal\u2019s Secretary.\n\n10.\n\nOn 18 May 2009, the Tribunal held its first session with the Parties in Paris. Among other matters, it was agreed that the proceeding would be conducted in accordance with the Arbitration Rules. Because the Parties were unable to reach an agreement on the procedural calendar, the Tribunal ordered that Claimant file a memorial on the merits by 25 September 2009 (the \"Claimant\u2019s Memorial\") and that Respondent indicate by 30 October 2009 whether it intended to raise any objections to jurisdiction and to request bifurcation of the proceedings.\n\n11.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Memorial was filed on 26 September 2009 and was accompanied by [...].\n\n12.\n\nOn 2 October 2009, Respondent filed a request for the production of documents concerning Claimant\u2019s Memorial, relating to issues of jurisdiction. On 9 October 2009, at the invitation of the Tribunal, Claimant filed a Redfern Schedule with observations on and objections to Respondent\u2019s request. On 21 October 2009, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 1 granting one of Respondent\u2019s requests for production. Upon Claimant\u2019s request, Respondent subsequently undertook to hold confidential all documents produced by Claimant pursuant to the Tribunal\u2019s order.\n\n13.\n\nBy letter of 30 October 2009, Respondent declared that it intended to raise jurisdictional objections and to move for bifurcation of the proceedings. The Tribunal was requested to address the objections as a preliminary matter and suspend the proceedings on the merits. Following Claimant\u2019s observations on Respondent\u2019s requests, the Tribunal directed Respondent to submit all jurisdictional objections that it intended to raise by 24 November 2009.\n\n14.\n\nAfter a series of exchanges with respect to Respondent\u2019s request for bifurcation of the proceedings, on 3 December 2009, the Tribunal instructed Respondent to file, in accordance with Arbitration Rule 41, any and all jurisdictional objections with its Counter-Memorial on the Merits. It further directed the Parties to confer on the date for further written pleadings.\n\n15.\n\nAs the Parties were unable to agree on filing dates, by Order of 23 December 2009; the Tribunal established a schedule for written pleadings. This schedule was amended by Order of 30 December 2009 following a request made by Respondent and after due consideration of Claimant\u2019s objections.\n\n16.\n\nOn 12 January 2010, Respondent filed a second request for production of documents. After observations filed by the Parties, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 2 dated 21 January 2010 with directions as to the procedure concerning Respondent\u2019s second request for document production. By Order of 16 February 2010, the Tribunal granted certain of Respondent\u2019s requests.\n\n17.\n\nOn 15 March 2010, Respondent filed its Memorial on Jurisdiction and Counter-Memorial on the Merits, including its request for bifurcation of the proceedings. The Counter-Memorial was accompanied by [...].\n\n18.\n\nBy letter dated 22 March 2010, Claimant commented on Respondent\u2019s request for bifurcation.\n\n19.\n\nHaving considered the Parties\u2019 submissions, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 3 of 23 April 2010, declining to bifurcate the proceedings.\n\n20.\n\nOn 13 May 2010, the Parties jointly requested to modify the procedural calendar by an extension of 90 days to file their respective pleadings. The Tribunal approved the request by Procedural Order No. 4 dated 19 May 2010.\n\n21.\n\nOn 28 May 2010, Claimant filed its first request for production of documents in the form of a Redfern Schedule. On 8 June 2010, Respondent filed its observations on the request, objecting to most requests for production. The Tribunal addressed the request in Procedural Order No. 5 of 1 July 2010, partly granting Claimant\u2019s request.\n\n22.\n\nOn 23 July 2010, Claimant filed a Reply on the Merits and a Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, accompanied by four witness statements and five expert reports.\n\n23.\n\nOn 8 September 2010, Respondent filed a third request for production of documents. Having received Claimant\u2019s observations, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 6 dated 7 October 2010, partly granting Respondent\u2019s request.\n\n24.\n\nBy letter dated 13 October 2010, following a disagreement by the Parties, the Tribunal ruled on the procedural calendar for the remainder of the written pleadings. In accordance with the Tribunal\u2019s directions, Respondent submitted its Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction and Rejoinder on the Merits on 28 October 2010.1 The submission was accompanied by five witness statements, two legal opinions and two expert reports.\n\nThe Tribunal has maintained the citation to the Respondent\u2019s filing of 28 October 2010 in its original form, \"Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction and Rejoinder on the Merits,\", even though a more conventional format might have described the filing as a \"Reply\" (rather than \"Counter-Memorial\") on Jurisdiction.\n\n25.\n\nOn 12 November 2010, Claimant filed its second request for production of documents. Having received Respondent\u2019s observations and a further response from Claimant, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 7 of 26 November 2010 granting certain of Claimant\u2019s requests and noting Respondent\u2019s agreement to produce certain documents.\n\n26.\n\nFurther to the Tribunal\u2019s directions of 13 October 2010, Claimant filed its Rejoinder on Jurisdiction on 13 December 2010, together with two further expert reports.\n\n27.\n\nOn 6 January 2011, the Tribunal held a pre-hearing conference with the Parties, discussing an agreed Protocol of the Parties on Procedures for the Hearing on Jurisdiction and the Merits. The hearing was subsequently held from 31 January 2011 to 10 February 2011 in Paris. The Tribunal heard the Parties\u2019 witnesses and experts as well as their opening and closing arguments. Verbatim transcripts and audio recordings were made of the hearing and subsequently transmitted to the Parties. At the end of the hearing, the Tribunal directed the Parties to file Post-Hearing Briefs and Statements of Costs within certain time limits.\n\n28.\n\nPursuant to the Tribunal\u2019s directions, the Parties each filed a Post-Hearing Brief on 20 April 2011.\n\n29.\n\nOn 27 April 2011, Claimant filed a revised Post-Hearing Brief for \"formatting corrections and deletions.\"\n\n30.\n\nEach Party filed its Statement of Costs on 6 June 2011.\n\n31.\n\nOn 8 August 2011, as a result of the Tribunal\u2019s deliberations, the Tribunal addressed a number of questions to the Parties. The Parties responded to the Tribunal\u2019s questions by submissions dated 26 August 2011.\n\n32.\n\nOn 2 September 2011, Claimant filed an application to submit new documentary evidence to address a matter arising from Respondent\u2019s answers of 26 August 2011. The Tribunal granted Claimant\u2019s application and allowed Respondent to comment on the new documents.\n\n33.\n\nOn 11 November 2011, Claimant submitted a Revised Statement of Costs, providing updated cost figures and noting the fees incurred in relation to preparation of its response to the Tribunal\u2019s post-hearing questions and submissions in connection with new evidence.\n\n34.\n\nOn 5 June 2012, the proceedings were closed in accordance with Arbitration Rule 38(1).\n\n**III.

Tribunal\u2019s Analysis on Jurisdiction**\n--------------------------------------------\n\n**A. Introduction**\n-------------------\n\n311.\n\nA Turkish national, backed by an American multinational, seeing a dispute looming with his own government, established a Dutch entity which is claiming treaty protection for a proposed combined cycle power plant. The entirety of the financial contribution and technological know-how came from American backers, [X], which advanced monies to realize an opportunity to provide equipment and services, taking all risk of loss if the Project never came to fruition.30 The Concession Contract, by which the host country agreed in principle to the Project\u2019s terms, was awarded to a Turkish company, [the First Project Company].\n\nIn the event of successful conclusion, [X] would receive the money invested plus 10% interest per annum and US$ 1,000,000, over and above the profit from sale of equipment and provision of engineering services.\n\n312.\n\nAfter careful consideration of all arguments and evidence, Arbitrators Stern and Park (the \"Majority\") conclude that this Tribunal lacks jurisdiction to hear the dispute pursuant to the ECT and the Netherlands-Turkey BIT.\n\n313.\n\nThe Majority has considered the two lines of reasoning set forth below. Although Arbitrator Stern and Arbitrator Park do not necessarily assign the same weight to the various components in these overlapping lines of reasoning, both members conclude that jurisdiction is clearly absent.\n\n**B. Scope of Tribunal\u2019s Decision**\n-----------------------------------\n\n314.\n\nArticle 41 of the ICSID Convention directs the Tribunal to determine its own jurisdiction. In this connection, the Tribunal has considered the ICSID Convention itself, along with provisions of the Netherlands-Turkey BIT and the Energy Charter Treaty.\n\n315.\n\nThe Majority has found Claimant not entitled to protection under either the Energy Charter Treaty or the Netherlands-Turkey BIT. For Arbitrator Stern this conclusion derives from notions of timing and *bona fides,* considering that Claimant did not make an investment until after the root of the controversy was evident and the dispute itself had become a high probability. For Arbitrator Park, the Claimant simply lacks the status of an investor, for want of any contribution to the [... ] Project.\n\n316.\n\nThe Majority notes that it has addressed all essential points necessary to sustain Respondent\u2019s objection to jurisdiction. In passing, the Majority acknowledges that Respondent made multiple objections to jurisdiction that did not need to be reached in order to sustain the Majority\u2019s conclusion.\n\n317.\n\nThese questions included *inter alia* the following: (i) whether the dispute existed before the investment was made (addressed by Arbitrator Stern alone), (ii) whether ICSID Convention Article 25(4) limited Turkey\u2019s consent to cases where investment has \"effectively started\" and, if so, whether the investment in this case had met that standard; (iii) whether the ECT had taken effect when the dispute arose; (iv) whether Claimant\u2019s non-expropriation claims are barred under the ECT because measures were necessary to maintain \"public order\" (a matter which goes more to the merits); and (v) whether Claimant\u2019s claims are barred by ECT Article 26(3)(b), a \"fork-in-the-road\" provision that allows States to exclude from their consent disputes that have already been submitted to domestic courts.\n\n318.\n\nThe Majority remains cognizant of ICSID Convention Article 48(3), which provides that the award \"shall deal with every question submitted\" to the Tribunal.\n\n319.\n\nHaving given Claimant every benefit of the doubt on all objections related to jurisdiction, the Majority finds that it lacks competence over this dispute for the reasons summarized above and explored more fully below. Consequently, it becomes unnecessary for the Majority to speculate on matters not pertinent to its conclusion.\n\n**C. Applicable Treaties and Principles of Interpretation**\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n**1. Key Treaty Provisions**\n----------------------------\n\n320.\n\nThe Netherlands-Turkey BIT and the ECT provide the operative provisions under which the claims have been made.\n\n321.\n\nClaimant asserts that: (i) Turkey deprived Claimant of its investment in violation of Article 5 of the Netherlands-Turkey BIT and Article 13 of the ECT; (ii) Turkey failed to accord fair and equitable treatment in violation of Article 3(1) of the Netherlands-Turkey BIT and Article 10(1) of the ECT; (iii) Turkey failed to provide full protection and security in violation of Article 3(2) of the Netherlands-Turkey BIT and Article 10(1) of the ECT; and (iv) Turkey failed to observe the obligations it concluded in respect of Claimant\u2019s investment in violation of the \"umbrella clauses\" in Article 3(2) of the Netherlands-Turkey BIT and Article 10(1) of the ECT.\n\n**a) The ECT**\n--------------\n\n322.\n\nUnder Article 1(6) of the ECT, \"Investment\" means:\n\n\"every kind of asset, owned or controlled directly or indirectly by an Investor and includes:\n\n(a) tangible and intangible, and movable and immovable, property, and any property rights such as leases, mortgages, liens, and pledges;\n\n(b) a company or business enterprise, or shares, stock, or other forms of equity participation in a company or business enterprise, and bonds and other debt of a company or business enterprise;\n\n(c) claims to money and claims to performance pursuant to contract having an economic value and associated with an Investment;\n\n(d) Intellectual Property;\n\n(e) Returns;\n\n(f) any right conferred by law or contract or by virtue of any licenses and permits granted pursuant to law to undertake any Economic Activity in the Energy Sector.\n\nA change in the form in which assets are invested does not affect their character as investments and the term \"Investment\" includes all investments, whether existing at or made after the later of the date of entry into force of this Treaty for the Contracting Party of the Investor making the investment and that for the Contracting Party in the Area of which the investment is made (hereinafter referred to as the Effective Date\") provided that the Treaty shall only apply to matters affecting such investments after the Effective Date.\n\n\"Investment\" refers to any investment associated with an Economic Activity in the Energy Sector and to investments or classes of investments designated by a Contracting Party in its Area as \"Charter efficiency projects\" and so notified to the Secretariat.\"\n\n323.\n\nUnder Article 1(7) of the ECT, \"Investor\" means:\n\n(a) with respect to a Contracting Party:\n\n(i) a natural person having the citizenship or nationality of or who is permanently residing in that Contracting Party in accordance with its applicable law;\n\n(ii) a company or other organization organized in accordance with the law applicable in that Contracting Party;\n\n(b) with respect to a \"third state,\" a natural person, company or other organization which fulfils, *mutatis mutandis,* the conditions specified in subparagraph (a) for a Contracting Party.\n\n324.\n\nArticle 10 of the ECT provides:\n\n(1) Each Contracting Party shall, in accordance with the provisions of this Treaty, encourage and create stable, equitable, favourable and transparent conditions for Investors of other Contracting Parties to make Investments in its Area. Such conditions shall include a commitment to accord at all times to Investments of Investors of other Contracting Parties fair and equitable treatment. Such Investments shall also enjoy the most constant protection and security and no Contracting Party shall in any way impair by unreasonable or discriminatory measures their management, maintenance, use, enjoyment or disposal. In no case shall such Investments be accorded treatment less favourable than that required by international law, including treaty obligations. Each Contracting Party shall observe any obligations it has entered into with an Investor or an Investment of an Investor of any other Contracting Party.\n\n(2) Each Contracting Party shall endeavour to accord to Investors of other Contracting Parties, as regards the Making of Investments in its Area, the Treatment described in paragraph (3).\n\n(3) For the purposes of this Article, \"Treatment\" means treatment accorded by a Contracting Party which is no less favourable than that which it accords to its own Investors or to Investors of any other Contracting Party or any third state, whichever is the most favourable.\n\n325.\n\nArticle 13 of the ECT provides:\n\n(1) Investments of Investors of a Contracting Party in the Area of any other Contracting Party shall not be nationalized, expropriated or subjected to a measure or measures having effect equivalent to nationalization or expropriation (hereinafter referred to as \"Expropriation\") except where such Expropriation is:\n\n(a) for a purpose which is in the public interest;\n\n(b) not discriminatory;\n\n(c) carried out under due process of law; and\n\n(d) accompanied by the payment of prompt, adequate and effective compensation. Such compensation shall amount to the fair market value of the Investment expropriated at the time immediately before the Expropriation or impending Expropriation became known in such a way as to affect the value of the Investment (hereinafter referred to as the \"Valuation Date\"). Such fair market value shall at the request of the Investor be expressed in a Freely Convertible Currency on the basis of the market rate of exchange existing for that currency on the Valuation Date. Compensation shall also include interest at a commercial rate established on a market basis from the date of Expropriation until the date of payment.\n\n326.\n\nArticle 17 of the ECT provides that each Contracting Party reserves the right to deny the advantages of [Part III] to:\n\n(1) a legal entity if citizens or nationals of a third state own or control such entity and if that entity has no substantial business activities in the Area of the Contracting Party in which it is organized;\n\n327.\n\nArticle 26 of the ECT provides:\n\n(1) Disputes between a Contracting Party and an Investor of another Contracting Party relating to an Investment of the latter in the Area of the former, which concern an alleged breach of an obligation of the former under Part III shall, if possible, be settled amicably.\n\n(2) If such disputes cannot be settled according to the provisions of paragraph (1) within a period of three months from the date on which either party to the dispute requested amicable settlement, the Investor party to the dispute may choose to submit it for resolution:\n\n(a) to the courts or administrative tribunals of the Contracting Party party to the dispute;\n\n(b) in accordance with any applicable, previously agreed dispute settlement procedure; or\n\n(c) in accordance with the following paragraphs of this Article.\n\n(3) (a) Subject only to subparagraphs (b) and (c), each Contracting Party hereby gives its unconditional consent to the submission of a dispute to international arbitration or conciliation in accordance with the provisions of this Article.\n\n(b) (i) The Contracting Parties listed in Annex ID do not give such unconditional consent where the Investor has previously submitted the dispute under subparagraph (2)(a) or (b).\n\n(ii) For the sake of transparency, each Contracting Party that is listed in Annex ID shall provide a written statement of its policies, practices and conditions in this regard to the Secretariat no later than the date of the deposit of its instrument of ratification, acceptance or approval in accordance with Article 39 or the deposit of its instrument of accession in accordance with Article 41.\n\n(c) A Contracting Party listed in Annex IA does not give such unconditional consent with respect to a dispute arising under the last sentence of Article 10(1).\n\n(4) In the event that an Investor chooses to submit the dispute for resolution under subparagraph (2)(c), the Investor shall further provide its consent in writing for the dispute to be submitted to:\n\n(a) (i) The International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes, established pursuant to the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of other States opened for signature at Washington, 18 March 1965 (hereinafter referred to as the \"ICSID Convention\"), if the Contracting Party of the Investor and the Contracting Party party to the dispute are both parties to the ICSID Convention; or\n\n(ii) The International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes, established pursuant to the Convention referred to in subparagraph (a)(i), under the rules governing the Additional Facility for the Administration of Proceedings by the Secretariat of the Centre (hereinafter referred to as the \"Additional Facility Rules\"), if the Contracting Party of the Investor or the Contracting Party party to the dispute, but not both, is a party to the ICSID Convention;\n\n(b) a sole arbitrator or ad hoc arbitration tribunal established under the Arbitration Rules of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (hereinafter referred to as \"UNCITRAL\"); or\n\n(c) an arbitral proceeding under the Arbitration Institute of the Stockholm Chamber of Commerce.\n\n(5) (a) The consent given in paragraph (3) together with the written consent of the Investor given pursuant to paragraph (4) shall be considered to satisfy the requirement for:\n\n(i) written consent of the parties to a dispute for purposes of Chapter II of the ICSID Convention and for purposes of the Additional Facility Rules;\n\n(ii) an \"agreement in writing\" for purposes of article II of the United Nations Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards, done at New York, 10 June 1958 (hereinafter referred to as the \"New York Convention\"); and\n\n(iii) \"the parties to a contract [to] have agreed in writing\" for the purposes of article 1 of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules.\n\n(b) Any arbitration under this Article shall at the request of any party to the dispute be held in a state that is a party to the New York Convention. Claims submitted to arbitration hereunder shall be considered to arise out of a commercial relationship or transaction for the purposes of article I of that Convention.\n\n(6) A tribunal established under paragraph (4) shall decide the issues in dispute in accordance with this Treaty and applicable rules and principles of international law.\n\n(7) An Investor other than a natural person which has the nationality of a Contracting Party party to the dispute on the date of the consent in writing referred to in paragraph (4) and which, before a dispute between it and that Contracting Party arises, is controlled by Investors of another Contracting Party, shall for the purpose of article 25(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention be treated as a \"national of another Contracting State\" and shall for the purpose of article 1(6) of the Additional Facility Rules be treated as a \"national of another State\".\n\n(8) The awards of arbitration, which may include an award of interest, shall be final and binding upon the parties to the dispute. An award of arbitration concerning a measure of a sub-national government or authority of the disputing Contracting Party shall provide that the Contracting Party may pay monetary damages in lieu of any other remedy granted. Each Contracting Party shall carry out without delay any such award and shall make provision for the effective enforcement in its Area of such awards.\n\n**b) The Netherlands-Turkey BIT**\n---------------------------------\n\n328.\n\nUnder Article 1(b) of the Netherlands-Turkey BIT, \"Investment\" means:\n\nevery kind of asset such as equity, debt, claims and service and investment contracts and includes:\n\ni. tangible and intangible property, including rights such as mortgages, hens and pledges;\n\nii. shares of stock or other interests in a company or interests in the assets thereof;\n\niii. a claim to money or a claim to performance having economic value and associated with an investment;\n\niv. industrial property rights, including rights with respect to patents, trademark, trade names, industrial designs and know-how and goodwill and copyrights;\n\nv. any right conferred by law or contract, and any licences [*sic*] and permits pursuant to law.\n\n329.\n\nUnder Article 1(a) of the Netherlands-Turkey BIT, \"Investor\" means:\n\ni. a natural person who is a national of a Contracting Party under its applicable law;\n\nii. a legal person duly incorporated, constituted or otherwise duly organized under the applicable laws and regulations of a Contracting Party;\n\n330.\n\nArticle 3 of the Netherlands-Turkey BIT provides:\n\n(1) Each Contracting Party shall ensure fair and equitable treatment to the investments of investors of the other Contracting Party and shall not impair, by unreasonable or discriminatory measures, the operation, management, maintenance, use, enjoyment sale or liquidation thereof by those investors.\n\n(2) Each Contracting Party shall accord to such investments full security and protection which in any case shall not be less than that accorded to investments of its own investors or to investments of investors of any third State, whichever is more favourable to the investor. Each Contracting Party shall observe any obligation it may have entered into with regard to investments.\n\n331.\n\nArticle 5(3) of the Netherlands-Turkey BIT provides:\n\n(3) Neither Contracting Party shall take any measures depriving, directly or indirectly, investors of the other Contracting Party of their investments unless the following conditions are complied with:\n\n(a) the measures are taken in the public interest and under due process of law;\n\n(b) the measures are not discriminatory;\n\n(c) the measures are accompanied by provision for the payment of just compensation. Such compensation shall amount to the fair market value of the investment or in the absence of a fair market value the genuine value of the investments affected and shall, in order to be effective for the investors, be paid and made freely transferable, without unreasonable delay, to the country of which the investors concerned are nationals or to any other country accepted by the Contracting Party concerned and in the currency in which the investment was originally made or in any freely convertible currency, mutually agreed to by the investor and the Contracting Party.\n\n332.\n\nArticle 8 of the Netherlands-Turkey BIT provides:\n\n(1) For the purposes of this Article, an investment dispute is defined as a dispute involving:\n\na. the interpretation or application of any investment authorization granted by a Contracting Party's foreign investment authority to an investor of the other Contracting Party; or\n\nb. a breach of any right conferred or created by this Agreement with respect to an investment.\n\n(2) In the event of an investment dispute between a Contracting Party and an investor of the other Contracting Party, the parties to the dispute shall initially seek to resolve the dispute by consultations and negotiations in good faith. If such consultations or negotiations are unsuccessful, the dispute may be settled through the use of nonbinding, third party procedures upon which such investor and the Contracting Party mutually agree. If the dispute cannot be resolved through the foregoing procedures the investor concerned may choose to submit the dispute to the International Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes (\u2018Centre\u2019) for settlement by arbitration, at any time after one year from the date upon which the dispute arose provided that in case the investor concerned has brought the dispute before the courts of justice of the Contracting Country that is a party to the dispute, and there has not been rendered a final award.\n\n(3)\n\nc. Each Contracting Party hereby consents to the submission of an investment dispute to the Centre for settlement by arbitration.\n\nd. Arbitration of such disputes shall be done in accordance with the provisions of the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of other States and the \u2018Arbitration Rules\u2019 of the Centre.\n\n(4) For the purposes of this Article, any legal person incorporated or constituted under the applicable laws and regulations of either Contracting Party, but that, immediately before the occurrence of the event or events giving rise to the dispute, was an investment of investors of the other Contracting Party, shall in accordance with Article 25 (2)(b) of the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of other States be treated as an investor of such other Contracting Party.\n\n**2. Principles of Treaty Interpretation**\n------------------------------------------\n\n333.\n\nIn construing the jurisdictional provisions of the Netherlands-Turkey BIT and the ECT, as well as the ICSID Convention to the extent relevant, the Tribunal begins with the interpretative principles in Article 31 of the 1969 Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties. These provisions instruct the Tribunal to look to the \"ordinary meaning\" of the terms in their context and in the light of their object and purpose.\n\n334.\n\nIn examining the Treaties\u2019 object and purpose, the Tribunal has been mindful of competing concerns. On the one hand, a conscientious arbitrator will not set jurisdictional barriers at unreasonable levels which deny investors\u2019 legitimate expectations. Neither, however, should a tribunal facilitate use of treaties by persons not intended to receive their benefits.\n\n335.\n\nIn signing the Netherlands-Turkey BIT and the ECT, Turkey could not have expected that treaty benefits would extend to just any Dutch company, regardless of its relationship to a Turkish investment. Nor could Turkey have expected that benefits would accrue to enterprises from the United States.\n\n336.\n\nRather, Turkey agreed to arbitrate with Dutch entities that had actually made investments in Turkey. That jurisdictional principle must serve as the foundation in construing the notions of \"investor\" and \"investment\" in both Treaties, as well as the analogous provisions in the ICSID Convention.\n\n**D. Arbitrator Park**\n----------------------\n\n**1. Claimant\u2019s Failure to Contribute to the Project**\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n337.\n\nClaimant never made a contribution to the [...] Project sufficient to create for itself the status of an investor under either the ECT or the Netherlands-Turkey BIT, the two investment treaties which would have conferred substantive protection had the jurisdictional hurdles been met.\n\n338.\n\nAll contributions to the Project came from someone other than Claimant. The capital came from the American backers, [X], Negotiations were conducted by the Turkish Sponsors [...]. The Concession Contract came from the First Proj ect Company, [...]. The technology was to be provided by [X],\n\n339.\n\nThe capital contributed by [X] merits special comment, given its role in funding ownership of the shares in the Second Project Company, [...], which ultimately held the Project Concession.\n\n340.\n\nClaimant served as a conduit through which [X], in particular [...] and [...], funneled financial contributions to [the Second Project Company], such contributions comprising the entirety of that entity\u2019s statutory capital. [X], not Claimant, funded all capital for the corporate interest characterized as \"shares of stock\" by Netherlands-Turkey BIT Article 1 (b)(ii) and \"shares, stock or other form of equity\" in ECT Article 1 (6)(b).\n\n341.\n\nOn a dollar-for-dollar basis, Claimant\u2019s bank statements record a series of transactions by which the statutory capital found its way from the American backers [X] to the Second Project Company [...]. Through multiple bank transfers, [X] reimbursed each of Claimant\u2019s asserted contributions to [the Second Project Company] statutory capital, plus another US$ 100 sufficient to cover wire fees.\n\n342.\n\nHad the statutory capital of the Second Project Company derived from a loan made to Claimant by [X], the conclusion might be different. However, the loan thesis seems untenable in light of several undisputed facts.\n\n343.\n\nFirst and foremost, all payments were made pursuant to [X] obligations to [the First Project Company], not to Claimant. The funding of so-called \"development costs\" (which ultimately included capital of the Second Project Company) was based on the Joint Development Agreement, concluded between [...] and the first Turkish company, [the First Project Company] not with Claimant.\n\n344.\n\nSecond, all funds from [X] were disbursed to [the First Project Company], the first Turkish company, not to Claimant.\n\n345.\n\nThird, Claimant never had any meaningful control over use of the funds, which were simply passed through its bank accounts after being forwarded by the First Project Company, [the First Project Company], prior to reimbursement to that Turkish company by [X],\n\n346.\n\nFinally Claimant had no duty to reimburse any advances, which were made without recourse in the event the Project did not achieve Financial Closing, subject to limited exceptions.\n\n347.\n\nThus, Claimant neither made any contribution nor took any risk. Indeed, even liability on the Project\u2019s performance bonds was assumed by the First Project Company, [...], rather than Claimant. See Exhibit R-101 (Performance Bond of 19 April 2000) and Exhibit C-33 (Performance Bond of 19 October 2000). All relevant contributions to the Project came from someone other than Claimant.\n\n348.\n\nOne need not speculate on what remedies under Turkish or international law might be open either to [X], to the Project Companies, or to the original Sponsors. It is sufficient to note that Claimant itself, the entity purporting to have rights guaranteed by investment treaties before this Tribunal, contributed nothing to the Project.\n\n349.\n\nNo general test is suggested with respect to permissible funding sources. Rather, as discussed more fully below, the compelling point is simply that, on the unique facts of this case, Claimant made no relevant contribution to the Project. Thus, Claimant cannot be considered as an \"Investor\" pursuant to either the ECT or the Netherlands-Turkey BIT.\n\n350.\n\nTo be an investor a person must actually make an investment, in the sense of an active contribution.31 Status as a national of the other contracting state is not in itself enough. The Dutch entity, [the First Project Company], has not demonstrated that it actually made any investment in Turkey, in the sense of a meaningful contribution to Turkey. To the extent that contributions were made, they came from nationals or companies of the United States and Turkey.\n\nOxford English Dictionary defines investor as \"one who invests money or makes an investment.\" This definition implicates action. Likewise, Webster\u2019s Third defines investor as \"one that invests; one that seeks to commit funds for long-term profit with a minimum of risk.\" Again, we see that a person is labeled an investor when he partakes in the activity of investing. Le grand Robert: \"personne qui place des capitaux dans l\u2019achat de biens de production\" action de \"placer des capitaux.\"\n\n351.\n\nNor does this case present the situation of one person stepping into the shoes of another which had already made a qualifying contribution, as might be the case for a child who inherits from a parent that had made the contribution prior to death. To the extent that the inheritance analogy has any impact in this case, Claimant would be stepping into the shoes of a Turkish national. Claimant\u2019s ownership of the Second Project Company derives from [...], not a Dutch entity otherwise entitled to treaty protection.\n\n352.\n\nIn this context, it is noteworthy that the foundational concept of active contribution is set forth clearly in both the Netherlands-Turkey BIT and the ECT. The BIT begins in its preamble by anticipating that an agreement on the treatment to be accorded to investments will \"stimulate the flow of capital and technology\" as between the Contracting Parties.\n\n353.\n\nThe \"flow\" being considered must in this context run from the Netherlands to Turkey, not from the United States or some other third country. Investment treaties provide standards of treatment with relation to investments from designated nationals. They are not intended as treaties with the world.\n\n354.\n\nAlso significant is that Article 10(1) of the ECT (one of the provisions relied upon by Claimant) contemplates that the Contracting Parties shall \"encourage and create stable, equitable, favourable and transparent conditions for Investors of other Contracting Parties to *make* Investments in its Area.\" (Emphasis added.)\n\n**2. Investment \"of\u2019 an Investor: The Treaty Language**\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n355.\n\nAs a Dutch corporation, Claimant might otherwise have fallen within the range of entities eligible for consideration as Investors under the Netherlands-Turkey BIT, the ECT and the ICSID Convention. The relevant language includes \"legal person\" under the laws of The Netherlands (Article 1 (a)(ii) of the Netherlands-Turkey BIT), company \"organized in accordance with\" the law of The Netherlands (Article 1 (7)(a)(ii) of the ECT), and \"juridical person[s]\" pursuant to ICSID Convention Article 25.\n\n356.\n\nHowever, to establish status of an Investor, such as to create jurisdiction pursuant to these investment treaties, something more is required than simple incorporation under Dutch law. Many Dutch entities have been incorporated as \"legal persons\" and \"companies\" and \"juridical persons.\" Without an actual contribution to some Turkish investment, however, the Dutch incorporation creates no entitlement to protection as an Investor subject to the jurisdiction of this Tribunal.\n\n357.\n\nThe jurisdictional predicates of the Tribunal\u2019s competence can be found in two significant treaty provisions. ECT Article 26(1) provides for resolution of disputes between a Contracting Party and an Investor of another Contracting Party relating to an \"Investment *of* the latter in the Area of the former.\" (Emphasis added.) Likewise, the Netherlands-Turkey BIT Article 3(1) states that Contracting Parties shall ensure fair and equitable treatment to the \"investments o/investors of the other Contracting Party.\" (Emphasis added.)\n\n358.\n\nIn each instance, the investor is assumed to be an entity which has engaged in the activity of investing, in the form of having made a contribution. An alleged investor must have made some contribution to the host state permitting characterization of that contribution as an investment \"of\u2019 the investor.\n\n359.\n\nConsequently, [...] (the Second Project Company) cannot be considered an investment \"of\u2019 Claimant. Although not a very long word, the term \"of\u2019 constitutes the operative language for determining investor status in both relevant treaties. Pursuant to the interpretative principles of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, which instruct that treaty terms are to be read in their ordinary meaning in context, reference to the investment \"of\u2019 an investor must connotes active contribution of some sort.\n\n360.\n\nPut differently, the treaty language implicates not just the abstract existence of some piece of property, whether stock or otherwise, but also the activity of investing. The Tribunal must find an action transferring something of value (money, know-how, contacts, or expertise) from one treaty-country to another.\n\n361.\n\nFinally, it is a truism that investment treaties are country-specific, not intended to constitute treaties with the entire world. Even if economic contributions were made by nationals of the United States [X], they were not investments \"of\u2019 a Dutch claimant.32\n\nThe Tribunal need not decide on the applicability of Article 17 of the ECT, which allows each Contracting Party to deny the advantages of Part III *(i.e.,* the substantive protections) to \"a legal entity if citizens or nationals of a third state own or control such entity and if that entity has no substantial business activities in the Area of the Contracting Party in which it is organized.\" However, even if Claimant\u2019s contention is correct that Article 17 is concerned with substantive rights, this provision provides further evidence that the Contracting Parties envisaged that an investor would be someone having made a significant contribution.\n\n**3. Claimant\u2019s Failure to Make an Investment: Further Inquiry**\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n362.\n\nGiven the importance of making an investment, further details may be in order with respect to Claimant\u2019s failure in this respect, under both the Netherlands-Turkey BIT and the ECT. The record suggests that any significant contribution to the Project was made either by Americans, [X], or by Turkish nationals (the Project Sponsors), not by the Dutch Claimant.\n\n363.\n\nInvestment in this case is comprised of three distinct concepts: (i) the Concession Contract, (ii) technological expertise, and (iii) the statutory capital of [the Second Project Company], For each of these assets, no relevant contribution was made by Claimant.\n\n**a) The Concession Contract**\n------------------------------\n\n364.\n\nThe Concession Contract represents a long-term, high-expense commitment which might ultimately have contributed to enhancing infrastructure in Turkey. However, Claimant has not demonstrated any contribution to obtaining this Concession. Claimant did not negotiate the terms. Claimant is not a signatory. Nor did Claimant become a party by virtue of assignment.\n\n**b) Technological Expertise**\n------------------------------\n\n365.\n\nIt is not contested that pursuant to the terms of the IDA, [...] was to be the exclusive engineering, procurement, and construction (\"EPC\") contractor. The comprehensive assistance of [...] to the Alapli Project demonstrates that the proffered investment cannot properly be attributed to Claimant.\n\n366.\n\nEven if the Project had been carried out as planned, Claimant\u2019s role would have been limited to providing the corporate structure for foreign equity partners, not providing engineering expertise.\n\n**c) Statutory Capital: The Conduit Bank Accounts**\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n367.\n\nOn 3 March 2000 and 28 June 2000 funds for statutory capital were transferred to [...], the Second Project Company. The Parties\u2019 submissions of 26 August 2011 show that this statutory capital was contributed entirely by [X], with Claimant serving merely as a conduit.\n\n368.\n\nIt is not credible, a Claimant contends, that a loan was made by Claimant\u2019s parent, [...]. This assertion has no support in the facts of this case.\n\n369.\n\nAs discussed below, Claimant\u2019s own bank account records show that the funds for the statutory capital were transferred to Claimant directly from [the First Project Company], not from [...] (see Exhibit C-273, which lists [the First Project Company] as \"Ordering Customer\" and [Dutch Company] as \"Benefic[iary] Customer\" for the transfers of both 24 February 2000 and 26 June 2000) and came ultimately from [X] (see Exhibits C-274 and C- 275). A mere notation of a loan on Claimant\u2019s books, on advice of its accountants, does not change what actually happened for purposes of the relevant investment treaties.\n\n370.\n\nNor is there any support for the proposition that the funds should be considered a loan to Claimant from [X], The advance by [...] bears little resemblance to a loan, certainly not one made to Claimant.\n\n371.\n\nFirst, Claimant was not a party to any agreement to borrow money from [X], which paid development costs as it was obligated to do pursuant to Article 2.1.3 of the Joint Development Agreement concluded *not* with Claimant, but with the First Project Company, [...].\n\n372.\n\nSecond, the bank records supplied by Claimant show that it was [the First Project Company] which received from [X] the monies destined for use as statutory capital.\n\n373.\n\nThe details of the banking transfers are striking. [The First Project Company] wired money to Claimant shortly before each capital payment. The wire transfer on 24 February 2000 covered US$ 50,000 (first page, Exhibit C-273). The wire transfer on 26 June 2000 covered US$ 10,800 (second page, Exhibit C-273). Each wire transfer listed [the First Project Company] as \"Ordering Customer\" and Claimant as \"Beneficiary Customer.\"\n\n374.\n\nCapital was contributed to [...] (the Second Project Company) when funds were transferred on 3 March 2000 and 28 June 2000. Although these amounts (US$ 60,700) came from a bank account in the Netherlands, they were contributed by [X] to [...], the First Project Company, which then passed them on to Claimant. See summary in the final sentence of paragraph 13 of Claimant\u2019s submission of 26 August 2011. This document recites that the sums of US$ 50,000 and US$ 10,800 (an extra hundred dollars above the US$ 10,700 contributed) were reimbursed by [...] to [the First Project Company] shortly after the contribution to capital, with reimbursements coming on 13 March 2000 and 18 July 2000, respectively. See also paragraph 8 of Claimant\u2019s Response to the Tribunal\u2019s Request for Further Information dated 26 August 2011.\n\n375.\n\nClaimant\u2019s communication of 22 September 2011 introduces a slight ambiguity when compared to the earlier submission of 26 August 2011. The September letter and its accompanying bank documents show that the payment on 13 March 2000 was in fact for US$ 51,958, value date 14 March 2000 (Exhibit C-274) while the payment on 18 July 2000 (apparently the value date for the amount received the prior day (Exhibit C-275), was in an amount of $52,249.\n\n376.\n\nThese payments came shortly after each capital contribution. The larger figure (documents of 22 September 2011) obviously included the smaller (submission of 26 August 2011). The backup exhibits correspond to each monthly statement (\"Hesap \u00d6zeti\") from \"Bank Ekspres,\" one dated 31 March 2000 and the other dated 31 July 2000, both for the account of [...], the First Project Company.\n\n377.\n\nRegardless of whether one takes the larger amount (shown in the bank records of [the First Project Company]) or the smaller sum (invoiced to [...] by [the First Project Company]), the document trail submitted by Claimant demonstrates that the entire amount of its capital contribution to [the Second Project Company] was covered by [...].\n\n378.\n\nTo summarize, the sequence was as follows. First Project Company made payments to Claimant; Claimant made payments to Second Project Company; [...] reimbursed the capital payments to First Project Company.\n\n379.\n\nThe payments were all made within a period of five months, from late-February through mid-July 2000, pursuant to a scheme best characterized as a revolving door of sorts. Back-to-back payments by [...] reimbursed [the First Project Company] for monies sent to Claimant as capital contribution to [...], the Second Project Company.\n\n380.\n\nClaimant thus acquired no dominion over the funds used for the statutory capital. Moreover, pursuant to the JDA, such funds were advanced without recourse, given that the Project failed to achieve Financial Closing.33 The funds simply passed in transit through Dutch accounts en route from [X] to the Project,34 in a series of transactions which under the circumstances implicated no repayment duty by Claimant.\n\nClaimant itself admits that absent financial close, [...] was entitled to seek repayment only on the occurrence of three limited events: (i) a sale or other disposition of the Project; (ii) [... ] mandatory (not voluntary) withdrawal pursuant to Articles 2.1.3 and 6 of the JDA; or (iii) successful arbitration against [...] pursuant to Article 3.2.3 of the Termination Protocol. Claimant\u2019s submission of 26 August 2011, paragraphs 39-47.\n\n[X]\u2019s own interest was more akin to that of an investor than that of a lender. In the event the Project failed to close, [X] received nothing. In the event of success, [X] received not only the money advanced plus 10%, but also US$ 1 million over and above the profit from sale of equipment and provision of engineering services.\n\n**4. Other Investor-State Awards**\n----------------------------------\n\n381.\n\nIf the notion elaborated above needed support from the panoply of investor-state awards, such support is not missing. Although not bound by previous decisions of other international tribunals, the relevant cases have been given due consideration with the aim of enhancing consistent interpretation of comparable treaty language as applied to similar fact patterns, thereby promoting the legitimate expectations of both host states and foreign investors. In this connection, several ICSID cases have commented on the notions of investment and investor for the purposes of investment-treaty arbitration.\n\n382.\n\nOf particular relevance to this case are *Salini v. Morocco* and *Toto Construzioni v. Lebanon**,* which analyzed the concept of \"investment\" under Article 25 of the ICSID Convention. In contrast, this decision to decline jurisdiction in this case implicates notions of \"investment\" and \"investor\" as those terms are used in the Netherlands-Turkey BIT and the ECT. Those caveats notwithstanding, the attributes listed by the *Salini* and *Toto* tribunals can be useful in substantiating the admittedly spare definitions of \"investor\" and \"investment\" under the BIT and the ECT.\n\n383.\n\nIn the words of the *Salini* tribunal, \"[t]he doctrine generally considers that the investment infers: contributions, a certain duration of performance of the contract and a participation in the risks of the transaction. In reading the Convention\u2019s preamble, one may add the contribution to the economic development of the host State of the investment as an additional condition. In reality, these various elements may be interdependent. Thus, the risks of the transaction may depend on the contributions and the duration of performance of the contract.\"35\n\n*Salini Costruttori S.p.A, and Italstrade S.p.A. v. Kingdom of Morocco,* ICSID Case No. ARB/00/4, (4 February 2004), at paragraph 52. RLA-110.\n\n384.\n\nAnother case that sheds light upon the notion of \"investor\" is *Toto v. Lebanon**.*36 In finding that the construction project met the necessary requirements, the tribunal stated that, \"[i]n the absence of specific criteria or definitions in the ICSID Convention, the underlying concept of investment, which is economical in nature, becomes relevant: it implies an economical operation initiated and conducted by an entrepreneur using its own financial means and at its own financial risk, with the objective of making a profit within a given period of time.\"37 The tribunal later listed the operative criteria in its case as \"a contribution by the investor, a profitability risk, a significant duration and a substantial contribution to the State\u2019s economic development.\"38\n\n*Toto Construzioni Generali S.p.A. v. Republic of Lebanon,* ICSID Case No. ARB/07/12, Decision on Jurisdiction, (11 September 2009). RLA-127.\n\n*Toto* at paragraph 84.\n\n*Toto* at paragraph 86.\n\n385.\n\nEven the cases cited by Claimant assume some contribution. Claimant advances *Mobil v. Venezuela* as support for the proposition that corporate restructuring aimed at gaining treaty protection for future disputes is legitimate. The tribunal in that case found that \"the main, if not the sole purpose of the restructuring was to protect Mobil investments from adverse Venezuelan measures in getting access to ICSID arbitration through the Dutch-Venezuela BIT.\" and that such restructuring could be either \"legitimate corporate planning\" or an \"abuse of right\" depending on the circumstances.39\n\n*Mobil* at paragraphs 190-191.\n\n386.\n\nThe tribunal *in Mobil* found jurisdiction under the BIT despite the respondent\u2019s contention that the claimant was a \"corporation of convenience.\" However, the *Mobil* tribunal did not doubt the legitimacy of the Dutch company\u2019s role, noting that the claimant in that case \"contributed their part to [the] investments.\"40 For this reason, *Mobil* is not perfectly analogous to the present dispute. While Claimant may have been established pursuant to \"legitimate corporate planning,\" there is no indication that it contributed anything to the relevant investments. Claimant acted merely as a conduit in effecting the back-to-back payments required to incorporate [the Second Project Company],\n\n*Mobil* at paragraph 197.\n\n**5. Conclusion**\n-----------------\n\n387.\n\nThe testimony of [...] proves instructive in connection with the conclusion that Claimant played no meaningful role in any aspect of the relevant investment.\n\n388.\n\nOn the second day of the evidentiary hearings, Tuesday 1 February 2011, he gave the following testimony in response to questions from Respondent\u2019s counsel:\n\n*Counsel:* Nothing came from Claimant out of pocket; right?\n\n[...]: Nothing came from the Claimant as the first Project Company as well as the second Project Company.\n\nTranscript, page 286, lines 9-12.\n\n*Counsel:* Claimant never paid any development expenses. Those were paid for by [X]; right?\n\n[...]: Right.\n\n*Counsel'.* As a practical matter, Claimant never paid out any money at all in connection with this Project, right?\n\n[...]: Right.\n\nTranscript, page 301, lines 2-5 and 10-14.\n\n389.\n\nIn the view of Arbitrator Park, this reality prevents this Tribunal from taking jurisdiction over the current dispute. Neither the ECT nor the Netherlands-Turkey BIT contemplates jurisdiction over a claim brought by an entity which played no meaningful role contributing to the relevant host state project, whether by way of money, concession rights or technology.\n\n**E. Arbitrator Stern**\n-----------------------\n\n390.\n\nAlthough Arbitrator Stern shares the conclusion arrived at by Arbitrator Park, to the effect that the Tribunal has no jurisdiction, she arrives at such a conclusion through a different legal analysis. The uncontested fact that a Dutch company owns the shares of [the Second Project Company] seems sufficient to consider that there is indeed in this case a foreign investor which is the legal owner of an investment. However, the factual elements on which Arbitrator Park relies are a confirmation that there is no protected investment in this case, as they are the visible sign that the whole operation did not have any economic rationale, but had as its main purpose to gain access to ICSID arbitration at a time when there were already important disagreements between the Turkish company and the Turkish authorities, the precise disagreements that are at the core of the present claim of Claimant. In other words, the introduction of the Dutch company in the investment chain was, at the time it was performed, an abuse of the system of international investment protection under the ICSID/BIT/ECT mechanism.\n\n391.\n\nThis does not mean that any structuring of a national investment through a foreign corporation is an abuse. It will indeed depend on the timing of such restructuring, as indicated in *Mobil v. Venezuela**,* where the tribunal stated that \"(s)uch restructuring could be \u2018legitimate corporate planning\u2019 as contended by Claimants or an \u2018abuse of right\u2019 as submitted by Respondent. It depends upon the circumstances in which it happened.\"41\n\n*Mobil v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela,* ICSID Case No. ARB/07/27, Decision on Jurisdiction, (10 June 2010), paragraph 169.\n\n392.\n\nThis important question of timing was also explained in the *Phoenix* award, in the following terms:\n\nInternational investors can of course structure upstream their investments, which meet the requirement of participating in the economy of the host State, in a manner that best fits their need for international protection, in choosing freely the vehicle through which they perform their investment....\n\nBut on the other side, an international investor cannot modify downstream the protection granted to its investment by the host State, once the acts which the investor considers are causing damages to its investment have already been committed.42\n\n*Phoenix Action, Ltd. v. Czech Republic,* ICSID Case No. ARB/06/5, Award (15 April 2009), paragraphs 94-95. Emphasis in the original.\n\n393.\n\nIn order to determine whether or not there was an abuse in the present case, all circumstances have to be analysed. This analysis will show first, that, at the time it was performed, the introduction of the Dutch company had as its main purpose the access to international arbitration which did not exist for the Turkish nationals and the Turkish company before such introduction and second that such operation was precisely performed at a moment when the facts at the root of the dispute presented to the Tribunal were already known.\n\n394.\n\nA few uncontroversial facts can be restated here. The Concession Contract, which [the First Project Company] signed on 27 October 1998, in its Article 3 entitled \"Establishment of a new company,\" provided the following:\n\nWithin three months following the execution of the Contract, [the First Project Company] shall establish a new capital stock company, the articles of association of which shall be approved by the Ministry, in order to realize the works that are included within the scope of this Contract.\n\nAll rights and obligations, which the Company has undertaken under the Contract, shall deem to be transferred to the new company to be established following the registration and announcement of such company.\n\n395.\n\nThis new company was therefore to be created before 28 January 1998, by [the First Project Company], This is not at all what happened. In order to convince the Tribunal that the creation of [the Second Project Company] by two Dutch corporations was done in good faith, Claimant insists on the fact that such creation was mandated by the just mentioned Article 3. But contrary to the assertions of Claimant, it is not at all what was mandated that happened, but a very different structuring of the investment following a completely different timing and a completely different logic than foreseen in the initial project.\n\n396.\n\n*Initially,* the new Turkish company was to be established by [the First Project Company], but *in fact* [the Second Project Company] was established by the shareholders of [the First Project Company], through an indirect line of foreign companies, with one layer of companies of Cura\u00e7ao and another layer of Dutch companies.43\n\nThis raises also some concerns about the misuse of corporate assets, as the Concession Contract was transferred from the [the First Project Company] company to another Turkish company which was not its subsidiary and with which it had no links besides the fact that they had the same shareholders. This element of the file is not central to the finding of the Tribunal, but is one more indicia that the whole operation was not a real economic operation, but a manipulation of corporation structures.\n\n397.\n\n*Initially,* the new Turkish company was to be established before 28 January 1999, but it was *in fact* established 14 months after this contractual deadline, on 27 March 2000.\n\n398.\n\n*Initially,* the new Turkish company was supposed to attract the interest of foreign shareholders, which were going to buy its shares. The main target for foreign investors was the United States. However, it appeared quite quickly that no American company was ready to become an equity partner in the project, even [X], which was quite involved, stopped short of acquiring shares in [the Second Project Company], *In fact,* the new Turkish company\u2019s shares were bought by Dutch shell companies, whose owners were the two Turkish Sponsors of the Project, [...].\n\n399.\n\n*Initially,* the creation of diversity of nationality by the introduction of a foreign company had three purposes, as stated by Claimant: tax purposes; BIT protection; attraction of foreign investors. *In fact,* the new Turkish company was created at a time when it was clear that no real foreign investor was interested. And as it has transpired from the file that the tax benefits were quite minor. In other words, of the three initial purposes, only two remained at the time of introduction of the Dutch company. The inescapable conclusion is that when the Dutch companies created [the Second Project Company], the main remaining purpose was to attract BIT protection.\n\n400.\n\nAccordingly, the factual situation here is materially similar to the facts found by the tribunal in the *Mobil v. Venezuela* case, where it stated that \"... the main, if not the sole purpose of the restructuring was to protect Mobil investments from adverse Venezuelan measures in getting access to ICSID arbitration through the Dutch-Venezuela BIT.\"44\n\n*Mobil v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela,* ICSID Case No. ARB/07/27, Decision on Jurisdiction, (10 June 2010), paragraph 190\n\n401.\n\nThe next question is then whether such restructuring was made in good faith or was only a device to gain access to international arbitration, at a time when the acts at the core of the Claimant\u2019s claim where already known to it.\n\n402.\n\nThere is indeed a dividing line between a good faith (re)structuring to get access to international arbitration and a bad faith restructuring to get access to international arbitration.\n\n403.\n\nThe dividing-line occurs when the relevant party can see an actual dispute or can foresee a specific future dispute as a high probability and not merely a general future controversy. It appears that it would be unfair to allow Claimant to change its nationality in the grey period of the Parties\u2019 relationship between good relations and a full-fledged dispute, when disagreement and acrimony have already arisen. It is indeed an abuse for an investor to manipulate the nationality of a shell company subsidiary to gain jurisdiction under an international treaty at a time when the investor is aware that events have occurred that negatively affect its investment and may lead to arbitration. Before that dividing-line is reached, there will be ordinarily no abuse of process; but after that dividing-line is passed, there ordinarily will be. The answer in each case will, however, depend upon its particular facts and circumstances, as in this case.\n\n404.\n\nAll the elements in the file and the particular circumstances of the case prove that the investment was manipulated to appear as a foreign investment, beyond this dividing line, with the result that the foreign investment must be considered to be the result of an abuse - a manipulation not inside a family like in *Phoenix**,* but inside a \"corporate family\", in other words, a corporate structure involving only two persons - and cannot therefore be analyzed as a protected investment that can benefit from the protection of the ICSID/BIT/ECT arbitration mechanism.\n\n405.\n\nAgain, a few uncontroversial facts can be restated here, on which such conviction rests.\n\n406.\n\nAlthough it should have been established at the beginning of the year 1998, Claimant was established on 26 April 1999, as an empty shell. *Initially,* the idea was to create the new Turkish company when this empty shell would no longer be empty, but would have found international foreign investors. Contrary to what was still the plan beginning of May 2000, suddenly the shareholding structure was finalized end of that month. Indeed, even beginning May 2000, it was stated in a Confidential Briefing Memorial (R-265) prepared by [...] for providing information to financial institutions that the new structure will only be put in place when international developers would enter into the project: \"ATAM... is currently in discussions with several major *international developers* who have expressed interest in acquiring an equity interest in the Project. It is contemplated that one or more of those developers will join the consortium in due course, *at which time the shareholding structure will be finalized* and the Sponsors will establish a special purpose Turkish limited liability company to undertake the Project.\" (Emphasis added.) But *in fact,* contrary to the plans, when it clearly had appeared that problems were ahead and that there was a high probability of things turning into a dispute, the new shareholding structure had been put into place, with no international developers, and with the sole participation of the two Turkish Sponsors, using the intermediary of Cura\u00e7ao and Dutch companies of which they were the sole owners. Under being questioned at the hearing, [...] could not offer any plausible reason why Claimant\u2019s [the Second Project Company] was formed when it was, some 14 months after it should have been created according to the Concession Contract. (Transcript, 354:14-20) The fact that the only \"investors\" implicated were the two Turkish men who initiated the Project matters here. It is worth noting that this information was only found upon discovery, and was not spontaneously given by Claimant. It seems difficult to deny that the Turkish Sponsors tried to hide the fact that no international investor was concerned by the use of the Dutch companies, which had not attracted foreign investment and therefore appeared as mere shell companies at the moment they got involved in the Project in March 2000. Also worth mentioning is the fact that Claimant itself stated that \"the identity (and nationality) of the Claimant\u2019s ultimate shareholder is juridically irrelevant, unless the Respondent can prove an abuse of the rights that otherwise vest in the Claimant as a qualifying \u2018investor\u2019.\" See Claimant\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief of 20 April 2011, at paragraph 19. Such an abuse is precisely present here, as will be indicated now.\n\n407.\n\nIt is worth recalling what has happened just shortly before this change of policy, which shows that the Dutch entity was clearly established by the American-financed Turkish group to obtain treaty protection at a moment when negotiations with the Turkish government went sour.\n\n408.\n\nIt is uncontested that on 22 January 2000, Law No. 4501 was adopted, which allowed parties to existing BOT concession contracts to apply to the Ministry to either add international arbitration to their concession contracts or to convert their contracts into private law contracts. Turkish [...] did not elect simply to add an arbitration clause to its Concession Contract, which was one of the possibilities opened by Law 4501, but, being dissatisfied with the Concession Contract, elected the other option, in full knowledge of possible difficulties.\n\n409.\n\nThe process of transformation never succeeded, as is well known. It appears that all of the present claims are based on facts well known to the Sponsors of the Project before the restructuring: the necessity to adjust tariffs and renegotiate the Concession Contract, the importance of the 31 December 2002 deadline, which was in any case in the Concession Contract from the beginning.\n\n410.\n\nFirst, [Turkish Ministry] publicly announced its principles for Law No. 4501 conversions, including the principle of tariff reductions, on 21 March 2000. On that date, the Ministry met with [the First Project Company] and outlined the general principles that would guide the process of converting the Concession Contract into an Implementation Contract under Law No. 4501. The minutes of that important meeting clarify these principles:\n\nConcerning the application of the provisions of law no. 4501 to [...] contract which was approached within the context of build-operate-transfer model, the following considerations were notified to the company in the meeting held in the [...] on March 21, 2000 at 1:30 pm.\n\n1. Making a reduction in the tariff at the betterment rate in case new loans are found in more appropriate conditions, not reflecting any increases in loan conditions to the tariff.\n\n2. Reorganizing the tariff tables by taking the average sales tariff, except for fuel, for 20 years as [...].\n\n3. Making necessary changes in the agreements in order to be attuned to legal regulations comprised within the scope of \"Restructuring\" of Electrical Energy Sector in the forthcoming years on condition that the company does not receive any advantage or suffer any losses.\n\n4. Putting the loans into operation by completing the subsidiary agreements in the jointly determined eventual time.\n\n411.\n\nA week later (R-93), [the First Project Company] expressed its disagreement with a tariff modification:\n\nWe believe we will be able to conform to most of items 1, 3 and 4 of the report with 4 items that you have brought to our meeting on Tuesday, 21-03-2000 and we can discuss them immediately if you wish.\n\nThe Tariff you mention in item 2 is a subject that was finalized by the signed contract...\n\nThis is a point which has been decided by signed contracts. It does not seem possible for us to make a modification on the Tariff.\n\n412.\n\nIn this arbitration, Claimant specifically identifies this meeting as an example of when \"the [Turkish Ministry] started to pressure the Project Company to re-open the commercial terms agreed in the Conversion Contract.\" Claimant points to such Ministry requests for terms, which Claimant says were not in the Ministry\u2019s power, as a breach of the BIT and the ECT. Claimant has described this meeting as a key turning point in the case. Claimant\u2019s [Second Project Company] was suddenly incorporated and registered nine days after this meeting at which [the First Project Company] was allegedly \"pressured\" and subjected to treatment allegedly inconsistent with the BIT and the ECT. It is uncontested that the scope of the Ministry\u2019s authority to discuss new commercial terms during the process of converting the Concession Contract into a private law contract under Law No. 4501, which was asserted before the introduction of the Dutch Company, is at the heart of the present dispute.\n\n413.\n\nSecond, [the First Project Company] was also aware, before the entry on the scene of Claimant through the restructuring, that the Turkish authorities were insisting on the completion date of 31 December 2002. It results indeed from the file, more precisely from an e-mail from [...] to [...], dated March 13, 2000 (R-256), [the First Project Company] was already on notice on 13 March 2000, before the entry on the scene of the Dutch company, that the Turkish authorities would insist on the committed completion date of end of December 2002.\" (This document was found through discovery. See Respondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction and Rejoinder on the Merits, at paragraph 437):\n\n[...] informed me today that [the First Project Company] will be required to give assurance that the plant will be in commercial operation by 31 December 2002.\n\n414.\n\nIt is uncontested that [the First Project Company] refused to give this assurance and that this is also one of the central elements of the present claim.\n\n415.\n\n[...] confirmed during the hearing that, immediately before [the Second Project Company] formation on 27 March 2000, he became personally aware that Law No. 4501 would involve: (i) negotiating a new contract; (ii) renegotiating the tariff and other terms; and (iii) agreeing to complete the project by the end of 2002. See Transcript, at 417:21-22; 418:1-2; 408:21-409:3; 437:20-440: 8.\n\n416.\n\nFrom all these circumstances, it is clear that Claimant, as a Dutch company, acquired its investment for the sole purpose of manufacturing international jurisdiction, at a time when the project was already in great difficulty and the facts that are at the root of the dispute with Turkey were already known to the Sponsors of the Project. This was underscored by Respondent, when it stated: \"The actions of the Respondent on which the Claimant\u2019s principal claims are predicated were all taken, or at a minimum set in motion, prior to Claimant\u2019s alleged investment.\"\n\n417.\n\nIn conclusion, because the investment was not a *bona fide* investment, as it was performed at a time were the facts at the root of the dispute were already known and a dispute was already a high probability, the Tribunal has no jurisdiction over this investment, as it cannot benefit from the international protection granted by the ICSID/BIT/ECT mechanism.\n\n**VIII. Merits**\n----------------\n\n418.\n\nGiven the Tribunal\u2019s finding that jurisdiction over the claims is absent under the Netherlands-Turkey BIT and the ECT, it would be inappropriate to proceed to address the merits of this dispute.\n\n**IX. Costs**\n-------------\n\n**A. Claimant**\n---------------\n\n419.\n\nIn its Post-Hearing Brief of 20 April 2011, Claimant requested an award ordering Respondent to pay the costs of this arbitration, including all fees and expenses of the Tribunal and of ICSID, along with all legal costs and expenses incurred by Claimant in respect of this arbitration.\n\n**B. Respondent**\n-----------------\n\n420.\n\nIn its Post-Hearing Brief of 20 April 2011, Respondent requested an award ordering Claimant to pay Respondent\u2019s costs, including counsel fees, incurred in respect of this arbitration.\n\n**C. Submissions on Parties\u2019 Costs**\n------------------------------------\n\n421.\n\nThe Hearing Protocol attached to the Minutes of the Pre-Hearing Conference on 6 January 2011 invited the Parties to submit their costs pursuant to ICSID Rule 28 by 6 June 2011. Pursuant to the Hearing Protocol agreed by the Parties, Claimant submitted its Statement of Costs on 6 June 2011. According to Claimant\u2019s 6 June 2011 submission, Claimant had incurred total costs of US$ 8,118,421 representing attorneys\u2019 fees, experts\u2019 fees, and out-of-pocket expenses.\n\n422.\n\nOn 11 November 2011, Claimant submitted a revised Statement of Costs, updating its figures in light of the preparation of Claimant\u2019s response to the Tribunal\u2019s post-hearing questions and submissions in connection with new evidence. According to Claimant\u2019s revised submission, Claimant had incurred total costs of US$ 8,264,624, representing attorneys\u2019 fees, experts\u2019 fees, and out-of-pocket expenses. Claimant has advanced US$ 449,960 to ICSID to cover the costs of the proceedings (excluding the lodging fee of US$ 25,000).\n\n423.\n\nPursuant to the Hearing Protocol agreed by the Parties, Respondent provided its Cost Submission on 6 June 2011. According to Respondent\u2019s submission of 6 June 2011, Respondent had incurred total costs of US$ 4,349,540.77, representing attorneys\u2019 fees, experts\u2019 fees, travel expenses for government representatives, and the advances to ICSID (US$ 450,000).\n\n**D. Allocation of Costs**\n--------------------------\n\n424.\n\nHaving considered the Parties\u2019 arguments, the Tribunal finds that both sides presented their arguments in good faith. Consequently, the Tribunal thus finds it appropriate to direct each side to bear its own legal expenses, including fees for attorneys and experts. The costs of arbitration, including the fees of the arbitrators and the administrative expenses of the Centre, shall be divided on an equal (50/50) basis.45\n\nThe ICSID Secretariat will provide the parties with a detailed Financial Statement of the case account as soon as all invoices are received and the account is final. The remaining balance will be reimbursed to the parties in proportion to the payments that they advanced to ICSID.\n\n**X. Disposition**\n------------------\n\n425.\n\nIn light of the Majority\u2019s decision, the Tribunal dismisses with prejudice all claims for lack of jurisdiction under the Netherlands-Turkey BIT and the ECT.\n\n426.\n\nEach side shall bear its own legal expenses, including fees for attorneys and experts. The costs of arbitration shall be divided on an equal (50/50) basis."}, {"Title": "Decision on Annulment", "Type": "Annulment", "Date": "2014-07-10T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Decision on Annulment\n---------------------\n\n**I. PROCEDURAL HISTORY**\n-------------------------\n\n1.\n\nOn November 12, 2012, Alapli Elektrik B.V. (the \"Applicant\") filed with the Secretary-General of the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (\"ICSID\") an application for annulment (the \"Application\") of the award rendered on July 16, 2012 in *Alapli Elektrik B.V. v. Republic of Turkey* (ICSID Case No. ARB/08/13) (the \"Award\"). Attached to the Award was a dissenting opinion by arbitrator Marc Lalonde (the \"Dissent\"). The Application was filed in accordance with Article 52 of the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States (\"ICSID Convention\") and Rule 50 of the ICSID Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings (\"Arbitration Rules\").\n\n2.\n\nThe Application was made within the time period provided in Article 52(2) of the ICSID Convention and sought annulment of the Award on three of the five grounds set out in Article 52(1) of the Convention: (i) that the Tribunal had manifestly exceeded its powers (Article 52(1)(b)); (ii) that there had been a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure (Article 52(1)(d)); and (iii) that the Award had failed to state the reasons on which it was based (Article 52(1)(e)).\n\n3.\n\nOn 16 November 2012, the Secretary-General notified the Parties that the Application had been registered on that date in accordance with Rule 50(2) of the Arbitration Rules.\n\n4.\n\nBy letter of December 12, 2012, in accordance with Rule 52(2) of the Arbitration Rules, the Secretary-General notified the Parties that an *ad hoc* Committee (\"Committee\") had been constituted, composed of Prof. Bernard Hanotiau (Belgian) as President, Prof. Karl-Heinz B\u00f6ckstiegel (German) and Mr. Makhdoom Ali Khan (Pakistani) as Members, and that the annulment proceeding was deemed to have begun on that date. The Parties were also informed that Ms. Martina Polasek, Team Leader/Legal Counsel at ICSID, would serve as Secretary of the Committee.\n\n5.\n\nBy agreement of the Parties, the Committee held its first session by telephone conference on February 15, 2013. Participating at the session were:\n\nOn behalf of Applicant\n\nMr. Stephen Fietta Volterra Fietta  \nMr. Jiries Saadeh Volterra Fietta  \nMr. Bernhard Maier Volterra Fietta\n\nOn behalf of Respondent\n\nMs. Marinn Carlson Sidley Austin LLP  \nMs. Jennifer Haworth McCandless Sidley Austin LLP\n\n6.\n\nDuring the first session, the Parties confirmed their agreement on certain procedural matters and made oral submissions on certain points of disagreement. Among other things, the Parties agreed on the timetable of the proceeding, that the applicable Arbitration Rules would be those in force as of April 2006 and that the language of the proceeding would be English. The Parties did not agree on the possibility of fact witness testimony and new documentary evidence in the annulment proceedings (the Applicant wished to retain the possibility of new witness and documentary evidence, while the Respondent objected to any such new evidence), and on the place of proceedings (the Applicant proposed Paris, while the Respondent raised Rule 13(3) of the Arbitration Rules to request that the proceedings be held in Washington, D.C.).\n\n7.\n\nOn February 28, 2013, the Committee issued Minutes of the First Session of the *ad hoc* Committee and Procedural Order No. 1. In addition to confirming the Parties\u2019 agreements, the Order stated that the Committee did not exclude the possibility that a witness statement, expert report or new documentary evidence could be admitted in an annulment proceeding, to the extent that the statement, report or documentary evidence were relevant to the consideration of the grounds for annulment pleaded. The admissibility of any such disputed new evidence would therefore be considered on a case by case basis. The Committee noted, however, that it expected that the Parties would primarily refer to the evidentiary record of the arbitration proceeding. The Order further stated that the place of proceedings would be Washington, D.C., pursuant to Articles 62 and 63 of the ICSID Convention and Arbitration Rule 13(3).\n\n8.\n\nOn March 25, 2013, in accordance with Procedural Order No. 1, the Applicant filed its Memorial on Annulment, accompanied by exhibits C-273 through C-303.\n\n9.\n\nOn June 10, 2013, the Respondent filed its Counter-Memorial on Annulment, accompanied by exhibits R-299 through R-311, legal authorities RLA-152 through RLA-204 and an expert opinion of Judge Bruno Simma.\n\n10.\n\nOn July 29, 2013, the Applicant filed a Reply on Annulment, accompanied by exhibits C-304 through C-309.\n\n11.\n\nOn September 23, 2013, the Respondent filed its Rejoinder on Annulment, accompanied by exhibits R-312 through R-317, legal authorities RLA-205 through RLA-226, and a second expert opinion of Judge Bruno Simma.\n\n12.\n\nOn October 10, 2013, the Secretary of the Committee informed the Parties that Mr. Ali Khan had not by that date received a visa to travel to the United States, which he had applied for in April 2013. The Committee therefore decided that, if Mr. Ali Khan did not obtain his US visa by October 25, 2013, the hearing would be moved to the World Bank facilities in Paris. Since Mr. Ali Khan had not received the US visa by November 1, 2013, the hearing venue was moved to Paris on that date with the Parties\u2019 agreement.\n\n13.\n\nThe hearing on annulment was thus held at the World Bank facilities in Paris, France on December 17 and 18, 2013. In addition to the Members of the Committee and the Secretary of the Committee, the following persons participated in the hearing:\n\nAttending on behalf of Applicant\n\nMr. Rob ert Volterra Volterra Fietta  \nMr. Patricio Gran\u00e9 Volterra Fietta  \nMr. Jiries Saadeh Volterra Fietta  \nMr. Bernhard Maier Volterra Fietta  \nMs. Clementine Lietar Volterra Fietta\n\nAttending on behalf of Respondent\n\nMr. Stanimir A.

The hearing was recorded and a verbatim transcript was made and circulated to the Parties.\n\n15.\n\nPursuant to the Committee\u2019s directions at the hearing, the Parties filed their respective statements of costs on February 7, 2014.\n\n16.\n\nIn accordance with Arbitration Rules 53 and 38(1), the proceedings were declared closed on May 5, 2014.\n\n**II. THE AWARD AND THE DISSENT**\n---------------------------------\n\n17.\n\nThe Award of July 16, 20121 was rendered by a Tribunal composed of Prof. William W. Park (President, appointed by the Chairman of the Administrative Council), Mr. Marc Lalonde (appointed by the Applicant, *i.e.* Claimant in the original proceedings) and Prof. Brigitte Stern (appointed by the Respondent).\n\nExh. C-273 (labeled \"Exhibit C-I\" in the Application for Annulment).\n\n18.\n\nAfter a brief introductory section and a section setting out the procedural history, the Award describes the factual background of the dispute in its Section III. The facts in that Section can be summarized as follows:\n\n19.\n\nThe dispute between the Parties concerned a concession to develop, finance, construct, own, operate and transfer a combined cycle power plant in Turkey. In 1995, two Turkish nationals, Mr. Taylan Morova and Mr. Mustafa \u00d6zkan, established a company in Turkey as the investment vehicle for the concession (\"Atam Elektrik\" or \"First Project Company\"). In 1997, Atam Elektrik submitted a feasibility study for the Project which was approved by the Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources of the Republic of Turkey (\"MENR\"). Concurrently, the First Project Company concluded a Letter of Intent with an affiliate of the General Electric Group (\"GE\"), providing that the affiliate would be the engineering, procurement and construction contractor for the Project. Atam Elektrik also entered into a Joint Development Agreement with another affiliate of GE, which provided, among other things, that the affiliate would provide certain funding for development of the Project.\n\n20.\n\nIn October 1998, the First Project Company and the MENR concluded a concession contract concerning the Project. Further contracts with State-owned companies were concluded concerning the supply of gas to the plant and the sale of electricity generated at the plant.\n\n21.\n\nSubsequently, in April 1999, the Applicant (a company incorporated in the Netherlands) was established as a subsidiary of a holding company incorporated in Curacao, which in turn was wholly owned by Mr. Morova. In March 2000, the Applicant obtained shares in a newly registered Turkish entity (\"Atam Alapli\" or \"the Second Project Company\"), which was assigned the rights of the First Project Company under the concession contract.2 The assignment was approved by the MENR in November 2000.\n\nA chart showing the initial corporate structure and the modified corporate structure can be found at p. 8 of the Award.\n\n22.\n\nIn February 2000, following the adoption of a law providing for a conversion process for certain administrative law concession contracts (Law No. 4501), the First Project Company sought to convert the concession contract to a private law contract. At the same time, another new law in Turkey eliminated Treasury Guarantees for certain energy sector projects not finalized before December 31, 2002 (Law No. 4628) and made certain restrictions to energy sales agreements.\n\n23.\n\nAs described in paragraphs 2 and 224-260 of the Award, the Applicant asserted that it made its investment in reliance upon governmental assurances and legislation intended to attract international investment, and that the Respondent undermined the project by conduct that contradicted its assurances and by making adverse legislative changes. The Applicant argued that these actions led to the loss of its investment and violated a number of investment protection provisions of the Energy Charter Treaty (\"ECT\") and the Agreement on Reciprocal Encouragement and Protection of Investments between the Kingdom of the Netherlands and the Republic of Turkey of March 27, 1986 (\"BIT\").\n\n24.\n\nSections IV, V and VI of the Award describe the Parties\u2019 arguments on jurisdiction, on the merits and on quantum. Section VII proceeds with the Tribunal\u2019s analysis on jurisdiction. The first three introductory paragraphs of that Section provide as follows:\n\n311. A Turkish national, backed by an American multinational, seeing a dispute looming with his own government, established a Dutch entity which is claiming treaty protection for a proposed combined cycle power plant. The entirety of the financial contribution and technological know-how came from American backers, the GE Group, which advanced monies to realize an opportunity to provide equipment and services, taking all risk of loss if the Project never came to fruition, [footnote omitted] The Concession Contract, by which the host country agreed in principle to the Project\u2019s terms, was awarded to a Turkish company, Atam Elektrik.\n\n312. After careful consideration of all arguments and evidence, Arbitrators Stern and Park (the \"Majority\") conclude that this Tribunal lacks jurisdiction to hear the dispute pursuant to the ECT and the Netherlands-Turkey BIT.\n\n313. The Majority has considered the two lines of reasoning set forth below. Although Arbitrator Stern and Arbitrator Park do not necessarily assign the same weight to the various components in these overlapping lines of reasoning, both members conclude that jurisdiction is clearly absent.\n\n25.\n\nThe two lines of reasoning mentioned at paragraph 313 of the Award are contained in paragraphs 337-389 (Arbitrator Park\u2019s reasoning) and 390-417 (Arbitrator Stern\u2019s reasoning). In essence, Arbitrator Park found that the \"Claimant never made a contribution to the Alapli Project sufficient to create for itself the status of an investor under either the ECT or the Netherlands-Turkey BIT\" (para. 337 of the Award). Arbitrator Stern, on the other hand, found that there was no *\"bona fide* investment,\" as \"it is clear that Claimant, as a Dutch company, acquired its investment for the sole purpose of manufacturing international jurisdiction, at a time when the project was already in great difficulty and the facts that are at the root of the dispute with Turkey were already known to the Sponsors of the Project\" (paras. 416 and 417 of the Award). These lines of reasoning are further described below in the context of the Parties\u2019 arguments.\n\n26.\n\nThe Majority consisting of Arbitrator Park and Arbitrator Stern thus concluded that there was no jurisdiction over the Claimant\u2019s claims under the ECT and the BIT and did therefore not address the merits of the dispute. The Award ordered that each Party bear its own legal expenses and that the costs of arbitration be divided equally between the Parties.\n\n27.\n\nArbitrator Lalonde\u2019s Dissent opined that there was jurisdiction over both the ECT and the BIT \"concerning all events arising after 30 March 2000, the date of the acquisition of 50% of the shares of Atam Alapli by Claimant.\"\n\n**III. THE NATURE OF THE ANNULMENT PROCEDURE**\n----------------------------------------------\n\n28.\n\nBefore setting out the Parties\u2019 positions with regard to the various grounds for annulment invoked by the Applicant, the *ad hoc* Committee wishes to make some preliminary observations.\n\n29.\n\nThe first observation concerns the interpretation of the ICSID Convention itself. In this respect, the Committee will be guided by the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties of 1969 (the \"VCLT\"), in particular its Articles 31 to 33. Therefore, according to Article 31 VCLT, the terms of the ICSID Convention will be read in good faith, in accordance with their ordinary meaning, in their context, and in light of the object and purpose of the Convention as a whole. Moreover, based on Article 33 VCLT, the terms of the ICSID Convention will be presumed to have the same meaning in each of the equally authoritative versions of the treaty: English, French and Spanish.\n\n30.\n\nThe second observation concerns the role of annulment within the ICSID Convention system.\n\n31.\n\nIt is the *ad hoc* Committee\u2019s view that the ICSID Convention has achieved a careful balance between the interest of ensuring the finality of awards, on the one hand, and of guaranteeing the fundamental fairness of the arbitral process, on the other hand.\n\n32.\n\nIn the Committee\u2019s view, and in light of the text of the Convention, annulment is a limited remedy with a strictly circumscribed role: to safeguard the fundamental fairness and integrity of the underlying proceeding. Indeed, Article 52(1) of the ICSID Convention limits annulment to five grounds, all of which concern the very integrity of the arbitral process. What is more, Article 53 of the ICSID Convention provides that an award may not be the subject of an appeal or, for that matter, of any remedy other than the ones expressly provided in the Convention.\n\n33.\n\nIn light of annulment\u2019s limited scope, the *ad hoc* Committee considers that it is not within its power to review the substantive correctness of the Award, both in fact and in law. The Committee may only examine whether the standards of procedural integrity of the underlying proceeding were adhered to. In this respect, the *ad hoc* committee concurs with the committee *MINE v. Guinea:*\n\n\"Article 52(1) makes it clear that annulment is a limited remedy. This is further confirmed by the exclusion of review of the merits of awards by Article 53. Annulment is not a remedy against an incorrect decision. Accordingly, an *ad hoc* Committee may not in fact reverse an award on the merits under the guise of applying Article 52.\"3\n\n*Maritime International Nominees Establishment v. Government of Guinea,* ICSID Case No. ARB/84/4, Decision on Annulment, January 6, 1988, para. 4.04 (\"*MINE v. Guinea\").*\n\n34.\n\nIn the present case, the Applicant invokes three of the five possible grounds for annulment, namely:\n\n(b) that the Tribunal has manifestly exceeded its powers;\n\n(d) that there has been a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure; and\n\n(e) that the Award has failed to state the reasons upon which it is based.\n\n35.\n\nIn the paragraphs below, the *ad hoc* Committee will first briefly present the Applicant\u2019s **(IV.l.)** and the Respondent\u2019s **(IV.2.)** respective positions on the three grounds for annulment. It will then proceed with its own Analysis **(V.),** starting with a few observations on the relationship between Article 48 of the ICSID Convention and Arbitration Rule 47 (**V.I.**), Thereafter, the Committee will investigate whether the Tribunal committed a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure **(V.2.A.),** whether the Award failed to state the reasons on which it is based **(V.2.B.),** and whether the Tribunal committed a manifest excess of powers **(V.2.C.),** Finally, the Committee will make its decision with respect to costs **(VI.).**\n\n36.\n\nIn the analysis below, the *ad hoc* Committee has not only considered the positions of the Parties as summarized in this Decision, but also the numerous detailed arguments made in their written submissions and at the hearing. To the extent that these arguments are not referred to expressly, they must be deemed to be subsumed in the *ad hoc* Committee\u2019s analysis.\n\n**IV. THE PARTIES\u2019 POSITIONS**\n------------------------------\n\n**1. The Applicant**\n--------------------\n\n37.\n\nAccording to the Applicant, the Award is annullable on three grounds set out under Article 52(1) of the ICSID Convention because two of the members of the Tribunal refused to exercise jurisdiction and did so on two entirely different grounds which were both manifestly wrong as a matter of fact and law. In particular, the Applicant argues that:\n\n(a) the Tribunal has manifestly exceeded its powers because: (i) the Majority failed to exercise a jurisdiction that it plainly had; and (ii) the Majority failed to apply the applicable law;\n\n(b) there has been a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure because the Tribunal failed to establish a real majority rejecting jurisdiction, in violation of Article 48(1) of the ICSID Convention; and\n\n(c) the Award has failed to state the reasons on which it is based because: (i) the Award does not allow a reader to discern a logical chain of reasoning since there was in fact a clear majority in favor of jurisdiction; and (ii) the Award presents contradictory and wholly incoherent fragmented individual opinions which do not satisfy the minimum requirement to state reasons under Article 48(3) of the ICSID Convention.\n\n38.\n\nThe Applicant recognizes that the annulment mechanism is not an appeals process and that it is an extraordinary remedy to preserve the integrity of ICSID arbitration. The Applicant does not seek to substitute the view of the Committee for that of the Tribunal, but requests the Committee to decide whether the Award should be annulled on any of the pleaded grounds. If the Committee finds an annullable error, the Committee has no discretion but to annul the Award, save under exceptional circumstances which cannot relate to a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure.4\n\nApplicant\u2019s Reply, para. 34. The Applicant relies on the following cases for this proposition: *Kl\u00f6ckner Industrie-Anlagen GmbH and others v. United Republic of Cameroon and Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Camerounaise des Engrais* (ICSID Case No. ARB/81/2), Decision on Annulment, May 3, 1985 (*\"Kl\u00f6ckner I\"),* para. 179; *Amco Asia Corporation and others v. Republic of Indonesia* (ICSID Case No. ARB/81/1), Decision on Annulment of Award of June 5, 1990 and of Supplemental Award of October 17, 1990, December 3, 1992 (\"*Amco II\"),* para. 1.20, and *Victor Pey Casado and Foundation \"Presidente Allende\" v. Republic of Chile* (ICSID Case No. ARB/98/2), Decision on the Application for Annulment of the Republic of Chile, December 18, 2012 (*\"Pey Casado v. Chile\"),* para. 80.\n\n39.\n\nThe Committee\u2019s task includes a review of the Tribunal\u2019s interpretation and application of the ICSID Convention and any other relevant treaties in accordance with the principles of public international law and the rules of interpretation under customary international law.5 The Committee must scrutinize the Award to determine whether there has been an annullable error. Such scrutiny does not preclude the Committee from undertaking a review of relevant parts of the factual record in the underlying arbitration.6\n\nApplicant\u2019s Reply, para. 16.\n\n*Id.,* at para. 22.\n\n*A.*  *Manifest Excess of Powers*\n---------------------------------\n\n(i) The Applicable Standard\n---------------------------\n\n40.\n\nThe Applicant requests that the Committee should decide whether the Tribunal exceeded its powers, and whether such excess was manifest. According to the Applicant, an excess of powers includes the failure to exercise a jurisdiction bestowed by the parties upon a Tribunal and the failure to apply the rules of law agreed by the parties.7 For an excess of powers to be \"manifest,\" it must be *\"prima facie* apparent from a review of an award,\" \"self-evident\", or \"obvious and clear.\"8 The word \"manifest\" does not relate to the seriousness of the excess, but rather the ease with which it is perceived.9\n\nApplicant\u2019s Memorial, para. 86-90.\n\n*Id.,* at paras. 86-89, quoting *CDC Group pic. v.

Arab Republic of Egypt* (ICSID Case No. ARB/05/19), Decision of the *ad hoc* Committee, June 14, 2010 *(\"Helnan v. Egypt\"),* para. 55.\n\nApplicant\u2019s Memorial, para. 86.\n\n(ii) Failure to Apply the Applicable Law\n----------------------------------------\n\n41.\n\nThe Applicant states that the Tribunal identified the provisions of the BIT and of the ECT as the \"operative provisions under which the claims have been made,\" meaning that the applicable law must be determined in accordance with those provisions.10 Article 10.1 of the BIT provides that the dispute be decided \"in accordance with the applicable rules of international law.\" Similarly, the ECT refers to the provisions of the ECT itself \"and applicable rules and principles of international law.\" The Applicant argues that, despite recognizing the applicable law, both Arbitrators Park and Stern *(i.e.* the alleged Majority) did not apply it to the Parties\u2019 dispute.\n\n*Id.,* at para. 118 quoting the Award, para. 320.\n\n42.\n\nAccording to the Applicant, it is not enough for a tribunal to identify the proper law or to endeavor to apply the proper law.11 Article 42(1) of the ICSID Convention is framed in mandatory terms, stating that a tribunal \"shall decide a dispute in accordance with such rules of law as may be agreed by the parties.\" ICSID jurisprudence has held that, where a misinterpretation or misapplication of the proper law is so gross or egregious that it constitutes a failure to apply the proper law, an award should be annulled.12\n\nTranscript, Day 1, 102:3-7.\n\n*Id.,* at 101-102, referring to *Hussein Nuaman Soufraki v. United Arab Emirates* (ICSID Case No. ARB/02/7), Decision on Annulment, June 5, 2007 (*\"Soufraki v. UAE\"),* para. 86, *and Amco II,* para. 7.19.\n\n43.\n\nThe Applicant claims that in this case each of Arbitrator Park\u2019s and Stern\u2019s reasoning was \"so gross and egregious as substantially to amount to a failure to apply the proper law, therefore warranting annulment pursuant to Article 52(1)(b) of the Convention.\"13 Not only were their legal analyses mistaken, they also reached manifestly erroneous factual conclusions.14 This led to a manifest excess of powers of the Tribunal affecting the Award as a whole.\n\nApplicant\u2019s Reply, para. 58, quoting *Soufraki v. UAE,* para. 86.\n\nApplicant\u2019s Reply, para. 52.\n\na. Arbitrator Park\n------------------\n\n44.\n\nBoth the BIT and the ECT define the terms \"investor\" and \"investment.\"15 Under those definitions, it is clear that the Applicant qualifies as a Dutch \"investor,\" which was recognized by Arbitrators Stern and Lalonde in the Award and Dissent. It is equally clear that the Applicant held a qualifying \"investment\" under the provisions of the treaties, since it held shares in Atam Alapli. According to the Applicant, the evidence on the record further demonstrates that the Applicant contributed US$60,700, corresponding to 50% of the capital of Atam Alapli, by two separate transfers on March 3 and June 28, 2000.16 The Applicant thus became an \"investor\" holding an \"investment\" on March 3, 2000.\n\nUnder the BIT, an \"investor\" is \"a legal person duly incorporated, constituted or otherwise duly organized under the applicable laws and regulations of a Contracting Party\" (Article 1 (a)(ii)), and the ECT defines an \"investor\" as \"a company or other organization organized in accordance with the law applicable in that Contracting Party\" (Article 1(7)). Both the BIT and the ECT contain a broad, asset based definition of an \"investment\" (Article 1(b) of the BIT, Article 1(6) of the ECT).\n\nApplicant\u2019s Memorial, para. 133.\n\n45.\n\nAccording to the Applicant, Arbitrator Park disregarded the terms of the treaties and engaged in a legally irrelevant analysis of \"funding sources,\" finding that the Applicant merely acted \"as a conduit\" for a third party.17 Arbitrator Park went on to state that \"to be an investor a person must actually make an investment, in the sense of an active contribution.\"18 While he accepted that two transfers were made in 2000 from a bank account in the Netherlands, he concluded that the Applicant \"made no relevant contribution to the Project\" and played \"no meaningful role\" as \"any significant contribution to the Project was made either by Americans, the GE Group, or by Turkish nationals...not by the Dutch Claimant.\"19 By so doing, Arbitrator Park (i) failed to analyze the features pertaining to the Applicant\u2019s investment; (ii) introduced new qualitative requirements (that the contribution must be \"relevant\" and \"significant\" and that the investor must play a \"meaningful\" role) which had no legal basis; (iii) disregarded the evidence on the record; and (iv) applied a mistaken interpretative approach that led him to ignore the provisions of the treaties and commit a manifest jurisdictional error.20\n\n*Id.,* at para. 134, referring to Award, paras. 349, 367 and 386.\n\nAward, para. 350.\n\nApplicant\u2019s Memorial, para. 141, quoting Award, paras. 349, 362, 387 and 389.\n\n*Id.,* at paras. 142-143.\n\n46.\n\nArbitrator Park\u2019s analysis has strayed beyond any precedent or accepted legal norms, to the very sources of funding.21 Such new legal requirement presents fundamental practical concerns in the context of modern international financial transactions, since funds often originate from a party other than the investor itself.22 This approach is not supported by any jurisprudence.23 It can be compared to the erroneous interpretative approach of the tribunal in *MHS v. Malaysia*,24 An *ad hoc* committee annulled that award because it found that the tribunal had \"altogether failed to take account of and apply the [...] broad and encompassing terms [of the definition of investment in the applicable BIT] but rather limited itself to its analysis of criteria which it found to bear upon the interpretation of Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention.\"25 Arbitrator Park similarly disregarded the applicable law, leading to a manifest excess of power.26\n\nTranscript, Day 1, 114:11-15.\n\n*Id.* atp. 114:16-23\n\nThe Applicant refers to *Mobil Corporation, Venezuela Holdings, B.V, Mobil Cerro Negro Holdings, Ltd., Mobil Venezolana de Petr\u00f3leos Holdings Inc., Mobil Cerro Negro Holding Ltd. and Mobil Venezolana de Petr\u00f3leos, Inc. v.

Arbitrator Stern\n-------------------\n\n47.\n\nAccording to the Applicant, Arbitrator Stern also disregarded the relevant provisions of the BIT and the ECT and neglected, or at the least manifestly misinterpreted, the facts and evidence that were presented to the Tribunal.27 Finding that the facts were similar to those in *Mobil v. Venezuela,*28 Arbitrator Stern proceeded to examine whether the relevant corporate restructuring was made in good faith. She found that the introduction of the Applicant in the investment chain was made to access international arbitration at a time when the \"facts at the root of the dispute presented to the Tribunal were already known.\"29 In her opinion, this constituted an abuse of the system of international investment protection under the ICSID/BIT/ECT mechanism and the investment could therefore not be protected under the provisions of these treaties.30\n\nApplicant\u2019s Memorial, para. 155.\n\n*Mobil v. Venezuela,* cited at para. 400 of the Award.\n\nAward, para. 393.\n\n*Id.,* at para. 417.\n\n48.\n\nIt is a well-established principle of international law that an investor may restructure its investment so as to benefit from investment treaty protection before a dispute arises.31 In this case, it is clear that the dispute crystallized in 2002, long after the Applicant had become an \"investor\" for the purposes of the BIT and ECT.32 According to the Applicant, Arbitrator Stern herself acknowledged that a dispute had yet to arise at the time of the restructuring.33 She stated at paragraph 406 of the Award that the dispute was merely a \"probability\", albeit a \"high probability.\" The Applicant further argues that the evidence on the record demonstrates that the corporate restructuring in this case \"was a strategy devised approximately two years before the dispute crystallised as a means of obtaining certain diverse benefits\"34 The situation is not analogous to the *Mobil v. Venezuela* case, which concerned claims that arose before the claimants acquired the required nationality and with respect to which they had already sent a letter to Venezuela seeking amicable settlement of the dispute.35\n\nApplicant\u2019s Reply, paras. 75 and 79; Transcript, Day 1, pp. 117-118, referring to *ConocoPhillips Petrozuata B.V., ConocoPhillips Hamaca B.V. and ConocoPhillips Gulf of Paria B.V. v.

She also grossly and egregiously misapplied the law to the facts on the record, requiring the annulment of the Award.39 This conclusion is supported by the fact that Arbitrators Park and Lalonde explicitly disagreed with Arbitrator Stern\u2019s conclusion.\n\n*Id.,* at paras. 171-172, referring to *Mavrommatis Palestine Concessions (Greece v.

Each of Arbitrators Park and Stern therefore manifestly exceeded their powers. This culminated in an award that failed to exercise the jurisdiction bestowed on the Tribunal, meaning that the Majority manifestly exceeded its powers.40 The Applicant contends that if the Committee decides that only one of the arbitrators making up the Majority manifestly exceeded his/her powers, the Award must still be annulled under Article 52(1)(b) of the Convention.41\n\nApplicant\u2019s Reply, para. 54.\n\n*id.*\n\n*B.*  *Serious Departure from a Fundamental Rule of Procedure*\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n(i) The Applicable Standard\n---------------------------\n\n51.\n\nThe Applicant states that *ad hoc* committees have consistently recognized that there are two self-standing aspects to the standard under Article 52(1)(d).42 The first consists of an examination whether the tribunal departed from a \"fundamental rule of procedure.\" Second, it has to be shown that the departure was \"serious.\" While the ICSID Convention and Arbitration Rules do not define these terms, *ad hoc* Committees have considered them in the past. They have observed that a fundamental rule of procedure relates to the essential fairness of the proceeding, e.g. the tribunal\u2019s impartiality and meaningful deliberation.43 In order for the departure to be \"serious,\" (i) there must be a deprivation of a party\u2019s benefit or protection; and (ii) it must have a material effect on the outcome of the dispute.44\n\nApplicant\u2019s Memorial, para. 50.\n\n*Id.,* at paras. 51-54, citing *Wena v. Egypt,* para. 57 and *CDC v. Seychelles,* para. 49.\n\n*Id.,* at para. 58, citing Christoph H. Schreuer with Loretta Malintoppi, August Reinisch and Anthony Sinclair, THE ICSID CONVENTION: A COMMENTARY (2d ed. 2009) (\"Schreuer, ICSID CONVENTION\") p. 982. The Applicant also cites Bishop and Marchili, *Annulment under the ICSID Convention* (Oxford, 2012), para. 8.16, claiming that the key point is that the departure must entail \"a sense of gravity, which can be identified by the existence of a concrete consequence attributable to it.\" *See* Applicant\u2019s Memorial, para. 59.\n\n52.\n\nOn Applicant\u2019s submission, there can be no doubt that the international law principle embedded in Article 48(1) of the ICSID Convention that \"[t]he Tribunal shall decide questions by a majority of the votes of all its members\" constitutes a fundamental rule of procedure. In addition, Article 48(3) of the Convention requires that \"[t]he award shall deal with every question submitted to the Tribunal, and shall state the reasons upon which it is based.\" These rules of procedure are obligatory and binding on the Tribunal.45 Even if they were discretionary, there is no support for the proposition that a fundamental rule of procedure needs to be a non-discretionary, obligatory procedural norm that is binding on the Tribunal.46\n\nTranscript, Day 1, 25:15-24.\n\n*Id.,* at 24:6-19. The Applicant states that, according to *Azurix Corp. v. Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/01/12), Decision on the Application for Annulment, September 1, 2009, the exercise of discretion can call for annulment under Article 52(1)(d) if it \"amounts to a serious departure from another rule of procedure of a fundamental nature\", para. 210.\n\n53.\n\nAs a result, an ICSID tribunal must decide all of the questions submitted to it, and must do so by a majority vote. The ICSID Convention and the Arbitration Rules do not recognize any system of outcome-based voting.47 If only the dispositive decision mattered, tribunals would never have to give any reasoning for their decisions, which would go against the clear and mandatory wording of Article 48(3) of the Convention.48 The Convention mandates that voting should always be on relevant \"questions\" or \"issues.\"49 This obligation is limited to the questions presented by the parties, *i.e.,* it does not extend to all arguments, reasons or assertions made by the parties.50 For example, when a tribunal is faced with an objection to jurisdiction *ratione materiae,* it must decide by a majority vote the question whether there was a qualifying investment. However, it need not decide by majority vote whether there was a contribution, a risk and certain duration of the commitment to funds, unless the parties put those issues before the tribunal as questions that it has to decide.51\n\nTranscript, Day 1, 42:4-6.\n\n*Id.* at p. 42:19-23.\n\nApplicant\u2019s Reply, para. 98. This is also made clear by Note D to Arbitration Rule 47 of 1968, which provides that \"[c]onsideration has been given to the formulation of a provision to cover the contingency that a Tribunal might be unable to reach a majority decision *on an issue,* in particular on the amount of damages to be awarded\".\n\nTranscript, Day 2, 18:21-25.\n\n*Id.* at 18:12-20.\n\n54.\n\nThe parties thus retain control over the questions that the tribunal must answer in the award. This is supported by the wording of ICSID Arbitration Rule 47(1)(i), which provides that the award shall contain \"the decision of the Tribunal on every question submitted to it.\"52 A tribunal\u2019s conclusions do not trump its decisions on the questions that the parties have submitted to it.53 According to the Applicant, the Respondent\u2019s legal expert confirmed that the parties retain control over aspects of the proceedings, although not absolute control.54\n\n*Id.,* at 28:17-20\n\n*Id.,* at 31:6-11.\n\nTranscript, Day 2, 28:5-9, Second Judge Simma Opinion, para. 48.\n\n55.\n\nThe principle of a majority decision is present in a vast majority of international judicial and arbitral bodies, including in Article 55 of the Statute of the International Court of Justice. The requirement of a true majority is therefore the very core of the international arbitral process.55 Because the Respondent admits this principle (paras. 147-148 of its Counter-Memorial), in the Applicant\u2019s submission, the only question for this Committee is to decide whether the Tribunal seriously departed from Article 48(1) of the ICSID Convention when it rendered the Award.56\n\nApplicant\u2019s Memorial, para. 95.\n\nTranscript, Day 1, 27:12-16.\n\n56.\n\nThe Applicant submits that, once a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure is established, an *ad hoc* committee does not have any choice but to annul the award, since the discretion lies in the evaluation of the impact made when considering whether the departure was \"serious.\"57\n\nApplicant\u2019s Memorial, para. 60, citing Pey *Casado v. Chile,* para. 80.\n\n(ii) Failure to Decide by Majority\n----------------------------------\n\n57.\n\nAccording to the Applicant, the Parties had submitted three jurisdictional questions to the Tribunal: (i) whether the Tribunal had jurisdiction *ratione personae;* (ii) whether the Tribunal had jurisdiction *ratione materiae;* and (iii) whether the Tribunal had jurisdiction *ratione temporis*,58 The Applicant points to its own and the Respondent\u2019s submissions in the underlying arbitration to show that the Parties had specifically addressed these three questions.59 The Applicant argues that, although the Majority concluded that it had no jurisdiction, the Tribunal failed to establish a real majority rejecting jurisdiction with respect to the three questions.\n\nTranscript, Day 1, 28:3-8.\n\nExhibits C-277, C-278, C-279, C-298, C-299,C -300 and C-301.\n\n58.\n\nThe Majority stated as follows:\n\nThe Majority has found Claimant not entitled to protection under either the Energy Charter Treaty or the Netherlands-Turkey BIT. For Arbitrator Stern this conclusion derives from notions of timing and bona fides, considering that Claimant did not make an investment until after the root of the controversy was evident and the dispute itself had become a high probability. For Arbitrator Park, the Claimant simply lacks the status of an investor, for want of any contribution to the Alapli Project.60\n\nAward, para. 315.\n\n59.\n\nThe Tribunal thus explicitly recognized that there was no agreement between Arbitrators Park and Stern, resulting in a jurisdictional rejection which was \"made on the basis of a fictional \u2018majority\u2019 which agreed on no single ground for its conclusion.\"61\n\nApplicant\u2019s Memorial, para. 97.\n\n60.\n\nThe Applicant submits that the actual majority decision on each relevant jurisdictional requirement, *i.e.* on jurisdiction *ratione personae, ratione materiae* and *ratione temporis,* found in favor of jurisdiction. The Applicant illustrates this in a table showing the real majority on each of the issues:62\n\n|  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | Jurisdiction *ratione* *personae* | Jurisdiction *ratione* *materiae* | Jurisdiction *ratione temporis* |\n| Arbitrator Park | No | No | Yes (Award, para. 386) |\n| Arbitrator Lalonde | Yes (Dissent, para. 4) | Yes (Dissent, para. 10) | Yes (Dissent, para. 58) |\n| Arbitrator Stern | Yes (Award, para. 390) | Yes (Award, para. 390) | No |\n| **Actual Majority** | **Jurisdiction exists** | **Jurisdiction exists** | **Jurisdiction exists** |\n\n*Id.,* at para. 102. The table in this Decision includes the Applicant\u2019s references to the Members\u2019 positive findings on jurisdiction in the Award and Dissent; Applicant\u2019s Memorial, paras. 99-101.\n\n61.\n\nAccording to the Applicant, had the Tribunal voted on each of the questions presented by the Parties, it would have reached a substantially different result in favor of jurisdiction.63\n\nApplicant\u2019s Memorial, para. 103; Applicant\u2019s Reply, para. 105.\n\n62.\n\nThe Applicant concedes that separate opinions are permitted pursuant to Article 48(4) of the Convention, but argues that they can only exist in relation to a majority award issued pursuant to Article 48(1) of the Convention.64 An individual opinion must be \"attached\" to a majority award, not to another individual opinion. The individual opinions cannot simply coincide in the same result: they must coincide on each of the questions presented to the Tribunal.65 It is clear from the ICSID Convention that there must be a majority award based on majority reasoning, *i.e.* Article 48(4) cannot be used to circumvent Article 48(1) and (3).66 In this case, Arbitrators Park and Stern\u2019s opinions were divergent, joined together in form (i.e. in a single document), but disjointed in substance.67 They cannot be viewed as individual opinions under Article 48(4) of the ICSID Convention or Arbitration Rule 47(3) because they are part of the Award.68\n\nApplicant\u2019s Reply, para. 118.\n\n*Id.,* at para. 120.\n\nTranscript, Day 1, 43:8-15.\n\nApplicant\u2019s Reply, para. 136.\n\nTranscript, Day 2, 39:7-15.\n\n63.\n\nAsa result, because Arbitrators Park and Stern reached contradictory findings on each of the constituent elements of the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction and concluded that jurisdiction was lacking, the Tribunal failed to render an award that was in compliance with Article 48(1) of the ICSID Convention, read together with Article 48(3). Because the departure caused the Tribunal to reach a result substantially different from what would have resulted had the Tribunal voted by majority on each of the jurisdictional questions submitted by the Parties, the departure must be considered as \"serious.\"69 Therefore, all the requirements of Article 52(1)(d) of the Convention are met.\n\nTranscript, Day 1, 50:7-16.\n\nC. *Failure to State Reasons*\n-----------------------------\n\n(i) The Applicable Standard\n---------------------------\n\n64.\n\nArticle 48(3) of the ICSID Convention provides that \"[t]he award shall deal with every question submitted to the Tribunal, and shall state the reasons upon which it is based.\" Arbitration Rule 47(1)(i) restates the requirement that an award must contain \"the reasons upon which the decision is based.\" Read in conjunction with Article 52(1)(e) of the Convention, it is clear that this is an imperative, mandatory requirement.70 These provisions of the ICSID Convention and Arbitration Rules set out a minimum standard requiring that an award, as a whole, provide coherent and adequate reasoning.71\n\n*Id.,* at 53:14-18.\n\n*Id.,* at 59:19-25.\n\n65.\n\nThe Applicant submits that, although *ad hoc* committees have found that Article 52(1)(e) of the Convention \"does not require that each reason be stated expressly,\"72 \"a failure to deal with a question which would have altered an important finding of the tribunal or would have rendered the award unintelligible\"73 does amount to a failure to state reasons. If reasons are essentially lacking on a particular point and that point is necessary to the tribunal\u2019s decision, the award is annullable. In addition, as stated in *Lucchetti v. Peru,* a tribunal\u2019s reasoning must allow the parties to ascertain \"whether or to what extent a tribunal\u2019s findings are sufficiently based on the law and on a proper evaluation of the relevant facts.\"74\n\nApplicant\u2019s Memorial, para. 63, quoting *Wena v. Egypt,* para. 81.\n\n*Id.,* quoting *Rumeli Telekom AS and Telsim Mobil Telekomunikasyon Hizmetleri AS v. Kazakhstan* (ICSID Case No. ARB/05/16), Decision of the *ad hoc* Committee on the Application for Annulment, March 25, 2010 *(\u2018Rumeli v.

Peru\"),* para. 98.\n\n66.\n\nThe lack of reasons can thus be demonstrated through a tribunal\u2019s failure to provide adequate reasons or logical sequence of reasons, or through a tribunal\u2019s contradictory or wholly incoherent reasoning.75 The Applicant submits that the Award is defective on both accounts.\n\n*Id.,* at paras. 64-65. *See* *Compania de Aguas del Aconquija S.A. and Vivendi Universal v. Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/97/3), Decision on Annulment, July 3, 2002 (*\"Vivendi I\"),* para. 65.\n\n(ii) No Adequate Reasons or Logical Sequence of Reasons\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n67.\n\nAn award must allow a reader to determine a logical chain of reasoning. This means that there has to be a connection between the deliberations of the tribunal members and the tribunal\u2019s ultimate conclusion.76 In this case, there was no logical chain of reasoning discernible from a plain reading of the opinions of the Majority. Read together with the Dissent, the actual majority should have assumed jurisdiction under the BIT and the ECT. Because of the gap of reasoning created by the conclusions of Arbitrators Park and Stern, the reader was unable to determine how the Tribunal got from \"point A\" to Point B\" and then to its conclusion. The Applicant states that:\n\n[h]ad the Tribunal complied with the fundamental rule to reach a genuine majority as per Article 48(1) of the Convention, both Arbitrators Stern and Park should have realized that their jurisdictional \"routes\" would never meet at a common conclusion (to adopt the reasoning in the *MINE* decision cited in paragraph 67 above).77\n\nApplicant\u2019s Memorial para. 110.\n\n*Id.,* at para. 113; *MINE v. Guinea,* paras. 5.08 and 5.09.\n\n68.\n\nIt is irrelevant that each line of reasoning is coherent or that the reader can \"trace the logic of how each arbitrator reached the majority conclusions within his or her own line of reasoning.\"78 The adequacy of the reasons supplied in the separate opinions cannot be evaluated independently. What matters for the test under Article 52(1)(e) of the Convention is whether the Tribunal \"identi[fied] and [...] let the parties know, the factual and legal premises leading the *Tribunal* to its decision.\"79 In this case, because there is no reasoning of the Tribunal as a whole, a reader is unable to follow the reasoning of the Tribunal on points of fact and law. The minimum requirement to determine \"how the tribunal proceeded from Point A. to Point B. and eventually to its conclusion is not met here, as the Majority agreed on a conclusion and then assembled an award out of two entirely separate and independent opinions.\n\nApplicant\u2019s Reply, para. 161, quoting Respondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial, para. 209 (emphasis added or omitted).\n\n*Id.,* at para. 165, quoting *Wena v. Egypt,* para. 79.\n\n69.\n\nHowever, even if each of Arbitrator Park\u2019s and Stern\u2019s opinions were to be evaluated independently, neither of the opinions allows the Applicant to determine whether and to what extent the reasoning is based on the law and a proper analysis of the relevant facts, as required under the *Lucchetti v. Peru* standard (for the deficiencies *see* above, paragraphs 44-49).80\n\nTranscript, Day 1, 79-96.\n\n(iii) Contradictory and Incoherent Reasoning\n--------------------------------------------\n\n70.\n\nOne of the first *ad hoc* committees in *Kl\u00f6ckner I* established that contradictory or wholly incoherent reasons amount to a failure to state reasons under Article 52(1)(e).81 This is because contradictory reasons are as useful as no reasons.82\n\nApplicant\u2019s Memorial, para. 69, quoting *Kl\u00f6ckner I,* para. 116.\n\n*Id.,* at para. 70, quoting Schreuer, ICSID CONVENTION, p. 1011.\n\n71.\n\nOn the Applicant\u2019s submission, \"Arbitrator Park and Stern\u2019s opinions, read together with Arbitrator Lalonde\u2019s dissent, are inherently contradictory and incoherent.\"83 The opinions are not \"overlapping\" in nature, as stated in the Award.84 They are not even complementary, as they are irreconcilably different and in conflict.85 The purported majority contradicted each other in that:\n\n(a) \"Arbitrator Park determined that there was no jurisdiction on the basis of the Applicant not being an \"investor\" with a qualifying \"investment\" in Turkey. Arbitrator Stern explicitly refuted this, noting that \u2018there is indeed in this case a foreign investor which is the owner of an investment (fn referring to Award, para. 390);\n\n(b) Arbitrator Stern determined that there was no jurisdiction on the basis that \u2018the introduction of the Dutch company in the investment chain was, at the time it was performed, an abuse of the system of international investment protection under the ICSID/BIT/ECT mechanism.\u2019 (fn referring to Award para. 390) Arbitrator Park disagreed, labeling it \u2018legitimate corporate planning.\u2019\"86\n\nApplicant\u2019s Memorial, para. 73.\n\nApplicant\u2019s Reply, para. 157.\n\nTranscript, Day 1, 64:3-21. The Applicant notes that the Respondent\u2019s legal expert admitted that the separate opinions of Arbitrators Park and Stern reflect \"conflicting considerations.\" Transcript, Day 1, 68:22-24.\n\nApplicant\u2019s Memorial, para. 108.\n\n72.\n\nThe fact that Arbitrator Park\u2019s and Stern\u2019s opinions are conflicting is important because, for the purposes of Article 52(1)(e) of the Convention, contradictory reasons cancel each other out. There is no nexus between the opinions and the outcome at the end of the Award, leading to a fundamental and manifest *lacuna* in the Award. That *lacuna* calls for the annulment of the Award for failure to state reasons.87 The Applicant states that the Convention \"does not permit the majority arbitrators to draft two separate and inconsistent opinions based on entirely different factual and legal elements, articulate a conclusion and package the result into a document entitled \u2018Award.\u2019\"88\n\nApplicant\u2019s Reply, para. 155.\n\n*Id.,* at para. 159.\n\n**2. Respondent\u2019s Position**\n----------------------------\n\n73.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the Application is nothing more than an improper attempt to appeal the Tribunal\u2019s Award. In its view, a party cannot resort to annulment to remedy what it considers to be an incorrect decision or to review awards for alleged errors in fact or law, which is in effect what the Applicant is seeking to do.89 The purpose of the annulment mechanism is to \"police the integrity of the award and of the process leading to the award,\" not to review the substantive correctness of the award.90 The Respondent agrees with the Applicant that annulment is a \"control mechanism to preserve the integrity of ICSID arbitration,\" but it submits that such mechanism must strike a balance between the interests of finality, on one side, and substantive correctness, on the other side.91 Because the grounds for annulment are narrowly circumscribed, the resolution must lean in favor of finality of the Award.92\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial, para. 115.\n\n*Id.,* quoting Andrea K. Bjorklund, *The Continuing Appeal of Annulment: Lessons from Amco Asia and CME,* in International Investment Law and Arbitration: Leading Cases from the ICSID, NAFTA, Bilateral Treaties and Customary International Law (T.

The Respondent states that, in this case, the Applicant asks the Committee to go beyond its mandate to review the factual record and to correct alleged errors of law.\n\n*Id.,* at para. 55, quoting Applicant\u2019s Reply, para. 16.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial, para. 8.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Rejoinder, para. 74, referring to *Rumeli v. Kazakhstan,* para. 96 and *CDC v. Seychelles,* para. 77.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial, para. 9.\n\n75.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, it is generally accepted that *ad hoc* committees are not required to annul even where they find an annullable error. They have discretion to find in favor of an award, for example when there is doubt whether or not a tribunal has manifestly exceeded its powers.97 This discretion in exercising an *ad hoc* committee\u2019s authority to annul has been endorsed by ICSID jurisprudence and by legal commentators.98\n\n*Id.,* at para 116, referring to *Kl\u00f6ckner I,* para. 52(e).\n\n*Id.,* referring to *Soufraki v.

UAE,* para. 40.\n\n*Id.,* quoting *Patrick Mitchell v. Democratic Republic of the Congo* (ICSID Case No. ARB/99/7), Decision on Annulment, November 1, 2006, para. 20.\n\n(ii) Failure to Apply the Applicable Law\n----------------------------------------\n\n78.\n\nThe Respondent notes that the Applicant admits that the Majority identified and cited to the proper law: the BIT, the ECT and \"applicable rules and principles of international law.\"102 According to the Respondent, the annulment inquiry should stop at that point. There is an important distinction between the failure to apply the proper law (which the Respondent agrees is a ground for annulment) and the misinterpretation or erroneous application of the proper law (which the Respondent submits is not a ground for annulment).103 The substantive correctness of the analysis of the proper law is irrelevant because it goes beyond the inquiry whether there was any flaw in the legitimacy of the process of decision.104 If an *ad hoc* committee finds that the tribunal \"endeavored\" or \"str[ove] to apply the relevant law in good faith\" it must be satisfied that the tribunal did apply the proper law.105 In this case, the Applicant seeks to annul the award on an alleged incorrect application of the proper law, which must be distinguished and denied.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial, paras. 222-224.\n\n*Id.,* at para. 223.\n\n*Id.,* at para. 224\n\nRespondent\u2019s Rejoinder, para. 94, citing *CDC v. Seychelles,* para. 45 and *Soufraki v. UAE,* para. 97.\n\n79.\n\nThe Respondent states that the Applicant has failed to point to any instance where Arbitrator Park and Arbitrator Stern applied the wrong body of law or failed to \"endeavor\" or \"strive\" to apply the proper law. To the contrary, on Respondent\u2019s submission, the Tribunal was very clear as to the applicable law. It set forth in detail the key treaty provisions, explained the principles of treaty interpretation that it would apply and stated its understanding of the object and purpose of the ECT and the BIT, which included the principle that a tribunal should not \"facilitate the use of treaties by persons not intended to receive their benefits.\"106\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial, para. 91; Award, para. 334.\n\n80.\n\nIt is also clear that the Tribunal did apply the law that it had identified. Arbitrator Park interpreted the words \"investor\" and \"investment\" as used in the ECT and the BIT and concluded that an \"investment\" requires some form of active or meaningful contribution.107 This legal analysis was, in Arbitrator Park\u2019s view, supported by two ICSID awards.108 He proceeded to a factual analysis, placing particular weight on testimony by one of Applicant\u2019s witnesses to arrive at the conclusion that the Applicant had made no contribution to the Alapli Project.\n\n*Id.,* at para. 93; Award, paras. 350, 352 and 360.\n\nAward, paras. 381-384, citing *Salini Costruttori S.p.A, and Italstrade S.p.A. v.

Republic of Lebanon* (ICSID Case No. ARB/07/12), Decision on Jurisdiction, September 11, 2009 *(\"Toto Costruzioni v. Lebanon\").*\n\n81.\n\nArbitrator Stern focused her legal analysis on whether the structuring of the investment in this case was legitimate corporate planning or if it was aimed at creating access to ICSID jurisdiction and thus constituted an abuse of the ICSID system. She also referred to two ICSID awards in support of the principle that the structuring of an investment could amount to an abuse.109 She undertook a factual analysis of the circumstances, especially with regard to the timing of the Applicant\u2019s investment, and concluded that the Applicant made the alleged investment as part of an illegitimate effort to manufacture international investor-State jurisdiction at a time when the dispute with the Respondent was already a high probability.110 She thus found that the Applicant was precluded from invoking the rights under the BIT or the ECT.\n\nAward, paras. 391-392, citing *Mobil v Venezuela* and *Phoenix Action Ltd v.

Even if the *ad hoc* Committee were to find that \"gross and egregious\" misapplication of law can rise to the level of non-application of the proper law, that exception is subject to an extraordinarily high standard which is not met here.111 The Applicant has not demonstrated a misinterpretation of the facts and the law so gross and egregious so as to amount to a failure to apply the proper law in its entirety.112 To meet this standard, the Applicant would have to show that the \"Tribunal\u2019s legal analysis was so untenable or implausible that the error is evident on the face of the award.\"113 The standard cannot be met by a mere showing that some tribunals have adopted a different interpretation than the Tribunal in this case. The Applicant would need to prove that its interpretation is a monolithic and firmly settled principle of law that is \"not subject to debate.\"114 The Applicant is unable to show this because both Arbitrator Park\u2019s and Stern\u2019s legal analyses are in line with other ICSID awards that have adopted treaty interpretations and applied substantially similar legal principles.115\n\nRespondent\u2019s Rejoinder, paras. 103-104.\n\nTranscript, Day 1, 131 :9-19.\n\n*Id,* at 162:11-14.\n\n*Id.,* at 162-163; Respondent\u2019s Rejoinder, para. 112, citing *M.C.I. Power Group, L.C. and New Turbine, Inc. v. Republic of Ecuador* (ICSID Case No. ARB/03/6), Decision on Annulment, October 19, 2009, para. 52. The Respondent adds that even a novel analysis does not have to be grossly and egregiously wrong. *See* Transcript, Day 1, 173:5-9.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Rejoinder, paras. 131-143 and 172-186.\n\n(iii) Failure to Exercise an Existing Jurisdiction\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n83.\n\nA decision to decline jurisdiction where jurisdiction exists may constitute an excess of powers, but a jurisdictional mistake is not necessarily a manifest excess of powers.116 Several *ad hoc* committees have noted that the language of Article 52(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention does not make any exception for issues of jurisdiction, rejecting the argument that all jurisdictional errors are by their nature \"manifest.\"117\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial, para. 230.\n\n*Id.,* referring to *Luchetti v. Peru,* para. 101, an *d* *Soufraki v. UAE,* paras. 118-119.\n\n84.\n\nIn this case, the Tribunal did not manifestly fail to exercise jurisdiction that it possessed. The Respondent states that:\n\n[a]t a minimum, President Park\u2019s and Arbitrator Stern\u2019s reasoning was a plausible interpretation of two international investment law concepts that have been subject to extensive debate and wide-ranging viewpoints in recent years: the proper definition of an \"investment,\" and abuse of rights to access the ICSID system [...].118\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial, para. 232.\n\n85.\n\nIn the Respondent\u2019s view, both Arbitrator Park\u2019s and Stern\u2019s reasoning is sound and well supported by ICSID jurisprudence and international law. Their factual findings cannot be re-evaluated in the annulment proceeding because it is not within the powers of an *ad hoc* committee to conduct its own fact-finding investigation. Indeed, overturning the Tribunal\u2019s substantive application of the law or fact-finding would seriously undermine the legitimacy of the annulment mechanism.119\n\nRespondent\u2019s Rejoinder, para. 215.\n\n86.\n\nHowever, even if a committee did possess the authority to overturn or re-evaluate a tribunal\u2019s fact-finding, there would be no justification for doing so here. There were two key factual findings in the award: (i) that the dispute involved a Turkish national who internationalized a previously domestic business venture when he saw a dispute looming with his own government; and (ii) that Alapli Elektrik B.V. failed to make any active contribution to the project or incur any investment risk.120 Both of these factual findings were reasonable and well supported by the record.121 The Tribunal took into account both Parties\u2019 evidence and submissions, including their responses to the Tribunal\u2019s questions of August 8, 2011 concerning one of these issues.122 The evidence that the Applicant submitted not only failed to convince the Tribunal of the *bona fides* of its investment, it featured in Arbitrator Park\u2019s analysis for why the Applicant had failed to show any active contribution.123 As to Arbitrator Stern, she made detailed factual findings on the issue of a good faith investment consistent with the core factual determination.124\n\nTranscript, Day 1, 145:19-23 and 154:15-18.\n\n*Id,* at 145-160.\n\n*Id.,* at 159:8-19. Following the Parties\u2019 responses, the Applicant was granted the opportunity to file additional evidence concerning the issue of contribution of funds. *See* Exhibits C-273 - C-275.\n\n*Id.,* at 159: 19-23.\n\n*Id.,* at 154:5-10.\n\n*B.*  *Serious Departure from a fundamental Rule of Procedure*\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n(i) Applicable Standard\n-----------------------\n\n87.\n\nThe Respondent agrees with the Applicant that Article 52(1)(d) of the ICSID Convention requires the identification of a \"fundamental rule of procedure\" from which the Tribunal has departed and a showing that the departure has been \"serious.\"125 It stresses that this ground for annulment pertains to rules of natural justice that concern the essential fairness of the process, as opposed to all procedural rules.126 The rule of procedure must be obligatory and binding on the tribunal as a matter of international law, as opposed to a rule that vests discretion in the tribunal.127\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial, para. 121.\n\n*Id.*\n\nRespondent\u2019s Rejoinder, para. 217.\n\n88.\n\nThe Respondent thus argues that the test is not only a two-pronged test, but includes the showing by the Applicant of the following elements: (i) a non-discretionary, obligatory procedural norm that is binding on the Tribunal; (ii) that is \"fundamental\"; (iii) and a departure from that rule; (iv) that is \"serious.\"128\n\n*Id.,* at para. 220.\n\n(ii) Failure to Decide by Majority\n----------------------------------\n\n89.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the Applicant misinterprets the majority rule in Article 48(1) of the ICSID Convention and misconstrues the Tribunal\u2019s Award.\n\n90.\n\nThe term \"questions\" for the purposes of Article 48(1) of the Convention is not synonymous to the term \"every question\" in Article 48(3).129 This is evident from the French and Spanish texts of Article 48. The French uses the word *\"questions\"* in Article 48(1) but *\"chefs de conclusions\"* in Article 48(3). The Spanish uses *\"cuestiones\"* in Article 48(1) but *\"pretensiones\"* in Article 48(3).130 Thus, under Article 48(3), the issues that a tribunal must \"deal with\" are \"more detailed, particularized, and numerous\" than the questions that it must decide under Article 48(1).131 The questions under Article 48(1) relate to more general and overarching issues.132\n\nRespondent\u2019s Rejoinder, para. 240; Transcript, Day 1, 195:6-9.\n\nTranscript, Day 1, 195:9-24.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Rejoinder, para. 241.\n\n*Id.,* at para. 244.\n\n91.\n\nA distinction must be made between the \"result\" or \"outcome,\" which is the final disposition of the Tribunal that is put to a vote, and the \"reasoning\" that leads to an individual arbitrator reach that result or outcome.133 Tribunals need not address, much less vote upon, each and every argument raised by the parties.134 Where the parties do not submit an agreed list of \"questions\" that the tribunal must decide by majority, the tribunal itself has discretion to determine the granularity of the \"questions\" which are put to a vote.135 As the *CDC v. Seychelles ad hoc* committee stated:\n\nThe specific terminology used by the Republic in its Memorial cannot define the quest the Tribunal was obliged to answer. Rather, the Tribunal was required to answer a legal question, or to put it another way, come to a conclusion about the Parties\u2019 rights and liabilities.136\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial, para. 134.\n\n*Id.,* at para. 102.\n\n*Id.,* at para. 101.\n\n*CDC v. Seychelles,* para. 57; Respondent\u2019s Opening Statement, slide 20.\n\n92.\n\nBecause the Parties\u2019 requests for relief were very general as to jurisdiction in this case, the relevant \"question\" which the Tribunal had to decide by a majority of votes was whether the Tribunal had jurisdiction to entertain the Applicant\u2019s claims.137\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial, para. 103, quoting Judge Simma\u2019s Opinion at para. 23.\n\n93.\n\nEven under the Applicant\u2019s theory that the Tribunal had to decide *every* question by majority vote, the Tribunal would need to decide the general question whether there was jurisdiction, as opposed to only deciding on the constituent elements of jurisdiction. There would otherwise be a contradiction under the Applicant\u2019s interpretation of Article 48, because that general question is also a question.138\n\nTranscript, Day 1, 198:11-18.\n\n94.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the Applicant wrongly focused on \"constituent grounds\" for purposes of the majority vote, suggesting that the Tribunal must vote by majority on each of the requirements of jurisdiction *ratione personae, ratione materiae* and *ratione temporis.* The Applicant\u2019s table in this respect is misleading and inaccurate, if only because the Majority makes no reference to the terms *ratione personae, ratione materiae* and *ratione temporis139* Under this voting theory, it could be argued that the Tribunal should go a level deeper and vote on every requirement (contribution, risk and duration) for *e.g.* the existence of an investment.140 This approach means that the Tribunal would need to vote on every single step of their factual and legal analysis.141\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial, para. 98.\n\nTranscript, Day 1, 192:3-24.\n\n*Id.,*.. at 193:2-4.\u2019\n\n95.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, the Majority\u2019s position in the Award is clear. It sets forth the overlapping legal analyses of two arbitrators who were in full agreement on the appropriate resolution of the Applicant\u2019s claims, concluding that \"jurisdiction is clearly absent.\" The Respondent presents the following table depicting the majority vote:142\n\n![](http://img.jusmundi.com/image/decision/d0ac092b986d3bc0cac76886f3386f87be9fe091.png)\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial, para. 111.\n\n96.\n\nThe Respondent refers to a seminal case before the International Court of Justice (\"ICJ\"), which rejected a similar argument as that made by the Applicant. In *Guinea-Bissau* v. *Senegal,*143 a three-member arbitral tribunal rendered an award that contained a dissent and a separate declaration from the presiding arbitrator. The majority had answered one question presented by the Parties in the affirmative, with the president indicating in his declaration that he would have given a \"partially affirmative and partially negative\" reply, which he admitted would have significantly changed the outcome of the case. The ICJ dismissed Guinea-Bissau\u2019s challenge that the award was inexistent because it was not supported by a real majority, declaring that:\n\nAs the practice of international tribunals shows, it sometimes happens that a member of a tribunal votes in favour of a decision of the tribunal even though he might individually have been inclined to prefer another solution. *The validity of his vote remains unaffected by the expression of any such differences* in a declaration or separate opinion of the member concerned, which are therefore *without consequence for the decision of the tribunal.144*\n\nArbitral Award of 31 July 1989 (Guinea-Bissau v. Senegal), 19911.C.J. 53 (November 12) *(\"Guinea-Bissau\").* The Respondent stresses the importance of this case in particular because the Statute of the ICJ contains similar provisions to those contained in Article 48 of the ICSID Convention. Article 55 of the Statute provides: \"All questions shall be decided by a majority of the judges present.\" Article 57 provides: \"If the judgment does not represent in whole or in part the unanimous opinion of the judges, any judge shall be entitled to deliver a separate opinion.\"\n\n*Guinea-Bissau,* p. 64-65 (emphasis added by the Respondent), cited in Respondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial, para. 158.\n\n97.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, Article 48(1) of the Convention must be read together with Article 48(4), which provides that \"any member of the Tribunal may attach his individual opinion to the award, whether he dissents from the majority or not, or a statement of his dissent.\" The Respondent quotes Prof. Schreuer as to the interplay between these two provisions:\n\nA majority vote is not affected by an apparent contradiction contained in a declaration or individual opinion (see paras. 92-106 *infra)* made by a member who has voted in favour of the decision. A member of the tribunal may vote for an award not because he or she wholly agrees with it but because he or she feels that it is necessary to provide a majority.145\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial, para. 129, quoting Schreuer, ICSID CONVENTION, at Article 48, para. 17.\n\n98.\n\nA majority\u2019s conclusion cannot be invalidated because of alleged contradictions between \"separate opinions\" of arbitrators forming the majority, as this would undermine the legitimacy of the majority vote.146 The language of Article 48(4) is broad and permissive, authorizing any member of the tribunal to submit a separate opinion, whether that member joins the majority or dissents. This means that arbitrators comprising the majority are permitted to submit separate opinions with independent reasoning.147 Concurring opinions which express some level of disagreement between members of the majority are an established part of the ICSID system.148 It would defeat the purpose of Article 48(4) if concurring arbitrators were restricted to using their separate opinions only to describe how they embrace or vote in favor of the legal reasoning of the other arbitrators.149\n\n*Id.,* at para. 130.\n\n*Id.,* at para. 133.\n\n*Id.,* at paras. 138-144, referring, *inter alia,* to *American Manufacturing & Trading, Inc. v.

Reasons may be implicit provided that they can be reasonably inferred.151*Ad hoc* committees have held that tribunals \"must be allowed a degree of discretion as to the way in which they express their reasoning.\"152 However, they have also stressed that the correctness of the reasons is beside the point and that committees must take care not to intrude into the Tribunal\u2019s decision-making.153\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial, para. 198, citing *Wena v. Egypt,* para. 83.\n\n*Id.,* citing *Wena v. Egypt,* para. 81.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Rejoinder, para. 400, citing *Vivendi I,* para 64.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial, para. 199-200; Respondent\u2019s Rejoinder, para. 400.\n\n(ii) No Adequate Reasons or Logical Sequence of Reasons\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n100.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, the Tribunal\u2019s factual and legal reasoning were \"overlapping,\" and do not create a *lacuna* in the Award.154 The Award\u2019s common portions as well as the separate lines of reasoning comprising the Majority are internally consistent, logical, and readily followed to their conclusion. Each of Arbitrator Park and Stern\u2019s reasoning does not exhibit any gap as they clearly identified and spelled out the factual and legal premises with a logical progression from the relevant factual findings, to the applicable law, to the conclusion that follows from the application of the law to the facts. Thus, the Respondent concludes that \"each line of reasoning is internally coherent and can be followed with relative ease.\"155\n\nRespondent\u2019s Rejoinder, para. 405.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial, para. 214, citing Judge Sinuna Opinion, para. 96.\n\n101.\n\nWhile the reasoning of the Award as a whole must be adequate, the fact that concurring arbitrators may take their own internally consistent and well-reasoned paths to the majority outcome must be taken into account.156 Articles 48(4) and 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention must be reconciled to balance the need for reasoned and intelligible award, on the one hand, with the ability of tribunal members, even those joining the majority, to freely express their separate views, on the other hand.157 It is irrelevant that the reasoning of Arbitrator Park and Arbitrator Stern diverged between point A and the common ending. What matters is that the path to the common result, viewed independently, established a logical sequence of reasoning that can be followed by an informed reader.158\n\nTranscript, Day 1, 216:13-18.\n\n*Id.,* at 215-216.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial, para. 217.\n\n(iii) Contradictory and Incoherent Reasoning\n--------------------------------------------\n\n102.\n\nThe Respondent states that *ad hoc* committees have taken \"a careful approach\" that is \"mindful of the dynamics of collegiate decision-making\" when confronted with alleged inconsistencies in a tribunal\u2019s reasoning.159 Committees should therefore endeavor to construe an award in a way that results in consistency.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Rejoinder, para. 402, citing Second Judge Simma Opinion, para. 18.\n\n103.\n\nHowever, even considering \"contradictory reasoning,\" the Applicant\u2019s argument must fail because Article 48(4) expressly permits separate opinions, whether those opinions take the form of dissents or concurring opinions.160 Since the very purpose of a separate opinion is to set forth views that differ in some respect from the principal opinion of the tribunal, they are by nature \"contradictory.\"161 Differing views of concurring arbitrators can therefore not create *lacunae* in an award. If this were annullable, it could call into question the legitimacy of many other awards.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial, para. 205.\n\n*Id.,* at para. 206.\n\n104.\n\nInstead, the reasons given in separate lines of reasoning must be evaluated independently, meaning that the award only fails to state reasons if a reader cannot trace the logic of how each arbitrator reached the majority conclusion within the individual line of reasoning. Contradictory reasons can be problematic only if they arise within the same line of reasoning.162 Because both lines of reasoning of the Majority lead to precisely the same ultimate conclusion, \"they are complimentary, rather than contradictory, reasons.\"163\n\nTranscript, Day 1, 216:5-9.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Rejoinder, para. 407.\n\n**V. ANALYSIS**\n---------------\n\n**1. The Interplay between Articles 48(1) and 48(3) of the ICSID Convention and Arbitration Rule 47(1)(i)**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n105.\n\nA considerable part of the Parties\u2019 arguments gravitate around the interpretation of, and correlation between, Article 48(1) and 48(3) of the ICSID Convention and Arbitration Rule 47(1)(i). Before analyzing each of the grounds for annulment invoked by the Applicant, the *ad hoc* Committee considers it useful to first clarify the meaning of, and relationship between, these legal texts.\n\n(i) The applicable texts\n------------------------\n\n106.\n\nArticle 48 of the ICSID Convention reads:\n\n\"(1) The Tribunal shall *decide questions* by a majority of the votes of all its members.\n\n(2) The award of the Tribunal shall be in writing and shall be signed by the members of the Tribunal who voted for it.\n\n(3) The award shall *deal with every question* submitted to the Tribunal, and shall state the reasons upon which it is based.\n\n(4) Any member of the Tribunal may attach his individual opinion to the award, whether he dissents from the majority or not, or a statement of his dissent.\n\n(5) The Centre shall not publish the award without the consent of the parties.\" [emphasis added]\n\n107.\n\nFor purposes of the present analysis, only paragraphs (1) and (3) of Article 48 are relevant.\n\n108.\n\nIn this respect, the *ad hoc* Committee observes that paragraph (1) uses, in the English text, the unqualified term \"questions\", whereas paragraph (3) uses the expression \"every question\". In the Committee\u2019s view, the choice of words in the Convention could not have been accidental. Indeed, the difference in meaning between the two expressions becomes clearer once one reads the equally authoritative French and the Spanish versions of the ICSID Convention.\n\n109.\n\nThe French version of Article 48 of the ICSID Convention reads:\n\n\"(1) Le Tribunal *statue* sur *toute question* \u00e0 la majorit\u00e9 des voix de tous ses membres.\n\n(2) La sentence est rendue par \u00e9crit; elle est sign\u00e9e par les membres du Tribunal qui se sont prononc\u00e9s en sa faveur.\n\n(3) La sentence doit *r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 tous les chefs de conclusions* soumises au Tribunal et doit \u00eatre motiv\u00e9e.\n\n(4) Tout membre du Tribunal peut faire joindre \u00e0 la sentence soit son opinion particuli\u00e8re - qu\u2019il partage ou non l\u2019opinion de la majorit\u00e9 - soit la mention de son dissentiment.\n\n(5) Le Centre ne publie aucune sentence sans le consentement des parties.\" [emphasis added]\n\n110.\n\nThe Spanish version of Article 48 reads:\n\n\"(1) El Tribunal *decidir\u00e1 todas las cuestiones* por mayor\u00eda de votos de todos sus miembros.\n\n(2) El laudo deber\u00e1 dictarse por escrito y llevar\u00e1 la firma de los miembros del Tribunal que hayan votado en su favor.\n\n(3) El laudo contendr\u00e1 *declaraci\u00f3n* sobre *todas las pretensiones* sometidas por las partes al Tribunal y ser\u00e1 motivado.\n\n(4) Los \u00e1rbitros podr\u00e1n formular un voto particular, est\u00e9n o no de acuerdo con la mayor\u00eda, o manifestar su voto contrario si disienten de ella.\n\n(5) El Centro no publicar\u00e1 el laudo sin consentimiento de las partes.\" [emphasis added]\n\n111.\n\nThe Committee notes that the French version of Article 48(1) refers to \"questions\" by using the expression \"toute question\", whereas the Spanish text uses \"todas las cuestiones\". However, the French and Spanish texts employ different terms to refer to \"every question\" in Article 48(3): the French text refers to \"tous les chefs de conclusions\", whereas the Spanish text refers to \"todas las pretensiones\". Both the French and the Spanish versions of Article 48(3) refer therefore not to questions in general, but to the parties\u2019 heads of claim (the English language equivalent of \"chefs de conclusions\" and \"todas las pretensiones\").\n\n112.\n\nParagraphs (1) and (3) of Article 48 have been implemented in two different sections of the Arbitration Rules.\n\n113.\n\nArticle 48(1) of the Convention has been implemented in Arbitration Rule 16, under the heading \"Decisions of the Tribunal\". The English version of the text reads:\n\n\"(1) Decisions of the Tribunal shall be taken by a majority of the votes of all its members. Abstention shall count as a negative vote.\"\n\n114.\n\nArticle 48(3) of the Convention has been implemented in Arbitration Rule 47, under the heading \"The Award\". The text reads:\n\n\"(1) The award shall be in writing and shall contain:\n\n[...]\n\n(i) the decision of the Tribunal on *every question* submitted to it, together with the reasons upon which the decision is based;\" [emphasis added]\n\n115.\n\nThe French version of Rule 47 reads:\n\n\"(1) La sentence est rendue par \u00e9crit et contient :\n\n[...]\n\n(i) La d\u00e9cision du Tribunal sur *toute question* qui lui a \u00e9t\u00e9 soumise, ainsi que les motifs sur lesquels la d\u00e9cision est fond\u00e9e...\" [emphasis added]\n\n116.\n\nThe Spanish version of Rule 47 reads:\n\n\"(1) El laudo ser\u00e1 escrito y contendr\u00e1:\n\n[...]\n\n(i) La decisi\u00f3n del Tribunal sobre *cuada cuesti\u00f3n* que le haya sido sometida, junto con las razones en que funda su decisi\u00f3n;...\" [emphasis added].\n\n(ii) The relationship between the texts\n---------------------------------------\n\n117.\n\nAs a preliminary matter, the Committee again notes that its interpretative process will be guided by the provisions of the VCLT, in particular Articles 31 and 33. Therefore, the terms of the ICSID Convention shall be read in good faith and will be given their ordinary meaning, taking into account their context, and in light of the object and purpose of the Convention as a whole. Moreover, the terms of the ICSID Convention shall be presumed to have an identical meaning in all three language versions of the treaty: English, French and Spanish.\n\n118.\n\nThe Committee first observes that, in spite of similarities, there is a significant difference between the terms employed in Article 48(1) and Article 48(3) of the ICSID Convention. In light of this difference, the *ad hoc* Committee considers that paragraphs (1) and (3) of Article 48 refer to two distinct issues.\n\n119.\n\nArticle 48(1) is the more general of the two and provides that, whenever the tribunal \"decides\" \"questions\", this decision needs to be supported by the vote of a majority of the panel\u2019s members. Article 48(1) was implemented in Arbitration Rule 16, which is not contained in the Chapter on \"The Award\" (where Article 48(3) is implemented), but in the Chapter on the \"Working of the Tribunal\". Thus, Article 48(1) is applicable not only when the tribunal renders an award, but whenever the tribunal needs to issue a decision, whether it is procedural or substantive. Significantly, the ICSID Convention does not define the term \"questions\" used in Article 48(1). The French and Spanish versions of this text provide no further assistance in discerning the meaning of the term. Indeed, the French version of Article 48(1) refers to \"questions\" by using the expression \"toute question\", whereas the Spanish text uses \"todas las cuestiones\".164\n\nThe Committee is of the view that the use of the word \"toute [question]\" in the French version of Article 48(1) and \"todas las [cuestiones]\" in the Spanish version are the equivalent of the English plural \"questions\", although the term \"all\" is omitted in the English version.\n\n120.\n\nArticle 48(3), on the other hand, refers to the tribunal\u2019s obligation to *\"deal with\" \"every* question\" submitted to it when rendering an \"award\". It is the *ad hoc* Committee\u2019s view that Article 48(3) of the ICSID Convention refers to the tribunal\u2019s obligation to deal with, either directly or indirectly, the parties\u2019 *heads of claim* within its award.\n\n121.\n\nIn this respect, the Committee also notes that the ICSID Convention does not define the term \"every question\" used in Article 48(3). However, the meaning of this term can be discerned if one compares the English version of the Convention with the French and Spanish versions. According to Article 33(4) of the VCLT, when there are multiple, equally authentic versions of a treaty, they are all presumed to have the same meaning.\n\n122.\n\nIn the case of the ICSID Convention, Article 48(3) of the English version refers to \"every question submitted to the Tribunal\". Article 48(3) of the French version refers to \"tous les chefs de conclusions\", while the Spanish version to \"todas las pretensiones sometidas por las partes al Tribunal\". Considering that all three versions of the text must have an identical meaning, the *ad hoc* Committee considers that the term \"questions\" in the English version of Article 48(3) must also refer to the parties\u2019 heads of claim (the English-language equivalent of the parties\u2019 \"chefs de conclusions\" or \"las pretensiones sometidas... al Tribunal\").\n\n123.\n\nWhat is more, the Committee notes that, in stipulating the tribunal\u2019s obligation with regard to the parties\u2019 heads of claim, Article 48(3) uses the term \"to deal\" in the English version, \"r\u00e9pondre\" in the French version, and \"declaraci\u00f3n sobre\" in the Spanish version. These terms are different to the ones employed in Article 48(1), which uses the term \"to decide\" in the English version, \"statuer\" in the French version and \"decidir\" in the Spanish version. The *ad hoc* Committee considers that the different wording chosen by the drafters of the ICSID Convention could not have been accidental and must reflect a difference in meaning between the two texts. The Committee will therefore give these terms their ordinary meaning, in light of their context and the object and purpose of the treaty.\n\n124.\n\nConsequently, pursuant to Article 48(3) of the ICSID Convention, a tribunal must \"deal with\", i.e., address each head of claim, answering them directly or indirectly. A tribunal is not obliged to \"decide\", i.e., vote, on each head of claim. A tribunal is also not obliged to address each argument or sub-issue raised by the parties as long as it deals with each one of the parties\u2019 heads of claim.\n\n125.\n\nOn the other hand, pursuant to Article 48(1) of the ICSID Convention, a tribunal renders decisions on \"questions\" by a majority of votes. Considering the Convention\u2019s silence as to the meaning of the term \"questions\" in this context, it will be for the tribunal to determine in each case which specific \"questions\" need to be put to a vote in order to deal with the parties\u2019 heads of claim. In its determination, the tribunal will be guided not only by the parties\u2019 heads of claim, but also by their pleadings and arguments, and the facts of the case. A tribunal is not in duty bound to decide each and every question raised by the parties but only such questions as it considers are determinative to resolve the dispute between the parties.\n\n126.\n\nThis conclusion is not in any way affected by the language used in Arbitration Rule 47(1)(i). Indeed, the Applicant argued during the hearing that Arbitration Rule 47(1)(i) in all three language versions mandates that the tribunal render a decision on every question submitted to it, together with the reasons on which said decision is based.165\n\nTranscript, Day 2, 28:10-25 and 29: 30.\n\n127.\n\nThe Committee observes that indeed all three language versions of Arbitration Rule 47(1)(i) refer to \"questions\" (\"every question\", \"toute question\", \"cuada cuesti\u00f3n\"), as the term is used in Article 48(1). However, the Arbitration Rules were and are adopted by the Centre\u2019s Administrative Council on the basis of the ICSID Convention. As a result, while the Arbitration Rules may help in elucidating the meaning and rationale of one or more provisions of the ICSID Convention, they cannot be employed to contravene or enlarge any of its provisions and must be consistent with it. Should the Arbitration Rules differ from or conflict with the ICSID Convention, the latter would prevail. According to Prof. Schreuer:\n\n\"The Arbitration Rules are subject to the Convention. In the unlikely case of conflict, the latter prevails. The Convention\u2019s provisions are mandatory unless otherwise stated. The Arbitration Rules are generally subject to modification by the parties.\"166\n\nSchreuer, ICSID Convention, p. 683.\n\n128.\n\nTherefore, the *ad hoc* Committee considers that Arbitration Rule 47(1)(i) has an identical meaning to that of Article 48(3) of the ICSID Convention: when rendering an award, an arbitral tribunal has the obligation to \"deal with\" all the heads of claims submitted by the parties. From this perspective, the Tribunal is not obliged to put to vote every question or sub-question raised by a party. It is for the Tribunal to determine which questions are material and must, therefore, be put to a vote in order to resolve the dispute between the parties.\n\n129.\n\nTo conclude, the *ad hoc* Committee finds that Article 48 paragraphs (1) and (3) of the ICSID Convention refer to two different obligations of the tribunal. On the one hand, Article 48(1) provides that any and every question that is decided by a tribunal must be approved by a majority of its members. On the other hand, Article 48(3) stipulates that, in its award, a tribunal needs to deal with, either directly or indirectly, all the parties\u2019 heads of claim (\"questions\", \"chefs de conclusions\" or \"las pretensiones sometidas... al Tribunal\"). To meet this obligation it is for the Tribunal to determine the questions which are material to resolve the dispute between the parties and put these to a vote.\n\n130.\n\nThe Committee will now tum to the analysis of the grounds for annulment invoked by the Applicant.\n\n**2. The Grounds for Annulment**\n--------------------------------\n\n*A.*  *Article 52(1)(d): Serious Departure From a Fundamental Rule of Procedure*\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n(i) Applicable standard\n-----------------------\n\n131.\n\nThe *ad hoc* Committee considers that a departure from a procedural rule justifies the drastic measure of annulment under Article 52(1)(d) of the ICSID Convention only if: (i) the departure is serious, i.e., if it deprives a party of the protection afforded by the said rule; and (ii) if the rule in question is fundamental, i.e., if it concerns a rule of natural justice. In this respect, the Committee shares the view of *MINE v. Guinea* annulment committee:\n\n\"5.05 A first comment on this provision concerns the term \u2018serious\u2019. In order to constitute a ground for annulment the departure from a \u2018fundamental rule of procedure\u2019 must be serious. The Committee considers that this establishes both quantitative and qualitative criteria: the departure must be substantial and be such as to deprive a party of the benefit or protection which the rule was intended to provide.\n\n5.06 A second comment concerns the term \u2018fundamental\u2019; even a serious departure from a rule of procedure will not give rise to annulment, unless that rule is \u2018fundamental\u2019. The Committee considers that a clear example of such a fundamental rule is to be found in Article 18 of the UNCITRAL Model Law on International Commercial Arbitration which provides:\n\nThe parties shall be treated with equality and each party shall be given full opportunity of presenting his case.\n\nThe term \u2018fundamental rule of procedure\u2019 is not to be understood as necessarily including all of the Arbitration Rules adopted by the Centre.\"167\n\n*MINE v. Guinea,* paras. 5.05-5.06.\n\n132.\n\nMoreover, the *CDC v. Seychelles* committee rightly pointed out that only rules of natural justice, which concern the essential fairness of the proceeding, could be considered fundamental:\n\n\"A departure is serious where it is \u2018substantial and [is] such as to deprive the party of the benefit or protection which the rule was intended to provide.\u2019 In other words, \u2018the violation of such a rule must have caused the Tribunal to reach a result substantially different from what it would have awarded had the rule been observed.\u2019 As for what rules of procedure are fundamental, the drafters of the Convention refrained from attempting to enumerate them, but the consensus seems to be that only rules of natural justice - rules concerned with the essential fairness of the proceeding - are fundamental. Not all ICSID Arbitration Rules are fundamental in this sense.\"168\n\n*CDC v. Seychelles,* para. 49.\n\n133.\n\nTherefore, the threshold for finding that a rule of procedure is fundamental is very high.\n\n134.\n\nThe Applicant bears the burden of proving both that (i) the Tribunal committed a serious departure from a procedural rule; and (ii) that the said rule was fundamental.\n\n(ii) Brief summary of the Parties\u2019 positions\n--------------------------------------------\n\n135.\n\nThe Applicant\u2019s position is essentially that the Tribunal disregarded the majority rule when it decided that it did not have jurisdiction to decide the case.\n\n136.\n\nIn the Applicant\u2019s view, Article 48 paragraphs (1) and (3) of the ICSID Convention mandate that a tribunal decide by a majority vote all the questions submitted by the parties and provide reasons for each such decision. The Applicant submits that the Parties had put before the Tribunal three questions:\n\n(i) whether the Tribunal had jurisdiction *ratione personae',*\n\n(ii) whether the Tribunal had jurisdiction *ratione materiae',* and\n\n(iii) whether the Tribunal had jurisdiction *ratione temporis.*\n\n137.\n\nThe Applicant contends that the Tribunal failed to gamer a real majority in favor of the Award and to decide by a majority vote each jurisdictional question presented by the Parties. In the Applicant\u2019s view, the real majority evidenced by the Award was in favor of upholding jurisdiction. However, by failing to abide by Article 48 paragraphs (1) and (3) of the ICSID Convention, the Tribunal seriously departed from a fundamental rule of procedure.\n\n138.\n\nThe Respondent\u2019s position is that the Award fully complies with the requirements of Articles 48 and 52(1)(d) of the ICSID Convention. In its view, paragraphs (1) and (3) of the ICSID Convention refer to two distinct categories of questions, with paragraph (1) relating to more general and overarching issues. Respondent also argues that, in the absence of an agreed list of questions submitted by the Parties, the Tribunal had discretion to determine which questions were to be put to a vote. Moreover, the Parties themselves had only asked the Tribunal to decide whether it had jurisdiction, and not whether there was jurisdiction *ratione personae, ratione materiae* and *ratione temporis.*\n\n139.\n\nRespondent adds that, even if the Tribunal had to rule on the objections separately, it was still under the obligation to decide whether or not it had jurisdiction.\n\n140.\n\nThe Respondent disagrees with the Applicant, and submits that the Award was carried by a real majority, with Arbitrators Park and Stern agreeing on the lack of jurisdiction and not voting against each other\u2019s position. In the Respondent\u2019s view, a majority\u2019s conclusion cannot be invalidated because of alleged contradictions between the opinions of the majority\u2019s members.\n\n(iii) The *ad hoc* Committee\u2019s decision\n---------------------------------------\n\n141.\n\nAfter having carefully studied the Parties\u2019 arguments in this respect, as well as the record in this case, the *ad hoc* Committee has concluded that the challenged Award evinces no serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure.\n\n142.\n\nIn the following paragraphs, the Committee will substantiate its conclusion by first verifying whether the Tribunal dealt with all the heads of claim the Parties had submitted to it (a.) The Committee will then ascertain whether the majority decision which is reflected in the Award is real (b.), and whether the Award in fact reflects a different, \"hidden\" majority, in favor of upholding jurisdiction *(c.)*\n\na. Whether the Tribunal dealt with all the heads of claim the Parties had submitted to it\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n143.\n\nThe Applicant contends that paragraphs (1) and (3) of the ICSID Convention\u2019s Article 48 reflect a fundamental rule of procedure, namely that a tribunal has the obligation to positively decide all the questions submitted by the parties by a majority vote, and to provide reasons in this respect. The Respondent, on the other hand, considers that the two paragraphs of Article 48 refer to two different issues, and that a tribunal has discretion to determine the questions that need to be put to a vote.\n\n144.\n\nAs discussed above at paragraphs 117-129, the *ad hoc* Committee agrees with the Respondent that Article 48 paragraphs (1) and (3) of the ICSID Convention stipulate two different obligations of an arbitral tribunal. Indeed, the Committee has found that Article 48(1) provides that any question that is decided by the tribunal needs to be approved by the vote of a majority of its members. Article 48(3) stipulates that the tribunal needs to deal, in its award, either directly or indirectly, with all the parties\u2019 heads of claim. Reading these two sub-articles together, the Tribunal is of the view that when dealing with the heads of claims of the parties, it is for the Tribunal to determine which questions are material and then put these to vote in order to dispose of the issue(s) before it. It is under no obligation to decide each and every question or sub-question raised by a party irrespective of its view whether it is material or immaterial to deal with the heads of claims raised by the parties.\n\n145.\n\nThe Committee therefore does not share the Applicant\u2019s interpretation of Article 48 paragraphs (1) and (3) of the ICSID Convention. However, because the Applicant contends that the Tribunal seriously departed from the prescriptions of Article 48, the Committee will verify whether indeed there was such a departure. Only if such a departure is found, will an analysis of whether Article 48 of the ICSID Convention is a fundamental rule of procedure become necessary.\n\n146.\n\nAs explained in more detail below, the Committee finds that there was no departure from the prescriptions of Article 48.\n\n147.\n\nIndeed, the *ad hoc* Committee will determine what were the heads of claim that the Parties had put before the Tribunal and how the Tribunal went about to decide them. The identification of these heads of claim can be achieved by verifying the Parties\u2019 requests for relief in the underlying arbitration.\n\n148.\n\nIn its Memorial on Jurisdiction and Counter-Memorial on the Merits169, the Respondent formulated the following request for relief\n\n\"650. For all the foregoing reasons, Respondent respectfully requests:\n\n(a) that the Tribunal proceed to resolve Respondent\u2019s objections to jurisdiction as a preliminary matter, and dismiss Claimant\u2019s claims for lack of jurisdiction;\n\nor, in the event the Tribunal finds jurisdiction,\n\n(b) that the tribunal dismiss Claimant\u2019s claims for lack of merit.\n\n651. Respondent also respectfully requests an award of its costs, including counsel fees, that have been incurred in these proceedings.\"\n\nExhibit C-299.\n\n149.\n\nIn the Reply on the Merits and Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction170, the Applicant/Claimant worded its request for relief in the following manner:\n\n\"747. For the reasons set out in the Memorial and this Reply on the Merits and Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, the Claimant requests that the Tribunal render an award:\n\n(i) dismissing the Respondent\u2019s objections to jurisdiction in their entirety;\n\n(ii) declaring that the Respondent has violated Articles 10 and 13 of the ECT and Articles 3 and 5 of the BIT in respect of the Claimant\u2019s investment;\n\n(iii) ordering that the Respondent pay damages to the Claimant in the amount of US$ 104.12 million;\n\n(iv) ordering that the Respondent pay the costs of the arbitration, including all fees and expenses of the Tribunal and of ICSID, along with all legal costs and expenses incurred by the Claimant in this arbitration;\n\n(v) ordering that the Respondent pay interest on such amount that the Tribunal awards to the Claimant (including costs and interest) at the LIBOR three-month US Dollar rate plus 2 per cent (or such other rate as the Tribunal deems to be appropriate), compounded on a quarterly basis, from the date of the award until full payment of the amount of the award by the Respondent; and\n\n(vi) ordering such other and further relief as the Tribunal deems appropriate.\"\n\nExhibit C-277.\n\n150.\n\nIn the Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction and Rejoinder on the Merits,171 the Respondent requested:\n\n\"510. For all of the foregoing reasons, Respondent respectfully requests:\n\n(a) that the Tribunal dismiss Claimant\u2019s claims for lack of jurisdiction;\n\nor, in the event the Tribunal finds jurisdiction,\n\n(b) that the Tribunal dismiss Claimant\u2019s claims for lack of merit.\n\n511. Respondent also respectfully requests and award of its costs, including counsel fees, that have been incurred in this proceeding.\"\n\nExhibit C-279.\n\n151.\n\nIn the Rejoinder on Jurisdiction,172 the Applicant/Claimant requested:\n\n\"234. For the reasons set out in the Memorial, the Reply on the Merits and Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction and this Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, the Claimant requests that the Tribunal render an award:\n\n(i) dismissing the Respondent\u2019s objections to jurisdiction in their entirety;\n\n(ii) declaring that the Respondent has violated Articles 10 and 13 of the ECT and Article 3 and 5 of the BIT in respect of the Claimant\u2019s investment;\n\n(iii) ordering that the Respondent pay damages to the Claimant in the amount of US$ 104.12 million;\n\n(iv) ordering that the Respondent pay the costs of the arbitration, including all the fees and expenses of the Tribunal and of ICSID, along with all legal costs and expenses incurred by the Claimant in this arbitration;\n\n(v) ordering that the Respondent pay interest on such amount that the Tribunal awards to the Claimant (including costs and interest) at the LIBOR three-month US Dollar rate plus 2 per cent (or such other rate as the Tribunal deems to be appropriate), compounded on a quarterly basis, from the date of the award until the full payment of the amount of the award by the Respondent;\n\nand\n\n(vi) ordering such other and further relief as the Tribunal deems appropriate.\"\n\nExhibit C-278.\n\n152.\n\nThe *ad hoc* Committee is of the opinion that on an examination of the pleadings of the Parties and their respective heads of claims, the Tribunal could rightly conclude that the only material question on jurisdiction for a resolution of the dispute between the parties that it had to decide was whether or not it had jurisdiction. The decision of this question was dispositive of the issue in this regard before the Tribunal. The Tribunal did not have to decide, i.e., vote on, whether it had jurisdiction *ratione personae, ratione materiae* and *ratione temporis.*\n\n153.\n\nThe Committee considers that the Tribunal accomplished the task of determining whether or not it had jurisdiction in compliance with the ICSID Convention. Indeed, the Award was rendered by a Majority made up of Arbitrators Park and Stern, who agreed that the Tribunal lacked jurisdiction to hear the case. The Hon. Marc Lalonde dissented, having reached the conclusion that the Tribunal had jurisdiction.\n\n154.\n\nTherefore, the decision that the Tribunal lacked jurisdiction to hear the case was lawfully taken by a majority of two out of three arbitrators, in strict compliance with Article 48 (1) of the ICSID Convention.\n\n155.\n\nIn the following paragraphs, the Committee will analyze whether this majority was, as the Applicant claims, not real.\n\nb. Whether there was a real majority in favor of the Award\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n156.\n\nThe Applicant contends that the majority in favor of the Award was not \"real\" because of the purported contradictions in reasoning between the arbitrators making up the Majority. The Respondent, on the other hand, argues that the only requirement set by the ICSID Convention is that the majority\u2019s vote be consistent, as opposed to the reasoning leading up to that vote.\n\n157.\n\nThe Committee agrees with the Respondent. The only requirement of the ICSID Convention\u2019s Article 48 is that the votes of the tribunal members making up the majority, and not the reasoning which they embrace, be identical.\n\n158.\n\nHowever, as a preliminary remark, the Committee observes that both Arbitrators making up the Majority *agreed* that there was no jurisdiction to hear the case. Indeed, paragraphs 312-313 of the Award are very clear in this respect:\n\n\"312. After careful consideration of all arguments and evidence, Arbitrators Stern and Park (the \u2018Majority\u2019) conclude that this Tribunal lacks jurisdiction to hear the dispute pursuant to the ECT and the Netherlands-Turkey BIT.\n\n313. The Majority has considered the two lines of reasoning set forth below. Although Arbitrator Stern and Arbitrator Park do not necessarily assign the same weight to the various components in these overlapping lines of reasoning, both members conclude that jurisdiction is clearly absent.\"173\n\nAward, paras. 312-313.\n\n159.\n\nAs stated in the Award, Arbitrator Park reasoned that the Tribunal lacked jurisdiction because the Claimant was not an investor, having failed to make any personal contribution to the Alapli Project. Arbitrator Stern considered that the Tribunal lacked jurisdiction because the timing of the investment reflected the lack of good faith of the Claimant. They consequently agreed that jurisdiction was lacking:\n\n\"The Majority has found Claimant not entitled to protection under either the Energy Charter Treaty or the Netherlands-Turkey BIT. For Arbitrator Stern this conclusion derives from notions of timing and *bona fides,* considering that Claimant did not make an investment until after the root of the controversy was evident and the dispute itself had become a high probability. For Arbitrator Park, the Claimant simply lacks the status of an investor, for want of any contribution to the Alapli Project.\"174\n\n*Id.,* at para. 315\n\n160.\n\nContrary to the Applicant\u2019s allegations, these lines of reasoning were not contradictory, but complementary.\n\n161.\n\nIndeed, as the Award itself clearly states, the arbitrators making up the Majority did not disagree as to the reasoning, but merely did not \"assign the same weight to the various components in these overlapping lines of reasoning\".175\n\n*Id.,* at para. 313.\n\n162.\n\nMoreover, the Award is based on a common understanding of the factual record of the case by the two arbitrators making up the Majority:\n\n\"A Turkish national, backed by an American multinational, seeing a dispute looming with his own government, established a Dutch entity which is claiming treaty protection for a proposed combined cycle power plant. The entirety of the financial contribution and technological know-how came from American backers, the GE Group, which advanced monies to realize an opportunity to provide equipment and services, taking all risk of loss if the Project never came to fruition. The Concession Contract, by which the host country agreed in principle to the Project\u2019s terms, was awarded to a Turkish company, Atam Elektrik.\"176\n\n*Id.,* at para. 311.\n\n163.\n\nThe Committee observes that paragraph 311 is part of the reasoning of the Award that is common to both Arbitrator Park and Arbitrator Stern. Therefore, it is not only Arbitrator Park who found \"[t]he entirety of the financial contribution and technological know-how came from American backers\", but also Arbitrator Stern. Equally, it is not only Arbitrator Stern who considered that \"[a] Turkish national, backed by an American multinational, seeing a dispute looming with his own government, established a Dutch entity\", it was also Arbitrator Park. That is the reason why the Award states at 313 that \"[t]he Majority has considered the two lines of reasoning set forth below\". However, the two arbitrators making up the Majority chose to assign different weight to the two lines of reasoning, each preferring to emphasize a different aspect of the case.\n\n164.\n\nThe Committee therefore finds that, contrary to the Applicant\u2019s contention, there were no contradictions within the Award.\n\n165.\n\nHowever, even assuming for purposes of the present analysis that the lines of reasoning employed by Arbitrators Park and Stern were contradictory, this would not affect the validity of the Award in any way. In the *ad hoc* Committee\u2019s view, what matters for the validity of the Award is how the Majority *voted.* The fact that the members of the Majority may not have agreed on the reasoning leading up to the identical vote is irrelevant.\n\n166.\n\nIndeed, the ICSID Convention envisages that arbitrators may disagree as to the reasoning underlying their award and allows them to formulate a separate/dissenting opinion. Article 48(4) is very clear in this respect and also allows arbitrators making up the majority to formulate an individual opinion:\n\n*\"Any member* of the Tribunal may attach his individual opinion to the award, *whether he dissents from the majority or not,* or a statement of his dissent.\"\n\n167.\n\nBy its very nature, an individual opinion is an opinion that is different in reasoning from the award itself. However, as Article 48(4) makes clear, it does not affect the validity of the award to which it is appended.\n\n168.\n\nIn this respect, in his treatise on the ICSID Convention, Prof. Schreuer states the following:\n\n\"A majority vote is not affected by an apparent contradiction contained in a declaration or individual opinion [...] made by a member who has voted in favour of the decision. A member of a tribunal may vote for an award not because he or she wholly agrees with it but because he or she feels that it is necessary to provide a majority.\"177\n\n\"A concurring opinion that differs from the majority opinion on certain points of the reasons does not affect the majority necessary for reaching a decision [...]. What matters for the validity of the award in accordance with Art. 48(1) is that the result has attracted the votes of a majority of the tribunal and not that the members who voted for the award agreed on all points of the reasoning accompanying it.\"178\n\nSchreuer, ICSID Convention, p. 810.\n\n*Id.,* atp. 832.\n\n169.\n\nMoreover, the ICSID Convention does not set forth any formal requirements for individual opinions. Therefore, arbitrators are free to choose how to structure and present their separate opinions. There is no specific requirement, much less a fundamental procedural rule as the Applicant alleges, that an arbitrator append his/her individual opinion after the signature page of an award. Therefore, if the majority agrees, the individual opinions of each arbitrator may be included in the text of the award.\n\n170.\n\nIn other words, what matters for purposes of making up a majority is not the reasoning of that majority\u2019s members, but their votes. This view has been consistently embraced by numerous international tribunals, within or outside the ICSID system, underscoring the conclusion that the relevant procedural requirement is the identity of votes within a majority, and not an identity in reasoning.\n\n171.\n\nIn the ICSID Convention system, the award in the *AMT v. Zaire* case is particularly on point. In that case, all three arbitrators disagreed with each other on one important issue: damages. One of the arbitrators (Mr. Heribert Golsong) issued an individual opinion with respect to the basis for awarding damages and the amount, while a co-arbitrator (Mr. K\u00e9ba Mbaye) concurred in the award\u2019s reasoning, but dissented with respect to the amount of damages. All three arbitrators voted for the award. In his individual opinion, Arbitrator Golsong explicitly stated:\n\n\"1. In order to strengthen the necessary authority of the award, I have joined my colleagues in voting in favor of the operative part of the award.\n\n2. I am, however, unable to follow them on the road of legal reasoning which led my colleagues to establish the responsibility of Zaire for the losses endured by the claimant. [...]\n\n21. My colleagues have not been persuaded by my reasoning. As a consequence, they have not followed the rather stringent requirements of prompt, adequate and effectively realizable compensation as laid out by Article III, to assess the measure of compensation in the favor of the Claimant. However, it seems to me that the strict application of Article III could not have brought about an amount of compensation substantially different of the one we have agreed upon in the dispositif of the Award.\"179\n\n215,8216]\">*AMT v. Zaire,* Statement of the individual opinion of Mr. Heribert Golsong, paras. 1, 2 and 21.\n\n172.\n\nThe *AMT v. Zaire* case evidences a stronger divergence of views between the members of a tribunal than was present in the underlying award. Indeed, in the award, both arbitrators making up the Majority agreed on the result, despite preferring a different reasoning leading up to that result. In the *AMT v. Zaire* case, all three arbitrators would have preferred a (slightly) different solution on the issue of damages, with one of them also expressing a different view on the underlying reasoning. However, all three arbitrators voted in favor of the award.\n\n173.\n\nThe Committee has already found that only the breach of rules of natural justice, which ensure the fundamental fairness of the proceeding, may warrant annulment. These rules being common to most jurisdictions, the Committee considers it helpful to take into consideration the views of other international adjudicative bodies with regard to the majority rule.\n\n174.\n\nOutside of the ICSID Convention system, examples of differing views between the arbitrators making up the majority are even more numerous. This is particularly so in the case of the Iran-U.S. Claims Tribunal, where a multitude of arbitral awards involved a majority consisting of the president of the tribunal and an arbitrator who issued an individual opinion. However, in no such case was the validity of the ensuing award questioned for lack of an authentic majority.\n\n175.\n\nFor instance, in the *Starrett Housing Corp. v. The Islamic Republic of Iran* case, arbitrator Howard M. Holtzmann issued a concurring opinion, in which he stated:\n\n\"I concur with reluctance to the Interlocutory Award in this case. I do so in order to form a majority for the key finding that the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran has expropriated property of the Claimants in Iran. My concurrence is reluctant because the Interlocutory award sets the date of the taking far later than when it actually occurred. The Interlocutory Award also includes a number of errors, and contains needlessly muddled terms of reference for the accounting expert who is appointed to give an opinion concerning the value of the expropriated property.  \n In view of the many errors in the Interlocutory Award, it would be easier to dissent from it than to concur in it. The Tribunal Rules provide, however, that awards can only be made by a majority vote. Thus, in a three-member Chamber, at least two members must join or there can be no decision. My colleague, Judge Kashani, having dissented, I am faced with the choice of joining the President in the present Interlocutory Award despite its faults, or accepting the prospect of an indefinite delay in progress toward final decision of this case [...]. The Hearing in this case closed more than ten months ago; now that an Award has at least been prepared, no one would benefit from further delay.\"180\n\n*Starrett Housing Corporation, Starrett Systems, Inc., Starrett Housing International, Inc., v. The Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran, Bank Omran, Bank Mellat,* Interlocutory Award No. ITL 32-24-1, December 19, 1983, 4 Iran-US C.T.R. 122, 159 (Concurring Opinion of Howard H. Holtzmann).\n\n176.\n\nIn the *Granite State Machine Co. Inc. v. The Islamic Republic of Iran,* arbitrator Richard M. Mosk issued the following concurring opinion:\n\n\"I concurred in the award in this case so as to end protracted deliberations which must, as noted above, \u2018continue... until a majority, and probably a compromise solution, has been reached\u2019.\n\n[...]\n\nThe rate arrived at in this case may not be sufficient to compensate the Claimant fully. Nevertheless, I concurred in the majority decision of the rate specified in the award in order to form the majority for the award\".181\n\n*Granite State Mach. Co. v. The Islamic Republic of Iran,* Award No. 18-30-3, December 15, 1982, 1 Iran-US C.T.R. 442, 450.\n\n177.\n\nAlso relevant in this respect is the concurring opinion of arbitrator Howard M. Holtzmann in the Economy Forms Corporation v. Islamic Republic of Iran\u00a0case:\n\n\"Unfortunately, however, the damages awarded are only about half of what the governing law requires.  \n Why then do I concur in this inadequate Award, rather than dissenting from it? The answer is based on the realistic old saying that there are circumstances in which \u2018something is better than nothing\u2019. [... ] Thus, in a three-member Chamber a majority of two members must join, or there can be no Award. My colleague Dr. Kashani having dissented, I am faced with the choice of either joining in the present Award or accepting the prospect of an indefinite postponement of any Award in this case. [...] The deliberations in this case have continued long enough; the hearing was closed on February 15, 1983, four months ago. Neither the parties nor the Tribunal will, in my view, benefit from further delay.\"182\n\n*Economy Forms Corporation v. The Islamic Republic of Iran,* Award No. 55-165-1, June 13, 1983, 3 Iran-US C.T.R. 42, 55 (Concurring Opinion of Howard H. Holtzmann).\n\n178.\n\nIn all the cases referred to above, the concurring arbitrator made clear that the *only* reason for voting in favor of the award was to obtain the number of votes necessary to achieve a majority. Indeed, without the vote of the concurring arbitrator, no award could have been issued. There was therefore no identity of views or similarity in reasoning between the president and the concurring arbitrator; nevertheless, due to the identity of their votes, the awards were valid.\n\n179.\n\nPerhaps the most articulate expression of the principle that it is the voting that matters in collegiate adjudicative bodies comes from the International Court of Justice. In the *Guinea-Bissau* case, the ICJ rejected a challenge against an arbitral award in which the president of the tribunal, whilst signing the award, appended a declaration stating that he would have preferred a slightly different solution to the case. The International Court of Justice upheld the award and stated unanimously:\n\n\"Furthermore, even if there had been any contradiction [...] between the view expressed by President Barberis and that stated in the Award, such contradiction could not prevail over the position which President Barberis had taken when voting for the Award. In agreeing to the Award, he definitively agreed to the decisions, which it incorporated, as to the extent of the maritime areas governed by the 1960 Agreement, and as to the Tribunal not being required to answer the second question in view of its answer to the first. As the practice of international tribunals shows, it sometimes happens that a member of a tribunal votes in favour of a decision of the tribunal even though he might individually have been inclined to prefer another solution. The validity of his vote remains unaffected by the expression of any such differences in a declaration or separate opinion of the member concerned, which are therefore without consequence for the decision of the tribunal.\"183\n\n*Guinea-Bissau,* at 64-65.\n\n180.\n\nIn his separate opinion, Judge Ni further clarified the point by stating:\n\n\"[J]udges or arbitrators do not vote as a mere matter of formality. They do so in order to express their precise position. They are fully aware of the substantive implications of their vote. The vote indicates their final decision. If the Declaration, as in this case, raises an uncertainty as to whether a judge or arbitrator concurs with or dissents from a judgment or an award, it is the vote that constitutes the authentic expression of his attitude.\"184\n\n*Guinea-Bissau v. Senegal,* Separate Opinion of Judge Ni, p. 99.\n\n181.\n\nCommenting on this case in his 1996 Freshfields Lecture, Judge Stephen M. Schwebel noted the following:\n\n\"The claim of Guinea-Bissau in the end boiled down to the complaint that the tribunal had voted for what it could muster a majority for rather than for what a majority of its members thought to be right. That complaint was well-founded. But it did not follow that the resultant award was inexistent, null and void, or even voidable. On the contrary, so much of the judicial and arbitral process is characterized by judges and arbitrators voting to form a majority rather than voting to express what each of them may see as the optimum judgment. In a collective body, there is very frequently a process of accommodation of differing views, sometimes sharply differing views. The result may be the consecration of the least common denominator. That may not be a noble result, but it is a practical result. It is better than no result.\"185\n\nStephen M. Schwebel, *May the Majority Vote of an International Arbitral tribunal be Impeached?,* 13 Arbitration International 2 (1997), p. 153.\n\n182.\n\nThe *ad hoc* Committee shares Judge Schwebel\u2019s view entirely: what matters for the validity of an award is not the majority\u2019s reasoning, but the identity of the votes with respect to the outcome. In the present case, there is no doubt that the arbitrators making up that Majority voted in favor of dismissing the case for lack of jurisdiction.\n\n183.\n\nThe Committee will now verify whether the Award reflects a different, hidden majority in favor of upholding jurisdiction.\n\nc. Whether the Award reflects a different hidden, majority in favor of upholding jurisdiction\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n184.\n\nBefore turning to the analysis of the next ground for annulment invoked by the Applicant, the Committee wishes to make some observations with regard to the Applicant\u2019s allegation that an issue-based counting of the votes would have yielded a different outcome on jurisdiction. In this respect, the Applicant alleges that Arbitrator Park voted in favor of jurisdiction *ratione temporis,* while Arbitrator Stern voted in favor of jurisdiction *ratione personae* and *ratione materiae,* and this, in turn, led to a \"real\" majority upholding jurisdiction.\n\n185.\n\nThe Committee does not share the Applicant\u2019s view. Indeed, a careful analysis of the Award reveals that there was no majority of the votes in favor of upholding jurisdiction, no matter what the grounds.\n\n186.\n\nAs a preliminary observation, the Committee reiterates that the Award is based on a common understanding of the factual background of the case shared by Arbitrators Park and Stern (see above at paragraphs 158-163). Based on this common understanding, the arbitrators making up the Majority chose to assign different weight to the two complementary lines of reasoning within the Award.\n\n187.\n\nThe arbitrators making up the Majority manifestly did not vote against each other\u2019s position, but acknowledged them as possible lines of reasoning leading up to the same outcome: the absence of jurisdiction.\n\n188.\n\nMore precisely, the Committee considers that Arbitrator Park expressed no view and did not vote on the objection to jurisdiction *ratione temporis.* Indeed, Arbitrator Park\u2019s observations with regard to the Claimant\u2019s corporate restructuring were made within the context of his analysis on the Claimant\u2019s lack of a personal contribution to the Alapli project. Arbitrator Park did not express any view with respect to the legitimacy of the Claimant\u2019s corporate restructuring and manifestly did not cast a vote in this respect:\n\n\"The tribunal in *Mobil* found jurisdiction under the BIT despite the respondent\u2019s contention that the claimant was a \u2018corporation of convenience.\u2019 Moreover, the *Mobil* tribunal did not doubt the legitimacy of the Dutch company\u2019s role, noting that the claimant in that case \u2018contributed their part to [the] investments\u2019. For this reason, *Mobil* is not perfectly analogous to the present dispute. While Claimant may have been established pursuant to \u2018legitimate corporate planning\u2019, there is no indication that it contributed anything to the relevant investments. Claimant acted merely as a conduit in effecting the back-to-back payments required to incorporate Atam Alalpli.\"186\n\nAward, para. 386.\n\n189.\n\nThe words employed by Arbitrator Park (\"While Claimant *may have been established* pursuant to \u2018legitimate corporate planning\u2019\") manifestly do not express any view of his with respect to the corporate restructuring. The Committee understands from these words that Arbitrator Park in effect wishes to point out that the issue of the corporate restructuring is irrelevant to his analysis on contribution. He does not make any finding with respect to its legitimacy and does not cast any vote on the issue of jurisdiction *ratione temporis.* Indeed, the reference to jurisdiction *ratione temporis* is entirely absent from his analysis.\n\n190.\n\nUnder these circumstances, the Committee can find no support for the Applicant\u2019s view that Arbitrator Park found in favor of jurisdiction *ratione temporis.*\n\n191.\n\nThe Committee also considers that Arbitrator Stern\u2019s analysis could not be interpreted as upholding jurisdiction *ratione materiae* and *ratione personae.* The contested passage in her analysis is paragraph 390 of the Award, which reads:\n\n\"Although Arbitrator Stern shares the conclusion arrived at by Arbitrator Park, to the effect that the Tribunal has no jurisdiction, she arrives at such a conclusion through a different legal analysis. The uncontested fact that a Dutch company owns the shares of Atam Alapli seems sufficient to consider that there is indeed in this case a foreign investor which is the legal owner of an investment. However, the factual elements on which Arbitrator Park relies are a confirmation that there is no protected investment in this case, as they are the visible sign that the whole operation did not have any economic rationale, but had as its main purpose to gain access to ICSID arbitration at a time when there were already important disagreements between the Turkish company and the Turkish authorities, the precise disagreements that are at the core of the present claim of Claimant. In other words, the introduction of the Dutch company in the investment chain was, at the time it was performed, an abuse of the system of international investment protection under the ICSID/BIT/ECT mechanism.\"187\n\n*Id.,* at para. 390.\n\n192.\n\nThe Committee observes, as the Applicant has pointed out, that Arbitrator Stern found that \"[t]he uncontested fact that a Dutch company owns the shares of Atam Alapli seems sufficient to consider that there is indeed in this case a foreign investor which is the legal owner of an investment\".\n\n193.\n\nHowever, the Committee does not share the Applicant\u2019s conclusion that this sentence expresses Arbitrator Stern\u2019s view that there was jurisdiction *ratione materiae* and *ratione temporis* in this case. Indeed, Arbitrator Stern clearly does not express any clear view on the matter in the contested sentence, but uses the words \"seems sufficient\" to show that there is the *appearance* of an investment. Nevertheless, she makes it very clear in the following sentence, which the Applicant does not quote, that this is merely an appearance and there is in fact no protected investment:\n\n\"However, the factual elements on which Arbitrator Park relies are a confirmation that *there is no protected investment in this case,* as they are the visible sign that the whole operation did not have any economic rationale\".188\n\n*Id**.*\n\n194.\n\nIf anything, this sentence expresses the view that jurisdiction *ratione materiae* and *ratione personae* do not exist. However, Arbitrator Stern did not cast a vote on these two objections and chose to focus her analysis solely on the issue of the timing of the investment and jurisdiction *ratione temporis.*\n\n195.\n\nIn light of these considerations, the *ad hoc* Committee finds that Arbitrator Park did not vote on the objection to jurisdiction *ratione temporis,* and that Arbitrator Stern did not vote on the objections to jurisdiction *ratione materiae* and *ratione personae.* They chose to leave those objections unanswered in light of their finding that jurisdiction was lacking, but on different grounds. There is therefore no \"hidden majority\" within the Award in favor of upholding jurisdiction, and no contradiction between Arbitrator Park\u2019s and Arbitrator Stern\u2019s analyses.\n\n196.\n\nFor all the reasons expressed above, the *ad hoc* Committee finds that the Award evinces no serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure.\n\n*B.*  *Article 52(1)(e): Failure to State Reasons*\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n(i) Applicable standard\n-----------------------\n\n197.\n\nThe *ad hoc* Committee considers that annulment under Article 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention is warranted only when a tribunal has failed to discharge its duty to render an award that allows readers to comprehend and follow its reasoning. Article 52(1)(e) does not empower an *ad hoc* Committee to review the merits of a case. Indeed, such a review would amount to an appeal, which is an impermissible remedy pursuant to Article 53 of the ICSID Convention.\n\n198.\n\nIn this respect, the *ad hoc* Committee aligns itself with the *MINE v. Guinea* annulment committee, which stated:\n\n\"5.08 The Committee is of the opinion that the requirement that an award has to be motivated implies that it must enable the reader to follow the reasoning of the Tribunal on points of fact and law. It implies that, and only that. The adequacy of the reasoning is not an appropriate standard of review under paragraph (1)(e), because it almost inevitably draws an *ad hoc* Committee into an examination of the substance of the tribunal\u2019s decision, in disregard of the exclusion of the remedy of appeal by Article 53 of the Convention. [... ]\n\n5.09 In the Committee\u2019s view, the requirement to state reasons is satisfied as long as the award enables one to follow how the tribunal proceeded from Point A to Point B and eventually to its conclusion, even if it made an error of fact or of law. This minimum requirement is in particular not satisfied by either contradictory or frivolous reasons.\"189\n\n*MINEv. Guinea,* paras. 5.08-5.09.\n\n199.\n\nIn other words, what a committee is authorized to verify under Article 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention is whether the sequence of arguments within an award evidences a logical chain of reasoning that is apt to lead to the conclusion that was reached by the tribunal. This was also the view of the *Wena v. Egypt* annulment committee:\n\n\"79. The ground for annulment of Article 52(1)(e) does not allow any review of the challenged Award which would lead the *ad hoc* Committee to reconsider whether the reasons underlying the Tribunal\u2019s decisions were appropriate or not, convincing or not. As stated by the *ad hoc* Committee in *MINE,* this ground for annulment refers to a \u2018minimum requirement\u2019 only. This requirement is based on the Tribunal\u2019s duty to identify, and to let the parties know, the factual and legal premises leading the Tribunal to its decision. If such sequence of reasons has been given by the Tribunal, there is no room left for a request for annulment under Article 52(1)(e).190\n\n*Wena v. Egypt,* paras. 79 and 81.\n\n200.\n\nAlthough the Committee does consider that genuinely contradictory reasons cancel each other out and amount to no reasons at all, it also notes that annulment committees should not be quick to find contradiction when in fact what is evident from the award is the compromise reached in an international collegiate adjudicative body. In this respect, the *Vivendi I* annulment committee rightly observed:\n\n\"In the Committee\u2019s view, annulment under Article 52(1)(e) should only occur in a clear case. This entails two conditions: first, the failure to state reasons must leave the decision on a particular point essentially lacking in any expressed rationale; and second, that point must itself be necessary to the tribunal\u2019s decision. It is frequently said that contradictory reasons cancel each other out, and indeed, if reasons are genuinely contradictory so they might. However, tribunals must often struggle to balance conflicting considerations, and an *ad hoc* committee should be careful not to discern contradiction when what is actually expressed in a tribunal\u2019s reasons could more truly be said to be but a reflection of such conflicting considerations.\"191\n\n*Vivendi I,* para. 65.\n\n201.\n\nThe Committee is persuaded that, if possible, an interpretation which confirms an award\u2019s consistency as opposed to its alleged inner contradictions should be preferred. The *CDC v. Seychelles* annulment committee\u2019s view was similar:\n\n\"In construing awards, as in construing statutes and legal instruments generally, one necessarily should construe the language in issue, whenever possible, in a way that results in consistency[...].\"192\n\n*CDC v. Seychelles,* para. 81.\n\n202.\n\nIn light of these considerations, the *ad hoc* Committee finds that the threshold for annulment under Article 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention is very high. Indeed, the Applicant bears the burden of proving that the Tribunal\u2019s reasoning on a point which is essential to the outcome of the case was either unintelligible or contradictory or frivolous or absent.\n\n(ii) Brief summary of the Parties\u2019 positions\n--------------------------------------------\n\n203.\n\nThe Applicant first argues that the Award as a whole does not satisfy the requirements of Article 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention because the Majority denied jurisdiction over the dispute despite the fact that, when one counted the votes, the actual majority was in favor of upholding jurisdiction. In the Applicant\u2019s view, the opinions of Arbitrators Park and Stern cannot be evaluated independently in order to ascertain whether they evince a failure to state reasons, but only as parts of the Award itself.\n\n204.\n\nThe Applicant also argues that, individually, Arbitrator Park\u2019s and Arbitrator Stern\u2019s opinions failed to evidence on what extent they are based on the law and on a proper analysis of the relevant facts.\n\n205.\n\nFinally, the Applicant argues that the Award is wholly incoherent and contradictory because Arbitrator Park and Arbitrator Stern manifestly contradicted each other with respect to the objections to jurisdiction raised by the Claimant.\n\n206.\n\nThe Respondent, on the other hand, argues that the Award as a whole is logical and internally consistent, and that it can be easily followed from the beginning up to its conclusion. In its view, the lines of reasoning of Arbitrators Park and Stern were not contradictory.\n\n207.\n\nRespondent adds that, in any event, annulment committees should endeavor to read awards in ways that result in consistency, and not inconsistency. Moreover, in light of Article 48(4) of the ICSID Convention, the lines of reasoning of Arbitrators Park and Stern, even if contradictory, would not endanger the validity of the Award.\n\n208.\n\nFinally, the Respondent considers that the reasons given by Arbitrators Park and Stern must be evaluated independently to verify if they comply with the requirements of Article 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention.\n\n(iii) The *ad hoc* Committee\u2019s decision\n---------------------------------------\n\n209.\n\nIn light of the Parties\u2019 arguments and the record before it, the *ad hoc* Committee finds that there are no grounds to annul the Award on the basis of Article 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention. The Committee will present in the following paragraphs the reasons which have prompted it to reach this conclusion.\n\n210.\n\nAs a preliminary matter, the Committee wishes to again stress that its mandate is not to sit in appeal on the Tribunal\u2019s reasoning. An award is not to be annulled merely because an annulment Committee forms the view that, on the same facts and evidence, it would have reached a different conclusion. There is a difference between an absence of reasons and reasons which are genuinely contradictory or frivolous on the one hand and reasons with which a party or a committee simply disagrees on the other. The former may form the basis of an annulment but the latter cannot. This Committee is of the view that a tribunal and a committee can reasonably come to different and even opposite conclusions, when evaluating or analyzing the same set of facts and evidence without the opinion of either being regarded as being devoid of reasons. The only scrutiny that may be undertaken, by a Committee, on the basis of Article 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention is whether the Award satisfies the requirements of reasoning which enable the reader to discern what considerations prompted the Tribunal to reach its conclusions.\n\n211.\n\nAfter having carefully analyzed the Award and in light of its previous findings at Section V.2.A.iii above, the *ad hoc* Committee concludes that there is no support for the Applicant\u2019s contentions that: (i) no reasons were given why the Award denied jurisdiction when an \"actual majority\" was in favor of upholding jurisdiction; and (ii) Arbitrator Park\u2019s and Arbitrator Stern\u2019s analyses are contradictory which makes the Award itself contradictory. The considerations that have prompted the Committee to reach this conclusion are the following.\n\n212.\n\nFirst, at paragraphs 158-163 above, the *ad hoc* Committee has already found that the Majority issued the Award based on a common understanding of the factual background, and that Arbitrator Park\u2019s and Arbitrator Stern\u2019s lines of reasoning are not contradictory, but complementary. What is more, Arbitrators Park and Stern expressly *agreed* that the Tribunal lacked jurisdiction to hear the case.\n\n213.\n\nSecond, the Committee has also established that the Tribunal was under no obligation to vote separately on each objection to jurisdiction. The Tribunal was only obliged to \"deal with\" the heads of claims presented by the Parties and when doing so it was for the Tribunal to determine and put to vote such questions which, in its view, were dispositive of the issue(s) before it. The Committee has determined that the Tribunal discharged this duty in full compliance with the requirements of Article 48 of the ICSID Convention.\n\n214.\n\nThird, the Committee has stated that the ICSID Convention allows all arbitrators, even arbitrators making up a majority, to issue an individual opinion, the essence of which is a divergence of views from that taken in the award. As a result, the Convention does not regard a difference in views between arbitrators making up the majority as problematic. In this respect, the only requirement for the validity of an award is that the majority cast their votes to the same effect.\n\n215.\n\nFinally, the Committee has found that there was no \"hidden majority\" within the Award in favor of upholding jurisdiction. In fact, Arbitrator Park did not vote on the objection to jurisdiction *ratione temporis,* and Arbitrator Stern did not vote on the objections to jurisdiction *ratione materiae* and *ratione personae.* They chose to leave those objections unanswered in light of their finding that jurisdiction was lacking, but on different grounds.\n\n216.\n\nThe Committee also considers that, individually, Arbitrator Park\u2019s and Arbitrator Stern\u2019s analyses satisfy the requirements of reasoning established by Article 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention.\n\n217.\n\nArbitrator Park. Arbitrator Park found that there was no jurisdiction to decide the case because the Claimant had never made any personal contribution and had not taken any risk with respect to the Alapli Project.193\n\nAward, paras. 337, 347, 350.\n\n218.\n\nArbitrator Park substantiated this finding by referring to key pieces from the record, which, in his view, evidenced that the Claimant had served as a mere conduit through which financial contributions to Atam Alapli were funneled by the American GE Group. Indeed, Arbitrator Park found that the Claimant had had no merit in obtaining the Concession Contract and had not become a party to it, that it had not provided any technological expertise (ensured by General Electric), and that the statutory capital itself was contributed by General Electric, with the Claimant never acquiring any dominium over the funds.194\n\n*Id.,* at paras. 338-346, 362-380.\n\n219.\n\nIn his analysis, Arbitrator Park referred to the Netherlands-Turkey BIT, the ECT, the ICSID Convention and the VCLT. He referenced the Preamble and Articles 1 (a)(ii), 3(1) of the BIT; Article 1 (7)(a)(ii), Article 10(1) and Article 26(1) of the ECT; and Article 25 of the ICSID Convention. By applying the interpretative principles of the VCLT, he found the applicable law to require an \"active contribution of some sort\" on the part of the investor.195 Based on the record available before the Tribunal, Arbitrator Park again stressed that \"any significant contribution to the Project was made either by Americans, the GE Group, or by Turkish nationals (the Project Sponsors), not by the Dutch Claimant\".196\n\n*Id.,* at paras. 337, 341, 352-361.\n\n*Id*., at para. 362.\n\n220.\n\nIn support of his conclusion that the Claimant had not made any personal contribution, took no risk, and thereby lacked the status of an investor, Arbitrator Park referred to other investor-State awards. He placed particular reliance on *Salini v. Morocco* and *Toto Costruzioni v. Lebanon**.* Despite analyzing the concepts of \"investor\" and \"investment\" under Article 25 of the ICSID Convention, Arbitrator Park considered these cases to be useful in order to substantiate the definitions of the terms under the BIT and the ECT. Arbitrator Park observed that even the *Mobil v. Venezuela* case, cited by the Claimant, assumed some contribution on the part of the claimant.197\n\n*Id.,* at paras. 381-386.\n\n221.\n\nFinally, Arbitrator Park referred to the cross-examination of Mr. Morova during the evidentiary hearing as support for his conclusion that the Claimant had not made any contribution to the Alapli Project.198\n\n*Id.,* at paras. 387-388.\n\n222.\n\nHaving regard to these considerations, Arbitrator Park concluded that there was no jurisdiction over the dispute.\n\n223.\n\nThe *ad hoc* Committee considers that Arbitrator Park\u2019s analysis enables the reader to understand his reasoning, and to follow it from beginning until its conclusion. Therefore, the Committee considers that Arbitrator Park\u2019s analysis meets the level of reasoning required by Article 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention.\n\n224.\n\nArbitrator Stern. Arbitrator Stern found that the Claimant had abused the investment treaty system by restructuring its investment at a time when there were important disagreements with the Turkish authorities, the very same disagreements that were at the heart of the dispute before the Tribunal. As a result, she found that there was no jurisdiction to hear the case.\n\n225.\n\nArbitrator Stern began her analysis by referring to the seminal *Mobil v. Venezuela* and *Phoenix Action v. Czech Republic* cases, and stated that a corporate restructuring can be made either in good faith or in bad faith, depending on its timing.199 Arbitrator Stern clarified that, in order to determine whether a corporate restructuring was undertaken in bad faith, one needs to verify if, at that time, \"the relevant party can see an actual dispute or can foresee a specific future dispute as a high probability and not merely as a general future controversy\".200\n\n*Id.,* at paras. 391-392, 401-403.\n\n*Id.,* at para. 403.\n\n226.\n\nArbitrator Stern then made specific references to the record and found that there were numerous elements which justified the conclusion that the sole purpose of the corporate restructuring was to obtain access to the investment arbitration system at a time when a dispute with the Turkish government was very probable. She compared the circumstances of the case to the ones in *Phoenix Action v. Czech Republic**,* stating that in both cases the investment was manipulated to appear foreign, by carrying out the corporate restructuring inside a (corporate) family. She substantiated her conclusion by referring to the facts of the case, such as: (i) contrary to the initial agreement, the Claimant was formed 14 months after the expiry of the contractual deadline with no plausible explanation for the delay; (ii) at the time, the problems that were at the core of the arbitration had already appeared in the relationship with the Turkish authorities; (iii) the only investors involved were the two Turkish shareholders who initiated the Project and who attempted to hide this information from the Tribunal.201\n\n*Id.,* at paras. 393-399, 404-415.\n\n227.\n\nBased on these findings, Arbitrator Stern concluded that the Claimant had committed an abuse of the investment treaty system and that the Tribunal lacked jurisdiction to hear the case.\n\n228.\n\nThe Committee considers that Arbitrator Stern\u2019s analysis is fully in line with the prerequisites of Article 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention. Her reasoning is clear and can be followed without any difficulty from beginning to end.\n\n229.\n\nFor the above reasons, the *ad hoc* Committee finds that the Award does not fail to state the reasons upon which it is based and that its annulment under Article 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention is therefore not warranted.\n\n*C.*  *Article 52(1)(b): Manifest Excess of powers*\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n(i) Applicable standard\n-----------------------\n\n230.\n\nThe *ad hoc* Committee shares the view of both the Applicant202 and the Respondent203 that an excess of power must be \"manifest\", meaning plain, evident, obvious, clear, in order to warrant annulment. In this respect, the *ad hoc* Committee aligns itself with the view taken by the *Wena v. Egypt* annulment committee:\n\n\"The excess of power must be self-evident rather than the product of elaborate interpretations one way or the other. When the latter happens the excess of power is no longer manifest.\"204\n\nApplicant\u2019s Memorial, para. 86.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial, para. 219.\n\n*Wena v. Egypt,* para. 25.\n\n231.\n\nThe *CDC v. Seychelles* committee further clarified that, when more than one interpretation of a disputed issue are equally possible, there can be no room for a manifest excess of powers, and the tribunal\u2019s determination will be final:\n\n\"As interpreted by various *ad hoc* Committees, the term \u2018manifest\u2019 means clear or \u2018self-evident\u2019. Thus, even if a Tribunal exceeds its powers, the excess must be plain on its face for annulment to be an available remedy. Any excess apparent in a Tribunal\u2019s conduct, if susceptible of argument \u2018one way or the other\u2019, is not manifest. [...] If the issue is debatable or requires examination of the materials on which the tribunal\u2019s decision is based, the tribunal\u2019s determination is conclusive.\u2019\"205\n\n*CDC v. Seychelles,* para. 41.\n\n232.\n\nThe *ad hoc* Committee shares this view entirely. The annulment procedure is not a mechanism to correct alleged errors of fact or law that a tribunal may have committed, but a limited remedy meant to ensure the fundamental fairness of the arbitration proceeding.\n\n233.\n\nThe Applicant invokes two instances of a manifest excess of powers: the failure to apply the proper law and the failure to exercise existing jurisdiction. The Committee will make some brief observations with respect to both.\n\n234.\n\nWith respect to the failure to apply the applicable law, at the risk of repeating itself, the Committee wishes to stress that it is not the role of an annulment committee to verify whether the tribunal\u2019s interpretation of the law or assessment of the facts was correct. As long as the tribunal correctly identified the applicable law, and strove to apply it to the facts that it established, there is no room for annulment. Moreover, pursuant to Arbitration Rule 34(1), the tribunal is the judge of the admissibility of any evidence adduced and of its probative value. It is certainly not the role of an annulment committee to verify whether a tribunal correctly established the facts of a case. Not only is such an analysis not warranted by the language of Article 53(1) of the ICSID Convention, but also the tribunal, having first-hand knowledge of the evidence before it, is best situated to interpret it. What is more, a tribunal has considerable discretion in its evaluation of the evidence.\n\n235.\n\nThe Committee considers that any other interpretation of this ground for annulment would veer the annulment procedure dangerously towards an appeal, a remedy which the Contracting States to the ICSID Convention have expressly excluded.\n\n236.\n\nIn this respect, the Committee finds the *CDC v. Seychelles* committee\u2019s position particularly persuasive:\n\n\"Regardless of our opinion of the correctness of the Tribunal\u2019s legal analysis, however, our inquiry is limited to a determination of whether or not the Tribunal endeavored to apply English law. That it did so is made plain by its explicit statement in the Award that it did as well as by its repeated citation to relevant English authorities.\"206\n\n*Id.,* at para. 45.\n\n237.\n\nThe *MINE v. Guinea* annulment committee found, in a similar vein:\n\n\"Disregard of the applicable rules of law must be distinguished from erroneous application of those rules which, even if manifestly unwarranted, furnishes no ground for annulment.\"207\n\n*MINE v. Guinea,* para. 5.04.\n\n238.\n\nWith respect to the failure to exercise a jurisdiction which a tribunal did possess, the standards to be employed are identical. The excess of powers must be manifest, meaning evident, obvious and clear on its face. Indeed, the ICSID Convention does not draw any distinction between jurisdictional excesses and other types of excesses that a tribunal may commit.208\n\n*MTD Equity Sdn. Bhd. and MTD Chile S.A. v. Republic of Chile* (ICSID case No. ARB/01/7), Decision on Annulment, March 21, 2007, para. 54.\n\n(ii) Brief summary of the Parties\u2019 positions\n--------------------------------------------\n\n239.\n\nThe Applicant argues that the Tribunal both failed to apply the applicable law and to exercise a jurisdiction which it did have.\n\n240.\n\nWith respect to the former, the Applicant considers that it is not enough for a tribunal to identify and to endeavor to apply the proper law. A misinterpretation or misapplication of the proper law that is gross or egregious will also amount to a failure to apply the proper law. The Applicant argues that Arbitrator Park\u2019s and Arbitrator Stern\u2019s analyses were grossly mistaken, and based on erroneous factual conclusions.\n\n241.\n\nWith respect to the Tribunal\u2019s failure to exercise a jurisdiction which it did possess, the Applicant considers that it stems directly from the Majority\u2019s manifestly erroneous legal analyses and factual findings.\n\n242.\n\nThe Respondent, on the other hand, considers that an *ad hoc* committee may only verify if a tribunal endeavored to apply the proper law, and not whether a tribunal misinterpreted the law or misapplied it to the facts of the case. The Respondent contends that both Arbitrators Park and Stern referred to the correct body of law and strove to apply it to the facts of the case.\n\n243.\n\nThe Respondent adds that, in the event the Committee should find that a gross misapplication of the law is a ground for annulment, the very high threshold for finding such an error is not met in the present case.\n\n244.\n\nFinally, the Respondent considers that the Tribunal did not manifestly fail to exercise jurisdiction in this case.\n\n(iii) The *ad hoc* Committee\u2019s decision\n---------------------------------------\n\n245.\n\nAs explained in more detail at paragraphs 234-235 above, an *ad hoc* Committee is not empowered to review the Tribunal\u2019s appreciation of the law and the Tribunal\u2019s determination of the relevant facts, as the Applicant is urging it to do. What the Committee may do is to verify whether the Tribunal correctly identified the proper law and endeavored to apply it. In the present case, the Committee finds that it did.\n\n246.\n\nIndeed, the Committee notes that the Tribunal found the following legal sources to be applicable to the dispute: the ICSID Convention, the Netherlands-Turkey BIT and the ECT, as interpreted in light of the VCLT.209 The Committee also notes that the Applicant acknowledges that the Tribunal correctly identified the proper law.210 There is therefore no dispute in this respect.\n\nAward, paras. 320-336.\n\nApplicant\u2019s Reply, paras. 57-58.\n\n247.\n\nMoreover, the Tribunal not only correctly identified the proper law, but also endeavored to apply it. This is sufficient, in the Committee\u2019s view, to conclude that annulment of the Award under Article 52(1)(b) of the ICSID Convention is not warranted.\n\n248.\n\nArbitrator Park. Within his analysis, Arbitrator Park referred to the interpretative principles set out in the VCLT when he deciphered the meaning of the expression \"investment of an investor\". Based on the BIT\u2019s preamble and the ECT\u2019s Article 10(1), he found that both international treaties require an active contribution of the investor.211 By referring to the record, Arbitrator Park found that the Claimant had not made any such contribution to the Alapli Project, and had assumed no risk in this respect. Arbitrator Park carefully scrutinized the operations by which the transfer of Atam Alapli\u2019s statutory capital was effectuated and discovered that:\n\n\"378. To summarize, the sequence was as follows. First Project Company made payments to Claimant; Claimant made payments to Second Project Company; GEPSI reimbursed the capital payments to First Project Company.\n\n379. The payments were all made within a period of five months, from late-February through mid-July 2000, pursuant to a scheme best characterized as a revolving door of sorts. Back-to-back payments by GEPSI reimbursed Atam Elektrik for monies sent to Claimant as capital contribution to Atam Alapli, the Second Project Company.\"212\n\nAward, paras. 352-360.\n\n*Id.,* at paras. 378-379.\n\n249.\n\nBased on these findings, Arbitrator Park concluded that the Claimant had not acquired any dominium over the funds which transited its accounts, and that the entire financial contribution came from the General Electric Group, which also ensured the technological expertise necessary for the project.213\n\n*Id.,* at paras. 338-347, 380.\n\n250.\n\nBy applying Article 1 of the BIT and Article 1 of the ECT to the facts of the case, Arbitrator Park found that Atam Alapli was not an investment \"of\u2019 the Claimant, because there had been no underlying activity of investing on the Claimant\u2019s part.214 He then referred to other investor-State awards which had analyzed the concept of \"investment\" under Article 25 of the ICSID Convention and had reached similar conclusions215.\n\n*Id.,* at paras. 338-349, 362-380.\n\n*Id.,* at paras. 381-386.\n\n251.\n\nThe Committee therefore observes that Arbitrator Park referred to the applicable law on numerous instances and endeavored to apply its provisions to the facts of the case. Whether or not the application of the proper law to these facts was correct is not within the Committee\u2019s mandate to ascertain. There was therefore no failure on Arbitrator Park\u2019s part to apply the proper law.\n\n252.\n\nArbitrator Stern. Arbitrator Stern interpreted the notions of a protected \"investment\" and of \"investor\" under the ICSID Convention, the BIT and the ECT in light of the international law principle of good faith. By referring to previous investor-State awards that shed light on the distinction between good faith and bad faith corporate restructurings *(Phoenix Action v. Czech Republic, Mobil v. Venezuela),* she found that the applicable investment treaties could only confer legal protection upon investments that had been made in good faith.216 She stated that:\n\n\"It is indeed an abuse for an investor to manipulate the nationality of a shell subsidiary to gain jurisdiction under an international treaty at a time when the investor is aware that events have occurred that negatively affect its investment and may lead to arbitration. Before that dividing-line is reached, there will be ordinarily no abuse of process; but after that dividing-line is passed, there ordinarily will be.\"217\n\n*Id,* at paras. 390-392, 400-403.\n\n*Id,* at para. 403.\n\n253.\n\nUpon applying these findings to the facts of the case, Arbitrator Stern concluded that the corporate restructuring undertaken by the Claimant had not been made in good faith. Indeed, Arbitrator Stern found that the sole purpose of the corporate restructuring was to obtain access to the investment arbitration system at a time when a dispute with the Turkish Government was very probable. More precisely, Arbitrator Stern found that: (i) the Claimant had been formed with a significant delay than initially planned, and no acceptable explanation could be offered in this respect; (ii) at the time, the Claimant had already begun to experience the problems that were at the core of the arbitration; (iii) no foreign investor was involved in the corporate restructuring, but only the two Turkish shareholders who had initiated the project; and (iv) the Turkish investors attempted to conceal this information from the Tribunal.218\n\n*Id,* at paras. 393-399, 404-415.\n\n254.\n\nBased on her conclusion that the Claimant\u2019s corporate restructuring had been undertaken in bad faith, Arbitrator Stern concluded that there was no jurisdiction to hear the case.\n\n255.\n\nThe Committee considers that there can be no question of Arbitrator Stern failing to apply the proper law. Arbitrator Stern correctly identified the proper law and repeatedly referred to it within her analysis, when applying it to the facts of the case. Again, whether Prof. Stern\u2019s analysis is correct is not an issue that an annulment Committee may determine.\n\n256.\n\nIn light of these considerations, the Committee finds that the Applicant has failed to discharge its burden of proving that the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers by failing to apply the proper law to the facts of the case. What is more, for the same reasons, the Award evinces no manifest failure to exercise jurisdiction.\n\n257.\n\nConsequently, the *ad hoc* Committee dismisses the Applicant\u2019s contention that the Award is the result of a manifest excess of power, as per Article 52(1)(b) of the ICSID Convention.\n\n**VI. COSTS**\n-------------\n\n258.\n\nIn light of the provisions of Article 61(2) of the ICSID Convention and Arbitration Rule 47(1), corroborated with Article 52(4) of the ICSID Convention and Arbitration Rule 53, the *ad hoc* Committee has discretion with regard to the allocation of costs.\n\n259.\n\nThe Parties submitted their submissions with regard to costs on February 7, 2014.\n\n260.\n\nThe Applicant seeks to recover their legal costs and expenses incurred in connection with the annulment proceeding, totaling USD 1,878,310.31 (USD 1,518,310.31 as legal fees, and USD 360,000 as advances and lodging fee remitted by the Applicant to ICSID).\n\n261.\n\nThe Respondent seeks to recover USD 1,075,156.93 (USD 942,282.81 attorneys\u2019 fees, USD 117,000 expert fees, USD 8,034.92 travel expenses and USD 7,839.20 translator fees).\n\n262.\n\nIn accordance with Regulation 14(3)(e) of the ICSID Administrative and Financial Regulations, the Applicant has been solely responsible for the advance payments to cover the fees and expenses of the Committee and ICSID.\n\n263.\n\nIn deciding how to allocate the costs of these proceedings, the Committee has been guided by the principle that \"costs follow the event\" if there are no indications that a different approach is called for. The Committee has found no such indications in this case. Indeed, the Respondent has prevailed in totality. What is more, it has been forced to go through the process and should not be burdened further by having to pay for its defense. The Committee does acknowledge however that both Parties and their counsel have conducted the proceedings diligently and efficiently.\n\n264.\n\nThe Committee therefore concludes that the Applicant is to bear all ICSID costs, *i.e.,* the fees and expenses of the members of the *ad hoc* Committee and of the ICSID Secretariat, amounting to USD 346,141.53,219 as well as Turkey\u2019s legal costs and expenses, amounting to USD 1,075,156.93.\n\nThe amount includes estimated charges (courier, printing, and copying) in respect of the dispatch of this Decision. The ICSID Secretariat will provide the Parties with a detailed financial statement of the case account as soon as all of the invoices are received and the account is final.\n\n**VII. DECISION**\n-----------------\n\n265.\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, the *ad hoc* Committee decides unanimously that:\n\n(1) The Applicant's claims for annulment under Article 52(1)(b), Article 52(1)(d) and Article 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention are dismissed in their entirely;\n\n(2) The Applicant shall bear the full costs and expenses incurred by lCSID in these annulment proceedings, including the fees and expenses of the Members of the Committee;\n\n(3) The Applicant shall bear Turkey\u2019s legal expenses and costs."}]}
