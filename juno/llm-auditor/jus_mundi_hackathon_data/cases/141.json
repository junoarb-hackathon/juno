The six Claimants comprise corporations and natural persons as follows:\n\n(a) Hydro S.r.l, and Costruzioni S.r.l (\"**Costruzioni**\"), two companies incorporated in Italy (collectively, the **\"Corporate Claimants**\"); and\n\n(b) Francesco Becchetti, Mauro De Renzis, Stefania Grigolon and Liliana Condomitti (collectively, the \"**Individual Claimants**\"), each of whom has either a direct, or indirect, ownership interest in one or both of the Corporate Claimants.\n\n1.3.\n\nThe Corporate Claimants own, directly or indirectly, a number of Albanian corporate entities; specifically, 400 KV Sh.p.k (\"**400 KV**\"), Cable System Sh.p.k (\"**Cable System**\"), Energji Sh.p.k (**Energji**\"), and Agonset Sh.p.k (\"**Agonset**\") (collectively, the \"**Claimants' Albanian Entities**\"). The Claimants' investments in Albania are, or are held by, these Albanian corporate entities. In response to a request from the Tribunal, the Claimants filed a flowchart of the companies and shareholders mentioned in their Request for Provisional Measures dated 5 December 2015 (the \"**Application**\"), a copy of such flowchart being attached, for convenience, as Annexure A to this Order.\n\n1.4.\n\nThe Claimants allege that the Respondent has sought to undermine its investments in Albania in a number of ways. At a high level of generality the allegations made by the Claimants are as follows:\n\n(a) the launch of tax audit proceedings against the Claimants' Albanian Entities as a pretext for not issuing value added tax (\"**VAT**\") refunds to those companies, which the Claimants say they are entitled to under certain tax concession agreements;\n\n(b) the grant of preferential treatment to other Albanian companies offering a similar service as the Albanian Entities;\n\n(c) the launch of money laundering investigations into both the Albanian Entities and the Individual Claimants;\n\n(d) the seizure and sequestration of the bank accounts and assets of the Albanian Entities, in an effort to make the operation of the Albanian Entities virtually impossible; and\n\n(e) the issue of arrest warrants against Mr Becchetti, Mr De Renzis and Ms Erjona Troplini.\n\n1.5.\n\nThis Order deals with the Application. In the Application, the Claimants requested the Tribunal to order the Respondent to:\n\n(a) suspend the criminal proceedings identified as Criminal Proceeding No. 1564 and any other criminal proceedings directly related to the present arbitration until this arbitration is completed and consequently withdraw its Requests for Extradition submitted to the Home Office of the United Kingdom dated 21 July 2015, as well as the arrest warrants for Mr Becchetti, Mr De Renzis, and Ms Troplini;\n\n(b) withdraw the orders of execution issued by the Tirana Prosecutor's Office on 8 June 2015 to sequester the assets of each of the Claimants' Albanian Companies and freeze these companies' bank accounts in Albania;\n\n(c) suspend or refrain from bringing any actions against the Claimants or their investments to establish or collect on any alleged tax, customs, or other liability to the Respondent disputed in this arbitration until this arbitration is completed;\n\n(d) refrain from initiating any other proceedings, criminal or otherwise, directly or indirectly related to the present arbitration or engaging in any other course of action that may aggravate the dispute, jeopardize the procedural integrity of this arbitration, and/or violate the Respondent's obligation to respect the exclusive resolution of its dispute with the Claimants in this forum; and\n\n(e) pay to the Claimants the full costs of the Application.1\n\nApplication, paragraph 171.\n\n1.6.\n\nOn 16 December 2015, after receiving submissions from the Parties as to an appropriate timetable, the Tribunal set a timetable for the filing of further submissions regarding the Application.\n\n1.7.\n\nOn 20 January 2016, and in accordance with the timetable set by the Tribunal, the Respondent submitted its Response to the Claimants' Request for Provisional Measures (\"**Response**\"). The Respondent requested the Tribunal to:\n\n(a) reject the Application; and\n\n(b) order the Claimants to pay the Respondent's costs of and incidental to responding to the Application in a sum to be assessed or agreed.2\n\nResponse, paragraph 257.\n\n1.8.\n\nOn 28 January 2016, the Claimants submitted their Reply to the Respondent's Answer (\"**Reply**\"). In the Reply, the Claimants reiterated the relief sought in the Application, albeit seeking relief in slightly different form and they no longer pressed for an order in relation to arrest warrant in respect of Ms Troplini. The Claimants specifically requested that the Tribunal order the Respondent to suspend the Insolvency Proceedings No. 605 registered in the Tirana Judicial District Court on 11 November 2014.\n\n1.9.\n\nOn 5 February 2016, the Respondent submitted its Rejoinder on Provisional Measures (\"**Rejoinder**\"), repeating its prayer for relief, namely that the Application be rejected and a costs order be made in its favour.\n\n1.10.\n\nOn 10 February 2015, a hearing by teleconference was held. The following persons participated in the hearing:\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| **Tribunal** |\n| Dr Michael Pryles AO PBM - *President* Dr Charles Poncet MCL - *Arbitrator* Mr Ian Glick QC - *Arbitrator* | Dr Albert Dinelli - *Assistant to the Tribunal* Mr Francisco Abriani - *Secretary to the Tribunal* |\n| **Claimants** | **Respondent** |\n| Dr Philippe Pinsolle Dr Tai-Heng Cheng Mr Alexander Leventhal Mr Marco Garofalo *Quinn Emmanuel Urquhart & Sullivan* | Mr David Breslin Ms Karen O'Connell Ms Jameela Sastre Ms Emily Airton *Gowling WLG (UK) LLP* |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Mr David W Rivkin | Mr Siddharth Dhar |\n| Mr Christopher Tahbaz | Mr Peter Webster |\n| Ms Ina Popova *Debevoise & Plimpton LLP* | *Essex Court Chambers* |\n|  | Ms Alma Hicka |\n| Mr Alexandre de Fontmichel | Ms Brunilda Lilo |\n| *Scemla Loizon Veverka & de Fontmichel* | *State Advocates, Republic of Albania* |\n| Mr Karel Daele *Mischon de Reya LLP* |  |\n| Mr Francesco Becchetti |  |\n\n1.11.\n\nDr Pinsolle and Mr Rivkin made submissions on behalf of the Claimants, and Mr Dhar made submissions on behalf of the Respondent.\n\n**PART II: THE PARTIES' SUBMISSIONS**\n-------------------------------------\n\n**A. Summary of Investments**\n-----------------------------\n\n2.1.\n\nThe Claimants' investments in Albania are essentially three-fold: (i) a hydroelectric plant in Kalivag; (ii) a waste management facility; and (iii) a TV station named Agonset.\n\n2.2.\n\nIn or about May 1997, the Third Claimant, Mr Becchetti, through an Italian entity known as Becchetti Energy Group S.p.a (\"**BEG**\") contracted with the Respondent to build a hydroelectric plant in the Kalivag.3 BEG and the Respondent signed a concession agreement which the Claimants allege entitled BEG (through a concession company) to a full VAT exemption.4 The Claimants allege that the Respondent has not granted, and refuses to grant, any VAT exemptions to the concession company, and has launched tax audits into the hydroelectric plant, and offered preferential treatment to other hydroelectric plant providers.\n\nApplication, paragraph 11.\n\nApplication, paragraph 12.\n\n2.3.\n\nIn or about May 2004, the Second Claimant, Costruzioni, through one of its Albanian entities, Cable System, contracted with the Respondent to build and operate a waste management facility that would service Albania's capital, Tirana, via another VAT concession agreement.5 The Claimants allege that the facility never came to fruition due to the Respondent's various repudiations of the concession agreement.6 Costruzioni, along with other investors in the waste management facility have launched separate ICSID proceedings under the Energy Charter Treaty in relation to that concession agreement (namely, ICSID Case No. ARB/15/28).\n\nApplication, paragraph 20.\n\nApplication, paragraph 22.\n\n2.4.\n\nIn 2012, Mr Becchetti launched a television company named Agonset, after receiving authorisation to do so from the Albanian media regulator. Agonset began broadcasting in Albania in or about April 2013, and, it is said by the Claimants, soon became very popular.7 The Claimants allege that Albania has imposed, unjustifiably and unlawfully, over \u20ac1,500,000 in taxes and duties for Agonset's technological equipment, and has also prevented Agonset from participating in a contest for digital broadcasting rights, thus harming its future viability as a broadcaster.8\n\nApplication, paragraphs 25-26.\n\nApplication, paragraph 27.\n\n2.5.\n\nThe Claimants submit that, in response to the filing of this arbitration, and two other arbitrations (ICSID Case No ARB/14/26, and ICC Case No. 20564/EMT) (the \"**Other Arbitrations**\"), all regarding disputes involving these investments, the Respondent has commenced, by way of retaliation a number of administrative and criminal proceedings against the Claimants. Those proceedings are, it is alleged, geared towards preventing the Claimants from being able to pursue their rights in this proceeding, and the Other Arbitrations. Specifically, the Claimants allege that the Respondent's actions:\n\n(a) violate the Claimants' right to non-aggravation of the dispute;\n\n(b) violate Claimants' right to procedural integrity of this arbitration; and\n\n(c) breach the Respondent's consent to settle this dispute through arbitration exclusively.\n\n**B. Administrative Proceedings: Tax Investigations**\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n***(a) Claimants' Submissions***\n--------------------------------\n\n2.6.\n\nThe Claimants say that the Respondent has (i) engaged in unwarranted tax investigations into the various Claimants and their Albanian entities; and (ii) sought to collect on tax amounts that the Claimants dispute in the current proceedings.9\n\nApplication, paragraphs 35 - 40.\n\n2.7.\n\nThe Claimants allege that, in or about December 2013, shortly after the Respondent had received letters from Costruzioni, and Albaniabeg Ambient Sh.p.k (\"**Albaniabeg**\") (being another of the Claimants' Albanian entities) putting them on notice of treaty violations, the Respondent launched a tax investigation into Agonset. It is then alleged that, shortly thereafter, the Respondent also commenced tax investigations into the Claimants' Albanian entities which had financed Agonset. The Claimants say that these investigations were, and are, baseless, especially given that Agonset was in its infancy and had not yet turned a profit. The Claimants' essential complaint in this respect is that the tax investigations were retaliatory, that proposition being evidenced by their commencement shortly after letters had been sent by Costruzioni and Albaniabeg to the Respondent.\n\n***(b) Respondent's Submissions***\n----------------------------------\n\n2.8.\n\nThe Respondent contends that there is no evidentiary link between the letters sent by Costruzioni and Albaniabeg, and the commencement of tax investigations into Agonset, especially given that those letters were in respect of the Claimants' waste management facility investment.10\n\nResponse, paragraph 124.\n\n2.9.\n\nAs to Agonset being in its infancy, the Respondent submits that this fact does not mean that the Albanian tax authorities are not entitled to investigate it, nor does it mean that the investigation lacked *bona fides*.11\n\nResponse, paragraph 132.\n\n2.10.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the \"investigations\" into Cable System and 400 KV were not really investigations at all, but, rather, were merely requests for documentation to verify loan transactions granted to Agonset.12\n\nResponse, paragraph 129.\n\n2.11.\n\nFurther, the Respondent contends that Agonset has not been a \"mere passive recipient\" of the tax investigations as it makes out in their submissions, but in fact challenged, successfully, the Respondent's decision not to grant VAT exemptions in the Tirana Administrative Court. The Respondent says that evidences that the situation is not the \"one-sided history of oppression the Claimants would wish the tribunal to believe\".13\n\nResponse, paragraph 127.\n\n2.12.\n\nThe Respondent ultimately submits that, in any event, none of the matters complained of pose a risk of irreparable harm to the Claimants or their investments, nor is there any urgency in respect of any of the complaints.\n\n**C. Administrative Proceedings: Forcible Collection of Tax Amounts**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n***(a) Claimants' Submissions***\n--------------------------------\n\n2.13.\n\nThe Claimants further complain that the Respondent has forcibly attempted to collect disputed tax amounts by commencing insolvency proceedings against Energji on 7 November 2014, with the planned outcome to \"destroy Energji\".14\n\nApplication, paragraph 42.\n\n2.14.\n\nThe Claimants complain that, in order to challenge those insolvency proceedings in Albanian courts, they were required to \"pre-pay\" the taxes, which they did by a bank guarantee. The Claimants say that the guarantee was later revoked because the Respondent intimidated the bank giving the guarantee.15\n\nApplication, paragraph 42.\n\n2.15.\n\nFurther, the Claimants complain about the Respondent having imposed various mortgage and security liens over its Albanian entity, KGE Sh.p.k (\"**KEG**\"), in order to force it to surrender taxes and pay penalties that the Respondent alleges are owing to it.16\n\nApplication, paragraph 43.\n\n***(b) Respondent's Submissions***\n----------------------------------\n\n2.16.\n\nThe Respondent contends that the tax investigations, to which the insolvency proceedings relate, were commenced well before the commencement of this, or the Other Arbitrations, and thus cannot be seen to be retaliatory.17 Furthermore, the Respondent submits that only an application to commence insolvency proceedings has been made by the Respondent, but no actual insolvency proceedings have commenced.18\n\nResponse, paragraph 142.\n\nResponse, paragraph 141(2).\n\n2.17.\n\nThe Respondent submits that it is perfectly reasonable for it to have taken the steps to recover the disputed tax amounts in the manner it has, which it considers are legitimately owed, especially where the Claimants admit that it has been withholding VAT from the Respondent's tax authority.19\n\nResponse, paragraph 145.\n\n2.18.\n\nThe Respondent contends that: (i) the requirement under Albanian law to pre-pay the tax amount in dispute before an appeal can be heard is not a requirement unique to Albania; (ii) denies that it intimidated the bank providing the guarantee; and (iii) contends that, in any event, the Claimants did in fact pre-pay the amount (or at least did so in part) in or about April 2015.20\n\nResponse, paragraphs 146(1)-(2).\n\n2.19.\n\nLastly, the Respondent submits that the Claimants have not justified why the imposition of a lien over KGE was an impermissible exercise of the Respondent's authority, or what detriment it has suffered due to that lien being imposed. Accordingly, the Respondent says that this cannot be held to be a legitimate ground of criticism.21\n\nResponse, paragraphs 148-149.\n\n**D. Criminal Proceedings: Introduction**\n-----------------------------------------\n\n2.20.\n\nThe Claimants also contend that the Respondent had taken a number measures against it through Albanian criminal proceedings. The bulk of the Claimants' complaints relate to the measures taken in relation to money laundering investigations against both the Individual Claimants and the Albanian Entities. Further, the Claimants also complain of an incident that occurred at Tirana airport, to which the Tribunal turns first.\n\n**E. Criminal Proceedings: Airport Incident**\n---------------------------------------------\n\n***(a) Claimants' Submissions***\n--------------------------------\n\n2.21.\n\nThe Claimants submit that, on or about 1 July 2014, Mr Becchetti was assaulted and threatened by a customs officer at the Tirana International Airport. They contend that Mr Becchetti was detained for a short time, before being released, and later charged with a criminal act.22\n\nApplication, paragraph 46.\n\n2.22.\n\nThe Claimants further complain that Mr Becchetti was given no notice of the criminal investigation, and that Mr Becchetti was assigned a public defence lawyer, rather than his chosen counsel in the subsequent criminal proceedings.23\n\nApplication, paragraph 47.\n\n2.23.\n\nThe Claimants allege that these events \"can only be explained by an order from the government\".24\n\nRequest for Arbitration dated 10 June 2015 (\"**Request**\"), paragraph 118.\n\n***(b) Respondent's Submissions***\n----------------------------------\n\n2.24.\n\nIn response, the Respondent tendered video footage of the \"airport incident\" which it said clearly showed Mr Becchetti assaulting the customs officer.25\n\nExhibit R-0001.\n\n2.25.\n\nIn any event, the Respondent concedes that there were some \"procedural flaws\" with regard to the subsequent criminal prosecution, which resulted in Mr Becchetti not being properly notified of the proceedings against him. Indeed, the Respondent notes that, at a directions hearing in the criminal proceedings, the District Court of Tirana dismissed the charges against Mr Becchetti on the basis of the procedural flaws.26\n\nResponse, paragraph 29(4).\n\n**F. Criminal Proceedings: Sequestration and Seizure of Documents**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n***(a) Claimants' Submissions***\n--------------------------------\n\n2.26.\n\nThe Claimants submit that, on or about 21 April 2014, Albanian prosecutorial authorities sequestered the building plans of the hydroelectric plant in Kalivac and other documents on the basis of a discrepancy between the cost of the project at its inception in 1997, and the total cost ten years later in 2007. The Claimants say that this sequestration order occurred at the same time as the tax investigations into the Albanian Entities.27\n\nApplication, paragraph 50.\n\n2.27.\n\nThe Claimants also take issue with the further sequestrations of documents, on or about 23 June 2014, which, on this occasion, covered a much wider range of documents. It is said this further sequestration was done under the guise of Criminal Proceeding No. 1564, the Claimants noting that they were not even notified those proceedings had commenced. Further sequestration orders were made on 26 June 2014, 23 December 2014, 20 January 2015, and 27 April 2015, each time for more documents relating to the construction of the hydroelectric plant.28\n\nApplication, paragraph 57.\n\n***(b) Respondent's Submissions***\n----------------------------------\n\n2.28.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the prosecution decision to sequester the documents it did is justified when it is understood that the prosecution was trying to establish a basis for the difference between what works had been carried out at the hydroelectric plant, and what those works might have, or should have, cost.29 The inference throughout these criminal proceedings was money transferred between the Claimants' Albanian Entities, including the concession entity created to build the hydroelectric plant, was suspicious, and that the transactions may involve money laundering.\n\nResponse, paragraph 41.\n\n2.29.\n\nThe Respondent further contends that the criticism that the Claimants were not told about the criminal proceedings being commenced is misguided. They rely on Albanian law providing that a prosecutor is under a legal obligation to keep those proceedings confidential.30\n\nResponse, paragraphs 44-46.\n\n**G. Criminal Proceedings: Arrest Warrants and Extradition Proceedings**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n***(a) Claimants' Submissions***\n--------------------------------\n\n2.30.\n\nThe Claimants contend that, on 5 June 2015, Albanian prosecutors obtained arrest warrants for Mr Becchetti, Mr De Renzis, and a business partner, Ms Erjona Troplini, who is not a party to this arbitration.31 The Claimants say that Mr Becchetti, Mr De Renzis and Ms Troplini were not notified that criminal proceedings had been commenced against them, and in the case of Ms Troplini, she had been arrested before her arrest warrant was prepared.32\n\nApplication, paragraph 59.\n\nApplication, paragraph 60.\n\n2.31.\n\nThe arrest warrants were based on three charges:\n\n(a) money laundering, namely that the monies used to fund the hydroelectric plant were transferred from abroad indicating that they are the product of illegal criminal activity;33\n\n(b) falsification of documents, namely that Energji had invoiced KGE for works that were never performed;34 and\n\n(c) tax evasion, namely that Mr De Renzis, as administrator of Energji, had failed to pay levies and taxes owing to Albania.35\n\nApplication, paragraph 62(a).\n\nApplication, paragraph 62(b).\n\nApplication, paragraph 62(c).\n\n2.32.\n\nThe Claimants contend that the reasoning behind these arrest warrants lacked merit, and were in violation of due process and Albanian law, on the basis that: (i) a report supporting the money laundering charges was not independent; (ii) the accused were not given a chance to participate in the making of that report; and (iii) the arrest warrants purported to establish criminal liability for the directors of the impugned companies without presenting any proof that those directors were directly involved in the alleged violations.36\n\nApplication, paragraphs 65-67.\n\n2.33.\n\nThe Claimants further submit that, in the case of Mr Becchetti and Mr De Renzis, who face extradition from the United Kingdom as a result of the arrest warrants, their prospective incarceration in Albania prevents them from managing their businesses, and participating in this arbitration.37\n\nApplication, paragraphs 4, 161.\n\n***(b) Respondent's Submissions***\n----------------------------------\n\n2.34.\n\nThe Respondent submits that, according to Albanian criminal procedure, an arrest warrant can be granted before official charges are brought, so the Claimants' complaint in respect of not being notified of the criminal proceedings is misguided.38 The Respondent emphasises that the arrest warrants were issued by an independent court (namely the District Court of Tirana), and that the judgments of that court note that the arrest warrants were the culmination of a long-running investigation.39\n\nResponse, paragraph 50(2).\n\nExhibits C-102, C-103.\n\n2.35.\n\nIn any event, the Respondent contends that the arrest warrants were issued as a part of Criminal Proceeding No. 1564, which had commenced on 24 February 2014, well before the arrest warrants were issued, and submit that \"the investigation being conducted under [Criminal Proceeding No. 1564] led the authorities to suspect that Mr Becchetti (and Mr De Renzis) were guilty of various crimes and the proceedings against them were joined to the existing criminal case\".40\n\nResponse, paragraph 55.\n\n2.36.\n\nThe Respondent denies that the arrest warrants lack detail, and point to the decision of the District Court of Tirana where the reasons for granting the arrest warrants against Mr Becchetti and Mr De Renzis were considered in detail. It points to the District Court's summary in its decision that:\n\n(a) Energji had on a number of occasions invoiced works to KGE that were never carried out, had overcharged for the services that it did provide, and had inflated the costs of subcontractor invoices that it passed onto KGE;\n\n(b) as a result, KGE declared that it was entitled to a far larger VAT credit from Albania than that to which it was otherwise entitled;\n\n(c) Energji failed to pay its tax obligations in the amount of 770,423,159 Albanian Lek;\n\n(d) a fictitious arbitration occurred between Energji and KGE, which resulted in a \u20ac15,000,000 payment to Energji, which was subsequently invested in 400 KV, Cable System, and Costruzioni, and which was later invested in Agonset;\n\n(e) the money invested in Agonset should have been used to satisfy Energji's tax debt to the Respondent;\n\n(f) there was enough information to charge Mr Becchetti, Mr De Renzis, Ms Troplini and Ms Liliana Condomitti with tax evasion, document forgery and money laundering; and\n\n(g) the arrest of Mr Becchetti was justified given the nature of the crimes.41\n\nResponse, paragraph 59; Exhibit C-102.\n\n2.37.\n\nThe Respondent ultimately contends that the reasons behind the granting of the arrest warrant were well-considered and detailed in the District Court's reasons. The Respondent further points out that, when Mr Becchetti and Mr De Renzis appealed the granting of the warrants, that appeal was dismissed by the Albanian Court of Appeal.42\n\nResponse, paragraph 68.\n\n2.38.\n\nAs to the extradition of Messrs Becchetti and De Renzis, the Respondent denies that the two accused will be precluded from participating in this arbitration, as the extradition procedure in the United Kingdom is likely to be lengthy, and may involve multiple appeals.43 In any event the Respondent submits that the extradition proceedings, before English courts, provide an existing neutral forum for the validity of the Claimants' factual allegations regarding the propriety of the Albanian criminal proceedings to be tested.44\n\nResponse, paragraphs 169(1), 172(1).\n\nResponse, paragraph 169(2).\n\n**H. Criminal Proceedings: Sequestration of Assets**\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n***(a) Claimants' Submissions***\n--------------------------------\n\n2.39.\n\nThe Claimants submit that, on 5 June 2015, the same day that the arrest warrants were issued, the District Court of Tirana also issued sequestration orders allowing the sequestration of the assets of Mr Becchetti, Mr De Renzis, and Ms Condomitti in proportion to the shares they held in the Albanian Entities, and that those orders did not explain the basis on which they were made, nor the specific assets to be seized.45 The Claimants take issue with the fact that these proceedings were, essentially, *ex parte*.\n\nApplication, paragraph 68.\n\n2.40.\n\nSubsequently, on 8 and 9 June 2015, orders were made sequestering the assets and bank accounts of the Albanian Entities.46\n\nExhibits C-110, C-113.\n\n2.41.\n\nThe Claimants submit that the sequestering of the company bank accounts has been particularly devastating as the Albanian Entities and the Corporate Claimants have not been able to make any payment to their creditors, including for utility costs, wages, taxes and other liabilities.47 The result is that the Claimants are incurring significant penalties from their creditors.\n\nApplication, paragraph 76.\n\n2.42.\n\nThe Claimants contend that the Respondent's agency in charge of sequestered assets (the \"**AASCP**\") has breached its duty to order payment of \"expenses necessary or useful to safeguard and administer the sequestered assets\".48\n\nApplication, paragraph 76.\n\n2.43.\n\nThe Claimants further contend that the sequestering of the assets of Agonset (i.e. broadcasting equipment) was completely unnecessary and unjustified in light of the criminal investigation of money laundering, document forgery and tax evasion, as the Agonset equipment had no evidentiary value to any of those charges.49 In October 2015, Agonset ceased broadcasting in Albania, unable to operate after the sequestration of its bank accounts and seizure of its technical equipment.50\n\nApplication, paragraph 79.\n\nApplication, paragraph 95.\n\n***(b) Respondent's Submissions***\n----------------------------------\n\n2.44.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the sequestration orders, much like the arrest warrants, were supported by considered reasons of the District Court of Tirana. That court produced a 20 page judgment setting out its reasons for granting the sequestration orders against the Individual Claimants and the Albanian Entities.51 The Respondent submits that it is hardly surprising that Albanian prosecution sought to freeze the assets of the Albanian entities, including the bank accounts implicated in the suspected money laundering scheme.52\n\nResponse, paragraph 102; Exhibit C-110.\n\nResponse, paragraph 104.\n\n2.45.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the *ex parte* nature of the sequestration application is common sense, given that, if the accused were \"tipped-off\" about the sequestration application, they might seek to hide assets connected to the alleged crime.53\n\nResponse, paragraph 106.\n\n2.46.\n\nThe Respondent further emphasises that the Claimants have not been deprived of their proprietary rights in their assets, as their assets are merely frozen pending the resolution of the criminal proceedings.54\n\nResponse, paragraph 107.\n\n2.47.\n\nThe Respondent denies that there is any impropriety in the sequestration order not specifying particular assets to be frozen, as the order specified a Euro or Lek value of the assets to be frozen.55 Moreover it says there is no abnormality with the prosecution deciding to freeze the bank accounts of the accused and the Albanian entities, given that the court order allowing the sequestration specifically referred to the sequestration of \"mobile articles including bank accounts\".56\n\nResponse, paragraph 109.\n\nResponse, paragraph 112.\n\n2.48.\n\nAs to the administration of the sequestered assets by the AASCP, the Respondent submits that the Claimants has not properly particularised how the AASCP has failed to administer the assets, provided particulars about the impact of those particulars, or provided evidence of the Claimants' requests to the AASCP, except for a letter sent by the Chairman of the Commission for Education (and not the Claimants) on 21 October 2015 in respect of Agonset.57\n\nResponse, paragraph 115.\n\n2.49.\n\nAs to the reasons for sequestering the assets of Agonset (specifically, the broadcasting equipment), the Respondent submits this was logical because on the prosecution's case, those goods may have been purchased with laundered money.58\n\nResponse, paragraph 116.\n\n**PART III: TRIBUNAL'S DETERMINATION**\n--------------------------------------\n\n3.1.\n\nHaving carefully considered the submissions of the Parties, the Tribunal has decided to grant the Application in part.\n\n3.2.\n\nDespite the length of the submissions, and extensive material, filed on behalf of each Party, the ultimate resolution of the Application turns on various discrete issues as part of a careful analysis of the material in relation to what, for the most part, are accepted principles. Insofar as any of the arguments summarised above are not referred to below, that should not be taken to mean that the argument has not been considered. Rather, all arguments have been considered, and the analysis that follows is intended to set out the reasoning of the Tribunal so as to explain the basis of its decision, rather than reciting its consideration of each and every argument. Not only is this sufficient, but it is appropriate where there is, at least in the view of the Claimants, an urgency attendant to the Tribunal's determination of this application.\n\n3.3.\n\nBefore turning to the reasons for the Order, it is necessary to deal first with some preliminary matters, namely jurisdiction and the appropriate standard to be applied.\n\n**A. Jurisdiction**\n-------------------\n\n3.4.\n\nThe Application is made pursuant to Article 47 of the ICSID Convention and Rule 39 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules.\n\n3.5.\n\nArticle 47 of the ICSID Convention provides:\n\n\"[T]he Tribunal may, if it considers that the circumstances so require, recommend any provisional measures which should be taken to preserve the respective rights of either party.\"\n\n3.6.\n\nRule 39(1) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules provides:\n\n\"At any time after the institution of the proceeding, a party may request that provisional measures for the preservation of its rights be recommended by the Tribunal. The request shall specify the rights to be preserved, the measures the recommendation of which is requested, and the circumstances that require such measures.\"\n\n3.7.\n\nThe Tribunal has no hesitation in confirming its jurisdiction to hear, and determine, the Claimants' Request. While acknowledging that the Respondent has made various jurisdictional objections, each of which will be considered in due course, those objections do not prevent the consideration by the Tribunal, and its consideration now, of a request for provisional measures. It is not in issue that an ICSID tribunal may recommend provisional measures even where it is yet to decide the question of its jurisdiction.59\n\n*Quiborax SA, Non Metallic Minerals SA & Allan Fosk Kapl\u00fan v Plurinational State of Bolivia*, ICSID Case No. ARB/06/2, Decision on Provisional Measures (26 February 2010), \u00a7105 (CL-5).\n\n3.8.\n\nThe Claimants contend, and the Tribunal accepts, that all that is required is that the provisions invoked appear *prima facie* to afford a basis for jurisdiction to decide the merits. While the Tribunal has not yet finally determined that it has jurisdiction on the merits of the case, it is satisfied that the provisions invoked by the Claimants are such that this Tribunal has the requisite *prima facie* jurisdiction. Indeed, the Respondent does not strongly contend otherwise.\n\n3.9.\n\nSo, therefore, it is clear that the ICSID Convention and the ICSID Arbitration Rules provide a sufficient basis for the existence of the Tribunal's power to decide the questions the subject of the Claimants' Application.\n\n**B. The Appropriate Standard**\n-------------------------------\n\n3.10.\n\nThe second preliminary matter is the appropriate test to be applied.\n\n3.11.\n\nThe Parties agree on the fundamental standards that are applicable to a request for provisional measures, namely that such measures are necessary to protect the applicant's rights, are urgent and are proportionate.\n\n3.12.\n\nIt is also right to acknowledge that there is a high threshold for the Tribunal to recommend the making of provisional measures.\n\n3.13.\n\nSome ICSID tribunals have utilised terminology suggestive of a lower standard, particularly *PNG v Papua New Guinea*, where the tribunal used language suggestive of a distinction between a higher threshold of \"irreparable\" harm and a lower, and preferable one, in their view, of some \"serious harm\".60 More fully, the tribunal in that proceeding explained that \"the term \u2018irreparable' harm is properly understood as requiring a showing of a material risk of serious or grave damage to the requesting party, and not harm that is literally \u2018irreparable' in what is sometimes regarded as the narrow common law sense of the term. The degree of \u2018gravity' or \u2018seriousness' of harm that is necessary for an order of provisional relief cannot be specified with precision, and depends in part on the circumstances of the case, the nature of the relief requested and the relative harm to be suffered by each party\". The tribunal continued, \"suffice it to say that substantial, serious harm, even if not irreparable, is generally sufficient to satisfy this element of the standard for granting provisional measures\".61\n\n*PNG Sustainable Development Program Ltd v Independent State of Papua New Guinea*, ICSID Case No. ARB/13/33, Decision on the Claimant's Request for Provisional Measures (21 January 2015), \u00a7109 (CL-14).\n\n*PNG Sustainable Development Program Ltd v Independent State of Papua New Guinea*, ICSID Case No. ARB/13/33, Decision on the Claimant's Request for Provisional Measures (21 January 2015), \u00a7109 (CL-14).\n\n3.14.\n\nWhile it is not necessary in this case to set out the test that would apply in all cases of requests for provisional measures, it is necessary to ascertain what test is appropriate in the circumstances of a case, such as this, where the relief sought would interfere with the exercise of a sovereign State's rights and duties to investigate and prosecute crime.\n\n3.15.\n\nNo doubt, it was this concern which underlay the approach of the tribunal in *Caratube v Kazakhstan*, where it explained:\n\n\"This Tribunal feels that a particularly high threshold must be overcome before an ICSID tribunal can indeed recommend provisional measures regarding criminal investigations conducted by a state.\"62\n\n*Caratube International Oil Company LLP v The Republic of Kazakhstan*, ICSID Case No. ARB/08/12, Decision on Provisional Measures (31 July 2009), \u00a7137 (RL-11).\n\n3.16.\n\nIt is trite to say that criminal law and procedure are a most obvious and undisputed part of a State's sovereignty. That (trite) fact supports the approach adopted here by the Tribunal, namely that any obstruction of the investigation or prosecution of conduct that is reasonably suspected to be criminal in nature should only be ordered where that is absolutely necessary. As will be seen, the Tribunal is satisfied that this is such a case.\n\n**C. Rights relied upon**\n-------------------------\n\n3.17.\n\nThe Claimants identify three rights as the basis for their Request, namely: (i) the procedural integrity of the arbitration; (ii) the preservation of the *status quo* and the non-aggravation of the dispute; and (iii) the exclusivity of the ICSID proceedings under Article 26 of the ICSID Convention. It is not in issue that these rights, if relevantly infringed, are rights capable of protection by provisional measures.\n\n3.18.\n\nThe Tribunal is satisfied that a real question arises in relation to the procedural integrity of the arbitral proceedings. In particular, criminal proceedings have been brought against, *inter alia,* Mr Becchetti, who is one of the Claimants and who is perhaps the central person involved in the arbitration from the Claimants' side. In the case of Mr Becchetti (and Mr De Renzis), who face extradition from the United Kingdom as a result of the arrest warrants, their possible incarceration in Albania would prevent them from effectively managing their businesses, and fully participating in this arbitration. The Tribunal considers that this is a grave concern to the procedural integrity of the proceeding.\n\n3.19.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that there may be situations where incarceration of a claimant would disrupt an arbitration but where it would be improper for the tribunal to intervene. An example given by counsel is where a person is charged with a serious offence totally unrelated to the factual circumstances of the dispute being arbitrated, such as murder. But that is not the situation here. The alleged offences here are not divorced from the investments made by the Claimants.\n\n3.20.\n\nWhile the Tribunal is reluctant to interfere with the sovereignty of the Respondent, subject to considering whether the requirements of urgency, necessity and proportionality are met (discussed below), it sees no difficulty in recommending an order, the effect of which is not to deny the prospect of Mr Becchetti (and Mr De Renzis) being prosecuted for their alleged criminal conduct, but merely postpones that eventuality until the conclusion of this proceeding. That is to say, the Tribunal is satisfied that the procedural integrity of the proceeding would be protected by recommending that the criminal proceedings (and the associated extradition proceedings) be stayed pending resolution of this proceeding.\n\n3.21.\n\nThe Tribunal believes that the Parties may be able to agree on necessary steps to preserve the seized assets and the contents of the frozen bank accounts of the companies which are the subject of the investments in this dispute. Accordingly, the Tribunal proposes to make an order recommending that the Parties confer in this regard. If the Parties are unable to agree on such steps, the Tribunal will allow the Claimants to make a further application for provisional measures with a view to preserving the *status quo* of the investment companies involved. By inviting the Parties to confer, the Tribunal makes no determination as to the aforesaid measures.\n\n3.22.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that this is an appropriate means to resolve the issue, on the basis that the competing submissions suggest that a modicum of co-operation may be capable of being achieved in this regard. While the Respondent contends that any decline in the value of the Claimants' assets can be appropriately protected by an award of damages at a later point in time, the Tribunal also sees merit in that eventuality being avoided, if the Parties are able to resolve, between themselves, some preservation of the *status quo*, pending the resolution of this proceeding by Final Award.\n\n3.23.\n\nThe Tribunal is not persuaded that any provisional order should be made in order to protect the right of exclusivity of the arbitral proceedings. The prosecution of an offence is of a very different nature to the resolution of a civil claim where compensation is sought for the infringement of an alleged right.\n\n**D. Urgency, Necessity and Proportionality**\n---------------------------------------------\n\n3.24.\n\nThere is, sensibly, no disagreement between the Parties that an order of provisional measures can only be granted where the orders that are sought are urgent, necessary, and proportionate to the conduct complained of.\n\n***(a) Urgency***\n-----------------\n\n3.25.\n\nA number of tribunals and writers have opined on the \"urgency\" requirement and various formulations have been put forward. The Claimants refer to Professor Schreuer who has written that relief is urgent when \"a question cannot await the outcome of the award on the merits\".63 A similar definition was suggested in *Biwater Gauff v Tanzania,* where the Tribunal stated:\n\n\"[T]he degree of \u2018urgency' which is required depends on the circumstances, including the requested provisional measures, and may be satisfied where a party can prove that there is a need to obtain the requested measures at a certain point in the procedure before the issuance of an award.\"64\n\nC. Schreuer, *The ICSID Convention, A Commentary*, 2nd ed., Cambridge (2009), p. 775 (CL-4).\n\n*Biwater Gauff v. Tanzania*, Procedural Order No. 1 (31 March 2006) \u00a776.\n\n3.26.\n\nThe Claimants point out that in order for the criteria of urgency to be met, there must be an \"imminent\" risk that the rights of a party will be prejudiced before the tribunal has rendered its award.65\n\nReply, paragraph 36; C. Schreuer, *The ICSID Convention, A Commentary*, 2nd ed., Cambridge (2009) (CL-4), citing *Azurix v Argentina*, ICSID Case No ARB/01/12, \u00a733.\n\n3.27.\n\nThe Claimants also rely on the statement of the Tribunal in *Quiborax S.A v Bolivia,* where the Tribunal stated that in some circumstances measures to protect certain rights are urgent by definition:\n\n\"The Tribunal agrees with the Claimants that if measures are intended to protect the procedural integrity of the arbitration, in particular with respect to access to or integrity of the evidence, they are urgent by definition. **Indeed the question of whether a Party has the opportunity to present its case or rely on the integrity of specific evidence is essential to (and therefore cannot await) the rendering of an award on the merits**.\"66\n\nEmphasis added. *Quiborax S.A., et. al. v. Plurinational State of Bolivia*, ICSID Case No. ARB/06/2, Decision on Provisional Measures, February 26, 2010, \u00a7153 (CL-5).\n\n3.28.\n\nThe Claimants submit that the urgency in this case comes from the fact that two Claimants (namely, Messrs Becchetti and De Renzis) may soon find themselves incarcerated in Albania, for a period exceeding the present arbitration, if the extradition proceedings are not resolved in their favour.\n\n3.29.\n\nThe Respondent says, in respect of the extradition proceedings, there is no urgency because the extradition proceedings before the courts in the United Kingdom may take months to conclude. The Tribunal accepts that the extradition proceedings may take some time, perhaps weeks or even months. However if the British authorities decide to extradite, it would take some time for the Claimants to seek further orders from this Tribunal and extradition may be an accomplished fact by the time an order is made. The Tribunal therefore considers that there is an **imminent** risk to the Claimants' ability to effectively participate in this arbitration.\n\n3.30.\n\nThe Respondent says that in any event, the urgency in the Claimants' Application cannot be real because of the period of time which the Claimants delayed before making their application for provisional measures, a period of six or so months after commencing proceedings. Whatever may be said about this delay, the Tribunal is in no doubt that the measures sought are now urgent.\n\n***(b) Necessity***\n-------------------\n\n3.31.\n\nICSID tribunals have differed as to the correct approach to determining the requirement of necessity for provisional measures to be awarded. The Claimants and the Respondent however are agreed that the criteria requires that harm complained of would not adequately be reparable by an award of damages.67 Such a requirement is embodied in Article 17A of the UNCITRAL Model Law, which requires the party requesting an interim measure to satisfy the tribunal that:\n\n\"Harm not adequately reparable by an award of damages is likely to result if the measure is not ordered, and such harm substantially outweighs the harm that is likely to result to the party against whom the measure is directed if the measure is granted.\"\n\nApplication paragraph 167; Response paragraph 251; *Burlington Resources Inc v Republic of Ecuador and Empresa Estatal Petr\u00f3leos del Ecuador (PetroEcuador)*, ICSID Case No. ARB/08/5, Procedural Order No. 1 on Burlington Resource's Request for Provisional Measures (29 June 2009), \u00a775 (CL-7); *Quiborax SA Non Metallic Minerals SA v Plurinational State of Bolivia*, ICSID Case No. ARB/06/2, Decision on Provisional Measures (26 February 2010), \u00a7155 (CL-5).\n\n3.32.\n\nFollowing this standard, the Claimants submit that, first, allowing the criminal proceedings to proceed would cause irreparable harm to the integrity of this arbitration as it would hinder the Claimants' ability to effectively present its case before this Tribunal (i.e. if Mr Becchetti and Mr De Renzis are incarcerated). And secondly, allowing the administrative and criminal proceedings to continue by Albania would effectively destroy the Claimants' investments in Albania entirely.\n\n3.33.\n\nThe Respondent repeats the submission that the extradition proceedings may be some time away from concluding (and therefore the risk to their right not to be able to effectively participate in the arbitration is overstated), and submits that any such loss caused by putative wrongs (i.e. the criminal and administrative proceedings) to the Claimants' investments can perfectly well be remedied by damages.\n\n3.34.\n\nWhilst the destruction of the Claimants' investments in Albania may be capable of being repaired by an award of damages as the Respondent points out, the Claimants' ability to effectively participate in the arbitration, by definition, cannot be adequately remedied by damages.\n\n3.35.\n\nIn *City Oriente,* the Tribunal, referring to Article 17A of the UNCITRAL Model Law stated:\n\n\"It is not so essential that provisional measures be necessary to prevent irreparable harm, but that the harm spared by the petitioner by such measures must be significant and that it exceed greatly the damage caused to the party affected thereby.\"68\n\n*City Oriente Limited v. Republic of Ecuador and Empresa Estatal Petr\u00f3leos del Ecuador (Petroecuador)*, ICSID Case No. ARB/06/21, Decision on Revocation of Provisional Measures and other Procedural Matters (13 May 2008), \u00a772 (CL-18).\n\n3.36.\n\nThe ability of the Claimants to effectively participate in this arbitration, specifically Messrs Becchetti and De Renzis is extremely important. Not only are they Claimants in their own right but they are intimately connected with the Corporate Claimants.\n\n***(c) Proportionality***\n-------------------------\n\n3.37.\n\nIn granting provisional measures, the Tribunal must consider the proportionality of the provisional measures requested. Specifically, the Tribunal must balance the harm caused to the Claimants by the criminal proceedings and the harm that would be caused to the Respondent if those proceedings were stayed.\n\n3.38.\n\nThe Claimants assert that the measures sought are proportionate because the sovereign prerogatives of the Respondent, specifically its ability to prosecute crime, would not be affected by a stay of criminal proceedings because those proceedings may be resumed after the arbitration is concluded. They rely on the decisions in *Quiborax* and *Lao Holdings* in this respect.69\n\n*Quiborax S.A. v. Plurinational State of Bolivia,* ICSID Case No. ARB/06/2, Decision on Provisional Measures, 26 February 2010), \u00a7 165 (CL-5). See *Lao Holdings N.V. v. Lao People's Democratic Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/12/6, Ruling on Motion to Amend the Provisional Order (30 May 2014), \u00a7\u00a774-75 (CL-8).\n\n3.39.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the measures sought are not proportionate and would cause \"real harm to Albania and its people's interests\".70 The Respondent submits that the legal proceedings (especially the criminal proceedings) against the Claimants concern serious criminal wrongdoing and seek to collect substantial amounts of tax. They further say that a suspension of proceedings would allow the alleged wrongdoers to deal with what Albania says are assets tainted by criminality, and that the Claimants might completely dissipate those assets by the time it is allowed to resume its prosecution. The Respondent also points out that it is under an obligation, by virtue of the United Nations Convention against Corruption (2003), to collect proceeds of crime, especially in relation to money laundering.71\n\nResponse, paragraph 256.\n\nRejoinder, paragraph 97.\n\n3.40.\n\nThe Claimants submit that Albania, by signing the ICSID Convention, has accepted a tribunal's interference with its sovereign rights.72 In the Tribunal's view adherence to the ICSID Convention has some ramifications on the sovereign rights of a member state. The Tribunal also accepts the Respondent's submission that when a State investigates a crime, particularly in circumstances where the State is under an international obligation to do so, \"[t]he strongest of reasons need to be shown for impeding such an investigation\".73\n\nReply, paragraph 68.\n\nRejoinder, paragraph 95.\n\n3.41.\n\nIn this case the Tribunal has formed the view that the recommendation of provisional measures is, on balance, warranted. The extradition and criminal proceedings concern or relate to the factual circumstances at issue in this arbitration. The possible incarceration of Messrs Becchetti and De Renzis would affect the ability of these two claimants and indeed other claimants to adequately put their cases and participate in the arbitration. The effect of the provisional measures proposed would affect the Respondent's ability to proceed with the criminal prosecution in the immediate future. However a stay would not put an end to the criminal proceedings. They would be delayed but not terminated. The Respondent also adverts to the possibility of the Claimants dissipating assets if the criminal proceedings are stayed. Given that the investments are physically located in Albania, it is difficult to accept that this would be a major risk. The balance of proportionality comes down in favour of protecting the Claimants' rights.\n\n**PART IV: RELIEF CLAIMED**\n---------------------------\n\n4.1.\n\nIn paragraph 72 of the Claimants' Reply, they seek the following orders from the Tribunal, requiring the Respondent to:\n\n(a) suspend the proceedings identified as Criminal Proceeding No. 1564 until the issuance of a Final Award in this proceeding;\n\n(b) take all actions necessary to suspend the extradition proceedings currently pending as Case Numbers 1502751601 (for Mr Becchetti) and 1502752144 (for Mr De Renzis), until the issuance of a Final Award in this proceeding;\n\n(c) lift the seizure and security measures taken against the assets and bank accounts of Energji, KGE, 400 KV, Cable System, and Agonset, and against the Claimants' shareholdings in those companies, until the issuance of a Final Award in this proceeding;\n\n(d) suspend or refrain from bringing any actions against the Claimants or their investments to establish or collect on any alleged tax, customs, or other liability to the Respondent disputed in this arbitration until the issuance of a Final Award in this proceeding, including insolvency proceedings case no. 605 registered on November 11, 2014;\n\n(e) refrain from initiating any other proceedings, criminal or otherwise, directly or indirectly related to the present arbitration, or engaging in any other course of action that may aggravate the dispute, jeopardize the procedural integrity of this arbitration, and/or violate the Respondent's obligation to respect the exclusive resolution of its dispute with the Claimants in this forum;\n\n(f) pay to the Claimants the full costs of the Application; and\n\n(g) provide such other relief as the Tribunal may deem appropriate.\n\n4.2.\n\nAs the Tribunal has decided above, it considers that the measures set out in paragraphs 4.1(a) and 4.1(b) should be recommended in this case for the reasons set out above.\n\n4.3.\n\nIn relation to paragraph 4.1(c) above, the Tribunal is not presently of the view that any measure should be recommended to the Respondent. Rather, as noted above, the Tribunal has taken the view that it would be appropriate for the Parties to confer and attempt to agree measures to preserve the *status quo*. If such measures cannot be agreed, the Claimants may, if they wish, seek further provisional measures from the Tribunal; if that happens, the Tribunal will of course consider such application on its merits.\n\n4.4.\n\nThe Tribunal decides that it is not appropriate to make any recommendation proposed in the terms sought by the Claimants in paragraph 4.1(d) above. In the first place, the measures sought are very broad, encompassing suspending or refraining from bringing \"any actions against the Claimants or their investments\" and \"until the issuance of a Final Award\". Not only is this expressed in broad terms, but it is premature because it is directed at actions not yet initiated and which may or may not be initiated at some time in the future.\n\n4.5.\n\nAs set out in paragraph 4.1(e) above, the Claimants seek an order which the Tribunal believes is altogether too broad and indeed uncertain in its terms. The proposed measure is to refrain from initiating other proceedings \"directly or indirectly related to the present arbitration\" and also to \"engaging in any other course of action that may aggravate the dispute\". The terminology is too broad, vague and uncertain in scope and is in any event premature.\n\n4.6.\n\nThe Claimants also seek the cost of their Application. The Tribunal decides that all questions of costs including the cost of the Application should be determined in the Final Award. The Tribunal accordingly reserves the question of costs to the Final Award.\n\n**PART V: TRIBUNAL'S ORDER**\n----------------------------\n\n5.1.\n\nThe Tribunal recommends that the Republic of Albania:\n\n(a) suspend the proceedings identified as Criminal Proceeding No. 1564 until the issuance of a Final Award in this proceeding; and\n\n(b) take all actions necessary to suspend the extradition proceedings currently pending as Case Numbers 1502751601 (for Mr Becchetti) and 1502752144 (for Mr De Renzis), until the issuance of a Final Award in this proceeding.\n\n5.2.\n\nThe Tribunal invites the Republic of Albania to confer with the Claimants and seek to agree appropriate measures to be taken by the Republic of Albania to preserve:\n\n(a) the seized assets and the contents of the frozen bank accounts of Energji, KGE, 400 KV, Cable System, and Agonset; and\n\n(b) the current shareholdings in those companies.\n\n5.3.\n\nIn the event that the Republic of Albania and the Claimants are unable to agree appropriate measures to be taken by the Republic of Albania within the period of 60 days from the date of this order, the Claimants may apply to the Tribunal for further provisional measures."}, {"Title": "Decision on Claimants' Request for a Partial Award and Respondent's Application for Revocation or Modification of the Order on Provisional Measures", "Type": "Interim & Provisional Measures", "Date": "2016-09-01T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Decision on Claimants' Request for a Partial Award and Respondent's Application for Revocation or Modification of the Order on Provisional Measures\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**PART I: INTRODUCTION AND SUMMARY OF DECISION**\n------------------------------------------------\n\n**Introduction**\n----------------\n\n1.1.\n\nOn 3 March 2016, the Tribunal issued its Order on Provisional Measures (the \"**Tribunal's Order**\" or the \"**Order**\"). In the Order, the Tribunal made the following recommendations at Part V:\n\n\"5.1 The Tribunal recommends that the Republic of Albania:\n\n(a) suspend the proceedings identified as Criminal Proceeding No. 1564 until the issuance of a Final Award in this proceeding; and\n\n(b) take all actions necessary to suspend the extradition proceedings currently pending as Case Numbers 1502751601 (for Mr. Becchetti) and 1502752144 (for Mr. De Renzis), until the issuance of a Final Award in this proceeding.\n\n5.2 The Tribunal invites the Republic of Albania to confer with the Claimants and seek to agree appropriate measures to be taken by the Republic of Albania to preserve:\n\n(a) the seized assets and the contents of the frozen bank accounts of Energji [sh.p.k.], KGE [sh.p.k.], 400 KV [sh.p.k.], Cable System [sh.p.k.], and Agonset [sh.p.k.]; and\n\n(b) the current shareholdings in those companies.\n\n5.3 In the event that the Republic of Albania and the Claimants are unable to agree appropriate measures to be taken by the Republic of Albania within the period of 60 days from the date of this order, the Claimants may apply to the Tribunal for further provisional measures.\"\n\n1.2.\n\nShortly after the Tribunal's Order was issued, on 10 March 2016, the Claimants wrote to the Respondent requesting confirmation that they had complied, or were going to comply with, the Tribunal's Order. The Claimants also proposed the suspension of criminal proceedings and \"the consequential return of the Companies and their assets and bank accounts\" in order to satisfy paragraph 5.2 of the Tribunal's Order. They sought an answer by 17 March 2016. The Respondent's counsel replied indicating that they would take instructions.\n\n1.3.\n\nEight days thereafter, on 18 March 2016, the Claimants again wrote to the Respondent noting that they had received no response. The Respondent's counsel replied shortly thereafter, stating \"our clients are still considering the Order of the Tribunal of 3 March 2016 and the terms of your letter\". The Claimants replied that \"Albania's lack of engagement is simply not sufficient\", and reiterated its request that the Respondent provide it with assurances that it would immediately comply with the Tribunal's Order.\n\n1.4.\n\nOn 21 March 2016, both the Claimants and the Respondent wrote to the Tribunal.\n\n1.5.\n\nIn its letter dated 21 March 2016, the Claimants complained of what it said was \"Albania's lack of engagement and its refusal to comply with the Tribunal's Order\". The Claimants requested, as a matter of urgency, a telephone conference with the Tribunal. The Claimants further stated that they \"reserve[d] the right to seek appropriate measures from the Tribunal pursuant to paragraph 5.3 of the Order if the matter is not promptly resolved\".\n\n1.6.\n\nIn its letter of 21 March 2016, the Respondent said that it intended to make an application to the Tribunal pursuant to Rule 39(3) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules to \"revoke or alternatively modify the terms of\" the Tribunal's Order. It stated that the Respondent \"fully reserves its rights in respect of compliance with the Order pending any decision in respect of such application\".\n\n1.7.\n\nOn 22 March 2016, the Tribunal wrote to the Parties and stated that it did not consider a telephone conference necessary as neither Party had sought a specific order from the Tribunal, but it would consider an appropriate procedure for dealing with any such application if one were to be made.\n\n1.8.\n\nOn 25 March 2016, the Claimants made an Application for a Partial Award, or alternatively an Order, the contents of which are explained below (the \"**Claimants' Application**\"). The Tribunal invited the Respondent to reply, and it did so by submitting an Application to Revoke or Modify the Order on Provisional Measures (the \"**Respondent's Application**\") on 5 April 2016.\n\n1.9.\n\nIt is these two applications with which the Tribunal is presently vested.\n\n1.10.\n\nOn 18 April 2016, the Claimants submitted their Reply to the Respondent's Application (the \"**Claimants' Reply**\").\n\n1.11.\n\nOn 10 May 2016, the Respondent submitted its Reply to the Claimants' Reply (the \"**Respondent's Rejoinder**\").\n\n1.12.\n\nIn the Respondent's Rejoinder, the Respondent requested that the Tribunal list the present application for an oral hearing, submitting:\n\n\"[Albania] views it as imperative for the fair disposition of this matter that there be an oral hearing.\"1\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, para 16.\n\n1.13.\n\nFurther, the Respondent explained:\n\n\"The matter is complex and the present application is to be made against the background of ongoing developments before the English courts. An oral hearing is therefore the only fair way in which the distorted picture (of facts and law) that the Claimants appear to be so intent on sowing in correspondence can adequately be corrected; and will be the most efficient way of informing the Tribunal of the most up-to-date position.\"2\n\n*Ibid*.\n\n1.14.\n\nOn 13 May 2016, the Tribunal wrote to the Parties informing them that it had determined to hold a short hearing to deal with both the Claimants' Application and Respondent's Application by teleconference.\n\n1.15.\n\nOn 23 May 2016, the Respondent wrote to the Tribunal requesting that the hearing should be held in person (rather than by teleconference) and should be listed for a day. The Respondent cited the following reasons as to why the hearing should be held in person: (i) the importance of the issues at stake; (ii) the scale and complexity of those issues; and (iii) fundamental considerations of procedural fairness. The Respondent explained in detail why an in-person hearing was needed. The Tribunal invited the Claimants to reply, which they did on 26 May 2016. The Claimants rejected the need for an in-person hearing, and submitted that the Respondent's request was \"nothing more than another attempt to further delay compliance with the Tribunal's Order\".3\n\nClaimants' letter of 26 May 2016, para 3.\n\n1.16.\n\nOn 1 June 2016, the Tribunal wrote to the Parties informing them that it would hold an in-person hearing on 15 June 2016 in London. The Tribunal noted that Messrs Glick and Poncet would be present in London, but that the President of the Tribunal would attend via video-link.\n\n1.17.\n\nThe hearing occurred, as anticipated, on 15 June 2016.\n\n1.18.\n\nOn 16 June 2016, the Tribunal wrote to the Parties inviting them to provide brief posthearing submissions on issues that remained outstanding from the hearing.\n\n1.19.\n\nOn 27 June 2016, the Respondent wrote to the Tribunal seeking an extension of a day to submit its post-hearing submissions. That was granted by the Tribunal, and a further day was granted to the Claimants to submit its reply post-hearing submissions.\n\n1.20.\n\nThe Respondent provided its post-hearing submissions on 29 June 2016, and the Claimants responded on 8 July 2016.\n\n1.21.\n\nLater, on the same day (8 July 2016), the Tribunal was provided with the judgment of District Judge Tempia of the Westminster Magistrates' Court deciding not to allow the extradition of Mr Francesco Becchetti and Mr Mauro De Renzis from the United Kingdom (the \"UK\") to Albania (the \"Judgment\").\n\n1.22.\n\nOn 11 July 2016, the Tribunal invited the Parties to submit simultaneous submissions regarding that Judgment by 18 July 2016. The Claimants did so, but the Respondent did not.\n\n1.23.\n\nThe Respondent requested leave to respond to the Claimants' submissions, which the Tribunal granted, but only in respect of responding to the Claimants' letter, not to the Judgment itself.\n\n1.24.\n\nAlso on 18 July 2016, the Claimants wrote to the Tribunal informing it that they had received notification that the Respondent would not appeal the Judgment.\n\n1.25.\n\nOn 22 July 2016, the Respondent submitted a letter which did, in fact, address the Judgment, rather than confining its comments to the Claimants' letter of 18 July 2016. The Tribunal requested an explanation for why the Respondent had filed these comments not only late, but without leave.\n\n1.26.\n\nOn 23 July 2016, the Respondent wrote that it was genuinely confused by what it was and was not granted leave to make submissions on by the Tribunal. The Respondent's counsel stated that it could not file those submissions simultaneously with the Claimants on 18 July because instructions were being sought from Albania.\n\n1.27.\n\nThe Tribunal wrote to the Parties on 24 July 2016 and stated that whilst it did not believe that its instruction to the Respondent was in any way unclear, it had decided to admit the Respondent's letter of 22 July 2016.\n\n1.28.\n\nAt this juncture, it is important for the Tribunal to again emphasise that no submissions are to be filed in this proceeding without the leave of the Tribunal. The example referred to in the preceding paragraphs is not the first occasion that this has occurred. Needless to say, this proceeding is a very complex one, and one that is of critical importance to the Parties. In order to ensure its efficient disposition, it is necessary for there to be appropriate procedural rules put in place, and with which compliance is necessary. No further submissions should be submitted in this proceeding unless they are filed and served pursuant to procedural directions or leave of the Tribunal. Of course, the Tribunal will ensure procedural fairness is granted to all Parties, and any application for leave will be considered on the merits. It is not of any assistance to the Tribunal to receive unsolicited submissions from the Parties.\n\n1.29.\n\nFrom that point, the Tribunal did not accept any further submissions form the Parties, given that both Parties had been given more than ample opportunity to make submissions throughout the course of these two applications.\n\n1.30.\n\n(Further correspondence was exchanged in relation to Interpol red notices, but the content of that correspondence does not impact on the resolution of the two applications the subject of this decision.)\n\n**Summary of Decision**\n-----------------------\n\n1.31.\n\nFor the reasons that follow, the Tribunal has determined that the Tribunal's Order should be revoked, but only on the basis that it is no longer required in its present form. Instead, the Tribunal recommends that the Republic of Albania:\n\n(a) take no steps in the proceedings identified as Criminal Proceeding No. 1564 to recommence extradition proceedings in the UK against Messrs Becchetti and Mr De Renzis until the issuance of a Final Award in this proceeding; and\n\n(b) take all actions necessary to maintain the suspension of the extradition proceedings (Case Numbers 1502751601 (for Mr Becchetti) and 1502752144 (for De Renzis)) currently stayed, and not to take any steps to resume those proceedings, until the issuance of a Final Award in this proceeding.\n\n1.32.\n\nAs is plain from the reasoning in the Tribunal's Order, the principal reason for making the recommendations the subject of paragraph 5.1(a) and 5.1(b) was the potential inability of Messrs Becchetti and De Renzis to fully participate in the arbitration if they were incarcerated. But that principal objective for the Tribunal's recommendations has now been secured. It matters not that it was secured by the Respondent's attempt to adjourn the extradition proceedings *sine die*, or what has now transpired, namely the suspension by order of Judge Tempia. The English courts have stayed the extradition of Messrs Becchetti and De Renzis and that stay should be maintained.\n\n1.33.\n\nIn relation to the preservation of the seized assets, the contents of the various frozen bank accounts and the current shareholdings in those companies (collectively, the \"**Assets**\"), the Tribunal has determined that no further recommendation should be made. It is unnecessary to do so in circumstances where, by the Claimants' Memorial of 13 May 2016 (the \"**Claimants' Memorial**\"), which was filed while the applications the subject of this decision were pending, it has become apparent that the Claimants no longer seek the return of the Assets. While the precise factual situation is somewhat unclear, the Tribunal is not required, nor would it be appropriate, to decide whether the Assets have, in fact been destroyed or expropriated. Ultimately, if the Claimants succeed in this arbitration, the Tribunal is presently of the view that any loss or damage to the Assets can be adequately compensated by an award of damages.\n\n1.34.\n\nFinally, the Tribunal rejects any entitlement of the Claimants for a penalty against the Respondent of US$250,000 or otherwise.\n\n1.35.\n\nThe Tribunal now turns to the Parties' respective submissions.\n\n**PART II: THE PARTIES' SUBMISSIONS**\n-------------------------------------\n\n**The Claimants' Application**\n------------------------------\n\n2.1.\n\nThe Claimants submitted their Application on 25 March 2016.\n\n2.2.\n\nThe Claimants submit that the Respondent has openly defied the authority of the Tribunal by refusing to comply with the Tribunal's Order.4 The Claimants further contend that it is not for the Respondent to decide when, and if, it will comply with the Tribunal's Order and that \"[i]t is indeed beyond dispute that orders of provisional measures issued pursuant to Article 47 of the ICSID Convention create a binding 'legal obligation' on the parties\".5 The Claimants say that the Tribunal's Order is immediately binding, and that the Respondent cannot purport to reserve its rights because it has no rights to reserve. The Claimants further say that Art 47 does not provide for a vehicle for re-consideration of substantive decisions of the Tribunal on provisional measures.6\n\nClaimants' Application, p 1.\n\n*Ibid*, p 2, citing *Tokios Tokeles v Ukraine*, ICSID Case No. ARB/02/18, Order No. 1 (1 July 2003), CL-9, para 4; *City Oriente Limited v Republic of Ecuador and Empresa Estatal Petr\u00f3leos del Ecuador (Petroecuador)*, ICSID Case No. ARB/06/21, Decision on Provisional Measures (19 November 2007), CL-6, paras 52, 92; *Burlington Resources Inc v Republic of Ecuador and Empresa Estatal Petroleos del Ecuador (PetroEcuador)*, ICSID Case No. ARB/08/5, Procedural Order No. 1 on Burlington Oriente's Request for Provisional Measures (29 June 2009), CL-7, para 66.\n\nClaimants' Application, p 2.\n\n2.3.\n\nAs a consequence of the Tribunal's Order, the Claimants also contend that the Respondent must return control of the companies that are subject to sequestration orders made by the Albanian prosecutorial authorities and unfreeze those companies' bank accounts.7 The Claimants say that the Respondent cannot delay this further on the basis that it is \"*currently gathering information in relation to the assets*\", as the Respondent stated in its letter of 21 March 2016.8\n\nLetter from Quinn Emanuel Urqhart & Sullivan to Gowling WLG dated 10 March 2016. Those companies are said by the Claimants to be 400 KV Sh.p.k, Energji Sh.p.k, Fuqi Sh.p.k, Cable System Sh.p.k and Agonset Sh.p.k.\n\nClaimants' Application, p 3.\n\n2.4.\n\nAccordingly, the Claimants request a partial award or an order from the Tribunal addressing the Respondent's refusal to comply with the Tribunal's Order. The Claimants submit that the Tribunal should impose a penalty against the Respondent of US$250,000.00 for each day of non-compliance, and submits that this Tribunal has the power to impose such a penalty.9\n\nThe Claimants relies on *Enron Corporation Ponderosa Assets, LP v Argentine Republic,* ICSID Case No. ARB/01/3, Decision on Jurisdiction (14 January 2004), CL-20, para 79.\n\n2.5.\n\nThe Claimants also request further provisional measures be made by the Tribunal regarding the orders made by the Tribunal at paragraph 5.3 of the Order, whereby the Tribunal invited the Parties to confer and agree as to appropriate steps to be taken by Albania to preserve the Assets. The further provisional measures the Claimants now request are as follows:\n\n(a) \"Return control of the companies that are subject to the June 5, 2015 sequestration order, i.e. 400 KV Sh.p.k, Cable System Sh.p.k., Energji Sh.p.k, Fuqi Sh.p.k., and Agonset Sh.p.k. to their shareholders;\n\n(b) Lift the measures of preservation issued against the assets of these companies;\n\n(c) Unfreeze these companies' bank accounts as well as those of KGE Sh.p.k.; and\n\n(d) Suspend the insolvency proceedings commenced against Energji Sh.p.k.\"10\n\nClaimants' Application, p 4.\n\n2.6.\n\nAt this juncture, it should be noted that the Claimants have requested relief in respect of the company \"Fuqi Sh.p.k\", however this company was never contemplated by the Tribunal's (original) Order.\n\n**The Respondent's Application**\n--------------------------------\n\n2.7.\n\nThe Respondent responded to the Claimants' Application, and submitted its own Application on 5 April 2016.\n\n2.8.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the Tribunal's Order made \"unjustified and disproportionate inroads\" upon Albania's sovereignty.11 The Respondent says that the original relief sought by the Claimants was \"intended to derail\" long-running criminal prosecutions brought against individuals charged with very serious offences, and that against this background any ICSID Tribunal that was invited to interfere had to do so with the \"utmost care\".12 The Respondent says it is appropriate for it to request that the Tribunal reconsider its Order.\n\nRespondent's Application, para 4.\n\n*Ibid*, para 5.\n\n2.9.\n\nThe Respondent says that the Tribunal \"plainly\" has the power under Rule 39(3) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules to revoke or modify its recommendations in its order \"at any time\".13 Further, it says that this power is without restriction.14 The Respondent relies on the dicta of the Tribunal in *Victor Pey Casado v Republic of Chile*, which said of provisional measures:\n\n\"provisional measures... can be modified or cancelled at any time by the Tribunal [and] do not benefit from the force of res judicata\".15\n\n*Ibid*, para 19.\n\n*Ibid.*\n\nICSID Case No ARB/98/2, Decision on Provisional Measures (25 September 2001), CL-12, para 2.\n\n2.10.\n\nThe Respondent does not dispute the test adopted by the Tribunal in determining whether or not an interference with the exercise of a State's sovereign rights is justified. Rather, it takes issue with the Tribunal's application of that test in the circumstances.16\n\nRespondent's Application, paras 24 \u2014 27.\n\n2.11.\n\nThe Respondent contends that the Tribunal did not clearly identify the nature of the right to procedural integrity, nor provide sufficient reasons as to why the incarceration of Messrs Becchetti and De Renzis would infringe that right.17 The Respondent concedes that the right to procedural integrity allows the Tribunal to \"police its own process, so as to ensure the proper functioning of the dispute settlement procedure and the orderly unfolding of the arbitration process\", but the ability of Messrs Becchetti and De Renzis to \"effectively manag[e] their businesses\" (as stated by the Tribunal at paragraph 3.18 of the Order) is \"surely irrelevant\".18\n\n*Ibid*, paras 28, 30.\n\n*Ibid,* paras 32 \u2014 33.\n\n2.12.\n\nIndeed, the Respondent submits that the Tribunal's Order left a number of important questions unanswered, such as which businesses the Tribunal considered would be affected by the potential incarceration of Messrs Becchetti and De Renzis and what role they played in those businesses.19 Similarly, the Respondent submits that the Tribunal's concerns regarding Messrs Becchetti and De Renzis' \"full participation\" in the arbitration were not properly reasoned.20 The Respondent submits that the Tribunal justified its recommendation to suspend the criminal proceedings against Becchetti and De Renzis on the basis that the recommendation only \"merely postpone[d]\" the proceedings, not cancelled them entirely.21 That is, the Tribunal's approach is to countenance \"any ICSID claimant fearing arrest to stop local criminal proceedings... provided he makes sure to ask only for a stay of those proceedings\".22 The Respondent contends that the Tribunal's decision in this respect was \"out of step\" with the \"concept of procedural integrity\" adopted in the cases of *Quiborax*23 and *Lao Holdings.*24\n\n*Ibid*, para 35.\n\n*Ibid,* paras 38 \u2014 39. See, esp, para 39 where the Respondent submits that the \"Tribunal does not explain what full participation' is intended to mean; nor why possible incarceration in Albania 'would' necessarily prevent such 'full participation'; or why a lesser measure was considered inappropriate by the Tribunal\". Other criticisms follow on in paras 40 \u2014 44 of the Respondent's Application.\n\n*Ibid*, para 44.\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n*Quiborax SA, Non Metallic Minerals SA & Allan Fosk Kapl\u00fan v Plurinational State of Bolivia*, ICSID Case No. ARB/06/2, Decision on Provisional Measures (26 February 2010), CL-5; Respondent's Application, para 47.\n\n*Lao Holdings NV v Lao People's Democratic Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB (AF)/12/6, Ruling on Motion to Amend the Provisional Order (30 May 2014), CL-8; Respondent's Application para 47.\n\n2.13.\n\nFurther, the Respondent contends that the Tribunal's Order did not engage with the question of whether it had jurisdiction to \"step-in\" and \"short-circuit\" the investigation which the UK courts were themselves undertaking, namely whether extradition was justified. It followed, so the Respondent contends, that \"this Tribunal must have considered that it (rather than the English court) was the appropriate forum for the deliberation and determination of the issues raised by the Claimants\".25\n\nRespondent's Application, para 50.\n\n2.14.\n\nFurther, the Respondent submits that the duration of the recommendations by the Tribunal is \"excessive and disproportionate\" and there is no reason for the \"restraint imposed by the PMO to last until the Award in this matter\".26\n\n*Ibid*, para 52.\n\n2.15.\n\nNotwithstanding these complaints the Respondent says that it has nevertheless \"actively sought to engage with the Tribunal's recommendations\".27 The Respondent says that its Minister of Justice wrote to the UK's Home Office asking that they make an application to the UK courts that the extradition proceedings against Messrs Becchetti and De Renzis be adjourned *sine die.*28 In this regard, the Respondent said that (at that stage) it fully expected that the adjournment would be granted by the UK courts, and that, accordingly, compliance with paragraph 5.1(b) of the Tribunal's Order would be secured.29 The Respondent says that even if Messrs Becchetti and De Renzis were to appear before an Albanian Court, Albanian prosecutors would not seek to remand them in custody and would not oppose bail on \"reasonable bail conditions\".30 These assurances, according to the Respondent, amount to a \"guarantee\" that Messrs Becchetti and De Renzis would not be jailed.31 This should be sufficient to satisfy the Tribunal's Order, according to the Respondent, because anything more (namely, suspension of the criminal proceeding) was not permitted by Albanian criminal procedure.32\n\n*Ibid*, para 9.\n\n*Ibid*, para 11.\n\n*Ibid*, para 12\n\n*Ibid*, para 13.\n\n*Ibid*, para 15.\n\n*bid*, para 16.\n\n2.16.\n\nAlternatively, in these circumstances, the Respondent contends that it would be open to the Tribunal to find that the steps taken by the Respondent provide a compelling basis for the revocation of the Tribunal's Order. This is because, the Respondent submits, the perceived risk that either Messrs Becchetti or De Renzis would not be able to participate in the arbitration by virtue of their prospective imprisonment disappears,33 and there is no \"separate basis\" on which suspension ought to continue to be recommended by the Tribunal.34\n\n*Ibid*, para 18.\n\n*Ibid*, para 59.\n\n2.17.\n\nAs to the Claimants' Application, the Respondent says that, in respect of the criminal proceedings against Messrs Becchetti and De Renzis, if the Tribunal accepts its arguments regarding the revocation or modification of paragraph 5.1 of the Order, then the Claimants' application for relief in the form of a partial award must (at least partially) fall away.35 Even if the Tribunal is not minded to revoke or modify paragraph 5.1 of its Order, the Respondent says there is no proper basis to grant the Claimants the relief they seek.\n\n*Ibid*, para 64.\n\n2.18.\n\nFirst, the Respondent submits that there is no power for the Tribunal to grant a \"partial\" award under the ICSID Convention or the Arbitration Rules.36\n\n*Ibid*, para 66.\n\n2.19.\n\nSecond, the Respondent says that the Claimants' request for US$250,000.00 per day as a penalty for non-compliance is misconceived. It says that, as a matter of principle, such relief can only be granted when there is loss suffered by the Claimants by virtue of any alleged breach of Art 47 of the ICSID Convention.37 The Respondent says that the Claimants have provided no evidence of loss and in any event the Tribunal could not make such a finding on an \"interim\" basis (that is, without a trial).38 The Respondent submits that the measures it has taken to seek an adjournment of the extradition proceedings *sine die* means that the monetary relief sought is wholly unnecessary.\n\n*Ibid*, para 71.\n\n*Ibid*, para 71.\n\n2.20.\n\nAs for the relief the subject of paragraph 5.2 of the Order, the Respondent submits that it is continuing to engage with the Claimants on seeking to preserve the Assets.39 At that time, it was quite apparent from both Parties' submissions that they disagreed on measures required to be taken by the Respondent under that paragraph of the Order, and that they were thus unable to agree in any substantial respect. Nevertheless, the Respondent submits that the exchanges of correspondence that occurred between the Parties' practitioners between 10 March 2016 to 21 March 2016 show that the Respondent was prepared to engage in good faith in negotiations with the Claimants as to the best way to preserve the Assets.40 As the Tribunal had allowed the Parties 60 days to come to an agreement in this respect, a date which (as at the date of both the Claimants' and the Respondent's Applications), had not yet elapsed, the Claimants' Application was, in this regard, premature.41 Further, the Respondent pointed to the fact that it was continuing to gather information from the Albanian authority in charge of administering the Assets as to whether or not the Claimants' proposals could be met.42\n\n*Ibid*, para 72.\n\n*Ibid*, para 83(a).\n\n*Ibid*, para 85.\n\n*Ibid*, para 87.\n\n**The Claimants' Reply to the Respondent's Application**\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n2.21.\n\nOn 18 April 2016, the Claimants submitted their Reply to the Respondent's Application, and its comments on the Respondent's Response.\n\n2.22.\n\nThe Claimants say that the Respondent's Application should be denied on a summary basis, because it has not met the requirements that such an application must meet to succeed.43\n\nClaimants' Response, p 2.\n\n2.23.\n\nFirst, they say that the Respondent's Application is a challenge of the Tribunal's Order, not a \"*bona fide* request for revocation or modification\".44 The Claimants submit that such a challenge is essentially an appeal against the Tribunal's Order, where there is no right to appeal or re-consideration under the ICSID Convention.45 In this regard, the Claimants rely on various decisions, including the recent decision of an ICSID Tribunal in *ConocoPhillips v Venezuela* on an application for re-consideration.46 The Claimants submit that the power must be \"found to exist\" before it can be exercised, which in this case, it cannot.47 The Claimants submit that Rule 39(3) of the Arbitration Rules does not allow for re-consideration \u2014 it only permits revocation or modification when there are changed circumstances that justify amending the relief originally ordered.48\n\n*Ibid*, p 3.\n\n*Ibid*.\n\n*ConocoPhillips Petrozuata B.V. v Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela,* ICSID Case No ARB/07/30, Decision on the Respondent's Request for Reconsideration (9 February 2016), CL-21.\n\nClaimants' Response, p 4.\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n2.24.\n\nSecond, the Claimants say that the Respondent cannot satisfy the requirement discussed above that there must be \"changed circumstances\".49 The Claimants submit that Albania's request that the extradition proceedings be adjourned *sine die* in the UK courts does not form a \"changed circumstance\". It says that the mere postponement of the extradition proceedings with similar bail conditions in place for Messrs Becchetti and De Renzis would still mean that they would be subject to a curfew and unable to leave the UK.50\n\n*Ibid*, p 5.\n\n*Ibid*, p 6.\n\n2.25.\n\nThe Claimants further say that the Respondent's claim that it is unable to withdraw the extradition (as a matter of Albanian law) is extraordinary, describing it as \"no more than a belated attempt to pay lip service to the Order while continuing to ignore it\".51 The Claimants point to the fact that not once since the Claimants sought orders suspending the Albanian criminal proceedings against Messrs Becchetti and De Renzis did the Respondent indicate that its domestic criminal laws prevented it from doing so, until now.52\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n2.26.\n\nThird, the Claimants say that the promise by the Respondent to impose \"reasonable bail conditions\" on Messrs Becchetti and De Renzis is of no comfort to the Claimants, contending that \"when the Claimants are in Albania the Government can flout the Tribunal's orders, and by the time measures are taken to restrain Albania, the damage to the Claimants' rights will have been done\".53\n\n*Ibid*, p 7.\n\n2.27.\n\nThe Claimants also contend that the Respondent's Application should be denied because it has not explained why revocation or modification of the Tribunal's Order is urgent or necessary. The Respondent relies on a passage by the ICSID tribunal in the *Lao Holdings* where it was stated that a revocation \"has to be based on changed circumstances, which make it urgent and necessary to adopt a new decision on provisional measures\".54 The Claimants instead say that the circumstances show that it is urgent and necessary to keep in place the existing order, because: (i) Albania has indicated that it may reignite the extradition proceedings if the Tribunal's order is revoked; and (ii) the procedural integrity of the arbitration is still affected by the criminal proceedings and the seizure of the Claimants' investments.55\n\n*Lao Holdings N.V. v. Lao People's Democratic Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/12/6, Ruling on Motion to Amend the Provisional Order (30 May 2014), CL-8, para 9.\n\nClaimants' Reply, p 8.\n\n2.28.\n\nFurther, in their Reply, the Claimants press their request for a Partial Award or Order. The Claimants say that the requested relief (which was the subject of the Tribunal's Order) continues to be urgent and necessary (as does the relief sought in its new Application), especially where a number of months have passed since the making of the Tribunal's Order with what the Claimants say has been no attempt by the Respondent to comply.56 The Claimants reject the Respondent's contentions that it cannot withdraw, suspend or stay the criminal proceedings, arrest warrants or extradition requests under Albanian law, and point to different Albanian statutes which would allow such actions to occur on the part of the Respondent.57 Furthermore, the Claimants reiterate that their request for relief in the form of a monetary penalty against the Respondent for non-compliance is proportionate, and only this kind of penalty will \"seemingly compel compliance with this binding Order\".58 The Claimants further reject the Respondent's contention that the Tribunal is unable to render a \"Partial Award\", because there is nothing in the ICSID Convention preventing it.59 Finally, the Claimants say that, if the relief it seeks in its Application with respect to the Assets is granted by the Tribunal, it would provide an undertaking not to sell its shareholding in the relevant companies, to move any physical assets outside of Albania, and they would simply manage the relevant companies \"in the ordinary course of business\".60\n\n*Ibid*.\n\n*Ibid*, p 9.\n\n*Ibid*, p 11.\n\n*Ibid*, p 12.\n\n*Ibid*.\n\n**The Respondent's Rejoinder**\n------------------------------\n\n2.29.\n\nThe Respondent submitted its rejoinder on 10 May 2016. In it, the Respondent reiterates and elaborates on many of the points made in its Application.\n\n2.30.\n\nAt the outset, the Respondent informed the Tribunal that the UK court had refused to adjourn the extradition proceedings of Messrs Becchetti and De Renzis *sine die.*\n\n2.31.\n\nNevertheless, the Respondent submits that, far from the Claimants' assertion that it had ignored the Tribunal's Order, it was the Respondent who was seeking to constructively engage with the Claimants.61 The Respondent submits that it is the Claimants who have ignored the Tribunal's Order by making an \"aggressive, unreasonable and hasty\" application for a Partial Award, more than a month before the expiry of the 60-day period prescribed by the Order for the Parties to discuss the protection of the Assets.62\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, para 11.\n\n*Ibid*.\n\n2.32.\n\nThe primary position taken by the Respondent in its Rejoinder is that there is no need for \"changed circumstances\" (as suggested is required by the Claimant) in order for the Tribunal to exercise its power to revoke or modify the award pursuant to Rule 39(3) of the Arbitration Rules.63 The Respondent submits that \"the Tribunal remains the master of its own process and is able to modify or revoke the PMO in light of further submissions made by the Parties about the reasoning adopted in it or indeed of its own motion\".64 The Respondent says that there is no requirement in the text of Rule 39(3) that there be a change of circumstances;65 the Tribunal's discretion under Rule 39(3) is \"wholly untrammelled\" because of the juridical nature of an order for Provisional Measures, which (in contrast to a Final Award) does not carry the force of *res judicata*.66\n\n*Ibid*, para 19.\n\n*Ibid*.\n\n*Ibid*, para 21.\n\n*Ibid*, para 20.\n\n2.33.\n\nFurther, the Respondent challenges the legal authorities cited by the Claimants in their Response.\n\n2.34.\n\nThe Respondent says that the Claimants' reliance on the *Lao Holdings* case to import the requirement of \"changed circumstances\" is flawed because, in that case, the Tribunal proceeded on the basis of an express concession by the respondent State that it had to establish a change of circumstances in order for the provisional measures order to be modified. That is, put another way, neither party disputed that a change of circumstances was actually required.67\n\n*Ibid*, para 24.\n\n2.35.\n\nThe Respondent also challenges the Claimants' reliance on the *ConocoPhillips* case because that case dealt with a request for re-consideration of a final award, not an order for provisional measures.68 The Respondent submits that there is a clear difference between asking a Tribunal to re-visit a binding and final decision, and a party seeking revocation or modification of an interim order (and the Tribunal must be scrupulous in order not to prejudge the merits of the case itself).69\n\n*Ibid*, para 27 *.* The difference, the Respondent says, between cases such as *ConocoPhillips* and the present is that final awards carried with them the force of *res judicata.*\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, para 28.\n\n2.36.\n\nMoving beyond the question of whether \"changed circumstances\" are required, the Respondent submits that there are nevertheless other \"legal difficulties\" with the Tribunal's reasoning in the Order.\n\n2.37.\n\nFirst, the Respondent submits that it was \"difficult to see how\" the management of Messrs Becchetti and De Renzis' businesses (or, more accurately, the inability to manage those businesses) imperilled the procedural integrity of the arbitration, or, even assuming it did, how such inability could do so in a manner sufficient to make it absolutely necessary to grant provisional measures.70\n\n*Ibid*, para 30(1).\n\n2.38.\n\nSecond, insofar as the Tribunal's reasoning for the Order was based on the justification that incarceration of Messrs Becchetti and De Renzis would prevent them from \"fully participating\" in the arbitration, and imperilling their right to procedural integrity, the Respondent submits that the reasoning was not fully explained in the Order, and therefore cannot be properly justified.71 Specifically, it points to five criticisms:\n\n(a) The Tribunal did not provide an explanation for the concept of \"full participation\" in the arbitration, nor make any findings to suggest that full participation was being imperilled.72\n\n(b) The Tribunal stated that provisional measures must be \"absolutely necessary\" but did not explain why the potential incarceration of Messrs Becchetti and De Renzis made it so.73\n\n(c) The Tribunal's reasoning that the criminal allegations against Messrs Becchetti and De Renzis were not divorced from the Claimants' investments and that the criminal proceedings that relate to the arbitration did not provide a valid justification for the Order.74\n\n(d) The Tribunal's reasoning that the Order was justified because the interference into Albania's sovereign rights is \"temporary\" is not a satisfactory justification where the test of provisional measures needing to be \"absolutely necessary\" is properly to be applied.75\n\n(e) The Order did not explain why it was appropriate to \"cut across\" the extradition proceedings before the UK courts, and before a ruling by that court had been made.76\n\n*Ibid*, para 30(2).\n\n*Ibid*, para 30(2)(a).\n\n*Ibid*, para 30(2)(b).\n\n*Ibid*, para 30(2)(c).\n\n*Ibid*, para 30(2)(d).\n\n*Ibid*, para 30(2)(e).\n\n2.39.\n\nWhile the Claimants stated that Albania cannot \"re-argue\" the arguments ventilated before the Order,77 the Respondent says that it is not seeking to \"re-argue\" them, but rather it \"has made submissions in response to the reasoning adopted by the Tribunal in the PMO, which Albania obviously only saw for the first time once the PMO was issued\".78\n\n*Ibid*, para 31.\n\n*Ibid*.\n\n2.40.\n\nThe Respondent further says that if, contrary to its primary submissions, the Tribunal is not minded to modify or revoke the Order, then any provisional measure should last only until the end of the final hearing, or, at the latest, the date of post-hearing briefs and not until the date of the Final Award.79 This submission is premised on the fact that there is nothing about which Messrs Becchetti and De Renzis need to instruct their counsel after the final hearing. Indeed, the post-hearing submissions do not require their input to analyse legal argument and oral and written evidence has already been submitted.80\n\n*Ibid*, para 37.\n\n*Ibid*.\n\n2.41.\n\nFurther, the Respondent criticises the Order as being \"unprecedented\" in nature, and that it carries with it radical and extraordinary implications.81 For that reason, the Respondent submits that the Tribunal \"ought in principle be ready to reflect upon the validity of its reasoning and conclusions\", and \"it remains incumbent upon the Tribunal to subject its unprecedented recommendations to close and continuing scrutiny\".82\n\n*Ibid*, para 38.\n\n*Ibid*, para 38(1) & (2).\n\n2.42.\n\nThe Respondent says that, if the Tribunal is not minded to review the validity of its Order on the basis of the legal difficulties it presented (and which are summarised above), then the Tribunal should modify or revoke the Order owing to changed circumstances.83\n\n*Ibid*, para 40.\n\n2.43.\n\nThat changed circumstance is the decision of the Westminster Magistrates' Court in the UK where the Home Office's application to adjourn the extradition proceedings involving Messrs Becchetti and De Renzis *sine die* was rejected *.* The Respondent has submitted that it is \"clear that the attitude of the English court is that the only way the English proceedings can be 'suspended' is in fact for them to be entirely withdrawn\".84 In that regard, the Respondent says that the withdrawal of the extradition proceedings is not what the Order required, and Albania had attempted in good faith to comply with the Tribunal's order to \"suspend\" the extradition proceedings by requesting the *sine die* adjournment.85\n\n*Ibid*, para 44.\n\n*Ibid*, paras 54, 57.\n\n2.44.\n\nIn this regard, the Respondent again points to the fact that there is no provision of Albanian law that allows the Minister of Justice to withdraw an extradition request once made, and that, the issuance of arrest warrants gives rise to an obligation on the Albanian authorities to execute that arrest warrant.86 Art 504 of the Albanian Code of Criminal Procedure provides the power for the Albanian Minister of Justice to request the extradition of a person from a foreign state. But the Respondent submits, contrary to what the Claimants said, this does not give the Minister of Justice a discretion to withdraw an extradition request.87 In essence, the Respondent says that, in the absence of something that prevents the extradition proceedings to continue, as a matter of Albanian or international law, then there is no unfettered discretion for the Minister of Justice to simply withdraw the request.88 While the Tribunal's Order does give rise to an obligation on Albania under international law, the Respondent submits the ICSID Convention does not prescribe any mechanism for the Order to be recognised or enforced in Albanian law.89 It follows that the Tribunal's Order cannot affect the validity of the extradition request as a matter of Albanian law, leaving no discretion for the Minister of Justice to withdraw that request.\n\n*Ibid*, para 58.\n\n*Ibid*, para 61(3).\n\n*Ibid*, para 62.\n\n*Ibid*, para 63.\n\n2.45.\n\nIn all of these circumstances, and in what the Respondent explains is an attempt to address the concerns of the Tribunal, Albania offers a guarantee that if Messrs Becchetti and De Renzis were extradited to Albania, then Albanian prosecutors would not seek that they be remanded in custody, but instead be released on \"reasonable bail conditions\".90 This offer had been made by the Albanian Minister of Justice to the UK Home Office.91 The effect would be that, upon arriving in Albania, Messrs Becchetti and De Renzis would spend a maximum of three days in custody before being brought before a court, where the prosecutor would ask the Albanian court to impose bail conditions which would allow Messrs Becchetti and De Renzis to be released from custody.92 The Respondent says that the prosecutor is obliged to follow the guarantee given by the Minister of Justice and \"must ask the Court to replace the existing security measures with the reduced security measures of reasonable bail\".93 It follows that there is no risk that the Albanian court would not release Messrs Becchetti and De Renzis on bail, because Art 244(3) of the Albanian *Code of Criminal Procedure* provides that \"the court cannot assign a remand order more severe than the one applied for by the prosecutor\".94\n\n*Ibid*, para 41(1).\n\nLetter from the Albanian Minister of Justice to the UK Home Office (5 April 2016) (R-0010).\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, para 46.\n\n*Ibid*.\n\n*Ibid*, para 48.\n\n2.46.\n\nIn response to the Claimants' position that the Claimants cannot now rely on the undertaking given by Albania, the Respondent says that when the Claimants originally sought provisional measures, they did not suggest that \"Albania could not be trusted to comply with a tribunal's order or undertaking\". The Respondent asserts that the Claimants have changed their position and that the Tribunal should consider the credibility of the Claimants' avowed concerns about needing to be able to attend to their businesses in Albania. They add that it is now clear that neither Mr Becchetti nor Mr De Renzis intend to travel to Albania to attend to their investments, so the basis for the provisional order, by the Claimants' own admission, falls away.95\n\n*Ibid*.\n\n2.47.\n\nAs to what it had previously described as an \"inability\" to comply with the Tribunal's recommendation to suspend domestic criminal proceedings,96 the Respondent contends that, under Albanian law, criminal proceedings as a whole cannot be suspended.97 It points to Art 342 of the *Code of Criminal Procedure* which provides for uninterrupted criminal trials to be one of the main features for the conduct of criminal trials in Albania.98 While the Respondent concedes that Art 343 of the Code provides for suspension, it only does so when the criminal case is dependent on the resolution of a civil proceeding or administrative dispute.99 To the contrary, there is no dependency between this arbitration and the criminal proceedings against Messrs Becchetti and De Renzis.100 The Respondent further says that any intervention by the Government in court processes is forbidden under the Albanian Constitution, so the Albanian Government, as much as it may wish to comply with the Order, cannot request either the Albanian court, or its prosecutors, to suspend the criminal proceedings.101\n\nIn paragraphs 68 \u2014 81 of its Rejoinder.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, para 69.\n\n*Ibid*.\n\n*Ibid*, para 71.\n\n*Ibid*.\n\n*Ibid*.\n\n2.48.\n\nFinally, the Respondent notes that although the domestic arrest warrants against Messrs Becchetti and De Renzis were not recommended to be withdrawn or suspended by the Tribunal's Order, the Respondent says that it could not do so under Albanian law.102 The Respondent says that, pursuant to Art 260(2) of the *Code of Criminal Procedure*, arrest warrants can only be modified or revoked when \"security needs are lowered\".103 The Respondent submits that \"security needs\" have not lowered because Messrs Becchetti and De Renzis are \"actively evading the justice of the Albania courts\".104\n\n*Ibid*, para 76.\n\n*Ibid*, para 77.\n\n*Ibid*, para 78.\n\n2.49.\n\nIn all of these circumstances, the Respondent says that the \"disappearance of any threat of incarceration\" justifies the revocation of the Tribunal's Order, and the fact that the domestic criminal proceedings have not been suspended does not justify the continuation of the Order. Those criminal proceedings do not pose a threat to the liberty of Messrs Becchetti and De Renzis.105\n\n*Ibid*, para 83.\n\n**The Hearing of 15 June 2016**\n-------------------------------\n\n2.50.\n\nAt the Hearing, the Respondent was invited to make its submissions first, followed by the Claimant. Messrs Toby Landau QC and Siddarth Dhar made submissions on behalf of the Respondent, and Mr Phillipe Pinsolle and Mr Christopher Tahbaz for the Claimants. Messrs Ben Brandon and Julian Knowles QC, respectively counsel for the Respondent and Claimants in the UK extradition proceedings, were also present and assisted the Tribunal on occasion during the hearing.\n\n*The Respondent's oral submissions*\n-----------------------------------\n\n2.51.\n\nThe Respondent submitted that the Claimants had attempted to paint the Respondent's Application as acting in bad faith, and \"seeking to run away\" from the Tribunal's Order, neither of which were true.106 Rather, there was no element of bad faith in asking the Tribunal to exercise a power that it has as a matter of the ICSID Rules.107 The Respondent further submitted that it has in good faith tried to comply with the Tribunal's order.108 The Respondent rejected any notion by the Claimants that the request for an adjournment of the extradition proceedings was for a \"tactical reason\" to prolong the bail conditions of Messrs Becchetti and De Renzis.109 The Respondent further submitted that Albania has not acted in bad faith in failing to suspend the criminal proceedings against Messrs Becchetti and De Renzis in Albania because there have been great efforts to accommodate what the Respondent says is an \"unprecedented\" and \"extraordinary\" order in a domestic legal system.110 The Respondent further pointed out that, while it has tried to accommodate the Tribunal's Order, the continuance, or more accurately, existence, of the criminal proceedings in Albania has posed no difficulty to the Claimants whatsoever (i.e. those proceedings have not stopped them in any way from doing anything in this arbitration).111 The Respondent also pointed to the fact that the Claimants filed an extensive memorial submission on 13 May 2016 as an example of their ability to engage in the arbitral proceeding.112\n\nT6.1-2.\n\nT7.9 - 10.\n\nFor instance, the application to adjourn *sine die* the extradition proceedings, T8.20.\n\nT9.19 - T10.4.\n\nT12.22 - T13.11.\n\nT13.16 - 23.\n\nT13.24 - 25.\n\n2.52.\n\nOn the issue of changed circumstances, the Respondent added a new changed circumstance that would justify (at least in part) the revocation of the Order \u2014 according to the Claimants' Memorial of 13 May 2016, all of the Assets in Albania had been fully expropriated.113 So the Respondent said that, at least in respect of the Order that dealt with the Claimants' businesses, and any concern about running those businesses, that forms a changed circumstance.114\n\nT21.6 - 10.\n\nT21.17 - 20.\n\n2.53.\n\nThe Respondent, at the request of the Tribunal, made submissions regarding the undertaking given by the Albanian Minister for Justice not to seek to remand Messrs Becchetti and De Renzis in custody in Albania, which had been given the UK extradition proceedings. The Respondent confirmed that it was an undertaking given by Albania to the UK, specifically the UK Home Office.115\n\nT26.12 - 16.\n\n2.54.\n\nThe Respondent submitted that if the Tribunal did not agree that it should revoke its Order without changed circumstances, and those changed circumstances concerned an undertaking given by the Albanian Minister for Justice not to incarcerate Messrs Becchetti and De Renzis, then it would be open to the Tribunal to outline what it required to \"have confidence and comfort\" in revoking or modifying the Order.116\n\nT29.23 - T30.9.\n\n2.55.\n\nWhen asked to deal with the difficulty that might arise with the ability for Messrs Becchetti and De Renzis to properly prosecute this arbitration if they were sitting in a jail cell in Albania, counsel for the Respondent submitted that \"the criminal proceedings going ahead in Albania themselves will have no impact on the ability to prosecute this arbitration on any view\".117 Counsel for the Respondent then pointed out that, despite the pendency and even continuation of those criminal proceedings in Albania, the Claimants had managed to file their Memorial of 13 May without difficulty.118 In answer to the proposition that Messrs Becchetti and De Renzis are not currently in jail, and thus it is unsurprising that they have been able to properly prosecute their claims in this arbitration to date,119 counsel submitted that \"the criminal proceedings [in Albania] can continue and the extradition proceedings could be stopped. The two may depend on each other, but they are not both necessary\".120 Counsel for the Respondent further explained that \"the Tribunal could have made an order which was simply focused upon the extradition proceedings, not the criminal proceedings\".121 On that basis, the Respondent submitted that there was \"no justification, in terms of procedural integrity, to stop the domestic criminal proceedings in Albania\",122 and all that was required from the Tribunal was an order suspending the extradition proceedings.123 In relation to the hypothetical scenario that Messrs Becchetti and De Renzis could go to a third state and Albania could then seek extradition from that third state,124 counsel explained that \"the idea that every extradition process around the world can be suspended on this basis, that there can be an incursion of sovereignty of that extent, is totally unprecedented and takes away all the discretions that are built into the system for each country to consider itself how it proceeds\".125\n\nT37.4 - 6.\n\nT37.10 - 24.\n\nT38.5 - 11.\n\nT38.20 - 23.\n\nT39.22 - 24.\n\nT40.16 - 18.\n\nT41.3 - 6.\n\nT41.21 - T41.13.\n\nT42.18 - 24.\n\n2.56.\n\nThe Respondent's position was that the undertaking Albania was prepared to offer was essentially the same undertaking that was made by the Albanian Minister for Justice in the extradition proceedings.126 Having been questioned by the Tribunal on this issue, counsel for the Respondent requested an opportunity to provide further written submissions on this particular issue so as to not misconstrue Albanian law.127\n\nT126.10 - 25.\n\nT124.25 - T125.8.\n\n2.57.\n\nAs to the Claimants' application, the Respondent submitted that the Tribunal should not make the order sought by the Claimants.128 The Respondent submitted that, amongst other things, there was no need to grant the application where Albania has been making good faith attempts to implement the Tribunal's Order.129 The Respondent submitted that the question that had to be asked by the Tribunal when considering whether or not to grant the Claimants' application was \"ha[s Albania] acted in bad faith such that [the Tribunal] should warrant now this extraordinary penal order?\".130 The Respondent submitted that in circumstances where Albania has been \"trying to work with the Tribunal... this is not a situation where it is now appropriate to slap an order or decision on [Albania] to say that [Albania is] in breach, with a day-by-day penalty\".131\n\nFrom T48.17 ff.\n\nT50.8 - 17.\n\nT54.11 - 13.\n\nT54.22 - T55.05.\n\n2.58.\n\nThe Respondent also addressed the Tribunal regarding the orders sought by the Claimants in respect of the Assets. In this regard, the Respondent emphasised that the Tribunal had invited Albania to confer with the Claimants and \"seek to agree appropriate measures to be taken by the Republic of Albania\" to preserve the Assets.132 The Respondent said the relief sought by the Claimants in this respect should be dismissed for three reasons.\n\nTribunal's Order, para 5.2.\n\n2.59.\n\nFirst, the Respondent said that the basis of the Claimants' application, which was that the Respondent had not engaged with the Claimants' proposals to \"preserve\" the Assets, was misconceived.133 The Respondent referred the Tribunal to correspondence between the Parties which it said demonstrated otherwise.134 That correspondence, the Respondent submitted, showed that the Respondent's counsel was still receiving instructions as to how to address the Claimants' \"precise concerns\" regarding the preservation of Assets.135 The Respondent also submitted that the Claimants' application was premature, because the Tribunal's Order prescribed a 60-day time limit in which the Parties were to confer and agree, which had not expired by the time the Claimants' Application was made.136\n\nT57.7 - 11.\n\nT57.12 - 14.\n\nT60.10 - 13.\n\nT57.14 - 21.\n\n2.60.\n\nSecond, the Respondent submitted that Albania had \"done everything necessary to comply\" with the terms of the Tribunal's directions at paragraphs 5.2 and 5.3 of its Order.137 The Respondent submitted that \"there is no allegation that shareholdings have been diluted; there is no allegation that bank accounts have been dissipated; there is no allegation that assets have been left in a warehouse to rot\", and thus, when considering the precise terms of paragraph 5.2 of the Order, it could not be said that Albania has breached that order.138\n\nT58.5 - 7, T58.15 - 16.\n\nT61.16 - 22.\n\n2.61.\n\nThird, the Respondent contended that, even if the Tribunal did not accept that the Respondent had complied with paragraphs 5.2 and 5.3 of its Order, then the Claimants have stated in their recently-filed Memorial that those Assets no longer exist,139 so there could be no urgency supporting the grant of provisional measures to protect them.\n\nT59.12 - 15.\n\n*The Claimants' oral submissions*\n---------------------------------\n\n2.62.\n\nThe Claimants submitted that the Respondent's characterisation of the issue before the Tribunal as being a question of whether or not the Respondent had acted in bad faith or good faith was not relevant, and that the question of good faith was not the test to be applied by the Tribunal.140 Rather, what is required to be examined is compliance with the Tribunal's Order, which is what the Claimants submitted their Application was predicated upon.141\n\nT65.21 - T66.1.\n\n*Ibid*.\n\n2.63.\n\nThe Claimants submitted during their opening that they were now seeking an indemnification for the Assets, some of which had now been expropriated and could not be returned.142 When asked to clarify their position regarding the relief sought, the Claimants confirmed that they were seeking full compensation in the merits aspect of this arbitration, but also a penalty against the Respondent for non-compliance with the Tribunal's Order.143 The Claimants confirmed that the penalty and the award of damages it sought would be \"in parallel\", so that the penalty would be deducted from the calculation of damages (presumably, so as not to receive double compensation, or a pecuniary penalty, as the case may be).144\n\nT66.11 - 12.\n\nSee the exchange at T67.5 - 20.\n\nT67.21 - 23.\n\n2.64.\n\nThe Claimants also addressed the Tribunal on the Respondent's compliance with the suspension of the extradition proceedings. The Claimants submitted that UK Magistrates' Court had not been inclined to grant the Home Office's application to adjourn *sine die* because it did not wish to leave the matter \"in limbo\".145 As at the stage of the oral hearing, the Parties informed the Tribunal that the judgment of Judge Tempia as to the extradition application of Messrs Becchetti and De Renzis was expected to be delivered on 8 July 2016.\n\nT72.16 - 21.\n\n2.65.\n\nCounsel for the Claimants also made submissions regarding two documents relating to the conditions of Albanian prisons that were submitted to the Tribunal, without leave, on 10 June 2016.146 The Tribunal decided against admitting these documents and, as such, it is unnecessary to dwell on these submissions further.\n\nThose submissions appear at T78.6 - T80.23.\n\n2.66.\n\nThe Claimants addressed the Respondent's contention that there was no mechanism under Albanian law by which to suspend the Albanian criminal proceedings, contending that in the extradition proceedings before Judge Tempia, the Claimants had tendered an expert report of an expert in Albanian law which demonstrated that the Albanian Minister for Justice *does* have a discretion to suspend an extradition request.147 The Tribunal noted that whilst that report was not in evidence in this arbitration, the question of whether or not the Albanian minister can suspend the extradition request was likely to be a question answered by Judge Tempia.148 Mr Brandon, Albania's counsel in the extradition proceedings, agreed that those were the questions that Judge Tempia would decide, but said that they would not necessarily be decided on 8 July 2016, when judgment from that court was expected.149\n\nT81.13 - 24.\n\nT83.2 - 11.\n\nT83.14 - 20.\n\n2.67.\n\nThe Claimants also made submissions regarding the difficulties they perceived in relation to the undertaking given by the Albanian Minister of Justice to the Home Office (and presumably, any similar undertaking to the Tribunal) not to imprison Messrs Becchetti and De Renzis. In this regard, the Claimants emphasised paragraphs 46 to 48 of the Respondent's Rejoinder, and specifically on the word \"ask\" (i.e. that the Albanian authorities would *ask* the Albanian courts not to imprison Messrs Becchetti and De Renzis).150 The Claimants further submitted that \"reasonable bail conditions\" quoted in the Albanian Minister's undertaking was an \"abstract concept\", and that it is not known what an Albanian court might regard as \"reasonable bail conditions\".151 When pressed by the Tribunal as to whether or not the Claimants would ever accept any undertaking given by the Respondent as acceptable, the Claimants submitted that it would not \"rule out this possibility\".152\n\nT85.7 - 17.\n\nT88.5 - 9.\n\nT91.9 - 12.\n\n2.68.\n\nThe Claimants then turned to the Respondent's Application more generally. They contended that it was nothing more than an interlocutory appeal.153 An appeal of this nature is not authorised under the ICSID Convention, nor the Arbitration Rules.154 The Claimants pointed out that \"Albania had a full and fair opportunity to participate [in the hearing on provisional measures], where there were hundreds of pages of written submissions, where Albania was represented by its choice of counsel, during a hearing to which it agreed\".155 The Claimants submitted that Albania's dissatisfaction with the Tribunal's reasoning was not a basis to \"re-open issues that this Tribunal has fully considered and decided\".156\n\nT93.3 - 7.\n\nT93.14 - 16.\n\nT94.3 - 7.\n\nT95.20 - 22.\n\n2.69.\n\nThe Claimants conceded that the ICSID Convention and the Rules are each silent as to the circumstances under which an application for revocation or modification can be made, but submitted that, contrary to the Respondent's submission that it is incumbent upon the Tribunal to subject its Order to continuing scrutiny, there must be changed circumstances in order to allow a consideration of revocation or modification.157\n\nT96.2 - 7, T97.3 - 5, T98.21 - T99.3.\n\n2.70.\n\nAccepting that changed circumstances are required to allow revocation or modification of the Tribunal's Order, the Claimants contended that there were no changed circumstances in this case, nor was it necessary or urgent to modify or revoke the Order.158 The Claimants submitted that the dual requirement (namely that there be *both* changed circumstances, and that it be urgent and necessary to revoke) was derived from the *Lao Holdings* case.159 Without the requirement of changed circumstances (that is, \"an objective justification\"), the Claimants submitted that one would be left with a system of unlimited appeal.160\n\nT100.22 - T101.2.\n\nT101.3 - 12.\n\nT103.7 - 10.\n\n2.71.\n\nThe Claimants further contended that Albania's assurances of compliance, and in particular, its claim that it had complied with the Tribunal's Order regarding the suspension of the extradition proceedings (or at least, attempted suspending), did not constitute changed circumstances.161\n\nT105.23, T106.9 - 18.\n\n2.72.\n\nThe Claimants also focused the Tribunal's attention to the question of why Albania did not raise its inability to suspend the extradition or criminal proceedings during the earlier Provisional Measures hearing, when it knew it could be faced with such an order.162 The Claimants submitted that the inference that can be drawn from this is that there is no merit to the argument that Albania is unable to comply with the Order.163\n\nT107.1 - 21.\n\nT107.21 - 24.\n\n2.73.\n\nFinally, the Claimants focused on Albania's undertaking not to seek that Messrs Becchetti and De Renzis be remanded in custody if they were to be extradited. The Claimants submitted that the Respondent was not being \"genuine and honest\" in giving this undertaking, because, on the one hand, it had stated that it was committed not to imprison Messrs Becchetti and De Renzis, but, on the other hand, it is \"fighting tooth and nail to get rid of\" the Order.164\n\nT109.2 - 9.\n\n2.74.\n\nAfter the hearing, the Parties were each directed to file post-hearing submissions, to which the Tribunal now turns.\n\n**The Respondent's Post-Hearing Submission of 29 June 2016**\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n2.75.\n\nThe Respondent submitted its Post Hearing Submission on 29 June 2016, accompanied by (i) correspondence between the Albanian Attorney-General's Office and Albanian Prosecutors; and (ii) an Opinion on Matters of Albanian Law dated 22 July 2016 written by Professor Arben Rakipi, a Professor of Criminal Law at the Tirana Magistrates' School. The admission of those documents into the record was objected to by the Claimants in their Post-Hearing Submission of 8 July 2016.\n\n2.76.\n\nIn light of this dispute, the Tribunal had to determine whether to admit this opinion. It determined to do so. The Tribunal turns to consider Professor Rakipi's opinion (and that of the Claimants' expert as to Albanian law) at paragraphs 2.95-2,101 below.\n\n2.77.\n\nThe Respondent then makes submissions on the three relevant questions, namely:\n\n(a) who was to give the undertakings that Messrs Becchetti and De Renzis not be incarcerated and that they be released on bail, and in what form they were to be made to the Tribunal;\n\n(b) how any such undertakings would be made; and\n\n(c) how, once made, the undertakings would be implemented in Albania.165\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Submission, para 2(a) - (c).\n\n2.78.\n\nThe Respondent describes the undertakings as \"promises\", rather than undertakings, explaining that, as a matter of Albanian legal language, it was appropriate to do so.166 In fact, the terms \"undertakings\" and \"promises\" seemed to be used interchangeably in both Parties' submissions, and the Tribunal herein adopts the language used by the Parties depending on the particular submission or point made.\n\n*Ibid*, footnote 1.\n\n*The \"promises\" made*\n---------------------\n\n2.79.\n\nThe Respondent relies on promises that have already been made in the form of the 5 April 2016 letter from the Minister of Justice to the Home Office167 and a letter from the Albanian Prosecution Office dated 14 June 2016.168 Further, it relies on the letter from the Prosecutor General's Office dated 29 June 2016,169 which it submits confirms that (i) the Prosecutor and Albanian Court are obliged to comply with the \"promise\" made by the Albanian Minister of Justice; (ii) Messrs Becchetti and De Renzis would be held in custody for a maximum of three days from their arrival in Albania before they are brought before an Albanian court for \"processing\"; (iii) Messrs Becchetti and De Renzis will thereafter be released on \"reasonable bail conditions\"; and (iv), once they have appeared before the Albanian court, their arrest warrants will be satisfied.170\n\nR-0010.\n\nR-0020.\n\nR-0020.\n\nRespondent's Post Hearing Submission, para 6 (a) - (d).\n\n*How the \"promises\" are to be implemented in Albania*\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n2.80.\n\nThe Respondent refers to letters from the State Advocate's Office that confirm, amongst other things, that the Minister for Justice abides by the undertakings made in the 5 April 2016 letter to the Home Office, which are \"legitimated by implementation of Article 504/2 of the Code of Criminal Procedure\".171 The Respondent further submits that as a matter of international law, those promises remain binding on Albania because:\n\n(a) the letter is signed by the Minister of Justice himself, and he is the authorised representative of the Republic of Albania; and\n\n(b) the letter by the Minister plainly evinces an intention to be bound by its terms.172\n\n*Ibid*, paras 10 - 12.\n\n*Ibid*, para 13(a)-(b).\n\n2.81.\n\nThe Respondent points to the decision of the International Court of Justice in the *Nuclear Tests Case*, whereby the Court stated:\n\n\"When it is the intention of the State making the declaration that it should become bound according to its terms, that intention confers on the declaration the character of a legal undertaking.....\"173\n\n*Australia v France*, Judgment dated 20 December 1974, I.C.J. Reports 1974, CL-029, p 267.\n\n2.82.\n\nThe Respondent concedes that its previous reliance on Art 504(2) of the Albanian *Criminal Procedural Code* to suggest that the Minister for Justice's promise in the letter to the Home Office was binding is now \"a matter of some uncertainty under Albanian law\".174 However the Respondent relies on the opinion of Professor Rakipi, its Albanian law expert, that \"the Minister is bound where he has made promises as to how the Defendants will be treated if extradited\" despite the situation not being \"expressly envisaged in the law\".175\n\nRespondent's Post Hearing Submission, para 16.\n\n*Ibid*, para 17.\n\n2.83.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the Minister for Justice considers himself bound by the promises made in the extradition proceedings, but could make those same promises or undertakings to the Tribunal because they do not relate to the \"framework of the extradition proceedings\" and Albanian law does not provide for any valid undertakings to be made outside the extradition proceedings.176\n\n*Ibid*, para 18.\n\n2.84.\n\nAs a reason why this Tribunal should be satisfied that the Minister will keep his word, the Respondent submits that by not doing so would have \"very severe repercussions\" for Albania in these proceedings, and also for its bilateral relationship with the UK.177\n\n*Ibid*, para 19.\n\n2.85.\n\nTurning to how the \"promises\" made by the Minister of Justice are binding on Albanian prosecutors and courts, the Respondent relies on Art 51(2) of Law 10193178 and Art 504(2) of the *Code of Criminal Procedure*,179 which, in combination, mean that the Minister's confirmation or acceptance of the promises previously made to the Home Office is binding upon both prosecutors and courts.180\n\nWhich essentially provides that Albanian domestic courts are obliged to respect conditions previously promised in an extradition.\n\nWhich provides that the Minister of Justice is competent to decide upon the conditions imposed by the \"foreign country to provide extradition\", when they do not run against principles of Albanian law.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Submission, para 27. The Respondent also relies on the Opinion of Professor Rakipi in this respect.\n\n**The Claimants' Post-Hearing Submission of 8 July 2016**\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n2.86.\n\nOn 8 July 2016, the Claimants submitted their response to the Respondent's Post Hearing Submission (the \"**Claimants' Post-Hearing Submission**\"). This was submitted on the same day that the Judgment was handed down. The Claimants' Post-Hearing Submission was accompanied by an opinion by Mr Arben Qeleshi which largely addressed the opinion of Professor Arben Rakipi. That, too, was admitted into evidence. The Tribunal separately summarises Mr Qeleshi's opinion (together with Professor Rakipi's opinion) at paragraphs 2.95 - 2,101 below.\n\n2.87.\n\nThe Claimants emphasise that the Respondent would not (or could not, as the case may be) give an undertaking to this Tribunal directly and instead rely on the previous undertaking given by the Minister of Justice.181 The Claimants point out the Respondent admits that Art 504(2) of the *Code of Criminal Procedure* would not apply to the undertakings given by the Minister, because that part of the Code only applies \"where an undertaking has been given at the request of a foreign State as a condition for extradition\".182 The Claimants explain that, under Art 504(2), an undertaking could only be given by the Minister if requested by the UK authorities, and, as no such request was made, an \"undertaking\" was not given (at least for the purposes of Art 504(2)).183 The Claimants say that this is significant because \"Albania has been forced to concede yet again that its prior statements with respect to Albanian law are simply untrue\".184\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Submission, p 2.\n\n*Ibid*, p 3 - the Claimants quote the transcript at T86.01 - T87.25.\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Submission, p 4.\n\n*Ibid*.\n\n2.88.\n\nThe Claimants submit that the \"promises\" given by Albania to the UK authorities (given that they cannot be characterised as undertakings and are not described by the Respondent as such) do not bind Albania, Albanian courts, or Albanian prosecutors.185 The Claimants reject the claim that the promises are binding as a matter of international law, because \"Albania's Minister of Justice evinces no intention to be bound by his April 5 letter\".186 The Claimants also point to the apparent contradiction between the Respondent maintaining that the promises have a binding effect under Albanian law (by virtue of their binding nature under international law), but that the Tribunal's Order does not enjoy a similar binding effect under Albanian law.187\n\n*Ibid*.\n\n*Ibid*, p 5.\n\n*Ibid*.\n\n2.89.\n\nThe Claimants submit that the Respondent's promises do not bind the Albanian courts and its prosecutors.188 The Claimants point to two matters in support. First, they say that (as the Minister has admitted) Art 504(2) does not provide a legal basis for the binding nature of the undertaking under Albanian law. Second, the Claimants say that Albania's reliance on Law 10193189 is equally flawed. In this regard, the Claimants rely on the opinion of Mr Qeleshi (which is summarised below), specifically because neither Law 10193 nor Art 504(2) of the *Code on Criminal Procedure* provide a basis for the \"promises\" to be binding under Albanian law.190\n\n*Ibid*, p 6.\n\nReferred to above in para 2.85.\n\nClaimants' Post Hearing Submission, p 6.\n\n2.90.\n\nThe Claimants further submit that the promises made by the Albanian Minister are not binding before the English courts. The Claimants submit that the issue of bail in Albania (and, presumably, any promises made regarding bail) is irrelevant to the extradition process in the UK.191 The Claimants submit that under the *Extradition Act 2003* (UK), the presiding judge must send an application for extradition to the UK Secretary of State, who is obliged to order extradition unless certain narrow circumstances exist (none of which are applicable in this case).192 The Claimants contend that neither the Judge nor the Secretary of State will be concerned with the question of bail in Albania after Messrs Becchetti and De Renzis are extradited.193\n\n*Ibid*, p 7.\n\n*Ibid*.\n\n*Ibid*, p 8.\n\n2.91.\n\nThe Claimants also contend that Albania's promise that Messrs Becchetti and De Renzis will be allowed to travel freely to and from Albania once they are released on bail is illusory. The Claimants draw the Tribunal's attention to the fact that the guarantee of free travel to and from Albania is not covered by any promise or undertaking by the Albanian Minister of Justice - rather, it was only made by way of submission in the Respondent's submission of 10 May 2016, and the Respondent does not explain why this representation is binding.194 Further, the Claimants contend that Albania does not explain how it would withdraw international arrest warrants and an Interpol \"Red Notice\" against Messrs Becchetti and De Renzis.195 The Claimants pose the question why Albania would continue to seek the extradition of Messrs Becchetti and De Renzis only to release them again, and says that such a position \"flies in the face of the very purposes of extradition, which is to force a defendant to return to a State in which he is to be tried in order to stand trial\".196 The Claimants contend that even if Messrs Becchetti and De Renzis were granted bail, they would be obliged to appear in Albania at \"Albania's volition\", due to the operation of Art 353 of the *Code of Criminal Procedure*.197\n\n*Ibid*, p 9.\n\n*Ibid*, a \"Red Notice\" is described on the Interpol website as follows: *\"In the case of Red Notices, the persons concerned are wanted by national jurisdictions for prosecution or to serve a sentence based on an arrest warrant or court decision. INTERPOL's role is to assist the national police forces in identifying and locating these persons with a view to their arrest and extradition or similar lawful action.\"* See www.interpol.int/INTERPOL-expertise/Notices.\n\n*Ibid*.\n\n*Ibid*, p 10.\n\n2.92.\n\nThe Claimants also press the argument that the Respondent has failed to address any of the Tribunal's queries contained in its letter of 16 June 2016 following the oral hearing in this matter. In particular, the Claimants stress that the Respondent has given no undertaking to the Tribunal (especially given that the Tribunal's letter of 16 June 2016 specifically asked: \"who will make the undertaking(s) and in what form will it be made to the Tribunal\").198 The Claimants say that the reasons proffered by the Respondent as to why it cannot make the undertakings directly to the Tribunal are flawed. First, the Claimants say that given the Respondent has effectively admitted that the undertaking made by the Minister to the Home Office in his letter of 5 April 2016 was not made pursuant to Art 504(2) of the *Code on Criminal Procedure*, then it could not bear a relationship to the extradition proceedings.199 The Claimants ask: given that those undertakings bear no \"legal\" relationship to the extradition proceedings, why can the Minister of Justice make the undertakings to the Westminster Magistrates' Court, but not the Tribunal?200 Second, the Claimants submit that, if the Minister of Justice cannot provide the undertakings to the Tribunal (as the Respondent claims the Minister cannot), then why are Albanian officials other than the Minister of Justice unable to make such an undertaking?201\n\n*Ibid*.\n\n*Ibid*, p. 11.\n\n*Ibid*.\n\n*Ibid*.\n\n2.93.\n\nThe Claimants also point out that the \"reasonable bail conditions\" promised by the Respondent have not been fully explained to them and remain an \"abstract concept\".202 The Claimants say that the Tribunal should draw \"the necessary conclusions\" \u2014 namely, an adverse inference \u2014 from Albania's silence on this point.203\n\n*Ibid*.\n\n*Ibid*, p 12.\n\n2.94.\n\nFinally, the Claimants contend that Albania has not adequately addressed how the promises made by the Minister to the Home Office would be implemented. The Claimants attack the Respondent's submission that the promise would be binding on it as a matter of international law because such a contention is \"disingenuous in light of Albania's position that the Tribunal's Order on Provisional Measures is binding upon it, but that it nevertheless cannot be implemented under its own law\".204 Specifically, the Claimants submit that the Respondent fails to explain why the Minister's promises must be implemented immediately by its governmental organs, but not the Tribunal's Order.\n\n*Ibid*.\n\n**The Opinions of Professor Arben Rakipi and Mr Arben Qeleshi**\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\n2.95.\n\nAs already noted, Professor Arben Rakipi has been put forward as an expert on Albanian law by the Respondent, while Mr Arben Qeleshi has been put forward by the Claimants.\n\n2.96.\n\nProfessor Rakipi is a Professor of Criminal Law at the Tirana Magistrates School, and was a former Judge of different courts in Albania. His opinion was sought by counsel for the Respondent for the purposes of this arbitration. His report is structured in such a way as to address various questions posed of him by counsel from the Respondent.\n\n2.97.\n\nMr Qeleshi's experience includes, but is not limited to, working as a Prosecutor for the Attorney General's office, and serving as a Magistrate for seven years. Mr Qeleshi was asked to address the same questions put to Professor Rakipi, and also to address the answers provided by Professor Rakipi.\n\n2.98.\n\n*Question 1:* Professor Rakipi was asked whether or not the Minister for Justice would be obliged to comply with an undertaking given by him to the English extradition courts *if* the extradition court did not impose on Albania those conditions given in the undertaking.205\n\n(a) Professor Rakipi states that the present situation is not envisaged by Albanian law, but that the provisions of \"articles 42, 51, 52 etc.\", presumably of Law 10193, apply as to \"order the procedural authority to respect the undertaking\".206\n\n(b) Professor Rakipi also made reference to Albania's \"international obligations\". \"due to its membership of the Council of Europe Extradition Convention\" (which the Tribunal takes to mean the European Convention on Extradition), and states:\n\n\"In this case we apply the constitutional concept of the direct application of international agreements, which take precedence over national laws (Article 122 of the Constitution). Our present case should also be assessed in this spirit. I think that in the event that the Minister of Justice has issued an undertaking, regardless of its form and content, he should adhere to it\".\n\n[\u2026]\n\nConsequently, the exercise of competence in meeting international obligations on his part, has been done at this point, and any revocation or withdrawal from the undertaking issued cannot be understood, nor can it be permitted, I would say. From this viewpoint, the Minister has fulfilled his will and the internal court authority must proceed according to this express will\".207\n\n(c) Mr Qeleshi, on the other hand, says that if a person is to be extradited to Albania, but the foreign extraditing court does not impose any conditions or undertakings to be respected by Albania, there shall be no obligation on the part of the Albanian court to abide by any undertakings made.208 Mr Qeleshi rejects the contention that the situation of Messrs Becchetti and De Renzis' extradition is not envisaged by Albanian law, instead concluding that Art 504(2) of the *Code on Criminal Procedure* is applicable, and should be understood as follows:\n\n\"First, in the case of extradition from abroad, the only authority competent to impose conditions or undertakings/guarantees is the foreign extradition court (in this case the English Court).\n\n[...]\n\nSecondly, pursuant to Article 504 paragraph 2 of the Criminal Procedure Code, the foreign court has discretion whether to set/place or not conditions or undertakings on the extradition of the wanted person [\u2026] This provision uses the term 'eventually' to underline that the foreign court could have imposed conditions or undertakings when it accepted the extradition, but it could also have not imposed any conditions or undertakings.\n\nThirdly, when the foreign court which has ordered the extradition has set conditions in its decision, these conditions are not automatically binding on the Albanian state. T his is because, the Minister of Justice shall have the power to decide if it accepts, or not, the conditions imposed after verifying that those conditions are not contrary to the main principles of the Albanian rule of law\".209\n\n(d) Mr Qeleshi also opines that, according to Albanian law, the Minister of Justice's acceptance or denial of extradition conditions will be given after, not before, the foreign court's decision on extradition. The consequence is that if the Minister of Justice provides an undertaking before extradition is allowed by the foreign court, the undertaking does not legally bind the Minister of Justice to comply with it.210\n\nProfessor Rakipi's Opinion, p 1.\n\n*Ibid*.\n\n*Ibid*, p 2.\n\nMr Qeleshi's Opinion, p 1\n\n*Ibid*, p 2 (emphasis added).\n\n*Ibid*.\n\n2.99.\n\n*Question 2:* Professor Rakipi is asked whether the undertaking given by the Minister is binding on an Albanian Court as the *\"proceeding authority\"* under Art 504 of the *Code on Criminal Procedure*.\n\n(a) Professor Rakipi states that the \"undertaking by the Minister of Justice is issued for procedural documents and actions, which means that it is binding on any institution that takes part in a procedural instance or situation\" and for this reason \"the court and prosecution service are to be understood as the procedural authority without distinction\".211 Professor Rakipi bases the answer to this question on Arts 42 and 51 of Law 10193, which he reproduces in his opinion.212\n\n(b) Mr Qeleshi stated in response that the Minister of Justice had discretionary power over extraditions and \"even if he has made the request for extradition, he may withdraw this request [later]\".213 This assumes importance given the Respondent's submissions about the inability under Albanian law to suspend extradition proceedings. Mr Qeleshi also attacks Professor Rakipi's reliance on Law 10193, and states \"such reference is pointless and furthermore it is not related to the question on the binding power on the Albanian court of the Minister's undertaking\". He opines that Art 42 regulates the extradition of a person from Albania to a foreign country, not the other way around, as is the case here.214 Further he states that the reference to Art 52 is similarly irrelevant, because it governs when an undertaking is given to allow a person up for extradition a right of review of a final decision (i.e. a conviction), where that decision was rendered in absentia.215 That is obviously not the case here.\n\nProfessor Rakipi's Opinion, p 2.\n\n*Ibid,* page 2 \u2014 3.\n\nMr Qeleshi's opinion, page 3.\n\n*Ibid*.\n\n*Ibid*, p 4.\n\n2.100.\n\n*Questions 3 & 4:* Professor Rakipi is asked whether an undertaking given by the Minister of Justice is binding on an Albanian Court as a matter of practice in Albanian criminal procedure. Professor Rakipi is separately asked to confirm the authority for his answers.\n\n(a) He opines in the affirmative, saying that it is binding, and pointing to Art 52 of Law 10193 and also a decision of the Constitutional Court of Albania.216 It is clear that both the legislative provisions and the case cited by Professor Rakipi relate to persons convicted *in absentia*, but he concludes by stating \"I confirm that the Albanian procedural authority has respected the undertakings given by the Minister of Justice\".217 Further, he opines:\n\n\"... the state of proceedings relating to the effect of the undertakings given by the Minister of Justice in the case of extradition requests, has always been resolved in compliance with the undertaking given to review criminal decisions issued in the absence of the convicted persons.\"218\n\n(b) Mr Qeleshi responds by conceding that it is generally true as a matter of practice that Albanian courts respect decisions of the Minister, but he emphasises that that is only the case where final sentences have been rendered in absentia. Mr Qeleshi opines that \"Article 51 of Law no. 10193 has not been applied to decisions issuing personal security measures\".219\n\n*Ibid*, 4, Decision No 21, *Florian Mece,* Constitutional Court of the Republic of Albania (29 April 2010).\n\nProfessor Rakipi's Opinion, p 4.\n\n*Ibid*.\n\nMr Qeleshi's Opinion, p 4.\n\n2.101.\n\n*Conclusions'.* It is of assistance to set out both Professor Rakipi and Mr Qeleshi's conclusions out in full:\n\n(a) Professor Rakipi stated.\n\n\"In conclusion, it is worth my re-emphasising that the content of the decisions in question, and our practice in this field \u2014 the field of extradition \u2014 is well worked out only in cases where the persons whose extradition is sought have been sentenced *in absentia*. The above decisions refer generally to the right of persons to have a second trial, an appeal or a review of decisions handed down in their absence. The undertakings which the Albanian Ministers of Justice have given for such persons also rest upon this basis. Our case is special. But, in the spirit of the content of the law, I think that the effect of the undertaking should be the same for each legal situation. The recognition of the authority of the Minister to issue the relevant undertakings remains because of international agreements, multilateral acts to which Albania is party. Owing to their effect, international acts are applied directly. This is the heart of the matter\".220\n\n(b) Mr Qeleshi, on the other hand, explains.\n\n\"In conclusion, the Rakipi Memo fails to provide any legal basis for the binding effect upon Albanian courts of the Minister's undertaking in this case.\n\nThis is because, as we explained.\n\n1. Article 42 of Law no. 10193 governs cases of extradition from Albania to a foreign State and is thus not relevant to the relevant undertaking of the Minister (i.e. not to imprison the defendants on return to Albania for longer than 3 days in an Article 3 compliant prison.).\n\n2. Pursuant to article 51, paragraph 4 of Law no. 10193, [guarantees] can be given by the Minister and that can have binding effect on Albanian courts. only when an undertaking has been given providing for the right of a review of final sentence on the merit rendered in absentia.\n\nTherefore, based on the above-mentioned provisions, the Minister of Justice has no authority to compel the court regarding the undertaking he has made in this case. This is also confirmed by judicial practice itself, as professor Rakipi himself accepts in his opinion: judicial practice only relates to the binding effect of the Minister's undertaking for a review of final decisions on the merits of the cases conducted in the absence of the convicted/trialled persons.\"221\n\nProfessor Rapiki's Opinion, p 5.\n\nMr Qeleshi's Opinion, p 5.\n\n**PART III: FURTHER DEVELOPMENTS IN THE UNITED KINGDOM**\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n**The Judgment of District Judge Tempia**\n-----------------------------------------\n\n3.1.\n\nOn 8 July 2016, District Judge Tempia of the Westminster Magistrates Court handed down the judgment in *Government of Albania v Francesco Becchetti and Mauro De Renzis*. Judge Tempia's judgment makes reference to the Tribunal's Order and sets out the procedural history of the extradition proceedings before the English courts.222 It is apparent from the recitation of these matters that the Judge was presented with lengthy and detailed oral and written submissions from both sides.\n\nJudgment, paras 3 \u2014 6.\n\n3.2.\n\nIn her judgment, Judge Tempia summarised the evidence that was before her. In particular, she had the benefit of a copy of the Tribunal's Order, as well as various documents from this arbitration, and a memorandum entitled \"Reasons Why Albania Cannot Withdraw UK Extradition Proceedings\" produced by Albania (the \"**Reasons Document**\").223 The Reasons Document explained why Albania could not comply with the Tribunal's Order by suspending the extradition and criminal proceedings, for broadly the same reasons proffered to this Tribunal.224 The Judge noted in her judgment that it was unclear who authored the Reasons Document.\n\n*Ibid*.\n\n*Ibid*, para 13.\n\n3.3.\n\nFurther, Judge Tempia had before her an opinion from Mr Becchetti's Albanian counsel, who opined that Albania could suspend the criminal and extradition proceedings against Messrs Becchetti and De Renzis. She also had before her an opinion from Mr Qeleshi, albeit a different one to which is presently before the Tribunal.225 That said, Mr Qeleshi's opinion given in the extradition proceedings seems, from the Judge's summary, to be largely identical with that given to this Tribunal.226\n\n*Ibid*, para 9.\n\n*Ibid*, para 14.\n\n3.4.\n\nHaving summarised the submissions of the parties to that proceeding, Judge Tempia began her reasons by declaring that she found the Tribunal's Order to be one that was validly issued and which is accepted by Albania as binding upon it.227 The Judge characterised the Reasons Document as the evidence that was relied on by Albania to substantiate their position as to why the arrest warrants and extradition proceedings could not be withdrawn.228 The Judge did not draw an adverse inference from the fact that the Reasons Document did not state its author, accepting that it was a document from the Albanian Ministry of Justice.229\n\n*Ibid*, para 43.\n\n*Ibid*, para 44.\n\n*Ibid*.\n\n3.5.\n\nIn dealing with the Reasons Document, however, Judge Tempia preferred the evidence of Mr Qeleshi on these matters. Having noted his impressive background,230 the Judge accepted Mr Qeleshi's evidence in its entirety. She noted that his report had set out why he was of the opinion that the Reasons Document was incorrect and misleading \"in every aspect of law and interpretation\" and noted that \"its contents have not been either challenged or addressed by the Government\".231\n\n*Ibid*, para 46.\n\n*Ibid*.\n\n3.6.\n\nJudge Tempia also accepted the submission of Mr Knowles QC (for Messrs Becchetti and De Renzis) that the Tribunal's Order was binding on the extradition court and the extradition proceedings should be suspended.232\n\n*Ibid*, para 49.\n\n3.7.\n\nAs to the question of abuse of process, the Judge set out what was required under English law to find an abuse of process on the part of the requesting authority (i.e., Albania). Relying on the case of *Belbin v The Regional Court of Lille, France*,233 the Judge noted that the conduct of Albania would only amount to an abuse of process if the *Extradition Act 2003* (UK) was being usurped by bad faith or a deliberate manipulation of the extradition process.234 Judge Tempia found that there had been an abuse of process on the part of Albania. She stated that the abuse of process had occurred in respect of a specific question put to Albania in an earlier mention of the extradition proceedings before another District Judge, who asked whether Albania could withdraw the warrant, to which Albania had answered in the negative. Judge Tempia said that, that answer had been \"conclusively discredited\" by the evidence of Mr Qeleshi.235 Accordingly, Albania's Reasons Document was, she said, \"totally misleading\".\n\n[2015] EWHC 149 (Admin).\n\nJudgment, para 52.\n\n*Ibid*, para 53.\n\n3.8.\n\nFurther, the Judge noted that allowing the extradition to proceed would prejudice Messrs Becchetti and De Renzis' ability to participate in the arbitration, and noted that no assurances had been given by the Minister for Justice as what \"reasonable bail conditions\" might be.236 In refusing the application to adjourn the proceedings *sine die*, she said that Messrs Becchetti and De Renzis \"would remain on bail for an indefinite period of time and subject to bail conditions. This will be an infringement on their liberty for an unspecified amount of time\".237\n\n*Ibid*, para 54.\n\n*Ibid*, para 55.\n\n3.9.\n\nJudge Tempia concluded by stating that whilst she did find that an abuse of process on the part of Albania had been made out, the Albanian Government did not act in bad faith. In relation to the Reasons Document \"I cannot find it has been produced in bad faith but there has been a manipulation and usurpation of the court process\".238\n\n*Ibid*, para 56.\n\n3.10.\n\nIn the result, as indicated above, the Judge stayed the proceedings.\n\n**The Parties' Responses to the Judgment**\n------------------------------------------\n\n3.11.\n\nOn 11 July 2016, the Tribunal invited both Parties to provide their comments on the Judgment of Judge Tempia.\n\n3.12.\n\nOnly the Claimants did so (the \"**Claimant's Letter of 18 July**\"). In that letter, the Claimants contend that the Judgment is relevant to the applications before the Tribunal in three separate respects.239\n\nClaimants' Letter of 18 July, p 2.\n\n3.13.\n\nFirst, the Claimants say that Judge Tempia's findings that there has been an abuse of process by Albania bolsters the Claimants' submission that Albania's alleged attempts to comply with the Tribunal's Order have been disingenuous.240 The Claimants point to the Judge's finding that Albania's argument that it is unable to withdraw the arrest warrants against Messrs Becchetti and De Renzis has been \"conclusively discredited\".241 The Claimants also emphasise that Judge Tempia had been taken to the provisions of Albanian law which show that the Minister of Justice had the discretion to withdraw those warrants.242 Further, the Claimants point to the Judge's acceptance that there had been \"no assurances\" as to what bail conditions might be imposed on Messrs Becchetti and De Renzis.243\n\n*Ibid*.\n\n*Ibid*, also see Judgment para 53.\n\n*Ibid*.\n\n*Ibid*, p 3.\n\n3.14.\n\nSecond, the Claimants say that Judge Tempia's finding that there has been an abuse of process confirms that the Tribunal should not modify or revoke its order. That is to say, they say that the Judgment was predicated on the Tribunal's Order, and \"if the Order were to be withdrawn, Albania could, and would, apply to re-instate extradition proceedings at any time\".244\n\n*Ibid*.\n\n3.15.\n\nThird, the Claimants contend that, notwithstanding that the extradition proceedings are now stayed, the procedural integrity of the arbitration remains under threat. This is because Albania has not sought the withdrawal of any Interpol \"Red Notices\", nor has it suspended criminal proceedings in Albania or withdrawn the arrest warrants. The Claimants contend that this means that if Messrs Becchetti and De Renzis were to travel outside of the UK, they could be extradited from a third country. This, the Claimants contend, will cause the Claimants difficulty when engaging with their Parisian and New York counsel in this arbitration.245\n\n*Ibid*.\n\n3.16.\n\nOn the same day, in separate correspondence, the Claimants informed the Tribunal that they had been notified by the UK Crown Prosecution Service that there would be no appeal from the Judgment.246\n\nClaimants' Letter of 18 July 2016; see also Exhibit C-561.\n\n3.17.\n\nThe Respondent sought leave to reply to the Claimants' Letter of 18 July. They had not submitted any submissions in relation to the Judgment when invited to by the Tribunal. The Tribunal allowed a response to the Claimants' Letter, but not to the Judgment itself, on the basis that the Respondent had already been provided an opportunity to do so.247 Despite not being given leave to do so, the Respondent submitted a letter responsive to the Judgment on 22 July 2016. It is unnecessary to repeat what was said previously about the Tribunal's concerns about the manner in which this submission was made.248\n\nEmail from ICSID to Counsel, 19 July 2016.\n\nSee para 1.28 above.\n\n3.18.\n\nThe Respondent submits that, whilst it did not accept much of what the Judge stated in the Judgment, including Judge Tempia's interpretation and comments on Albanian law, the extradition proceedings against Messrs Becchetti and De Renzis have been stayed for the duration of the ICSID proceedings, and Albania would not be appealing the Judgment.249\n\nRespondent's Letter of 22 July 2016, para 3.\n\n3.19.\n\nThe result, the Respondent contends, means that there is no reason for the maintenance of the Tribunal's Order.250 The Respondent also says that because the threat of incarceration during the proceedings has been removed, there is similarly no reason for the order to suspend the criminal proceedings in Albania to remain.251 The Respondent says that \"the mere continuation of the Albanian criminal proceedings, in which [Messrs Becchetti and De Renzis] are represented and in which they continue to play a full part, does not pose a risk to the procedural integrity of the arbitration\".252\n\n*Ibid*, para 6.\n\n*Ibid*, para 7.\n\n*Ibid*, para 9.\n\n3.20.\n\nHaving set out the submissions in considerable detail, it is now necessary to move to the analysis of those submissions.\n\n3.21.\n\nIn so doing, the Tribunal notes that it has been assisted by the ample written submissions from counsel for the Parties, as well as the submissions made at the oral hearing. For the avoidance of any doubt, the Tribunal hereby confirms that, in reaching its decisions in this Order, it has fully taken into consideration all of the written and oral submissions of the Parties, and the entirety of the evidence that has been presented by the Parties, whether or not expressly referred to below.\n\n**PART IV: TRIBUNAL'S ANALYSIS**\n--------------------------------\n\n4.1.\n\nIt should be noted from the outset that there is a relative dearth of authority and previous decisions of ICSID tribunals in respect of revocation or modification of provisional measures orders pursuant to Rule 39(3) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules. Of the decisions and commentary that does exist, it relates mainly to circumstances where tribunals were faced with changed circumstances that meant that the provisional measures recommended by those tribunals were no longer necessary. The Respondent contends, at least in respect of the extradition proceedings, that the circumstances have changed in this case.\n\n4.2.\n\nAgainst that background, and having regard to the considerable assistance provided by the Parties, the Tribunal has determined to revoke the Tribunal's Order, but to nevertheless replace it with differently-worded recommendations.\n\n4.3.\n\nIt is convenient to deal with the Respondent's Application to the Tribunal's Order first.\n\n4.4.\n\nAs to the extradition and criminal proceedings against Mr Becchetti and Mr De Renzis, the Tribunal makes the following comments:\n\n4.5.\n\nDespite the criticisms of the Claimants, the Tribunal accepts that, before and after the Claimants lodged their Application, Albania endeavoured to comply with the Tribunal's Order, at least in part. In this regard, the Tribunal notes the (appropriate) conduct on the part of the Respondent.\n\n4.6.\n\nFirst, the Respondent requested that the Home Office lodge an application to adjourn the extradition proceedings proceeding in the UK courts. The Tribunal had, of course, recommended the \"suspension\", not the \"withdrawal\", of the proceedings, and had the application to adjourn *sine die* been granted, this would have ensured compliance with the recommendation the subject of the Tribunal's Order.\n\n4.7.\n\nSecond, as to the suspension of the Albanian domestic criminal proceedings, the Respondent contends that this was not possible under Albanian law. It is unnecessary here to repeat the reasons why this is so. As will become apparent, the Tribunal need not form a concluded view as to whether these reasons are, in fact, valid ones, the effect of which was that the Respondent did, indeed, face no choice as to whether to suspend the Albanian domestic criminal proceedings.\n\n4.8.\n\nThe primary relief sought by the Respondent is revocation of the Tribunal's Order on the grounds that the recommendations therein were wrongly recommended. As an alternative, the Respondent seeks revocation or modification on the grounds of changed circumstances.\n\n4.9.\n\nThe Tribunal has no doubt that it possesses the power to revoke its provisional measures. Rule 39(3) of the Arbitration Rules confers such a power. That sub-rule begins by providing that the Tribunal \"may also recommend provisional measures on its own initiative or recommend measures other than those specified in the request\" but goes on to make plain that the Tribunal \"may at any time modify or revoke its recommendations\". While issues may arise as to whether a Tribunal is so empowered where it has delivered its Final Award, and the Tribunal is thus *functus officio*, this is not such a case. Here, the Tribunal remains seised of the proceeding and can, in appropriate circumstances, reconsider its previous orders. To contend otherwise would be contrary to the plain language of Rule 39(3) and the jurisdiction of this Tribunal to resolve the relevant dispute between the Parties which it is seised to resolve.\n\n4.10.\n\nBut the Claimants' objection goes further. As will be recalled, the Claimants submit that the Tribunal can only revoke or modify its provisional measures if there are \"changed circumstances\" warranting its intervention and that, here, there are none. That is, the Claimants say that this Tribunal does not have jurisdiction to re-consider the Order solely by way of a *de novo* hearing or re-hearing of the earlier application.\n\n4.11.\n\nWhile the Tribunal has some sympathy with that approach, it is not necessary for it to finally determine whether \"changed circumstances\" are indeed required. That is so because, on any view, the Judgment on 8 July 2016 provides the necessary \"changed circumstance\", hinge or jurisdictional basis for the Tribunal to re-consider the Tribunal's Order. That is, there are undoubtedly \"changed circumstances\" which warrant the modification (but not revocation) of the Order.\n\n4.12.\n\nAs is plain from the reasoning in the Tribunal's Order, the principal reason for making the recommendations the subject of paragraph 5.1(a) and 5.1(b)253 was the potential inability of Messrs Becchetti and De Renzis to fully participate in the arbitration if they were incarcerated.\n\nThe recommendations are extracted in full at para 1.1 above.\n\n4.13.\n\nThe Respondent has contended, on occasion in very strong terms, that the Tribunal was wrong to so conclude. But, based on the evidence then before the Tribunal and the further evidence since filed and served on the Applications, the Tribunal is not persuaded that it was then, or is now, wrong to recommend measures to protect the procedural integrity of this arbitration. The Tribunal was, and is, of the view that were Messrs Becchetti and De Renzis to be incarcerated, they would be unable to properly participate in the arbitration. The Tribunal notes the spirited opposition, indeed criticism, levelled by the Respondent concerning its conclusions or more accurately the reasons proffered for its conclusions. However, having considered all the circumstances as known to it, including the pendency of several arbitrations and institution of criminal proceedings following the first arbitration relating to the Claimants' investments, the Tribunal does not resile from the order it made or the reasons for which it made it.\n\n4.14.\n\nThat said, the principal objective for the Tribunal's recommendations has now been secured. It matters not that it was secured by the Respondent's attempt to adjourn the extradition proceedings *sine die*, or what has now transpired, namely the suspension by order of Judge Tempia.\n\n4.15.\n\nIt follows that it is unnecessary to consider the efficacy of the promise given by the Albanian Minister of Justice, and it would be inappropriate for the Tribunal to consider this issue further.\n\n4.16.\n\nAs emphasised in the Tribunal's Order, had Messrs Becchetti and De Renzis been incarcerated in Albania, their ability to participate would undoubtedly have been at least substantially impaired. Given that these two Claimants are now in the UK and are not subject to any restraint imposed, they are fully able to participate in the arbitration. Thus the object of the Tribunal's order is accomplished. There is therefore no need to order any provisional measures which would have the effect of impairing the State's sovereign rights to exercise its police powers, including the investigation, and if warranted, prosecution of criminal offences. It follows that the Tribunal has decided that the previous recommendations should be revoked, and in lieu thereof, the following recommendations be made of the Respondent, namely that it:\n\n(a) take no steps in the proceedings identified as Criminal Proceeding No. 1564 to recommence extradition proceedings in the UK against Messrs Becchetti and Mr De Renzis until the issuance of a Final Award in this proceeding; and\n\n(b) take all actions necessary to maintain the suspension of the extradition proceedings (Case Numbers 1502751601 (for Mr Becchetti) and 1502752144 (for Mr De Renzis)) currently stayed, and not to take any steps to resume those proceedings, until the issuance of a Final Award in this proceeding.\n\n4.17.\n\nThe Tribunal now moves to paragraph 5.2 of the Tribunal's Order, which, it will be recalled, relates to the recommendation that the Parties *confer* in relation to the preservation of the Assets, being those Assets which the Claimants sought to have returned by its original provisional measures application.\n\n4.18.\n\nBefore turning to determine whether an order in relation to the Assets should be made, it is necessary to say something about the Claimants' conduct in this regard. As already noted,254 the Claimants wrote on 10 March 2016 to the Respondent, seeking \"the consequential return of the Companies and their assets and bank accounts\" in order to satisfy paragraph 5.2 of the Tribunal's Order. To write in these terms was disingenuous, as it was plain that such a request (if it can be so characterised) was not in accordance with the recommendations of the Tribunal. The Tribunal, in its Order, was careful to say that it was not determining whether it would be appropriate to make any order regarding the Assets and merely invited the Parties to confer in relation to the preservation of the Assets.\n\nSee para 1.2 above.\n\n4.19.\n\nWhat was sought by the Claimants went far beyond, and did not constitute what the Tribunal considered a good faith attempt to \" seek to agree appropriate measures. to preserve\" the Assets.\n\n4.20.\n\nIn any case, since the making of the recommendation, the position has changed. In particular, on 13 May 2016, the Claimants filed and served their Memorial, by which it sought, amongst other things, the following relief.255\n\n\"B) Ordering Albania to pay monetary damages in an amount that would wipe out all of the consequences of its illegal acts and reestablish the situation that would have existed if those acts had not been committed, in an amount to be determined.\"\n\nSee para 681 of the Claimants' Memorial.\n\n4.21.\n\nThat is, in the final relief sought, there is no prayer for relief seeking the return of the Assets \u2014 only damages.\n\n4.22.\n\nFurther, the Memorial alleges that Albania has expropriated the Claimants' investments in the Kalivac project \"and has also rendered valueless the local companies whose sole business rationale had been the Kalivac Project\".256 Those local companies are Energji, 400 KV and Cable System. As to Agonset, the TV station, the Memorial asserts that \"Albania has expropriated Agonset and rendered useless its related companies... Albania has seized the Claimants' registered indirect shareholdings in Agonset and has destroyed any value in the company and its related companies\".257 Although not seeking the return of the shareholding any longer, they also say that \"[w]ere Albania to return Agonset to its shareholders, it would be less than\u2019a shell of the former investment'\",258 suggesting that, hypothetically, such shareholding may be returned to the shareholders. But, in circumstances where no relief to that effect is sought, the only proper conclusion is that the Claimants now accept that they are limited to their remedy in damages. Self-evidently, that is a matter for later determination.\n\nSee Memorial, para 572.\n\nSee Claimants' Memorial, paras 583 and 584.\n\nSee Claimants' Memorial, para 586.\n\n4.23.\n\nBefore leaving this issue, reference should, however, be made to what was said at the hearing in relation to this issue. Mr Dhar, for the Respondent, explained:259\n\n\"The trouble for the Claimants is that [the Claimants' Memorial] demonstrates that, on their own case, the horse has already bolted. The current definitive position as stated by the Claimants is that in relation to each of the relevant Albanian companies \u2014 Energji, KGE, 400 KV, Cable System, Agonset \u2014 there has been an expropriation. The Memorial is replete with emotive terms such as 'total destruction', 'sabotage', 'destruction', etcetera. [\u2026] It makes it plain that on the present case, each of those companies has already been eliminated, and that an expropriation has already taken place\".\n\nT58.22ff\n\n4.24.\n\nIn answer to a question from Mr Glick, Mr Dhar further explained,260 in relation to the prayer for relief at paragraph 681 of the Claimants' Memorial, to which reference has already been made:261\n\n\"[I]n our respectful submission [paragraph 681 of the Claimants' Memorial] demonstrates two things: one, [\u2026] it demonstrates there is no specific relief anymore; secondly, what it demonstrates is the Claimants are content to reduce their claim [\u2026] to damages. It demonstrates that damages are, on their case, an adequate remedy for the alleged expropriations. Not only do they claim that, and have dropped the claim for specific relief, they have put in two lengthy expert reports which seek to quantify, to a very specific sum, the alleged expropriations in relation to these companies.\"\n\nT62.5ff\n\nSee paragraph 4.20 above.\n\n4.25.\n\nMr Tahbaz, for the Claimants, accepted that this was the case, his reference to the issue still being \"alive\" only capable of being interpreted as being that the issue of damages was still alive in relation to their destruction or expropriation. More fully, he said.262\n\n\"With regard to the assets, we are where we are with the assets because Albania has disregarded the concerns that we believe motivated at least that portion of the Provisional Measures Order. In other words, the assets have been destroyed because of Albania's conduct, including most recently \u2014 and I believe this is right, but Mr Pinsolle will correct me if I have it wrong \u2014 Agonset, the television station, was evicted from its premises in April, I believe because of the non-payment of rent. [...] So the concerns that motivated that aspect of the Provisional Measures Order are very much still alive. The fact is the assets have been destroyed, so the case has been adjusted accordingly. It doesn't mean that if Claimants were to receive some of those assets in return, that they couldn't be rehabilitated and re-operated under the appropriate circumstances.\"\n\nT99.7ff.\n\n4.26.\n\nAt this stage, the Tribunal is not required, nor would it be appropriate, to decide whether the Assets have, in fact been destroyed or expropriated. If the Claimants succeed in this arbitration, the Tribunal is presently of the view that any loss or damage to its Assets can be adequately compensated by an award of damages. There is thus now no necessity for paragraphs 5.2 or 5.3 of the Tribunal's Order, nor for them to be replaced by some substitute, and accordingly the Tribunal has decided that they should be revoked.\n\n4.27.\n\nAs regards paragraph 5.1, should the situation change and the Claimants be prevented from effectively participating in the proceedings for any other reason, an application may be made to the Tribunal for further provisional measures. Liberty to apply is specifically granted.\n\n4.28.\n\nIt is now necessary to turn to the Claimant's Application, although it has largely been resolved by the resolution of the Respondents' Application.\n\n4.29.\n\nThe Tribunal need not make a Partial Award, as requested by the Claimants, so its jurisdictional competence to do so need not be determined. The Tribunal notes in passing, however, that neither the ICSID Convention nor the ICSID Arbitration Rules make reference to a Partial Award. The Tribunal, nevertheless, expects the Respondent to comply with the recommendations made herein, and notes that their maintenance is consistent with that which was ordered by the Judgment.\n\n4.30.\n\nThat leaves only the question of whether a penalty should be ordered against the Respondent. As already noted, the Tribunal is not persuaded that the conduct of the Respondent was such as to involve a contravention of the recommendation. But, even if it had, any monetary compensation awarded in the Final Award can adequately compensate the Claimants for their loss, whatever that may be.\n\n**PART V: TRIBUNAL'S ORDER**\n----------------------------\n\n5.1.\n\nThe Tribunal's Provisional Measures Order of 3 March 2016 is revoked and, in lieu thereof, the Tribunal recommends that the Republic of Albania:\n\n(a) take no steps in the proceedings identified as Criminal Proceeding No. 1564 to recommence extradition proceedings in the United Kingdom against Messrs Becchetti and De Renzis until the issuance of a Final Award in this proceeding; and\n\n(b) take all actions necessary to maintain the suspension of the extradition proceedings (Case Numbers 1502751601 (for Mr Becchetti) and 1502752144 (for Mr De Renzis)) currently stayed, and not to take any steps to resume those proceedings, until the issuance of a Final Award in this proceeding.\n\n5.2.\n\nThe Applications are otherwise dismissed.\n\n5.3.\n\nThe costs of the Applications are reserved for later determination in the Final Award.\n\n5.4.\n\nThere be liberty to apply."}, {"Title": "Decision on the Respondent\u2019s Proposal for Disqualification of Dr. Charles Poncet", "Type": "Arbitrator & Judge Challenge", "Date": "2022-12-01T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Decision on the Respondent\u2019s Proposal for Disqualification of Dr. Charles Poncet\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**I. PROCEDURAL HISTORY**\n-------------------------\n\n1.\n\nOn April 22, 2022, the Republic of Albania filed an Application for Revision of the Award rendered on April 24, 2019, in *Hydro S.r.l. and others v. Republic of Albania* (ICSID Case No. ARB/15/28).\n\n2.\n\nOn May 9, 2022, the Secretary-General registered the Application for Revision. In the Notice of Registration, the Secretary-General informed the Parties that it would transmit the Application for Revision to the members of the original Tribunal and request them to inform ICSID whether they were willing to take part in the revision proceedings.\n\n3.\n\nOn May 12, 2022, the Secretary-General informed the Parties that Dr. Charles Poncet had expressed his willingness to take part in the revision of the award, but that Dr. Michael Pryles AO PBM and Mr. Ian Glick KC had informed ICSID that they were unfortunately not in a position to act in the revision proceedings. As a result, the Secretary-General informed the Parties that the Tribunal could not be reconstituted in accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 51(2) and invited the Parties to proceed to constitute a new Tribunal, including the same number of arbitrators, and appointed by the same method, as the original Tribunal.\n\n4.\n\nOn May 17, 2022, the Claimants requested an explanation of why Dr. Michael Pryles and Mr. Ian Glick are \"not in a position to act in the revision proceedings.\"\n\n5.\n\nOn May 20, 2022, ICSID informed the Parties that Dr. Pryles and Mr. Glick had confirmed that they decline to participate in the revision proceedings, and reiterated the invitation to the Parties to proceed to constitute a new Tribunal.\n\n6.\n\nOn August 3, 2022, following appointment by the Respondent, Mr. Robert Anderson KC accepted his appointment as arbitrator.\n\n7.\n\nOn August 10, 2022, following appointment by the Claimants, Dr. Charles Poncet accepted his appointment as arbitrator.\n\n8.\n\nOn August 23, 2022, the Respondent submitted a letter proposing the disqualification of Dr. Charles Poncet.\n\n9.\n\nOn August 24, 2022, ICSID noted that in this case the tribunal had not yet been constituted, and that, accordingly, the Centre could not take any action on the disqualification proposal submitted by the Respondent in accordance with Chapter V of the ICSID Convention and ICSID Arbitration Rule 9. ICSID further informed the Parties that the Respondent's letter would be transmitted to Dr. Poncet and Mr. Anderson KC for their information only.\n\n10.\n\nOn October 17, 2022, following appointment by the Chairman of the ICSID Administrative Council pursuant to Article 38 of the ICSID Convention, Mr. Grant Hanessian accepted his appointment as arbitrator in this case. On the same date, ICSID informed the Parties that the Tribunal was deemed to have been constituted, and the proceeding to have begun, as of October 17, 2022, pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule 6.\n\n11.\n\nOn October 18, 2022, the Respondent filed a Proposal for Disqualification of Dr. Poncet pursuant to Article 57 of the ICSID Convention.\n\n12.\n\nOn October 19, 2022, ICSID acknowledged receipt of the Respondent's Proposal for Disqualification and informed the Parties that the proceeding was suspended as of October 18, 2022, pursuant to Rule 9 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules, except insofar as the payment of the advance requested by the Centre on October 18, 2022 was concerned.\n\n13.\n\nOn October 25, 2022, the Unchallenged Arbitrators adopted a schedule for submissions on the Respondent's Proposal for Disqualification.\n\n14.\n\nOn October 27, 2022, the Claimants submitted their Opposition to the Proposal for Disqualification.\n\n15.\n\nOn October 28, 2022, ICSID wrote to the Parties on behalf of Dr. Poncet, informing them that Dr. Poncet will not express views as to the merits of the Respondent's Proposal for Disqualification, and that Dr. Poncet had stated that he is independent and impartial, and will remain so throughout the proceeding.\n\n16.\n\nOn November 4, 2022, the Respondent submitted Further Observations on the Proposal for Disqualification of Dr. Poncet. On the same date, the Claimants indicated that they did not have further observations regarding the Respondent's Proposal for Disqualification.\n\n**II. ALBANIA'S PROPOSAL FOR DISQUALIFICATION**\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n17.\n\nIn its submissions in support of its Proposal for Disqualification,1 the Respondent does not argue that Dr. Poncet lacks independence or impartiality under Article 14(1) of the ICSID Convention, and emphasizes that it does not question or \"cast doubt on Dr Poncet's character or competence.\"2\n\nThere is no issue as to the admissibility of the Proposal, which was submitted on October 18, 2022, one day after ICSID notified the Parties that the Tribunal was constituted in these revision proceedings. The Proposal was therefore made \"promptly\" as required by ICSID Arbitration Rule 9(1).\n\nLetter from the Respondent to ICSID, August 11, 2022, p. 1; *see also* the Respondent's Proposal for Disqualification, \u00b6 3.\n\n18.\n\nRather, the Respondent contends that Rule 1(4) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules precludes the appointment of Dr. Poncet to the Tribunal in these revision proceedings.3 ICSID Arbitration Rule 1(4) provides:\n\nNo person who had previously acted as a conciliator or arbitrator in any proceeding for the settlement of the dispute may be appointed as a member of the Tribunal.\n\n*See* the Respondent's Proposal for Disqualification, \u00b6\u00b6 21-28.\n\n19.\n\nThe Respondent submits that ICSID Arbitration Rule 1(4) prohibits the Claimants' appointment of Dr. Poncet in this revision proceeding as he \"previously acted as a[n] \u2026. arbitrator in [a] proceeding for the settlement of the dispute\" as a member of the original Tribunal that rendered the Award in this case.4\n\n*See* the Respondent's Proposal for Disqualification, \u00b6\u00b6 2(d), 22.\n\n20.\n\nThe Unchallenged Arbitrators understand the Parties' submissions to raise two principal issues: first, whether ICSID Arbitration Rule 1(4) applies to these revision proceedings; and second, if Rule 1(4) does apply to revision proceedings, whether that rule precludes the appointment of Dr. Poncet to this Tribunal. The Parties' submissions on these points are summarized below, followed by our conclusions.\n\n**(1) Albania's Position**\n--------------------------\n\n***a. Applicability of ICSID Arbitration Rule 1(4) to Revision Proceedings***\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n21.\n\nIn arguing that ICSID Arbitration Rule 1(4) applies to revision proceedings, the Respondent first references Article 51(3) of the ICSID Convention5, regarding requests for revision, which states:\n\nThe request shall, if possible, be submitted to the Tribunal which rendered the award. If this shall not be possible, a new Tribunal shall be constituted in accordance with Section 2 of this Chapter [IV of the Convention].6\n\n*See* the Respondent's Proposal for Disqualification, \u00b6\u00b6 6,20(c).\n\nThe corresponding ICSID Arbitration Rule 51, titled \"Interpretation or Revision: Further Procedures\", states as follows:  \n1. Upon registration of an application for the interpretation or revision of an award, the Secretary-General shall forthwith:  \n(a) transmit to each member of the original Tribunal a copy of the notice of registration, together with a copy of the application and of any accompanying documentation; and (b) request each member of the Tribunal to inform him within a specified time limit whether that member is willing to take part in the consideration of the application.  \n2. If all members of the Tribunal express their willingness to take part in the consideration of the application, the Secretary-General shall so notify the members of the Tribunal and the parties. Upon dispatch of these notices the Tribunal shall be deemed to be reconstituted.  \n3. *If the Tribunal cannot be reconstituted in accordance with paragraph (2), the Secretary-General shall so notify the parties and invite them to proceed, as soon as possible, to constitute a new Tribunal, including the same number of arbitrators, and appointed by the same method, as the original one*. (Emphasis added.)\n\n22.\n\nThe Respondent next observes that Section 2 of Chapter IV of the ICSID Convention provides, at Article 37(2)(b) titled \"Constitution of the Tribunal\", the mechanism for appointment of the \"new Tribunal\" under Article 51(3).7 Article 37(2)(b) states:\n\nWhere the parties do not agree upon the number of arbitrators and the method of their appointment, the Tribunal shall consist of three arbitrators, one arbitrator appointed by each party and the third, who shall be the president of the Tribunal, appointed by agreement of the parties.\n\n*See* the Respondent's Proposal for Disqualification, \u00b6\u00b6 7, 20(e).\n\n23.\n\nThe Respondent then notes that Article 44 of the ICSID Convention provides that \"any arbitration proceeding\", including this revision proceeding, shall be conducted \"in accordance with the ICSID Arbitration Rules.\"8 Article 44 provides, in part:\n\nAny arbitration proceeding shall be conducted in accordance with the provisions of this Section [Section 3 of Chapter IV concerning \"Powers and Functions of the Tribunal] and, except as the parties otherwise agree, in accordance with the Arbitration Rules in effect on the date on which the parties consented to arbitration.\n\n*See* the Respondent's Proposal for Disqualification, \u00b6\u00b6 8, 10, 20(a), 21*.*\n\n24.\n\nFinally, the Respondent states that ICSID Arbitration Rule 53 provides that the ICSID Arbitration Rules apply generally to revision proceedings.9 Rule 53 states:\n\nThe provisions of these Rules shall apply *mutatis mutandis* to any procedure relating to the interpretation, revision or annulment of an award and to the decision of the Tribunal or Committee.\n\n*See* the Respondent's Proposal for Disqualification, \u00b6\u00b6 2(c), 11, 20(b), 21*.*\n\n25.\n\nThe Parties not having otherwise agreed, the Respondent concludes that Article 44 of the ICSID Convention and ICSID Arbitration Rule 53 require that ICSID Arbitration Rule 1(4) apply to the composition of the Tribunal in these revision proceedings.10\n\nThe Respondent's Proposal for Disqualification, \u00b6 21.\n\n26.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the provisions in Article 51(3) of the ICSID Convention and ICSID Arbitration Rule 51(2) permitting reconstitution of the ***entire*** original tribunal for revision proceedings is an explicit exception to Rule 1(4)11 and that these provisions, read together, permit reconstitution only of the entire original tribunal and not part of the original tribunal.12\n\nThe Respondent's Proposal for Disqualification, \u00b6 24-25; The Respondent's Further Observations, \u00b6\u00b6 15-17.\n\nThe Respondent's Proposal for Disqualification, \u00b6\u00b6 26 and 28.\n\n27.\n\nThe Respondent argues that there are good reasons for this choice by the drafters of the ICSID Convention and ICSID Arbitration Rules. The Respondent submits that a partially reconstituted tribunal, unlike a fully reconstituted tribunal: (1) requires that some tribunal members familiarize themselves with the case, reducing any procedural efficiencies that may be obtained by reconstituting the entire original tribunal; (2) leads to a perception that original member(s) of the tribunal will have greater influence on the outcome of revision proceedings than new member(s) of the tribunal; and (3) by agreeing to arbitrate under the ICSID Arbitration Rules, the parties consented to the application of ICSID Arbitration Rule 51(2)\u2014permitting reconstitution of the ***entire*** original tribunal\u2014but did not consent to a ***partial*** reconstitution of the original tribunal.13\n\nThe Respondent's Proposal for Disqualification, \u00b6\u00b6 25-26.\n\n28.\n\nFor the Respondent, therefore, the ICSID Convention and ICSID Arbitration Rules provide that \"either all members of the original tribunal hear the application for revision, or none of them do.\"14\n\nThe Respondent's Proposal for Disqualification, \u00b6 28.\n\n29.\n\nRegarding the Claimants' argument that ICSID Arbitration Rule 1 (including Rule 1(4)) applies only where the ICSID Arbitration Rules expressly state that it so applies\u2014as under ICSID Arbitration Rule 7 (regarding replacement of arbitrators prior to constitution of the tribunal) and ICSID Arbitration Rule 11 (regarding filling vacancies on tribunals),15 the Respondent argues that ICSID Arbitration Rule 1 by its terms applies only to \"the formation of a new tribunal as a whole.\"16 ICSID Arbitration Rules 7 and 11, by contrast, concern the appointment of a single member of a tribunal. The Respondent argues that the explicit reference to Rule 1 in Rules 7 and 11 is therefore necessary and appropriate to make clear that any vacancies on a tribunal are subject to the same limitations as are applicable to the tribunal as a whole\u2014including the limitations in Rule 1(4).17\n\nICSID Arbitration Rules 7 and 11 provide:  \n**Rule 7 - Replacement of Arbitrators**  \nAt any time before the Tribunal is constituted, each party may replace any arbitrator appointed by it and the parties may by common consent agree to replace any arbitrator. The procedure of such replacement shall be in accordance with Rules 1, 5 and 6.  \n**Rule 11 - Filling Vacancies on the Tribunal**  \n(1) Except as provided in paragraph (2), a vacancy resulting from the disqualification, death, incapacity or resignation of an arbitrator shall be promptly filled by the same method by which his appointment had been made.  \n(2) In addition to filling vacancies relating to arbitrators appointed by him, the Chairman of the Administrative Council shall appoint a person from the Panel of Arbitrators:  \n(a) to fill a vacancy caused by the resignation, without the consent of the Tribunal, of an arbitrator appointed by a party; or  \n(b) at the request of either party, to fill any other vacancy, if no new appointment is made and accepted within 45 days of the notification of the vacancy by the Secretary-General.  \n(3) The procedure for filling a vacancy shall be in accordance with Rules 1, 4(4), 4(5), 5 and, mutatis mutandis, 6(2).\n\nThe Respondent's Further Observations, \u00b6 65.\n\n*Id*.\n\n30.\n\nRegarding the Claimants' argument that Article 52(3) of the ICSID Convention\u2014which specifically prohibits original tribunal members from participating in annulment proceedings\u2014demonstrates that Rule 1(4) does not apply to specific ICSID Arbitration Rules unless explicitly referenced, the Respondent argues that Rule 1(4) would not apply to annulment proceedings in any event since requests for annulment are determined by an \"*ad hoc* Committee***\"***, not a \"Tribunal\", the term used in ICSID Arbitration Rule 1(4), and that such committees are \"a completely different and *sui generis* body with no other analogue in international law or dispute resolution procedures.\"18 The Respondent further notes that the provisions of Article 52(3) of the ICSID Convention and ICSID Arbitration Rule 52 prohibiting original tribunal members from sitting on an annulment committee cannot be waived, unlike the provisions of ICSID Arbitration Rule 1(4).19\n\nThe Respondent's Further Observations, \u00b6 20.\n\nThe Respondent's Further Observations, \u00b6\u00b6 23, 62-63.\n\n***b. Application of ICSID Arbitration Rule 1(4) to Revision Proceedings***\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n31.\n\nAs to the application of ICSID Arbitration Rule 1(4) in revision proceedings, the Respondent says the rule is \"clear on its face\"20 prohibiting the appointment of Dr. Poncet since he \"previously acted as\u2026.arbitrator in any proceeding for the settlement of the dispute\" by serving on the original tribunal.\n\nThe Respondent's Proposal for Disqualification, \u00b6 27.\n\n32.\n\nThe Parties have focused on two aspects of the text of Rule 1(4): first, whether a revision proceeding concerns the same \"dispute\" that was before the original tribunal; and second, whether an original tribunal acted in a \"proceeding\" that was \"previous\" to a revision proceeding.\n\n33.\n\nRegarding the first issue, the Respondent argues that revision proceedings involve the same \"dispute\" that was before the original Tribunal.21 The Respondent notes that the word \"dispute\" is not mentioned in Article 51 of the ICSID Convention, nor in ICSID Arbitration Rules 50 and 51, and that these provisions do not require a party seeking revision to identify any \"dispute\" between the parties as to whether the award should be revised, but rather to state:\n\nthe change sought in the award, the discovery of some fact of such a nature as decisively to affect the award, and evidence that when the award was rendered that fact was unknown to the Tribunal and to the applicant, and that the applicant's ignorance of that fact was not due to negligence.22\n\nThe Respondent's Further Observations, \u00b6\u00b6 85-93.\n\nICSID Arbitration Rules, Rule 50(1)(c)(ii).\n\n34.\n\nThus, in the Respondent's view, a revision request \"reopens\" the same dispute that was before the original Tribunal to permit a party to introduce additional, decisive and newly discovered facts.23\n\nThe Respondent's Proposal for Disqualification, \u00b6 34.\n\n35.\n\nRegarding the second issue, the Respondent states that revision proceedings are a new proceeding, rather than a continuation of the proceeding before the original Tribunal24\u2014 and that the original Tribunal proceeding is therefore \"previous\" to the revision proceeding. The Respondent stresses that the original Tribunal is *functus officio.*25\n\nThe Respondent's Further Observations, \u00b6\u00b6 75-84.\n\nThe Respondent's Further Observations, \u00b6\u00b6 71, 75.\n\n36.\n\nThe Respondent also cites the practice of the International Court of Justice (\"**ICJ**\"). The Respondent notes that when an application for revision is received by the ICJ \"the case receives a new name and is listed separately in the Court's General List and on its website\" and a party to a ICJ revision proceeding may select a new *ad hoc* judge.26\n\nThe Respondent's Further Observations, \u00b6 77.\n\n37.\n\nThe Respondent cites commentaries by Prof. Dr. Christoph Schreuer and others in support of its position regarding the meaning of the word \"dispute\" in ICSID Arbitration Rule1(4).27 The Respondent particularly relies on an article by Ms. Jessica Joly-H\u00e9bert stating that interpretation proceedings at the ICJ concern a \"new dispute\" between the parties as to the meaning of the award, while ICJ revision proceedings do not involve a \"new dispute\".28\n\nThe Respondent's Further Observations, \u00b6\u00b6 86-87. Prof. Schreuer's treatise states:  \nThe institution of a procedure for revision does not require the existence of a dispute between the parties. There is no need for prior communication between the parties demonstrating a difference of opinion. In view of the award's *res judicata* effect, a party has a right to revision even if there is no disagreement as to the existence and relevance of new facts. This is also reflected in the different texts of Arts 50 [on interpretation] and 51, as Art. 50(1) expressly states that either party may submit an application for the interpretation of an award \"if any dispute shall arise between the parties as to the meaning or scope of an award\". No such wording has been included for Art. 51. (Emphasis in original.)  \nSW Schill (gen. ed.), Schreuer's Commentary on the ICSID Convention, vol II (3rd ed: CUP 2022) (\"**Schreuer**\"), Art. 51, \u00b6 11 (**RL-21**).\n\nThe Respondent's Proposal for Disqualification, \u00b6 38; the Respondent's Further Observations, \u00b6 86 *citing* J. Joly-H\u00e9bert, 'Distinguishing Interpretation and Revision Proceedings at the International Court of Justice' (2020) 19 LPICT 200, 227 (**RL-15**)*.* Ms. Joly-H\u00e9bert states, regarding ICJ revision and interpretation proceedings, that:  \n\"[A] new dispute is not required for revision proceedings to be admitted [...]. The objective [of revision] proceedings is to 'correct' a judgment or to modify it in light of the discovery of a new fact of importance. Consequently, one cannot deny the strong connection that continues to operate between original and revision proceedings.\"  \nThe Respondent submits that Ms. Joly-H\u00e9bert's article should be relied on solely for the purpose of understanding the differences between revision and interpretation proceedings and points to the fundamental differences between composition of panels at ICSID and the ICJ \u2014particularly (i) the permanent character of the ICJ; (ii) that ICJ tribunals consist of 15 permanent judges, with each state before it in a particular case being permitted to add an additional ad hoc judge in the event they do not have a judge of their nationality on the bench, rather than the three arbitrators in an ICSID proceeding; and (iii) the absence of information asymmetry\u2014to assert that the ICJ's practice of partially reconstituting the original panel for revision proceedings is not analogous to ICSID practice. The Respondent's Further Observations, \u00b6\u00b6 39-45.\n\n38.\n\nThe Respondent notes that Dr. Aaron Broches (former General Counsel to the World Bank and Chairman of the ICSID Convention's Drafting Committee) has observed that the ICJ Statute directly inspired the provisions of the ICSID Convention and ICSID Arbitration Rules regarding revision and interpretation proceedings.29\n\nThe Respondent's Proposal for Disqualification, \u00b6 36, *citing* A. Broches, 'Observations on the Finality of ICSID Awards', in *Selected Essays: World Bank, ICSID, and Other Subjects of Public and Private International Law* (Brill 1995) 295, 296-297 (**RL-16**).\n\n39.\n\nIn respect of the Claimants' arguments that in the *Wena* and *Micula* cases30 members of the original tribunals were appointed to interpretation tribunals, and the provisions of the ICSID Convention and ICSID Arbitration Rules concerning constitution of tribunals in interpretation and revision proceedings (Articles 50 and 51 of the ICSID Convention and ICSID Arbitration Rules 50 and 51) are virtually identical, the Respondent has two responses.\n\n*Wena Hotels Limited v. Arab Republic of Egypt*, ICSID Case No. ARB/98/4, Decision on Interpretation, October 31, 2005 and *Ioan Micula, Viorel Micula and others v. Romania*, ICSID Case No. ARB/05/20.\n\n40.\n\nFirst, regarding the *Wena* and *Micula* cases, the Respondent notes that there is no indication that any party objected to the partial reconstitution of the original tribunal.31 As stated previously, the Respondent argues that ICSID Arbitration Rule 1(4) can be waived by the parties, and the Respondent states that this occurred in these two interpretation proceedings.\n\nThe Respondent's Further Observations, \u00b6 31.\n\n41.\n\nSecond, the Respondent argues that ICSID Arbitration Rule 1(4) is not applicable to interpretation proceedings in any event because, as previously discussed, such proceedings, unlike revision proceedings, do not involve the same \"dispute\" that existed before the original Tribunal.32\n\nThe Respondent's Proposal for Disqualification, \u00b6\u00b6 33-44; the Respondent's Further Observations, \u00b6\u00b6 24-29.\n\n42.\n\nThe Respondent notes that some commentators, including Professor Schreuer, have concluded that partial reconstitution of original tribunals is permitted in both ICSID interpretation and revision cases.33 Reflecting on the *Wena* interpretation proceeding, the Scheuer treatise states:\n\nIn constituting a new Tribunal, Wena exercised its right to appoint one of the arbitrators from the original Tribunal.\n\n...\n\nThere is no reason why some or one of the arbitrators who served on the original tribunal should not be appointed to a reconstituted tribunal for purposes of interpreting the award\u2026. Therefore, it is possible, and may even be advisable, to appoint the remaining original arbitrators even if one arbitrator becomes unavailable.\n\n...\n\nArt. 51(3) [concerning revision proceedings] is identical to the first two sentences of Art. 50(2) [concerning interpretation proceedings]. The questions surrounding the reconvening of the tribunal or the constitution of a new tribunal are examined in the context of Art. 50(2) dealing with interpretation (see Art. 50, paras. 39\u201350). The observations made there are also relevant to Art. 51(3) dealing with revision.34\n\nThe Respondent's Proposal for Disqualification, \u00b6 42.\n\nSchreuer, Art. 50, \u00b6\u00b6 46, 49, Art. 51, \u00b6 39.\n\n43.\n\nAnother commentator makes the same point and does not distinguish between interpretation and revision proceedings. Citing to the *Wena* interpretation case, Ms. Angeline Welsh states:\n\nThe new Tribunal [constituted under Rule 51(3)] is to be appointed by the same method as the original Tribunal with the same number of arbitrators, and it is open to the parties to appoint members of the original Tribunal.35\n\nWelsh, \"Rule 51 \u2013 Interpretation or Revision: Further Procedures,\" in J Fouret et al. (eds), *The ICSID Convention, Regulations and Rules: A Practical Commentary* (Edward Elgar 2019) 1284, \u00b6 27.50 & n. 75 (**CAR-9**).\n\n44.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the analysis of these authors is \"incomplete and unpersuasive\", arguing that they do not consider ICSID Arbitration Rule 1(4) and overlook the distinction between revision and interpretation proceedings.36 The Respondent notes that Dr. Broches has written that interpretation tribunals may be \"composed in part, or entirely, of arbitrators other than those who rendered the award\"37 but does not repeat this statement when discussing revision tribunals. Reflecting generally on the authorities referenced by the Claimants, the Respondent emphasizes that \"the situation before the Unchallenged Members has never before occurred in ICSID's history and so has therefore never been considered in previous decisions or given direct consideration in the scholarship.\"38\n\nThe Respondent's Further Observations, \u00b6\u00b6 32-35.\n\nA.

Applicability of ICSID Arbitration Rule 1(4) to Revision Proceedings***\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n45.\n\nThe Claimants submit that ICSID Arbitration Rule 1(4) is not applicable to the constitution of a tribunal in revision proceedings.\n\n46.\n\nThe Claimants assert that where Rule 1(4) is applicable, the Rules expressly so state, as is the case with respect to ICSID Arbitration Rules 7 and 11,39 and that there is no such reference in ICSID Arbitration Rule 51.40\n\nThe Claimants' Opposition, \u00b6\u00b6 72-76.\n\n*Id.* at \u00b6 77.\n\n47.\n\nContrasting ICSID Convention Article 52(3), relating to annulment proceedings, which specifically prohibits members of the original tribunal from sitting in annulment proceedings, with the provisions in Article 51 of the ICSID Convention and ICSID Arbitration Rule 51 relating to revision and interpretation proceedings, the Claimants submit that if the drafters intended to preclude the appointment of members of the original tribunal in interpretation and revision proceedings they would have expressly so stated.41\n\nThe Claimants' Opposition, \u00b6\u00b6 37-38.\n\n48.\n\nThe Claimants thus contend that the ICSID Convention and the ICSID Arbitration Rules do not exclude members of the original tribunal from participating in a revision tribunal.42\n\nThe Claimants' Opposition, \u00b6\u00b6 39-41.\n\n***b. Application of ICSID Arbitration Rule 1(4) to Revision Proceedings***\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n49.\n\nAs to the application of ICSID Arbitration Rule 1(4) to Rule 51(3) on revision proceedings, the Claimants submit that both practice and authorities reject the Respondent's position.43\n\nThe Claimants' Opposition, \u00b6\u00b6 42-54.\n\n50.\n\nAs to the meaning of the word \"dispute\" in ICSID Arbitration Rule 1(4), the Claimants argue that revision proceedings involve a different \"dispute\" than that before the original tribunal.

ANALYSIS**\n-----------------\n\n56.\n\nAs to the applicability of ICSID Arbitration Rule 1(4) to revision proceedings\u2014apparently a question of first impression\u2014we agree with the Respondent's analysis of the relevant provisions of the ICSID Convention and ICSID Arbitration Rules. We find no basis in the text or structure of the ICSID Convention and ICSID Arbitration Rules to hold that ICSID Arbitration Rule 1, titled \"General Obligations\", does not generally apply to all ICSID Arbitration Rules concerning constitution of arbitral tribunals\u2014including ICSID Arbitration Rule 51 regarding the constitution of revision and interpretation tribunals.\n\n57.\n\nHowever, as to the application of ICSID Arbitration Rule 1(4) to the constitution of revision tribunals\u2014also a question of first impression\u2014we agree with the Claimants that Rule 1(4) does not preclude Dr. Poncet's appointment to the revision Tribunal.\n\n58.\n\nWe begin by stating that we find no basis in the ICSID Convention or ICSID Arbitration Rules to distinguish an arbitrator's eligibility for appointment to an interpretation tribunal from an arbitrator's eligibility for appointment to a revision tribunal. The constitution of interpretation and revision tribunals are treated identically in Articles 50 and 51 of the ICSID Convention and in ICSID Arbitration Rule 51. The original tribunals are *functus officio* in both cases.\n\n59.\n\nAs the Parties have noted, there have been two interpretation proceedings, the *Wena* and *Micula* cases, in which the original tribunals were partially reconstituted. We accept the Respondent's argument that the provisions of ICSID Arbitration Rule 1(4) may be waived by the parties and note that we have not been presented with evidence that any party objected to the appointment of the original arbitrators to the interpretation panels in those cases.\n\n60.\n\nHowever, we do not agree with the Respondent that ICSID Arbitration Rule 1(4) prohibits a partial reconstitution of a revision panel. As discussed above, the partial reconstitution of the original tribunals in the *Wena* and *Micula* interpretation cases has been noted approvingly by commentators, and we have not been made aware of any commentary on the interpretation and revisions provisions in the ICSID Convention or ICSID Arbitration Rules that suggests that ICSID Arbitration Rule 1(4) prohibits partial reconstruction of the original tribunal in either case.\n\n61.\n\nWe interpret ICSID Arbitration Rule 1(4) consistently with this practice and commentary. We hold that that (i) the reference in Rule 1(4) to any \"person who had previously acted as a conciliator or arbitrator in any proceeding\" refers to persons who acted in such proceedings prior to commencement of the ICSID case that gives rise to the revision request; (ii) Dr. Poncet, as a member of the original Tribunal in this case, did not act in \"proceedings\" \"previous[]\" to these revision proceedings; and therefore (iii) Dr. Poncet is not prohibited by ICSID Arbitration Rule 1(4) from serving as arbitrator in these revision proceedings.\n\n62.\n\nAlthough we understand that this is merely an administrative practice, we note that these revision proceedings bear the same ICSID case number as the original proceedings and are listed with the original proceeding on ICSID's website, and not as a separate case with a separate number, as is the case with ICJ revision proceedings. Our interpretation of ICSID Arbitration Rule 1(4) harmonizes ICSID Convention Articles 50 and 51 and ICSID Arbitration Rules 1 and 50 to 53 and is consistent with the practice and commentary.\n\n63.\n\nWe have considered the policy arguments advanced by the Respondent for interpreting ICSID Arbitration Rule 1(4) to prohibit partial reconstitution of original tribunals in revision proceedings, but we note the Claimants' arguments that the ICSID Convention and ICSID Arbitration Rules permit filling of tribunal vacancies (ICSID Arbitration Rule 11) without regard for any \"asymmetry of information\" that may exist when a new arbitrator joins an existing tribunal.\n\n64.\n\nThe Proposal to Disqualify Dr. Poncet is dismissed.\n\n**IV. COSTS**\n-------------\n\n65.\n\nBoth Parties have requested, or indicated an intent to request, their costs incurred in connection with Respondent's Proposal for Disqualification.57 The question of costs will be determined at a later stage.\n\nThe Claimants' Opposition, \u00b6 88; the Respondent's Further Observations, \u00b6\u00b6 94-97.\n\n**V. DECISION**\n---------------\n\n66.\n\nFor the reasons set forth above, the Unchallenged Arbitrators decide as follows:\n\na. The Proposal to Disqualify Dr. Charles Poncet is dismissed.\n\nb. A decision on the costs arising from the Proposal will be taken at a later stage."}]}
