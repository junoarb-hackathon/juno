INTRODUCTION**\n-------------------\n\n1.\n\nIn this Decision, the Tribunal addresses and rules upon the Claimants' Application for Provisional Measures dated 18 October 2006 (the \"Application\").\n\n2.\n\nBy way of introduction, it is recalled that on 17 May 2006, the Claimants, Occidental Petroleum Corporation (\"OPC\") and Occidental Exploration and Production Company (\"OEPC\"), filed their Request for Arbitration against the Respondent, The Republic of Ecuador (\"Ecuador\").1 The arbitration concerns various alleged breaches by Ecuador under both domestic law and international law, as well as under the Treaty Between the United States of America and The Republic of Ecuador Concerning the Encouragement and Reciprocal Protection of Investment (the \"Treaty\" or \"BIT\"). In addition, the Claimants rely on an agreement referred to as the \"Participation Contract\" dated 21 May 1999 between OEPC, Ecuador and Petroecuador in connection with the exploration and exploitation of hydrocarbons in what has been labelled \"Block 15\" of the Ecuadorian Amazon. The *Caducidad* Decree of the Participation Contract was issued by the Ecuadorian Minister of Energy and Mines on 15 May 2006, resulting in the Participation Contract's termination.\n\nThe Request was initially made against both Ecuador and the Ecuadorian entity known as \"Petroecuador\", but the Claimants subsequently dropped the latter as a Respondent.\n\n3.\n\nIt is also useful to recall that the relief sought by the Claimants in their Request for Arbitration is set forth as follows (see Claimants' Request for Arbitration at paragraph 75):\n\n\"75. Claimants respectfully request an award in their favor,\n\n(a) Declaring that Respondents have breached their obligations under the Participation Contract and the Operating Agreements, the Treaty, and Ecuadorian and international law;\n\n(b) Ordering Respondents to declare null and void the *Caducidad* Decree and to reinstate fully OEPC's rights under the Participation Contract and the Operating Agreements;\n\n(c) Directing Respondents to indemnify Claimants for all damages caused as a result of their breaches, including costs and expenses of this proceeding, in amounts to be determined at the hearing, which Claimants believe will exceed US$1 billion;\n\n(d) Directing Respondents to pay Claimants interest on all sums awarded, in amounts to be determined at the hearing, and to order any such further relief as may be available and appropriate in the circumstances.\"\n\n4.\n\nThe Claimants' Request for Arbitration further sets forth an initial iteration of the provisional measures now sought as part of the present Application (see Claimants' Request for Arbitration at paragraphs 76 and 77):\n\n\"**REQUEST FOR PROVISIONAL MEASURES**\n\n76. Immediately following the issuance of the *Caducidad* Decree, Respondents have proceeded to seize all of OEPC's assets and have effectively taken over all of OEPC's operations in Block 15. They have also indicated their intention to enter into a contract with another company to ensure continued production from Block 15. Unless Respondents are immediately ordered to cease or refrain from such actions and to return OEPC to its rightful operation and exploitation of Block 15, they will render the consequences of Respondents' breaches irreversible and the relief of *restitutio in integrum* sought by Claimants in this arbitration impossible.\n\n77. Therefore, in order to preserve Claimants' rights under the Treaty and OEPC's rights under the Participation Contract until the dispute has been adjudicated on the merits, Claimants request the Tribunal to order provisional measures pursuant to Arbitration Rule 39. Pursuant to paragraph 1 of that Rule, Claimants hereby specify: (i) the rights to be preserved; (ii) the measures the recommendation of which is requested; and (iii) the circumstances that require such measures:\n\n(a) *The rights to be preserved*. As stated above, Claimants will seek final relief in the form of an order from the Tribunal requiring Respondents to declare null and void the *Caducidad* Decree and to reinstate fully OEPC's rights under the Participation Contract. Under the Participation Contract, OEPC has the exclusive right to carry out exploration and exploitation activities on Block 15.\n\n(b) *The measures the recommendation of which is requested*. Claimants respectfully request that, until it has rendered an award on the merits, the Tribunal: (i) order Respondents immediately to cease their occupation of Block 15 and OEPC's facilities; (ii) order Respondents immediately to take all necessary measures to enable OEPC to resume its operations in Block 15; (iii) enjoin Respondents from taking OEPC's share in the production from Block 15; and (iv) enjoin Respondents from entering into a contract with another party to carry out exploration and exploitation activities on Block 15.\n\n(c) *The circumstances that require such measures*. Claimants will suffer irreparable injury if Respondents fail to abide by any of the orders and injunctions requested in (b) above. It is widely recognized that Petroecuador does not have the resources or technical ability to operate Block 15, and any attempt by it to do so would certainly diminish the productivity of the block and damage the block's wells irreparably. It would be more difficult for the Tribunal to restore OEPC's contract rights once another oil company has been granted a contract to carry out exploration and exploitation activities on Block 15. It is also widely recognized that Ecuador, which has failed to pay the VAT Award, would not have the resources to pay a monetary award in the instant arbitration in order to make Claimants whole, since damages will be in excess of US$1 billion. Because the Tribunal would be unable to restore *the status quo ante* once it was disrupted, it must preserve the *status quo ante* through provisional measures pending the outcome of this arbitration.\"\n\n5.\n\nThe Claimants' request for provisional measures was further particularized in their Application dated 18 October 2006. The Respondent filed its Counter-Memorial thereto on 1 December 2006. The Claimants' Reply was filed on 15 December 2006, followed by the Respondent's Rejoinder which was filed on 30 December 2006. A two-day hearing on the Claimants' Application was subsequently held before the Tribunal on 2-3 May 2007 in Washington, during which the provisional measures ultimately sought by the Claimants were significantly amended as set forth in more detail below.\n\n**II. FACTUAL BACKGROUND AS PRESENTED BY THE CLAIMANTS**\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n6.\n\nFor purposes of this Decision, the Tribunal sets forth below a brief summary of the facts as presented in the Claimants' Request for Arbitration. However trite, the Tribunal would observe that this summary is not to be taken as prejudging the issues of fact or law to be resolved at the jurisdictional or merits phase of this arbitration.\n\n7.\n\nAs noted earlier, OEPC, Ecuador and Petroecuador entered into a \"Participation Contract\" dated 21 May 1999. Pursuant to the Participation Contract and related \"Operating Agreements\" for the unified fields of Eden-Yuturi and Limoncocha, OEPC was granted the exclusive right to carry out exploration and exploitation activities in the area assigned to it, namely \"Block 15\" of the Ecuadorian Amazon. From the execution of the Participation Contract and the Operating Agreements in May 1999 until their termination on 15 May 2006, OEPC carried out its contractual obligations, including the implementation of investment and work plans as provided for in those agreements.\n\n8.\n\nIn October 2000, OEPC entered into two agreements (the \"AEC Farmout Agreement\" and the \"AEC Operating Agreement\", together the \"AEC Agreements\") with City Investing Company Ltd. (now known as AEC Ecuador Ltd., \"AEC\"), a Bermuda subsidiary of EnCana Corporation, which is a Canadian oil and gas company. Pursuant to the AEC Agreements, OEPC and AEC entered into a two-phase transaction.\n\n9.\n\nIn a first phase, OEPC granted to AEC a 40% economic interest in the share of the production from Block 15 that accrued to OEPC under the Participation Contract and the Operating Agreements. In exchange for this share in oil produced from Block 15, AEC agreed to pay to OEPC both (i) a series of certain annual amounts over a four-year period to contribute towards capital investments in Block 15 and (ii) 40% of the operating costs incurred by OEPC. Section 2.01 of Article II of the AEC Farmout Agreement states that:\n\n\"OEPC agrees to [...] farm out and transfer to AEC [...] a 40% economic interest (the 'Farmout Interest') in the Farmout Property [...]. The Farmout Interest to be transferred to AEC [\u2026] does not include nominal legal title to an interest in Block 15 or an interest as a party to the [Block 15] Agreements. OEPC shall continue to own 100% of the legal title to the [Block 15] Agreements and to the interest in Block 15 granted or provided for in the [Block 15] Agreements.\"\n\n10.\n\nIn a second phase, it was contemplated that after AEC had made all required payments at the end of the four-year period, and subject to OEPC then obtaining the necessary government approvals, OEPC would assign legal title to AEC. The second stage is described in Section 4.01 of Article IV of the Farmout Agreement:\n\n\"[A]fter AEC has made all payments [\u2026] OEPC and AEC shall execute and deliver such documents as are required to convey legal title to AEC in and to a 40% economic interest in the [Block 15] Agreements and Block 15 and to make AEC a party to the [Block 15] Agreements as owner of such 40% economic interest (subject to obtaining required governmental approvals).\"\n\n11.\n\nOn 1 November 2000, OEPC issued a press release announcing the AEC Agreements. The release confirmed that OEPC would remain the operator of Block 15 and that AEC would receive a 40% economic interest in the operations.\n\n12.\n\nSubsequently, on 15 February 2001, the Government of Ecuador and *Oleoducto de Crudos Pesados Ecuador (OCP) S.A.* (\"OCP S.A.\"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of OCP Ltd. in which OPC indirectly holds a 14.15% interest, executed the \"Contract to Construct and Operate the Heavy Crude Oil Pipeline and Provision of Public Services for Transportation of Hydrocarbons\" (the \"OCP Contract\"). During the implementation of the OCP Contract, OCP S.A. entered into a variety of construction commitments, including a US$700 million (approximately) construction contract with Techint International Construction Corporation on 3 July 2001.\n\n13.\n\nThe OCP project required US$900 million in project financing for the OCP pipeline, which was to be secured through the signing of ship-or-pay commitments by the foreign oil companies participating in the project. On 30 January 2001, OEPC therefore entered into an Initial Shipper Transportation Agreement with OCP S.A. The ship-or-pay commitments relating to Block 15 required OEPC either to increase its production to 70,000 barrels per day, more than double its existing production, or to pay the tariff for unused capacity.\n\n14.\n\nIn order to achieve the required production levels, OEPC initiated an extensive work plan to develop the Eden-Yuturi field during the first two quarters of 2001. In 2001 alone, OEPC individually committed to nearly US$250 million in drilling and construction contracts to build a secondary pipeline to connect Eden-Yuturi to the OCP pipeline and to boost production in that field. Since 1999, OEPC has invested a total of more than US$900 million in the development of Block 15.\n\n15.\n\nIn the interim, OEPC had commenced another arbitration under the Treaty to seek certain VAT refunds. A final and binding award was issued on 1 July 2004 (the \"VAT Award\"), awarding OEPC US$75 million in damages and affirming OEPC's position regarding its statutory right to the VAT refunds.2\n\nEcuador subsequently challenged the VAT Award in the English courts. On 2 March 2006, the High Court dismissed Ecuador's challenge and upheld the VAT Award. Ecuador appealed that decision and the appeal was dismissed on 4 July 2007.\n\n16.\n\nShortly thereafter, on 15 July 2004, as AEC had satisfied all payments due under the AEC Farmout Agreement, OEPC requested approval from the Ecuadorian government to proceed with the transfer of legal titles. The government did not grant such approval. Rather, on 24 August 2004, citing the AEC Agreements, as well as a variety of alleged violations claimed by the National Hydrocarbons Department (\"DNH\") to be breaches of the Participation Contract, the Attorney General of Ecuador issued orders to the Ministry of Energy and Mines to terminate the Participation Contract and the Operating Agreements through a declaration of \"*caducidad*\".\n\n17.\n\nOn 8 September 2004, the Minister of Energy and Mines heeded the Attorney General's demand and instructed the Executive President of Petroecuador to initiate the *caducidad* procedures; the latter did so by sending OEPC a notice of alleged breaches of the Participation Contract on 15 September 2004. The notice quoted the allegations that the Attorney General had made in his 24 August 2004 letter, including that *caducidad* should be declared because OEPC had allegedly: (i) transferred rights and obligations under the Participation Contract to AEC without ministerial approval; (ii) entered into a consortium or association to carry out exploration or exploitation operations without ministerial approval; (iii) not invested the minimum amounts required under the Participation Contract; and (iv) repeatedly committed violations of the *Hydrocarbons Law* and regulations.\n\n18.\n\nOver the following 18 months or so, OEPC made a number of submissions rebutting the allegations lodged by the Attorney General, but to no avail.\n\n19.\n\nOn 15 May 2006, the Minister of Energy and Mines notified OEPC of his decision to terminate the Participation Contract by declaring its *caducidad,* thereby dismissing OEPC's defenses. The Claimants filed their Request for Arbitration four days later on 19 May 2006.\n\n**III. OVERVIEW OF THE APPLICATION**\n------------------------------------\n\n20.\n\nIn their Application, the Claimants state that they are compelled to urgently seek provisional measures because of an \"imminent aggravation of the dispute and the irreversible harm it would do\" (see Claimants' Application at paragraph 5). As noted earlier, the Claimants' Application has been modified significantly since it was first articulated in their initial submission on 18 October 2006. However, as a theme running throughout their Application, the Claimants have always represented that the circumstances \"require measures preserving Claimants' rights from further degradation\" (see Claimants' Application at paragraph 7).\n\n21.\n\nIn defining the circumstances requiring the provisional measures sought, the Claimants have referred to a \"situation that existed and that should be re-established\" in the following terms (see Claimants' Application at paragraphs 10-12):\n\n\"10. [\u2026] In broad strokes, prior to confiscation the Claimants had a highly desirable, efficient and environmentally responsible operation at Block 15. At Block 15, OEPC operated a robust complex of oil fields; due to OEPC's efforts those fields steadily produced an average of approximately 100,000 barrels of oil per day; OEPC had the right to dispose of its approximately 75% share of that oil, which produced substantial revenues for it and for Respondent; that level of production was maintained by a variety of modern drilling techniques and an elaborate and demanding plan requiring several hundred million dollars of annual reinvestment in the fields; and OEPC could transport its share of the oil hundreds of kilometres through a pipeline that had been built with financing secured by the multi-year 'ship-or-pay' obligation of OEPC and other foreign oil producers to pay for substantial 'reserved capacity.' In short, Claimants had a substantial and profitable oil exploration and production operation, modern and well-maintained equipment and facilities, and dependable infrastructure.\n\n11. Respondent has recently indicated that it is likely to act in ways that will interfere with the Tribunal's ability to re-establish that pre-existing situation. Respondent has sent mixed messages about how it will manage Block 15. However, it is clear that the options it is considering are to have Petroecuador or a separate state-owned company operate Block 15 or to offer it to a third-party operator. Either course would aggravate the dispute. If Petroecuador or another Ecuadorian state-owned company operates the Block, the Block will suffer irreparably because Petroecuador does not have the management skills, resources, freedom or will to maintain adequate levels of re-investment in the Block. [...]\n\n12. At the same time, because OEPC agreed to significant ship-or-pay commitments in connection with Block 15 and because Petroecuador is now transporting the Block 15 crude that it has taken from OEPC without crediting those shipments and the related tariff payments against OEPC's ship-or-pay commitments, Claimants must continue to pay for pipeline capacity that they are now unable to use, currently approximately $100,000 per day. [\u2026]\"\n\n22.\n\nThe Claimants summarized their initial Application as being made \"to preserve their right to effective restitutionary relief of their acquired rights regarding Block 15\", including \"restoration of OEPC's operatorship of Block 15 and the benefits that operatorship provides\" (see Claimants' Application at paragraph 14). They have argued that without the provisional measures they seek, \"Respondent is poised to take steps that will (1) threaten Claimants' right ultimately to return to Block 15, (2) degrade the integrity of the Block itself, and (3) unnecessarily cause Claimants prospectively to incur additional but avoidable damages\" (see Claimants' Application at paragraph 32). Thus, in essence, the Claimants' Application is intended to preserve their alleged right to specific performance of the Participation Contract.\n\n23.\n\nMore particularly, regarding the alleged threats to their said right ultimately to resume Block 15 operations, the Claimants point to the possibility \"that Ecuador will not choose Petroecuador or another state agency to operate Block 15 and instead will hand it over to a third-party operator\" (see Claimants' Application at paragraph 50). They state (*ibid.* at paragraph 54):\n\n\"54. At present, Claimants do not know what course Ecuador intends to take with respect to the future operator of Block 15. However, it is clear that the alienation of the block - should Ecuador follow that path - would be highly prejudicial to Claimants' rights and would interfere with the effectiveness of a restitutionary award by this Tribunal. Claimants would have an award against Respondent, but they would then have to displace any third-party operator who was at that time occupying the Block. Doing so has uncertain prospects and could itself take years of litigation. Such a situation should obviously be avoided to the greatest extent possible.\"\n\n24.\n\nRegarding the alleged degradation of Block 15, the Claimants have taken issue with the current involvement of Petroecuador in Block 15. They quote, *inter alia*, various press reports in support of their assertion that \"various problems have created a long pattern of production declines in Petroecuador-operated fields\" (see Claimants' Application at paragraph 37). The Claimants maintain that \"[o]nce this production capacity is reduced, it becomes practically impossible to restore production to levels that existed at the time of Ecuador's expropriation of the fields. OEPC's interests in Block 15 will, therefore, be irreparably harmed\" (*ibid.* at paragraph 33).\n\n25.\n\nFinally, regarding the alleged additional but unavoidable damages, the Claimants have maintained that contracts related to Block 15 are being undermined, namely those entered into in connection with the OCP pipeline. They aver (see Claimants' Application at paragraph 57) that \"[\u2026] OCP ship-or-pay commitments will continue until 2018. OEPC remains obligated under the ISTA to ship 42,000 bbl/day. At the current rates, OEPC therefore owes approximately $100,000 per day in tariff payments to OCP S.A. for Block 15 reserved capacity despite the fact that, due to the expropriation, it is not shipping any oil on the pipeline\" (citations omitted).\n\n26.\n\nTurning to the specific provisional measures initially sought by the Claimants in their Application, they are identified as follows (see Claimants' Reply at paragraph 53; see also Claimants' Application at paragraphs 66-93):\n\n(1) An order directing Ecuador to ensure, and to direct Petroecuador or any other state-owned company operating Block 15 to ensure, a minimum amount of funding for Block 15, *i.e.* annually at least $350 million in capital and operating expenditures in Block 15 to maintain and develop the existing fields. This provisional measure is said to be required in order to prevent irreversible damage to the fields and a permanent reduction in the production capacity of Block 15.\n\n(2) An order directing Ecuador to establish with the Claimants, and to direct Petroecuador or any other state-owned company operating Block 15 to establish with the Claimants, a Joint Supervisory Board. This provisional measure is said to be required in order to ensure effective oversight and management of Block 15 and thereby prevent a permanent loss of production capacity.\n\n(3) An order directing Ecuador to supply the Claimants, and to direct Petroecuador or any other state-owned company operating Block 15 to supply the Claimants, with monthly reports regarding the operation of Block 15. This provisional measure is requested solely in the event the Tribunal decides not to order the establishment of a Joint Supervisory Board.\n\n(4) An order directing Ecuador to refrain from entering into or approving agreements with third parties for the operation of Block 15 pending the outcome of this arbitration. This provisional measure is said to be required in order to prevent further aggravation of the dispute, as such third-party agreements would allegedly impair the Tribunal's ability to grant effective final relief.\n\n(5) An order directing Ecuador to take all necessary steps to ensure, and to direct Petroecuador or any other state-owned company operating Block 15 to take all necessary steps to ensure, that the oil produced from Block 15 shipped through the OCP pipeline is credited towards OEPC's ship-or-pay obligations. This provisional measure is said to be required in order to reduce an ever-increasing form of damage that the Claimants seek to recover in this arbitration and thereby prevent further aggravation of the dispute.\n\n27.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that during the first day of hearing, *i.e.* on 2 May 2007, following extensive oral submissions made by counsel and ensuing discussions amongst the parties and their representatives, the Claimants significantly amended their Application. The revised Application sought the following:\n\n\"Claimants request that the Tribunal order Respondent:\n\n1. To invest, and to cause Petroecuador to invest, in accordance with the plan submitted as exhibit 15 to the witness statement of Wilson Pastor, approximately US$497.5 million in the development and operation of Block 15 and the Unified Fields during 2007, consisting of approximately US$292.3 million in CAPEX and approximately US$205.2 million in OPEX; and to invest, and to cause Petroecuador to invest, a comparable amount under a comparable plan for each year until the issuance of a final award; [hereinafter identified as the \"minimum investment\" request]\n\n2. To give, and to cause Petroecuador to give, the Tribunal and Claimants advance notice of no less than sixty days before entering into any contractual arrangement with a third party for the operation of Block 15 and the Unified Fields; [hereinafter identified as the \"third-party transfer notice\" request]\n\n3. To produce, and to cause Petroecuador to produce, to the Tribunal and to Claimants, monthly reports regarding the operation of Block 15 and the Unified Fields, including (i) production, by field and by reservoir, and (ii) capital and operating expenditures, detailed by category of expense, until the issuance of a final award; [hereinafter identified as the \"monthly reports\" request]\n\n4. To cause Petroecuador to enter into a contractual arrangement with OEPC for the shipment of 42,000 barrels per day of crude on OEPC's unused reserved capacity on the OCP at a tariff of US$ 1.46 per barrel. [hereinafter identified as the \"OCP pipeline\" request]\n\nShould the Tribunal decide not to grant Claimants the relief requested under (1), (2), and (3) above, Claimants request in the alternative that the Tribunal order Respondent to establish, and to cause Petroecuador to establish, with Claimants a joint supervisory board with the composition, mandate, and powers set forth in Claimants' Application for Provisional Measures of October 18, 2006.\"\n\n28.\n\nSubsequently, at the hearing on 3 May 2007, the Claimants withdrew their alternative request for the establishment of a Joint Supervisory Board.\n\n29.\n\nFollowing representations made by Ecuador's Attorney General before the Tribunal, the \"minimum investment\" request, *i.e.* the request for an order directing Ecuador to invest, or cause Petroecuador to invest, in Block 15 as defined above, was also withdrawn. The representations on the basis of which the Claimants withdrew this request were the following:\n\n\"In my capacity as Procurador General del Estado, I have the authority to be able to issue opinions of a binding nature for the Public Sector, regarding the correct interpretation and scope of the existing laws and regulations.\n\nIn this context, I can affirm that:\n\na) In the Operations and Budget Plan for the development and operation of Block 15 and the unified fields, approved by the Board of Directors of Petroecuador via Resolution 17-DIR-2007, approximately $497 million are dedicated for the development and operations of Block 15 and the unified fields during the year 2007, consisting of approximately $292.3 million in CAPEX and approximately $205.2 million in OPEX.\n\nb) These provisions are binding and, in conformity with Organic Law 2006-57, carry with them a legal requirement to dedicate the budgeted funds for the corresponding activities.\n\nc) All the institutions of the State, including supervising agencies and also State-owned companies like Petroecuador, are consequently obligated by law to take the best measures within the scope of their authority to assure compliance with the obligations described above, especially considering that it is in the highest national interest that they be complied with. The Procuraduria General del Estado, as a supervising agency, will comply with its legal obligations.\"\n\n30.\n\nAt this point, the Tribunal was thus left to rule on the three following outstanding requests for provisional measures:\n\n(1) the \"third-party transfer notice\" request (as per paragraph 2 of the revised Application);\n\n(2) the \"monthly reports\" request (as per paragraph 3 of the revised Application); and\n\n(3) the \"OCP pipeline\" request (as per paragraph 4 of the revised Application).\n\n31.\n\nSubsequently, on 25 May 2007, the Claimants wrote to the Tribunal advising \"of an agreement on one more of the requests for provisional measures\" as follows:\n\n\"Ecuador has advised Claimants that the documents sought in paragraph 3 of Claimants' revised request for provisional measures presented by counsel on May 2, 2007 - namely, monthly financial reports and quarterly production reports pertaining to Block 15 - are publicly accessible pursuant to the provisions of Ecuador's Transparency Law. Ecuador has given its assurance that if Claimants submit a request under this law to Mr. Wilson Pastor, General Manager of Block 15, he will promptly furnish them with the documents as the law requires. Based on this assurance, Claimants believe there is no need for a provisional measure requiring the production of these documents, and they withdraw paragraph 3 of their revised request.\"\n\n32.\n\nIn the next section of this Decision, the Tribunal will therefore review the parties' respective positions and arguments to the extent that they are relevant to the two outstanding requests of the Claimants' revised Application, namely the \"third-party transfer notice\" request and the \"OCP pipeline\" request, respectively. Naturally, it is not meant to serve as an exhaustive review of the parties' submissions in connection with the Application at issue, but rather as a summary of arguments relevant to the Tribunal's analysis and findings on the remaining items thereof.\n\n**IV. THE PARTIES' POSITIONS**\n------------------------------\n\n**A. The Claimants' Position**\n------------------------------\n\n33.\n\nAs briefly indicated earlier, it is the Claimants' position that the provisional measures they seek, be they as initially formulated or as subsequently amended, \"are carefully tailored to maintain the *status quo ante* without requiring the tribunal to prejudge the merits or to afford Claimants the full relief they will seek on the merits\" (see Claimants' Reply at paragraph 4).\n\n34.\n\nMore particularly, in support of their Application, the Claimants rely on \"the primacy of the remedy of restitution\" (see*e.g.* Claimants' Reply at paragraph 10). Citing passages from various international tribunals, the Claimants argue that international law jurisprudence recognizes that, unless restitution is impossible, it is \"the preferred remedy for internationally wrongful acts by a State\" (see Claimants' Reply at paragraphs 29-30).\n\n35.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, \"Ecuador has not shown, and has not even seriously attempted to show, that restitution is impossible as that term is used in international law\" (see Claimants' Reply at paragraph 30). Characterizing the Respondent's position as being based on the erroneous proposition that an injured party has no international law right to restitution in kind, the Claimants maintain (see Claimants' Reply at paragraph 3):\n\n\"3. Respondent's authorities provide no support for its contention. In the cases Respondent has cited, either the Claimant [ *sic* ] chose not to seek restitution in kind or restitution in kind was impossible. Hence, these authorities reinforce the urgent need for provisional measures to prevent restitution in kind from becoming impossible. Without such measures, the right to restitution will be eviscerated.\"\n\n36.\n\nIt follows that the Claimants' concern that Block 15 may be transferred to a third party is central to their contention that, without the provisional measures sought such as notification in the event of a third-party transfer, restitution will become impossible. In the words of the Claimants (see Claimants' Reply at paragraph 63):\n\n\"63. [\u2026] Claimants here are not asking for the benefits of the Participation Contract, or for any of the oil produced from Block 15 or the substantial revenues it will generate. They are asking only for measures that will preserve the possibility of such relief in a final award.\"\n\n37.\n\nRegarding the \"third-party transfer notice\" request, it was emphasized at the hearing that this request remains premised on the Claimants' alleged right of restitution (see Hearing Day 1 at page 119 and Hearing Day 2 at page 343):\n\n\"We would say it's not necessary for you to rule today that they are not allowed to cede or transfer Block 15 to any other party. But, rather, we would ask you simply to order that if Ecuador changes its intention, it provide the Tribunal and us with 60 days' notice of any plan to cede or transfer Block 15 to any other party, and that would allow us to come back to you at the appropriate time and ask for the order that we have sought so that restitution would be possible.\n\nObviously, if they do cede or transfer the block to any other party, then restitution will become almost impossible.\"\n\n\"There can be little doubt that few things would be more prejudicial to our right to restitution than such a transfer because, once it took place, it would be very difficult to unscramble the egg.\"\n\n38.\n\nAs for their \"OCP pipeline\" request, the Claimants made the following additional observations (see Claimants' Reply at paragraphs 64-65):\n\n\"64. Finally, Respondent's argument that the provisional measures requested will prejudice their right, as owner and operator, to decide how to transport the crude oil produced from Block 15 is difficult to understand. The provisional measures requested by Claimants will not 'decide' anything for Respondent. Respondent has already decided for itself that it will transport oil through the OCP pipeline. Indeed, Petroecuador has no other option: the OCP pipeline is at present the only way to transport Block 15's heavy crude from the depths of the Amazon to the Esmereldas coast. Witness statement of Gerald Ellis at \u00b6 34. To that end, Petroecuador has signed contracts with other private companies with capacity on the OCP to ship its oil produced from Block 15 through that pipeline. The sole question remaining is to which of the private companies' capacity will that oil be credited. The order sought by Claimants requiring Respondent to ensure that the percentage of oil corresponding to Claimants' participation be credited to OEPC's capacity will substantially reduce an ever-increasing form of damage that Claimants will seek to recover, and it will do so *at no cost* to Petroecuador. Petroecuador is already paying other private companies to ship through the OCP. Furthermore, the order requested by Claimants will not force Respondent to breach or otherwise abrogate these contracts, because those contracts do not mandate a minimum level of shipment by Petroecuador, but simply permit Petroecuador to use and to pay for the OCP capacity of those private companies.\n\n65. Despite Respondent's claim to the contrary, there is indeed international authority for such a measure in these circumstances. While *Distributor A v. Manufacturer B*, cited by Claimants, naturally involved different facts than those present here, the principle underlying the provisional measure ordered in that case is not fact dependent. This principle bears repeating: it is 'unreasonable to expect that a party wait for the final award' when its losses mount merely with the passage of time and when further economic harm 'should be avoided rather than remedied.' Cl. Auth. 6, *Distributor A v. Manufacturer B*, Case No. 10596, Interlocutory Award of 2000, Yearbook Commercial Arbitration, Vol. XXX 66, 72-73 (2005).\" (emphasis in original)\n\n39.\n\nAt the hearing, the Claimants' final position regarding the \"OCP pipeline\" request was put to the Tribunal in the following terms (see Hearing Day 2 at pages 430-431):\n\n\"[W]e would tell the panel that we would offer that we will provide as soon as possible - hopefully within a week or so - to Petroecuador a contract that would reflect the terms that we have asked for here; namely, that they would ship 42,000 barrels of oil at the current price that they have, because they don't have any other price from anybody else, and with a best-price offer within it, that if they could show a *bona fide* contract to ship other volumes, we would have the opportunity to accept or release those volumes. We will offer that to Ecuador, and we will report back to the Tribunal in 30 days about whether we have a deal or not. And if Mr. Reichler is serious that they are willing to enter into the best commercial deal with anybody, including Occidental, then since we are offering the best price, since we have best-price protection in this, we hope very much they will accept it. If they don't, perhaps that will say something about whether this needs to be imposed or whether this really is just commercial issues operating there.\"\n\n40.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the Claimants did seek Ecuador's voluntary acceptance of an OCP pipeline arrangement with Petroecuador by preparing and submitting to Ecuador a draft agreement to that effect. On 19 July 2007, Ecuador informed the Tribunal that it considered the Claimants' draft agreement \"inadmissible\", citing legal, economic and commercial reasons. By letter dated 26 July 2007, the Claimants accordingly renewed their \"OCP pipeline\" request, in addition to their \"third party notice\" request.\n\n41.\n\nFinally, in connection with Petroecuador and its relationship to Ecuador, it is the Claimants' position that the provisional measures they seek are appropriately directed against Ecuador given that Petroecudor is one of its state instrumentalities. They submit (see Claimants' Reply at paragraph 68):\n\n\"68. In sum, it is clear that Petroecuador is an agent of Ecuador. Petroecuador implements Ecuador's hydrocarbons policy (Cl. Auth. 49, Hydrocarbons Law Art. 6) and carries out functions - such as entering into hydrocarbons contracts on behalf of the state - which are necessary for the administration of natural resources; these functions and resources pertain and belong to the state. RA \u00b6\u00b6 32-33. Because it has been created by law to exercise the rights of the state, Petroecuador is an 'institution of the state' under the Ecuadorian Constitution. Cl. Auth. 50, Ecuadorian Constitution, Art. 118(5). In his witness statement submitted with Respondent's Answer ('Alvarez WS'), Petroecuador General Counsel, Dr. Raul Moscoso Alvarez acknowledges that the Hydrocarbons Act provides 'that the State is to explore and exploit deposits directly through Petroecuador' and that Petroecuador 'is a State Enterprise created by law to exercise a public power.' Alvarez WS at 1. The fact that it has been organized in a corporate form with 'its own legal personality,' Alvarez WS at 1, does not make Petroecuador any less of an instrumentality of the Respondent.\" (footnotes omitted)\n\n**B. The Respondent's Position**\n--------------------------------\n\n42.\n\nThe Respondent rejects the Claimants' assertion regarding the alleged availability of restitution in the circumstances of this case. The Respondent maintains (see Respondent's Counter-Memorial at paragraphs 3-5):\n\n\"3. The fatal flaw in this argument is that the 'right' that Claimants seek to preserve by means of their requested provisional measures is nonexistent. There is no right to specific performance of a natural resources concession agreement that has been terminated or cancelled by a sovereign State; the lawful remedy in the event of wrongful or illegal action by the State is payment of monetary compensation. Accordingly, Claimant [ *sic* ] has no right to obtain 'restitution' in the form of an order reinstating the Participation Contract and returning the Block 15 oil field to Claimants. Claimants' remedy, if they prevail at the merits phase of these proceedings, is monetary compensation. Since the 'right' on which Claimants' provisional measures request is based does not exist, it follows that the request must be denied.\n\n4. In their Request for Arbitration, Claimants sought by way of relief either specific performance of the Participation Contract or, in the alternative, monetary compensation to make them 'whole' for the economic injury they purportedly suffered as a result of what they alleged to be Respondent's 'expropriation' of their contract rights. Their Request for Arbitration is therefore an admission that they can, in fact, be made whole by monetary compensation. This in itself is a reason to deny them the specific performance they seek by means of the Request for Provisional Measures, since it is axiomatic that specific performance is unavailable when monetary compensation will make whole the injured party.\n\n5. It is also axiomatic that when monetary compensation is sufficient to redress an injury there is no irreparable harm. This is still another reason why Claimants' Request for Provisional Measures must be denied. To warrant provisional measures the requesting party must show that the requested measures are necessary to preserve a right in dispute that is threatened with imminent and irreparable harm. Not only is there no right to specific performance of the Participation Contract, there is also no irreparable harm since any injury Claimants might have suffered as a result of Respondent's termination of the Contract is fully compensable by a monetary award.\"\n\n43.\n\nThe Respondent further emphasizes that the Claimants have the burden of proof of establishing \"that there is a right to be preserved and that provisional measures are urgently needed to prevent irreparable prejudice to that right\" and that they have failed to do so (see Respondent's Counter-Memorial at paragraph 4). To the extent that the Claimants are in fact seeking to enforce a right to obtain specific performance of the Participation Contract, the Respondent reiterates that no such right exists. In the words of the Respondent (see Respondent's Counter-Memorial at paragraph 11):\n\n\"11. [\u2026] The entire Request for Provisional Measures is premised on the existence of Claimants' purported right to a restoration of the Participation Contract and a return of Block 15. The specific measures Claimants seek are all for the purpose of preserving that 'right' and none other. It follows then that if this 'right of restitution' does not exist - that is, if Claimants do not have a right to specific performance of the Participation Contract - then the provisional measures request must be denied. In that case, they will have failed to show that any rights 'which are the object of the dispute' are threatened with irreparable harm and urgently in need of protection. In fact, Claimants have no right to specific performance of the Participation Contract, or otherwise to the restoration of the Contract or the return of Block 15. They have failed to advance any solid legal basis for the existence of such a right because there is none.\" (footnote omitted)\n\n44.\n\nReviewing international case law on this point, the Respondent stresses that the Claimants' Application erroneously conflates the right of restitution and specific performance (see*e.g.* Respondent's Rejoinder at paragraph 16). It is the Respondent's position that \"[s]pecific performance is but one form of restitution\" (*ibid*.), monetary compensation being another (see Respondent's Rejoinder at paragraph 6):\n\n\"6. The restitution, if any, to which Claimants ultimately may be entitled, is in the form of monetary compensation in an amount sufficient to 'make them whole.' By itself, the availability of monetary compensation as a form of restitution defeats their provisional measures request.\"\n\n45.\n\nThe Respondent emphatically states that \"not a single arbitral tribunal has ordered a sovereign State to unwind an expropriation or to specifically perform an investment agreement\" (see Respondent's Rejoinder at paragraph 31). The reason for the absence of such a ruling is, in the Respondent's view, simple (see Respondent's Rejoinder at paragraph 27):\n\n\"[A] sovereign State may not be ordered against its will to restore to a private investor an investment or concession that it has terminated or expropriated. In such circumstances, the State can only be required to pay monetary compensation.\"\n\n46.\n\nMoreover, the Respondent argues that the Claimants' Application seeks to place the Claimants in the position they were in prior to the termination of the Participation Contract. This implies securing rights via judicial processes in Ecuador which the Claimants did not do (see Respondent's Counter-Memorial at paragraphs 44-45):\n\n\"44. In this case, the termination decree ending the Participation Contract was issued by the Ministry of Energy and Mines on May 15th, 2006, and was notarized on the same date, such that the right to file a judicial complaint *[recurso de plena jurisdiction],* requesting that the court declare the act illegal and remedy the rights violated has expired. The only remaining possibility is for Claimants to raise a claim of nullity before the Administrative Appeals Chamber in order to qualify a tribunal - in a separate proceeding, if Claimants succeed in the original case - to hear any actions related to the performance of the Contract.\n\n45. Consequently, under Ecuadorian law, Claimants cannot themselves create any legal right to be placed in the position they held prior to the termination decree, not even through a judgment by the Ecuadorian courts that the decree was illegal. In order to create such a right, Claimants must have successfully initiated and completed two judicial processes and, as stated by the tribunal in *Maffezini v. Kingdom of Spain*, the presumption of success or failure on the merits is pure speculation and does not provide a sufficient basis to support an actual, existing right.\" (footnote omitted)\n\n47.\n\nThis argument regarding illegality as a prerequisite for the provisional relief sought by the Claimants is further particularized as follows (see Respondent's Rejoinder at paragraph 13):\n\n\"13. Claimants' purported 'right of restitution,' which they interpret as a right to specific performance, is at best highly debatable. But if this right exists (which Ecuador denies, as shown below), there must be a prior showing of illegality on Ecuador's part. Absent illegality, there is no right to restitution, let alone specific performance. Since illegality has not been, and cannot be demonstrated or presumed at this stage of the proceedings, Claimants cannot show that they possess any 'right' that urgently requires protection from irreparable harm, let alone the form of 'protection' that they have requested.\"\n\n48.\n\nIt follows, according to the Respondent, that restitution cannot be deemed to be a \"right\" held by the Claimants in the circumstances and that there is, hence, no irreparable prejudice or urgent need to protect it, as required by Article 47 of the ICSID Convention and Arbitration Rule 39 (see Respondent's Counter-Memorial at paragraph 47). In this regard, the Respondent adds that the Claimants have implicitly acknowledged that the rights at issue in this arbitration are purely economical (*ibid*.). This \"admission\" on the part of the Claimants is said to be determinative given the \"well established principle of international law that losses that may be compensated in the final award do not warrant protection through provisional measures\" (see Respondent's Counter-Memorial at paragraph 48). Interpreting Article 47 of the ICSID Convention and Arbitration Rule 39, the Respondent states (see Respondent's Counter-Memorial at paragraph 53):\n\n\"53. [\u2026] Although neither Article 47 of the Convention nor Arbitration Rule 39 uses the words 'urgency' or 'imminent danger,' the ICSID cases uniformly employ these standards - as do the cases decided by the International Court of Justice under Article 41 of the ICJ Statute, upon which Article 47 of the Convention was based - and award provisional measures only in circumstances where there is an urgent need to protect rights that are in imminent danger of irreparable harm such that the affected party cannot await the final resolution of the case on the merits.\" (footnote omitted)\n\n49.\n\nThe Respondent expanded this argument during the hearing and referred to the \"seven principles\" regarding the appropriateness of provisional measures in international law:\n\n(i) there must be an urgent necessity to prevent irreparable prejudice to the rights which are the subject of the dispute;\n\n(ii) the threatened harm must be imminent and more than a mere possibility;\n\n(iii) the irreparable injury must not be capable of being remedied by the payment of monetary compensation;\n\n(iv) the provisional measures must be forward-looking;\n\n(v) the provisional measures must be ordered to preserve the rights at issue, not to give the requesting party the benefit or enjoyment of those rights before the final award;\n\n(vi) the provisional measures may not be awarded to protect rights in dispute of the requesting party if those same measures would cause irreparable prejudice to the rights in dispute of the other party; and\n\n(vii) the burden of proof falls upon the party requesting the measures.\n\n50.\n\nThis list, the Tribunal notes, does not include the principle of \"aggravation of the dispute\". The Respondent objects to the Claimants' allegations of an \"aggravation of the dispute\" in connection with the \"third-party transfer notice\" and \"OCP pipeline\" requests. The Respondent argues as follows: (see Respondent's Counter-Memorial at paragraphs 91 and 95):\n\n\"91. Moreover, there are no cases in ICSID or any other tribunal in which the principle of aggravation of the dispute has been applied to grant anything remotely close to the kind of extraordinary measures Claimants seek, which are tantamount to specific performance of the Contract. The principle of avoiding aggravation of a dispute was developed - and has been uniformly applied - in the case law of ICSID and the International Court of Justice (including in all of the cases on which Claimants rely) *only* to address conduct by either or both parties after the arbitration has commenced that threatens the peace between them while a case is ongoing, or to prevent a party from resorting to its national courts and, thereby, prejudicing the other party's ability to have the dispute determined by the international forum provided for in the contract or treaty at issue. Fundamentally, it is a principle of orderly conduct of an international arbitration to prevent the parties from engaging in conduct that would hinder the arbitration itself.\n\n[...]\n\n95. Respondent is not engaging in any of the types of conduct that provisional measures against aggravation of the dispute are intended to address. It is doing nothing to provoke Claimants or make it more difficult for the Tribunal to resolve this dispute, and it has not made any attempt to have the dispute determined by its own courts instead of by this Tribunal. Therefore, there is no basis for provisional measures to prevent Respondent from 'aggravating the dispute' because there is no act by, or contemplated by, Respondent that constitutes aggravation of this dispute.\" (emphasis in original)\n\n51.\n\nAt the hearing, referring to the above-listed \"seven principles\", the Respondent summarized its objection to the \"third-party transfer notice\" request as follows (see Hearing Day 2 at pages 388-389):\n\n\"[...] The rights in dispute have to be protected for both parties. But everyone agrees - it is uncontroverted now that there is no effort, there is no plan, there is no intention, there is no indication of a likelihood of change in intention regarding the nontransfer of Block 15. There is no evidence of imminent harm, even assuming that the transfer would be harm, again it might make more difficult a right which they claim, but which we say they don't have in any event, which is restitution in kind, but we will come to a little later. But even if they had this right, again, what is the evidentiary basis here? We agree, no effort, no plan, no intention, no indication of any change in intention now or at any time in the future.\n\nMr. Rivkin's argument boils down to this, he used the words, just imagine, just imagine if President Chavez - living in Washington, we know why his name is invoked from time to time, but if President Chavez appeared and made a deal with President Correa, well, let's take that at face value. Just imagine is exactly what the Tribunal cannot do on a Request for Provisional Measures. The Tribunal cannot just imagine a harm that might theoretically happen. The Tribunal has to have some evidentiary basis for concluding an imminent, proximate likelihood - not certainty - likelihood of harm. Not a mere possibility.\n\nNow, the cases are very clear on this. I read from them. I not only cited, I quoted them in my remarks. They are in the transcript, and obviously you are free to confirm this, but there is a long line of authority before the court now on what are the standards for provisional measures. And mere possibility, imagined harm does not authorize the court, this Tribunal, or any other to issue a provisional measure.\"\n\n52.\n\nAs for the \"OCP pipeline\" request, the Respondent stated as follows: (see Respondent's Counter-Memorial at paragraph 107):\n\n\"107. In addition, the difficulties Claimants say they are experiencing as a result of their inability to meet the daily crude oil transport quota through the private OCP pipeline (of which Claimants claim to be shareholders), have nothing to do with the Participation Agreement or the rights in dispute, nor would these difficulties provoke damages incapable of redress through monetary damages. Accordingly, they cannot serve as the basis for the adoption of provisional measures, as has been demonstrated above. Moreover, Occidental del Ecuador Inc. received, as did the other shareholders of the OCP, an invitation from Petroecuador to negotiate the transport of crude from Block 15 through the pipeline on terms favorable to both parties, using the excess credits in each party's quota. As the Executive President of Petroecuador has testified, that possibility remains open, provided the two parties can agree on mutually agreeable terms.\" (footnote omitted)\n\n53.\n\nAt the hearing, the Respondent maintained its objection in principle to the \"OCP pipeline\" request. Its counsel said: (see Hearing Day 1 at pages 246-249):\n\n\"So, where does this take us? If the court were to grant Claimants' request and order Ecuador to designate that its oil must be credited against the pipeline capacity of OEPC, Petroecuador would be stripped of its right to designate and negotiate a lower price for the shipment of its oil, and would suffer economic losses in the form of higher tariff payments per barrel of oil that could amount to many millions of dollars.\n\nThe requested provisional measure would not only prejudice Petroecuador economically in this fashion, but it would also prejudice and cause economic losses to the four other pipeline shareholders not parties to these proceedings not here to defend themselves, whose current allocation of the shipped oil would be either be removed or at least reduced to accommodate OEPC's receipt of an allocation of 42,000 barrels a day.\n\n[\u2026]\n\nNow, the indication of this requested provisional measure would necessarily constitute, however unintentionally on the part of the Tribunal, it would necessarily constitute a prejudgment on the merits of the case. It's clear that OEPC could only be entitled to compensation, monetary compensation, of this nature from Ecuador for its payments to the OCP pipeline if it were to prevail on the merits of the case. Yet, in effect, the provisional measure requested by Claimants would award them this compensation now. Even worse, it would penalize Ecuador by obligating Petroecuador to pay a higher tariff on the oil it ships through the pipeline.\n\nAbsent an expropriation or breach of contract, there could be no justification whatsoever for penalizing Ecuador or Petroecuador in this manner. Accordingly, by imposing such a penalty at this time, the Tribunal would effectively be labeling or prejudging them as guilty parties. This is strictly inappropriate on provisional measures.\n\nNow, Ecuador is not averse to designating that Block 15's oil should be credited against OEPC's pipeline capacity in the right circumstances, meaning that an offer of its pipeline capacity by OEPC that provides the best terms, including the lowest tariff, would be well-received by Petroecuador. That is their position.\n\nThis is the business transaction.\n\n[\u2026]\n\nIn the end, this is still a situation where, as Claimants themselves admit, the only harm suffered by them is economic. They can be made whole by the payment of monetary compensation, and therefore, their injury is not irreparable. There is nothing about this case that justifies a departure from the well-established principle that provisional measures should not be indicated when the harm or threatened harm is not irreparable.\"\n\n54.\n\nFinally, in connection with the Respondent's dominion over Petroecuador, the Respondent concludes as follows (see Respondent's Counter-Memorial at paragraph 111):\n\n\"111. In any event, Respondent cannot order Petroecuador to put into practice measures such as those requested by Claimants without infringing its internal law. The provisions of the Legal-Administrative Statute for Executive Function *[Estatuto Juridico Administrativo de la Funcion Ejecutiva],* which Claimants invoke in paragraph 61 of the Request for Provisional Measures, do not support their conclusion, because those provisions exclusively concern the formulation of policies and the orientation of Petroecuador's plans and programs, not decisions on concrete situations, and though the Petroecuador Board members are Executive Branch officials and have been appointed by the President of the Republic, they are personally responsible and liable for their performance, and as such, are responsible for their own acts.\"\n\n**V. THE TRIBUNAL'S ANALYSIS**\n------------------------------\n\n**A. Authority to grant provisional measures and scope thereof**\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n55.\n\nWhilst the Tribunal need not definitely satisfy itself that it has jurisdiction in respect of the merits of the case at issue for purposes of ruling upon the requested provisional measures, it will not order such measures unless there is, *prima facie*, a basis upon which the Tribunal's jurisdiction might be established. In their Request for Arbitration, the Claimants invoke two such bases of jurisdiction: they state first that \"the parties consented to the submission of the dispute to the jurisdiction of the Centre on May 17, 2006, pursuant to Article VI(3) of the Treaty\" (see Claimants' Request for Arbitration at page 5); alternatively, the Claimants aver that they and the Respondent \"consented to the submission of the dispute to the jurisdiction of the Centre on May 21, 1999, pursuant to the Participation Contract\". They refer to clauses 20.2.1 and 20.3 thereof (see Claimants' Request for Arbitration at page 6).3*Prima facie* bases of jurisdiction, therefore, exist in the present case.\n\nIt is noted, however, that the Claimants' position was subsequently modified as they state in their Reply that \"[c]lause 20.3 of the Participation Contract is not the basis for the Tribunal's jurisdiction. As explained above, the Tribunal derives its jurisdiction exclusively from Article VI of the Treaty\" (see Claimants' Reply at paragraph 36)\n\n56.\n\nThe authority of the Tribunal to recommend provisional measures is governed by Article 47 of the ICSID Convention, which provides:\n\n\"**Article 47**\n\nExcept as the parties otherwise agree, the Tribunal may, if it considers that the circumstances so require, recommend any provisional measures which should be taken to preserve the respective rights of either party.\"\n\n57.\n\nProvisional measures are also addressed at ICSID Arbitration Rule 39:\n\n\"**Rule 39**\n\n**Provisional Measures**\n\n(1) At any time after the institution of the proceeding, a party may request that provisional measures for the preservation of its rights be recommended by the Tribunal. The request shall specify the rights to be preserved, the measures the recommendation of which is requested, and the circumstances that require such measures.\n\n(2) The Tribunal shall give priority to the consideration of a request made pursuant to paragraph (1).\n\n(3) The Tribunal may also recommend provisional measures on its own initiative or recommend measures other than those specified in a request. It may at any time modify or revoke its recommendations.\n\n(4) The Tribunal shall only recommend provisional measures, or modify or revoke its recommendations, after giving each party an opportunity of presenting its observations.\n\n(5) If a party makes a request pursuant to paragraph (1) before the constitution of the Tribunal, the Secretary-General shall, on the application of either party, fix time limits for the parties to present observations on the request, so that the request and observations may be considered by the Tribunal promptly upon its constitution.\n\n(6) Nothing in this Rule shall prevent the parties, provided that they have so stipulated in the agreement recording their consent, from requesting any judicial or other authority to order provisional measures, prior to or after the institution of the proceeding, for the preservation of their respective rights and interests.\"\n\n58.\n\nThe Tribunal wishes to make clear for the avoidance of doubt that, although Article 47 of the ICSID Convention uses the word \"recommend\", the Tribunal is, in fact, empowered to order provisional measures. This has been recognized by numerous international tribunals, among them the ICSID tribunal in the *Tokios Tokeles* case. The tribunal stated:\n\n\"It is to be recalled that, according to a well-established principle laid down by the jurisprudence of the ICSID tribunals, provisional measures 'recommended' by an ICSID tribunal are legally compulsory; they are in effect 'ordered' by the tribunal, and the parties are under a legal obligation to comply with them.\"4\n\n*Tokios Tokeles v. Ukraine*, ICSID Case No. ARB/02/18, Procedural Order No. 1 dated 1 July 2003 at paragraph 4.\n\n59.\n\nIt is also well established that provisional measures should only be granted in situations of necessity and urgency in order to protect rights that could, absent such measures, be definitely lost. It is not contested that provisional measures are extraordinary measures which should not be recommended lightly. In other words, the circumstances under which provisional measures are required under Article 47 of the ICSID Convention are those in which the measures are necessary to preserve a party's rights and where the need is urgent in order to avoid irreparable harm. The jurisprudence of the International Court of Justice dealing with provisional measures is well established: a provisional measure is necessary where the actions of a party \"are capable of causing or of threatening irreparable prejudice to the rights invoked\".5 A measure is urgent where \"action prejudicial to the rights of either party is likely to be taken before such final decision is given\".6\n\n*Aegean Sea Continental Shelf Case (Greece v. Turkey)*, Request for the Indication of Interim Measures of Protection, Order dated 11 September 1976, Separate Opinion of President Jimenez de Arechaga, 1976 *I.C.J. Rep.* 3 at page 11.\n\n*Case Concerning Passage Through the Great Belt (Finland v. Denmark)*, Request for the Indication of Provisional Measures, Order dated 29 July 1991, 1991 *I.C.J. Rep.* 12 at page 17.\n\n60.\n\nThe Tribunal also emphasizes that the purpose of provisional measures is to guarantee the protection of rights whose existence might be jeopardized in the absence of such measures. The ICSID tribunal in the *Maffezini* case elaborated on the meaning of an \"existing right\":\n\n\"12. Rule 39(1) specifies that a party may request '. provisional measures for the preservation of its rights.'\n\n13. The use of the present tense implies that such rights must exist at the time of the request, must nor be hypothetical, nor are ones to be created in the future.\n\n14. An example of an existing right would be an interest in a piece of property, the ownership of which is in dispute. A provisional measure could be ordered to require that the property not be sold or alienated before the final award of the arbitral tribunal. Such an order would preserve the *status quo* of the property, thus preserving the rights of the party in the property.\"7\n\n*Maffezini v. Spain*, ICSID Case No. ARB/97/7, Procedural Order No. 2 dated 28 October 1999 at paragraphs 12-14.\n\n61.\n\nIn other words, in order for an international tribunal to grant provisional measures, there must exist both a right to be preserved and circumstances of necessity and urgency to avoid irreparable harm. The Tribunal will thus examine, first, the alleged existence of rights of the Claimants deserving of protection and, second, the alleged existence of a situation of necessity and urgency relative to these rights.\n\n62.\n\nThe rights to be preserved in the present case, according to the Claimants, are twofold: firstly, their right to specific performance, in other words their \"exclusive right to carry out exploration and exploitation activities on Block 15\" (see Claimants' Request for Arbitration at paragraph 77), a right which their \"third-party transfer notice\" request is designed to protect; secondly, their right to \"prevent further aggravation of the dispute\" (see Claimants' Application at paragraph 84), a right which their \"OPC pipeline\" request seeks to protect.\n\n**B. Clarification on the \"rights\" that can be protected by way of provisional measures**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n63.\n\nAs a further preliminary observation, the Tribunal wishes to make clear that although a right may not yet have been recognized by the Tribunal, such a right may nonetheless be deserving of protection by way of provisional measures. The Tribunal therefore does not agree with the Respondent's contention that \"the presumption of success or failure on the merits is pure speculation and does not provide a sufficient basis to support an actual existing right\" (see Respondent's Counter-Memorial at paragraph 45).8 Rather, the Claimants at this stage \"need only show that they allege the kind of claims that - if ultimately proven - would entitle Claimants to substantial relief\u2019 (see Claimants' Application at paragraph 15). The Respondent's position would have far reaching consequences. It would mean, for example, that a tribunal could never order protection by way of provisional measures in connection with a right whose existence and alleged violation are precisely the subject-matter of the arbitration.\n\nThe Respondent cites, in this regard, *Maffezini v. Spain*, ICSID Case No. ARB/97/7, Procedural Order No. 2 dated 28 October 1999: \"Expectations of success or failure in an arbitration or judicial case are mere conjectures\" (at paragraph 20).\n\n64.\n\nAt this stage, the Tribunal reiterates that the right to be preserved only has to be asserted as a theoretically existing right, as opposed to proven to exist in fact. The Tribunal, at the provisional measures stage, will only deal with the nature of the right claimed, not with its existence or the merits of the allegations of its violation. This approach was adopted by the ICSID tribunal in *Victor Pey Casado v. Chile* where, in its long and thoughtful decision on a request for provisional measures, it stated:\n\n\"For its part, the Tribunal can neither prejudge nor even, to put it correctly, assume in an anticipatory fashion'. [\u2026] It must therefore reason, at this preliminary stage of the arbitration process, on the basis not of 'assumptions' but of *hypotheses*, in particular that by which it may come to recognise its own jurisdiction on the substance of the case, and in such a case, the hypothesis whereby the rights that the decision may recognise for one or the other of the parties in question could be placed in danger or compromised by the *absence* of provisional measures.\"9 (emphasis in original)\n\nICSID Case No. ARB/98/2, Decision dated 25 September 2001 at paragraph 46.\n\n65.\n\nWhat is meant by a theoretically existing right? Clearly, the facts must show an actual right or legally protected interest, by opposition to a simple interest which does not entail legal protection. This right or legally protected interest must also potentially form part of the Claimants' individual rights and obligations. Thus, the Tribunal must first determine whether or not the Claimants can theoretically invoke the rights whose protection they now seek. As was seen earlier, those rights are, first, their alleged right to specific performance of their Block 15 contracts and, second, their alleged right to the non aggravation of the dispute.\n\n**C. The alleged right to specific performance**\n------------------------------------------------\n\n66.\n\nThe Tribunal will first consider whether \"the exclusive right to carry out exploration and exploitation activities on Block 15\" as claimed by the Claimants theoretically exists. The Tribunal recalls that the Claimants consider that they have a right of restitution in the form of reinstatement of their acquired rights derived from the Participation Contract and the Operating Agreements. In other words, the Claimants are seeking to be restored in their oil concession.\n\n67.\n\nThe totality of the provisional measures initially requested by the Claimants were predicated on the assumption that the Claimants possess a right to specific performance of their Block 15 contracts, given that the requested provisional measures were all intended to protect such a right. It is still on the basis of this alleged right to specific performance that the Claimants submit their \"third-party transfer notice\" request, which is one of their two remaining requests.\n\n68.\n\nAt this juncture, the Tribunal further notes that while the Claimants have repeatedly expressed their fear that the Ecuadorian Government may enter into a contract for the exploration and exploitation of Block 15 with another company, the provisional relief they seek in this regard has evolved over time. At first, the Claimants asked the Tribunal to \"enjoin Respondents from entering into a contract with another party\" (see Claimants' Request for Arbitration at paragraph 77). In their Application, the Claimants requested an order from the Tribunal directing the Respondent \"to refrain from entering into or approving any agreements with third parties for the operation of Block 15 pending the outcome of this arbitration\" (see Claimants' Application at paragraph 92). In their Reply, they were still asking for \"[a]n order requiring Respondent to refrain from entering into or approving agreements with third parties for the operation of Block 15\" (see Claimants' Reply at paragraph 53). It is only during the hearing that this requested measure was modified and became a request that the Tribunal order the Respondent to give the Tribunal and the Claimants advance notice of no less than sixty days before entering into any contractual arrangement with a third party for the operation of Block 15.10 But regardless of its evolution, the Claimants' Application proceeds on the basis that a right to specific performance exists. The Tribunal must therefore determine whether in this respect the Application is well founded. In other words, have the Claimants established that they have a strongly arguable right to the specific performance which they seek.\n\nThis request was reiterated by the Claimants in their letter to the Tribunal of 26 July 2007.\n\n***1. Linguistic clarification***\n---------------------------------\n\n69.\n\nAt the outset, the Tribunal feels compelled to clarify an issue of vocabulary. To date, in their pleadings and during the hearing, the parties have played and interplayed with, and sometimes confused, the words and expressions \"restitution\", \"*restitutio in integrum*\", \"restitution in kind\" and \"specific performance\".\n\n70.\n\nThe Respondent has argued that the \"Claimants conflate a 'right to restitution' with a right of specific performance. They are not the same. Specific performance is but one form of restitution\" (see Respondent's Rejoinder at paragraph 16). Some paragraphs later in its Rejoinder, the Respondent commented that \"[i]n *LIAMCO*, the investor's principal claim was for restitution in kind ('restitutio in integrum') [\u2026]. The arbitrator rejected LIAMCO's claimed right to specific performance of the concession agreement [...]\" (see Respondent's Rejoinder at paragraph 19). Based on these two passages from the Respondent's submissions, the Respondent appears to argue that restitution is the relief to be obtained, either through, on the one hand, an action indifferently called restitution in kind, \"*restitutio in integrum*\" or specific performance or, on the other hand, compensation.\n\n71.\n\nHowever, elsewhere in its submissions, the Respondent assimilates the relief of restitution with \"*restitutio in integrum*\" and, indeed, the Respondent's reliance on the definition of \"*restitutio in integrum*\", as given by Lauterpacht implies this assimilation. Lauterpacht's definition reads as follows: \"That principle means that the injured person is placed in the position he occupied before the occurrence of the injurious act or omission; it means that [\u2026] not only the *damnum emergens* but also the *lucrum cessans* is taken into consideration\"11(see Respondent's Rejoinder at paragraph 24). Here, the relief sought is *restitutio in integrum* and it can be obtained by compensation encompassing *damnum emergens* and *lucrum cessans*. It appears that *restitutio in integrum* is assimilated here to what was first called restitution.\n\n*Private Law Sources and Analogies of International Law* (1927) at page 147.\n\n72.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, it is not very helpful to use the specific expression of \"restitution\", whether it is distinguished from *restitutio in integrum* or assimilated to it, given the confusion it creates. However, this is not the end of the Tribunal's reasoning, as the expression \"*restitutio in integrum*\" does not have an unequivocal utilisation in the international sphere: indeed, the two different meanings used by the Respondent, as underscored above, are but one example of the dual use of this expression in international doctrine and jurisprudence. *Restitutio in integrum* is in fact sometimes used as meaning full reparation, and sometimes used as meaning restitution in kind.\n\n73.\n\nAccordingly, the Tribunal prefers to proceed on the basis of the principle that a party injured by an illegal act must be made whole, and that the relief is full reparation, rather than \"restitution\", or \"*restitutio in integrum*\", even if full reparation is sometimes labelled *restitutio in integrum*. Full reparation can be achieved through restitution in kind - synonymous with specific performance - but if restitution in kind is not possible, then it can be achieved through monetary compensation corresponding to the value which restitution in kind would carry. Although it is the Tribunal's view that the expression \"*restitutio in integrum*\" should, strictly speaking, be reserved to making an injured party whole, and that the expressions \"restitution in kind\" and \"specific performance\" should be used solely to designate one of the modalities of reparation (compensation being the other), this is not the manner in which these expressions are uniformly used, and this is a source of difficulty. As will be seen later, the Claimants' position rests precisely on a confusion between *restitutio in integrum,* which is an obligation of result - to which they could indeed be entitled, and restitution in kind, which is an obligation of means - to which they are not entitled.\n\n74.\n\nIn conclusion, since *restitutio in integrum* is used sometimes synonymously with full reparation and sometimes - and in fact more frequently - with restitution in kind,12 the Tribunal, in the circumstances, will use the expression \"specific performance\" in relation to the Claimants' request for the reinstatement of their acquired rights in Block 15, unless of course a reference is made to the submissions of the parties or international decisions using the expression \"*restitutio in integrum*\" in either one of the two possible meanings.\n\nThis is, indeed, the most common approach. For example, in the ICSID case of *Victor Pey Casado v. Chile*, *supra*, the tribunal addressed the consequence of a finding of an illegal act committed by Chile and stated that it \"could only be either to return the shares sought to their legitimate owners (that is to say restitution in kind) or, in the case of impossibility of *restitutio in integrum*, the obligation to compensate\" (at paragraph 63). In other words, in this sentence there is an assimilation between restitution (of the actions), *restitutio in integrum*, and restitution in kind (*restitution en nature*).\n\n***2. The Claimants have not established, at this stage, a strongly arguable right to specific performance***\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n75.\n\nThe Claimants have not contended that specific performance is the unique, absolute and compulsory remedy in international law where there has been an illegal act causing damages. In fact, they recognize that specific performance is merely the \"preferred remedy\" (see*e.g.* Claimants' Reply at paragraph 10, paragraph 12 and paragraphs 29-30), or the \"primary remedy\" (see*e.g.* Claimants' Reply at paragraph 14), or the \"normal remedy\" (see*e.g.* Claimants' Reply at paragraph 13) and that it can only be granted where possible. Specific performance is, of course, a conditional right, as it is precisely conditioned on the possibility of performance, and consequently hindered by its impossibility. Restitution in kind is never guaranteed to an injured claimant. Whether restitution in kind is possible or impossible must necessarily and logically be ascertained when a tribunal is seized of the matter. At that point, it is not disputed that for purposes of making an injured claimant whole, specific performance should be granted to it, unless impossible or disproportionate when compared to compensation. In other words, in the event of injury suffered as a result of an illegal act, the injured claimant has a right to specific performance unless specific performance is impossible. It does not mean that the injured claimant has a right to obtain specific performance from a tribunal. Yet, this is precisely what the Claimants are seeking, as noted for example in their Request for Arbitration (see Claimants' Request for Arbitration at paragraph 76):\n\n\"Unless Respondents are immediately ordered to cease or refrain from such actions and to return OEPC to its rightful operation and exploitation of Block 15, they will render the consequences of Respondents' breaches irreversible and the relief of *restitutio in integrum* sought by Claimants in this arbitration impossible.\" (emphasis added)\n\n76.\n\nTherefore, what the Tribunal must ascertain is whether the specific performance requested by the Claimants is possible or impossible in the circumstances of this case.\n\n77.\n\nIf property has been destroyed, for example, it is quite clear that restitution in kind is impossible. The issue becomes more complicated where the alleged illegal act has put an end to a legal situation, such as a license or a contract. When can it be said that restitution in kind, *i.e.* specific performance, of rights stemming from a legal situation existing before the alleged illegal act was committed is impossible?\n\n78.\n\nThe Claimants consider that specific performance is not impossible in cases such as the one at issue where the claim is based on termination of a natural resources concession by a State. They assert that \"restitution in kind is a valid international law remedy\" to recover a concession, license or other property unlawfully expropriated by the State (see Claimants' Reply at paragraph 24). Yet, the Tribunal is not aware of any case where an ICSID tribunal has granted the kind of specific performance against a State that the Claimants seek in the present arbitration. However, and of course, this is not a sufficient reason to refuse such remedy. As stated by the ICSID tribunal in the *Maffezini* case, \"the lack of precedent is not necessarily determinative of our competence to order provisional measures in a case where such measures fall within the purview of the Arbitration Rules and are required under the circumstances\".13 In its Rejoinder, the Respondent says that \"Claimants are asking the Tribunal to make international legal history\" (see Respondent's Rejoinder at paragraph 1). Naturally, this Tribunal would not shy away from making legal history if it reached a conclusion that was legally well founded. But, in the Tribunal's view, the conclusions sought by the Claimants, in the present case, are not legally well founded.\n\n*Maffezini v. Spain, supra* at paragraph 5. See also *Tokios Tokeles v. Ukraine,* ICSID Case No. ARB/02/08, Procedural Order No. 3 dated 18 January 2005, where the ICSID tribunal stated that \"Respondent is [\u2026] incorrect when it argues that a request for provisional measures must be supported by precedent in ICSID jurisprudence\" (at paragraph 11).\n\n79.\n\nIt is well established that where a State has, in the exercise of its sovereign powers, put an end to a contract or a license, or any other foreign investor's entitlement, specific performance must be deemed legally impossible. The Tribunal recognizes that one international arbitrator in the *Texaco v. Libya* case granted such specific performance - under the name of *restitutio in integrum* - in the context of a nationalization, but that case is both unique and fact specific. Indeed, the arbitrator in that case insisted on the fact that specific performance could not be considered impossible because the respondent State had not presented itself before the tribunal in order to provide information regarding the impossibility of specific performance:\n\n\"[T]he Tribunal does not lose sight of the consideration that the solution in principle which is constituted by restitutio in integrum should be disregarded when there is absolute impossibility of envisaging specific performance, or when an irreversible situation has been created. This does not seem, at least until further information is available, to be the case here [...]. [...] The Tribunal must note that only the defendant could have been in a position to bring forward information tending to establish that there was an absolute impossibility, beyond its control, that eliminated the possibility of restoring things to the previous state, and the Tribunal can only regret, once again, the default in which the defendant seems to have thought it necessary to take shelter.\"14\n\n*Texaco Overseas Petroleum Co. & California Asiatic Oil Co. v. Libyan Arab Republic*, 17 I.L.M. 1 (1978) at paragraph 112.\n\n80.\n\nIn two other Libyan cases, *restitutio in integrum* was also used as meaning specific performance or restitution in kind. In both instances, this relief was not granted. The tribunals reasoned that such a remedy of specific performance was impossible in the context of a nationalization. In the case of *LIAMCO v. Libya*, the arbitrator cited V.S. Friedman's 1953 treatise entitled *Expropriation in International Law* : \"[I]t is impossible to compel a State to make restitution, this would constitute in fact an intolerable interference in the internal sovereignty of States\".15 The arbitrator concluded that LIAMCO's demands concerning the remedy of *restitutio in integrum* is \"not legally founded and should be rejected\".16 In the *BP v. Libya* case, the arbitrator's analysis and conclusions were the same:\n\n\"A rule of reason therefore dictates a result which conforms both to international law, as evidenced by State practice and the law of treaties, and to the governing principle of English and American contract law. This is that, when by the exercise of sovereign power a State has committed a fundamental breach of a concession agreement by repudiating it through a nationalization of the enterprise and its assets in a manner which implies finality, the concessionaire is not entitled to call for specific performance by the Government of the agreement and reinstatement of his contractual rights, but his sole remedy is an action for damages.\"17\n\n*Libya American Oil Company (LIAMCO) v. Libyan Arab Republic*, 20 I.L.M. 1 (1981) at page 63. The same citation was made by the Respondent (see Respondent's Counter-Memorial at paragraph 23).\n\n*Ibid.* at page 65.\n\n*BP Exploration Company (Libya) Limited v. Libyan Arab Republic,* 52 I.L.R. 297 (1974) at page 354.\n\n81.\n\nIn the more recent ICSID case of *CMS Gas Transmission v. Argentine*, while the Tribunal recognized that \"[r]estitution is by far the most reliable choice to make the injured party whole as it aims at the reestablishment of the situation existing prior to the wrongful act\", it concluded that \"it would be utterly unrealistic for the Tribunal to order to turn back to the regulatory framework existing before the emergency measures were adopted\".18\n\n*CMS Gas Transmission Company v. Argentine*, ICSID Case No. ARB/01/8, Award dated 12 May 2005 at paragraph 406.\n\n82.\n\nBut specific performance must not only be possible in order to be granted to a claimant. Specific performance, even if possible, will nevertheless be refused if it imposes too heavy a burden on the party against whom it is directed. Article 35 of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility is worthy of mention in this regard:\n\n\"*Article 35*\n\n*Restitution*\n\nA State responsible for an internationally wrongful act is under an obligation to make restitution, that is, to re-establish the situation, which existed before the wrongful act was committed, provided and to the extent that restitution:\n\n(*a*) Is not materially impossible;\n\n(*b*) Does not involve a burden out of proportion to the benefits deriving from restitution instead of compensation.\"\n\n83.\n\nThis point was well exposed in the *CMS* case, where the tribunal stated the following:\n\n\"Restitution is the standard used to reestablish the situation which existed before the wrongful act was committed, provided this is not materially impossible and does not result in a burden out of proportion as compared to compensation.\"19 (citation omitted)\n\n*Ibid*. at paragraph 400.\n\n84.\n\nThe second requirement can be summarized as follows. In order to decide whether specific performance is possible, the Tribunal must consider both the Claimants' and the Respondent's rights. To impose on a sovereign State reinstatement of a foreign investor in its concession, after a nationalization or termination of a concession license or contract by the State, would constitute a reparation disproportional to its interference with the sovereignty of the State when compared to monetary compensation.\n\n85.\n\nLegal commentators have also expressed the conclusion that it is impossible to oblige a State to reinstate a foreign investor in a concession terminated by the State. Oscar Schachter, for example, has commented that \"[a]lthough the duty to re-establish the situation that existed prior to the violation is required in principle, there may be reasons of a material and social character that make it 'impossible' or 'impracticable' for the offending State to restore the situation to its prior state\".20 The adequate remedy where an internationally illegal act has been committed is compensation deemed to be equivalent with restitution in kind. Such a solution strikes the required balance between the need to protect the foreign investor's rights and the right of the host State to claim control over its natural resources.\n\nOscar Schachter, *International Law in Theory and in Practice*, 178 *Collected Courses (Academy of International Law)* 188 (1982) at 190.\n\n86.\n\nIn conclusion, it is the Tribunal's view that the Claimants have not established a strongly arguable case that there exists a right to specific performance where a natural resources concession agreement has been terminated or cancelled by a sovereign State. The view of the Tribunal at this stage of the proceedings is that no such right exists. As a result, the Claimants have failed to establish that it would be appropriate for the Tribunal to grant a provisional measure such as the one sought by the Claimants pursuant to their \"third-party notice\" request.\n\n***3. In any case, there is no necessity nor urgency to grant the measure sought in order to avoid imminent and irreparable harm***\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n87.\n\nAn order for provisional measures will only be made where such measures are found to be necessary and urgent in order to avoid imminent and irreparable harm. The Tribunal is convinced by the evidence that even if the right to specific performance had existed, there is no imminent plan on the part of the Ecuadorian Government to hand over Block 15 and hence no risk of irreparable harm.\n\n***(a) There is no necessity or urgency***\n------------------------------------------\n\n88.\n\nIn their Application, the Claimants proceeded on the assumption that Ecuador was \"threatening to commit Block 15 to other companies\" (see Claimants' Application at paragraph 4, as well as paragraphs 50 and following). But, as recognized by the Claimants' themselves, \"[a]t present, Claimants do not know what course of action Ecuador intends to take with respect to the future operator of Block 15\" (see Claimants' Application at paragraph 54). In their Application, the Claimants refer to a vague undertaking of the Government of Ecuador in this connection. They wrote (see Claimants' Application at paragraph 53):\n\n\"However, on August 15, after announcing that a separate state-owned company would operate Block 15, the Foreign Ministry and the Indonesian Embassy in Ecuador announced that they had signed an agreement on August 2 for the Indonesian state-owned oil company, PT Pertamina, to develop operations in an unidentified petroleum area in Ecuador in cooperation with Petroecuador.\" (emphasis added)\n\n89.\n\nIn other words, the Claimants are seeking a provisional measure in order to prevent an action which they are not even sure is being planned. This is not the purpose of a provisional measure. Provisional measures are not meant to protect against any potential or hypothetical harm susceptible to result from uncertain actions. Rather, they are meant to protect the requesting party from imminent harm.\n\n90.\n\nIn the view of the Tribunal, the harm that the Claimants seek to be protected against is even more hypothetical today given the Ecuadorian Government's repeated assertions at the hearing that no imminent project exists to hand over Block 15 to a third company. And while it was repeatedly represented to the Tribunal during the hearing that Ecuador had no intention to cede Block 15 to another company, the Tribunal for the purposes of this decision need only quote the very clear and emphatic statement by counsel for the Ecuadorian Government: \"[T]here is no plan, there is no intention, there is no indication of a likelihood of change of intention regarding the non transfer of Block 15. [\u2026] We agree, no effort, no plan, no intention, no indication of any change of intention now or at any time in the future\" (see Hearing Day 2 at page 388).21 The burden rested on the Claimants to make out their case of urgent necessity. They have failed to do so.\n\nSee also*e.g.* the witness statement of Mr. Wilson Pastor Morris (General Manager of Block 15) dated 18 April 2007, stating as follows (at paragraph 34): \"There are no plans to cede or transfer Block 15 to any other party. No consideration has ever been given to any such cession or transfer by Petroecuador, Petroproduccion or the Block 15 Unit.\"\n\n91.\n\nThe Tribunal therefore concludes that there is no imminent danger of harm, and not even an imminent likelihood of harm, justifying the Claimants' request for advance notice in the event the Ecuadorian Government decided to enter into a contract with a third party for the exploration and exploitation of Block 15.\n\n***(b) There is no risk of irreparable harm***\n----------------------------------------------\n\n92.\n\nMoreover, the Tribunal can see no irreparable harm to the rights of the Claimants even if the Respondent did enter into such a contract. Any prejudice suffered as a result of the termination of the Block 15 contracts, if subsequently found illegal by the Tribunal, can readily be compensated by a monetary award.\n\n93.\n\nFinally, the Tribunal notes that provisional measures may not be awarded for the protection of the rights of one party where such provisional measures would cause irreparable harm to the rights of the other party, in this case, the rights of a sovereign State. Even if a right to be reinstated in the Block 15 concession were to exist, it would only exist in the event that the termination of the concession contract was found to have been illegal. Absent such a finding, the Respondent has the right to control and operate Block 15 as it deems fit, and a provisional measure obliging Ecuador to give prior notice in the event it decides to enter into a new contract would infringe on its sovereign rights to dispose freely of its lawfully held property. Such a provisional measure would contravene the well-established rule that provisional measures must \"preserve the respective rights of either party\" (Article 47 of the ICSID Convention). This rule is acknowledged by the Claimants in their Application where they state that \"[i]t is settled law that provisional measures are appropriate when 'action prejudicial to the rights of either party is likely to be taken before [a] final decision is given\" (see Claimants' Application at paragraph 31, emphasis added).22\n\nCiting the *Case Concerning Passage Through the Great Belt, supra* at paragraph 23; *Tokios Tokeles v. Ukraine,* ICSID Case No. ARB/02/18, Procedural Order No. 3 dated 18 January 2005 at paragraph 8 (quoting the *Great Belt* case, *supra*), as well as *Biwater Gauff (Tanzania) Ltd. v. Tanzania*, ICSID Case No. ARB/05/22, Procedural Order No. 1 dated 31 March 2006 at paragraph 76.\n\n94.\n\nFor all these reasons, the Claimants' \"third-party transfer notice\" request as amended, asking the Tribunal to order the Ecuadorian State \"[t]o give, and to cause Petroecuador to give, the Tribunal and Claimants advance notice of no less than sixty days before entering into any contractual arrangement with a third party for the operation of Block 15 and the Unified Fields\" is denied by the Tribunal.\n\n**D. The alleged right to non aggravation of the dispute**\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n95.\n\nThe \"OCP pipeline\" request is made by the Claimants for the purpose of preventing aggravation of the dispute. In this regard, the Tribunal recalls that the financing of the OCP pipeline was to be secured through the signing of ship-or-pay commitments by the foreign oil companies participating in the OCP project. On 30 January 2001, OEPC entered into an Initial Shipper Transportation Agreement and accepted ship-or-pay commitments relating to Block 15. These commitments required OEPC either to ship 70,000 barrels per day or to pay the tariffs for unused capacity. OEPC therefore owes approximately $100,000 per day in tariff payments to OCP S.A. for Block 15 reserved capacity despite the fact that, due to the expropriation, it is not shipping any oil on the pipeline. As the Claimants are no longer in a position to ship oil from Block 15, they have to fulfill their obligation to pay for unused capacity. For this reason, they request from the Tribunal an order requiring the Respondent to ensure that the percentage of oil shipped from Block 15 and corresponding to the Claimants' participation be credited to OEPC's capacity.\n\n***1. The existence in international law of a right to non aggravation of the dispute***\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n96.\n\nIt is not contested that provisional measures can be granted in order to avoid aggravation of a dispute, and international tribunals have often done so. This general principle has been invoked by the tribunal in the following terms in the ICSID case of *Victor Pey Casado v. Chile:*\n\n\"It relates to the general principle, frequently affirmed in international case-law, whether judicial or arbitration proceedings are in question, according to which each party to a case is obliged to abstain from every act or omission likely to aggravate the case or to render the execution of the judgment more difficult'.\"23\n\n*Supra* at page 593.\n\n97.\n\nHowever, provisional measures, when granted as measures required to prevent aggravation of the dispute, have always been directed at the behavior of the parties to the dispute, whether they consisted of measures required to maintain - or restore - peace between them, or to prevent one party from initiating or pursuing parallel litigation, for example in the national courts, thereby directly undermining the international proceedings. Provisional measures are not designed to merely mitigate the final amount of damages. Indeed, if they were so intended, provisional measures would be available to a claimant in almost every case. In any situation resulting from an illegal act, the mere passage of time aggravates the damages that can be ultimately granted and it is well known that this is not a sufficient basis for ordering provisional measures.\n\n***2. The requested provisional measure does not guarantee non aggravation of the dispute***\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n98.\n\nAlthough there exists a general right to non aggravation of the dispute, in the instant case, the purpose of the \"OCP pipeline\" request, in the view of the Tribunal, is not to avoid aggravation of the dispute *per se*, but rather aggravation of the monetary damages resulting from an already existing dispute. In their Application, the Claimants accept that \"[p]urely economic loss readily compensable by money damages typically does not warrant provisional measures\" (see Claimants' Application at paragraph 89). The Respondent makes the same point by emphasizing that \"[i]t is axiomatic that injury is not irreparable if the injured party can be made whole by money damages\" (see Respondent's Rejoinder at paragraph 6; see also Respondent's Counter-Memorial at paragraph 5). It is quite clear that the Claimants, at this stage of the proceedings, are merely seeking to reduce the amount of money they will request as damages at the conclusion of these proceedings, as evidenced by their own submissions. In their Application, the Claimants explain that this measure is requested because the existing situation \"unnecessarily cause[s] Claimants prospectively to incur additional but avoidable damages\" (see Claimants' Application at paragraph 32) and, in their Reply, they insist on the fact that this measure is \"required to reduce an ever-increasing form of damages\" (see Claimants' Reply at paragraph 84). As the \"OCP pipeline\" request is not directed at the non aggravation of the dispute, but merely at the non increase of alleged damages, it is not a provisional measure that the Tribunal can order.\n\n99.\n\nThe harm in this case is only \"more damages\", and this is harm of a type which can be compensated by monetary compensation, so there is neither necessity nor urgency to grant a provisional measure to prevent such harm. In any event, the Tribunal finds it difficult to see how the non order of the \"OCP pipeline\" measure would render the existing dispute more difficult to resolve.\n\n100.\n\nFor all these reasons, the Tribunal therefore rejects what amounts to a claim for mitigation of damages, and more precisely denies the Claimants' \"OCP pipeline\" request \"[t]o cause Petroecuador to enter into a contractual arrangement with OEPC for the shipment of 42,000 barrels per day of crude on OEPC's unused reserved capacity on the OCP at a tariff of US$1.46 per barrel\".\n\n**VI. ORDER**\n-------------\n\n101.\n\nFor the reasons set forth herein, the Tribunal finds, unanimously, after having reviewed the parties' respective arguments as presented both in writing and orally, that the Claimants' case, at this juncture of the proceedings, does not warrant the grant of the measures they seek. In summary, the Claimants have failed to demonstrate that an order for provisional measures is justified in the circumstances. Accordingly, the Tribunal hereby rejects the Claimants' amended Application.\n\n102.\n\nThis Decision is without prejudice to all substantive issues in dispute and should not be considered as prejudging any issue of fact or law concerning jurisdiction or the merits of this case.\n\n103.\n\nThere shall be no order as to costs at this stage of the proceedings."}, {"Title": "Decision on Jurisdiction", "Type": "Jurisdiction", "Date": "2008-09-09T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Decision on Jurisdiction\n------------------------\n\n**I. INTRODUCTION**\n-------------------\n\n1.\n\nIn this Decision on Jurisdiction, the Tribunal addresses and rules upon objections put forward by the Respondent regarding the Tribunal's jurisdiction over the Claimants' claims in this ICSID proceeding.\n\n2.\n\nThe Tribunal notes at the outset that the Respondent's jurisdictional objections have been submitted in accordance with Rule 41 of ICSID's Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings (Arbitration Rules). Rule 41 reads as follows:\n\n\"**Rule 41**\n\n**Preliminary Objections**\n\n(1) Any objection that the dispute or any ancillary claim is not within the jurisdiction of the Centre or, for other reasons, is not within the competence of the Tribunal shall be made as early as possible. A party shall file the objection with the Secretary-General no later than the expiration of the time limit fixed for the filing of the counter-memorial, or, if the objection relates to an ancillary claim, for the filing of the rejoinder\u2014unless the facts on which the objection is based are unknown to the party at that time.\n\n(2) The Tribunal may on its own initiative consider, at any stage of the proceeding, whether the dispute or any ancillary claim before it is within the jurisdiction of the Centre and within its own competence.\n\n(3) Upon the formal raising of an objection relating to the dispute, the Tribunal may decide to suspend the proceeding on the merits. The President of the Tribunal, after consultation with its other members, shall fix a time limit within which the parties may file observations on the objection.\n\n(4) The Tribunal shall decide whether or not the further procedures relating to the objection made pursuant to paragraph (1) shall be oral. It may deal with the objection as a preliminary question or join it to the merits of the dispute. If the Tribunal overrules the objection or joins it to the merits, it shall once more fix time limits for the further procedures.\n\n(5) Unless the parties have agreed to another expedited procedure for making preliminary objections, a party may, no later than 30 days after the constitution of the Tribunal, and in any event before the first session of the Tribunal, file an objection that a claim is manifestly without legal merit. The party shall specify as precisely as possible the basis for the objection. The Tribunal, after giving the parties the opportunity to present their observations on the objection, shall, at its first session or promptly thereafter, notify the parties of its decision on the objection. The decision of the Tribunal shall be without prejudice to the right of a party to file an objection pursuant to paragraph (1) or to object, in the course of the proceeding, that a claim lacks legal merit.\n\n(6) If the Tribunal decides that the dispute is not within the jurisdiction of the Centre or not within its own competence, or that all claims are manifestly without legal merit, it shall render an award to that effect.\"\n\n3.\n\nThe Tribunal recalls that this ICSID proceeding was initiated on 17 May 2006 by the Claimants, Occidental Petroleum Corporation (\"OPC\") and Occidental Exploration and Production Company (\"OEPC\"), with the filing of a Request for Arbitration against the Respondent, the Republic of Ecuador.1\n\nThe Request was initially directed against both Ecuador and the Ecuadorian entity known as \"Petroecuador\", but the Claimants subsequently abandoned their claims against Petroecuador.\n\n4.\n\nThe Tribunal held its First Session with the parties on 2 May 2007. In the Minutes of the First Session, it was contemplated, *inter alia*, that objection(s) by the Respondent to the Tribunal's jurisdiction, if any, were to be made by no later than 15 September 2007.2\n\nSee revised Minutes of the First Session at paragraph 16(2).\n\n5.\n\nA request for a postponement of this deadline, however, was subsequently made on behalf of the Respondent who changed its counsel. The process of appointing new counsel was in fact a time-consuming one, with new counsel's formal appointment only confirmed in late December 2007. In the fullness of time, on 11 February 2008, the Tribunal issued its first Procedural Order directing a revised procedural calendar, including a timetable for the jurisdictional phase of this proceeding.\n\n6.\n\nPursuant to the Tribunal's Procedural Order No. 1, the parties' pleadings in this jurisdictional phase were submitted as follows:\n\n\u2022 Respondent's Objections to Jurisdiction dated 7 March 2008;\n\n\u2022 Claimants' Answer on Jurisdiction dated 4 April 2008;\n\n\u2022 Respondent's Reply on Jurisdiction dated 23 April 2008; and\n\n\u2022 Claimants' Rejoinder on Jurisdiction dated 12 May 2008.\n\n7.\n\nAs directed by the Tribunal's Procedural Order No. 1, a two-day Hearing on Jurisdiction was held in Paris on 22-23 May 2008 (the \"Hearing\").\n\n8.\n\nDuring the Hearing, the Tribunal heard from the parties' respective counsel who made extensive opening and closing submissions on the various issues raised by the Respondent's jurisdictional challenge. The parties' experts, namely Dr. Juan Pablo Aguilar Andrade for the Respondent, and Mr. Hern\u00e1n P\u00e9rez Loose for the Claimants, also appeared as witnesses at the Hearing.\n\n**II. FACTUAL BACKGROUND**\n--------------------------\n\n9.\n\nFor purposes of this Decision on Jurisdiction, the Tribunal need not provide a detailed account of the factual background of the dispute between the parties. Rather, the Tribunal will limit itself to summarizing a few facts pertinent to this jurisdictional phase. However brief, this summary is not to be taken as prejudging in any way the issues of fact or law to be resolved at the merits phase of this arbitration.\n\n10.\n\nIn brief, this arbitration concerns various alleged breaches by Ecuador under both domestic law and international law, as well as under the Treaty between the United States of America and The Republic of Ecuador Concerning the Encouragement and Reciprocal Protection of Investment (the \"Treaty\" or \"BIT\"). In addition, the Claimants rely on an agreement referred to as the \"Participation Contract\" dated 21 May 1999 between OEPC, Ecuador and Petroecuador in connection with the exploration and exploitation of hydrocarbons in what has been labelled \"Block 15\" of the Ecuadorian Amazon.\n\n11.\n\nPursuant to the Participation Contract and related \"Operating Agreements\" for the unified fields of Ed\u00e9n-Yuturi and Limoncocha, OEPC was granted the exclusive right to carry out exploration and exploitation activities in the area assigned to it, namely Block 15.\n\n12.\n\nIn October 2000, OEPC entered into two agreements (the \"AEC Farmout Agreement\" and the \"AEC Operating Agreement\", together the \"AEC Agreements\") with City Investing Company Ltd. (now known as AEC Ecuador Ltd., \"AEC\"), a Bermuda subsidiary of EnCana Corporation, a Canadian oil and gas company. Pursuant to the AEC Agreements, OEPC and AEC concluded a two-phase transaction.\n\n13.\n\nIn a first phase, OEPC granted to AEC a 40% economic interest in the share of the production from Block 15 that accrued to OEPC under the Participation Contract and the Operating Agreements. In exchange for this share in oil produced from Block 15, AEC agreed to pay to OEPC both (i) a series of certain annual amounts over a four-year period to contribute towards capital investments in Block 15 and (ii) 40% of the operating costs incurred by OEPC. Section 2.01 of Article II of the AEC Farmout Agreement states that:\n\n\"OEPC agrees to [\u2026] farm out and transfer to AEC [\u2026] a 40% economic interest (the 'Farmout Interest') in the Farmout Property [\u2026]. The Farmout Interest to be transferred to AEC [\u2026] does not include nominal legal title to an interest in Block 15 or an interest as a party to the [Block 15] Agreements. OEPC shall continue to own 100% of the legal title to the [Block 15] Agreements and to the interest in Block 15 granted or provided for in the [Block 15] Agreements.\"\n\n14.\n\nIn a second phase, it was contemplated that after AEC had made all required payments at the end of the four-year period, and subject to OEPC then obtaining the necessary government approvals, OEPC would assign legal title to AEC. The second stage is described in Section 4.01 of Article IV of the Farmout Agreement:\n\n\"[A]fter AEC has made all payments [\u2026] OEPC and AEC shall execute and deliver such documents as are required to convey legal title to AEC in and to a 40% economic interest in the [Block 15] Agreements and Block 15 and to make AEC a party to the [Block 15] Agreements as owner of such 40% economic interest (subject to obtaining required governmental approvals).\"\n\n15.\n\nOn 1 November 2000, OPC issued a press release announcing the AEC Agreements. The press release confirmed that OEPC would remain the operator of Block 15 and that AEC would receive a 40% economic interest in the operations.\n\n16.\n\nIn 2004, after AEC had made the payments due under the AEC Farmout Agreement, OEPC requested approval from the Ecuadorian government to proceed with the transfer of legal title. The approval was not granted.\n\n17.\n\nRather, on 24 August 2004, citing the AEC Agreements as well as a number of alleged violations represented by the National Hydrocarbons Department (\"DNH\") to be breaches of the Participation Contract, the Attorney General of Ecuador issued orders to the Ministry of Mines and Energy to terminate the Participation Contract and the Operating Agreements through a declaration of \"*caducidad*\".\n\n18.\n\nOn 8 September 2004, the Minister of Energy and Mines instructed the Executive President of Petroecuador to initiate the *caducidad* procedure. The Executive President of Petroecuador did so, on 15 September 2004, by sending OEPC a notice of alleged breaches of the Participation Contract. The notice quoted the allegations that the Attorney General had made in his 24 August 2004 letter, and concluded that *caducidad* should be declared because OEPC had allegedly: (i) transferred rights and obligations under the Participation Contract to AEC without ministerial approval; (ii) entered into a consortium or association to carry out exploration or exploitation operations without ministerial approval; (iii) not invested the minimum amounts required under the Participation Contract; and (iv) repeatedly committed violations of the Hydrocarbons Law and regulations.\n\n19.\n\nDuring the following 18 months or so, OEPC made a number of submissions seeking to rebut the allegations made by the Attorney General, but to no avail.\n\n20.\n\nOn 15 May 2006, the Minister of Energy and Mines notified OEPC of his decision to terminate the Participation Contract by declaring its *caducidad*. The Claimants filed their Request for Arbitration two days later on 17 May 2006.\n\n21.\n\nThe relief sought by the Claimants in their Request for Arbitration is set forth as follows:\n\n\"Claimants respectfully request an award in their favor,\n\n(a) Declaring that Respondents have breached their obligations under the Participation Contract and the Operating Agreements, the Treaty, and Ecuadorian and international law;\n\n(b) Ordering Respondents to declare null and void the *Caducidad* Decree and to reinstate fully OEPC's rights under the Participation Contract and the Operating Agreements;\n\n(c) Directing Respondents to indemnify Claimants for all damages caused as a result of their breaches, including costs and expenses of this proceeding, in amounts to be determined at the hearing, which Claimants believe will exceed US$1 billion;\n\n(d) Directing Respondents to pay Claimants interest on all sums awarded, in amounts to be determined at the hearing, and to order any such further relief as may be available and appropriate in the circumstances.\"\n\n22.\n\nThe Claimants' prayer for relief was subsequently articulated as follows in their Memorial on Damages dated 17 September 2007:\n\n\"Claimants respectfully request the Tribunal:\n\n(a) To declare that Ecuador has breached its obligations under the Treaty and international law;\n\n(b) To declare that Ecuador has breached its obligations under the Participation Contract and Ecuadorian law;\n\n(c) To order Ecuador to pay Claimants the fair market value of the Participation Contract, in the amount of $2,705 billion;\n\n(d) To order Ecuador to pay Claimants consequential damages in the amount of $201.2 million;\n\n(e) To order Ecuador to pay interest on the amounts under (c) and (d) at the monthly rate of United States T-Bills compounded monthly, through the date of full and affective payment of those amounts; and\n\n(f) To order Ecuador to reimburse Claimants all their reasonable legal costs and fees.\"\n\n23.\n\nIt is against this background that the Respondent maintains that the Tribunal does not have jurisdiction over the Claimants' claims.\n\n**III. OVERVIEW OF THE JURISDICTIONAL OBJECTIONS**\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n24.\n\nAt the outset, the Tribunal observes that the Respondent has submitted two separate objections to jurisdiction. Firstly, the Respondent argues that the Tribunal does not have jurisdiction over the parties' dispute because adjudication of this dispute is subject to Clauses 21.4 and 22.2.1 of the Participation Contract which, it maintains, \"carve out\" and/or waive *caducidad* from arbitration. This, according to the Respondent, is the inevitable consequence of the Ecuadorian law principle according to which *caducidad* decrees such as the one at issue in this arbitration carry a presumption of legality and may only be challenged before the Ecuadorian administrative courts. Secondly, the Respondent maintains that the Claimants failed to comply with the six-month waiting period under the Treaty before submitting their Request for Arbitration and, furthermore, that the Claimants' claims are premature.\n\n25.\n\nThe Respondent has articulated the relief it seeks in this jurisdictional phase as follows:\n\n\"Accordingly, for the reasons given in Ecuador's Objections to Jurisdiction and in this submission, and reserving the right to further develop and expand its submissions in view of the Claimants' subsequent written and oral submissions, Ecuador reaffirms its request for the following relief:\n\n(i) a declaration that the Tribunal has no jurisdiction over the Claimants' claims;\n\n(ii) an order that the Claimants pay the costs of these arbitral proceedings, including the cost of the Tribunal and the legal and other costs incurred by Ecuador on a full indemnity basis; and\n\n(iii) interest on any costs awarded to Ecuador, in an amount to be determined by the Tribunal.\n\nIn the alternative, should the Tribunal find that it has jurisdiction over the Claimants' claims, Ecuador requests:\n\n(i) an order that this arbitration be stayed until OEPC challenges the *Caducidad* Decree in the competent Ecuadorian administrative court and that court issues a final ruling on such challenge;\n\n(ii) an order that the Claimants pay the costs of these arbitral proceedings, including the cost of the Tribunal and the legal and other costs incurred by Ecuador on a full indemnity basis; and\n\n(iii) interest on any costs awarded to Ecuador, in an amount to be determined by the Tribunal.\"\n\n26.\n\nIn response, the Claimants argue that neither Clause 21.4 nor Clause 22.2.1 exclude *caducidad* -related disputes from arbitration. The Claimants observe that Clause 21.4 is part of Section 21 of the Participation Contract which is entitled \"Termination and *Caducidad* of this Participation Contract\". This section, they point out, sets forth the various procedures to be followed prior to proceeding to lawful termination of the parties' agreement. According to the Claimants, Clause 21.4 establishes that procedure where the termination is requested for reasons other than *caducidad*. The Claimants also dismiss the contention of the Respondent that Clause 22.2.1 can be construed as a waiver of ICSID jurisdiction over *caducidad* -related disputes. They allege that there is no clear and unequivocal language to this effect in the clause.\n\n27.\n\nThe Claimants add that even if the Respondent's interpretation of Clause 21.4 and/or Clause 22.2.1 were accepted by the Tribunal, OPC's and OEPC's Treaty claims would survive, as would OEPC's contract claims by virtue of Article VI.2 of the Treaty.\n\n28.\n\nAs for the Respondent's allegation that the Claimants have failed to comply with the six-month waiting period under the Treaty, the Claimants maintain that this objection is incompatible with the Respondent's first objection which is based on the Participation Contract, not the Treaty. They add that the dispute at issue in fact arose as early as September 2004 (over eighteen months prior to the *Caducidad* Decree) and that in any event, an investor is not required to respect a waiting period if attempts at a negotiated solution have proven futile. The Claimants also reject the Respondent's contention that their claims are premature.\n\n29.\n\nThe Claimants accordingly request that the Tribunal dismiss the Respondent's jurisdictional objections in their entirety, and further award all the costs of this phase of the proceeding to them.\n\n30.\n\nAt this juncture, before addressing the parties' submissions in more detail, the Tribunal will recite certain provisions of the Participation Contract and the Treaty which it is called upon to interpret and analyze in order to decide the Respondent's jurisdictional challenge.\n\n31.\n\nThe Participation Contract contains the following dispute resolution framework:\n\n\"**TWENTY: CONSULTANTS AND ARBITRATION.**\n\n**20.1 Consultants.-** Disagreements arising between the Parties over technical matters that involve economic considerations and vice-versa, except those matters which under this Contract or the Law must be submitted to decision by competent authority, shall be submitted to the consideration of the legal representatives of the Parties for resolution. If within a period of ten (10) days after one of the Parties has sent the disagreement to the other, same has not been resolved, the Parties shall submit the disagreement to a Consultant, except if the Parties have agreed in writing to extend this term in specific cases.\n\n[\u2026]\n\n**20.2 Arbitration.-** If the disagreements are related to any other matter not included within the scope of Clause 20.1, or if the Parties agree that, for whatever reason, submitting the disagreement to a consultant does not provide a final and mandatory decision, all controversies shall be substantiated through arbitration under law, as established in Art. 10 of the Hydrocarbons Law and the Law on Arbitration and Mediation published in the Official Gazette No. 145 of September 4, 1997, and in accordance with the rules and procedures in this clause.\n\n[\u2026]\n\n**20.3** Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions, from the date on which the Agreement on the Settlement of Differences Relative to Investments among States and the Nationals of Other States (the 'Agreement') signed by the Republic of Ecuador as a Member State of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, on January 15, 1986 and published in Official Gazette No. 386 of March 3, 1986, is ratified by Congress of Ecuador, the Parties agree to submit their controversies or differences that are related to or arise from the performance of this Participation Contract, to the jurisdiction and competence of the International Center for the Settlement of Investment-Related Differences ('CIADI') so that they be arranged and resolved according to the provisions of said Agreement. Under this system of arbitration, the following provisions shall be applied:\n\n[\u2026]\n\n**20.4** Additionally, and without prejudice to the provisions in Clauses 20.2. and 20.3. of this Participation Contract, the Parties agree to submit any difference relating to investments to Treaties, Conventions, Protocols and other acts under international law, signed and ratified by Ecuador in accordance with the Law.\"\n\n32.\n\nClause 21.4 of the Participation Contract, which is at the heart of the Respondent's jurisdictional challenge, reads as follows:3\n\n\"**21.4.** The termination of this Participation Contract for any reason other than those that result in *caducidad* may be requested by either of the Parties, subject to procedures stipulated in Clause 20 in the event that they fail to reach agreement.\"4\n\nThis is the translation put forward by the Respondent. The Claimants subsequently submitted that the translation of Clause 21.4 \"was not very elegant\". They accordingly produced the following new certified translation: \"The termination of the Participation Contract for any cause other than those that result in *caducidad* may be requested by either of the Parties following the procedures stipulated in Clause 20, absent an agreement between them.\" The Respondent rejects this new translation, and maintains that the Respondent's original translation accurately reflects the Spanish original. The Claimants have confirmed that \"they are perfectly happy to work with either version\".\n\nThe English translation of the Participation Contract attached to the Claimants' Memorial on Liability (Exhibit CE-2) translates the word \"*caducidad*\" as \"forfeiture\". Both the Claimants and the Respondent refer to the term \"*caducidad*\" in their pleadings since, pursuant to Clause 3.2, the original Spanish version of the Participation Contract prevails over any other version, including the English translation.\n\n33.\n\nClause 22.2.1 of the Participation Contract is also noted:\n\n\"**22.2.1** In the event of controversies that may arise as a result of the performance of this Participation Contract, in accordance with Ecuadorian law, Contractor expressly waives its right to use diplomatic or consular channels, or to have recourse to any national or foreign jurisdictional body not provided for in this Participation Contract, or to arbitration not recognized by Ecuadorian law or provided for in this Participation Contract. Lack of compliance with this provision shall constitute grounds for the forfeiture of this Participation Contract.\"\n\n34.\n\nMoreover, of significance to the issue of jurisdiction is the following provision of the Treaty:\n\n\"ARTICLE VI\n\n1. For purposes of this Article, an investment dispute is a dispute between a Party and a national or company of the other Party arising out of or relating to (a) an investment agreement between that Party and such national or company; (b) an investment authorization granted by that Party's foreign investment authority to such national or company; or (c) an alleged breach of any right conferred or created by this Treaty with respect to an investment.\n\n2. In the event of an investment dispute, the parties to the dispute should initially seek a resolution through consultation and negotiation. If the dispute cannot be settled amicably, the national or company concerned may choose to submit the dispute, under one of the following alternatives, for resolution;\n\n(a) to the courts or administrative tribunals of the Party that is a party to the dispute; or\n\n(b) in accordance with any applicable, previously agreed dispute-settlement procedures; or\n\n(c) in accordance with the terms of paragraph 3.\n\n3.\n\n(a) Provided that the national or company concerned has not submitted the dispute for resolution under paragraph 2 (a) or (b) and that six months have elapsed from the date on which the dispute arose, the national or company concerned may choose to consent in writing to the submission of the dispute for settlement by binding arbitration:\n\n(i) to the International Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes ('Centre') established by the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of other States, done at Washington, March 18, 1965 ('ICSID Convention'), provided that Party is a party to such convention; or\n\n(ii) to the Additional Facility of the Centre, if the Centre is not available; or\n\n(iii) in accordance with the Arbitration Rules of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL); or\n\n(iv) to any other arbitration institution, or in accordance with any other arbitration rules, as may be mutually agreed between the parties to the dispute.\n\n(b) Once the national or company concerned has so consented, either party to the dispute may initiate arbitration in accordance with the choice so specified in the consent.\n\n4. Each Party hereby consents to the submission of any investment dispute for settlement by binding arbitration in accordance with the choice specified in the written consent of the national or company under paragraph 3. Such consent, together with the written consent of the national company when given under paragraph 3 shall satisfy the requirement for:\n\n(a) written consent of the parties to the dispute for purposes of Chapter II of the ICSID Convention (Jurisdiction of the Centre) and for purposes of the Additional Facility Rules; and\n\n(b) an 'agreement in writing' for purposes of Article II of the United Nations Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards, done at New York, June 10, 1058 ('New York Convention').\n\n5. Any arbitration under paragraph 3(a)(ii), (iii) or (iv) of this Article shall be held in a state that is a party to the New York Convention.\n\n[\u2026]\"\n\n35.\n\nAgainst this background, the Tribunal now turns to the parties' respective contentions regarding jurisdiction. As the Respondent is the moving party, the Tribunal will consider its arguments first. The Tribunal will then review the Claimants' arguments.\n\n**IV. THE PARTIES' POSITIONS**\n------------------------------\n\n***1. The Respondent's First Objection: Adjudication of the Parties' Dispute Is*** ***Governed by the Participation Contract, Which Allegedly Excludes*** **Caducidad** ***from Arbitration***\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**A. The Respondent's Position**\n--------------------------------\n\n36.\n\nAs indicated earlier, the Respondent's first jurisdictional objection is based on the allegation that the parties' dispute is governed by the Participation Contract, Clause 21.4 of which allegedly excludes *caducidad* from arbitration. The Respondent argues that the Claimants freely agreed that *caducidad* was to be non-arbitrable. In the words of the Respondent, \"[t]hey cannot escape that agreement now\".\n\n37.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, Clause 21.4 of the Participation Contract is meant to serve as an exception to the availability of ICSID jurisdiction in the circumstances of the present case. Relying, *inter alia*, on this provision, the Respondent submits that Ecuadorian law, not the ICSID Convention, governs challenges to declarations of *caducidad* :\n\n\"The Ecuadorian Constitution confers exclusive jurisdiction to review the legality of unilateral administrative acts by the State to a contentious-administrative district court, which can then be appealed to the Contentious-Administrative Chamber of the Supreme Court. That exclusive jurisdiction is reflected in Article 1 of the Ecuadorian Law on Arbitration and Mediation (to which the Participation Contract is subject), which renders non-arbitrable those matters that fall within the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts \u2013 i.e., matters that are not susceptible to 'transaction' between the parties.\n\n[\u2026]\n\nHaving agreed that Ecuadorian law governs the Participation Contract, the Claimants were therefore bound to follow Ecuadorian law in challenging the *Caducidad* Decree. In particular, they were required to seek annulment of the *Caducidad* Decree before the Ecuadorian administrative courts by either filing a complaint against the Decree itself (*recurso de plena jurisdicci\u00f3n*) or by filing a claim of nullity (*recurso de nulidad*) seeking only to annul the Decree. They did neither. Thus, all other bodies, including this Tribunal, must presume the legality of such decisions and have no jurisdiction to adjudicate them.\"\n\n38.\n\nThe Respondent avers in its Reply that disputes arising out of *caducidad* cannot be characterized as \"contractual disputes\".5 Rather, such disputes are \"extra-contractual\" in nature and, according to the Respondent, they are non-arbitrable pursuant to Article 4 of the Ecuadorian law on Mediation and Arbitration. The Respondent states that Clause 21.4 of the Participation Contract is merely a reflection of this principle, and further contends that its position on this point is supported by the ICSID case of *Repsol YPF Ecuador SA v. Empresa Estatal Petr\u00f3leos del Ecuador (Petroecuador)* :6\n\n\"This interpretation is fully confirmed by international case law. The ICSID tribunal in *Repsol YPF Ecuador SA v. Empresa Estatal Petr\u00f3leos de Ecuador (Petroecuador)* held that issues relating to the legality of administrative acts, such as the *Caducidad* Decree, are non-arbitrable under Ecuadorian law. Attempting to avoid the devastating implications of *Repsol*, the Claimants mischaracterize it as confirming ICSID jurisdiction over an administrative act with *res iudicata* effect. In fact, *Repsol* stands for precisely the opposite proposition.\n\n[...]\n\nThus, the reasoning of the ICSID tribunal is twofold: (*i*) if the decision of the DNH had the effect of unilaterally modifying the contract, it would transform the issue from contractual into non-contractual (administrative); and (*ii*) only contractual issues are subject to 'transaction' and arbitration. This 'transaction' language is the same language reflected in Article 1 of the Ecuadorian Law on Arbitration and Mediation (to which the Participation Contract is subject), which renders non-arbitrable those matters that fall within the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts \u2013 *i.e.*, matters that are not susceptible to 'transaction' between parties.\"\n\nThe Tribunal notes that, in its Objections to Jurisdiction, the Respondent argued the opposite. It wrote that *caducidad* was a contractual issue, not an extra-contractual one\n\nICSID Case No. ARB/01/10, Award dated 20 February 2004.\n\n39.\n\nIn this connection, the Tribunal recalls that, in their written and oral pleadings, the Claimants stress that they are advancing both Treaty and contract claims, whereas the Respondent argues that the Claimants' claims are fundamentally contractual in the sense that \"the Participation Contract, by its terms, occupies the field with regard to a *caducidad* decree, such that the Claimants cannot seek recourse based on a declaration of *caducidad* in any other forum [ *i.e.* the traditional avenues provided by Ecuadorian law]\".\n\n40.\n\nAt the Hearing, the Respondent expanded its Clause 21.4 argument by submitting that, in the event of a conflict between Ecuadorian law and the Participation Contract, the former trumps the latter. This, according to the Respondent, flows from the application of Clause 22.1.4 of the Participation Contract, which states:\n\n\"**22.1.4 Legal Framework:** Norms applicable to this Participation Contract, at the time of its execution, include but are not limited to the following:\n\n**1.-** The Hydrocarbons Law, published in Official Gazette No. Seven hundred and eleven. (711) of November fifteenth (15), nineteen hundred and seventy eight. (1978).\n\n[\u2026]\n\n**13.-** Arbitration and Mediation Law, published in Official Gazette No. One hundred and forty five (145), of September four (4), Nineteen hundred and ninety seven (1997).\n\n[\u2026]\n\nIn the event of a conflict between the above mentioned documents, the order of priority amongst them shall be the following: Laws, Regulations and this Participation Contract.\" (emphasis added)\n\n41.\n\nOn the basis of this provision of the Participation Contract, the Respondent submitted as follows at the Hearing:\n\n\"With this in mind I would suggest to you that this is a further and strong reason to interpret Clause 21.4 exactly as Ecuador has stated, because that is the interpretation that avoids the conflict, and one should always presume that the parties did not enter into a contract which contained a fundamental conflict. But, if you don't agree with that, then you end up with the conflict, and you must follow the directions in Clause 22.1.4 which says that the law on arbitration and mediation supersedes anything that conflicts in the contract.\"\n\n42.\n\nThe Respondent characterizes its first jurisdictional objection as a double-hurdle. In the words of the Respondent:\n\n\"There are two separate and distinct reasons why OEPC's claims are nonarbitrable. First, disputes regarding a declaration of *caducidad* are inherently non-arbitrable under Ecuadorian law, which both Parties agree governs the Participation Contract. Second, the Participation Contract itself precludes ICSID arbitration regarding *caducidad*. Importantly, the Tribunal must overcome *both* hurdles before it can exercise jurisdiction of OEPC's claims.\" (emphasis in original)\n\n43.\n\nThe Respondent maintains that the Claimants are unable to overcome either hurdle.\n\n44.\n\nIn its Reply, the Respondent constructed an additional argument on the basis of Clause 22.2.1 of the Participation Contract which contains the following waiver language:\n\n\"**22.2.1** In the event of controversies that may arise as a result of the performance of this Participation Contract, in accordance with Ecuadorian law, Contractor expressly waives its right to use diplomatic or consular channels, or to have recourse to any national or foreign jurisdictional body not provided for in this Participation Contract, or to arbitration not recognized by Ecuadorian law or provided for in this Participation Contract. Lack of compliance with this provision shall constitute grounds for the forfeiture of this Participation Contract.\" (emphasis added)\n\n45.\n\nThe Respondent contends as follows:\n\n\"ICSID arbitration in relation of *caducidad* is simply not an arbitration 'recognized by Ecuadorian law or provided for in this Participation Contract,' within the meaning of Clause 22.2.1. As set forth more fully below, Clause 20.4 does not change that interpretation, because Clause 21.4 and the other provisions discussed above operate as a limitation on the scope of treaty claims that potentially could be asserted by OEPC in connection with that Clause. Accordingly, OEPC clearly and unambiguously waived recourse to arbitration of *caducidad* -related matters in Clause 22.2.1 of the Participation Contract. The Tribunal should reject Claimants' attempt to simply disregard the contractual limitations on the scope of ICSID jurisdiction.\"\n\n46.\n\nFinally, again as part of its Reply, the Respondent distinguishes its jurisdictional analysis as it relates, firstly, to OEPC and, secondly, to OPC. The former is a signatory to the Participation Contract, whereas the latter is not. Thus, according to the Respondent, OPC lacks standing to assert claims as an investor. Alternatively, the Respondent maintains that OPC is bound by the alleged exclusion of ICSID jurisdiction agreed by OEPC under the Participation Contract.\n\n**B. The Claimants' Position**\n------------------------------\n\n47.\n\nIn response to the Respondent's first jurisdictional objection, to the extent that it is based on Clause 21.4, the Claimants maintain that it is both wrong and irrelevant for the following reasons:\n\n\"(i) Section 21 of the Participation Contract is not an arbitration clause. Rather, it is merely a provision which sets forth procedures to be followed in order to proceed to lawful termination of the Participation Contract. Clause 21.4 set forth therein is accordingly not meant to carve out disputes arising out of a declaration of *caducidad* from Clause 20.3 arbitration;\n\n(ii) Even if the Respondent's interpretation of Clause 21.4 were accepted \u2013 *i.e.* that it reflects a contractual agreement not to arbitrate unilateral termination disputes \u2013 OPC's Treaty claims would nonetheless survive because it is not a signatory to the Participation Contract;\n\n(iii) The Respondent's interpretation of Clause 21.4 \u2013 and the objection it advances on the basis of this interpretation \u2013 is based on the premise that the Claimants' claims result from allegations of breach of the Participation Contract. Both OPC and OEPC, however, have primarily submitted Treaty claims, which survive regardless of the Respondent's interpretation of Clause 21.4; and\n\n(iv) OEPC's contract claims survive regardless of the Respondent's interpretation of Clause 21.4 because Article VI.2 of the Treaty entitles OEPC to choose ICSID arbitration instead of any contractual or statutory selection of the Ecuadorian administrative courts for the adjudication of its contract claims.\"\n\n48.\n\nAt the outset, the Claimants stress that they have submitted their dispute with the Respondent to the Tribunal pursuant to the Treaty, not the Participation Contract. In the words of the Claimants:\n\n\"It is Claimants' case that Article VI alone vests the Tribunal with jurisdiction over Claimants' entire dispute with Ecuador, and only the terms of the provision govern the scope of the jurisdiction thus conferred. Only if the Tribunal were to find that Article VI does not vest it with jurisdiction over OEPC's *contract* claims, Claimants submit that it would have such jurisdiction pursuant to Clause 20.3 of the Participation Contract.\" (emphasis in original)\n\n49.\n\nIn any event, the Claimants contend that Clause 21.4 of the Participation Contract neither carves out disputes arising out of *caducidad* nor contains any affirmative choice in favor of the Ecuadorian administrative courts. Rather, according to the Claimants, Section 21, including Clause 21.4, sets forth procedures to be followed prior to proceeding to lawful termination. The Claimants' interpretation of Clause 21.4 is articulated as follows:\n\n\"Turning to what Clause 21.4 *does* say, it is important first to note that Clause 21.4 comes shortly after Clause 21.2, which provides that if the State wants to terminate for causes of *caducidad*, it must first follow an administrative procedure concluding with a decision by the Minister of Energy declaring the termination. This right of Ecuador to terminate the contract after submitting to an administrative procedure is a reflection of the State's *poderes exorbitantes,* 'exorbitant powers,' in administrative law. HPL ER III \u00b6 44.\n\nClause 21.4 complements Clause 21.2 by providing that if either party wants to terminate for causes *other than those of caducidad* and the parties cannot reach an agreement, the terminating party must first seek authorization to do so from the Clause 20.3 arbitrator. *See* HPL ER III \u00b6\u00b6 44, 45. Pursuant to Clause 21.1, such other causes include, for instance, a claim by the contractor of a situation of force majeure lasting for more than 12 months without interruption.\n\nClauses 21.2 and 21.4 thus mirror each other, each setting forth the relevant procedures to be followed by the parties *before* they can terminate for causes of *caducidad*, on the one hand, and other causes, on the other hand. Clause 21.4 requires the parties to seek authorization from the arbitrator if they want to terminate for causes other than those of *caducidad* and cannot reach agreement. Clause 21.2 requires the State to commence an administrative procedure concluding with a positive decision by the Minister of Energy if it wants to terminate for causes of *caducidad*, as in fact occurred here. *See* HPL ER III \u00b6\u00b6 44-46.\n\nTherefore, when Clause 21.2 provides that if the parties cannot reach agreement, either one of them may *request* termination for causes other than those that result in *caducidad* following the arbitration procedures of Section 20, it simply provides the procedure a party must follow *before* it can lawfully terminate. However, Clause 21.4 does not say anything about the procedures to be used for the resolution of disputes arising out of a *declaration* of *caducidad, after* the Clause 21.2.2 procedure has come to an end and the declaration has been issued. *See* HPL ER III \u00b6\u00b6 46, 48-50, 53(1).\n\n[\u2026]\n\nEach of these provisions confirms with different terms that Clause 21.4 simply states the parties' obligation to seek arbitral authorization before they can proceed lawfully with unilateral termination for causes other than those of *caducidad* ; and that Clause 21.4 does not exclude disputes arising out of *caducidad* declarations from arbitration or refer such disputes to the Ecuadorian administrative courts. This is consistent with Ecuadorian law, which recognizes the arbitrability of administrative acts, including *caducidad* declarations. CA-409, *Arbitral Award No. 003-07/004-07,* at 46-47 (asserting jurisdiction to decide whether the administrative acts of *caducidad* issued by the Ecuadorian Tribunal Supremo Electoral was consistent with Ecuadorian laws and procedures and whether there was a cause for *caducidad*); CA-364, *Repsol* \u00b6 43 (dismissing Respondent's claim that the Tribunal lacked jurisdiction over an administrative act with *res judicata* effect if Article 25 of the ICSID Convention conditions were otherwise met). HPL ER III \u00b6\u00b6 32-38, 53 (e)(f)(g).\" (emphasis in original)\n\n50.\n\nThe Claimants add that even if the Tribunal were to accept the Respondent's interpretation of Clause 21.4, OPC's Treaty claims would nonetheless survive because OPC is not a signatory to the Participation Contract. Likewise, the Claimants contend that the Respondent's interpretation of Clause 21.4 is irrelevant for purposes of OEPC's Treaty claims because the Participation Contract does not contain a waiver to that effect.\n\n51.\n\nSimilarly, regarding OEPC's contract claims, the Claimants consider the Respondent's interpretation of Clause 21.4 to be of no consequence to the Tribunal's jurisdiction given the terms of Articles VI.2 and VI.3 of the Treaty. They submit:\n\n\"The terms of Article VI.2 merit the full quotation that Ecuador omitted from its papers:\n\nIf the dispute cannot be settled amicably, the national or company concerned may *choose* to submit the dispute, under one of the following *alternatives,* for resolution:\n\n(a) to the courts or administrative tribunals of the Party that is a party to the dispute; *or*\n\n(b) in accordance with any applicable, previously agreed dispute-settlement procedures; *or*\n\n(c) in accordance with the terms of paragraph 3. (emphasis added)\n\nArticle VI.3 of the Treaty goes on to confirm that the investor can ' *choose* to consent in writing to the submission of the dispute for settlement by binding arbitration... to the International Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes...' (emphasis added)\n\nTo exercise that right, the Treaty requires that the investor has not 'submitted the dispute for resolution under paragraph 2 (a) or (b)' (i.e., 'to the courts or administrative tribunals of the Party that is a party to the dispute' or 'in accordance with any applicable, previously agreed dispute-settlement procedures'). As long as the investor does not submit the dispute to either of those alternative forums, it has the Treaty right to submit it to an ICSID tribunal *instead of* those alternative forums, including a contractually chosen forum.\" (emphasis in original)\n\n52.\n\nThe Claimants accordingly summarize their position on jurisdiction as being essentially based on a Treaty right to choose ICSID arbitration over the Ecuadorian administrative courts, namely the *Tribunal de lo Contencioso-Administrativo* or \"TCA\", and draw the following conclusion:\n\n\"***In conclusion***, it follows from the plain language of Article VI.2 and its object and purpose that Claimants had the right under that provision to submit the dispute to either ICSID or UNCITRAL arbitration instead of the TCA, whether the TCA would otherwise have jurisdiction by law or contract. Either the contract does not provide for ICSID arbitration regarding *caducidad* -related disputes, and then the TCA is a domestic 'court or administrative tribunal' within the meaning of Article VI.2(a); or the contract provides for the jurisdiction of the TCA over such disputes, and then the TCA may be a 'previously agreed dispute resolution procedure' within the meaning of Article VI.2(b). Either way, Claimants were entitled to choose this Tribunal over the TCA pursuant to Article VI.2(c).\" (emphasis in original)\n\n53.\n\nThe Claimants further reassert that notwithstanding Article VI.2 of the Treaty, both Claimants are entitled to submit their Treaty claims to ICSID arbitration. More particularly, they articulate their position regarding OEPC as follows:\n\n\"***First***, the plain language of clause 20.3 refers to 'controversies or differences that are related to or arise from the performance of this Participation Contract.' It does not say 'controversies or disputes that are related to or arise from alleged breaches of the Treaty.' Had the parties wanted to extend the scope of this arbitration clause to cover Treaty claims, they would have said so. In addition, as shown above, if Ecuador accepts that the forum selection clause in the *SGS Philippines* contract did not extend to treaty claims, it is estopped from arguing that Clause 20.3, which is not worded any more broadly than the SGS clause, does extend to treaty claims.\n\n***Second***, had the parties intended to cover Treaty claims in clause 20.3, they would not have included clause 20.4 (stating that '[a]dditionally, and without prejudice to the provisions in Clause 20.2 and 20.3 of this Participation Contract, the parties agree to submit any difference relating to investments to Treaties, Conventions, Protocols and other acts under international law') in the Participation Contract. Ecuador's reading of Clause 20.3 renders Clause 20.4 entirely superfluous.\n\n***Third***, tribunals have systematically rejected the argument that similarly worded forum selection clauses in investment agreements could affect a treaty tribunal's jurisdiction over treaty claims. In *SGS (Pakistan)*, for instance, the tribunal interpreted the scope of an arbitration clause referring ' *[a]ny dispute,* *controversy or claim arising out of, or related to this Agreement or breach, termination or invalidity thereof* ' to a local arbitrator. The tribunal explained that:\n\nPakistan has argued before us that the arbitrator seized of claims grounded on violation of the PSI Agreement would have jurisdiction not only over such contract claims but also over the BIT claims. We are not persuaded that SGS's BIT claims against Pakistan are subject to the jurisdiction of the Islamabad arbitrator if only because such claims are based not on the PSI Agreement, but rather allege a cause of action under the BIT. RLA-8, *SGS (Pakistan)* \u00b6 154.\n\n*See also CA-9,* *Eureko* \u00b6\u00b6 92, 114 (relying on *Vivendi (Annulment)* to dismiss respondent's objection that a contractual provision referring to the local courts any 'conflicts between Parties arising from the Agreement' affected the tribunal's jurisdiction over claimant's treaty claims); CA-355, *Azurix (Jurisdiction)* \u00b6\u00b6 26, 76 (holding that a contractual provision referring 'all disputes that may arise out of the Bidding' to the local courts did not preclude the tribunal's jurisdiction over claimant's treaty claims, '[e]ven if the dispute as presented by the Claimant may involve the interpretation or analysis of facts related to performance under the Concession Agreement.').\" (emphasis in original)\n\n54.\n\nAs for OPC, the Claimants refute the Respondent's allegation of lack of standing and conclude that OPC is exercising its Treaty rights in good faith and in fulfillment of its duties towards its shareholders.\n\n55.\n\nFinally, the Claimants emphasize that, in any event, Ecuadorian law itself does not preclude arbitration of disputes relating to *caducidad*. They contend that a *caducidad* declaration is plainly discretionary and that neither the legal relationship between the parties nor the *caducidad* declaration are extra-contractual in nature. According to the Claimants, *caducidad* -related disputes are thus fully arbitrable.\n\n***2. The Respondent's Second Objection: The Claimants Have Allegedly Failed*** ***to Comply With the Six-Month Waiting Period Under the BIT***\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**A. The Respondent's Position**\n--------------------------------\n\n56.\n\nThe Respondent's second jurisdictional objection is based on Article VI.3 of the Treaty which establishes a six-month waiting period for submission of a dispute to arbitration.7\n\nSee *supra* at paragraph 34\n\n57.\n\nThe Respondent contends that by filing their Request for Arbitration two days after the *Caducidad* Decree, the Claimants acted in procedural and substantive bad faith:\n\n\"Ecuador's second objection to jurisdiction is that the Claimants failed to comply with the six-month waiting period set forth in Article VI.3 of the BIT. In a flagrant disregard for the provisions of the BIT, the Claimants made no effort whatsoever to adhere to the prescribed 'cooling off' period to negotiate a solution to this dispute \u2013 precisely for which the waiting period was designed. Instead, they filed their Request for Arbitration a mere *two days* after Ecuador issued the *Caducidad* Decree and the *same day* the government assumed control of operations in Block 15.\n\nThe Claimants' disregard for the provisions of the BIT is procedural and substantive bad faith. Indeed, the Claimants elected to initiate this arbitration and pursue provisional relief rather than do what they had specifically agreed to do in the Participation Contract \u2013 namely, to ***not*** arbitrate declarations of *caducidad* but, rather, to follow the dictate of Ecuadorian law should they chose to challenge the declaration of *caducidad.*\" (emphasis in original)\n\n58.\n\nThe Respondent also argues that such a mandatory waiting period is a true jurisdictional requirement.\n\n59.\n\nFinally, the Respondent contends that the Claimants' claims are premature because they made no attempt to challenge the *Caducidad* Decree before the Ecuadorian administrative courts.\n\n**B. The Claimants' Position**\n------------------------------\n\n60.\n\nAs noted earlier, the Claimants maintain that the Respondent's second jurisdictional objection, based on the Treaty, is incompatible with its first one, based on the Participation Contract. They add that the dispute in fact arose as early as September 2004 (over eighteen months prior to the *Caducidad* Decree) and that in any event, an investor is not required to respect a waiting period if attempts at a negotiated solution have proven futile.\n\n61.\n\nThe Claimants also dispute the Respondent's suggestion that the waiting period at issue is a jurisdictional requirement, as opposed to a procedural one. As for the Respondent's allegation that their claims are premature, the Claimants argue that this is not the case because, *inter alia*, they were required to make an irrevocable choice between the TCA and this Tribunal and that this issue, in any event, goes to the merits of the case, not to the issue of this Tribunal's jurisdiction.\n\n**V. THE TRIBUNAL'S ANALYSIS**\n------------------------------\n\n***1. The Respondent's First Jurisdictional Objection***\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n62.\n\nAs gleaned from the overview of their respective arguments regarding the issue of jurisdiction, the parties fundamentally disagree on the interpretation of Clause 21.4 of the Participation Contract, in particular as to whether this provision operates to exclude the Claimants' claims from the Tribunal's remit. The Tribunal must accordingly decide whether Clause 21.4 carves out an exception to the availability of ICSID arbitration in the context of a dispute resulting from a declaration of *caducidad* of the Participation Contract by the Respondent.\n\n63.\n\nBefore turning to its analysis of Clause 21.4 of the Participation Contract, the Tribunal observes that the parties also fundamentally disagree on the issue of whether Clause 22.2.1 of the Participation Contract, which is part of Section 22 entitled \"Applicable Law, Domicile, Jurisdiction and Procedure\", operates as a waiver to the adjudication of claims under ICSID. The language of this provision is highlighted again below for ease of reference:\n\n\"**TWENTY TWO: APPLICABLE LAW, DOMICILE, JURISDICTION AND PROCEDURE**\n\n[\u2026]\n\n**22.2 Domicile, Jurisdiction and Competence.-** The Parties submit to Ecuadorian laws, and controversies shall be substantiated by the provisions of clauses 22.1.2 and 22.1.3 of this Participation Contract. This provision shall prevail even after the termination of this Participation Contract, up to the time when the operating permit of Contractor in Ecuador is legally canceled [ *sic* ], regardless of the causes for termination.\n\n**22.2.1** In the event of controversies that may arise as a result of the performance of this Participation Contract, in accordance with Ecuadorian law, Contractor expressly waives its right to use diplomatic or consular channels, or to have recourse to any national or foreign jurisdictional body not provided for in this Participation Contract, or to arbitration not recognized by Ecuadorian law or provided for in this Participation Contract. Lack of compliance with this provision shall constitute grounds for the forfeiture of this Participation Contract.\n\n**22.2.2** The parties agree to use the means set forth in this Participation Contract to settle questions or controversies that may arise during the term hereof, as well as to observe and comply with decisions issued by experts, arbiters, judges or competent tribunals in all applicable cases, according to the provisions of this Participation Contract.\n\n[\u2026]\"\n\n64.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that whilst the Clause 22.2.1 waiver argument was not central to the Respondent's written submissions on jurisdiction, it was argued extensively by the Respondent at the Hearing. Indeed, it was the main focus of the Respondent's Opening Statement. For this reason, the Tribunal addresses the Respondent's waiver argument first.\n\n65.\n\nAt the Hearing, the Respondent submitted that Clause 22.2.1 of the Participation Contract is an \"unequivocal waiver of arbitrability\". The Respondent argued that \"this is an agreement to waive some of the options in the BIT, but not all of them. So, you don't have a renunciation of the BIT, you have a narrowing of options\". These options under the BIT, the Tribunal recalls, are set forth at Article VI thereof, which provides *inter alia* as follows:\n\n\"ARTICLE VI\n\n[\u2026]\n\n2. In the event of an investment dispute, the parties to the dispute should initially seek a resolution through consultation and negotiation. If the dispute cannot be settled amicably, the national or company concerned may choose to submit the dispute, under one of the following alternatives, for resolution;\n\n(a) to the courts or administrative tribunals of the Party that is a party to the dispute; or\n\n(b) in accordance with any applicable, previously agreed dispute-settlement procedures; or\n\n(c) in accordance with the terms of paragraph 3.\n\n3.\n\n(a) Provided that the national or company concerned has not submitted the dispute for resolution under paragraph 2 (a) or (b) and that six months have elapsed from the date on which the dispute arose, the national or company concerned may choose to consent in writing to the submission of the dispute for settlement by binding arbitration:\n\n(i) to the International Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes ('Centre') established by the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of other States, done at Washington, March 18, 1965 ('ICSID Convention'), provided that Party is a party to such convention;\n\n[\u2026]\n\n[\u2026]\"\n\n66.\n\nIn essence, the Respondent argues that Clause 22.2.1 of the Participation Contract narrows the scope of the availability of ICSID arbitration under the BIT by creating a waiver applicable to any arbitration not recognized by Ecuadorian law. Arbitration of *caducidad* disputes, the Respondent contends, is \"arbitration not recognized by Ecuadorian law\".\n\n67.\n\nIn response to a question from the Chairman in this regard during the Hearing, counsel for the Respondent answered that:\n\n\"the BIT came first, and the contract came second, and I think that, you know, to the extent it is a factor, it is a situation where the parties knew there were the three options, and in the contract, they agreed to exercise just one of them. I think that is a perfectly rational, commercial, governmental decision [\u2026].\"\n\n68.\n\nIn other words, the Respondent maintains that the parties agreed that in the event of a *caducidad* -related dispute under the Participation Contract, the Ecuadorian administrative courts would have exclusive jurisdiction. This line of argument led to further questions from the Tribunal regarding Clause 22.2.1, and ultimately to the following exchange between Mr. Williams and Mr. von Mehren:\n\n\"ARBITRATOR WILLIAMS: If you have a decision where the parties are negotiating against the backdrop of this Treaty, why would it be a commercial and rational and sensible outcome for the Claimant to write in such a clause of this -- as this -- which would compel them to go to the State courts for an argument about the forfeiture decree?\n\nMR. VON MEHREN: Why would that be reasonable?\n\nARBITRATOR WILLIAMS: Yes. Why would they want to do that? You suggested that this would be a sensible, commercial and rational outcome.\n\nMR. VON MEHREN: You know, my experience in negotiating arbitration provisions is that you don't always end up with what you would prefer to have in the best possible world, and what happens is you think about the commercial benefits that you hope to gain from the transaction, the business guys are there, and they are saying, 'You know, we are going to do this, we are going to make a lot of money', and, 'Let's pursue that', and you weigh those off against what is going to happen if there is a dispute, and where you are going to take that dispute and how that might affect your ability to win if you deserve to do so.\n\nI think a very rationale [ *sic* ] decision -- I have seen it many times in my career -is to accept perhaps not your perfect, your greatest desire as to how the dispute is resolved, in order to go forward with an economic transaction, and I would say, as the Attorney General did, that the courts of Ecuador are independent, the courts of Ecuador are fully equipped to handle this issue, the administrative courts, and there is absolutely no evidence before this Tribunal that they wouldn't do that in an entirely proper way.\n\nSo, I think it is reasonable in the context of the entire transaction and negotiations for Occi [ *sic* ] to have agreed to this, and once they do, once they do, I think it is reasonable to say, 'We have an agreement and it should be followed'. More than, Should be followed', I think it is necessary in any system of jurisprudence, whether that be a national system, or this international system; extremely important that agreements be followed rather than not.\"\n\n69.\n\nThe Claimants strenuously reject this argument which, they note, surfaced very late in the Respondent's jurisdictional challenge. At the Hearing, they argued:\n\n\"[E]ven the waiver argument rests not only on a misreading of those words, and I will get to that, but it rests on their use of 21.4, and as we pointed out in our answer, it was a little bit like one of these glossy brochures, they kept telling you that 21.4 was a clear carve-out, clear exception and so forth, they told you that for about what [ *sic* ] half a dozen pages, they repeated that several times before they actually showed you the text, and that is not surprising because if it was such a clear carve-out you would expect it to say something like, 'Notwithstanding the provisions of Clause 20 in the event of a forfeiture by Caducidad the contractors' only recourse shall be to the Ecuadorian courts or to the TCA [ *Tribunal de lo Contencioso-Administrativo* ]'. That would be a clear carve-out, instead of, as the President pointed out in his question to Mr. Von Mehren just now, it is in the forfeiture sections, and it is simply providing that if a party wants to request forfeiture, one of the grounds in the contract, then it is to do so through the arbitration process and Article 20, except for declaring forfeiture by Caducidad which has its own provision immediately before that in 21.2. That is what the contract says. That disposes of their arguments.\"\n\n70.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees with the Claimants regarding the interpretation of Clause 22.2.1 of the Participation Contract. The Tribunal does not accept that, by virtue of this provision, the parties agreed that *caducidad* -related disputes under the Participation Contract would solely be resolved by submission to the Ecuadorian administrative courts, *i.e.* the TCA. This is simply not what the clause says.\n\n71.\n\nBased on elementary principles of contract interpretation, any exception to the availability of ICSID arbitration for the resolution of disputes arising under the Participation Contract, in this case *caducidad* -related disputes, requires clear language to this effect. The requirement of clear and unequivocal language in such circumstances was confirmed by the ICSID tribunal in the case of *Aguas del Tunari v. The Republic of Bolivia*8 which recalled a tribunal's duty to the parties in this regard (at paragraph 119):\n\n\"[I]t is the Tribunal's view than an ICSID tribunal has a duty to exercise its jurisdiction in such instances absent any indication that the parties specifically intended that the conflicting clause act as a waiver or modification of an otherwise existing grant of jurisdiction to ICSID. A separate conflicting document should be held to affect the jurisdiction of an ICSID tribunal only if it clearly is intended to modify the jurisdiction otherwise granted to ICSID. As stated above, an explicit waiver by an investor of its rights to invoke the jurisdiction of ICSID pursuant to a BIT could affect the jurisdiction of an ICSID tribunal. However, the Tribunal will not imply a waiver or modification of ICSID jurisdiction without specific indications of the common intention of the Parties. \" (emphasis added)\n\nICSID Case No. ARB/02/3, Decision on Respondent's Objections to Jurisdiction, dated 21 October 2005.\n\n72.\n\nThe tribunal in that case further cautioned (at paragraph 122): \"The Tribunal will not read an ambiguous clause as an implicit waiver of ICSID jurisdiction; silence as to the question is not sufficient.\" That caution is apposite in the present case and this Tribunal adopts it.\n\n73.\n\nClause 22.2.1 cannot, on its terms, be construed as an exception or waiver to ICSID jurisdiction over *caducidad* -related disputes. The Participation Contract is fraught with express and extensive references to *caducidad* under the very preceding section to the one in which Clause 22.2.1 is found. The parties fully understood the significance of *caducidad* in terms of the Participation Contract's potential forfeiture and resulting disputes. Had the parties wished to exclude such disputes from ICSID jurisdiction and confer exclusive jurisdiction to the Ecuadorian administrative courts in this regard, they could have done so. They did not and the Tribunal will not imply such wording in the clause.\n\n74.\n\nBy virtue of the Treaty, the Respondent expressly consented to the submission of investment disputes for settlement by binding ICSID arbitration under the Washington Convention. The Respondent acknowledged at the Hearing that this Treaty, upon ratification, became part of Ecuadorian law. Therefore, whilst Clause 22.2.1 refers to \"arbitration not recognized by Ecuadorian law\", nothing in the Participation Contract supports or even suggests that this language, when read in context, reveals a common intention to waive ICSID jurisdiction over *caducidad* -related disputes, and the Tribunal so finds.\n\n75.\n\nThe Tribunal now comes to the provision which, at least initially, was central to the Respondent's jurisdictional challenge, *i.e.* Clause 21.4. This provision, as indicated previously, is part of a Section of the Participation Contract entitled \"Termination and *Caducidad* of this Participation Contract\". Clause 21.4 is in fact the penultimate provision of this Section which is reproduced *in extenso* for purposes of fully appreciating the contractual context at issue:\n\n\"**TWENTY ONE: TERMINATION AND** ***CADUCIDAD*** **OF THIS PARTICIPATION CONTRACT.-**\n\n**21.1 Termination** : This Contract shall terminate:\n\n**21.1.1** By a declaration of *caducidad* issued by the Corresponding Ministry for the causes and following the procedure established in Articles seventy four (74), seventy five (75) and seventy six (76) of the Hydrocarbons Law, insofar as applicable.\n\n**21.1.2** Due to a transfer of rights and obligations of the Participation Contract without prior authorization from the Corresponding Ministry.\n\n**21.1.3** By executed judicial sentence of Contractor's bankruptcy.\n\n**21.1.4** By modification of the legal status of Contractor without a prior authorization from the Corresponding Ministry.\n\n**21.1.5** By extinction of the legal status of Contractor.\n\n**21.1.6** By mutual agreement between the Parties.\n\n**21.1.7** By executed judicial judgment that declares the termination of this Participation Contract.\n\n**21.1.8** At any time during the existence of this Contract, at Contractor's opinion, and once it has complied with its contractual and legal obligations enforceable to date, with prior authorization from the Corresponding Ministry.\n\n**21.1.9** Because the term of this Participation Contract has lapsed.\n\n**21.1.10** At the sole discretion of Contractor and without any right to be indemnified by the other Party, when Force Majeure or Acts of God last for a period of more than twelve continuous or discontinuous months within a period of twenty four months.\n\n**21.2** ***Caducidad*****.-** In cases of default that may constitute a cause for *caducidad*, in accordance with the provisions of the Hydrocarbons Law, the procedure described below shall be followed:\n\n**21.2.1** The legal representative of PETROECUADOR shall serve notice with claim of non-compliance to Contractor, to be answered within ten (10) days, rejecting or accepting said claim and in this latter case, offering to remedy the situation within a period of thirty days from the date of receiving notice of same. Within this period Contractor shall take all necessary measures, according to circumstances, to remedy, correct or rectify the failure or non-compliance that brought about that claim.\n\n**21.2.2** If within the terms determined in the clause 21.2.1 above, Contractor does not solve such failures or noncompliance or does not justify such failures or noncompliance to PETROECUADOR's satisfaction, the legal representative of PETROECUADOR shall request from the Corresponding Minister of a declaration of *caducidad* for this Participation Contract.\n\n**21.2.3** Prior to said declaration of *caducidad*, the Corresponding Minister shall serve notice to Contractor so that, in a period of no less than thirty days and no more than sixty days from the date of the notice, Contractor shall comply with all obligations that have not been performed, or clears the claims formulated. If, having taken such actions, the term is insufficient for the Contractor to remedy, correct or rectify such failure or lack of compliance, and Contractor is able to prove this, then upon Contractor's request, the Corresponding Ministry can provide an additional term to that granted.\n\n**21.2.4** Once *caducidad* has been declared, the provisions of Art. 75 of the Hydrocarbons Law shall be applied, and Contractor shall transfer to PETROECUADOR the originals of all antecedents and all geological, geophysical, drilling or any other type of records, relative to the Area, unless evidence is provided that such documents have already been delivered.\n\n**21.3** For the purposes of *caducidad* and penalties, the provisions of Chapter IX of the Hydrocarbons Law shall be applicable.\n\n**21.4** Termination of this Participation Contract for any reason other than those that result in *caducidad* may be requested by either of the Parties, subject to the procedures stipulated in Clause Twenty in the event that they fail to reach an agreement.\n\n**21.5** Breaches of this Contract or violations of the Hydrocarbons Law or its regulations that do not result in *caducidad* shall be punished in accordance with the Law and its Regulations.\" (emphasis added)\n\n76.\n\nResorting to arguments not dissimilar to its Clause 22.2.1 waiver argument, the Respondent contends that Clause 21.4 operates to carve-out *caducidad* disputes from being resolved by way of arbitration in general and by ICSID arbitration in particular. In the words of counsel for the Respondent, \"21.4 and 22.2.1 are specific provisions that appl[y] to specific situations, and therefore they are the exceptions to the general rules in Clause 20\". For reasons not dissimilar to those which led the Tribunal to reject the Respondent's Clause 22.2.1 waiver argument, the Tribunal finds that the Respondent's Clause 21.4 carve-out argument fails as well.\n\n77.\n\nTo state the obvious, Section 21 addresses termination and *caducidad* of the Participation Contract. Clause 21.4 in particular provides that either party may request termination of the Participation Contract for any reason other than those that result in *caducidad* and also addresses the manner in which this is to be done (\"\u2026 subject to the procedures stipulated in Clause Twenty \u2026\"). There is simply no indication in this clearly-worded clause of a common intention of the parties to carve-out *caducidad* disputes from being resolved by way of arbitration in general or ICSID arbitration in particular.\n\n78.\n\nPlainly, Section 21 as a whole, including *a fortiori* Clause 21.4, is not about the resolution of disputes arising under the Participation Contract, be they *caducidad* -related or not. Rather, it deals with the causes and the manner in which the Participation Contract may come to an end, including by a declaration of *caducidad*. More particularly, it provides that the Participation Contract can be lawfully terminated for the reasons listed in Clause 21.1. In the event of termination resulting from *caducidad*, the Respondent is required to follow the procedure set forth in Clause 21.2. And prior to termination resulting from causes other than *caducidad*, the parties are to seek an agreement to terminate, failing which the procedures set out in Section 20 are to be followed. The Tribunal agrees with the Claimants that Section 21 is a \"very logical\" section. It consists of no more (and no less) than procedures to be followed in order to proceed to the lawful termination of the Participation Contract.\n\n79.\n\nThe Tribunal thus finds that Clause 21.4 does not consist of a carve-out of *caducidad* disputes from ICSID jurisdiction. The Tribunal observes that certain jurisdictional carve-outs are found elsewhere in the Participation Contract, such as under Clause 22.1.2, which is reproduced again as follows:\n\n\"**22.1.2.** In any claims resulting from actions or resolutions of the National Direction for Hydrocarbons, the Corresponding Minister shall be the highest administrative instance. However, Contractor shall have the right to go directly before the District Tribunal No. 1 of Administrative Law, the competent legal body to hear direct claims or to resolve appeals against the decisions of the Corresponding Ministry. In claims arising from acts or resolutions issued by the General Direction of the Internal Revenue Service, said organization shall be the higher administrative instance. After this, Contractor have the right to appeal before the Fiscal District Tribunal No. 1, the competent jurisdictional body for hearing review direct claims or resolving appeals regarding decisions made by the Minister of Finance.\" (emphasis added)\n\n80.\n\nClause 20.2.1 is yet another example of clear and unequivocal waiver language in the Participation Contract:\n\n\"**20.2.1.** Controversies that may arise from the interpretation, application and performance of this Participation Contract shall be submitted to arbitration under the law, administered by the Arbitration Centre of the Chamber of Commerce of Quito, or an international Arbitration Centre that shall be regulated by Treaties, Conventions, protocols and other actions of international Law signed and ratified by Ecuador, in accordance with the Law.\n\nIn the event of disputes between the Parties involving interpretation, application and performance in the execution of this Participation Contract, PETROECUADOR expressly waives the right to ordinary jurisdiction. \" (emphasis added)\n\n81.\n\nHad it been the parties' intention to exclude *caducidad* disputes from ICSID arbitration in favour of the exclusive jurisdiction of the Ecuadorian administrative courts, they could have very easily done so with language akin to that found in the above-quoted provisions.\n\n82.\n\nFinally, the Tribunal also recalls that in alleging that Clause 21.4 excludes *caducidad* from submission to arbitration, the Respondent has maintained that this is the inevitable consequence of the Ecuadorian law principle according to which *caducidad* decrees such as the one at issue in this arbitration carry a presumption of legality and may only be challenged before the Ecuadorian administrative courts. More particularly, the Respondent refers to Article 4 of the Ecuadorian law on Mediation and Arbitration as establishing the non-arbitrability of *caducidad* -related disputes. The Respondent's position in this regard was confirmed at the Hearing in response to questions from the Tribunal:\n\n\"ARBITRATOR STERN: If I summarise what you have just said, your position, and what you have said, is that under Ecuadorian law, in your view, an administrative act is not arbitrable?\n\nMR. SILVA: I confirm that especially in relation to Caducidad. That would be my answer.\"\n\n83.\n\nIn its closing argument, counsel for the Respondent added the following:\n\n\"It is my submission, distinguished members of the Tribunal, that it goes to the fundamental organization of the Ecuadorian State, it goes to the policies that the Ecuadorian State has adopted in relation to how the different branches of power should be organized. It goes to that very fundamental premise to say that Ecuador has decided to entrust questions in relation to administrative acts to its courts. This is important for Ecuador, because Ecuador, as I said, could eventually ask cassation against those administrative acts. Ecuador couldn't do it in arbitration.\"\n\n84.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that, as part of its closing argument at the Hearing, counsel for the Respondent admitted that Clause 21.4 does not address the resolution of *caducidad* -related disputes *per se*. According to the Respondent, this is a \"purposeful\" omission:\n\n\"Clause 21 deals with termination in general, and it states that with respect to a non-Caducidad termination, arbitration is available. It does not, however, speak to a Caducidad determination, and we believe that the omission is purposeful, and that it reflects the point of Ecuadorian law, that one cannot have arbitration with respect to Caducidad. In the entire section dealing with termination, the only right to arbitration that is recognized is the one with respect to a non-Caducidad situation. If this is not an exclusion then we point out that that reference is, in fact, redundant, because it is entirely unnecessary. Clause 20 would certainly deal with arbitration in the non-Caducidad situation.\" (emphasis added)\n\n85.\n\nThe Tribunal does not accept the Respondent's argument. The words of the tribunal in *Aguas del Tunari v. The Republic of Bolivia* (at paragraph 122) will be recalled again: \"The Tribunal will not read an ambiguous clause as an implicit waiver of ICSID jurisdiction; silence as to the question is not sufficient.\" The exception urged by the Respondent simply cannot operate by way of omission, purposeful or not.\n\n86.\n\nMore fundamentally, the Respondent cannot invoke its domestic law for the purpose of avoiding ICSID jurisdiction under the Treaty. As noted earlier, by virtue of the Treaty, the Respondent expressly consented to the submission of disputes for settlement by binding arbitration under the Washington Convention, thereby establishing the basis for this Tribunal's jurisdiction in the present circumstances. The Respondent's Constitution, at Article 163, recognizes that international treaties duly ratified by the Republic of Ecuador shall prevail over any laws in Ecuador. This was confirmed at the Hearing by the Respondent's own legal expert on Ecuadorian law when he answered questions posed to him by counsel for the Claimants:\n\n\"Q. You agree with me that pursuant to Article 163 of the constitution, in case of conflict between those duly-ratified international Treaties, on the one hand, and the arbitration law on the other hand, the provisions of the duly-ratified international Treaties shall prevail; correct?\n\nA. Yes. That is so.\n\n[\u2026]\n\nQ. Fair enough. A very simple assumption; if there was a duly-ratified Treaty that affirmatively granted jurisdiction to an Arbitral Tribunal, and the Ecuadorian arbitration law did not grant such jurisdiction because of a failure to meet certain requirements in that law, the Tribunal would still have jurisdiction pursuant to that Treaty; correct?\n\nA. In such a situation, if Ecuadorian law, as you referred to, is a law or a lower level regulation, that would be the case.\"\n\n87.\n\nThis is in fact a fulsome answer to the Respondent's allegation regarding nonarbitrability of *caducidad* -related disputes. Indeed, the Respondent acknowledged at the Hearing that it cannot invoke its domestic law for the purpose of avoiding ICSID jurisdiction under the Treaty. In its closing argument, counsel for the Respondent also argued that the \"exclusive jurisdiction principle\" according to which *caducidad* decrees may only be challenged before the Ecuadorian administrative courts is enshrined in the Ecuadorian Constitution, and that the Constitution prevails over the Treaty:\n\n\" [W]e certainly agree that where the Claimant has not executed a waiver of any sort, the state cannot use its own law to try to circumvent, or impede, the International Tribunal. We believe this case is a very different type of case because there was an explicit waiver, and that explicit waiver was that in the circumstances governed under this contract, the contractor, the investor, agreed that it could only have access to an International Tribunal under the BIT as long as that arbitration was recognized by Ecuadorian law, and one would imagine that in many, indeed most instances, there would be no conflict, since the Treaty is part of Ecuadorian law. The only instance is [ *sic* ] where it is a problem is where the constitution itself conflicts with the Treaty, and in that instance, the constitution has to take priority.\" (emphasis added)\n\n88.\n\nThe premise to this line of argument is based on a finding that the Participation Contract, be it Clause 22.2.1 or Clause 21.4, contains a clear and unequivocal waiver to ICSID jurisdiction. The Tribunal has found earlier in this Decision that no such waiver has been made under the Participation Contract. For all of these reasons, the Respondent's first jurisdictional objection is accordingly denied.\n\n89.\n\nIt follows that the Tribunal has jurisdiction over the Claimants' claims under both the Participation Contract and the Treaty. For this reason, the Respondent's submission that Claimant OPC, the \"ultimate parent\" of OEPC, lacks standing to assert claims as an investor in the circumstances because it is not a signatory to the Participation Contract is moot and need not be addressed as part of this Decision on Jurisdiction.\n\n***2. The Respondent's Second Jurisdictional Objection***\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n90.\n\nThe Tribunal will now consider the Respondent's second jurisdictional objection, *i.e.* that the Claimants failed to respect the six-month waiting period for submission of the dispute to arbitration. This waiting period is imposed by Article VI.3 of the Treaty, which states:\n\n\"Provided that the national or company concerned has not submitted the dispute for resolution under paragraph 2 (a) or (b) and that six months have elapsed from the date on which the dispute arose, the national or company concerned may choose to consent in writing to the submission of the dispute for settlement by binding arbitration.\"\n\n91.\n\nThe Tribunal notes the Respondent's acknowledgment at the Hearing that \"this is not an objection to jurisdiction that has faired extremely well in many cases. We all know that, but here we have the extreme.\" This \"extreme\" was summarized by counsel for the Respondent as follows:\n\n\"I would submit to you that they did not initiate this arbitration two days later because they had said, \"Oh, this cannot be resolved in any way, shape or form with Ecuador\", they did it for strategic purposes, they did it so they could get to a motion for provisional relief, they did it because they thought that that was the way to force themselves back into Block 15. That is what was going on, not any fair and legitimate decision that trying to discuss this and resolve this for six months was futile.\"\n\n92.\n\nIn response, the Claimants have emphasized that the very purpose of the waiting period requirement is to allow parties to enter into good faith negotiations before initiating arbitration. This requirement need not be respected if attempts at a negotiated solution have proven futile, which the Claimants contend was the case in the present circumstances.\n\n93.\n\nIn this regard, the Tribunal recalls that the *caducidad* procedure at issue in this arbitration was in fact initiated in 2004. As noted earlier, for some 18 months or so prior to the issuance of the actual *Caducidad* Decree on May 15, 2006, OEPC made a number of submissions seeking to rebut the allegations on the basis of which the *caducidad* procedure was initiated, but to no avail.9\n\nSee *supra* at paragraph 19.\n\n94.\n\nFurthermore, the Tribunal accepts, albeit without prejudging the merits, that attempts at reaching a negotiated solution were indeed futile in the circumstances.10\n\nA number of tribunals have confirmed that where negotiations are bound to be futile, there is no need for the waiting period to have fully lapsed: see *e.g.* *Lauder v. The Czech Republic,* Award dated 3 September 2001 at paragraphs 187-191. See also *Consorzio Groupement L.E.S.I. DIPENTA v. People's Democratic Republic of Algeria,* ICSID Case No. ARB/03708, Award dated 10 January 2005 at paragraph 32(iv); *SGS Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale de Surveillance S.A. v. Islamic Republic of Pakistan*, ICSID Case No. ARB/10/13, Decision on Jurisdiction dated 6 August 2003 at paragraph 184; and *Ethyl Corporation v. The Government of Canada*, Award on Jurisdiction dated 24 June 1998 at paragraph 84.\n\n95.\n\nThe Respondent's second jurisdictional objection is accordingly denied.\n\n96.\n\nFinally, it is recalled that the Respondent has requested, as part of its second jurisdictional objection, \"an order that this arbitration be stayed until OEPC challenges the *Caducidad* Decree in the competent Ecuadorian administrative court and that court issues a final ruling on such challenge\". This request is made on the basis of the allegation that the Claimants' claims are premature because the Claimants have made no attempt to challenge the *Caducidad* Decree before the Ecuadorian administrative courts. For the reasons set forth in this Decision on Jurisdiction, the Claimants were not required to do so, and this request is accordingly denied.\n\n**VI. DECISION**\n----------------\n\n97.\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, the Tribunal decides and declares as follows:\n\n(i) the Respondent's first jurisdictional objection is denied;\n\n(ii) the Respondent's second jurisdictional objection is denied;\n\n(iii) the Respondent's alternative request for \"an order that this arbitration be stayed until OEPC challenges the *Caducidad* Decree in the competent Ecuadorian administrative court and that court issues a final ruling on such challenge\" is denied; and\n\n(iv) the Tribunal has jurisdiction over both OEPC's and OPC's claims in this proceeding and the arbitral proceedings will continue to the merits phase in accordance with the calendar established in the Tribunal's Procedural Order N\u00b0. 1 as modified by Procedural Order N\u00b0. 2.\n\n98.\n\nThe costs are reserved for consideration at the conclusion of another phase of the arbitration and there shall accordingly be no order as to costs at this time."}, {"Title": "Award", "Type": "Award (Final)", "Date": "2012-10-05T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [{"Title": "Dissenting Opinion of Professor Brigitte Stern (Award)", "Type": "Dissenting Opinion", "Date": "2012-09-20T00:00:00Z", "Content": "Dissenting Opinion of Professor Brigitte Stern (Award)\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n**I. GENERAL COMMENTS**\n-----------------------\n\n1.\n\nThe present case is a very complex case to which the three members of the Tribunal have been extremely devoted during many years. Although I greatly respect and esteem my distinguished colleagues, I could not concur with them on several important legal findings. While I subscribe to the analysis of the facts and the law concluding that the Respondent acted in a disproportionate manner in its reaction to the serious violation of its laws by the Claimants, I am in complete disagreement with the way damages have been calculated, which I consider to be resting on grossly incorrect legal bases. To be accurate, I don't have a problem with figures, I have a problem with principles that were applied (or not) to reach these figures.\n\n2.\n\nAs a matter of fact, I disagree with all the answers given to what the Tribunal has called the \"four \u2018core' threshold quantum issues\" described in the following manner (\u00a7 457 of the Award):\n\nThese issues concern the impact (if any) on the Tribunal's determination of quantum of:\n\n1) The Ecuadorian Law 42;\n\n2) The Ecuadorian VAT Interpretative Law;\n\n3) The Farmout Agreement; and\n\n4) The fault of the Claimants prior to the *Caducidad* Decree.\n\n3.\n\nTo give a general overview of my main points of disagreement, I can state that they are of two different types.\n\n4.\n\nFirstly, there are - as is often encountered in a complex case as the one at stake -disagreements that would not, by themselves, have prompted me to write a dissent. On one hand, I consider that the consequence of the fault committed by the Claimants, when they violated the Ecuadorian law, is overly underestimated and insufficiently taking into account the importance that each and every State assigns to the respect of its legal order by foreign companies. On the other hand, I have a different analysis of the laws applicable in the determination of damages. These disagreements concern respectively the issues 4, 1 and 2 above.\n\n5.\n\nSecondly, there is the fundamental impossibility for me to follow the different statements in the Award relating to the effect this Tribunal should give to the Farmout Agreement. The majority's position on the effect of the Farmout Agreement is, in my view, so egregious in legal terms and so full of contradictions, that I could not but express my dissent. In my view, there are two major questionable aspects in the majority's approach to the question of the effectiveness of the Farmout Agreement: the first is the analysis of the question of the effectiveness of a legal act under Ecuadorian law, which is based on a total lack of reasons, with the consequence that I was not able to follow the \"reasoning\" from point A to point B, as well as gross errors of law in the purported interpretation of the content of Ecuadorian law; the second, which in my view is even a more serious matter, is the manifest excess of power of the Award nullifying a contract concerning a company which not only was not a party to the arbitration, but moreover -even if it had been a party- could not be considered, being a Chinese company, as an investor over which the Tribunal had jurisdiction under the US/Ecuador BIT.\n\n6.\n\nI will therefore concentrate my remarks on the way the majority dealt with the consequences of the Farmout Agreement on the calculation of damages and only briefly state my position beforehand on the other topics.\n\n6 (bis).\n\nAs a last general note, I indicate that I wrote my dissent based on a version sent to me that my two co-arbitrators indicated they were ready to sign. After I send them my dissent, I was informed that some clarifications needed to be made to parts of the Award. As I did not want to enter into an endless process, I did not myself change my dissent, which could explain some discrepancies, if any, between the wording of the Dissenting opinion and the wording of the Award.\n\n**1. The consequence of the fault of the Claimants**\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n7.\n\nI consider that the contribution of the Claimants to the damage has been overly underestimated, as the Claimants deliberately took the risk of *caducidad* by their behaviour - meaning that *caducidad* could happen or not happen, and there were indeed more chances that it could happen than not, considering the text of the law and the reference to *caducidad* in the contract. It is interesting to note that in the *MTD* case both the tribunal and the ad hoc committee1 have endorsed a 50/50 split on the sole ground that the claimant had acted imprudently from a business point of view though not illegally. Here the split 50/50 would have been even more justified, as the Claimants have acted both very imprudently and illegally. This critique of the majority's position, however, is not based on an error of law or an excess of power, but on a different appreciation of the factual situation, which is at the discretion of the Tribunal.\n\n*MTD Equity Sdn. Bhd. & MTD Chile S.A. v. Republic of Chile* (ICSID Case No. ARB/01/7) (Malaysia/Chile BIT), Award, 25 May 2004, \u00a7\u00a7 242-243 and *MTD Equity Sdn. Bhd. & MTD Chile S.A. v. Republic of Chile* (ICSID Case No. ARB/01/7) (Malaysia/Chile BIT), Decision on Annulment, 21 March 2007, \u00a7 101. It can also be mentioned here, that the same 50/50 split was made in *Bogdanov*, where the Claimant claimed 62102 lei and the tribunal awarded 31000 lei, just because the investor was not cautious enough. *Iurii Bogdanov, Agurdino-Invest Ltd. and Agurdino-Chimia JSC v. Republic of Moldova*, SCC (Russia/Moldova BIT), Arbitral Award, 22 September 2005, p. 19.\n\n8.\n\nAs a result of the foregoing, I consider that a fair and reasonable apportionment of responsibility between the Claimants and the Respondent should more appropriately have been a 50/50 split.\n\n**2. The analysis of Law 42**\n-----------------------------\n\n9.\n\nAs a background remark, I note that it is generally admitted that sovereign States have a broad discretion when they exercise their fiscal powers. Let me only cite here a case rendered under another BIT entered into by Ecuador, where this was underscored in the following terms:\n\n... foreign investments like other activities are subject to the taxes and charges imposed by the host State. In the absence of a specific commitment from the State, the foreign investor has neither the right nor any legitimate expectation that the tax regime will not change, perhaps to its disadvantage, during the period of the investment.\" (Emphasis added)2\n\nIt is indeed uncontroversial that, absent a fiscal stabilization clause in a contract, nothing prevents a State to participate in the benefits of a changed economic situation, stemming out of its inalienable natural resources. Windfall profit taxes are commonly-used measures to adjust the division of revenues from natural resources between States and private companies.\n\n*EnCana Corporation v. Republic of Ecuador*, LCIA Case No. UN3481, UNCITRAL (Canada/Ecuador BIT), Award, 3 February 2006, \u00a7 173.\n\n10.\n\nBut, for the majority, Law 42 is a not a tax or a levy. This seems however in contradiction with the qualification given by the majority to Law 42 as \"a unilateral decision of the Ecuadorian Congress to allocate to the Ecuadorian State a defined percentage of the revenues earned by contractor companies\" (\u00a7 510 of the Award), which, in my modest understanding, describes exactly what a tax or a levy does. Moreover, in order to reach the conclusion that Law 42 violated the Participation Contract, the majority based such finding on a confusion between participation in volumes and participation in revenues and concluded therefore that Law 42 was in violation of Clause 8.1 providing for the participation of the contractor in the volume of oil extracted, as well as in violation of Clause 5.3.2, which grants to the contractor a right of free disposal of the volumes of oil attributed under Clause 8.1.\n\n11.\n\nI would have reasoned completely differently on both counts. Firstly, I cannot admit that Law 42 is a violation of Clauses 8.1 and 5.3.2, as Law 42 is dealing with a different issue than the ones regulated by the Participation Contract. It is not because the word \"participation\" is used in both expressions that participation in volumes means the same as participation in revenues! Lawyers ought to be rigorous and not to use one term for the other and one concept for another. Law 42 itself in its Article 2, makes the distinction:\n\n... Contractor companies... without prejudice to the volume of crude oil subject to participation that correspond to them... will recognize in favor of the Ecuadorian state a participation of at least 50% of the extraordinary income generated by the difference in price.\n\n12.\n\nMoreover, considering that Law 42 is evidently a tax3, I would have analyzed whether such modification in the general taxation violated Clauses 8.6 and 11.11, which are definitely not stabilization clauses but renegotiation clauses.4 And I would have concluded that there is no violation, as a law permitting the contractor to benefit from 50% of unexpected profits does not impact on \"the economy of the contract\", which was based on a long-term projection at the time of the signature of the contract of an expected 15 dollar price, according to the Claimants' expert, Mr. Albuja himself.5\n\nThis can indeed be supported by analyses of what is a tax made by other international arbitration tribunals, especially in three cases against Ecuador. Suffice it to cite the case of *Burlington*, in which the tribunal, dealing with the same BIT and the same Law 42, declared: \"The Tribunal concludes that Law 42 is a tax.\", *Burlington Resources Inc. and others v. Republic of Ecuador* (ICSID Case No. ARB/08/5) (US/Ecuador BIT), Decision on Jurisdiction, 2 June 2010, \u00a7 167. See also, *EnCana Corporation v. Republic of Ecuador*, LCIA Case No. UN3481, UNCITRAL (Canada/Ecuador BIT), Award, 3 February 2006, \u00a7 173 and *Duke Energy Electroquil Partners & Electroquil S.A. v. Republic of Ecuador* (ICSID Case No. ARB/04/19) (US/Ecuador BIT), Award, 18 August 2008, \u00a7 174.\n\nSee Clause 8.6. **Economic stability.** In the event that, due to actions taken by the State of Ecuador or PETROECUADOR, any of the events described below occur **and** have an impact on the economy of this Participation Contract : a. Modification of the tax regime as described in clause 11.11. [...] e. Collection of the Value Added Tax, VAT, as set forth in Official Letter No. 01044 of October 5, 1998, which appears as annex number XVI, pursuant to which the Directorate of Internal Revenue Service states that the imports made by the contractor for the operations of Block 15 under the structure of the participation contract, are subject to said tax. In the cases indicated in letters a) and b), the Parties shall enter into amending contracts as indicated in clause 15.2, in order to re-establish the economy of this Participation Contract. When the events indicated in letters c), d), and e) occur, a correction factor shall be included in the participation percentages, to absorb the increase or decrease of the economic burden, in accordance with Annex No. XIV. (Emphasis added)\n\nTo be noted the testimony of Mr. Albuja, on which the majority relies for other conclusions, to the effect that \"at the time of the negotiations the market price was well below the constant price that we were instructed to assume for the purpose of the negotiations. Specifically, Petroecuador had required that the parties project future cash flows on the assumption of a constant price of $15 per barrel for Block 15 crude oil.\" (Emphasis added)\n\n13.\n\nAs a result of the foregoing, I consider that Law 42 should have been taken into account in the calculation of damages**.**\n\n**3. The analysis of the VAT Interpretative Law**\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n14.\n\nAnalyzing the consequences of the VAT Interpretative Law on the Participation Contract, the Award again establishes a confusion between two different things - an increase of the VAT and an impact on the economy of the contract - when stating (\u00a7 568 of the Award) that \"(t)here is no doubt, in the view of the Tribunal, that the VAT Interpretative Law has thereby increased the economic burden of the Claimants and thus impacted the economy of the Participation Contract.\" (Emphasis added). I consider that it follows from a reading of Clauses 8.66 that, contrary to what is implied by the majority's position, not every collection of VAT has *ipso facto* an impact on the economy of the contract. Such impact had to be analyzed, which the majority did not do. Without entering in a lengthy discussion, it appears to me7 that the fact that the law did not refund VAT and that this was not compensated by a modification in the percentages of participation in the volumes does not appear to be a violation of the Participation Contract.\n\nSee note 4 above\n\nI am comforted in this analysis of the limited impact of the VAT issues by the holdings of the tribunal concerning the same VAT in *EnCana Corporation v. Republic of Ecuador*, LCIA Case No. UN3481, UNCITRAL (Canada/Ecuador BIT), Award, 3 February 2006, \u00a7 174: \"There is nothing in the record which suggest that the change in VAT laws or their interpretation brought the companies to a standstill or rendered the value to be derived from their activities so marginal or unprofitable as effectively to deprive them of their character as investments.\"\n\n15.\n\nAs a result of the foregoing, I consider that the VAT Interpretative Law should have been taken into account in the calculation of damages**.**\n\n**4. The different issues raised by the Farmout Agreement**\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n16.\n\nI will now turn to my main concern, which indeed prompted me to write this dissenting opinion, which is related to the way the majority dealt with the consequences of the Farmout Agreement.\n\n17.\n\nTo deal exhaustively with this extremely complex and crucial issue, I will follow a four step analysis. In order to fully understand what was the essence and effect of the Farmout Agreement, there are two key issues, raised at two different moments in time, one issue at the time of the performance of the Farmout Agreement, one issue at the moment of *caducidad*.\n\n18.\n\nTo start with, it is indeed of crucial importance to fully understand what were the respective entitlements of OEPC and AEC under the Farmout Agreement, when it was entered into by the two parties. I will therefore start with a first question in order to understand \" what was the effect of the signature of the Farmout Agreement on OEPC's rights? \"(1) and summarize under this heading the main findings of the Award with which I agree, to the effect that the essence of the Farmout Agreement was to transfer rights and not only to establish contractual liabilities. The whole structure of the Award, especially the finding that the Claimants committed a violation of Ecuadorian law, is based on this crucial analysis.\n\n19.\n\nThe next issue that had to be decided by the Tribunal was whether these entitlements have been modified on the occurrence of *caducidad*... This question in fact has to be further divided.\n\n20.\n\nA first step is to determine what are the conditions - under the appropriate law - for an act to be considered inexistent or null and void and what are the legal modalities of such a finding. I will therefore examine whether or not under New York law and/or Ecuadorian law the concepts of inexistence or absolute nullity are applicable and in which cases the intervention of a judge to make such a finding is required. In doing so, I will answer the following question: \" Can the Farmout Agreement be considered inexistent or automatically null and void on the occurrence of *caducidad?* *\"* (2)\n\n21.\n\nA second step, as it is not contested that no New York or Ecuadorian judge has declared the Farmout Agreement to be null and void, is of course to determine whether this ICSID Tribunal could - as has been done in the Award - annul the assignment of rights effectuated through the Farmout Agreement. In other words, it is imperative to deal with the following crucial interrogation: \" Could the Farmout Agreement be considered inexistent or null and void on the occurrence of *caducidad* by this ICSID Tribunal? \" (3)\n\n22.\n\nThis could be the end of the analysis, but I consider it important to state in this dissenting opinion what should have been, in my view, the right way to deal with the matter in view of the applicable principles of public international law, had the majority not decided as it has in violation of these principles. The answer to this last inquiry will be the following: \" Had the majority not exceeded its powers in annulling Andes' rights, the Tribunal could only have granted 60% of the damages to the Claimants, in conformity with the principles of international law.\"\n\n**II. THE ANALYSIS OF THE FARMOUT AGREEMENT**\n---------------------------------------------\n\n23.\n\nAs an introductory remark, I want to indicate that the two first questions I will be dealing with here - *i.e*... \"What was the effect of the signature of the Farmout Agreement on OEPC's rights?\" and \"Can the Farmout Agreement be considered inexistent or automatically null and void on the occurrence of *caducidad* ?\" - are independent the one from the other. One thing is to know whether or not the legal situation created by the Farmout Agreement transferred rights or created only liabilities. This question is decisive in order to determine whether the Claimants have violated the Ecuadorian law. The Tribunal has unambiguously and unanimously stated that the effect of the Farmout Agreement was indeed to transfer rights and therefore that the Claimants had violated the law, as this operation was done without the required ministerial authorization. I stress here that the Tribunal has clearly stated that the transfer of rights was the essence of the Farmout Agreement. The second thing was to decide whether such transfer of rights was inexistent or automatically null, in other words whether the situation created by the Farmout Agreement - the transfer of rights - continued or not after *caducidad*... The majority has given a strange answer to that question: it stated that the initial situation of a transfer of rights has automatically ceased to exist by application of Article 79 of the HLC, but has at the same time stated that a liability of the Claimants towards Andes remains. As there was no such liability in the first place, these two aspects of the majority position are, in my view, contradictory.\n\n**1. What was the effect of the signature of the Farmout Agreement on OEPC's rights?**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n24.\n\nThis question has been abundantly discussed in the Award, which has come to the conclusion that rights under the Participation Agreement have indeed been transferred. As the Claimants have insisted, in their last submissions, that the Farmout Agreement only created a \"Farmout liability\" - a term that was not used in their first submissions and can be found nowhere in the Farmout Agreement - I will revisit briefly the main conclusions of the Tribunal on this issue, with which I agree and elaborate on their consequences.\n\n25.\n\nWhile the Claimants indeed consider that the only thing that AEC acquired is a \"Farmout liability\" *i.e.* \"a contractual right to claim a certain share of production from OEPC\", the Respondent contends that the Claimants only invented this term in order to take advantage of the *Chorz\u00f3w Factory* dictum, but that in reality there exists no such thing as a \"Farmout liability\" and consequently that the Claimants are only entitled to claim for an interference with 60% of their remaining rights, the other 40% having been transferred to AEC through the Farmout Agreement.\n\n26.\n\nThe Claimants' position is based on the analysis of the entitlements of AEC as a *claim* toward OEPC or a *credit* toward OEPC, the latter being considered as having a *liability* towards AEC8, and on the analysis according to which the Farmout Agreement did not give AEC any rights under the Participation Contract or ownership rights in the oil. The Respondent's position is the reverse. This was clearly expressed by Professor Pierre Mayer in the February 2010 hearing: \"AEC/Andes is not a mere creditor. It is the owner of an economic interest in the Farmout Property. Farmout Property means the Participation Contract.\"9\n\nIt should be noted that in French the word \" *liability* \" in the ICJ decision is translated by \" *passif.* \" There is no way to consider that the rights acquired by AEC in full payment of its 40% share of the expenses on Block 15 could be considered as a \" *passif* \" of OEPC.\n\nHearing Transcript (4 February 2010), p. 199, lines 20-21 and p. 200, line 1.\n\n27.\n\nThe Tribunal has not accepted the Claimants' contention that what AEC acquired was a mere contractual right implying a liability of OEPC towards them. It is not because the rights have been transferred by contract that they amount only to a contractual liability. A liability implies that you have to transfer something at some point in time, and here the Tribunal has come to the clear conclusion that the transfer of 40% of the economic rights in the Participation Contract has been fully executed. In fact, the rights were transferred immediately - on Closing - and during a certain time, AEC - and not OEPC - had a liability towards OEPC relating to the scheduled payments. These obligations of AEC towards OEPC were fulfilled at the beginning of the year 2004, before the event of *caducidad*.\n\n28.\n\nThe Tribunal indeed has considered that rights in the Participation Contract have been transferred. In other words, as the situation stood at the moment of the *Caducidad* Decree, the rights under the Participation Contract were owned for 60% by OEPC and for 40% by AEC/Andes, *i.e*... at the time of *caducidad*, OEPC had only a right of ownership of 60% of the production of oil, having sold to AEC/Andes a right of ownership of 40% of the production of oil.\n\n29.\n\nThese conclusions of the Tribunal are rooted in a series of simple findings, based on the texts of the different agreements entered into (i), as well as on the economic factors of the deal between OEPC and AEC (ii).\n\n(i) First finding: The Farmout Agreement and the JOA clearly state that part of the rights belongs to OEPC and part to AEC\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n30.\n\nIt suffices here to quote Article 2.02 of the Farmout Agreement:\n\nAs between OEPC and AECI, AECI upon Closing,... shall be entitled to the rights and benefits attributable to such Farmout Interest... in the same manner and to the same extent as if AECI held legal title to a 40% economic interest as a participant in the Farmout property... Likewise, as between OEPC and AECI,... upon Closing, OEPC... shall be entitled to the rights and benefits attributable to the remaining 60% interest in the Farmout Property.\n\n31.\n\nAnd at the end of this Article, OEPC is described as \" the owner of such remaining 60% interest \" (Emphasis added), which necessarily implies that it is not the owner of the other 40%. Here it is clearly stated that OEPC, for its own account, is only entitled to \"the rights and benefits attributable to such remaining 60% interest.\" This has been clearly explained by the Tribunal in \u00a7\u00a7 301-303 and 330-331 of the Award.\n\n32.\n\nThe same conclusion has to be drawn from the terms of Clause 3.3.1 of the Joint Operating Agreement which states that \" all the rights and interests in and under the Participating Agreements, all Joint Property and any Petroleum and any Petroleum produced from the Agreement Area shall, subject to the terms of the Participating Agreements, be owned by the Parties in accordance with their respective Participating Interests \" (Emphasis added). It results from this clear wording that AEC owns rights, more precisely rights to 40 % of the Block 15 property and rights to 40 % of the past extracted oil - which it had indeed received, and rights to 40% of the future extracted oil or the compensation of this future oil in case it cannot receive it, and that OEPC has no liabilities towards AEC, the relevant rights having been transferred.\n\n(ii) Second finding: the economic aspects demonstrate that OEPC has already been fully paid for the transfer of the right to 40% of the economic interest\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n33.\n\nIt is common ground that AEC agreed to pay 40% of all the CAPEX and OPEX in developing Block 1510, in exchange of its acquisition of 40% of the economic rights in the Participation Contract. In other words, AEC did acquire by paying for it, 40% of the economic interest in the Farmout Property. The Claimants have never denied having received large sums of money in order to convey to AEC this economic interest, which means that they no longer own this part of the rights under the Participation Contract.\n\nFor the exact figures, see \u00a7\u00a7 132-133 of the Award.\n\n34.\n\nThe fact that OEPC has definitely lost the economic benefits of 40% of the Participation Contract's rights is also apparent in the fact that it had no means to recover 40% of the value of its economic interest that was definitely given to AEC. It should be remembered that nothing was provided for in the Farmout Agreement, in case there would be no transfer of legal title, for any reason. This state of fact, giving a definitive right to the oil, a definitive ownership of a percentage of the oil produced to AEC, has been confirmed by M. Derman, a witness for the Claimants in the December 2008 hearing:11\n\nQ. Now, Mr. Derman, I understand that - I believe you said earlier, and you confirm now, that it's your understanding that if the government had not approved the transfer of legal title after Oxy had repaid its earning obligations - excuse me, after AEC had paid its earning obligations, AEC would simply remain indefinitely as the holder of an economic interest with an entitlement to oil going forward.\n\nB. That's right. (Emphasis added)\n\nHearing Transcript (19 December 2008), Day 7, pp. 1687, lines 20-22 and 1688, lines 1-6.\n\n35.\n\nIn other words, in the absence of *caducidad*, OEPC could not have claimed the rights to 40% of the oil back. Why could it claim these 40% with *caducidad* ?\n\n36.\n\nAs a consequence, a major portion of the amounts invested in Block 15 was contributed by another entity than the Claimants (AEC, now Andes). It is uncontested that the Tribunal has recognized that rights have been transferred to AEC, these having been later transferred to Andes. I do not see how it would be possible to grant damages pertaining to rights that no longer belong to the Claimants, without disregarding the basic rules of international law.\n\n37.\n\nFor all these reasons explained in the Award, but which have been reiterated in this opinion, in order to dispel any confusion introduced by the late reference by the Claimants to a \"Farmout liability\", the Tribunal has concluded that, through the Farmout Agreement, the Claimants actually transferred 40% of theirs rights under the Participation Contract to AEC, conclusion with which I concur.\n\n38.\n\nIt is undisputed that Andes, following the implementation of the Farmout Agreement and the subsequent sale of AEC's 40% economic interest in the Participation Contract, has become - and still is12 - the owner of 40% of the rights and obligations in and under the Participation Contract.\n\nAt least, was until the rendering of this Award.\n\n39.\n\nThe question remains whether this situation has changed on the occurrence of *caducidad.*\n\n**2. Can the Farmout Agreement be considered inexistent or automatically null and void on the occurrence of** ***caducidad*****? Substantive aspects**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n40.\n\nIn other words, the issue that must be discussed is whether this transfer could be considered as inexistent or null and void by this Tribunal on the occurrence of *caducidad*, by application of New York and/or Ecuadorian laws. The majority has given a positive answer to this question. It has therefore granted damages to the Claimants as if they had never entered into the Farmout Agreement and as if this Agreement had not been fully executed, as far as the payments from AEC to the Claimants for the acquisition of their proprietary rights are concerned.\n\n41.\n\nA first question is whether, under the application of the relevant law, inexistence or nullity resulting from an absence of authorization is automatic or has to be decided by a national court. This question will be dealt with in this section. A second and fundamental issue is whether, in the absence either of an automatic inexistence or nullity or of a declaration by a national court, this Tribunal was empowered to declare such inexistence or nullity, an issue that will be examined in the next section.\n\n42.\n\nThe most significant issue to emerge from the parties' submissions of November 2011 in answer to the Tribunal's questions of October 2011 is whether the assignment of rights under the Farmout Agreement would be automatically inexistent or null and void or whether a judicial declaration is required. The central question is thus: is the inexistence or nullity automatic under the applicable law or does it have to be decided by a national court?\n\n43.\n\nIn order to answer this question, there must first be a determination of the applicable law. I quote here again, for the ease of reference, the governing law clause, which is to be found in the Farmout Agreement:\n\nThis Agreement shall be governed by and construed, interpreted and applied in accordance with the laws of the State of New York, United States of America, excluding any choice of law rules or conflict of law principles which would refer the matter to the laws of another jurisdiction, except to the extent that the laws of Ecuador require application of the laws of Ecuador to the Participating Agreements and Block 15 or other property situated in or operations or activities conducted in Ecuador.\n\n44.\n\nAlthough I have some doubts on the applicability of Ecuadorian law under this clause,13 I will accept, for the sake of an exhaustive analysis, the Award's approach -following the apparently common understanding of the parties - to the effect that \"the application of New York and Ecuadorian law is relevant to whether the assignment was valid\" (\u00a7 616 of the Award) and examine the situation under both legal orders, as has been done by the majority. In fact, in my view, the controversy on the applicable law is of limited interest as the solution is the same whether New York law or Ecuadorian law is applied. What differs is the answer given by the majority and my own answer. The majority considers that under both legal orders there is an automatic cancellation of the assignment performed through the Farmout Agreement, because such contract has to be considered inexistent or at least automatically null and void. To the contrary, I consider that under both legal orders, inexistence is not relevant in the circumstances and that a nullity resulting from an absence of authorization has to be declared by a judge. In presenting my own analysis of the relevant legal documents, I will demonstrate that the majority, in order to arrive at an opposite conclusion, used not the real Ecuadorian law but an inexistent and inchoate body of law. Before analyzing these two bodies of law, it is apposite to briefly summarize the positions of the two parties.\n\nBut will not expand on the reasoning that raised such doubts in order to keep an acceptable length to this opinion.\n\n45.\n\nThe Claimants in fact provide two arguments, one under Ecuadorian law - their main position being that Ecuadorian law is applicable - the other under New York law, if it were to apply, both argumentation reaching the same conclusion that the Farmout Agreement has to be considered null and void by this Tribunal. The Claimants contend the following as concerns the nullity of the Farmout Agreement:\n\n1. Under Ecuadorian law, it is automatically and mandatorily null and void by operation of Article 79(1) HCL.\n\n2. Under New York law, it would be unenforceable and without effect.\n\n46.\n\nThe Respondent considers that whether under New York law - its main position being that New York law is applicable - or under Ecuadorian law, if it were to apply, the Farmout Agreement has to be considered as valid and binding, as inexistence is not relevant and nullity is not automatic and no jurisdiction, neither a New York court, nor an Ecuadorian court has declared such nullity.\n\n47.\n\nThe majority has concluded that the Farmout Agreement has to be construed and interpreted by application of Ecuadorian law and that under this law it is either inexistent or automatically null, but has also stated that the same result follows from the application of New York law.\n\n48.\n\nI will here accept the two hypotheses of the application of New York law and Ecuadorian law. And I will demonstrate - both under New York and Ecuadorian law -that on the one hand, inexistence is a concept of restrictive use14 and could not apply to a case of absence of authorization and that on the other hand, absolute nullity has always to be declared by a court. I will examine successively what is the solution if New York law is applied (i) and what is the solution if Ecuadorian law is applied (ii), which will lead to the general conclusion relating to the question raised in this point (iii).\n\nCertainly a concept of restrictive use under Ecuadorian law, if it exists at all under New York law, a question to which a negative answer seems to have to be given, at least on the basis of the submissions of the parties and the documentation provided.\n\n(i) Under New York law\n----------------------\n\n49.\n\nIt should be recalled that the Farmout Agreement is in any case primarily subject to New York law and that Ecuadorian law, if applicable, could only be so by reference. Looking first at New York law, it is worth noting that the Claimants themselves do not argue that the assignment would be null and void, but rather that it would be \"unenforceable and without effect.\" It appears to me that, by definition, enforcement needs the intervention of a judge.\n\n50.\n\nRespondent considers that \"New York law contains no requirement that would oblige its courts to render Claimants' illegal assignment of rights under the Participation Contract to AEC void.\"15 But, the most useful part of the Respondent's presentation is the statement that under New York law a contract has to be declared null and that such nullity cannot be automatic:\n\nFurthermore, under New York law, a private contract (such as the Farmout Agreement and the Joint Operating Agreement) is not invalidated unless one of the parties initiates legal proceedings to invalidate the contract. Contract invalidation is not a self-executing procedure under New York law. Here, it is undisputed that neither party to the Farmout Agreement or the Joint Operating Agreement has sought such relief. Therefore, the Farmout Transaction must be considered valid under New York law.\"16\n\nRespondent's Brief of 3 November 2011, \u00a7 58.\n\nRespondent's Brief of 3 November 2011, \u00a7 62.\n\n51.\n\nThis has not been refuted by the Claimants, as their main contention is to explain what the New York courts would do, which imply that they accept the necessary intervention of the courts in order to declare the nullity or inexistence of a contract or a legal act. A few examples of this approach can be given here, but there are others:\n\nBecause the assignment never happened under Ecuadorian law, a New York court applying the parties' choice of law clause would hold that the Farmout Agreement and the Operating Agreement, which was subject to the Farmout Agreement, did not in fact make any assignment.17...\n\n... a New York cour t would not give effect to an assignment of rights in the Participation Contract done without Ministerial authorization if such authorization were required.18\n\nUnder [Article 7.02 of the Farmout Agreement], a New York court would recognize that under Ecuadorian law, the assignment \"does not exist.\"19\n\nEcuador completely ignores the reference in Article 7.02 of the Farmout Agreement to Ecuadorian law determining rights under the Participation Contract. Under this provision, a New York court would give effect to Article 79 HCL by declaring any attempted assignment in the Farmout or Operating Agreements to be null and void.20 (Emphasis added in all the paragraphs)\n\nClaimants' Brief of 3 November 2011, \u00a7 17\n\nClaimants' Brief of 3 November 2011, \u00a7 22\n\nClaimants' Reply Brief of 22 November 2011, \u00a7 3.\n\nClaimants' Reply Brief of 22 November 2011, \u00a7 22.\n\n52.\n\nThe majority's position is to the same effect, as it considers that \" New York courts would give effect to such laws, including the HCL, when considering the validity of the assignment.\"(\u00a7 646 of the Award. (Emphasis added)) and concludes the examination of New York law in the following manner:\n\nNew York courts commonly apply foreign laws where the relevant contractual provision so provides, and there is no reason to suggest that they would fail to do so in relation to the Farmout Agreement which requires the application of Article 79 of the HCL. (\u00a7 646 of the Award. Emphasis added)\n\n53.\n\nI have seen nowhere in the record that contract invalidation is a self-executing procedure under New York law. Looking then at the conditions of \"absolute nullity\", under which a contract could be considered to be \"null and void\" under New York, I consider that, should the matter come before a New York court, it might be that a judge might declare the assignment void, by application of Article 79 of the HCL. But this is an entirely different story than an automatic nullity. What is incontrovertible is that no New York judge has declared the Farmout Agreement to be null and void.\n\n54.\n\nTo sum up, the majority has not argued that there is a concept of inexistence in New York law, nor that there is an automatic nullity, such nullity having to be declared by a court. I do not disagree with such findings, although I did not quite see what conclusion the majority reached from these statements as far as the continuing validity of the Farmout Agreement was concerned.\n\n55.\n\nAs a result of the foregoing, I conclude that, under New York law which is the law of the contract, the Farmout Agreement having not been invalidated by a New York court, should have been considered as still in force and binding.\n\n(ii) Under Ecuadorian law\n-------------------------\n\n56.\n\nIn a nutshell, the Claimants have mainly argued that this is a case of absolute nullity, and subsidiarily that it is a case of inexistence, but that none of these two categories require the intervention of a judge. The Respondent, on its part, has argued that the category of inexistence does not exist in the Ecuadorian legal system and that this is a case of absolute nullity requiring the intervention of a judge. The majority appears to have followed a third road, arguing principally that this is a case of inexistence and adding very shortly, in two paragraphs (\u00a7 629 and \u00a7 634 of the Award), that it could also be a case of absolute nullity, but that this is equivalent to inexistence, as, according to my colleagues, absolute nullity does not need a declaration by a judge under Ecuadorian law.\n\n57.\n\nReferring principally to Ecuadorian law, which the Claimants considers applicable under the choice of law clause of the Farmout Agreement, the Claimants in their Brief of 3 November 2011 have argued that the nullity provided for in Article 79(1) of the HCL is automatic and mandatory, without even mentioning in this first submission the legal category of \"inexistence.\" The Respondent, to the contrary, in its Brief of 3 November 2011, stated that under Articles 1698 and 1699 of the Ecuadorian Civil Code, the lack of ministerial authorization for the assignment creates an \"absolute nullity\" which is not automatic (*de pleno derecho*) and requires a judicial declaration in order to have effect. This statement is mainly based on the reiterated fact that absolute nullity has to be declared by a judge. The Respondent invokes, as just mentioned, Articles 1698 and 1699 of the Ecuadorian Civil Code which provide:\n\nArticle 1698\n\nThe nullity produced by illicit object or illicit cause, and the nullity produced by the omission of any requirement or formality which the law demands for certain acts and contracts to be **valid**, in consideration to their nature, and not to the quality or status of the persons who execute or agree to them, are absolute nullities.\n\nArticle 1699\n\nThe absolute nullity can and shall be declared by the judge, even if no party so requests, when it manifestly arises from the act or contract; it may be claimed by anyone having an interest to do so, excepting those who have performed the act or contract knowing or under the duty to know the vice invalidating it; it may also be claimed by the Public Ministry, for the benefit of morals or of the law; and it cannot be cured by ratification of the parties, nor by the passing of a period of time of less than fifteen years. (Emphasis added in the two articles)\n\n58.\n\nThese articles seem to be crystal clear as regards two important points: the absence of a requirement or formality required for validity entails absolute nullity; absolute nullity has to be declared by a judge.\n\n59.\n\nIt might be apposite to quote here Article 79 of the HCL used as the basis for the declaration of the inexistence of the Farmout Agreement by the majority (\u00a7 626 of the Award). This article reads:\n\nArticle 79.\n\nThe transfer of a contract or the assignment to third parties of rights derived from a contract shall be null and void and shall have no validity whatsoever if there is no prior authorization from the Ministry of Energy and Mines, without prejudice to the declaration of caducidad as provided for in this Law. (Emphasis added)\n\n60.\n\nAccording to this Article, the authorisation is required for the validity of the act. Considering the two articles 1698 and 1699 just quoted, it appears with the utmost clarity, that the absence of a requirement necessary for the validity of the transfer entails absolute nullity and that such absolute nullity has to be declared by a judge.\n\n61.\n\nWhile stating that the assignment is not null and void until an Ecuadorian judge has declared it so, the Respondent however added in its Brief of 3 November 2011 that Ecuadorian law does not include the concept of inexistence:\n\nEcuadorian law has not adopted the notion of \"inexistence\" of acts or contracts. What is called \"inexistence of acts or contracts\" in some jurisdictions is, under Ecuadorian law, encompassed within the notion of \"nullity\", and shall always be declared by a judge.21\n\nRespondent Brief of 3 November 2011, \u00a7 79.\n\n62.\n\nThe Claimants, in their 22 November 2012 Submission, apparently discovering the possible existence of the concept of inexistence in Ecuadorian law from the Respondent's brief, answered by stating that the Respondent was wrong on this account and that the present situation indeed does not fall within the category of absolute nullity, but within a separate category termed \"inexistence.\" The legal concept of \"inexistence\" of a contract means that such contract must be considered by everyone as automatically null and void, with no judicial declaration required. According to the Claimants, the Farmout Agreement lacked an essential element required for \"life\" and was therefore \"inexistent\" under Article 1745 of the Ecuadorian Civil Code. As such, no judicial declaration was required.\n\n63.\n\nIn order to bring some clarity to this question, I will first attempt to follow the different statements made by the majority on the issue (\u00a7\u00a7 617-635 of the Award).\n\n64.\n\nTo begin with, it should be noted that the majority seems to have made up its mind before any serious analysis of the Ecuadorian texts and decisions involved. Already in the third paragraph of the developments devoted to Ecuadorian law, after citing Article 79 of the HCL, the majority prematurely concludes:\n\nOn its face, therefore, the assignment that purportedly occurred under the Farmout Agreement was invalid. The assignment therefore had no legal effect and OEPC retained 100% of both the legal and beneficial ownership of all rights in the Participation Contract. (\u00a7 619 of the Award. Emphasis added)\n\n65.\n\nTo conclude before analysis just \"on the face\" of an article could be acceptable if a subsequently presented analysis were to confirm such conclusion. But I will show that this is not the case, trying to follow step by step the different statements made by the majority, which I will treat separately as I was not able to follow the path from one statement to the other and could not understand the logic behind them.\n\n66.\n\nFollowing their initial statement, the majority purported to analyze four decisions of the Ecuadorian Supreme Court provided to the Tribunal by the parties in order to ascertain the applicable rule, stating:\n\nIt is common ground between the parties that when the Ecuadorian Supreme Court has issued three consistent decisions on a precise point, the law on that point is considered settled and becomes binding on lower courts. It becomes what, in some jurisdictions, is referred to as a \" *jurisprudence constante*.\" (\u00a7 622 of the Award)\n\n67.\n\nAfter several readings, I could not trace what \"precise point\" came out of this purported *jurisprudence constante*... As a matter of fact, I will demonstrate that, in my view, a fair and thorough reading of the decisions of the Supreme Court, in their original language, belies completely the findings of the majority.\n\n68.\n\nFirst, I want to point to the selective use of citations from the decisions of the Supreme Court made by the majority, as well as serious problems of translation, although those have not been acknowledged by the majority in the Award. I will complete the analysis on both counts.\n\n69.\n\nIt should be recalled, for the sake of clarity, that the Tribunal was provided with four decisions of the Supreme Court:\n\n- C-662: a decision of 16 May 2001\n\n- C-659: a decision of 7 June 2001\n\n- C-660: a decision of 29 August 2001\n\n- C-658: a decision of 20 February 2002\n\n70.\n\nIn fact, reading further into the paragraphs of the Award devoted to the question of the efficiency of the Farmout Agreement, I have been unable to understand what is the law that the majority has applied: it cited those four cases dealing with contracts, and relied on them, while at the same time warning that \"applying a contractual analysis is inappropriate.\" (\u00a7 627 of the Award) But then what rules of law were applied? The answer of the majority is simply the following: \"Instead, [instead of applying a contractual analysis as was supposedly done in the analyzed decisions] this Tribunal must consider the essential elements for the assignment to have life.\" This looks like a rule whose content was invented by the majority, which is certainly not part of the Ecuadorian legal order, apparently in order to avoid taking into account what the cited decisions referring to \"the essential elements for the assignment to have life\" precisely meant by these \"essentials elements.\" The majority's approach can be described as a *proprio motu* determination of what the majority considered to be an essential element, a determination completely disconnected from the legal order in which these essential elements have been precisely and restrictively defined.\n\n71.\n\nStrangely too, the majority has focused on the first and third decision. In doing so, it selected some extracts but did not quote the remainder of the decisions which explains and clarifies what is stated in the extracts in a different way than the interpretation given by the majority. I will revert to a complete analysis of these two cases.\n\n72.\n\nMoreover, the majority has not discussed the second and fourth cases, just mentioning their existence and merely stating, and I quote:\n\nThe parties also provided the Tribunal with the Supreme Court decisions of 7 June 2001 and 20 February 2002, both of which reaffirm the categories of \"inexistence\" and \"absolute nullity,\" but doubtless because the Court had firmly established the principles relating to inexistence in the two other cases (that is, the 16 May 2001 and 29 August 2001 cases) they discuss only briefly the definitions of these categories. (\u00a7 635 of the Award)\n\n73.\n\nIt is quite surprising for me to read that a decision of June 2001 can \"reaffirm\" a decision of August 2001. This is indeed quite a strange chronology. Contrary to the majority's statement that the cases C-658 and C-699 discuss \"only briefly these categories\" (\u00a7 635 of the Award), I consider that they are more enlightening than the two other cases to understand the difference between inexistence and absolute nullity and the criteria for these respective concepts as well as their respective consequences; in fact, these two cases are extremely useful for what they say both on the difference between inexistence and validity and on the criteria for inexistence, especially if one considers the Spanish version and not the misleading English version. I will revert to this.\n\n74.\n\nSecond, the Award suffers from several approximations as far as the core concepts dealt with are concerned. At the beginning, there is a confusion between absolute nullity and inexistence, which can first been seen in \u00a7\u00a7 622 and 623 of the Award, where the two legal categories are treated either as equivalent or as a unique concept: \". Ecuadorian law recognizes automatic nullity or \u2018inexistence.'\"; \". the concept of automatic nullity or inexistence was judicially recognized.\" But, in the next paragraph (\u00a7 624 of the Award), the majority asserts that there is a difference between the categories of inexistence, absolute nullity and relative nullity. At first sight, this does not really appear coherent.\n\n75.\n\nBut the confusion between absolute nullity and inexistence appears again when the majority considers that Article 79 of the HCL is similar to Article 1745 (\u00a7 628 of the Award). I quote these two articles and a mere look at them shows that they do not use at all the same legal vocabulary:\n\nArticle 79 of the HCL\n\nLa transferencia de un contrato o la cesi\u00f3n a terceros de derechos provientes de un contracto, *ser\u00e1n nulas y no tendr\u00e1n valor alguno*si no precede autorizaci\u00f3n del Ministerio del Ramo...\n\nThe transfer of a contract or the assignment to third parties of rights derived from a contract *shall be null and void and shall have no validity whatsoever*if there is no prior authorization from the Ministry of Energy and Mines \u2026\n\nArticle 1745 of the Ecuadorian Civil Code\n\nLa falta de instrumento publico no puede suplirse por otra prueba en los actos y contratos en que la ley requiere esa solemnidad ; y se mirar\u00e1n *como no ejecutados o celebrados...*\n\nThe lack of a public deed cannot be replaced by other evidence in the acts and contracts for which the law requires this solemnity; and they will be *deemed as non executed and signed*... (Emphasis added)\n\n76.\n\nArticle 79 which deals with the absence of an authorization, by its own terms, refers to invalidity (\"no validity whatsoever\") while Article 1745, which deals with the absence of a public deed refers to inexistence (\"deemed as non executed\")... It seems quite difficult to establish a confusion between these two provisions as does the majority.\n\n77.\n\nIt should be added that the majority indicates that it took comfort in some declarations made by counsel and experts of both the Claimants and the Respondent before the question of the effect of Article 79 of the HCL was raised by the Tribunal in its Letter of 6 October 2011, declarations which are extensively quoted (\u00a7\u00a7 636-644 of the Award). I am not impressed by these citations, expressed prior to the Additional Submissions. These are all citations taken out of context and proffered in relation with other topics than the distinction between absolute nullity and inexistence, on which, to the contrary, the submissions of 3 and 22 November 2011 concentrated. If such an approach should be favoured, one could also say for example that the Claimants having not even mentioned inexistence in their 3 November 2011 submission and the Respondent arguing that it does not exist in the Ecuadorian legal system, such position can comfort the Tribunal that inexistence does not exist! Moreover, I consider that experienced arbitrators are capable to read decisions of the Supreme Court and understand their true meaning, notwithstanding whatever counsel or experts elaborate on them.\n\n78.\n\nContrary to the majority taking just one citation out of C-662 (\u00a7 624 of the Award) and one citation out of C-660 (\u00a7 630 of the Award) and not discussing the two other cases C-658 and C-659 (\u00a7 635 of the Award), I will now proceed to a thorough analysis, in the chronological order, of the four cases mentioned by the majority on which their findings purportedly rest, and put these isolated citations back in their context. This might look like legal technicalities, but being rigorous is required on such an important issue as the one dealt with here. I will also show that had the translations concerning the criteria of inexistence been correct and the original Spanish texts been really taken into account, the conclusions arrived at by the majority would have been impossible to sustain. The issue of the application of the proper law is at stake here.\n\nThe decision of 16 May 2001 (C-662)22\n-------------------------------------\n\nTo give the general context, in this case, the issue was whether a promise to sell/purchase a real property (an office in Guayaquil), that had to be made through a public deed, could be considered effective without the public deed.\n\n79.\n\nThis is the decision on which the majority most heavily relies (\u00a7\u00a7 624-629 of the Award). The starting point is the quotation of a unique citation, as just mentioned, which I will copy here, for the ease of reference:\n\nThis Chamber has examined on several occasions the question relating to the ineffectiveness of a juridical act. The doctrine distinguishes three types of ineffectiveness: 1. Maximum ineffectiveness or inexistence, when the act does not have the essential requirements for it to have a life. The inexistent act cannot be cured and does not need to be invalidated ; 2. absolute nullity, when the act is capable of producing some effects in certain special conditions. There is an appearance of act until its nullity is declared. *Absolute nullity* cannot be cured but *must be invalidated, i.e., declared* ; 3. relative nullity, which implies that the act is said to be valid and is only invalidated as of the day on which it is voided. The relatively void act can be validated.23 (Emphasis added)\n\nSupreme Court of Ecuador, 16 May 2001 at page 1528. CA-662 (Claimants' Translation of RLA- 348).\n\n80.\n\nThe majority then quite correctly frames the core issue that has to be discussed: what is the consequence of the absence of authorization, is it inexistence or absolute nullity? (\u00a7 625 of the Award). The answer is immediate: \"It is the Tribunal's view that the assignment that occurred under the Farmout Agreement undoubtedly meets the criteria expressed in the above quotations for \"inexistence.\" (\u00a7 626 of the Award. Emphasis added)). The problem is that these criteria were indeed enumerated not in this citation but later in the decision, which clarified what has to be considered an essential requirement, as will be explained in more detail below, and that the majority just decided for itself that an authorization was such an essential requirement, a statement which can be found nowhere in the decision. The majority thus concludes that the absence of authorization entails inexistence because \"both elements of \u2018ineffectiveness' identified by the Supreme Court have been satisfied: the attempted assignment (1) lacked an essential element required to give it life; and (2) as noted above, this defect cannot be cured.\"(*Ibid*.)\n\n81.\n\nThe next step is the astounding statement, already mentioned in paragraph 70 of this dissenting opinion, that the analysis of the case deals with contracts and is therefore not relevant:\n\nIn supporting its decision the Court quoted Columbian scholars who have stated that required elements for life in the context of contracts are \"expressed will, the consent, an object, and the solemn form.\"24 Although the Respondent attempted to argue that the Farmout Agreement did not fall within any of these criteria, it failed to appreciate that it is not the contract - the Farmout Agreement - that is at issue here. The issue is the validity of the assignment effected by the Farmout Agreement. Therefore applying a contractual analysis is inappropriate. (\u00a7 627 of the Award)\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n82.\n\nIn other words, the majority refuses to apply the criteria for inexistence put forward by the Supreme Court, pretending that these are criteria developed only for contracts and that it is not dealing with a contractual situation here. There are again here, according to me, a contradiction, an absurdity and an error of law: first, a contradiction, if the case is not relevant why study it; second, an absurdity, how can an assignment made through a contract be deemed not to be a contractual matter; third, a gross error of law, *i.e.* the statement that the criteria apply only for contract is blatantly wrong, as the decision does not deal only with contracts but with legal acts in general. As a matter of fact, a mere reading of the Supreme Court decision shows that contrary to what is stated by the majority to the effect that the \"required elements for life in the context of contracts are \u2018expressed will, the consent, an object, and the solemn form.\" (Emphasis added, *ibid.*), these elements are precisely the only criteria whose absence causes *a legal act* to be inexistent, and do not only apply for contracts. It deserves the full citation both in Spanish and English:\n\nLos citados autores colombianos escriben: \"Ciertas condiciones generales son indispensables para la formaci\u00f3n de los actos jur\u00eddicos, sin ellas, \u00e9stos no pueden nacer, no existen, son nada frente al derecho. Tales condiciones son: la voluntad manifestada, el consentimiento, el objeto y la forma solemne.\n\nThe cited Colombian authors write: \"Certain general conditions are essential for the formation of legal acts ; without them, the acts cannot be born, do not exist, are nothing under the law. Said conditions are: the expressed will, the consent, an object, and the solemn form.\n\n83.\n\nStating therefore without the slightest support in Ecuadorian law that an authorization is among the essential elements whose absence leads to inexistence, the majority concludes from the use of the term validity in Article 79, that \"no validity\" is equivalent with \"no life\" or \"no existence\" and concludes: \"The logical consequence of this provision is that no further action is required to invalidate an unauthorised assignment.\" (\u00a7 628 of the Award)\n\n84.\n\nLast, but not least, in the final paragraph devoted to the decision of 16 May 2001, the majority seems to deduct an automaticity for absolute nullity - although I am not certain of this interpretation of the quite obscure statements of this paragraph which seems to deal suddenly with absolute nullity, when the majority has already concluded that the absence of an authorization entails inexistence - from the fact that a judge \"shall\" declare absolute nullity when the conditions for such are present. Deducting an automatic nullity from a statement that a judge shall declare the nullity is at best puzzling. In fact, in doing so, the majority has endorsed a line of argumentation of the Claimants to the effect that the nullity is automatic, basing themselves on an unjustified assimilation between \"mandatory\" and \"automatic\" when they refer to the *Caducidad* Decree in order to defend the idea that \"(t)he nullity of the unauthorized assignment of rights pursuant to Article 79(1) HCL is automatic and mandatory\"25, in citing the following excerpt of the Decree:\n\n... the acts that the Law prohibits are null and of no value, save when another effect is expressly designated for the case of violation; in no case may the judge declare an act valid that the law establishes is null. (Emphasis in the original)\n\nThe Claimants have concluded from this citation that the nullity is automatic and does not need the intervention of a judge to be acknowledged. This interpretation has been endorsed by the majority.\n\nClaimants' Brief of 3 November 2011, \u00a7 11.\n\n85.\n\nTo the contrary, in my understanding, this simply indicates that a judge has to intervene to declare absolute nullity and means that it is mandatory for a judge to declare the nullity of an act considered to be null by law if he/she is requested to judge the validity of the act or on its own motion, not that an act can be considered as null automatically without the intervention of a judge. It appears quite plain that precisely in this extract a reference is made to a judge whose intervention is necessary. The rule according to which a judge cannot \"declare\" valid an act which is null by law rather demonstrates precisely that any nullity shall be \"declared\" by a judge under Ecuadorian law.\n\n86.\n\nSome other gaps in the majority's presentation will now be presented. First, as appears in the citation presented by the majority, it is indeed \" the doctrine \" that distinguishes three types of ineffectiveness. What is interesting is that if one does not stop there and goes on reading the decision of 16 May 2001, the Supreme Court immediately explains that there is another doctrinal position :\n\n\"It has been argued that our legislation does not distinguish inexistence from nullity, and that, therefore acts considered non existent by the doctrine should be included among those absolutely null. \" (Emphasis added)\n\n87.\n\nThe Supreme Court then continues its doctrinal review and refers to Chilean and Colombian scholars to state that they \"accept that in certain cases there are inexistent acts that are an appearance, a miscarriage, an attempt of an act rather that an act itself.\" One remark here: the description of what can be considered as an inexistent act has nothing to do with our situation, as the Farmout Agreement can be no means be described as \"an appearance, a miscarriage, an attempt of an act rather that an act itself.\" To the contrary, the situation of the Farmout Agreement can be described as a situation where \"there is an appearance of act until its nullity is declared\", which is the situation that leads to a declaration of absolute nullity. The Supreme Court then endorses the \"essential conditions\" and the consequence of the lack thereof, as described:\n\nCertain general conditions are essential for the formation of legal acts; without them, the acts cannot be born, do not exist, are nothing under the law. Said conditions are: the expressed will, the consent, an object and the solemn form...... The lack of such formalities is an obstacle to the formation or perfecting of such juridical acts and leads to such acts as being considered inexistent... (Emphasis added)\n\n88.\n\nNo trace of an authorization, as an essential condition for the formation of a legal act. Considering the structure of the reasoning, these essential elements - whose absence leads to inexistence - can only refer to the ones cited in the decision and it is indeed striking that in explaining what these essential requirements are, the Supreme Court refers exclusively to solemnities... For example, the Supreme Court quotes Article 1745 of the Civil Code mentions \"the lack of a public deed.\" The Supreme Court, then, summarizes its position in the following way:\n\n\"When the law requires the solemn formality of a public deed and it has not been granted, the act or contract will be regarded as though it has not been executed and signed, that is, legally, his act does not exist.\" (Emphasis added)26\n\nAnd the rest of the decision of 16 May 2001 only mentions this hypothesis: \"acts that are lacking the formalities required by law *...\"* due to an absolute lack of the proper form*...\"*\n\n*Id*., p. 1529.\n\n89.\n\nTwo important lessons can be drawn from this decision: first, it only refers to the lack of a solemn form not the lack of an authorization, as the basis for inexistence. Second, at the end of the day, it cannot be denied that it is the Supreme Court that has declared the inexistence, and I do not see how it could be otherwise, for two reasons: first because, when some solemn formality is lacking, there will always be a party saying that the contract is inexistent and the other that it is not, and a recourse to a court is therefore always needed; second, because, especially when an act has been performed, as was the situation in the case C-662 or in relation with the Farmout Agreement, there must be a judicial pronouncement to undo what has been done under the inexistent act... When there is a legal inexistence of an act that has a factual existence, a court has to explicit the legal consequences of this situation... This is precisely what the Supreme Court has done in the case C-662, concluding:\n\nIt is decreed that [the property that was transferred under an inexistent act] be restored to its owners within the term of thirty days as of the date this judgment is enforceable. (Emphasis added)\n\n90.\n\nIn other words, what can be derived from this case is that indeed the concept of inexistence appears to be accepted by the Supreme Court. Certainly, the citation quoted in \u00a7 79 of this opinion seems to belie the Respondent's assertion that \"inexistence\" does not exist in the Ecuadorian legal order, and I take note of the correctness of Claimants' position on this point. However, the same citation also clearly indicates that absolute nullity has to be declared by a judge, which this time belies the contention of the Claimants to the effect that absolute nullity is automatic. This citation presented by the Claimants is of crucial importance and, in my view, confirms that absolute nullity - as well as relative nullity - has to be declared by a judge.27 The Supreme Court even insists on that point, on saying it two times with a different word: \"Absolute nullity... must be invalidated*, i.e.,*declared. \" In other words, the unavoidable interpretation of the just mentioned citation is that, while inexistence might not always need the intervention of a judge, \"absolute nullity\" does.\n\nThe distinction between absolute and relative nullity is merely a question of timing, one being *ex tunc*, the other *ex nunc*.\n\n91.\n\nThe Supreme Court's decision examined here also indicates that inexistence can only be found in very limited circumstances dealing with a solemn formality which is lacking. There is not the slightest reference to the lack of a substantial requirement or an authorization or anything of that type. Moreover, the Supreme Court did not say \"the Buyer can consider the contract automatically inexistent\", leaving him to draw the consequences. It is the Supreme Court that declared that the contract \"will be regarded. legally inexistent\" and therefore the Supreme Court ordered that the situation, that prevailed before the contract has been executed, be restored.\n\nThe decision of 7 June 2001 (C-659)28\n-------------------------------------\n\nTo give the general context, this case dealt with a promise to sell real estate, for which a public deed was lacking. The Buyer had paid the money, but did not receive the property. It then requested that its money should be returned, arguing the inexistence of the contract and therefore the inexistence of a cause to its undue payment.\n\n92.\n\nThis case confirms the difference between inexistence and absolute nullity, as already stated in the previous decision. Again, a promise to sell a real estate was done without the legal requirement of a public deed and, according to the Supreme Court, has therefore to be considered as inexistent under Article 1745 of the Civil Code. This means that when a contract is inexistent, no claim can be raised on its basis:\n\n... a private promissory contract to sell real estate property shall be deemed not executed or signed, or as having no effect whatsoever ; or, in other terms, it is an apparent contract, it does not legally exist, it lacks all effectiveness. Therefore, a claim cannot be filed pursuant to it., as the contested judgment requests on the basis of section 1532 of the Civil Code; one cannot enforce compliance or request termination of an inexistent contract. (Emphasis added)\n\n93.\n\nIt should be underscored that the Supreme Court used the expression \"no effect whatsoever\" which should be distinguished from the expression \"no validity whatsoever\", the first expression referring to inexistence, the second to absolute nullity.\n\n94.\n\nThis case confirms that only the lack of a public deed and not of any other essential legal requirement can be a cause of inexistence. It must however be noted that the majority might have implicitly relied on a misleading English translation of the relevant part of the Supreme Court's decision, for its general interpretation of the conditions for inexistence - as capable of encompassing a legal requirement different from a public deed, like an authorization. This misleading English translation is indeed the only clear reference which I encountered to the idea that a legal requirement which is not the requirement of a public did could constitute a condition for the coming into existence of an act.\n\n95.\n\nThe original Spanish text reads as follows:\n\n.... Se trata de aquellas cl\u00e1usulas que ordinariamente forman parte de un contrato de promesa, pero que al haberse celebrado sin **las solemnidades** exigidas por la ley, escritura p\u00fablica, por tratarse de la compraventa de un inmueble, no produce entre las partes obligaci\u00f3n alguna, conforme lo establece en forma terminante el Art\u00edculo 1597 del C\u00f3digo Civil. Esta Sala en fallo expedido 16 de mayo de 2001, mediante Resoluci\u00f3n 188-2001, al analizar este tipo de \"convenios\" privados de venta de inmuebles, ha considerado que debe aplicarse a tales casos la disposici\u00f3n del art\u00edculo 1745 del C\u00f3digo Civil: \"La falta de instrumento p\u00fablico no puede suplirse por otra prueba en los actos y contratos en que la Ley requiere **esa solemnidad** ; y se miraran como no ejecutados o celebrados, aun cuando en ellos se prometa reducirlos a instrumento p\u00fablico dentro de un cierto plazo, bajo una cl\u00e1usula penal. Esta cl\u00e1usula no tendr\u00e1 efecto alguno.\" Por esta raz\u00f3n, un contrato privado de promesa de venta de inmuebles se mirar\u00e1 como no ejecutado ni celebrado ni tendr\u00e1 eficacia alguna o dicho de otro modo es un contrato aparente, jur\u00eddicamente no existe, carece de toda eficacia... (Emphasis added)\n\n96.\n\nIt confirms therefore the fact that only the absence of a public deed, to the exclusion of any other formal requirement, can be a cause of inexistence.\n\n97.\n\nThe English translation of the decision of the Supreme Court reads however as follows:\n\nThese are clauses which ordinarily are part of a promissory contract, but that, because they did took [sic] place without **the legal requirements**, a public deed, because it is pertaining to the purchase of a real estate property, no obligation between the parties was produced, as established in a clear manner in section 1597 of the Civil Code. This Court, in a ruling issued May 16, 2001, by way of Resolution 1882001, upon analyzing this type of private promissory \"contracts\" for the sale of a real estate property, has considered that the provision of section 1745 of the Civil Code must apply to such cases; \"The lack of a public instrument cannot be replaced by other evidence in the acts and contracts in which the Law requires **this legal requirement** ; and they will be deemed as non-executed or signed, even if it is promised therein that they will be committed to a public instrument within a certain period of time, under a penalty clause. This clause shall not have any effect whatsoever.\" For this reason, a private promissory contract to sell real estate property shall be deemed not executed or signed, or as having no effect whatsoever; or, in other terms, it is an apparent contract, it does not legally exist, it lacks all effectiveness... (Emphasis added)\n\n98.\n\nHighlighted in bold, it is noticeable that the word \"solemnidad\" and the phrase \"solemnidades exigidas por la ley\" are translated as \"legal requirement\", which of course is not the same thing. Suffice it to say here that the original and authentic Spanish version completely disproves the majority's analysis of the conditions for inexistence.\n\nThe decision of 29 August 2001 (C-660)29\n----------------------------------------\n\nTo give the general context, this case concerns a \"promise of purchase agreement\", but that was only qualified as such after some reasoning by the Supreme Court, as it was the buying of a vacation timeshare property. Some money was handed over by the Buyer, but then another contract was entered into by the parties, called a \"deed of settlement\" which was a termination act terminating the promise of purchase agreement, with the consequence that the money should be restituted to the Buyer by the Seller.\n\n99.\n\nAgain, in this case, the Supreme Court declared that the relevant \"promise of purchase agreement\" needed a public deed to exist, and that without this deed the contract was inexistent. The Supreme Court gave some indications on the consequences of an inexistent contract:\n\n... an act that the doctrine considers has maximum ineffectiveness or inexistence cannot be validated, nor does it need to be invalidated.\"\n\n100.\n\nThe Supreme Court recopied then exactly what it said in C-662, a few months before, citing first the two different doctrinal positions, and then citing again what it considered to be the essential requirements, whose absence entails inexistence:\n\nCertain general conditions are essential for the formation of legal acts; without them, the acts cannot be borne, do not exist, are nothing under the law. Said conditions are: the expressed will, the consent, an object and the solemn form.\n\n101.\n\nAlso in this case, as in the former ones, the Supreme Court referred repeatedly to the absence of solemn form or certain solemnities, and to no other cause of inexistence, such as an absence of authorization.\n\nThe decision of February 20, 2002 (C-658)30\n-------------------------------------------\n\nTo give the general context, this case dealt again with the purchase of real property.\n\n102.\n\nThis case is quite important, as it expresses very clearly that a distinction has to be made between existence and validity.\n\n103.\n\nMoreover, this case, once again disproves the majority's finding that anything else than \"solemnidas/public deed\" can constitute a formal requirement for existence. Here again, the record shows a problem of translation: in this case, the word \"solemnidad\" had not been translated by legal requirement, but the words legal requirements have been purely and simply added to the original Spanish text. I quote here both texts:\n\nThe misleading English translation:\n\n...The nullity is the legal consequence, generated because in the granting, subscription or manner in which a contract or legal act was celebrated, certain requirements or formalities expressly stated or regulated by law were omitted, the breach of which causes the penalty, one must differentiate between the conditions of existence and the conditions of validity, the first being the will, object, cause and **solemnities or legal requirements** prescribed by law, those without which the act is not binding for legal purposes and lacks any legal existence..\n\nThe original Spanish version:\n\n...la nulidad es una consecuencia jur\u00eddica que se genera porque en el otorgamiento, suscripci\u00f3n o forma de celebrar un acto o negocio jur\u00eddico se ha omitido ciertos requisitos y/o formalidades que expresamente la ley se\u00f1ala o regula y cuyo incumplimiento origina la sanci\u00f3n, debiendo diferenciarse las condiciones de existencia de las condiciones de validez, siendo las primeras las [sic] voluntad, el objeto, la causa y las **solemnidades** prescritas por la ley, aquellas sin las cuales el acto no nace a la vida del derecho, careciendo de existencia jur\u00eddica... (Emphasis added)\n\n104.\n\nA mere reading of these texts shows first that there can be non confusion between existence and validity and second that there can be non confusion between the conditions of existence and the conditions of validity. It has already been underscores that precisely the majority did not distinguish the concepts of existence/inexistence on the one hand and the concepts of validity/invalidity on the other hand.31 This case expressly states that there can be no confusion between inexistence and invalidity, distinction which the majority completely ignored. In the same manner, it has already been underscored that the majority assimilated solemnities with legal requirements, a conclusion that can in no way be based on the original Spanish text.\n\nSee, for example, \u00a7 626 of the Award.\n\nThe *jurisprudence constante* stemming out of these decisions\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n105.\n\nIt seems that a certain number of conclusions can be drawn from the analysis of these four decisions of the Ecuadorian Supreme Court. If one looks at the formal conditions that must be present for inexistence to arise, these cases - far from setting a judicial precedent that, according to the majority, would indicate that a legal act which lacks a required authorization or any other formal requirement is inexistent - show to the contrary that inexistence results only from the lack of a public deed. The cases stand for the principle that inexistence does not result from the absence of other formalities than the solemnity of a legal deed. The absence of other formalities, like the absence of an authorization, entails an absolute nullity.\n\n106.\n\nIn other words, the presentation of the conditions of inexistence in Ecuadorian law by the Respondent has to be considered as corresponding to the true content of that law. The majority however has disregarded it in a summary fashion, stating: \"Although the Respondent averred that the \"inexistence\" category applied only to a limited body of real estate transactions requiring the execution of a public deed, as discussed below, there is nothing in the general definitions set out in the case law to support such a narrow application of \"inexistence.\" (\u00a7 623 of the Award). The majority states categorically that there is \"nothing\" to support the fact that inexistence is only a consequence of a lack of a public deed. Let me just point to a few elements that disprove such a blatant and unfounded statement. First, ALL the cases mentioned deal only with real estate transactions, which should at least render cautious with too quick generalizations; second, ALL the cases cited deal exclusively with solemnities and public deeds; not a single case deals with the lack of an authorization! In other words, a fair reading of the cases of the Supreme Court cited by the majority to support their finding that inexistence can be declared when an authorization is not given, shows that this does not have the slightest support, as inexistence is linked exclusively with the absence of the formality of a public deed, and not with the absence of any other condition of validity of the act. I repeat that NONE of the cited cases dealt with the absence of an authorization.\n\n107.\n\nAlthough the majority has not expressly referred to the misleading translations mentioned above, the idea that the absence of any essential legal requirement - including the legal requirement of an authorization - is a cause of inexistence, pervades the majority's findings. The references to an essential aspect rather to the more restricted requirement of a public deed are numerous: \"an essential element\" (3 times in \u00a7 626 of the Award), \"an essential requirement\" (*Ibid*.), \"the essential elements\" (\u00a7 627 of the Award), \"essential requirements\" (\u00a7 630 of the Award). Whether or not the majority has relied on the English translations to reach its decision, it was at least imperative to take into account the authentic Spanish texts, with regard to which the majority's approach to the content of Ecuadorian law is blatantly not sustainable.\n\n108.\n\nI repeat that the absence of an authorization is distinct from the absence of a public deed and entails absolute nullity. This is indeed confirmed by section 1698 of the Civil Code:\n\n... the nullity produced by the omission of any requirement or formality which the law demands for certain acts and contract to be valid, in consideration to their nature, and not to the quality or status of the persons who execute or agree to them, are absolute nullities. (Emphasis added)\n\n109.\n\nAccording to Article 1698, \"the nullity produced by the omission of any requirement or formality which the law demands for certain acts and contracts to be valid \" (Emphasis added) is an absolute nullity. This is exactly the situation of Article 79 of the HCL, which refers indeed to the absence of validity.\n\n110.\n\nThe absence of the requirements and formalities requested by law clearly results not in inexistence but in absolute nullity. And absolute nullity - just like relative nullity for that matter -has to be declared by a judge, the difference being that the first declaration is *ex tunc* and the second *ex nunc*... The fact that absolute nullity has to be declared by a judge is stated without any possible ambiguity in section 1699 of the Civil Code:\n\nThe absolute nullity can and shall be declared by the judge, even if no party so requests, when it manifestly arises from the act or contract.\n\n111.\n\nTo conclude the question of the effectiveness of the Farmout Agreement under Ecuadorian law, it must be insisted upon, as any interpretation has to start with a good faith interpretation of the words used in a legal text, that Article 79 of the HCL uses the expression \"null and void\" and not \"inexistent.\" Legal words have each their own meaning and I do not see that the reference to \"null and void\" used in the HLC could be deemed equivalent to \"inexistent.\"32 This element is already conclusive, but we have seen that other arguments point to the same direction.\n\nThis has also been noted by the Respondent: \"Article 79 of the HCL does in any event not refer to \"inexistence\" of the unauthorized transfer of rights but to the fact that it is \"null and void\" under Ecuadorian law. Respondent's Brief of 3 November 2011, \u00a7 79.\n\n112.\n\nLooking  then at the conditions of \"absolute nullity\", under which a contract can be considered to be \"null and void\" under Ecuadorian law, I consider that, should the matter come before an Ecuadorian court, a judge would have no choice but to declare the assignment void. But this is an entirely different story than an automatic nullity. What is incontrovertible is that no Ecuadorian judge has indeed declared the Farmout Agreement to be null and void and that this Agreement was in full effect for many years.\n\n113.\n\nAs a result of the foregoing, I conclude that, if the applicable law is Ecuadorian law, the Farmout Agreement, having not been invalidated by an Ecuadorian court, should have been considered as still in force and binding.\n\n(iii) General conclusion on the effectiveness of the Farmout Agreement\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n114.\n\nIn sum, I have come to the conclusion that, whether one applies Ecuadorian Law or New York law, in isolation or in combination, the Farmout Agreement cannot just be taken out of the picture for determining the amount of damages granted to the Claimants. I have been convinced first, that the conditions for inexistence are not present and second, that absolute nullity provided for in Article 79 of the HCL has to be declared by a competent court.\n\n115.\n\nIt must be mentioned that Ecuador or PetroEcuador have not requested a declaration of nullity. Claimants are not entitled to do so. No New York judge or Ecuadorian judge has declared it. And, in my view, the majority could not declare it *sua sponte*, as it has no jurisdiction to do so, as will be discussed now.\n\n116.\n\nAs a result of the foregoing, I conclude that - whether by application of New York law or Ecuadorian law - the Farmout Agreement, having not been invalidated either by a New York court or an Ecuadorian court, should have been considered as still in force and binding.\n\n**3. Could the Farmout Agreement be considered inexistent or null and void on the occurrence of** ***caducidad*** **by this ICSID Tribunal? Jurisdictional issues.**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n117.\n\nA last question is indeed whether, in the absence of inexistence or automatic nullity or of a declaration of nullity by a national court, this Tribunal is empowered to declare a contract between a party to the arbitration and a non party null and void.\n\n118.\n\nIn other words, the question is whether the Tribunal should have declared that this transaction, entirely fulfilled during 6 years, is inexistent or null and void from the beginning - with the consequence that AEC/Andes is then, by virtue of this Award rendered in a proceeding to which it is not a party, deprived of any rights in the Participation Contract.\n\n119.\n\nI consider that in deciding as it did, the majority has both exercised a jurisdiction that it manifestly did not possess, and in exercising such jurisdiction has not applied the basic principles of international law relating to international responsibility.\n\n120.\n\nThe majority has however attempted to justify its findings both with regard to its jurisdiction and to the way it used this jurisdictional power to deal with the merits *i.e.* the determination of the amount of damages granted to the Claimants.\n\n121.\n\nAs far as the basis of its jurisdictional power to annul the assignment of rights effectuated through the Farmout Agreement is concerned, the majority seems to find it in an Ecuadorian rule. The Award indeed contains the following statement, which will be discussed below:\n\nArticle 10 of the Civil Code quoted in the above passage from the 29 August 2001 case is notable: \"In no case may the Judge declare valid an act that the law decrees to be null and void.\" If this Tribunal were to award only 60% compensation as requested by the Respondent, it would be acting in direct contravention of this Article by treating as valid an act that the law decrees to be null and void. The very wording of Article 10 demonstrates that the Ecuadorian authorities specifically contemplated situations like the present case - where the law itself (not a judge) decrees something to be null and void.\" (\u00a7 633 of the Award).\n\n122.\n\nAs far as its decision on the merits is concerned, the majority declared: \"The conclusions of the Tribunal in this section are sound under the principles of public international law to be applied when determining damages. Both parties referred, in particular, to unjust enrichment and to those principles contained in the *Chorzow Factory* case.\" (\u00a7 653 of the Award). I will show that it is the exact contrary, later in this opinion.\n\n123.\n\nIt is my contention that the majority manifestly exceeded its jurisdiction in annulling rights belonging to Andes.\n\n124.\n\nIn view of the quotation cited in paragraph 121of this opinion, it appears that the majority considers that it is empowered by Article 10 of the Ecuadorian Civil Code to judge the validity of a contract between a party and a non-party to this ICSID arbitration. I did not know that our ICSID Tribunal was empowered to act as an Ecuadorian judge and declare null and void a contract to which the applicable law is the law of New York. In fact, whatever the applicable legal order, no such power exists for our Tribunal. In declaring that the Farmout Agreement between a party to this arbitration and a non-party to this arbitration is inexistent/null and void, the majority has exercised, in my view, a power that it does not have. The Tribunal was not seized of a contractual dispute involving the Farmout Agreement, nor has any argument been presented that the existence of the Farmout Agreement is a violation of the Ecuador/United States BIT.\n\n125.\n\nRealizing probably that it was exercising jurisdiction towards a party over which it did not have jurisdiction, the majority - possibly in an attempt to alleviate its own concerns about depriving Andes of the rights it acquired under the Farmout Agreement - has followed the Claimants argument that the assignment is severable from the contract through which the assignment was performed. The Claimants indeed have argued that \"(a)ny portion of the Farmout or Operating Agreements that purported to assign rights under the Participation Contract without a required authorization is, under New York law, severable from the Agreements.\"33 Thus, in the same line, according to the majority:\n\nFor the avoidance of doubt, as noted above, the Tribunal reiterates that in the present case it is the validity of the assignment that is under scrutiny, and not the validity of the Farmout Agreement itself. The Tribunal's findings on the validity of the assignment do not affect other obligations that might arise between the parties to the Farmout Agreement (such parties being different to those in the present arbitration), nor does it render the Farmout Agreement itself invalid as between OEPC and AEC. (\u00a7 635 of the Award)\n\nClaimants' Brief of 3 November 2011, \u00a7 3.\n\n126.\n\nIf I understand correctly what the majority wants to convey here, it seems that it is saying that it cannot judge the validity of the Farmout Agreement, because it is between parties that are different than the ones before the ICSID Tribunal, but that it can rule on the validity of the assignment. This line of reasoning is quite difficult to follow, as it seems to me first that the parties to the assignment are exactly the same as the parties to the Farmout Agreement and second that the assignment and the Farmout Agreement are one and the same thing intrinsically linked together.\n\n127.\n\nI am really at loss to understand the reasoning:\n\n- it is not contested that the sole purpose of the Farmout Agreement was to transfer rights;\n\n- this transfer of rights is inexistent/invalid;\n\n- but the Farmout Agreement is existent/valid.\n\n128.\n\nI consider that the \"farming out\", the transfer of rights was at the core of the Farmout Agreement and that the idea that the \"assignment of rights\" which is the only purpose of the Farmout Agreement is \"severable\" does not make sense. This appears totally artificial as the sole and unique object of the Farmout agreement was precisely to transfer rights in and under the Participation Contract to AEC, and to express all the conditions for exercising such rights, as clearly stated in Article 1.02 which indicates that \"AECI and OEPC have agreed that AECI will acquire from OEPC a 40% economic interest in the Farmout property, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement *...* *\"* (Emphasis added). I could not see exactly what would remain \"existent/valid\" as being not intermingled with the transfer and its conditions and independent of it.\n\n129.\n\n*De facto*, the majority's decision amounts to \"expropriate\" a Chinese company over which it has manifestly no jurisdiction under the rules of international law. It is indeed clearly stated by the majority:... AEC... holds no rights - beneficial or otherwise - in the Participation Contract.\" (\u00a7 658 of the Award. Emphasis added)\n\n130.\n\nThe application of international law to the question of damages should have prevented the majority to assert jurisdiction in order to take drastic decisions in relation with an investment belonging to a Chinese company under the Ecuador/US BIT.\n\n131.\n\nI consider that in declaring the rights of Andes to be inexistent, the majority has deprived an entity over which it had no jurisdiction of its rights and therefore that it has not applied the proper law, which is international law, to the assessment of damages.\n\n132.\n\nIt has also to be emphasized that the majority has disregarded the existence of the Farmout Agreement for the purpose of evaluating the damages - without at a minimum reinstating the situation that would have existed in the absence of the Farmout, as for example asking OEPC to reimburse to Andes all the money that was invested in Block 15 by AEC.34 It should not have taken a half decision, but in order to be fair, restore the situation that would have existed without the performance of the Farmout Agreement considered inexistent or declared null and void, before drawing conclusions based on its inexistence, when everyone knows that it exist and has been fully performed. With such a decision, the majority is in violation with fundamental principles of international law. Either OEPC indeed hands over 40% of the awarded damages to Andes - as the Claimants have asserted they will do - which means that the majority has in fact indirectly granted damages for the benefit of AEC/Andes - which would be a manifest excess of power, as will be explained below. Compensating a party which does not have the required nationality under a BIT is clearly not something that is encompassed in the Tribunal's jurisdiction. I consider that the majority has therefore not applied the applicable law, which is international law, to the assessment of damages. Or OEPC will not hand over 40% of the awarded damages to Andes, precisely relying on this Award which declares that Andes has no rights, but then the decision of the majority will have condoned the violation of the international principle against unjust enrichment.\n\nSuch restoration of the situation that would have existed without the performance of an act considered inexistent or declared null and void has been performed for example by the Supreme Court in case C-662. See paragraph 89 of this opinion.\n\n**4. Had the majority not manifestly exceeded its powers in annulling Andes' rights, the Tribunal, could only have granted 60% of the damages to the Claimants in conformity with the principles of international law**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n133.\n\nThe question discussed here is: what should the solution have been, had the majority not manifestly exceeded its power?\n\n134.\n\nIn order to be exhaustive in the discussion of the public international law aspects of this case, I will indeed now present the international law principles that should have been applied, had not the majority annulled all the rights in the Participation Contract belonging to Andes. In other words, I will from now on base my reasoning on the hypothesis that the majority would not have exceeded its jurisdiction and as a consequence that the Farmout Agreement is considered in force between OEPC and Andes, as it is indeed in the real world.\n\n135.\n\nI will explain why I disagree with the statement of the majority to the effect that its decision is in conformity with international law and especially with the principle of unjust enrichment and the *Chorz\u00f3w* principles (\u00a7 653 of the Award, cited in \u00a7 122 of this opinion). And I will show to the contrary that the majority's decision is in contradiction with these two bodies of principles, as well as with the basic principles of international law granting a limited jurisdiction to this Tribunal, as already mentioned.\n\n136.\n\nIn other words, I will demonstrate, in this final part of my dissenting opinion, that, had the Farmout Agreement been taken into account as it should have been, the Tribunal could not have granted 100% of the damages to the Claimants. The question raised here is whether, according to the rules and principles of international law, the fact that 40% of the rights have been transferred to AEC/Andes is a bar to a 100% compensation of OEPC, or whether a mere 60% compensation of OEPC would go against these rules and principles? I consider that all principles of international law point to the same result, *i.e.* that OEPC could not be compensated for 100% of the value of Block 15, and hence was only entitled to 60% of the damages.\n\n137.\n\nI reiterate that, according to me, had the Farmout Agreement been taken into account, a 100% compensation instead of a 60% compensation, in this particular case, would have violated basic principles of international law, both concerning the fundamental principles related to this Tribunal's jurisdiction, as well as the substantial principles established in the *Chorz\u00f3w* case and the principle of unjust enrichment. Firstly, I will reiterate that granting 100% of the damages to the Claimants is in violation of the basic rules relating to this Tribunal's jurisdiction *ratione personae*, as far as nationality is concerned (i); secondly, I will explain that the same conclusion has to be adopted, if one considers that OEPC has kept the legal title to the 40% interest of AEC/Andes, under the Farmout Agreement's dispositions, which implies that granting 100% of the damages to the Claimants also violates the basic rules of international law relating to its jurisdiction over beneficial owners (ii); thirdly, I will then recall what are the consequences of the application of the *Chorz\u00f3w* principles to the kind of relation between the Claimants and Andes as established by the essence of the Farmout Agreement and show that the decision of the Tribunal violates these principles (iii); fourthly, I will note that, in my view, the fact of compensating OEPC for 100% of the rights of the Participation Agreement - as the majority has decided - goes, in any event, against the general international principle against unjust enrichment (iv); and I will close on a concluding remark (v).\n\n(i) According to the international law principles relating to the jurisdiction of the Tribunal, no damages ultimately benefiting to AEC/Andes could have been awarded by the Tribunal, because of the limited jurisdiction *ratione... personae*\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n138.\n\nIt is common ground that neither AEC, nor Andes are parties to this arbitration, nor are they American companies susceptible to benefit from the Ecuador/US BIT, AEC being a Canadian company and Andes a Chinese company. It is also common ground that AEC and Andes have been heavily investing in Block 15, but this means thus that a major portion of the amounts invested in Block 15 was contributed by entities over which the Tribunal has no jurisdiction under the Ecuador/US BIT (AEC, now Andes). An investment, as is well know, requires a contribution: it is uncontested that OEPC has contributed only for 60% of the value of the investment, 40% of that value, including both initial capital expenditures and operational expenditures during the life of the project, having been paid by AEC/Andes. How would it be possible to grant damages pertaining to rights that no longer belong to OEPC, without disregarding the basic rules that confer jurisdiction on ICSID tribunals? In case two different investors are claiming an interference with their rights, they must both present a claim and one investor cannot bring a claim for the other, especially when they do not have the same nationality and cannot invoke the same BIT, as is the case here.\n\n139.\n\nThe important point I want to convey here is that, just as the majority has exceeded its powers in annulling a transfer of rights to an investor that was not a party to the arbitration and could not be such a party under the Ecuador/US BIT, it could neither have granted 100% of the damages to the Claimants, had the Farmout been considered in existence.\n\n140.\n\nSuch a position - to refuse to compensate indirectly non parties which cannot benefit from the BIT under which the case proceeds - has already been adopted by several tribunals, among them the tribunal in the *Impregilo* case. To underscore the striking similarities with our situation, I quote some articles of the Impregilo Joint Venture Agreement and of the OEPC/AEC Operating Agreement.\n\n*Impregilo* *:* Clause 32.1 under the heading entitled \"Legal Relationship Amongst the Parties\" provides that:  \n \"This Agreement does not constitute a partnership or other form of permanent company or organization between the Parties under any applicable law.\"  \n*OEPC/AEC* *:* Article 14.1 of the Joint Operating Agreement \"Relationship of Parties\" provides that:  \n \"... It is not the intention of the Parties to create, nor shall this Agreement be deemed or construed to create a mining or other partnership, joint venture or association or (except as explicitly provided in this Agreement) a trust.\n\n*Impregilo* *:* By Clause 5.2 of the JVA, each of the partners shares the \"rights and obligations, costs and expenses, losses and benefits arising out of or in any way connected with the Contract(s) and the performance of the Works\" in proportion to its respective participation.  \n*OEPC/AEC* *:* Clause 3.3.1 of the Joint Operating Agreement states that \"all the rights and interests in and under the Participating Agreements, all Joint Property and any Petroleum and any Petroleum produced from the Agreement Area shall, subject to the terms of the Participating Agreements, be owned by the Parties in accordance with their respective Participating Interests\"\n\n*Impregilo* *:* Impregilo was the only signatory to the Contract on behalf of the joint-venture and was the guarantor of the performance of the other members of the consortium.   \n*OEPC/AEC* *:* It is well known that OEPC was the only signatory of the Participation Contract with Ecuador and therefore the only guarantor of its performance, as it has confirmed it to the authorities.\n\n*Impregilo* *:* Impregilo argued that it is under a contractual obligation to distribute any monetary Award. Thus, the only way for Impregilo to obtain its 57.8% stake is for the Tribunal to permit Impregilo to proceed on behalf of all participants. The claimant reasoned that it could not be made whole for its own personal losses from the treaty breaches unless it collected all damages suffered by the joint venture, because, if it collected only its proportionate share, it would have to distribute a portion of such share to its joint venture partners.  \n*OEPC/AEC* *:* In the same way, the Claimants argue, that because they have to give 40% of any award to AEC, under the Farmout Agreement, if the Tribunal gives them only 60% they could not be made whole for their own personal losses, as they will be left with only 36 % of the whole value.\n\n141.\n\nThis situation, as can be seen, presents striking similarities with the present case. The tribunal rejected without ambiguity the attempt by Impregilo to claim amounts that would be turned over to nationals from third countries, stating:\n\nThe question is raised whether a party who does fall within the ambit of a BIT and the Convention may act in arbitration proceedings in a representative capacity, in order to advance claims on behalf of other entities who do not so qualify.\n\n\u2026\n\n... There is nothing in the BIT to extend this to claims of nationals of any other state, even if advanced on their behalf by Italian nationals.\n\n\u2026\n\nThe fact that Impregilo may be empowered to advance claims on behalf of its partners is an internal contractual matter between the participants of the Joint Venture. It cannot, of itself, impact upon the scope of Pakistan's consent as expressed in the BIT... Equally, the fact that Impregilo may be obliged to account to its partners in respect of any damages obtained in these proceedings is also an internal GBC matter, which has no bearing on Pakistan's agreed exposure under the BIT. If this were not so, any party would be at liberty to conclude a variety of private contracts with third parties, and thereby unilaterally expand the ambit of a BIT.35 (Emphasis added)\n\n*Impregilo S.p.A. v. Islamic Republic of Pakistan* (ICSID Case No. ARB/03/3), Decision on Jurisdiction, 22 April, 2005, \u00a7 146, \u00a7 148 and \u00a7 151.\n\n142.\n\nI think that our Tribunal should have adopted the same reasoning. When taking into account the existence of the Farmout Agreement, it is not possible to grant 100% of the damages to the Claimants, as it is in fact granting 40% to someone else.\n\n143.\n\nThe same position was adopted in *PSEG v. Turkey*, where the tribunal explained that it could not award compensation \"in respect of investments or expenses incurred by entities over which there is no jurisdiction, even if this was done on behalf of one of the Claimants.\"36\n\n*PSEG Global, Inc., The North American Coal Corporation, and Konya Ingin Electrik Uretim ve Ticaret Limited Sirketi v. Turkey* (ICSID Case No. ARB/02/5), Award, 19 January 2007, \u00a7 325.\n\n144.\n\nTo summarize, I conclude that the Tribunal could only have granted to the Claimants damages corresponding to 60% of their rights and that it could not - as did *de facto* the majority - grant damages for 100% of the losses incurred in Block 15 resulting from *caducidad*, because such a solution would be unacceptable, under the only two possible scenarios, as suggested earlier: either OEPC will not transmit 40% of the amount received in damages to Andes, and it will then be unjustly enriched, in violation of the international principle of unjust enrichment; or OEPC will indeed transmit 40% of the amount received in damages to Andes, and the Tribunal would therefore have compensated Andes through OEPC, in violation of the principles of its limited jurisdiction *ratione personae*... This would be an improper recovery on behalf of an entity not protected by the U.S.-Ecuador BIT, when Andes is not a claimant in this procedure and could only claim and receive damages from Ecuador under the China/Ecuador BIT. Such investment is not protected by the Treaty because it does not belong to United States companies or nationals. It is certainly not possible for the Claimants to claim under the US/Ecuador BIT for an economic value belonging to a Chinese company. As to OEPC, it can only claim, on its own behalf, the value of its reduced investment, and not of the investments made by another, non-American company.\n\n(ii) According to the international law principles relating to the jurisdiction of the Tribunal and international law principles applicable to compensation for international illicit acts, no damages ultimately benefiting to AEC/Andes could have been awarded by the Tribunal, because, in case of split between a legal owner and a beneficial owner, it is only the beneficial owner which can be compensated\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n145.\n\nAlthough the Tribunal has concluded that the *de facto* legal title was transferred (\u00a7 331 of the Award), it is also beyond doubt that the *de jure* legal title remained with OEPC. The question which the Tribunal had to solve then was whether OEPC as the *de jure* owner of the legal title to the 40% interest of AEC could claim for damages caused to AEC, in the name of which it was holding this legal title until the required governmental approvals were obtained.\n\n146.\n\nIt is uncontested that *caducidad* has caused damages to two different investors: OEPC and AEC/Andes. OEPC, as an investor having paid only for 60% of all the money invested in Block 15 cannot include the value of the damages incurred by AEC/Andes, as an investor having paid 40% of all the money invested in Block 15, to augment its own damages. It cannot be contested that OEPC is not the sole investor in Block 15, as it has indeed, by transferring to AEC/Andes 40% of its economic interest through the Farmout Agreement, effectively disinvested from Block 15 to that extent. AEC/Andes is an investor having equivalent rights in the benefits of Block 15 to those of OEPC, but in a different proportion.37\n\nI note that this would even be true, if the analysis concerning the substance of its interest in Block 15 presented by the Claimants would have prevailed, as has been well explained by the Respondent, in Respondent's Rejoinder PHB on Quantum and Counterclaim on damages, \u00a7 125: \"AEC/Andes' rights can be characterized as an \"investment\" under the relevant provisions of the Ecuador-China BIT. Indeed, even following Claimants' argument that \"AEC acquired no more than a contractual right against OEPC to receive from OEPC 40% of Block 15 production,\" such a credit would be an investment since, under Article 1c) of the Ecuador-China BIT money claims and any entitlement of economic value are \"investments.\"... As a result, AEC/Andes' 40% economic interest is an investment different from Claimants' investment.\"\n\n147.\n\nAs far as the 40% interest belonging to AEC are concerned, the relation between AEC and OEPC is not a relation between a creditor and a debtor, it is rather a situation of a splitting of title, between the legal title and the economic interest, between a nominee and a beneficial owner.\n\n148.\n\nAs far as the position of international law towards beneficial owners, in cases where the legal title and the beneficial ownership are split, is concerned, it is quite uncontroversial, after a thorough review of the existing doctrine and case-law, that international law grants relief to the owner of the economic interest.\n\n149.\n\nThe fact that international law favours the beneficial owner has been recognized by the doctrine38; the case-law of the Iran-US Claims Tribunal39 which has always considered the beneficial owner of the legal interest rather than the legal owner when there was a split of title, as well as ICSID tribunals' decisions.40\n\nSee for example, Margaret Whiteman's *Digest of International Law*, vol. 8 pp. 1261-1262, in particular: \"Where the beneficial owner of property, with respect to which claim was made before... the Commission... was a *national* of the United States, and where the legal owner or nominee was a non-national of the United states, the Commission allowed claims, if otherwise eligible. But where the legal owner or trustee was a national of the United States, and beneficiary or *cestui que trust* was a non-national, in claims before that Commission, the claims were denied.\"\n\n*James M. Saghi, Michael R. Saghi and Allan J. Saghi, Claimants, v. The Islamic Republic of Iran*, Case No. 298, 29-Iran.U.S.CT.R. p. 20, with references to many other cases.\n\nSee, for example, *Waguih Elie George Siag and Clorinda Vecchi v. The Arab Republic of Egypt* (ICSID Case No. ARB/05/15), Award, 1 June 2009, \u00a7\u00a7 87-90.\n\n150.\n\nIt is worth mentioning that in relation to 40% of the interest in Block 15, OEPC did keep only \"the nominal legal title\", the beneficial owner of the interest being AEC. This results from many articles in the Farmout Agreement or the Joint Operating Agreement, which have been cited in the Award. I will only cite here again two of those. Article 2.01 of the Farmout Agreement explains that the economic interest \"does not include nominal legal title to an interest in Block 15 or an interest as a party to the Participating Agreements.\" The Joint Operating Agreement refers to the Farmout at Article 3.2.1 as follows:\n\nPursuant to the provisions of the Farmout Agreement, AECI has on the Effective Date a forty percent (40%) interest in the Participating Agreements that until the Transfer Date shall be equivalent economically to, but shall not include, nominal legal title.\n\n151.\n\nThis means that, for 40% of the rights and interests in Block 15, there is a split of title, the nominal legal title belonging to OEPC, the beneficial interest belonging to AEC. According to the principles of international law dealing with this type of situation where there is a split of title, only the beneficial owner, AEC/Andes, can claim for interference with his interests, OEPC having no standing to claim in the name of the beneficial owner.\n\n(iii) According to the international law principles governing State responsibility, OEPC should only have received 60% of the total damages, in line with the *Chorz\u00f3w Factory* principle of full recovery\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n152.\n\nIt should be reminded that, in assessing damages for breaches of international law, it is the duty of a tribunal to ascertain the amount of damages directly and proximately caused by the wrongdoer, and to restore the claimant, as far as possible, to the position it would have occupied but for the wrongful act, as has been clearly stated by the PCIJ in the *Chorz\u00f3w Factory* case, which I quote for the ease of reference:\n\nOn approaching this question, it should first be observed that, in estimating the damage caused by an unlawful act, only the value of property, rights and interests which have been affected and the owner of which is the person on whose behalf compensation is claimed, or the damage done to whom is to serve as a means of gauging the reparation claimed, must be taken into account. This principle, which is accepted in the jurisprudence of arbitral tribunals, has the effect, on the one hand, of excluding from the damage to be estimated, injury resulting for third parties from the unlawful act and, on the other hand, of not excluding from the damage the amount of debts and other obligations for which the injured party is responsible.41\n\n*Case concerning the Factory at Chorz\u00f3w* (Claim for Indemnity) (Merits), P.C.I.J. Series A, No. 17, Judgement of 13 September 1928, at page 31.\n\n153.\n\nThe plain text of the *Chorz\u00f3w Factory* dictum indicates that a distinction has to be made, between *rights* belonging to a third party for which a claimant cannot assert any claim and *liabilities* towards a third party which are a constitutive part of a claimant's entitlements. In order to distinguish the two, a good point of departure is to state that a liability means that A (OEPC) is under an *obligation to transfer* something to B (AEC), a transfer means that A (OEPC) *has transferred* something to B (AEC). In other words, it is clear that the *Chorz\u00f3w Factory* dictum means that, on the one hand compensation can only be granted to the *owner* of a right that has been interfered with, and that on the other hand, if a right belonging to an owner is burdened with a *liability* this does not prevent its owner to receive full compensation for its right.\n\n154.\n\nIn fact, no party disagrees with this theoretical analysis of the *Chorz\u00f3w Factory* dictum, as it has just been presented, based on a distinction between a right of ownership and a liability, and on the fact that a claimant can only claim for a loss it has sustained personally. This analysis has been reiterated by the Respondent in its Rejoinder Post Hearing Brief, where it stated that \"(t)he general principle set forth in the *Chorz\u00f3w* decision to determine the damage caused by an unlawful act is the following: only the value of property, rights and interests which have been affected and the owner of which is the person on whose behalf compensation is claimed, or the damage done to whom is to serve as a means of gauging the reparation claimed, must be taken into account.\"42 The Claimants do not disagree with this presentation either, admitting that same distinction in the following terms: \"It is settled international law that contractual obligations and liabilities for which the injured party remains responsible must not be excluded from its compensable damages. Only when a third party has a right of ownership in the investment, the compensable damage must be reduced to the extent of that third party's ownership right.\"43 Commenting the *Chorz\u00f3w Factory* case, the Claimants were unambiguous on its meaning and its consequences: \"The Court's statement makes it clear that the injured party cannot claim damages for injury caused to property of which he is not the owner.\"44\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder PHB on Quantum and Counterclaim on Damages, \u00a7 119.\n\nClaimants PHB on Damages, \u00a7 223.\n\nClaimants PHB on Damages, \u00a7 233.\n\n155.\n\nHaving these general principles in mind, I start by stating that the fact of compensating OEPC for 60% of its own remaining rights would have been perfectly in line with the *Chorz\u00f3w* principle of full reparation, as will be explained now.\n\n156.\n\nIt is not contested that restitution is the priority reparation, and that when it is not available, the amount of damages should be equivalent to the value that restitution would have afforded to the Claimants. I therefore disagree with the Respondent, when it relies on the Tribunal's Decision on Provisional Measures to say that the Tribunal should no longer be concerned with restitution, as it was stated in that decision, that in the circumstances of the case, restitution was to be considered as impossible and therefore non available. I agree therefore with the Claimants analysis, to the effect that: \". the fact that restitution in kind is no longer available to Claimants does not relieve Ecuador of its obligation to pay Claimants compensation corresponding to \u2018the value which restitution in kind would bear'.\"45 That obligation to grant damages equivalent to restitution arises precisely because restitution itself is no longer possible.\n\nClaimants' Skeleton Submission, 29 October 2009 (Section IX, \u00a78)\n\n157.\n\nGranting 60% of the value of Block 15 to the Claimants would have been perfectly in line with the *Chorz\u00f3w* principle of full recovery. The full value of the investment of OEPC was only 60% of the full value of the Participation Contract. The situation was aptly described by Professor Mayer in the February 2010 hearing:\n\nNow, in that situation, what happens when *caducidad* occurs? Who suffers the damage? The answer is obvious: It's both Oxy up to 60 percent of the value of the Farmout property as defined, and Andes, successor to AEC, up to 40 percent of the value.46\n\nHearing Transcript (4 February 2010), p. 191, lines 13-18.\n\n158.\n\nI consider that the Tribunal should have concluded that OEPC is entitled to 60% of the value of Block 15, which is in line with the *Chorz\u00f3w Factory* principle of full recovery. Ecuador would have indeed compensated the Claimants for the full value of their investment, which for the reasons explained does not include the portion of the rights financed by AEC/Andes and belonging to them. Restitution - if it could have been granted47 - would not have given to OEPC more than it had before. Restitution of Block 15 would have amounted for OEPC that it could recuperate a right to 60% of the oil produced, and could not, by miracle, have been offered back a right to 100% of the oil produced to OEPC, when it did no longer possess such a right at the moment when *caducidad* was declared.\n\nWhich is not the case, as has been explained in the Decision on Provisional Measures, 17 August 2009, \u00a7\u00a7 75-86.\n\n159.\n\nIn paying 60% of the value of the rights under the Participation Contract, Ecuador would indeed have compensated the Claimants for the full value of their investment, which does not include the portion of the rights financed by AEC/Andes and owned by them, which is now Andes' investment.\n\n(iv) According to the international principle based on unjust enrichment, the Claimants are unjustly enriched, if after having been fully paid by AEC for the acquisition of 40% of the economic rights under the Participation Contract, they receive the equivalent of 40% of these rights back\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n160.\n\nThe Respondent argues that, because pursuant to the Farmout Agreement, AEC paid due consideration to OEPC for the its acquisition of a 40% economic interest in Block 15, OEPC would be unjustly enriched if OEPC now received, in addition, damages representing 100% the fair market value of the Participation Contract.\n\n161.\n\nIt is incontrovertible that he Claimants cannot evade the fact that, with or without *caducidad*, with or without a declaration of nullity of the assignment of right by the majority, they were only entitled to receive 60% of the benefits of the Participation Contract, because AEC had a right to 40% of the total benefit. It is clear that 40% of all expenses incurred for Block 15 have been paid by AEC, and there is therefore no justification to grant damages for the losses incurred by AEC as a result of its investment in Block 15 to OEPC. Claimants have not been damaged with respect to AEC/Andes's 40%, since Claimants have no right to the economic benefits of that 40% in the first place.\n\n162.\n\nThis means that, in a DCF method of calculation of the Claimants' damages, based on an evaluation of their future profits, any damages granted to the Claimants cannot exceed their part of the profits. For the application of the DCF method, the future net cash flows are appropriately determined by calculating the flow of benefits that the Claimants would have been reasonably expected to earn in, in the state of the world in which the termination of the contract hypothetically did not occur (the \"but for\" scenario). In this perspective, it appears uncontested that the Claimants could only expect to receive 60% of the benefits: as expressed by the Respondent, \"[t]heir losses cannot be higher than their expected profits. Thus, awarding Claimants 100% of the purported economic losses would overcompensate and unjustly enrich them.\"48 (Emphasis added)\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder on Quantum, \u00a7 77.\n\n163.\n\nOEPC answers to this in saying that - according to the Farmout Agreement - it is bound to retrofit 40% to Andes. The Claimants argue that, because they have to give 40% of any award to AEC, if the Tribunal gives them only 60% they could not be made whole for their own personal losses, as they will be left with only 36 % of the whole value.49\n\nClaimants' PHB on Damages, \u00a7 259. *See* also, Claimants' Opening Presentation, Slide 214.\n\n164.\n\nFirstly, the Tribunal should not have granted 100% of the damages to the Claimants as it had no guarantee that the 40% will be transferred to Andes, as guaranteeing rights to AEC cannot be part of the Award of a Tribunal respecting the limits of its jurisdiction, as this would concern rights of a party which is not in the case. The same analysis has been made by the tribunal in the case of *Impregilo v. Pakistan.*50 In that case, already mentioned, Impregilo reasoned that it could not be made whole for its own personal losses from the treaty breaches unless it collected all damages suffered by the joint venture, because, if it collected only its proportionate share, it would have to distribute a portion of such share to its joint venture partners. The tribunal rejected such attempt of a full recovery by Impregilo on several bases, among which the possible contradiction with the principle of unjust enrichment, in the following terms:\n\nIndeed, there is a further counter to Impregilo's argument that it requires recovery in respect of GBC's total losses in order to be left with compensation in respect of its own 57.8% stake (because its own contractual arrangements with its partners oblige it to share out any proceeds in any event). As pointed out in the decision of the Iran-U.S. Claims Tribunal in *Blount Brothers Corporation v. Iran*, a tribunal has no means of compelling a successful Claimant to pass on the appropriate share of damages to other shareholders or participants.51\n\n*Impregilo supra note 35*.\n\n*Impregilo supra* note 35 at \u00a7 152. When citing the Award No.215-52-1, 28 February 1986 *Blount Brothers Corporation v. The Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran* case, the tribunal referred to many other cases from the same tribunal, *i.e*... Award No. 232-97-2, 2 May 1986 *Richard D. Harza, et al v. The Islamic Republic of Iran, et al,* 11 Iran-U.S. C.T.R., p. 86; Award No 244-68-2, 8 August 1986, *Howard, Needles, Tammen & Bergendorff v. The Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran*, 11 Iran-U.S. C.T.R., p. 314; Award No. 282-10853 to 6-1, 17 December 1986, *Ian L. McHarg v. The Islamic Republic of Iran*, 13 Iran-U.S. C.T.R., p. 302.\n\n165.\n\nSecondly, I note that, if OEPC indeed will fulfil the obligation to give 40% of the granted damages to Andes, this precisely indicates that it is not claiming 100% for itself, but is claiming only 60% for itself and claiming 40% for Andes.\n\n(v) A concluding note\n---------------------\n\n166.\n\nIt could appear, at first sight, that it would not be fair that the execution by OEPC of the Farmout Agreement with AEC on 1 October 2000 would allow Ecuador, following *caducidad*, to be legally obliged to compensate OEPC for 60% only of its interest in Block 15, when it concretely had acquired 100% of Block 15 upon the issuance of the *Caducidad* Decree. The Claimants have indeed insisted on the fact that the State - if it is obliged to pay only 60% of the total damages - would be unjustly enriched. This is also the approach of my two colleagues forming the majority, as it is stated in the Award: \"In this respect, by far the greater risk of unjust enrichment lies at the door of Ecuador. Ecuador would be unjustly enriched if only obliged to compensate for 60% of a 100% unlawful taking.\" (\u00a7 655 of the Award)\n\n167.\n\nI wish to mention that there is no unfairness here, as this is purely a result of the limited jurisdiction of ICSID tribunals. International investment tribunals are not here to redress any torts worldwide. Under a BIT, they are meant to solve disputes between investors of a certain nationality and States, but do not concern investors that have neither one nor the other nationality of the two States parties to the BIT. It happens more often than not that there is no jurisdiction for all or a portion of a loss caused by a State's action... For example, in *Mihaly v. Sri Lanka52,* an ICSID case in which the tribunal's jurisdiction was based on the United States/Sri Lanka BIT, involving a partnership without legal personality between Mihaly (USA) and Mihaly (Canada), the tribunal decided that only Mihaly (USA) could claim for its owns rights and not Mihaly (Canada), although there was an alleged deprivation of the whole economic operation:\n\n... neither Canada nor Mihaly (Canada) could bring any claim under the ICSID Convention, whatever rights Mihaly (Canada) had or did not have against Sri Lanka.\n\n\u2026\n\nThe Tribunal finds, nonetheless, that Mihaly International Corporation (USA) is entitled to file a claim in its own name against Sri Lanka in respect of the rights and interests it may be able subsequently to establish in the proposed power project. (Emphasis added)\n\n*Mihaly International Corporation v. Sri Lanka* (ICSID Case No. ARB/00/2), Award, 15 March 2002, \u00a7 24 and \u00a7 26.\n\n168.\n\nAs a matter of fact, each time an international tribunal does not have jurisdiction over a case that has some merits, it could be theoretically said that the State has been unjustly enriched. But this is nothing extraordinary, it is simply the result of the limited access to international arbitration, which the majority has blatantly disregarded."}], "Content": "Award\n-----\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **GLOSSARY** | |\n| **Abbreviation** | **Definition** |\n| \"AEC\" | Alberta Energy Corporation |\n| \"BIT\" or \"Treaty\" | Treaty Between the United States of America and the Republic of Ecuador Concerning the Encouragement and Reciprocal Protection of Investment |\n| \"DCF\" | Discounted Cash Flow |\n| \"DNH\" | National Hydrocarbons Directorate |\n| \"FMV\" | Fair Market Value |\n| \"HCL\" | Hydrocarbons Law |\n| \"OCP\" | *Oleoducto de Crudos Pesados* |\n| \"OEPC\" | Occidental Exploration and Production Company |\n| \"OPC\" | Occidental Petroleum Corporation |\n| \"PetroEcuador\" | The Republic of Ecuador's national oil company and successor to *Corporaci\u00f3n Estatal Petrolera Ecuatoriana* (\"CEPE\").

PROCEDURE**\n----------------\n\n**A. Registration of the Request for Arbitration**\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n1.\n\nOn 17 May 2006, Occidental Petroleum Corporation (\"OPC\") and Occidental Exploration and Production Company (\"OEPC\"), two U.S. companies, (together the \"Claimants\") incorporated in the States of Delaware and California, respectively, filed with the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (\"ICSID\" or the \"Centre\") a Request for Arbitration under the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States (\"ICSID Convention\") against the Republic of Ecuador (\"Ecuador\" or the \"Respondent\") and Empresa Estatal Petr\u00f3leos del Ecuador (\"PetroEcuador\").1\n\n*PetroEcuador* was Ecuador's national oil company and the successor to *Corporaci\u00f3n Estatal Petrolera Ecuatoriana* (\"CEPE\"). By letter to the Centre of 29 September 2006, the Claimants withdrew their claims against PetroEcuador.\n\n2.\n\nThe parties' dispute concerns the termination [ *caducidad* ] of a 1999 Participation Contract between OEPC and PetroEcuador for the exploration and exploitation of hydrocarbons in Block 15 of the Ecuadorian Amazon region (the \"Participation Contract\").\n\n3.\n\nThe Request for Arbitration invoked Ecuador's consent to ICSID arbitration contained in the 1993 Treaty Between the United States of America and the Republic of Ecuador Concerning the Encouragement and Protection of Investments (the \"BIT\"), and PetroEcuador's consent to ICSID arbitration in the Participation Contract.\n\n4.\n\nOn 22 May 2006, ICSID acknowledged receipt of the Request for Arbitration and, in accordance with Article 36(1) of the ICSID Convention, transmitted copies of the Request for Arbitration and accompanying documentation to the Republic of Ecuador and PetroEcuador.\n\n5.\n\nBy letters of 7, 16 and 29 June 2006, ICSID requested additional information from the Claimants. By letters of 13, 23 and 29 June 2006, the Claimants provided information supplementing their Request for Arbitration. Further information was provided by the Claimants by letter of 6 July 2006.\n\n6.\n\nOn 13 July 2006, the Acting Secretary-General of ICSID, in accordance with Article 36(3) of the ICSID Convention, registered the Request for Arbitration, and notified the parties of the registration under ICSID Case Number ARB/06/11.\n\n7.\n\nThe Request for Arbitration included (in paragraphs 76 and 77) a Request for Provisional Measures. In accordance with a schedule fixed by ICSID pursuant to Rule 39(5) of ICSID's Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings (the \"ICSID Arbitration Rules\"), and later amended with the agreement of the parties, the Claimants filed a particularized Application for Provisional Measures on 18 October 2006. Ecuador then filed a response to the Claimants' Application on 1 December 2006, followed by the Claimants' Reply of 15 December 2006 and Ecuador's Rejoinder of 30 December 2006.\n\n**B. Constitution of the Tribunal and Commencement of the Proceeding**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n8.\n\nBy letter dated 29 September 2006, the Claimants informed the Centre that they had selected the method envisaged in Article 37(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention for the constitution of the Tribunal (*i.e.* the Tribunal would consist of three arbitrators, one arbitrator appointed by each party and the third, who would be the president of the Tribunal, to be appointed by agreement of the parties). By same letter, the Claimants informed the Centre of their appointment of Mr. David A.R. Williams, QC, of New Zealand, as an arbitrator. Mr. Williams accepted his appointment on 18 October 2006.\n\n9.\n\nOn 13 October 2006, the Claimants requested ICSID to appoint the arbitrators not yet appointed and to designate an arbitrator to be the president for of the Tribunal in this case, pursuant to Article 38 of the ICSID Convention and ICSID Arbitration Rule 4(1).\n\n10.\n\nBy letters of 25 October, 21 November, 1, 12, 13 and 27 December 2006 and 5 January 2007, the Centre consulted with the parties in connection with the appointment of the arbitrators not yet appointed, as envisaged in Article 38 of the ICSID Convention and ICSID Arbitration Rule 4.\n\n11.\n\nBy letter of 25 January 2007, the Centre informed the parties that, pursuant to Article 38 of the ICSID Convention and ICSID Arbitration Rule 4, the Acting Chairman of ICSID's Administrative Council had appointed Professor Brigitte Stern, a national of France, as a co-arbitrator and Mr. L. Yves Fortier, QC, of Canada, as the third arbitrator and President of the Tribunal. Professor Stern accepted her appointment on 31 January 2007. Mr. Fortier accepted his appointment on 5 February 2007. At the time of their respective appointments, Professor Stern was a member of the ICSID Panel of Arbitrators appointed by France and Mr. Fortier was a member of the ICSID Panel of Arbitrators appointed by the Chairman of the ICSID Administrative Council.\n\n12.\n\nBy letter of 6 February 2007, the Secretary-General of ICSID notified the parties that, all three arbitrators having accepted their appointments, the Tribunal was deemed to be constituted and the proceeding deemed to have begun on that date. By the same letter, the Secretary-General provided copies of the declarations of independence and impartiality signed by each member of the Tribunal in accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 6 and informed the parties that Ms. Gabriela Alvarez-Avila, Senior Counsel, ICSID, would serve as Secretary of the Tribunal.\n\n**C. Written and Oral Phases of the Proceeding**\n------------------------------------------------\n\n13.\n\nThe Tribunal and the parties held a preliminary telephone conference on 16 February 2007, during which it was agreed that the First Session of the Tribunal would be held on 2 May 2007 at the seat of the Centre in Washington, D.C. It was also agreed that a hearing on the Claimants' Application for Provisional Measures would be held on 3 May 2007. The telephone conference was recorded and copies of the audio recordings were provided to the parties and the members of the Tribunal.\n\n14.\n\nBy letter of 19 February 2007, the parties were invited to simultaneously submit any further documents and/or testimony related to the Claimants' Application for Provisional Measures that they may wish to rely upon by 20 April 2007. Both parties submitted additional documentation on 18 April 2007.\n\n15.\n\nWith the agreement of the parties and the members of the Tribunal, the President of the Tribunal held an organizational pre-hearing telephone conference with the parties on 26 April 2007. The conference was attended by Messrs. David W. Rivkin, Mark W. Friedman and Ga\u00ebtan Verhoosel from Debevoise & Plimpton LLP and by Ms. Laura C. Abrahamson, Assistant General Counsel of OPC, on behalf of the Claimants; Mr. Paul Reichler and Ms. Janis Brennan, from Foley Hoag LLP, Mr. Alberto Wray, at the time with the law firm of Cabezas & Wray Abogados in Quito, and Ms. Claudia Salgado from Ecuador's *Procuradur\u00eda General del Estado* [Ecuador's Attorney General's Office] *,* participated on behalf of the Respondent; Ms. Gabriela \u00c1lvarez-\u00c1vila and Messrs. Gonzalo Flores and Emilio Rodriguez-Larra\u00edn, from the ICSID Secretariat, and Ms. Ren\u00e9e Th\u00e9riault, then from the law firm of Ogilvy Renault LLP in Ottawa, Mr. Fortier's law firm, also participated in the conference call. During the conference call, a number of agreements were reached in connection with the organization of the forthcoming First Session and the hearing on the Claimants' Application for Provisional Measures. Among these, the parties agreed to the appointment of Ms. Th\u00e9riault as Assistant to the Tribunal. The telephone conference was recorded and copies of the audio recordings were provided to the parties and the members of the Tribunal.\n\n16.\n\nThe First Session of the Tribunal and the hearing on the Claimants' Application for Provisional Measures were held, as scheduled, on 2-3 May 2007 at the seat of the Centre in Washington, D.C. In attendance were the three members of the Tribunal, Mr. L. Yves Fortier, Professor Brigitte Stern and Mr. David A.R. Williams. In the absence of Ms. \u00c1lvarez-\u00c1vila, Mr. Gonzalo Flores, Senior Counsel, ICSID, was in attendance for the ICSID Secretariat. Ms. Ren\u00e9e Th\u00e9riault, Assistant to the Tribunal, was also present. The Claimants were represented by Messrs. David W. Rivkin, Mark W. Friedman, Shane Spelliscy, Claudio D. Salas and Ga\u00ebtan Verhoosel, from Debevoise & Plimpton LLP, and by Ms. Laura Abrahamson and Messrs. Gerald Ellis and Terry Lindquist of OPC. The Respondent was represented by Dr. Jos\u00e9 Xavier Garaicoa Ort\u00edz, Ecuador's *Procurador General del Estado* [Attorney General], Mr. Alberto Wray of Cabezas & Wray Abogados in Quito, Mr. Paul Reichler, Ms. Janis Brennan and Ms. Clara Brillembourg of Foley Hoag, LLP in Washington, D.C., Ms. Claudia Salgado, of the Office of Ecuador's Attorney General, Ms. Mar\u00eda Augusta Carrera from PetroEcuador and Mr. Peter Phaneuf from TrialTek Consulting.\n\n17.\n\nDuring the First Session, the parties confirmed that the Tribunal had been properly constituted in accordance with the ICSID Convention and the ICSID Arbitration Rules and that they had no objection to the appointment of any of the members of the Tribunal. The parties also confirmed their agreement to the appointment of Ms. Ren\u00e9e Th\u00e9riault, an associate in Mr. Fortier's law firm of Ogilvy Renault, as Assistant to the Tribunal. Finally, the parties agreed to a number of procedural matters which were reflected in summary minutes prepared by the Secretariat and circulated to the parties and the Tribunal. During this session, the parties agreed that the jurisdiction/liability phase and quantum phase (if required) should be separated, but the Claimants requested that the timetable for the quantum phase be fixed at the same time as the liability phase so as avoid unnecessary delay. [A copy of the Minutes is attached to this Award as Annex1].\n\n18.\n\nUpon conclusion of the First Session, the parties addressed the Tribunal on the Claimants' Application for Provisional Measures. Messrs. Rivkin and Friedman addressed the Tribunal on behalf of the Claimants and Mr. Reichler addressed the Tribunal on behalf of the Respondent. During the hearing, and following consultations between the parties, the Claimants' Application was significantly amended.\n\n19.\n\nIn accordance with the schedule fixed during the First Session (slightly amended by the Tribunal, following delays in the parties' production of documents), the Claimants filed a Memorial on Liability, with accompanying documentation, on 23 July 2007. The accompanying documentation included, *inter alia*, the witness statements of Messrs. Andrew Patterson, Casey Olson, Fernando Albuja, Gerald Ellis, John L. Keplinger, Paul MacInnes, and Steven Bell; and the Expert Report of Dr. Hern\u00e1n P\u00e9rez Loose.\n\n20.\n\nOn 17 August 2007, the Tribunal issued its unanimous Decision on Provisional Measures.2 In its Decision, the Tribunal, after careful consideration of the parties' positions, concluded that the Claimants had failed to demonstrate that an order for provisional measures was justified in the circumstances and thus dismissed their Application.\n\nAvailable online at icsid.worldbank.org\\_and attached to the Award as Annex 2.\n\n21.\n\nBy letter of 24 August 2007, the parties were informed that Mr. Gonzalo Flores, Senior Counsel, ICSID, would replace Ms. \u00c1lvarez-\u00c1vila as Secretary of the Tribunal, following her departure from ICSID.\n\n22.\n\nOn 17 September 2007, the Claimants filed a Memorial on Damages with accompanying documentation. The accompanying documentation included, *inter alia*, the Second Witness Statements of Messrs. Fernando Albuja, Gerald Ellis, and Andrew Patterson; the Witness Statement of Dr. Surendra Pal (S.P.) Sing; the Expert Reports of Prof. Joseph P. Kalt and Netherland, Sewell & Associates, Inc., and a Second Expert Report of Dr. Hern\u00e1n P\u00e9rez Loose.\n\n23.\n\nSuccessive changes in the Republic of Ecuador's representation led the Respondent to request, on 17 September 2007, a modification to the schedule for written pleadings agreed during the First Session. The Claimants opposed the Respondent's request by letter of 24 September 2007. The Respondent replied by letter of 15 October 2007.\n\n24.\n\nOn 31 October 2007, with the agreement of his co-arbitrators, the President of the Tribunal held a telephone conference with the parties to address: (a) the Respondent's request for a new procedural calendar and (b) the Respondent's representation in this case. During the call, it was concluded that the procedural timetable established by the Tribunal during the First Session would have to be amended. It was further decided that the parties would confer and try to agree on an amended calendar and that a further telephone conference would be held on 31 January 2008 in order to consider revisions to the procedural calendar. The telephone conference was recorded and copies of the audio recordings were provided to the parties and the members of the Tribunal.\n\n25.\n\nBy letter of 20 December 2007, the Republic of Ecuador informed the Tribunal that it had selected the law firm of Squire, Sanders & Dempsey LLP as its new counsel of record. The firm is now known as Squire, Sanders (US) LLP.\n\n26.\n\nOn 23 January 2008, the parties wrote separately to the Tribunal to inform it that they had failed to reach agreement on a revised procedural calendar and, in their respective letters, each party proposed a procedural calendar to the Tribunal.\n\n27.\n\nAs agreed, a telephone conference call was held between the President of the Tribunal and the parties on 31 January 2008. Ms. Laura Abrahamson from OPC, as well as Mr. David W. Rivkin and Ms. Carmen Martinez L\u00f3pez from Debevoise & Plimpton LLP, participated in the teleconference on behalf of the Claimants. The Respondent was represented in the telephone conference by Mr. Carlos Venegas, Ms. Claudia Salgado and Ms. Christel Gaibor, from Ecuador's *Procuradur\u00eda General del Estado* and by Messrs. George von Mehren and Stephen P. Anway, from Squire, Sanders (US) LLP. During the telephone conference both parties were given full and equal opportunity to elaborate on their respective submissions of 23 January 2008. The telephone conference was recorded and copies of the audio recordings were provided to the parties and the members of the Tribunal.\n\n28.\n\nOn 11 February 2008, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No.1 directing a revised procedural calendar, including a timetable for the jurisdictional phase of the arbitration with separate timetables for each of the liability and quantum phases (as required).\n\n29.\n\nPursuant to Procedural Order No. 1, the Respondent, on 7 March 2008, filed a Memorial on its Objections to Jurisdiction, with accompanying documentation. The accompanying documentation included, *inter alia*, an Expert Report by Dr. Juan Pablo Aguilar Andrade. The Claimants filed a Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, with accompanying documentation, on 4 April 2008. The accompanying documentation included, *inter alia*, a Third Expert Report by Dr. Hern\u00e1n P\u00e9rez Loose.\n\n30.\n\nBy letter of April 14, 2008, the Republic of Ecuador informed the Tribunal that, in addition to Squire, Sanders (US) LLP, the law firm of Dechert LLP would represent the Respondent in this proceeding.\n\n31.\n\nPursuant to Procedural Order No. 1, the Respondent filed a Reply on Jurisdiction, with accompanying documentation, on 23 April 2008. The accompanying documentation included, *inter alia*, a Second Expert Report by Dr. Juan Pablo Aguilar Andrade.\n\n32.\n\nBy letter dated 28 April 2008, the Republic of Ecuador informed the Tribunal of the appointment of Dr. Diego Garc\u00eda Carri\u00f3n as the new *Procurador General del Estado* [Attorney General], following the resignation of Dr. Xavier Garaicoa Ort\u00edz. In the same letter, the Republic of Ecuador requested amendments to the procedural calendar established in Procedural Order No. 1. The Claimants opposed this request by letter dated 29 April 2008.\n\n33.\n\nOn 6 May 2008, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 2, amending the calendar established in Procedural Order No. 1.\n\n34.\n\nThe Claimants filed a Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, with accompanying documentation, on 12 May 2008. The accompanying documentation included, *inter alia*, a Fourth Expert Report by Dr. Hern\u00e1n P\u00e9rez Loose.\n\n35.\n\nAs directed by Procedural Order No. 1, a two-day hearing on jurisdiction was held at the World Bank's offices in Paris, on 22-23 May 2008. The three members of the Tribunal, Mr. L. Yves Fortier, Professor Brigitte Stern and Mr. David A.R. Williams, attended the hearing. Mr. Gonzalo Flores, Secretary of the Tribunal, and Ms. Ren\u00e9e Th\u00e9riault, Assistant to the Tribunal, were also present at the hearing. During the hearing, the Claimants were represented by Messrs. Rivkin and Verhoosel and Ms. Martinez L\u00f3pez of Debevoise & Plimpton LLP and by Ms. Laura Abrahamson and Mr. Gerald Ellis of OPC. The Republic of Ecuador was represented by Dr. Diego Garc\u00eda Carri\u00f3n, *Procurador General del Estado;* Messrs. Carlos Venegas and Francisco Paredes and Ms. Claudia Salgado, from the Attorney General's office; Messrs. George von Mehren, Stephen P. Anway, Hernando D\u00edaz and Rostislav Pekar of Squire, Sanders (US) LLP; Messrs. Eduardo Silva Romero, Pierre Mayer, George Foster and Edward Kling of Dechert LLP; Dr. Galo Chiriboga, Ecuador's Minister of Energy and Mines; and Dr. Mar\u00eda Ang\u00e9lica Martinez, from PetroEcuador.\n\n36.\n\nDuring the hearing, the parties' respective counsel made extensive opening and closing submissions on the various issues raised by the Respondent's jurisdictional challenge. Dr. Juan Pablo Aguilar Andrade and Dr. Hern\u00e1n P\u00e9rez Loose also appeared as expert witnesses at the hearing and were examined by counsel under the control of the Tribunal.\n\n37.\n\nOn 16 June 2008, in accordance with the procedural calendar amended by the Tribunal in Procedural Order No. 2, the Respondent filed its Counter-Memorial on Liability, with accompanying documentation. The accompanying documentation included, *inter alia*, witness statements of Ministers Pablo Ter\u00e1n and Iv\u00e1n Rodr\u00edguez and of Mr. Felipe S\u00e1nchez. It also included an Expert Report by Mr. Timothy Martin and a Third Expert report by Dr. Juan Pablo Aguilar Andrade. In accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 40, the Respondent's Counter-Memorial also included a Counterclaim.\n\n38.\n\nOn 11 August 2008, the Claimants filed a Reply on Liability, with accompanying documentation. The accompanying documentation included, *inter alia*, a Fifth Expert Report from Dr. Hern\u00e1n P\u00e9rez Loose; Expert Reports from Messrs. Andrew B. Derman and Norman E. Maryan Jr.; First Witness Statements from Messrs. Derek Aylesworth, Ian Davis and Gary Guidry; Second Witness Statements from Messrs. Steven Bell, John L. Keplinger, Paul MacInnes and Casey Olson; and Third Witness Statements from Messrs. Fernando Albuja, Gerald Ellis and Andrew Patterson. The Claimants' Reply included a Response to the Respondent's Counterclaim.\n\n39.\n\nOn 9 September 2008, the Tribunal issued its Decision on Jurisdiction. In its Decision, which forms an integral part of the present Award and is attached to it as Annex 3, the Tribunal addressed the two jurisdictional challenges raised by the Republic of Ecuador, namely: (a) that the adjudication of the parties' dispute was governed by the Participation Contract, which excluded *caducidad* from arbitration; and (b) that the Claimants failed to comply with the 6-month cooling-off period required under the BIT. In its conclusions, the Tribunal, unanimously, ruled that (a) \"based on elementary principles of contract interpretation, any exception to the availability of ICSID arbitration for the resolution of disputes arising under the Participation Contract, in this case *caducidad* -related disputes, requires clear language to this effect. Had the parties wished to exclude such disputes from ICSID jurisdiction and confer exclusive jurisdiction to the Ecuadorian administrative courts in this regard, they could have done so. They did not and the Tribunal will not imply such wording in the clause;\" and (b) that \"the *caducidad* procedure at issue in this arbitration was in fact initiated in 2004. As noted earlier, for some 18 months or so prior to the issuance of the actual *Caducidad* Decree on 15 May 2006, OEPC made a number of submissions seeking to rebut the allegations on the basis of which the *caducidad* procedure was initiated, but to no avail. Furthermore, the Tribunal accepts, albeit without prejudging the merits, that attempts at reaching a negotiated solution were indeed futile in the circumstances.\"\n\n40.\n\nThe Tribunal accordingly declared that it had jurisdiction over OEPC's and OPC's claims in this arbitration and that the arbitral proceedings would continue to the merits phase in accordance with the calendar established in the Tribunal's Procedural Order No. 1 as modified by Procedural Order No. 2.\n\n41.\n\nOn 19 September 2008, the Respondent filed a Rejoinder on Liability, with accompanying documentation, which included, *inter alia*, a Witness Statement from Mr. \u00c1ngel Basantes; Second Witness Statements from Ministers Iv\u00e1n Rodr\u00edguez and Pablo Ter\u00e1n; a Third Witness Statement from Mr. Wilson Pastor Morris; an Expert Report from Dr. Marcelo Merlo Jaramillo; a Second Expert Report from Mr. Timothy Martin; and a Fourth Expert Report by Dr. Juan Pablo Aguilar Andrade. The Respondent's Rejoinder included a Reply on its Counterclaim.\n\n42.\n\nOn 23 September, 10 October and 20 October 2008, the Tribunal issued Procedural Orders No. 3, 4 and 5 concerning production of documents.\n\n43.\n\nBy letter of 27 October 2008, the Tribunal fixed the venue and dates for a hearing on liability. The hearing would be held at the seat of the Centre in Washington, D.C., from 13 to 20 December 2008.\n\n44.\n\nOn 14 November 2008, the Claimants filed a Rejoinder to the Respondent's Counterclaim, with accompanying documentation. The accompanying documentation included, *inter alia*, a Sixth Expert Report from Dr. Hern\u00e1n P\u00e9rez Loose; a Second Expert Report from Mr. Andrew B. Derman; a Second Expert Report from Mr. Norman E.

The Tribunal has reached the point in its deliberations where it requires the assistance of both parties' experts, Mr. Joseph Kalt and Mr. Daniel Johnston, in order to help the Tribunal assess the proper calculation of damages.\n\nTherefore, in accordance with Rule 34 (2) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules, the Tribunal calls upon the parties to produce Messrs. Kalt and Johnston for consultation with the Tribunal at the ICSID's headquarters in Washington at 10.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 27 April 2011. If the parties agree, the Tribunal would wish to consult with the parties' experts alone without the presence of counsel.\n\n79.\n\nOn 23 February 2011, the President of the Tribunal, in response to the parties' reply to his letter of 15 February 2011, wrote to the parties as follows:\n\nOn behalf of the Tribunal, I acknowledge receipt of the parties' replies the contents of which have been noted.\n\nTo be clear, the Tribunal reiterates that its deliberations are continuing. The Tribunal requests the parties to protect the date of 27 April 2011 for consultation with Messrs. Kalt and Johnston. Again, to be clear, this consultation will not take place without the presence of counsel unless both parties agree.\n\nFinally, the Tribunal notes that both parties request that they be informed of the issues it wishes to discuss with their experts. The Tribunal agrees. This information will be communicated to the parties after the consultation of 27 April 2011 has been definitely confirmed. The parties are invited to confirm by Monday, 7 March 2011, their and the experts' availability on the proposed date...\n\n80.\n\nOn 11 March 2011, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 9, concerning the production of further expert evidence. In its Order, the Tribunal noted that \"[i]n the event the Tribunal, after it concludes the first phase of its deliberations, makes a positive finding of liability, it will be required to determine the fair market value of Block 15 as of 16 May 2006. [T]o assist the Tribunal in its continuing deliberations, the Tribunal deems it necessary to require the assistance of the parties' experts with respect to certain issues regarding the determination of the fair market value of Block 15 as of 16 May 2006.\" Accordingly, the Tribunal invited the parties' experts, Professor Kalt and Mr. Johnston, \"to confer and produce jointly a report estimating the fair market value of Block 15 as of 16 May 2006, using the discounted cash flow method.\" The Tribunal further established a procedure for the parties to comment on the experts' joint report and declared the consultation date of 27 April 2011 vacated.\n\n81.\n\nAs requested by the Tribunal, on 11 April 2011, the parties' experts, Professor Joseph P. Kalt and Mr. Daniel Johnston, issued a Joint Expert Report, which was circulated to the parties and the members of the Tribunal.\n\n82.\n\nIn accordance with the Tribunal's instructions in Procedural Order No. 9, both parties submitted observations on the Experts' Joint Report on 18 April 2011.\n\n83.\n\nOn 1 May 2011, the Tribunal informed the parties of its decision to hold a hearing at the seat of the Centre in Washington D.C. with the parties and their experts Professor Kalt and Mr. Johnston.\n\n84.\n\nOn 13 May 2011, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 10, providing the parties' instructions with respect to the organization of a one-day hearing to be held on 30 June 2011 at the seat of the Centre in Washington D.C. In this Order, the Tribunal requested that Professor Kalt and Mr. Johnston confer again and produce jointly to the Tribunal, by 10 June 2011, a supplemental report addressing the parties' comments. The two experts were asked by the Tribunal to be present at the 30 June hearing to assist the Tribunal and answer questions which may be put to them by the Tribunal.\n\n85.\n\nOn 10 June 2011, Professor Kalt and Mr. Johnston submitted to the parties and the Tribunal their Supplemental Joint Expert Report. On 17 June 2011, both parties filed observations on the Experts' Supplemental Joint Report, as directed in Procedural Order No. 10.\n\n86.\n\nOn 20 June 2011, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 11, with further directions to the parties' experts.\n\n87.\n\nOn 24 June 2011, Professor Kalt and Mr. Johnston, pursuant to the terms of Procedural Order No. 11, submitted to the parties and the Tribunal a Second Supplemental Joint Expert Report.\n\n88.\n\nAs scheduled, the Tribunal held a one-day hearing at the seat of the Centre in Washington D.C. on 30 June 2011. The three members of the Tribunal, Mr. L. Yves Fortier, Professor Brigitte Stern and Mr. David A.R. Williams, attended the hearing. Mr. Gonzalo Flores, Secretary of the Tribunal, and Ms. Ren\u00e9e Th\u00e9riault, Assistant to the Tribunal, were also present at the hearing.\n\n89.\n\nDuring the hearing, the Claimants were represented by Ms. Laura Abrahamson and Messrs. Paul MacInnes and Gerald Ellis from OPC; David W. Rivkin, Greg Senn, Julian S. Manu-Sarbeng, Vonn Ricks and Kirk Monroe and Ms. Marjorie Menza and Ms. Bethany A.

Kalt, Mr. Stephen Makowka and Ms. Nandana Thomas, from Compass Lexecon, were also present during the hearing.\n\n90.\n\nDuring the hearing, the Republic of Ecuador was represented by Dr. Diego Garc\u00eda Carri\u00f3n, Ecuador's *Procurador General del Estado*, Mr. Francisco Grijalva, Ms. Christel Gaibor and Ms. Gianina Osejo from the Office of Ecuador's Attorney General; Messrs. George von Mehren, Howard Nicols and Ms. Rachel Harris from Squire, Sanders (US) LLP; Messrs. Eduardo Silva Romero, Philip Dunham and \u00c1lvaro Galindo from Dechert LLP. The Respondent's expert, Mr. Daniel Johnston, as well as Messrs. Erick Johnston and Ren\u00e9 Daigre were also present during the hearing.\n\n91.\n\nAt the beginning of the hearing, the President of the Tribunal made the following statement:3\n\nAs the parties will recall, on 15 February 2011, the tribunal informed the parties that it had reached the point in its deliberations both as to liability and quantum where it required the assistance of both parties' respective quantum experts, Professor Joseph Kalt and Mr. Daniel Johnston. More specifically, the tribunal stated that, in the event, after it concludes the first phase of its deliberations, it should make a positive finding of liability, it will be required to determine the fair market value of Block 15 as of 16 May 2006. If it decided -- if it decided to use the discounted cash flow method in order to estimate this value, the tribunal formed the view that Professor Kalt and Mr. Johnston, who had given evidence earlier on the use of that method, could answer certain specific questions and help it with certain calculations.\n\nDuring the hearing, the members of the Tribunal posed questions to the parties' experts and counsel.\n\nHearing Transcript (30 June 2011) at pages 11-12\n\n92.\n\nOn 6 October 2011, the President of the Tribunal wrote, on behalf of the Tribunal, to the parties as follows:\n\nMembers of the Tribunal continue their intense deliberations. The Tribunal regrets that its decision has taken longer to finalize than it would have wished. However, the parties have submitted to the Tribunal, in their extensive written and oral submissions, a myriad of factual and legal issues which all need to be analyzed and determined. The Tribunal is confident that its deliberations will end soon and a decision issued shortly thereafter.\n\nIn recent days, the Tribunal has been addressing an issue which, in its view, neither party has dealt with comprehensively in its prior submissions. The issue concerns the interpretation of the Farmout Agreement and the Joint Operating Agreement.\n\nThe Respondent submits [\u2026] that the calculation of damages (if any) to be awarded to the Claimants in the circumstances must be limited to a 60% interest in Block 15 because of the transfer by the Claimants to AEC under the terms of the Farmout Agreement of 40% of their interest under the Participation Contract. The Claimants do not accept the Respondent's contention [\u2026]\n\nThe governing law clause of the Farmout Agreement provides:\n\nThis Agreement shall be governed by and construed, interpreted and applied in accordance with the laws of the State of New York, United States of America, excluding any choice of law rules or conflict of law principles which would refer the matter to the laws of another jurisdiction, except to the extent that the laws of Ecuador require application of the laws of Ecuador to the Participating Agreements and Block 15 or other property situated in or operations or activities conducted in Ecuador.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the Claimants argued that the transfer of the \"economic interest\" to AEC would not be considered an assignment under New York law and that, as a result, the non-assignment clause in Article 16(1) of the Participation Contract was not breached [...]. Accordingly, the Claimants did not analyze the effect and validity of an assignment, (assuming an assignment had indeed occurred as a result of the Farmout Agreement and the Joint Operating Agreement), in breach of Article 16(1) of the Participation Contract and Article 79 of the Hydrocarbons Law. In addition, the Claimants did not analyze Ecuadorian and New York law in this regard. The Tribunal further notes that the Respondent argued that New York law is irrelevant to the issue of whether an assignment under the Farmout Agreement and the Joint Operating Agreement (if any) is in breach of Ecuadorian law (CounterMemorial on Liability, para 185).\n\nIn sum, neither party, in their quantum submissions, referred to the effect of Article 79 of the Hydrocarbons Law or Article 16(1) of the Participation Contract on the assumption that an assignment of rights occurred as a result of the Farmout Agreement and the Joint Operating Agreement.\n\nThe Tribunal now invites the parties to assume that an assignment of rights did occur as a result of the Farmout Agreement and the Joint Operating Agreement. On the basis of this assumption, the parties are requested to undertake a detailed analysis of the effect of an assignment of rights made under a contract governed by New York law (i.e. the Farmout Agreement and the Joint Operating Agreement) in violation of a non-assignment clause set forth in a contract governed by Ecuadorian law (i.e. Article 16(1) of the Participation Contract) and in violation of Article 79 of the Hydrocarbons Law. The parties are further requested to address both New York law and Ecuadorian law and to make submissions accordingly, even if one or both parties may consider that, for any reason, New York law and/or Ecuadorian law may not be relevant to the determination of the effect of the Farmout Agreement and the Joint Operating Agreement.\n\nThe parties' submissions will be exchanged simultaneously and submitted to the Tribunal within 28 days from this date. The Tribunal will then decide whether reply briefs are necessary.\n\nWhile the parties may refer to new legal authorities with their respective submissions, they may not file any document which is not already in the record.\n\n93.\n\nOn 3 November 2011, the parties simultaneously filed briefs in response to the Tribunal's directions of 6 October 2011. As directed by the Tribunal, the parties filed simultaneously reply briefs on 22 November 2011.\n\n94.\n\nOn 16 December 2011, Ms. Th\u00e9riault, the assistant to the Tribunal, left the successor law firm to Ogilvy Renault, Norton Rose OR, and thus ceased her functions.\n\n95.\n\nOn 23 February 2012, the President of the Tribunal wrote, on behalf of the Tribunal, to the parties as follows:\n\n...Members of the Tribunal have now conferred on whether to schedule a hearing in person, as requested by the Respondent, in order to address orally the issues raised by the Tribunal in its communication of 6 October 2011 to the parties and then briefed extensively by them in the submissions of 3 and 22 November 2011.\n\nWhile the Tribunal remains of the view that a hearing is not necessary, it notes that the Claimants, in their communication of 20 February, stated that they had no objection to a hearing. In the circumstances, the Tribunal has decided to accede to the Respondent's request and schedule peremptorily a hearing in London on Thursday 12 April 2012. The Hearing will commence at 10 a.m. and end at 5 p.m.\n\nThe parties are invited to confer and agree a timetable for the hearing which they will communicate to the Tribunal by 23 March 2012.\n\nThe parties are put on notice now that, immediately after the hearing of 12 April, the Tribunal will declare the proceeding closed in accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 38.\n\n96.\n\nIn accordance with the Tribunal's directions, a hearing with the parties was held in London, United Kingdom on 12 April 2012. The three members of the Tribunal, Mr. L. Yves Fortier, Professor Brigitte Stern and Mr. David A.R. Williams, attended the hearing. Mr. Gonzalo Flores, Secretary of the Tribunal was also present at the hearing.\n\n97.\n\nDuring the hearing, the Claimants were represented by Mr. Donald P. de Brier, Ms. Laura Abrahamson, Mr. Michael L. Preston and Mr. Gerald Ellis from OPC; Messrs. David W. Rivkin and Ms. Marjorie Menza of Debevoise & Plimpton LLP; Messrs. Ga\u00ebtan Verhoosel and James O'Shea and Ms. Carmen Martinez L\u00f3pez of Covington & Burling, LLP.\n\n98.\n\nDuring the hearing, the Republic of Ecuador was represented by Dr. Diego Garc\u00eda Carri\u00f3n, Ecuador's *Procurador General del Estado*, Ms. Christel Gaibor and Ms. Gianina Osejo from the Office of Ecuador's Attorney General; Messrs. George von Mehren, and Stephen P. Anway from Squire, Sanders (US) LLP.; Messrs. Eduardo Silva Romero and Pierre Mayer and Ms. Audrey Caminades from Dechert LLP; and H.E. Ambassador Ana Alb\u00e1n, Ecuador's Ambassador to the United Kingdom.\n\n99.\n\nDuring the hearing, Messrs. Rivkin and Verhoosel addressed the Tribunal on behalf of the Claimants. Dr. Garc\u00eda Carri\u00f3n and Messrs. von Mehren, Anway, Silva Romero and Mayer addressed the Tribunal on behalf of the Respondent.\n\n100.\n\nAt the end of the hearing, the President of the Tribunal, in accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 38(1), declared the proceedings closed and invited the parties to submit statements of the costs incurred by them in the conduct of these proceedings.\n\n101.\n\nIn accordance with the Tribunal's instructions, the parties simultaneously filed their Statements of Costs and Fees on 30 April 2012 (revised by Respondent on July 9, 2012 and by Claimants on July 16, 2012).\n\n102.\n\nAs the procedural history of this case makes abundantly clear, this proceeding has been very lengthy. In fact, the procedural history of this arbitration set out above is not meant to be exhaustive. From the outset, the parties have raised a myriad of legal and factual issues pertaining to provisional measures, jurisdiction, merits and liability. In addition, the Tribunal, throughout this arbitral proceeding, has been required to address numerous procedural requests and applications, all of which were extensively and diligently briefed by the parties, resulting in literally thousands of pages of submissions and exhibits. The Tribunal considers it unnecessary to describe these submissions beyond the account set forth above.\n\n103.\n\nAs has been seen, the Tribunal has issued a 47 page Decision on the Claimants' Application for Provisional Measures, a 44 page Decision on Jurisdiction and 11 important Procedural Orders. The Claimants have submitted 32 statements by 14 witnesses and 15 reports by 5 experts. For its part, the Respondent has submitted 18 statements by 11 witnesses and 17 reports by 7 experts. The Claimants have filed 662 exhibits and 667 legal authorities and the Respondent has filed 379 exhibits and 368 legal authorities. In all, there have been 9 hearings, comprising 22 days, since the First Session of the Tribunal on 2 May 2007. The many written submissions of the Claimants consist of 2,226 pages and the written submissions of the Respondent 1,964 pages. The transcripts of all proceedings consist of 5,291 pages.\n\n104.\n\nThe Tribunal wishes to acknowledge the dedication and professionalism of counsel for both the Claimants and the Respondent who have assisted the Tribunal throughout this arbitration.\n\n**II. FACTUAL BACKGROUND**\n--------------------------\n\n**A. Introduction**\n-------------------\n\n105.\n\nThis proceeding concerns various alleged breaches by Ecuador under both domestic and international law, especially under the Treaty Between the United States of America and the Republic of Ecuador Concerning the Encouragement and Reciprocal Protection of Investment (the \"Treaty\" or \"BIT\"). In addition, the Claimants rely on an agreement referred to as the \"Participation Contract\" dated 21 May 1999 between OEPC, Ecuador and Petroecuador in connection with the exploration and exploitation of hydrocarbons in what has been identified as \"Block 15\" of the Ecuadorian Amazon. The *caducidad* of the Participation Contract was declared by decree of the Ecuadorian Minister of Energy and Mines on 15 May 2006, resulting in termination of the Participation Contract.\n\n106.\n\nBy way of introduction, the Tribunal recalls that the relief sought by the Claimants in their Request for Arbitration is set forth as follows:\n\nClaimants respectfully request an award in their favor,\n\n(a) Declaring that Respondents have breached their obligations under the Participation Contract and the Operating Agreements, the Treaty, and Ecuadorian and international law;\n\n(b) Ordering Respondents to declare null and void the *Caducidad* Decree and to reinstate fully OEPC's rights under the Participation Contract and the Operating Agreements;\n\n(c) Directing Respondents to indemnify Claimants for all damages caused as a result of their breaches, including costs and expenses of this proceeding, in amounts to be determined at the hearing, which Claimants believe will exceed US$1 billion;\n\n(d) Directing Respondents to pay Claimants interest on all sums awarded, in amounts to be determined at the hearing, and to order any such further relief as may be available and appropriate in the circumstances.\n\n107.\n\nThe Tribunal further recalls that, in response, the Respondent has denied the Claimants' allegations of breach and formulated a counterclaim as follows:\n\nEcuador respectfully requests that the Tribunal:\n\n1. Declare that Ecuador has complied with its obligations under the Participation Contract, Ecuadorian law, and the Treaty, and dismiss all of the Claimants' claims without prejudice.\n\n2. Declare that OEPC breached the Participation Contract by using diplomatic channels and making recourse to the U.S. Government in connection with disputes arising out of or relating to the performance of the Participation Contract in contravention of Clause 22.2.1.\n\n3. Declare that OEPC's claims in this arbitration were not made in good faith, and to the contrary, were asserted either negligently or with the intent to cause harm to Ecuador, and did in fact cause such harm.\n\n4. Declare that Ecuador suffered damages from OEPC's breaches of contract, malicious prosecution/abuse of rights, destruction of Block 15's operation, and failure to pay assignment fees, and order OEPC to pay such damages in an amount subject to proof;\n\n5. Order the Claimants to pay interest on such amount at the legal rate;\n\n6. Order the Claimants to pay the costs of this arbitration, including all costs paid to ICSID and to the Tribunal, plus Ecuador's attorneys' fees and disbursements, as well as interest on the foregoing.\n\n108.\n\nIn order to fully understand the Tribunal's analysis and findings on liability, it is necessary to set out at some length the factual matrix disclosed by the written and oral evidence presented by the parties during this arbitration. The Tribunal will now proceed to do so.\n\n**B. OEPC's Development and Operation of Ecuador's Block 15**\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n109.\n\nThe area of land in Ecuador known as Block 15 covers approximately 200,000 hectares and is located several hundred kilometres east of Quito in Ecuador's most prolific oil-producing region, known as the Oriente Basin, deep in the Ecuadorian Amazon rainforest.\n\n110.\n\nBlock 15 includes, in the western part, the producing fields of Limoncocha, Yanaquincha, and the Indillana Complex, and in the eastern part, the Ed\u00e9n Yuturi field. The Limoncocha and Ed\u00e9n Yuturi fields are located partially within, and partially outside Block 15. They straddle the border between Block 15 and properties managed by Petroproducci\u00f3n, the operating subsidiary of Petroecuador. Under Ecuador's Hydrocarbons Law (the \"HCL\"), fields such as these, once declared to be common to both a contractor and Petroecuador by the Minister of Energy and Mines, must be \"unitized\" and run jointly by the contractor and Petroproducci\u00f3n pursuant to unitized field agreements.\n\n111.\n\nOEPC's presence in Ecuador began on 25 January 1985, when it entered into a services contract with the *Corporaci\u00f3n Estatal Petrolera Ecuatoriana* (now Petroecuador).4 Pursuant to that contract, OEPC provided services related to the exploration and production of oil in Block 15 (the \"Services Contract\").\n\nToday, *Empresa P\u00fablica de Hidrocarburos del Ecuador*.\n\n112.\n\nUnder the terms of the Services Contract, OEPC provided 100% of the services required to produce oil in Block 15, ranging from identifying possible deposits through exploration to producing the oil out of the ground. If OEPC discovered oil, it was reimbursed for its costs and investments pursuant to various conditions and formulas in the contract. However, 100% of the crude oil produced belonged to Petroecuador.\n\n113.\n\nAt the time the Services Contract was signed, Block 15 remained relatively unexplored. Hence, OEPC's initial focus in the block was on identifying possible reserves for exploitation. After eight years of exploration, OEPC began production from Block 15 in 1993. In May 1993, OEPC and Petroecuador also signed a unitized field agreement for the joint operation of the Limoncocha field. That unitized field agreement was set to expire as soon as the Services Contract expired.\n\n**C. The Participation Contract**\n---------------------------------\n\n114.\n\nIn 1993, Ecuador amended its HCL to allow the negotiation of \"participation contracts.\" At its core, a participation contract is essentially a type of production sharing agreement: the State and contractors share in the production of crude oil, with all expenditures borne by the contractor. This contractual model gave producers a stake in the production that made exploration risks more palatable. Further, it guaranteed Ecuador a profit from its production share, since it no longer had any expenses associated with oil production.\n\n115.\n\nOEPC and Ecuador began the negotiation of their participation contract in January 1997. The negotiations took nearly two years, and the Participation Contract was finally signed on 21 May 1999 (the previously-defined \"Participation Contract\"). According to Clause 1, the contracting parties were the \"Republic of Ecuador, through [...] Petroecuador [...] [and] Occidental Exploration and Production Company, Ecuador Branch.\" Pursuant to Clause 6.1 of the Participation Contract, OEPC had the right to develop and to exploit the Indillana Complex, known as the Base Area in the Contract, until 2012, and other fields from which production began after the signing of the Participation Contract, such as the Ed\u00e9n Yuturi and Yanaquincha fields and potentially the Paka Sur and Paka Norte fields, until 2019.\n\n116.\n\nThe Participation Contract, which expressly stated that it was to be \"governed exclusively by Ecuadorian law,\" transformed the conditions under which OEPC operated in Ecuador. Pursuant to Clause 4.2 of the Participation Contract, OEPC would no longer be reimbursed for its expenditures in exploring and producing Block 15. In return for accepting the obligation to explore, develop and exploit Block 15, and being responsible for all the associated expenditures, OEPC received a share of the oil produced from Block 15, referred to as OEPC's \"participation\". Clause 4.3 provided that \"Contractor shall invest capital and use the personnel, equipment, machinery and technology needed for the faithful performance of such activities in consideration of which Contractor shall receive, as participation, the percentage of Fiscalized Production provided for in Clause 8.1.\" OEPC also had various other obligations under the Participation Contract, including payment of all Ecuadorian taxes and duties; periodic reporting of certain information to Ecuador; the establishment of good relations with the community; and the protection of the environment.\n\n117.\n\nThe amount of OEPC's participation was determined on the basis of the equation described in the above-referred Clause 8.1. That equation took into account several factors, including the field, the rate of production, and certain agreed-upon percentages. At the end of 2005, OEPC's participation was approximately 70% of the oil produced from Block 15. After payment of expenses, taxes and other assessments, however, between 1999 and 2006, OEPC allegedly received approximately 30% of total net profits.\n\n118.\n\nClause 8.5 established Ecuador's participation in the oil produced from Block 15. That participation was calculated as the balance of the oil produced from Block 15 over and above OEPC's participation. Pursuant to Clause 5.1.2, OEPC was obligated to \"[t]ransfer to Petroecuador the State Participation at the Fiscalization and Delivery Center.\"\n\n119.\n\nThe Tribunal notes, since this provision will be referred to later in the present Award, that OEPC was allowed to dispose freely of its share of the production from Block 15 as it wished. Under Clause 5.3.2, OEPC had the right to \"[r]eceive and freely dispose of Contractor participation as established in Clause 8.1 of this Participation Contract.\" While OEPC could freely dispose of its participation, its ability to transfer or assign its rights and obligations under the Participation Contract was subject to stringent conditions. Chapter 16 of the Participation Contract, entitled \"Transfer and Assignment\", sets forth these conditions in provisions which are at the heart of the parties' dispute in this arbitration. These provisions, which are considered in greater detail later in this Award, include the following:\n\n**16.1** Transfer of this Participation Contract or assignment to third parties of the rights under the Participation Contract, must have the authorization of the Corresponding Ministry, in accordance with existing laws and regulations, especially the provisions contained in Art. 79 of the Hydrocarbons Law and Executive Decrees No. 809, 2713 and 1179.\n\n**16.2** The prohibition to transfer or assign rights under this Participation Contract without the approval of the Corresponding Ministry, as determined in Art. 79 of the Hydrocarbons Law, is not an obstacle to freely trade Contractor's stock, without need of said authorization, provided that the trading of said stock does not change, modify or extinguish the legal existence of Contractor, nor constitute a decrease in its administrative, financial and technical capacities with reference to this Participation Contract.\n\n[...]\n\n**16.4** If Contractor deems it advisable to create consortia or associations for one or several exploration and exploitation activities covered by this Participation Contract, Contractor may do so with the prior acceptance of PETROECUADOR and authorization from the Corresponding Ministry. Contractor's obligations shall continue to exist in their parts, and the companies forming the consortium or association shall be jointly and severally liable for performance of same; and for such purpose shall furnish the corresponding guarantees. A joint and several commitment shall constitute an indispensable requirement for PETROECUADOR to accept the creation of the aforementioned consortia or associations. PETROECUADOR shall continue to maintain its direct legal relations with Contractor, to demand compliance with all obligations, and to pay the agreed participation percentages.\n\n**16.5** The integration of such consortia or associations, or the withdrawal of Contractor from same, without the authorization of the Corresponding Ministry, shall constitute legal grounds for declaring the termination of this Participation Contract.\n\n[...]\n\n120.\n\nThe Tribunal also notes that these provisions were mirrored in the \"Termination and Forfeiture [ *Caducidad* ]\" provisions of the Participation Contract, which stated that \"[t]his Participation Contract shall terminate,\" *inter alia*, as follows:\n\n**21.1.1** By a declaration of forfeiture [ *caducidad* ] issued by the Corresponding Ministry for the causes and following the procedure established in Articles seventy four (74), seventy five (75) and seventy six (76) of the Hydrocarbons Law, insofar as applicable.\n\n**21.1.2** Due to a transfer of rights and obligations of the Participation Contract without prior authorization from the Corresponding Ministry.\n\n[\u2026]\n\n**21.3** For the purposes of forfeiture and penalties, the provisions of Chapter IX of the Hydrocarbons Law shall be applicable.\n\n121.\n\nAt this juncture, the Tribunal also observes that these provisions of the Participation Contract refer to many of the provisions of Ecuador's HCL5, in particular the following:\n\n**CHAPTER IX**\n\n***Caducidad*****, Sanctions and Transfers**\n\nArt. 74. The Ministry of Energy and Mines may declare the *caducidad* of contracts, if the contractor:\n\n[\u2026]\n\n11. Transfers rights or enters into a private contract or agreement for the assignment of one or more of its rights, without the Ministry's authorization;\n\n12. Forms consortia or associations for exploration and exploitation operations, or withdraws from them, without the Ministry's authorization; and,\n\n13. Commits repeat violations of the Law and the regulations thereto.\n\nArt. 75. The declaration of *caducidad* of a contract implies the immediate return to the State of the contracted areas, and the delivery of all equipment, machinery and other exploration or production items, industrial or transportation installations, at no cost to PETROECUADOR and, also in addition, the automatic loss of bonds and securities provided under the Law and the contract, which shall remain to the benefit of the State.\n\nArt. 76. Before *caducidad* of a contract is declared, the Ministry of Energy and Mines shall notify the contractor, providing it not less than thirty and not more than sixty days from the date of the notification, to perform its unmet obligations or dismiss the charges.\n\nArt. 77. A breach of contract that does not cause *caducidad* effects or a violation of the Law or Regulations shall be punished with a fine imposed by the National Hydrocarbons Director, of two hundred to three thousand United States Dollars, depending on the seriousness of the violation, in addition to compensation for the damages caused.\n\n[\u2026]\n\nArt. 79. The transfer of a contract or the assignment to third parties of rights derived from a contract shall be null and void and shall have no validity whatsoever if there is no prior authorization from the Ministry of Energy and Mines, without prejudice to the declaration of *caducidad* as provided for in this Law.\n\nThe State shall receive a premium for the transfer and the beneficiary company shall enter into a new contract under more favourable economic conditions for the State and for PETROECUADOR than the ones contained in the original contract.\n\nAs will become apparent, the provisions of Article 74(11) and Article 79 are of central importance in this case.\n\nAs per the parties' agreed translation of the HCL in effect on 15 May 2006.\n\n**D. The Unitized Fields Joint Operating Agreements**\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n122.\n\nDuring the negotiation of the Participation Contract, OEPC sought to conclude an overall agreement that would allow it to receive the full benefits of operating Block 15. Thus, on the same day that the Participation Contract was signed, OEPC and Petroproducci\u00f3n also signed joint operating agreements for the unitized exploitation of the common reservoirs in both the Ed\u00e9n Yuturi and Limoncocha fields (the \"Unitized Fields Joint Operating Agreements\").\n\n123.\n\nPursuant to Clause 3.3 of the Unitized Fields Joint Operating Agreements, OEPC and Petroproducci\u00f3n agreed that \"[t]o obtain greater efficiency and economy in the operation, [...] the management of the Unitized Field shall be treated as part of the management of Block 15. Therefore, the same rights and obligations of the Parties under the Participation Contract, in whatever is pertinent, shall be applicable to this Operational Agreement.\"\n\n124.\n\nThere was one significant change to the terms of the Participation Contract with respect to these unitized fields. For the Limoncocha and Ed\u00e9n Yuturi fields, OEPC was not deemed the sole operator. Rather, unlike Clause 4.2 of the Participation Contract, which gave OEPC the \"exclusive right\" to develop and to produce from Block 15, Clause 5.1 of the Unitized Fields Joint Operating Agreements provided that \"[u]nder the scheme of Joint Management, Contractor and PETROPRODUCCION constitute the Operator for the Unitized Field[s], starting on the Effective Date of this Operational Agreement.\"\n\n125.\n\nThis joint operatorship was achieved through the establishment of a joint operating committee (the \"Unitized Fields Committee\"), which was the executive body charged with managing the joint operation of the Limoncocha and Ed\u00e9n Yuturi fields. Among other things, the Unitized Fields Committee approved the budgets and development plans, and was informed of the daily operations in the unitized fields.\n\n126.\n\nThe Tribunal observes that when the Participation Contract and the Unitized Fields Joint Operating Agreements were signed in 1999, OEPC was producing approximately 28,000 barrels per day from Block 15. After the signature of these agreements, OEPC began a significant capital expenditure program in Block 15 and allegedly increased daily production from Block 15 from approximately 28,000 barrels per day to over 100,000 barrels per day, a level of production it maintained through 2006. Production from the Ed\u00e9n Yuturi field allegedly accounted for the majority of this increase. During this period, the field was thus brought from being entirely undeveloped to producing 70% of the oil produced from Block 15.\n\n**E. The Farmout with AEC**\n---------------------------\n\n127.\n\nIn order to finance the expansion of its operations in Ecuador, OEPC sought an arrangement that could provide the necessary funds, as well as diversify and reduce its exposure. At the same time, Alberta Energy Corporation Ltd. (\"AEC\"), through the related entity AEC International (\"AECI\" or \"AEC\"), was looking to expand its investments in Ecuador. AEC had originally considered purchasing outright Block 15 from OEPC in 1999, together with two unrelated companies, City Investing and City Oriente, which operated blocks to the north of Block 15. However, while it did purchase the City companies that year, it did not approach OEPC about a purchase of Block 15 until 2000. On 15 May 2000, AEC made a formal proposal to OEPC to acquire OEPC's entire interest in Block 15. OEPC rejected AEC's proposal.\n\n128.\n\nAEC then proposed to \"farmin\" to Block 15. OEPC stated to the Tribunal that a farmout agreement with AEC was an attractive alternative because it allowed OEPC to continue to invest in Block 15 but with less of its own capital and to diversify its incountry risk. The negotiations led to the signing on 9 August 2000 of a Letter of Intent which described in some detail (at paragraph 1) the proposed farmout as a two-stage transaction as follows:\n\n1. **PROPOSED FARMIN TRANSACTION**\n\nAEC International a Business Unit of Alberta Energy Company Ltd., or its designated direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary (collectively hereinafter referred to as \"AECI\"), would acquire a 40% economic interest in Block 15 by farming it to OEPC's interest as follows (the \"Farmin Transaction\").\n\n(a) AECI would farmin to Block 15 to acquire a 40% economic interest in Block 15 from OEPC. The economic interest would be a \"working interest\" or \"participating interest\" except that it would not include nominal legal title to Block 15 or interest as a party to the Participation Contract. While OEPC would continue to own 100% of the legal title of the participating interest in Block 15 under the Participation Contract, OEPC would hold AECI's 40% economic interest as a \"nominee\" or \"bare trustee\" with the obligation to convey legal title, subject to government approvals, at a mutually agreeable time following AECI's payment of all amounts required to earn its interest. Prior to such conveyance, while OEPC holds AECI's interest in trust, OEPC shall be obligated to represent the interest of AECI, as if AECI were a participant with a 40% interest under the terms of a standard joint operating agreement to be mutually agreed. After such acquisition, the economic interests associated with Block 15 would be shared as follows (subject to paragraph (b) below):\n\nOEPC 60%\n\nAECI 40%\n\n(b) AECI would earn its 40% economic interest by paying a total of U.S. $180 million (subject to increase as described below) towards OEPC's share of Block 15 exploration and development expenditures. This U.S. $180 million shall be paid as U.S. $70 million as described in Clause 1(c) below, plus 90% of OEPC's 60% share (the \"OEPC Carry\") of: (A) the total capital expenditures to be incurred in connection with the development of Block 15, including, without limitation, costs associated with the construction of ancillary pipelines or facilities related to Block 15 crude oil production and (B) costs otherwise properly incurred under the Participation Contract for drilling, exploration or exploitation (collectively, \"Block 15 Capex\"), for the calendar years as set forth below (each, an \"Annual Carry Amount\"), pursuant to the following schedule:\n\nCalendar Year Annual Carry Amount\n\n2001 US$50 million\n\n2002 US$25 million\n\n2003 US$20 million\n\n2004 US$15 million\n\nFor each calendar year set forth above (each, a \"Year\") AECI shall pay its 40% share of Block 15 Capex plus the Annual Carry Amount to satisfy the OEPC Carry, and the Annual Carry Amount shall constitute a cap on AECI's obligation to pay the OEPC Carry; provided that:\n\n(i) if AECI satisfies the OEPC Carry for any Year, then additional Block 15 Capex for such Year, shall be shared among OEPC and AECI as set forth in paragraph (a) above;\n\n(ii) if the amount of the OEPC Carry for any Year except 2004 is less than the Annual Carry Amount for such Year, then AECI shall add 110% of the shortfall amount (the \"Carry Over Amount\") to the Annual Carry Amount for the following Year, thereby increasing the Annual Carry Amount for the following Year; and\n\n(iii) if the amount of the OEPC Carry for 2004 is less than the Annual Carry Amount for such Year, then AECI shall pay to OEPC, on or before January 31, 2005, an amount equal to the shortfall amount as an advance by AECI to OEPC of OEPC's 60% share of Block 15 Capex to be incurred thereafter. AECI and OEPC shall each act in good faith and use reasonable efforts to conduct development, drilling, exploration and exploitation operations on Block 15 so as to minimize the shortfall amount for 2004.\n\n(c) AECI shall pay to OEPC, on the Closing Date, as hereinafter defined, the sum of U.S. $70 million as an advance by AECI to OEPC of OEPC's 60% share of Block 15 Capex incurred after the Effective Date, as hereinafter defined, in excess of the OEPC Carry. Notwithstanding OEPC's obligation ultimately to use this U.S. $70 million and any shortfall amount payable to OEPC pursuant to Clause 1(b)(iii) above for its 60% share of Block 15 Capex, nothing herein shall prohibit, limit, or otherwise restrict OEPC, in the meanwhile, from loaning all or any portion of such U.S. $70 million and/or such shortfall amount to one or more of its affiliates, at a reasonable fair market interest, with such interest to be for OEPC's account and used to pay OEPC's Block 15 Capex incurred after the Effective Date in excess of OEPC Carry.\n\n(d) The effective date of the proposed Farmin Transaction shall be August 1, 2000 (the \"Effective Date\"), and the closing date shall be at a time and date mutually agreed by the Parties and as soon thereafter as practicable (the \"Closing Date\"), subject to satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in Section 5 of this letter. On the Closing Date AECI shall acquire, effective as of the Effective Date, a 40% economic interest in Block 15 and 40% of OEPC's (or its affiliate's, as the case may be) interest, if any, in the OCP Pipeline Project.\n\n(e) Each of Alberta Energy Company Ltd. and Occidental Oil and Gas Corporations will cause their respective subsidiaries to perform their obligations under the Transaction Documents (as defined below).\n\n(f) OEPC will be the Operator under the Joint Operating Agreement.\n\n129.\n\nNegotiations continued through the late summer and early fall. On 19 October 2000, the parties signed the Farmout Agreement (the \"Farmout\" or \"Farmout Agreement\"), which contained the terms originally outlined in the Letter of Intent. The parties also signed an operating agreement for the purpose of implementing the Farmout (the \"Joint Operating Agreement\" or \"JOA\" and, together with the Farmout Agreement, the \"Farmout Agreements\"). The parties did not, however, close the deal until 31 October 2000. The contract was made retroactive to 1 October 2000, *i.e.* the beginning of the fourth quarter.\n\n130.\n\nThe Farmout, an agreement governed by the laws of New York, provided for two phases. In the first phase of the transaction AEC purchased a 40% so-called \"economic interest\" in Block 15. Essentially, through contributions to OEPC's Block 15 investments, AEC purchased the right to 40% of OEPC's share of Block 15's production. This stage of the Farmout was described in Article II, titled \"Farmout of Interest in Farmout Property\". The central provisions of Article II of the Farmout provided as follows:\n\nArt. 2.01 Effective as of the Effective Time, and subject to obtaining required governmental approvals, if any, OEPC agrees at Closing (as defined in Section 2.06) to farm out and transfer to AECI, and AECI agrees at Closing to assume all obligations that originate, accrue or arise after the Effective Time with respect to, a 40% economic interest (the \"Farmout Interest\") in the Farmout Property, subject, however, to payment by AECI of the amounts required to earn such interest as hereinafter provided and subject to the terms and provisions set out hereinafter. The Farmout Interest to be transferred to AECI as of the Effective Time includes a \"working interest\" or \"participating interest\" in the Participating Agreements and Block 15 except that it does not include nominal legal title to an interest in Block 15 or an interest as a party to the Participating Agreements. OEPC shall continue to own 100% of the legal title to the Participating Agreements and to the interests in Block 15 granted or provided for in the Participating Agreements; provided that from and after the Effective Time OEPC shall hold legal title to the interest in the Farmout Property represented by the Farmout Interest of AECI in the Participating Agreements and Block 15 as a \"nominee\" with the obligation to convey legal title to such interest to AECI, subject to obtaining required governmental approvals, promptly following AECI's payment of all amounts required to earn the interest in the Farmout Property represented by the Farmout Interest as hereafter provided and the expenditure of such amounts by OEPC as Operator under the JOA for Block 15 Capex (as hereinafter defined). Prior to such conveyance, while OEPC holds legal title to AECI's interest in the Farmout Property on behalf of AECI, OEPC shall be obligated, at the sole risk, cost and expense of AECI, to act with respect to the Farmout Interest of AECI as AECI shall direct from time to time as if AECI were a party to the Participating Agreements owning legal title to a 40% interest in the Participating Agreements and the interests therein granted in Block 15, subject to and in accordance with the terms and provisions of the JOA provided for in Section 2.02.\n\n[\u2026]\n\nArt. 2.03 For such period of time that under Ecuadorian law OEPC holds legal title to the Farmout Interest on behalf of AECI pursuant to this Agreement, OEPC and AECI recognize and agree that taxable items attributable to the Farmout Interest will be required to be included on the Ecuadorian tax returns of OEPC's branch registered in Ecuador and that OEPC will pay AECI's Farmout Interest share of Ecuadorian Tax on behalf of AECI. If Closing occurs, AECI agrees to reimburse OEPC for any Ecuadorian Taxes payable by OEPC, or its Ecuador branch, that are attributable to the Farmout Interest. [...]\n\n[...]\n\nArt. 2.07 If all required governmental approvals, if any, for the transfer to AECI of the Farmout Interest pursuant to Section 2.01 (being the transfer of an economic interest in the Farmout Property as provided therein as opposed to the transfer of a legal title interest as provided for in Section 4.01) have not been obtained on or before March 31, 2001 then any party hereto may elect, at its option, to terminate this Agreement by written notice of termination delivered to the other parties, whereupon this Agreement shall terminate without any further liability or obligation on the part of any party hereto. [\u2026]\n\n131.\n\nThe second stage of the Farmout was described in Article IV of the Farmout Agreement, titled \"Assignment of Legal Title.\" Article 4.01 provided that this phase could not occur until and unless two conditions were met: AEC had made the required payments, and the Government had given its prior authorization:\n\nArt. 4.01 Promptly after AECI has made all payments of the OEPC Carry provided for in Sections 3.03, 3.04 and 3.05 and OEPC as Operator under the JOA has expended such amounts for Block 15 Capex, OEPC and AECI shall execute and deliver such documents as are required to convey legal title to AECI in and to a 40% economic interest in the Participating Agreements and Block 15 and to make AECI a party to the Participating Agreements as owner of such 40% economic interest (subject to obtaining required governmental approvals). Any transfer fees or administrative charges imposed by any government agency or department with respect to such transactions shall be paid by AECI.\n\n132.\n\nIn exchange for its economic interest in the production from Block 15, AEC agreed to pay 40% of all the capital and operating expenses in developing Block 15. Article 2.02 of the Farmout provided:\n\nAs between OEPC and [AEC], [AEC] upon Closing shall be obligated and agrees to perform all obligations and to bear and pay all costs, charges, expenses and liabilities attributable to the Farmout Interest in the Participating Agreements and Block 15 [...].\n\n133.\n\nAEC also agreed to pay approximately $180 million towards OEPC's historical development costs. Under Article 3.02, approximately $70 million was to be paid upon Closing. Pursuant to Article 3.03, AEC's payment of the remaining amount was spread over four years according to the following schedule: $50 million in 2001, $25 million in 2002, $20 million in 2003 and $15 million in 2004.\n\n134.\n\nThe Joint Operating Agreement refers to the Farmout at Article 3.2.1 as follows:\n\nPursuant to the provisions of the Farmout Agreement, AECI has on the Effective Date a forty percent (40%) interest in the Participating Agreements that until the Transfer Date shall be equivalent economically to, but shall not include, nominal legal title and, thereafter, shall include legal title. As between OEPC and AECI, AECI shall be obligated and agrees to perform all obligations and to bear and pay all costs, charges, expenses and liabilities attributable to the Farmout Interest in the Participating Agreements and Block 15, and shall be entitled to the rights and benefits attributable to such Farmout Interest, accruing from and after and attributable to periods of time after 4:00 a.m. local time in Ecuador on the Effective Date under and subject to the terms and provisions of this Agreement, in the same manner and to the same extent as if AECI held legal title to a 40% economic interest as a participant in the Participating Agreements and Block 15 as a Non-Operator under this Agreement, both prior to and after legal title to the 40% interest comprising the Farmout Interest in the Participating Agreements and Block 15 is conveyed from OEPC and AECI pursuant to Section 4.01 of the Farmout Agreement. Likewise, as between OEPC and AECI, subject to the provisions of Article III of the Farmout Agreement, OEPC shall be obligated to perform all obligations and to bear and pay all costs, charges, expenses and liabilities attributable to the remaining 60% interest in the Participating Agreements and Block 15 owned and held by OEPC for its own account, and shall be entitled to the rights and benefits attributable to such remaining 60% interest, accruing from and after and attributable to periods of time after the Effective Time under and subject to the terms and provisions of this Agreement applicable to OEPC as Operator and owner of such remaining 60% interest. This results in the following effective Participating Interests, for purposes of this Agreement.\n\nOEPC 60%\n\nAECI 40%\n\n135.\n\nPursuant to Article 4.2.1 of the Joint Operating Agreement, OEPC, as sole operator, had \"all of the rights, functions and duties of [the] Operator under the Participating Agreements [ *i.e.* the Participation Contract and Unitized Fields Joint Agreements] and [...]shall conduct all Joint Operations.\" As defined in Article 1.40 of the Joint Operating Agreement, a Joint Operation is an \"operation[ ] or activit[y] carried out by [the] Operator pursuant to this Agreement for Block 15 [...], the costs of which are chargeable to all Parties.\"\n\n136.\n\nUnder the Joint Operating Agreement, a two-member management committee was established, with OEPC and AEC each electing one member (the \"Management Committee\"). Pursuant to Article 5.2 of the Joint Operating Agreement, the Management Committee had the \"power and duty to authorize and supervise Joint Operations that are necessary or desirable to fulfill the Participating Agreements and properly explore and exploit the Agreement Area in accordance with this Agreement and in a manner appropriate in the circumstances.\" That responsibility was to be exercised \"[w]ithout prejudice to the rights and duties of Operator under this Agreement.\"\n\n137.\n\nFurthermore, Article 4.2.2 provided that \"[i]n the conduct of Joint Operations Operator shall [...] [p]erform Joint Operations in accordance with the provisions of the Participating Agreements, this Agreement, and the approvals and instructions of the Management Committee not in conflict with this Agreement [...].\"\n\n138.\n\nFinally, Article 5.13.5 provided that \"[n]o decision of the Management Committee shall be binding if it conflicts with a decision by any Integrated Management Committee with Petroecuador for the Eden-Yuturi Unit or the Limoncocha Unit or any other unit in which all or any portion of Block 15 is hereafter unitized.\" AEC had no representation on the Unitized Fields Committee.\n\n**F. The OCP Pipeline**\n-----------------------\n\n139.\n\nAt the time the Participation Contract was signed, the only way of bringing oil from the Oriente Basin to the coast for export was through the aging state-owned pipeline, known as the SOTE. By that time, however, the SOTE was already operating at its maximum capacity, and was not capable of transporting the heavier variety of crude that OEPC found in the Ed\u00e9n Yuturi field.\n\n140.\n\nThe idea for a new pipeline running from the Oriente Basin to the coast at Esmeraldas was first considered by a consortium of foreign producers in 1998, but Ecuador eventually decided to place the contract to build the pipeline out for bid. To this end, Occidental and other foreign oil companies operating in Ecuador formed two companies, Oleoducto de Crudos Pesados (OCP) Ltd. (\"OCP Ltd.\") and its wholly owned operating subsidiary, Oleoducto de Crudos Pesados (OCP) Ecuador S.A. (\"OCP S.A.\").\n\n141.\n\nIn August 2000, OCP Ltd. submitted its bid to construct the pipeline. Ecuador selected OCP Ltd.'s bid over the bids of two other groups in the final quarter of 2000, and the deal was finalized between November 2000 and February 2001. The OCP project was of such importance to Ecuador that the then Minister of Energy and Mines, Pablo Ter\u00e1n, personally conducted the negotiations.\n\n142.\n\nOccidental originally took a 24% equity interest in OCP Ltd. However, Occidental subsequently transferred 40% of that interest to AEC, which reduced Occidental's interest to 14.3%. Because of several further minor and unrelated revisions to OCP Ltd.'s ownership structure, Occidental's interest in OCP Ltd. was subsequently reduced to 14.15%.\n\n143.\n\nOn 15 February 2001, OCP Ltd. and Ecuador signed the \"Contract to Construct and Operate the Heavy Crude Oil Pipeline and Provision of Public Services for Transportation of Hydrocarbons\" (the \"OCP Contract\"). Subsequently, on 3 July 2001, OCP Ltd. signed an approximately $700 million contract with Techint International Construction Corporation to build the OCP pipeline. Construction was completed in August 2003. The total cost of the OCP project was approximately $1.5 billion. The pipeline runs 500 kilometres from Lago Agrio in the Oriente Basin to Balao in the province of Esmeraldas on the Pacific coast, and ascends and descends nearly 3,000 meters in elevation during that span. It has a capacity of 450,000 barrels per day, though it has never reached that capacity. The first oil was shipped through the OCP pipeline in the fall of 2003.\n\n144.\n\nThe OCP pipeline was financed through a combination of equity contributions by the owners of OCP Ltd., guaranteed debt, and financing from lenders. As of 2004, Occidental had made equity contributions of $78 million to the $1.5 billion project and guaranteed debt worth $118 million.\n\n145.\n\nOCP Ltd. secured the majority of the financing through the ship-or-pay commitments from the pipeline's users. These commitments were contained in agreements between the users and OCP S.A. called Initial Shipper Transportation Agreements (\"ISTAs\"). OEPC entered into such an ISTA with OCP S.A. on 30 January 2001, as subsequently amended on 29 May 2001 and 31 July 2001.\n\n146.\n\nPursuant to the ship-or-pay commitments, each sponsor purchased a certain amount of pipeline capacity, and agreed to pay for that capacity, even if the sponsor did not use it. OEPC had originally planned on purchasing 70,000 barrels per day of such guaranteed capacity. Following the Farmout, however, OEPC committed in its ISTA to 42,000 barrels per day. The difference, 40% or 28,000 barrels per day, was purchased by AEC in performance of the Farmout.\n\n**G. The Farmout and Ecuador**\n------------------------------\n\n147.\n\nOn 24 October 2000, senior executives of both OEPC and AEC flew to Quito from the United States and Canada in order to meet with the Minister of Energy and Mines, Pablo Teran, in the Minister's office. The purpose of the meeting was to inform the Minister about the Farmout and discuss the commitment to the OCP pipeline and new projects in Ecuador. Casey Olson, then Executive Vice President for Business Development of Occidental, and Paul MacInnes, then President and General Manager of OEPC, attended this meeting on behalf of OEPC. Steven Bell, then Vice President International of AEC, and Stephen Newton, then President and General Manager of AEC Ecuador, attended on behalf of AEC. Minister Teran was the only representative of Ecuador present at the meeting.\n\n148.\n\nThere were two distinct subject matters which were addressed during the meeting and the meeting itself had two distinct phases. The purpose of the first session, which lasted about 45 minutes, was to present the Farmout to Minister Teran and was attended by both the OEPC and AEC officials. In the second session, attended only by the OEPC officials and Minister Ter\u00e2n, the parties discussed new projects in Ecuador that OEPC was interested in pursuing.\n\n149.\n\nThere is much controversy in this proceeding about what was said, or not said, during the first session of this meeting. The Tribunal will analyze in a later Section of the present Award6 the meeting of 24 October and subsequent events. In this Section, the Tribunal will only set out the facts which inform the background of the arbitration.\n\nSee*infra,* Part V.B.1.\n\n150.\n\nBoth parties acknowledge that no copy of the Farmout Agreement or the Joint Operating Agreement were handed to Minister Ter\u00e2n during the meeting.\n\n151.\n\nThe next day, on 25 October 2000, Mr. MacInnes wrote to Minister Ter\u00e2n regarding the previous day's meeting. Mr. MacInnes wrote that the Farmout was an \"imminent transaction pursuant to which [OEPC] intends to transfer to [AEC] 40% of its economic interest in the Participation Contract.\" Mr. MacInnes also wrote that, following that first stage of the transaction, \"OEPC will continue being the only \u2018Contractor' entity under the Contract for Block 15;\" and that \"once [AEC] has complied with its obligations contemplated in the transfer agreement, OEPC shall transfer to [AEC] the legal title corresponding to 40% of its interests [...] subject to the approvals that the Government of Ecuador may require at that time.\" The letter ended with a request to the Minister to \"confirm [...] [the] consent with respect to the aforementioned transfer of economic interests in favor of [AEC].\"\n\n152.\n\nAs explained later in this Award, one of the central issues in this proceeding is whether, during the meeting of 24 October 2000, Minister Ter\u00e1n in fact indicated that government approval was (or was not) required for the transfer of the economic interest to AEC under the Farmout. In this regard, the Tribunal notes that upon closing the Farmout on 31 October 2000, OEPC and AEC entered into a letter agreement mutually waiving satisfaction of any required government approvals for the first stage of the Farmout. That letter also expressly envisaged the requirement of government approval for the contemplated future transfer of legal title to AEC.\n\n153.\n\nImmediately after the Farmout's closing, on 1 November 2000, OEPC's ultimate parent, OPC, issued a press release announcing the Farmout. The press release confirmed that OEPC would remain the operator of Block 15 and that AEC would receive a 40% economic interest in the operations.\n\n154.\n\nBetween late October and late November 2000, there were some meetings between Mr. MacInnes and Petroecuador's then Executive President, Mr. Rodolfo Barniol, during which the Farmout was mentioned.\n\n155.\n\nOn 8 November 2000, a memorandum was sent by the Director, Operations Control to the Director of Hydrocarbons Economy in the Ministry of Energy and Mines. It read as follows:\n\nSUBJECT: TRANSFER OF 40% OF THE ECONOMIC INTERESTS OF THE BLOCK 15 PARTICIPATION CONTRACT BY OCCIDENTAL EXPLORATION TO CITY INVESTING COMPANY\n\nWith regard to letter No. GG-014-00 dated October 25, 2000, in which Occidental reports the transfer of 40% of the economic interests in the Participation Contract for Hydrocarbons Production and Additional Exploration for Block 15, including the OEPC rights in the Unified Production Operating Agreements for the Unified Ed\u00e9n Yuturi and Limoncocha Fields to City Investing Company, I would like to inform you of the following:\n\nCity Investing currently has a Participation Contract with the Government in the Tarapoa Block and Fanny-18B and Mariann-4A Unified Fields and is the current operator of the aforementioned Fields. Therefore, it has proven that it has technical solvency, and for this reason, there would be no impediment for that assignment of rights.\n\n156.\n\nIn a letter dated 22 November 2000, the Director of the National Hydrocarbons Directorate (\"DNH\"), Dr. Ra\u00fal Salgado, wrote to OEPC requesting information regarding the technical and financial capabilities of AEC. This letter states:\n\nBACKGROUND:\n\nIn communication GG-014-00 dated October 25, 2000, the company you represent requests authorization to transfer 40% of the rights it has in Block 15, including the Operational Agreements for Unified Exploitation of the Unified Fields Ed\u00e9n Yuturi and Limoncocha, in favor of City Investing Company.\n\nANALYSIS:\n\nAccording to stipulations in Art. 3 of Executive Decree No. 2713, published in Official Register No. 694 of May 12, 1995, in which the Regulations to Art. 79 of the Hydrocarbons Law were issued, the total or partial transfer of rights and obligations derived from a contract cannot for any reason originate the deterioration of the financial solvency or operational capacity of the contractor, nor can it negatively affect the work and investment chronogram contemplated in the original contract or the economic participation of the State and PETROECUADOR.\n\nIn view of this, the Minister of Energy and Mines, previous to the authorization to transfer said rights and obligations, must make a technical - economic analysis with the purpose of guaranteeing the work and operation of this current contract.\n\nCONCLUSION:\n\nThe National Direction of Hydrocarbons, as a technical organism of the Ministry of Energy and Mines, requires information to guarantee the economic solvency of the company City Investing Company Limited, regarding:\n\nIncome Tax Declarations for the last two years.\n\nBalances audited and duly notarized, for the last two years.\n\n157.\n\nDr. Salgado then met with OEPC's Vice President of Government Relations, Mr. Fernando Albuja, and two other OEPC representatives on 14 December 2000 in his office to discuss OEPC's October 25 letter to Minister Teran.\n\n158.\n\nOn 12 January 2001, Dr. Salgado sent a memorandum to Minister Teran which reads, in full, as follows:\n\nBACKGROUND:\n\nThrough letter GG-014-00 dated October 25, 2000, Occidental Exploration and Production Company informed the Ministry of Energy and Mines of its intent to assign 40% of the rights and obligations for Block 15 to City Investing Company in the future, including the Unified Production Operating Agreements for the Unified Ed\u00e9n Yuturi and Limoncocha Fields.\n\nANALYSIS:\n\nAt a meeting held on December 14 of this year at the Department of Hydrocarbons Economy of this National Office, executives from Occidental stated that the company is negotiating with City Investing Company to transfer 40% of the rights and obligations it has in Block 15. They will report the decision when they reach a final agreement.\n\nThe representatives of this National Office explained to the company that when they decide to assign the rights, they must request authorization from the Ministry of Energy and Mines; otherwise, any participation of City Investing Company in the current contract would be null and void, as stipulated by Executive Decree No. 809 that issued the Regulations for Article 79 of the Hydrocarbons Act, published in Official Gazette No. 197 of May 31, 1985.\n\nCONCLUSIONS:\n\nFrom the explanation given by executives from Occidental Exploration and Production Company, we can conclude that the Company is not requesting authorization to transfer rights, but only reporting on a possible transaction to be made in the immediate future.\n\nWhen the company decides to make that transfer, it will request the corresponding approval from the Ministry of Energy and Mines, which will be legalized after payment of the premiums for transfer and improvement of the economic conditions of the contract.\n\nThe only company that will continue to participate in the current contract with the Ecuadorian Government will be Occidental Exploration and Production Company, owner of 100% of the shares.\n\n159.\n\nFinally, on 17 January 2001, Minister Ter\u00e2n responded to OEPC's letter of 25 October 2000, noting the company's \"intention to transfer in the future 40% of the rights and obligations of block 15,\" and indicating that such a future transfer would require prior government approval. Minister Ter\u00e2n also stated that OEPC \"shall be the sole company that will continue participating in the current contract with the Ecuadorian State since it is the owner of 100% of the rights and obligations.\" This letter, which tracks language from the 12 January 2001 memorandum quoted above, reads in full as follows:\n\nI acknowledge receipt of your letter GG-014-00, dated October 25, 2000, in which the company that you represent made know to this Minister its intention to transfer in the future 40% of the rights and obligations of block 15, including the Operating Agreements for the Unified Exploitation of the Eden-Yuturi and Limoncocha Fields in favor of City Investing Company, and further to the meeting with officers of Occidental, please be advised of the following:\n\nExecutive Decree No. 809, which contains the Regulation to Art. 79 of the Hydrocarbons Law, published in the Official Register No. 197, dated May 31, 1985, in its Article I stipulates that the total or partial transfer of rights and obligations derived from a contract may be assigned in favor of third parties with the prior authorization of the Corresponding Ministry, otherwise such transfer will be invalid and may give rise to the contract's termination.\n\nIn the meeting held at the National Directorate of Hydrocarbons, officers from Occidental said that the 40% transfer of rights and obligations previously mentioned would not be implemented at the moment, therefore once the company you represent decides to perform said transfer, you must request to this State Ministry the corresponding authorization and the issuance of the Ministerial Decree through which such transfer will be legalized, with the prior payment of the transfer fees and enhancement of the economic conditions of the contract, as it is stipulated in Art. 1 of the Executive Decree 2731, published in the Official Register No. 694, dated May 12, 1995.\n\nIt is important to point out that Occidental Exploration and Production Company shall be the sole company that will continue participating in the current contract with the Ecuadorian State since it is the owner of 100% of the rights and obligations.\n\n160.\n\nThe record does not disclose any response on the part of OEPC to Minister Teran's letter of 17 January 2001.\n\n**H. The Moores Rowland Audit**\n-------------------------------\n\n161.\n\nThe issue of transfer of rights by OEPC to AEC surfaced again when, in 2003, the audit firm Moores Rowland Ecuador (\"Moores Rowland\") was retained by the DNH to conduct the audit of OEPC. During their audit, Moores Rowland analyzed invoices from OEPC to AEC for the sale of crude oil during the calendar year 2002 and, in this connection, asked OEPC on 29 January 2004 to examine the contract between OEPC and AEC in virtue of which these sales took place.\n\n162.\n\nShortly thereafter, on 9 February 2004, Moores Rowland wrote to the DNH regarding the \"current situation and decision of the Ministry of Energy and Mines\" in connection with OEPC's \"transfer in the future [of] 40% of the rights and obligations of Block 15\" to AEC.\n\n163.\n\nMoores Rowland was then provided with unsigned but true copies of both the Farmout Agreement and the Joint Operating Agreement by Mr. Fabian Revelo of OEPC. These copies were later given by Moores Rowland to Dr. Patricia Zurita, the DNH audits coordinator.\n\n164.\n\nMoores Rowland requested from OEPC an executed copy of its agreements with AEC. OEPC decided not to accede to this request. The Tribunal notes the following internal OEPC email of 8 March 2004:\n\nWe are not going to provide a copy of the agreement with Encana to the DNH auditors. Informally, the DNH auditors have told us that not providing them with a copy will determine the inclusion of a paragraph called \"limitaci\u00f3n al alcance\" (limitation to the audit scope). I consider we shall do nothing until the auditors issue they [ *sic* ] report and/or DNH request us information on the deal with AEC.\n\n165.\n\nOn 15 March 2004, Mr. MacInnes wrote to Moores Rowland as follows:\n\nIn the year 2000, OEPC and AEC Ecuador signed an agreement by means of which, subject to satisfying certain conditions and subject to approvals required by the Ecuadorian Government, they committed themselves to transfer in the future the legal title corresponding to 40% interest in the Contract for Block 15 and the Operation Agreements for Unified Exploitation. OEPC informed this to the Ministry of Energy and Mines in letter GG-014-00 of October 25, 2000. In said communication, we also stated that the Company I represent will continue being the only one responsible for total obligations under the Participation Contract for Block 15 until the indicated conditions are fulfilled and receive the required approvals.\n\nConsistent with the above, OEPC is the only entity that maintains signed with the Ecuadorian State the Participation Contract for Block 15, including the year 2002, period that corresponds to the Cost Auditing that the Firm Moores Rowland Ecuador Cia. Ltda. is performing in representation of the National Direction of Hydrocarbons (\"DNH\"). Therefore, OEPC exercised and assumed, in the year 2002, 100% of the rights and obligations derived from the Participation Contract for Block 15.\n\n[...]\n\nDuring the 2004 exercise, the conditions agreed upon between OEPC and AEC Ecuador will have been fulfilled for transfer of the legal title corresponding to 40% of the rights and obligations in the Contract for Block 15 and in the Operational Agreements for Unified Exploitation. Therefore, in accordance with letter GG-014-00 from OEPC and Official Letter No. 003-DNH-EH-CE-P1, 01-0079, issued in response by the Minister of Energy and Mines, OEPC will ask for the authorizations that may be required to make the transfer according to applicable legal, regulatory, and contractual provisions, after the referred conditions have been satisfied.\n\n166.\n\nAs part of the audit process, Moores Rowland then requested from OEPC that they sign a representation letter. OEPC did so on 12 July 2004, and included a representation to the effect that it had provided Moores Rowland with a copy of the \"Agreement with Alberta Energy Corp.\":\n\n2. We have placed at your disposal:\n\n[...]\n\nd) The Agreement with Alberta Energy Corp - AEC, formally City Investing, which, once the conditions set forth in such agreement have been met, and subject to the authorizations from Petroecuador and the Ministry of Energy and Mines, would culminate in the assignment of 40% of the rights and obligations of the Participation Contract for the Exploration and Exploitation of Hydrocarbons in Block 15 of the Ecuador Amazon Region and the unified fields of Ed\u00e9n Yuturi and Limoncocha; [\u2026]\n\n167.\n\nMoores Rowland issued its audit report on 14 July 2004, noting therein that the assignment of rights and obligations contemplated in the Farmout was made contingent on future events and that the assignment \"might or might not happen\" at the end of the four years during which the conditions were to be satisfied. The audit report recommended to the DNH that OEPC seek government authorization for the assignment during that year, assuming the assignment conditions were satisfied, and that the required ministerial approval be granted to OEPC in order to properly register the assignment.\n\n168.\n\nThe evidence discloses that, by February 2004, AEC had made all payments due to OEPC under the Farmout. The day after Moores Rowland issued its audit report, on 15 July 2004, OEPC wrote to the new Minister of Energy and Mines, Mr. Eduardo L\u00f3pez Robayo, \"request[ing] the Ministry to approve the transfer by OEPC to AEC Ecuador of legal title to a 40% interest\" in Block 15, as contemplated under the Farmout. In making this request, OEPC referred to its letter of 25 October 2000, as well as Minister Teran's response of 17 January 2001.\n\n169.\n\nThe approval sought by OEPC was not granted. Rather, on 24 August 2004, as set forth in more detail later in this Award, the Attorney General of Ecuador ordered the Ministry of Mines and Energy to terminate the Participation Contract and the Unitized Fields Joint Operating Agreements through a declaration of *caducidad*.\n\n**I. The VAT Dispute**\n----------------------\n\n170.\n\nIn August 2001, Ecuador's tax authority, the SRI, contrary to its established practice of refunding value added taxes (\"VAT\") to oil companies, refused to grant such refunds in the future and, retroactively, claimed refunds of the taxes already paid. OEPC interpreted this decision to be a violation of Ecuadorian tax laws and the Treaty and, in November 2002, filed an international arbitration claim against Ecuador to recover the VAT refunds.\n\n171.\n\nOn 1 July 2004, the VAT Tribunal issued a $75 million VAT Award in OEPC's favor, finding that Ecuador's conduct had been unfair and discriminatory. The VAT Award was sent to the parties on 12 July 2004, and was immediately made public.\n\n172.\n\nEcuador challenged the award in the English courts. Its annulment application was rejected by the High Court on 2 March 2006 and that decision was confirmed by the Court of Appeal on 4 July 2007.\n\n**J. The** ***Caducidad*** **Proceedings and Related Events**\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n173.\n\nOn 20 July 2004, Gerald Ellis and Fernando Albuja met with Minister L\u00f3pez for the purpose of introducing Mr. Ellis as the new President and General Manager of OEPC. There is evidence in the record that, during this meeting, the Minister referred to the VAT Award as well as OEPC's alleged failure to comply with Ecuadorian laws and regulations.\n\n174.\n\nAt around the same time, the Attorney General of Ecuador went to London to consult with Ecuador's attorneys with respect to a possible application before courts in London for the annulment of the VAT Award. In the course of an interview where the validity of the VAT Award was referred to, the Attorney General responded that \"[w]e do not recognize it, and so much so that we will propose its nullity. Now, I am also studying the contract linking Occidental with the country. I want to check whether the contractual norms have been strictly complied with.\"\n\n175.\n\nUpon his return from London, in the course of a radio interview, the Attorney General stated:\n\nIn August 2004, once I came back from London, I went to the Energy Ministry and asked the Hydrocarbons Directorate to present me all the documentation that proved whether or not the Occidental Company was fulfilling the contract. Once the information was checked, after twelve hours of work, we concluded that this company had been in breach of contract.\n\n176.\n\nOn 3 August 2004, following receipt of OEPC's request for approval of the transfer to AEC of legal title to a 40% interest in Block 15, Dr. Zurita, the DNH audits coordinator, submitted a memorandum to the National Director of Hydrocarbons. After reviewing the terms of the 25 October 2000 letter from OEPC and the 17 January 2001 reply from Minister Ter\u00e1n, Dr. Zurita concluded as follows:\n\nAccording to the abovementioned, it is determined that Occidental exploration and Production Company on year 2000 carried out a transfer of the 40% of its rights and obligations in Block 15, including the Operational Agreements de Unified Exploitation of the Unified Fields Eden Yuturi and Limoncocha, in favor of City Investing Company, currently Alberta Energy Company based on a private agreement executed between the parties, which effective date was October 1, 2000, transfer that was carried out without authorization of the corresponding Ministry.\n\n177.\n\nA few weeks later, on 24 August 2004, the Attorney General wrote to the Minister of Energy and Mines, Mr. L\u00f3pez, and requested that he terminate the Participation Contract. The Attorney General asserted that, in 2000:\n\n[OEPC] transferred 40% interests and obligations from the Participation Contract for Exploration and Exploitation of Hydrocarbons in Block 15 in favor of [AEC], **without having received the authorization of the Ministry of Energy and Mines,** as provided by Article 79 of the Hydrocarbons Law and the same Participation Contract. (Emphasis in original)\n\n178.\n\nThe Attorney General also alleged that OEPC had committed a number of technical infractions, which, he claimed, constituted a cause for termination under Articles 74.13 and 77 of the HCL. Finally, in that letter, the Attorney General stated that OEPC had not fulfilled its investment obligations with respect to Block 15, which, he claimed, constituted a cause for termination of the Participation Contract under Article 74.6 of the HCL.\n\n179.\n\nOn the same day, the Attorney General sent a letter to the Executive President of PetroEcuador requesting that PetroEcuador follow the process set out in Clause 21.2 of the Participation Contract. The Tribunal recalls that Clause 21.2 provides that, in cases where there may be cause for forfeiture (*i.e*. *caducidad*) of the contract, PetroEcuador must serve OEPC with a notice of non-compliance and provide OEPC ten days to deny or accept the allegation. If OEPC admitted the allegation of non-compliance, it had thirty days to cure its breach.\n\n180.\n\nIn a letter to the Executive President of PetroEcuador dated 8 September 2004, Minister L\u00f3pez, acting upon the Attorney General's request of 24 August 2004, instructed PetroEcuador to initiate the termination procedure. The Minister's letter attached OEPC's request of 15 July 2004 for the transfer to AEC of 40% of the legal title to Block 15, the Farmout Agreement and the Joint Operating Agreement, as well as a report from the DNH listing various technical infractions committed by OEPC. Acting on Minister L\u00f3pez's letter, on 15 September 2004, PetroEcuador notified OEPC of its alleged non-compliance with the Participation Contract. This notification gave OEPC ten business days to respond to the allegations. On 24 September 2004, OEPC sent a detailed 28-page letter to PetroEcuador denying the Attorney General's allegations.\n\n181.\n\nNothing further happened until the first few months of 2005 when anti-American and anti-foreign investor groups of demonstrators protested in the streets of Quito, in particular in front of OEPC's offices. The demonstrators voiced their concern that OEPC's contract had not yet been terminated.\n\n182.\n\nIn February 2005, Minister L\u00f3pez and PetroEcuador Executive President Hugo Bonilla were called before the Ecuadorian Congress and questioned with respect to their perceived procrastination over the termination of OEPC's contract.\n\n183.\n\nOn 14 March 2005, Attorney General Borja wrote to PetroEcuador Executive President Bonilla. He reminded Mr. Bonilla of the causes for termination of the Participation Contract and insisted that the termination process be accelerated. In his letter, the Attorney General also requested to be informed within ten days of all steps taken in the process.\n\n184.\n\nThe Attorney General emphasized that the termination process should already have been completed and warned that \"the delay in the prosecution of the termination process constitutes a lamentable injury to the Ecuadorian State,\" and that \"[t]here will not be dignitary, authority, functionary nor public servant exempt from responsibility for acts realized in carrying out his duties or for his omissions.\" The Attorney General also delivered the same message in a letter to the President of the Republic.\n\n185.\n\nThe record discloses that, during March and April 2005, Occidental had meetings with PetroEcuador Executive President Bonilla, the President's Chief of Staff, Mr. Carlos P\u00f3lit, and the Minister of Labor, Mr. Ra\u00fal Izurieta, in an attempt to find a negotiated solution to the situation.\n\n186.\n\nIn April 2005, after days of violent street protests in Quito, the Ecuadorian Congress ousted President Gutierrez from power. Minister L\u00f3pez and Executive President Bonilla resigned. President Guti\u00e9rrez was replaced by then Vice President Alfredo Palacio.\n\n187.\n\nOn 18 June 2005, during a major strike, a number of government officials, including the new Minister of Energy and Mines, Mr. Iv\u00e1n Rodr\u00edguez, signed resolutions making certain commitments to the Ecuadorian Orellana and Sucumbios provinces. The first of these resolutions stated: \"The Minister of Energy and Mines and the President of PetroEcuador, as the competent authorities, commit to undertaking all of the necessary steps for the departure from Ecuador of the companies Occidental and EnCana AEC for having violated the juridical norms of the country.\"\n\n188.\n\nOn 1 July 2005, the Attorney General issued a press release in which he stated that he would insist again that the Minister of Energy and Mines conclude the termination process and issue the \"corresponding response\". He also affirmed in the press release that the transfer to AEC on 1 November 2000 had been done \"without authorization from the Ministry of Energy and Mines, as provided by Article 79 of the Hydrocarbons Law and the same Participation Contract.\"\n\n189.\n\nIn addition, a report from a committee of PetroEcuador concluded that OEPC had not discharged its burden of proof with respect to its denial of the Attorney General's allegations and recommended that the process of *caducidad* be initiated immediately. The committee referred specifically to Articles 74, 75, 76 and 79 of the HCL as well as Clause 21.2.2 of the Participation Contract.\n\n190.\n\nOn 2 August 2005, the new Executive President of PetroEcuador, Mr. Carlos Pareja, responded to the Attorney General's request and issued his recommendation to the Minister to declare termination of the Participation Contract. The Tribunal notes that Mr. Pareja resigned the day after issuing his recommendation to the Minister.\n\n**K. The** ***Caducidad*** **Decree**\n-------------------------------------\n\n191.\n\nIn early November 2005, as the record discloses, Minister Rodr\u00edguez was facing several petitions for censure in Congress because of his failure to act on PetroEcuador's recommendation. On 10 November 2005, 27 members of Congress wrote to the President of the Congress calling for the impeachment of Minister Rodr\u00edguez if he failed to conclude the termination process.\n\n192.\n\nMinister Rodr\u00edguez was notified of this letter on 14 November 2005. The next day, November 15, the Minister officially notified OEPC of PetroEcuador's findings that there were causes for termination of the Participation Contract. He gave OEPC 60 business days either to cure the alleged violations or to disprove them.\n\n193.\n\nOn 7 February 2006, OEPC responded to the Minister's notification in a 45-page letter to which were attached numerous documents. OEPC contended that there was no basis at all for termination of the Participation Contract. With this letter, OEPC submitted several requests to the Government of Ecuador for the production of certain documents.\n\n194.\n\nOn 16 February 2006, PetroEcuador's Executive President Rom\u00e1n resigned. Mr. Fernando Gonz\u00e1lez was appointed as his successor, the sixth Executive President of PetroEcuador since May 2004.\n\n195.\n\nOn 10 March 2006, Minister Rodr\u00edguez commissioned two experts to examine and report on the documentary evidence submitted by the Attorney General, PetroEcuador, and OEPC. Minister Rodr\u00edguez also received a report on the legal effects of the Farmout from Andrew Derman who subsequently became the Claimants' oil and gas expert in the present proceeding. Mr. Derman concluded that the transfer of an economic interest was not an assignment under the laws of New York, the governing law of the Farmout.\n\n196.\n\nOn 15 March 2006, President Palacio's press secretary stated that the administration feared a *coup d'\u00c9tat* as a result of strikes and demonstrations which had closed the highways in the north and center of the country. On 22 March 2006, the strike's leader issued a statement, promising that: \"If caducity of the Occidental contract is declared, we will lift the strike.\"\n\n197.\n\nIn late April 2006, Minister Rodriguez sent the Attorney General a letter asking him to confirm whether or not the law permitted a settlement with OEPC. On 2 May 2006, following a second request from the Minister, the Attorney General responded to the Minister's letter that the law did allow a settlement. He gave the same information to PetroEcuador. The Attorney General's opinion sparked a public outcry in the country.\n\n198.\n\nOn 9 May 2006, the then candidate for President, Dr. Rafael Correa, led a demonstration outside OEPC's offices in which he and other demonstrators called for a symbolic \"closure forever\" of OEPC. The same day, various social organizations in Ecuador declared that they would demand the impeachment of both President Palacio for considering a settlement agreement with OEPC, and Attorney General Borja for opining that such an agreement was legally possible.\n\n199.\n\nOn 15 May 2006, Minister Rodr\u00edguez issued the *Caducidad* Decree. The Decree terminated, with immediate effect, OEPC's Participation Contract and ordered OEPC to turn over to PetroEcuador all its assets relating to Block 15. The thirty-three page Decree included: (i) a summary of the termination process; (ii) block quotes from the letters of the Attorney General, PetroEcuador and OEPC; (iii) additional description of these letters and the positions articulated therein, as well as descriptions of other documents in the record; (iv) a description of norms considered; and (v) approximately four pages of reasoning. The Decree cited as a legal basis for *caducidad* Articles 74.11, 74.12 and 74.13 of the HCL.\n\n200.\n\nOn 16 May 2006, State officials arrived at OEPC's offices in Quito and seized all of its property, including computers, files and other equipment, which were now said to be the property of the State. The next day, 17 May, other State officials, accompanied by the National Police, seized OEPC's oil fields in Block 15, including wells, drills, storage facilities and other oil exploration and production assets.\n\n**III. THE CLAIMANTS' CLAIMS**\n------------------------------\n\n**A. The Claimants' Position**\n------------------------------\n\n***1. Overview of the Claimants' Position***\n--------------------------------------------\n\n201.\n\nThe Claimants' principal contention in this arbitration is that the termination of the Participation Contract was made without legitimate cause, *i.e.* in the absence of legal grounds for termination under both the Participation Contract itself (otherwise referred to by the Claimants as a \"Termination Event\") and Ecuadorian law (namely the Hydrocarbons Law). The *Caducidad* Decree was not, according to the Claimants, a \"good-faith response to a breach of Ecuador's contractual interests.\" Pointing to the Respondent's alleged \"after-the-fact shifts in position\", the Claimants assert that \"[t]he evidence demonstrates that the Termination Decree was the product of a desire to find an excuse for the predetermined conclusion to expel OEPC from Ecuador, which was inspired by a desire for revenge for OEPC's success in the prior BIT arbitration of the VAT dispute and by the demands of political rivals and organized pressure groups.\"\n\n202.\n\nThe Claimants contend that, due to its political significance, the *caducidad* administrative proceedings were tainted from start to finish by a complete lack of due process. In particular, the Claimants submit that the *caducidad* proceedings failed to yield a result based on evidence or law, that the Ecuadorian authorities prejudged OEPC's alleged wrongdoing before the *caducidad* proceedings even began and that OEPC was not given any meaningful opportunity to develop testimony during the proceedings at issue.\n\n203.\n\nFurthermore, the Claimants argue that it matters little whether an actual \"Termination Event\" in fact occurred in the circumstances because \"both international and Ecuadorian law proscribe the unilateral termination of a government contract where, as here, the alleged breach was always known and never objected to by the State, and such termination was manifestly unfair, arbitrary, discriminatory and disproportionate.\"\n\n204.\n\nThe Claimants accordingly present their case on liability on the basis of the two following main arguments.\n\n205.\n\nFirst, the Claimants maintain that by terminating the Participation Contract without cause (*i.e.* in the absence of a Termination Event), the Respondent has breached its obligations under both the Participation Contract and the Treaty. In advancing this argument, the Claimants essentially allege that (i) the Farmout Agreement did not operate an assignment of contractual rights and obligations in violation of Article 74.11 of the HCL, and (ii) the Farmout Agreement and the Joint Operating Agreement did not create a consortium in violation of Article 74.12 of the HCL.\n\n206.\n\nSecond, assuming a Termination Event is found to have occurred, the Claimants contend that the *Caducidad* Decree would still be in breach of the Respondent's obligations under the Treaty and Ecuadorian law because it was unfair, arbitrary, discriminatory and disproportionate.7\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the proportionality or otherwise of the *Caducidad* decree pervaded the submissions of both parties (see paragraph 425 below). This was understandable since the Ecuadorian Constitution firmly establishes as a matter of Ecuadorian law the principle of proportionality: see the discussion at paragraphs 390 and 396 - 401 below. Moreover, as discussed in paragraphs 402- 409 below numerous investment treaty tribunals have found that the principle of proportionality is part and parcel of the overarching duty to accord fair and equitable treatment to investors.\n\n207.\n\nEach of the Claimants' two main arguments on liability will now be developed in more detail.\n\n***2. The Claimants' First Main Argument: Breach Due to Absence of*** ***Termination Event***\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n208.\n\nAs noted above, the Claimants argue that by terminating the Participation Contract without legitimate cause, the Respondent breached its obligations under the Treaty and international law. According to the Claimants, \"[t]he Treaty proscribes (i) *any failure to comply* by the State with any contractual obligation into which it has entered with regard to an investment; and (ii) the *unjustified repudiation* by the State of any contract into which it has entered with an investor.\" (Emphasis in original)\n\n209.\n\nOn this basis, the Claimants contend that the Respondent breached its duties under Article II.3(c) of the Treaty which requires Ecuador \"to observe any obligation it may have entered into with regard to investments\", as well as its duties under Article II.3(a) prohibiting unfair treatment, Article II.3(b) prohibiting arbitrary impairment, and Article III prohibiting expropriation.\n\n210.\n\nIn making their first main argument, the Claimants submit that the Respondent has failed to demonstrate the occurrence of \"Termination Events\" under the HCL:\n\nEcuador claims that it was entitled under Article 74 of the HCL to terminate for cause. However, the Termination Decree provides remarkably little by way of explanation or argument and nothing by way of proof for that claim. Neither did the papers of the Attorney General and Petroecuador from which the Minister copied and pasted in his Termination Decree. This manifest lack of proof and reasoning reflected Ecuador's lack of evidence and arguments. As Claimants will show below, none of the alleged Termination Events has in fact occurred. For that failure alone, the Termination Decree was wrongful as a matter of both Ecuadorian and international law.\n\n211.\n\nRecalling that the *Caducidad* Decree and the proceedings that preceded it were based principally on the Respondent's view that the transfer of an economic interest to AEC pursuant to the Farmout Agreements purportedly constituted an assignment of rights and obligations in violation of Article 74.11 of the HCL, and that OEPC purportedly committed various technical violations of Ecuadorian hydrocarbons legislation contrary to Article 74.13 of the HCL, the Claimants deny that the Participation Contract can be properly terminated on such grounds.\n\n212.\n\nThe Claimants also deny what they refer to as the Respondent's \"new grounds\" for termination, namely that the Farmout arrangement allegedly created a \"consortium\" in violation of Article 74.12 of the HCL and that, in parallel, diplomatic pressures were made against the Respondent in violation of Clause 22.2.1 of the Participation Contract.\n\n***(a) Alleged Violations of Articles 74.11 and 74.12 of the HCL***\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n213.\n\nThe Tribunal observes from the outset that although the Claimants' wrongful termination submissions (as well as those of the Respondent) regarding Articles 74.11 and 74.12 of the HCL significantly overlap, they predominantly address the former (unauthorized transfer or assignment) rather than the latter (unauthorized consortium). Thus, by reference to the two-stage transaction envisaged by the Farmout, the Claimants reject the Respondent's allegation that the Farmout violated the HCL because it was tantamount to a wrongful assignment or transfer:\n\nIn *the first stage,* OEPC transferred a 40% economic interest in Block 15 to AEC, in exchange for certain capital contributions by AEC. AEC's economic interest consisted essentially of 40% of OEPC's share in the crude produced from Block 15. AEC's capital contribution required payments from AEC to OEPC over the course of four years and was known in the industry as the \"earning obligation.\"\n\nArticle 2.01 of the Farmout, which described this phase, specifically stated that the Farmout of the economic interest:\n\n*does not include nominal legal title* to an interest in Block 15 or an interest as a party to the Participating Agreements. *OEPC shall continue to own 100% of the legal title* to the Participating Agreements and to the interest in Block 15 granted or provided for in the Participating Agreements. CE-9 (OC00347). (Emphasis added)\n\nThus, the operative provision of the Farmout directly contradicts Ecuador's claim that an assignment or transfer occurred.\n\nThe *second stage,* which never came to pass, contemplated a future assignment by OEPC of legal title to the 40% economic interest. As described in Article 4.01, that assignment was subject to: (i) AEC's meeting its earning obligation; and (ii) OEPC's obtaining prior government approval:\n\n*[A]fter AEC has made all payments...* OEPC and AEC shall execute and deliver such documents as are required to convey *legal title* to AEC in and to a 40% economic interest in the Participating Agreements and Block 15 and to make AEC a party to the Participating Agreements as owner of such 40% economic interest ***(subject to obtaining required governmental approvals)***. CE-9 (OC00353). (Emphasis added)\n\nWhen AEC met its earning obligation in July 2004, OEPC proceeded to request government approval for the transfer of legal title to AEC. It sent a letter to this effect to the then-Minister of Energy and Mines, Eduardo L\u00f3pez Robayo on July 15, 2004. The government never responded to the request, and OEPC therefore did not proceed with the transfer. (Emphasis in original)\n\n214.\n\nThe Claimants further emphasize that the Farmout Agreement is governed by the laws of New York, under which the transfer of an economic interest, they argue, does not effectuate an assignment:\n\nUnder New York law, as presented in the opinion submitted by Andrew Derman, the expert appointed by the Minister of Energy and Mines, an assignment does not exist unless \"the assignor's right to performance by the obligor is extinguished in whole or in part and the assignee acquires a right to such performance.\" CA-236, *Restatement Second* \u00b6317; CA-235, *American Jurisprudence* \u00b61; CA-237, *Williston* \u00b674:1. Put otherwise, an assignment requires that \"an assignee step[] into the assignor's shoes and acquire[] whatever rights the latter had.\" CA-234, *Furlong* \u00b6 382. Under New York law, a mere promise to assign rights and obligations in the future subject to conditions precedent is not an assignment. CA-236, *Restatement Second* \u00b6330; CE-127. (OC02737; OC02741)\n\nIt is plain that as a matter of New York law, the transfer of a 40% economic interest did not effectuate an assignment. The mere transfer of an economic interest did not in any way create privity under the Participation Contract between Ecuador and Petroecuador, on the one hand, and AEC, on the other. That transfer of economic interest did not create any rights of AEC against Ecuador or Petroecuador; nor did it create any obligations for AEC to them.\n\n215.\n\nRegarding Ecuadorian law on assignment, the Claimants add:\n\nThus, under Ecuadorian law, for the transfer of economic interest under the Farmout to constitute an assignment, it should have resulted in AEC exercising rights and assuming obligations under the Participation Contract vis-\u00e0-vis Ecuador and Petroecuador, and OEPC ceasing to exercise such rights and to perform such obligations. HPL ER \u00b649. Additionally, under Ecuadorian law, the assignment of a contract or personal rights occurs only when the assignor turns over to the assignee a deed that describes the rights being assigned. HPL ER V \u00b6\u00b618-27. In other words, there is no assignment without the physical transfer from assignor to assignee of such deed. HPL ER V \u00b621. As explained below, neither of these conditions for an assignment has been met.\n\n216.\n\nBased on the above, the Claimants aver that until legal title was transferred, only OEPC remained liable *vis-\u00e0-vis* the Respondent and PetroEcuador for the performance of the Participation Contract and, furthermore, that only OEPC could enforce its rights under the Participation Contract. In other words, according to the Claimants, an assignment or transfer of contractual rights required privity between AEC and the Respondent and the transfer of a 40% economic interest did not create such privity. Along the same lines, the Claimants also argue that a mere promise to assign rights and obligations in the future subject to conditions precedent is not an assignment, and that a contractual agreement to reimburse for taxes or other costs does not create an assignment either.\n\n217.\n\nRegarding the Respondent's allegation that OEPC deliberately concealed the Farmout Agreement, the Claimants answer that OEPC had neither the motive nor the opportunity to do so. They further submit that OEPC fully knew that authorization by the Respondent of the agreements at issue would ultimately be necessary:\n\nIn the Counter-Memorial on Liability, Ecuador surmises without support that \"OEPC presumably hoped that the true nature of the [Farmout Agreement and the Operating Agreement] would never be known to Ecuador....\" In fact, the evidence proves that at all times prior to the eventual transfer of legal title, OEPC recognized that authorization by Ecuador and full disclosure of all agreements would occur. The agreement itself required full disclosure and governmental consent. OEPC not only disclosed its relationship with AEC to Ecuador in a series of meetings in 2000, but it would have provided copies of the underlying agreements in 2000 if the Minister of Energy and Mines had advised that approval was necessary at that stage - or if the Minister had simply requested them.\n\n218.\n\nThis brings the Claimants to the underlying premise of their case, *i.e.* that the Claimants did not ask for approval in 2000 because all OEPC was transferring at the time was an economic interest, not a legal one. Arguing that it would have been \"irrational\" for OEPC and AEC to conceal the nature of the Farmout, the Claimants contend that the Respondent's \"concealment theory\" requires, at a minimum, the following findings on the part of the Tribunal:\n\n\u2022 The agreements constituted a transfer of rights and obligations under the Participation Contract.\n\n\u2022 OEPC and AEC believed that the nature of the Farmout Agreement and the Joint Operating Agreement constituted such a transfer that required immediate government approval.\n\n\u2022 Nevertheless, in order to obtain certain short-term benefits, OEPC and AEC chose to risk their substantial investments and their longterm profits in Block 15 by concealing the \"true nature\" of the Farmout Agreement and the Joint Operating Agreement.\n\n219.\n\nThe Claimants maintain that \"Minister Ter\u00e1n, the Director of the DNH, and other Ecuadorian government officials confirmed OEPC's and AEC's belief that no government approval was necessary for the first stage of the transaction, the transfer of a 40% economic interest.\" They further submit that OEPC had no reason to doubt that it would have received approval for either stage of its transaction with AEC, based *inter alia* on its \"excellent relations with Ecuador in the fall of 2000.\" The Claimants also emphasize that OEPC never had any financial incentive to hide its relationship with AEC.\n\n220.\n\nIn addition, the Claimants argue that the Respondent's \"concealment theory\" flies in the face of the parties' dealings at the relevant time, *i.e*. in late 2000. They contend that the Respondent was informed of the Farmout at all relevant levels of government and refer, in particular, to the 24 October 2000 meeting with Minister Ter\u00e1n, the November 2000 meetings with PetroEcuador, the 14 December 2000 meeting with the Director of the DNH and the further communications with Minister Ter\u00e1n in January 2001.\n\n221.\n\nRegarding Minister Ter\u00e1n's testimony in particular, the Claimants state:\n\nMinister Ter\u00e1n complains that OEPC and AEC never informed him of the details of the Operating Agreement, but concedes that OEPC did inform him that a transfer of legal title was subject to a future negotiation. Ecuador apparently hopes that the Tribunal will read these two statements by Minister Ter\u00e1n together to imply that no discussion of either AEC's proposed involvement in Block 15 or of the agreement between AEC and OEPC ever occurred, although Minister Ter\u00e1n does not actually say as much. Contrary to what Ecuador seeks to imply, OEPC and AEC informed Minister Ter\u00e1n that AEC would be offering its expertise to OEPC, and that OEPC and AEC were in the midst of closing the deal to transfer an economic interest in Block 15. It is not plausible that OEPC and AEC would schedule a meeting with Minister Ter\u00e1n in 2000 only to limit the conversation, for all intents and purposes, to a hypothetical transfer of legal title tentatively planned for 2004. In fact, OEPC informed Minister Ter\u00e1n of the immediate transfer of economic interest and everything that the transfer entailed.\n\n222.\n\nThe Claimants further add:\n\nEcuador concedes that OEPC communicated on several different occasions that AEC had acquired an economic interest in Block 15. Ecuador seeks to diminish these presentations by arguing that OEPC's description of the Farmout Agreement as a transfer of economic interest was insufficient. However, as Claimants have shown, that description was entirely accurate for the earn-in period of the transaction. In light of considerable effort spent by OEPC to inform Ecuador of the transfer of economic interest and its public disclosure of the transaction, it is implausible to suppose that OEPC's efforts were part of a campaign actually to withhold information. OEPC had no reason to conceal any aspect of its relationship with AEC, but instead chose to communicate repeatedly that AEC was acquiring an economic interest in Block 15.\n\n223.\n\nAs for the Respondent's allegation that it inadvertently discovered the true nature of the Farmout Agreements as a result of the 2003/2004 Moores Rowland audit, the Claimants refute this suggestion in the following words:\n\nDNH was continuously involved in exchanges or discussions about the Farmout and Operating Agreements, between February and early May 2004. Not once during that period - or thereafter until the VAT Award was issued - did the DNH suggest that it learned anything from Moores Rowland about the Farmout that it did not already know. Not once did the DNH suggest that OEPC would face *caducidad* because of the Farmout. On the contrary, on May 10, 2004, having discussed the matter with Moores Rowland and OEPC, the DNH specifically subscribed to the conclusion that it would be \"prudent\" for OEPC to \"define and expedite the process of assignment of obligations and rights to AEC,\" so that the Ministry of Energy and Mines could authorize the transfer of legal title and \"thereby avoid any observation by the regulatory authorities.\" Thus, it is not at all surprising that, as noted above, Ecuador never alleged concealment through the *caducidad* proceedings or in the Termination Decree.\n\n224.\n\nIn addition to rebutting the Respondent's \"concealment theory,\" the Claimants also reject the Respondent's claim that the *Caducidad* Decree was a *bona fide* implementation of a legitimate regulatory policy. In this regard, the Claimants submit that the policy concerns raised by the Respondent are in fact reflected in Clause 16.2 of the Participation Contract, which states:\n\nThe prohibition to transfer or assign rights [...] is not an obstacle to freely trade Contractor's stock, without need of said authorization, provided that the trading of said stock does not change, modify or extinguish the legal existence of the Contractor, nor constitute a decrease in its administrative, financial and technical capacities.\n\n225.\n\nThe Claimants submit that, pursuant to that provision, \"OPC could have sold its entire 100% share of OEPC to AEC. As long as OEPC maintained \u2018its administrative, financial and technical capacities,' the transaction would not have violated the HCL's underlying policy or warranted any sanction.\"\n\n226.\n\nThe Claimants maintain that the Agreements with AEC did not reduce OEPC's ability to execute the Participation Contract and that even if AEC had operated Block 15 (which they deny), the Respondent does not dispute that it had already fully vetted and was prepared to approve AEC as an operator of Block 15. They also argue that Minister Ter\u00e1n admitted that a financial relationship between OEPC and AEC was beneficial to the Respondent. The Claimants accordingly conclude that the Farmout caused no harm to the Respondent but provided, rather, significant benefit.\n\n227.\n\nIn terms of AEC's rights under the Farmout Agreement and Joint Operating Agreement, the Claimants deny the allegation of \"operational control\" put forward by the Respondent as follows:\n\nEcuador's case that an assignment occurred within the meaning of Article 74.11 rests on the assertion that \"it is enough if the contractor agrees to share [participation contract] rights with a third party, or otherwise gives the third party the ability to influence the contractor's performance of the contract.\" Its case that a consortium was formed within the meaning of Article 74.12 similarly rests on the assertion that OEPC and AEC \"enter[ed] into a binding agreement in which they commit[ted] themselves to work together for exploration or production operations.\"\n\nBoth assertions are factually wrong. Under the terms of the Operating Agreement, AEC *could not* direct either the day to day management or long term development strategy of Block 15; and AEC *never did* direct either the day to day management or long term development strategy of Block 15. (Emphasis in original)\n\n228.\n\nSpecifically, the Claimants refute the Respondent's argument that the funding and voting provisions of the Joint Operating Agreement conferred upon AEC any control over Block 15 operations. These provisions, according to the Claimants, only allowed AEC to make financial decisions, not operational ones. The Claimants submit:\n\nIt was envisaged under the Operating Agreement that OEPC and AEC would jointly *fund* operations in Block 15 as \"joint operations,\" and its voting procedures gave both parties a vote on whether any particular proposed joint operation should receive such funding. Clause 5.13. Ecuador cites these voting procedures to claim that \"all significant operational decisions. required AEC's approval.\" That is simply not true. The only right that AEC had under these voting provisions was the right to refuse to *fund* a certain operation by not approving certain items of a work plan and budget - not a right to preclude OEPC from *carrying out* the operation altogether.\n\n[\u2026]\n\nEven with full access to the voluminous files OEPC left in Ecuador, the only evidence Ecuador can produce to support this claim are a few documents showing nothing more than AEC's frustration at its lack of involvement in Block 15 operations and a few letters recommending or \"approving\" specific operational issues. As explained above, AEC's \"approval\" only affected the financing of operations, not the operations themselves. Ecuador has failed to offer any evidence demonstrating that AEC possessed any control over the operations at Block 15. Indeed, the frustration shown in the few letters cited by Ecuador proves the absence of control by AEC rather than any ability in fact to control these operations.\n\n[\u2026]\n\nOEPC alone established the key strategic Development Plans and the Work Plans and Budget, and OEPC alone retained final decision-making authority over day to day operations. AEC provided views and advice on specific operations based on its independent assessment and its experience operating other blocks. AEC never withdrew funding and knew it could not sole-risk OEPC. As evidenced by AEC's complaints about its lack of involvement in Block 15 operations, OEPC never hesitated to exercise its final decision-making authority. AEC was a watchful investor, but it never exercised rights or assumed obligations under the Participation Contract, nor did it cause OEPC to depart from its operational plans and objectives. (Emphasis in original)\n\n229.\n\nIn the words of the Claimants, \"OEPC was always prepared to listen to AEC's opinions but was ultimately sovereign when making operational decisions.\" It is the Claimants' position that AEC neither acquired in theory nor exercised in practice any rights under the Farmout Agreement or the Joint Operating Agreement to direct either the day-to-day management or long-term development strategy of Block 15. In this regard, they add that \"taking free advice from time to time does not equate with granting operational control rights.\"\n\n230.\n\nFinally, the Claimants deny that AEC and OEPC in any way agreed to form a consortium or association. This charge, according to the Claimants, is in fact a \"new\" ground invoked by the Respondent to justify the *Caducidad* Decree. The Claimants refute this allegation in the following words:\n\n[N]o Article 74.12 Termination Event has occurred because *(i)* a consortium must have separate legal personality and AEC and OEPC did not create any entity with separate legal personality; and *(ii)* even if no separate legal personality were required, members of a consortium must undertake joint and several liability; OEPC remained at all times the only party to the Participation Contract with Petroecuador and Ecuador, and because AEC never assumed any liability under the Participation Contract, OEPC never undertook joint and several liability with AEC vis-\u00e0-vis Petroecuador and Ecuador. In any event, general principles of Ecuadorian and international law preclude punishment on the basis of concepts as ill-defined as \"consortium\" is under Ecuadorian law.\n\n231.\n\nThe Claimants thus object to the Respondent's definition of a \"consortium,\" and conclude as follows:\n\nUnable to show that OEPC and AEC formed a consortium, Ecuador attempts to employ untenably broad definitions and argues that a consortium within the meaning of Article 74.12 is created whenever parties \"enter into a binding agreement in which they commit themselves to work together for exploration or production operations.\"\n\nAs shown above, this nebulous definition is baseless; but the Farmout and the Operating Agreement do not meet even Ecuador's untenably broad definition. As shown above, AEC neither acquired nor exercised any rights under the Farmout Agreement or the Operating Agreement to direct either the day to day management or long term development strategy of Block 15. Therefore, even under Ecuador's erroneous definition, OEPC and AEC did not form a consortium.\n\n***(b) Alleged Violations of Hydrocarbons Regulations***\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n232.\n\nRegarding the Respondent's allegations of technical infractions, the Claimants characterize them as baseless, trivial and inconsequential. They write:\n\nThe 62 alleged technical infractions referenced by the Termination Decree's [ *sic* ] occurred over a period of five years, 2001-2006, and can be grouped as follows: (i) 12 claims of drilling of individual wells either without prior authorization or without proper notification; (ii) 14 claims of production from individual wells above, or without, the authorized rates; (iii) 22 claims of reporting violations, such as late filing of final drilling reports; and (iv) 11 claims of miscellaneous violations. Due to the lack of substantiating documents in the administrative file for almost half of the 62 alleged infractions, Claimants have been unable to determine in any way the nature of three of these infractions.\n\n233.\n\nThe Claimants further refute the Respondent's charge in this regard by arguing that \"no Article 74.13 Termination Event has occurred because Ecuador has failed to *(i)* document nearly half of the technical infractions on which it purported to base the Termination Decree; and *(ii)* disprove that the documented infraction allegations were misapplications of the HCL regulation, took place in the unitized fields with PetroEcuador's knowledge and approval, and/or were of a clerical or otherwise inconsequential nature.\"\n\n234.\n\nIn addition, the Claimants aver that \"the only alleged infractions Ecuador spends any effort attempting to describe as serious and substantive are those alleging that OEPC overproduced from certain individual wells,\" *i.e.* 4 of the 62 alleged infractions. They further emphasize that OEPC, like other oil companies operating in Ecuador, paid its overproductions fines (at most $3,000 each). Finally, they expressly refer to an opinion on the part of PetroEcuador regarding Petrobras to the effect that technical infractions for which a fine has already been paid cannot give rise to *caducidad*.\n\n***(c) Alleged Diplomatic Pressures***\n--------------------------------------\n\n235.\n\nThe Claimants address the Respondent's allegation that they sought the assistance of the U.S. Government in violation of the Participation Contract by noting from the outset that this consists of another entirely \"new\" ground put forward by the Respondent and raised for the first time in this arbitration. More particularly, the Claimants submit as follows:\n\nEcuador's new theory should be dismissed because (i) under international law the Tribunal should assess the lawfulness of Ecuador's conduct solely on the basis of the reasons stated in the Termination Decree; (ii) Clause 22.2.1 is unenforceable as a matter of international law; (iii) Ecuador is estopped from invoking Clause 22.2.1 because it had knowledge of the relevant facts long before it began its *caducidad* proceedings in 2002; and (iv) Ecuador failed to prove that Occidental engaged in any proscribed conduct after the caducity proceedings began (and indeed after 2002). To the contrary, once Ecuador began those proceedings in 2004, OEPC consistently informed the U.S. Government that it did not seek diplomatic assistance.\n\n236.\n\nThe Claimants thus maintain that the Respondent was well aware of OEPC's frequent contact with the U.S. Government about the VAT dispute from 2001-2002, but that OEPC did not seek any assistance from the U.S. Government after 2002, *i.e.* in connection with the *caducidad* dispute.\n\n***3. The Claimants' Second Main Argument: Breach Notwithstanding*** ***Termination Event***\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n237.\n\nAs an alternative argument, the Claimants contend that even if a Termination Event is found to have occurred in the circumstances, the termination of the Participation Contract was unlawful under both the Treaty and Ecuadorian law on the grounds that it was grossly unfair, arbitrary, discriminatory and disproportionate. In the words of the Claimants:\n\nBoth the Treaty and Ecuadorian law guaranteed Claimants and their investments fair, non-arbitrary, and non-discriminatory treatment. In passing the Termination Decree, Ecuador blatantly disregarded these standards. Having openly premeditated the termination, Ecuador imposed manifestly disproportionate punishment on Claimants on grounds that it never substantiated in the face of OEPC's vigorous defenses and that were not found sufficient to warrant contract termination in the case of other oil companies.\n\n238.\n\nThe discretionary nature of the ministerial decision which led to the Termination Decree is central to the Claimants' second main argument. Citing Article 79 of the HCL regarding nullity of an unauthorized transfer or assignment, the Claimants contend that \"the nullity of the transfer itself, such as the Farmout Agreement if it were illegal, is mandatory; but the possibility of terminating the underlying contract, the Participation Contract, is entirely discretionary.\" On this basis, the Claimants submit that the Minister exercised his discretion in a manner inconsistent with the Treaty and Ecuadorian law for the following reasons:\n\n(i) the Termination Decree was manifestly disproportionate;\n\n(ii) the Termination Decree frustrated the Claimants' legitimate expectations;\n\n(iii) the Termination Decree was unfair and arbitrary;\n\n(iv) the Termination Decree was discriminatory;\n\n(v) the Termination Decree denied the Claimants' full protection and security;\n\n(vi) the Termination Decree expropriated the Claimants' investments without compensation; and\n\n(vii) the Respondent allowed PetroEcuador and Petroproducci\u00f3n to aid and abet the Termination Decree.\n\n239.\n\nIn connection with their submission that the termination of the Participation Contract was grossly unfair, arbitrary, discriminatory and disproportionate, the Claimants reiterate their contention that the Respondent terminated the Participation Contract for reasons of political expediency, rather than on the basis of evidence or law. The Claimants also emphasize that the Respondent has not terminated the contracts of other oil and gas operators in Ecuador (namely, Tripetrol and Petrobras), even though these operators have assigned rights and obligations subject to government approval, and others (such as Petrobell, Perenco, Tecpecuador and Canada Grande) have allegedly committed as many or more technical infractions as OEPC in relation to production.\n\n240.\n\nIn addition, the Claimants rely on the prohibition against disproportionate measures under the Treaty and do not accept the Respondent's contention that any and all Article 74 violations justify termination of the Participation Contract:\n\nAccepting Ecuador's simplistic proposition, for which it cites no authority, that imposing \"the very sanction that the law calls for in a specified context\" is *per se* proportionate would deny the very essence of the proportionality principle. A finding that prohibited conduct has occurred is *not* enough to justify the administration in imposing the harshest of sanctions in the administrative arsenal. The administration must also carefully examine the particular circumstances of the alleged prohibited conduct, including the consequences flowing from it. As the cases cited above show, the Minister had to find that the contract was no longer viable, or at least that serious damage had occurred, as well as determining that the underlying policy of the contractual norm had been violated, before it could terminate OEPC's contract. No such finding was made here, and as shown above, none could have been made. (Emphasis in original)\n\n241.\n\nReferring to the circumstances in which the *Caducidad* Decree was issued, the Claimants allege that it bore no relation to the requirements of general interest, and reiterate that the Respondent had already vetted AEC and was prepared to approve it as a participant in Block 15. In this regard, the Claimants add that neither the Farmout nor the alleged technical infractions rendered continued performance of the Participation Contract impossible or caused any damage to the Respondent.\n\n242.\n\nIn terms of their legitimate expectations, the Claimants refute the Respondent's suggestion that they were not entitled to place reliance on the government's alleged acquiescence of the Farmout. In particular, they take issue with the Respondent's interpretation of the *Temple of Preah Vihear* case on estoppel by conduct. They write:\n\n[\u2026] Contrary to Ecuador's assertion, however, this standard is nowhere found in the text of *Temple of Preah Vihear*, nor is it a settled rule of international law. On the contrary, the doctrine of estoppel in international law has traditionally included two elements: *(i)* clear, voluntary and authorized statements *or conduct* from a party and *(ii)* reliance by the other party triggering either detriment to the relying party or advantage to the party making the statement or engaging in conduct. (\"What appears to be the common denominator of the various aspects of estoppel which have been discussed, is the requirement that a State ought to maintain towards a given factual or legal situation *an attitude consistent with that which it was known to have adopted* with regard to the same circumstances on previous occasions.\") (emphasis added); (\"Estoppel operates on the assumption that one party has been induced to act in reliance on the assurances or *other conduct* of another party in such a way that it would be prejudiced were the other party later to change its position.\"). (Emphasis in original)\n\n243.\n\nFinally, the Claimants maintain that the Respondent's \"one-size-fits-all\" argument that OEPC should have exhausted local remedies was specious as a jurisdictional theory and remains so in its \"reincarnation\" as a merits theory, because the Treaty itself required the Claimants to make an irrevocable choice between pursuing remedies before the Ecuadorian courts or this Tribunal.\n\n**B. The Respondent's Position**\n--------------------------------\n\n***1. Overview of the Respondent's Position***\n----------------------------------------------\n\n244.\n\nAt the outset of its pleadings, the Respondent characterizes the Claimants' case, to the extent that it is based on an alleged \"purely innocuous arrangement that the Government had known about all along,\" as pure fiction. The Respondent summarizes its own view of the facts of the case as follows:\n\nOEPC's transaction with AEC was *not* of the innocuous nature the Claimants suggest, *did* require the approval of the Ministry of Energy and Mines (the \"Ministry\"), and was *not* properly disclosed to Ecuador. In fact, the Claimants repeatedly represented to the Government that the \"first phase\" of the transaction involved only the transfer of what it called a passive \"economic interest\" having no effect on any aspect of the Participation Contract. That was false. Far from assigning a mere \"economic interest,\" the so-called \"Farmout Agreement\" transferred to AEC a \"\u2018working interest' or \u2018participation interest'\" in Block 15. As a result, OEPC was obliged, from the outset of the relationship, \"to act with regard to the Farmout Interest of [AEC] as [AEC] shall direct from time to time *as if [AEC] were a party to the Participation Agreement owning legal title to a 40% interest in the Participation Agreements.* \" This fundamental aspect of the OEPC/AEC arrangement was never disclosed to Ecuador.\n\nOn the same day they signed the Farmout Agreement, OEPC and AEC also executed an undisclosed \"Joint Operating Agreement.\" Under that agreement, AEC was given the right to appoint a representative to the Block 15 Management Committee that \"supervised and directed\" the Block 15 operations. It also had the power to veto the most important decisions relating to Block 15's operations, such as the adoption of its development plan, work program, and budget. Moreover, AEC could, at its election, conduct \"exclusive operations\" in Block 15 without the participation or approval of OEPC. In sum, OEPC was required to obtain AEC's approval for all major operating actions, including, but not limited to:\n\n\u2022 submitting development plans;\n\n\u2022 submitting work programs or budgets;\n\n\u2022 making financial decisions;\n\n\u2022 designating oil discoveries as commercial;\n\n\u2022 amending or extending the Participation Contract; and\n\n\u2022 assigning, selling, licensing or transferring any Participation Contract rights.\n\nIt is undisputed that OEPC failed to disclose the foregoing terms to Ecuador. And in its numerous meetings with the Government in 2000 and 2001, OEPC *never* provided the Government with copies of the Farmout Agreement or the Joint Operating Agreement. To the contrary, OEPC misrepresented to the Government that it was still in negotiations with AEC over any possible future transfer of rights. In reality, the Farmout Agreement and Joint Operating Agreement had been executed on October 19, 2000 - five days *before* OEPC's first meeting with the Government on the matter.\n\nOnce these simple facts are understood, the real story emerges. As told by Pablo Ter\u00e1n, then-Minister of Energy and Mines, in his witness statement, the Government was never told of a \"farmout\" or that there had been (or would be in the immediate future) an effective transfer of meaningful rights and obligations under and in relation to the Participation Contract. Moreover, Minister Ter\u00e1n made clear to OEPC that approval *would* be necessary if and when OEPC and AEC reached an agreement on the transfer of rights and obligations concerning the Participation Contract.\n\nThus, Minister Ter\u00e1n sent a letter to OEPC dated January 17, 2001, stating that he would wait until OEPC and AEC had reached an agreement on the transfer of rights and obligations under the Participation Contract and would expect OEPC to seek prior approval at that time. He also warned that such a transfer without authorization \"would give rise to the contract's *caducidad.* \" Unbeknownst to the Government, the transfer agreements between OEPC and AEC had already been executed three months earlier. (Emphasis in original)\n\n245.\n\nThe Respondent refutes the Claimants' interpretation of the Farmout Agreement and the Joint Operating Agreement in the following words:\n\n[T]he Claimants contended that anything short of a formal conveyance of a legal interest was permissible without consent. That position is artificial, disingenuous, and unsustainable under both Ecuadorian law and common sense. The Farmout Agreement and the Joint Operating Agreement created immediately-effective rights for AEC to exert influence over the Participation Contract area. They also created a means by which premiums arising from Block 15 interests could be earned by others to the exclusion of Ecuador. Both are objectionable unless fully informed consent is given in advance.\n\n246.\n\nIn addition, the Respondent takes issue with the Claimants' alleged attempt to circumvent the language of the agreements at issue:\n\nThus, the Claimants' case has now been reduced to an argument that, although the *actual language* of the Farmout Documents provided for AEC to receive operational and managerial rights in Block 15 in 2000, OEPC and AEC had some unwritten \"understanding\" that these rights could not be exercised until the \"second phase\" of their transaction. The Claimants do not - and cannot - point to a single contemporaneous document that reflects this understanding.\n\nMore fundamentally, this argument is flatly contradicted by two undeniable facts. ***First***, the argument is contradicted by what the Farmout Documents actually *say*. Those agreements make unmistakably clear that operational rights vested *immediately*. Indeed, the precise timing of the transfer of these operational rights is clearly set forth by the Farmout Agreement itself:\n\nThe Farmout Interest is to be transferred to AECI *as of the Effective Time* includes a \"working interest\" or \"participation interest\" in the Participation Agreements and Block 15 except that it does not include nominal legal title to an interest in Block 15..\n\n[\u2026]\n\n***Second***, the Claimants' argument that the operational rights assigned to AEC were \"illusory\" is disproved by how the parties *acted.* As discussed in Paragraphs 43 to 47 of Ecuador's Counter-Memorial, AEC frequently exercised its operational rights with respect to Block 15. These rights were hardly \"illusory,\" and AEC's conduct conclusively shows that it did not believe they were. (Emphasis in original)\n\n247.\n\nIn terms of its overall position in this arbitration, the Respondent contends that OEPC acted in bad faith *vis-\u00e0-vis* Ecuadorian officials by not disclosing the true nature of its contractual relationship with AEC. In particular, the Respondent refers to the circumstances in which the Farmout Agreements were inadvertently \"discovered\" by Moores Rowland in 2003/2004, alleging that OEPC in fact then resisted disclosure of the agreements.\n\n248.\n\nMore substantively, the Respondent maintains that OEPC's conduct constituted valid grounds for termination of the Participation Contract pursuant to Articles 74.11 and 74.12 of the HCL, *i.e.* where the contractor, it is recalled, \"transfers rights or enters into a private contract for the assignment of one or more of its rights\" or \"forms consortiums or associations for the exploration or production operations, or withdraws from them,\" without authorization from the Ministry. As argued by the Respondent, \"[i]t follows necessarily that the issuance of the *Caducidad* Decree could not have been a breach of the Participation Contract, because the Participation Contract is governed by Ecuadorian law.\" The Respondent adds:\n\n[T]he issuance of the *Caducidad* Decree was explicitly contemplated in the Participation Contract. As previously noted, the Participation Contract provides at Clause 21.1.1 that the Contract shall terminate by *caducidad* if OEPC commits any of the causes specified in Article 74 of the Hydrocarbons Law. Accordingly, although the issuance of the Decree was not itself a contractual act, the Contract clearly put OEPC on notice that it would be terminated under the precise circumstances that ultimately arose, and OEPC accepted this when it signed the Contract. The *Caducidad* Decree thus could in no event be considered a breach of contract. Indeed, it is hard to imagine *any* legal regime that would consider it to be a breach of contract for a party to a contract to take an action to which its counterparty has explicitly consented, in response to that counterparty's own violations of the law and breaches of contract. (Emphasis in original)\n\n249.\n\nAs for the Respondent's defense to the Claimants' allegation that the *Caducidad* Decree was issued in violation of both the Treaty and international law (*i.e.* the Claimants' second main argument of breach notwithstanding a Termination Event), it argues that \"the relevant aspects of Ecuadorian law comported fully with international standards and were applied by the Minister in an even-handed and rational manner. Under these circumstances, Ecuador cannot be deemed to have violated any of its obligations under the Treaty or international law in connection with the Claimants' investment.\" The Respondent accordingly considers the Claimants' \"attempts to cast doubt on the thoroughness and integrity of the two-year *caducidad* investigation\" as entirely unfounded and irrelevant.\n\n250.\n\nThe Respondent's defenses to the Claimants' two main submissions will now be reviewed in more detail.\n\n***2. The Respondent's Defense to the Claimants' First Main Argument: The*** ***Caducidad Decree Complied Fully with Ecuadorian Law***\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n251.\n\nThe Respondent states that the *Caducidad* Decree complied fully with Ecuadorian law because OEPC's conduct constituted valid grounds for termination of the Participation Contract, an agreement governed by the laws of Ecuador. The Respondent describes the causes for *caducidad* under Articles 74.11 and 74.12 of the HCL as encompassing situations where \"a third party has acquired control or influence over operational activities in the relevant fields, without the Ministry having been afforded the opportunity to assess the suitability of that third party for this role, or even to monitor the identity of the entities investing in the hydrocarbon sector in Ecuador.\" The requirement for authorization in such situations (and, conversely, the prohibition against unauthorized transactions) is, according to the Respondent, based on sound policy reasons.\n\n252.\n\nAs part of its argument to the effect that the *Caducidad* Decree complied fully with Ecuadorian law, the Respondent further submits that (i) the sanction of *caducidad* was *per se* appropriate and proportionate in this case; (ii) the Ministry was not precluded from declaring *caducidad* by the doctrines of *actos propios, confianza leg\u00edtima, buena fe,* or any other doctrine recognized by Ecuadorian law; (iii) the Respondent observed OEPC's due process rights during the *caducidad* investigation, and afforded OEPC a full opportunity for challenging the Decree; and (iv) the requirement that OEPC turn over all of its equipment and installations upon declaration of *caducidad* was agreed to by OEPC, and was in no way unconstitutional.\n\n***(a) Alleged Violations of Articles 74.11 and 74.12 of the HCL***\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n253.\n\nThe Respondent argues first that OEPC concealed the fact that it had concluded a Farmout with AEC without prior authorization by the Minister. In the words of the Respondent:\n\nIt is undisputed that OEPC entered into the Farmout Agreement and Joint Operating Agreement without prior authorization, and that no subsequent authorization was ever granted. While the Claimants have alleged that OEPC was led to believe that no authorization was *required* for their agreements with AEC, they do not contend that OEPC *obtained* authorization. The only question, therefore, is whether those agreements gave rise to a consortium or association for the exploration or production operations, or whether they constituted a transfer of rights or private agreement for the assignment of one or more rights under the Participation Contract. (Emphasis in original)\n\n254.\n\nFrom the Respondent's perspective, the parties' dispute is quite straightforward. The Respondent maintains that certain core facts are agreed by the parties, including the following which it deems \"fatal\" to the Claimants' case, *i.e.* that (i) OEPC consistently told the Government that it planned to transfer only an \"economic interest\" to AEC; (ii) OEPC never informed the Government that AEC had been given operational and managerial rights relating to Block 15; (iii) OEPC never provided copies of the Farmout documents to the Government; and (iv) OEPC never described the transaction as a \"farmout\" in any communication with the Government.\n\n255.\n\nThe Respondent is of the view that the Claimants are guilty of \"a lengthy pattern of deception\" and that they \"deserved to lose their contract\". The Claimants are also accused of seeking to \"distract from the evidence of their deceit by calling into question the fairness of the *caducidad* process itself.\"\n\n256.\n\nRegarding the Claimants' contention that the Respondent allegedly gave OEPC the impression that authorization was not required in the circumstances, the Respondent argues:\n\nThe Claimants contend that OEPC was justified in going forward with its agreements with AEC without Ministry authorization, because Ecuadorian officials led them to believe that authorization was not necessary. This contention fails for two simple reasons. ***First***, the officials in question could not possibly have offered a meaningful appraisal as to whether or not authorization was required without knowing the true nature of OEPC's agreements with AEC, and OEPC knew this. ***Second***, those officials repeatedly emphasized to OEPC that it would need to seek authorization from the Ministry before making any transfer of rights. (Emphasis in original)\n\n257.\n\nAs previously noted, the Respondent further argues that the Farmout resulted in more than the transfer of a mere \"economic interest\" and that the use of this term \"was clearly calculated to mislead.\" The reality, according to the Respondent, is that \"[f]ar from being a mere transfer of a passive \u2018economic interest,' the Farmout Agreement and its attendant Joint Operating Agreement immediately made AEC a full partner in the Block 15 operations and transferred to it significant managerial rights and responsibilities.\"\n\n258.\n\nReferring *inter alia* to Article 5.9 of the Joint Operating Agreement entitled \"Voting Procedure,\" the Respondent emphasizes that \"all significant operational decisions regarding Block 15 required AEC's approval\" The Respondent quotes this provision:\n\n**5.9 Voting Procedure**\n\n[...]\n\n5.92 The following acts shall require affirmative vote of one (1) or more Parties then having collectively at least sixty-six and two-thirds percent (66-2/3%) of the Participating Interests [which would necessarily include AEC]:\n\n5.9.2.1 Approval of a Development Plan;\n\n5.9.2.2 Approval of a Work Program and Budget or any amendment or modification thereof;\n\n5.9.2.3 Overexpenditures on any line item of an approved Work Program and Budget by more than twenty percent (20%) or U.S. $1,000,000, whichever is less, of the authorized amount for such line item, or overexpenditures for a Calendar Year of a total Work Program and Budget by more than ten percent (10%) or U.S. $5,000,000, whichever is less; and\n\n5.9.2.4 Decisions on financing Joint Operations (including any decisions to repay indebtedness on any such financing) prior to the Transfer Date.\n\n[\u2026]\n\n259.\n\nThe Respondent adds:\n\n[F]rom the outset OEPC was \"obligated, at the sole risk, cost and expense of [AEC], to act with respect to the Farmout Interest of AECI ***as AECI shall direct from time to time as if AECI were a party to the Participating Agreements*** ***owning legal title*** to a 40% interest in the Participating Agreements and the interests therein granting in Block 15.\"\n\nThe Farmout Agreement added, moreover, that AEC would be entitled to all \"rights and benefits... in the same manner and to the same extent as if AECI held legal title to a 40% economic interest as a participant in the Farmout Property as a Non-Operator under the Joint Operating Agreement, both prior to and after legal title to the participating interest. is conveyed from OEPC to AECI.\" In substance, therefore, AEC was to be treated *exactly* as if it were an actual party to the Participation Contract as between AEC and OEPC from the moment the Farmout Agreement closed. Indeed, the fact that the Farmout Agreement granted AEC *identical* interests and powers before and after OEPC made the contemplated transfer of \"legal title\" to AEC shows that the transfer of formal \"legal title\" was inconsequential to AEC's control over the interests in question. (Emphasis in original)\n\n260.\n\nEmphasizing that the Joint Operating Agreement, at Article 7.2.1, provides that AEC may, on its own initiative, conduct \"exclusive operations\" in Block 15 (defined as operations chargeable to the account of less than all parties to the Agreement), the Respondent interprets the rights of AEC thereunder as follows:\n\nThese were not just paper rights. As shown by correspondence and meeting minutes between AEC and OEPC produced by the Claimants in this arbitration, AEC in fact frequently exercised its managerial and operational rights with respect to Block 15 and regarded the arrangement as a \"joint venture\" between the two companies. AEC was given, and exercised, voting rights with respect to well locations, contributed to planning and budgeting decisions, and participated in Block 15 operations in respect of which it demonstrated its willingness to exercise its rights on important development decisions.\n\n[\u2026]\n\nAs previously noted, one of the grounds for the Government's declaration of *caducidad* was that OEPC and AEC entered into an unauthorized consortium, in violation of the Hydrocarbons Law. And this is precisely what OEPC and AEC formed. Indeed, in their ordinary business communications, these companies *themselves* referred to their arrangement as a \"consortium.\" In April 2004, for example, representatives from AEC and OEPC discussed the possibility of asking the Ministry for authorization for the transfer of \"legal title\" to OEPC's rights to AEC, and AEC's representatives indicated that AEC would prefer to delay seeking Government authorization for the time being: \"For your info, my current preference is to do nothing this calendar year, and next year approach the government with the proposal to pay the transfer tax, *but continue to leave the \u2018consortium' outside the country\"* - in other words, continue to hide it from the Government.\n\nTheir use of this terminology is not surprising, as the arrangement established between OEPC and AEC was of a nature that is commonly called a consortium in the international oil and gas industry. As Mr. Martin explains, the term \"consortium\" is typically used in the industry to encompass, among other things, \"[a] group of companies operating jointly, usually in a partnership with one company as operator in a given permit, license, contract area, block, etc.\" Mr. Martin observes further that this concept \"describe[s] exactly what international O&G companies undertake to do in farmout agreements and JOAs, including the Farmout Agreement and Operating Agreement that OEPC and AEC signed and used to carry out their activities on Block 15. (Emphasis in original)\n\n261.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, an Article 74 violation does not require proof of \"control\" *per se* :\n\n[T]he Claimants' experts assert that AEC's Management Committee rights may have been insufficient to give it \"control\" of operations in Block 15. This is another red herring, because a third party need not have \"control\" over operations in order for an Article 74 violation to occur. To the contrary, as explained by Dr. Merlo, a \"transfer of rights\" occurs when the contractor conveys to the transferee the right to participate in strategic and operational decisions relating to petroleum exploration or extraction, thereby giving it influence over operations. Similarly, a \"consortium\" is formed within the meaning of Article 74.12 if a contractor and a third party \"enter into a binding agreement in which they commit themselves to work together for exploration or production operations.\" Hence, neither type of violation is contingent on the third party obtaining \"effective operational control.\"\n\n262.\n\nIn any event, it is the Respondent's position that AEC actually exercised managerial and operational rights from the outset of its relationship with OEPC. The Respondent accordingly submits that OEPC and AEC formed an unauthorized consortium for the exploration and production of oil in violation of Article 74.12 of the HCL. Furthermore, the Respondent rejects the Claimants' contention that a \"consortium\" requires the formation of a separate legal entity to carry out the joint operations. Referring to Ecuadorian case law in this regard, the Respondent contends:\n\nThus, whereas the Claimants contend that the formation of a consortium requires the creation of a distinct legal person, the decision clearly states that the mere agreement between the parties to enter into a consortium (as defined by the Court) is sufficient to create a consortium and that, as a consequence of the parties' agreement, a new legal entity exists, without the need to accomplish any special formality.\n\nIt cannot be disputed that OEPC and AEC both (*i*) \"contributed something in common\" (with AEC's contribution consisting of, *inter alia*, providing funding and expertise for the development of Block 15), and (*ii*) \"divided among them[selves] the benefits derived from the common activity,\" in the proportion of 60%-40%, less the operating costs born in the same proportion. It follows that OEPC and AEC *did* form a consortium, according to the definition given by the Court. It also follows, although this is not relevant to the present case, that this consortium had legal standing as a separate legal person. (Emphasis in original)\n\n263.\n\nIn addition, the Respondent maintains that the formation of a consortium under Ecuadorian law does not require that the third party assume joint and several liability for the performance of the Participation Contract.\n\n264.\n\nThe Respondent also contends that the Farmout constituted a transfer of rights and an agreement to assign rights to AEC in violation of Article 74.11 of the HCL. It argues that, for purposes of this provision, \"it is not necessary for the contractor to divest itself completely of the rights in question; it is enough if the contractor agrees to share those rights with a third party, or otherwise gives the third party the ability to influence the contractor's performance of the contract.\" *In fine*, the Respondent characterizes the Claimants' contention that an actual \"assignment\" has not been effected in the circumstances as a \"red herring\".\n\n265.\n\nTurning to the Claimants' contention that OEPC in fact revealed the farmout transaction with AEC to Ecuadorian officials, the Respondent denies that any such disclosure was made and refers in particular to the meeting among OEPC, AEC and Minister Teran in the latter's office in Quito on 24 October 2000:\n\nAt the meeting, OEPC and AEC brought up their contemplated transaction relating to Block 15. They spoke in generalities from a prepared \"script,\" without referring to their transaction as a \"farmout,\" and without ever providing Minister Ter\u00e1n with the Farmout Agreement or the Joint Operating Agreement. Nevertheless, that script (now disclosed by the Claimants in this arbitration) *confirms* that OEPC and AEC concealed the true nature of the transaction from Minister Ter\u00e1n.\n\nThe script begins by asserting that \"Oxy and AEC have agreed that AEC will assume a 40% economic interest\" and that there will be \"no change in the operations\" and \"no initial change in the contractual rights and obligations or legal title for [Block 15].\" What Minister Ter\u00e1n did not know, of course, was that significantly more was being transferred to AEC. OEPC's script also suggests that OEPC stated that at a later date it \"would seek to transfer 40% of our legal title subject to the Government's approval,\" although, as Minister Ter\u00e1n has testified, OEPC assured Minister Ter\u00e1n that this was a matter to be left for future negotiation and would be subject to Ministry approval, if it happened at all. (Emphasis in original)\n\n266.\n\nIn this regard, the Respondent further recalls the follow-up letter of 25 October 2000 sent to Minister Ter\u00e1n by Paul MacInnes. In this letter, OEPC expressly requests \"that the Ministry of Energy and Mines confirm as soon as possible, its consent with respect to the aforementioned transfer of economic interest in favour of [AEC].\" The Respondent argues that this letter fails to disclose that OEPC had in fact already concluded a binding agreement with AEC, and alleges that OEPC continued to conceal this fact when it made a presentation to the Joint Management Committee of the Limoncocha and Ed\u00e9n-Yuturi Fields on 22 November 2000.\n\n267.\n\nFurthermore, the Respondent recalls the meeting between OEPC and the DNH on 14 December 2000. According to the Respondent, OEPC's representatives present at this meeting \"falsely represented to the Government that [OEPC] was still in negotiations with AEC over a possible future transaction\". This meeting led to the letter by Minister Ter\u00e1n to OEPC dated 17 January 2001, which the Respondent characterizes as follows:\n\nFor avoidance of doubt, Minister Ter\u00e1n made sure that OEPC knew the consequences of making a transfer without authorization. In his January 17, 2001 letter, Minister Ter\u00e1n stated in no uncertain terms:\n\nExecutive Decree No. 809, which contains the Regulation to Art. 79 of the Hydrocarbons Law, published in the Official Register No. 197, dated May 31, 1985, in its Article I stipulates that the total or partial transfer of rights and obligations derived from a contract may be assigned in favour of third parties with the prior authorization of the Corresponding Ministry, otherwise such transfer will be invalid and ***will give rise to the contract's termination***.\n\nThus, Minister Ter\u00e1n specifically warned OEPC, as early as January 2001, that a transfer of rights without approval would result in *caducidad*. Unbeknownst to the Government, however, the deed had already been done - back in October 2000. (Emphasis in original)\n\n268.\n\nThe Respondent then addresses its discovery of what it refers to as the \"true nature\" of OEPC's relationship with AEC and the investigation that led to the *caducidad* proceedings and, ultimately, the *Caducidad* Decree. This discovery is alleged to have been made in the context of the 2003/2004 Moores Rowland's audit of OEPC. The Respondent disputes the Claimants' suggestion that the *caducidad* proceedings were initiated in retaliation to the VAT arbitration. Rather, according to the Respondent, \"the proximity of those events was of the Claimants' own making.\" The Respondent particularizes its position as follows:\n\nSpecifically, it was the Claimants' decision to make their request for transfer of \"legal title\" to AEC immediately after the VAT Award was dispatched to the parties that led to the discovery of the details of the relationship between OEPC and AEC by the Minister of Energy and Mines and the Attorney General. The timing of that request - following as it did on the heels of the VAT Award -could not have been coincidental.\n\nAs the witness statement from OEPC witness Paul MacInnes reveals, AEC had completed its required payments under the Farmout Agreement by the spring of 2004. Under the terms of the Farmout Agreement, OEPC should have immediately sought authorization from the Government for the \"second stage\" of the transaction, *i.e.,* the transfer of \"legal title\" to AEC. But OEPC did not make any such request at that time. Instead, it delayed for several months, failing to make the request until July 15, 2004, immediately after the award in the VAT Arbitration was dispatched to the parties.\n\nOEPC must also have known that any request for the transfer of \"legal title\" to AEC would prompt scrutiny from the Ministry, given that the Ministry was bound to conduct an investigation whenever a request for the transfer of rights was made. OEPC must also have known that this could lead to the discovery of the offending agreements by Government officials who would be able to appreciate their significance. This may explain why OEPC did not make an immediate request for the transfer of \"legal title\" to AEC when AEC's payments were completed in Spring 2004, and, instead, delayed until the VAT Arbitration had concluded. Indeed, correspondence between OEPC and AEC in April 2004 confirms the parties' intent, for the time being anyway, to \"continue to leave the \u2018consortium' outside the country.\" OEPC would have known that if it prevailed in the VAT Arbitration, then made its request for transfer of legal title to AEC, any adverse response by the Government could be made to appear retaliatory in nature. OEPC has certainly not hesitated to characterize the Government's response in precisely that manner in this arbitration.\n\n269.\n\nThe Respondent then refutes the Claimants' denial of motive to conceal the Farmout Agreements in the following words:\n\nThe objective reality, however, is that the Claimants most certainly *did* have at least two motives to conceal the Farmout: (*i*) the desire to avoid the payment of a transfer fee and the enhancement to the economic terms of the contract, and (*ii*) the desire to avoid any potential delay or complications that could have been associated with the Ministry's evaluation of the Claimants' transfer request. Further, AEC, in the context of deciding not to seek approval for the second phase transfer, noted that it would have to \"approach the government with the proposal to pay the transfer tax,\" and OEPC said that AEC might be concerned about \"anti-trust provisions.\" (Emphasis in original)\n\n270.\n\nThe Respondent concludes that, in any event, the Claimants' motive is irrelevant in the circumstances.\n\n271.\n\nFinally, the Respondent argues that the *caducidad* proceedings at all times afforded the Claimants due process since OEPC was afforded the opportunity to respond at each stage of the process.\n\n***(b) Alleged Violations of Hydrocarbons Regulations***\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n272.\n\nAs part of a parallel line of argument in support of its position that the *Caducidad* Decree complied fully with Ecuadorian law, the Respondent contends that OEPC not only sought to conceal the Farmout Agreements, but that its behaviour \"was also a repeat violation of the laws governing oil exploitation\" thus forming \"a secondary, but entirely independent reason for *caducidad.* \" These violations, however, are not said to have been \"essential\" to the Minister's decision to declare *caducidad*.\n\n***(c) Alleged Diplomatic Pressures***\n--------------------------------------\n\n273.\n\nThe Respondent asserts that it has discovered a third \"separate\" and \"independent\" justification for termination of the Participation Contract in the circumstances based on the Claimants' repeated use of diplomatic channels to put improper pressure on Ecuadorian authorities in violation of Clause 22.2.1 of the Participation Contract. In this regard, the Respondent does not accept the Claimants' explanations:\n\nIn any event, the point that the Claimants are now attempting to make - *i.e.*, that the Claimants lobbied the U.S. Government with regard to the VAT arbitration but did not with regard to this dispute - is a distinction without a difference. *Both* are prohibited under the plain terms of the Participation Contract, and *both* give Ecuador grounds to declare *caducidad*. The Participation Contract prohibits the use of \"diplomatic or consular channels\" with regard to any \"controversies that may arise as a result of this Participation Contract.\" Article 22.2.1 of the Contract provides:\n\n\"In the event of controversies that may arise as the result of the performance of this Participation Contract, in accordance with Ecuadorian law, Contractor expressly waives its right to use diplomatic or consular channels, or to have recourse to any national or foreign jurisdictional body not provided for in this Participation Contract. Lack of compliance with this provision shall constitute grounds for the *caducidad* of this Participation Contract.\"\n\n[\u2026]\n\nMore to the point, Ecuador certainly *has* presented evidence of post-2002 lobbying pressure with its Counter-Memorial. Among the evidence already identified by Ecuador as showing post-2002 lobbying pressure is a telling e-mail exchange between the Claimants and the U.S. State Department on August 2326, 2004. An examination of this document shows that it is a communication *initiated by the Claimants*, inviting U.S. Government assistance in this very dispute. (Emphasis in original)\n\n***3. The Respondent's Defense to the Claimants' Second Main Argument: The*** ***Caducidad Decree Complied Fully with the Treaty and International Law***\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n274.\n\nBy way of a preliminary observation regarding the Respondent's defense to the allegation that the *Caducidad* Decree was issued in violation of both the Treaty and international law, the Tribunal notes that the Respondent's first written submissions on this point were filed prior to the Tribunal's Decision on Jurisdiction referred to earlier in this Award. The Respondent contends that the Claimants' Treaty claims are necessarily defective in light of the Claimants' failure to challenge the *Caducidad* Decree before the Ecuadorian courts. In the words of the Respondent:\n\nIn its Decision on Jurisdiction, the Tribunal denied Ecuador's request for a stay of the arbitration pending OEPC's pursuit of claims before Ecuadorian courts, but the denial of the request was in no way dispositive of Ecuadorian courts. The Tribunal based its decision to deny the stay on its conclusion that the Claimants were not *contractually required* to pursue their claims before Ecuadorian courts. Decision on Jurisdiction \u00b696. The reasoning of the Tribunal seems to have been that since the Claimants were not contractually required to bring their claims in Ecuador, there was not basis to direct them to pursue claims in that forum before their present claims could be addressed on the merits. That conclusion does not dispose of the present argument because Ecuador's position is that the Claimants' Treaty claims are substantively defective *even if the* *Tribunal has jurisdiction over those claims and the Claimants were not contractually required to bring their claims in Ecuador.* This is true for the simple reason that (as developed more fully below) the act of the Minister in issuing the *Caducidad* Decree cannot attach responsibility to the State as a substantive matter when there was a mechanism available for the review of that act, which the investor simply failed to invoke. (Emphasis in original)\n\n275.\n\nBecause termination of the Participation Contract by way of *caducidad* was, according to the Respondent, proper under Ecuadorian law, \"this leads to the inevitable conclusion that it was not an expropriation\". The Respondent contends that it is not open to this Tribunal to conclude otherwise in the absence of a contrary ruling by the Ecuadorian courts:\n\nWhen considering the propriety of the termination under the Participation Contract and its governing law, it is important to keep in mind that the *Caducidad* Decree carries with it a presumption of validity, which may be overcome only through a determination in an Ecuadorian administrative court. Because the Claimants have not sought such a determination, they could not possibly establish that the termination was wrongful under the Participation Contract or under Ecuadorian law generally. It bears noting in this regard that several BIT tribunals have acknowledged that an investor cannot state a valid treaty claim if the viability of the claim under international law turns on whether or not a contract governed by municipal law has been violated, and the investor has not sought a ruling on that issue from a domestic court - provided, of course, that the investor had the opportunity to pursue such a claim.\n\n276.\n\nThe Respondent adds that the Claimants' Treaty and international law claims are unsustainable even if redress had been sought before the Ecuadorian courts. The Respondent argues:\n\nThe Claimants can hardly maintain that an expropriation occurred, or that their legitimate expectations were violated, given that Ecuador issued the *Caducidad* Decree in response to OEPC's own violations of the Hydrocarbons Law, particularly where the Participation Contract itself explicitly provided for that result in such a situation. Nor can the Claimants credibly claim to have been subjected to any arbitrary or discriminatory treatment, given that the Minister's decision was grounded in Ecuadorian law and was open to review by competent Ecuadorian courts, and there were valid reasons for him to terminate the OEPC's contract, while leaving in place those of other investors. The simple truth is that the Claimants have no one but themselves to blame for the forfeiture of their investment.\n\n277.\n\nThe Respondent's submissions to the effect that it did not violate the Treaty or international law are articulated as follows:\n\n(i) the Respondent did not expropriate the Claimants' investment because the termination of a contract in accordance with its terms and governing law is not an expropriation, and the *Caducidad* Decree was a *bona fide* administrative sanction in furtherance of a legitimate regulatory policy;\n\n(ii) the Respondent did not violate the obligation to provide treatment \"no less favourable;\"\n\n(iii) the Respondent did not arbitrarily or discriminatorily impair OEPC's investment;\n\n(iv) the Respondent did not deny the Claimants fair and equitable treatment because, *inter alia,* the Claimants' \"legitimate expectations\" theories (estoppel, disproportionate sanction and absence of due process) are unwarranted and, additionally, it cannot be unfair and inequitable for the State to exercise a right explicitly granted to it in a contract with the investor, in the absence of any showing that the contract was obtained by fraud or duress, or was otherwise unenforceable;\n\n(v) the Respondent did not deny the Claimants full protection and security;\n\n(vi) the Respondent did not violate the umbrella clause; and\n\n(vii) the Respondent did not violate the Treaty based on conduct of PetroEcuador.\n\n278.\n\nThe Respondent emphasizes that it acted in good faith in relation to OEPC's investment, that the *Caducidad* Decree was consistent with OEPC's legitimate expectations because it was specifically provided for under Ecuadorian law and the Participation Contract and that the *caducidad* proceedings comported with due process and were not motivated by political considerations. Specifically, regarding the Claimants' allegation that the Respondent favored other contractors (such as Canada Grande, Petrobras and Petrocol), it argues that these instances are readily distinguishable from the present case.\n\n279.\n\nThe Respondent is also of the view that the Claimants' submissions on the proportionality of the *caducidad* sanction are without merit and that the Claimants' assertion that it should have refrained from imposing *caducidad* in the absence of specific harm or damage should be rejected.\n\n280.\n\nAdditionally, the Respondent argues that, contrary to the Claimants' suggestion, it was not estopped in the circumstances from declaring *caducidad*. The Respondent maintains:\n\nThe Claimants do not come close to meeting the *Temple of Preah Vihear* [estoppel] standard. To begin with, neither the Ministry, nor any other Ecuadorian official, ever made a \"clear statement of fact\" that authorization was not required for an agreement of the nature that was actually signed between OEPC and AEC, let alone one that was \"voluntary, unconditional, and authorized.\" Indeed, no indication from an official to the effect that authorization did not seem to be necessary could have been \"voluntary,\" because the Claimants withheld key details of OEPC's contractual arrangements with AEC in their discussions with officials, and never gave them a copy of the actual agreements. Moreover, there was no \"reliance in good faith\" by OEPC, let alone detrimental reliance. OEPC could not have relied on any statements of Ecuadorian officials in good faith because it had concealed key details from them, and was aware that they had no way of knowing the true nature of OEPC's agreements with AEC. And there was certainly no detrimental reliance by the Claimants, because - far from suffering any detriment - OEPC made profits from its investments in Ecuador that were made after the Farmout was signed.\n\n281.\n\nIn conclusion, the Respondent reiterates its position as to the Claimants' expectations in the circumstances of the present case:\n\nIn the instant case, the Claimants' expectations at the time OEPC made its investment were necessarily shaped by the terms of the Participation Contract and the Hydrocarbons Law, both of which explicitly prohibited transactions of the nature that OEPC surreptitiously entered into with AEC, and provided that *caducidad* would be the sanction for any such unauthorized agreements. The Claimants' expectations were further confirmed by the letters from the Ministry and DNH, which both stated that prior authorization would be required before any such agreement could be concluded. Despite knowing full well about that prohibition, and the sanction that would result if their violations came to light, the Claimants went ahead and entered into the Farmout Agreement and the Joint Operating Agreement with AEC, without prior authorization from the Ministry, and concealed the true nature of both agreements from Ecuadorian authorities. In this context, the Claimants cannot credibly claim that they had a legitimate expectation that *caducidad* would not be declared when their violations were discovered, and they have no equitable basis to seek relief from this Tribunal.\n\n282.\n\nThe Respondent's counterclaim and the Claimants' response thereto, are summarized next.\n\n**IV. THE RESPONDENT'S COUNTERCLAIM**\n-------------------------------------\n\n**A. The Respondent's Position**\n--------------------------------\n\n283.\n\nThe Respondent filed a counterclaim against the Claimants on the basis of four distinct grounds:\n\n(i) malicious prosecution (*abuso del derecho)* in relation to these ICSID proceedings;\n\n(ii) breach of Clause 22.2.1 of the Participation Contract regarding waiver of the right to use diplomatic or consular channels;\n\n(iii) the Claimants' allegedly destructive and unlawful conduct following the *Caducidad* Decree, including alleged damage to data and software as well as unavailability of drilling rigs; and\n\n(iv) the Claimants' alleged failure to pay the required assignment fee and negotiate a new participation contract more favourable to the Respondent in accordance with Article 79 of the HCL.\n\n284.\n\nThe Respondent's submissions regarding the first two heads of its counterclaim are based principally on allegations of bad faith and coercion on the part of the Claimants, as reflected by the following:\n\nThe Claimants have launched these proceedings knowing that their claims in relation to *caducidad* are objectively baseless and cannot succeed. They have done so to apply further severe pressure on Ecuador - both in itself and in combination with procuring the U.S. Government pressure noted herein - in order to coerce settlement and other concessions by making it extremely difficult for Ecuador to maintain its defense in this action, and also to avoid the financial consequences of creating a means by which synthetic interests in Block 15 could be traded and profits thereby earned and concealed.\n\nIn a growing number of cases, claimants who have asserted baseless claims purportedly founded in international law before ICSID or other tribunals have been ordered to pay the fees and costs of the Respondent State, in order to compensate the Respondent State for the burden and expense of defending the claims. In this case, however, recovery of fees and costs alone could by no means compensate Ecuador for all of the harm it has suffered from OEPC's wrongful conduct, which includes not only the expense associated with defending these unworthy claims, but also the loss of profits arising on the improper trading of Block 15 interests, and the substantial damage to Ecuador's reputation and economic prejudice in the market for foreign investment and world opinion.\n\n285.\n\nWith respect to the amount of the damages which it says it has suffered as a result of the Claimants' fault, the Respondent maintains that they are not readily quantifiable in economic or material terms. The Respondent accordingly argues that, under both international law and Ecuadorian law, it is entitled to moral damages to redress the consequences of the Claimants' alleged malfeasance and prevent their unjust enrichment.\n\n286.\n\nIn connection with the third ground of its counterclaim, the Respondent seeks economic damages to compensate it for losses allegedly suffered as a result of the Claimants' \"destructive actions\" regarding Block 15 following the issuance of the *Caducidad* Decree. The alleged \"destructive actions\" principally consist of the Claimants' (a) release of two drilling rigs required to maintain production levels at Block 15 and (b) deactivation of Block 15's operational software. These actions, the Respondent contends, resulted in lost production damages of over $80 million.\n\n287.\n\nThe fourth and final head of the Respondent's counterclaim, based on the allegation that the Claimants failed to pay the assignment fee and negotiate a new participation contract more favourable to the Respondent in accordance with Article 79 of the HCL, is no longer pursued by the Respondent. It has made no attempt to quantify this claim during the quantum phase of this proceeding.\n\n**B. The Claimants' Position**\n------------------------------\n\n288.\n\nThe Claimants characterize the first two heads of the Respondent's counterclaim as \"ludicrous\", and submit that they fail for the following reasons:\n\n*First*, Ecuador's counterclaim for abuse of process is legally misconceived. The doctrine of abuse of process is seldom invoked in international practice, and Ecuador is unable to cite a single international-law case in which a tribunal has actually determined that an abuse of process occurred. The consensus that emerges from the cases that deal with the issue is that, as long as the tribunal has jurisdiction and the claims have been properly submitted, no abuse of process can have occurred. Indeed, the cases question whether the doctrine of abuse of process has any application at all in international arbitral practice.\n\n[...]\n\n*Second*, even if Ecuador's expansive notion of abuse of process has any merit, it would still fail because OEPC's claims are fully justified by the facts and the law, and Ecuador's allegation of bad faith is completely baseless. (Emphasis in original)\n\n289.\n\nNoting that the Respondent's counterclaim is based in part on the premise that the Claimants have put forward their own claims in order to obtain \"leverage\", the Claimants rebut this allegation of bad faith by reasserting their submissions on liability.\n\n290.\n\nAs for the Respondent's allegations of \"destructive actions\" on the part of the Claimants, and in particular the release of two drilling rigs required to maintain production levels at Block 15, the Claimants maintain that nothing in the Participation Contract or the HCL required OEPC to maintain at the site equipment such as oil rigs that were no longer in use. The Claimants further argue that PetroEcuador could have assumed OEPC's oil rig contracts had it wished to recall the rigs itself. The Claimants otherwise contend that OEPC took all steps necessary to ensure the smooth transition of Block 15 from OEPC to PetroEcuador, and that any ensuing difficulties, including software-related issues, were the result of PetroEcuador's own failure to plan adequately for the Block 15 transition.\n\n**V. ANALYSIS**\n---------------\n\n**A. The Tribunal's Jurisdiction over the Claimants' Claims**\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n291.\n\nThe Respondent at the outset maintains that the Claimants' Treaty claims are \"substantially defective\" even if the Tribunal has jurisdiction over these claims because \"the act of the Minister in issuing the *Caducidad* Decree cannot attach responsibility to the State as a substantive matter when there was a mechanism available for the review of that act, which the investor simply failed to invoke.\" The Claimants were legally obliged, says the Respondent, to pursue a local challenge to the *Caducidad* Decree before the courts in Ecuador.\n\n292.\n\nIn brief, the Claimants answer that this is a \"recycled\" version of the jurisdictional argument advanced by the Respondent in its jurisdictional challenge which has been dismissed by the Tribunal in its Decision on Jurisdiction8 and which is now being \"reincarnated\" as a merits defense.\n\nSee Decision on Jurisdiction dated 9 September 2008\n\n293.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees with the Claimants. The matter is \"*res judicata*\".\n\n294.\n\nIn its Decision on Jurisdiction, the Tribunal, after having referred to Article VI of the Treaty and Clause 2.2.2.1 of the Participation Contract, stated very clearly that it \"does not accept that [\u2026] the parties agreed that *caducidad* -related disputes under the Participation Contract would solely be resolved by submission to the Ecuadorian administrative courts [\u2026].\"9\n\n*Ibid.* at paragraph 70.\n\n295.\n\nThe Tribunal then concluded that it \"has jurisdiction over the Claimants' claims under both the Participation contract and the Treaty\".10\n\n*Ibid*. at paragraph 89.\n\n296.\n\nThis disposes of the Respondent's preliminary objection which is dismissed.\n\n**B. The Tribunal's Findings in Connection with the Claimants' Claims**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n***1. OEPC's Breach of the Participation Contract***\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n***(a) Preliminary Observations***\n----------------------------------\n\n297.\n\nAt the heart of the Claimants' case in this arbitration lies the issue of whether the Respondent, by issuing the *Caducidad* Decree on 15 May 2006, validly terminated the Participation Contract in accordance with both the Participation Contract itself and its governing law, namely Ecuadorian law and, in particular, the Hydrocarbons Law. In addressing this issue, the Tribunal must first answer the specific question of whether OEPC, upon entering into the Farmout Agreement and the Joint Operating Agreement with AEC, (i) transferred or assigned rights under the Participation Contract contrary to Clause 16.1 of the Participation Contract and in violation of Article 74.11 of the HCL, and/or (ii) created a consortium contrary to Clause 16.4 of the Participation Contract and in violation of Article 74.12 of the HCL. In the event the Tribunal answers this question in the affirmative, it will then have to determine whether or not authorization was obtained in the circumstances - it is undisputed that in either instance, authorization on the part of the Ecuadorian authorities was indeed required. And in the event that the Tribunal finds that such authorization was not obtained, it will thereafter need to address the question of whether or not the termination of the Participation Contract and the Unitized Fields Joint Operating Agreements by the Respondent through the declaration of *caducidad* was consistent with both the Treaty and customary international law as well as Ecuadorian law, and in particular whether or not it was a proportionate sanction in the circumstances.\n\n298.\n\nAs noted earlier in this Award, whilst the Claimants' wrongful termination submissions (as well as those of the Respondent) regarding the above significantly overlap, they predominantly address the Respondent's allegations of an unauthorized transfer or assignment as opposed to the Respondent's allegations of an unauthorized consortium. The Tribunal will thus consider first the central issue of whether the Farmout Agreement and the Joint Operating Agreement operated a transfer or assignment of rights under the Participation Contract contrary to Clause 16.1 thereof and in violation of Article 74.11 of the HCL.\n\n299.\n\nCrucial to this issue of the alleged prohibition to transfer or assign rights under the Participation Contract are Clauses 16.1 and 16.2, which will be quoted again for ease of reference. They read as follows:\n\n**SIXTEEN: TRANSFER AND ASSIGNMENT.-**\n\n**16.1** Transfer of this Participation Contract or assignment to third parties of the rights under the Participation Contract, must have the authorization of the Corresponding Ministry, in accordance with existing laws and regulations, especially the provisions contained in Art. 79 of the Hydrocarbons Law and Executive Decrees No. 809, 2713 and 1179.\n\n**16.2** The prohibition to transfer or assign rights under this Participation Contract without the approval of the Corresponding Ministry, as determined in Art. 79 of the Hydrocarbons Law, is not an obstacle to freely trade Contractor's stock, without need of said authorization, provided that the trading of said stock does not change, modify or extinguish the legal existence of Contractor, nor constitute a decrease in its administrative, financial and technical capacities with reference to this Participation Contract.\n\n[\u2026]\n\n300.\n\nThe Respondent argues that it was entitled to terminate the Participation Contract in accordance with Clause 21.1.2 thereof, which expressly provided that the Participation Contract shall terminate \"[d]ue to a transfer of rights and obligations of the Participation Contract without prior authorization of the Corresponding Ministry\". The Claimants, the Tribunal recalls, deny that the Farmout Agreement and the Joint Operating Agreement operated a transfer or assignment of contractual rights and obligations under the Participation Contract. They accordingly contend that prior authorization in connection with these Agreements, when entered into in 2000, was not required.\n\n***(b) Evidence of a Transfer of Rights under the Participation Contract***\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n301.\n\nAs explained in more detail below, based on its review of the entirety of the record, the Tribunal considers that there is ample evidence to conclude that the purpose of the Farmout Agreement and the Joint Operating Agreement was to transfer from OEPC as Contractor to AEC certain of the Contractor's exclusive rights to carry out the oil exploitation activities under the Participation Contract, as set forth under Clause 4.2 of the Participation Contract, along with related rights and obligations.\n\n302.\n\nThe evidence of the intention to transfer OEPC's exclusive right to carry out the oil exploitation activities under the Participation Contract to AEC is found principally in the Joint Operating Agreement which the parties entered into as envisaged in the Farmout. Indeed, the very terms of the Joint Operating Agreement define its scope by reference to an apportionment of rights under the Participation Contract as between OEPC and AEC. Clause 3.1.1 of the Joint Operating Agreement - under the heading entitled \"Scope\" - stated that \"[t]he purpose of this Agreement is to establish the respective rights and obligations of the Parties with regard to operations under the Participation Agreements [which include the Participation Contract], including without limitation the joint exploration, appraisal, development and production of Petroleum from the Agreement Area (Emphasis added) This, in the Tribunal's view, explicitly evidences that the Joint Operating Agreement was intended to effectuate a transfer of rights and obligations held under the Participation Contract to the benefit of AEC.\n\n303.\n\nSimilarly, the terms of Clause 3.3.1 of the Joint Operating Agreement - under the heading entitled \"Ownership, Obligations and Liabilities\" - stated that \"[u]nless otherwise provided in this Agreement, all the rights and interests in and under the Participating Agreements, all Joint Property and any Petroleum and any Petroleum produced from the Agreement Area shall, subject to the terms of the Participating Agreements, be owned by the Parties in accordance with their respective Participating Interests.\" (Emphasis added) Again, this language explicitly evidences that the Joint Operating Agreement served to operate a transfer of rights and obligations held under the Participation Contract, resulting in AEC's purported \"ownership\" over these rights to the extent of its Participating Interest.\n\n304.\n\nThe Tribunal concludes that by virtue of having \"ownership\" over \"all the rights and interests in and under the Participating Agreements\", albeit to the extent of its 40% respective Participating Interest, the parties intended that AEC acquire such ownership as a result of a transfer of such rights and interests effected by the Joint Operating Agreement.\n\n305.\n\nThe Tribunal observes that the prohibition to transfer or assign rights and obligations under the Participation Contract is not expressed as being limited to total transfers or assignments. This prohibition must be interpreted as encompassing partial transfers or assignments such as the one effected by the Joint Operating Agreement. In the event of a transfer or assignment of rights and obligations under the Participation Contract, authorization was required regardless of whether (i) only a percentage of such rights and obligations was being transferred or assigned, (ii) only some and not all of such rights and obligations were being transferred or assigned, or (iii) only some aspect and not all aspects (for instance legal title) of such rights and obligations were being transferred or assigned. As set out in paragraphs 612-659 below, without this authorization, any purported transfer (including a partial transfer) was invalid under the HCL. The Tribunal's finding in this regard is also confirmed by HCL-related legislation, such as Executive Decree No. 80911, which expressly contemplates that both partial and total transfers of rights and obligations must be authorized.\n\nSee Exhibit CA-570. See also CB-23.\n\n306.\n\nAlthough the Farmout was sometimes characterized by the Claimants as \"merely\" transferring to AEC, in 2000, a 40% economic interest in Block 15, as opposed to legal title to an interest in Block 15, the Tribunal does not accept that the transaction, whatever may have been the parties' intention, did not serve to effectuate a transfer of rights and obligations requiring authorization on the part of the Ecuadorian authorities. As noted above, neither the Participation Contract nor the HCL allow a narrow reading of the concepts of transfer or assignment. They must be read as including all forms of such transfers or assignments, be they total or partial in nature. The fact that OEPC may have retained legal title in order to prevent any privity as between AEC and Ecuador in relation to the Participation Contract - an issue which is addressed in more detail later in this Chapter - does not, *per se*, mean that a transfer of rights and obligations was not intended by the Joint Operating Agreement. Indeed, the Tribunal has already found that the Joint Operating Agreement, by its very scope, contemplates such a transfer.\n\n307.\n\nIn addition, the Tribunal is not persuaded by the Claimants' contention that, irrespective of the Joint Operating Agreement, OEPC remained at all times the \"sole guarantor\" of the rights and obligations under the Participation Contract *vis-\u00e0-vis* Ecuador and that, consequently, these rights and obligations could not have been transferred to AEC. The reality is that by entering into the Joint Operating Agreement, OEPC agreed to share with AEC some of the rights and obligations it had under the Participation Contract and, in so doing, it agreed to a transfer of these rights and obligations. As such, prior authorization on the part of the Ecuadorian authorities was required.\n\n***(c) Nature of the Rights to be Transferred: The Joint Operating Agreement***\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n308.\n\nAs previously mentioned, the parties disagree as to the true nature of the rights and obligations conferred by OEPC to AEC by virtue of the Farmout Agreement and, in particular, the Joint Operating Agreement. The Claimants, on the one hand, contend that, pursuant to the Farmout Agreements, AEC had no real power or influence in connection with Block 15 operations, whereas the Respondent, on the other hand, submits that the Farmout Agreements provided AEC with \"operational\" influence and control over OEPC's performance as a Contractor under the Participation Agreement.\n\n309.\n\nIn support of its allegation of \"operational\" influence and control, the Respondent relies in particular on the funding and voting provisions of the Joint Operating Agreement as evidence that AEC had the ability to direct the day-to-day management or long-term strategy of Block 15 during the \"earn-in\" phase. The Claimants refute this contention, arguing that, during the \"earn-in\" phase, AEC had no right *per se* under the Joint Operating Agreement to force OEPC to operate Block 15 in one way or another. According to the Claimants, the only right that AEC obtained under the Joint Operating Agreement during the \"earn-in\" phase was the right to sit on the Management Committee. Most of the decisions by the Management Committee, they argue, did not require AEC's concurrence - only those in connection with development and work plans, budgets and joint operations. And the only consequence of a refusal by AEC to approve a work plan or budget or operation, they conclude, was that AEC would not be required to fund that particular operation.\n\n310.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that paragraph 2(a)(ii) of the Letter of Intent expressly stated that the \"Farmin Transaction is subject to the negotiation [...] of [...] a Joint Operating Agreement [...] providing the Parties joint control (in accordance with normal Joint Operating Agreement provisions) over programs and expenditures on Block 15.\" (Emphasis added) Thus, \"joint control [\u2026] over programs and expenditures on Block 15\" was clearly part of the Joint Operating Agreement's *raison d'\u00eatre*.\n\n311.\n\nThe Farmout Agreement itself refers to the Joint Operating Agreement as \"govern[ing] exploration, exploitation, development, maintenance, operation and production of Block 15\" (at Article 2.02). The Farmout Agreement also stated that OEPC was to \"serve as Operator under the JOA\" (*ibid.*).\n\n312.\n\nIn this context, the Tribunal considers it apposite to highlight certain provisions of the Joint Operating Agreement:\n\n(i) Article 4.2 of the Joint Operating Agreement under the heading \"Rights and Duties of Operator\" of Article 4 entitled \"Operator\":\n\n4.2.1 Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Operator shall have all of the rights, functions and duties of Operator under the Participating Agreements and shall have exclusive charge of and shall conduct all Joint Operations. Operator may employ independent contractors and/or agents (which may include any Non-Operator, Affiliates of Operator and Affiliates of any Non-Operator) in such Joint Operations.\n\n4.2.2 In the conduct of Joint Operations Operator shall:\n\n[\u2026]\n\n4.2.2.4 Perform the duties for the Management Committee set out in Article 5, and prepare and submit to the Management Committee the proposed Work Programs, Budgets and AFEs as provided in Article 6. Operator shall perform all Joint Operations in accordance with approved Work Programs and Budgets;\n\n[\u2026]\n\n(ii) Article 4.10.3 of the Joint Operating Agreement under the heading entitled \"Removal of Operator\" of Article 4 entitled \"Operator\":\n\n4.10.1 Subject to Article 4.11, Operator shall be removed upon receipt of notice from any Non-Operator if:\n\n[\u2026]\n\n4.10.3 Notwithstanding any provisions of this Article 4.10 to the contrary, in no event may Operator resign or be removed prior to the Transfer Date unless another Person legally entitled under the Participation Agreements to become a successor Operator may be appointed as successor Operator.\n\n(iii) Article 5.2 of the Joint Operating Agreement entitled \"Powers and Duties of Management Committee\" of Article 5 entitled \"Management Committee\":\n\nWithout prejudice to the rights and duties of Operator under this Agreement, the Management Committee shall have power and duty to authorize and supervise Joint Operations that are necessary or desirable to fulfill the Participating Agreements and properly explore and exploit the Agreement Area in accordance with this Agreement and in a manner appropriate in the circumstances. [\u2026]\n\n(iv) Article 5.9.2 of the Joint Operating Agreement entitled \"Voting Procedure\" of Article 5 entitled \"Management Committee\":\n\n5.9.2 The following acts shall require affirmative vote of one (1) or more Parties then having collectively at least sixty-six and two-thirds percent (66-2/3%) of the Participating Interests [which would necessarily include AEC]:\n\n5.9.2.1 Approval of a Development Plan;\n\n5.9.2.2 Approval of a Work Program and Budget or any amendment or modification thereof;\n\n5.9.2.3 Overexpenditures on any line item of an approved Work Program and Budget by more than twenty percent (20%) or U.S. $1,000,000, whichever is less, of the authorized amount for such line item, or overexpenditures for a Calendar Year of a total Work Program and Budget by more than ten percent (10%) or U.S. $5,000,000, whichever is less; and\n\n5.9.2.4 Decisions on financing Joint Operations (including any decisions to repay indebtedness on any such financing) prior to the Transfer Date.\n\n[...]\n\n(v) Article 5.13.5 of the Joint Operating Agreement under the heading entitled \"Effect of Vote\" of Article 5 entitled \"Management Committee\":\n\n5.13.5 No decision of the Management Committee shall be binding if it conflicts with a decision by any Integrated Management Committee with Petroecuador for the Eden-Yuturi Unit or the Limoncocha Unit or any other unit in which all or any portion of Block 15 is hereafter utilized.\n\n(vi) Article 6.3 of the Joint Operating Agreement under the heading entitled \"Production\" of Article 6 entitled \"Work Programs and Budgets\":\n\nOn or before the 1st Day of October of each Calendar Year, Operator shall deliver to the Parties a proposed production Work Program and Budget detailing the Joint Operations to be performed in the Development Area and the projected production of schedule for the following Calendar Year. Within Thirty (30) Days of such delivery, the Management Committee shall agree upon a production Work Program and Budget.\n\n(vii) Article 7.1.1 of the Joint Operating Agreement under the heading entitled \"Limitation on Applicability\" of Article 7 entitled \"Operations By Less Than All Parties\":\n\n7.1.1 No operations may be conducted in furtherance of the Participating Agreements except as Joint Operations under Article 5 or as Exclusive Operations under Article 7. No Exclusive Operation shall be conducted which conflicts with a Joint Operation or which conflicts with any of the Participating Agreements.\n\n(viii) Article 14.1 of the Joint Operating Agreement under the heading entitled \"Relationship of Parties\" of Article 14 entitled \"Relationship of Parties and Tax\":\n\nThe rights, duties, obligations and liabilities of the Parties under this Agreement shall be individual, not joint or collective. It is not the intention of the Parties to create, nor shall this Agreement be deemed or construed to create a mining or other partnership, joint venture or association or (except as explicitly provided in this Agreement) a trust. This Agreement shall not be deemed or construed to authorize any Party to act as an agent, servant or employee for any other Party for any purpose whatsoever except as explicitly set forth in this Agreement. It is understood that each Party is entering into this Agreement for the purpose of protecting and developing its Participating Interest. In their relations with each other under this Agreement, the Parties shall not be considered fiduciaries except as expressly provided in this Agreement.\n\n313.\n\nThe Tribunal further recalls that the parties, during the Hearing, pointed extensively to Management Committee minutes for purposes of analyzing AEC's actual involvement with Block 15. The Claimants refer to such minutes as evidence that AEC was only consulted as a mere financial backer with no actual veto power regarding development plans, work plans and budgets, whereas the Respondent refers to such minutes as evidence that AEC's approval was required in connection with Block 15 expenditures and operations.\n\n314.\n\nThe Tribunal has already found that, subject to paragraphs 612-659 below, by virtue of the Joint Operating Agreement, AEC was to acquire rights and interests in and under the Participating Agreements, to the extent of its 40% Participating Interest. But as can be gleaned from these provisions, the Joint Operation Agreement did not only seek to operate as a general transfer of certain rights and interests in and under the Participating Agreements. To the contrary, the Joint Operating Agreement resulted in the exercise of specific managerial and voting rights by AEC in connection with Block 15.\n\n315.\n\nIn particular, the Tribunal notes that AEC was granted the right to veto all \"acts\" of significance under the Joint Operating Agreement as a member - on an equal footing with OEPC - of the Management Committee. Article 5.1 of the Joint Operating Agreement stated that \"[t]o provide for the overall supervision and direction of Joint Operations, there is established a Management Committee composed of representatives of each Party holding a Participating Interest.\" The \"Joint Operations\", the Tribunal further recalls, are defined as \"those operations and activities carried out by the Operator pursuant to this Agreement for Block 15\" (Article 1.40 of the Joint Operating Agreement). As a member of the Management Committee, AEC thus acquired the \" power and duty to authorize and supervise Joint Operations that are necessary or desirable to fulfill the Participating Agreements and properly explore and exploit the Agreement Area in accordance with this Agreement and in a manner appropriate in the circumstances\" (Article 5.2). (Emphasis added)\n\n316.\n\nThe Management Committee's \"Voting Procedure\" under Article 5.9.2 sheds further light on AEC's real and well defined rights in its capacity as a full member of the Committee. This provision identifies a number of \"acts\" which required a majority vote, (thus the vote of both AEC and OEPC), including *inter alia* \"Approval of a Development Plan\" (Article 5.9.2.1); \"Approval of a Work Program and Budget or any amendment or modification thereof\" (Article 5.9.2.2); \"Overexpenditures on any line item of an approved Work Program and Budget by more than twenty percent (20%) or U.S. $1,000,000, whichever is less, of the authorized amount for such line item, or over expenditures for a Calendar Year of a total Work Program and Budget by more than ten percent (10%) or U.S. $5,000,000, whichever is less\" (Article 5.9.2.3); and \"Decisions on financing Joint Operations (including any decisions to repay indebtedness on any such financing) prior to the Transfer Date\" (Article 5.9.2.4).\n\n317.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, these provisions demonstrate incontrovertibly that the Joint Operating Agreement conferred to AEC real and specific managerial and voting rights in connection with Block 15, and thereby sought to confer rights under the Participation Contract, and the Tribunal so finds.\n\n318.\n\nThe fact that OEPC, as Operator, retained exclusive charge of all Joint Operations pursuant to Article 4.2.1 of the Joint Operating Agreement does not modify the Tribunal's finding. In this connection, the Tribunal notes that when, on 15 July 2004, OEPC made its formal request to PetroEcuador for the transfer to AEC of legal title to its 40% economic interest in Block 15, it confirmed explicitly that it would retain the operation of Block 15 both before and after the \"earn-in\" phase. In other words, OEPC remained sole Operator under the Participation Agreements both before and after AEC was to acquire legal title. Consequently, the fact that OEPC, after execution of the Farmout Agreement retained exclusive charge of all Joint Operations is not a relevant factor in the determination by the Tribunal of whether or not a transfer of rights to AEC was to occur prior to the vesting of legal title to those rights.\n\n319.\n\nA related issue - which the Tribunal need not determine in view of its earlier finding - concerns the question of whether AEC, prior to the vesting of legal title, was entitled to impose an \"Exclusive Operation\" in the event the Management Committee failed to reach agreement on a \"Joint Operation.\" Article 7.1.1 of the Joint Operating Agreement provided as follows:\n\nNo operations may be conducted in furtherance of the Participating Agreements except as Joint Operations under Article 5 or as Exclusive Operations under Article 7. No Exclusive Operation shall be conducted which conflicts with a Joint Operation or which conflicts with any of the Participating Agreements.\n\n320.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, the issue of whether or not AEC could impose an Exclusive Operation under the Joint Operating Agreement prior to obtaining legal title is immaterial to the question of whether AEC acquired rights under the Participation Contract. AEC's rights in connection with Block 15 Exclusive Operations do not change the fact that the Joint Operating Agreement conferred to AEC specific managerial and voting rights in connection with such Block 15 Joint Operations, and thereby sough to confer rights under the Participation Contract, as found earlier by the Tribunal.\n\n321.\n\nAnother argument by the Claimants is that AEC's specific managerial and voting rights cannot result in a transfer of rights under the Participation Contract because the Joint Operating Agreement did not allow for decisions on the part of the Management Committee that conflicted with the Participation Agreements. In support of this argument, the Claimants point to the above-quoted Article 7.1.1 of the Joint Operating Agreement, as well as Article 5.13.5 of the Joint Operating Agreement, which the Tribunal reproduces again for ease of reference:\n\n5.13.5 No decision of the Management Committee shall be binding if it conflicts with a decision by any Integrated Management Committee with Petroecuador for the Eden-Yuturi Unit or the Limoncocha Unit or any other unit in which all or any portion of Block 15 is hereafter utilized.\n\n322.\n\nThe fact that rights under the Joint Operating Agreement were to be exercised in accordance with the Participating Agreements (which would have been the case both before and after AEC had acquired legal title) does not imply that such rights were not being transferred to AEC or that they did not otherwise exist. It simply means, and the Tribunal so finds, that OEPC could not transfer other rights than those it held under the Participation Agreements: *nemo dat quod non habet*.\n\n323.\n\nThe distinction which must be made is between rights that may (or not) have been immediately \"exercisable\" by AEC, as opposed to rights that were immediately \"transferable\" to AEC. Hence, the Claimants contend that even if the Joint Operating Agreement may appear on its face to transfer specific rights to AEC in connection with the day-to-day management and operation of Block 15, these rights, they aver, could only be exercised in the future, *i.e.* once legal title had been acquired by AEC.\n\n324.\n\nIn other words, according to the Claimants, the Joint Operating Agreement did not operate an immediate transfer of rights, but rather a conditional transfer which would only vest upon transfer of legal title to AEC.\n\n325.\n\nThe Claimants' expert on this point, Mr. Norman E. Maryan Jr., opined as follows: \"I believe that the Parties intended the JOA in this case to be broadly drafted to enable its use both before and after legal title vested. I do not believe that such broadly drafted Joint Operating Agreements, such as the JOA in this case, can support the conclusion that AECI was vested with full rights of a non-operator from the inception of the JOA.\"12\n\nExpert Report of Norman E. Maryan Jr. dated 10 August 2008 at page 13.\n\n326.\n\nThe Tribunal notes however that Mr. Maryan nuanced his opinion and admitted that the rights were indeed granted, albeit \"apparently\". He stated as follows: \"I believe that many of the rights apparently granted AEC under the JOA could, in fact, not be fully exercised until after legal title vested.\"13 (Emphasis added)\n\n*Ibid.* at page 5.\n\n327.\n\nThe Respondent's expert, Mr. A. Timothy Martin, when questioned at the Hearing on Mr. Maryan's views in this regard, opined as follows: \"I disagree with this conclusion. It is my opinion that most of the rights that you would normally see in an industry JOA are, in fact, existent in this Operating Agreement, and they are fully exercised both before and after legal title vested.\"14 (Emphasis added)\n\nHearing Transcript (20 December 2008) at page 1789.\n\n328.\n\nThus, the parties' experts are in agreement that, on its face, the Joint Operating Agreement operated, at a minimum, an apparent transfer of rights, but they disagree as to whether such rights could be exercised by AEC prior to the transfer of legal title. In the Tribunal's view, the fact that the debate between the experts focussed on whether certain rights could be exercised, as opposed to whether such rights were to be transferred, is irrelevant for purposes of the findings the Tribunal has made in respect of its interpretation of the Joint Operating Agreement. The true issue is whether a transfer of rights was to occur between OEPC and AEC upon execution of the Farmout Agreement and the Joint Operating Agreement, *i.e.* whether a purported transfer of rights has been established, and the Tribunal has conclusively found this to be the case. The issue of whether such rights, once transferred, could or could not be immediately exercised is not relevant to the Tribunal's analysis.\n\n***(d) The Farmout Agreement***\n-------------------------------\n\n329.\n\nThe Tribunal has found in the previous Section that, by its terms, the Joint Operating Agreement purported to transfer rights to AEC which OEPC held under the Participation Agreements. In the present Section, the Tribunal finds that the Farmout Agreement by its terms, also purported to transfer rights to AEC, which OEPC held under the Participation Agreements.\n\n330.\n\nOne of the central provisions of the Farmout Agreement, Section 2.01, provided that, during the \"earn-in\" phase, OEPC would \"hold[] legal title to AECI's interest in the Farmout Property on behalf of AECI\". The \"Farmout Property\" was defined in Section 1.01 as including \"the Participation Agreements and the rights and interest therein granted to OEPC in and with respect to Block 15.\" Section 2.01 of the Farmout Agreement (quoted earlier) further provided, in relevant part, as follows:\n\nArt. 2.01 [...]The Farmout Interest to be transferred to AECI as of the Effective Time includes a \"working interest\" or \"participating interest\" in the Participating Agreements and Block 15 except that it does not include nominal legal title to an interest in Block 15 or an interest as a party to the Participating Agreements. OEPC shall continue to own 100% of the legal title to the Participating Agreements and to the interests in Block 15 granted or provided for in the Participating Agreements; provided that from and after the Effective Time OEPC shall hold legal title to the interest in the Farmout Property represented by the Farmout Interest of AECI in the Participating Agreements and Block 15 as a \"nominee\" with the obligation to convey legal title to such interest to AECI, subject to obtaining required governmental approvals, promptly following AECI's payment of all amounts required to earn the interest in the Farmout Property represented by the Farmout Interest as hereafter provided and the expenditure of such amounts by OEPC as Operator under the JOA for Block 15 Capex (as hereinafter defined). Prior to such conveyance, while OEPC holds legal title to AECI's interest in the Farmout Property on behalf of AECI, OEPC shall be obligated, at the sole risk, cost and expense of AECI, to act with respect to the Farmout Interest of AECI as AECI shall direct from time to time as if AECI were a party to the Participating Agreements owning legal title to a 40% interest in the Participating Agreements and the interests therein granted in Block 15, subject to and in accordance with the terms and provisions of the JOA provided for in Section 2.02. (Emphasis added)\n\n331.\n\nIt is clear to the Tribunal that this crucial Section 2.01 of the Farmout Agreement confirms that AEC was to have *de facto* legal title to its interest in the \"Farmout Property,\" but that this title was to be \"held\" by OEPC on its behalf until the required governmental approvals were obtained. This provision further confirms that OEPC had undertaken to act as the Contractor under the Participation Contract - a right it had acquired on an exclusive basis - \"as if\u2019 AEC was a party to this Participation Contract. In reality, as between OEPC and AEC, the situation was identical both before and after conveyance of legal title in so far as the Participation Contract was concerned; they were operating *de facto* pursuant to the Joint Operating Agreement \"as if\" legal title had already been conveyed, and the ministerial authorization for the conveyance of legal title was a mere formality. More fundamentally, in the view of the Tribunal, this meant that OEPC was sharing with AEC its exclusive right to carry out Block 15 operations and was obligated \"to act with respect to the Farmout Interest of AECI as AECI shall direct from time to time.\" This Section 2.01 of the Farmout Agreement, coupled with those provisions of the Joint Operating Agreement which the Tribunal reviewed previously, comfort the Tribunal in its conclusion that OEPC did indeed seek to transfer to AEC under these agreements rights it acquired from Ecuador under the Participation Contract.\n\n***(e) Privity of Contract***\n-----------------------------\n\n332.\n\nOne of the Claimants' main argument in support of its contention that OEPC did not transfer or assign rights under the Participation Contract to AEC contrary to Clause 16.1 of the Participation Contract and in violation of Article 74.11 of the HCL is that, until legal title was transferred to AEC, only OEPC remained liable *vis-\u00e0-vis* the Respondent and PetroEcuador for the performance of the Participation Contract and that only OEPC could enforce its rights under the Participation Contract. In other words, according to the Claimants, an assignment or transfer of contractual rights required privity between AEC and the Respondent and since the transfer of a 40% economic interest did not create such privity, AEC did not acquire rights in the Participation Contract that could be enforced against Ecuador.\n\n333.\n\nThe Tribunal is not persuaded by the Claimants' submission. The fact that OEPC may have retained legal title and that no privity as between AEC and Ecuador existed in relation to the Participation Contract does not necessarily lead to the conclusion, in the circumstances of this case, that the Farmout Agreement and/or the Joint Operating Agreement did not purport to transfer rights from OEPC to AEC, as the Tribunal has found.\n\n334.\n\nThe Tribunal observes that, if it adopted the Claimants' argument, an unauthorized transfer or assignment of rights in a case such as the present one, could never be found. Privity necessarily implies authorization on the part of the Ecuadorian authorities since it requires that AEC be made a party to the Participation Contract, which cannot happen without such authorization. The Claimants appeared to recognize that their argument was illogical since they acknowledged that \"neither the transfer of economic interest nor the unauthorized transfer of legal title would have created privity.\"\n\n335.\n\nThe Tribunal also observes that Article 4.01 of the Farmout Agreement confirms the Tribunal's conclusion. Under this Article, the conveyance of legal title and the creation of privity between AEC and PetroEcuador under the Participation Contract are clearly identified as two separate and distinct legal transactions. This Article, which is found in Part IV of the Farmout Agreement, titled \"Assignment of Legal Title\", reads as follows:\n\nArt. 4.01 Promptly after AECI has made all payments of the OEPC Carry provided for in Sections 3.03, 3.04 and 3.05 and OEPC as Operator under the JOA has expended such amounts for Block 15 Capex, OEPC and AECI shall execute and deliver such documents as are required to convey legal title to AECI in and to a 40% economic interest in the Participating Agreements and Block 15 and to make AECI a party to the Participating Agreements as owner of such 40% economic interest (subject to obtaining required governmental approvals). Any transfer fees or administrative charges imposed by any government agency or department with respect to such transactions shall be paid by AECI. (Emphasis added)\n\n336.\n\nIn sum, the absence of privity in the circumstances of this case is of no consequence in view of the Tribunal's earlier findings that OEPC sought to transfer to AEC rights it held under the Participation Contract. The Farmout Agreement itself confirms the Tribunal's conclusion.\n\n***(f) The Remaining Allegations of Breach of the Participation Contract and HCL*** ***Violations***\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n337.\n\nHaving found that the Farmout Agreement and the Joint Operating Agreement purported to effect a transfer of rights under the Participation Contract from OEPC to AEC, the Tribunal need not address the question of whether it also created a consortium contrary to Clause 16.4 of the Participation Contract and in violation of Article 74.12 of the HCL. For the same reason, the Tribunal need not address the Respondent's allegations of technical infractions on the part of OEPC in violation of Article 74.13 of the HCL.\n\n338.\n\nEven if the Tribunal were to find in favor of the Respondent with respect to these allegations, these findings would not affect the conclusion of the Tribunal that the *Caducidad* Decree was not a proportionate response by Ecuador in the particular circumstances of this case.15 In addition, the Tribunal notes that whether it finds one, two or three violations by the Claimants of the HCL, the sanction remains the same: *Caducidad*. The sanction is not cumulative.\n\nSee*Infra,* paragraph 442\n\n339.\n\nThe Tribunal will now turn to the issue of OEPC's obligation to obtain authorization from the \"Corresponding Ministry\" for this transfer and whether OEPC did seek such authorization.\n\n***2. OEPC's Duty to Obtain Authorization for the Transfer of Rights under the*** ***Participation Contract***\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n340.\n\nAs noted earlier, it is undisputed that in order to proceed with a transfer of rights under the Participation Contract, OEPC was required to obtain prior authorization on the part of the Ecuadorian authorities. The previously-quoted Clause 16.1 of the Participation Contract clearly stated:\n\n***SIXTEEN: TRANSFER AND ASSIGNMENT.-***\n\n***16.1*** Transfer of this Participation Contract or assignment to third parties of the rights under the Participation Contract, must have the authorization of the Corresponding Ministry, in accordance with existing laws and regulations, especially the provisions contained in Art. 79 of the Hydrocarbons Law and Executive Decrees No. 809, 2713 and 1179. (Emphasis added)\n\n341.\n\nJust as clearly, Clause 21.1.2 of the Contract expressly provided that the Participation Contract shall terminate \"[d]ue to a transfer of rights and obligations of the Participation Contract without prior authorization of the Corresponding Ministry.\" (Emphasis added) The Tribunal recalls that the Participation Contract tracks the requirements of Ecuador's HCL, in particular the following:\n\n***CHAPTER IX***\n\n***Caducidad, Sanctions and Transfers***\n\nArt. 74. The Ministry of Energy and Mines may declare the *caducidad* of contracts, if the contractor:\n\n[...]\n\n11. Transfers rights or enters into a private contractor agreement for the assignment of one or more of its rights, without the Ministry's authorization ;\n\n[\u2026]\n\nArt. 79. The transfer of a contract or the assignment to third parties of rights derived from a contract shall be null and void and shall have no validity whatsoever if there is no prior authorization from the Ministry of Energy and Mines, without prejudice to the declaration of *caducidad* as provided for in this Law.\n\n[...] (Emphasis added)\n\n342.\n\nIn its review of the evidence on this crucial issue, the Tribunal notes, firstly, that the Letter of Intent dated 9 August 200016, signed prior to entering into of the Farmout Agreement and Joint Operating Agreement, stated at paragraph 5 that the \"Farmin Transaction would be expressly conditioned upon the approval by the respective Boards of Directors of AECI and Occidental Petroleum Corporation and necessary governmental approvals, if any, including without limitation, the approval of Ministry of Energy and Mines in Ecuador.\" (Emphasis added) There was thus no consensus between AEC and OEPC that ministerial authorization was necessary.\n\nSee*supra* at paragraph 128.\n\n343.\n\nThe evidence before the Tribunal discloses that the debate within the ranks of OEPC as to whether or not ministerial authorization was necessary with respect to the first phase of the Farmout continued after the execution of the Letter of Intent. Two separate draft letters to the Ecuadorian Minister of Energy and Mines, both dated 23 October 2000, constitute proof eloquent that there were indeed two schools of thought in this regard. These draft letters prepared by OEPC officials set forth different courses of action and, in the Tribunal's opinion, assist in understanding the events that followed. The first draft letter, \"Version A,\" is worded as follows:\n\nI. BACKGROUND\n\n1. As you are aware, OEPC and PETROECUADOR entered into a Participation Contract for upstream activities in Block 15 of the Amazon Region, in the terms and conditions contained in the corresponding Public Deed, recorded with the National Hydrocarbons Registry on June 2, 1999.\n\n2. In order to reinforce the additional exploration work, development and production of Block 15, OEPC and AOEPC [AEC] are in the process of studying the possibility of executing an agreement based on which AOEPC [AEC] would contribute funds to finance part of the investments required for such purpose, in exchange of a share in the proceeds derived from such investment. AOEPC [AEC] would not acquire the rights and obligations derived from said Participation Contract, and OEPC will continue to comply with said Contract and will continue to be the sole liable party towards PETROECUADOR. Consequently, this negotiation only implies the acquisition by AOEPC [AEC] of an economic interest in the results produced by such additional exploration work, development and production of the Block 15 Participation Contract, without AOEPC [AEC] acquiring legal tile in said Contract. OEPC will continue to be the only entity with legal rights and obligations under the Block 15 Participation Contract.\n\n3. Based on this negotiation, OEPC would recognize to AOEPC [AEC] the right to acquire legal title and an effective share in the Block 15 Participation Contract, once the several conditions that would be stipulated in the agreement, prior clearance from the Ministry of Energy and Mines, and other requirements of Ecuadorian laws and the Block 15 Participation Contract between OEPC and PETROECUADOR are met.\n\nI. REQUEST:\n\nIn view of the above and based on the provisions contained in Article 74(1) and Article 79 of the Law on Hydrocarbons, as well as the regulatory rules issued for the application of said law, we request the following:\n\n1. Please confirm whether, as is our understanding, the transaction described in the background to this request does not require the prior approval referred to in Article 74(11) and 79 of the Law on Hydrocarbons. As indicated above, this transaction does not imply an assignment of legal title or rights in the Block 15 Contract, but rather it is a simple recognition in favor of AOEPC [AEC] of an economic interest in the results derived from said contract. If, however, AOEPC [AEC] will acquire legal title and rights in the Block 15 Participation Contract once the conditions to be stipulated in said agreement are fulfilled, then prior clearance from the Ministry of Energy and Mines and compliance of other procedures and requirements contemplated by Ecuadorian laws would be required;\n\n2. On a subsidiary basis, in the unlikely event that your answer to the preceding point is negative, we request you authorize OEPC to assign to AOEPC [AEC] an economic interest in the results produced by the additional exploration work, development and production of the Block 15 Participation Contract. In this case, we request you also authorize the agreement by virtue of which both companies would agree that once several conditions to be stipulated in the contract to be executed between them have been fulfilled, OEPC would transfer to AOEPC [AEC] legal title and rights in the Block 15 Participation Contract, prior compliance of other procedures and requirements contemplated by applicable Ecuadorian laws and regulations and the Block 15 Participation Contract. It should be noted that the transaction described in the background to this request would not, in any way, affect the rights and obligations assumed by the Contractor - OEPC - under the Participation Contract with PETROECUADOR; and that the transfer of rights in Block 15, which would be made once the several conditions to be stipulated in said agreement are fulfilled, would in no way diminish the capacity of the Block 15 Contractor. Not only would OEPC continue to be jointly liable for contract compliance, but AOEPC [AEC] would also be liable for the compliance of said obligations. It should also be noted that the financial, technical and operative capacity of AOEPC [AEC] to enter into upstream contracts has already been qualified by the Ecuadorian Government since the time Petroecuador executed several upstream contracts with said company.\n\n3. Lastly, in the event the answer to the first point is negative, we would also appreciate your indicating whether the payments contemplated in Article 2.b of Presidential Decree 809 (Official Gazette 197, May 31, 1985) that regulates the application of Article 79 of the Law on Hydrocarbons must be made as a result of the authorization referred to in point 2 above; or, otherwise whether such sums must be paid only when the transfer of rights and obligations in the Block 15 Participation Contract, by OEPC in favor of AOEPC [AEC], becomes effective. As repeatedly stated above, the transfer would be made only when several conditions to be agreed in the agreement that would be negotiated are fulfilled, and after other formalities and requirements contemplated by Ecuadorian Law and the conditions stipulated in the Participation Contract have been met. (Emphasis added)\n\n344.\n\nVersion B, on the other hand, is formulated as follows:\n\nI. BACKGROUND\n\n1. As you are aware, OEPC and PETROECUADOR entered into a Participation Contract for upstream activities in Block 15 of the Amazon Region, in the terms and conditions contained in the corresponding Public Deed, recorded with the National Hydrocarbons Registry on June 2, 1999.\n\n2. In order to reinforce the additional exploration work, development and production of Block 15, upon receipt of all required government approvals, OEPC and AOEPC [AEC] will complete an agreement based on which AOEPC [AEC] would contribute funds to finance part of the investments required for such purpose, in exchange for a forty percent (40%) share in the proceeds derived from the Block including its unitized operations. AOEPC [AEC] would only acquire the rights and obligations derived from said Participation Contract at a future time and only after the Ministry of Energy and Mines granted its express approval, prior to the time that such rights are transferred. Until such future transfer is separately approved by the Ministry of Energy and Mines and finalized with OAEPC [ *sic* ] [AEC], OEPC will continue to comply with said Participation Contract and will continue to be the sole party liable to PETROECUADOR. Consequently, the agreement to be completed, for the present only implies the acquisition by AOEPC [AEC] of an economic interest in the results produced from the Block 15 Participation Contract, without AOEPC [AEC] acquiring any legal title in said Participation Contract. OEPC will continue to be the only entity with legal rights and obligations under the Block 15 Participation Contract.\n\n3. In addition to the economic interest presently being acquired by AOEPC [AEC], as described above, and based on the negotiated agreement to be completed between OEPC and AOEPC [AEC], OEPC will commit to assign to AOEPC [AEC], sometime during or after January, 2005, legal title and an effective share in the Block 15 Participation Contract and its unitized operations, but only once the several conditions stipulated in the agreement, the requirement for prior clearance from the Ministry of Energy and Mines, and other requirements of Ecuadorian laws and the Block 15 Participation Contract between OEPC and PETROECUADOR are satisfied. Separate approval of this transfer of interest in the Block 15 Participation Contract and unitized areas will be sought from the Ministry of Energy and Mines at future time.\n\nI. REQUEST:\n\nIn view of the above and based on the provisions contained in Article 74 (11) (12) and Article 79 of the Law on Hydrocarbons, as well as the regulatory rules issued for the application of said law, we request the following:\n\n1. Please grant for this transaction the prior approval referenced in Articles 74 (11) (12) and 79 of the Law on Hydrocarbons or else indicate that no such approval is required for such transaction. As indicated above, this transaction does not imply a present assignment of legal title or rights in the Block 15 Participation Contract, but rather is a simple recognition in favor of AOEPC [AEC] of an economic interest in the results derived from said contract.\n\n2. Under the negotiated agreement between OEPC and AOEPC [AEC], AOEPC [AEC] may acquire legal title and rights in the Block 15 Participation Contract and unitized areas, provided that approval from the Ministry of Energy and Mines is obtained prior to the time of the transfer, and further, provided that the conditions to be stipulated in said agreement are satisfied, and finally, provided that compliance of other procedures and requirement contemplated by Ecuadorian laws is achieved.\n\n3. Lastly, we would also appreciate your indicating whether the payments contemplated in Article 2.b of Presidential Decree 809 (Official Gazette 197, May 31, 1985) that regulates the application of Article 79 of the Law on Hydrocarbons must be made as a result of the authorization referred to in point 1 above; or, otherwise whether such sums must be paid only when the transfer of rights and obligations in the Block 15 Participation Contract, by OEPC in favour of AOEPC [AEC], becomes effective as described in point 2 above. As repeatedly stated above, the transfer would be made only when several conditions to be agreed in the agreement that would be negotiated are fulfilled, and after the other formalities and requirements contemplated by Ecuadorian Law, including the requirement for formal approval by the Ministry of Mines and Energy, and all other conditions stipulated in the Participation Contract have been met. (Emphasis added)\n\n345.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, the two camps within OEPC had sound and valid reasons for advocating their respective positions. The proponents of Version A saw the Farmout for what it truly was for oilmen, *i.e.* an \"oil for money\" deal which allowed OEPC to finance and leverage its continued exploration of Block 15. In effect, AEC would serve as a bank for OEPC. During the \"earn-in\" phase, OEPC would continue to be solely responsible *vis-\u00e0-vis* PetroEcuador for the performance of all its obligations under the Participation Contract. The future event which mattered and which would require ministerial authorization was the eventual transfer of legal title to AEC of 40% of Block 15 sometime later when AEC, the farmee, had fulfilled its \"earn-in\" obligations under the Farmout.\n\n346.\n\nThe proponents of Version A within OEPC (and AEC) were in good company which included the Claimants' expert on this issue, Mr. Andrew Derman. In his report submitted as part of this proceeding, Mr. Derman concluded, very categorically, that \"[t]here was no transfer of legal title or rights and obligations under the Participation Contract by OEPC to AEC under either the Farmout Agreement or the Operating Agreement.\"17 As he explained later in his report:\n\nUnder the Farmout Agreement, if AEC satisfied its payment obligations, AEC had a right to receive from OEPC a portion of OEPC's oil produced under the Participation Contract. While OEPC could not guarantee that AEC would receive legal title, as legal title required approval by the Government of Ecuador, OEPC had a right to dispose of its oil freely, under the Participation Contract, and it could give AEC a portion of such produced oil. AEC essentially financed a portion of OEPC's financial exposure and, like a bank, AEC was repaid and compensated under the pre-agreed terms of the Farmout Agreement. If the Government of Ecuador did not approve the assignment of legal title, AEC would be repaid and compensated for its financing, but it would never secure its position and it would never obtain legal title. Like a bank, AEC's financing would remain uncollateralized.18 (Emphasis added)\n\nExpert Report of Andrew B. Derman dated 10 August 2008 at paragraph 15.\n\n*Ibid.* at paragraph 37.\n\n347.\n\nOn the other hand, the proponents of Version B, probably the lawyers, advocated that it was prudent to ask for \"prior approval\" for the \"earn-in\" phase. They had obviously carried out a cursory examination of the agreements at issue. But tellingly, the proponents of Version B were not dogmatic about the requirement of ministerial authorization. As noted earlier, the key paragraph of their draft concluded or else indicate that no such approval is required for such transaction.\"\n\n348.\n\nMembers of the Version A clan prevailed. They did not heed the sound advice of the lawyers and, in doing so, may have acted unwisely and been imprudent. Their proposed course of action may have been risky, as later events confirmed, but, for the reasons set forth in more detail below, the Tribunal fails to see any evidence that their views were driven by bad faith. They were business people, seasoned oilmen, for whom legal niceties were not as important as the business realities of the deal. Their behaviour, unfortunately for the Claimants, was to have dire consequences.\n\n349.\n\nThat behaviour, as the record after 23 October 2000 illustrates, led to other instances where OEPC's silence and, in particular, one confusing written message, resulted in serious misunderstandings and understandable confusion within the Ecuadorian Ministry of Energy and Mines.\n\n350.\n\nThe saga which has culminated in the present dispute commenced on 24 October 2000. As noted earlier, on that date, senior executives of both OEPC and AEC flew to Quito from the United States and Canada for the purpose of informing Minister Teran of the transaction. The reason for the meeting was not conveyed to the Minister when the appointment was scheduled.\n\n351.\n\nThe \"script\" prepared for that important meeting demonstrates, without the shadow of a doubt, that the proponents of Version A had carried the day and that no authorization would be sought for the \"earn-in\" phase. The first three numbered paragraphs of this \"script\" tell the whole story in a nutshell by highlighting that:\n\n1) Oxy and AEC have agreed that AEC will assume a 40% economic interest in Block 15 effective 01 Oct 00.\n\n2) AEC will assume a role as full partner effective 2005, subject to GoE approval.\n\n3) No initial change in the contractual rights and obligations or legal title for Bl15. No change in operational methodology for Petroecuador or the GoE. (Emphasis added)\n\n352.\n\nThe first paragraph of the \"script\" thus, very succinctly, describes the \"earn-in\" phase, for which no authorization is sought, nor confirmation that authorization is not required. The second paragraph of the \"script\", again succinctly, describes the subsequent phase by which AEC would become a \"full partner\" by virtue of acquiring legal title and for which \"GoE approval\" is required. The third paragraph sets forth the Claimants' view of the world during the \"earn-in\" phase.\n\n353.\n\nDuring the meeting of 24 October 2000, Minister Teran was not provided with a copy of the Farmout Agreement which OEPC and AEC had signed five days earlier. While there is no evidence that the Minister asked for a copy of the Agreement, the Tribunal has formed the view that the better course would have been to have handed a copy to the Minister. After all, OEPC and the Government of Ecuador were partners under the Participation Contract. If only on the basis of that contractual relationship, OEPC should have concluded that the better course was to provide a copy of the Farmout Agreement to their partner during that meeting.\n\n354.\n\nOn 25 October 2000, Paul MacInnes, President of OEPC, who had lead the OEPC team during the meeting on the previous day wrote to Minister Teran. Due to the importance of this letter, which has already been referred to19, the Tribunal will quote it in full:\n\nIn our meeting held on October 24 of this year, we had the opportunity to notify you about the imminent transaction pursuant to which Occidental Exploration and Production Company (\"OEPC\") intends to transfer to City Investing Company Limited (\"CITY\") 40% of its economic interests in the Participation Contract for the Exploitation and Additional Exploration of Hydrocarbons in Block 15 (the \"Block 15 Contract\"). This transfer shall also include the rights of OEPC in the Operating Agreements for Unified Exploitation of the Eden Yuturi and Limoncocha Unified Fields.\n\nAfter the consummation of this transaction, OEPC shall continue being the only \"Contractor\" entity under the Block 15 Contract. Once CITY has complied with its obligations contemplated in the transfer agreement, OEPC shall transfer to CITY the legal title corresponding to 40% of its interests in the Block 15 Contract and in the Operating Agreements for Unified Exploitation, subject to the approvals that the Government of Ecuador may require at that time.\n\nThis transaction will not negatively affect any of the operations contemplated in the Block 15 Contract or in the Operating Agreements for Unified Exploitation.\n\nWe are sure that this transaction will bring significant benefits to the Government of Ecuador and the companies. Therefore, we respectfully request that the Ministry of Energy and Mines confirm as soon as possible, your consent with respect to the aforementioned transfer of economic interests in favor of CITY.\n\nSee*supra* at paragraph 151.\n\n355.\n\nThat letter is very confusing and at the source of conflicting evidence both as to events prior to and subsequent to that date.\n\n356.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the letter was written in Spanish but there is no dispute between the parties as to the accuracy of the English translation. The introductory paragraph, which refers to \"the imminent transaction\", is clearly a reference to the \"earn-in\" phase. The Tribunal recalls that, whilst the Farmout Agreement was executed on 19 October 2000 to be effective 1 October 2000, the Joint Operating Agreement was dated 31 October 2000 to \"have effect from the 1st day of October 2000\". In other words, while it may have been strictly correct for OEPC to refer to an \"imminent transaction\", it would have been more accurate to refer to a transaction (and thus a \"transfer\") which had taken place 6 days earlier, on 19 October 2000, and which was in effect since 1 October 2000. Indeed, the Tribunal notes that paragraph 1) of the \"script\" correctly stated that \"Oxy and AEC have agreed..\" (Emphasis added)\n\n357.\n\nThe Tribunal further observes that in the second paragraph of the letter of 25 October 2000, OEPC is clearly referring to the subsequent phase of the Farmout which, it states, is \"subject to the approval that the Government of Ecuador may require at that time.\"\n\n358.\n\nAs for the third paragraph of this letter, in the Tribunal's view, it can only be interpreted as referring to the \"earn-in\" phase. \"This transaction\" clearly refers to the \"imminent transaction\" described in the introductory paragraph.\n\n359.\n\nThus, the first three paragraphs of the follow-up letter of 25 October 2000 are in fact a reiteration, albeit more detailed, of the first three paragraphs of the \"script.\"\n\n360.\n\nBy contrast, the very last paragraph of the letter does not fit either the script or the Version A approach. What is perplexing is that, after a few weeks of confusion, as the Tribunal will demonstrate later, as far as OEPC is concerned, it acted *vis-\u00e0-vis* Ecuador as if this last paragraph referred to the subsequent phase of the Farmout, not the \"earn-in\" phase. In the Tribunal's view, this clearly was not the case. That paragraph is misleading. The Tribunal does not believe that OEPC intended to mislead Minister Teran but that was nevertheless the result of the imprecise wording.\n\n361.\n\nThe paragraph at issue, the Tribunal recalls again, reads as follows:\n\nWe are sure that this transaction will bring significant benefits to the Government of Ecuador and the companies. Therefore, we respectfully request that the Minister of Energy and Mines confirm as soon as possible, your consent with respect to the aforementioned transfer of economic interests in favour of CITY.\n\n362.\n\nIn the second sentence of that fourth paragraph, OEPC can only be seeking from Minister Ter\u00e1n confirmation of his consent to the transfer (\" *transferencia* \") described in the introductory paragraph, to wit the \"earn-in\" phase. This interpretation, the Tribunal notes, contradicts the evidence of the Claimants' witnesses who maintain that, at the 24 October meeting, Minister Ter\u00e1n, explicitly or implicitly, had agreed with them that no ministerial authorization was required for the \"earn-in\" phase.\n\n363.\n\nOn the other hand, the mutual waiver executed by OEPC and AEC on 31 October 2000 also confirms the prevailing OEPC and AEC view that no government approval was required for the transfer of the 40% economic interest. This waiver is consistent with Version A, the script, and the first three paragraphs of the 25 October letter but not with the fourth paragraph of that letter. It reads as follows: \"Of even date herewith, [OEPC] and [AECI] are consummating that certain Farmout Agreement [\u2026] pursuant to which OEPC is farming out and transferring to AECI a 40% economic interest in certain properties [etc.]..\". Then, in numbered paragraph 1, the mutual waiver of 31 October 2000 further confirms that the parties agree that:\n\n1. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in the Farmout Agreement or in any related document, OEPC and AECI hereby expressly waive satisfaction of any and all requirements for governmental approvals applicable to the transfer by OEPC to AECI of said 40% economic interest in the Farmout Property. The foregoing mutual waiver is not intended, however, and shall not be construed to constitute a waiver by either party hereto of any requirements for governmental approvals applicable to (a) the assignment, transfer or assignments, transfers or conveyances by OEPC and Occidental del Ecuador, Inc. to AECI provided for in that certain letter agreement or even date herewith, by and among OEPC, Occidental del Ecuador, Inc., AECI and AEC OCP Holdings Ltd., relating to the Oleoducto de Crudos Pesados (OCP) Project referred to therein. (Emphasis added)\n\n364.\n\nOn 1 November 2000, OPC issued a press release. That news release is wholly inconsistent with the theory of the Respondent that the Claimants wanted to conceal their transaction with AEC. For the oil savvy operators in the Ministry of Energy and Mines and the experienced oil engineers in PetroEcuador familiar with the intricacies of oil exploration and operation by international companies such as OPC, that press release contains the information which they needed to become cognizant of the Farmout, not the minute detail of the actual transaction which would only have been revealed if they could have read the Farmout Agreement and the Joint Operating Agreement, but certainly the general structure of the farmout transaction.20 It read in relevant part as follows:\n\nOccidental Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:OXY) said today that it has agreed to farm out an interest in its operations in Block 15 in Ecuador to Alberta Energy Company Ltd., of Calgary, Canada.\n\nAEC will earn a 40-percent interest in the block and will assume certain capital costs through 2004. Occidental will remain the operator.\n\nIn this context, the Tribunal notes the description provided by Mr. Derman of a farmout agreement. He states (see Expert Report of Andrew B. Derman dated 10 August 2008 at paragraph 27): \"Provisions like Sections 2.01, 2.02, and 4.01 are common to farmout agreements under which a farmee party like AEC acquires an interest in an oil and gas project by \"earning-in\" (paying money or performing services). Typically, a farmee (AEC) earning into an oil and gas project negotiates to have some influence regarding the management and operation of the farmout interest until title transfers, which like the Farmout Agreement is subject to host government approval (where such approval is required) and satisfaction of the farmee's earn-in obligations. However, until title transfers and the farmee becomes a party to the host government contract (in this case the Participation Contract), the farmor (OEPC) remains solely responsible to fulfill the obligations under the contract vis-\u00e0-vis the host government. Thus, the degree of participation allowed to a farmee, who has no right or obligation vis-\u00e0-vis the host government, is the subject of much negotiation.\"\n\n365.\n\nAn internal memorandum of 8 November 2000 within the Ministry will be considered later in this Award when the Tribunal addresses the issue of whether the sanction of *caducidad* was proportionate in the circumstances. At this juncture, the Tribunal notes that, in this memorandum, officials of the Ministry - acting on the misleading request set out in the last paragraph of the 25 October 2000 letter - conclude plainly that AEC \"has proven that it has technical solvency\" and that \"there would be no impediment for that assignment of rights\" (*i.e.* the \"earn-in\" phase). It reads as follows:\n\nSUBJECT: TRANSFER OF 40% OF THE ECONOMIC INTERESTS OF THE BLOCK 15 PARTICIPATION CONTRACT BY OCCIDENTAL EXPLORATION TO CITY INVESTING COMPANY\n\nWith regard to letter No. GG-014-00 dated October 25, 2000, in which Occidental reports the transfer of 40% of the economic interests in the Participation Contract for Hydrocarbons Production and Additional Exploration for Block 15, including the OEPC rights in the Unified Production Operating Agreements for the Unified Ed\u00e9n Yuturi and Limoncocha Fields to City Investing Company, I would like to inform you of the following:\n\nCity Investing currently has a Participation Contract with the Government in the Tarapoa Block and Fanny-18B and Mariann-4A Unified Fields and is the current operator of the aforementioned Fields. Therefore, it has proven that it has technical solvency, and for this reason, there would be no impediment for that assignment of rights.\n\n366.\n\nThe Tribunal notes three important facets in this memorandum: (i) it refers clearly to a \"transfer\" that has taken place, not a future transfer; (ii) AEC is well known in Ecuador and is considered to have technical solvency (\" *solvencia t\u00e9cnica* \"); and (iii) in characterizing the transfer, it speaks of an \"assignment of rights\" (\" *cesi\u00f3n de derechos* \"), the very words used in Clause 16.1 of the Participation Contract.\n\n367.\n\nIt is plainly obvious that, within the Ministry, there reigns at that time much confusion and that this confusion is due solely to the careless drafting by OEPC of the last paragraph of the 25 October 2000 letter.\n\n368.\n\nThere was a meeting of the Joint Management Committee on 22 November 2000 attended by representatives of Petroproduccion and Occidental. Paul MacInnes reported to the meeting on the \"Agreement with AECI.\" The relevant item in the minutes reads as follows:\n\n2. REPORT ON THE AGREEMENT WITH AECI\n\nPaul MacInnes reports to the Joint Management Committee on the negotiations carried out between OEPC and Alberta Energy Corporation International (AECI), by virtue of which OEPC would sell to AECI 40% of the shares in Block 15, long term. He indicates that a letter was sent to the Ministry of Energy and Mines reporting on these negotiations. This change does not mean a change in OEPC operations, as it is only a stake by AECI in part [of] the capital and OEPC could invest in other projects.\n\nThe contractual obligations that OEPC has with the Government would remain unchanged.\n\n369.\n\nThe minutes appear to suggest that the Farmout Agreement was in the process of being negotiated (\"*vender\u00e1*\"). However, the evidence before the Tribunal does not disclose who drafted the minutes which are signed by the participants but not by Paul MacInnes. In any event, in the Tribunal's view, it demonstrates again that, for the Claimants, their transaction with AEC was in the public domain in Ecuador. The transaction was definitely not a secret.\n\n370.\n\nAlso on 22 November 2000, Dr. Salgado, the Director of the DNH in the Ministry, wrote a letter to Paul MacInnes, in effect acknowledging receipt of Paul MacInnes' confusing letter of 25 October 2000. Dr. Salgado can be excused for misinterpreting OEPC's request to transfer to AEC 40% of its economic interests and referring instead to a request for \"authorization to transfer 40% of the rights it has in Block 15\" (*i.e.* the second phase). Quite naturally, Dr. Salgado then proceeds to ask for \"information to guarantee the economic solvency of [AEC]\".\n\n371.\n\nOn 14 December, Dr. Salgado received a visit from Fernando Albuja of OEPC. It is clear to the Tribunal that OEPC has now realized that its carelessness has caused much confusion within the Ministry. Thus, Fernando Albuja's mission was to put Version A back on the rails.\n\n372.\n\nAs the Tribunal notes from the contemporaneous report of Fernando Albuja to Paul MacInnes following that meeting, the last paragraph of the 25 October letter 2000 is now stated to be \"a notice of the future transaction\". As the Tribunal has already found, this is clearly not what was written in the 25 October 2000 letter. But, the views of clan A, as expressed in the script that no authorization is required for the \"earn-in\" phase transfer, prevail again. Only the subsequent phase will require ministerial authorization and there is no outstanding request for approval of the \"earn-in\" phase. In other words, it was as if the last paragraph of the 25 October 2000 letter was never written.\n\n373.\n\nThe Tribunal considers it important to quote in full Fernando Albuja's account of this meeting:\n\nWe had a meeting with the DNH regarding the notice of the Minister about the AECI deal. Their initial position was to understand the deal as a current transfer of rights. They explained that they were ready to issue a Ministerial Decree authorizing the transfer. After reviewing with them the terms of our letter they realized that the letter basically contains a notice of the future transaction. The answer from the DNH to our letter will be as an acknowledgement of the notice given to them stating that the corresponding Ministerial Decree will be issued once OEPC request the government to authorize the transfer. Meanwhile OEPC will remain 100% liable for the performance of Block 15 contract. (Emphasis added)\n\n374.\n\nThe confusion created by the wording of the last paragraph of the 25 October 2000 letter has thus been cleared up by the Version A proponents and, rightly or wrongly, the conclusion of OEPC that the \"earn-in\" phase did not require ministerial authorization remains the company mantra, with OEPC and Ecuador, as of this point, now on the same page. For OEPC, it has cleared the air and the Ministry has been informed.\n\n375.\n\nFully in accordance with the message that he received from Mr. Albuja on 14 December 2000, Dr. Salgado reported to Minister Teran on 12 January 2001 that OEPC intended to assign \"in the future\" 40% of the rights and obligations for Block 15 and, \"when they decide\", they \"will require the corresponding approval.\"\n\n376.\n\nAnd thus, on 17 January 2001, Minister Teran wrote to Paul MacInnes an official letter which brought the exchange between OEPC and the Ministry to an end for the time being. Minister Teran acknowledged that \"(i)n the meeting held at the National Directorate of Hydrocarbons, officers from Occidental said that the 40% transfer of rights and obligations previously mentioned would not be implemented at the moment\". When the \"previously mentioned transfer,\" was to be \"implemented,\" wrote the Minister, you \"must request to this State Ministry the corresponding authorization and the issuance of the Ministerial Decree through which such transfer will be legalized, with the prior payment of the transfer fees and enhancement of the economic conditions of the contract, as it is stipulated in Art. 1 of the Executive Decree 2731, published in the Official Register No. 694, dated May 12, 1995\".\n\n377.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the OEPC 2000 mantra was still maintained three years later when the Claimants described the 2000 Farmout Agreement to Moores Rowland. In his letter of 15 March 2004, Paul MacInnes wrote:\n\nIn the year 2000, OEPC and AEC Ecuador signed an agreement by means of which, subject to satisfying certain conditions and subject to approvals required by the Ecuadorian Government, they committed themselves to transfer in the future the legal title corresponding to 40% interest in the Contract for Block 15 and the Operational Agreements for Unified Exploitation.\n\n378.\n\nAlthough there is no specific reference in that letter to the transfer to AEC of a 40% economic interest in 2000, the letter is consistent with the conclusion reached by OEPC and AEC in October 2000 when they visited Minister Teran that this was a two-phase transaction and that the first phase did not require ministerial authorization.\n\n379.\n\nThe Tribunal finds in the record another statement by OEPC with the same mantra in the letter sent to PetroEcuador in July 2004 in which it requested approval of the transfer of legal title to AEC in accordance with Article 79 of the Hydrocarbons Law and Article 46 of the Regulation for the Application of Law 44, and as contemplated by Clause 16.1 of the Participation Contract.\" The first phase is not mentioned explicitly because, in October 2000, OEPC and AEC had reached the conclusion that it did not require ministerial authorization:\n\nIn the year 2000, Occidental Exploration and Production Company (\"OEPC\") and AEC Ecuador LDT (formerly known as City Investing Company Limited) (\"AEC\" Ecuador) entered into an agreement pursuant to which, subject to satisfying certain conditions and subject to obtaining required government approvals, the parties agreed to convey to AEC Ecuador in the future legal title to a 40% interest in the Block 15 Participation Contract [\u2026].\n\n380.\n\nThe Tribunal reiterates its conclusion. As the Tribunal's analysis of the Farmout Agreements earlier in this Award has demonstrated, the Claimants' interpretation of the Farmout Agreement was wrong. However, the Tribunal does not consider, as the Respondent has argued, that it was made in bad faith. The Claimants' failure to seek ministerial authorization was a mistake, a serious mistake, but it was not done in bad faith. Should Paul MacInnes and his colleagues, during their visit with Minister Ter\u00e1n on 24 October 2000, have given him a copy of the Farmout Agreement and the Joint Operating Agreement so that his advisors could have formed their own opinion about the true nature of the transaction? As stated earlier, the Tribunal has no hesitation in answering its own question in the affirmative. OEPC and AEC were negligent in not doing so. But again, the Tribunal does not find that failure to do so amounted to bad faith. They may have been negligent but there was no intention on their part to mislead. They were simply convinced that they were right and acted accordingly without seeking to mislead the Ecuadorian government. In a number of instances, in the fall of 2000, they revealed publicly in Ecuador that they had entered into a farmout transaction with AEC. When they realized that their behaviour, and in particular the last paragraph of their 25 October letter, created confusion within the Ministry, they tried to dissipate that confusion. Unfortunately, the confusion persisted until the spring of 2004 when officials of the Respondent sighted and analysed the Farmout Agreements.\n\n381.\n\nIn conclusion, the Tribunal finds, based on the above, that OEPC, by failing to secure the required ministerial authorization, breached Clause 16.1 of the Participation Contract and was guilty of an actionable violation of Article 74.11 of the HCL.\n\n382.\n\nThe Tribunal will now address the Claimants' allegation that the sanction imposed by the Respondent for the failure to secure the required authorization for the transfer of rights under the Participation Contract, namely the *Caducidad* Decree, was inconsistent with the Treaty (Article II.3(a) and Article III.1) and Ecuadorian law because it was, in the circumstances, manifestly disproportionate.\n\n383.\n\nHowever, before turning to the proportionality of the *Caducidad* Decree, the Tribunal recalls that the Claimants have also alleged that the *Caducidad* Decree was inconsistent with the Treaty and Ecuadorian law because, *inter alia*, it frustrated their legitimate expectations in the circumstances. Having concluded above that OEPC's failure to secure the required authorization on the part of the Ecuadorian authorities in October 2000, while not amounting to bad faith, was negligent, the Tribunal considers that the Claimants cannot be found to have had a legitimate expectation that the Minister would not exercise his discretion and impose *caducidad*. The failure to secure the required authorization meant that OEPC breached Clause 16.1 of the Participation Contract and was guilty of an actionable violation of Article 74.11 of the HCL which, as one option, expressly allowed the Minister to declare the *caducidad* of the Participation Contract and the Joint Operating Agreements. For this reason, the Claimants' allegation that the *Caducidad* Decree frustrated their legitimate expectations is rejected.\n\n***3. The Proportionality of the Sanction for the Unauthorized Transfer of Rights*** ***under the Participation Contract***\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n***(a) Preliminary Observations***\n----------------------------------\n\n384.\n\nThe Tribunal has found that the Farmout Agreement and the Joint Operating Agreement operated to effect a transfer of rights under the Participation Contract from OEPC to AEC. The Tribunal has also found that this transfer required authorization on the part of the Ecuadorian authorities, that this authorization was not sought, but that OEPC's failure to secure such authorization in October 2000, while imprudent and ill advised, did not amount to bad faith.\n\n385.\n\nThe Tribunal recalls that the issue of the transfer of rights under the Participation Contract by OEPC to AEC resurfaced in 2004 in the context of what has been referred to as the Moores Rowland audit, described in some detail earlier in this Award. Ultimately, Moores Rowland issued its audit report on 14 July 2004, noting therein that the assignment of rights and obligations contemplated in the Farmout was made contingent on future events and that the assignment \"might or might not happen\" at the end of the four years during which the conditions were to be satisfied. The audit report recommended to the DNH that OEPC seek government authorization for the assignment during that year, assuming the assignment conditions were satisfied, and that the required ministerial approval be granted to OEPC in order to properly register the assignment.\n\n386.\n\nAs also recalled earlier in this Award, AEC had in fact made all payments due under the Farmout a few months earlier in February 2004. The day after Moores Rowland issued its audit report, on 15 July 2004, OEPC wrote to the then-Minister of Energy and Mines, Eduardo L\u00f3pez Robayo, \"request[ing] the Ministry to approve the transfer by OEPC to AEC Ecuador of legal title to a 40% interest\" in Block 15, as contemplated under the Farmout. In making this request, OEPC referred to its letter of 25 October 2000, as well as Minister Ter\u00e1n's response of 17 January 2001.\n\n387.\n\nThe approval sought by OEPC was never granted and ultimately, following *caducidad* proceedings, the Attorney General of Ecuador issued orders to the Ministry of Mines and Energy to terminate the Participation Contract and the Unitized Fields Joint Operating Agreements through a declaration of *caducidad*. On 15 May 2006, the *Caducidad* Decree officially terminated, with immediate effect, OEPC's Participation Contract and ordered OEPC to turn over all its assets relating to Block 15. The purpose of the following Section is to examine the proportionality of this sanction imposed by the Respondent.\n\n***(b) The Parties' Competing Cases21***\n----------------------------------------\n\nAlthough reviewed earlier in this Award, the Tribunal considers it necessary, in this section, to summarize the key arguments of the parties with respect to the proportionality issue.\n\n388.\n\nThe Claimants have submitted that even if any of the alleged Termination Events had occurred, the Respondent would still have breached its obligations under the Treaty and the Participation Contract by imposing a sanction which in the circumstances was manifestly disproportionate. As to the Treaty, reliance was placed on Article II.3(a) which obliges Ecuador *inter alia* to accord investments fair and equitable treatment. There are several aspects to this argument as set out below.\n\n389.\n\nThe Claimants have contended that it was of critical importance that the Minister's authority to declare *caducidad* was discretionary in nature. The Claimants have further contended that in exercising such discretion the Minister must adopt a proportionate approach, as a matter of Ecuadorian law and under the Treaty.\n\n390.\n\nThe Claimants emphasized that the *Caducidad* Decree was expressly based on contravention of the HCL (specifically Article 74) and not on breach of the Participation Contract. Accordingly, it was an administrative act based on legislative powers, rather than a private act grounded in private contractual rights. Under Ecuadorian law, a Minister exercising such powers is bound to act in a proportionate manner.\n\n391.\n\nThe Claimants further submitted that the *Caducidad* Decree was not justified by any or any sufficient interest in public welfare. The Decree did not specify any public welfare factors that it was seeking to protect. To the contrary, it was the Claimants' contention that the Respondent was intent on expelling OEPC from the country in retaliation for the VAT Award and/or for other reasons of political expediency.\n\n392.\n\nThe alleged absence of any justifying policy reasons associated with public welfare was reflected in the contention that the Farmout Agreement caused no harm or damage to the Respondent. It was further supported by the contention that the Farmout Agreement did not violate the policy rationale of the HCL's prohibition on the unauthorized assignment of rights (Article 74). Insofar as that latter point was concerned, the Claimants relied on the fact that the Respondent had already scrutinized AEC in relation to other blocks in Ecuador, and found it to be a suitable and solvent contractor.\n\n393.\n\nCountering the proportionality argument, the Respondent argued that the question of proportionality does not arise in circumstances where the sanction imposed was one specifically agreed upon by the parties in their contract. OEPC having agreed that *caducidad* could be ordered in certain identified circumstances, there could be no objection when *caducidad* was in fact ordered in precisely such circumstances.\n\n394.\n\nOn the question of discretion, the Respondent disputed that there was a true discretion in this case. Such choice as existed, it said, was either a choice to order *caducidad* or to do nothing. The latter, from the point of view of a State in the Respondent's position, was not a realistic or appropriate option.\n\n395.\n\nFurther, the Respondent argued that in any event the sanction of *caducidad* was indeed a proportionate response to the Farmout Agreement and the breaches of the Participation Contract which it says were committed by OEPC. The Respondent emphasized the national importance of the oil fields in question, and the right of the Ecuadorian Government to strictly control and administer the activities of all parties operating in those fields.\n\n***(c) Proportionality in Ecuadorian law***\n-------------------------------------------\n\n396.\n\nClause 22.1 of the Participation Contract provides that the contract is to be governed exclusively by Ecuadorian law.\n\n397.\n\nThe expert evidence for the Claimants (and on this general point there was no challenge from the Respondent) was that the principle of proportionality applies generally in Ecuadorian law. In Ecuador, the principle originates in the Constitution, Article 24 of which provides:\n\nArt. 24. In order to ensure due process, the following basic guarantees must be observed, without prejudice to any others established by the Constitution, international instruments, laws, or precedent:\n\n[...]\n\n3. Laws shall establish due proportionality between offences and penalties. The law shall also determine penalties other than those involving the deprivation of liberty, depending on the nature of each case, the character of the offender, and the convict's reintegration into society.\n\n398.\n\nAt first blush, that provision would appear to be directed toward criminal rather than commercial or administrative matters, but the evidence is that Article 24 of the Ecuadorian Constitution is of wide application. In his original brief, the Claimants' expert on Ecuadorian law, Dr. P\u00e9rez Loose22, explained that the Government is under a duty to apply the principle whenever there is conflict between the Constitution and an inferior law, such as the HCL.23 It was Dr. P\u00e9rez Loose's evidence that the Government must weigh the content and purpose of any sanctioning measure with the conduct which has been impugned, and with the loss of rights which the individual will suffer by reason of the intended sanction.24\n\nThe Tribunal recalls that, late in these proceedings (on 10 November 2011), the Respondent submitted \"that the Tribunal should not give any credibility to the written reports submitted or the oral evidence given by Mr. P\u00e9rez Loose\" because he was acting as counsel with Mr. David Rivkin, the lead counsel for the Claimants in the present case, in a new case against Ecuador. The parties were invited to brief the Tribunal in respect of this matter. Having reviewed these submissions, the Tribunal then formed the view that the credibility of Mr. P\u00e9rez Loose who gave evidence more than a year earlier as an expert witness on behalf of the Claimants in the liability and quantum phases of this arbitration is in no way impacted on account of his acting as counsel with Mr. Rivkin in 2011 in a family related dispute against Ecuador.\n\nExpert Report of Hern\u00e1n P\u00e9rez Loose dated 18 July 2006 at paragraph 107.\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n399.\n\nDr. P\u00e9rez Loose cited the following statement of principle from a decision of Ecuador's Supreme Court of Justice, which specifically addresses clause 3 of Article 24 of the Constitution:\n\nWith [the] principle of proportionality of the penalties as a basis, all democratic legal orders state that the measures or sanctions adopted within any legal or administrative proceeding must be proportional with the facts or acts established as violations. In this way, administrative responsibility is graduated in accordance with the fault committed and is not only a punitive action, through the coercion of the sanction, but also preventive, because knowing the consequence of the probable deviation, it reduces the possibility of other officials committing breaches. In this sense, the mentioned principle of proportionality constitutes a requirement for the Government, since to establish a sanction between the two limits, minimum and maximum, it must consider the factual situation beforehand and attend to the end sought by the rule [\u2026].25 (Emphasis added)\n\nAs quoted in the Expert Report of Hern\u00e1n P\u00e9rez Loose dated 18 July 2006 at paragraph 108.\n\n400.\n\nDr. P\u00e9rez Loose explained that the wider application of the constitutional principle of proportionality is further confirmed in the Regulation for the Control of Discretion in Acts of Public Administration (Decree No. 3179 dated 19 October 2002).26 The relevant provisions of that Regulation, of which Article 11 is the most important for present purposes, are as follows:\n\nArt. 2 - ON DISCRETIONARY ACTS. The discretion envisaged by law, implies choosing one among many equally valid options [\u2026]\n\n[\u2026]\n\nArt. 4 - RATIONALE. Under the terms of the Constitution and these regulations, the government is required to provide the rationale for its decision regarding these administrative actions.\n\n[\u2026]\n\nArt 6. - PROHIBITION OF ARBITRARY NATURE. The monitoring to be done must be carried out based on the principle of prohibition of arbitrary nature. This includes the most generic features, which are those that appear to be the most suitable for the task to be carried out. It is not sufficient for the rationale to be based on premises, but rather that the premises must be true.\n\n[\u2026]\n\nArt. 11 - PROPORTIONALITY. The measures involved in the discretionary action must be proportionally suitable to the goal.\n\nExpert Report of Hern\u00e1n P\u00e9rez Loose dated 18 July 2006 at paragraph 107.\n\n401.\n\nFor the Respondent, Dr. Aguilar accepted that the principle of proportionality was an established feature of Ecuadorian law.27 During cross-examination, Dr. Aguilar also accepted the applicability of the principle of proportionality in fact situations such as the present one, where an administrative sanction is imposed following a violation of relevant domestic law:\n\nQ. To be clear, if a violation has caused no economic damage, then [the] administration would have to take that into account in its proportionality determination; is that right?\n\nA. This, yes, but also how the violation has affected the integrity of the legal system.28\n\nExpert Report of Juan Pablo Aguilar Andrade dated 19 September 2008 at paragraphs 77-78.\n\nHearing Transcript (19 December 2008) at page 1582.\n\n***(d) Proportionality in the Context of International Investment Disputes***\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n402.\n\nThe application of the principle of proportionality may be observed in a variety of international law settings, including cases in which the proportionality of countermeasures taken in trade disputes is challenged before a WTO Panel under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (\"GATT\").\n\n403.\n\nOn the application of proportionality generally in the context of administrative action, the most developed body of jurisprudence is in Europe. It is very well-established law in a number of European countries that there is a principle of proportionality which requires that administrative measures must not be any more drastic than is necessary for achieving the desired end. The principle has been adopted and applied countless times by the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg, and by the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg.\n\n404.\n\nAgainst that background, the Tribunal observes that there is a growing body of arbitral law, particularly in the context of ICSID arbitrations, which holds that the principle of proportionality is applicable to potential breaches of bilateral investment treaty obligations. In the present case, the Treaty provides at Article II.3(a) that investments shall at all times be accorded fair and equitable treatment, shall enjoy full protection and security and shall in no case be accorded treatment less than that required by international law. The obligation for fair and equitable treatment has on several occasions been interpreted to import an obligation of proportionality. Cases cited by the Claimants include:\n\n\u2022 *MTD Equity SDN.BHD. and other v. The Republic of Chile,* ICSID Case No. ARB/01/7 (25 May 2004);\n\n\u2022 *LG&E Energy Corp. and others v. The Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/02/1 (3 October 2006);\n\n\u2022 *Tecmed S.A. v. The United Mexican States*, ICSID Case No. ARB (AF)/00/2 (29 May 2003); and\n\n\u2022 *Azurix Corp. v. The Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/01/12 (14 July 2006).\n\n405.\n\nIn *MTD Equity*, discussing the meaning of \"fair and equitable treatment\", the tribunal noted (at paragraph 109):\n\nThe parties agree that there is an obligation to treat investments fairly and equitably. The parties also agree with the statement of Judge Schwebel29 that \"the meaning of what is fair and equitable is defined when that standard is applied to a set of specific facts.\" As defined by Judge Schwebel, \"fair and equitable treatment\" is \"a broad and widely-accepted standard encompassing such fundamental standards as good faith, due process, non-discrimination, and proportionality.\"\n\nCalled as an expert witness by the Claimants in that proceeding.\n\n406.\n\nThe earlier *Tecmed* case involved such a proportionality approach, and was particularly relied upon by the Claimants. In *Tecmed*, the claimant had committed some licensing infringements in operating a landfill in Mexico. Certain community groups became opposed to the operation and existence of the landfill, which dealt with hazardous waste, and when Tecmed applied for renewal of its licence in 1998, the relevant government body refused to renew the licence, citing the infringements. The tribunal stated as follows (at paragraph 122):\n\nAfter establishing that regulatory actions and measures will not be initially excluded from the definition of expropriatory acts, in addition to the negative financial impact of such actions or measures, the Arbitral Tribunal will consider, in order to determine if they are to be characterised as expropriatory, whether such actions or measures are proportional to the public interest presumably protected thereby and to the protection legally granted to investments, taking into account that the significance of such impact has a key role upon deciding the proportionality.\n\n[...]\n\nThere must be a reasonable relationship of proportionality between the charge or weight imposed to the foreign investor and the aim sought to be realized by any expropriatory measure.30\n\nIn support of the various propositions set forth in paragraph 122 of the *Tecmed* award, the tribunal cited several decisions of the European Court of Human Rights.\n\n407.\n\nThe *Tecmed* tribunal concluded that the responsible regulatory agency was predominantly influenced and/or motivated by socio-political factors beyond the licence violations (concerning storage of impermissible types of waste, or storage of excess waste) which had been alleged against Tecmed. The tribunal held that the manner of operation of the landfill never compromised the ecological balance, the protection of the environment or the health of local people (as alleged by certain pressure groups), and that all the infringements committed were either remediable or remediated or subject to minor penalties. Although the licence and applicable regulations *prima facie* permitted a refusal to renew the license in the case of such violations, the tribunal held (at paragraph 149):\n\n[I]t would be excessively formalistic, in light of the above considerations, the [BIT] and international law, to understand that the Resolution is proportional to such violations when such infringements do not pose a present or imminent risk to the ecological balance or to people's health, and the Resolution, without providing for the payment of compensation [\u2026] leads to the neutralization of the investment's economic and business value and the Claimant's return on investment and profitability expectations upon making the investment.\n\n408.\n\nIn discussing the European jurisprudence concerning review of decisions affecting human rights, the *Tecmed* tribunal noted that such statements of the Strasbourg Court also apply to the actions of the State in its capacity as administrator, and not only in its capacity as legislator. The application of proportionality to an act of administration (as opposed to the promulgation of legislation or regulations) was what was at issue in *Tecmed*, and it is similarly at issue in the present case.\n\n409.\n\nFollowing *Tecmed*, a subsequent ICSID tribunal in *Azurix* considered the issue of proportionality in the context of measures taken supposedly for a public purpose. The *Azurix* tribunal endorsed the reliance in *Tecmed* on case law from the European Court of Human Rights - in particular the case of *James and Others31* - and placed particular emphasis on the need for proportionality between the means employed and the aim sought to be realized. It is worth noting that this is the same principle which finds expression in Article 11 of the Ecuadorian Regulation for the Control of Discretion in the Acts of Public Administration.\n\n*In the Case of James and Others*, Judgment of 21 February 1986 (http://hudoc.echr.coe.int).\n\n***(e) Detailed Arguments regarding Proportionality***\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n410.\n\nThe essence of the Respondent's position was that *caducidad* was *per se* appropriate and proportionate, mainly for the reason that it is specifically identified in the Participation Contract and in the HCL as the appropriate sanction in the case of an unauthorized transfer of rights.\n\n411.\n\nWhile acknowledging that Article 74 of the HCL provides that the Minister \"may\" declare *caducidad*, the Respondent drew attention to a subsequent regulation being Decree No. 1363 dated 27 March 2001 (entitled \"Regulation for the Transfer or Assignment of Rights and Obligations of Hydrocarbon Agreements\"), Article 14 of which provides that \"[t]he execution of private contracts or agreements that breach the provisions of the [HCL] and of these regulations shall give rise to the declaration of *caducidad* in the manner established by the Hydrocarbons Law.\" (Emphasis added) This is an unconvincing point - the regulation is subsidiary legislation and still only refers to a process to be followed in accordance with the main legislation. The purpose of the provision appears to be to provide that breach of the regulation is also to qualify as an act which triggers Article 74 of the HCL (perhaps to distinguish it from other regulations, which would require repeated breach to fall within the scope of Article 74.13). However, there is nothing in this regulation tending to support a conclusion that the introductory words of Article 74 in the main legislation (\"may declare\") have been rewritten to remove all discretion of the Minister.\n\n412.\n\nThe Respondent submitted in its Counter-Memorial on Liability that even if the declaration of *caducidad* is discretionary, it could not offend the principle of proportionality to impose a sanction which was expressly authorized and called for in both the Participation Contract and the relevant legislation.\n\n413.\n\nThe principle of proportionality received more developed argument later in the proceedings. Focus shifted to the question of whether the declaration was made pursuant to the Participation Contract or the legislation, whether the Minister did or did not have a discretion in the matter, and whether (considered objectively) the sanction was a proportionate response to the breaches by OEPC.\n\n414.\n\nIn its Rejoinder on Liability, the Respondent challenged the Claimants' proportionality argument on three grounds as follows:\n\n(i) The various ICSID authorities cited by the Claimants were distinguishable from the present case because none of those other disputes involved a contract which expressly provided for the sanction in question. In circumstances where the Claimants had freely agreed that the Participation Contract \"shall terminate\" in the event of an unauthorized transfer of rights and obligations, the Respondent argued that the sanction of *caducidad* could not be challenged as disproportionate or otherwise unreasonable;\n\n(ii) Second, the Respondent also argued that as a matter of fact, the sanction was not disproportionate. Although accepting that AEC had previously been authorized to carry out similar operations in a different block, the Respondent criticized OEPC's actions as having nonetheless deprived the Respondent of the opportunity to exercise its regulatory prerogative. That was a serious violation which warranted and required a serious response by way of punishment and deterrent; and\n\n(iii) Third, the Respondent argued that even if the Minister had discretion to impose a lesser sanction, as a practical matter he could not because it would have created a precedent making it impossible ever to apply the full sanction in the future. Any subsequent declaration of *caducidad* against a different contractor in similar circumstances would, it was said, by met with claims of discrimination.\n\n415.\n\nAs a separate point, the Respondent rejected the Claimants' position that it was relevant to the issue of proportionality to inquire into whether or not the Respondent had suffered harm or damage from OEPC's conduct. Apart from asserting that Ecuador did indeed suffer damage, the Respondent's main response on this point was to submit that \"no State is ever obliged to demonstrate harm to itself as a precondition to enforcing its own laws\".\n\n416.\n\nAs to this latter point, the Tribunal considers that the Respondent failed to properly appreciate the Claimants' argument. The argument is not that the State must prove harm, but that any penalty the State chooses to impose must bear a proportionate relationship to the violation which is being addressed and its consequences. This is neither more nor less than what is encapsulated in the Respondent's own constitutional rules about proportionality. In cases where the administration wishes to impose a severe penalty, then it appears to the Tribunal that the State must be able to demonstrate (i) that sufficiently serious harm was caused by the offender; and/or (ii) that there had been a flagrant or persistent breach of the relevant contract/law, sufficient to warrant the sanction imposed; and/or (iii) that for reasons of deterrence and good governance it is appropriate that a significant penalty be imposed, even though the harm suffered in the particular instance may not have been serious. The potential justification predicated on deterrence explains why, for example, it may be proportionate to give a heavy fine for speeding32 even where no accident occurred and where, plainly, the State suffered no direct \"harm\" from the driver's breach of the law. The potential for harm, and the need to deter others from acting in the same way, justifies the imposition of a penalty even though no identifiable harm was caused in the particular instance.\n\nTo use the example selected by the Respondent.\n\n417.\n\nThe test at the end of the day will remain one of overall judgment, balancing the interests of the State against those of the individual, to assess whether the particular sanction is a proportionate response in the particular circumstances. Accordingly, while it is possible to envisage many instances where punishment is imposed for violations which have not directly caused harm, it is immediately apparent that such punishments tend to be at the lower end of the scale - they are intended to educate and deter both the offender and the general populace. But more serious punishments are still usually reserved for instances where true harm has been suffered. And typically, the more serious the harm then the more serious the punishment. This is a familiar principle in all legal systems and, in this particular case, one need only look to Article 77 of the HCL which expressly refers to the \"seriousness of the violation\" as follows: \"A breach of contract that does not cause *caducidad* effects or violation of the Law or Regulations shall be punished with a fine [...] depending on the seriousness of the violation, in addition to compensation for the damages caused.\" (Emphasis added)\n\n418.\n\nTo return to the Respondent's three arguments identified above, the Tribunal does not accept the submission that the ICSID authorities relied upon by the Claimants can be distinguished because of the absence of a contractual provision comparable to that found in Clause 21 of the Participation Contract. As noted earlier, the *Caducidad* Decree was not predicated upon breach of contract, but was instead issued pursuant to, and in reliance upon, alleged breaches of Article 74 of the HCL. This is a point of general importance given that the Respondent consistently advanced the plea that *caducidad* could not be a breach of the Treaty when it was a penalty freely agreed to by OEPC. Accordingly, it is an issue which deserves careful analysis.\n\n419.\n\nThere is no dispute that the *Caducidad* Decree refers only to Article 74 of the HCL. That in itself might not be the end of the matter if the termination provisions of the Participation Contract were identical as in the HCL, but they are not. Article 74.11 of the HCL empowers the Minister to declare *caducidad* if the contractor \"transfers rights or enters into a private contract or agreement for the assignment of one or more of its rights, without the Ministry's authorization.\" The Tribunal notes that the reference is to transfer of rights only. By contrast, Clause 21.1.2 of the Participation Contract refers to an unauthorized transfer of \"rights and obligations.\"\n\n420.\n\nThere was no suggestion by the Respondent that the \"earn-in\" stage of the Farmout Agreement somehow effected a transfer to AEC of OEPC's obligations under the Participation Contract. The fact is that the only party who ever owed obligations to PetroEcuador, and the only party against whom PetroEcuador might plausibly have sought to enforce obligations owed under the Participation Contract, was OEPC. It is presumably for that that reason that the Respondent sought to proceed under the HCL rather than the Participation Contract.33\n\nThe *Caducidad* Decree specifically refers (in relation to Article 74.11) only to the transfer of rights, and the execution of a contract or private agreement for the assignment of one or more rights.\n\n421.\n\nNor is the position changed by reason of the fact that OEPC agreed that the contract \"shall terminate\" in the event of \"a declaration of forfeiture issued by the Corresponding Ministry for the causes and following the procedure established in Article 74... of the [HCL]..,\"34 The reference to a declaration of *caducidad* under the HCL can only mean a declaration properly made - the contractor cannot be taken to have agreed to accept termination in circumstances where the decree is issued contrary to the requirement of proportionality in Ecuadorian law.\n\nClauses 21.1. and 21.1.1 of the Participation Contract.\n\n422.\n\nThe fact that a contractor agrees that *caducidad* may be a remedy in certain situations does not mean that the contractor has waived its right to have such a remedy imposed proportionately, or otherwise imposed in accordance with all relevant laws. That is particularly so when, as in the present case, the parties agree that the contract is to be governed by a system of law (Ecuadorian law) which expressly requires the principle of proportionality to be observed. There is nothing in the Participation Contract to indicate an intention to \"contract out\" of proportionality or any other legal principles of general application.35\n\nIn any event, it must be doubtful whether parties could actually contract out of a principle of such central importance that it is included in the Ecuadorian Constitution.\n\n423.\n\nIn any event, whatever OEPC agreed in the Participation Contract is only relevant to actions taken under or pursuant to the contract - it cannot be relevant to action which is taken independently of the contract and which does not proceed in reliance upon it. It is a matter of central importance in this case that the *Caducidad* Decree was issued pursuant to the provisions of the HCL. In those circumstances, there cannot be any doubt that OEPC remained entitled to the full protection of Ecuadorian law, both procedural and substantive, which would ordinarily apply to such actions regardless of what may or may not have been agreed in the underlying contract.\n\n***(f) Common Ground between the Parties***\n-------------------------------------------\n\n424.\n\nDuring the Hearing on Liability, it was eventually a matter of common ground between the parties that in issuing the *Caducidad* Decree, the Minister was exercising discretion. That is to say, the Minister was not obliged to terminate the Participation Contract. In particular, this was accepted by Minister Ter\u00e1n in cross-examination when he acknowledged that the power to declare *caducidad* was \"optional, absolutely\".36 Similarly, the Respondent's expert, Dr. Aguilar, acknowledged during cross-examination that \"[the Minister] would have the discretion over the decision as to whether to declare Caducidad.\"37\n\nHearing Transcript (17 December 2008) at page 1582.\n\nHearing Transcript (19 December 2008) at pages 1553-1554.\n\n425.\n\nIt was also common ground between the parties that, where the Minister has a discretion, the principle of proportionality is relevant.38 The Respondent's arguments were ultimately directed to persuading the Tribunal that proportionality was satisfied in this case - either because proportionality was to be effectively \"presumed\" as a result of the sanction itself being included in the Participation Contract as just discussed above, or because of the actions of OEPC upon which the *Caducidad* Decree was predicated.\n\nHearing Transcript (21 March 2009) at page 76, lines 16-21 and Claimants' Post-Hearing Brief on Liability, paragraphs 155-158.\n\n***(g) Outstanding Issues***\n----------------------------\n\n426.\n\nAccordingly, the issues that eventually emerged by the time of the parties' posthearing submissions as being central to the question of proportionality were: (i) whether the Minister in fact had available to him some meaningful alternative short of declaring *caducidad* ; and/or (ii) whether in any event the sanction of *caducidad* was in this instance a proportionate response to the violation of Article 74 of the HCL committed by OEPC.\n\n427.\n\nIssue (ii) arises even if the answer to (i) is in the negative. To conclude otherwise would be tantamount to finding that the HCL operates indifferently and would not give due effect and recognition to the principle of proportionality. The Tribunal understands that such a principle, established in the Constitution and reiterated in subsequent legislation, would take precedence over the HCL.39 Even if the Tribunal is wrong on that question of domestic Ecuadorian law, the Tribunal has no doubt that the principle of proportionality is applicable as a matter of general international law, and has been applied in many ICSID arbitrations in the past.\n\nExpert Report of Hern\u00e1n P\u00e9rez Loose dated 18 July 2006 at paragraph 107.\n\n***(h) Alternatives to Caducidad***\n-----------------------------------\n\n428.\n\nThe Respondent submits that notwithstanding the acknowledgement of the Minister's discretion, there really was no option except to terminate. At the very most, the only other option which could be said to exist was simply to do nothing.\n\n429.\n\nThe first difficulty with this argument for the Respondent is evident from its own counterclaim. One of the heads of counterclaim is a claim for damages arising from the failure of OEPC to pay the required transfer fee in or around October 2000, and to negotiate a new participation contract on terms more favourable to the Respondent. The basis for this claim is Article 79 of the HCL which provides in its second paragraph that:\n\nThe State shall receive a premium for the transfer and the beneficiary company shall enter into a new contract under more favourable economic conditions for the State and for PETROECUADOR that the ones contained in the original contract.\n\n430.\n\nThe Respondent (through Minister Ter\u00e1n) acknowledged that there have been instances where, in addition to the transfer fee, the Government sought improvements to the economic terms of the contract40. As for the transfer fee, which in accordance with Decree No. 2713 is based on the previous year's profits resulting from the underlying contract, the evidence was that if OEPC had sought consent to transfer in October 2000, and if consent had been granted, the transfer fee would have been in the order of $1.1 million based on OEPC's net income of $21.7 million in 1999. Furthermore, the evidence was that by 2006, with extraction having increased in the intervening six years, the transfer fee would have been tenfold, *i.e.* in the order of $11.8 million, based on OEPC's net income of $289.2 million in 2003.41\n\nSecond Witness Statement of Pablo Ter\u00e1n, paragraph 6. See also Hearing Transcript (17 December 2008) at page 1154, lines 10-20.\n\nSee also Regulation 1363, although this only sets a minimum figure for the transfer.\n\n431.\n\nIf the Respondent considers it is entitled not only to terminate the Participation Contract but also to claim by way of damages the fees which were potentially payable as at the date the Farmout Agreement was made, then the Respondent could have likewise pursued those fees at the same time as choosing not to terminate the Participation Contract. Indeed, the logic for the latter approach would seem stronger given that OEPC would presumably receive the benefit of the Farmout Agreement continuing.42\n\nThe Tribunal notes that if, in 2006, the Respondent had decided not to declare *caducidad*, then under Article 79 of the HCL, the purported assignment of rights by the Farmout Agreement would still have been null and void under Ecuadorian law. It would have been null and void *ab initio*, but that would be a problem for OEPC and AEC, and not a matter of concern for the Respondent. The first paragraph of Article 79 provides: \"The transfer of a contract or the assignment to third parties of rights from a contract shall be null and void and shall have no validity whatsoever if there is no prior authorization from the Ministry of Energy and Mines, without prejudice to the declaration of *caducidad* as provided for in this Law.\"\n\n432.\n\nA second difficulty with the argument that there was no option except to terminate is that there was a further option available to the Respondent, short of declaring *caducidad*, namely a variation on the provision (Article 79) requiring the contractor to enter into a new contract with more favourable terms for the Respondent. That option would have involved a negotiated settlement, which had the potential to reflect and address all concerns which the Respondent may have as a result of the breach of contract which occurred. Such a settlement might include any one or more of the following features: (i) a transfer fee; (ii) a sum by way of compensation for any damage suffered; (iii) varied terms for the Participation Contract, presumably aimed at improving the contract for the Respondent by addressing the impact of the VAT Interpretative Law and Law 42; and/or (iv) penalty sums payable by OEPC whether based on Article 79 of the HCL or by agreement at some higher level (if so agreed).\n\n433.\n\nIn the present case the Attorney General has acknowledged that it was legal to settle the case.43 Paragraph 15 of the *Caducidad* Decree records that OEPC's efforts to settle with the Respondent were finally rejected only on 15 May 2006. The fact that settlement was being considered shows the Minister had a discretion not to declare *caducidad*, and further a discretion to negotiate what the appropriate sanction (the \"settlement\") might be.\n\nLetter from the Attorney General to PetroEcuador dated 4 May 2006, advising that \"a compromise and settlement is proper because it is so permitted by law\".\n\n434.\n\nIn summary, the Tribunal considers that the foregoing options existed as an alternative to *caducidad*44, namely:\n\ni) insistence on payment of a transfer fee in the order of USD 11.8 million; and/or\n\nii) improvements to the economic terms of the original contract; and/or\n\niii) a negotiated settlement which could of course have covered any areas that the parties so desired, including payment of the transfer fee which had been avoided, renegotiation of the contract and additional compensation.\n\nSuch an alternative does not arise from Article 77 of the HCL which provides as follows: \"A breach of contract that does not cause *caducidad* effects or a violation of the Law or Regulations shall be punished with a fine imposed by the National Hydrocarbons Director, of two hundred to three thousand United States Dollars, depending on the seriousness of the violation, in addition to compensation for the damages caused.\" This provision is not relevant to the Tribunal's analysis regarding alternatives to *caducidad* since its operation is confined to instances of breach of the Participation Contract which do not cause *caducidad* effects nor a violation of the Law or Regulations.\n\n435.\n\nThe final option was to have done nothing except perhaps issue a statement making it plain to all foreign oil companies that all transfers of economic interests must be authorized and that if not so authorized *caducidad* proceedings would be inevitable. No doubt this option was viewed by the Respondent as unpalatable and unrealistic, but as a matter of logic such an option did exist. Article 74 of the HCL is empowering only, and not directive.\n\n436.\n\nFor these reasons, the Tribunal finds that the Respondent's argument that there was really no option but to terminate is unsound and it is not accepted.\n\n***(i) The Background to the Caducidad Decree***\n------------------------------------------------\n\n437.\n\nAs indicated earlier, the Tribunal has found that Article 74 of the HCL was violated. Specifically, the Tribunal has concluded that the better interpretation of the Farmout Agreement and the Joint Operating Agreement is that they constituted an unauthorized transfer of certain of OEPC's rights under the Participation Contract. Because of the absence of authorization, such transfer was a breach of the Participation Contract and a violation of Article 74 of the HCL.\n\n438.\n\nThe background to the *Caducidad* Decree has been referred to at length previously in this Award and need not be repeated *in extenso* here. It suffices to note that:\n\n(a) OEPC publicly announced the Farmout Agreement on 1 November 2000;\n\n(b) By inter-departmental memorandum within the Ministry of Energy, it was noted on 8 November 2000 that AEC was already party to a participation contract for other fields and was the operator of those fields, that it had demonstrated technical solvency, and that there would be \"no impediment for [the] assignment of rights [in OEPC's Participation Contract];\"\n\n(c) Nearly four years passed, until early 2004 (the Moores Rowland audit) during which time the Participation Contract proceeded without any major incident, and all payments due under it to PetroEcuador were madeby OEPC;\n\n(d) During those four years, the Claimants also committed substantial further investment to the OCP pipeline, and purchased a certain amount of capacity on the pipeline through a long-term ship-or-pay commitment;\n\n(e) On 12 July 2004, the VAT Award was sent to the parties;\n\n(f) On 14 July 2004, Moores Rowland issued its audit report, noting that the assignment of rights and obligations contemplated in the Farmout was made contingent on future events and that the assignment \"might or might not happen;\"\n\n(g) On 15 July 2004, OEPC sought approval for the 40% transfer to AEC;\n\n(h) On 24 August 2004, the Attorney General of Ecuador wrote to the Minister of Energy and Mines and requested that he terminate the Participation Contract;\n\n(i) On 18 June 2005, during a major strike and following civil unrest which had persisted for several months, the new Minister of Energy and Mines, Minister Rodr\u00edguez, signed a resolution stating: \"The Minister of Energy and Mines and the President of PetroEcuador, as the competent authorities, commit to undertaking all of the necessary steps for the departure from Ecuador of the companies Occidental and EnCana AEC for having violated the judicial norms of the country\";\n\n(j) By letter dated 2 August 2005, the President of PetroEcuador wrote to the Minister asking him to \"declare the caducity of the Participation Contract [\u2026] according to the provisions set forth in Articles 74, 75, 76 and 79 of the [HCL].\" Responding to the argument of proportionality which had been raised in correspondence by OEPC, the President of PetroEcuador said: \"Although from the year 2000, operations have been executed by OEPC without any quantifiable economic damage resulting from the transfer of its economic interests, nevertheless, their arguments have not disproved the cause for caducity contemplated in numeral 11 of Article 74 of the [HCL].\"\n\n(k) On 10 November 2005, 100 members of Congress petitioned the President of Congress calling for an impeachment trial of Minister Rodriguez if he did not advance the *caducidad* process;\n\n(l) On 26 March 2006, the leader of strikes which had been blocking highways in the north and centre of Ecuador stated that \"if *caducity* of the Occidental contract is declared, we will lift the strike\";\n\n(m) In late April and early May 2006, Minister Rodriguez and PetroEcuador respectively asked the Attorney General whether the law permitted a negotiated settlement with OEPC, and he advised them both that it did;\n\n(n) On 9 May 2006, various social organisations declared that they would demand the impeachment of the President for considering a settlement agreement with OEPC, and of the Attorney General for opining that a settlement was legally permitted;\n\n(o) On 15 May 2006, the *Caducidad* Decree was issued.\n\n439.\n\nThe foregoing recitation of events shows that the question of whether a *caducidad* decree should be issued had become a national political issue, especially after the issuance of the Moores Rowland audit report and the publication of the VAT Award.\n\n***(j) The Influence of the VAT Award***\n----------------------------------------\n\n440.\n\nAs to the influence of the VAT Award and its connection with the eventual declaration of *caducidad*, the Tribunal refers to the following matters in particular:\n\n(a) By March 2004, the Respondent was in possession of (unsigned) true copies of both the Farmout Agreement and the Joint Operating Agreement. However, no action was taken until July 2004, after the VAT Award was published, and after the Respondent received signed copies of the Farmout Agreement and Joint Operating Agreement.\n\n(b) On 15 July 2004, three days after the VAT Award was published and one day after the Moores Rowland audit report was issued, OEPC informed PetroEcuador that the conditions in the Farmout Agreement of October 2000 had been met, and that OEPC was now requesting PetroEcuador to approve the transfer of the 40% interest to AEC. At the same time, OEPC submitted a formal request to the Ministry of Energy and Mines for approval of the transfer in accordance with Article 79 of the HCL.\n\n(c) After meeting with Mr. Ellis of OEPC, Minister L\u00f3pez wrote to him on 17 August saying as follows: \"In order to have all the components to form a decision on your request for authorization, kindly send to the Office as soon as possible a certified copy of the Agreement executed with AEC Ecuador Ltd in the year 2000 and the relevant operating agreement that allowed OXY to continue as operator of Block 15 within the framework of the said transfer agreement.\"\n\n(d) Accordingly, although the possibility of *caducidad* for violation of Article 74.11 of the HCL had been raised in an internal memorandum within the Ministry,45 the Minister appeared to be proceeding with an open mind and wished to review the relevant documentation to address the request for authorization.\n\n(e) However, during August 2004, the Attorney General of Ecuador, Dr. Borja, reacted strongly and publicly to the VAT Award which had ordered Ecuador to pay $75 million to OEPC. Dr. Borja told the media that he was examining OEPC's contract with Ecuador to \"check whether the contractual norms have been strictly complied with.\" The contemporaneous press clippings which were produced in evidence leave no doubt as to the link between the VAT Award and Dr. Borja's sudden interest in reviewing OEPC's performance of its contract, despite many years of apparent satisfaction (on the part of the Respondent) with OEPC's operations within Ecuador.\n\n(f) On 24 August 2004, Dr. Borja wrote to his colleague, Minister L\u00f3pez, an official letter which was released to the press. It referred to the transfer by OEPC to AEC of \"40% interests and obligations from the Participation Contract [...] without having received authorization from the Ministry of Energy and Mines\" and requesting him to \"apply the provisions in the [HCL] and the referred contract, with regards to the causes of caducity of same.\" In making such a request, and in particular in making it public, Dr. Borja on behalf of the Respondent was clearly intending to create a situation whereby the only acceptable political outcome was to find (i) that there had been a relevant violation of the HCL or the Participation Contract, and that (ii) the only appropriate sanction (being a sanction specifically requested by the Attorney General) was to declare *caducidad*.\n\n(g) As well as releasing the letter, a press release of the same date (24 August 2004) announced further that \"in the case of non-compliances by Occidental with the State\" the Attorney General had requested that Minister L\u00f3pez apply the provision of the HCL and the contract regarding *caducidad.*\n\n(h) On 8 September 2004, Minister L\u00f3pez complied with the Attorney General's request and wrote to the CEO of PetroEcuador asking him to commence the process under Clause 21.2 *et seq.* of the Participation Contract.\n\n(i) PetroEcuador in turn wrote to OEPC on 15 September 2004 giving notification of breach of the Participation Contract and inviting OEPC to respond within 10 days, disproving or accepting the breaches alleged. OEPC responded in great detail (a 28-page letter) on 24 September 2004 denying all allegations in PetroEcuador's notice of 15 September 2004. OEPC's letter specifically invoked the principles of \" *actos propios,* \" estoppel, legitimate expectations, and proportionality - and also referred to the four year administrative silence following October 2000 - and concluded by stating that *caducidad* would be unlawful and in breach of the Treaty.\n\n(j) The matter seems to have rested there for nearly six months until the Attorney General became involved once again. On 14 March 2005, he wrote to PetroEcuador in forceful terms requesting that they initiate *caducidad* proceedings. Furthermore, the letter was copied to the President of Ecuador together with the following message: \"I insist that said public official [PetroEcuador's Executive President] should apply the clauses contemplated in the [HCL], its regulations and the contractual clauses, in order to declare caducity of the Participation Contract\n\n(k) The remaining steps in the process have been summarized above. The Tribunal refers again to the resolution (comprising part of some meeting minutes) which was signed on 18 June 2005 by the new Minister of Energy and Mines, Minister Rodriguez, and the Minister of Government, committing to undertaking \"all of the necessary steps for the departure from Ecuador of the [OEPC and AEC] for having violated the judicial norms of the country\". There was also reference in the same set of minutes to the VAT issue in general, the resolution stating that there should be \"a better control of the collection of the Value Added Tax.\"\n\n(l) As noted earlier, there were attempts at settlement and in May 2006 the Attorney General wrote to PetroEcuador advising that a \"compromise and settlement was proper because it is so permitted by law.\"\n\nDr. Zurita, DNH Audits Coordinator, memorandum dated 3 August 2004. The Claimants noted that Dr. Zurita was not called by the Respondent to give evidence.\n\n441.\n\nThat is the relevant background to the matter, and the context in which *caducidad* was ultimately declared.\n\n***(k) Was the Caducidad Decree a Proportionate Response?***\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n442.\n\nBased on the above, it is apparent that the VAT Award had created anger and disappointment in Ecuadorian political circles. It is not appropriate in this Award to discuss the merits or demerits of the VAT Award. It is sufficient to note that it seems to have led to a good deal of ill-feeling against OEPC, as did the discovery that OEPC had transferred rights under the Participation Contract in violation of the laws of Ecuador.\n\n443.\n\nTo the Tribunal, it appears that there were different camps in the Government's decision-making. One camp was proposing to take a hard line and insist upon *caducidad.* Another camp appeared to be seeking an amicable resolution of the dispute. In the end the former succeeded.\n\n444.\n\nTurning then to the question of harm, as noted earlier, it is significant that farmout agreements are very common in the oil and gas industry. In providing his evidence for the Respondent, Minister Ter\u00e1n acknowledged that the Farmout was (or was likely to have been) beneficial to the State: \"[T]he obtainment of additional resources by OEPC to increase its investments in Ecuador seemed to me to be a good idea since it was beneficial to the country.\"46\n\nWitness Statement of Pablo Ter\u00e1n dated 16 June 2006 at paragraph 23 and Hearing Transcript (17 December 2008) at pages 1144-1145.\n\n445.\n\nThe fact that AEC was already an approved operator in Ecuador, and continued to receive further approvals in relation to other projects/fields after signing the Farmout Agreement, means that it is overwhelmingly likely that approval would have been given if authorization had been sought in October 2000. Even if authorization could have been reasonably withheld, it does not follow that the Respondent has suffered a loss. Indeed, as recorded in PetroEcuador's letter of 2 August 2005, the evidence shows that the Respondent did not suffer any quantifiable loss as a direct result of AEC taking an economic interest in Block 15. Furthermore, it is likely that the involvement of AEC with Block 15 actually resulted in increased investment in that Block, and thus increased the return for PetroEcuador under the Participation Contract.\n\n446.\n\nThe rationale for the \"approval\" requirement in Articles 74.11 and 74.12 of the HCL is readily apparent: the Respondent wishes to protect Ecuador's natural resources, and the income it can generate from them, by carefully assessing the technological capability, financial soundness and overall suitability of any party who will have access to and/or a measure of control over those resources. It goes without saying that such is not an unusual or unreasonable precaution to adopt.\n\n447.\n\nBut, having been deprived of the opportunity on this occasion to \"vet\" a potential third party, the question then shifts to whether the loss of that opportunity has actually occasioned any harm. Has the Respondent, without its knowledge, been faced with the fact that the operation of one of its oilfields was entrusted to an unsuitable third party, and if so has there been any harm suffered? The answer to both questions, on the evidence presented to this Tribunal, is clearly no.\n\n448.\n\nThe Claimants submitted that the Farmout Agreement did not offend the rationale for the approval requirement in Article 74 of the HCL. To the extent that the Respondent was deprived of the opportunity at the relevant time to consider the suitability of AEC, then it must be that the Farmout Agreement did offend the rationale for the approval requirement. OEPC circumvented the requirement for approval altogether. Acknowledging that fact, the Tribunal accepts the Respondent's submission that it is not competent for OEPC or any other private party to arrogate to itself the right to oversee and regulate the identity of contractors to be involved with Ecuador's oilfields.\n\n449.\n\nBut that is a different matter from assessing whether the loss of the approval prerogative in a particular instance has caused harm. Certainly it did not cause economic harm in this case. The Respondent answers that point by asserting that OEPC's breach in this case \"threatened the very integrity of Ecuador's hydrocarbons regulatory regime -and it required decisive action from the Ministry sufficient to pose an effective deterrent to future violations.\"\n\n450.\n\nIt can be accepted that some punishment or other step may well have been justified, or at the very least defensible. The options available to the Respondent have been explored above. The Tribunal does not necessarily disagree with the reasoning that the Respondent could justifiably have wished to re-emphasize the importance of adherence to its regulatory regime. But the overriding principle of proportionality requires that any such administrative goal must be balanced against the Claimants' own interests and against the true nature and effect of the conduct being censured. The Tribunal finds that the price paid by the Claimants - total loss of an investment worth many hundreds of millions of dollars - was out of proportion to the wrongdoing alleged against OEPC, and similarly out of proportion to the importance and effectiveness of the \"deterrence message\" which the Respondent might have wished to send to the wider oil and gas community.\n\n451.\n\nRegarding the submission that as a practical matter the Minister could not choose anything but forfeiture, lest future declarations of *caducidad* be met with claims of discrimination, the simple answer to this is that every case turns on its own facts. Despite differences between the parties on the question of the precise circumstances in which other contractors have faced potential proceedings for *caducidad*47, the evidence was that the Ministry of Energy and Mines has on several other occasions chosen not to declare *caducidad* notwithstanding that violations of Article 74 had been alleged. As Lord Steyn has famously noted, when giving his imprimatur to the importation into English law of the principle of proportionality: \"In law, context is everything.\"48\n\nA fact which only serves to emphasize the central importance of the specific facts in any given case.\n\n*R. v. Secretary of State for the Home Department,* ex parte *Daly* [2001] 3 All ER 433 at 447.\n\n452.\n\nIt follows that even if OEPC, as the Tribunal found earlier, breached Clause 16.1 of the Participation Contract and was guilty of an actionable violation of Article 74.11 (or Articles 74.12 or 74.13), the *Caducidad* Decree was not a proportionate response in the particular circumstances, and the Tribunal so finds. The *Caducidad* Decree was accordingly issued in breach of Ecuadorian law, in breach of customary international law, and in violation of the Treaty. As to the latter, the Tribunal expressly finds that the *Caducidad* Decree constituted a failure by the Respondent to honour its Article II.3(a) obligation to accord fair and equitable treatment to the Claimants' investment, and to accord them treatment no less than that required by international law.\n\n***(l) Expropriation in Breach of Article III of the Treaty***\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n453.\n\nThe Claimants have also contended that the *Caducidad* Decree was an unlawful expropriation of the Claimants' investment in violation of Article III.1 of the Treaty, which states:\n\nARTICLE III\n\n1. Investments shall not be expropriated or nationalized either directly or indirectly through measures tantamount to expropriation or nationalization (\"expropriation\") except: for a public purpose; in a non-discriminatory manner; upon payment of prompt, adequate and effective compensation; and in accordance with due process of law and the general principles of treatment provided for in Article II(3). Compensation shall be equivalent to the fair market value of the expropriated investment immediately before the expropriatory action was taken or became known, whichever is earlier; calculated in a freely usable currency on the basis of the prevailing market rate of exchange at that time; be paid without delay; include interest at a commercially reasonable rate from the date of expropriation; be fully realizable; and be freely transferable.\n\n[...]\n\n454.\n\nIn response, the Respondent maintains that it did not expropriate the Claimants' investment because the termination of a contract in accordance with its terms and governing law is not an expropriation, and that the *Caducidad* Decree was a *bone fide* administrative sanction in furtherance of a legitimate regulatory policy.\n\n455.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees with the Claimants. Having found in the previous Section of the present Award that the *Caducidad* Decree was issued in breach of Ecuadorian law, in breach of customary international law and in violation of the Respondent's Article II.3(a) obligation to accord fair and equitable treatment to the Claimants' investment, the Tribunal now has no hesitation in finding that, in the particular circumstances of this case which it has traversed earlier, the taking by the Respondent of the Claimants' investment by means of this administrative sanction was a measure \"tantamount to expropriation\" and thus in breach of Article III.1 of the Treaty. This phrase is found in NAFTA Article 1110 which provides that \"[n]o party shall directly or indirectly. expropriate an investment. or take a measure tantamount to. expropriation.\" In the well-known case of *Metalclad v Mexico49*, in relation to the definition of \"tantamount to expropriation\", the Tribunal said:\n\n\"Thus, expropriation under NAFTA includes not only open, deliberate and acknowledged takings of property, such as outright seizure or formal or obligatory transfer of title in favour of the host State, but also covert or incidental interference with the use of property which has the effect of depriving the owner, in whole or in significant part, of the use or reasonably-to-be-expected economic benefit of property even if not necessarily to the obvious benefit of the host State.\"50\n\n*Metalclad Corporation v. The United Mexican States* (ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/97/1), Award, 30 August 2000.\n\n*Ibid.* paragraph 103 (emphasis added). See also\u00a0*e.g. S.D. Myers v. The Government of Canada,* Partial Award of 13 November 2000 (NAFTA) at paragraphs 280 and 285: \"In general, the term \u2018expropriation' carries with it the connotation of a \u2018taking' by a governmental-type authority of a person's \u2018property' with a view to transferring ownership of that property to another person, usually the authority that exercised its *de jure* or *de facto* power to do the \u2018taking.'\" [\u2026] \"The primary meaning of the word \u2018tantamount' given by the Oxford English Dictionary is \u2018equivalent.' Both words require a tribunal to look at the substance of what has occurred and not only at form. A tribunal should not be deterred by technical or facial (*sic*) considerations from reaching a conclusion that an expropriation or conduct tantamount to an expropriation has occurred. It must look at the real interests involved and the purpose and effect of the government measure.\"\n\n***(m) The Remaining Allegations of Breach under the Treaty and Ecuadorian Law***\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n456.\n\nHaving found that the *Caducidad* Decree was not a proportionate response in the particular circumstances and as such was issued in breach of Ecuadorian law, in breach of customary international law, and in violation of Articles II.3(a) and III.1 of the Treaty, the Tribunal need not address the remaining allegations of breach under the Treaty and Ecuadorian law raised by the Claimants, including the allegations that the *Caducidad* Decree was imposed in a discriminatory manner or that it otherwise denied the Claimants full protection and security. Indeed, even if the Tribunal were to make positive findings in this regard, this would have no impact on the determination of the resulting damages. For the same reason, the Tribunal need not address the Claimants' allegation that the Respondent allowed PetroEcuador and Petroproducci\u00f3n to aid and abet the *Caducidad* Decree in a manner inconsistent with the Treaty or Ecuadorian law.\n\n***VI. QUANTUM***\n-----------------\n\n***A. Introduction***\n---------------------\n\n457.\n\nIn view of its findings on liability, the Tribunal now turns to the determination of the quantum of the Claimants' damages. In this regard, the Tribunal observes that in addition to the applicable standard for valuing the Claimants' losses and other related quantum issues, there are four \"core\" threshold quantum issues that it must first resolve. These issues concern the impact (if any) on the Tribunal's determination of quantum of:\n\n1) The Ecuadorian Law 42;\n\n2) The Ecuadorian VAT Interpretative Law;\n\n3) The Farmout Agreement; and\n\n4) The fault of the Claimants prior to the *Caducidad* Decree.\n\n458.\n\nAll four of these \"core\" quantum issues have been raised by the Respondent in response to the Claimants' contention that compensation for their losses should be equal to the full fair market value of the Participation Contract as of the date of the *Caducidad* Decree, *i.e.* 15 May 2006. As will be seen, the Respondent argues that the quantification of the Claimants' losses must be reduced on account of each one of these four factors, whereas the Claimants reject any suggestion that the damages they seek should be anything less than the full market value of their investment.\n\n459.\n\nThe parties briefed the Tribunal, in writing and orally, at great length about these four issues. The Tribunal will thus, before analyzing each issue, summarize the parties' respective arguments, all of which have been taken into consideration by the Tribunal.\n\n***B. The Respondent's Procedural Objections in connection with Law 42 and the VAT Interpretative Law***\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n460.\n\nThe Respondent contends, as a preliminary matter and in the form of procedural objections that, since the Claimants did not assert any claims based on Law 42 or the VAT Interpretative Law during the liability phase of the arbitration, they are precluded from challenging their lawfulness as a basis for their inapplicability during the quantum phase.\n\n461.\n\nThe Claimants reply that, because the lawfulness of Law 42 or the VAT Interpretative Law only became relevant in the event the Tribunal found the Respondent liable to the Claimants, the time to raise those issues was in the quantum phase, more specifically in their Memorial on Damages, which is precisely what they did.\n\n462.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees with the Claimants. It stands to reason that the Claimants' argument that these two Ecuadorian laws should not be taken into account by the Tribunal for purposes of quantifying their losses becomes pertinent to the Claimants' damages claim only after and in the event the Respondent has been found liable.\n\n463.\n\nThe Tribunal notes, in addition, that the Claimants, in their Memorial on Liability, stated very clearly that these issues would be addressed in their submissions on damages.\n\n464.\n\nAccordingly, these procedural objections on the part of the Respondent are dismissed.\n\n***C. The Ecuadorian Law 42***\n------------------------------\n\n***1. Introduction***\n---------------------\n\n465.\n\nLaw 42, also referred to as the HCL Amendment, was passed by the Ecuadorian Congress on 19 April 2006 and published in the Official Gazette on 25 April 2006. Law 42 added a provision to the HCL titled \"State's Participation in surplus from oil sales prices not agreed upon or not foreseen\". This provision, which became Article 55 of the HCL, states, in relevant part, as follows:\n\nContractor companies that hold participation contracts for the exploration and exploitation of hydrocarbons in effect with the Ecuadorian State in accordance with this Law, without prejudice to the volume of participation crude oil that corresponds to them, when the average actual monthly FOB sales price of Ecuadorian crude oil exceeds the average monthly sales price in effect on the date on which the contract was executed [\u2026] shall recognize a participation in favor of the Ecuadorian State of at least 50% of the extraordinary revenues generated by the difference in prices. For purposes of this article, extraordinary revenues shall be understood to mean the difference in price described above, multiplied by the number of barrels produced.\n\nThe price of crude oil as of the date of contract execution, used as reference to calculate of the difference, shall be adjusted based on the United States' Consumer Price Index published by the Central Bank of Ecuador.51\n\nThe Claimants observe that PetroEcuador determined the monthly average price in effect at the time of the execution of the Participation Contract at $13.66 per barrel, which adjusted for inflation and quality of oil was $16.43 as of June 2006.\n\n466.\n\nOn 13 July 2006, Ecuador issued Decree 1672 implementing Law 42 at the 50% rate.52\n\nThe Tribunal notes that on 4 October 2007, Ecuador issued Decree 662 increasing the State's participation to 99%.\n\n***2. The Impact of Law 42***\n-----------------------------\n\n***(a) The Respondent's Position***\n-----------------------------------\n\n467.\n\nThe Respondent maintains that any valuation of the Claimants' damages should take into account the impact of Law 42 since any valuation of the Claimants' interest in Block 15 would have to reflect the actual situation that a hypothetical purchaser of that interest would have faced in Ecuador on 15 May 2006 after the enactment of Law 42.\n\n468.\n\nIn brief, it is the Respondent's position that Law 42 did not violate the Treaty. More particularly, the Respondent submits that Law 42 is nothing more than a generally-applicable fiscal measure. The Respondent rejects the Claimants' contention that Law 42 improperly modified the legal framework that existed at the time their investment was made. Law 42, says the Respondent, cannot be found to violate the Claimants' legitimate expectations or otherwise deny them fair and equitable treatment and full protection and security. The Respondent further denies that Law 42 imposed a unilateral modification of the Participation Contract in breach thereof and in violation of the Treaty's \"umbrella\" clause, or that it otherwise operated an expropriation of the Claimants' investment.\n\n469.\n\nClause 8.6 of the Participation Contract is central to the Respondent's argument that Law 42 does not modify the Participation Contract. The Tribunal will now cite this clause and other related clauses of the Contract for ease of reference:\n\n***EIGHT: PARTICIPATION AND DELIVERY PROCEDURES.-***\n\n[\u2026]\n\n***8.6 Economic Stability:*** In the event that, due to actions taken by the State of Ecuador or PETROECUADOR, any of the events described below occur and have an impact on the economy of this Participation Contract:\n\n***a.*** Modification of the tax regime as described in clause 11.11.\n\n***b.*** Modification of the regime for remittances abroad or exchange rates, as described in clause 12.1 and 12.3 respectively.\n\n***c.*** Reduction of the production rate, as determined in clause 6.8.3.\n\n***d.*** Modification of the value of the transport rate described in clause 7.3.1 in accordance with the procedure established in Annex XIV.\n\n***e.*** Collection of the Value Added Tax, VAT, as set forth in Official Letter No. 01044 of October 5, 1998, which appears as annex number XVI, pursuant to which the Directorate of Internal Revenue Service states that the imports made by the contractor for the operations of block 15 under the structure of the participation contract, are subject to said tax.\n\nIn the cases indicated in letters a) and b), the Parties shall enter into amending contracts as indicated in clause 15.2, in order to re-establish the economy of this Participation Contract. When the events indicated in letters c), d) and e) occur, a correction factor shall be included in the participation percentages, to absorb the increase or decrease of the economic burden, in accordance with Annex No. XIV. (Emphasis added)\n\n***11.9 Exemptions:*** According to Art. 54 of the Hydrocarbons Law, Contractor is exempt from payment of entry rates, surface rights, royalties and contributions to compensation works, as well as the contribution to technical research set forth in first section of the above mentioned provisions of the Hydrocarbons Law.\n\n[\u2026]\n\n***11.11 Tax Regime Modification:*** In the event that: a) there is a modification of the tax or labor participation regimes in effect as of the signing date of this Participation Contract, as these are described in this Clause; and/or (b) of their legal interpretation; and/or (c) the creation of new taxes or levies not foreseen in this Participation Contract, which have an impact upon the economy of same, a correction factor shall be included in the participation percentages that shall absorb the increase or decrease of the aforementioned tax burden or labor participation. This correction factor shall be calculated between the Parties, following the procedure outlined in Art. Thirty-one (31) of the Regulations for the Application of the Reformatory Laws to the Hydrocarbons Law. The modification of this Participation Contract will take into account the date on which the corresponding modification or legal interpretation of the indicated tax or labor regimes went into effect, or the date on which the new taxes not covered in this Clause were created.\n\n[\u2026]\n\n***15.2 Modifying Contracts.-*** After prior agreement between the Parties, there shall be an opportunity to negotiate and enter into modifying contracts in those cases determined in Art. 30 of the Regulations for the Application of Law 44, especially in the following cases:\n\n[\u2026]\n\n***c)*** When the regime for taxes, foreign currency, remittance of funds abroad or labor participation applicable to this type of contract in the country have been modified, in order to re-establish the economy of this Participation Contract, in accordance with sub-clauses 8.6 and 11.10.\n\n[\u2026]\n\n470.\n\nIt is the Respondent's position that Law 42 cannot have \"an impact on the economy of this Participation Contract\" as contemplated by Clause 8.6. Law 42 was enacted in 2006, says the Respondent, merely for the purpose of capturing a portion of the windfall profits that were by then flowing to oil companies in Ecuador as a result of an \"astounding and unforeseeable\" increase in the price of oil. In so doing, the Respondent claims to have done \"nothing more than exercise its indisputable sovereign authority to raise revenue for its governmental operations and the public welfare.\" The Respondent argues that the Claimants were not entitled to expect windfall profits generated by prices for oil unimaginable at the time the Participation Contract was signed. By reference to Clause 8.6 of the Participation Contract, the Respondent seeks to refute the Claimants' contention to the contrary as follows:\n\n[...][T]here is no provision in the Participation Contract which could possibly evidence Claimants' supposed expectation. On the contrary, the provisions of clause 8.6 make it clear that Claimants (*i*) knew and expected that OEPC's revenues may be adversely affected by changes in Ecuadorian law and (*ii*) agreed that it would only be indemnified against such changes (*a*) if the measure at issue fell within a certain class and (*b*) only to the extent necessary to re-establish the economic value of the contract.\n\nWith oil prices at unimaginable highs, the value to OEPC of its Participation Contract remained far greater than it could ever have imagined at the time it negotiated it and certainly well above the agreed point of equilibrium. Claimants' bare assertion that they had an expectation that OEPC would be entitled to the full value of its windfall profits unaffected by a law such as the HCL Amendment is baseless. OEPC knew and expected at the time that it executed the contract that State measures may impact its revenue stream from the sale of its participation, and tried to deal with that situation in clause 8.6 of the Participation Contract. Its problem is clause 8.6 is triggered only if some measure fell within its ambit *and* reduced the net present value of the contract below the agreed equilibrium point. The HCL Amendment did neither. In the absence of a stabilization clause, Claimants could have had no legitimate expectation that a measure such as the HCL Amendment would not be enacted or, if it was, that they would be immune from its application. (Emphasis in original)\n\n471.\n\nThe Respondent adds that even if Law 42 fell within the ambit of Clause 8.6, the obligation imposed on the parties by Clause 8.6 would merely be to \"reestablish the economy of this Participation Contract.\" According to the Respondent, Clause 8.6 is thus a classic re-negotiation clause and not a stabilization clause.\n\n472.\n\nFurthermore, the Respondent contends that even if Clause 8.6 required the parties to negotiate amendments to the Participation Contract that would re-establish the agreed economic value of the contract to OEPC in the event that the Respondent took some measure which adversely affected it, the underlying premise was that the economic value of the Participation Contract to OEPC was less than that which had been forecasted at the time the contract was negotiated. In other words, says the Respondent, as long as the price of Block 15 crude exceeds the $15 per barrel price agreed by the parties in determining their respective participation percentages, the economic value of the contract to OEPC will be above the value expected to be yielded at any given point in time. That is so even if Law 42 is applied, since OEPC will still always enjoy 50% of the upside of every cent above $15 per barrel.\n\n473.\n\nFinally, the Respondent avers that even if an obligation to re-establish the economic value of the Participation Contract did arise, the obligation on the parties was to negotiate a modifying contract in accordance with Clause 15.2. According to the Respondent, the mere enactment of Law 42 could never have amounted to a breach of the Participation Contract and, in the circumstances, there could be no breach of contract absent a failure on the part of the parties to agree a revised contract.\n\n474.\n\nEchoing its submissions regarding the *Caducidad* Decree, the Respondent also denies that Law 42 was a direct or indirect expropriation, that Law 42 discriminated against the Claimants in favour of Ecuadorian companies, or that Law 42 caused arbitrary and discriminatory impairment of the Claimants' investment. The Respondent, in addition, reasserts the constitutionality of Law 42 as declared by the Ecuadorian Constitutional Court.\n\n***(b) The Claimants' Position***\n---------------------------------\n\n475.\n\nAs previously noted, the Claimants contend that Law 42 - which they refer to as a \"value-depressing measure\" - should not be taken into account for purposes of quantifying their losses. Law 42, contend the Claimants, violates both the Treaty and Ecuador's Constitution.\n\n476.\n\nMore particularly, it is the Claimants' position that, by enacting Law 42 in 2006, the Respondent unilaterally introduced by law a contractual term that it had rejected in 1999 when it negotiated the Participation Contract, and subsequently failed to obtain in 2005 when the parties sought to renegotiate that contract on a mutually agreed basis. According to the Claimants, Law 42 violates the express terms of the formula set out in Clause 8.1 of the Participation Contract53:\n\n[...] Ecuador, by taking 50% (which increased in 2007 to 99%, see 246 above) of OEPC's revenues from Block 15 production above an arbitrary reference price, radically modified the participation formula of Clause 8.1 of the Participation Contract. That clause provides unequivocally that OEPC's participation will vary with volume and quantity, but *not* with price. CE-2, Clause 8.1. In fact, as Mr. Albuja has explained and Ecuador has not denied, the parties specifically considered tying OEPC's participation to price fluctuations during the negotiation of the Participation Contract but decided not to do so. *See* CMD \u00b6\u00b6104-1078; FA WS II \u00b64. It is therefore clear that the HCL Amendment struck at the very heart of OEPC's acquired rights under the Participation Contract by changing the agreed upon participation formula of Clause 8.1 to reduce OEPC's agreed-upon share in production. (Emphasis in original)\n\nClause 8.1 and 8.5 are set out *infra*, at paragraphs 512 and 513.\n\n477.\n\nThe Claimants emphasize that, when the parties converted their Services Agreement to a Participation Contract, they specifically agreed to tie their participations exclusively to production volume, and not to oil prices, thereby giving the Claimants a legitimate basis to expect that the Respondent would not subsequently retract that essential part of the bargain. In the words of the Claimants:\n\nMost fundamentally, when an investor enters into a long-term contract with a clear and unambiguous revenue-distribution formula, it can reasonably expect that the agreed upon formula will allocate the risks and rewards of the parties throughout the life of the contract. That is all the more true where, as here, the investor assumed all of the risk of the required capital investment. An investor cannot be fairly required in those circumstances to bear all of the risk of a low price environment without the commensurate reward of a high price environment.\n\n478.\n\nThe Claimants accordingly contend that the Respondent breached its obligation under Article II.3(c) of the Treaty to observe any obligation it might have entered into with regard to investments because Law 42 writes two essential terms out of the Participation Contract, namely the production-sharing formula under Clause 8.1, as well as OEPC's right under Clause 5.3.2 of the Participation Contract freely to dispose of its participation. According to the Claimants, the Clause 5.3.2 right is meaningless unless it includes the right freely to enjoy the revenues from such disposal and Law 42, they add, removed that right from the Participation Contract with respect to half of all pre-tax revenues accruing from sales at a price in excess of the price of crude oil as of the date of the Participation Contract.\n\n479.\n\nIn addition, the Claimants contend that, by enacting Law 42, the Respondent breached its obligation under Article II.1 of the Treaty, pursuant to which the Respondent is required to \"treat investment, and activities associated therewith, on a basis no less favourable than that accorded in like situations to investment or associated activities of its own nationals or companies, or of nationals or companies of any third party.\" According to the Claimants, the impact of Law 42 was such that U.S. investments were inevitably going to suffer losses that simply bear no comparison to any losses suffered by Ecuadorian investments.\n\n480.\n\nThe Claimants also submit that Law 42 is in breach of the fair and equitable treatment (Article II.3(a)) and full protection and security (Article II.3(b)) provisions of the Treaty, reiterating that they had a legitimate expectation that the Respondent would not impair the long-term contractual bargain on which they had premised their investment. The Claimants stress that it is on the basis of that bargain that they decided to put enormous capital at risk in Ecuador, and that they did so in the expectation that the Respondent would not take away the reward of the investment once they had successfully managed the risk of that investment.\n\n481.\n\nSpecifically, the Claimants refute the Respondent's assertion that they could not have expected to be insulated from any kind of generally applicable modification to Ecuador's tax or legal framework. Law 42 was not, say the Claimants, a \"generally-applicable modification to Ecuador's tax or legal framework.\" In this regard, the Claimants submit that even with respect to companies with a participation contract, Law 42 was applied selectively (*e.g*. the Tarapoa contract was exempted from the application of Law 42).\n\n482.\n\nThe Claimants also aver that, by enacting Law 42, the Respondent has breached the Article III expropriation provision of the Treaty, arguing that the Respondent has thereby deprived OEPC of (i) the participation in Block 15 production to which the Participation Contract entitled it and that, it was specifically agreed, would not vary with oil price fluctuations; and (ii) its right to freely dispose of its entire participation in Block 15 production and to receive the revenues from such free disposal. The Claimants add that those rights are both a \"claim to money\" and a \"right conferred by contract,\" both of which are expressly included in the Treaty's definition of investment.\n\n483.\n\nFinally, the Claimants assert that Law 42 violates the Ecuadorian Constitution because (i) it violates the principles of legal security and non-retroactivity, (ii) the principle of freedom of contract, (iii) it constitutes an unlawful confiscation, and (iv) it violates the principle of equality of treatment.\n\n***(c) The Tribunal's Analysis and Conclusion***\n------------------------------------------------\n\n***(i) Preliminary Observations***\n----------------------------------\n\n484.\n\nAt the outset of its analysis of Law 42, the Tribunal recalls the title of the HCL Amendment: \"State's Participation in surplus from oil sales prices not agreed upon or not foreseen.\"\n\n485.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that Decree 1672 fixed the \"State's Participation\" at the level of 50% of what Law 42 refers to as the \"extraordinary revenues\" earned by \"Contractor companies\" such as the Claimants as a result of any increase in price above the monthly average price in effect at the time of the execution of the Participation Contract.\n\n486.\n\nThe Tribunal further notes that the words \"extraordinary revenues\" are found nowhere in the Participation Contract.\n\n***(ii) Characterization of Law 42 and the Respondent's Jurisdictional Objection***\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n487.\n\nAgainst this background, the Tribunal has determined that its analysis regarding the impact of Law 42 requires that it first characterize this legislation. Is it a tax, a royalty, a levy or, more generally, a \"matter of taxation\" under the Treaty, or is it something else?\n\n488.\n\nThere is also a compelling procedural reason why the Tribunal must characterize Law 42. At the Hearing on Quantum, the Respondent, for the first time in these proceedings, claimed that \"the question of Law 42 is excluded from the Arbitral Tribunal's jurisdiction in accordance with Article 10 of Ithe| Treaty\".54 In effect, as will be seen, the Respondent was now adopting the position that Law 42 was a \"matter of taxation.\"\n\nHearing Transcript (6 November 2009) at page 161.\n\n489.\n\nThe Tribunal recalls that the Respondent, throughout the Hearing on Quantum, was loath to characterize Law 42. In its Post-Hearing Brief, the Respondent stated categorically that Law 42 was not a royalty.\n\n490.\n\nThe Tribunal also recalls that at the Hearing on Quantum, the Respondent submitted categorically that Law 42 \"is not a tax\". In the words of counsel for Ecuador: \"II|n Ecuador I.| for a tax to be created and imposed on the citizens, you need to follow some special procedures in the constitution. Here, this Law 42 was issued pursuant to a different procedure. So it couldn't be a tax.\"55 (Emphasis added)\n\nHearing Transcript (4 November 2009) at page 175.\n\n491.\n\nThe Claimants have argued, albeit in the alternative, that Law 42 is either a royalty within the meaning and in breach of Clause 11.9 of the Participation Contract, or otherwise a tax or a levy within the meaning of Clause 11.11 of the Participation Contract which requires an adjustment in the form of a correction factor pursuant to Clauses 8.6 and 11.11 of the Contract.\n\n492.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees with the Respondent that Law 42 is not a royalty. Such a characterization is contrary to the plain text of Clause 11.9 of the Participation Contract as well as the plain text of the operative provision of Law 42 referred to above.\n\n493.\n\nBy its express terms, Clause 11.9 incorporates into the Participation Contract Article 54 of the HCL which it repeats word for word:\n\n***11.9 Exemptions:*** According to Art. 54 of the Hydrocarbons Law, Contractor is exempt from payment of entry rates, surface rights, royalties and contributions to compensation works, as well as the contribution to technical research set forth in first section of the above mentioned provisions of the Hydrocarbons Law. (Emphasis added)\n\n494.\n\nIn addition, as also noted by the Respondent, a royalty is generally defined as a payment made in exchange for access to a natural resource.56 This is clearly not what Law 42 contemplates. The Tribunal thus concludes that Law 42 is not a royalty.\n\nSee Black's Law Dictionary, 7th edition (1999).\n\n495.\n\nThe Tribunal also agrees with the Respondent that Law 42 is not a tax. Again, such a characterization is contrary to the plain text of Law 42 and, in any event, as stressed by the Respondent, it was not \"created\" in accordance with the Ecuadorian Constitution.\n\n496.\n\nIn this regard, the Tribunal notes that the Claimants' contention that Law 42 is a tax was not pressed with much vigour in either their written or oral submissions. Even their legal expert, Dr. P\u00e9rez Loose, could not bring himself to opine clearly that Law 42 was a tax.\n\n497.\n\nIn any event, even if Law 42 were a tax, it would not, in the opinion of the Tribunal, create a jurisdictional barrier to the Claimants' Law 42 claim under the Treaty for the following reasons.\n\n498.\n\nArticle X of the Treaty provides that:\n\n1. With respect to its tax policies, each Party should strive to accord fairness and equity in the treatment of investment of nationals and companies of the other Party.\n\n2. Nevertheless, the provisions of this Treaty, and in particular Article VI and VII, shall apply to matters of taxation only with respect to the following:\n\n(a) expropriation, pursuant to Article III;\n\n(b) transfers, pursuant to Article IV; or\n\n(c) the observance and enforcement of terms of an investment agreement or authorization as referred to in Article VI (1) (a) or (b), to the extent they are not subject to the dispute settlement provisions of a Convention for the avoidance of double taxation between the two Parties, or have been raised under such settlement provisions and are not resolved within a reasonable period of time. (Emphasis added)\n\n499.\n\nThe Tribunal is of the view that Law 42, even if it was characterized as a \"matter of taxation\", would be captured by the \"exception to the exception\" of Article X.2(c) of the Treaty. The dispute between the parties, in the present arbitration, relates directly to the observance and enforcement of the terms of the Participation Contract which, in the opinion of the Tribunal, is an investment agreement under Article VI(1)(a) of the Treaty.\n\n500.\n\nThe Respondent's jurisdictional objection regarding Law 42 is thus dismissed.\n\n501.\n\nHaving found that Law 42 is neither a royalty nor a tax, it remains for the Tribunal to determine whether Law 42 can be characterized as a levy.\n\n502.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that in its Post-Hearing Brief on Law 42, the Respondent wrote that \"[i]f the Arbitral tribunal requires that Ecuador characterize Law 42 under Ecuadorian Law, Ecuador would submit that Law 42 is a levy.\"\n\n503.\n\nThe word \"levy\" is not a defined term in the Participation Contract. In fact, the word is only used once in the Participation Contract, in Clause 11.11, in the context of \"the creation of new taxes or levies not foreseen in this Participation Contract, which have an impact upon the economy of same [...].\" (Emphasis added)\n\n504.\n\nThe Tribunal notes Clause 3.4.4 of the Participation Contract which reads as follows:\n\n***3.4.4.*** For those definitions not included in this Participation Contract or in the provisions that comprise the legal framework hereof, the Parties will refer to the definitions included in the Hydrocarbons Law and its regulations, as well as those generally accepted by the international oil industry.\n\n505.\n\nThere is no definition of \"levy\" in the Hydrocarbons Law or its regulations.\n\n506.\n\nNeither party has represented to the Tribunal that a \"levy\" was a word \"generally accepted by the international oil industry\".\n\n507.\n\nIn the circumstances, the Tribunal refers again to Black's Law Dictionary where levy is defined as \"the imposition of a fine or tax; the fine or tax so imposed\".\n\n508.\n\nThe participation of \"50% of the extraordinary revenues\" decreed by Law 42 in favour of the Ecuadorian State cannot, in the view of the Tribunal, be considered as a fine or tax. Rather, as evidenced by both its title and its express terms, Law 42 decrees an increased participation \"in favour of the Ecuadorian State\" from \"companies [such as OEPC] that hold participation contracts\".\n\n509.\n\nFor purposes of characterizing Law 42, it is sufficient for the Tribunal to conclude, as it now does, that the participation of Ecuador under Law 42 \"in surplus from oil sales prices not agreed upon or not foreseen,\" is neither a royalty, a tax, a levy or any other measure of taxation under the Participation Contract.\n\n510.\n\nIt is, as its title makes explicit, a unilateral decision of the Ecuadorian Congress to allocate to the Ecuadorian State a defined percentage of the revenues earned by contractor companies such as OEPC that hold participation contract.\n\n511.\n\nThe Tribunal will now turn to its analysis of Law 42.\n\n***(iii) Analysis of Law 42***\n------------------------------\n\n512.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, the analysis of Law 42 must commence with the determination of the basis on which OEPC's participation in the exploration and exploitation of hydrocarbons in Block 15 was to be calculated. Clauses 8.1 and 8.5 of the Participation Contract are very clear in that respect: PetroEcuador and OEPC agreed that, as of May 1999, OEPC would receive a participation in the production of crude oil and that such participation would be calculated as follows:\n\n***EIGHT: PARTICIPATION AND DELIVERY PROCEDURES.-***\n\n***8.1 Calculating Contractor Participation.-*** Contractor Participation shall be calculated according to the following formula:\n\nPC = XQ / 100\n\nWhere:\n\nPC = Contractor Participation\n\nQ = Fiscalized Production\n\nX = Average factor, in percentage, rounded out to the third decimal, corresponding to Contractor Participation, calculated according to the following formula:\n\nx = (X1.q1 + X2.q2 + X3.q3)/q +Y\n\nWhere:\n\nq = is average daily Fiscalized Production for the corresponding Fiscal Year.\n\nq1 = is the part of q lower than L1\n\nq2 = is the part of q between L1 and L2.\n\nq3 = is the part of q greater than L2.\n\n513.\n\nAs for the Respondent, its participation was to be calculated as follows:\n\n**8.5 State Participation in Production.** - Once production has started, State Participation shall be calculated as follows:\n\nPE = (100 - X)Q / 100\n\nWhere:\n\nPE = State Participation\n\nX and Q are defined in Clause 8.1\n\n514.\n\nUnder the Participation Contract, the parties' respective participations were thus dependent exclusively on production volume.\n\n515.\n\nThe Tribunal recalls that the Participation Contract replaced a Services Contract between the parties. As explained by Mr. Fernando Albuja,57 under the Services Contract model the Respondent remained the sole owner of the oil produced and thus captured the higher revenues flowing from any increase in the price of oil. According to Mr. Albuja, during the negotiations of the Participation Contract, OEPC proposed that the parties' participations remain dependent on production volume but also vary with crude oil price fluctuations. This proposal was rejected by PetroEcuador. In the words of Mr. Albuja, \"they insisted that under a participation contract I.| the parties' participations could only vary with production volume and not with price.\"58\n\nMr. Albuja submitted four witness statements on behalf of the Claimants. From 1992 to 15 May 2006, he worked for OEPC in Ecuador. See, in particular, his Second Witness Statement dated 17 September 2007. The Tribunal notes that Mr. Albuja's evidence was not challenged or contradicted by the Respondent.\n\nSecond Witness Statement of Fernando Albuja dated 17 September 2007 at paragraph 8.\n\n516.\n\nAs a result, observes Mr. Albuja, \"Occidental accepted the risk that crude oil market prices would remain below the hypothetical $15 per barrel price, and PetroEcuador accepted that each party would benefit from future price increases in proportion to its volume-defined participations and that it would not receive more oil if the price of oil increased.\"59\n\n*Ibid.* at paragraph 9.\n\n517.\n\nMr. Albuja adds: \"Based on what PetroEcuador's negotiators told me at the time60, the parties therefore fully shared the understanding that Occidental would bear all of the risk of low prices but would also take no less than what its participation entitles it to in the case of high prices.\"61\n\nMr. Albuja refers specifically, in this connection, to an affidavit submitted in the VAT arbitration by Patricio Larrea, whom he describes as PetroEcuador's lead negotiator (see Second Witness Statement of Fernando Albuja dated 17 September 2007 at paragraph 9).\n\nSecond Witness Statement of Fernando Albuja dated 17 September 2007 at paragraph 9.\n\n518.\n\nIn addition, the Tribunal notes that both before and after the conclusion of the Participation Contract, the Respondent did agree, in other oil exploration and exportation contracts, to tie the participation percentages to oil price fluctuations.\n\n519.\n\nIt is against that background that, in the fall of 2005, in a higher oil price environment, the Respondent sought to revisit the bargain that it had struck with OEPC (and other oil companies) seven years earlier and asked for a renegotiation of the Participation Contract. While the evidence is not clear as to why these negotiations did not lead to an agreement between the parties, it is a fact that they were not successful.\n\n520.\n\nIn April 2006, shortly before *caducidad* was declared, Law 42 was passed which, as noted earlier, now made the Respondent's participation in the revenues from oil directly dependent on crude oil prices, in stark contradiction with Clauses 8.1 and 8.5 of the Participation Contract which sets the participation of the parties in the oil produced without any reference to the price of oil.62\n\nMr. Albuja affirmed that \"[s]ince under the participation contract we would make all required investments at our own risk and our participation in production would be our only source of revenue, this determination was an essential part of the [negotiation] process\" (see Second Witness Statement of Fernando Albuja dated 17 September 2007 at paragraph 5). (Emphasis added)\n\n521.\n\nWhile it is true, as argued by the Respondent (and indeed admitted by the Claimants), that Clause 8.1 does not contain any guaranteed revenue term and that Law 42 has not changed the percentage in the volumes, in the opinion of the Tribunal this is not a complete answer to the question posed by the Respondent as to whether or not Law 42 should be taken into account for purposes of quantifying the Claimants' losses.\n\n522.\n\nIt is clear to the Tribunal that, in the Participation Contract, the Claimants knowingly accepted the risk of losses on its investment in case of a low price scenario and the Respondent knowingly forewent the opportunity to increase its participation in case of a high price scenario. This was the bargain which was struck by the parties and which was reflected in the Participation Contract.\n\n523.\n\nLaw 42, by taking 50% of OEPC's revenues from Block 15 production above the agreed reference price, modified radically the participation of the parties agreed in Clause 8.1. The Tribunal agrees with the Claimants' submission that \"the HCL Amendment struck at the very heart of OEPC's acquired rights under the Participation Contract by changing the agreed upon participation formula of Clause 8.1 to reduce OEPC's agreed upon share in production.\"\n\n524.\n\nIn addition, the Tribunal notes that the Respondent, with Law 42, wrote out of the Participation Contract another right enjoyed by OEPC under the Participation Contract. Under Clause 5.3.2, OEPC had the right to \"freely dispose\" of its participation. Obviously, that right becomes meaningless unless it includes the right \"freely\" to enjoy the revenues from such disposal. Law 42 extinguished that right with respect to half of all revenues accruing from sales by OEPC at a price in excess of the reference price.\n\n525.\n\nThus, the Tribunal finds that with the introduction of Law 42, the Respondent modified unilaterally and in a substantial way the contractual and legal framework that existed at the time the Claimants negotiated and agreed the Participation Contract and thereby violated Clauses 5.3.2 and 8.1 of the Participation Contract.\n\n526.\n\nThe considerable investments made by OEPC in Ecuador after the execution of the Participation Contract were based upon the explicit representations made by the Respondent during the negotiation of the Participation Contract which were then crystallized in the participation agreed by the parties in Clauses 8.1 and 8.5. The investor, OEPC, was justified in expecting that this contractual framework would be respected and certainly not modified unilaterally by the Respondent.\n\n527.\n\nIn conclusion, Law 42 is in breach of the Participation Contract and flouts the Claimants' legitimate expectations. It is, as a result, in breach of the Respondent's Article II.3(a) Treaty obligation to accord fair and equitable treatment to the Claimants' investment and the Tribunal so finds. In the circumstances, the Tribunal need not rule on whether Law 42 is in breach of other provisions of the Treaty.\n\n528.\n\nThere remain three additional arguments of the Respondent which the Tribunal needs to address. First, the Respondent claims that, by enacting Law 42 in the light of the \"astounding and unforeseeable\" increase in the price of oil, it has done \"nothing more than exercise its indisputable sovereign authority to raise revenue for its governmental operations and the public welfare.\"\n\n529.\n\nThere cannot be any doubt that a sovereign State has the undisputable sovereign authority to enact laws in order to raise revenue for the public welfare but, as is equally well established, \"the exercise of such right is not unlimited and must have its boundaries.\"63\n\n*ADC Affiliate Ltd. and ADC & ADMC Management Ltd. v. Republic of Hungary* (ICSID Case No. ARB/03/16), Award of 2 October 2006 at paragraph 423.\n\n530.\n\nAs the tribunal stated in the *ADC* award, \"the rule of law, which includes treaty obligations, provides such boundaries.\"64 The *ADC* tribunal continued with a statement which the present Tribunal finds apposite and adopts:\n\nTherefore, when a State enters into a bilateral investment treaty like the one in this case, it becomes bound by it and the investment-protection obligations it undertook therein must be honoured rather than be ignored by a later argument of the State's right to regulate.65\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n*Ibid.* The Tribunal is of course mindful of the well-known international law principle summarized very clearly by the *Saluka* tribunal *(Saluka Investments BV v. Czech Republic,* Partial Award of 17 March 2006 at paragraph 255): \"It is now established in international law that States are not liable to pay compensation to a foreign investor when, in the normal exercise of their regulatory powers, they adopt in a nondiscriminatory manner *bona fide* regulations that are aimed at the general welfare.\" However, the situation is different where, as in the present case, the State is bound by the terms of a contract which it has entered into with the investor. That contract fetters the State's exercise of its regulatory powers.\n\n531.\n\nThe Respondent submits, in addition, that Clause 8.6 makes it clear that the Claimants knew that their revenues could be adversely affected by changes in Ecuadorian law and agreed that they could only be indemnified against such changes in certain defined circumstances.\n\n532.\n\nThe Tribunal has already found that Law 42 did not create a royalty, a tax nor a levy. Since, as the Respondent itself submitted, \"Clause 8.6 is triggered only if some measure fell within its ambit\", there is accordingly no need for the Tribunal to enter into the debate between the parties with respect to the meaning of the \"economy\" of the Participation Contract as referred to in Clause 11.11 regarding a \"tax regime modification.\"\n\n533.\n\nThe Respondent also contends that a proportionate sanction for the Claimants' breach of its obligation not to transfer rights under the Participation Contract without authorization would have been re-negotiation of the Participation Contract so as to lead to a result equivalent to that imposed by Law 42, and that, prior to *caducidad*, the Claimants were prepared to recognize the principle of a \"price sharing mechanism substantially similar to the price sharing mechanism contained in the [...] Tarapoa Block Participation Contract [...]\" in a re-negotiated Participation Contract, as shown by the 22 February 2006 letter agreement between OEPC and Andes Petroleum Ecuador Ltd.66\n\nExhibit C-425 and Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief on Law 42 of 18 December 2009 at paragraphs 44 and following.\n\n534.\n\nIn the view of the Tribunal, both of these contentions are wrong because they overlook the simple fact that a re-negotiation of the Participation Contract did not occur. The basic question to be answered in a valuation exercise such as the present one, discussed below, is \"what was the value of that which the Claimants actually lost?\" The question is not \"what was the value of that which the Claimants might have lost had history been different?\" To answer this latter question, which is effectively what the Respondent invites this Tribunal to do, would be to engage in impermissible speculation as to the terms of any possible re-negotiation. The Tribunal cannot know what the terms would have been, and in particular what the Claimants would have bargained for in exchange for the arrangement in question. Thus, these factors cannot be taken into account by the Tribunal in its determination of the fair market value of the Claimants' investment.\n\n535.\n\nThis is why, in the view of the Tribunal, this letter agreement does not, as the Respondent contends, show clearly that \"a split of the extraordinary revenues very close to the one encompassed in Article 2 of Law 42 would have been accepted by Claimants as part of a renegotiation of the Participation Contract.\"67 At its highest, it is an agreement by Andes that OEPC will have the \"right to negotiate with the Ecuadorian Government [\u2026] to resolve the Caducity Proceedings\" with the inclusion of terms nearly equivalent to Law 42.68 But, as noted in the previous paragraph, a re-negotiation of the Participation Contract never did take place.\n\n*Ibid*.\n\nExhibit C-425 at paragraphs 2(b), (c) and (e).\n\n536.\n\nConsequently, as advocated by the Claimants, the Tribunal will not take into account Law 42 for the purpose of its valuation of the quantum of the Claimants' damages.\n\n***(iv) Final observations***\n-----------------------------\n\n537.\n\nNotwithstanding this conclusion, the Tribunal is compelled to address the Respondent's submission that the Tribunal must consider Law 42 because in valuing the fair market value of the Participation Contract, and using the analogy of a willing buyer and seller, \"any willing buyer would have used the existence of Law 42 to obtain a reduction of the price to be paid for Block 15 on May 15, 2006.\"\n\n538.\n\nIn substance, the Respondent is saying that, either generally as part of commercial behaviour or specifically given the requirements of authorization, Law 42 should feature in assessing what Block 15 would realize in a hypothetical sale.\n\n539.\n\nThe Tribunal concludes that this argument suffers from a fundamental flaw. It is obvious that a hypothetical third party would not pay more than would be justified by the prospective returns on an investment, and that Law 42 would have to figure in an assessment of these returns (either because of the risk of its continued application or because Ecuador would insist on this as a pre-condition to authorization). But asking what a hypothetical investor would pay under Law 42 which the Tribunal has found to be in breach of the Participation Contract is irrelevant to assessing what OEPC, whose contract protected it against things like Law 42, has actually lost. To reiterate, the test is not \"what would a hypothetical buyer pay in the circumstances as they are now\"; the test is \"what have the Claimants lost.\" The fair market value is a guide to answering this question, but what must be calculated is the discounted cash flow value of the Participation Contract (*i.e.* Block 15) excluding breaches of it (*i.e*. Law 42) by the Respondent.\n\n540.\n\nIn essence, what this argument says is that the answer to the question \"what have the Claimants lost\" is \"the value (as assessed by discounted cash flow analysis) of the Participation Contract, conformed to by the Respondent\"; the answer to that question is not \"an opportunity to sell the Participation Contract to a third party.\" It is in focussing on the latter that Ecuador is mistaken.\n\n541.\n\nThis reasoning is persuasively presented by the Claimants when they observe that \"a State cannot reduce its liability for a wrongful act [here, expropriation/disproportionate sanction via *caducidad* ] on the basis of another wrongful act [applying Law 42 to OEPC in breach of the Participation Contract]. [\u2026] *A valuation tool like the willing buyer analogy cannot override that principle*.\" The emphasized statement effectively refutes the Respondent's arguments based on the fair market value and the willing buyer/seller standard. In particular, it renders its contention that \"[i]nternational tribunals have noted that petroleum companies can expect to be required to make economic concessions when oil prices go up significantly and that such risk should be factored in the value that a willing buyer would be willing to pay\" irrelevant: regardless of how common it is in general, OEPC specifically (and any purchaser of its investment) did not have to expect to make such concessions and hence comply with Law 42, because the Participation Contract shielded it against precisely such things. A similar logic refutes the suggestion that the Respondent's ability not to approve a transfer means Law 42 must be taken into account: *vis-\u00e0-vis* OEPC and any potential buyer of the Participation Contract rights, Law 42 simply does not enter into the equation.\n\n542.\n\nThe above conclusions are supported in international law. The starting point is the *American International* case. The relevant passage is worth citing at length:\n\nIn ascertaining the going concern value of an enterprise at a previous point in time for purposes of establishing the appropriate quantum of compensation for nationalization, it is - as already stated - necessary to exclude the effects of actions taken by the nationalizing State in relation to the enterprise which actions may have depressed its value.69\n\nSee*American International Group, Inc. and American Life Insurance Company v. The Islamic Republic of Iran,* Award of 19 December 1983, reprinted in 4 Iran-US C.T.R. 96 at page 107.\n\n543.\n\nOn the other hand, prior changes in the general political, social and economic conditions which might have affected the enterprise's business prospects as of the date the enterprise was taken should be considered.\n\n544.\n\nThe force of this passage must be even greater when \"actions taken by the nationalizing State in relation to the enterprise\" are actions that themselves constitute a breach of a contract between the State and the investor. The fact that Law 42 is in violation of the Participation Contract means that it cannot be relegated to the status of \"changes in the general political, social and economic conditions.\" While, without the inconsistency with the Participation Contract, Law 42 could possibly have been categorized as such a \"background\" change, in the specific context of the Participation Contract it cannot be.\n\n545.\n\nThis is made even more plain by Marboe's comment on the *American International* principle:\n\nIt is, according to this view, necessary to distinguish the negative consequences on the value which were caused by the actions of the State from those negative consequences on the value caused by changes of the general political, social, and economic conditions. *The former must be excluded from the valuation because* *otherwise the State would benefit from its own acts. The latter, however, fall under the business risk*.70 (Emphasis added)\n\nIrmgard Marboe, *Calculation of Compensation and Damages in International Investment Law* (Oxford University Press, 2009) at paragraph 3,258.\n\n546.\n\nThe emphasized passage makes it clear that to relegate a wrongful act (*i.e.* breach of the Participation Contract by application of Law 42 to OEPC or its purchaser) to the category of \"background\" change or \"business risk\" would be to allow the Respondent to profit from its own wrongdoing, contrary to the general principles of international law explicitly proscribing this. The necessary implication from this is that if a measure is not lawful (even if not lawful only *vis-\u00e0-vis* OEPC because of its protection from things such as Law 42 in the Participation Contract), then it must be discounted for valuation purposes.\n\n547.\n\nFor all the foregoing reasons, the Tribunal will disregard Law 42 for the purpose of its valuation of the quantum of the Claimants' damages.\n\n***D. The Ecuadorian VAT Interpretative Law***\n----------------------------------------------\n\n***1. Introduction***\n---------------------\n\n548.\n\nThe VAT Law, also referred to as the VAT Interpretative Law, was passed by the Ecuadorian Congress on 3 August 2004 very shortly after the VAT Award's release on 2 August 2004. Its sole article provides as follows:\n\nArticle 69-A of the Internal Tax Regime Law [...] is hereby interpreted in the sense that reimbursement of Value Added Taxes, VAT, is not applicable to petroleum activities when referring to extraction, transportation and commercialization of oil, since petroleum is not produced, but is extracted from the respective reservoirs.\n\n***2. The Respondent's Procedural Objections***\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n549.\n\nThe Tribunal recalls that it has already dismissed the Respondent's initial procedural objections pursuant to which the Respondent argued that the Claimants did not assert any claims based on the VAT Interpretative Law during the liability phase of the arbitration and that they were precluded from challenging its lawfulness as the basis for its inapplicability during the quantum phase.\n\n***3. The Impact of the VAT Interpretative Law***\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n***(a) The Respondent's Position***\n-----------------------------------\n\n550.\n\nThe Respondent, echoing its position regarding Law 42, submits that the VAT Interpretative Law must be taken into account in the determination by the Tribunal of the value of the Claimants' investment because a \"hypothetical buyer would have acquired its interest after the enactment of the VAT Interpretative Law\" and would therefore have had no legitimate expectation to the VAT refunds.\n\n551.\n\nWith reference to the VAT Award, the Respondent asserts that the VAT Interpretative Law seeks to clarify any ambiguities that may have existed prior to the VAT Award. The Respondent adds that the VAT Award did not - and could not -prevent Ecuador from promulgating an official and definitive interpretation of its own domestic legislation.\n\n***(b) The Claimants' Position***\n---------------------------------\n\n552.\n\nThe Claimants do not accept that the VAT Interpretative Law, which they refer to as another \"value-depressing measure,\" should be taken into account for purposes of quantifying their losses. The Claimants contend that the VAT Interpretative Law violates the terms of the VAT Award, the Treaty as well as directly applicable norms of Andean Community Law. Their argument follows:\n\n*First*, the VAT Tribunal found that the SRI's decrees refusing VAT refunds to OEPC were unfair, arbitrary, and discriminatory, in breach of Articles II.1 and II.3(a) of the Treaty. CE-180. By turning an executive decree into statute, Ecuador changed the form of its wrongful conduct, but not its substance.\n\nThe VAT Interpretative Law is not any less discriminatory than the SRI's practice. Both the intent and effect of the law were plainly to single out one specific group of foreign-owned companies. It does not matter in the eyes of international law whether Ecuador discriminates by law, regulation, or decree. CA-268, *Articles on State Responsibility*, Art. 4.1 (\"The conduct of any State organ shall be considered an act of that State under international law, whether the organ exercises legislative, executive, judicial or any other functions.\"). The effect is exactly the same, and so is the resulting breach of Article II.1 of the Treaty.\n\nIn addition, the VAT Interpretative Law unfairly and arbitrarily frustrated the legitimate expectations of OEPC just as the SRI's unlawful practice that it purported to codify had done. As the VAT Tribunal found, when the parties negotiated the Participation Contract, it was mutually acknowledged and understood that OEPC would recover all VAT paid on the acquisition or importation of goods and services used for the production of oil for export. CA-18 *Occidental* 136. It does not matter for purposes of international law whether Ecuador frustrated that legitimate expectation by law, regulation, or decree. The effect is exactly the same, and so is the resulting breach of Article II.3(a) of the Treaty.\n\n*Second,* as the VAT Tribunal held, Article 4 of Andean Community Decision No. 388 expressly entitled OEPC to a refund of the \"total amount\" of VAT paid \"in connection with the acquisition of domestic or imported raw materials, intermediate inputs, services, and capital goods consumed or used in the process of production, manufacture, transport, or marketing of\" oil for export. CA-348, *Decision No. 388,* Art. 4.\n\nDecision No. 388 is binding upon Ecuador. CA-350, *Treaty establishing the Andean Court of Justice,* Art. 2 (\"Decisions become binding for Member Countries as of the date they are approved by the Andean Council of Foreign Ministers or the Commission of the Andean Community.\"). Ecuador could therefore not derogate from Decision No. 388, whether it was by law, regulation, decree, or otherwise. CA-350, *Treaty establishing the Andean Court of Justice,* Art. 4 (Member States must \"refrain from adopting or employing any such measure as may be contrary to those provisions or that may in any way restrict their application.\"). A wealth of jurisprudence by the Andean Court of Justice has reaffirmed these principles of direct applicability and supremacy of Andean Community Law time and again. CA-353, *Case 51-AI-202* 15; CA-349, *Case 07-AI-98* 15; CA-352, *Case 25-Ai-2001* 17. (Emphasis in original)\n\n***(c) The Tribunal's Analysis and Conclusion***\n------------------------------------------------\n\n553.\n\nOn 1 July 2004, the VAT Tribunal issued its Final Award (the previously-defined \"VAT Award\"). Its main findings and conclusions are very pertinent to the Tribunal's analysis.\n\n554.\n\nThe VAT Tribunal found that Ecuador was obliged, under the Treaty, to reimburse OEPC for the VATs and that, furthermore, OEPC had a legitimate expectation that Ecuador would reimburse those taxes because Ecuadorian law had provided such reimbursement at the time OEPC made its investment. Paragraph 196 of the VAT Award, in particular, is very clear. It reads, in relevant part, as follow:\n\nThe Tribunal concludes on this matter that, as stated above, OEPC undertook its investments, including its participation in the pipeline arrangements, in a legal and business environment that was certain and predictable. This environment was changed as a matter of policy and legal interpretation, thus resulting in the breach of fair and equitable treatment. This breach relates to the effects of both revoking the Granting Resolutions and denying further VAT refunds. [...] (Emphasis added)\n\n555.\n\nThe VAT Tribunal also decided that OEPC was entitled to the refund of all VATs paid, that such refund was not included in Factor X of the Participation Contract and that the SRI Decrees refusing VAT refunds were \"without legal effect\" because Ecuador had breached its obligations under Articles II.1 (discrimination), II.3(a) (fair and equitable treatment) and II.3(b) (arbitrariness) of the Treaty.\n\n556.\n\nExactly one month after the VAT Award, on 2 August 2004, the Ecuadorian Congress adopted the VAT Interpretative Law. The Tribunal recalls that its sole article provides as follows:\n\nArticle 69-A of the Internal Tax Regime Law [\u2026] is hereby interpreted in the sense that reimbursement of Value Added Taxes, VAT, is not applicable to petroleum activities when referring to extraction, transportation and commercialization of oil, since petroleum is not produced, but is extracted from the respective reservoirs. (Emphasis added)\n\n557.\n\nSince the VAT Interpretative Law was adopted 31 days after the VAT Award, it is obvious to the Tribunal that the VAT Interpretative Law was a direct response to the VAT Award with which, the Respondent admits, it disagreed \"strongly\".\n\n558.\n\nWhile the VAT Interpretative Law was presented as an attempt to clarify the confusion identified by the VAT Tribunal, the fact of the matter is that the VAT Interpretative Law accomplishes the very same effect as the SRI Decrees which the VAT Tribunal had found to be in breach of certain provisions of the Treaty.\n\n559.\n\nUnder international law, a State can be found to have discriminated either by law, regulation or decree. Article 4.1 of the Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts, as adopted by the International Law Commission, is controlling. It provides that:\n\n*Article 4. Conduct of organs of a State*\n\n1. The conduct of any State organ shall be considered an act of that State under international law, whether the organ exercises legislative, executive, judicial or any other functions [\u2026]\n\n[\u2026]\n\n560.\n\nIn the view of the Tribunal, the VAT Interpretative Law, unfairly and arbitrarily, frustrated the legitimate expectations of the Claimants in precisely the same way as the SRI's Decrees and is thus also in breach of the Treaty. As such, as between the Claimants and the Respondent, the VAT Interpretative Law is without legal effect and should not be taken into account as a factor which impacts the fair market value of the Claimants' investment.\n\n561.\n\nThe Respondent also argues that the VAT Award \"is in any event immaterial for present purposes\" since:\n\n[t]he question at hand is not whether *OEPC* would have had an entitlement to VAT reimbursements had it continued operating in Ecuador, but whether *a hypothetical purchaser of OEPC's interest in Block 15* would have had such an entitlement. And the answer to that question is no. Any such purchaser would have acquired its interest *after* the enactment of the VAT Interpretative Law and, therefore, would not be able to claim any \"legitimate expectation\" that such reimbursements would be made. (Emphasis in original)\n\n562.\n\nThe Tribunal does not agree with the Respondent's reasoning. As it demonstrated in the previous Section of this Award71, the appropriate question to be answered in a valuation exercise such as the present one is \"what have the Claimants lost\"; the answer to the question \"what have the Claimants lost\" is \"the value (as assessed by discounted cash flow analysis) of the Participation Contract, conformed to by the Respondent;\" the answer to that question is not \"an opportunity to sell the Participation Contract to a third party.\"\n\nSee*supra* at paragraph 539.\n\n563.\n\nIn addition, the Tribunal observes that when a willing buyer establishes the fair market value of the assets, he steps into the shoes of OEPC and he must be entitled to claim, invoke and weigh all the provisions of the Participation Contract which OEPC negotiated and bargained for with PetroEcuador. The hypothetical willing buyer is not buying a hypothetical asset but rather an existing asset, to wit the Claimants' investment in Ecuador which, in virtue of the Participation Contract, included rights in favor of the Claimants which were protected under the Treaty.\n\n564.\n\nAs the Tribunal emphasized earlier, *nullus commodum capere de sua injuria propria* : a State cannot be allowed to take advantage of its own wrongful act.72 The result of the implementation of that well-known principle of international law is that \"the effects of actions taken by the nationalizing State in relation to the enterprise which actions may have depressed its value\" must be disregarded in the determination of that value.73 The Tribunal, applying that principle to the facts of the present case, concludes that it must disregard the VAT Interpretative Law in determining the fair market value of the Claimants' investment.\n\nSee Bin Cheng, General Principles of Law as Applied by International Courts and Tribunals (Cambridge: Grotius Publications Limited, 1987) at page 149; see also*Tippetts, Abbett, McCarthy, Stratton v. TAMS-AFFA* et al., Award of 22 June 1984, reprinted in 6 Iran-U.S. C.T.R. 219 at pages 227-228.\n\nSee*American International Group, Inc. and American Life Insurance Company v. The Islamic Republic of Iran,* Award of 19 December 1983, reprinted in 4 Iran-US C.T.R. 96 at page 107.\n\n565.\n\nThere is one more facet of the VAT Interpretative Law which has been addressed by the parties and which the Tribunal will now analyze: whether or not Clause 8.6(e) of the Contract is triggered into effect in the circumstances of the present case.\n\n566.\n\nThe Tribunal recalls again that the relevant provisions of Clause 8.6 of the Participation Contract read as follows:\n\n***EIGHT: PARTICIPATION AND DELIVERY PROCEDURES.-***\n\n[...]\n\n***8.6 Economic Stability:*** In the event that, due to actions taken by the State of Ecuador or PETROECUADOR, any of the events described below occur and have an impact on the economy of this Participation Contract:\n\n[\u2026]\n\n***e.*** Collection of the Value Added Tax, VAT, as set forth in Official Letter No. 01044 of October 5, 1998, which appears as annex number XVI, pursuant to which the Directorate of Internal Revenue Service states that the imports made by the contractor for the operations of block 15 under the structure of the participation contract, are subject to said tax.\n\n[\u2026]\n\nIn the cases indicated in letters a) and b), the Parties shall enter into amending contracts as indicated in clause 15.2, in order to re-establish the economy of this Participation Contract. When the events indicated in letters c), d) and e) occur, a correction factor shall be included in the participation percentages, to absorb the increase or decrease of the economic burden, in accordance with Annex No. XIV. (Emphasis added)\n\n567.\n\nIt is clear that, for the correction factor to be triggered automatically into effect, the VAT Interpretative Law must be found to have an impact on the economy of the Participation Contract. The Tribunal notes that the parties to the Participation Contract did not in any way specify how that impact was to be measured. It is thus left to the Tribunal, in the exercise of its discretion, to do so.\n\n568.\n\nThe Tribunal recalls that the VAT Award held that OEPC has \"a right to reimbursement (of the VAT) under the law\" and that \"this reimbursement was not included in OEPC's contract\". The right of the Claimants to be reimbursed the Value Added Tax has now been legislated out of existence. There is no doubt, in the view of the Tribunal, that the VAT Interpretative Law has thereby increased the economic burden of the Claimants and thus impacted the economy of the Participation Contract.\n\n569.\n\nConsequently, any hypothetical willing buyer of OEPC's rights under the Participation Contract, relying on the findings and conclusions of the VAT Tribunal,74 would be entitled to apply for a correction factor in the participation percentages to absorb the increase in its economic burden in accordance with Clause 8.6 and Annex No. XIV of the Participation Contract.\n\nSee, in particular, VAT Award at paragraphs 111-114.\n\n570.\n\nIn summary, in the opinion of the Tribunal, the VAT Interpretative Law should not be taken into consideration in its determination of the fair market value of the assets acquired by Ecuador as a result of the *Caducidad* Decree. Alternatively, if it is taken into consideration, the Tribunal can assume the application of a correction factor in accordance with Clause 8.6 of the Participation Contract and its Annex No. XIV which would neutralize the effect of the VAT Interpretative Law and the Tribunal so finds.\n\n***E. The Farmout Agreement***\n------------------------------\n\n***1. The Parties' Initial submissions***\n-----------------------------------------\n\n***(a) The Respondent's Position***\n-----------------------------------\n\n571.\n\nThe Respondent submitted that any calculation of damages to be awarded to the Claimants must be limited to a 60% interest in Block 15 because of the Claimants' transfer of 40% of their interest under the Participation Contract to AEC.\n\n572.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, the Claimants do not have standing to request damages beyond their \"remaining\" 60% interest in Block 15.\n\n573.\n\nThe Respondent also maintains that by virtue of the Farmout Agreement, the Claimants are the beneficial owners of only 60% of the Participation Contract and that, as a result, they were entitled to only 60% of the total profits derived from their investment. In the circumstances, argues the Respondent, an award granting the Claimants damages on the basis of a 100% interest in Block 15 triggers a risk of double-jeopardy:\n\n[I]f Claimants were to collect from Ecuador for losses attributable to the interest of AEC or Andes in Block 15, Ecuador would be exposed to a potential double jeopardy for the same purported losses, which would violate the principle of *ne bis in idem* (\"not twice for the same\"). The possibility cannot be eliminated that AEC and/or Andes will at some point assert claims against Ecuador for the loss of their investment in a separate proceeding, under one theory or another - as unjustified as any such claims would be. Because AEC and Andes are not parties to the present arbitration, they could potentially argue that they are not bound by its result and that any recovery made by OEPC should not be attributed to them. The only way to eliminate this risk of double damages is for this Tribunal to deny Claimants recovery for amounts attributable to the interest of AEC or Andes.75\n\nSee Respondent's Counter-Memorial on Quantum and Memorial on Counterclaim Damages, paragraph 49.\n\n574.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, the Claimants' argument that OEPC was the sole owner of 100% of the rights under the Participation Contract thus \"misses the point\". The Respondent emphasizes that AEC paid due consideration to OEPC for the former's acquisition of a 40% economic interest in Block 15, and that OEPC would be unjustly enriched if it now received, in addition, damages representing 100% of the fair market value of the Participation Contract.\n\n***(b) The Claimants' Position***\n---------------------------------\n\n575.\n\nThe Claimants do not accept the Respondent's contention that they are only entitled to claim 60% of the value of the Participation Contract. According to the Claimants, as the sole owner of the Participation Contract rights, OEPC has the necessary standing to claim 100% of its damages. The Claimants characterize the Respondent's argument regarding standing as a belated objection to the Tribunal's jurisdiction which should have been raised at the very latest when the Respondent filed its CounterMemorial on Liability.\n\n576.\n\nThe Claimants maintain that, in any event, OEPC has always been the sole owner of the Participation Contract rights and that both Claimants are entitled to 100% of the value of those rights.\n\n577.\n\nThe Claimants emphasize that the basis for their claims is OEPC's sole ownership of the rights conferred by the Participation Contract. Thus, according to the Claimants, while OEPC has to meet its contractual liabilities *vis-\u00e0-vis* AEC (now Andes), that does not confer to AEC any ownership of the Participation Contract rights.\n\n578.\n\nAs for the Respondent's allegations of unjust enrichment and double-jeopardy, they are refuted by the Claimants as follows:\n\n*First,* there is no risk of unjust enrichment. OEPC has always been the sole owner of the Participation Contract rights, and it continues to have a contractual liability vis-\u00e0-vis Andes requiring OEPC to pay Andes an amount equal to 40% of any compensation awarded in this arbitration. As in *Enron*, therefore, OEPC holds 100% of both the equity and the related liabilities, and there is no risk of an improper windfall. If Claimants are awarded 100% of the value of the Participation Contract, they will be left with only 60% after honouring their contractual obligations vis-\u00e0-vis Andes.\n\n*Second,* there is no risk of double jeopardy. Upon the rendering of an award, Andes will be able to enforce its contractual right to payment against OEPC. However, Andes has no rights under the Participation Contract and would not be able to make any claims against Ecuador. In any event a clear recording by the Tribunal in its award that compensation is awarded for 100% of the Participation Contract rights would indisputably preclude any future claims by Andes.\n\n579.\n\nThe Claimants assert that the issue of the 40% \"Farmout liability,\" as the Claimants put it, basically raises two fundamental questions: (i) whether the \"Farmout liability\" is in the nature of a contractual obligation of OEPC *vis-\u00e0-vis* AEC as opposed to a right of ownership of AEC in the Participation Contract with Ecuador or the Block 15 oil; and (ii) whether OEPC continued to have the \"Farmout liability\" after *caducidad* and through the present.\n\n580.\n\nThe Claimants answer their own questions as follows: As a result of the Farmout, AEC did not acquire any ownership right in the Participation Contract or the Block 15 oil, let alone a \"perpetual\" one. The Claimants also emphasize that their \"Farmout liability\" \"did not disappear with *caducidad.* \"\n\n581.\n\nThe Tribunal notes the Claimants' final prayer in this regard: \"[T]he Tribunal could fully safeguard Ecuador's interest in this respect by recording in the award that Claimants' damages correspond to 100% of the value of the Participation Contract rights. As soon as Claimants pay AEC its 40% of any award, its claims against OEPC under the Farmout Agreement would have been fully satisfied, so that AEC could not have any further claims.\"\n\n***2. The Dictum of the Permanent Court of International Justice in the Chorz\u00f3w*** ***Factory Case***\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n***(a) Introduction: The Chorz\u00f3w Factory Dictum***\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n582.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that both parties have relied, for purposes of their diametrically opposed conclusions, on the often-quoted dictum of the Permanent Court of International Justice in the *Chorz\u00f3w Factory* case.\n\n583.\n\nBefore it sets out the parties' Additional Submissions and its conclusions on what should or should not be excluded from the Claimants' damages on account of the Farmout Agreement, the Tribunal considers it useful to quote this dictum and then summarize the parties' different interpretations of it.\n\n584.\n\nThe *dictum* reads as follows:\n\nOn approaching this question, it should first be observed that, in estimating the damage caused by an unlawful act, only the value of property, rights and interests which have been affected and the owner of which is the person on whose behalf compensation is claimed, or the damage done to whom is to serve as a means of gauging the reparation claimed, must be taken into account. This principle, which is accepted in the jurisprudence of arbitral tribunals, has the effect, on the one hand, of excluding from the damage to be estimated, injury resulting for third parties from the unlawful act and, on the other hand, of not excluding from the damage the amount of debts and other obligations for which the injured party is responsible. The damage suffered by the Oberschlesische in respect of the Chorz\u00f3w undertaking is therefore equivalent to the total value - but to that total only - of the property, rights and interests of this Company in that undertaking, without deducting liabilities.76 (Emphasis added)\n\n*Case concerning the Factory at Chorz\u00f3w* (Claim for Indemnity) (Merits), P.C.I.J. Series A, No. 17 (Judgement of 13 September 1928) at page 31.\n\n***(b) The Respondent's Interpretation***\n-----------------------------------------\n\n585.\n\nThe Respondent starts by reiterating the *Chorz\u00f3w* principle and contends that it should be applied in the present case:\n\nThe *Chorz\u00f3w* principle is fully applicable in the present case. Claimants' damage is restricted to the *personal and actual loss* of revenue arising from the loss of their investment. Since Claimants, following the Farmout Agreement, only benefited from 60% profits from Block 15, their damage is restricted to that loss corresponding to their economic interest in Block 15. (Emphasis in original)\n\n586.\n\nThe Respondent insists on the fact that, as explicitly provided by Article 2.02 of the Farmout Agreement, OEPC was only \"entitled to the rights and benefits attributable to such remaining 60% interest\" upon closing. Moreover, OEPC could not, even before *caducidad*, have sold 100% of the rights to a willing buyer, as 40% had already been paid and acquired by AEC. It follows, says the Respondent, that \"[b]ecause [...] AEC paid due consideration to OEPC for the former's acquisition of a 40% economic interest in Block 15, OEPC would be unjustly enriched if it now received, in addition, damages representing 100% the fair market value of the Participation Contract.\"\n\n587.\n\nThe Respondent adds that even if the Tribunal were to follow the Claimants' contention that \"AEC acquired no more than a contractual right against OEPC to receive from OEPC 40% of Block 15 production,\" this would be characterized as an investment since under Article 1c) of the Ecuador-China BIT, an \"investment\" includes money claims and any entitlement of economic value. On this point, the Respondent accordingly submits:\n\n[...] As a result, AEC/Andes' 40% economic interest is an investment different from Claimants' investment. Such investment is not protected by the Treaty because it does not belong to United States companies or nationals. As to OEPC, it can only claim, on its own behalf, the value of its reduced investment.\n\nConsequently, as Ecuador explained in its last submission, *caducidad* affected two investments from two separate investors. Would *caducidad* to be found to be in breach of Ecuador's international obligations, the investors could claim compensation, separately, for their own personal damage.\n\n588.\n\nIn the Respondent's view, the concept of a \"Farmout Liability\" was entirely invented by the Claimants for the sake of advancing their position:\n\nClaimants, in order to benefit from the principle set forth by the *Chorz\u00f3w* case (providing that liabilities should not be deducted from the injured party's damages), have simply invented the concept of a \"Farmout Liability\" which would continue to be due to AEC/Andes after *caducidad*. Claimants have failed to point to a single clause of the Farmout Agreement establishing such a liability.\n\n589.\n\nIn sum, the Respondent considers that OEPC, having transferred 40% of its rights to AEC pursuant to the Farmout Agreement, can only claim for the 60% remaining rights it held at the moment of *caducidad*.\n\n***(c) The Claimants' Interpretation***\n---------------------------------------\n\n590.\n\nThe Claimants summarized their position in the following manner, consistent, according to them, with the Permanent Court of International Justice's dictum:\n\nIt is settled international law that contractual obligations and liabilities for which the injured party remains responsible must not be excluded from its compensable damages. Only when a third party has a right of ownership in the investment, the compensable damage must be reduced to the extent of that third party's ownership right.\n\n591.\n\nBased on this theoretical framework, the Claimants added that there are only two salient questions for the Tribunal, *i.e.* :\n\n(a) Whether the Farmout Liability is in the nature of a contractual obligation of OEPC vis-\u00e0-vis AEC (as opposed to a right of ownership of AEC in the Participation Contract with Ecuador or the Block 15 oil);\n\nand\n\n(b) Whether OEPC continued to have the Farmout Liability after *caducidad* and through the present.\n\n592.\n\nIn response to these questions, the Claimants argue that AEC did not, as a result of the Farmout Agreement, acquire actual legal title or actual ownership in the Participation Contract. Rather, it only acquired \"a contractual right to claim a certain share of production from OEPC.\" And they add that this contractual liability of OEPC towards AEC remained with OEPC after *caducidad*.\n\n593.\n\nMoreover, the Claimants submit that even if the Tribunal were to conclude that AEC is the beneficial owner of 40% of the rights and interests in the Participation Contract, this would be of no consequence given that there is no principle of international law, say the Claimants, that limits standing to \"beneficial owners.\" They maintain that the Respondent's claim that only the beneficial owner of an investment can claim damages under international law is irrelevant given that OEPC is the owner of 100% of the rights under the Participation Contract.\n\n594.\n\nThe Claimants accordingly conclude that they are entitled to the entire fair market value of the Participation Contract.\n\n***3. The Parties' Additional Submissions***\n--------------------------------------------\n\n595.\n\nOn 6 October 2011, during the Tribunal's deliberations, the President, on behalf of the Tribunal, wrote to the parties as follows:\n\nMembers of the Tribunal continue their intense deliberations. The Tribunal regrets that its decision has taken longer to finalize than it would have wished. However, the parties have submitted to the Tribunal, in their extensive written and oral submissions, a myriad of factual and legal issues which all need to be analyzed and determined. The Tribunal is confident that its deliberations will end soon and a decision issued shortly thereafter.\n\nIn recent days, the Tribunal has been addressing an issue which, in its view, neither party has dealt with comprehensively in its prior submissions. The issue concerns the interpretation of the Farmout Agreement and the Joint Operating Agreement.\n\nThe Respondent submits (Counter-Memorial on Quantum, para 43; Post-Hearing Brief on Damages, para 127) that the calculation of damages (if any) to be awarded to the Claimants in the circumstances must be limited to a 60% interest in Block 15 because of the transfer by the Claimants to AEC under the terms of the Farmout Agreement of 40% of their interest under the Participation Contract. The Claimants do not accept the Respondent's contention (Reply on Damages, paras 207-208; Post-Hearing Brief on Damages, para 15).\n\nThe governing law clause of the Farmout Agreement provides:\n\n\"This Agreement shall be governed by and construed, interpreted and applied in accordance with the laws of the State of New York, United States of America, excluding any choice of law rules or conflict of law principles which would refer the matter to the laws of another jurisdiction, except to the extent that the laws of Ecuador require application of the laws of Ecuador to the Participating Agreements and Block 15 or other property situated in or operations or activities conducted in Ecuador.\"\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the Claimants argued that the transfer of the \"economic interest\" to AEC would not be considered an assignment under New York law and that, as a result, the non-assignment clause in Article 16(1) of the Participation Contract was not breached (Memorial on Liability, para 244). Accordingly, the Claimants did not analyze the effect and validity of an assignment, (assuming an assignment had indeed occurred as a result of the Farmout Agreement and the Joint Operating Agreement), in breach of Article 16(1) of the Participation Contract and Article 79 of the Hydrocarbons Law. In addition, the Claimants did not analyze Ecuadorian and New York law in this regard.\n\nThe Tribunal further notes that the Respondent argued that New York law is irrelevant to the issue of whether an assignment under the Farmout Agreement and the Joint Operating Agreement (if any) is in breach of Ecuadorian law (CounterMemorial on Liability, para 185).\n\nIn sum, neither party, in their quantum submissions, referred to the effect of Article 79 of the Hydrocarbons Law or Article 16(1) of the Participation Contract on the assumption that an assignment of rights occurred as a result of the Farmout Agreement and the Joint Operating Agreement.\n\nThe Tribunal now invites the parties to assume that an assignment of rights did occur as a result of the Farmout Agreement and the Joint Operating Agreement. On the basis of this assumption, the parties are requested to undertake a detailed analysis of the effect of an assignment of rights made under a contract governed by New York law (i.e. the Farmout Agreement and the Joint Operating Agreement) in violation of a non-assignment clause set forth in a contract governed by Ecuadorian law (i.e. Article 16(1) of the Participation Contract) and in violation of Article 79 of the Hydrocarbons Law. The parties are further requested to address both New York law and Ecuadorian law and to make submissions accordingly, even if one or both parties may consider that, for any reason, New York law and/or Ecuadorian law may not be relevant to the determination of the effect of the Farmout Agreement and the Joint Operating Agreement.\n\n596.\n\nPursuant to the Tribunal's directions, the parties, on 3 November and 22 November 2011, provided the Tribunal with their respective simultaneous written submissions to the above. These submissions are now summarized.\n\n***(a) The Respondent's Additional Submissions***\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n597.\n\nIn its Additional Submissions, the Respondent expressed the view that, under both Ecuadorian and New York law, its contention that the Claimants would only be entitled to 60% of the claimed damages remains valid. The Respondent contends that the nullity provided for in Article 79 of the HCL does not apply *de pleno derecho* (automatically). Instead, Article 1699 of the Ecuadorian Civil Code requires a judicial declaration to effect that absolute nullity. The Respondent submits that no one has requested that the nullity provided for in Article 79 be declared and no judge has made such a declaration. It provided the following translations of Articles 1698 and 1699, as well as citing a number of cases which, in its view, confirm the principles contended:\n\n1698: \". the nullity produced by the omission of any requirement or formality which the law demands for certain acts and contract to be valid, in consideration to their nature, and not to the quality or status of the persons who execute or agree to them, are absolute nullities\"\n\n1699: \"The absolute nullity can and shall be declared by the judge, even if nor party so requests, when it manifestly arises from the act or contract; it may be claimed by anyone having an interest to do so, excepting those who have performed the act or contract knowing or under the duty to know the vice invalidating it; it may also be claimed by the Public Ministry, for the benefit of morals or of the law; and it cannot be cured by ratification of the parties, nor by the passing of a period of time of less than fifteen years.\"\n\n598.\n\nThe Respondent's position is that the nullity provided for in Article 79 is merely a defence that could be raised should Andes or AEC pursue claims against it. However, if declared, it would operate retroactively to void the transfer *ex tunc.* The Respondent notes that the Claimants, as the party who has performed the act or contract knowing, or being under a duty to know, the vice invalidating it, cannot request that the nullity be declared.\n\n599.\n\nWhile addressing New York and Ecuadorian law, the Respondent states that neither law is relevant to calculating the amount of damages (if any) due to the Claimants which can only be determined under international law. The Respondent therefore reiterated its submissions on the application of international law to the question of damages. In particular, the Respondent stresses that no willing buyer would have paid a price based on 100% of the fair market value of Block 15. Therefore, the Claimants' interests in Block 15 amounted to 60% of its fair market value, and any losses thus also only amount to 60% of the value. The Claimants' cannot claim any losses suffered by Andes or AEC.\n\n600.\n\nThe Respondent also reiterates its argument that compensating the Claimants on the basis of 100% of fair market value would result in unjust enrichment, as the Claimants had already been paid for a 40% interest in Block 15 and would consequently be paid twice. In addition, the Respondent points to the international law principle that would not allow the Claimants to take advantage of their own wrongdoing.\n\n601.\n\nTurning to New York law, the Respondent maintains that there is no requirement that would oblige a New York court to render the Claimants' illegal assignment void. The Respondent asserts that the New York courts would not ignore the governing law clause and would therefore acknowledge that Ecuadorian law governs the Participation Contract, Block 15 and operations in Ecuador. However, it also contends that under New York law (i) an illegal assignment or contract is not automatically void, (ii) the Claimants would be prevented from benefitting from their own wrongdoing (citing *Southwestern Shipping Corp. v. National City Bank* 6 NY.2d 454), and (iii) contract invalidation is not self-executing and therefore requires a judicial pronouncement which has not been obtained. In addition, the Respondent considers that New York courts are reluctant to invalidate contracts that reflect the free will of the parties on the basis of illegality under foreign law and cites *Peregrine Myanmar Ltd. v. Segal* 89 F.3d 41 in support.\n\n602.\n\nIn response to the Claimants' submissions on New York law, the Respondent suggests that New York courts have interpreted \"void\" to mean \"voidable,\" citing *Lynbrook v. Cadoo* 252 NY 308 and *St. George Seaport Assoc. v. CSX Realty Inc.* 1991 US Dist LEXIS 15463.\n\n603.\n\nFinally, the Respondent notes that Article 79 of the HCL and Clause 16 of the Participation Contract cannot be viewed in isolation and the *Caducidad* provisions must be taken into account when considering the overall position. In relation to this, the Respondent rejects the Claimants' set-off proposal, stating that the options available to it following an unauthorized assignment are to declare *Caducidad* or do nothing.\n\n***(b) The Claimants' Additional Submissions***\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n604.\n\nIn their Additional Submissions, the Claimants assert that under both Ecuadorian and New York law, an unauthorized assignment would be null and void or without effect and, consequently, the Claimants continue to own 100% of the value of Block 15.\n\n605.\n\nThis assertion is based on the application of Article 79 of the HCL. The Claimants draw on the expert evidence and the parties' submissions to demonstrate agreement that the consequence of Article 79 is that the transfer \"does not exist\" and has no legal effect. The Claimants also point out that the *Caducidad* Decree itself states that, under Articles 9 and 10 of Ecuador's Civil Code, acts prohibited by law are null.\n\n606.\n\nThe Claimants contend that the nullity imposed by Article 79 is automatic and mandatory. They reject the Respondent's contention that a judicial declaration is required to effect the nullity. The Claimants consider that Article 79 imposes an \"essential element\" of the solemn formality of a public deed that is required to give \"life\" to the agreement and that, without Ministerial authorization, the transfer would be considered automatically \"inexistent\".\n\n607.\n\nIn relation to New York law, the Claimants' position is that a New York court would apply Ecuadorian law under the governing law clause of the Farmout Agreement and consequently find that no assignment had occurred. The Claimants also note that a New York court would invalidate an assignment if it purports to assign rights that are subject to a non-assignment clause (citing *Allhusen v. Caristo Const. Corp.* 303 NY 446 and a number of other cases as authority). As Clause 16.1 contained a non-assignment provision, the Claimants assert that New York law would not recognize an assignment in breach of this clause.\n\n608.\n\nThe Claimants point out that while any assignment may be invalid under New York and Ecuadorian law, any other provisions in the Farmout and Operating Agreements remain in effect between OEPC and AEC, citing both New York law authorities and Article 8.05 of the Farmout Agreement in support of this position.\n\n609.\n\nThe Claimants also maintain that, regardless of the effectiveness of any assignment, there is no contractual privity between AEC and Ecuador, meaning that AEC could never recover its losses from Ecuador. All AEC has ever owned are contractual rights against OEPC, and any action for the recovery of loss can only be brought against OEPC. As such, the Claimants insist that they remained at all times the 100% owner of the Participation Contract and responsible for all obligations thereunder. Consequently, under international law, the Claimants consider that they are entitled to receive as damages 100% of the contract value The Claimants also reiterate earlier submissions regarding the effect of the *Chorzow* case on the effect of private contractual rights held by third parties and rejected the Respondent's position on the application of international law.\n\n610.\n\nFinally, the Claimants emphasize that awarding 100% of the damages claimed would not result in a windfall for the Claimants, as they remain liable to account for 40% of any compensation to Andes under the February 2006 Andes Letter Agreement. In response to the Respondent's argument that they had already been paid for a 40% interest, the Claimants state that they have only received payment for oil delivered and not for future oil. Rather, according to the Claimants, an award of less than 100% would unjustly enrich the Respondent who seized 100% of the operations and would leave the Claimants \"woefully short\" as they would still have to account to Andes.\n\n611.\n\nThe Claimants suggest that Article 79(2) means that Ecuador is entitled to set-off an amount equal to a transfer fee, a second fee in lieu of renegotiation of the contract, and a fine for non-compliance with a contractual and statutory requirement. The Claimants contend that this amount would be between US$1,071,000 and US$11,771,000.\n\n***4. The Tribunal's Analysis and Conclusion***\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n***(a) Introduction***\n----------------------\n\n612.\n\nThe Tribunal has considered very carefully the extensive learned written and oral submissions of both parties on this issue, including the Additional Submissions provided in November 2011 and the representations made to the Tribunal at the hearing in London on 12 April 2012.\n\n613.\n\nThe Tribunal will now deal with the central issue which, in its view, after the parties' arguments have been stripped of their complex legal ramifications, comes down to the following: does the execution by OEPC of the Farmout Agreement with AEC on 1 October 2000 (together with the Joint Operating Agreement) allow Ecuador, following *caducidad*, to compensate OEPC for 60% only of its interest in Block 15 or is it legally obliged to compensate OEPC for 100% of its interest in Block 15, being precisely what it has acquired upon the issuance of the *Caducidad* Decree?\n\n614.\n\nIn other words, the key issue to be addressed in this section is whether any assignment to AEC of the 40% beneficial interest in Block 15 was actually effected by the Farmout Agreements (i.e., the Farmout Agreement and the Joint Operating Agreement) or whether any such purported assignment was void and therefore without legal effect. If the former, OEPC would be entitled to recover 100% of the established value of Block 15 under the relevant principles of international law; if the latter, it could recover 60% only.77\n\nUnder International law, the owner of a beneficial interest in contractual rights is able to bring its own claim for compensation. Where the beneficial interest has been transferred, the nationality of the Claimant will be tested by reference to the beneficial owner, rather than the nominal owner of the legal title (see *Saghi v. The Islamic Republic of Iran* Case No. 298, 29-Iran.U.S.CT.R. \u00a7\u00a718-26).\n\n615.\n\nBefore considering this issue, it is apposite to repeat the governing law clause (clause 7.02) of the Farmout Agreement:\n\nThis Agreement shall be governed by and construed, interpreted and applied in accordance with the laws of the State of New York, United States of America, excluding any choice of law rules or conflict of law principles which would refer the matter to the laws of another jurisdiction, except to the extent that the laws of Ecuador require application of the laws of Ecuador to the Participating Agreements and Block 15 or other property situated in or operations or activities conducted in Ecuador.\n\n616.\n\nConsequently, in determining this issue, the Tribunal must consider whether a valid assignment of an equitable interest took place under the Farmout Agreement by reference to both New York law and the Ecuadorian law applicable to the Participation Contract. Both parties acknowledge that this was the correct approach.78 In this light, the Tribunal must then consider the relevant contractual provisions, including the nonassignment clause in Clause 16.1 of the Participation Contract. The Tribunal notes that, as mentioned by the Respondent in its Additional Submissions, while the application of New York and Ecuadorian law is relevant to whether the assignment was valid, domestic law is not relevant to the subsequent determination of compensation which is governed by international law, as set out below.\n\nSee Claimants\u2019 Brief, 3 November 2011, paras 15-17 and Respondent\u2019s Brief, 3 November 2011, paragraphs 55-57.\n\n***(b) Ecuadorian Law***\n------------------------\n\n617.\n\nThe Tribunal first considers whether the assignment was valid under Ecuadorian law. In this connection, the Tribunal recalls the terms of Clause 16.1 of the Participation Contract. It reads as follows:\n\n\"Transfer of this Participation Contract or assignment to third parties of the rights under the Participation Contract, must have the authorization of the Corresponding Ministry, in accordance with existing laws and regulations, especially the provisions contained in Art. 79 of the Hydrocarbons Law and Executive Decrees No. 809, 2713 and 1179.\" (Emphasis added)\n\n618.\n\nThe laws of Ecuador require the application of the HCL to the Participation Contract, including the application of Article 79 to any assignment of rights under that Contract. Article 79 states:\n\nArt. 79. The transfer of a contract or the assignment to third parties of rights derived from a contract shall be null and void and shall have no validity whatsoever if there is no prior authorization from the Ministry of Energy and Mines, without prejudice to the declaration of *caducidad* as provided for in this Law.... (Emphasis added)\n\n619.\n\nAs clause 7.02 of the Farmout Agreement expressly includes the laws of Ecuador to the extent that they require application \"to the Participating Agreements and Block 15,\" it is evident that Article 79 of the HCL must be taken into account when determining whether a valid assignment occurred under the Farmout Agreement. The HCL categorically states that any assignment of rights under the Participation Contract is null and void and shall have no validity whatsoever unless authorized by the Ministry of Energy and Mines. On its face, therefore, the assignment that purportedly occurred under the Farmout Agreement was invalid. The assignment therefore had no legal effect and OEPC retained 100% of both the legal and beneficial ownership of all rights in the Participation Contract. As noted further below, Article 79 of the HCL serves to invalidate the assignment, not the Farmout Agreement itself which remains a valid contract as between OEPC and AEC.\n\n619(bis).\n\nThere are two further points to stress with regard to the application of Article 79. The first is that the invalidity of any purported assignment does not affect the right of the State to declare *caducidad*. In other words, the breach identified in paragraphs 301 to 339 above still occurred, even if the assignment itself is deemed invalid. The second point is that Article 79 of the HCL is concerned with the legal effect of the assignment itself; it does not purport to invalidate either the Farmout Agreement under which OEPC had an obligation to obtain any necessary government approvals for the assignment or the Joint Operating Agreement.\n\n620.\n\nIn its Additional Submission of 3 November 2011, the Respondent stated that under Articles 1698 and 1699 of the Ecuadorian Civil Code, the lack of ministerial authorization for the assignment created an \"absolute nullity\" which requires a judicial declaration in order to have effect. In other words, the assignment is not null and void until an Ecuadorian judge has declared it so. At the hearing of 12 April 2012, the Respondent reiterated this submission with much emphasis.79\n\nHearing Transcript (12 April 2012) in particular at pages 25-51.\n\n621.\n\nThe Claimants, in their Reply Submission of 22 November 2011, stated that the assignment lacked an essential element required for \"life\" and was therefore \"inexistent\" under the doctrine of \"ineffectiveness\" articulated by the Ecuadorian Supreme Court. As such, no judicial declaration was required. At the hearing of 12 April 2012, the Claimants reiterated their submission with no less emphasis.80\n\nHearing Transcript (12 April 2012) in particular at pages 134-175.\n\n622.\n\nAlthough not expressly stated in the Ecuadorian Civil Code, the Ecuadorian Supreme Court has confirmed on a number of occasions that Ecuadorian law recognizes automatic nullity or \"inexistence\". It is common ground between the parties that when the Ecuadorian Supreme Court has issued three consistent decisions on a precise point, the law on that point is considered settled and becomes binding on lower courts. It becomes what, in some jurisdictions, is referred to as a \"jurisprudence constante.\"\n\n623.\n\nThe Tribunal, in the present case, has been referred to more than three decisions of the Ecuadorian Supreme Court where the concept of automatic nullity or inexistence was judicially recognized.81 Although the Respondent averred that the \"inexistence\" category applied only to a limited body of real estate transactions requiring the execution of a public deed, as discussed below, there is nothing in the general definitions set out in the case law to support such a narrow application of \"inexistence\".\n\nIn fact, the Tribunal was referred to four decisions. The Tribunal notes that it was supplied by the parties with English translations of these four decisions. There was never any dispute between the parties as to the accuracy of these translations. See CA-662 (Drs. Galo Galarza Paz, Santiago Andrado Ubidia, and Ernesto Alban Gomez), CA-660 (Drs. Galo Galarza Paz, Santiago Andrado Ubidia, and Ernesto Alban Gomez), CA-658 (Drs. Bolivar Guerrero Armijos, Olmedo Bermeo Idrovo and Bolivar Vergara Acosta), CA-659 (Drs. Galo Galarza Paz, Santiago Andrado Ubidia, and Ernesto Alban Gomez).\n\n624.\n\nOf the four cases presented to the Tribunal on this issue, the most extensive - and in the Tribunal's view, the most useful - discussion of the categories of ineffectiveness is contained in the Supreme Court decision of 16 May 2001.82 This was the first and seminal discussion of this doctrine in the cases provided to the Tribunal. This case is particularly important as the Supreme Court sets out in its own words the difference between the categories of inexistence, absolute nullity and relative nullity, and summarises Ecuadorian doctrine on the matter. In this decision the Court states:\n\n\"This Chamber has examined on several occasions the question relating to the ineffectiveness of a juridical act. The doctrine distinguishes three types of ineffectiveness: 1. Maximum ineffectiveness or inexistence, when the act does not have the essential requirements for it to have a life. The inexistent act cannot be cured and does not need to be invalidated; 2. absolute nullity, when the act is capable of producing some effects in certain special conditions. There is an appearance of act until its nullity is declared. Absolute nullity cannot be cured but must be invalidated, i.e., declared; 3. relative nullity, which implies that the act is said to be valid and is only invalidated as of the day on which it is voided. The relatively void act can be validated.\"83\n\nCA-662.\n\nSupreme Court of Ecuador, 16 May 2001 at page 1528. CA-662 (Claimants\u2019 translation of RLA-348). (Emphasis added.)\n\n625.\n\nThe question before this Tribunal is whether the assignment falls within the first category (inexistence) or the second category (absolute nullity). As Article 79 of the HCL is clear that there is no possibility of retrospective cure, the third category of \"relative nullity\" cannot apply, nor did either party suggest otherwise.\n\n626.\n\nIt is the Tribunal\u2019s view that the intended assignment that occurred under the Farmout Agreement and the Joint Operating Agreement undoubtedly meets the criteria expressed in the above quotations for \"inexistence\". Article 79 of the HCL is key - it stipulates that ministerial authorization is an essential element to give life to any assignment of rights in the Participation Contract - without this authorization, an assignment has \"no validity whatsoever\". Indeed, counsel for the Respondent admitted that this authorization was an \"essential requirement\" during the 12 April 2012 hearing, although in the Respondent\u2019s submission, it was not one that constituted inexistence.84 Where the law itself stipulates that an act has \"no validity whatsoever\" there is no need on its face for the assignment to be declared invalid by a judge, because it could never be valid in the first place - it lacked an essential element required for life. Therefore, both elements of \"ineffectiveness\" identified by the Supreme Court have been satisfied: the attempted assignment (1) lacked an essential element required to give it life; and (2) as noted above, this defect cannot be cured.\n\nHearing Transcript (12 April 2012), page 32 line 22 to page 33 line 2.\n\n627.\n\nIn the same 16 May 2001 decision, the Supreme Court held that inexistence applied because the contract was not executed using the required form (a public deed). In supporting its decision the Court quoted Columbian scholars who have stated that required elements for life in the context of contracts are \"expressed will, the consent, an object, and the solemn form.\"85 Although the Respondent attempted to argue that the Farmout Agreements did not fall within any of these criteria, it failed to appreciate that it is not the contracts - the Farmout Agreements or the Joint Operating Agreement - that are at issue here. The issue is the validity of the assignment sought to be accomplished by these Agreements. Therefore applying a contractual analysis is inappropriate. Instead, this Tribunal must consider the essential elements for the assignment to have life in the present circumstances.\n\nSupreme Court of Ecuador, 16 May 2001 at page 1529. CA-662 (Claimants' translation of RLA-348).\n\n628.\n\nAs noted above, Article 79 of the HCL is categorical in expressing, not only the illegal act, but also the consequence of the illegality. Significantly, a similar provision (Article 1745 of the Civil Code) was being applied by the Supreme Court in the above case (and in others discussed below). Article 1745 provides that, where the law requires a public deed, contracts signed in another form \"will be deemed as non-executed or signed\". Thus, the consequence of the illegality is specified. The result of the Court's decision that such contracts are \"inexistent\" is that Article 1745 is given effect without the need for a judicial declaration. In other words, where the law itself clearly states that the contract is deemed to be unexecuted, and therefore has no life, there is no requirement for judicial confirmation. Similarly, under Article 79, the law itself has deemed that an unauthorised assignment has no validity whatsoever, and therefore has no life. The logical consequence of this provision is that no further action is required to invalidate an unauthorised assignment.\n\n629.\n\nThis should be the end of the analysis. However, for completeness, the Tribunal notes that it also does not accept the Respondent's characterisation of \"absolute nullity\" as meaning that the assignment is essentially effective (or valid) until declared invalid by a judge. Not only would such a finding leave this Tribunal in direct contravention of Article 79 of the HCL, it is clear from the case law presented to the Tribunal that an action subject to absolute nullity cannot produce a \"valid\" act. As noted above, the 16 May 2001 decision states that \"there is an appearance of act until nullity is declared.\"86 In other words, no actual act has occurred - only the appearance of an act. This is consistent with the notion that an absolute nullity cannot be cured and the requirement in Art 1699 of the Civil Code that a judge \"shall\" declare the nullity (i.e., there is no discretion).\n\nSupreme Court of Ecuador, 16 May 2001 at page 1528. CA-662 (Claimants' Translation RLA-348).\n\n630.\n\nIn a further decision of the Ecuadorian Supreme Court dated 29 August 2001,87 the Court (being comprised of the same three judges that decided the 16 May 2001 case) endorsed its definition of inexistence provided in the above decision, noting (as it did in the 16 May 2001 decision) that inexistence occurs where \"the act lacks the essential requirements in order for it to have life and, therefore, cannot be validated, nor does it need to be invalidated.\"88 The language used is identical to the 16 May 2001 decision.\n\nCA-660.\n\nSupreme Court of Ecuador, 29 August 2001 at page 22. CA-660. (Emphasis added)\n\n631.\n\nIn the 29 August 2001 case, the parties had agreed to terminate a \"promise to purchase\" agreement, but the Court held that the promise to purchase agreement had not been properly executed as was therefore \"inexistent.\" As such, the parties were unable to terminate it. In relation to absolute nullity, the Court quoted one of its earlier decisions, stating that:\n\n\"In the same way, if a Judge accepts the validity of a mutual dissent... pertaining to a null contract, he would be providing effectiveness to that contract, since that is why parties could avail themselves of the rights produced by it if it were valid, but by acting in this way the judge would have violated section 10 of the Civil Code, which says: \"In no case may the Judge declare valid an act that the law decrees to be null and void.\" It should be noted, in order to avoid confusion, that this is different from the situation of contracts that are possibly and relatively null... Likewise, if a legal act suffers from absolute nullity, even though it enjoys the semblance of validity with regard to third parties while there is no enforceable judgment declaring its nullity, however the act lacks its structural elements, thereby the legal effects it was intended to produce had it been signed in a valid manner, are not produced \".89\n\nThe last underlined passage is dispositive of the issue in this case if absolute nullity were to apply.\n\nSupreme Court of Ecuador, 29 August 2001 at page 23. CA-660. (Emphasis added)\n\n632.\n\nThis decision makes it clear that a null act produces no legal effects, even before a judicial declaration is obtained. As such, an agreement to assign without authorisation produces no actual assignment and a judicial declaration does not reverse the assignment - a valid assignment never occurred. There is only an \"appearance of an act\" until a judicial declaration is issued. This may lead to a \"semblance of validity with regard to third parties\". These statements reinforce the conclusion that no actual assignment occurred and that OEPC remained the owner of 100% of all rights in the Participation Contract, regardless of its agreement to assign a 40% beneficial interested to AEC. Hence, pursuant to Article 79 of the HCL, an unauthorised assignment had \"no validity whatsoever\", even under the absolute nullity doctrine.\n\n633.\n\nArticle 10 of the Civil Code quoted in the above passage from the 29 August 2001 case is notable: \"In no case may the Judge declare valid an act that the law decrees to be null and void.\" If this Tribunal were to award only 60% compensation as requested by the Respondent, it would be acting in direct contravention of this Article by treating as valid an act that the law decrees to be null and void. The very wording of Article 10 demonstrates that the Ecuadorian authorities specifically contemplated situations like the present case - where the law itself (not a judge) decrees something to be null and void.\n\n634.\n\nIn summary, it is clear from the case law that, regardless of whether the assignment falls into the category of \"inexistent\" or whether it falls into the category of \"absolute nullity\", no valid assignment occurred and OEPC remained the 100% owner of all rights in the Participation Contract. This conclusion is consistent with the application of the HCL.\n\n635.\n\nThe parties also provided the Tribunal with the Supreme Court decisions of 7 June 2001 and 20 February 2002,90 both of which affirm but discuss only briefly the categories of \"inexistence\" and \"absolute nullity\", doubtless because the Court had firmly established the principles relating to inexistence in its decision of 16 May 2001. Both cases relate to real estate contracts and therefore focus on the formal requirements for executing such contracts. For the avoidance of doubt, as noted above, the Tribunal reiterates that in the present case it is the validity of the assignment that is under scrutiny, and not the validity of the Farmout Agreement or the Joint Operating Agreement. The Tribunal\u2019s findings on the validity of the assignment do not affect other obligations that might arise between the parties to the Farmout Agreement and the Joint Operating Agreement (such parties being different to those in the present arbitration), nor does it affect the ability of AEC to seek damages from OEPC for a failure to comply with the terms of those Agreements, such as obtaining necessary government consent for the assignment.91\n\nCA-658 and CA-659.\n\nAs events have unfolded, AEC has no need to pursue this option in virtue of the agreement it reached with OEPC which is referred to in paragraph 655 below.\n\n636.\n\nIt is important to stress that the Tribunal\u2019s analysis of the position under Ecuadorian law is consistent with the position of both parties prior to the Additional Submissions. It is clear to the Tribunal that, prior to the Additional Submissions, not only the Claimants92 but also the Respondent and all of its legal experts on Ecuadorian law considered that any unauthorized assignment would have no legal effect whatsoever (i.e., would be automatically void). Indeed, in its closing oral submissions at the March 2009 hearing, counsel for the Respondent contended that \"[Article 79] *says that... the* *assignment to third parties of rights derived from a contract shall be null and void, and shall have no validity whatsoever if there is no prior authorisation from the Ministry. If this. unauthorized transfer is null and void, that means that it does not exist. It does not produce legal effects*.\"93\n\nSee, *inter alia,* Professor Hern\u00e1n P\u00e9rez Loose, Fifth Expert Report, at page 18, paragraph 34.\n\nHearing Transcript (20 March 2009) at pages 200 and 201. See also at pages 204 and 205.\n\n637.\n\nOn the following day, the Respondent again repeated that \" *... if there is no authorization, then there is no transfer.*.,\"94 confirming precisely what it had affirmed in its Reply Memorial on Liability that \".. *. such a transfer*  *will simply be deemed* *null and void*  *as a matter of Ecuadorian law* *\"95* (Emphasis added) Attempts during the 12 April 2012 hearing by the Respondent's counsel to explain these statements as referring to retrospective nullity (that is, the transfer would be null retrospectively if so declared by a judge) were wholly unpersuasive.96\n\nHearing Transcript (21 March 2009) at page 37.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial on Liability and Counterclaim (16 June 2008) at page 66, footnote 260.\n\nHearing Transcript (12 April 2012) at pages 140-145 and 203.\n\n638.\n\nMoreover, the Respondent\u2019s main legal experts on Ecuadorian law, at the earlier stages of this arbitration, also opined that any unauthorized assignment would be automatically void and have no legal effect whatsoever.\n\n639.\n\nProfessor Aguilar, in one of his reports, stated categorically that \"for the assignment to have legal effect, the Hydrocarbon law establishes an additional requirement to those set forth in the civil legislation: the ministerial authorization.\"97 In the same report, he also stated that \"the Hydrocarbon Law establishes that absent the ministerial authorization, the rights assignment contract lacks value, regardless of whether the title has been delivered or not\" and that the \"contract... does not produce effects due to a lack of authorization from the relevant Ministry.\"98 During his oral evidence, he testified that the \"transfer of rights is null, undoubtedly.\"99\n\nFourth Aguilar Expert Report (English translation) (19 September 2008) at page 10, paragraph 31.\n\n*Ibid*, at p. 10, paragraphs 32 and 33.\n\nHearing Transcript (19 December 2008) at page 1586.\n\n640.\n\nProfessor Merlo, another one of the Respondent\u2019s expert on Ecuadorian law, was no less categorical on this issue when he gave evidence before the Tribunal. Answering in Spanish, his native tongue, he stated \" *Y*  ***m\u00e1s a\u00fan***  *el*  ***art\u00edculo***  *79 dice que no tiene ning\u00fan valor, se declara nulo,*  *de pleno derecho* *\"100* (Emphasis added)\n\n*Ibid* (Spanish) at page 1586 (Translation: \"Particularly Article 79 says that it has no value. It is declared null and void as a matter of law,\" at page 1513 of the English Hearing Transcript (19 December 2008)).\n\n641.\n\nThe Tribunal further notes that, in its Submission of 3 November 2011, the Respondent translates \"automatic\" as \" *de pleno derecho* \".101\n\nRespondent's 3 November 2011 Submission, at page 22, paragraph 5.2\n\n642.\n\nThe Tribunal also notes, as stressed by the Claimants at the 12 April 2012 hearing, that most of these opinions of the Respondent and its experts \" *were not taken in the heat of argument, extemporaneously or by way of improvisation*.\"102 While this in no way rises to the level of an estoppel, it does, to a certain extent, undermine the credibility of the position which Ecuador later adopted on this crucial issue when the matter was the subject of further attention by the Tribunal. That final position of the Respondent was summarized succinctly in its written submissions of 3 November 2011 as follows: \" *Ecuadorian law has not adopted the notion of \"inexistence\" of acts or contracts*.\"103\n\nHearing Transcript (12 April 2012) at page 141.\n\nRespondent's Brief of 3 November 2011 at page 24, paragraph 79.\n\n643.\n\nIt is clear to the Tribunal that the Respondent's position prior to November 2011 is flatly inconsistent with the Respondent's later argument that a judicial declaration is required to nullify the unauthorized assignment. The Tribunal does not consider that this later argument is correct. Its earlier position - that the assignment is automatically invalid as a matter of Ecuadorian law - is consistent with the both the statutory evidence and the case law presented to the Tribunal. Article 79 of the HCL is clear that any unauthorized assignment is null and void and shall have no validity whatsoever.\n\n644.\n\nMoreover, at a general level, it seems that Ecuadorian law would not in any case recognise that an assignment has occurred unless relevant conditions precedent (such as required consents) had been fulfilled. In this regard, the Tribunal recalls the evidence of the Claimants' expert on Ecuadorian law, Dr Hern\u00e1n P\u00e9rez Loose, who opined:\n\nThe transfer or assignment of legal title was necessarily and inexorably subject to fulfilment of a condition precedent [i.e. authorisation from the Ministry]. Under Ecuadorian law, while the condition precedent is pending, the right affected by said type is not even given legal effect, since the obligee only has a legitimate expectation of acquiring it, obviously if the condition is confirmed.104\n\nProf. Hern\u00e1n P\u00e9rez Loose, Fifth Expert Report, at page 18, paragraph 34.\n\n***(c) New York Law***\n----------------------\n\n645.\n\nAs noted above, by virtue of the governing law clause of the Farmout Agreement, and as acknowledged by the parties, New York law is also relevant to the interpretation of the Farmout Agreement and therefore as to whether a valid assignment took place. The Tribunal considers that the application of New York law results in exactly the same conclusion as the application of Ecuadorian law. First, it is clear that New York law does not recognize an assignment in breach of a valid non-assignment clause.105 As Clause 16.1 of the Participation Contract contains a non-assignment clause clearly stating that any unauthorized assignment is null and void, New York law would not recognize any purported assignment where such consent had not been obtained.\n\n*Allhusen v. Caristo Const. Corp.* 303 NY 446, 103 N.E. 2d 891 (N.Y. Ct. App. 1952)\n\n646.\n\nSecondly, where the governing law of the assignment is a foreign law, New York courts (like other Anglo-American jurisdictions) apply the governing law of the contract containing the non-assignment clause when interpreting that clause. As Clause 7.02 of the Farmout Agreement states that mandatory Ecuadorian laws governing the Participation Contract apply, the New York courts would give effect to such laws, including the HCL, when considering the validity of the assignment. The Tribunal does not accept the Respondent's argument that the New York courts are reluctant to invalidate contracts on the basis of illegality under foreign law. The only case cited by the Respondent in support of this argument106 concerned a share transfer (not an assignment of rights) and the Court simply stated that the relevant government entity was entitled to bring a case in the courts of Myanmar or any other court around the world, if it considered that the said share transfer had infringed the Joint Venture Agreement to which it was a party. The New York Court in that case did not consider that any such dispute needed to be decided as part of the case before it. This case provides no support for the sweeping generalization of the Respondent.\n\n*Peregrine Myanmar Ltd. v. Segal* 89 F.3d 41 (2d. Cir. 1996).\n\n647.\n\nNew York courts commonly apply foreign laws where the relevant contractual provision so provides,107 and there is no reason to suggest that they would fail to do so in relation to the assignment sought to be effected by the Farmout Agreement which requires the application of Article 79 of the HCL.\n\nAs noted by the Claimants at footnote 8 of their Reply Brief, 22 November 2011, *Korea Life Ins. Co. v. Morgan Guar. Trust Co. of N.Y.*, 269 F.Supp.2d 424, 441 (S.D. N.Y. 2003) (RLA-338) and *JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. v. Controladora Comercial Mexicana S.A.B. DE C.V.*, 920 N.Y.S.2d 241 (N.Y. Sup. Ct. 2010) (RLA-340) are examples of the New York courts applying foreign law.\n\n648.\n\nThe Tribunal also rejects the Respondent's contention that the New York courts have interpreted the phrase \"null and void\" as meaning \"voidable at the direction of the protected party.\"108 In *Lynbrook v. Cadoo*, cited by the Respondent in support of its contention, the Court held that \"[t]he word \u2018void' is *sometimes* used in statutes in the sense of \u2018voidable'\"109 It by no means held that \"void\" is *always* to be interpreted as \"voidable.\" Moreover, this case concerned the application of \"village law\" in determining the validity of a vote on a town planning matter, and had absolutely nothing to do with an assignment of rights. Similarly, *St. George Seaport Assoc. v. CSX Realty Inc.*110 (also cited by the Respondent) did not establish that void is interpreted by the New York courts to mean voidable with respect to the legality of assignments. The Court's decision in that case concerned the interpretation of a particular statutory provision as it related to a property transaction and must be considered specific to that set of circumstances.\n\nEcuador's Reply to Claimants' Brief in Response to Tribunal's Request of 6 October 2011, 22 November 2011, paragraph 19.\n\n252 NY 308, 312 (NY 1929). (Emphasis added)\n\n1991 US Dist LEXIS 15463.\n\n***(d) Findings***\n------------------\n\n649.\n\nAs the Tribunal found earlier in this Award, the purported assignment on 1 October 2000 by OEPC to AEC by operation of the Farmout Agreement and the Joint Operating Agreement of rights derived under the Participation Contract was never authorized by the Ecuadorian Ministry of Energy and Mines and was thus in breach of Article 74.11 of the HCL.\n\n650.\n\nIt follows that, pursuant to New York and Ecuadorian law, the purported assignment by OEPC to AEC of rights under the Participation Contract pursuant to the Farmout Agreement and the Joint Operating Agreement is null and void and has no validity whatsoever111 and the Tribunal so finds. Under the doctrine of inexistence and under New York law, there is no requirement that the Court must first declare the assignment to be invalid. Indeed, even under the doctrine of absolute nullity, any purported assignment is not considered \"valid\" prior to a declaration of nullity - there is only the \"appearance\" of an act. As such, the purported assignment of rights under the Farmout Agreement and the Joint Operating Agreement was not valid and produced no legal effect. It must therefore be disregarded by the Tribunal for purposes of determining the compensation to which the Claimants are entitled.112 Consequently, the Tribunal finds that OEPC continued to own, as of the date of the *Caducidad* Decree, 100% of the rights under the Participation Contract.\n\nSee Article 79 of the HCL.\n\nThere can be no doubt that the purported assignment of rights by OEPC to AEC is also in breach of Article 74.11 of the HCL.\n\n651.\n\nThe Tribunal accordingly concludes that the Respondent is obliged to compensate the Claimants for 100% of their interest in Block 15 which it acquired upon the issuance of the *Caducidad* Decree.\n\n652.\n\nFor the avoidance of doubt, there is no inconsistency between the Tribunal's earlier conclusion that OEPC acted in breach of the HCL and Clause 16.1 of the Participation Contract in purporting to assign rights in Block 15 without authorization and its conclusion here that the assignment was invalid. Article 79 of the HCL itself makes it clear that the fact that an unauthorized assignment has no validity does not negate the breach caused by a purported assignment: shall have no validity whatsoever... without prejudice to the declaration of *caducidad* as provided for in this Law.\" Moreover, the fact that AEC and OEPC acted as though the assignment had taken place prior to the declaration of *caducidad* does not somehow cause an invalid assignment to become valid.\n\n653.\n\nThe conclusions of the Tribunal in this section are sound under the principles of public international law to be applied when determining damages. Both parties referred, in particular, to unjust enrichment and to those principles contained in the *Chorzow Factory* case.\n\n654.\n\nIn relation to unjust enrichment, there was produced to the Tribunal the letter agreement of February 22, 2006 between OEPC and Andes whereby OEPC is obliged to compensate Andes to the level of 40% of any compensation it receives from action taken against Ecuador regarding the termination of the Participation Contract.113 Even without this letter agreement, the Tribunal notes that the invalidity of the assignment under New York and Ecuadorian law does not mean that AEC (or Andes) may not have recourse against OEPC under the Farmout Agreement. As mentioned earlier, the unauthorised assignment does not invalidate the Farmout Agreement as between the assignor, OEPC and the assignee, AEC nor is the legal position affected by the fact that the assignor and the assignee actually implemented *inter se* parts of the legally invalid and unauthorised assignment. OEPC promised to deliver certain rights to AEC under the Farmout Agreement, but due to its failure to secure authorisation from the Ministry it was in breach of that promise. This breach of contract may form the basis of a claim by AEC (or Andes) against OEPC. These factors weigh heavily against any unjust enrichment arguments raised in respect to OEPC's entitlement to receive compensation for 100% of the interests in the Participation Contract.\n\nC-425. Clause 2(g) of the Agreement states:  \n \"If Occidental receives any monetary award from the Government of Ecuador as a result of the Government's actions to enforce caducity and terminate Occidental's contract with respect to Block 15, Occidental agrees that the Company is entitled to a 40% share in the net amount received, after all costs and expenses of the Caducity Proceedings have been reimbursed or paid (in calculating such amount there shall be no double counting).\"\n\n655.\n\nIn this respect, by far the greater risk of unjust enrichment lies at the door of Ecuador. Ecuador would be unjustly enriched if only obliged to compensate for 60% of a 100% unlawful taking. Ecuador stated in its Additional Submissions that a declaration of nullity could be sought by it if AEC or Andes attempted to bring an action against Ecuador in relation to its purported 40% beneficial interest,114 effectively ensuring that Ecuador would only ever pay a maximum of 60% compensation for a 100% unlawful taking.\n\nRespondent's Brief, 3 November 2011, paragraph 27.\n\n656.\n\nAs a matter of international law, any liability that OEPC might have to AEC or Andes under various other agreements (including the Farmout Agreement) does not affect the Claimants' right to receive compensation from Ecuador. Ecuador cannot discount OEPC's claim by reference to liabilities that may be owed to third parties such as AEC. This principle is clearly recognised in the *Chorzow Factory* dictum at page 26 to which both parties referred and which the Tribunal will quote again:115\n\nThis principle. has the effect, on the one hand, of excluding from the damage to be estimated, injury resulting for third parties from the unlawful act *and, on the other hand, of not excluding from the damage the amount of debts and other obligations for which the injured party is responsible*. The damage suffered by the Oberschlesische in respect of the Chorzow undertaking is therefore equivalent to the total value\u2014but to that total only\u2014of the property, rights and interests of this Company in that undertaking, *without deducting liabilities*.\" (Emphasis added)\n\nThis principle was confirmed in *Enron Corporation and Ponderosa Assets, L.P. v. The Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/01/3), Award of May 22, 2007 (CA-8).\n\n657.\n\nSimilarly, the Tribunal does not accept the Respondent's suggestion that the principle *nemo auditor propriam turpitudinem allegans* (preventing a party from taking advantage of its own wrongdoing) is applicable to this issue.116 The *nemo auditur* principle cannot turn an invalid assignment into a valid one. The question addressed in this section is whether AEC actually acquired ownership of any rights in the Participation Contract as a matter of law (both Ecuadorian and New York) and the *nemo auditor* principle is not relevant to this issue. The separate question of the quantification of damages and, in particular, any consideration of the Claimants' contribution to the damages it suffered as a result of the Respondent's breach are examined elsewhere in this Award.\n\nSee Ecuador's Brief on the effect of Claimants' unauthorized, illegal assignment of rights arising out of the Participation Contract, 3 November 2011, paragraphs 51-55.\n\n658.\n\nBefore closing its conclusions on this issue, the Tribunal notes that the Respondent has objected that the Claimants did not have the standing to claim damages beyond their \"remaining\" 60% interest in Block 15, that the Claimants' interest amounts to 60% of the value of Block 15 and that no willing buyer would pay a price based on 100% of the value for Block 15. In view of the Tribunal's conclusion in relation to the invalidity of the assignment as set out above, this objection of the Respondent has become moot. Also moot is the Respondent's contention that there is a risk of double jeopardy as AEC has no standing to sue Ecuador directly for compensation given that it holds no rights - beneficial or otherwise - in the Participation Contract.\n\n***F. The Fault of the Claimants Prior to the Caducidad Decree***\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n***1. The Respondent's Position***\n----------------------------------\n\n659.\n\nThe Respondent posits that any recovery by the Claimants should be reduced in order to reflect the Claimants' reckless conduct which violated the laws of Ecuador and which, it maintains, provoked the Respondent's decision to declare *caducidad,* thus terminating the Participation Contract and resulting in the Claimants' alleged losses.\n\n660.\n\nThe Respondent submits that any damages awarded to the Claimants should be \"substantially reduced\" on account of the Claimants' contributory fault.\n\n***2. The Claimants' Position***\n--------------------------------\n\n661.\n\nAssuming a finding that they were negligent in failing to obtain prior ministerial authorization, the Claimants argue that the damages they seek should not be reduced because any such negligence did not cause their losses. This, they aver, is an issue of causality. The Claimants reiterate that the Respondent's totally disproportionate action (*i.e. caducidad*) was in breach of the Treaty and international law and must be considered as the sole and exclusive cause of their resulting losses.\n\n***3. The Tribunal's Analysis***\n--------------------------------\n\n662.\n\nAs the Tribunal commences its analysis of this last threshold question, it is important to recall that, earlier in the present Award, the Tribunal has already found the following:\n\n\u2022 by virtue of the Farmout Agreement, executed on 1 October 2000, OEPC purported to transfer rights under the Participation Contract to AEC;\n\n\u2022 this transfer of rights required prior ministerial authorization which was neither requested nor obtained by OEPC;\n\n\u2022 the Claimants failed to give a copy of the Farmout Agreement to the Respondent in the fall of 2000;\n\n\u2022 it was only in the spring of 2004 that the true nature of the Farmout Agreement became known to Ecuador when unsigned but true copies of the Farmout Agreement and of the Joint Operating Agreement, also executed on 1 October 2000, were provided to the audit firm of Moores Rowland who had been retained by the DNH to conduct an audit of OEPC; these two Agreements were provided by Moores Rowland to the Respondent in July 2004;\n\n\u2022 failure by OEPC to disclose the true nature of the Farmout Agreement to Ecuador and to obtain ministerial authorization in 2000 was a \"grave mistake\"; OEPC, while not acting in bad faith, was negligent;\n\n\u2022 OEPC thus breached Clause 16.1 of the Participation Contract and was guilty of an actionable violation of Article 74.11 of the HCL which, as one option, allowed the Minister to declare the *caducidad* of the Participation Contract;\n\n\u2022 the *Caducidad* Decree, issued, according to its terms, because of the breach of Clause 16.1 of the Participation Contract and the violation by OEPC of Article 74 of the HCL, was a disproportionate sanction by the Respondent in the particular circumstances of this case; and\n\n\u2022 the *Caducidad* Decree was issued in breach of Ecuadorian law, and in violation of the Treaty and customary international law.\n\n663.\n\nThe Tribunal now has to determine whether the damages caused to the Claimants by the wrongful act of the Respondent should be reduced because, as the Respondent argues, \"the Claimants' own wrongful conduct directly contributed to *caducidad.* \"\n\n664.\n\nIn support of its submission, the Respondent invokes the legal principle of \"contributory negligence\" on the part of the Claimants.\n\n665.\n\nThe Tribunal's analysis commences with a reference to Article 39 of the International Law Commission's Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts which is invoked by both parties. It provides:\n\n*Article 39. Contribution to the injury*\n\nIn the determination of reparation, account shall be taken of the contribution to the injury by willful or negligent action or omission of the injured State or any person or entity in relation to whom reparation is sought. (Emphasis added)\n\n666.\n\nExtracts in the International Law Commission's Commentary to Article 39 are pertinent, including the following:\n\nArticle 39 deals with the situation where damage has been caused by an internationally wrongful act of a State, which is accordingly responsible for the damage in accordance with Articles 1 and 28, but where the injured State, or the individual victim of the breach, has materially contributed to the damage by some willful or negligent act or omission. (Emphasis added)\n\n667.\n\nThe Tribunal also refers to Article 31 of the International Law Commission's Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts, which states:\n\n*Article 31. Reparation*\n\n1. The responsible State is under an obligation to make full reparation for the injury caused by the internationally wrongful act.\n\n2. Injury includes any damage, whether material or moral, caused by the internationally wrongful act of a State.\n\n668.\n\nThe following extract from the International Law Commission's Commentary to Article 31 is also noted:\n\nIt is true that cases can occur where an identifiable element of injury can properly be allocated to one of several concurrently operating causes alone. But unless some part of the injury can be shown to be severable in causal terms from that attributed to the responsible State, the latter is held responsible for all the consequences, not being too remote, of its wrongful conduct. (Emphasis added)\n\n669.\n\nThe Tribunal must therefore decide, on the basis of the totality of the evidence before it, whether there is a causal link between the negligent failure of OEPC in October 2000 to disclose the true nature of the Farmout Agreement to Ecuador and to request and obtain prior ministerial authorization from the Minister for the transfer of certain rights in the Participation Contract to AEC and the declaration of *caducidad* by the Respondent on 15 May 2006 and, through the latter, with the damages resulting from *caducidad*.\n\n670.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that it is not any contribution by the injured party to the damage which it has suffered which will trigger a finding of contributory negligence. The contribution must be material and significant.117 In this regard, the Tribunal has a wide margin of discretion in apportioning fault.118\n\n*MTD Equity Sdn. Bhd. and MTD Chile S.A. v. Republic of Chile* (ICSID Case No. ARB/01/7), Decision on Annulment of 21 March 2007 at paragraph 101.\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n671.\n\nThe Tribunal recalls the terms of Clauses 21.1.1 and 21.1.2 of the Participation Contract, which state that \"this Participation Contract shall terminate\", *inter alia* :\n\n***21.1.1*** By a declaration of forfeiture [ *caducidad* ] issued by the Corresponding Ministry for the causes and following the procedure established in Articles seventy four (74), seventy five (75) and seventy six (76) of the Hydrocarbons Law, insofar as applicable.\n\n[\u2026]\n\n***21.1.2*** Due to a transfer of rights and obligations of the Participation Contract without prior authorization from the Corresponding Ministry.\n\n672.\n\nOEPC thus agreed to a contractual framework with Ecuador that explicitly authorized *caducidad* upon a violation of Article 74.11 of the HCL. By agreeing to Clauses 21.1.1 and 21.1.2 in the Participation Contract and then failing imprudently and negligently to obtain ministerial authorization as required, OEPC exposed itself to a serious risk that *caducidad* could be declared.\n\n673.\n\nParaphrasing the words of Article 39 of the International Law Commission's Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts and its commentary, the Tribunal must determine whether this unlawful act of OEPC contributed to its injury in a material and significant way, or was it a minor contributory factor which, based on subsequent events such as the VAT Award, cannot be considered, legally, as a link in the causative chain.\n\n674.\n\nBoth parties, in support of their respective positions, have quoted extensively to extracts of the 1974 seminal thesis of Professor Brigitte Stern, a member of this Tribunal, entitled \" *Le pr\u00e9judice dans la th\u00e9orie de la responsabilit\u00e9 internationale.* \" The Tribunal agrees that Professor Stern's thesis, particularly Chapter II entitled \" *Application nuanc\u00e9e des r\u00e8gles normales de la causalit\u00e9,* \" is very instructive to and informs its decision on this issue.\n\n675.\n\nIn a section of this chapter of her thesis entitled \" *Acte de la victime justifiant partiellement l'acte de l'\u00c9tat,* \" Professor Stern refers to the cases of *Delagoa Bay Railway*119 and *Lillie Kling v. Mexico*120 as authorities for the following proposition:\n\nIl y a enfin un certain nombre de circonstances dans lesquelles l'acte de la victime ne justifie que partiellement l'acte de l'\u00c9tat et o\u00f9 il faut donc consid\u00e9rer qu'aussi bien l'un que l'autre sont intervenus de fa\u00e7on compl\u00e9mentaire dans la production du dommage.\n\n[Translation: Finally, there are a certain number of circumstances in which the act of the victim only partially justifies the State action, and in which as a result it must be concluded that both the former and the latter operated in a complementary fashion to produce the damage.]\n\n*Delagoa Bay Railway Arbitration* (Award of 29 March 1900), reprinted in H. Lafontaine, *Pasicrisie Internationale* (1902) 397.\n\n*Lillie S. Kling (U.S.A.) v. The United Mexican States* (Award of 8 October 1930), reprinted in Reports on International Arbitral Awards (2006), Volume IV, 575.\n\n676.\n\nThe words of the Tribunal in *Delagoa Bay Railway* are particularly pertinent to the present case:\n\nToutes ces circonstances qui peuvent \u00eatre all\u00e9gu\u00e9es \u00e0 la charge de la compagnie concessionnaire et \u00e0 la d\u00e9charge du gouvernement portugais att\u00e9nuent la responsabilit\u00e9 de ce dernier et justifient [...l une r\u00e9duction de la r\u00e9paration \u00e0 allouer.121\n\n[Translation: All these circumstances that can be put forward against the concessionaire and to the credit of the Portuguese government lessen the responsibility of the latter and justify [...] a reduction in the damages to be granted.l (Emphasis added)\n\n*Delagoa Bay Railway Arbitration* (Award of 29 March 1900), H. Lafontaine, *Pasicrisie Internationale* (1902) at page 402.\n\n677.\n\nIn *Lillie Kling*, the presiding commissioner opined that \" *it is impossible not to consider that the action of the [Mexican] soldiers [the shooting and killing of an* *American] was caused by the shots fired in the air [...] in a very imprudent manner\"* by some of the victim's companions.122 This \"imprudence\" was thus taken into consideration by the Commission to reduce the amount of the indemnity.\n\n*Lillie S. Kling (U.S.A.) v. The United Mexican States* (Award of 8 October 1930), reprinted in Reports on International Arbitral Awards (2006), Volume IV, at page 575.\n\n678.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees that an award of damages may be reduced if the claiming party also committed a fault which contributed to the prejudice it suffered and for which the trier of facts, in the exercise of its discretion, considers the claiming party should bear some responsibility.123\n\nThis is also the basis of the tribunal's ruling in *MTD Equity Sdn Bhd*. *v. The Republic of Chile*, Award of 25 May 2004 at paragraphs 242 and 243 that \"the Claimants should bear part of the damages suffered.\" In that case, that \"part\" was quantified as 50% of the damages.\n\n679.\n\nIn the present case, as noted earlier, OEPC had agreed in the Participation Contract that, if it failed to obtain prior ministerial authorization to transfer rights under the Participation Contract to AEC, it ran the risk that the Respondent would declare the caducity of the Participation Contract. Since it did not seek nor obtain the required authorization, the Tribunal has found that it acted negligently and committed an unlawful act. The Claimants' fault prevented the Respondent from exercising, in a formal way, its sovereign right to vet and approve AEC as the transferee of those rights and, even more importantly on the facts of the present case, to vet any other unknown investor to which AEC could eventually transfer its rights.\n\n680.\n\nIn the view of the Tribunal, the Claimants should pay a price for having committed an unlawful act which contributed in a material way to the prejudice which they subsequently suffered when the *Caducidad* Decree was issued.\n\n681.\n\nIn considering the extent of the contribution of the Claimants' negligence to their injury, the Tribunal notes that the issuance of the *Caducidad* Decree which ensued, as the Tribunal has found, was a disproportionate sanction and a measure tantamount to expropriation of the Claimants' substantial investment in Ecuador. The totality of the Claimants' damages were caused by *Caducidad*. The Tribunal must now determine to what extent and in what proportion the Claimants' unlawful act in 2000 contributed to lessen the responsibility of the Respondent.\n\n682.\n\nThe Tribunal recalls that, in the fall of 2000, AEC was an entity already present and active in Ecuador and thus well known to the Respondent and, in particular, to PetroEcuador.\n\n683.\n\nIf OEPC had sought the Minister's consent in October 2000, in all likelihood it would have obtained it and it is probable that the Respondent would not have declared \"Caducidad\" in 2006. In other words, without the violation of the law by OEPC, C *aducidad* may not have happened. In this connection, the Tribunal recalls that the violation of the law by OEPC was invoked by Ecuador as the principal legal basis for the Decree.\n\n684.\n\nOn the other hand, as noted earlier in the present Award, the publication of the VAT Award in favour of the Claimants and the social unrest directed against OEPC which ensued were also causes which, in the view of the Tribunal, contributed in a material and significant way to the declaration of *Caducidad*.\n\n685.\n\nIn other words, it is a conjunction of different factors which, taken together, in a complementary manner, were the causes of the decision of the Respondent to declare *Caducidad*. The difficult task of the Tribunal in this case is to weight the relative causal link of this series of causes on the *Caducidad Decree* and, as a consequence, on the damages caused to the Claimants.\n\n***4. The Tribunal's Conclusion***\n----------------------------------\n\n686.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees with the ICSID Annulment Committee in the *MTD Equity* case that \"the role of the two parties contributing to the loss [is] [...] only with difficulty commensurable and the Tribunal [has] a corresponding margin of estimation.\"124 However, the Tribunal must reach a decision and it has.\n\n*MTD Equity Sdn Bhd. v. The Republic of Chile*, Decision on Annulment of 21 March 2007 (ICSID) at paragraph 101.\n\n687.\n\nHaving considered and weighed all the arguments which the parties have presented to the Tribunal in respect of this issue, in particular the evidence and the authorities traversed in the present chapter, the Tribunal, in the exercise of its wide discretion, finds that, as a result of their material and significant wrongful act, the Claimants have contributed to the extent of 25% to the prejudice which they suffered when the Respondent issued the *Caducidad* Decree. The resulting apportionment of responsibility as between the Claimants and the Respondent, to wit 25% and 75%, is fair and reasonable in the circumstances of the present case.\n\n***G. Remaining Quantum Issues***\n---------------------------------\n\n***1. Introduction***\n---------------------\n\n688.\n\nNow informed by its conclusions in respect of the four threshold issues which it has analyzed in the previous Sections of this Award, the Tribunal will determine the quantum of the damages which the Respondent owes to the Claimants.\n\n689.\n\nThere are several remaining fundamental issues associated with the determination of quantum in the present case. As will be seen, these issues include, first and foremost, both the appropriate standard of reparation as well as the appropriate method of valuation.\n\n690.\n\nBoth parties agree that one method of valuation is the discounted cash flow (\"DCF\") method125 which involves the application of a number of variables including (i) the exact production profile, (ii) reserve adjustment factors, (iii) oil price projections, (iv) the appropriate discount rate, and (v) capital expenditures and operating expenses. The Claimants also present a claim for consequential damages which they allegedly suffered following the *Caducidad* Decree on account of their \"ship or pay\" contract with OCP, a claim for employee termination costs and a claim for a stranded cargo.\n\nThe Claimants assert that, in this particular case, the DCF method is the only method that should be used, whereas, as noted later in this chapter of the Award, the Respondent submits that the Tribunal should also examine comparable sales.\n\n691.\n\nAt the outset of its analysis, the Tribunal wishes to acknowledge the assistance which has been provided to it in the determination of the quantum of the Claimants' damages by counsel for both parties as well as the reports and testimony of the parties' quantum experts, Professor Joseph P. Kalt on behalf of the Claimants, and Mr. Daniel Johnston on behalf of the Respondent.\n\n692.\n\nMore particularly, the Tribunal recalls that, during its deliberations, it sought the assistance of the parties' experts. In this connection, as mentioned earlier, on 11 March 2011, it issued Procedural Order No. 9 which reads, in relevant parts, as follows:\n\n***2 EXPERT ASSISTANCE***\n\n2.1 The Tribunal invites the experts, Professor Kalt and Mr. Johnston, to confer and produce jointly a report estimating the fair market value of Block 15 as of 16 May 2006, using the discounted cash flow method.\n\n2.2 In estimating this value, the experts shall make the following assumptions:\n\n(a) That the risked reserves of Block 15 as of 15 May 2006 consisted of approximately 240 million barrels of oil (the \"production profile\").\n\n(b) That approximately 33.4 million barrels of oil should be deducted from this production profile, representing reserves in the Ed\u00e9n-Yuturi, Paka Sur and Paka North fields, classified as \"probable\" rather than \"proved\".\n\n(c) That a further [to be determined by the experts] million barrels of oil should be deducted from this production profile, representing the value of the proved reserves that a willing buyer could not have developed due to the absence of the two rigs withdrawn by OEPC prior to 15 May 2006.\n\n(d) With respect to items (b) and (c) above, the experts will determine the impact of these deductions on the operating expenditures (see item (h) below).\n\n(e) That the following reserve adjustment factors should be used:\n\no 100% for proved reserves\n\no 50% for probable reserves o 25% for possible reserves\n\n(f) That the future NYMEX based-WTI prices should be used as the basis for the forecast of crude oil prices from May 2006.\n\n(g) That a discount rate of 12% should be used.\n\n(h) That the twelve months of operating costs incurred directly prior to 15 May 2006 (*i.e.* May 2005 to May 2006) should be used to forecast operating expenditures.\n\n(i) That an amount of $243 million should be used as capital expenditures.\n\n(j) That no examination of comparable sales should be undertaken.\n\n693.\n\nThe President of the Tribunal, on 21 March 2011, clarified assumption 2.2(a) in an email to the parties which reads, in relevant parts, as follows:\n\nWith respect to the specific issue raised by the parties in connection with paragraph 2.2(a) of the Procedural Order, the Tribunal is of the view that a clarification is required. The Tribunal confirms that the experts shall assume that the risked reserves of Block 15 as of 15 May 2006 consisted of approximately 240mmbo before deducting from that figure the actual production between 1 January and 15 May 2006 as well as any adjustment already acknowledged by the Claimants.\n\n694.\n\nThe experts, on 11 April 2011, submitted a joint report to the Tribunal in which, in accordance with the instructions of the Tribunal set forth in Procedural Order No. 9, they opined and agreed as to the fair market value of Block 15 as of 16 May 2006 (the \"Joint Expert Report\"). The Tribunal will refer later in this chapter, as necessary, to the Joint Expert Report.\n\n695.\n\nAs provided for in Procedural Order No. 9, the parties, on 18 April 2011, submitted comments to the Tribunal on the Joint Expert Report.\n\n696.\n\nThe President of the Tribunal, on 29 April 2011, informed the parties that the Tribunal had decided that a one-day hearing was necessary in order \"to examine the experts on their Joint Report and hear the parties' representations\".\n\n697.\n\nOn 13 May 2011, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 10 which provided, in relevant parts, as follows:\n\n7. The purpose of the present Order is to provide the parties with the Tribunal's instructions with respect to the organization of the hearing to be held in Washington, D.C. on 30 June 2011 (the \"Hearing\").\n\n8. The Hearing is a continuation of the Tribunal's consultation with the parties' quantum Experts, whose assistance, as noted earlier, has been required.\n\n9. The Tribunal recalls the following passages from the Experts' Joint Report :\n\n6. [\u2026] [W]e agreed, based on our joint review of each other's damage models, that it was possible to identify and harmonize otherwise minor methodological and modeling differences. As a result, we are here able to employ a common model and present its results to the Tribunal.\n\n7. [\u2026] [W]e also reached agreement on the most reasonable approaches and methodology for calculating fair market value consistent with the Tribunal's instructions. [\u2026]\n\n[\u2026]\n\n26. [\u2026] We are certainly willing to make our model available and/or to perform any additional calculations with that model that the Tribunal may request.\n\n10. Against this background, the Tribunal requests that the Experts confer again and produce jointly to the Tribunal, by 10 June 2011, a supplemental report addressing (i) the Respondent's comments of 18 April 2011 and its letter of 27 April 2011, and (ii) the Claimants' comments of 18 April 2011 and their letters of 25 and 28 April 2011.\n\n11. The parties may submit comments to the Tribunal on the Experts' supplemental joint report by no later than 17 June 2011.\n\n12. The Tribunal requests that Professor Kalt and Mr. Johnston be present at the Hearing in order to assist the Tribunal and answer questions which may be put to them by members of the Tribunal.\n\n698.\n\nThe experts, on 10 June 2011, submitted a supplemental joint report to the Tribunal in accordance with the instructions of the Tribunal set forth in Procedural Order No. 10 (the \"Supplemental Joint Expert Report\"). Again, the Tribunal will refer later in this chapter, as necessary, to the Supplemental Joint Expert Report.\n\n699.\n\nOn 17 June 2011, the parties submitted their comments regarding the Supplemental Joint Expert Report.\n\n700.\n\nOn 20 June 2011, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 11 which provided, in relevant part, as follows:\n\nThe experts, Prof. Kalt and Mr. Johnson, to the extent that they consider that either party, in its last comments, has raised issues which were not addressed earlier, are required to confer again and produce jointly to the Tribunal, by 24 June 2011, another report addressing such new issues.\n\nIn addition, in order to further assist the Tribunal in its continuing deliberations, recalling again the following passage from the Experts' Joint Report of 11 April 2011:\n\n26. [...] We are certainly willing to make our model available and/or to perform any additional calculations with that model that the Tribunal may request. (Emphasis added)\n\nreiterated in para 7 of the Experts' Joint Report of 10 June 2011, the Tribunal requests the experts to present to the Tribunal and to the parties alternative calculations of the fair market value of Block 15 as of 16 May 2006 (see Table 3, at para 30 of the Experts' Joint report of 10 June 2011) reflecting, in turn, all of the following, separately and cumulatively:\n\ni. the full effect of the rig delay case based on the NSA Delay Case (See Respondent's Comments of 17 June 2011 at pp 6-12);\n\nii. the addition of $20 million to the twelve months of OEPC's operating costs prior to 15 May 2006 in order to forecast operating expenditure (See Respondent's Comments of 17 June 2011 at pp 12-15); and\n\niii. the deduction of an additional.38 million barrels of oil from the OEPC production profile representing reserves in the Limoncocha well LC-103 which should have been classified as \"probable\" rather than proved.\"\n\nThese alternative calculations are required by the Tribunal as its members continue their preparation for the hearing of 30 June.\n\n701.\n\nThe experts, on 24 June 2011, submitted a second supplemental joint report to the Tribunal in accordance with the instructions of the Tribunal set forth in Procedural Order No. 11 (the \"Second Supplemental Joint Expert Report\"). The Tribunal will refer later in this chapter, as necessary, to the Second Supplemental Joint Expert Report.\n\n702.\n\nFinally, as contemplated by Procedural Order No. 10, the Tribunal held a one-day hearing in Washington, D.C. on 30 June 2011. The experts were then examined by the Tribunal which also heard the parties' representations.\n\n703.\n\nAfter this hearing, the Tribunal continued its deliberations both as to the liability and quantum issues.\n\n***2. Fair Market Value (\"FMV\")***\n----------------------------------\n\n***(a) The Claimants' Position***\n---------------------------------\n\n704.\n\nThe Claimants submit that international law governs the proper remedy for the Respondent's Treaty breaches, and that the appropriate standard of reparation under international law is compensation for the losses suffered by the victim. Under international law, the Claimants add, FMV is the appropriate measure of damages.\n\n705.\n\nRegarding FMV *per se*, the Claimants contend that the standard for valuing the net present worth of Block 15 as of the date of expropriation is \"the price that a willing buyer would pay to a willing seller in circumstances in which each had good information, each desired to maximize his financial gain, and neither was under duress or threat.\"\n\n***(b) The Respondent's Position***\n-----------------------------------\n\n706.\n\nThe Respondent does not disagree with the Claimants that, in the event of a finding by the Tribunal that there has been an expropriation of the Claimants' investment (which the Tribunal has found), Article III of the Treaty is controlling, *i.e.* \"[c]ompensation shall be equivalent to the fair market value of the expropriated investment immediately before the expropriatory action was taken or became known, whichever is earlier\".\n\n***(c) The Tribunal's Conclusion***\n-----------------------------------\n\n707.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees with the parties. Having found earlier in this Award that the Claimants' investment in Ecuador has not been accorded fair and equitable treatment by the Respondent and has been expropriated by the issuance of the *Caducidad* Decree, the Tribunal will now determine, as mandated by Article III of the Treaty, the fair market value of this investment. The Tribunal agrees with and adopts the definition of FMV which Professor Kalt has explained as follows:\n\nMeasurement of fair market value in a context such as at hand here properly entails consideration of *market* outcomes. Specifically, the fair market value today of a stream of net revenues (i.e., gross revenues minus attendant costs) that can be earned from operation of a multi-year project such as OEPC's development of Block 15 entails assessment of the amount that a willing buyer would reasonably be expected to have to pay a willing seller to induce the seller to give up its rights to those net revenues. Here, Occidental is in the position of a seller in the sense that we seek measurement of the amount Occidental would reasonably have been willing to accept to be voluntarily bought out of the instant contract and associated income-generating opportunities, as opposed to having had that contract and those opportunities involuntarily terminated by Ecuador.126 (Emphasis in original)\n\nExpert Report of Joseph P. Kalt dated 17 September 2007 at paragraph 14. See also the Tribunal's Comments *supra* at paragraphs 540, 541and 563.\n\n***3. The Discounted Cash Flow (\"DCF\") Method***\n------------------------------------------------\n\n708.\n\nThe Tribunal is of the view that, in this case, the standard economic approach to measuring the fair market value today of a stream of net revenues (*i.e*., gross revenues minus attendant costs) that can be earned from the operation of a multi-year project such as OEPC's development of Block 15 is the calculation of the present value, as of 16 May 2006, of the net benefits, or \"discounted cash flows\". These net cash flows are appropriately determined by calculating the flow of benefits (\"cash flows\") that the Claimants would have reasonably been expected to earn in the \"but for\" state of the world in which the termination of the Participation Contract hypothetically did not occur relative to the actual cash flow that the Claimants will derive subsequent to the termination. The difference between these two cash flow streams (the \"but for\" state of the world with no termination less the actual state of the world with contract termination), discounted to the date of the actual contract termination, is the economically appropriate and reliable measure of the cumulative economic harm suffered by the Claimants as a consequence of the contract termination.\n\n709.\n\nUsing a DCF model as the starting point for measuring FMV, the Tribunal further observes that the analytical framework for determining FMV in the present circumstances requires several steps. These steps are clearly summarized by the Respondent. The Claimants agree. They are:\n\n(a) Determination of the size of the reservoir (project the number of barrels that are in the field);\n\n(b) Creation of a production profile (establish the number of barrels that can be produced each year economically);\n\n(c) Assignment of risk adjustment factors (\"RAFs\") to the reserves (to reflect the risk that certain reserves categories will not produce the amount of oil projected);\n\n(d) Application of a price forecast (multiplication the number of barrels in the production profile by a projected price of oil, subtraction of the costs to produce those barrels); and\n\n(e) Application of a discount rate (to reflect, among other things, the time-value of money and business and country risks).\n\n***4. Volume and Production Profile of Block 15***\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n710.\n\nThe most important component of the DCF model in the present case is the determination of the volume and production profile of Block 15. The evidence proffered by the parties on this item is voluminous. The Tribunal will endeavour to summarize and analyze this evidence.\n\n***(a) The Parties' Expert Reports***\n-------------------------------------\n\n***(i) NSAI Expert Report dated 17 September 2007***\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n711.\n\nFor the Claimants, Netherland, Sewell & Associates Inc. (\"NSAI\") provided its first expert report by way of a full independent estimate of all the gross Block 15 reserves as of 30 April 2006. The Tribunal notes that this study was carried out using the 1997 definitions for oil and gas reserves adopted by the Society of Petroleum Engineers and the World Petroleum Council, which represent the industry accepted standards for reserves classification.\n\n712.\n\nIn this report, NSAI estimated the gross Block 15 reserves as of 30 April 2006 at 320 million barrels.127 The Claimants then subjected this estimate of reserves to standard OEPC risk analysis and their expert, Professor Kalt, determined that NSAI's reserve estimate equalled approximately 240 million barrels of oil as of 1 January 2006.128\n\nSee NSAI Expert Report dated 17 September 2007 at paragraph 183.\n\nExpert Report of Joseph P. Kalt dated 17 September 2007, Exhibit 1 at page 14.\n\n***(ii) RPS Scotia's Expert Report dated March 2009***\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n713.\n\nIn this report submitted on behalf of the Respondent, RPS Scotia averred that NSAI's non-producing and undeveloped reserves utilised in Professor Kalt's economic model were overstated. It concluded that the Block 15 gross risked reserves were, as of 30 April 2006, 132.8 million barrels for the RPS Scotia Base Case129 and 134.0 million barrels for the RPS Scotia Acceleration Case130. Unrisked reserves were 199.2 million barrels for the Base Case and 202.2 for the Acceleration Case. This compared with the NSAI/OEPC gross risked and unrisked reserves of 228.6 million barrels and 320.7 million barrels, respectively, for Block 15 as of 30 April 2006.\n\nDefined by RPS Scotia as a \"forecast which follows as closely as possible the capital schedule used in the Kalt model. [\u2026] RPS eliminated certain cases in the NSA project set which it believes a prudent operator would not execute. In order to match the Kalt capital schedule, eight additional projects were eliminated.\" See RPS Scotia's Expert Report dated March 2009 at page 27.\n\nDefined by RPS Scotia as a forecast which \"used all of the projects that \u2018made the cut' in RPS Scotia's opinion, including the eight projects discussed above\": see RPS Scotia's Expert Report dated March 2009 at page 27.\n\n***(iii) RPS Scotia June 2009 Report Entitled \"Ecuador Block 15 Reserves Certification and Plan of Development Study as of January 1, 2009\"***\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n714.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that this report (the \"RPS Scotia June 2009 Reserves Certification\") was obtained by the Claimants on discovery. It was made for Petroamazonas' business and reporting purposes and not for this arbitration. Petroamazonas, an Ecuadorian entity, is required under Ecuadorian law to report to the DNH annually on reserves and other matters, and to certify that its estimates are correct. The Claimants maintain, that this report confirms NSAI's reserve estimates. According to the Claimants, if adjusted to 1 May 2006, the RPS Scotia June 2009 Reserves Certification yields an estimate of 227.1 million barrels using the Claimants' reserve adjustment factors, which the Claimants maintain, is \"remarkably similar\" to NSAI's risked estimate of 228.6 million barrels as of 30 April 2006.\n\n***(iv) RPS Scotia's Rebuttal Expert Report dated September 2009***\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n715.\n\nIn this report, submitted on behalf of the Respondent, RPS Scotia opined that a substantial number of wells had to be eliminated from its June 2009 Reserves Certification and from NSAI's estimate. The reserves from these wells, argued RPS Scotia, is greater than would have been actually recoverable in Block 15 because, for example, the Claimants double-counted barrels and included projects that did not meet the minimum economic threshold. In addition, RPS Scotia maintained that the Claimants' damages model rests on production plans that were not approved by Ecuadorian authorities as well as a drilling schedule that no reasonable buyer would have considered since the drilling rigs required to accomplish that schedule simply did not exist.\n\n***(v) NSAI Supplemental Expert Report dated 12 June 2009***\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n716.\n\nThis supplemental report by NSAI on behalf of the Claimants was carried out for the purpose of:\n\n\u2022 evaluating the sufficiency and reliability of the RPS Scotia Report of March 2009 which estimated significantly lower reserves for Block 15 than did the initial NSAI Report;\n\n\u2022 assessing the merits of RPS Scotia's numerous criticisms of NSAI's methodology and reserves estimates; and\n\n\u2022 confirming the accuracy of NSAI Report's gross (100 percent) reserves estimates based on production and operational data provided by Ecuador for Block 15 for the time period May 2006 through March 2009.\n\n717.\n\nIn this supplemental report, NSAI affirmed that RPS Scotia did not estimate Block 15 reserves using commonly accepted oil industry practices. In particular, RPS Scotia did not conduct its own independent analysis of Block 15 data but rather relied upon the work of NSAI, Petroamazonas and Occidental. Thus, this represented an audit, not a separate free-standing analysis. NSAI also considered that RPS Scotia's well-bywell reductions to NSAI's reserves estimates were not technically justified. It opined that production data since May 2006 confirmed the accuracy of NSAI's initial production forecast of 17 September 2007, to wit risked reserves of 240 million barrels of oil as of 1 January 2006.\n\n***(b) The Tribunal's Conclusion***\n-----------------------------------\n\n718.\n\nThe Tribunal has considered carefully the written reports of the parties' experts as well as their oral evidence. The Tribunal has also considered the parties' submissions regarding the risked reserves of Block 15. As noted earlier, this is the most significant component in the application of the DCF model in the present case. In reaching its conclusion on the volume and production profile of Block 15, the Tribunal has made the following findings.\n\n719.\n\nFrom the outset, the Tribunal observes that NSAI's estimate of reserves in its 17 September 2007 Report in the form of a production forecast is standard in the industry. The Claimants, in order to create a risked production profile, applied the standard risking percentages used by the company and its affiliates in their ordinary course of business around the world.\n\n720.\n\nThe Tribunal is well aware that the Respondent, relying on the two reports of its expert, RPS Scotia, has represented that there were \"numerous deficiencies in the production profile advanced by Claimants\"131 and that their production profile was \"simply not achievable.\"132\n\nSee footnote 1, item (1), in the Respondent's Annotated Damages Tables of 20 February 2010.\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n721.\n\nHowever, the Tribunal recalls that RPS Scotia's Rebuttal Expert Report of September 2009 was seriously challenged by the Claimants. In the view of the Tribunal, the strongest point made by the Claimants' expert, NSAI, in its Supplemental Report is that the Petroamazonas' reserve estimates of June 2009 carried out by RPS Scotia very much confirm the NSAI estimates initially put forward by the Claimants.\n\n722.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees with the Claimants. However, as will be seen later, these reserve estimates, in the opinion of the Tribunal, must be adjusted because the Claimants' damages model rests on some production plans which were not approved and assumptions which were not realistic.\n\n723.\n\nIn criticising Mr. Johnston's use of the RPS Scotia production profile, Professor Kalt stated:\n\n**Johnston Approach** : As shown in Table 2, Mr. Johnston's use of the RPS Scotia production profile is the largest source of difference between his and my NPV determinations. This highlights the importance of assuring that the underlying reserve estimates used for the purposes of a DCF analysis are reasonable and supported by available data.\n\nThe RPS Scotia estimate of gross risked reserves, relied upon by Mr. Johnston, however, is only 131 mmbbl. This 131 mmbbl figure is dwarfed by the aforementioned risked reserves figure of 294.3 mmbbl (as of December 31, 2006) which Ecuador reported itself as operator of Block 15 in PetroEcuador's 2007-2011 Five Year Plan. Thus, Ecuador's own reserves estimates are approximately two and a quarter times the level proffered by RPS Scotia and used by Mr. Johnston in his testimony here on behalf of Ecuador. This disconnect in the estimates of underlying reserves undermines the reliability of the RPS Scotia/Johnston results.\n\nThe low risked-reserve estimates used by Mr. Johnston are the product of RPS Scotia's reserves estimation methodology and its application to those reserves of reserve adjustment factors (\"RAFs\") taken directly from the aforementioned SPEE survey. These survey results represent, at best, general rules of thumb. They differ substantially from the risk factors actually used by Block 15 operators.133 (Emphasis added; footnotes omitted)\n\nRebuttal Expert Report of Joseph P. Kalt dated 12 June 2009 at paragraphs 62-64. The Tribunal finds Professor Kalt's criticism very sound.\n\n724.\n\nThe RPS Scotia June 2009 Reserves Certification obtained by the Claimants during the discovery phase of the arbitration obviously presented the Respondent with a dilemma. The Respondent chose not to challenge the accuracy of these estimates. Rather, it took the legal position that it is impermissible for a party to refer to postvaluation evidence.\n\n725.\n\nIn this connection, the Tribunal notes that RPS Scotia, in its September 2009 Rebuttal Expert Report submitted on behalf of the Respondent, referred to and relied upon its June 2009 Reserves Certification Report to Petroamazonas. It said:\n\nFinally, as developed in Section 5 of this report, RPS Scotia was retained by Petroamazonas in December 2008 to conduct a six-month detailed reserves certification study of Block 15, separate and apart from RPS Scotia's involvement in this arbitration proceeding. The cost of the study was $1.3 million and a final report was provided to Petroamazonas in July 2009. The results of that study have been incorporated into this report and are presented in Section 5.0 of this report.[...]134\n\nRebuttal Expert Report of RPS Scotia dated September 2009 at paragraph 50.\n\n726.\n\nThe Claimants submit that it is permissible, as the Respondent's expert has done, to utilize post-valuation date data to verify or otherwise check assumptions made in the DCF model. The Tribunal agrees. The tribunal in the *Starrett Housing* award opined that the tribunal appointed-expert could rely on events subsequent to the date of expropriation to test his assumptions as long as those assumptions were reasonably foreseeable on the date of valuation.135 This is precisely what the Claimants' expert did in the present case.\n\n*Starrett Housing Corporation* et al *. v. The Islamic Republic of Iran*, Award of 14 August 1987, reprinted in 4 Iran-US C.T.R. 112 at pages 123-124.\n\n727.\n\nIn the circumstances, the Tribunal accepts, subject to the two adjustments hereinafter explained, that the risked reserve estimates of the Claimants, as of 1 January 2006, were approximately 240 million barrels of oil. The risked reserve estimates of the Claimants, when adjusted for production that occurred from 1 January to 15 May 2006, yield total risked reserves of 227 million barrels of oil as of 16 May 2006.136\n\nSee, in this regard, the Joint Expert Report at paragraphs 9-10. See also the Supplemental Joint Expert Report at paragraph 12.\n\n728.\n\nAs foreshadowed earlier, there remain two important areas of dispute between the parties which, in the opinion of the Tribunal, are pertinent to its determination of the Claimants' reserve estimates as of the date of the *Caducidad* Decree.\n\n729.\n\nFirstly, the Respondent contends that some reserves in the fields of Ed\u00e9n-Yuturi, Paka Sur, Paka Norte and Limoncocha should be eliminated because, although they were submitted by OEPC to the DNH for approval on 1 December 2005 in its Second Amended Development Plan, approval had not yet been granted on the date of the *Caducidad* Decree. These reserves, says the Respondent, total 33.7 million barrels that should have been classified as \"probable,\" and not as \"proved.\"\n\n730.\n\nThe Claimants acknowledge that the development of these fields had not been approved by the DNH as of the date of the *Caducidad* Decree,137 but they maintain that this was due to the fact that in the months prior to *caducidad*, the DNH approval process slowed down considerably. They also submit that the Ed\u00e9n-Yuturi Development Plan was actually approved by the DNH in March 2007 when it was presented by Petroamazonas on the basis of OEPC's own operator studies.\n\nSee NSAI Expert Report dated 17 September 2007 at page 3, note (1).\n\n731.\n\nIn order to decide this issue, the Tribunal recalls that \"proved\" reserves are those which, by analysis of geologic and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be commercially recoverable from known reserves. The development of the wells at issue in Ecuador was undisputedly subject to approval by the DNH. The fact is that this plan was not approved by the time the *Caducidad* Decree was issued. Thus, a willing buyer could not have started drilling these wells the day after the *Caducidad* Decree.\n\n732.\n\nThe Tribunal is not satisfied, on the basis of the record, that the failure of the DNH to approve the work programmes and budgets related to the plan at issue was influenced by the strained relationship between OEPC and Ecuador at that time.\n\n733.\n\nIn the circumstances, the Claimants' production profile will accordingly be reduced to account for the barrels of the oil reserves in the Ed\u00e9n-Yuturi, Paka Sur, Paka Norte and Limoncocha fields which should have been classified as \"probable\" rather than \"proved.\"138 As a corollary of this adjustment, the Tribunal will be required to consider the impact of this reduction in connection with the Claimants' forecast of operating expenses.139\n\nSee, in this regard, the Joint Expert Report at paragraphs 11-12. See also the Supplemental Joint Expert Report at paragraphs 8-10 and the Second Supplemental Joint Expert Report at paragraphs 11-13.\n\nSee, in this regard, the Joint Expert Report at paragraphs 17 and following.\n\n734.\n\nLastly, the Respondent contends that the Claimants' production profile should also be adjusted to reflect the release by OEPC of two rigs prior to the *Caducidad* Decree.140\n\nThe Tribunal notes that NSAI's estimate of the number of wells for drilling from May to December 2006 was based on OEPC's drilling schedule during the previous two years.\n\n735.\n\nThe Claimants reply that \"[they] are entitled to assume that Block 15 drilling would have taken place as if there had been two rigs on the block on May 16, 2006.\" (Emphasis added)\n\n736.\n\nThe decision by the Claimants to release two drilling rigs and withdraw their Development Plan in April 2006 because of the enactment of Law 42 may have been driven by valid economic considerations, but a reliable DCF calculation cannot rest on \"as if\" assumptions. In the words of the Claimants' expert himself, Professor Kalt, the inputs used as the basis for a DCF analysis cannot be based on speculation or wishful thinking.141\n\nRebuttal Expert Report of Joseph P. Kalt dated 12 June 2009 at paragraph 53.\n\n737.\n\nIn the circumstances, the Claimants' production profile will be further reduced to account for the \"impact of delaying\" caused by the lack of drill rig availability that a willing buyer would have encountered the day after the *Caducidad* Decree due to the absence of two drilling rigs.142 Again, the Tribunal will also be required to consider the impact of this reduction in connection with the Claimants' forecast of operating expenses.143\n\nSee, in this regard, the Joint Expert Report at paragraphs 13-15, in particular footnote 2. See also the Supplemental Joint Expert Report at paragraphs 22-29 and the Second Supplemental Joint Expert Report at paragraphs 5-6.\n\nSee, in this regard, the Joint Expert Report at paragraphs 17 and following.\n\n738.\n\nIn summary, and after factoring into the DCF model the two adjustments set out above, the Tribunal concludes that the Claimants have otherwise met their burden of proof with respect to their production profile as of the date of the *Caducidad* Decree. The Block 15 risked reserves on 16 May 2006 total 208.9 million barrels of oil as calculated by the parties' experts, Professor Kalt and Mr. Johnston, following instructions from the Tribunal.144\n\nSee, in this regard, the Joint Expert Report at paragraphs 9 and 16 and the Supplemental Joint Expert Report at paragraph 12.\n\n***5. Reserve Adjustment Factors (\"RAFs\")***\n--------------------------------------------\n\n739.\n\nWhen reserves are estimated, it is standard practice in the oil industry business to adjust them according to their category in order to estimate future productions. Such estimates are used in the actual planning and operation of oil extraction, as well as for financial reporting purposes including future profit forecasts.\n\n740.\n\nThe Claimants point out that the Respondent's expert witness on this issue, Mr. Wiggins, agreed with Professor Kalt that, in a fair market valuation, the hypothetical willing seller's ordinary course of business assessment of its reserve adjustment factors and other parameters should be used.\n\n741.\n\nIn the words of Professor Kalt:\n\nI note, however, that it is appropriate to use RAFs developed in the normal course of business of operating and evaluating particular assets. In this case, I have adopted the risking factors of 100% for proved, 50% for probable, and 25% for possible reserves, as developed in the course of business by OEPC.145\n\nRebuttal Expert Report of Joseph P. Kalt dated 12 June 2009 at paragraph 65.\n\n742.\n\nMr. Wiggins gave evidence to the same effect:\n\nQ: [...] So now looking at the willing buyer side of the equation, a willing buyer would look at the operating history of the fields. Isn't that right? The willing buyer would look at the production history of the fields, the reserves, that it is buying. Isn't that right.\n\nA: Yes.146\n\nHearing Transcript (7 November 2009) at page 142.\n\n743.\n\nThe Tribunal notes Professor Kalt's conclusion:\n\n[\u2026] In this case I have adopted the risking factors of 100% for proved, 50% for probable, and 25% for possible reserves, as developed in the course of business by OEPC. I note that these RAFs are conservative from the perspective of the risking factors used by Ecuador itself as operator of Block 15 in the post-termination period. For example in the 2007-2011 Five Year Plan, Ecuador adopts risking factors of 100%, 75% and 50%, respectively. I summarize these factors in Table 4 below:\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| **Table 4** **Reserve Adjustment Factors** |\n| **Category** | **OEPC** | **Ecuador** | **RPS Scotia** |\n| Proved | 100% | 100% | 56-100% |\n| Probable | 50% | 75% | 0-38% |\n| Possible | 25% | 50% | 0-25% |\n\n744.\n\nThe question for the Tribunal is whether to adopt the RAFs of Professor Kalt, which, as he notes, are more conservative than those actually used by Ecuador, or take the RPS Scotia's RAFs, which are based on a composite of figures taken from surveys conducted by the Society of Petroleum Evaluation Engineers (\"SPEE\") and selected industry overviews by the investment banks Donaldson, Lufkin, and Jenrette (\"DLJ\") and Credit Suisse First Boston (\"Credit Suisse\"). It appears to the Tribunal that RPS Scotia's resulting RAFs are inconsistent with the normal course of business RAFs employed in relation to Block 15 by OEPC and Ecuador as shown in Professor Kalt's Table 4.\n\n745.\n\nThe Tribunal is of the view that the Claimants have established that their consistent operational approach to RAFs is reasonable.\n\n746.\n\nThe RPS Scotia approach was compiled from a number of sources including RAFs taken from the SPEE survey, the results of which, as Professor Kalt pointed out, \"represent, at best, general rules of thumb [and] differ substantially from the risk factors actually used by Block 15 operators\".147\n\nRebuttal Expert Report of Joseph P. Kalt dated 12 June 2009 at paragraph 64.\n\n747.\n\nProfessor Kalt pointed out in his criticism of the RPS Scotia RAFs that the DLJ and Credit Suisse estimates were dated from 1999 and 2001 respectively, and that the lack of information regarding the sources of the DLJ and CSFB data as well as their vintage made it difficult to evaluate their applicability in the present context.148\n\nRebuttal Expert Report of Joseph P. Kalt dated 12 June 2009 at paragraph 67 *.*\n\n748.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees with Professor Kalt. It makes eminent good business and legal sense to use OEPC's RAFs. The Tribunal will therefore use the following reserve adjustment factors in its calculation of the fair market value of Block 15:\n\n\u2022 100% for proved reserves\n\n\u2022 50% for probable reserves\n\n\u2022 25% for possible reserves\n\n749.\n\nThe Tribunal recalls that, pursuant to its Procedural Order No. 9, the parties' experts were instructed to use these reserve adjustment factors for the purpose of estimating the fair market value of Block 15.\n\n***6. Oil Price Projections***\n------------------------------\n\n750.\n\nIf the DCF analysis is to serve its purpose, the other parameters used in the model, such as the projected price of oil, must be based on objective and reliable data.\n\n751.\n\nOnce the revenue generated by OEPC's share of Block 15 production has been calculated, the DCF method requires that the forecasted production stream be multiplied by the realized price of the oil produced. In the present case, this means using a forecast of Block 15 crude oil prices based on market conditions existing at the time of the termination of the Participation Contract, *i.e.* 15 May 2006.\n\n752.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the Claimants' expert, Professor Kalt, has used, to effect his calculation, the NYMEX-based WTI (West Texas Intermediate) prices. This approach, he says, is \"common, reliable and conservative\" and is recognized \"as the most reliable basis for projecting prices of crude oil.\"149\n\nExpert Report of Joseph P. Kalt dated 17 September 2007 at paragraph 63.\n\n753.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the Respondent's expert, Mr. Johnston, on the other hand, also uses NYMEX futures pricing which he combines with an average of price forecasts published by SPEE. Mr. Johnston gives NYMEX a 60% weight and the SPEE figures a 40% weight.150\n\nExpert Report of Daniel Johnston dated 9 March 2009 at paragraph 52.\n\n754.\n\nHaving considered the experts' and the parties' written and oral submissions, the Tribunal, for the reasons which follow, has reached the conclusion that Professor Kalt's NYMEX futures price \"strip\" method offers the proper and methodologically sound assessment of actual market expectations and is to be preferred over Mr. Johnston's weighted NYMEX and SPEE approach.\n\n755.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that Mr. Johnston's approach provides an unreliable basis for determining value, principally because it evidently entails a form of double-counting. As Professor Kalt says:\n\nThe double-counting effect arises because, if futures marketplace participants rely on SPEE figures in forming their expectations regarding future oil prices, those expectations have already been factored into the actual prices yielded in NYMEX trading.151\n\nRebuttal Expert Report of Joseph P. Kalt dated 12 June 2009 at paragraph 79.\n\n756.\n\nThe Tribunal further notes that, SPEE itself, in its 2006 Survey, explicitly warns against use of its data for the very purpose for which Mr. Johnston uses it. It writes:\n\nThe SPEE does not endorse the use of the Survey results, either in whole or in part, as a valuation guideline. Neither the Survey nor its contents are intended to dictate Fair Market Value parameters.152\n\nSee SPEE 2006 Survey at page 3, as quoted in Rebuttal Expert Report of Joseph P. Kalt dated 12 June 2009 at paragraph 82.\n\n757.\n\nFinally, the Respondent's assertion that NYMEX prices are not used for actual transactions does not seem well-founded. The U.S. Federal Department of the Interior, for instance, observes that the use of NYMEX in its royalty contracts has several advantages, including the fact that the volume of transactions and the number of participants is so large that, in theory, no one entity could manipulate the resultant price.\n\n758.\n\nThe Tribunal will therefore use the future NYMEX based-WTI prices as the basis for its forecast of crude oil prices from May 2006 in the calculation of the fair market value of Block 15.153 The Tribunal recalls that, pursuant to its Procedural Order No. 9, the parties' experts were instructed to use these prices for the purpose of estimating the fair market value of Block 15.\n\nSee Expert Report of Joseph P. Kalt dated 17 September 2007 at paragraph 62, as well as Exhibit 1 at page 10.\n\n***7. Discount Rate***\n----------------------\n\n759.\n\nThe DCF analysis requires that future cash flows be converted to current dollar cash flows using an appropriate discount rate.\n\n760.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the parties' experts, Professor Kalt and Mr. Johnston, disagreed initially on the proper discount rate to be applied in the instant case given the risk characteristics and the time profile of the Block 15 project. Professor Kalt, in his initial expert report, used a rate of 9.18%, which represents the WACC of OEPC's parent, OPC, in its worldwide operations. Mr. Johnston adopted a 15% discount rate.\n\n761.\n\nAt the end of the day, after having exchanged briefs and rebuttal expert reports, the Claimants, in their Skeleton Submission, wrote that they were prepared to accept \"that the Tribunal may reasonably use either the 10% discount rate that Petroecuador has used or the 12% rate that both parties have used\".\n\n762.\n\nIn fact, the Tribunal notes that Petroamazonas, in both its 2007-2011 and 20082012 Five Year Plans filed with the Ecuadorian *Ministerio de Minas y Petr\u00f3leos*, used a discount rate of 12% which, it stated, reflected the financial, country and industry risks.154\n\nRPS Scotia also used a 12% discount rate when it calculated the value of reserves cash flows in its estimate of reserves for Petroamazonas.\n\n763.\n\nThe Tribunal sees no point in debating the matter further since, in its view, it also considers that a 12% discount rate is appropriate in the circumstances.\n\n764.\n\nTherefore, the Tribunal will use a discount rate of 12% in its determination of the fair market value of Block 15. The Tribunal recalls that, pursuant to its Procedural Order No. 9, the parties' experts were instructed to use a discount rate of 12% for the purpose of estimating the fair market value of Block 15.\n\n***8. Operating (OPEX) and Capital (CAPEX) Expenditure Forecasts***\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n765.\n\nThe differences between the parties regarding operational and capital expenditures are summarized below.\n\n766.\n\nAs to OPEX, the Claimants have based their forecasts through 2019 on their actual 2005 expenditures.\n\n767.\n\nThe Respondent, on the other hand, has used the first four and a half months of OPEX in 2006 to forecast operational expenditures through the life of the Participation Contract.\n\n768.\n\nThe Claimants maintain that the Respondent's approach creates \"a forecast in which costs are significantly and unwarrantedly high year after year\" since \"[t]hat portion was, on a monthly basis, higher than the remainder of expenses which were scheduled to be incurred between May 16, 2006 and year-end\".\n\n769.\n\nThe Respondent criticizes the Claimants' approach since, it says, \"OEPC's 2005 costs [...] are lower and inflate Claimants' DCF valuation\".\n\n770.\n\nNeither approach of the parties finds favour with the Tribunal. While the Tribunal agrees with the Respondent that OEPC's most recent operating costs are the best evidence of its likely costs going forward, it is of the view that a period of 4%\u215f 2 months is too short to provide a reliable forecast. Twelve months of operations would be more reliable.155\n\nSee D.I. Heather and G.B. Wiggins, \"How to Bid Successfully in a Changed Marketplace\" in Oil & Gas Journal (2001), reprinted by LexisNexis at page 3.\n\n771.\n\nThe Tribunal will therefore use the twelve months of OEPC's operating costs incurred directly prior to the *Caducidad* Decree, *i.e*. May 2005 to May 2006, as a reference period to forecast operational expenditures. As noted above156, it will be necessary to adjust the calculation of these expenditures on account of expenses directly related to those reserves which have been subtracted from the Claimants' production profile.\n\nSee*supra* at paragraphs 733 and 737.\n\n772.\n\nThe parties' experts, at the request of the Tribunal pursuant to its Procedural Order No. 9, considered this reference period and opined jointly that, on that basis, the operating costs used in the DCF analysis to forecast the Claimants' operational expenditures should be approximately $151 million.157\n\nSee paragraph 21 and Table 1 on page 6 of the Supplemental Joint Expert Report; see also paragraphs 810 of the Second Supplemental Joint Expert Report.\n\n773.\n\nAs to CAPEX, the parties disagree only as to whether they should be risked.\n\n774.\n\nThe Claimants maintain that capital expenditures are properly risked in a DCF analysis, whereas the Respondent argues that all projects should be accounted for on a \"fully funded\" basis.\n\n775.\n\nThe Claimants maintain that, like other oil and gas companies, they risk their capital in the course of their business planning and evaluation. Referring to their many years of experience in developing Block 15, the Claimants only included a portion of the CAPEX ($243 million) in their DCF model.158\n\nAccording to the experts, these capital costs represent drilling-related capital costs only (see Joint Expert Report at paragraph 22).\n\n776.\n\nThe Respondent, while it recognizes that an oil field operator \"might risk capital expenses in the ordinary course of business,\" says \"[this] is not true in a DCF analysis, which by necessity is frozen in time.\" The Respondent concludes: \"Having claimed credit for [this] production, the parties must also accept all of the capital costs required to fund it.\"\n\n777.\n\nHaving reviewed the evidence on this issue, the Tribunal has decided to give more weight to the Claimants' approach based as it is on their many years of Block 15 operations. The Tribunal agrees with the Claimants that, in a dynamic business such as oil exploration, all projects cannot be accounted for on a fully-funded basis. Some of their capital costs must be risked and the Tribunal finds that the use of a portion of the CAPEX in the DCF model is appropriate.\n\n778.\n\nAs to the appropriate figure of capital costs which should be used by the Tribunal in its DCF analysis, the Tribunal accepts the joint conclusion of the parties' experts that, in addition to the costs of $243 million159 which represent drilling-related capital costs only, the facilities-related capital costs associated with the base production profile of 240 million barrels, to wit $203 million, should also be incorporated in its cash flow analysis.160\n\nAdjusted by the experts to take account of certain delays in drilling and reclassification of reserves (see Joint Expert Report at paragraph 21).\n\nSee Joint Expert Report at paragraph 22. The Tribunal has noted that Mr. Daniel Johnston, in an Appendix to the Second Supplemental Joint Expert Report, questions OEPC's risking methodology which, he concludes, \"understates drilling costs, potentially overstates reserves and certainly overstates fair market value\" (at page 13). The Tribunal notes however that at the Hearing on 30 June 2011, Mr. Johnston acknowledged that had an alternative approach been adopted in this regard, it would not have yielded anything beyond a \"fairly modest\" difference (see Hearing Transcript of 30 June 2011at pages 54-55)\n\n***9. Use of Comparable Sales***\n--------------------------------\n\n779.\n\nThe Tribunal recalls that it has formed the view that the discounted cash flow method is the most widely used and generally accepted method in the oil and gas industry for valuing sales or acquisitions.\n\n780.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the examination of comparable sales is also critical \"because it allows the evaluator to test the reasonableness of the DCF assumptions against market conditions.\"\n\n781.\n\nThe Claimants maintain that it is inappropriate to use a comparable sales analysis in this case. They write: \"Each oil and gas property presents a unique set of value parameters: size, quality of oil, type of contractual relationship, environmental or remedial obligations.\" There is also the difference in oil prices which, the Claimants submit, can make the comparable unreliable.\n\n782.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the Respondent's expert, Mr. Daniel Johnston, in his own publication, acknowledges the difficulty in finding truly comparable situations.161 SPEE also recommends caution with the use of alternate methods of valuation.162\n\nDavid Johnston and Daniel Johnston, *Introduction to Oil Company Financial Analysis* (2006, PennWell) at page 24.\n\nSPEE, *Perspectives on the Fair Market Value of Oil and Gas Interests* (2002) at page 43.\n\n783.\n\nThe Tribunal has reviewed the parties' competing submissions in respect of this issue. The Tribunal finds very convincing Professor Kalt's demonstration that the comparable sales approach of the Respondent's expert, RPS Scotia, is unreliable in this 0000000000 case.163\n\nRebuttal Expert Report of Joseph P. Kalt dated 12 June 2009 at paragraphs 120-145, as well as Rebuttal Figures 5-9.\n\n784.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the EnCana sale \"as of 30 August 2005\" to Andes of its shares in AEC which, as the Tribunal recalls, held a 40% economic interest in the Participation Contract, \"presents a unique situation.\" The Tribunal agrees that this \"comparable\" needs to be addressed separately.\n\n785.\n\nThe Claimants disagree with the Respondent. They argue that the Supplemental Indemnity Agreement (\"SIA\") was a negotiated figure arrived at under the threat of *caducidad*. The Claimants also rely on Professor Kalt's Rebuttal Expert Report to buttress their submission that the EnCana sale is \"an inapt choice for a comparable analysis\".164\n\nRebuttal Expert Report of Joseph P. Kalt dated 12 June 2009 at paragraphs 146-154.\n\n786.\n\nThere is no doubt that the EnCana sales contract and its Appendix 1, the SIA, was executed at a time when *caducidad* was very much under consideration by the Ecuadorian authorities, to wit 30 August 2005. In fact, the Tribunal notes the obvious reference to \" *caducidad* \" in the SIA as well as the following provision in the preamble to the SIA:\n\nWhereas, Seller and EnCana agree to indemnify Purchaser or its permitted assignee as provided for in this Agreement in the event the relevant Governmental Authorities take certain actions with respect to the Block 15 Contract.\n\n787.\n\nHaving considered the parties' arguments and the evidence of their respective witnesses and experts, the Tribunal agrees with the Claimants that \"each oil and gas property presents a unique set of value parameters\". Therefore, the Tribunal concludes that it can derive no assistance from an analysis of the seven transactions which the Respondent has submitted as comparable sales.\n\n788.\n\nAs for the EnCana sale, the Tribunal has decided that it is not a useful comparable and thus should not be taken into consideration in the determination of the fair market value of the Participation Contract, mainly for the following reasons: (i) the important difference in oil prices between 30 August 2005 and 15 May 2006; and (ii) the inclusion of non-Block 15 assets (Tarapoa, Block 14, Block 17 and the Sherepino Block) in the August 2005 transaction.\n\n***10. Consequential Damages***\n-------------------------------\n\n789.\n\nThe Claimants allege that they have also suffered consequential damages as a result of the *Caducidad* Decree. They claim:\n\n(i) OEPC's ship-or-pay commitments of $194 million owed to OCP S.A. under the Initial Shipper Transportation Agreement (the previously-defined \"ISTA\");\n\n(ii) employee severance costs for early termination of $7 million; and\n\n(iii) a stranded cargo, valued at $1 million, which the Claimants were forced to abandon at the time of the *Caducidad* Decree.\n\n***(a) Preliminary Issues***\n----------------------------\n\n790.\n\nThere are two preliminary issues with respect to the Claimants' claims for consequential damages. The Respondent maintains that such claims are not recoverable under international law or Ecuadorian law. The Claimants disagree. They argue firstly that the remedies for any violation of the Treaty is \"by necessity\" governed by international law because every treaty breach is a breach of international law.\n\n791.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees with the Claimants. Numerous tribunals have so held.165\n\nSee, *e.g.,* *Siemens A.G. v. The Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/02/8), Award of 6 February 2007 at paragraph 352; *Watkins-Johnson v. The Islamic Republic of Iran*, Award of 27 July 1989, reprinted in Iran-U.S. C.T.R., volume 22 (1990) 218 at paragraphs 114-117; *Uiterwyk v. The Islamic Republic of Iran*, Partial Award of 6 July 1988, reprinted in 19 Iran-U.S. C.T.R. 107 at paragraph 117.\n\n792.\n\nThe availability of consequential loss in international law is uncontroversial. The starting point is the principle of \"full reparation\", expressed by the Permanent Court of International Justice in the *Chorz\u00f3w Factory* case as follows:\n\n[R]eparation must, so far as possible, wipe out all the consequences of the illegal act and reestablish the situation which would, in all probability, have existed if that act had not been committed.166\n\n*Case concerning the Factory at Chorzow* (Claim for Indemnity) (Merits), P.C.I.J. Series A, No. 17 (Judgement of 13 September 1928) at page 47.\n\n793.\n\nThis principle is now also embodied in Article 31 of the International Law Commission's Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts which, as previously observed, states:\n\n*Article 31. Reparation*\n\n1. The responsible State is under an obligation to make full reparation for the injury caused by the internationally wrongful act.\n\n2. Injury includes any damage, whether material or moral, caused by the internationally wrongful act of a State.\n\n794.\n\nMarboe states simply:\n\nAccording to the principle of full reparation [\u2026] consequential damage must [\u2026] be taken into account.167\n\nIrmgard Marboe, *Calculation of Compensation and Damages in International Investment Law* (Oxford University Press, 2009) at paragraph 5,394; see also*ibid.* at paragraph 7.16.\n\n795.\n\nAs to the standard of causation, Marboe concludes that the \"direct/indirect\" dichotomy is now seen as unhelpful in international law, and instead \"[i]nternational practice seems so far to have relied on two main criteria: \u2018causality' and \u2018provability'\".168\n\n*Ibid.* at paragraphs 5,395-5.397.\n\n796.\n\nMarboe categorizes \"liability to subcontractors,\" for instance, as an \"accepted\" head of consequential loss in international law, subject to the caveat that the quantum of such liability must be proved with sufficient certainty.169 In this connection, Marboe notably refers to the previously-cited ICSID case of *Siemens A.G. v. The Argentine Republic*, in which the \"potential liability\" of the plaintiff to subcontractors (that is, liability under claims that might be made in the future) was the subject of an award.\n\n*Ibid*. at paragraphs 5,404-5.407.\n\n797.\n\nTherefore, the Tribunal accepts the submission of the Claimants that, in principle, consequential damage is a valid head of loss in international law. In this regard, the Tribunal recalls that even the Respondent, in its written submissions, conceded that \"consequential damages are compensable under international law under certain circumstances.\"\n\n798.\n\nFurthermore, the Claimants argue that, even if Ecuadorian law applied, they would be entitled to consequential damages. The Respondent, however, contends that consequential damages are by definition \"indirect\" damages and hence unrecoverable under Ecuadorian law. In the words of the Respondent's expert, Dr. Alfredo Corral Borrero, under Ecuadorian law, \"the debtor has no indemnification obligations for *mediate* or *indirect* damages that might have been caused to the creditor.\" (Emphasis in original) But the Tribunal also notes that the Claimants' expert on this issue, Dr. P\u00e9rez Loose, explained that, under Ecuadorian law, compensation must \"retur[n] the obligee to the economic situation he should have been in were it not for the act attributable to the liable party.\" It is thus clear that Ecuadorian law does not bar the recovery of consequential damages in a situation such as that which obtains in the present case.\n\n***(b) The Claimants' Position***\n---------------------------------\n\n***(i) Ship-or-Pay damages***\n-----------------------------\n\n799.\n\nAs mentioned earlier in this Award170, in order to transport production from various fields in eastern Ecuador, including from Block 15, to the port of Balao, Ecuador contracted with a consortium of companies to build and operate the OCP pipeline.\n\nSee*supra* at paragraph 143.\n\n800.\n\nTo finance the construction and continued operation of the pipeline, OCP S.A. entered into a number of transportation contracts with individual shippers (the previously-defined \"ISTAs\"), including with OEPC.\n\n801.\n\nThe ISTAs provide that, for a certain period, the shippers pay a monthly tariff rate sufficient to cover the costs of the pipeline. In addition, the ISTAs contain a provision known as a \"ship-or-pay\" requirement whereby a shipper is responsible for paying tariffs based on a certain minimum level of throughput even if the shipper's actual production is insufficient to meet this minimum level.\n\n802.\n\nFrom the date of the *Caducidad* Decree and the resulting termination of the Block 15 Participation Contract, OEPC continues to bear the contractual obligation to pay tariffs pursuant to the ship-or-pay requirement under its ISTA with OCP S.A.\n\n803.\n\nThe Claimants claim damages from the Respondent in respect of a portion of these tariffs. That portion is the difference between (i) tariffs for oil that OEPC cannot ship because of the Respondent's breach (*i.e.* the full extent of OEPC's ship-or-pay commitment, because it can ship *no* oil); and (ii) tariffs for oil that OEPC could not have shipped in any event (*i.e.* because of its inevitable non-use of some capacity due to Block 15 production levels falling short of its total ship-or-pay commitment).\n\n**(ii) Employee Termination Costs**\n-----------------------------------\n\n804.\n\nAs a direct result of the *Caducidad* Decree, say the Claimants, they had to pay approximately $7 million in employee severance costs for early termination of the Participation Contract.\n\n805.\n\nWhile the Claimants acknowledge that they would have had to pay some of these costs at the conclusion of the Participation Contract in 2019, they state that \"it is Ecuador's burden to demonstrate how much of the $7M claimed should be reduced.\"\n\n**(iii) Value of a Stranded Cargo**\n-----------------------------------\n\n806.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, at the time of the *Caducidad* Decree, OEPC had a \"cargo at the port of Esmeralda which it was forced to abandon\". They aver that by the terms of the *Caducidad* Decree, the title to all of OEPC's assets in Ecuador passed to the Respondent, including this stranded cargo which they value at $1 million.\n\n***(c) The Respondent's Position***\n-----------------------------------\n\n**(i) Ship-or-Pay Damages**\n---------------------------\n\n807.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the Claimants' claim for this head of damages should be dismissed on the following five grounds:\n\n*First,* Claimants' claim fails for lack of causation. The Ship-or-Pay expenses were based, required, and caused by Claimants' own obligations towards OCP S.A., not by the *Caducidad* Decree. As explained in prior submissions, claims for payments made in fulfillment of contractual obligations that are *res inter alios* *acta* with respect to the respondent State are commonly rejected by international tribunals on grounds of lack of causation and/or remoteness.\n\n*Second,* it remains undisputed that (*i*) to be compensable, damages have to be foreseeable, and (*ii*) the Ship-or-Pay costs were not foreseeable at the time the Participation Contract was executed in May 1999. As Mr. Rivkin reminded the Tribunal at the damages hearing, \" *the OCP pipeline was constructed in 200103,* \" *i.e.,* more than two years after the Participation Contract. In 1999, the OCP pipeline project did not even exist, nor had any contracts related to the OCP been entered into.\n\nEcuador already noted in its Rejoinder on Quantum that \"Claimants have remained silent\" on the issue of foreseeability of their Ship-or-Pay damages. Claimants' continued silence is an implicit recognition that their claims fails for lack of foreseeability.\n\n*Third,* Claimants do not dispute that they had a duty to mitigate their Ship-or-Pay costs. They have remained silent, however, as to their wilful assumption of risk in relation to the Ship-or-Pay costs. Ecuador pointed out numerous times that despite contemplating in the OCP contract the risks of \"Upstream Expropriatory Action\" and \"Equity Expropriatory Event,\" Claimants failed to secure a contractual provision allowing termination of the OCP contract, or the suspension of tariff payments, in the event of *caducidad.* Consistent with international law, this Tribunal should not protect Claimants against willingly taken investment risks.\n\n*Fourth,* Claimants are still at a loss to satisfy their burden of proof. In particular, Claimants do not dispute the inherently speculative nature of their claim. Nothing prevents Claimants from finding someone else to take over their shipping commitment. In fact, Claimants' shipping contract expressly allowed them to assign their Ship-or-Pay rights. Were Claimants to prevail on this claim and, thereafter, sell their OCP capacity, they would be unjustly enriched.\n\n*Finally,* Claimants have inflated their Ship-or-Pay claim by (*i*) estimating their costs on the basis of an incorrect assumption of reserves; and (*ii*) failed to take into account OEPC's release of rigs immediately prior to *caducidad,* which would have diminished Block 15's production and its ability to allocate oil towards its OCP capacity even if *caducidad* had not been declared. (Emphasis in original)\n\n***(ii) Employee Termination Costs***\n-------------------------------------\n\n808.\n\nThe Respondent avers, principally, that OEPC would have had to pay employee termination costs, in any event, at the conclusion of the Participation Contract in 2019 and that, therefore, such costs were not caused by the *Caducidad* Decree. In other words, such costs would have been incurred in the normal course of business at the expiration of the Participation Contract's contractual term.\n\n809.\n\nIn addition, says the Respondent, employee termination costs are part of the operational costs (OPEX) for the last year of contract performance and accordingly should have been included in the Claimants' DCF analysis. The Claimants have failed to factor in these costs which would have reduced the value a willing buyer would have paid for Block 15 as of May 2006.\n\n810.\n\nFinally, the Respondent argues that, by seeking to shift to it the burden of proof as to how much of the $7 million claimed \"would have had to be paid and when,\" the Claimants have recognized that they have not been able to meet their burden of proof.\n\n**(iii) Value of a Stranded Cargo**\n-----------------------------------\n\n811.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, the Claimants were not obliged to abandon any cargo as a result of the *Caducidad* Decree. The Claimants, the Respondent says, have failed to satisfy their burden of proof. They have not adduced any evidence, the Respondent maintains, of the existence of the cargo or its value.\n\n***(d) The Tribunal's Conclusions***\n------------------------------------\n\n**(i) Ship-or-Pay Damages**\n---------------------------\n\n812.\n\nAt the outset, the Tribunal notes that, quite properly, the Claimants have included their ship-or-pay payments as costs in their DCF model since, had there been no *Caducidad* Decree, they would have made those payments to OCP S.A. in order to ship the oil produced in Block 15.\n\n813.\n\nIn addition to arguing that consequential damages are not recoverable under international law nor under Ecuadorian law, arguments which the Tribunal disposed of earlier, the Respondent raises several defenses to this claim:\n\n(i) there was a lack of causation, because the ship-or-pay losses were caused by the Claimants' obligations to third parties;\n\n(ii) the losses were not foreseeable;\n\n(iii) the Claimants' quantification of these losses is wrong, because it is based on incorrect assumptions of reserves and a failure to account for the two missing rigs;\n\n(iv) the Claimants have failed to mitigate these losses;\n\n(v) the Claimants were contributorially negligent in failing to negotiate terms with the other OCP parties that would protect them from *caducidad* or similar events; and\n\n(vi) finally, these losses are speculative, because the Claimants can still assign OEPC's ship-or-pay rights, and if they did so a damages award would leave them unjustly enriched.\n\n814.\n\nAfter having considered carefully the parties' written and oral arguments in respect of these several defenses, the Tribunal has come to the conclusion that the Claimants' claim for \"ship-or-pay\" damages fails principally on account of the Respondent's defenses iii) and vi) set out in the previous paragraph. Put simply, the Tribunal concludes that the Claimants have failed to discharge their burden of proof.\n\n815.\n\nThe Claimants have admitted that their release, prior to the *Caducidad* Decree, of two drilling rigs in Block 15 impacted negatively their production of oil. Yet, they failed to take account of the impact on production of these released rigs in the calculation of their ship-or-pay damages.\n\n816.\n\nThe Tribunal has ruled earlier in this Award that the absence of these two rigs necessitated an adjustment to OEPC's production profile. To be logical, the absence of these two rigs also requires an adjustment by the Tribunal to the quantification of post *caducidad* ship-or-pay losses. The evidence in the record as to the precise level of that adjustment is, to say the least, unclear. The Claimants have failed to meet their burden of proof and left the Tribunal to speculate as to the calculation of the necessary adjustment. This the Tribunal will not do.\n\n817.\n\nThe Claimants have also failed to satisfy their burden of proof when they were met by the Respondent's argument that, since the ISTA with OCP S.A. allowed them to assign the ship-or-pay rights, the Claimants would be unjustly enriched if, after having prevailed on this claim, they were able to sell some or all of their OCP capacity.\n\n818.\n\nWhile there is a possibility that the Claimants may not be able to assign any of their OCP capacity in the future171, the Tribunal cannot rule out the possibility that other oil producers who have also contracted with OCP will, in the future, until 2019, use the Claimants' capacity in the OCP pipeline.\n\nExcept to the extent of $6.1 million which they have already deducted from their claim.\n\n819.\n\nThis leads the Tribunal to conclude that the Claimants' claim for ship-or-pay damages is inherently speculative. There is no satisfactory evidence in the record which allows the Tribunal to value the possibility of an assignment in the future. The Tribunal therefore finds that the Claimants' claim for ship-or-pay damages fails for lack of proof and their claim for $194 million is accordingly denied.\n\n***(ii) Employee Termination Costs***\n-------------------------------------\n\n820.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees with the Respondent that the employee termination costs payable in 2019 cannot be attributed to the *Caducidad* Decree. The Tribunal also agrees that the Claimants should have included in their DCF analysis, as part of their operational costs (OPEX) for the last year of the Participation Contract, these employee termination costs.\n\n821.\n\nBy factoring in these costs and using Professor Kalt's economic model, \"the FMV impact of Termination Costs in 2019 would be $7.6 M.\" These costs will thus be incorporated into the Tribunal's DCF analysis.172\n\nSee Joint Expert Report at paragraph 23.\n\n***(iii) Value of a Stranded Cargo***\n-------------------------------------\n\n822.\n\nThe Tribunal has noted Mr. Ellis' statement that OEPC \"had to abandon\" a cargo which reverted to the Respondent upon the *Caducidad* Decree. However, the Claimants have been unable to refer to any contractual provision under the Participation Contract to support Mr. Ellis' statement.\n\n823.\n\nIn addition, the Claimants' claim also fails for lack of sufficient and satisfactory evidence as to both the existence and the value of the cargo. The Claimants' claim of $1 million is therefore denied.\n\n***11. Calculation of Damages***\n--------------------------------\n\n824.\n\nUsing the economic model agreed by Professor Kalt and Mr. Johnston, the Tribunal, informed by all the findings that it has made in the present Section of its Award and assisted by Professor Kalt and Mr. Johnston's agreed calculations, determines that the Net Present Value of the discounted cash flows generated by the Block 15 OEPC production as of 16 May 2006 is US$ 2,359,500.000 (US Two billion, three hundred fifty nine millions and five hundred thousand dollars).173\n\nSee Table 1 provided by the parties' experts, Professor Kalt and Mr. Johnston, at the hearing on 30 June 2011.\n\n825.\n\nHaving determined earlier that the Claimants' damages should be reduced by a factor of 25% because of their own wrongful act which contributed in a material way to the damages which they subsequently suffered when the *Caducidad* Decree was issued on 15 May 2006, the Claimants' damages for the expropriation by Ecuador of their interest in the Participation Contract amount to US$ 1,769,625.000 (US One billion, seven hundred sixty nine millions, six hundred twenty five thousand dollars)174 which the Tribunal orders the Respondent to pay.\n\nUS$ 2,359,500.000 - US$ 589,875,000 (25%)= US$ 1,769,625.000\n\n***12. Interest***\n------------------\n\n826.\n\nThe Tribunal must now determine the interest to be awarded to the Claimants, *i.e.* the rate, whether simple or compound interest will be awarded, and the period during which interest will accrue.\n\n***(a) The Claimants' Position***\n---------------------------------\n\n827.\n\nThe starting point is to identify what the Claimants have sought with regard to interest. Their Request for Arbitration claimed an award, *inter alia*, \"[d]irecting Respondents to pay Claimants interest on all sums awarded, in amounts to be determined at the hearing [...]\".\n\n828.\n\nIn their Memorial on Damages, the Claimants sought compound interest and indicated that Professor Kalt \"used a conservative rate in calculating interest: the monthly rate paid on U.S. Government T-bills compounded on a monthly basis. As of the date of this filing that interest rate was 4,188%.\"\n\n829.\n\nProfessor Kalt calculated interest in his DCF model at the monthly interest rate paid on U.S Government Treasury Bills compounded on a monthly basis from the day after the expropriation date of 15 May 2006, *i.e.* 16 May 2006.175 Claiming interest from the expropriation date accords with the normal principle usually applied in cases of expropriation, since it is from that date that the deprivation has been suffered. This principle is supported by the doctrine and the jurisprudence of international tribunals.176\n\nAppendix 1 and Rebuttal Witness Statement of Joseph P. Kalt dated 12 June 2009 at paragraph 11.\n\nSee*e.g.* *Southern Pacific Properties (Middle East) v. The Arab Republic of Egypt* (ICSID Case No. ARB/84/3), Award of 20 May 1992 at paragraph 234.\n\n830.\n\nIn their Memorial on Damages, the Claimants requested that interest calculated on the basis above be awarded \"through the date of full and effective payment\" of any damages awarded by the Tribunal.\n\n***(b) The Respondent's Position***\n-----------------------------------\n\n831.\n\nAlthough the Respondent has not specifically challenged the Claimants' approach to calculating interest, reference was made by the Respondent to a recent award by an ICSID tribunal where Ecuador was also the respondent.177 In this award, the tribunal applied Ecuadorian, not international law, noting that the \"prohibition of compound interest contained in the local law must be enforced\". Reference to this award was made by the Respondent in this case to support a different point, namely its submission that the Claimants' claim for consequential damages should be rejected as it cannot be awarded under Ecuadorian law. As seen earlier in this Award, this submission ultimately failed.\n\n*Duke Energy Electroquil Partners & Electroquil S.A. v. The Republic of Ecuador* (ICSID Case No. ARB/4/19) *,* Award of 18 August 2008.\n\n832.\n\nMr. Johnston, on behalf of the Respondent, provides as follows: \"Just as Claimants have accounted for interest (at 5% annually) from *caducidad* to the effective date of Dr. Kalt's rebuttal witness statement (June 12, 2009), I have calculated interest from May 16, 2006 to June 12, 2009.\"178 Mr. Johnston then sets out the following table:179\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  | **Johnston Damages Valuation** **(as of May 16, 2006)** |\n| **Block 15** **Production** | **OCP Ship-or-Pay** | **Termination** **Costs** | **Total** |\n| **$MM** | **$MM** | **$MM** | **$MM.** |\n| **$1,500** | **$133** | **$8** | **$1,641** |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  | **Johnston Damages Valuation** **(as of June 12, 2009)** |\n| **Block 15** **Production** | **OCP Ship-or-Pay** | **Termination** **Costs** | **Total** |\n| **$MM** | **$MM** | **$MM** | **$MM.** |\n| **$1,743** | **$154** | **$9.3** | **$1,906** |\n\nRebuttal Report of Daniel Johnston dated 8 September 2009 at page 5.\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n833.\n\nIt is not possible to calculate the precise components of Mr. Johnston's calculations but it appears from the above that he has generally followed Professor Kalt's approach, albeit by applying an annual rate of 5% as opposed to the monthly rate paid on U.S. Government T-bills.\n\n***(c) Recent Trends in Relation to Interest in ICSID Awards***\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\n***(i) Simple v. Compound Interest***\n-------------------------------------\n\n834.\n\nThe traditional norm was to award simple interest. However, this practice has changed and, in fact, most recent awards provide for compound interest.180 This practice accords with the *Chorz\u00f3w* principle as an award of compound interest will usually reflect the actual damages suffered.181\n\nPeter Muchlinski, Federico Ortino & Christoph Schreuer, *The Oxford Handbook of International Investment Law* (Oxford University Press, 2008) at page 1107.\n\nThe situation was helpfully summarized in *Compa\u00f1\u00eda de Aguas del Aconquija S.A. & Vivendi Universal S.A. v. The Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/97/3), Award of 20 August 2007 at paragraphs 9.2.1-9.2.8.\n\n835.\n\nAn analysis of recent interest awards demonstrates that in 2007, all tribunals, expect one, awarded compound interest.182 In the 2008-2009 period, six out of ten tribunals awarded compound interest.183 Several more recent cases have also awarded compound interest.184\n\nKarl P. Sauvant, ed., *Yearbook on International Investment Law and Policy 2009-2010* (Oxford University Press, 2010) at page 156.\n\n*Ibid.*\n\nSee*El Paso International Company v. Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/03/15) (31 October 2011) at paragraph 746; *Impregiio S.p.A v. Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/07/17) (21 June 2011) at paragraph 382; *Joseph Charles Lemire v. Ukraine* (ICSID Case No. ARB/06/18) (28 March 2011) at paragraphs 360-361; *Alpha Projektholding GMBH v. Ukraine* (ICSID Case No. ARB/07/16) (8 November 2010) at paragraph 514 and *Gemplus S.A. and Talsud S.A. v. The United Mexican States* (ICSID Case Nos. ARB(AF)/04/3 and ARB(AF)/04/4) (16 June 2010) at paragraphs 16-26.\n\n836.\n\nOf the four tribunals which awarded simple interest in the 2008-2009 period, only one case was in relation to damages awarded for expropriation, namely *Saipem S.p.A. v.* *The People's Republic of Bangladesh*.185 That case arose from a prior ICC award that had been declared non-existent by the courts of Bangladesh, an act which among others, the ISCID tribunal held amounted to an illegal expropriation. In the ICSID arbitration, the claimants claimed the amount awarded to it by the ICC tribunal plus interest. The claimants requested that simple interest be awarded up until the date of the expropriation (being the interest awarded in the ICC award) with compound interest to accrue from that date. However, the tribunal was not prepared to award interest going beyond that allocated by the ICC arbitrators and a simple rate was subsequently awarded for the entire interest period.\n\nICSID Case No. ARB/05/7.\n\n837.\n\nSimple interest was awarded in *Desert Line Projects LLC v. The Republic of Yemen*.186 In this case, the claimant had claimed compound interest on the damages awarded at a rate of 7%. The respondent argued, *inter alia*, that compound interest could not be awarded on the basis that (i) international tribunals generally rule against the award of compound interest; (ii) the award of compound interest was contrary to Yemeni law; (iii) and the claimants had not advanced any reason for an award of compound interest.187 The tribunal considered that the appropriate rate of interest was a simple rate of 5% per annum.188 No reasons were provided in this regard.\n\nICSID Case No. ARB/05/17.\n\nAward of 6 February 2008 (ICSID) at paragraph 294.\n\n*Ibid.* at paragraph 295.\n\n838.\n\nSimple interest was also awarded in the case *Duke Energy Electroquil Partners & Electroquil S.A. v. The Republic of Ecuador*189 referred to earlier, where the tribunal applied the domestic Ecuadorian law to the issue of interest. In that case, the tribunal ruled that the Government breached both Ecuadorian law and the U.S.-Ecuador investment treaty. However, the damages awarded related to the breach of contract claims under Ecuadorian law only and no additional damages were awarded for the breach of international law. It was not an expropriation case. The tribunal further observes that in that case, the respondent had objected to the use of compound interest on the ground that it is prohibited under Ecuadorian law and added that, even under international law, an award of compound interest would not be in conformity with earlier decisions in investment disputes. In reliance on *Compa\u00f1\u00eda del Desarrollo de Santa Elena, S.A. v. The Republic of Costa Rica*190, in particular, as well as on *Autopista Concesionada de Venezuela, C.A. v. The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela*191 and *Marvin Roy Feldman Karpa v. The United Mexican States*192, it noted that compound interest may be awarded for expropriation but not for contract claims.193 The tribunal agreed with the respondent's argument in favour of simple interest.194\n\n*Supra* note 177.\n\nICSID Case No. ARB/96/1.\n\nICSID Case No. ARB/00/5.\n\nICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/99/1.\n\nSupra note177, at paragraph 432.\n\n*Ibid.* at paragraph 457.\n\n839.\n\nThe fourth award where simple interest was awarded, which is the case of *Duke Energy International Peru Investments No. 1, Limited v. The Republic of Peru*195, was in relation to claims regarding tax stabilization where the rate stipulated by the national tax authority for tax refunds applied.\n\nICSID Case No. ARB/03/28.\n\n840.\n\nIn summary, it may be seen that compound interest is the norm in recent expropriation cases under ICSID. The Tribunal sees no reason to depart from the norm and from the basis pleaded by both parties\n\n**(ii) Interest Rate**\n----------------------\n\n841.\n\nOf the six tribunals who awarded compound interest rates in 2008-2009, the majority applied the U.S. 6 month LIBOR rate though a \"commercially reasonable rate\" and a \"reasonable rate\" were also used.196 More recent cases have either adopted a fixed percentage or a LIBOR plus margin rate.197\n\nKarl P. Sauvant, ed., *Yearbook on International Investment Law and Policy 2009-2010* (Oxford University Press, 2010) at page 156.\n\nSee*El Paso International Company v. Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/03/15) (31 October 2011) at paragraph 745 (LIBOR plus 2%); *Impregilo S.p.A v. Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/07/17) (21 June 2011) at paragraph 383 (6%); *Joseph Charles Lemire v. Ukraine* (ICSID Case No. ARB/06/18) (28 March 2011) at paragraph 356 (LIBOR plus 2%); *Alpha Projektholding GMBH v. Ukraine* (ICSID Case No. ARB/07/16) (8 November 2010) at paragraph 514 (9.11%) and *Gemplus S.A. and Telsud S.A. v. The United Mexican States* (ICSID Case Nos. ARB(AF)/04/3 and ARB(AF)/04/4) (16 June 2010) at paragraphs 18-7 (2%).\n\n842.\n\nIn the present case, the Claimants have requested the US Government Treasury bill rate which reflects a prudent, risk-free and conservative re-investment practice. As noted earlier, at the time of filing their Memorial on Damages, that interest rate was 4,188%. The Respondent's expert, on the other hand, has applied an annual interest rate of 5% which, at the time of filing his report, was very similar to the monthly rate paid on U.S. Government T-bills as calculated by the Claimants' expert. The Tribunal therefore considers that a 4,188% annual interest rate is reasonable in the circumstances.\n\n***(iii) Compounding Intervals***\n---------------------------------\n\n843.\n\nThere are no general rules regarding the compounding intervals.198\n\nIrmgard Marboe, *Calculation of Compensation and Damages in International Investment Law* (Oxford University Press, 2009) at paragraphs 6,210-6.212.\n\n844.\n\nOf the six tribunals who awarded compound interest rates in 2008-2009, two awards compounded annually and the remaining four compounded semi-annually.199 More recent awards have also favoured annual or semi-annual compounding.200\n\nKarl P. Sauvant, ed., *Yearbook on International Investment Law and Policy 2009-2010* (Oxford University Press, 2010) at Table 1 \"Damages\" at pages 165 and following.\n\nThe *El Paso* Award (ICSID Case No. ARB/03/15) compounded semi-annually, as did the *Lemire v. Ukraine* Award (ICSID Case No. ARB/06/18). *Impregilo* (ICSID Case No. ARB/07/17), *Alpha Projektholding* (ICSID Case No. ARB/07/16) and *Gemplus and Talsud* (ICSID Case Nos. ARB(AF)/04/3 and ARB(AF)/04/4) all provided for annual compounding of interest.\n\n845.\n\nIn the present case, although monthly compounding has been used by the Claimants' expert, Professor Kalt, with no apparent objection by the Respondent's expert, Mr. Johnston, the Tribunal is of the view that granting monthly compounding would be unduly favourable to the Claimants in view of recent trends in investment arbitration. It may be argued that, given this decision, semi-annual compounding would be appropriate, as the interest rate adopted by the Tribunal is not high. However, not without hesitation, the Tribunal has decided, in its discretion, that annual compounding is appropriate, given the large amount of the Award and the number of years that have passed since the violation.\n\n***(d) The Period during which Interest Must Accrue***\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n846.\n\nIt is undisputable that the period during which interest must accrue begins on 16 May 2006, the day after the expropriation, as in Professor Kalt's DCF calculation.\n\n847.\n\nFurthermore, the Tribunal concludes that (as requested by the Claimants) interest should run until the date of payment of the present Award, in accordance with established practice as illustrated, for example, by the cases *Walter Bau Ag (in liquidation) v. The Kingdom of Thailand*201, *RSM Production Corporation and others v. Grenada*202 and *Desert Line Projects LLC v. The Republic of Yemen*.203\n\nAward of 1 July 2009 (UNCITRAL).\n\nICSID Case No. ARB/10/6.\n\nICSID Case No. ARB/05/17.\n\n***(e) The Tribunal's Conclusion***\n-----------------------------------\n\n848.\n\nFor all of these reasons, the Tribunal finds that the Claimants are entitled to preaward interest at the rate of 4,188% per annum, compounded annually from 16 May 2006 until the date of the present Award. The Tribunal observes that this approach is consistent with the terms of the BIT, which expressly provides at Article III for \"interest at a commercially reasonable rate from the date of expropriation.\"\n\n849.\n\nAs noted above, the Claimants did not specifically distinguish between pre-award and post-award interest, requesting that interest be awarded on the basis proposed by the Claimants up to the date of full and effective payment. It is not uncommon for tribunals to distinguish between pre- and post-award interest204 and in the present case it seems appropriate to do so, given the current LIBOR interest rates, used as a base rate by banks and other financial institutions, are very low; but, of course, the rates will fluctuate before the Award is settled. In the circumstances, and since the Tribunal cannot predict when the Respondent will settle the sums which it has been ordered to pay to the Claimants, the Tribunal considers that it would be fair to order that post-award interest should accrue in favour of the Claimants at the U.S. 6 month LIBOR rate compounded on a monthly basis.\n\n*Emilio Agust\u00edn Maffezini v. Kingdom of Spain (* ICSID Case No. ARB/97/7) (9 November 2000) at paragraph 97; *Metalclad Corporation v. The United Mexican States* (ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/97/1) (25 August 2000) at paragraph 131; and *ADC Affiliate Ltd. and ADC & ADMC Management Ltd. v. The Republic of Hungary* (ICSID Case No. ARB/03/16) (27 September 2006) at paragraph 522.\n\n***13. Ecuadorian Taxes***\n--------------------------\n\n850.\n\nThe damages sought by the Claimants in this proceeding have been calculated by the Claimants on an after-tax basis. More particularly, the Claimants have deducted the following from their damages calculations: (i) Ecuadorian income tax, (ii) labor participation or \" *utilidades* \" tax, (iii) an asset-based tax, and (iv) the ECORAE tax, which is a per-barrel assessment on oil.\n\n851.\n\nDuring the quantum phase of this proceeding, the Claimants have sought confirmation on the part of the Respondent that it will not seek to collect taxes on any award that the Claimants may receive. In response, the Respondent asserts that the Claimants' request for such confirmation is irrelevant and speculative at best.\n\n852.\n\nThe Claimants accordingly submit that \"the Tribunal may need to determine damages on a *pre* -tax basis.\" (Emphasis in original) Alternatively, the Claimants make the following request:\n\nIf the Tribunal awards damages on an after-tax basis, Claimants request that the award explicitly state that taxes have already been deemed to have been paid to avoid future litigation over these issues. In the event that the Tribunal awards damages based on the Treaty and those damages are no different in quantum from the contract damages, the Tribunal could award damages solely to Occidental Petroleum Corporation. OPC is not an Ecuadorian entity and is not subject to Ecuadorian tax or labor participation claims.\n\n853.\n\nThe Tribunal observes that both Professor Kalt and Mr. Johnston have indicated that their respective quantum calculations have been made on an after-tax basis. In the circumstances, the Tribunal agrees with the Respondent that the Claimants' request is speculative and premature. The request is accordingly denied.\n\n**H. The Tribunal's Findings in connection with the Respondent's Counterclaim**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n854.\n\nIn this arbitration, the Respondent, as noted earlier, has put forward a counterclaim on the basis of the four following allegations:\n\n(i) malicious prosecution (*abuso del derecho)* in relation to this ICSID proceeding;\n\n(ii) breach of Clause 22.2.1 of the Participation Contract regarding waiver of the right to use diplomatic or consular channels;\n\n(iii) the Claimants' destructive and unlawful conduct following the *Caducidad* Decree, including lost Block 15 production due to the release of drilling rigs and damage to data and software; and\n\n(iv) the Claimants' failure to pay the required assignment fee and negotiate a new participation contract more favourable to the Respondent.\n\n855.\n\nEach of these four allegations is addressed in turn next.\n\n***1. The Respondent's Allegation that the Claimants Initiated and Prosecuted this Case in Bad Faith***\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n856.\n\nThis allegation on the part of the Respondent is expressly based on the contention that the Claimants have launched the present proceeding knowing that their claims in relation to the *Caducidad* Decree are objectively baseless and cannot succeed. However, as set forth earlier in this Award, the Tribunal has already concluded that notwithstanding OEPC's breach of Clause 16.1 of the Participation Contract and its actionable violation of Article 74.11 of the HCL, the *Caducidad* Decree was not a proportionate response in the particular circumstances and that it was accordingly issued in breach of Ecuadorian law, in breach of customary international law, and in violation of Article II.3(a) of the Treaty. The Tribunal has also concluded that the Respondent had breached Article III.1 of the Treaty.\n\n857.\n\nIn the circumstances, it follows that this proceeding as brought by the Claimants cannot be deemed to have been baseless or otherwise malicious or abusive. The Respondent's allegation and counterclaim in this regard accordingly fails.\n\n***2. The Respondent's Allegation that OEPC Breached Clause 22.2.1 of the*** ***Participation Contract Through its Use of Diplomatic Channels***\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n858.\n\nThe Tribunal recalls that Clause 22.2.1 of the Participation Contract provides as follows:\n\nIn the event of controversies that may arise as a result of the performance of this Participation Contract, in accordance with Ecuadorian law, Contractor expressly waives its right to use diplomatic or consular channels, or to have recourse to any national or foreign jurisdictional body not provided for in this Participation Contract. Lack of compliance with this provision shall constitute grounds for the *caducidad* of this Participation Contract.\n\n859.\n\nThe Claimants have argued that the Respondent's counterclaim in this regard fails because Clause 22.2.1 cannot be invoked to prevent OEPC from seeking government assistance to remedy violations by the Respondent of international law and that, in any event, the Respondent has failed to produce evidence of any requests by the Claimants for assistance from the U.S. Government in connection with the threatened *caducidad* dispute. The Claimants also aver that since the Respondent participated in discussions of the VAT dispute with the U.S. Government prior to the commencement of the VAT arbitration in 2002, the Respondent cannot now in good faith claim that these very discussions are in breach of Clause 22.2.1.\n\n860.\n\nThe Tribunal has found no evidence in the voluminous record of this case that the Claimants ever sought assistance from the U.S. Government in connection with the *caducidad* dispute through diplomatic channels in breach of Clause 22.2.1. The Respondent's counterclaim in this regard accordingly fails.\n\n***3. The Respondent's Allegation of Destructive and Unlawful Conduct on the*** ***part of the Claimants***\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n861.\n\nIn the third head of its counterclaim, the Respondent seeks damages for losses it allegedly suffered as a result of the Claimants' \"destructive actions\" regarding Block 15. These \"destructive actions\" consist of the release by the Claimants shortly before the date of the *Caducidad* Decree of two drilling rigs required to maintain production levels at Block 15, the deactivation of 108 software programs used to operate Block 15 and the Unified Fields, as well as the deletion of \"approximately 3,705 gigabytes of data from the Block's computer system.\" These actions, the Respondent contends, resulted in damages of over $80 million.\n\n862.\n\nThe Claimants reject the Respondent's allegations of \"destructive actions.\" With respect to the release of the drilling rigs, the Claimants maintain that nothing in the Participation Contract or the HCL required OEPC to maintain at the site such equipment that was no longer in use. And in connection with the deactivation of Block 15's operational software, the Claimants submit that OEPC took all steps necessary to ensure the smooth transition of Block 15 from OEPC to PetroEcuador, and that any ensuing difficulties were the result of PetroEcuador's own failure to plan adequately for the transition.\n\n863.\n\nThis counterclaim will now be considered and analyzed in more detail.\n\n***(a) Lost Block 15 Production Due to Release of Drilling Rigs***\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n864.\n\nAs found earlier in this Award, the Tribunal is not satisfied that the release of the drilling rigs by OEPC prior to 15 May 2006 was dictated by anything other than economic considerations. It was certainly not caused by the *Caducidad* Decree or, indeed, any wrongful action on the part of the Respondent.\n\n865.\n\nOn the basis of the evidence which it has analyzed, the Tribunal concludes that the Respondent has not discharged its burden of proving that, by releasing the two rigs on 3 January 2006 and 15 April 2006, the Claimants caused damages to the Respondent. This counterclaim accordingly fails.\n\n866.\n\nAs was seen earlier in the Tribunal's determination of quantum, the absence of these two rigs has been taken into consideration in the calculation of the fair market value of Block 15.\n\n***(b) Damages to Data and Software***\n--------------------------------------\n\n867.\n\nThe Claimants maintain, essentially, that the software licenses for the Block 15 operations are intellectual property owned by them and that they were perfectly justified to cancel these licenses. Such licenses, say the Claimants, cannot be equated with \"equipment, tools, machinery or installations\" referred to at Clause 5.1.21 of the Participation Contract.\n\n868.\n\nAlthough the Tribunal is of the view that, in today's modern world of electronic technology, software licenses are \"tools\" which needed to be transferred to the Respondent under clause 5.1.22 of the Participation Contract following the *Caducidad* Decree, there is no evidence in the record that the Claimants destroyed any software data in retaliation for the declaration by the Respondent of *Caducidad*. Accordingly, the Respondent's counterclaim in this regard fails.\n\n***4. The Respondent's Allegation that the Claimants Failed to Pay the*** ***Assignment Fee and to Negotiate a New Participation Contract More Favourable to the Respondent***\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n869.\n\nThe fourth and final head of the Respondent's counterclaim, based on the allegation that the Claimants failed to pay the assignment fee and negotiate a new participation contract more favourable to the Respondent in accordance with Article 79 of the HCL, is no longer pursued by the Respondent. This appears logical. The Tribunal so notes and thus need not make any ruling.\n\n***VII. COSTS***\n----------------\n\n870.\n\nThe Claimants submit that, as the ultimate successful party, they should recover from the Respondent all of their legal costs as well as the fees and expenses of the Tribunal and the administrative charges of ICSID.\n\n871.\n\nThe Tribunal, for the following reasons, has formed the view that it would not be appropriate in the circumstances of this lengthy and complex arbitration to grant the Claimants' prayer.\n\n872.\n\nThe Tribunal recalls, in particular, that it dismissed the Claimants' Application for Provisional Relief.\n\n873.\n\nThe Tribunal also recalls that, while the Respondent's challenge to the jurisdiction of the Tribunal was dismissed earlier and, in the present Award, the Claimants have been awarded significant damages, the Tribunal has found that the Claimants breached Clause 16.1 of the Participation Contract and were guilty of an actionable violation of Article 74.11 of the HCL, which violation contributed to the prejudice which they suffered when the *Caducidad* Decree was issued.\n\n874.\n\nThus, in the exercise of its discretion, the Tribunal decides that each party shall bear its own legal costs and that the fees and expenses of the Tribunal and the administrative charges of ICSID shall be borne equally as between the Claimants and the Respondent.\n\n875.\n\nIn closing, the Tribunal acknowledges the quality of the extensive written and oral submissions of both parties in respect of the myriad of factual and legal questions which were raised in the course of these lengthy and very complex arbitral proceedings.\n\n***VIII. AWARD***\n-----------------\n\n876.\n\nFor all of the foregoing reasons, and rejecting all submissions and contentions to the contrary, the Tribunal DECLARES, AWARDS and ORDERS as follows in respect of the issues arising for determination in these proceedings:\n\n(i) Ecuador acted in breach of Article II.3(a) of the Treaty by failing to accord fair and equitable treatment to the Claimants' investment, and to accord the Claimants treatment no less than that required by international law;\n\n(ii) Ecuador acted in breach of Article III.1 of the Treaty by expropriating the Claimants' investment in Block 15 through a measure \"tantamount to expropriation\";\n\n(iii) Ecuador issued the *Caducidad* Decree in breach of Ecuadorian law and customary international law;\n\n(iv) OEPC breached Clause 16.1 of the Participation Contract by failing to secure the required ministerial authorization for the transfer of rights under the Farmout Agreement; as a result of this breach, the damages awarded to the Claimants will be reduced by a factor of 25% (see subparagraph (v));\n\n(v) Claimants are awarded the amount of US$ 1,769,625.000 (US One billion, seven hundred sixty nine millions, six hundred twenty five thousand dollars), as calculated in paragraph 825 of this Award, for damages suffered as a result of the breaches set out above in subparagraphs (i), (ii) and (iii);\n\n(vi) Ecuador is ordered to pay pre-award interest on the above amount at the rate of 4,188% per annum, compounded annually from 16 May 2006 until the date of this Award;\n\n(vii) Ecuador is ordered to pay post-award interest from the date of this Award at the U.S. 6 month LIBOR rate, compounded on a monthly basis; and\n\n(viii) Ecuador's counterclaims, except that counterclaim specified in subparagraph (iv) above, are dismissed; and\n\n(ix) Each Party is ordered to bear its own costs of the proceedings and the Claimants and the Respondent are ordered and mandated each to pay half of ICSID's and the Tribunal's costs of and incidental to the proceedings.\n\n877.\n\nIn accordance with Article 48(4) of the ICSID Convention, Arbitrator Stern dissents from the above majority and her statement of dissent is attached."}, {"Title": "Decision on the Stay of Enforcement of the Award", "Type": "Stay of Enforcement", "Date": "2013-09-30T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Decision on the Stay of Enforcement of the Award\n------------------------------------------------\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **TABLE OF ABBREVIATED TERMS** | |\n| Arbitration Rules | ICSID Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings |\n| BIT or US - Ecuador BIT | Ecuador Bilateral Investment Treaty signed on August 27, 1993;

PROCEDURE**\n----------------\n\n1.\n\nOn October 9, 2012, the Republic of Ecuador filed with the Secretary-General of ICSID an application for the annulment of the Award rendered on October 5, 2012 in the present case. Ecuador's application included a request under Article 52(5) of the ICSID Convention for a stay of enforcement of the Award, pending a decision by the Committee to be constituted on the application for annulment.\n\n2.\n\nThe Secretary-General of ICSID registered the application on October 11, 2012 at the same time notifying the parties, pursuant to Rule 54(2) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules, that enforcement of the Award was provisionally stayed.\n\n3.\n\nOn January 18, 2013, the *ad hoc* Committee was constituted in accordance with Article 52(3) of the ICSID Convention. Its members are: Prof. Juan Fernandez-Armesto (Spanish), President, designated to the ICSID Panel of Arbitrators by the Kingdom of Spain; Judge Florentino P. Feliciano (Philippine), designated to the ICSID Panel of Arbitrators by the Republic of the Philippines, and Mr. Rodrigo Oreamuno B. (Costa Rican), designated to the ICSID Panel of Arbitrators by the Republic of Costa Rica; all members appointed by the Chairman of ICSID's Administrative Council.\n\n4.\n\nOn February 13, 2013, the Claimants filed a request that the provisional stay of enforcement of the Award be lifted.\n\n5.\n\nOn March 25, 2013, the Committee held its first session with the parties by telephone conference. During the teleconference, the Claimants were represented by Mr. David W. Rivkin and Ms. Marjorie J. Menza, from Debevoise & Plimpton LLP; Mr. Ga\u00ebtan Verhoosel and Ms. Carmen Martinez, from Covington & Burling LLP and Ms. Laura C. Abrahamson, Associate General Counsel, Occidental Petroleum Corporation. The Republic of Ecuador, in turn, was represented by Ms. Christel Gaibor and Ms. Diana Moya Davalos, from Ecuador's *Procuraduria General del Estado,* Messrs. George von Mehren and Stephen P. Anway, from Squire Sanders (US) LLP and Professors Eduardo Silva Romero and Pierre Mayer, from Dechert LLP. All three members of the Committee, Prof. Juan Fernandez-Armesto, Judge Florentino P. Feliciano and Mr. Rodrigo Oreamuno B., and the Secretary of the Committee, Mr. Gonzalo Flores, ICSID, participated during the teleconference.\n\n6.\n\nDuring the session, the parties confirmed that the Committee had been properly constituted in accordance with the ICSID Convention and the ICSID Arbitration Rules and that they had no objection to the appointment of any of its members. During the session, the Committee and the parties considered the Agenda adopted by the Committee and a joint communication from the parties of March 18, 2013, reflecting their agreements and disagreements on the different Agenda items. Audio recordings of the session were made and deposited in the archives of ICSID and circulated to the parties and the Committee members. Verbatim transcripts were also made, with the agreement of the parties, from the audio recordings, which were also circulated to the parties and members of the Committee.\n\n7.\n\nOn April 10, 2013, the Committee issued Procedural Order No. 1.\n\n8.\n\nPursuant to the schedule agreed upon by the parties, on April 5, 2013 the Republic of Ecuador filed observations to Claimants' request to terminate the stay of enforcement of the Award; on April 22, 2013 Claimants filed a reply to the Republic of Ecuador's observations of April 5; and on May 6, 2013 Ecuador filed a rejoinder to Claimants' reply.\n\n9.\n\nAs directed in Procedural Order No. 1, a one-day hearing on the matter of the stay of enforcement of the Award was held on 13 May 2013 at the ICC Hearing Center in Paris, France. The three members of the Committee, Prof. Juan Fernandez-Armesto, Judge Florentino P. Feliciano and Mr. Rodrigo Oreamuno B., attended the hearing. Mr. Gonzalo Flores, Secretary of the Committee, was also present at the hearing.\n\n10.\n\nDuring the hearing, Claimants were represented by Messrs. Donald P. de Brier and Gerald Ellis and Ms. Laura C. Abrahamson, from Occidental Petroleum Corporation; Messrs. David W. Rivkin, Benjamin M. Aronson and Geoffroy Goubin and Ms. Marjorie J. Menza, from Debevoise & Plimpton LLP; and by Mr. Ga\u00ebtan Verhoosel and Ms. Carmen Martinez Lopez from Covington & Burling LLP. The Republic of Ecuador was represented by Dr. Diego Garcia Carrion, Procurador General del Estado; Ms. Christel Gaibor and Ms. Diana Moya, from Procuraduria General del Estado; Messrs. George von Mehren, and Stephen Anway, from Squire Sanders (US) LLP; Professors Eduardo Silva Romero and Pierre Mayer, Messrs. Jos\u00e9 Manuel Garcia Represa and Alvaro Galindo, and Ms. Audrey Caminades, Ms. Celia Campbell, Ms. Monica Garay and Ms. Kattia Hernandez Morales, from Dechert LLP.\n\n11.\n\nDuring the hearing, Mr. Rivkin addressed the Committee on behalf of the Claimants. Dr. Garcia Carrion, Messrs. von Mehren and Anway and Professors Silva-Romero and Mayer addressed the Committee on behalf of the Republic of Ecuador. Both parties made extensive opening and closing submissions on the issue of the stay of the Award.\n\n12.\n\nPursuant to the instructions of the President of the Committee, both parties submitted simultaneously, on May 24, 2013, comments on Claimants' Exhibit on Annulment 69A.\n\n**II. CLAIMANTS' ARGUMENTS**\n----------------------------\n\n13.\n\nClaimants request that the automatic provisional stay granted to Ecuador pursuant to Article 52(5) of the ICSID Convention be lifted, or in the alternative, that the Committee impose conditions on any continued stay of enforcement of Claimants' Award against the Respondent.1\n\nClaimants' Request, para. 2.\n\n14.\n\nAccording to Claimants, Ecuador's illegal seizure of Block 15 was its largest expropriation ever and reflects the largest expropriation found in ICSID history. The size of the Award simply reflects the value of Block 15, which the Tribunal unanimously held was illegally seized. At the time of the expropriation in 2006, 13 years remained on the contract. Claimants had invested US$ 1 billion in Block 15 to recover the available reserves. The prices used in the expert reports were based on 2006 prices, around US$ 50/barrel. Oil prices have nearly doubled since then, more than doubling the profits. Ecuador simply cannot be permitted to complain that, because it illegally expropriated such a large and profitable investment, it deserves special protection from its consequences.2 Claimant avers that Ecuador has earned enormous cash flows from its illegal seizure of Block 15 -over US$ 2.05 billion in profits from Block 15 in 2012 alone.3\n\nClaimants' Reply, para. 85 - 86.\n\nClaimants' Reply, para. 95.\n\n15.\n\nClaimants acknowledge that *ad hoc* committees asked to continue a stay have typically done so, but frequently condition continuing the stay on the posting of security. However, Claimants stress that the texts of the Convention and the Arbitration Rules provide no basis for a presumption in favor of continuing the provisional stay of enforcement. To the contrary, under both the Convention and the Rules, the stay is only automatic for 30 days at the start of the annulment proceeding.4*Ad hoc* committees have routinely rejected arguments that parties are automatically entitled to a continued stay.5\n\nClaimants' Reply, para. 14 - 15.\n\nQuoting *Libananco Holdings Co.

Modifying a stay necessarily includes the power to condition a stay.7\n\nClaimants' Reply, para. 24.\n\nClaimants' Reply, para. 25.\n\n17.\n\nClaimants aver that no *ad hoc* committee has ever denied that Article 52(5) of the Convention grants committees the power to impose conditions of the continuance of a provisional stay. Only one committee, *MINE*, declined to rule on whether *ad hoc* committees have the power to impose conditions. All other published decisions recognize that committees have the power to impose conditions on the continuance of stay.8 Committees, after determining whether to continue a stay, have repeatedly imposed conditions on that continuance, including bank guarantees,9 bonds,10 escrow deposits11 and written undertakings.12 Of the 21 *ad hoc* committee decisions determining whether to continue the stay, 13 imposed conditions on the stays of enforcement.13 Security was denied in eight cases,14 but these denials were based on reasons and circumstances that do not exist in this case.\n\n*Patrick Mitchell v.

The overwhelming weight of Ecuador's public statements suggests that it will not comply with the Award if annulment were denied, and the Response provides no additional assurance that Ecuador will comply. Ecuador also has a substantial record of non-compliance with past decisions and awards by arbitral tribunals.15 Furthermore, since 2005, Ecuador has progressively outlawed all international investment arbitration by both Constitutional amendment and amendment to the Law on Arbitration and Mediation concerning its natural resources, making immediate execution of this Award doubtful if not impossible.16\n\nClaimants' Reply, para. 44\n\nClaimants' Reply, para. 73.\n\n19.\n\nClaimants do not disagree that the closing of international markets to Ecuador, based on its credit risk, may make obtaining a bank guarantee impractical. While Claimants continue to request a security for the full amount of the Award, in the alternative the security could take different forms. Since Block 15 produces enormous profits for Ecuador, a part of that profit could be used to secure the Award:\n\n- In a first alternative, Ecuador should deposit 50% of the Award amount plus interest (US$ 1.15 billion) in an escrow account held at a mutually agreed upon international bank, with the remaining 50% to be deposited over time in monthly installments spread over 10 months, or approximately US$ 115 million per month;\n\n- Under a second alternative, Ecuador should make four deposits on a quarterly basis into an escrow account, each deposit amounting to US$ 507.5 million.17\n\nClaimants' Reply, paras. 97 - 98.\n\nInterest Insufficient\n---------------------\n\n20.\n\nIf the Committee continues the stay without conditions it will severely interfere with Claimants' right to an immediately payable Award. Even though post-award interest is available here, it does not fully compensate Claimants for the delay in payment. Occidental Petroleum Corporation has achieved a return of 12.6% on capital it employed during 2012, a rate that far exceeds the pre- and post-award interest granted to Claimants in the Award.18\n\nClaimants' Request, paras. 88 - 89.\n\n21.\n\nSumming up, Claimants request that if the Committee grants Ecuador's application to continue the stay of enforcement, it be conditioned upon the provision of a proper security:\n\n- The posting of the full amount of the Award plus the post-award interest to date into a mutually agreed-upon escrow account, pledged in favor of Claimants and under the direction of the *ad hoc* Committee;\n\n- Or either of the two alternatives outlined in the previous paragraphs.19\n\nClaimants' Reply, para. 104.\n\nThe CAITISA Decree\n------------------\n\n22.\n\nClaimants explain that on May 6, 2013, the Government of the Republic of Ecuador issued the CAITISA Decree, which created a *\"Comision para la Auditorial Integral Ciudadana de los Tratados de Proteccion Reciproca de Inversiones y del Sistema de Arbitraje Internacional en Materia de Inversiones*\".\n\n23.\n\nClaimants argue that by subjecting the Award to scrutiny by this Government-sponsored Commission and a public pronouncement by that Commission as to its validity and legality, the CAITISA Decree confirms the inevitability of an Ecuadorian court reviewing and rejecting the Award. The creation of the CAITISA Commission underscores the risk that Ecuador will not comply with the Award if its annulment application fails. The establishment of an official Commission to review the validity and legality of an ICSID Award cannot be reconciled with Ecuador's obligations under Articles 53 and 54 of the ICSID Convention.20\n\nClaimant's letter dated May 24, 2013, p. 1 - 2.\n\n**III. RESPONDENT'S ARGUMENTS**\n-------------------------------\n\n24.\n\nRespondent avers that committees have repeatedly recognized that a party's right to seek an annulment of an award is of critical, systemic importance to the ICSID system. For that reason, ICSID committees have continued the stay of enforcement in all 22 cases in which it has been requested to date21. This - Ecuador adds - is hardly the case to break that line of precedent. Claimants are anticipatorily seeking to collect billions of dollars from a sovereign nation on the basis of a decision rendered by a sharply-divided Tribunal, but the majority's decision is profoundly flawed - as forcefully explained by Professor Brigitte Stern in her dissent.22\n\nThere is a very recent decision which decided differently, which the parties had the opportunity to briefly comment on. *See* footnote no. 50 *infra*.\n\nRespondent's Response, paras. 2 - 3.\n\n25.\n\nRespondent submits that its annulment application is made in good faith, and not dilatory in nature,23 and that it would suffer immediate, irreparable and/or catastrophic consequences should the stay be lifted; it explains that the amount of the Award represents almost 9% of Ecuador's 2012 annual budget, 59% of the country's 2012 annual budget for education and 135% of the country's annual healthcare budget.24\n\nRespondent's Response, para. 36.\n\nRespondent's Response, para. 43.\n\nNo Power to Request Security\n----------------------------\n\n26.\n\nAs regards the Claimants' request for Ecuador to provide security, such request, in Respondent's opinion, is doomed, because the Committee does not have the power to grant it. *Ad hoc* committees do not have any explicit, or even implied, power to condition the continuation of a stay for the following six reasons:25\n\n- The Convention does not expressly grant *ad hoc* committees the power to order security when deciding whether or not to stay an award; Arbitration Rule 54(3) does not necessarily include the power to condition a stay;26\n\n- The power cannot be implied, by the discretion given to *ad hoc* committees to stay the enforcement \"if it considers that the circumstances so require\"; the discretion is limited to the decision whether or not to grant the stay - and does not extend to the imposing of conditions;\n\n- The request for the posting of security is indisputably a request for provisional measures, and under the Convention a provisional measure may solely be recommended, as can be clearly derived from Rule 39 of the Arbitration Rules;\n\n- Furthermore, *ad hoc* committees' power to recommend provisional measures was expressly considered and rejected during the negotiation of the Convention;\n\n- Article VI of the New York Convention expressly empowers the judicial authority to request adequate security; given that the New York Convention was already in effect at the time when the ICSID Convention was drafted, it can only be assumed that such a provision for security would have been considered and in turn discarded by the drafters of the Convention;\n\n- Previous decisions of committees granting the stay, but conditioning it on the provision of security are not binding, are not convincing and were issued in cases where the debtor did not dispute the power of a committee to do so.27\n\nRespondent's Response, paras. 57 - 76.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, para. 30.\n\nIn *Amco II*, *Wena*, *CDC*, and *Kardassopoulos*, the power of the Committee was merely assumed; *Amco I*, *Repsol II* and *Lemire* were not published; Respondent's Rejoinder, para. 47.\n\n27.\n\nIn light of the above, Ecuador submits that the Committee has no choice but to examine anew the issue whether it has the power to order the posting of security as a condition for the continued stay of enforcement.\n\n28.\n\nIn the alternative, even if the Committee were to find that it has the power to grant Claimants' request for security - which Ecuador denies - the creditor must establish all requirements for interim measures to be granted: urgency and *fumus boni iuris*. And Claimants have failed to prove these requirements.28\n\nRespondent's Response, paras. 78 - 81.\n\nMerits\n------\n\n29.\n\nIn any event, Ecuador argues that Claimants' request for posting of security is wholly lacking in merit. Claimants will not be severely prejudiced by the continued stay, because as per the Award they will be collecting post-award interest at the US LIBOR rate compounded on a monthly basis.29 And a mere risk of non-compliance cannot justify a request for security, because granting the creditor's request for security would go beyond counterbalancing the alleged effect of a stay: it would improperly put the creditor in a better situation than it was prior to the annulment application, and penalize the debtor.30\n\nRespondent's Response, para. 97.\n\nRespondent's Response, para. 105, Rejoinder, para. 77, by reference to *MINE*.\n\n30.\n\nRespondent submits that the posting of security would only be appropriate where the creditor's chances of enforcement deteriorate with time. Claimants, however, have not even attempted to establish that their chances of enforcement are better now than they would be at the end of the annulment proceeding.31\n\nRespondent's Response, para. 109.\n\n31.\n\nRespondent dismisses Claimants' allegations that it will not pay the Award as no more than speculation about Ecuador's possible intentions:\n\n- Claimants' reliance on alleged public announcements by Ecuador does not establish that Ecuador will not comply with the Award;\n\n- Claimants' reliance on Ecuador's alleged failure to comply with the VAT Award does not establish that Ecuador will not comply with this Award; in this context, Respondent complains that Claimants have produced correspondence between Claimants' in-house counsel and the Procuraduria which was clearly stamped \"confidential and privileged;\"32\n\n- Claimants' reliance on Ecuador's alleged failure to comply with other decisions of other tribunals does not establish that Ecuador will not comply with this Award; not a single concluded investment case against Ecuador has resulted in enforcement proceedings; Ecuador has been found liable in two cases and complied with the resulting payment obligations;33\n\n- Claimants' reliance on Ecuadorian law does not establish that Ecuador will not comply with the Award; the real state of affairs in this matter is that Ecuadorian law does not subject ICSID awards to judicial review; Claimant's allegation based on Ecuador's denunciation of the Convention and BITs or amendment to its statutes or Constitution is therefore irrelevant;34 the *accion extraordinaria de proteccion* provided for in Article 94 of the Ecuadorian Constitution is not applicable to ICSID awards;35 Ecuador does not maintain that its obligation to abide by and comply with an award under Article 53 is conditional upon recourse by the award creditor to a domestic enforcement procedure;36\n\n- Claimants' reliance on alleged steps to make enforcement outside Ecuador more difficult for Occidental does not establish that Ecuador will not comply with the Award.\n\nRespondent's Response, para. 130; Rejoinder, para. 100. Respondent's request that the documents be stricken from the record was withdrawn: Transc. p. 254, l. 2 - 7.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, footnote 150.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, para. 108.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, para. 112.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, para. 114.\n\n32.\n\nFinally, Ecuador argues that the posting of a security is not an option which is open to it, because it will cause catastrophic, immediate and irreparable harm, requiring the freezing of US$ 2.3 billion, even if the security takes the form of a bank guarantee. No international bank would provide Ecuador with a guarantee without Ecuador actually escrowing most if not all of the moneys. As a consequence, the result will be the same as if the stay had been lifted.37\n\nRespondent's Response, paras. 190 - 198.\n\n33.\n\nAs regards Claimants' request that the revenues derived from Block 15 be earmarked for payment of the Award, Respondent avers that this is not the way Ecuador - or any other government - treat revenues earned by the State. Ecuador pools its revenues from various sources to satisfy the nation's urgent needs.38\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, para. 22.\n\nSummary\n-------\n\n34.\n\nThe Committee faces two alternatives: either grant the stay without security, which would cause Claimants no prejudice in the unlikely event that the Award were sustained; or grant the stay conditioned on the posting of security which would cause Ecuador irreparable harm that no repayment or returning of funds could ever repair. In Respondent's view, the balancing of the parties' interest weighs in favor of Ecuador.39\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, para. 58.\n\n35.\n\nSumming up, Ecuador requests that the stay be continued and that Claimants' request for the posting of security be dismissed.40\n\nRespondent's Response, para. 202.\n\nThe CAITISA Decree\n------------------\n\n36.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the CAITISA Decree is irrelevant to the Committee's decision. CAITISA is simply a study group to be formed for the purposes set forth in the CAITISA Decree, which does not affect the enforcement of awards rendered against Ecuador.41\n\nRespondent's letter dated May 24, 2013, p. 2 - 3.\n\n**IV. THE COMMITTEE'S ANALYSIS**\n--------------------------------\n\n37.\n\nOn October 5, 2012 the Arbitral Tribunal issued its Award in the present case, with a Dissenting Opinion by one of its members. In essence, the decision awarded Claimants:\n\n- the amount of US$ 1,769,625,000 for damages suffered;\n\n- pre-award interest at the rate of 4,188% since May 16, 2006;\n\n- post-award interest from the date of the Award at the U.S. 6 month LIBOR rate, compounded on a monthly basis.\n\n38.\n\nOn October 9, 2012 the Republic of Ecuador submitted an application for the annulment of the Award, which included a request for a stay of enforcement, pending a decision by this Committee. In accordance with Article 52(5) of the Convention:\n\n\"if the applicant requests a stay of enforcement of the award in his application, enforcement shall be stayed provisionally until the Committee rules on such request\".\n\nConsequently, the enforcement of the Award was provisionally stayed by the Secretary-General of ICSID.\n\n39.\n\nOn February 13, 2013 the Claimants filed a request for the lifting of the provisional stay. Initially Claimants requested that the provisional stay should be lifted or alternatively that any continued stay be conditioned on Ecuador providing proper security.42 During the procedure, Claimants' emphasis shifted to the alternative prayer: in the Reply43 and during the hearing,44 Claimants only requested that Ecuador provide adequate security; if the Committee grants Ecuador's application to continue the stay, it should be conditioned upon the posting of a sufficient security.\n\nClaimants' Request, para. 104.\n\nClaimants' Reply, para. 104.\n\nCounsel for Claimants: Transc. p. 100, 19 - 21.\n\n40.\n\nRespondent replied requesting that the stay be continued, and that Claimants' request for the posting of security be dismissed.\n\n41.\n\nBoth parties asked for the costs to be borne by the counterparty.\n\n42.\n\nTo decide the issues raised by Claimants and Respondent, the Committee will first address the question of whether the provisional stay of enforcement should be lifted. It will come to the conclusion that the stay should continue (A). Thereafter, it will briefly analyze whether Annulment Committees have the power to condition the stay of enforcement (B) and then decide whether in the specific circumstances of the case, Ecuador should be required to provide security (C).\n\n**A. Continuation of the Provisional Stay of Enforcement**\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n43.\n\nArticle 52(5) of the Convention provides:\n\n\"(5) The Committee may, if it considers that the circumstances so require, stay enforcement of the award pending its decision. If the applicant requests a stay of enforcement of the award in his application, enforcement shall be stayed provisionally until the Committee rules on such request\".\n\n44.\n\nAccording to this provision, the Committee has the power to either lift the provisional stay of enforcement of the Award or order the continuation of the stay, pending the Committee's decision on annulment, \"if it considers that the circumstances so require\". The Committee's decision is not final: it \"may at any time modify or terminate the stay at the request of either party\" (Rule 54(3) of the Arbitration Rules).\n\n45.\n\nThe Respondent submits that in the past no committee has ever decided to lift the provisional stay pending annulment proceedings, even when award creditors requested termination of the stay45. Respondent avers that this Committee should not deviate from these precedents, because Ecuador has a *prima facie* good faith case for annulment and would suffer immediate, irreparable and catastrophic consequences if the stay of enforcement were lifted.46\n\nThere is now one precedent where the stay was lifted, which both parties had the chance to comment on: *See* footnote No. 50 *infra*.\n\nRespondent's Response, para. 32.\n\n46.\n\nClaimants acknowledge that committees have typically decided to continue the stay, but add that the legal texts provide no basis for a presumption in favor of continuing the provisional stay of enforcement.47 Notwithstanding this lack of presumption, Claimants are not actively requesting a lifting of the stay - their final prayer for relief is that the lifting should be conditioned upon Ecuador posting proper security.\n\nClaimants' Reply, para. 13.\n\n47.\n\nThe Committee agrees with Claimants that an award debtor is not entitled to a continued stay of enforcement, that there is no basis for a presumption in favor of continuation of the stay, and that both under the Convention and the Rules, the stay is only automatic for a 30-day period at the start of the annulment proceedings (Article 52(5) of the Convention and Rule 54(2) of the Arbitration Rules). The word \"may\" in Article 52 also clearly indicates that the Convention leaves it to the Committee's broad discretion to decide whether to continue the stay.48\n\n*See Enron I*, para. 22.\n\n48.\n\nConsidering the circumstances of the case, and applying the above-described principles, the Committee finds that the appropriate decision is that the stay should continue.\n\n49.\n\nThe ICSID Secretariat has noted that as of June 30, 2012 there had\n\n\"been a total of 24 requests for the stay of enforcement in the 53 registered annulments, 22 of which have led to Committee decisions. All 22 decisions granted the stay of enforcement.\"49\n\nICSID Secretariat: \"Background Paper on Annulment for the Administrative Council of ICSID,\" dated August 10, 2012, Doc. CAA 32.\n\n50.\n\nThe prevailing practice in prior annulment cases has been to grant the stay of enforcement50. Although this practice does not create a presumption for continuation, and a committee is entitled to deviate from it, \"if it considers that the circumstances so require\", the Committee finds that in this case there is no reason to deviate from the standard practice.\n\nClaimants have brought to the Committee's attention a very recent decision of March 22, 2013, rejecting Paraguay's Request for the Continued Stay of Enforcement of the Award issued in the case of *SGS Societ\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale de Surveillance S.A. v. Republic of Paraguay*, ICSID Case No. ARB/07/29; *See* Claimants' letter to the Committee of June 27, 2013. The Respondent commented on this decision by letter of July 1, 2013 and explained that it was issued under very specific circumstances. The existence of one exception does not vary the conclusion that the current standard is for committees to grant continuance of stays of enforcement.\n\n**B. Power of Annulment Committees to Condition the Stay of Enforcement**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n51.\n\nRespondent submits that committees do not have the power to condition the continuation of the stay to the providing of security by the debtor. In essence, Ecuador argues that the Convention does not expressly grant such power to committees, and that this power cannot be implied.51\n\nRespondent's Response, para. 54.\n\n52.\n\nClaimants disagree. Committees have broad discretion in determining whether to permit continuation of the stay. It necessarily follows that committees have the power to impose conditions on such continuation, such as security.52\n\nClaimants' Reply, para. 24.\n\n53.\n\nThe Committee does not have to address, at this time in the procedure, the difficult issue of whether or not committees have the power to condition the continuation of the stay on the posting of security by the Respondent. The Committee will analyze in the following section Claimants' request that the stay of enforcement be made conditional upon the posting of security and will come to the conclusion that *hic et nunc* the factual situation does not justify that such condition be imposed53. Since the Committee will come to the conclusion that in the present circumstances no condition is required, the question of whether or not the Committee has the power to impose such condition has become moot.\n\n*See* paras. 96 *et seq*. *infra*.\n\n54.\n\nThe Committee will address the issue of its powers to condition stay of enforcement on the posting of a security by the award debtor, if and when this issue becomes material, upon a fresh request by the Claimants, arguing that new circumstances merit a revision of the Committee's present decision.\n\n**C. Posting of a Security by the Republic of Ecuador**\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n55.\n\nClaimants have advanced two essential reasons, to convince the Committee that it should only lift the stay upon the posting of a security by the Republic: the first is that Occidental has a present right to the Award and to use the funds from the Award (a) and the second is that there is very substantial risk that Ecuador will not comply with the Award (b).\n\n**a. First argument: \"Cash is king\"**\n-------------------------------------\n\n56.\n\nClaimants argue that they have a present right to cash the amounts established in the Award and to use these funds for their own benefit. As Claimants' former Executive Vice President stated in his Witness Statement \"cash is king\"54: Occidental is achieving a return of 12.6% on capital employed during 2012, a rate which exceeds the post-award interest granted, which is capped at U.S. 6 month LIBOR rate.55 Postponement in payment is causing Claimants' additional harm.\n\nDoc. CEA 15.\n\nClaimants' Request, paras. 85 - 89.\n\n57.\n\nRespondent disagrees.\n\n58.\n\nThe Committee has full understanding that Claimants would prefer to have the amount awarded in cash, investing the funds in their own business and obtaining a high rate of return. The problem with this argument is that it is unconnected to the issue of whether the stay should be conditioned on the posting of security. If the Committee were to order that the Republic constitute an escrow account for the full amount of the Award - as requested by Claimants - the moneys would be deposited with an international bank, and accrue normal deposit interest rates, which typically are lower than six month LIBOR. Occidental would not be authorized to touch the funds until the annulment had been decided, and consequently the problem of unavailability of funds, and the low post-award interest rate would not be solved.\n\n59.\n\nPosting of a security does not solve, and does not even mitigate, the \"cash is king\" problem. Only immediate enforcement would solve this problem.\n\n**b. Second argument: The Risk of non-Compliance with the Award**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Parties' Arguments\n----------------------\n\n60.\n\nClaimants' main argument is the allegation that there is a serious risk that the Respondent will not comply with its obligation to pay the Award and that a stay subject to the condition of proper security becomes necessary to guarantee enforcement.\n\n61.\n\nRespondent disagrees: the mere risk of non-compliance could not justify the granting of a request for security56 and, furthermore, Claimants speculate on Ecuador's non-compliance on the basis of grossly incorrect or irrelevant facts.57 Furthermore, the posting of a security would require the Republic to freeze US$ 2.3 billion, an amount which represents almost 9% of Ecuador's 2012 budget. The deduction of this amount from other budgetary items will cause the Republic catastrophic, immediate and irreparable harm, and in practical terms the end result would be the same as if the stay had been lifted.58\n\nRespondent's Response, para. 102.\n\nRespondent's Response, para. 110.\n\nRespondent's Response, paras. 190-198.\n\nCompliance of Awards under the Convention\n-----------------------------------------\n\n62.\n\nThe possibility that parties dishonor awards issued under the Convention was a risk foreseen by its drafters. They were adamant that the Convention should not become a paper tiger and inserted into the Convention various rules, with the aim of safeguarding that awards are duly complied with.\n\n63.\n\nThe fundamental principle is contained in Article 53, which orders that each party shall abide by and comply with the terms of the award, once the stay of enforcement has been lifted.\n\n64.\n\nThis treaty obligation also binds the Republic of Ecuador.59\n\nNotwithstanding the fact that in 2009 the Republic of Ecuador denounced the ICSID Convention: in accordance with Article 72, withdrawal from ICSID does not affect the obligations arising out of consent to the jurisdiction of the Centre given before the notice of withdrawal was received by the depositary.\n\n65.\n\nIf, notwithstanding this treaty obligation, an investor who is an award creditor under the Convention is not readily paid by the State which is the award debtor, the award creditor may seek enforcement of the award in any Contracting State. Article 54(1) of the ICSID Convention creates a specific treaty obligation for each Contracting State to \"recognize\" an ICSID award as binding \"as if it were a final judgment of a court in that State\".\n\n66.\n\nThis obligation is also binding on Ecuador.\n\nPosting of Security under Article 52(5)\n---------------------------------------\n\n67.\n\nThe Committee agrees with the Respondent that the intrinsic risk of non-compliance is addressed in Articles 53 and 54 of the Convention, and that under normal circumstances the procedure set forth in the Convention for recognition, enforcement and even forcible execution should not be altered because a stay of enforcement is being sought. In normal circumstances, conditioning the stay on the posting of security would go beyond counterbalancing the effect of the stay: it would put the award creditor in a better situation than it was prior to the annulment application,60 because it would provide the creditor with a form of conditional payment in advance.61\n\n*See MINE*, para. 22 *, MTD Equity*, para. 30, *Mitchell*, para. 32, *Enron I*, para. 33.\n\n*Mitchell*, para. 31.\n\n68.\n\nThe above conclusion applies in normal circumstances: when there is full expectation that the award debtor State will comply with its treaty obligation, and duly pay the award, once the annulment request has been adjudicated. If there is however an objective risk that the State will not honor its commitments, *ad hoc* committees have consistently found that security is appropriate to provide assurance that the award debtor will comply with the award if it is ultimately upheld.62\n\n*Amco I, CDC, CMS, Vivendi II, Sempra I, Duke Energy, Transgabonais, Rumeli, Kardassopulos, Lemire.*\n\n69.\n\nRespondent has averred that forcible execution of an award rarely occurs in the territory of the sovereign award debtor, given that most public assets cannot be seized under the law of a sovereign State.63 Respondent would seem to imply that the legal regime in the award debtor State is irrelevant. This of course is not so. The risk of non-compliance must be measured in the jurisdiction of the debtor State itself, applying the law of the land. An award creditor who is the beneficiary of an ICSID award has the legitimate expectation that the State will honor its obligations \"as if [the award] were a final judgment of a court in that State\" [art. 54(1)], without the creditor having to seek forcible execution in other jurisdictions.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, at footnote 133.\n\nApplication to the Present Case\n-------------------------------\n\n70.\n\nClaimants argue that there is an increased risk that Ecuador will not comply with the Award, and that it has been proven by facts that Ecuador has:\n\n- Publicly taken the position that it will not comply with the Award;\n\n- Refused to comply with an earlier BIT award in favor of Occidental and other BIT awards against it;\n\n- Openly challenged the binding authority of arbitral tribunals on Ecuador;\n\n- Consistently resisted payment of its international financial obligations; and\n\n- Failed to comply with its international obligations under the ICSID Convention.64\n\nClaimants' Request, para. 33.\n\n71.\n\nThe Committee will analyze these averments in more detail.\n\n*Enforcement of ICSID Awards in Ecuador*\n----------------------------------------\n\n72.\n\nClaimants have drawn the Committee's attention to certain public announcements by Ecuador's President, by Attorney-General Diego Garda Carrion and by Minister of Foreign Affairs Ricardo Patino, and to a resolution passed by the National Assembly, which allegedly prove an increased risk of non-compliance of the Award.65 The Claimants aver that these statements may have \"created an atmosphere of hostility towards the ICSID system, Claimants and the enforcement of the award.\"66\n\nClaimants' Request, paras. 34 - 41.\n\nTransc. p. 58, l. 19 - 11.\n\n73.\n\nIt is true that these public statements criticize, sometime in harsh tones, the Award and certain experts who acted on Claimants' behalf. But these are political, not legal statements, and none goes as far as stating that Ecuador will not comply with its international obligations.67 What is relevant is what Ecuadorian law says.\n\nSee, *e.g.*, President Correa's phrase: \"*nosotros, patriotas con el Ecuador en el centro del alma seguiremos luchando por no pagarle un solo centavo del pueblo ecuatoriano a una transnacional abusiva que trato de estafar a nuestro pais, compatriotas,\"* Doc. CEA 59, or the resolution of the *Asamblea Nacional* : \"*Convocar a todas las funciones del Estado y al pueblo Ecuatoriano a mantenerse f\u00e9rreamente unidos y movilizados por encima de cualquier inter\u00e9s politico o corporativo, para afrontar por los medios legitimos y del derecho nacional e international se consume esta amenaza a la dignidad y soberania nacional*,\" Doc. CEA 37.\n\n*Ecuador 's Domestic Laws*\n--------------------------\n\n74.\n\nClaimants argue that Ecuador's internal laws cast serious doubts on its likelihood to comply with its international obligations.68 Claimants submit that Ecuador has never enacted enabling legislation for Article 54 of the Convention, that it amended its Constitution outlawing non-regional investment arbitration, that it revised its Arbitration and Mediation Law to prohibit all international arbitration that affect national interests, and that the Constitutional Court concluded that 12 BITs, including the Ecuador-U.S. BIT involved in this arbitration were in fact unconstitutional.\n\nClaimants' Request, paras. 64 - 80.\n\n75.\n\nAgainst this argument, in its Rejoinder dated May 6, 2013 and signed by Dr. Diego Garcia Carrion, the *Procurador General del Estado69* the Republic of Ecuador made the following statements:\n\n- \"The real state of affairs on this matter is that Ecuadorian law does not subject ICSID awards to judicial review. Claimants' allegation base (sic) on Ecuador's denunciation of the Convention and BITs or amendment to its statu[t]es and Constitution is therefore irrelevant;\"70\n\n- \"In all these proceedings [ *Enron I* and *II, Sempra* and *Vivendi* ] Argentina maintained before the *ad hoc* committees \u2018that its obligation to abide by and comply with an award under Article 53 is conditional upon recourse by the award creditor to a domestic enforcement procedure under Article 54'. Ecuador does not maintain such a position...\"71\n\nAnd co-signed by the Counsel for the Republic of Ecuador.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, para. 108; footnotes omitted.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, para. 114; footnotes omitted.\n\n76.\n\nThe statements made by its *Procurador General* are binding upon the Republic, and give Claimants full reassurance:\n\n- That Ecuadorian law does not subject ICSID awards to judicial review in Ecuador and\n\n- That Enforcement of ICSID awards in Ecuador are not subject to a domestic enforcement procedure,\n\n- In summary, that Ecuador's domestic law fully complies with the Convention.\n\n77.\n\nBased on this declaration, the Committee accepts that Ecuador's internal laws and practice respect the treaty obligations deriving from Articles 53 and 54 of the Convention and that Ecuadorian law does not subject ICSID awards to judicial review. Consequently, and contrary to Claimants' arguments, ICSID awards cannot be subject to judicial review under Article 41(c) of the LAM,72 under Article 414 of the Code of Civil Procedure or under Article 94 of Ecuador's Constitution. The legal regime in Ecuador has not changed with regard to the enforcement of ICSID awards in general, and this Award in particular.\n\nArticle 41 LAM explicitly submits to treaty obligations: *\"Sin perjuicio de lo dispuesto en los tratados internacionales...*\n\n78.\n\nClaimants have also raised the issue that the U.S. - Ecuador BIT has been declared unconstitutional by the Republic's Constitutional Court. The Republic has explained that Article 422 of the Ecuadorian Constitution forbids Ecuador to submit to international arbitration *fora* and acknowledged that the Constitutional Court has found that certain BITs, including the U.S. - Ecuador BIT, are unconstitutional. But Ecuador clarified during the hearing:\n\n\"Esta decision o esta opinion de la Corte constitucional no implica que los tratados hayan salido del ordenamiento juridico ecuatoriano. Los tratados siguen siendo aplicados en el orden juridico ecuatoriano. La consecuencia es que el Ejecutivo tiene el deber, la obligacion de denunciar los tratados de conformidad con la disposicion del tratado respectivo y de conformidad con el derecho internacional.\"73\n\nCounsel for the Republic of Ecuador: Span. Transc. p. 273, l. 12 - 20. *See* Transc. p. 266, 1. 21 - p. 267, 1. 7: \"*This decision or this opinion by the Constitutional Tribunal does not imply that treaties have now been cut out of the legal corpus in Ecuador. They continue to be part of the legal body. The consequence is, however, that the Executive has the obligation of denouncing those treaties in keeping with their own provisions and in keeping with the provisions of international law*\" *.*\n\n79.\n\nThe Republic has thus officially acknowledged that the decision adopted by its Constitutional Court, declaring the unconstitutionality of the U.S. - Ecuador BIT does not affect the validity and enforceability of the Award.\n\n80.\n\nSumming up, although the Committee takes note that the government of Ecuador has forcefully rallied against the propriety of the Award, and may have created a political atmosphere which is hostile to the ICSID adjudication system, there has not been any change in the legal regime applicable to the enforcement of ICSID awards, and the very *Procurador General del Estado* has vouched that such awards are not subject to judicial review in the Republic. As *Procurador* Garcia Carrion himself said during the hearing:\n\n\"El laudo es una aberracion juridica y como tal debe ser y es rechazado por la Rep\u00f9blica del Ecuador. Esta critica sin embargo no quiere decir, como ya la dijera expresamente en su momento, que Ecuador haya dejado o vaya a dejar de cumplir con sus obligaciones internacionales. De hecho Ecuador y sus agencias han cumplido todos y cada uno de los Laudos que han sido dictados en arbitrajes internacionales en su contra.\"74\n\nSpan.Transc. p. 116, l. 10 - 19, emphasis added. *See* Transc. p. 111, 1. 17 - p. 112, 1. 3: \"This Award is a legal aberration, and as such it must be and is being rejected by the Republic of Ecuador. This criticism, however, does not mean, as I already had the opportunity of saying in the past, that Ecuador does not wish to abide by its international obligations. As a matter of fact, Ecuador, and all of its agencies have always fully abided by all of the international awards against it\".\n\n81.\n\nGiven these statements and facts, the Committee must conclude that as of now no deterioration in the likelihood of enforcing an ICSID award in Ecuador has occurred.\n\n*The CAITISA Decree*\n--------------------\n\n82.\n\nClaimants have also drawn the Committee's attention to the so called CAITISA Decree. In Claimants' opinion, this Government-sponsored commission is empowered to subject the Award to scrutiny as to its validity and legality. In Claimants' view, this would confirm the inevitability of an Ecuadorian court reviewing and rejecting the Award. Respondent disagrees, and labels the CAITISA commission simply as a study group.\n\n83.\n\nThe Committee has reviewed the CAITISA Decree75 as published in the Ecuadorian Official Gazette. The CAITISA Commission is an official commission, formed by four representatives of the State, four experts and four representatives of social movements (Article 6). The purpose of the Commission is to submit investment arbitration to an *\"auditorial integral ciudadana'\"* (Article 2), with a time period of eight months (which can be extended once - Article 5). The Commission's task is to evaluate and examine a very wide number of issues relating to investment arbitration in general, and to specific investment awards in particular (Article 3.5).\n\nDoc. CEA 69 A.\n\n84.\n\nThe Republic has explained that the CAITISA commission is simply a study group, and that the result of its audit will not increase the risk of non-compliance with investment arbitration awards. The Committee has no reason to doubt the Republic's statements. That said, the Committee notes that the CAITISA Decree includes, among the powers of the commission, the right to evaluate\n\n\"la validez... de los laudos y decisiones emitidos por los organos y jurisdicciones que son parte del sistema de arbitraje internacional en materia de inversiones que han conocido procesos arbitrales en contra del Ecuador, con el fin de determinar la legalidad, legitimidad y licitud de sus decisiones...\" (Article 2 iii).76\n\nTransc. p. 63, l. 3 - 8: \"[t]he validity... of the awards rendered by investment arbitration tribunals in cases against Ecuador [...], for the purpose of determining the legality, legitimacy, and lawfulness of those decisions...\".\n\n85.\n\nThe Committee acknowledges that, in accordance with the Convention, the validity of ICSID awards can only be challenged under the procedures established in the Convention, and expects that the powers granted to the CAITISA Commission will not be used to undermine the general treaty obligations assumed by the Republic under the Convention in general, and with regard to the Award in particular.\n\n86.\n\nThe Committee expects the Republic to keep it informed regarding any development in Ecuadorian law or judicial practice, which potentially could affect the continuing validity of the statements made by the *Procurador General de la Rep\u00f9blica* in the Rejoinder,77 and of any report issued by the CAITISA commission which could have an impact on the Award or on the present procedure.\n\n*See* para. 76 *supra*.\n\n*Ecuador's Alleged Failure to Comply with Awards*\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n87.\n\nClaimants have also alleged that Ecuador has failed to comply with an UNCITRAL Award in favor of Occidental, the so called VAT Award, and with other decisions by ICSID Tribunals.78\n\nClaimants' Request, paras. 42 - 48.\n\n88.\n\nThe real situation in fact is much more nuanced.\n\n89.\n\nOccidental and Ecuador signed an agreement for the payment of the VAT Award, the so called VAT Agreement, in which both parties agreed that Ecuador would pay US$ 133 million. Ecuador disputed whether it owed an additional amount of US$ 32 million, the Republic deposited such amount in an escrow account, and this new dispute was submitted to a fresh arbitration, which has not been finally solved (there still being an annulment procedure pending).\n\n90.\n\nThe episode surrounding the VAT Award proves the contrary to that what the Claimants are alleging: it shows that Ecuador respected and duly paid/deposited in escrow the amounts awarded to Occidental in the VAT Award.\n\n91.\n\nAs regards other investment arbitrations, not a single concluded case against Ecuador has resulted in enforcement proceedings. Ecuador has been found liable in one case (further to the VAT Award)79 and has complied with the resulting payment obligations.80 In a number of other cases, the claims were discontinued following the parties' settlement.81\n\n*Duke Energy Electroquil Partners and Electroquil S.A. v. Republic of Ecuador*, ICSID Case No. ARB/04/19 (\"*Electroquil*\"); *See* Doc. EEA 50.\n\nAcknowledged by Claimants: Transc. p. 87, l. 9 - 11.\n\n*See* Respondent's Rejoinder, footnote 150, with a list of cases and chart in p. 104 of Ecuador's Opening Memorial.\n\n92.\n\nThe Claimants have drawn the Committee's attention to certain pending arbitral proceedings, in which the Republic has allegedly not complied with provisional measures.82 The Republic rejects the allegation.83 Although States are expected to comply with provisional measures issued by investment tribunals, whether in individual cases a State has complied or not with such orders is irrelevant for the issue under discussion: whether the risk of non-enforcement of the Award in Ecuador has increased.\n\nRespondent's Response, para. 141.\n\n*Perenco Ecuador Limited v.

CAA 8.\n\n*Enforcement Outside Ecuador*\n-----------------------------\n\n93.\n\nClaimants also allege that Respondent has taken steps to ensure that it will be difficult for Claimants to locate assets outside the Republic on which to enforce the Award if Ecuador does not voluntarily pay:84\n\n- Since its last default in 2008, international capital markets have remained closed to Ecuador;\n\n- Ecuador is exporting 60% of its petroleum to Chinese state-owned enterprises;\n\n- Ecuador is planning to sell or liquidate the bank it owns in the U.S. - Pacific National Bank, its largest asset in the U.S.\n\nClaimants' Request, paras. 81 - 84.\n\n94.\n\nThe Respondent has explained that what happened in 2008 was not a repudiation of bonds: the 2008 buy-back auction was a voluntary process and no claim ever has been brought against Ecuador for this reason.85 The Chinese companies buying the oil belong to the same group as Andes, the company with whom Occidental signed the so called *Farmout Agreement,* and in any case is a short term contract. And the sale of the Pacific National Bank was the consequence of an order issued by the U.S. Federal Reserve.86\n\nRespondent's Response, para. 155.\n\nRespondent's Response, para. 188.\n\n95.\n\nIn view of Respondent's explanation, the Committee is satisfied that none of Respondent's actions denounced by Claimants, had the purpose of making enforcement of the Award more difficult, by hiding assets or by transferring such assets to jurisdictions where enforcement of ICSID awards *de facto* or *de iure* is less likely.\n\n96.\n\nSumming up, the Committee comes to the conclusion that Claimants have not been able to prove that there is substantial risk that Ecuador will not comply with the Award:\n\n- It is true that in Ecuador the political reaction against the Award has been vocal and highly critical, but it is also true that the public declarations stopped short of an announcement that the Republic would not comply with its international treaty obligations.\n\n- It is true that the Republic has denounced the Convention and that the Constitutional Court has declared the U.S. - Ecuador BIT unconstitutional, but it is also true that the *Procurador General de la Rep\u00f9blica*, acting on behalf of the Republic, has vouched that under Ecuadorian law ICSID awards issued under the protection of the Convention can be enforced without subjecting those awards to domestic judicial review and without the award creditor having to submit to any domestic enforcement procedure.\n\n97.\n\nThe Claimants have also not been able to prove that the Republic is trying to hide its assets or to move such assets to more favorable jurisdictions, with the aim of hindering the Claimants' eventual enforcement outside Ecuador.\n\n98.\n\nClaimants have failed to prove that, if the annulment decision confirms the validity of the Award, Claimants' rights to enforce the Award, either in Ecuador or in any other Contracting States to the ICSID Convention, have actually deteriorated or that there is a risk that they will deteriorate in the future.\n\n99.\n\nThat said, should the Respondent's future conduct become of such nature as to materially increase the risk of non-compliance with the Award (should the Committee deny annulment), Claimants may request that the Continuation of the Stay granted by this Decision be terminated, as permitted by Rule 54(3) of the Arbitration Rules.\n\nSubsidiary Argument\n-------------------\n\n100.\n\nIn view of the above, it is not necessary for the Committee to analyze Respondent's argument that posting of the security would require Ecuador to freeze US$ 2.3 billion, an amount which represents almost 9% of Ecuador's 2012 budget, or Claimants' counterargument that in reality the amount of the Award only represents a small proportion of Ecuador's windfall profits from Block 15.\n\n**V. DECISION**\n---------------\n\n101.\n\nFor the reasons given above, the Committee unanimously decides:\n\n1. The stay of enforcement of the Award shall for the time being continue unconditionally;\n\n2. The decision on costs is reserved for a later stage of the proceedings."}, {"Title": "Decision on the Request to Modify the Decision on the Stay of Enforcement of the Award", "Type": "Stay of Enforcement", "Date": "2014-09-23T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Decision on the Request to Modify the Decision on the Stay of Enforcement of the Award\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**INTRODUCTION**\n----------------\n\n1.\n\nThe Tribunal issued its Decision on the Stay of Enforcement of the Award [\"**Decision on Stay**\"] on September 30, 2013, holding unanimously that \"the stay of enforcement of the Award shall for the time being continue unconditionally\" and reserving the decision on costs for a later stage in the proceedings.\n\n2.\n\nOn August 1, 2014 Claimants filed a letter requesting that the Committee reconsider and modify the Decision on Stay [\"**Claimants' Request**\"]. On August 28, 2014, the Republic of Ecuador answered Claimants' Request with a letter requesting the Committee to deny Claimants' Request [\"**Ecuador's Answer**\"]. The arguments raised by the Parties in their recent letters are summarized in the following sections.\n\n**CLAIMANTS' ARGUMENTS**\n------------------------\n\n3.\n\nClaimants request that the Decision on Stay be reconsidered and modified within certain limits.\n\n4.\n\nAccording to Claimants, the collection of a US$11.5 million judgment by the Ecuador National Court of Justice [the \"**Tax Judgment**\"] is imminent. The Tax Judgment derives from an income tax assessment issued in 2001 by Ecuador's *Servicio de Rentas Internas* [\"**SRI**\"] against Occidental Exploration and Production Company [\"**OEPC**\"]. OEPC challenged the assessment before the National Court of Justice and the Constitutional Court, but both courts dismissed the case in favor of the SRI.\n\n5.\n\nClaimants allege that they have requested Ecuador to temporarily suspend the enforcement of the Tax Judgment until the Committee renders a final decision on this case. However, Ecuador has refused to do so.\n\n6.\n\nClaimants acknowledge that the merits of the Tax Judgment are beyond the scope of the Committee's jurisdiction, but argue that the decision is a \"clear violation of Ecuador's tax laws and represents yet another infringement on the rights of OEPC\"1. Thus, Claimants request that the Committee modify the Decision on Stay so that, if Ecuador takes steps to enforce the Tax Judgment against OEPC, Claimants can enforce a portion of the Award equivalent to the amount of the Tax Judgment or any other amount that Ecuador may seek in respect to the Tax Judgment.\n\nClaimants' Request, p. 2\n\n7.\n\nClaimants support their request alleging that the Arbitration Rules vest the Committee with jurisdiction to lift the stay at any time in its absolute discretion and point to language of the Tribunal in the Decision on Stay: \" [t]he Committee's decision is not final: it \u2018may at any time modify or terminate the stay at the request of either party'\".\n\n8.\n\nFurthermore, Claimants raise fairness and prejudice arguments.\n\n9.\n\nFirst, Claimants recall that it is neither fair nor appropriate for Ecuador to enforce a US$11.5 million tax claim against OEPC while OEPC is stayed from collecting its Award of more than US$2.3 billion (including interest) against Ecuador. Thus, if Ecuador enforces the Tax Judgment, Claimants should at least be entitled to set off that portion of the Award against the amount Ecuador seeks.\n\n10.\n\nSecond, given the respective amounts of the Award and the Tax Judgment, and the fact that Claimants have been precluded from enforcing the Award for almost two years, the prejudice suffered by Claimants in delaying the enforcement of the Award far outweighs any inconvenience to Ecuador by delaying enforcement of the Tax Judgment or by allowing a set off of the claims. Furthermore, Claimants aver that so long as the Award remains outstanding, they run the risk that it might not be satisfied. Such risk will be mitigated - to a very small extent - by the limited modification of the Decision on Stay.\n\n11.\n\nTherefore, Claimants request that the Committee exercise its discretion to modify the Decision on Stay, precluding Ecuador from enforcing the Tax Judgment, while Claimants remain unable to recover the amount owed under the Award.\n\n**RESPONDENT'S ARGUMENTS**\n--------------------------\n\n12.\n\nRespondent submits that Claimants' request is ill-founded and must be rejected by the Committee for five reasons:\n\n13.\n\nFirst, Respondent alleges that not every circumstance justifies the lifting of a stay of enforcement. Even though Respondent acknowledges that the Committee has discretion to lift the stay of enforcement, the Committee has established the standard for doing so: an increased risk of noncompliance with the Award2. Respondent argues that Claimants do not even purport to establish an increased risk of non-compliance with the Award.\n\nRespondent cites to Decision on Stay, \u00a799.\n\n14.\n\nFurthermore, Respondent avers that the Committee's mission is strictly to assess whether the Award should be annulled and decide whether its enforcement should be stayed, but it has no power to verify whether Ecuadorian Courts correctly applied Ecuadorian law.\n\n15.\n\nSecond, Respondent alleges that Claimants' request is based on misrepresentations that the decisions that led to the Tax Judgment and the Tax judgment itself infringe Ecuadorian Law. Ecuador also submits that Claimants cannot rely in their request on a tax dispute over which they themselves have admitted that the Committee has no jurisdiction.\n\n16.\n\nThird, Ecuador submits that Claimants' argument that they would suffer prejudice if their request is denied has already been dismissed by the Committee, because:\n\n- Delays in the enforcement of an award resulting from annulment proceedings cannot be attributed to the award debtor because they are inherent to the ICSID system;\n\n- The delay in enforcement can be remedied by the awarding of post-award interest;\n\n- Claimants boast of being financially robust; thus, any delay in the enforcement of the Award for the sum of approximately US$11 million will not cause them irreparable harm.\n\n17.\n\nFourth, Respondent submits that Claimants' fairness argument is cynical:\n\n- Ecuador had a right to request a stay of enforcement of the award and, under Ecuadorian Law, the Tax Judgment must be executed;\n\n- There is nothing unfair regarding the execution of the Tax Judgment, while using the ICSID system to circumvent paying taxes or executing *res judicata* judgments is an abuse of process and, thus, both inequitable and unfair.\n\n18.\n\nFifth, Respondent emphasizes that Claimants no longer pursue the escrowing of the amount granted under the Award, but the enforcement of a portion of such Award. According to Respondent, no *ad hoc* committee has ever lifted a stay up to a certain portion of the amount of the corresponding award regardless of the actual committee's decision, and Claimants have failed to establish any legal basis on which the Committee could do so.\n\n19.\n\nTherefore, Ecuador requests that the Committee dismiss Claimants' Request and issue a cost order in favor of Ecuador.\n\n**THE COMMITTEE'S POSITION**\n----------------------------\n\n20.\n\nOn October 5, 2012 the Arbitral Tribunal issued its Award in the present case. In essence, the decision awarded Claimants:\n\n- the amount of US$ 1,769,625,000 for damages suffered;\n\n- pre-award interest at the rate of 4,188% since May 16, 2006;\n\n- post-award interest from the date of the Award at the U.S. 6 month LIBOR rate, compounded on a monthly basis.\n\n21.\n\nOn October 9, 2012 the Republic of Ecuador submitted an application for the annulment of the Award, which included a request for a stay of enforcement, and the enforcement of the Award was provisionally stayed by the Secretary-General of ICSID.\n\n22.\n\nOn February 13, 2013 Claimants filed a request for the lifting of the provisional stay. Claimants requested that the provisional stay should be lifted or alternatively that any continued stay be conditioned on Ecuador providing proper security. Respondent replied requesting that the stay be continued, and that Claimants' request for the posting of security be dismissed.\n\n23.\n\nOn September 30, 2013 the Committee issued its Decision on Stay:\n\n\"1. The stay of enforcement of the Award shall for the time being continue unconditionally;\n\n2. The decision on costs is reserved for a later stage of the proceedings.\"\n\n24.\n\nClaimants now request that\n\n\"the Committee modify the Stay Decision, so that, if Ecuador takes steps to enforce the US$11.5 million Tax Judgment against OEPC, Claimants would have the right to enforce a portion of the Award equivalent to the amount of the Tax Judgment or any other amount that Ecuador may seek in respect of the Tax Judgment.\"\n\nThe Committee's powers\n----------------------\n\n25.\n\nArticle 54(3) of the Arbitration Rules provides:\n\n\"(3) If a stay of enforcement has been granted pursuant to paragraph (1) or continued pursuant to paragraph (2), the Tribunal or Committee may at any time modify or terminate the stay at the request of either party.\n\n26.\n\nAccording to this provision, the Committee has the power to modify its Decision on Stay of the Award in the course of the annulment procedure. This provision must be read in conjunction with Article 52(5) of the Convention3. Thus, the Committee may modify its Decision on Stay \"if it considers that the circumstances so require.\"\n\nArt. 52(5) of the Convention:\"The Committee may, if it considers that the circumstances so require, stay enforcement of the award pending its decision. If the applicant requests a stay of enforcement of the award in his application, enforcement shall be stayed provisionally until the Committee rules on such request.\"\n\nAnalysis\n--------\n\n27.\n\nClaimants submit that a hypothetical future enforcement of the Tax Judgment merits the immediate modification of the Decision on Stay, while Respondent denies that a modification of the Decision on Stay is justified, and adds that Claimants have not even purported to establish that the possible enforcement of the Tax Judgment entails an increased risk of non-compliance.\n\n28.\n\nThe Committee agrees with Respondent that the enforcement by the Republic of Ecuador of an unrelated Tax Judgment is a sovereign action over which the Committee has no jurisdiction, and that such action does not imply that the Republic will not comply with the Award, if the decision of the Committee is to uphold it. There is no evidence that the decision to enforce or not to enforce the Tax Judgment will result in a material increase of the risk of non-compliance with the Award.\n\n29.\n\nThe risk of non-compliance is not the only circumstance which can justify a decision by the Committee to amend or to lift its Decision on Stay. The Committee is authorized to do so \"if it considers that the circumstances so require\". Reasons of fairness and justice may also form part of the circumstances taken into account.\n\n30.\n\nClaimants acknowledge that Ecuador has yet to take steps to enforce the Tax Judgment; they simply voice the risk that Ecuador may do so in the future. Given these facts, the Committee finds that it is premature to take any decision with regard to Claimants' request to amend the Decision on Stay.\n\n31.\n\nNotwithstanding the above, the Committee recalls the principle of non-aggravation of the dispute, which requires parties to a dispute submitted to international law to abstain from any action, regardless of its nature that may aggravate or extend the controversy pending before the tribunal4.\n\nSee e.g. the decision by the Permanente Court of International Justice in the case of *The Electricity Company of Sofia - Belgium v. Bulgaria* PCIJ, Ser. A/B, No. 79, 1939.\n\n32.\n\nThe Committee expects both parties to adhere to such principle, while the Committee finalizes its task of deliberating and drafting its decision. Consequently, Ecuador is requested to inform the Committee in advance, before adopting any action to enforce the Tax Judgment against any of the Claimants or their assets."}, {"Title": "Decision on Annulment of the Award", "Type": "Annulment", "Date": "2015-11-02T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Decision on Annulment of the Award\n----------------------------------\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **List of Defined Terms** | |\n| **AEC** | City Investing Company Limited, a Bermuda company, or its mother company Alberta Energy Corporation Ltd., a Canadian company. |\n| **Andes** | Andes Petroleum Co. |\n| **Application** | Application for annulment of the Award dated October 9, 2012. |\n| **Arbitrability Objection** | Ecuador's jurisdictional objection as defined in para. 71 *infra*. |\n| **Award** | *Occidental Petroleum Corporation and Occidental Exploration and Production Company v.

THE ARBITRATION**\n----------------------\n\n**1. SUMMARY OF THE DISPUTE**\n-----------------------------\n\n1.\n\nThe Parties to the underlying arbitration were Occidental Petroleum Corporation (\" **OPC** \") and Occidental Exploration and Production Company (\" **OEPC** \") two U.S. companies, acting as Claimants (the \" **Claimants** \"), and the Republic of Ecuador (\" **Ecuador** \" or the \" **Republic** \"), as Respondent.\n\n2.\n\nThe dispute concerned the termination through the \" ***Caducidad*** **Decree** \", issued by the Ecuadorian Minister of Energy and Mines (the \" **Minister** \") on May 15, 2006, of a Participation Contract dated May 21, 1999 between OEPC and PetroEcuador for the exploration and exploitation of hydrocarbons in Block 15 in the Ecuadorian Amazon. Claimants alleged breaches by Ecuador of domestic and international law, especially of the 1993 Treaty between the United States of America and the Republic of Ecuador Concerning the Encouragement and Reciprocal Protection of Investments (the \" **Treaty** \", the \" **BIT** \" or \" **US - Ecuador BIT** \").\n\n3.\n\nRespondent denied Claimants' allegations of breach and formulated a counterclaim, asking the Tribunal to declare that it had fulfilled its obligations under the Participation Contract, Ecuadorian Law and the Treaty, and to dismiss all of Claimants' claims.\n\n4.\n\nBefore summarizing the arbitration procedure and in order to ensure a proper context for its Decision, the Committee has prepared a brief summary of the facts that gave rise to the underlying dispute.\n\n**2. Factual Background**\n-------------------------\n\nThe Participation Contract\n--------------------------\n\n5.\n\nThe Republic of Ecuador, through PetroEcuador, and OEPC entered into a Participation Contract for Block 151 in Ecuador on May 21, 1999 (the \" **Participation Contract** \").\n\nAn area of approximately 200,000 hectares in Ecuador's most prolific oil-producing region.\n\n6.\n\nUnder the Participation Contract, which was subject to Ecuadorian Law, OEPC received a share of the oil produced from Block 15, in return for undertaking the obligation to explore, develop and exploit Block 15, and assuming responsibility for all associated expenditures2:\n\n\"116. The Participation Contract, which expressly stated that it was to be \"governed exclusively by Ecuadorian law,\" transformed the conditions under which OEPC operated in Ecuador. Pursuant to Clause 4.2 of the Participation Contract, OEPC would no longer be reimbursed for its expenditures in exploring and producing Block 15. In return for accepting the obligation to explore, develop and exploit Block 15, and being responsible for all the associated expenditures, OEPC received a share of the oil produced from Block 15, referred to as OEPC's \"participation\". Clause 4.3 provided that \"Contractor shall invest capital and use the personnel, equipment, machinery and technology needed for the faithful performance of such activities in consideration of which Contractor shall receive, as participation, the percentage of Fiscalized Production provided for in Clause 8.1.\" OEPC also had various other obligations under the Participation Contract, including payment of all Ecuadorian taxes and duties; periodic reporting of certain information to Ecuador; the establishment of good relations with the community; and the protection of the environment\".\n\nAward at 116.\n\n7.\n\nAlthough, OEPC was free to dispose of its share of the Participation Contract, the transfer of such Contract and the assignment to third parties of rights arising thereunder required authorization from the Minister. The Participation Contract also provided that the transfer of rights or obligations without authorization of the Minister could result in termination of that Contract. The Tribunal explained these facts as follows3:\n\n\"119. The Tribunal notes, since this provision will be referred to later in the present Award, that OEPC was allowed to dispose freely of its share of the production from Block 15 as it wished. Under Clause 5.3.2, OEPC had the right to \"[r]eceive and freely dispose of Contractor participation as established in Clause 8.1 of this Participation Contract\". While OEPC could freely dispose of its participation, its ability to transfer or assign its rights and obligations under the Participation Contract was subject to stringent conditions. Chapter 16 of the Participation Contract, entitled \"Transfer and Assignment\", sets forth these conditions in provisions which are at the heart of the parties' dispute in this arbitration\".\n\nAward at 119.\n\nThe Farmout Agreements\n----------------------\n\n8.\n\nIn 2000 OEPC and City Investing Company Limited (\" **AEC** \"), a Bermuda company, explored the possibility of a \"farm-in\" transaction over Block 154:\n\n\"127. In order to finance the expansion of its operations in Ecuador, OEPC sought an arrangement that could provide the necessary funds, as well as diversify and reduce its exposure. At the same time, Alberta Energy Corporation Ltd. (\"AEC\") [...] was looking to expand its investments in Ecuador. AEC had originally considered purchasing outright Block 15 from OEPC in 1999, together with two unrelated companies, City Investing and City Oriente, which operated blocks to the north of Block 15. However, while it did purchase the City companies that year, it did not approach OEPC about a purchase of Block 15 until 2000. On 15 May 2000, AEC made a formal proposal to OEPC to acquire OEPC's entire interest in Block 15. OEPC rejected AEC's proposal.\n\n128. AEC then proposed to \"farmin\" to Block 15. OEPC stated to the Tribunal that a farmout agreement with AEC was an attractive alternative because it allowed OEPC to continue to invest in Block 15 but with less of its own capital and to diversify its in-country risk. (\u2026)\".\n\nAward at 127-128.\n\n9.\n\nIn October 2000, OEPC and AEC executed the Farmout Agreement (the \" **Farmout Agreement** \" or \" **Farmout** \"). The parties also signed a joint operating agreement in order to implement the Farmout (the \" **Joint Operating Agreement** \", and together with the Farmout, the \" **Farmout Agreements** \").\n\n10.\n\nThe Farmout Agreement, was subject to New York law and provided for two phases5:\n\n\"130. [...] In the first phase of the transaction AEC purchased a 40% so-called \"economic interest\" in Block 15. Essentially, through contributions to OEPC's Block 15 investments, AEC purchased the right to 40% of OEPC's share of Block 15's production. This stage of the Farmout was described in Article II, titled \"Farmout of Interest in Farmout Property\". [Emphasis added]\n\n[\u2026]\n\n131. The second stage of the Farmout was described in Article IV of the Farmout Agreement, titled \" Assignment of Legal Title \". Article 4.01 provided that this phase could not occur until and unless two conditions were met : AEC had made the required payments, and the Government had given its prior authorization [\u2026]\". [Emphasis added]\n\nAward at 130-131.\n\n11.\n\nAEC paid approximately US$ 180 million to OEPC as consideration for the acquisition of its 40% economic interest in the production from Block 15, an amount equivalent to 40% of the expenditure so far. Thereafter, in compliance with the obligations assumed in the Farmout Agreements, AEC regularly paid to OEPC 40% of the expenditure incurred in the exploitation and development of Block 15 and received 40% of the oil produced6:\n\n\"132. In exchange for its economic interest in the production from Block 15,\n\nAEC agreed to pay 40% of all the capital and operating expenses in developing Block 15. Article 2.02 of the Farmout provided:\n\nAs between OEPC and [AEC], [AEC] upon Closing shall be obligated and agrees to perform all obligations and to bear and pay all costs, charges, expenses and liabilities attributable to the Farmout Interest in the Participating Agreements and Block 15 [...]\".\n\n133. AEC also agreed to pay approximately $180 million towards OEPC's historical development costs. Under Article 3.02, approximately $70 million was to be paid upon Closing. Pursuant to Article 3.03, AEC's payment of the remaining amount was spread over four years according to the following schedule: $50 million in 2001, $25 million in 2002, $20 million in 2003 and $15 million in 2004\".\n\nAward at 132-133.\n\nThe Farmout and Ecuador\n-----------------------\n\n12.\n\nA few days before the execution of the Farmout Agreement, OEPC representatives held a meeting with Ecuador's Minister of Mines to inform the Minister about the Farmout7:\n\n\"147. On 24 October 2000, senior executives of both OEPC and AEC flew to Quito from the United States and Canada in order to meet with the Minister of Energy and Mines, Pablo Ter\u00e1n, in the Minister's office. The purpose of the meeting was to inform the Minister about the Farmout and discuss the commitment to the OCP pipeline and new projects in Ecuador. Casey Olson, then Executive Vice President for Business Development of Occidental, and Paul MacInnes, then President and General Manager of OEPC, attended this meeting on behalf of OEPC. Steven Bell, then Vice President International of AEC, and Stephen Newton, then President and General Manager of AEC Ecuador, attended on behalf of AEC. Minister Ter\u00e1n was the only representative of Ecuador present at the meeting.\n\n148. There were two distinct subject matters which were addressed during the meeting and the meeting itself had two distinct phases. The purpose of the first session, which lasted about 45 minutes, was to present the Farmout to Minister Ter\u00e1n and was attended by both the OEPC and AEC officials. In the second session, attended only by the OEPC officials and Minister Ter\u00e1n, the parties discussed new projects in Ecuador that OEPC was interested in pursuing\".\n\nAward at 147-148.\n\n13.\n\nAlthough there is controversy regarding what was said at the meeting, both parties acknowledged that no copy of the Farmout Agreements was handed to the Minister8. OEPC at a later date sent a letter to the Minister requesting consent with respect to the transfer of economic interests in favor of AEC9:\n\n\"151. The next day, on October 25, 2000, Mr. MacInnes wrote to Minister Ter\u00e1n regarding the previous day's meeting. Mr. MacInnes wrote that the Farmout was an \u2018imminent transaction pursuant to which [OEPC] intends to transfer to [AEC] 40% of its economic interest in the Participation Contract.' Mr. MacInnes also wrote that, following that first stage of the transaction, \u2018OEPC will continue being the only \u2018Contractor' entity under the Contract for Block 15;' and that \u2018once [AEC] has complied with its obligations contemplated in the transfer agreement, OEPC shall transfer to [AEC] the legal title corresponding to 40% of its interests [...] subject to the approvals that the Government of Ecuador may require at that time.' The letter ended with a request to the Minister to \u2018confirm [\u2026] [the] consent with respect to the aforementioned transfer of economic interests in favor of [AEC]'\".\n\nAward at 150.\n\nAward at 151.\n\n14.\n\nThe issue of whether the Minister had or had not indicated whether approval for the transfer of economic interest was required became very relevant in the proceedings10:\n\n\"152. As explained later in this Award, one of the central issues in this proceeding is whether, during the meeting of 24 October 2000, Minister Ter\u00e1n\n\nin fact indicated that government approval was (or was not) required for the transfer of the economic interest to AEC under the Farmout. In this regard, the Tribunal notes that upon closing the Farmout on 31 October 2000, OEPC and AEC entered into a letter agreement mutually waiving satisfaction of any required government approvals for the first stage of the Farmout. That letter also expressly envisaged the requirement of government approval for the contemplated future transfer of legal title to AEC\".\n\nAward at 152.\n\n15.\n\nIn November 2000 the closing of the Farmout Agreement was made public through a press release issued by OEPC's ultimate parent, OPC11. Between late October and late November 2000, there were meetings between OEPC's and PetroEcuador's executives in which the Farmout was mentioned12. In addition, government agencies - the Ministry of Energy and Mines and the National Hydrocarbons Directorate (\" **DNH** \") - requested from OEPC information regarding AEC's financial and technical capabilities and issued memoranda regarding the transaction13.\n\nAward at 153.\n\nAward at 154.\n\nAward at 155, 158.\n\n16.\n\nFinally, on January 2001, Ecuador's Minister of Mines answered OEPC's letter of October 25, 200014:\n\n\"159. [\u2026] noting the company's \"intention to transfer in the future 40% of the rights and obligations of block 15,\" and indicating that such a future transfer would require prior government approval. Minister Ter\u00e1n also stated that OEPC \u2018shall be the sole company that will continue participating in the current contract with the Ecuadorian State since it is the owner of 100% of the rights and obligations'\".\n\nAward at 159.\n\n17.\n\nThe issue of the transfer of rights by OEPC to AEC resurfaced in 2003 when an audit firm was retained by the DNH to conduct an audit of OEPC. The auditors issued a report in July 2004 recommending that OEPC seek government authorization for the assignment15:\n\n\"167. Moores Rowland issued its audit report on 14 July 2004, noting therein that the assignment of rights and obligations contemplated in the Farmout was made contingent on future events and that the assignment \"might or might not happen\" at the end of the four years during which the conditions were to be satisfied. The audit report recommended to the DNH that OEPC seek government authorization for the assignment during that year, assuming the assignment conditions were satisfied, and that the required ministerial approval be granted to OEPC in order to properly register the assignment\".\n\nAward at 167.\n\n18.\n\nThe day after the issuance of the audit report, OEPC wrote a letter to the new Minister of Energy and Mines requesting his approval for the transfer by OEPC to AEC of legal title to a 40% interest in Block 15. The approval was not granted16:\n\n\"169. The approval sought by OEPC was not granted. Rather, on 24 August 2004, as set forth in more detail later in this Award, the Attorney General of Ecuador ordered the Ministry of Mines and Energy to terminate the Participation Contract and the Unitized Fields Joint Operating Agreements through a declaration of *caducidad* \".\n\nAward at 169.\n\nThe VAT Dispute\n---------------\n\n19.\n\n19. In August 2001, the SRI - Ecuador's Tax Authority - changed its practice of refunding value added taxes (\" **VAT** \") to oil companies and retrospectively claimed refunds of the taxes already paid. OEPC initiated an arbitration (the \" **VAT Arbitration** \") seeking redress for the measure and obtained a US$ 75 million award (the \" **VAT Award** \") against Ecuador17:\n\n\"170. In August 2001, Ecuador's tax authority, the SRI, contrary to its established practice of refunding value added taxes (\"VAT\") to oil companies, refused to grant such refunds in the future and, retroactively, claimed refunds of the taxes already paid. OEPC interpreted this decision to be a violation of Ecuadorian tax laws and the Treaty and, in November 2002, filed an international arbitration claim against Ecuador to recover the VAT refunds.\n\n171. On 1 July 2004, the VAT Tribunal issued a $75 million VAT Award in OEPC's favor, finding that Ecuador's conduct had been unfair and discriminatory. The VAT Award was sent to the parties on 12 July 2004, and was immediately made public.\n\n172. Ecuador challenged the award in the English courts. Its annulment application was rejected by the High Court on 2 March 2006 and that decision was confirmed by the Court of Appeal on 4 July 2007\".\n\nAward at 170-171\n\n20.\n\nOn August 3, 2004, just a few weeks after the issuance of the VAT Award, Ecuador enacted the \" **VAT Interpretative Law** \" clarifying that the regime of VAT reimbursements was not applicable to petroleum operations18:\n\n\"548. The VAT Law, also referred to as the VAT Interpretative Law, was passed by the Ecuadorian Congress on 3 August 2004 very shortly after the VAT Award's release on 2 August 2004. Its sole article provides as follows:\n\nArticle 69-A of the Internal Tax Regime Law [\u2026] is hereby interpreted in the sense that reimbursement of Value Added Taxes, VAT, is not applicable to petroleum activities when referring to extraction, transportation and commercialization of oil, since petroleum is not produced, but is extracted from the respective reservoirs\".\n\nAward at 548.\n\nThe *Caducidad* proceedings\n---------------------------\n\n21.\n\nIn September 2004, upon request of the Attorney General, the Minister of Energy and Mines instructed PetroEcuador to initiate the termination procedure of the Participation Contract19:\n\n\"180. In a letter to the Executive President of PetroEcuador dated 8 September 2004, Minister L\u00f3pez, acting upon the Attorney General's request of 24 August 2004, instructed PetroEcuador to initiate the termination procedure. The Minister's letter attached OEPC's request of 15 July 2004 for the transfer to AEC of 40% of the legal title to Block 15, the Farmout Agreement and the Joint Operating Agreement, as well as a report from the DNH listing various technical infractions committed by OEPC. Acting on Minister L\u00f3pez's letter, on 15 September 2004, PetroEcuador notified OEPC of its alleged noncompliance with the Participation Contract. This notification gave OEPC ten business days to respond to the allegations. On 24 September 2004, OEPC sent a detailed 28-page letter to PetroEcuador denying the Attorney General's allegations\".\n\nAward at 180.\n\n22.\n\nThe *Caducidad* proceedings against OEPC culminated on May 15, 2006 with the issuance of a *Caducidad* Decree20:\n\n\"199. On 15 May 2006, Minister Rodr\u00edguez issued the *Caducidad* Decree. The Decree terminated, with immediate effect, OEPC's Participation Contract and ordered OEPC to turn over to PetroEcuador all its assets relating to Block 15. The thirty-three page Decree included: (i) a summary of the termination process; (ii) block quotes from the letters of the Attorney General, PetroEcuador and OEPC; (iii) additional description of these letters and the positions articulated therein, as well as descriptions of other documents in the record; (iv) a description of norms considered; and (v) approximately four pages of reasoning. The Decree cited as a legal basis for *caducidad* Articles 74.11, 74.12 and 74.13 of the HCL\".\n\nAward at 199.\n\nLaw 42\n------\n\n23.\n\nIn April 2006, Ecuador enacted \" **Law 42** \", which required all companies operating under participation contracts to contribute 50% of their windfall revenues to the State21:\n\n\"465. Law 42, also referred to as the HCL Amendment, was passed by the Ecuadorian Congress on 19 April 2006 and published in the Official Gazette on 25 April 2006. Law 42 added a provision to the HCL titled \u2018State's Participation in surplus from oil sales prices not agreed upon or not foreseen'. This provision, which became Article 55 of the HCL, states, in relevant part, as follows:\n\nContractor companies that hold participation contracts for the exploration and exploitation of hydrocarbons in effect with the Ecuadorian State in accordance with this Law, without prejudice to the volume of participation crude oil that corresponds to them, when the average actual monthly FOB sales price of Ecuadorian crude oil exceeds the average monthly sales price in effect on the date on which the contract was executed [\u2026] shall recognize a participation in favor of the Ecuadorian State of at least 50% of the extraordinary revenues generated by the difference in prices. For purposes of this article, extraordinary revenues shall be understood to mean the difference in price described above, multiplied by the number of barrels produced.\n\nThe price of crude oil as of the date of contract execution, used as reference to calculate of the difference, shall be adjusted based on the United States' Consumer Price Index published by the Central Bank of Ecuador.\n\n466. On 13 July 2006, Ecuador issued Decree 1672 implementing Law 42 at the 50% rate\". [Footnotes omitted]\n\n**3.**  **Decision on Jurisdiction and Award**\n\nAward at 465-466.\n\n24.\n\nOn May 17, 2006, Claimants commenced an international investment arbitration against Ecuador under the Treaty, which eventually led to the Decision on Jurisdiction and the Award challenged in these proceedings.\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction\n------------------------\n\n25.\n\nRespondent submitted two jurisdictional objections:\n\n- Under the first objection Respondent argued that the adjudication of the Parties' dispute was governed by the Participation Contract, which allegedly excluded *caducidad* from arbitration;\n\n- Under the second objection Respondent averred that Claimants had failed to respect the six-month waiting period, imposed by Article VI.3 of the Treaty, for submission of the dispute to arbitration.\n\n26.\n\nThe Tribunal issued a Decision on Jurisdiction dated September 9, 2008, (the \" **Decision on Jurisdiction** \") in which it dismissed the objections and decided as follows22:\n\n\"97. For the foregoing reasons, the Tribunal decides and declares as follows:\n\n(i) the Respondent's first jurisdictional objection is denied;\n\n(ii) the Respondent's second jurisdictional objection is denied;\n\n(iii) the Respondent's alternative request for \"an order that this arbitration be stayed until OEPC challenges the *Caducidad* Decree in the competent Ecuadorian administrative court and that court issues a final ruling on such challenge\" is denied; and\n\n(iv) the Tribunal has jurisdiction over both OEPC's and OPC's claims in this proceeding and the arbitral proceedings will continue to the merits phase in accordance with the calendar established in the Tribunal's Procedural Order N\u00b0. 1 as modified by Procedural Order N\u00b0. 2\".\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction at 97.\n\nThe Award\n---------\n\n27.\n\nOn October 5, 2012 the Tribunal issued its Award (the \" **Award** \"), which in its dispositive section ordered the following23:\n\n\"876. For all of the foregoing reasons, and rejecting all submissions and contentions to the contrary, the Tribunal DECLARES, AWARDS and ORDERS as follows in respect of the issues arising for determination in these proceedings:\n\n(i) Ecuador acted in breach of Article II.3(a) of the Treaty by failing to accord fair and equitable treatment to the Claimants' investment, and to accord the Claimants treatment no less [ *favourable* ] than that required by international law;\n\n(ii) Ecuador acted in breach of Article III.1 of the Treaty by expropriating the Claimants' investment in Block 15 through a measure \"tantamount to expropriation\";\n\n(iii) Ecuador issued the *Caducidad* Decree in breach of Ecuadorian law and customary international law;\n\n(iv) OEPC breached Clause 16.1 of the Participation Contract by failing to secure the required ministerial authorization for the transfer of rights under the Farmout Agreement; as a result of this breach, the damages awarded to the Claimants will be reduced by a factor of 25% (see subparagraph (v));\n\n(v) Claimants are awarded the amount of US$ 1,769,625,000 (US One billion, seven hundred sixty nine millions, six hundred twenty five thousand dollars), as calculated in paragraph 825 of this Award, for damages suffered as a result of the breaches set out above in subparagraphs (i), (ii) and (iii);\n\n(vi) Ecuador is ordered to pay pre-award interest on the above amount at the rate of 4,188% per annum, compounded annually from 16 May 2006 until the date of this Award;\n\n(vii) Ecuador is ordered to pay post-award interest from the date of this Award at the U.S. 6 month LIBOR rate, compounded on a monthly basis; and\n\n(viii) Ecuador's counterclaims, except that counterclaim specified in subparagraph (iv) above, are dismissed; and\n\n(ix) Each Party is ordered to bear its own costs of the proceedings and the Claimants and the Respondent are ordered and mandated each to pay half of ICSID's and the Tribunal's costs of and incidental to the proceedings.\n\n877. In accordance with Article 48(4) of the ICSID Convention, Arbitrator Stern dissents from the above majority and her statement of dissent is attached\".\n\nAward at 876-877.\n\nDissenting Opinion\n------------------\n\n28.\n\nArbitrator Stern dissented from the majority and attached a statement of dissent (the \" **Dissent** \"). Prof. Stern summarized her dissent as follows24:\n\n\"1. The present case is a very complex case to which the three members of the Tribunal have been extremely devoted during many years. Although I greatly respect and esteem my distinguished colleagues, I could not concur with them on several important legal findings. While I subscribe to the analysis of the facts and the law concluding that the Respondent acted in a disproportionate manner in its reaction to the serious violation of its laws by the Claimants, I am in complete disagreement with the way damages have been calculated, which I consider to be resting on grossly incorrect legal bases. To be accurate, I don't have a problem with figures, I have a problem with principles that were applied (or not) to reach these figures.\n\n2. As a matter of fact, I disagree with all the answers given to what the Tribunal has called the \"four \u2018core' threshold quantum issues\" described in the following manner (\u00a7457 of the Award):\n\nThese issues concern the impact (if any) on the Tribunal's determination of quantum of:\n\n1) The Ecuadorian Law 42;\n\n2) The Ecuadorian VAT Interpretative Law;\n\n3) The Farmout Agreement; and\n\n4) The fault of the Claimants prior to the *Caducidad* Decree.\n\n3. To give a general overview of my main points of disagreement, I can state that they are of two different types.\n\n4. Firstly, there are - as is often encountered in a complex case as the one at stake - disagreements that would not, by themselves, have prompted me to write a dissent. On one hand, I consider that the consequence of the fault committed by the Claimants, when they violated the Ecuadorian law, is overly underestimated and insufficiently taking into account the importance that each and every State assigns to the respect of its legal order by foreign companies. On the other hand, I have a different analysis of the laws applicable in the determination of damages. These disagreements concern respectively the issues 4, 1 and 2 above.\n\n5. Secondly, there is the fundamental impossibility for me to follow the different statements in the Award relating to the effect this Tribunal should give to the Farmout Agreement. The majority's position on the effect of the Farmout Agreement is, in my view, so egregious in legal terms and so full of contradictions, that I could not but express my dissent. In my view, there are two major questionable aspects in the majority's approach to the question of the effectiveness of the Farmout Agreement: the first is the analysis of the question of the effectiveness of a legal act under Ecuadorian law, which is based on a total lack of reasons, with the consequence that I was not able to follow the \"reasoning\" from point A to point B, as well as gross errors of law in the purported interpretation of the content of Ecuadorian law; the second, which in my view is even a more serious matter, is the manifest excess of power of the Award nullifying a contract concerning a company which not only was not a party to the arbitration, but moreover - even if it had been a party - could not be considered, being a Chinese company, as an investor over which the Tribunal had jurisdiction under the US/Ecuador BIT\".\n\nDissent at 1-5.\n\n**II. THE ANNULMENT PROCEDURE**\n-------------------------------\n\n29.\n\nOn October 9, 2012, the Republic of Ecuador filed with ICSID an application for annulment of the Award and a request to stay the enforcement of the Award (\" **Application** \").\n\n30.\n\nOn October 11, 2012, pursuant to Rules 50(2)(a) and (b) of the ICSID Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings of April 2006 (\" **iCsiD Arbitration Rules** \"), the Secretary-General of ICSID registered the Application and notified the Parties of the provisional stay of enforcement of the Award under ICSID Arbitration Rule 54(2).\n\n31.\n\nOn January 18, 2013, the Secretary-General, in accordance with Rule 6(1) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules, notified the Parties that the three members of the *ad hoc* Committee had accepted their appointments and that the *ad hoc* Committee was therefore deemed to have been constituted on that date. The *ad hoc* Committee was composed of Prof. Juan Fern\u00e1ndez-Armesto, a national of the Kingdom of Spain, President of the Committee; Judge Florentino Feliciano, a national of the Philippines; and Mr. Rodrigo Oreamuno Blanco, a national of Costa Rica. Mr. Gonzalo Flores, Senior ICSID Legal Counsel, was designated to serve as Secretary of the *ad hoc* Committee.\n\n32.\n\nOn February 13, 2013, the Claimants filed a request to terminate the stay of enforcement of the Award.\n\n33.\n\nOn March 25, 2013, the *ad hoc* Committee held a first session with the parties by telephone conference. During the session the Parties agreed to a series of procedural matters, including, that this proceeding would be governed by the 2006 ICSID Arbitration Rules. The Parties confirmed that the Committee had been properly constituted in accordance with the ICSID Convention and the ICSID Arbitration Rules and that they had no objection to the appointment of any of its members. During the session a schedule for the written and oral pleadings was fixed.\n\n34.\n\nOn April 5, 2013, the Republic of Ecuador filed observations on the Claimants' request to terminate the stay of enforcement of the Award.\n\n35.\n\nOn April 10, 2013, the ad hoc Committee issued Procedural Order No. 1.\n\n36.\n\nOn April 22, 2013 the Claimants filed a reply to Ecuador's observations of April 5; and on May 6, 2013 Ecuador filed a rejoinder to the Claimants' reply.\n\n37.\n\nAs directed in Procedural Order No. 1, a one-day hearing on the matter of the stay of enforcement of the Award was held on May 13, 2013, in Paris, France.\n\n38.\n\nOn August 12, 2013, Ecuador filed its Memorial on Annulment.\n\n39.\n\nOn September 30, 2013, the *ad hoc* Committee issued its *Decision on the Claimants' Request to Terminate the Stay of enforcement of the Award*. In its decision, the Committee ordered that the stay of enforcement be maintained for the time being unconditionally.\n\n40.\n\nOn October 18, 2013, the Claimants submitted their Counter-Memorial on Annulment; on January 6, 2014, Ecuador submitted its Reply on Annulment and on February 28, 2014, the Claimants submitted their Rejoinder on Annulment.\n\n41.\n\nA hearing on annulment was held at the World Bank's Offices in Paris, France from April 7 through April 10, 2014.\n\n42.\n\nOn August 1, 2014, the Claimants filed a request for modification of the Tribunal's decision of September 30, 2013 on the stay of enforcement. On August 28, 2014 Ecuador filed observations on the Claimants' request.\n\n43.\n\nOn September 23, 2014, the *ad hoc* Committee issued its Decision on the Claimants' request to modify its decision of September 30, 2013. The Committee decided to maintain the stay of enforcement of the Award.\n\n44.\n\nOn October 9, 2015, the Committee declared the proceedings closed, pursuant to Rule 38(1) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules.\n\n**III. GROUNDS FOR ANNULMENT IN THE CONVENTION**\n------------------------------------------------\n\n45.\n\nRespondent is invoking three grounds for annulment:\n\n- that the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers in violation of Article 52(1)(b) of the Convention,\n\n- that the Tribunal seriously departed from a fundamental rule of procedure in violation of Article 52 (1)(d) of the Convention, and/or\n\n- that it failed to state the reasons on which the Award is based in violation of Article 52(1)(e) of the Convention.\n\n46.\n\nThe Committee will briefly review these standards in light of the arguments presented by both parties.\n\n47.\n\nThe starting point of such analysis is Article 53(1) of the Convention, which explicitly states that the award \"shall not be subject to any appeal\". The award may only be subject to annulment if an *ad hoc* committee finds that one or more of the five grounds for annulment established in Article 52(1) apply. Awards can be annulled in their entirety \"or any part thereof\" [Article 52 (3)]. Committees, however, are not empowered to amend or replace such awards, nor to review the merits of the dispute. Factual findings and weighing of evidence made by tribunals are, as a general rule, outside the remit of *ad hoc* committees25. An exception could only be allowed if the applicant can prove that the errors of fact committed by the tribunal are egregious; in such case it is likely that the error causes the award to fall within one of the grounds for annulment listed in Article 52(1) of the Convention26.\n\n*Malicorp*, at 119.\n\n*Vivendi I,* at 251.\n\n**1. Manifest Excess of Powers**\n--------------------------------\n\n48.\n\nRespondent invokes as a first ground for annulment that by rendering the Award \"the Tribunal has manifestly exceeded its powers\" [Article 52(1)(b) of the Convention]. Excess of powers is a polysemic concept:\n\n- in its primary meaning it refers to situations where a tribunal adjudicates disputes not included in the powers granted by the parties;\n\n- but there is also a secondary sense: when a tribunal having jurisdiction adopts an erroneous decision that exceeds its powers.\n\nManifest Jurisdictional Excess of Powers\n----------------------------------------\n\n49.\n\nThe power of any arbitral tribunal derives from the authority vested upon it through the consent of the parties; if arbitrators address disputes not included in the powers granted to them, or decide issues not subject to their jurisdiction or not capable of being solved by arbitration, their decision cannot stand and must be set aside.\n\n50.\n\nExcess of powers can be committed both by overreach and by default. Awards can be annulled if tribunals:\n\n- assume powers to which they are not entitled, be it by way of a decision which is *ultra petita* or by an excess of jurisdiction,\n\n- do not use the powers that have been vested upon them by the parties; somewhat paradoxically, a manifest shortfall in the exercise of jurisdiction may also constitute a manifest excess of power27.\n\n*Vivendi I,* at 115; *Malaysian Historical Salvors*, at 80.\n\n51.\n\nJurisdictional excess of powers requires a finding that the tribunal has misconstrued the applicable law (e.g. the law regulating ownership of a protected investment) or has wrongly established the relevant facts (e.g. whether an investor actually controls an investment)28. Article 52(1)(b) of the Convention requires that the excess of jurisdiction resulting from such misconstruction or from such wrongful determination be \"manifest\"29; if that requirement is fulfilled, the tribunal's award deserves annulment.\n\nMayer, P., *To What Extent Can an Ad Hoc Committee Review the Factual Findings of an Arbitral Tribunal?*, in ANNULMENT OF ICSID AWARDS 245, (Emmanuel Galliard and Yas Banifatemi, eds.2004).\n\nCHRISTOPH SCHREUER, THE ICSID CONVENTION: A COMMENTARY 942-151 (2009) (2nd Ed): \"These decisions [ *Soufraki* and *Lucchetti* ] confirm that an excess of power on a matter of jurisdiction must be \"manifest\" if it is to warrant annulment\"; see also para. 56 *infra.*\n\nFailure to apply the proper Law to the Merits\n---------------------------------------------\n\n52.\n\n\"Excess of powers\" may exist not only in cases where tribunals wrongly assume jurisdiction, but also in the case of tribunals who, having jurisdiction, fail to choose the proper law with regard to the merits of the dispute.\n\n53.\n\nPowers vested on arbitrators are not unlimited, but restricted. Arbitrators are authorized by the parties to make their adjudication of the merits only in accordance with applicable law, not on the basis of a law different from that agreed by the parties or *ex aequo et bono*. If arbitrators do otherwise, they exceed the authority received from the parties and their decision merits annulment.\n\n54.\n\nAccepting this principle, *ad hoc* committees have concluded that arbitrators manifestly exceed their powers if they:\n\n- totally disregard the applicable law, or\n\n- ground their award on a law other than the applicable law provided for in Article 42 of the Convention, i.e. the rules of law agreed by the parties, or, subsidiarily, the law of the Contracting State party to the dispute and such rules of international law as may be applicable30.\n\n*Azurix (Annulment)* at 46 and 136; *CMS* at 49; *Lucchetti* at 98; *Soufraki* at 45; *Enron* at 67; *Helnan* at 55; *Sempra* at 205-207.\n\n55.\n\nFor an award to be annulled, the committee must find that the error made by the tribunal consisted in applying the wrong law to the merits, not of wrongly interpreting the correct law. To understand the contrary would imply transforming the well-settled standard of failure to apply the proper law into an error of law standard, changing the nature of the ICSID annulment procedure, and transforming it into an appeal mechanism with respect to the merits. Accepting this principle, *ad hoc* committees have made it clear that an error in the interpretation of the proper law does not constitute a manifest excess of powers31.\n\n*Azurix* at 137, *MCI* at 42, *Soufraki* at 85, *Sempra* at 161.\n\n56.\n\nMisinterpretation or misapplication of the proper law to be applied to the merits, even if serious, does not justify annulment. In exceptional circumstances, however, a gross or egregious error of law could be construed to amount to a failure to apply the proper law, and could give rise to the possibility of annulment32. But the threshold for applying this exceptional rule must be set very high33 - otherwise the annulment mechanism permitted by the Convention would expand into a prohibited appeal system on the merits34.\n\n*Soufraki* at 86; *Sempra* at 164, this is accepted by the Parties: R II at 70; C II at 17.\n\n*AES* at 33.\n\n*Caratube* at 81.\n\nThe Meaning of \"Manifest\"\n-------------------------\n\n57.\n\nArticle 52(1)(b) of the Convention only permits annulment if a dual requirement is met: the existence of an excess of powers, and that such excess of powers is \"manifest\" - a term which the Parties agree means \"perceived without difficulty\"35.\n\nR II at 75, C I at 326, C II at 19.\n\n58.\n\nThe Parties also agree that this important additional limitation applies both to a jurisdictional excess of powers and to a failure to apply the proper law36. This conclusion, shared by this Committee, has been confirmed by previous committees37.\n\nR II at 177, C I at 346 and C II at 27.\n\n*Duke Energy* at 98; *Soufraki* at 118, *Luchetti* at 100; *Azurix (Annulment)* at 68; *Enron* at 67; *Tza Yap Shum* at 79.\n\n59.\n\nThe above said, \"manifest\" does not prevent that in some cases an extensive argumentation and analysis may be required to prove that the misuse of powers has in fact occurred38.\n\n*V\u00edctor Pey Casado* at 70.\n\n**2. Serious Departure from a fundamental Rule of Procedure**\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n60.\n\nThe second ground for annulment invoked by Respondent is that the Tribunal engaged in a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure. If a tribunal violates due process, and deprives a party of its right to be heard on equal terms and to contradict the arguments of the other party, annulment of the award is justified; justice cannot be achieved through a deeply flawed procedure.\n\n61.\n\nSerious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure is frequently invoked by applicants, normally in conjunction with other grounds. But the hurdles for the acceptance of this ground are high: in only a few cases has it led to the annulment of ICSID awards39.\n\n*Amco II* ; *Fraport; V\u00edctor Pey Casado.*\n\n62.\n\nThe hurdles are reflected in the wording of Article 52(1)(d), which involves three requirements40:\n\n- The procedural rule must be fundamental, and only those essential to the integrity and fairness of the arbitral process qualify as such;\n\n- The tribunal must have departed from it;\n\n- And the departure must be serious, i.e. the violation must have produced a material impact on the award; the applicant however is not required to prove that the violation of the rule of procedure was decisive for the outcome, or that the applicant would have won the case if the rule had been applied41.\n\nR II at 100, C II at 40.\n\n*Wena*, at 61; *V\u00edctor Pey Casado,* at 78.\n\n**3. Failure to state Reasons**\n-------------------------------\n\n63.\n\nThe third ground for annulment on which Respondent relies is that the Award failed to state the reasons on which it is based, as required by Article 52(1)(e) of the Convention.\n\n64.\n\nThe obligation to state reasons stems from Article 48(3) of the Convention, which requires tribunals to \"deal with every question submitted to the Tribunal\" and to \"state the reasons upon which [the award] is based\". Unreasoned awards can be annulled, because parties should be able to ascertain to what extent a tribunal's findings are based on a correct interpretation of the law and on a proper evaluation of the facts42. But as long as reasons have been stated, even if incorrect, unconvincing or non-exhaustive43, the award cannot be annulled on this ground. Article 52(1)(e) does not permit any inquiry into the quality or persuasiveness of reasons. As was stated in *MINE*44,\n\n\"the requirement to state reasons is satisfied as long as the award enables one to follow how the tribunal proceeded from Point A to Point B, and eventually to its conclusion, even if it made an error of fact or of law\"45.\n\n*Lucchetti,* at 98.\n\n*Impregilo v. Argentina* at 181.\n\nAnd accepted by the Parties: R II at 112, 113; C I at 48, 51 and C II at 34.\n\n*MINE,* at 5.09.\n\n65.\n\nNonetheless, *ad hoc* committees have held that contradictory or frivolous reasons are to be equated with a failure to state reasons and can result in annulment46:\n\n- Contradictory reasons cancel each other and will not enable the reader to understand the tribunal's motives47;\n\n- Frivolous reasons are those manifestly irrelevant and known to be so to the tribunal48.\n\n*Amco II,* at 1.18.\n\n*Kl\u00f6ckner I,* at 116.\n\nBroches: \"Observations on the finality of ICSID awards\" in ICSID Review, 321 (1991), at 366.\n\n66.\n\nBut an examination of the reasons presented by a tribunal cannot be transformed into a re-examination of the correctness of the factual and legal premises on which the award is based. Committees do not have the power to review the adequacy of the reasons set forth by the tribunal in its award. Rather, the role of the committee is limited to analyzing whether a reader can understand how the tribunal arrived at its conclusion. Broadening the scope of Article 52(1)(e) to comprise decisions with inadequate reasons would transform the annulment proceeding into an appeal.\n\n67.\n\nSimilarly, the failure to address a particular argument raised by the Parties does not warrant annulment, unless it is decisive to the tribunal's decision (not *obiter dictum*)49. Contradictions, inconsistencies and unreasonable statements in the award can be cured applying the procedures set forth in Articles 49 and 50 of the Convention, which provide the parties with the opportunity to request that the tribunal address omissions, rectify material errors and clarify the interpretation of dubious points50.\n\nR II at 114; C II at 36.\n\n*Impregilo v. Argentina* at 214.\n\n**IV. GENERAL OUTLINE OF THE GROUNDS FOR ANNULMENT**\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n68.\n\nRespondent submits a total of 13 grounds for annulment51. The Committee will analyze these grounds in three different sections:\n\n- In **Chapter V** the Committee will address Respondent's grounds which allegedly lead to the annulment of the Decision on Jurisdiction and consequently would entail annulment of the Award *in toto*, for lack of jurisdiction; the Committee will reject these grounds and confirm the Tribunal's jurisdiction;\n\n- In **Chapter Vi** the Committee will analyze certain grounds for partial annulment invoked by Respondent, based on the argument that OEPC does not hold a 100% (but only a 60%) ownership interest in the expropriated investment52; the Committee will accept the first of these grounds, and order the partial annulment of the Award to the extent that the Tribunal assumed jurisdiction over an investment beneficially owned by the Chinese investor Andes, who is not protected under the Treaty;\n\n- **Chapter VII** will be devoted to additional grounds submitted by Ecuador, which if accepted would lead to annulment of the entire Award or of parts thereof53; the Committee will dismiss these grounds.\n\nSome of the grounds are divided into separate sub-division - see R I p. 83 - 218; Respondent has also submitted a different structure of grounds in R III p. 315.\n\nSee R III p. 317.\n\nSee R III p. 316.\n\n**V. THE DECISION ON JURISDICTION**\n-----------------------------------\n\n69.\n\nRespondent avers that the Tribunal's Decision on Jurisdiction must be annulled for four separate reasons. Three of the reasons are related to the Tribunal's decision to assume jurisdiction over Claimants' claims relating to *caducidad*, whilst the fourth refers to the Tribunal's decision to disregard the mandatory negotiation requirements of the Treaty. In particular, Respondent requests the annulment of the Decision on Jurisdiction:\n\n- Because the Tribunal rejected Ecuador's arbitrability objection, and it did so manifestly exceeding its powers and failing to state reasons (**1.**);\n\n- Because the Tribunal dismissed Ecuador's objection that OPC had no standing without stating any reasons and manifestly exceeding its powers (**2.**);\n\n- Because the Tribunal failed to state reasons for rejecting Ecuador's inadmissibility objection (**3.**); and\n\n- Because the Tribunal also failed to give effect to the mandatory negotiation requirement in Article VI.3 of the Treaty, manifestly exceeding its powers (**4.**)\n\n**1. The Arbitrability Objection**\n----------------------------------\n\n70.\n\nIn the course of the jurisdictional phase of the arbitration, Ecuador made two independent and separate jurisdictional objections related to *caducidad*54:\n\n- The \" **Jurisdictional Objection** \" based on the argument that certain clauses agreed upon in the Participation Contract excluded *caducidad* related matters from arbitration - an objection which (although rejected by the Tribunal) is not a subject matter of this annulment procedure55;\n\n- A second objection, introduced into the proceedings for the first time in the hearing on jurisdiction56, based on Article 196 of the Ecuadorian Constitution [\" **CE** \"], the so called \" **Arbitrability Objection** \", which is the object of this annulment ground.\n\nR II at 137.\n\nR II at 142.\n\nSee Decision on Jurisdiction at 82- 83.\n\n71.\n\nThe Arbitrability Objection submitted by the Republic was based on the following arguments57:\n\n- The CE is at the summit of the legal pyramid in Ecuador; as a matter of hierarchy of norms, the CE prevails over international treaties such as the BIT;\n\n- Article 196 CE attributes exclusive jurisdiction to the administrative tribunals of Ecuador to adjudicate any dispute concerning *actos administrativos* ;\n\n- The *Caducidad* Decree is an *acto administrativo* ;\n\n- In accordance with Article 196 CE any dispute concerning the *Caducidad* Decree must be submitted to the Ecuadorian administrative tribunals, and cannot be submitted to ICSID arbitration.\n\nR II at 133.\n\n72.\n\nEcuador's Arbitrability Objection was rejected by the Tribunal at paras. 86, 87 and 88 of its Decision on Jurisdiction:\n\n\"86. More fundamentally, the Respondent cannot invoke its domestic law for the purpose of avoiding ICSID jurisdiction under the Treaty. As noted earlier, by virtue of the Treaty, the Respondent expressly consented to the submission of disputes for settlement by binding arbitration under the Washington Convention, thereby establishing the basis for this Tribunal's jurisdiction in the present circumstances. The Respondent's Constitution, at Article 163, recognizes that international treaties duly ratified by the Republic of Ecuador shall prevail over any laws in Ecuador. This was confirmed at the Hearing by the Respondent's own legal expert on Ecuadorian law when he answered questions posed to him by counsel for the Claimants:\n\n\u00abQ. You agree with me that pursuant to Article 163 of the constitution, in case of conflict between those duly-ratified international Treaties, on the one hand, and the arbitration law on the other hand, the provisions of the duly-ratified international Treaties shall prevail; correct?\n\nA. Yes. That is so.\n\n[...]\n\nQ. Fair enough. A very simple assumption; if there was a duly-ratified Treaty that affirmatively granted jurisdiction to an Arbitral Tribunal, and the Ecuadorian arbitration law did not grant such jurisdiction because of a failure to meet certain requirements in that law, the Tribunal would still have jurisdiction pursuant to that Treaty; correct?\n\nA. In such a situation, if Ecuadorian law, as you referred to, is a law or a lower level regulation, that would be the case\u00bb.\n\n87. [...] In its closing argument, counsel for the Respondent also argued that the \"exclusive jurisdiction principle\" according to which *caducidad* decrees may only be challenged before the Ecuadorian administrative courts is enshrined in the Ecuadorian Constitution, and that the Constitution prevails over the Treaty: [quote omitted]\n\n88. The premise to this line of argument is based on a finding that the Participation Contract, be it Clause 22.2.1 or Clause 21.4, contains a clear and unequivocal waiver to ICSID jurisdiction. The Tribunal has found earlier in this Decision that no such waiver has been made under the Participation Contract. For all these reasons, the Respondent's first jurisdictional objection is accordingly denied\".\n\n**A. Respondent's Position**\n----------------------------\n\n73.\n\nThe Republic now argues that the Tribunal's decision to dismiss the Arbitrability Objection:\n\n- Failed to state reasons and left the Arbitrability Objection unanswered; or at least was addressed by the Tribunal in a contradictory fashion equivalent to a failure to state reasons;\n\n- Amounts to a manifest excess of powers, because it simply ignored Ecuador's argument that the CE prevails over the Treaty within the pyramid of the Ecuadorian legal order58.\n\nR II at 182.\n\n74.\n\nRespondent avers that the Decision should be annulled under Article 52(1)(b) and (e) of the Convention, for failure to state reasons and for manifest excess of powers, causing the subsequent nullity of the Award in its entirety59.\n\nR I at 282-283.\n\n**B. Claimants' Position**\n--------------------------\n\n75.\n\nClaimants disagree. In their opinion the Tribunal did not fail to state its reasons in dismissing Ecuador's Arbitrability Objection, because it referred to\n\n- the general principle that a State cannot rely on its domestic law to override its treaty obligations; and\n\n- Article 163 CE which provides that treaties prevail over any laws of Ecuador60.\n\nC I at 68; C II at 69\n\n76.\n\nFurthermore, the Tribunal correctly assumed jurisdiction and so did not exceed its powers at all, because Ecuador cannot invoke its domestic law (including the CE) to avoid ICSID jurisdiction and because Article 196 CE simply does not provide for the exclusive jurisdiction principle that Ecuador claims61.\n\nC II at 71, 72.\n\n**C. The Committee's Decision**\n-------------------------------\n\n77.\n\nThe Committee will first address the ground that the Tribunal failed to give reasons for its decision to dismiss the Arbitrability Objection, and then it will analyze whether the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers when it took such decision.\n\n78.\n\nArticles 161, 163 and 196 CE62 provide as follows:\n\nArt\u00edculo 161: La aprobaci\u00f3n de los tratados y convenios se har\u00e1 en un solo debate y con el voto conforme de la mayor\u00eda de los miembros del Congreso. Previamente, se solicitar\u00e1 el dictamen del Tribunal Constitucional respecto a la conformidad del tratado o convenio con la Constituci\u00f3n. La aprobaci\u00f3n de un tratado o convenio que exija una reforma constitucional no podr\u00e1 hacerse sin que antes se haya expedido dicha reforma.\n\nArt\u00edculo 163: Las normas contenidas en los tratados y convenios internacionales, una vez promulgados en el Registro Oficial, formar\u00e1n parte del ordenamiento jur\u00eddico de la Rep\u00fablica y prevalecer\u00e1n sobre leyes y otras normas de menor jerarqu\u00eda.\n\nArt\u00edculo 196: Los actos administrativos generados por cualquier autoridad de las otras funciones e instituciones del Estado, podr\u00e1n ser impugnados ante los correspondientes \u00f3rganos de la Funci\u00f3n Judicial en la forma que determina la ley.\n\nThe Award refers to the 1998 Constitution.\n\nFailure to state Reasons\n------------------------\n\n79.\n\nThe Arbitrability Objection - the argument that the CE requires that disputes affecting *actos administrativos* be submitted to administrative courts - was dismissed by the Tribunal; the reasoning for such dismissal is to be found at para. 80, where the Tribunal states:\n\n- That Ecuador has \"expressly consented to the submission of disputes for settlement by binding arbitration under the Washington Convention, thereby establishing the basis for this Tribunal's jurisdiction\";\n\n- That a State cannot \"invoke its domestic law for the purpose of avoiding ICSID jurisdiction under the Treaty\";\n\n- That the CE recognizes in its Article 163 that \"international treaties duly ratified by the Republic of Ecuador shall prevail over any laws in Ecuador\"; and\n\n- That Ecuador's own legal expert on Ecuadorian law confirmed this interpretation of Article 163 CE when examined at the hearing.\n\n80.\n\nThe Committee recalls that the requirement to state reasons is satisfied as long as the award enables one to follow how the tribunal proceeded from Point A to Point B, and eventually to its conclusion63.\n\n*MINE,* at 5.09; see para 64 *supra.*\n\n81.\n\nIn the present case, it is true that the reasons (contained in para. 86 of the Decision) precede the precise definition of the Arbitrability Objection (in para. 87). It is also true that in its reasoning, the Tribunal does not clearly differentiate between the Arbitrability Objection and the Jurisdictional Objection. But this lack of precision may be excused, because the Arbitrability Objection only became relevant in the course of the hearing, and in any case (as will be explained herein below) because it is without merit. Parties cannot expect that Tribunals devote extensive reasoning to arguments which, on their very face, cannot succeed.\n\nManifest Excess of Powers\n-------------------------\n\n82.\n\nRespondent also argues that the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers when it dismissed the Arbitrability Objection, because:\n\n- It ignored the argument that the CE prevails over the Treaty and, eventually,\n\n- It wrongfully assumed jurisdiction over claims related to *caducidad*.\n\n83.\n\nThe first argument is not true; the Tribunal did not ignore the argument put forward by Respondent that the CE prevails over the Treaty; the Tribunal rejected it, explaining that a State cannot rely on its own domestic law to avoid ICSID jurisdiction under the Treaty, and that Article 163 CE expressly provides that treaties prevail over domestic laws64.\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction at 86.\n\n84.\n\nThe second argument must be dismissed for total lack of merit: the Tribunal was right in dismissing the Arbitrability Objection and thus assuming jurisdiction with respect to claims related to *caducidad* - there is no manifest excess of powers. The Committee concurs with the Tribunal that the Republic:\n\n- Disregards the basic principle of international law that a State cannot invoke its domestic law, including its constitutional provisions, for the purpose of avoiding treaty obligations65;\n\n- Blatantly ignores the very CE, which in Article 163 pays tribute to this principle of international law, declaring that treaties form part of the Republic's internal legal order and prevail over municipal laws, and in Article 161, which creates a general presumption that all international treaties in force are in conformity with the Constitution;\n\n- Misconstrues the impact of Article 196 CE with regard to Ecuador's International Law obligations: Article 196 CE does not provide for the exclusive jurisdiction principle that Ecuador claims; the constitutional rule permits, but does not in any way mandate, recourse to administrative courts; to understand otherwise would lead to the conclusion that all *actos administrativos* are excluded from the scope of application of the BIT, and that the only acts which investment tribunals can review are *actos legislativos* and *actos judiciales*, adopted by the Ecuadorian legislative and judicial authorities - a conclusion so untenable that it disavows Respondent's argument.\n\nSee Articles 27 and 46 VCLT, ratified by Ecuador (without reservation to Article 27). It is clear from these international law principles, which codify existing customary international law on the subject, that Ecuador cannot invoke its domestic law for the purpose of avoiding ICSID jurisdiction under the US-Ecuador BIT. The same principle appplies even where constitutional provisions are relied upon (see the judgement of the PCIJ *Polish Nationals in Danzig,* p. 24: \"It should however be observed that [...] a State cannot adduce as against another State its own Constitution with a view to evading obligations incumbent upon it under international law or treaties in force\").  \n See also *IBM (Jurisdiction Decision)* at 72:  \n \"International treaties establish norms of conduct between and for the States, the mandatory character of which cannot be avoided, the more since current International Law has the tendency to have its norms to prevail even over the provisions of the Political Constitutions themselves. It appears as such in doctrine and constitutional texts, but also in jurisprudence on human rights and community law\".\n\n85.\n\nIn conclusion, Respondent's first ground for annulment, that the Tribunal failed to state reasons and manifestly exceeded its powers when it decided to assume jurisdiction over Claimants' claims relating to *caducidad,* is dismissed.\n\n**2. The Standing Objection**\n-----------------------------\n\n86.\n\nIn this arbitration OPC and OEPC are acting as Claimants - OPC being OEPC's parent company. Respondent filed an objection against OPC's participation (the \" **standing Objection** \").\n\n87.\n\nThe Standing Objection was submitted for the first time in Respondent's Reply on Jurisdiction66 (the \" **Reply on Jurisdiction** \"). Respondent argued that OPC's claims should be dismissed for four independent reasons67. The first reason was that \"OPC [had] failed to establish a basis for its standing as an investor\". This Standing Objection was developed in five paragraphs (90 - 94), in which the Republic raised two lines of reasoning:\n\nDoc. EEA 168.\n\nDoc. EEA 168 at 88.\n\n88.\n\nFirst, Respondent stated that68:\n\n\"90. [\u2026] OPC's mere claim to be the \u2018ultimate parent' of a US company that has an investment in Ecuador [\u2026] is not sufficient to establish that OPC is also an investor under the Treaty.\n\n91. To prove its investor status, OPC would have to demonstrate how exactly it controls OEPC in order to establish that its connection to OEPC is close enough not to reach the \u2018cut-off point beyond which claims would not be permissible as they would have only a remote connection to the affected company'. OPC failed to do so and thus failed to establish a basis for its standing as investor\". [Footnotes omitted].\n\nDoc. EEA 168 at 90-91.\n\n89.\n\nSecond, Respondent argued that since OPC's claims are factually and legally identical to OEPC's claims, they are not admissible in an arbitration where OEPC has appeared as a party and is asserting the same claims; investment tribunals have only granted standing to shareholders, where the shareholders were the true investors and the companies that were directly affected were mere local vehicles69.\n\nDoc. EEA 168 at 93, quoting *Goetz* at 89.\n\n90.\n\nThe Tribunal dismissed Respondent's arguments and confirmed its jurisdiction over OPC's claims in para. 89 of the Decision on Jurisdiction:\n\n\"89. It follows that the Tribunal has jurisdiction over the Claimants' claims under both the Participation Contract and the Treaty. For this reason, the Respondent's submission that Claimant OPC, the \u2018ultimate parent' of OEPC, lacks standing to assert claims as an investor in the circumstances because it is not a signatory to the Participation Contract is moot and need not be addressed as part of this Decision on Jurisdiction\".\n\n**A. Respondent's Position**\n----------------------------\n\n91.\n\nThe Republic complains that the Tribunal summarized Ecuador's position in a single paragraph and rejected the Standing Objection in two sentences, without addressing its arguments, giving rise to a failure to state reasons and to a manifest excess of powers70.\n\nR I at 286, 287; R II at 177.\n\n**B. Claimants' Position**\n--------------------------\n\n92.\n\nClaimants disagree.\n\n93.\n\nIt is Claimants' submission that it was in its Reply on Jurisdiction when the Republic for the first time raised the Standing Objection, and it only devoted six paragraphs to the argument and never disputed that OPC indirectly held a 100% stake in OEPC. The Tribunal dismissed Ecuador's objection by stating that OPC was the \"ultimate parent\" of OEPC. This reflected the Tribunal's understanding that OPC owned and controlled OEPC and had suffered an injury from the illegal expropriation of its Ecuadorian subsidiary71.\n\nC I at 85; C II at 79.\n\n94.\n\nClaimants add that there can be no excess of powers, because the Treaty expressly provides that \"investment\" means:\n\n\"every kind of investment in the territory of one Party owned or controlled directly or indirectly by nationals or companies of the other Party\".\n\nSince OPC is a company of the \"other Party\" and it indirectly owns and controls OEPC, the Tribunal had a tenable basis for finding that OEPC had standing72.\n\nC I at 361; C II at 88.\n\n**C. The Committee's Decision**\n-------------------------------\n\n95.\n\nThe Committee will first address the issue of failure to state reasons and then the manifest excess of powers argument.\n\nFailure to state Reasons\n------------------------\n\n96.\n\nAlthough the Standing Objection was addressed in the body of Respondent's Reply submission, in its prayer for relief there was no specific request that the Tribunal dismiss the claims from OPC for lack of standing. The only prayer for relief was a request for a \"declaration that the Tribunal has no jurisdiction over the Claimants' claims for the reasons given in Ecuador's objections to jurisdiction - but there was no subsidiary request that if the Tribunal admitted jurisdiction over OEPC's claims, it should in any case dismiss those from OPC because of the Standing Obj ection73.\n\nDoc. EEA 168 at 99; at 100 there is a different alternative request, which is not relevant for this discussion.\n\n97.\n\nWhen Article 52(1)(e) provides that the award can be annulled when it \"has failed to state the reasons on which it is based\", the rule is referring to the reasons used to support the award's dispositive section in accordance with the parties' relief. If there is no specific request for relief there is, thus, no need to give reasons.\n\n98.\n\nBut although there was no obligation to provide reasons, the Tribunal did address OPC's alleged lack of legal standing in para. 89 of the Decision, stating the following reasons for rejecting the proposition:\n\n- First, because the Tribunal had already found that it had jurisdiction under the Treaty, and consequently any argument that OPC lacked standing for failure to sign the Participation Contract was moot;\n\n- And second, because OPC was the \"ultimate parent\" of OEPC, a statement which reflected the Tribunal's understanding that OPC owned and controlled OEPC and was thus an investor under the Treaty.\n\n99.\n\nIn this second leg of the argument the Tribunal addressed, albeit in a very succinct manner, the first issue raised in the Standing Objection: whether OPC's control was too remote to warrant standing.\n\n100.\n\nThe Decision, however, does not seem to analyze Respondent's second supporting argument: that OPC lacked legal standing because it was replicating part of OEPC's treaty claims. Ecuador is now contending that this failure to address a second supporting argument amounts to a failure to state reasons, which should lead to annulment of the entire Award.\n\n101.\n\nThe Republic's contention cannot succeed, because it is settled law that a tribunal has no obligation to address each and every argument put forth by the parties74.\n\n*Azurix (Annulment)* at 240 *;* *Vivendi I* at 87.\n\nManifest Excess of Powers\n-------------------------\n\n102.\n\nRespondent's subsidiary argument that by (implicitly) dismissing its Standing Objection and accepting jurisdiction over OPC's claims, the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers must also be dismissed.\n\n103.\n\nArticle I.1.(a) of the Treaty provides that:\n\n\"investment' means every kind of investment in the territory of one Party owned or controlled directly or indirectly by nationals or companies of the other Party, such as equity, debt, and service and investment contracts\".\n\nThe Treaty thus extends its protections to any U.S. company which - either directly or indirectly - owns or controls an investment in the Republic of Ecuador.\n\n104.\n\nIt is a fact that OPC is the indirect owner of 100% of the shares in OEPC, and that both are U.S. corporations. There is a general presumption that a majority shareholder also controls the company, a presumption which can only be rebutted if there are special elements which create doubts about the owner's control75 - and Ecuador has pled no such special elements. There thus can be no question that OPC, a U.S. corporation, controls OEPC, and as such has standing to act as Claimant in the present arbitration. This being so, the Tribunal cannot have exceeded its powers by confirming OPC's status as Claimant and accepting jurisdiction to hear its claims.\n\n*Caratube,* at 271.\n\n105.\n\nSumming up, Respondent's second ground for annulment, that the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers and failed to state reasons when it failed to reject OPC's Standing Objection, is dismissed.\n\n**3. The Inadmissibility Objection**\n------------------------------------\n\n106.\n\nIn its Reply on Jurisdiction, Respondent raised a subsidiary argument: even if the Tribunal had jurisdiction over OEPC's treaty claims, those claims would be premature, because Claimants had made no attempt to challenge the *Caducidad* Decree before the Ecuadorian administrative courts (the \" **Inadmissibility Objection** \").\n\n107.\n\nThis argument was allegedly supported by a number of investment tribunals that had held that a treaty claim is premature, unless there has been a reasonable attempt by the investor either to pursue redress in the forum specified in the contract or otherwise petition local authorities to reverse the act of which the investor complains76. As a consequence, the Republic requested that, pending Claimants' action before the Ecuadorian courts, the arbitration be suspended77.\n\nDoc. EEA 168 at 80.\n\nR I at 289; R II at 164.\n\n**A. Respondent's Position**\n----------------------------\n\n108.\n\nAccording to Respondent, in its Decision on Jurisdiction the Tribunal rejected the Inadmissibility Objection in a single paragraph, which refers to \"the reasons set forth in this decision\", when in fact the Decision contains no reasons whatsoever in this regard78. This failure to state reasons is a ground for annulment.\n\nR I at 291.\n\n**B. Claimants' Position**\n--------------------------\n\n109.\n\nClaimants disagree. In their opinion, the Tribunal's reasoning can be followed from A to B and does not warrant annulment. The Inadmissibility Objection was raised belatedly and briefly in Ecuador's Reply on Jurisdiction and addressed by Ecuador for only a few minutes in two days of jurisdictional hearings79.\n\nC I at 93.\n\n110.\n\nThe Tribunal rejected it with sufficient reasons, such reasons being that Ecuador could not use its domestic law to evade its international law obligations, that Ecuador expressly consented to submission of disputes for settlement by binding arbitration under the Convention, that the Participation Contract did not waive Claimants' rights to pursue ICSID arbitration and that it would have served no purpose to pursue local remedies given that attempts to reach a negotiated solution were indeed futile80.\n\nC II at 94.\n\n**C. The Committee's Decision**\n-------------------------------\n\n111.\n\nThe Tribunal addressed Respondent's Inadmissibility Objection in the body and in the dispositive section of its Decision on Jurisdiction:\n\n\"96. Finally, it is recalled that the Respondent has requested, as part of its second jurisdictional objection, \u2018an order that this arbitration be stayed until OEPC challenges the *Caducidad* Decree in the competent Ecuadorian administrative court and that court issues a final ruling on such challenge'. This request is made on the basis of the allegation that the Claimants' claims are premature because the Claimants have made no attempt to challenge the *Caducidad* Decree before the Ecuadorian administrative courts. For the reasons set forth in this Decision on Jurisdiction, the Claimants were not required to do so, and this request is accordingly denied\".\n\n\"97. For the foregoing reasons, the Tribunal decides and declares as follows:... (iii) the Respondent's alternative request for \u2018an order that this arbitration be stayed until OEPC challenges the *Caducidad* Decree in the competent Ecuadorian administrative court and that court issues a final ruling on such challenge' is denied;.\"\n\n112.\n\nIt is clear from para. 96 that the Tribunal decided that Respondent's Inadmissibility Objection should be dismissed, because Claimants were not required to challenge the *Caducidad* Decree before the Ecuadorian Courts. The reasoning for this finding, however, is not specifically mentioned, and the Tribunal simply makes a general referral to \"the reasons set forth in this Decision on Jurisdiction\".\n\n113.\n\nIt is Respondent's contention that in the remaining parts of the Decision on Jurisdiction no explicit reasoning supporting the Tribunal's rejection of the Inadmissibility Objection can be found, and that this failure to state reasons should lead to an annulment of the Award.\n\n114.\n\nIn the Committee's opinion, the generic cross reference to the Decision *in toto* must be understood as a *renvoi* to para. 86 of the Decision, which conveys the implicit argument that if investment disputes have to be submitted to settlement by binding arbitration, such requirement precludes exhaustion of local remedies as a precondition.\n\n115.\n\nThe requirement that decisions be reasoned must be gauged in relation to the reasonableness and chance of success of the underlying proposition. In the present case, the Respondent's proposition that local remedies against the *Caducidad* Decree before the administrative courts of Ecuador must be exhausted, and that in the meantime the arbitration would have to be stayed, is unsupported either in the Treaty or in the Convention, does not lead to reasonable results and *ab initio* had a very low chance of success. As the *Helnan* Committee explained:\n\n\"it would empty the development of investment arbitration of much of its force and effect, if, despite a clear intention of States parties not to require the pursuit of local remedies as a pre-condition to arbitration, such a requirement were to be read back in as part of the substantive cause of action\"81.\n\n*Helnan* at 47.\n\n116.\n\nIn these circumstances, succinct and implied reasons - as those provided by the Tribunal - may be sufficient to defer annulment of the Award.\n\n117.\n\nThe Committee consequently comes to the conclusion that Respondent's third ground for annulment, that the Tribunal failed to state reasons when it rejected the Respondent's Inadmissibility Objection, should be dismissed.\n\n**4. The Negotiation Objection**\n--------------------------------\n\n118.\n\nThe *caducidad* administrative procedure started in 2004. In the course of a two year long period, OEPC was granted and exercised its right to be heard and the Ecuadorian administrative authorities debated whether the imposition of the sanction of *caducidad* against OEPC was appropriate. It is a fact, acknowledged in the very *Caducidad* Decree, that in the course of this procedure OEPC presented a settlement proposal, which was rejected by PetroEcuador82. On May 15, 2006 the *Caducidad* Decree was issued by Ecuador's Minister of Energy and Mines. Two days thereafter, on May 17, 2006, Claimants filed their request for arbitration (the \" **Request for Arbitration** \").\n\n*Caducidad* Decree at para. 15 *.*\n\n119.\n\nDuring the jurisdictional phase of the arbitration, Respondent submitted a jurisdictional objection (the \" **Negotiation Objection** \"), arguing that Claimants had failed to respect the six-month waiting period for the submission of the dispute to arbitration, mandated by Article VI.3 of the Treaty, which reads as follows:\n\n\"3. (a) Provided that the national or company concerned has not submitted the dispute for resolution under paragraph 2 (a) or (b) and that six months have elapsed from the date on which the dispute arose, the national or company concerned may choose to consent in writing to the submission of the dispute for settlement by binding arbitration: [Emphasis added].\n\n120.\n\nAccording to Respondent, this cooling-off period represents one of the jurisdictional requirements in the Treaty, and an investor's disregard of this rule deprives an arbitral tribunal of jurisdiction83.\n\nR II at 192.\n\nThe Tribunal's Decision\n-----------------------\n\n121.\n\nThe Tribunal dismissed the Negotiation Objection in its Decision on Jurisdiction. After summarizing the Parties' respective position in paras. 90 - 92, the Tribunal explained its decision in paras. 93 - 95:\n\n\"93. In this regard, the Tribunal recalls that the *caducidad* procedure at issue in this arbitration was in fact initiated in 2004. As noted earlier, for some 18 months or so prior to the issuance of the actual *Caducidad* Decree on 15 May 2006, OEPC made a number of submissions seeking to rebut the allegations on the basis of which the caducidad procedure was initiated, but to no avail.\n\n94. Furthermore, the Tribunal accepts, albeit without prejudging the merits, that attempts at reaching a negotiated solution were indeed futile in the circumstances.\n\n95. The Respondent's second jurisdictional objection is accordingly denied\". [Footnotes omitted].\n\n**A. Respondent's Position**\n----------------------------\n\n122.\n\nThe Republic states that the Tribunal found that the Article VI.3 requirement had been met for two reasons:\n\n- Because Claimants had indeed complied with the mandatory six month waiting period and\n\n- Because in any case negotiations between the two Parties would have been futile.\n\n123.\n\nIt is Respondent's contention that both findings are grossly incorrect84:\n\n- Claimants did not comply with the mandatory six month negotiation procedure, because the Tribunal calculated the time period from the beginning of the *caducidad* proceedings, when in fact it should have been calculated from the issuance of the *Caducidad* Decree - the date when the dispute actually arose; and Claimants filed the arbitration just two days thereafter, without any prior notice to the Republic85; previous tribunals have dismissed jurisdiction on this very ground86;\n\n- As regards futility, Ecuador argues that settlement discussion would not have been futile87 and that the Tribunal decided the contrary with almost no discussion and no acknowledgement of Claimants' burden to prove88.\n\nR I at 297.\n\nR I at 304, 305, 307; R II at 195.\n\nR II at 201.\n\nR I at 310.\n\nR I at 308, R II at 207.\n\n124.\n\nIn Ecuador's view, the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers by refusing to give effect to the mandatory negotiation requirements set out in Article VI.3 of the Treaty89.\n\nR I at 294.\n\n**B. Claimants' Position**\n--------------------------\n\n125.\n\nClaimants disagree.\n\n126.\n\nAs regards the futility argument, Claimants submit that the Tribunal cited extensive arbitral precedent proving that where negotiations are bound to be futile, there is no need for the waiting period to have fully lapsed. Ecuador is constrained to accept this legal premise; it only disputes the Tribunal's factual determination that the negotiations would have been futile - a question which falls outside the scope of review of an annulment Committee90.\n\nC I at 368.\n\n127.\n\nClaimants also submit that Ecuador's argument that a dispute only arose on the date of the *Caducidad* Decree, two days before Claimants filed this case at ICSID, is disingenuous. The dispute already existed in the course of the *caducidad* procedure91. In any case these factual findings are not within the purview of annulment committees92.\n\nC I at 373.\n\nC II at 103.\n\n**C. The Committee's Decision**\n-------------------------------\n\n128.\n\nRespondent argues that the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers when it assumed jurisdiction, without respecting the mandatory six-month negotiation requirement established in Article VI.3. of the Treaty and requests that the Award be annulled for this reason.\n\n129.\n\nThe Tribunal's decision is based on two arguments:\n\n- First, the Tribunal established that for some \"18 months or so\" prior to the *Caducidad* Decree OEPC had made a number of submissions seeking to rebut the allegations on the basis of which the *caducidad* procedure had been initiated; and\n\n- Second, the Tribunal found that in the circumstances any attempt at reaching a negotiated solution was futile; and in a footnote, the Tribunal referred to a number of decisions from investment tribunals, which had held that where negotiations are bound to be futile, there is no need for the waiting period to have fully lapsed93.\n\n*Lauder* at 187-191 *;* *Lesi* at 32(iv); *SGS* at 184; *Ethyl* at 84.\n\n130.\n\nThe Committee will examine the futility reason first\n\n131.\n\nThe Tribunal cited extensive arbitral precedent establishing that where negotiations are bound to be futile, there is no need for the waiting period to lapse before claimant is authorized to file the Request for Arbitration. Respondent does not contest that the Tribunal's legal argument is right. Respondent's reasoning is different: it submits that\n\n\"with almost no discussion of the issue and no acknowledgement of Claimants' burden to prove, the Tribunal simply concluded that attempts to reaching a negotiated solution were indeed futile\"94.\n\nR I at 308.\n\n132.\n\nIn the present case, the Tribunal, after reviewing and weighing the evidence, came to the conclusion that attempts at reaching a negotiated settlement were indeed futile, that the six-month waiting period mandated by Article VI.3. of the Treaty could be dispensed with, and that Respondent's Negotiation Objection should be dismissed. The Tribunal's factual determination seems reasonable, and the Tribunal's legal argument is settled law95.\n\n*Teinver*, at 126, 129; *Alemanni*, at 310, 317.\n\n133.\n\nThe Tribunal's dismissal of the Negotiation Objection, based on the argument that any further negotiation would be futile, must stand.\n\n134.\n\nGiven that the Tribunal correctly dismissed the Negotiation Objection on the basis of futility, the questions\n\n- whether OEPC had made a number of allegations in the course of the *caducidad* procedure,\n\n- whether these allegations were made before or after the dispute arose, and\n\n- whether these allegations provide an additional reason which supports the Tribunal's decision to dismiss the Negotiation Objection\n\nhave become moot and need not be addressed.\n\n135.\n\nSumming up, Respondent's fourth ground for annulment, that the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers when it rejected Respondent's Negotiation Objection, is dismissed.\n\n**VI. PARTIAL ANNULMENT FOR WRONGFUL ASSUMPTION OF JURISDICTION OVER 40% OF CLAIMANTS' INVESTMENT**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n136.\n\nHaving dismissed Respondent's request that the Decision on Jurisdiction be annulled, the Committee must now turn to the grounds for partial annulment of the Award invoked by Ecuador. These grounds revolve around the argument that the Tribunal has wrongly assumed jurisdiction over a 40% share of Claimants' investment, because that share now belongs to Andes, a Chinese investor not protected by the Treaty.\n\n137.\n\n*Pro memoria:* The execution of the Farmout Agreement between OEPC and AEC on October 1, 2000 (together with the Joint Operating Agreement) implied the transfer of a 40% ownership interest in the Block 15 investment from OEPC to AEC (who thereafter resold its interest to the Chinese company Andes). Since the parties failed to obtain the required authorization from the Ecuadorian Minister, the transfer eventually triggered Ecuador's declaration of *caducidad* of the Participation Contract.\n\n138.\n\nThe Tribunal found in the Award that Ecuador adopted this *caducidad* declaration in breach of Ecuadorian and customary international law, that the Caducidad Decree resulted in \"a measure tantamount to expropriation\" and that the Republic was required to pay damages to Claimants (albeit reduced by a factor of 25%, because OEPC had failed to secure the required ministerial authorization for the transfer of rights under the Farmout Agreement).\n\n139.\n\nThe grounds for partial annulment submitted by Respondent which will be analyzed in this Chapter address the following questions:\n\n- Did the Tribunal wrongly assume jurisdiction over the 40% investment in Block 15 now beneficially owned by the Chinese investor Andes (and previously by the Bermudan company AEC)?\n\n- As a consequence thereof, does the Tribunal's decision to order Ecuador to compensate OEPC for that 40% interest fall outside its jurisdiction?\n\nThe Award\n---------\n\n140.\n\nThe Tribunal was perfectly aware of the significance of these questions. It requested additional submissions from the Parties and held a hearing on this very topic. Having heard the Parties, the Tribunal was unable to reach a unanimous decision: the majority took one route and arbitrator Stern dissented.\n\n141.\n\nIn the Award the majority of the Tribunal accepted the approach of awarding 100% of the value of the investment: it found that since the assignment of rights from the Participation Contract had not been authorized by the Ecuadorian Minister, such assignment was \"null and void and has no validity whatsoever, and the Tribunal so finds\". The assignment \"must therefore be disregarded by the Tribunal for purposes of determining the compensation to which Claimants are entitled\"96. With the result that in the Tribunal's opinion, OEPC continued to own, as of the date of the *Caducidad* Decree, 100% of the rights under the Participation Agreement and had to be compensated for 100% of the value of Block 1597.\n\nAward at 650.\n\nAward at 651.\n\n142.\n\nArbitrator Stern strongly dissented.\n\n143.\n\nIn her opinion at the time of the *Caducidad* Decree the rights under the Participation Contract were owned 60% by OEPC and 40% by AEC98, and OEPC had been fully paid for the assignment of its 40% interest99. Prof. Stern then found that both under New York and under Ecuadorian law the Farmout Agreement, not having been invalidated either by a New York Court or an Ecuadorian Court, should have been considered as still in force and binding100 and that the ICSID Tribunal exceeded its powers in annulling AEC's rights thereunder101.\n\nDissent at 28.\n\nDissent at 33.\n\nDissent at 116.\n\nDissent at 132.\n\n144.\n\nArbitrator Stern added that title to AEC's 40% interest in Block 15 was split, the nominal legal title belonging to OEPC and the beneficial interest to AEC102. In accordance with international law, only the beneficial owner, AEC could claim compensation for expropriation103. Consequently, OEPC should only have received 60% of the total damages, in line with the *Chorz\u00f3w Factory* principle of full recovery104.\n\nNote introduced in the Spanish version of the Award to clarify the translation of \"nominal legal title\".\n\nDissent at 151.\n\nDissent at 158.\n\n145.\n\nProf. Stern concluded with the remark that there is no unfairness in Ecuador acquiring a 100% interest in Block 15, and being only obliged to compensate 60% of its value - this being purely the result of the limited jurisdiction of ICSID tribunals105.\n\nDissent at 166-167.\n\nEcuador's Request\n-----------------\n\n146.\n\nIn the present annulment procedure, Ecuador requests that the Award be partially annulled, to the extent that it compensates Claimants with any amount exceeding 60% of the value of Block 15106. The request is based on three separate grounds for annulment:\n\n- That the Tribunal wrongly assumed jurisdiction over AEC's investment, thus manifestly exceeding its powers;\n\n- That when the Tribunal assessed damages it failed to apply international law principles, and that this failure amounts to a manifest excess of powers; and\n\n- That the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers and failed to state reasons for declaring inexistent the assignment of rights between Claimants and AEC.\n\nR III p. 317.\n\n147.\n\nThe Committee will approach this request by\n\n- First summarizing the Tribunal's findings (**1.**),\n\n- Then summarizing Respondent's and Claimants' positions (**2.** and **3.**),\n\n- And thereafter explaining its own decision (**4.**)\n\n**1. The Award**\n----------------\n\n148.\n\nThe Tribunal devoted a whole section107 of the Award to the issue of whether Claimants are entitled to 100% or only to 60% of the value of Block 15. The analysis starts with paras 613 and 614, which frame the question:\n\n\"613. The Tribunal will now deal with the central issue which, in its view, after the parties' arguments have been stripped of their complex legal ramifications, comes down to the following: does the execution by OEPC of the Farmout Agreement with AEC on 1 October 2000 (together with the Joint Operating Agreement) allow Ecuador, following *caducidad*, to compensate OEPC for 60% only of its interest in Block 15 or is it legally obliged to compensate OEPC for 100% of its interest in Block 15, being precisely what it has acquired upon the issuance of the *Caducidad* Decree?\n\n614. In other words, the key issue to be addressed in this section is whether any assignment to AEC of the 40% beneficial interest in Block 15 was actually effected by the Farmout Agreements (i.e., the Farmout Agreement and the Joint Operating Agreement) or whether any such purported assignment was void and therefore without legal effect. If the former, OEPC would be entitled to recover 100% of the established value of Block 15 under the relevant principles of international law; if the latter, it could recover 60% only\". [Footnote omitted].\n\nSection E.4 in the chapter on quantum, paras. 612-658.\n\n149.\n\nSince the Farmout agreement is subject to New York law, the Tribunal then analysed whether a valid assignment of an equitable interest had taken place, both under Ecuadorian and New York law108.\n\nAward at 616.\n\nEcuadorian Law\n--------------\n\n150.\n\nThe Tribunal first recalled Clause 16.1 of the Participation Contract and Article 79 of the *Ley de Hidrocarburos* (\" **HCL** \"):\n\n\"16.1. La transferencia de este Contrato de Participaci\u00f3n o la cesi\u00f3n a terceros de los derechos provenientes del mismo deber\u00e1n ser autorizados por el Ministro del Ramo de conformidad con las leyes y reglamentos vigentes; de manera especial se cumplir\u00e1n las disposiciones previstas en el art\u00edculo 79 de la Ley de Hidrocarburos y en los Decretos Ejecutivos Nos. 809, 2713 y 1179\".\n\n\"Art. 79: La transferencia de un contrato o la cesi\u00f3n a terceros de derechos provenientes de un contrato, ser\u00e1n nulas y no tendr\u00e1n valor alguno si no procede autorizaci\u00f3n del Ministerio del Ramo, sin perjuicio de la declaraci\u00f3n de caducidad seg\u00fan lo previsto en la presente ley\".\n\n151.\n\nApplying Article 79 HCL the Tribunal came to the following conclusions:\n\n- The purported assignment had no legal effect \"and OEPC retained 100% of both the legal and beneficial ownership of all rights in the Participation Contract\"109;\n\n- The invalidity of any purported assignment did not affect the right of the State to declare *caducidad*110.\n\nAward at 619.\n\nAward at 619 bis.\n\n152.\n\nAfter having reached these conclusions, the Tribunal analysed and rejected Respondent's counter-arguments:\n\nThe Requirement of Judicial Declaration of Nullity\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n153.\n\nThe first counter-argument submitted by Respondent was that the assignment created an \"absolute nullity\" which required a judicial declaration111.\n\nAward at 620.\n\n154.\n\nThe Tribunal disagreed. In its opinion112\n\n\"622. Although not expressly stated in the Ecuadorian Civil Code, the Ecuadorian Supreme Court has confirmed on a number of occasions that Ecuadorian law recognizes automatic nullity or inexistence\".\n\nAward at 622.\n\n155.\n\nThe Tribunal then referred to four cases in which the Supreme Court of Ecuador had differentiated between the categories of inexistence, absolute nullity and relative nullity and concluded that the113\n\n\"626. [\u2026] intended assignment that occurred under the Farmout Agreement and the Joint Operating Agreement undoubtedly meets the criteria [\u2026] for inexistence\"\n\nThe Tribunal continued114:\n\n\"626. [\u2026] Where the law itself stipulates that an act has \"no validity whatsoever\" there is no need on its face for the assignment to be declared invalid by a judge, because it could never be valid in the first place - it lacked an essential element required for life\".\n\nAnd then explained115:\n\n\"628. As noted above, Article 79 of the HCL is categorical in expressing, not only the illegal act, but also the consequence of the illegality. Significantly, a similar provision (Article 1745 of the [1970] Civil Code [Article 1718 of the 2005 Civil Code]) was being applied by the Supreme Court in the above case (and in others discussed below). Article 1745 [1718] provides that, where the law requires a public deed, contracts signed in another form \"will be deemed as non-executed or signed\". Thus, the consequence of the illegality is specified. The result of the Court's decision that such contracts are \"inexistent\" is that Article 1745 [1718] is given effect without the need for a judicial declaration. In other words, where the law itself clearly states that the contract is deemed to be unexecuted, and therefore has no life, there is no requirement for judicial confirmation. Similarly, under Article 79 [HCL], the law itself has deemed that an unauthorised assignment has no validity whatsoever, and therefore has no life. The logical consequence of this provision is that no further action is required to invalidate an unauthorised assignment\".\n\nAward at 626.\n\nAward at 626.\n\nAward at 628.\n\nNew York Law\n------------\n\n156.\n\nThe Tribunal then analysed the issue under New York law and concluded that New York law results in exactly the same conclusion as Ecuadorian law: where the governing law of the assignment is a foreign law, New York courts apply the governing law of the contract containing the non-assignment clause, when interpreting that clause. As clause 7.02 of the Farmout Agreement states that mandatory Ecuadorian laws governing the Participation Contract apply, New York courts would give effect to such laws, including the HCL116.\n\nAward at 646, 647.\n\nFindings\n--------\n\n157.\n\nIn para. 650 the Tribunal came to its main finding:\n\n\"650. It follows that, pursuant to New York and Ecuadorian law, the purported assignment by OEPC to AEC of rights under the Participation Contract pursuant to the Farmout Agreement and the Joint Operating Agreement is null and void and has no validity whatsoever and the Tribunal so finds. Under the doctrine of inexistence and under New York law, there is no requirement that the Court must first declare the assignment to be invalid\"117.\n\nThe Tribunal then added:\n\n\"650. [\u2026] As such, the purported assignment of rights under the Farmout Agreement and the Joint Operating Agreement was not valid and produced no legal effect. It must therefore be disregarded by the Tribunal for purposes of determining the compensation to which the Claimants are entitled. Consequently, the Tribunal finds that OEPC continued to own, as of the date of the Caducidad Decree, 100% of the rights under the Participation Contract\"118.[Footnote ommitted].\n\nWith the following result:\n\n\"651. The Tribunal accordingly concludes that the Respondent is obliged to compensate the Claimants for 100% of their interest in Block 15 which it acquired upon the issuance of the *Caducidad* Decree\"119.\n\nAward at 650.\n\nAward at 650.\n\nAward at 651.\n\nThe Severance Issue\n-------------------\n\n158.\n\nAlthough the Tribunal found that the assignment of rights as between OEPC and AEC was inexistent, at the same time it concluded that \"the Farmout Agreement itself remains a valid contract between OEPC and AEC\", because Article 79 HCL is concerned with the legal effect of the assignment itself and does not invalidate the Farmout Agreement or the Joint Operating Agreement120. This idea, that it is possible to sever the assignment of rights, which is null, and the Farmout Agreement, which remains valid, is further developed in para. 635:\n\n\"635. [...] For the avoidance of doubt, as noted above, the Tribunal reiterates that in the present case it is the validity of the assignment that is under scrutiny, and not the validity of the Farmout Agreement or the Joint Operating Agreement. The Tribunal's findings on the validity of the assignment do not affect other obligations that might arise between the parties to the Farmout Agreement and the Joint Operating Agreement (such parties being different to [ *sic* ] those in the present arbitration), nor does it affect the ability of AEC to seek damages from OEPC for a failure to comply with the terms of those Agreements, such as obtaining necessary government consent for the assignment\". [Footnote omitted].\n\nAward at 619; 619 *bis*.\n\n159.\n\nThe idea that the transaction effected between OEPC and AEC can be severed in two parts,\n\n- the assignment of rights, which is automatically null and inexistent,\n\n- and the rest of the Farmout and Joint Operating Agreements, which remains valid,\n\nis one of the most disputed and obscure conclusions of the Award. The issue was the subject of extensive debate in the course of the annulment hearing, with the Parties holding opposite interpretations121.\n\nHT p. 894 - 931.\n\nThree additional Arguments of Respondent\n----------------------------------------\n\n160.\n\nIn the final part of its analysis, the Tribunal dismissed three additional arguments submitted by Respondent:\n\n161.\n\n(i) The first argument was unjust enrichment. The Tribunal stated as follows122: \"654. [...] the Tribunal notes that the invalidity of the assignment under New York and Ecuadorian law does not mean that AEC (or Andes) may not have recourse against OEPC under the Farmout Agreement. As mentioned earlier, the unauthorised assignment does not invalidate the Farmout Agreement as between the assignor, OEPC and the assignee, AEC nor is the legal position affected by the fact that the assignor and the assignee actually implemented *inter se* parts of the legally invalid and unauthorised assignment. OEPC promised to deliver certain rights to AEC under the Farmout Agreement, but due to its failure to secure authorisation from the Ministry it was in breach of that promise. This breach of contract may form the basis of a claim by AEC (or Andes) against OEPC. These factors weigh heavily against any unjust enrichment arguments raised in respect to OEPC's entitlement to receive compensation for 100% of the interests in the Participation Contract\".\n\nAward at 654.\n\n162.\n\n(ii) The second argument related to the *Chorz\u00f3w Factory* dictum, which reads as follows123:\n\n\"This principle. has the effect, on the one hand, of excluding from the damage to be estimated, injury resulting for third parties from the unlawful act and, on the other hand, of not excluding from the damage the amount of debts and other obligations for which the injured party is responsible. The damage suffered by the Oberschlesische in respect of the Chorzow undertaking is therefore equivalent to the total value\u2014but to that total only\u2014of the property, rights and interests of this Company in that undertaking, without deducting liabilities \". [Emphasis added].\n\n*Chorz\u00f3w Factory*, p. 31.\n\n163.\n\nThe Tribunal found124 :\n\n\"656. As a matter of international law, any liability that OEPC might have to AEC or Andes under various other agreements (including the Farmout Agreement) does not affect the Claimants' right to receive compensation from Ecuador. Ecuador cannot discount OEPC's claim by reference to liabilities that may be owed to third parties such as AEC. This principle is clearly recognised in the *Chorz\u00f3w Factory* dictum.\".\n\nAward at 656.\n\n164.\n\n(iii) The third argument is twofold:\n\n- that the Claimants allegedly lacked standing to claim damages beyond their \"remaining\" 60% interest in Block 15; and\n\n- that no willing buyer would pay a price based on 100% of the value of Block 15, since OEPC only owns a 60% interest.\n\n165.\n\nThe Tribunal dismissed this argument with the following reasoning125:\n\n\"658. [\u2026] In view of the Tribunal's conclusion in relation to the invalidity of the assignment as set out above, this objection of the Respondent has become moot\".\n\nAward at 658.\n\n**2. Respondent's Position**\n----------------------------\n\n166.\n\nRespondent avers that the Tribunal should have granted Claimants damages equivalent to 60% of the value of Block 15, and that its decision to calculate the damages as 100% of such value should be annulled, leading to a partial annulment of the Award. Respondent invokes three separate grounds for annulment126:\n\n- First, that the Tribunal exercised *ratione personae* jurisdiction over a Chinese company, Andes, without any entitlement arising out of the Treaty or the Participation Contract, thus manifestly exceeding its powers (**A.**);\n\n- Second, that the Tribunal failed to apply the applicable rules of international law on damages, incurring in a manifest excess of powers (**B.**); and\n\n- Third, that the Tribunal acted with manifest excess of powers and failed to state reasons in reaching the conclusion that the assignment of the Farmout Agreement would be inexistent under Ecuadorian law (**C.**)\n\nR I sections 13-14; R II sections 11-12.\n\n**A. The Exercise of** ***ratione personae*** **Jurisdiction over Andes**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n167.\n\nRespondent argues that there is an excess of powers if a tribunal exercises jurisdiction over a company which is not a party to the arbitration agreement and is not an investor protected by the applicable BIT127.\n\nR I at 532.\n\n168.\n\nIt is undisputed that the Treaty does not protect Chinese nationals. The ICSID arbitration clause contained in the Participation Contract only benefits the parties to such Contract - and Andes does not qualify as such128.\n\nR I at 535.\n\n169.\n\nThe Tribunal, by deciding that Claimants are entitled to damages amounting to 100% of the value of Block 15, took three decisions which affected Andes without having jurisdiction over it129:\n\n- First, it nullified the Farmout Agreement without Andes being a party to this arbitration;\n\n- Second, by granting Claimants damages equivalent to 100% of the value of Block 15, it effectively granted Andes 40% of that sum (if Claimants comply with the 2006 Letter Agreement and transfer to Andes 40% of whatever proceeds they obtain);\n\n- Third, the Tribunal expropriated Andes of its investment of 40% of Block 15 if, contrary to the preceding scenario, Claimants decide not to transfer to Andes 40% of the proceeds of the underlying arbitration.\n\nR I at 536-539.\n\n**B. Failure to apply the proper Rules of International Law on Damages**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n170.\n\nRespondent submits that the Tribunal also manifestly exceeded its powers when it failed to apply the proper principles of international law relating to the assessment of damages130. The Tribunal specifically failed to apply the following rules and principles:\n\n- The willing buyer/willing seller international law standard131;\n\n- The *Chorz\u00f3w Factory* dictum132;\n\n- The international law rule prohibiting unjust enrichment133.\n\nR I at 547.\n\nR I at 549-557; R II at 442-457.\n\nR I at 558-570; R II at 458-476.\n\nR I at 571-578; R II at 477-493.\n\n**C. The Inexistence of the Assignment of the Farmout Agreement**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n171.\n\nRespondent finally argues that if one assumes - as the Tribunal has concluded -that Ecuador had committed an unlawful expropriation, Claimants would only be entitled to claim the value of their investment, i.e. their 60% ownership stake in Block 15 (minus their contributory fault). By finding the assignment to be inexistent, however, the Tribunal allowed Claimants to recover the value of their investment and the value of AEC's 40% stake in Block 15. This finding should be annulled for manifest excess of powers and for resting the decision on insufficient, frivolous and contradictory reasons134:\n\nR I at 584.\n\n172.\n\n(i) The excess of powers derives from the fact that the Tribunal actually invented a set of rules for awarding Claimants damages far greater than the loss they sustained135 and cherry picked one provision of the HCL, disregarding all the other provisions of the law136.\n\nR I at 591-646; R II at 510-560.\n\nR I at 647-655; R II at 561-566.\n\n173.\n\nThere is a second reason why the Tribunal committed an excess of powers: it is a general principle of law that the nullity or inexistence of a contract may be declared if, and only if, all the parties to the contract are parties to the judicial process. Given that AEC was not a party to the underlying arbitration, the majority lacked the authority to declare the Farmout Agreements without validity137. Even admitting (*quod non*) that the assignment could be severable from the Farmout Agreements, Ecuador is at a loss to understand how a claim for the nullity of the assignment could be admissible when the parties to the assignment are not the parties to the judicial proceedings138.\n\nR I at 661.\n\nR II at 576.\n\n174.\n\n(ii) The failure to state reasons should also lead to annulment, because the majority's determination rests on a combination of frivolous, scarce and contradictory reasons139.\n\nR I at 677-709, R II at 583-640.\n\n**3. Claimants' Position**\n--------------------------\n\n175.\n\nClaimants disagree with Respondent's arguments. In their opinion, Respondent distorts the Award. The Tribunal only found that the Claimants purported to effect a transfer of rights under the Participation Contract, and then declared the transfer to be inexistent, while expressly affirming the validity of the Farmout Agreement140.\n\nC I at 444.\n\n**A. The Exercise of** ***ratione personae*** **Jurisdiction over Andes**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n176.\n\nClaimants aver that the Tribunal did not manifestly exceed its powers by improperly exercising jurisdiction *ratione materiae* over the Chinese company Andes, because the Tribunal did not award Andes any damages. The majority simply awarded Claimants the value of their investment, which was 100% of the rights under the Participation Contract. As a matter of international law, the Tribunal had to award Claimants damages reflecting 100% of their investment; it was not entitled to deduct Claimants' liabilities - as reflected in the *Chorz\u00f3w Factory* dictum141.\n\nC I at 480; C II at 281.\n\n177.\n\nRespondent's argument that the Tribunal had expropriated Andes' rights is wrong, because those rights are unaffected by the Award; the Tribunal expressly affirmed the validity of the Farmout Agreement142.\n\nC I at 482.\n\n**B. Failure to apply the proper Rules of International Law on Damages**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n178.\n\nClaimants argue that the Tribunal did not manifestly exceed its powers by failing to apply the proper law in determining the value of Claimants' investments143, because\n\n- It applied the willing buyer/willing seller standard144;\n\n- It applied the *Chorz\u00f3w Factory* dictum145, and\n\n- The international law rule prohibiting unjust enrichment146\n\nC I at 445-448.\n\nC I at 449-454; C II at 267-270.\n\nC I at 455-462; C II at 271-275.\n\nC I at 463-474; C II at 276-280.\n\n**C. The Inexistence of the Assignment of the Farmout Agreement**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n179.\n\n(i) Claimants aver that the Tribunal did not manifestly exceed its powers by failing to apply the proper law when it found that the purported assignment by OEPC to AEC was inexistent and thus had no legal effects. The Tribunal found that\n\n- Ecuadorian law recognizes the concept of inexistence;\n\n- Following the clear wording of Article 79 of the HCL the assignment was inexistent rather than an absolute nullity147;\n\n- An inexistent act does not need to be invalidated; and\n\n- Even if it were an absolute nullity, pending the judicial declaration the assignment still had no legal effect148.\n\nC I at 497-505.\n\nC I at 226.\n\n180.\n\nClaimants aver that even if Ecuador's arguments were correct *(quod non),* they would only amount to a mere error.\n\n181.\n\nFinally, Claimants submit that Ecuador is understandably at pains to retreat from its previous admissions. The Tribunal noted149 that its conclusions regarding inexistence of the assignment had previously been fully endorsed by Ecuador and its legal experts150. In Claimants' opinion, the fact that Ecuador originally held the contrary position proves that the Tribunal's position at least is reasonable - thus making annulment for gross error of law unavailable151.\n\nAward at 636-644.\n\nC I at 223.\n\nC II at 254.\n\n182.\n\nClaimants also recall that the Tribunal did not declare that the Farmout Agreement or Joint Operating Agreement was invalid - only the transfer of certain rights152.\n\nC I at 512.\n\n183.\n\n(ii) The Tribunal's reasoning can be followed from point A to point B and so does not warrant annulment153:\n\n- Article 79 HCL states that any unauthorized transfer of rights under the Participation Contract shall \"be null and void and shall have no validity whatsoever\"; consequently the purported assignment of rights was invalid;\n\n- The Ecuadorian Supreme Court has confirmed on a number of occasions that Ecuadorian law recognizes automatic nullity or inexistence;\n\n- No further action is required to invalidate an unauthorized assignment.\n\nC II at 227.\n\n184.\n\nEcuador's efforts to manufacture a contradiction between the Tribunal's findings is unavailing, as is Ecuador's claim that the Tribunal's decision rests on frivolous and contradictory reasons154.\n\nC II at 231,239.\n\n**4. The Committee's Decision**\n-------------------------------\n\n185.\n\nThe Committee must decide whether the majority of the Tribunal fell into any of the grounds for annulment advanced by Ecuador, when, against the vocal dissent of one of its members, it assumed jurisdiction with regard to 100% of Block 15, without taking into consideration that the Claimant, OEPC, had transferred 40% of its interest to a third party, initially the Bermudan company AEC, which thereafter sold it to the Chinese company Andes. And, if it comes to the conclusion that the Tribunal indeed wrongly assumed jurisdiction, the Committee must then decide whether this excess of powers merits annulment under the strict requirements imposed by Article 52 of the Convention.\n\n186.\n\nThe extent and scope of Claimants' investments is more than a purely legal issue, relevant only for the calculation of damages in this case. It has wider repercussions, touching on the natural tension between general principles of equality and equity vis-\u00e0-vis the jurisdictional scope of ICSID arbitration. This tension is inbuilt in a legal system which only protects investments held by investors of a certain nationality, covered by a specific BIT, but denies protection to other investors, including domestic investors155.\n\nAs Arbitrator Stern noted in the concluding remark of her dissent there is an underlying tension between fairness and equity and the scope of jurisdiction of investment tribunals; Dissent at 166, 167\n\n187.\n\nThrough the expropriation of the Participation Contract, Ecuador acquired a 100% interest in Block 15; fairness would seem to require that it indemnify 100% of the value of such asset. And the Tribunal, when it decided to calculate damages on 100% of the investment, was undoubtedly guided by a purpose of delivering a fair and equitable solution156.\n\nThis idea can be fathomed from the last line of para. 613, quoted at para. 148 *supra.*\n\n188.\n\nBut viewed from the angle of OEPC, its damage seems to be limited to 60% of the value of the Block, because ownership over the remaining 40% had been transferred to a third party (AEC, a company which is not a party to the arbitration, and which is not protected by the US - Ecuador BIT), which duly paid to OEPC the agreed consideration and which finally resold the participation to Andes.\n\n189.\n\nTo comply with its duty of adjudicating Respondent's request for annulment, the Committee will:\n\n- As a first step, review in some detail the underlying facts and the applicable law (**A.**);\n\n- As a second step, it will analyse Respondent's ground for annulment that the Tribunal exceeded its powers, and will come to the conclusion that by assuming jurisdiction over the investment now beneficially owned by the Chinese investor Andes the Tribunal indeed committed a manifest excess of jurisdiction (**B.**).\n\n**A. Underlying Facts and Applicable Law**\n------------------------------------------\n\n**a. The Participation Contract**\n---------------------------------\n\n190.\n\nIn 1999 PetroEcuador and OEPC signed the Participation Contract, which expressly stated that it was to be governed by Ecuadorian law157. The parties agreed that OEPC, in return for accepting the obligation to explore, develop and exploit Block 15, and being responsible for all associated expenditures, was to receive a share of the oil produced, the balance corresponding to Ecuador.\n\nParticipation Contract Clause 22.1.\n\n191.\n\nThe transfer of the Participation Contract and the assignment to third parties of rights arising thereunder was regulated in clause 16.1.:\n\n\"La transferencia de este Contrato de Participaci\u00f3n o la cesi\u00f3n a terceros de derechos provenientes del mismo deber\u00e1n ser autorizados por el Ministro del Ramo, de conformidad con las leyes y reglamentos vigentes: de manera especial se cumplir\u00e1n las disposiciones previstas en el art\u00edculo 79 de la Ley de Hidrocarburos y en los Decretos Ejecutivos Nos. 809, 2713 y 1179\".\n\n192.\n\nClause 16.1. clearly established that both the transfer of the Contract (i.e. the transfer of the bundle of rights and obligations corresponding to OEPC) and the assignment of any right (without obligations) required authorization from the Minister.\n\n193.\n\nThe Participation Contract also provided that the transfer of rights or obligations without authorization of the Minister could result in its termination:\n\n\"21.1. Terminaci\u00f3n: Este Contrato de Participaci\u00f3n terminar\u00e1:\n\n[...]\n\n21.1.2. Por transferir derechos y obligaciones del Contrato de Participaci\u00f3n, sin autorizaci\u00f3n del Ministerio del Ramo\".\n\n**b. The Farmout Agreements**\n-----------------------------\n\n194.\n\nIn October 2000 OEPC and City Investing Company Limited (\" **AEC** \"), a Bermuda company, executed the Farmout Agreements (consisting of the Farmout Agreement and the Joint Operating Agreements), which were subject to New York law. The purpose of the Farmout Agreements was to transfer from OEPC to AEC the ownership of a 40% interest in the rights and obligations deriving from the so called \" **Farmout Property** \" (a wide concept which included the \" **Participating Agreements** \", one of which was the Participation Contract). This transfer of ownership was to be executed in two phases:\n\n- In the first phase OEPC would hold legal title to AEC's 40% interest in the Farmout Property \"as a \u2018nominee'\", acting \"on behalf of AEC\", OEPC being obligated, \"at the sole risk, cost and expense\" of AEC to act with respect to the 40% Farmout Interest of AEC as AEC shall direct, \"as if AEC were a party\" to the Participation Contract \"owning legal title to a 40% interest\" in such Contract and in Block 15158;\n\n- In the second phase -which never came into force - OEPC would transfer to AEC the legal title for AEC's 40% participation in the Farmout Property.\n\nFarmout Agreement Clause 2.01.\n\n195.\n\nHaving signed the Farmout Agreements, AEC paid approximately US$ 180 million to OEPC as consideration for the acquisition of its 40% Farmout Property, the amount being equivalent to 40% of the expenditure so far. In compliance with the obligations assumed in the Farmout Agreements, thereafter AEC regularly paid to OEPC 40% of the expenditures incurred in the exploitation and development of Block 15, and received 40% of the oil produced.\n\n196.\n\nWhat were the legal consequences of the Farmout Agreement?\n\n197.\n\nIn accordance with the agreed terms, the execution of the Farmout Agreements resulted in OEPC transferring to AEC ownership of a 40% interest in the Farmout Property. And clause 1.01 of the Farmout Agreement defined Farmout Property to include (*inter alia*) the following:\n\n\"(a) the Participating Agreements [which include the Participation Contract] and the rights and obligations therein granted to OEPC in and with respect to Block 15 and the related obligations of OEPC [...] accruing after the Effective Date herunder;\n\n(b) All wells, equipment, ancillary pipelines, facilities and personal property situated in Block 15 at the Effective Time and owned or granted to and held by OEPC [...]\"[Emphasis added].\n\n198.\n\nThe definition of Farmout Property leaves no room for doubt that, as regards the Participation Contract, what OEPC was transferring to AEC was the ownership of a 40% interest in the complete bundle of \"rights and obligations\" which formed OEPC's legal position under that Contract - and not simply certain rights deriving therefrom.\n\n199.\n\nA second element is important: the purpose of the Farmout Agreements was the transfer of \"ownership\" over the Farmout Property, including OEPC's legal position under the Participation Contract. This conclusion is supported by clause 3.3.1 of the Joint Operating Agreement, which reads as follows:\n\n\"Unless otherwise provided in this Agreement, all the rights and interests in and under the Participating Agreements, all Joint Property and any Petroleum produced from the Agreement Area shall, subject to the terms of the Participating Agreement, be owned by the Parties in accordance with their respective Participating Interests\" [emphasis added].\n\n200.\n\nIt is important to note that the conclusion that the Farmout Agreements caused the transfer of ownership of a 40% interest in OEPC's rights and obligations under the Participation Contract is shared by the Tribunal - at least in its initial analysis159:\n\n\"303. [...] Again, this language explicitly evidences that the Joint Operating Agreement served to operate a transfer of rights and obligations held under the Participation Contract, resulting in AEC's purported \u2018ownership' over these rights to the extent of its Participating Interest\".\n\nAward at 303.\n\n201.\n\nSumming up : upon the execution of the Farmout Agreements in 2000, OEPC retained a 60% interest in the Farmout Property (which included OEPC's legal position under the Participation Contract), and for good consideration transferred to AEC ownership over a 40% interest in the Farmout Property. The transfer was never authorized by the Ecuadorian Minister of Mines, as required by Article 79 HCL. However, OEPC and AEC duly complied with the terms and conditions agreed upon in the Farmout Agreements.\n\n**c. Split Title: Beneficial Ownership and Nominee**\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n202.\n\nAlthough the Farmout Agreements foresaw a transfer of ownership, the transfer was timed to occur in two phases, and it was agreed that AEC was only to acquire formal title over its 40% share in the Farmout Property in a second phase. During the first phase (which is the only one relevant, because it was during that phase when the *Caducidad* Decree was issued) the parties agreed in clause 2.01 of the Farmout Agreement that title to the 40% interest in the Farmout Property was to be split:\n\n- AEC, who had paid the consideration for acquiring ownership, would be the \u2019\u2019 beneficial owner \" of its portion of the Farmout Property;\n\n- While OEPC would be acting as a \" nominee \" for AEC, appearing as formal owner *vis-\u00e0-vis* third parties (including *vis-\u00e0-vis* the Ecuadorian public administration).\n\n203.\n\nOwnership title was thus divided between a nominee (OEPC, who held legal title on behalf of the beneficial owner) and a beneficial owner (AEC who bore the costs, profits, risks and rewards of ownership, whose instructions the nominee agreed to follow and who thus controlled its share of the investment).\n\n204.\n\nProf. Stern has drawn attention to the legal relevance of this split ownership structure created by the Farmout Agreements160.\n\nDissent at 148.\n\n205.\n\nThe Committee agrees with Prof. Stern's analysis. The Farmout Agreements have indeed provided that, at the time when the *Caducidad* Decree was issued, the Claimants only retained full title over 60% of their investment in Block 15. For the remaining 40%, OEPC was simply a \"nominee\", who held apparent ownership, but in substance was acting on behalf and for the benefit of the true beneficiary, AEC. It was AEC who actually controlled a 40% share in the Farmout Property.\n\nThe Tribunal's Disagreement\n---------------------------\n\n206.\n\nThe majority of the Tribunal, however, disagrees with this analysis. In its Award it reaches the opposite conclusion161 :\n\n\"658. [\u2026] Also moot is Respondent's contention that there is a risk of double jeopardy as AEC has no standing to sue Ecuador directly for compensation given that it holds no rights - beneficial or otherwise - in the Participation Contract \" [emphasis added].\n\nAward at 658.\n\n207.\n\nIn the Committee's opinion, the Tribunal's finding is inconsistent with the clear language of clause 2.01 of the Farmout Agreement, which provides that during phase I of the transaction OEPC\n\n\"shall hold legal title to the interest in the Farmout Property represented by the [40%] Farmout Interest of AEC in the Participating Agreements [which include the Participation Contract] as a \u2018nominee', with the obligation to convey title to such interest to AEC [in phase II]\" [emphasis added].\n\n208.\n\nIf in the Farmout Agreements the parties agreed that OEPC would act as AEC's nominee, the inescapable consequence is that AEC became the beneficial owner of the interest in the Farmout Property. This conclusion is confirmed by the last sentence of clause 2.01 of the Farmout Agreement:\n\n\"OEPC shall be obligated, at the sole risk, cost and expense of AEC to act with respect to the Farmout Interest of AEC as AEC shall direct from time to time as if AEC were a party to the Participating Agreements [which include the Participation Contract] owning legal title to a 40% interest in the Participating Agreements and the interests therein granted in Block 15\".\n\n209.\n\nThe same principle is repeated in clause 3.2.1 of the Joint Operating Agreement:\n\n\"3.2.1 Pursuant to the provisions of the Farmout Agreement, AECI has on the Effective Date a forty percent (40%) interest in the Participating Agreements that until the Transfer Date shall be equivalent economically to, but shall not include, nominal legal title and, thereafter, shall include legal title\".\n\n210.\n\nIn view of the clear language of the Farmout Agreements, and the undisputed fact that OEPC and AEC duly complied with its terms and conditions, and paid the consideration established therein, the Tribunal's conclusion that AEC did not acquire any interest - beneficial or otherwise - in the Participation Contract is untenable.\n\n211.\n\nFurthermore, the Tribunal's conclusion is inconsistent with its own finding that the Farmout Agreements\n\n\"303. [\u2026] operate[d] a transfer of rights and obligations held under the Participation Contract, resulting in AEC's purported \u2018ownership' over these rights to the extent of its Participating Interest\"162.\n\nAward at 303.\n\n**d. AEC is not a Creditor**\n----------------------------\n\n212.\n\nA corollary of the fact that AEC is a beneficial owner and controller of a 40% interest in the Farmout Property is that AEC cannot be considered as a creditor, holding a contractual right to claim from OEPC a share of the Block 15 oil production.\n\n213.\n\nOEPC and AEC could have structured their relationship as a \"cash against future oil transaction\", as a simple sales agreement, where AEC agrees to pay an uncertain price (equivalent to a percentage of the expenditure in Block 15) and receives an uncertain quantity of oil in the future (the agreed percentage of whatever oil the Block produces).\n\n214.\n\nThe parties chose not to do so.\n\n215.\n\nInstead, they agreed on the Farmout Agreements, which formalized a totally different transaction: a transaction where OEPC transferred to AEC beneficial ownership and control to a 40% interest in the Farmout Property, and AEC paid the agreed consideration for the ownership of such asset. As owner of an interest in the Farmout Property, AEC had the rights and obligations concomitant with its coownership status: AEC participated in the management of the Property, it was under an obligation to contribute to the expenditure of exploiting and developing Block 15 and it was entitled to collect its portion of the oil revenue generated.\n\n**e. Transfer to Andes and Letter Agreement**\n---------------------------------------------\n\n216.\n\nIn 2005 - five years after the execution of the Farmout Agreements - EnCana, AEC's parent company, executed a Share Sale Agreement with Andes Petroleum Co. (\" **Andes** \"), a Chinese company, whereby EnCana sold AEC to Andes163. The parties also signed a supplemental indemnity agreement, in which the seller assumed certain obligations and indemnities related to possible actions by the Ecuadorian authorities related to Block 15 and the Participation Contract.\n\nR I at 199.\n\nLetter Agreement\n----------------\n\n217.\n\nIn February 2006 - i.e. during the *Caducidad* procedure but before the issuance of the *Caducidad* Decree - OEPC and Andes executed a Letter Agreement (the \" **Letter Agreement** \")164 in which\n\n- Andes released OEPC of any liability arising out of the *Caducidad* proceedings and acknowledged that OEPC had no obligation to compensate Andes in case of *caducidad* [clause 2 (a)];\n\n- OEPC and Andes agreed to share all cost on a 60/40 basis [clause 2 (f)]\n\n- OEPC agreed to share with Andes 40% of whatever monetary award OEPC received as result of the *caducidad* proceedings or any monetary award received from Ecuador, net of any costs, in effect creating a joint venture [clause 2 (g)].\n\nDoc. EEA 152.\n\n218.\n\nThe Letter Agreement is consistent with and the natural consequence of the Farmout Agreements.\n\n219.\n\nUnder the Farmout Agreements, ownership of the Farmout Property, including OEPC's bundle of rights and obligations resulting from the Participation Contract, was shared 60/40 between OEPC and AEC. When the Republic declared *caducidad* of the Participation Contract and took the Farmout Property, AEC was deprived of its asset and its ownership rights transformed into the right to collect a compensation, if any, from Ecuador. The Letter Agreement simply acknowledges and formalizes this fact.\n\n**f. The** ***Caducidad*** **Decree**\n-------------------------------------\n\n220.\n\nA few months thereafter, in May 2006, the Ecuadorian Minister of Energy issued the *Caducidad* Decree, a ministerial decision adopted after a lengthy preliminary administrative procedure. In the decision the Minister, applying the HCL, declared the *caducidad* of the Participation Contract, as a sanction for the unauthorized transfer of rights between OEPC and AEC/Andes. The powers of the Minister to order *caducidad* derive from Article 74 HCL, the first article in the chapter of the law devoted to \" *Caducidad, Sanciones y Transferencias* \":\n\n\"Art. 74: El Ministerio del Ramo podr\u00e1 declarar la caducidad de los contratos si el contratista:\n\n[\u2026]\n\n11. Traspasare derechos o celebrare contrato o acuerdo privado para la cesi\u00f3n de uno o m\u00e1s de sus derechos, sin la autorizaci\u00f3n del Ministerio;\n\n12. Integrare consorcios o asociaciones para las operaciones de exploraci\u00f3n o explotaci\u00f3n, o se retirare de ellos, sin autorizaci\u00f3n del Ministerio; y\n\n13. Reincidiere en infracciones a la Ley y sus reglamentos\".\n\n221.\n\nThe Minister found that OEPC's conduct had resulted in the grounds for *caducidad* set forth in sections 11, 12 and 13 of Article 74 HCL165. His decision led to the automatic termination of the Participation Contract166. Besides, OEPC was forced to turn over to the State and to PetroEcuador the concession and all assets used in connection with Block 15, without any compensation167.\n\n*Caducidad* Decree at OC 09284.\n\nParticipation Contract clause 21.1.\n\nArticle 75 HCL.\n\n222.\n\nBut the most important consequence of the declaration of *caducidad* was that Article 79 HCL, a rule establishing that transfers of contract or assignment of rights, executed without prior administrative authorization, shall be null and void and without validity, became relevant.\n\n**g. The Nullity under Article 79 HCL**\n---------------------------------------\n\n223.\n\nArticle 79 HCL provides as follows:\n\n\"La transferencia de un contrato o la cesi\u00f3n a terceros de derechos provenientes de un contrato, ser\u00e1n nulas y no tendr\u00e1n valor alguno si no precede autorizaci\u00f3n del Ministerio del Ramo, sin perjuicio de la declaraci\u00f3n de caducidad seg\u00fan lo previsto en la presente Ley.\n\nEl Estado recibir\u00e1 una prima por el traspaso y la empresa beneficiaria deber\u00e1 celebrar un nuevo contrato en condiciones econ\u00f3micas m\u00e1s favorables para el Estado y para PETROECUADOR, que las contenidas en el contrato primitivo\" [Emphasis added].\n\n224.\n\nThe rule applies in two situations:\n\n- The first is if the holder of an oil contract executes a \" *transferencia de un contrato* *\",* i.e. if the holder transfers to a third party (the totality or a portion of) its legal position in the contract (i.e. of the bundle of rights and obligations arising therefrom); and\n\n- The second is if the holder of an oil contract carries out a \" *cesi\u00f3n a terceros de derechos provenientes de un contrato* *\",* i.e. the holder assigns rights (but not obligations) deriving from such an oil contract.\n\nThe legal provision then orders that, except if the authorization of the Minister has been obtained, the transfer or the assignment shall be null and void and shall have no validity whatsoever.\n\n225.\n\nThe proper interpretation of Article 79 HCL has been an intensely disputed question. Two issues have merited special attention:\n\n- whether the nullity predicated by this rule is automatic, not requiring judicial declaration (**h**) and\n\n- whether it is possible to sever the transaction between OEPC and AEC into an assignment of rights on one side, and the remaining content of the Farmout Agreements on the other, with the assignment being null and void, and the Farmout Agreements surviving as a valid transaction (**i**).\n\n**h. Does Article 79 HCL result in Automatic Nullity/ Inexistence?**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n226.\n\nThe majority of the Tribunal accepted that, although not expressly stated in the Ecuadorian Civil Code, the Ecuadorian Supreme Court had confirmed on a number of occasions that Ecuadorian law recognizes automatic nullity or inexistence168. And the Tribunal concluded that Article 79 HCL is one of those instances of automatic nullity, there being no requirement that the unauthorized transfer or assignment be declared invalid by a judge, because the law itself stipulates that the act \"has no validity whatsoever\"169. The same result would - in the opinion of the majority of the Tribunal - flow from the application of New York law.\n\nAward at 622.\n\nAward at 626.\n\n227.\n\nArbitrator Stern dissented.\n\n228.\n\nIn her opinion under New York law (which was the contractually relevant law), the Farmout Agreements, not having been invalidated by a New York court, should be considered as still in force and binding170.\n\nDissent at 55.\n\n229.\n\nUnder Ecuadorian law she came to the same conclusion. Analyzing the very case law used by the majority of the Tribunal, she concluded that the cases stand for the principle that inexistence only results from the absence of the solemnity of a legal deed, when such form is required by law. Absence of other formalities, like the absence of an administrative authorization, entails an absolute nullity171. And absolute nullity has to be declared by a judge, as is stated without any possible ambiguity in section 1699 of the Civil Code.\n\nDissent at 105.\n\n230.\n\nProf. Stern concluded that if the applicable law was Ecuadorian law, the Farmout Agreements, not having been invalidated by a court, should also have been considered as still in force.\n\nThe Committee's Analysis\n------------------------\n\n231.\n\nThe Farmout Agreement provides that it is to be governed by New York law \"except to the extent that the laws of Ecuador require application of the laws of Ecuador to the Participating Agreements\"172. This implies - as the Award acknowledges - that New York courts would give effect to mandatory Ecuadorian laws governing the Farmout Agreement, including the HCL, when considering the validity of the assignment173, and that the materially relevant law is that of Ecuador.\n\nClause 7.02.\n\nAward at 646.\n\n232.\n\nThe Ecuadorian Civil Code contains the following regulation with regard to the nullity of contracts:\n\n\"Art. 1698.- La nulidad producida por un objeto o causa il\u00edcita, y la nulidad producida por la omisi\u00f3n de alg\u00fan requisito o formalidad que las leyes prescriben para el valor de ciertos actos o contratos [...] son nulidades absolutas.\n\nArt. 1699.- La nulidad absoluta puede y debe ser declarada por el juez, a\u00fan sin petici\u00f3n de parte, cuando aparece de manifiesto en el acto o contrato; [...]\".[Emphasis added].\n\n233.\n\nEcuadorian law creates the category of *\"nulidadabsoluta \"* of a contract, applicable when there is a failure to comply with a formality or requirement established by law. Such \" *nulidad absoluta\"* must be declared by a judge (i.e. it is not automatic) in order to produce the voidance of a validly executed contract.\n\n234.\n\nThe Committee agrees with Prof. Stern: the nullity deriving from Article 79 HCL was caused by the failure to comply with a \" *requisito que las leyes prescriben para el valor de ciertos contratos* \", namely the authorization of the Minister, and thus it constitutes a \" *nulidad absoluta\"* as defined in Article 1698 of the Civil Code, with the consequence that the nullity had to be declared by a judge.\n\n235.\n\nThe majority of the Tribunal based its decision to declare the assignment of rights inexistent, and thus not requiring a judicial declaration, \"[o]n [the] face\" of Article 79 HCL174. Based on this interpretation, the Tribunal concluded that the transfer of ownership in favour of AEC/Andes, which had occurred in the year 2000, when the Farmout Agreements had been executed, was inexistent175.\n\nAward at 619.\n\nAward at 619.\n\n236.\n\nThe majority of the Tribunal's interpretation is incorrect: Article 79 does not mention the concepts of \"inexistence\" or \"automatic nullity\", it simply states that the transfer or assignment \" *ser\u00e1n nulas y no tendr\u00e1n valor alguno si no procede la autorizaci\u00f3n del Ministerio* \", and this nullity clearly fits into the definition of a \" *nulidad absoluta\"* under Article 1698 of the Civil Code. The words \" *y no tendr\u00e1n valor alguno* \" are a simple reiteration of the main effect produced by nullity.\n\n237.\n\nTo support its position the Tribunal also invoked Article 1718 of the Civil Code176. Article 1718 provides as follows:\n\n\"Art. 1718.- La falta de instrumento p\u00fablico no puede suplirse por otra prueba en los actos y contratos en que la Ley requiere esa solemnidad; y se mirar\u00e1n como no ejecutados o celebrados, aun cuando en ellos se prometa reducirlos a instrumento p\u00fablico dentro de cierto plazo, bajo una cl\u00e1usula penal. Esta cl\u00e1usula no tendr\u00e1 efecto alguno\".[Emphasis added]\n\nAward at 628. Although the Tribunal refers to Article 1745, such numbering corresponds to the repealed 1970 Ecuadorian Civil Code. The 2005 Civil Code has an identical provision in Article 1718.\n\n238.\n\nThis provision is irrelevant for the issue under discussion.\n\n239.\n\nArticle 1718 refers to the proper formalization of obligations and contracts, and provides that, if the law requires that a contract be formalized in an \" *instrumento p\u00fablico* \", the absence of such requirement renders the contract inexistent. Article 1716 defines \" *instrumento p\u00fablico* \" as a deed authenticated by a notary or other authorized civil servant. Since it is undisputed that Ecuadorian law does not require that the Farmout Agreements be formalized in an \" *instrumento p\u00fablico* \", the rule provided for in Article 1718 is irrelevant in this case.\n\n240.\n\nThe Tribunal also tried to find support for its conclusion in Ecuadorian case law, which allegedly acknowledges the concept of \"inexistence\" and \"automatic nullity\"177.\n\nAward at 622.\n\n241.\n\nThe Committee has analysed the case law referred to by the Tribunal and has found no support for the majority's conclusion: all cases deal with the inexistence of promises to buy/sell which had not been properly formalized in an \" *instrumento p\u00fablico* \" (i.e. in a notarial deed). The case law is clear that \"inexistence\" only arises in exceptional cases, when the law requires that the contractual consent be formalized with \" *solemnidad* \" (i.e. in an \"instrumento p\u00fablico\", as required in certain contracts involving real estate). There is no discussion that the consent to enter into the Farmout Agreements was properly formalized and did not require \" *solemnidad* \". What is being discussed is whether the properly formalized Farmout Agreement became inexistent by operation of Article 79 HCL. The parties have not referred to any Ecuadorian case law holding that an otherwise valid contract was rendered inexistent as a consequence of the failure to obtain an administrative authorization.\n\n**i. Can the Farmout Agreements be severed for Nullity purposes?**\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n242.\n\nThe majority of the Tribunal did not only decree that the assignment of rights formalized in the Farmout Agreement was inexistent and that no judicial declaration was required, it also specifically declared that such invalidity did not affect the Farmout Agreements178.\n\nAward at 635.\n\n243.\n\nIn the course of the arbitration Claimants had argued that under New York law any portion of the Farmout Agreements which did not require authorization from the Minister could be severed and would survive, even if the assignment of certain rights was null and void under Article 79 HCL.\n\n244.\n\nThis idea was taken up by the majority of the Tribunal, who agreed that the assignment of rights could be severed from the underlying Farmout Agreements, and while the former was automatically null and void and inexistent, by application of Article 79 HCL, the latter remained valid. The Tribunal expressed its reasoning with the following words179:\n\n\"... the Tribunal reiterates that in the present case it is the validity of the assignment that is under scrutiny, and not the validity of the Farmout Agreement or the Joint Operating Agreement. The Tribunal's findings on the validity of the assignment do not affect other obligations that might arise between the parties to the Farmout Agreement and the Joint Operating Agreement (such parties being different to [ *sic* ] those in the present arbitration), nor does it affect the ability of AEC to seek damages from OEPC for a failure to comply with the terms of those Agreements, such as obtaining necessary government consent for the assignment\".\n\nAward at 635.\n\n245.\n\nProf. Stern dissented180:\n\n\"126. If I understand correctly what the majority wants to convey here, it seems that it is saying that it cannot judge the validity of the Farmout Agreement, because it is between parties that are different than the ones before the ICSID Tribunal, but that it can rule on the validity of the assignment. This line of reasoning is quite difficult to follow, as it seems to me first that the parties to the assignment are exactly the same as the parties to the Farmout Agreement and second that the assignment and the Farmout Agreement are one and the same thing intrinsically linked together\".\n\nDissent at 126.\n\nThe Committee's Analysis\n------------------------\n\n246.\n\nThe Committee agrees with Prof. Stern that the opinion of the majority of the Tribunal is difficult to follow, because very little reasoning has been provided. According to the majority, the nullity would have been generated by Article 79 HCL, but the Tribunal has failed to provide any explanation on why this rule supports its conclusion.\n\n247.\n\nIn fact, the literal wording of Article 79 HCL contradicts the Tribunal's conclusions.\n\n248.\n\nArticle 79 HCL distinguishes between two types of transactions:\n\n- \" *transferencia de un contrato* \" and\n\n- \" *cesi\u00f3n a terceros de derechos provenientes de un contrato* \".\n\nThe Farmout Agreements qualify as a \" *transferencia de un contrato* \", and not as a mere \" *cesi\u00f3n de derechos* \". OEPC is not simply assigning certain rights to AEC. The object of the Farmout Agreements is the transfer to AEC of a bundle of rights and obligations which constitute 40% OEPC's position in the Participation Contract181.\n\nSee clause 1.01 and 2.01 Farmout Agreement and para 198 *supra.*\n\n249.\n\nIf what has triggered the application of Article 79 HCL is the unauthorized \"transferencia de un contrato\" executed by means of the Farmout Agreements, the rule itself mandates that the \"transferencia de contrato\" shall be null and void and shall have no validity. There is no room to argue that the Farmout Agreements, the instrument which formalized the \"transferencia de contrato\", can survive, while the \"transferencia de contrato\" is (automatically or not, that is irrelevant for this discussion) null and void. Farmout Agreements and \"transferencia de contrato\" are one and the same thing, and both are identically affected by the nullity brought about by the lack of authorization182.\n\nThe conclusion would be the same if the Farmout Agreements are considered as a simple \" *cesi\u00f3n de derechos* \", for the reasons noted by Prof. Stern in her dissent.\n\n**j. Claims filed by the affected Parties**\n-------------------------------------------\n\n250.\n\nImmediately after the issuance by the Minister of Energy of the *Caducidad* Decree, Claimants filed this arbitration, requesting compensation for 100% of the assets taken by the Ecuadorian government.\n\n251.\n\nThe Tribunal eventually reached the decision that the Republic had expropriated Claimants' investment in Block 15 in breach of Article II.1 of the Treaty, and that the *Caducidad* Decree had been issued in breach of Ecuadorian law and customary international law183.\n\nAward at 876.\n\n252.\n\nClaimants have been affected by Ecuador's acts in contravention of the Treaty. But so were AEC/Andes, being the beneficial owner of a 40% in the Farmout Property, which included the rights and obligations deriving from the Participation Contract and all the assets used in Block 15184. This beneficial ownership was taken by the Republic of Ecuador, together with the 60% share property of OEPC.\n\nSee para. 198 *supra.*\n\n253.\n\nNotwithstanding the damage suffered, there is no indication in the file that Andes has filed a separate claim against the Republic, either before the Courts of Ecuador or before any international tribunal185. The only claim submitted has been the present action, in which OEPC is requesting 100% of the value of Block 15. This is consistent with the Letter Agreement in which OEPC and Andes agreed that any reward arising from this procedure will be shared 60/40 - the ownership structure over the Farmout Property provided for in the Farmout Agreements.\n\nAt least there is no information in the file showing otherwise.\n\n254.\n\nThere is also no evidence in the file that any judge or arbitrator, either in Ecuador or in New York, has declared the nullity of the Farmout Agreements, as a consequence of the violation of Article 79 HCL (or otherwise). And, in accordance with basic principles of procedural fairness, the Award rendered in this arbitration proceeding, in which AEC/Andes was not represented, could in no case result in the voidance of the Farmout Agreements, to which AEC/Andes were a party.\n\n**B. Excess of Powers in assuming Jurisdiction over the Investment held by Andes**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n255.\n\nIn the previous section the Committee concluded that:\n\n- upon execution of the Farmout Agreements in 2000, OEPC retained a 60% interest in the Farmout Property (which included OEPC's legal position under the Participation Contract), and for good consideration transferred to AEC/Andes beneficial ownership over a 40% interest in such Farmout Property; such transfer was never authorized by the Ecuadorian Minister of Mines;\n\n- in 2006 the Ecuadorian Government issued the *Caducidad* Decree, which led to the automatic termination of the Participation Contract186, established that an administrative authorization should have been obtained at the time when the Farmout Agreements were executed, and triggered the application of Article 79 HCL187;\n\n- Article 79 HCL provides for the \" *nulidad absoluta* \" of any unauthorized assignment of rights or transfer of agreement, and that such \" *nulidad absoluta* \" requires declaration by a judge (i.e. it is not automatic), and that there is no evidence in the file that any judge has declared the nullity of the Farmout Agreement;\n\n- AEC/Andes was not a party to the underlying arbitration proceedings, and in accordance with general principles of law, the Award could under no circumstances declare the invalidity of the Farmout Agreement, to which AEC had been a party;\n\n- the assignment of rights and the Farmout Agreement cannot be severed: it is impossible to argue (as the Tribunal did) that the assignment of rights is invalid, affected by a an automatic nullity or inexistence provoked by the application of Article 79 HCL, and simultaneously to hold that the Farmout Agreement is still valid and binding. The Farmout Agreement embodies a \" *transferencia de contrato* \" and both would be identically affected if the supervening nullity were declared by a judge.\n\nParticipation Contract clause 21.1.\n\nArticle 75 HCL.\n\n256.\n\nHaving established these conclusions, the Committee will now turn to Respondent's argument that the Tribunal exceeded its powers by assuming jurisdiction over the investment now beneficially owned by AEC/Andes - and come to the conclusion that a manifest excess of powers has indeed occurred (**a.**). It will then dismiss Claimants' counterargument (**b.**) and will establish the consequences of the partial annulment of the Award (**c.**).\n\n**a. The Tribunal's Assumption of Jurisdiction over the Investment held by Andes**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n257.\n\nRespondent argues that an ICSID tribunal commits a manifest excess of powers if it exercises jurisdiction over the investment held by AEC/Andes\n\n- which is not a party to the arbitration agreement contained in the Participation Contract and\n\n- which is not a protected investor under the BIT (in this case the Ecuador-US BIT) from which the Tribunal derives its authority188.\n\nR I at 532.\n\n258.\n\nIn the present case the protected investment consists in the so called Farmout Property, comprising the Participation Contract and the assets used for the exploitation and development of Block 15, and in accordance with the Farmout Agreements its ownership is split between OEPC and AEC/Andes\n\n- OEPC being full owner of a 60% interest in the Property, and\n\n- AEC/Andes being the beneficial owner and controller of the remaining 40% interest, which OEPC held as AEC/Andes' nominee189.\n\nSee para. 208 *supra.*\n\nSplit Title in International Law\n--------------------------------\n\n259.\n\nIn cases where legal title is split between a nominee and a beneficial owner international law is uncontroversial: as Arbitrator Stern has stated in her Dissent190 the dominant position in international law grants standing and relief to the owner of the beneficial interest - not to the nominee.\n\nDissent at 148-151.\n\n260.\n\nThe *status quaestionis* was summarized thus by David Bederman191:\n\n\"International law authorities have agreed that the real and equitable owner of an international claim is the proper party before an international adjudication, and not the nominal or record owner. This principle was espoused as early as 1876, and was a consistent element in early claims practice. Moreover, claims tribunals following the First World War explicitly enquired into the beneficial ownership of property at issue before them. The fact that the nominal owner did not have a real interest in the subject property, or that the beneficial owner was not of a proper nationality, was occasionally the decisive ground for dismissing a claim. Claims settlement commissions after the Second World War likewise continued this practice, and it has been observed recently in the jurisprudence of the Iran-United States Claims Tribunal. The notion that the beneficial (and not the nominal) owner of property is the real party-in-interest before an international court may be justly considered a general principle of international law \". [Footnotes ommited; emphasis added].\n\nDavid J. Bederman: \" *Beneficial Ownership of international Claims\"* in International and Comparative Law Quarterly, Vol. 38, 1989, p. 936.\n\n261.\n\nOther authors have confirmed the conclusion192.\n\nFrancisco Orrego Vicu\u00f1a: *\"Changing approaches to the nationality of claims in the context of diplomatic protection\",* ICSID Review, Vol. 15, 2000 p. 352: \"In claims to property beneficially owned by one person, the nominal title to which is vested in another person of different nationality, it was usually the nationality of the former that prevailed for the purposes of the claims\"; Marjorie M. Whiteman, *Digest of International Law*, Vol. 8, pp. 1261-1261; Richard B. Lillich & Daniel B. Magraw, *The Iran-United States Claims Tribunal: Its contribution to the Law of State Responsibility*, 1998, p. 105: \"The Tribunal's precedents have made clear that beneficial owners of property are to be preferred as legitimate claimants over nominal owners. This was the express conclusion of the 1993 *Saghi* decision\".\n\n262.\n\nThe position as regards beneficial ownership is a reflection of a more general principle of international investment law: claimants are only permitted to submit their own claims, held for their own benefit, not those held (be it as nominees, agents or otherwise) on behalf of third parties not protected by the relevant treaty. And tribunals exceed their jurisdiction if they grant compensation to third parties whose investments are not entitled to protection under the relevant instrument.\n\n263.\n\nThis subjective limitation of ICSID jurisdiction is a natural consequence of international investment law. Arbitral tribunals are not courts of justice holding unfettered jurisdiction. The role of arbitral tribunals is not to redress torts worldwide. Arbitral tribunals are instruments created by and subject to the consent of States, as formalized in the relevant instrument, and are only empowered to adjudicate disputes between protected investors and consenting States. Other disputes are outside their remit. Investors cannot expand the jurisdiction *ratione personae* of arbitral tribunals by executing private contracts with third parties.\n\n264.\n\nSpecifically, protected investors cannot transfer beneficial ownership and control in a protected investment to an unprotected third party, and expect that the arbitral tribunal retains jurisdiction to adjudicate the dispute between the third party and the host State. To hold the contrary would open the floodgates to an uncontrolled expansion of jurisdiction *ratione personae*, beyond the limits agreed by the States when executing the treaty.\n\nThe Tribunal committed an Excess of Powers\n------------------------------------------\n\n265.\n\nThe Committee has already verified that with regard to the 40% interest in the Farmout Property title is split, beneficial ownership and control being held by AEC/Andes, with OEPC acting as nominee on behalf of the beneficial owner. It has also concluded that in situations like this international law provides that only the beneficial owner, AEC/Andes, can claim for interference with its interest, while the nominee, OEPC, lacks standing to claim in the name of the beneficial owner193.\n\nThe same conclusion is reached by Arbitrator Stern in her Dissent at 151.\n\n266.\n\nIn the present case, the Tribunal has decided to compensate OEPC for 100% of the investment in Block 15. But 40% of that investment does not belong to OEPC, the U.S. corporation protected by the BIT and which is also party to the Participation Contract, but to Andes, a Chinese company, unprotected by the BIT and which does not participate in such Contract. By compensating a protected investor for an investment which is beneficially owned by a non-protected investor, the Tribunal has illicitly expanded the scope of its jurisdiction and has acted with an excess of powers.\n\nThe Excess of Powers is manifest\n--------------------------------\n\n267.\n\nArticle 52(1)(b) requires that the excess of powers be manifest. The Committee has already concluded that this additional limitation applies in situations where it is argued that the tribunal committed a jurisdictional excess of powers194. That said, \"manifest\" does not prevent that in some cases an extensive argumentation and analysis may be required to prove that the misuse of powers has in fact occurred195.\n\nSee para. 58 *supra* with case law. Note that with regards to errors of law affecting the merits, the standard is even higher: only gross and egregious errors of law can lead to annulment (see para 56 *supra*).\n\n*V\u00edctor Pey Casado*, at 70.\n\n268.\n\nIn the present case, the excess of powers is manifest: the Tribunal decided to assume jurisdiction over an investment which, at the relevant time, no longer belonged to OEPC [for the purposes of Article I(a) of the Treaty], and to compensate Claimants for 100% of the value of Block 15, without taking into consideration that:\n\n- in accordance with the Farmout Agreement, Claimants for good consideration had transferred beneficial ownership of a 40% share in the Farmout Property to AEC/Andes, OEPC remaining simply as a \"nominee\", who holds apparent ownership, but in substance acts on behalf and for the benefit of the beneficial owner, AEC/Andes196;\n\n- OEPC and AEC/Andes have at all times acted in full compliance with the terms and conditions agreed upon in the Farmout Agreements, there being no evidence in the file of any judicial declaration of voidance either by application of Article 79 HCL or otherwise;\n\n- AEC/Andes not being a party to these arbitration proceedings, the Award could under no circumstances declare the invalidity of such Agreements;\n\n- The assignment of rights and the Farmout Agreement are one and the same thing, and that both would be equally affected by a hypothetical nullity declared in accordance to Article 79 HCL;\n\n- The existence of an uncontroversial principle of international law for situations when legal title is split between a nominee and a beneficial owner: as Arbitrator Stern stated in her Dissent197 and the Committee has confirmed, international law only grants standing and relief to the owner of the beneficial interest - not to the nominee.\n\nSee para 208 *supra.*\n\nDissent at 148-151.\n\nThe Committee's Decision\n------------------------\n\n269.\n\nThe Committee thus finds that the Tribunal committed a manifest excess of powers for the purposes of Article 52(1)(b) of the Convention.\n\n270.\n\nArticle 52(3) of the Convention grants committees \"the authority to annul an award or any part thereof on any grounds set forth in paragraph (1)\" of such article. Exercising its authority under said Article, the Committee partially annuls the Award, to the extent that the Tribunal has assumed jurisdiction with regard to the investment now beneficially owned by the Chinese investor Andes (and previously by the Bermudan company AEC), i.e. AEC/Andes' 40% interest in the Farmout Property, and has awarded damages to OEPC based on such decision.\n\n271.\n\nThe rest of the Award remains unaffected.\n\n272.\n\nA final *caveat:* neither the international law principles nor the Committee's decision imply that investors holding beneficial ownership are left unprotected from interferences by host States. Such investors will enjoy the protection granted under the treaties which benefit their nationality. In the present case, AEC/Andes are entitled to the protection which investors from Bermuda/China enjoy, when investing in Ecuador, under applicable bilateral investment treaties or under general principles of international law. What they are not entitled to - because they are not U.S. nationals or companies - is to the protection offered to U.S. investors investing in Ecuador under the U.S.-Ecuador BIT.\n\nCase Law\n--------\n\n273.\n\nInvestment arbitration case law has acknowledged the principle that under international law legal standing pertains to beneficial owners and not necessarily to nominees, and that unprotected parties cannot receive compensation, even if claimed on their behalf by protected investors.\n\n274.\n\nA case which shows striking similarities with this arbitration is *Impregilo v. Pakistan.*\n\nIn *Impregilo v. Pakistan* an Italian company had created a joint venture without legal personality under the laws of Switzerland called GBC, in which it held a majority participation, together with a German, a French and two Pakistani companies, in order to participate in a tender to construct hydroelectric power facilities in Pakistan. Impregilo then acted as the only signatory of the contract on behalf of the joint-venture. It was also the only claimant in the arbitration. In the procedure it argued that it was under a contractual obligation to distribute any monetary award with its partners. Thus, the only way for Impregilo to obtain its stake was for the Tribunal to permit Impregilo to proceed on behalf of all partners. The claimant reasoned that it could not be made whole for its own personal damage from the treaty breaches, unless it collected 100% of the damage suffered by the joint venture, because it had to distribute any amount awarded with its partners.\n\n275.\n\nThe Tribunal rejected Impregilo's attempt to claim amounts that would be turned over to unprotected third parties stating:\n\n\"144. Analysis: In the Tribunal's view, Impregilo cannot advance claims in these proceedings on behalf of the other participants in GBC.\n\n[...]\n\n146. The question is raised whether a party who does fall within the ambit of a BIT and the Convention may act in arbitration proceedings in a representative capacity, in order to advance claims on behalf of other entities who do not so qualify. In the Tribunal's view, the issue turns upon the precise scope of the parties' respective consent to the jurisdiction of ICSID. It is now well-accepted that \"consent of the parties is the cornerstone of the jurisdiction of the Centre\".\n\n147. In this case, Pakistan's consent is delineated by the BIT. In concluding the Treaty with Italy, Pakistan has conferred certain rights on Italian nationals in connection with the protection of investments in Pakistan. It has not conferred any rights on nationals of any other state, nor on nationals of Pakistan itself.\n\n148. It must follow that the scope of Pakistan's consent to ICSID is correspondingly limited. On a proper construction, Pakistan has consented to the resolution by ICSID of its disputes arising out of investments made by Italian nationals in Pakistan. There is nothing in the BIT to extend this to claims of nationals of any other state, even if advanced on their behalf by Italian nationals. Any other interpretation would obviously expose Pakistan to claims by nationals of any state worldwide.\n\n149. To this end, investors of German nationality [...] and Pakistani nationality [...] cannot benefit from the protection conferred upon Italian investors by the 1997 BIT.\n\n[...]\n\n151. The fact that Impregilo may be empowered to advance claims on behalf of its partners is an internal contractual matter between the participants of the Joint Venture. It cannot, of itself, impact upon the scope of Pakistan's consent as expressed in the BIT. Equally, the fact that Impregilo may be obliged to account to its partners in respect of any damages obtained in these proceedings is also an internal GBC matter, which has no bearing on Pakistan's agreed exposure under the BIT. If this were not so, any party would be at liberty to conclude a variety of private contracts with third parties, and thereby unilaterally expand the ambit of a BIT \". [Emphasis added, footnotes ommitted]198.\n\n*Impregilo v. Pakistan*, at 146-151.\n\n276.\n\nThe *Impregilo* tribunal concluded that\n\n\"[i]t follows that this Tribunal has no jurisdiction in respect of claims on behalf of, or losses incurred by, either GBC itself or any of Impregilo's joint venture partners\"199.\n\n*Ibid.* at 153\n\n277.\n\nThe decision rendered in the *Binder-Haas Claim* is particularly interesting200: in 1945 the Government of Yugoslavia had taken 7,500 shares of the company Dugaresa which were initially owned by Etexco, a Swiss corporation owned by four individuals. Some years before the expropriation, these individuals had transferred their holdings in Etexco to Edwin Binder - an American citizen - to hold as \"constructive trustee\". A claim was brought by Mr. Binder together with the four individuals (one of which lacked American citizenship). The Commission decided that Mr. Binder was not entitled to make a claim on his own behalf and that claims must be filed by the four other persons, who were the real or beneficial owners. Since one of them was not an American citizen, her claim had to fail. That of the other claimants succeeded.\n\n*Binder-Haas Claim*, United States International Claims Commission (1951-1954), reprinted in I.L.R. 236-38 (1957), Doc. EEA 136.\n\n278.\n\nIn *PSEG v. Turkey,* an ICSID tribunal held that it would be improper \"if compensation is awarded in respect of investments or expenses incurred by entities over which there is no jurisdiction\"201.\n\nPSEG, a US company, was granted an authorization to conduct a feasibility study for the construction of a coal mine and a coal-fired plant in Turkey. Thereafter, PSEG signed an implementation contract and a concession contract. The North American Coal Company (NACC) assisted PSEG with the mining aspects of the project. Guris, a Turkish company, participated in the project as a sponsor. The claimants initiated ICSID proceedings under the Turkey-US BIT and the Tribunal found that Turkey was in violation of the fair and equitable treatment obligation.\n\n*PSEG* at 325.\n\n279.\n\nIn determining the compensation payable, the tribunal denied recovery to PSEG for contributions made to the project by the other companies. The Tribunal stated that202\n\n\"As the Tribunal noted in the Decision on Jurisdiction of 4 June 2004, these entities might have a claim against PSEG in the light of intra-corporate arrangements, but this is not something for which Turkey is liable, directly or indirectly\".\n\n*Ibid.* at 325; see also *PSEG (Decision on Jurisdiction)*.\n\n280.\n\nIn *Mihaly v. Sri Lanka,* a case better known for its analysis of pre-investment expenditures, the ICSID Tribunal also examined the *locus standi* of the company.\n\nMihaly International Corp., a US company, wanted to build a power plant in Sri Lanka. Eventually, Mihaly instituted proceedings invoking the US-Sri Lanka BIT, looking for reimbursement of its expenditures on the project in its own name and on behalf of its partner, Mihaly (Canada). Sri Lanka denied any awareness of it ever dealing with Mihaly (USA) during negotiations and alleged that Mihaly (USA) had no standing before the tribunal, neither by reason of its partnership with Mihaly (Canada) nor in its capacity as an undisclosed assignee.\n\n281.\n\nThe Tribunal held that Mihaly (USA) was only entitled to file a claim in its own name against Sri Lanka. However, with regards to the claim of rights on behalf of its Canadian partner, the Tribunal did not uphold jurisdiction203:\n\n\"To allow such an assignment to operate in favour of Mihaly (Canada) would defeat the object and purpose of the ICSID Convention and the sanctity of the privity of international agreements not intended to create rights and obligations for non-Parties. Accordingly, a Canadian claim which was not recoverable, nor compensable or indeed capable of being invoked before ICSID could not have been admissible or able to be entertained under the guise of its assignment to the US Claimant. A claim under the ICSID Convention with its carefully structured system is not a readily assignable chose in action as shares in the stock-exchange market or other types of negotiable instruments, such as promissory notes or letters of credit. The rights of shareholders or entitlements of negotiable instruments holders are given different types of protection which are not an issue in this case before the Tribunal. This finding is without prejudice to the right of Mihaly (Canada) to pursue its claims, if any, before another otherwise competent forum\".\n\n*Mihaly* at 24.\n\n**b. Claimants' Counter-Argument**\n----------------------------------\n\n282.\n\nClaimants disagree with the proposal that the Tribunal exceeded its powers by improperly exercising jurisdiction *ratione personae* over the Chinese company Andes.\n\n283.\n\nClaimants' main argument is that there can be no excess of jurisdiction because the Tribunal did not award Andes any damages. The Tribunal simply awarded Claimants the value of their investment, which was 100% of the rights under the Participation Contract. As a matter of international law, the Tribunal had to award Claimants damages reflecting 100% of their investment; it was not entitled to deduct Claimants' liabilities - as reflected in the *Chorz\u00f3w Factory* dictum204.\n\nC I at 480; C II at 281.\n\n284.\n\nThe Committee is not convinced.\n\n285.\n\n(i) First, the Committee has already concluded that Claimants' investment only amounts to 60% of the Farmout Property; for the remaining share of 40% OEPC is holding title as a nominee, acting on behalf of the beneficial owner, AEC/Andes. When the Tribunal awarded Claimants a compensation calculated on the basis of 100% of the value of Block 15, it was assuming jurisdiction over Claimants' alleged ownership rights over a 40% interest in the Farmout Property, disregarding that in accordance with the Farmout Agreements Claimants had transferred those rights to AEC/Andes.\n\n286.\n\n(ii) There is a second argument.\n\n287.\n\nContrary to the Claimants' allegations, the dictum in the *Chorz\u00f3w Factory* decision supports the Committee's position - not that of Claimants'.\n\n288.\n\nThe dictum was first invoked by the Tribunal in its Award205:\n\n\"This principle. has the effect, on the one hand, of excluding from the damage to be estimated, injury resulting for third parties from the unlawful act and, on the other hand, of not excluding from the damage the amount of debts and other obligations for which the injured party is responsible. The damage suffered by the Oberschlesische in respect of the Chorzow undertaking is therefore equivalent to the total value - but to that total only - of the property, rights and interests of this Company in that undertaking, without deducting liabilities \". [Emphasis added, footnote omitted].\n\nAward at 656.\n\n289.\n\nIt stands for the common sense proposition that in the calculation of damages for the taking of assets\n\n- debts and other obligations for which the injured party is responsible should not be excluded, while\n\n- injury resulting to third parties should indeed be excluded.\n\nTo give an example: if a State expropriates a piece of real estate, the mortgage loan which served to finance the acquisition should not be deducted from the fair market value; but if the investor before the expropriation had transferred a 50% share of the property to a third party, the third party's share in the value of the investment must be deducted from the claim for compensation.\n\n290.\n\nIn the present case, the transaction entered into between OEPC and AEC, and formalized in the Farmout Agreements, consisted in the transfer of a 40% interest in the Farmout Property. AEC/Andes became (and has not ceased to be) the beneficial owner of that portion of the Farmout Property (including the Participation Contract), and as beneficial owner AEC/Andes could exercise its ownership rights over the Farmout Property through its nominee. AEC/Andes became a co-owner of the Farmout Property, not a creditor of OEPC.\n\n291.\n\nThe dictum in *Chorz\u00f3w Factory* confirms the Committee's conclusion: as a matter of international law, the Tribunal was precluded from awarding Claimants damages reflecting 100% of the investment, because it was required to exclude from the compensation the injury caused to a third party, who was the beneficial owner of a 40% interest in the expropriated investment.\n\n**c. Effects of the partial Annulment of the Award**\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n292.\n\nThe Committee has decided to partially annul the Award to the extent that the Tribunal has assumed jurisdiction with regard to the investment beneficially owned by the Chinese investor Andes. What remains to be clarified is the precise effect of this finding206.\n\nA question which was intensely debated during the annulment hearing: HT p. 716 *et seq.* (Prof. Mayer), HT p. 980 *et seq.* (Mr. Rivkin).\n\n293.\n\nIn Sub-paragraph (v) of the dispositive section of the Award, the Tribunal made the following decision207:\n\n\"876 [...] (v) Claimants are awarded the amount of US$ 1,769,625,000 (US One billion, seven hundred sixty nine millions, six hundred twenty five thousand dollars), as calculated in paragraph 825 of this Award, for damages suffered as a result of the breaches set out above in subparagraphs (i), (ii) and (iii)\".\n\nAward at 876.\n\n294.\n\nParagraph 825 of the Award reads as follows:\n\n\"825. Having determined earlier that the Claimants' damages should be reduced by a factor of 25% because of their own wrongful act which contributed in a material way to the damages which they subsequently suffered when the *Caducidad* Decree was issued on 15 May 2006, the Claimants' damages for the expropriation by Ecuador of their interest in the Participation Contract amount to US$ 1,769,625,000 (US One billion, seven hundred sixty nine millions, six hundred twenty five thousand dollars) which the Tribunal orders the Respondent to pay\" [Footnote omitted].\n\n295.\n\nRespondent avers that a partial annulment of the Award for excess of powers must lead to an annulment of Sub-Paragraph (v) of the dispositive section of the Award208. The Tribunal concurs. The calculation of damages which underlies the Tribunal's decision is based on the assumption that OEPC is the owner of a 100% interest in the expropriated property. This clearly derives from para. 824 of the Award:\n\n\"824. Using the economic model agreed by Professor Kalt and Mr. Johnston, the Tribunal, informed by all the findings that it has made in the present Section of its Award and assisted by Professor Kalt and Mr. Johnston's agreed calculations, determines that the Net Present Value of the discounted cash flows generated by the Block 15 OEPC production as of 16 May 2006 is US$ 2,359,500,000 (US Two billion, three hundred fifty nine millions and five hundred thousand dollars)\". [Footnote omitted].\n\nHT p. 717-718.\n\n296.\n\nConsequently, the Committee's decision to partially annul the Award must lead to the annulment of the quantification of damages (US$ 1,769,625,000) contained in Sub-paragraph (v) of the dispositive section of the Award to the extent that it compensates the Claimants for 100% (and not for 60%) of the value of Block 15-but not of the rest of such Sub-paragraph.\n\n297.\n\nThe next question to be addressed is whether the Committee is authorized to substitute the annulled figure of damages with the correct number, or whether this task must be entrusted to a new investment tribunal. The parties have discussed this issue, and while Respondent favours the constitution of a new tribunal209, Claimants have accepted that in the proper circumstances annulment committees are authorized to insert correct data in partially annulled decisions210.\n\nHT p. 719-721.\n\nHT p. 980.\n\n298.\n\nThe Committee concurs with Claimants.\n\n299.\n\nIt is true that annulment committees are not empowered to amend or replace awards. But this is not the task at hand. What is required in this case, in which the Committee is partially annulling the Award, is for the Annulment Committee to substitute the Tribunal's figure of damages with the correct one. If this task can be performed without further submissions from the Parties and without additional marshalling of evidence, committees should be entitled to do so. Basic reasons of procedural economy speak in favour of this solution. There is no need for the parties to incur the additional cost and delay of going through a second investment arbitration, when the correct number can be inserted by the annulment committee, after performing a very simple arithmetic calculation and without further input from the parties.\n\n300.\n\nThis is the case in the present arbitration.\n\n301.\n\nThe Tribunal has established the value of 100% Block 15, i.e. of the Farmout Property, at US$ 2,359,500,000. Consequently, the value of a 60% interest would amount to US$ 1,415,700,000. Applying to this amount the 25% reduction factor explained in para. 825 of the Award, the resulting amount is US$ 1,061,775,000. This is the proper amount that should have been inserted in Sub-paragraph (v) of the dispositive section of the Award, reading as follows211:\n\n\"876 [...] (v) Claimants are awarded the amount of US$ 1,061,775,000 (US One billion, sixty one millions, seven hundred and seventy five thousand dollars), as calculated in paragraph 825 of this Award, for damages suffered as a result of the breaches set out above in subparagraphs (i), (ii) and (iii)\".\n\nThe same conclusion could be reached by simply calculating 60% of US$ 1,769,625,000\n\n302.\n\nRespondent has alleged a number of additional grounds for partial annulment of the Tribunal's decision to award damages to OEPC based on a 100% (and not a 60%) interest in the Farmout Property or which pertain to the 60/40 issue. Since these grounds, if accepted, would lead to the same result as the partial annulment already decided by the Committee, they have become moot and need not be further addressed212.\n\nThese grounds include *inter alia* the following:  \n (i) The Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers by, and failed to state the reasons for, declaring inexistent the illegal, unauthorized assignment between Claimants and AEC/Andes (RI, ground 14, para.580; RII, ground 12, para. 582)  \n (ii) The Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers by, after the submission phase of the arbitration had concluded, raising a new argument for Claimants and awarding Claimants US$ 943 million on that argument (RI, ground 12, para. 502; RII, ground 10, para. 392).\n\n**VII. OTHER GROUNDS FOR ANULLMENT**\n------------------------------------\n\n303.\n\nRespondent avers that there are eight additional grounds213 for annulment, three of which should result in the annulment of the entire Award, and four in the annulment of certain parts; there is also an allegation of a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure.\n\nSee R III p. 316.\n\n304.\n\nThe three grounds for total annulment are:\n\n- The decision to apply the principle of proportionality (**1.**);\n\n- The decision that Claimants' violation of the HCL and the Participation Contract was mere negligence (**2.**);\n\n- The decision that Claimants' treaty claims were not defective because this issue was *res iudicata* (**3.**);\n\n305.\n\nThe four grounds for partial annulment of certain parts of the Award are:\n\n- The exclusive use of a DCF model in determining the value of the investment (**4.**);\n\n- The decision to disregard Law 42 when assessing Claimants' damages (**5.**);\n\n- The decision to disregard the VAT Interpretative Law (**6.**);\n\n- The decision to disregard alternatives to *caducidad* when awarding damages (**7.**);\n\n306.\n\nThe alleged serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure affects the Tribunal's email dated February 15, 2011 (**8.**)214.\n\nRespondent alleges that the decision to disregard alternatives to *Caducidad* also implied a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure - R III p. 315.\n\nManifest Excess of Powers\n-------------------------\n\n307.\n\nMost of the grounds for annulment invoked by Respondent are based on the argument that the Tribunal committed a manifest excess of powers by failing to choose the proper law to be applied to the merits.\n\n308.\n\nIt should be remembered that the test for this ground to succeed is very high.\n\n309.\n\nInvestment arbitration case law is unanimous in the conclusion that annulment for failure to choose the proper law applicable to the merits is only permitted if the tribunal totally disregarded applicable law or grounded its award on a law other than the applicable law. The error committed by the tribunal must consist in applying the wrong law, not in wrongly interpreting the correct law. Misinterpretation or misapplication of the proper law to the merits, even if serious, does not justify annulment. Only exceptionally gross or egregious errors of law, acknowledged as such by any reasonable person, could be construed to amount to a failure to apply the proper law, and could give rise to the possibility of annulment215.\n\nSee para 56 *supra.*\n\nFailure to state Reasons\n------------------------\n\n310.\n\nThe same high standard applies to the failure to state reasons, the other ground frequently invoked by Respondent: as long as reasons have been stated, even if incorrect, unconvincing or non-exhaustive, the award cannot be annulled. Only total absence of reasoning or contradictory or frivolous reasons can lead to annulment216.\n\nSee para 65 *supra.*\n\n**1. The Principle of Proportionality**\n---------------------------------------\n\n311.\n\nThe principle of proportionality is one of the cornerstones of the Award. The Tribunal devoted a full section and 35 pages of its analysis to \"The Proportionality of the Sanction for the Unauthorized Transfer of Rights under the Participation Contract217. The Tribunal drew its (in this point unanimous) decision in para 452218:\n\n\"452. It follows that even if OEPC, as the Tribunal found earlier, breached Clause 16.1. of the Participation Agreement and was guilty of an actionable violation of Article 74.11 (or Articles 74.12 or 74.13), the *Caducidad* Decree was not a proportionate response in the particular circumstances, and the Tribunal so finds\".\n\nAward at 384-452.\n\nAward at 452.\n\n**A. Respondent's Position**\n----------------------------\n\n312.\n\nRespondent argues that in an inherently contradictory decision the Tribunal held that *caducidad* was a disproportionate sanction and therefore contrary to Ecuadorian law, customary international law and the Treaty, despite having found\n\n- That in the Participation Agreement the Parties freely agreed that *caducidad* was the applicable sanction if OEPC transferred rights to third parties without approval and\n\n- That OEPC had transferred rights without such approval219.\n\nR I at 386.\n\n313.\n\nThe Award should be annulled because its central holding is that although Ecuador imposed the exact sanction to which Claimants agreed in the Participation Contract, that sanction was disproportionate. Such a holding creates an inescapable conflict with the principle of *pacta sunt servanda* and represents a textbook example of a tribunal acting as *amiable compositeur*220*.*\n\nR II at 286.\n\n314.\n\nIn Respondent's opinion, the Tribunal avoided the application of the Participation Contract, a contract executed after extensive arms-length negotiations between sophisticated parties, and in doing so failed to apply Ecuadorian law and the international law principle of *pacta sunt servanda*221. In fact, what the Tribunal did was to rewrite the Participation Contract222. Where the will of the Parties is clear -as it is with respect to the terms of the Participation Contract - the principle of proportionality has no place223.\n\nR I at 392; R II at 294.\n\nR I at 401-406; R II 310.\n\nR I at 419.\n\n315.\n\nBy purporting to apply a principle of proportionality that is not encompassed in the Participation Contract, Ecuadorian law, the Treaty or customary international law, the Tribunal has manifestly exceeded its powers because:\n\n- The proportionality principle is not referred to in the Participation Contract224;\n\n- There is no proportionality principle which overrides the *pacta sunt servanda* principle neither under Ecuadorian law225 nor under international law226;\n\n- The fair and equitable treatment (\" **FET** \") principle in the Treaty cannot be relied upon to avoid application of the Participation Contract.\n\nR I at 427.\n\nR I at 431; R II at 331.\n\nR I at 452; R II at 319.\n\n316.\n\nThe Tribunal also failed to state the reasons on which it decided to hold Ecuador liable for a breach of the proportionality principle227, and its decision is based on incomprehensible or, at best, frivolous reasons228.\n\nR I at 458, R II at 343.\n\nR I at 466; RII at 350.\n\n**B. Claimants' Position**\n--------------------------\n\n317.\n\nClaimants disagree and recall that on this issue the Tribunal's findings were unanimous229.\n\nC I at 171.\n\n318.\n\nIn Claimants' submission the Tribunal clearly stated its reasons and explained that the proportionality principle exists under applicable Ecuadorian and international law230, that it must be applied to a decision to declare *caducidad*231 and that Ecuador violated that principle when it did so232*.* The Tribunal's reasoning can be followed from point A to point B and to its conclusion and so does not warrant annulment233.\n\nC I at 152.\n\nC I at 160.\n\nC I at 162.\n\nC II at 154.\n\n319.\n\nClaimants aver that the Award provides no basis for annulment: the Award clearly stated the Tribunal's reasons for its decision that the principle is incorporated into the Treaty and into customary international law234 and that the proportionality principle and the *pacta sunt servanda* principle are not in conflict235. Claimants also reject that the reasoning was contradictory, incomprehensible or frivolous236.\n\nC I at 175.\n\nC I at 179.\n\nC I at 185; C II at 164.\n\n320.\n\nAs regards excess of powers - which Claimants analyse separately - the Tribunal applied the proper law when it concluded that the *Caducidad* Decree was a disproportionate sanction in breach of the Treaty, customary international law, Ecuadorian law and the Participation Contract237. Claimants underline that the Tribunal declared *caducidad* on the basis of HCL and not of the Participation Agreements238 and did not rewrite or avoid the application of the Participation Contract or avoid the application of the *pacta sunt servanda* principle239. Neither did the Tribunal decide *ex aequo et bono* when it found that a principle of proportionality exists under international law240.\n\nC I at 397; C II at 169.\n\nC I at 407.\n\nC I at 413.\n\nC I at 418, C II at 171.\n\n**C. The Committee's Decision**\n-------------------------------\n\n321.\n\nThe Committee will analyze Ecuador's argument that the Award should be annulled by first explaining the Tribunal's (unanimous) decision regarding proportionality (**a.**) and then reviewing and ultimately rejecting the Republic's arguments (**b.**).\n\n**a. The Tribunal's Decision regarding Proportionality**\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n322.\n\nThe Tribunal started its analysis of proportionality stating that under Ecuadorian law proportionality is a general principle of administrative law. Relying on the testimony of both Parties' Ecuadorian law experts and on several Ecuadorian law authorities (including the CE, Ecuadorian administrative law and Ecuadorian Supreme Court jurisprudence) the Tribunal found that241\n\n\"398. [\u2026] the Government must weigh the content and purpose of any sanctioning measure with the conduct which has been impugned, and with the loss of rights which the individual will suffer by reason of the intended sanction\" [Footnote omitted].\n\nAward at 398.\n\n323.\n\nThe Tribunal's explanation makes clear that proportionality is a principle to be applied by the Ecuadorian authorities when adopting *actos administrativos* or imposing administrative sanctions. It is not a principle of contract law.\n\n324.\n\nThe Tribunal then added that the principle of proportionality is also commonly applied \"in a variety of international settings\", including the WTO Panel decisions concerning the GATT, decisions of the European Court of Justice, of the European Court of Human Rights and tribunals in international investment disputes242. The proportionality principle is also \"applicable to potential breaches of bilateral investment treaty obligations\", including the FET standard243. Here the Tribunal analyzed and relied on a number of ICSID decisions244.\n\nAward at 402-404.\n\nAward at 404.\n\n*MTD, Tecmed, Azurix* ; Award at 405-409.\n\n325.\n\nThe Tribunal then delved into the precise meaning of proportionality when applied to the imposition by the public administration of a severe penalty like *caducidad*. The Tribunal declared245 :\n\n\"416. [\u2026] In cases where the administration wishes to impose a severe penalty, then it appears to the Tribunal that the State must be able to demonstrate (i) that sufficiently serious harm was caused by the offender; and/or (ii) that there had been a flagrant or persistent breach of the relevant contract/law, sufficient to warrant the sanction imposed; and/or (iii) that for reasons of deterrence and good governance it is appropriate that a significant penalty be imposed, even though the harm suffered in the particular instance may not have been serious\".\n\nAward at 416.\n\n326.\n\nThe Tribunal found that it was ultimately common ground between the parties that the principle of proportionality applied to the present dispute, because a declaration of *caducidad* pursuant to Article 74 HCL is a discretionary administrative sanction and the parties agreed that246\n\n\"where the Minister has a discretion, the principle of proportionality is relevant\".\n\nAward at 425.\n\n327.\n\nOn the evidence presented to it, the Tribunal unanimously concluded that Ecuador had violated the proportionality principle when it declared *caducidad*, because the Minister had other, less traumatic, legal options247, but notwithstanding these alternatives, chose the radical sanction of *caducidad,* which implied the loss of Claimants' total investment, amounting to many hundred millions of US$.\n\nAward at 434.\n\n328.\n\nThis decision was influenced by the fact that OEPC had successfully litigated against the Republic in another investment arbitration, and had secured the so-called VAT Award, which required Ecuador to indemnify OEPC in an amount of more than U$$ 70 M.\n\n329.\n\nThe Tribunal noted that farmout agreements are very common in the oil industry, that Ecuador suffered no harm248, that AEC was already an approved operator in Ecuador249, that some punishment for OEPC's failure to secure the authorization may well have been justified250, but\n\n\"450. [\u2026] the overriding principle of proportionality requires that any such administrative goal must be balanced against the Claimants' own interests and against the true nature and effect of the conduct being censured. The Tribunal finds that the price paid by the Claimants - total loss of an investment worth many hundreds of millions of dollars - was out of proportion to the wrongdoing alleged against OEPC, and similarly out of proportion to the importance and effectiveness of the \"deterrence message\" which the Respondent might have wished to send to the wider oil and gas community\".\n\nAward at 444.\n\nAward at 445.\n\nAward at 450.\n\n330.\n\nThe Tribunal concluded251:\n\n\"452. It follows that even if OEPC, as the Tribunal found earlier, breached Clause 16.1 of the Participation Contract and was guilty of an actionable violation of Article 74.11 (or Articles 74.12 or 74.13), the *Caducidad* Decree was not a proportionate response in the particular circumstances, and the Tribunal so finds. The *Caducidad* Decree was accordingly issued in breach of Ecuadorian law, in breach of customary international law, and in violation of the Treaty. As to the latter, the Tribunal expressly finds that the *Caducidad* Decree constituted a failure by the Respondent to honour its Article II.3(a) obligation to accord fair and equitable treatment to the Claimants' investment, and to accord them treatment no less [favourable] than that required by international law\".\n\nAward at 452.\n\n**b. Review of Respondent's Arguments**\n---------------------------------------\n\n331.\n\nArticle 74 HCL reads as follows:\n\n\"El Ministerio del Ramo podr\u00e1 declarar la caducidad de los contratos, si el contratista:\n\n[...]\n\n11. Traspasare derechos o celebrare contrato o acuerdo privado para la cesi\u00f3n de uno o m\u00e1s de sus derechos, sin la autorizaci\u00f3n del Ministerio;\n\n12. Integrare consorcios o asociaciones para las operaciones de exploraci\u00f3n o explotaci\u00f3n, o se retirare de ellos, sin autorizaci\u00f3n del Ministerio; y\n\n13. Reincidiere en infracciones a la Ley y sus reglamentos\".\n\n332.\n\nArticle 75 HCL provides:\n\n\"La declaraci\u00f3n de caducidad de un contrato implica la inmediata devoluci\u00f3n al Estado de las \u00e1reas contratadas, y la entrega de todos los equipos, maquinarias y otros elementos de exploraci\u00f3n o de producci\u00f3n, instalaciones industriales o de transporte, sin costo alguno para PETROECUADOR y, adem\u00e1s, la p\u00e9rdida autom\u00e1tica de las cauciones y garant\u00edas rendidas seg\u00fan la Ley y el contrato, las cuales quedar\u00e1n en favor del Estado\".\n\n333.\n\nAnd clause 21.1. of the Participation Contract states as follows:\n\n\"21.1. Terminaci\u00f3n: Este Contrato de Participaci\u00f3n terminar\u00e1:\n\n[...]\n\n21.1.1. Por declaratoria de caducidad emitida por el Ministerio del Ramo por las causales y bajo el procedimiento establecido en los art\u00edculos setenta y cuatro (74), setenta y cinco (75) y setenta y seis (78) de la Ley de Hidrocarburos, en lo que sean aplicables;\n\n21.1.2. Por transferir derechos y obligaciones del Contrato de Participaci\u00f3n, sin autorizaci\u00f3n del Ministerio del Ramo\".\n\nThe Alternatives in Case of unauthorized Transfer\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n334.\n\nIn accordance with the HCL and with clause 21.1 of the Participation Contract an unauthorized transfer of the Participation Contract can lead to two different results:\n\n335.\n\n(i) The first alternative is an administrative declaration of *caducidad* by the Ecuadorian administrative authorities *.*\n\n336.\n\nArticle 74 HCL authorizes the Minister, after having observed the appropriate *procedimiento administrativo*252, to adopt an *acto administrativo*, the declaration of *caducidad,* premised on one or more of the grounds set forth in the HCL (not in the Contract) having been met. And one of such grounds is the unauthorized transfer of rights and obligations deriving from the Participation Contract. As a matter of Ecuadorian domestic law, if the holder of the concession contract disagrees with the Minister's *acto administrativo*, it can be appealed before the appropriate *Tribunal contencioso-administrativo*253*.*\n\nSee the reference to the *procedimiento administrativo* in clause 21.1.1. of the Participation Contract.\n\nArticle 173 CE.\n\n337.\n\n*Caducidad* is not a contractual decision; it is an administrative act regulated in the HCL. Clause 21.1.1. of the Participation Contract simply draws the contractual consequences of a *declaraci\u00f3n de caducidad* adopted by the Minister: in that case the Participation Contract - a contract signed between Petroecuador (not the Republic) and OEPC - is terminated.\n\n338.\n\nBut *caducidad* not only provokes the contractual termination of the Participation Contract, it also implies a severe administrative sanction under Article 75 HCL: OEPC is required to turn over to the Government all assets and equipment used for the exploration and production of Block 15, without any compensation, and to forfeit any bonds or guarantees254.\n\nClause 21.2.4 includes a cross-reference to the sanction. But Ecuador's right to take OEPC's Block 15 assets without compensation derives from Art. 75 HCL, not from Clause 21.2.4.\n\n339.\n\n(ii) Unauthorized transfer of the Participation Contract can also lead to a different result: PetroEcuador can choose to exercise its contractual right to terminate the Participation Contract under clause 21.1.2., which provides that if OEPC transfers its rights and obligations without ministerial authorization, the Participation Contract can be terminated by a decision adopted by PetroEcuador (not by the Republic). This decision is contractual in nature, does not constitute an *acto administrativo,* and any dispute with regard thereto must be adjudicated in accordance with the arbitration clause contained in such Contract.\n\n340.\n\nContractual termination by PetroEcuador leads to ordinary restitution under civil law - it does not result in OEPC's obligation to turn over all Block 15 assets to the State without compensation255.\n\nSee clause 21.2.4 in relation to clause 21.4.\n\nEcuador's Decision\n------------------\n\n341.\n\nIn the present case the Republic opted for the first alternative: after having followed the appropriate administrative procedure, which included OEPC's right to be heard, the Minister adopted an *acto administrativo* declaring *caducidad*, the *Caducidad* Decree. The issuance of the Decree produced the sanction provided for in Article 75 HCL: OEPC was forced to turn over to the public administration all Block 15 assets, which represented investments amounting to many hundred millions of US$, without any compensation.\n\n342.\n\nAgainst this factual and legal backdrop Ecuador is arguing\n\n- That the application of the proportionality principle is in contradiction with the *pacta sunt servanda* principle, and that the Tribunal rewrote the Participation Contract to insert the proportionality principle;\n\n- That in the Participation Contract the parties had agreed that the declaration of *caducidad* by the Minister would automatically lead to termination, and where the will of the parties is clear, there is no place for proportionality.\n\nThe Committee's Decision\n------------------------\n\n343.\n\nEcuador's arguments fail, being based on a wrong understanding of what the Tribunal decided and what the Parties agreed upon.\n\n344.\n\nIn its Award the Tribunal decided that both Ecuadorian and international law require that when administrative authorities adopt decisions to sanction citizens, they must apply the principle of proportionality, weighing the severity of the sanction against various factors (which include the harm caused and the nature of the violation), in order to avoid that the irregular behaviour of the citizen be sanctioned with a disproportionate penalty.\n\n345.\n\nAfter\n\n- noting a close connection between the VAT Award (which required the Republic to pay a significant indemnity to OEPC) and the declaration of *caducidad* and the existence of \"ill-feeling against OEPC\" in Ecuador,\n\n- establishing that Ecuador had suffered no harm as a consequence of the violation,\n\n- taking into account that Ecuador could have imposed a less drastic sanction and indeed had done so in past similar violations, the Tribunal, weighing the available evidence, found that the *caducidad* decision \"was not a proportionate response in the particular circumstances\"256.\n\nAward at 442-452.\n\n346.\n\nThe Tribunal has convincingly reasoned and explained its decision. But even if the reasoning had been less convincing, the weighing of evidence and the eminently factual evaluation of whether an administrative decision is or not proportional, form part of the Tribunal's prerogatives, which under Article 52 of the Convention, as a general rule, fall outside the remit of an *ad hoc* committee.\n\n347.\n\nThere is a further argument: the Tribunal's finding is also perfectly consistent with the Parties' agreement (under clause 21.1.1 of the Participation Contract) that a declaration of *caducidad* would result in termination of the Contract. That clause can only refer to a properly adopted declaration of *caducidad*, not to one which was taken in contravention of Ecuadorian law. The clause does not imply - as Ecuador seems to say- that OEPC consented that any declaration of *caducidad,* however adopted, could result in termination and loss of all assets without compensation.\n\n348.\n\nA simple *reductio ad absurdum* proves the point: assume that the Minister's declaration had been adopted with *desviaci\u00f3n de poder* or with corruption. Clause 21.1.1. cannot be construed as OEPC's *ex ante* acceptance that a declaration of *caducidad*, even if adopted under such irregularities, would legitimatize the termination of the Contract and seizure of assets without compensation *.*\n\nInexistence of the Principle of Proportionality in applicable Law\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n349.\n\nEcuador also argues that the Tribunal has manifestly exceeded its powers because the principle of proportionality is allegedly not encompassed in the Participation Contract, Ecuadorian law, or in customary international law.\n\n350.\n\nThe argument cannot succeed, because the standard for annulment in allegations of misapplication or misinterpretation of law applicable to the merits is especially high: only exceptionally gross or egregious errors of law could be construed to amount to a failure to apply the proper law to the merits, and could give rise to the possibility of annulment257. The Tribunal has not committed any gross or egregious error of law. To the contrary: the Tribunal has convincingly explained that the principle of proportionality between intensity and scope of the illicit activity, and severity of the sanction is a general principle of punitive and tort law, both under Ecuadorian and under international law.\n\nSee para 56 *supra.*\n\nFailure to state Reasons\n------------------------\n\n351.\n\nThe Committee has summarized the Tribunal's reasoning on this issue in the preceding sub-section258. The reasoning can be followed from point A to point B and to the Tribunal's decision. Respondent's argument that the Tribunal failed to state the reasons on which it decided to hold Ecuador liable for a breach of the proportionality principle, or that its decision is based on incomprehensible or, frivolous reasons, fails.\n\nSee para 342 *et seq. supra.*\n\n**2. The Finding of Negligence**\n--------------------------------\n\n**A. Respondent's Position**\n----------------------------\n\n352.\n\nRespondent argues that the Tribunal failed to state the reasons on which it based its decision and manifestly exceeded its powers when it held that Claimants were merely negligent in failing to disclose the true nature of the Farmout Agreement to Ecuador and to obtain ministerial authorization in 2000. This finding allegedly had a case-determinative effect on the Tribunal's holding in relation to two key issues, the proportionality of the *Caducidad* Decree and Claimants' appropriate percentage of fault259.\n\nR I at 333.\n\n353.\n\nRespondent adds that the Tribunal's analysis is self-contradictory. The Tribunal labeled Claimants' conduct as negligent, but described it precisely in intentional, not negligent terms260. The Tribunal created a new kind of violation of the HCL (a merely negligent one) and then concluded that Ecuador had acted disproportionally in declaring *caducidad*261. In so doing, the Tribunal ignored uncontroverted evidence262, misapplied Ecuadorian law263, provided no reasons264 and contradicted many of its own findings in other parts of the Award265. The Tribunal also failed to state reasons, the finding of negligence remaining unexplained266 and self-contradictory267.\n\nR I at 343.\n\nR I at 348.\n\nR I at 349.\n\nR I at 350.\n\nR I at 351.\n\nR I at 354.\n\nR II at 267.\n\nR II at 271.\n\n354.\n\nEcuadorian law distinguishes between conduct that is *\"dolosa\"* and conduct that is *\"culposa\"* (with three different levels of *\"culpa\"*) - but the Tribunal never mentioned, much less applied, the standard of care that governed Claimants' conduct under Ecuadorian law268. The Tribunal simply averred that OEPC was negligent because it lacked bad faith - without any analysis, consideration, reference or mention of the legal standard under Ecuadorian law269. And the Tribunal's determination of negligence affected both the finding of lack of proportionality and the issue of quantum270.\n\nR II 235, 236.\n\nR II at 237.\n\nR II 240-244; 245-253\n\n355.\n\nThe Tribunal's determination that OEPC negligently breached the Participation Contract and violated the HCL ignores settled Ecuadorian law, which does not take into account the actor's intent when evaluating or determining a violation of the HCL. Thus the Tribunal manifestly failed to apply Ecuadorian law and international law, and acted *ex aequo et bono*271*.*\n\nR II at 254.\n\n**B. Claimants' Position**\n--------------------------\n\n356.\n\nClaimants first line of defense is that the Committee should not consider this ground for annulment for two reasons:\n\n- Factual findings are not reviewable in an annulment; and the Tribunal's negligence finding was a factual finding272;\n\n- Furthermore the finding only affected two issues on which Ecuador prevailed: the dismissal of Claimants' legitimate expectations claim and the determination of contributory fault by OEPC, which resulted in a reduction of the amount of damages by 25%273.\n\nC II at 129.\n\nC II at 132.\n\n357.\n\nIn addition, Claimants submit that the foundation of Ecuador's argument is wrong. The Tribunal did not artificially create a new kind of violation of the HCL - a merely negligent one274. Nor did the Tribunal identify negligence as a factor in its proportionality analysis, let alone a determinative one275. Instead, the Tribunal based its argument that the *Caducidad* Decree lacked proportionality on three findings:\n\n- That Ecuador suffered no harm;\n\n- There existed in Ecuador ill feeling against OEPC; and\n\n- Ecuador could have imposed less drastic sanctions276.\n\nC I at 115-116; C II at 134.\n\nC I at 117.\n\nC I at 118.\n\n358.\n\nFurthermore, the Tribunal clearly stated the reasons for its finding that Claimants did not act in bad faith but were merely negligent277, and in its conclusion that the *Caducidad* Decree was a disproportionate sanction in breach of the Treaty, customary international law and the Participation Contract278. The Tribunal's reasoning can be followed from point A to point B and so does not warrant annulment279.\n\nC I at 123-147.\n\nC I at 148-169.\n\nC II at 141-142.\n\n**C. The Committee's Decision**\n-------------------------------\n\n359.\n\nThe Committee will analyze Ecuador's argument that the Award should be annulled by first explaining the Tribunal's (unanimous) decision regarding the finding of negligence (**a.**) and then reviewing and ultimately rejecting the Republic's arguments (**b.**).\n\n**a. The Tribunal's Decision regarding Negligence**\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n360.\n\nIn essence, Ecuador's ground for annulment is based on one single word, used by the Tribunal in one single paragraph of the Award - paragraph 380.\n\n361.\n\nParagraph 380 reads as follows:\n\n\"380. The Tribunal reiterates its conclusion. As the Tribunal's analysis of the Farmout Agreements earlier in this Award has demonstrated, the Claimants' interpretation of the Farmout Agreement was wrong. However, the Tribunal does not consider, as the Respondent has argued, that it was made in bad faith. The Claimants' failure to seek ministerial authorization was a mistake, a serious mistake, but it was not done in bad faith. Should Paul MacInnes and his colleagues, during their visit with Minister Ter\u00e1n on 24 October 2000, have given him a copy of the Farmout Agreement and the Joint Operating Agreement so that his advisors could have formed their own opinion about the true nature of the transaction? As stated earlier, the Tribunal has no hesitation in answering its own question in the affirmative. OEPC and AEC were negligent in not doing so. But again, the Tribunal does not find that failure to do so amounted to bad faith. They may have been negligent but there was no intention on their part to mislead. They were simply convinced that they were right and acted accordingly without seeking to mislead the Ecuadorian government. In a number of instances, in the fall of 2000, they revealed publicly in Ecuador that they had entered into a farmout transaction with AEC\". [Emphasis added].\n\n362.\n\nThis paragraph concludes a very long section (Section 2) entitled \"OEPC's Duty to obtain Authorization for the Transfer of Rights under the Participation Contract\", devoted to a detailed analysis of Claimants' failure to request authorization for the execution of the Farmout Agreements from the Ecuadorian government. In paragraph 380 the Tribunal \"reiterates the conclusions\" to be drawn from the preceding section; these conclusions are eminently factual and consist of the following three findings:\n\n- That Claimants' failure to seek ministerial authorization was a serious mistake;\n\n- That Claimants were \"negligent\" when they failed to deliver a copy of the Farmout Agreements at the visit to the Ecuadorian Minister;\n\n- That there was however no bad faith and no intention to mislead.\n\nLegal consequences\n------------------\n\n363.\n\nThe Tribunal's factual findings gives rise to two legal consequences:\n\n364.\n\n(i) The first consequence is drawn by the Tribunal in paragraph 383, which provides as follows280:\n\n\"[...] Having concluded above that OEPC's failure to secure the required authorization on the part of the Ecuadorian authorities in October 2000, while not amounting to bad faith, was negligent, the Tribunal considers that the Claimants cannot be found to have had a legitimate expectation that the Minister would not exercise his discretion and impose *caducidad* \".\n\nAward at 383.\n\n365.\n\nIn the Tribunal's opinion, Claimants' negligence leads to the forfeiture of any legitimate expectation that the Minister would not exercise his sanctioning powers and decree *caducidad.*\n\n366.\n\n(ii) The second consequence is drawn in the following section (Section 3) entitled \"The Proportionality of the Sanction for the unauthorized Transfer of Rights under the Participation Contract\". The section starts at paragraph 384, in which the Tribunal once again reiterates its factual findings:\n\n\"384. The Tribunal has found that the Farmout Agreement and the Joint Operating Agreement operated to effect a transfer of rights under the Participation Contract from OEPC to AEC. The Tribunal has also found that this transfer required authorization on the part of the Ecuadorian authorities, that this authorization was not sought, but that OEPC's failure to secure such authorization in October 2000, while imprudent and ill advised, did not amount to bad faith\"[Emphasis added].\n\n367.\n\nIt is worth noting that in this summary of facts, the Tribunal drops the expression \"negligent\", and substitutes it with \"imprudent\". The use of this synonym shows that the Tribunal never gave a precise legal meaning to the concepts \"negligent\" or \"imprudent\" - they were used as convenient adjectives to describe Claimants' conduct. Contrary to Respondent's allegation, the Tribunal never had the intention of creating a new kind of violation of the HCL - a merely negligent one.\n\n368.\n\nAfter this summary of its previous findings, contained in paragraph 384, the Tribunal devotes a 35 page long discussion281 to the legal issue of proportionality, reaching the conclusion that the sanction of *caducidad* imposed by the Government was a disproportionate punishment for Claimants' wrongdoing, for three reasons:\n\n- because Ecuador suffered no harm,\n\n- because there was ill feeling against OEPC arising from its success in securing the VAT Award, and\n\n- because the Republic had the alternative of imposing less drastic sanctions282.\n\nAward at 385-452.\n\nAward at 442-452.\n\n369.\n\nThe Tribunal's finding that OEPC's conduct had been \"imprudent\", \"negligent\" and \"ill advised\", but did not amount to \"bad faith\", is not mentioned *expressis* *verbis* among the reasons canvassed by the Tribunal to justify its disproportionality conclusion. The Tribunal however refers to Claimants' negligent or imprudent conduct in paragraph 384, the first of the proportionality section, as a \"preliminary Observation\"; thus, it is very likely that this factual finding weighed in the Tribunal's mind when it decided that the *caducidad* was a disproportionate sanction.\n\n**b. Review of Respondent's Arguments**\n---------------------------------------\n\n370.\n\nThe Republic argues that the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers when it held that Claimants were merely negligent in failing to disclose the true nature of the Farmout Agreement to Ecuador and to obtain ministerial authorization and failed to state the reasons on which it based its decision. Claimants disagree: in their submission, the Tribunal's findings were purely factual, only related to issues on which Ecuador prevailed, and were properly reasoned.\n\n371.\n\nThe Committee has already noted that as a general rule factual findings and weighing of evidence made by tribunals are outside the scope of review of *ad hoc* committees - an exception could only be allowed if the applicant can prove that the errors of fact committed by the Tribunal are so egregious as to give rise to one of the grounds for annulment listed in Article 52(1) of the Convention283.\n\nSee para 47 *supra.*\n\n372.\n\nIn paragraphs 380, 383 and 384 of the Award the Tribunal finds that the Claimants, although they failed to request the necessary authorization, did not act in \"bad faith\", that they \"may have been negligent, but there was no intention on their part to mislead\", and that their failure to secure the authorization \"while imprudent and ill advised, did not amount to bad faith\".\n\n373.\n\nThese are all factual findings, which the Tribunal adopted after having reviewed the extensive evidentiary record, heard the witnesses and weighed the available evidence. The Tribunal is best placed to perform this task, and its conclusions should not be second-guessed by an *ad hoc* committee - save in exceptional circumstances, when the errors of fact committed by the tribunal are so egregious as to give rise to one of the grounds for annulment established in Article 52(1) of the Convention.\n\nNo exceptional Circumstances\n----------------------------\n\n374.\n\nThis exception is clearly not applicable in the present case.\n\n375.\n\nThe reasoning used by the Tribunal in reaching its conclusion that Claimants acted negligently, but not in bad faith, is straightforward and easy to follow:\n\n- There was a \"debate within the ranks of OEPC as to whether or not ministerial authorization was necessary\"284 and \"the two camps within OEPC had sound and valid reasons\"285;\n\n- \"[T]he mutual waiver executed by OEPC and AEC on 31 October 2000 [...] confirms the prevailing OEPC and AEC view that no governmental approval was required for the transfer of the 40% economic interest. This waiver is consistent with Version A [of the draft letter], the script of the first three paragraphs of the 25 October letter but not with the fourth paragraph of that letter\"286. \"That paragraph is misleading. The Tribunal does not believe that OEPC intended to mislead Minister Ter\u00e1n but that nevertheless was the result of the imprecise wording\"287;\n\n- \"[O]n 1 November 2000, OPC issued a press release. That news release is wholly inconsistent with the theory of the Respondent that the Claimants wanted to conceal the transaction\"288;\n\n- Claimants were \"simply convinced that they were right and acted accordingly without seeking to mislead the Ecuadorian government\"289;\n\n- \"In a number of instances in the fall of 2000 [Claimants] had revealed publicly in Ecuador that they had entered into a Farmout transaction with AEC. When they realized that their behaviour, and in particular the last paragraph of their 25 October letter, created confusion within the Ministry, they tried to dissipate that confusion\"290;\n\n- \"Claimants' interpretation of the Farmout Agreement was wrong. However, the Tribunal does not consider, as the respondent has argued, that it was made in bad faith\"291;\n\nAll these arguments lead the Tribunal to the following conclusion292:\n\n\"OEPC's failure to secure the required authorization on the part of the Ecuadorian authorities in October 2000, while not amounting to bad faith, was negligent\".\n\nAward at 343.\n\nAward at 345.\n\nAward at 363.\n\nAward at 360.\n\nAward at 364.\n\nAward at 380.\n\nAward at 380.\n\nAward at 380.\n\nAward at 383.\n\n376.\n\nAgainst this background, Respondent's annulment request cannot succeed.\n\n377.\n\nContrary to Ecuador's submission, the Tribunal did not fail to give reasons, its analysis is not self-contradictory, and the Tribunal most certainly did not create a new kind of violation of the HCL. The Tribunal simply made a judgmental analysis of Claimants' conduct, and for the reasons clearly explained in the Award, concluded that OEPC had not acted with bad faith, but simply imprudently or negligently. The Committee understands this conclusion to mean that OEPC had not acted with gross negligence which is commonly regarded as amounting to or equivalent to bad faith, but had acted only with simple imprudence or negligence. It then applied this factual finding to justify the dismissal of OEPC's legitimate expectations claim, and it was also taken into consideration (among other reasons) when it analyzed the proportionality test.\n\n378.\n\nThere is no basis for an annulment. Ecuador's ground for annulment is dismissed.\n\n**3.** ***R******es***  ***I******udicata***\n--------------------------------------------\n\n379.\n\nClause 22.2.1. of the Participation Contract reads as follows:\n\n\"En el caso de controversias que pudieren surgir a causa de la aplicaci\u00f3n de este Contrato de Participaci\u00f3n, la Contratista, de acuerdo con la legislaci\u00f3n del Ecuador, renuncia de manera expresa a utilizar la via diplom\u00e1tica o consular, o a recurrir a cualquier \u00f3rgano jurisdiccional nacional o extranjero no previsto en este Contrato de Participaci\u00f3n, o a un arbitraje no reconocido por la ley ecuatoriana o no previsto en este Contrato de Participaci\u00f3n. El incumplimiento de esta disposici\u00f3n ser\u00e1 motivo de caducidad de este Contrato de Participaci\u00f3n\".\n\n380.\n\nIn the jurisdictional phase of the procedure, Respondent made and the Tribunal dismissed a jurisdictional challenge, arguing that clause 22.2.1. of the Participation Contract implied an agreement that *caducidad* related disputes be exclusively solved by the Ecuadorian administrative courts. In paragraph 70 of the Decision on Jurisdiction, the Tribunal stated its decision:\n\n\"70. The Tribunal agrees with the Claimants regarding the interpretation of Clause 22.2.1 of the Participation Contract. The Tribunal does not accept that, by virtue of this provision, the parties agreed that *caducidad* -related disputes under the Participation Contract would solely be resolved by submission to the Ecuadorian administrative courts, *i.e.* the TCA. This is simply not what the clause says\".\n\n381.\n\nThe defense that claims must be first submitted to the Ecuadorian administrative courts was again brought up by Ecuador in the merits phase of the arbitration. In the Award, the Tribunal dismissed the argument with the following reasoning293:\n\n\"291. [\u2026] The Claimants were legally obliged, says the Respondent, to pursue a local challenge to the *Caducidad* Decree before the courts in Ecuador.\n\n292. In brief, the Claimants answer that this is a \"recycled\" version of the jurisdictional argument advanced by the Respondent in its jurisdictional challenge which has been dismissed by the Tribunal in its Decision on Jurisdiction and which is now being \"reincarnated\" as a merits defense.\n\n293. The Tribunal agrees with the Claimants. The matter is *res judicata* \".\n\nAward at 291-293.\n\n382.\n\nThe Award then made a cross-reference to paragraph 70 of the jurisdictional Decision (quoted above), and summarily came to the following conclusion294:\n\n\"296. This disposes of the Respondent's preliminary objection which is dismissed\".\n\nAward at 296.\n\n**A. Respondent's Position**\n----------------------------\n\n383.\n\nEcuador avers that Claimants did not seek a reasonable resolution of the *caducidad* claims in the Ecuadorian administrative courts before submitting their Request for Arbitration; instead they filed such Request almost immediately295. This fact has given rise to two successive defenses, in the jurisdictional phase first and then in the merits phase.\n\nR I at 323.\n\n384.\n\nIn its merits argument Ecuador submits, as a substantive matter, that Claimants' treaty claims must be dismissed, because the Minister's *Caducidad* Decree does not rise to the level of an international treaty breach, Claimants having failed to first challenge the declaration in the Ecuador administrative courts296. Respondent argues that when the Tribunal dismissed this argument in its Award, it manifestly exceeded its powers and failed to state reasons.\n\nR I at 315.\n\n385.\n\nRespondent adds that the defense that a treaty claim is defective on the merits is distinct from a jurisdictional objection that the claim is not admissible for failure to exhaust administrative remedies.\n\n386.\n\nThe Tribunal rejected Ecuador's argument on the mistaken basis that it was the same argument that Ecuador had raised during the jurisdictional phase. Without any reasoning or analysis, the Tribunal stated, in conclusory fashion, that the matter is *res iudicata.* I n holding so, the Tribunal failed to discuss the applicable law governing *res iudicata* and the case law presented by Respondent297, and also whether Ecuador's defense was indeed barred by that doctrine298. The Tribunal's interpretation of the principle of *res iudicata* was egregiously incorrect, and the error was so grave as to be tantamount to a manifest excess of powers299. The absence of any rationale or, at best, the merely perfunctory nature of the reasons on this point makes it impossible for the reader to follow the Tribunal's reasoning300.\n\nR I at 326.\n\nR I at 329.\n\nR II at 218.\n\nR II at 229.\n\n**B. Claimants' Position**\n--------------------------\n\n387.\n\nClaimants aver that the arguments presented by Ecuador in the jurisdictional and merits phase were indistinct. They relied on exactly the same premise, that the State should be afforded the opportunity to review the egregious conduct, made the same arguments and used the same authorities301. In the Award, the Tribunal again dismissed the recycled objection, referring to *res iudicata*, with the meaning that it had already considered and decided this issue302. The Tribunal did state its reasons for dismissing Ecuador's recycled jurisdictional objection; it had been argued previously and dismissed and consequently it was *res iudicata*303*.*\n\nC I at 103-104.\n\nC I at 107.\n\nC II at 111.\n\n388.\n\nIn any case, the Tribunal' s invocation of *res iudicata* was proper, because there was sufficient identity of grounds, Ecuador's submissions in both the jurisdictional and merits phase being founded on the same holdings from the same, inapplicable, case law. If the Tribunal had not unanimously rejected Ecuador's arguments as *res iudicata*, and had once again dealt fully in the Award with Ecuador's repetitive argument, there is no reason to believe that the Tribunal would have come to a different conclusion than it did in the Decision on Jurisdiction304.\n\nC I at 385.\n\n**C. The Committee's Decision**\n-------------------------------\n\n389.\n\nThis annulment ground revolves around the issue whether Claimants, as a precondition to filing their *caducidad* related claims in the investment arbitration, were forced to submit such claims to adjudication by the Ecuadorian administrative courts.\n\n390.\n\nThe issue was brought up by Respondent in the jurisdictional phase of the arbitration. It gave rise to the so-called first Jurisdictional Objection. The Tribunal rejected it, arguing that Ecuador could not rely on its domestic law to evade ICSID arbitration305, and that the parties had not agreed that *caducidad* related claims would solely be resolved by submission to the Ecuadorian administrative courts306.\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction at 86-88.\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction at 70.\n\n391.\n\nIn the merits phase Ecuador brought up the same argument again. It argued that307:\n\n\"291. [...] Claimants' Treaty claims are \u2018substantially defective' even if the Tribunal has jurisdiction over these claims because \u2018the act of the Minister in issuing the *Caducidad* Decree cannot attach responsibility to the State as a substantive matter when there was a mechanism available for review of that act, which the investor simply failed to invoke'\".\n\nAward at 291.\n\n392.\n\nThe Tribunal dismissed Ecuador's objection with little difficulty, holding that:\n\n- Ecuador's attempt to require Claimants to pursue their claims in Ecuador's local courts was a \"recycled\" version of its jurisdictional objections that had been \"reincarnated as a merits defense\"308;\n\n- The Tribunal had already \"stated very clearly\" that it rejected Ecuador's argument that Claimants were required to bring their claims to local Ecuadorian courts prior to bringing their claims before ICSID309;\n\n- Thus the Tribunal had already \"dispose[d] of the Respondent's preliminary obj ection\"310;\n\n- Therefore the Tribunal agreed with Claimants that Ecuador's attempt to re-litigate its claims was barred by \" *res iudicata\".*\n\nAward at 292-293.\n\nAward at 294.\n\nAward at 296.\n\n393.\n\nThe reasoning can be followed from point A to point B and to its conclusions, to use the MINE test311, and therefore does not justify annulment, because the reader \"can understand how the tribunal arrived at its conclusion\"312.\n\nSee para 48 *supra.*\n\n*Caratube,* at 102.\n\n394.\n\nRespondent avers that the Tribunal's decision to refer to the principle of *res iudicata* was egregiously incorrect, and the error was so grave as to be tantamount to a manifest excess of powers. This is not so. The principle of *res iudicata* is a characteristic feature of most domestic legal systems, but it is also an important principle of international law313. In its Decision on Jurisdiction the Tribunal had already dismissed Ecuador's argument that the proper forum to adjudicate any *caducidad* dispute was the Ecuadorian administrative courts. In the merits phase of the procedure Ecuador chose to bring up the same argument again - thinly disguised as a merits defence. The Tribunal was perfectly entitled to summarily reject it, reasoning that the same defence had already been conclusively rejected in the Decision on Jurisdiction.\n\n*Indalsa* at 86.\n\n395.\n\nThe ground for annulment is dismissed.\n\n**4. DCF Model as exclusive Valuation Methodology**\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n396.\n\nThe Tribunal, having established that Ecuador had breached the Treaty, turned to the quantification of the losses suffered by OEPC. As a first step, the Tribunal determined that a DCF valuation was the proper methodology to establish the value of Block 15314:\n\n\"708. The Tribunal is of the view that, in this case, the standard economic approach to measuring the fair market value today of a stream of net revenues (*i.e*., gross revenues minus attendant costs) that can be earned from the operation of a multi-year project such as OEPC's development of Block 15 is the calculation of the present value, as of 16 May 2006, of the net benefits, or \"discounted cash flows\".\n\nAward at 708.\n\n397.\n\nThe Tribunal then described how it would approach the task of valuing OEPC's assets315:\n\n\"709. Using a DCF model as the starting point for measuring FMV, the Tribunal further observes that the analytical framework for determining FMV in the present circumstances requires several steps. These steps are clearly summarized by the Respondent. The Claimants agree. They are:\n\n(a) Determination of the size of the reservoir [\u2026];\n\n(b) Creation of a production profile [\u2026];\n\n(c) Assignment of risk adjustment factors [\u2026];\n\n(d) Application of a price forecast [\u2026]; and\n\n(e) Application of a discount rate [\u2026]\".\n\nAward at 709.\n\n398.\n\nIn subsequent sections the Tribunal analyzed the different steps, determined the proper inputs into the DCF model and asked both parties' experts to run the DCF model using those inputs. Having done that, the Tribunal reached the conclusion that the fair market value of Claimants' expropriated assets amounted to US$ 2,359 M316 - a figure which was then reduced by 25% due to Claimants' contributory fault.\n\nAward at 824.\n\n399.\n\nThe Tribunal also analyzed the possibility of using other valuation techniques:\n\n400.\n\nFirst it referred to the comparable sales methodology, noting that \"[t]he Respondent submits that the examination of comparable sales is also critical \u2018because it allows the evaluator to test the reasonableness of the DCF assumptions against market conditions'\", while \"Claimants maintain that it is inappropriate\"317. The Tribunal found in favour of Claimants318:\n\n\"787. Having considered the parties' arguments and the evidence of their respective witnesses and experts, the Tribunal agrees with the Claimants that \"each oil and gas property presents a unique set of value parameters\". Therefore, the Tribunal concludes that it can derive no assistance from an analysis of the seven transactions which the Respondent has submitted as comparable sales\".\n\nAward at 780-781.\n\nAward at 787.\n\n401.\n\nSecond, the Tribunal also addressed the EnCana sale of 2005 as a separate comparable transaction319, coming to the conclusion that it was \"an inapt choice for a comparable analysis\", because it was contaminated by the *caducidad* decision320, because oil prices had moved and because it included non-Block 15 assets321.\n\nAward at 784.\n\nAward at 785-786.\n\nAward at 788.\n\n**A. Respondent's Position**\n----------------------------\n\n402.\n\nRespondent argues that the Award should be annulled, because the Tribunal failed to state the reasons for basing itself exclusively on a DCF model to determine the fair market value of OEPC's investment322, notwithstanding Ecuador (and its expert) repeatedly insisted that any such analysis should be both vetted and corroborated with three other valuation methods323 :\n\n- Comparable sales analysis,\n\n- Actual sales data and\n\n- Pay-out consideration324.\n\nR I at 491.\n\nR II at 377.\n\nR II at 380.\n\n403.\n\nEcuador does not dispute that the Tribunal examined and rejected the \"comparable sales data\" methodology presented by Ecuador's expert. However, according to Respondent, the two other alternative valuation methods advanced by it were not similarly addressed, and were dismissed without a single reason325. Given that Ecuador had urged the Tribunal to corroborate any DCF analysis with other methods of valuation, such *lacuna* in the Tribunal's reasoning requires that its decision on damages be annulled326.\n\nR II at 387.\n\nR II at 389.\n\n404.\n\nThis is Ecuador's first argument.\n\n405.\n\nThe Republic advances a second argument why the Award should be annulled: the Tribunal contradicted itself, initially stating that it would use the DCF model \"as a starting point for measuring FMV\"327, but then valuing Claimants' investments exclusively on the basis of a DCF model328.\n\nAward at 709.\n\nR II at 390.\n\n**B. Claimants' Position**\n--------------------------\n\n406.\n\nClaimants disagree. In their opinion the Tribunal did not fail to state reasons for its decision to exclusively use a DCF analysis in determining the value of OEPC's investment329. The Tribunal's reasoning can be followed from point A to point B and to its conclusions, and so does not warrant annulment330.\n\nC I at 190.\n\nC II at 195.\n\n407.\n\nClaimants then address Respondent's specific reasons for requesting annulment.\n\n408.\n\nThe first reason alleged by Ecuador is that the Tribunal did not expressly reject every argument presented by the Republic: the Award did not address, and dismissed without a single reason, two alternative valuation methods proposed by Ecuador, actual sales data and pay-out consideration.\n\n409.\n\nClaimants disagree: according to their submission the Tribunal did consider and expressly rejected the actual sales data methodology, i.e. the data deriving from the EnCana sale. Thus, the only alternative valuation method that the Tribunal did not expressly reject was pay-out consideration, which the Republic had mentioned only in a mere paragraph in each of its pre-hearing written pleadings and not at all in its post-hearing brief on quantum331. This is - in Claimants' submission - not a ground for annulment.\n\nC II at 202-203.\n\n410.\n\nSecond, Claimants advance that the Tribunal did not contradict itself, because it never stated that the DCF model was \"a starting point\" to be followed by consideration of alternative valuation methods. It is impossible to identify any genuine contradiction in the Tribunal's reasoning on damages that could warrant annulment332.\n\nC II at 206-207.\n\n**C. The Committee's Decision**\n-------------------------------\n\n411.\n\nThis ground for annulment is based exclusively on an alleged failure to state reasons.\n\n412.\n\nIn this case, the failure to state reasons alleged by Ecuador refers to the Tribunal's quantum determination. Annulment of quantum decisions face an additional hurdle: *ad hoc* committees have consistently held that tribunals have a wide margin of discretion with respect to the calculation of damages333.\n\n*Duke Energy* at 256; *Rumeli* at 146, *Vivendi II* at 255; *Wena* at 91.\n\nEcuador's specific Request\n--------------------------\n\n413.\n\nThe starting point of Respondent's ground for annulment is the methodology chosen by the Tribunal to establish quantum - a DCF model:\n\n- The Tribunal justified its choice arguing that \"the standard economic approach to measuring the fair market value today [\u2026] of Block 15 is the calculation of the present value, as of 16 May 2006, of the net benefits or \u2018discounted cash flows'\"334;\n\n- It then added that DCF methodology was \"the economically appropriate and reliable measure of the cumulative economic harm suffered by the Claimants as a consequence of the contract termination\"335;\n\n- That \"the discounted cash flow method is the most widely used and generally accepted method in the oil and gas industry for valuing sales or acquisitions\"336;\n\n- And came to the conclusion that supplementing the DCF model with comparable sales analysis would be inappropriate and unreliable, because \"each oil and gas property presents a unique set of value parameters\"337; Respondent's expert had acknowledged \"the difficulty in finding truly comparable situations\"338; and \"the comparable sales approach of the Respondent's expert [\u2026] is unreliable in this case\"339;\n\n- Finally the Tribunal added the EnCana sale was not a useful comparable because of contamination due to the possible issuance of the *Caducidad* Decree340, differences in the price of oil and the inclusion of non-Block 15 assets341.\n\nAward at 708.\n\nAward at 708.\n\nAward at 779.\n\nAward at 787.\n\nAward at 782.\n\nAward at 783.\n\nAward at 786.\n\nAward at 788.\n\n414.\n\nEcuador does not dispute that the Tribunal's findings are properly reasoned. Its line of argument for seeking annulment is more nuanced:\n\n415.\n\nFirst, the Republic argues that the Tribunal failed to examine two alternative valuation methods advanced by Ecuador (actual sales data and pay-out consideration), which were dismissed without a single reason342. This failure to address particular arguments advanced by the Respondent should lead to the annulment of the damages calculation and of the Award *in toto*343.\n\nR II at 387.\n\nR II at 389.\n\n416.\n\nRespondent's argument is factually wrong. As the Claimants have correctly averred, the Tribunal did address and ultimately reject the application of the actual sales data deriving from the EnCana sale344. Thus the only alternative valuation method that the Tribunal did not expressly reject was pay-out consideration, an obscure methodology which Respondent had briefly mentioned in its pre-hearing written pleadings and had failed to include in its post-hearing brief on quantum345.\n\nAward at 786, 788.\n\nDoc. EEA 180; C II at 203.\n\n417.\n\nTribunals do not have the duty to address every single argument advanced by each party. Only case-decisive arguments must be answered. Respondent has failed to prove that the application of pay-out consideration, as an alternative methodology to complement the valuation resulting from DCF methodology, was a case-decisive argument, that would lead to a significant modification of the compensation to be awarded. The fact that Respondent failed to refer to pay-out consideration in its final and conclusive quantum brief seems to indicate the contrary: that Ecuador itself was of the opinion that it lacked materiality for the Tribunal's compensation decision.\n\n418.\n\nThere is a second argument which is being advanced by the Respondent: it submits that there is a contradiction in the Award, because in paragraph 709 the Tribunal states that it will be \"using a DCF model as a starting point for measuring FMV\", while in fact the Award established the value of the investment exclusively on the basis of a DCF model.\n\n419.\n\nThe argument is without merit. The Tribunal never stated that the DCF model was \"a starting point\" to be followed by consideration of alternative valuation methods. The Award speaks for itself.\n\n420.\n\nThe ground for annulment is dismissed.\n\n**5. The Decision to disregard Law 42 when assessing Claimants' Damages**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n421.\n\nIn March 2006 the President of the Republic submitted to the Ecuadorian Congress a bill proposing an amendment to the HCL. On 19 April 2006 the bill was passed and became Law 42. This new law added the following provision to the HCL:\n\n\"Las compa\u00f1\u00edas contratistas que mantienen contratos de participaci\u00f3n para la exploraci\u00f3n y explotaci\u00f3n de hidrocarburos vigentes con el Estado ecuatoriano de acuerdo con esta Ley, sin perjuicio del volumen de petr\u00f3leo crudo de participaci\u00f3n que les corresponde, cuando el precio promedio mensual efectivo de venta FOB de petr\u00f3leo crudo ecuatoriano supere el precio promedio mensual de venta vigente a la fecha de suscripci\u00f3n del contrato y expresado a valores constantes del mes de la liquidaci\u00f3n, reconocer\u00e1n a favor del Estado ecuatoriano una participaci\u00f3n de al menos el 50% de los ingresos extraordinarios que se generen por la diferencia de precios. Para los prop\u00f3sitos del presente art\u00edculo, se entender\u00e1 como ingresos extraordinarios la diferencia de precio descrita multiplicada por el n\u00famero de barriles producidos.\n\nEl precio del crudo a la fecha del contrato usado como referencia para el c\u00e1lculo de la diferencia, se ajustar\u00e1 considerando el \u00cdndice de Precios al Consumidor de los Estados Unidos de Am\u00e9rica, publicado por el Banco Central del Ecuador\".\n\n422.\n\nLaw 42 thus obliged concessionary companies to pay to the Ecuadorian state 50% of their \" *ingresos extraordinarios* \", such term being defined as the number of barrels produced multiplied by the increase in the price of crude, at the time when the concession was granted and when the oil was produced.\n\n423.\n\nIn quantifying the value of Claimants' losses that resulted from Ecuador's breaches, the Tribunal needed to consider whether Law 42 should be factored into the calculations. The Tribunal devoted a 26-page long section to this issue346 and came to the following conclusion347:\n\n\"547. For all the foregoing reasons, the Tribunal will disregard Law 42 for the purpose of its valuation of the quantum of the Claimants' damages\"\n\nAward at 465-547.\n\nAward at 547.\n\n424.\n\nArbitrator Prof. Stern dissented348 and reached the opposite conclusion349:\n\n\"13. As a result of the foregoing, I consider that Law 42 should have been taken into account in the calculation of damages \". [Emphasis in the original]\n\nDissent at 9-13.\n\nDissent at 13.\n\n425.\n\nThe impact of Law 42 in the valuation of OEPC's assets is very substantial; the non-application reduces the value of the assets by at least US$ 816 M350, although the actual impact could be higher351.\n\nMr. Garc\u00eda Represa for Respondent, HT p. 236:5.\n\nR I at 719.\n\n**A. Respondent's Position**\n----------------------------\n\n426.\n\nRespondent argues that the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers (**a**) and failed to state reasons (**b**) on which it based its decision to assume jurisdiction over Law 42 matters and to disregard the Law 42 levy when assessing Claimants' damages. In total Respondent lists 11 different reasons which in its opinion should lead to annulment.\n\n**a. Excess of Powers**\n-----------------------\n\n427.\n\nRespondent lists five reasons why the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers:\n\n428.\n\nFirst, the Tribunal refused to consider whether under international law, Law 42 was a \"matter of taxation\", and as such excluded from the Tribunal's jurisdiction pursuant to Article X.2 of the Treaty. Instead, the Tribunal decided to apply Ecuadorian law to conclude that Law 42 was not \"a matter of taxation\" and hence was not excluded from j urisdiction352. This, in and of itself, is sufficient to warrant annulment of the Award, as shown in several prior annulment decisions353.\n\nR I at 723.\n\nR II at 669.\n\n429.\n\nEcuador then criticizes the Tribunal's additional argument that \"even if Law 42 were a tax\", it \"would be captured by the \u2018exception to the exception' of Article X.2(c)\" because \"the Participation Contract [\u2026] in the opinion of the tribunal is an investment agreement\"354. The Respondent disagrees with the Tribunal and submits that the Participation Contract cannot be characterized as an investment agreement, and that the Tribunal failed to state reasons and committed a manifest excess of powers, for failure to undertake the mandate entrusted to it355 and for failure to consider and apply the applicable law, ruling instead as an *amiable compositeur*356*.*\n\nR I at 744-749, citing Award at 497-499.\n\nR I at 728.\n\nR II 677.\n\n430.\n\nSecond, the Tribunal expressly refused to apply international law when it disregarded the international law principle according to which \"States are not liable to pay compensation to a foreign investor when, in the normal exercise of their regulatory powers, they adopt in a nondiscriminatory manner *bona fide* regulations that are aimed at the general welfare\"357, merely on the basis of a re-written Participation Contract358.\n\nAward fn 65.\n\nR I at 729.\n\n431.\n\nThird, the Tribunal also manifestly exceeded its powers by failing to apply the international law principle according to which, absent an express and specific stabilization undertaking by the State, the fair and equitable treatment standard does not include a legitimate expectation that the State will not amend its laws and regulations359. The Tribunal's unreasoned refusal to follow the well-known international law principle on the sole basis that the Participation Contract (which does not include any stabilization clause and moreover expressly provides for the application of new fiscal measures in Clauses 8.6 and 11.11) would somehow \"fetter the State's exercise of its regulatory powers\", constitutes a manifest excess of powers360.\n\nR I at 731.\n\nR II at 682.\n\n432.\n\nFourth, the Tribunal also manifestly exceeded its powers when it effectively disregarded the plain text of Law 42 (in particular Article 2), distinguishing between \"participation in volumes\" of crude oil (guaranteed by clause 8.1. of the Participation Contract and unaffected by Law 42) and \"participation in revenues\" obtained by the concessionary (impacted and reduced by Law 42, but not guaranteed by the Participation Contract) to conclude that Ecuador had breached the Participation Contract361. Several *ad hoc* committees have found an annullable error where a tribunal, like in the present circumstances, failed to abide by the ordinary meaning of the term of the legal instrument it purports to interpret and apply362.\n\nR I at 735.\n\nR II at 694.\n\n433.\n\nFifth, the Tribunal failed to apply the international law standard for determining the FMV of Block 15 (the willing buyer/willing seller standard) and thereby manifestly exceeded its powers363.\n\nR I at 739.\n\n**b. Failure to state reasons**\n-------------------------------\n\n434.\n\nRespondent says that the Tribunal failed to state reasons or provided directly contradictory reasons (equivalent to no reasons) in order to avoid applying Law 42 to its calculation of the compensation:\n\n435.\n\nSixth, the Tribunal defined Law 42 as a \"unilateral decision of the Ecuadorian Congress to allocate to the Ecuadorian State a defined percentage of revenues earned by contractor companies such as OEPC that hold participation contract\"364, while only one paragraph earlier it contradicted itself when it held that Law 42 \"is neither a royalty, a tax, a levy or other measure of taxation under the Participation Contract\"365. The contradiction could not be more glaring, as the definition provided by the Tribunal of Law 42 is exactly that of a tax measure366.\n\nAward at 510.\n\nAward at 509.\n\nR I at 742.\n\n436.\n\nSeventh, in seeking to retain jurisdiction over Law 42 faced with Article X.2 of the Treaty, the majority failed to give any reasons whatsoever for holding that \"even if Law 42 were a tax\" it \"would be captured by the \u2018exception to the exception' of Article X.2(c)\". The Tribunal's entire reasoning is found in a single sentence367: \"the Participation Contract [\u2026] in the opinion of the tribunal is an investment agreement\". This conclusion is simply asserted or postulated instead of being reasoned. It fails to even mention Ecuador's contrary arguments and prevents the reader from following the Tribunal's reasoning from point A to point B and eventually to its conclusion368.\n\nAward 497-499; R I at 749.\n\nR II at 717.\n\n437.\n\nEighth, the Tribunal acknowledged that the Participation Contract guaranteed OEPC a participation in the production of crude, but also found that \"by taking 50% of OEPC's revenues [Law 42] modified radically the participation percentages agreed in Clause 8.1\"369. If Clause 8.1, as the Tribunal held, allocates only crude production and not revenues, it is simply impossible to follow the Tribunal's rationale for concluding that Law 42's taking of a percentage of revenues constitutes a breach of clause 8.1370.\n\nAward at 523.\n\nR I at 751.\n\n438.\n\nIt was not disputed in the underlying arbitration that Clause 8.1's participation formula allocates only crude production to OEPC (not revenues) and that OEPC continued to receive, even after the enactment of Law 42, all of the crude production resulting from the application of Clause 8.1. Accordingly, how can a law taxing revenues breach a contractual clause allocating crude volumes371?\n\nR I at 753\n\n439.\n\nNinth, the Award fails to state reasons for why, after Claimants abandoned their argument that Law 42 somehow breached Clause 5.3.2. of the Participation Contract (contractor's right to freely dispose of it participation in barrels), the Tribunal found that such breach had occurred372. Respondent acknowledges that the Tribunal gave reasons for one breach of the Contract - the breach relating to Clause 8.1. But a single reasoning cannot cure the Tribunal's failure to state reasons for all other breaches373.\n\nR I at 757.\n\nR II at 735.\n\n440.\n\nTenth, the Tribunal failed to state reasons for why the introduction of Law 42, aside from the contractual framework, implied a unilateral and substantial modification of the \" legal framework that existed at the time the Claimants negotiated and agreed the Participation Contract [... ]\"374. The Award is notably silent as to what the legal framework supposedly modified was, since not a single provision of Ecuadorian law is cited in support of the majority's finding375.\n\nAward at 525, R I at 758.\n\nR II at 737.\n\n441.\n\nFurthermore, the Tribunal did not address the implications of the Constitutional Court's upholding of Law 42's legality, which included a response to arguments of breach of contract376.\n\nR II at 741.\n\n442.\n\nEleventh, the Award failed to state the reasons for its holding that Law 42 flouts Claimants' legitimate expectations, in addition to a breach of the Participation Contract, considering that the FET standard does not equate to the stabilization of the legal framework377.\n\nR II at 742.\n\n**B. Claimants' Position**\n--------------------------\n\n443.\n\nClaimants submit that Ecuador's submission on Law 42 belie its true complaint: that the Tribunal decided against Ecuador, not that the Tribunal committed annullable errors. Ecuador grossly distorts the true factual and procedural background and none of its complaints have any merit, let alone constitute annullable errors378.\n\nC I at 270-271.\n\n**a. Excess of powers**\n-----------------------\n\n444.\n\nIn Claimants' opinion the Tribunal did not manifestly exceed its powers by failing to apply the proper law, when it decided to disregard Law 42 for the purposes of valuing Claimants' investment:\n\n445.\n\nFirst, Ecuador claims that the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers by refusing to consider whether under international law, Law 42 was a matter of taxation for purposes of the Treaty. The Claimant avers that the Tribunal did not refuse to do so, because it analyzed whether Law 42\n\n\" is [...] a tax, a royalty, a levy or, more generally, a \u2018matter of taxation' under the Treaty [...]\"379\n\nand came to the conclusion that it is not380.\n\nAward at 487, emphasis added.\n\nC II at 310.\n\n446.\n\nBesides, Ecuador feigns ignorance of its own prior confirmation in the VAT Agreement of the Tribunal's jurisdiction regarding Law 42. Ecuador cannot, on the one hand, agree in a contract that the Tribunal has jurisdiction over Law 42 and now contend that the Tribunal's confirmation of that jurisdiction is a manifest error381.\n\nC II at 309.\n\n447.\n\nFinally, Ecuador also ignores the Tribunal's unequivocal conclusion that Law 42, even if it was a matter of taxation, would be captured by the exception to the exception of Article X.2.(c) of the Treaty. Ecuador had consistently asserted, over the course of the VAT Arbitration and the appeal of the VAT Award, that the Participation Contract constituted an investment agreement within the meaning of the Treaty. The evidence contained in the VAT Award showing that Ecuador has consistently treated the Participation Contract as an investment agreement is \"implicit in the considerations and conclusions contained in the Award\" - to use the phrase coined by the *Wena* committee382.\n\n*Wena* at 81, C II at 293.\n\n448.\n\nSecond, Ecuador says that the majority refused to apply international law when it disregarded the international law principle that States are not liable to pay compensation when adopting in the normal exercise of regulatory powers non discriminatory *bona fide* regulations aimed at the general welfare. In fact what happened was that the Tribunal decided that, on the facts of the case, the principle offered Ecuador no defense. Ecuador improperly challenges the merit of that conclusion383.\n\nC I at 531.\n\n449.\n\nThird, Ecuador complains that the Tribunal exceeded its powers by failing to apply the principle according to which, absent a stabilization undertaking, the FET standard does not include a legitimate expectation that the State will not amend its laws and regulations. Again, this complaint has nothing to do with a manifest excess of powers; it exclusively pertains to the merits of the Tribunal's decision. The Tribunal held that because Claimants relied upon Ecuador's specific representations, Claimants' legitimate expectations were protected by the Treaty. Ecuador may disagree with this finding of fact, but it cannot take its annulment case any further384.\n\nC I at 534.\n\n450.\n\nFourth, Ecuador complains that the Tribunal disregarded the plain text of Law 42, which distinguishes between participation in volumes of crude oil and participation in revenues obtained by the concessionary.\n\n451.\n\nIn Claimants' opinion this merits contention has no place in an annulment procedure. In any event, on the substance of the argument, Ecuador is clearly wrong. The Tribunal understood that Law 42 nominally mandated Ecuador to take cash rather than crude, but it had the effect of radically diminishing Claimants' participation in crude by taking 50% of its gross revenues from the sale of that participation in the crude oil. Clause 8.2. of the Participation Contract defines Claimants' gross revenue simply as the market value of Claimants' participation in crude. It cannot be controversial that a measure taking away half of the market value of crude will effectively take away the crude that yields that market value. The Tribunal rejected Ecuador's nonsensical proposition that Law 42 did not affect Claimants' rights under the Participation Contract, because Law 42 seized the cash representing the crude's market value rather than the physical crude itself.385\n\nC I at 542-543.\n\n452.\n\nFifth, the Republic says that the Tribunal failed to apply the international law standard for determining FMV - the willing buyer/willing seller standard. This again is a rank appeal of the Tribunal's merits findings and offers no conceivable ground for annulment386. The Tribunal accepted Claimants' reasoning that a State cannot reduce its liability on the basis of a wrongful act, such as Law 42. It explained that \"a valuation tool like the willing buyer analogy cannot override that principle\"387.\n\nC I at 535.\n\nAward at 541.\n\n**b. Failure to state Reasons**\n-------------------------------\n\n453.\n\nSixth, there is nothing contradictory in the Tribunal's finding that Law 42 is a \"unilateral decision of the Ecuadorian Congress to allocate to the Ecuadorian State a defined percentage of revenues earned by contractor companies such as OEPC that hold participation contract\"388 and its finding, on the other hand, that Law 42 is \"neither a royalty, a tax, a levy or any other measure of taxation under the Participation Contract\"389.\n\nAward at 510.\n\nAward at 509.\n\n454.\n\nIn the course of the procedure, Ecuador itself submitted categorically that Law 42 is not a tax, because it had not been enacted in accordance with the special legislative procedures reserved for taxes under Ecuadorian Law. Its present position is a stunning about-face390.\n\nC I at 275.\n\n455.\n\nEcuador's complaint is in essence that the Award erred in the application of international law - which is beyond the review of this Committee. When the Award analyzed whether Law 42 \"is a tax, a royalty, a levy or, more generally, \"a matter of taxation\" under the Treaty\"391, it applied international law392.\n\nAward at 487.\n\nC II at 310.\n\n456.\n\nSeventh, even if Law 42 were a tax, the Tribunal clearly stated that it would be captured by the exception to the exception set forth in Article X.2.(c) of the Treaty, because the Participation Contract is an investment agreement.\n\n457.\n\nEcuador's criticism of the Tribunal's decision in this regard is not just baseless it is also astoundingly misleading. Ecuador asserted for the first time in its Post-Hearing Brief on Law 42 that the Participation Contract was not an investment agreement. Previously and consistently Ecuador had taken the position over a decade of arbitration and appellate proceedings that Claimants' Participation Contract did constitute an investment agreement within the meaning of Article VI of the Treaty. The argument was specifically made in the course of the VAT Arbitration and Award, which form parts of the factual matrix considered by the Tribunal.\n\n458.\n\nEighth, the Tribunal stated its reasons for concluding that Law 42, by taking 50% of gross revenues above the reference price, constituted a breach of Clause 8.1, modified the contractual and legal framework and frustrated Claimants' expectations. There is no inconsistency between the Tribunal's reference to Claimants' contractual rights to receive a participation in the production of crude oil and its statement that Law 42 takes 50% of OEPC's revenues. What Ecuador calls an inconsistency is in fact the Tribunal's considered rejection of Ecuador's unsustainable argument that the Participation Contract allowed Ecuador to deprive Claimants of an economic benefit of their contractually agreed participation in crude (*i.e.* its revenue) as long as it did not physically seize that participation in crude (*i.e.* the volume of crude)393.\n\nC I at 290-291.\n\n459.\n\nNinth, Ecuador complains that Claimants withdrew their Clause 5.3.2. claim and that the Award does not include the reasons relied upon by the Tribunal to address a claim previously abandoned. Claimants did not do so, nor did the Award find that the Claimants withdrew this claim. The Award cannot be required to provide reasons for considering a withdrawn claim when no claim was withdrawn394.\n\nC II at 297.\n\n460.\n\nTenth, Ecuador's argument that the Award did not provide reasons for finding that Law 42 modified the legal framework at the time when the Participation Contract was executed is equally invalid. It is obvious that the introduction of a law that did not exist at the time the Participation Contract was entered into and which unilaterally modified the parties' bargain is a change of the legal framework395.\n\nC II at 298.\n\n461.\n\nEcuador now further states that the Tribunal failed to assess the implications of the Constitutional Courts decision, which referred to the breach of contract argument. However, Ecuador had specifically argued in the arbitration that the Tribunal did not need to consider the lawfulness of Law 42396. Besides, Ecuador has not established that the constitutionality of Law 42 is pivotal or outcome determinative397.\n\nC I at 298; Doc. EEA -184 Ecuador's Post-Hearing Brief on Law 42, para 37 *et seq*.\n\nC II at 300.\n\n462.\n\nEleventh, Ecuador alleges that the Award failed to state reasons for finding that, in addition to a breach of the Participation Contract, Law 42 flouted the Claimants' legitimate expectations. The Award stated its reasons: \"the investor, OEPC, was justified in expecting that this contractual framework would be respected and certainly not modified unilaterally by the Respondent\"398.\n\nAward at 526, C II at 301.\n\n**C. The Committee's Decision**\n-------------------------------\n\n463.\n\nThe Committee will analyze this ground for annulment by summarizing the Tribunal's decision regarding Law 42 (**a.**), the Republic's arguments for requesting the annulment (**b.**) and then adjudicating the jurisdictional objection (**c.**) and the application of Law 42 in the DCF model (**d.**).\n\n**a. The Tribunal's decision regarding Law 42**\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n464.\n\nIn April 2006, a month before the expropriation of Claimants' investment in Block 15, the Republic adopted Law 42, which modified the HCL in two aspects:\n\n- First it created a new category of income for the State related to the exploration and exploitation of crude deposits called the \" *participaci\u00f3n* *del Estado en los excedentes de los precios de venta de petr\u00f3leo* \"399 (\" **state Participation** \");\n\n- Then it defined the obligation of concessionary companies to acknowledge in favour of the Ecuadorian State (\" *reconocer\u00e1n a favor del Estado* *Ecuatoriano* \") a State Participation equal to 50% of the \" *ingresos extraordinarios que se generen por la diferencia de precios* \". And such \" *diferencia* \" is calculated by multiplying the number of barrels produced by the difference between crude oil prices at the time of execution of the contract and present market prices400.\n\nArticle 44 HCL, as amended by Law 42.\n\nArticle 55 HCL, as amended by Law 42.\n\n465.\n\nWhat is the legal nature of the State Participation created by Law 42?\n\n466.\n\nLaw 42 does not clarify the issue. The Ecuadorian legislator adopted a policy of calculated ambiguity, expressed in the choice of the term \" *participaci\u00f3n* \", a novel concept which had not been used either in the HCL nor in the Participation Contract, and which does not seem to have a specific legal meaning under Ecuadorian law. The ambiguity continued during the arbitration and was reflected by the Tribunal in the Award401:\n\n\"The Tribunal recalls that the Respondent, throughout the Hearing on Quantum, was loath to characterize Law 42\".\n\nAward at 489.\n\n467.\n\nThe legal nature of the State Participation is especially relevant in order to establish the Tribunal's jurisdiction, because Article X (2) of the Treaty limits the jurisdiction of investment tribunals in \"matters of taxation\". Article X (2) reads as follows:\n\n\"2. Nevertheless, the provisions of this Treaty, and in particular Article VI and VII, shall apply to matters of taxation only with respect to the following:\n\n(a) expropriation, pursuant to Article III;\n\n(b) transfers, pursuant to Article IV; or\n\n(c) the observance and enforcement of terms of an investment agreement [...]\". [Emphasis added].\n\n468.\n\nArticle X (2) thus excludes from the jurisdiction of an investment tribunal any \"matter of taxation\", except if the \"exception to the exception\" applies: that the investment consists in an investment agreement and the dispute relates to its observance and enforcement.\n\n469.\n\nWhen confronted with the Law 42 argument, the Tribunal faced two distinct issues:\n\n- The first was whether it had jurisdiction at all to address any Law 42 matter (**i**), and\n\n- The second, whether it should deduct the amounts accruing under the Law 42 levy in favour of the Republic, from the DCF model (thus reducing the compensation by more than US$ 800 M) (**ii**).\n\n(i) The jurisdictional Challenge\n--------------------------------\n\n470.\n\nThe argument that the Tribunal's jurisdiction could be affected by Law 42 only became relevant at a very late stage of the arbitration; it was at the Hearing on Quantum when the Respondent402\n\n\"488. [\u2026] for the first time in these proceedings, claimed that \"the question of Law 42 is excluded from the Arbitral Tribunal's jurisdiction in accordance with Article 10 of [the] Treaty\". In effect, as will be seen, the Respondent was now adopting the position that Law 42 was a \"matter of taxation\" [Footnote omitted].\n\nAward at 488.\n\n471.\n\nRecalling that at the Hearing on Quantum the Respondent had categorically submitted that Law 42 \"is not a tax\", because it did not follow the special procedures required in the Constitution403, the Tribunal came to the conclusion that the State Participation was not a tax404:\n\n\"509. For purposes of characterizing Law 42, it is sufficient for the Tribunal to conclude, as it now does, that the participation of Ecuador under Law 42 \"in surplus from oil sales prices not agreed upon or not foreseen,\" is neither a royalty, a tax, a levy or any other measure of taxation under the Participation Contract\".\n\nAward at 490.\n\nAward at 509.\n\n472.\n\nBut then *adcautelam* the Tribunal added a second argument405:\n\n\"497. [\u2026] even if Law 42 were a tax, it would not, in the opinion of the Tribunal, create a jurisdictional barrier to the Claimants' Law 42 claim under the Treaty for the following reasons\".\n\nAward at 497.\n\n473.\n\nThe Tribunal then explained its reasoning406:\n\n\"499. The Tribunal is of the view that Law 42, even if it was characterized as a \"matter of taxation\", would be captured by the \"exception to the exception\" of Article X.2(c) of the Treaty. The dispute between the parties, in the present arbitration, relates directly to the observance and enforcement of the terms of the Participation Contract which, in the opinion of the Tribunal, is an investment agreement under Article VI(1)(a) of the Treaty\".\n\nAward at 499.\n\n474.\n\nWith this \"belt and braces\" double reasoning, the Tribunal dismissed Respondent's jurisdictional objection.\n\n(ii) The Impact of Law 42 on the Compensation\n---------------------------------------------\n\n475.\n\nThe Tribunal then analysed the impact - if any - of Law 42 on the calculation of compensation owed to OEPC and came to the following conclusions:\n\n476.\n\nThe Tribunal first examined the contractual bargain negotiated by the parties when they executed the Participation Contract, and concluded thus:\n\n\"522. It is clear to the Tribunal that, in the Participation Contract, the Claimants knowingly accepted the risk of losses on its investment in case of a low price scenario and the Respondent knowingly forewent the opportunity to increase its participation in case of a high price scenario. This was the bargain which was struck by the parties and which was reflected in the Participation Contract\".\n\n477.\n\nThen it analysed the impact of Law 42 on this contractual bargain, and found that the State Participation \"struck at the very heart of OEPC's acquired rights under the Participation Contract\"407, because408\n\n\"525. [\u2026] with the introduction of Law 42, the Respondent modified unilaterally and in a substantial way the contractual and legal framework that existed at the time the Claimants negotiated and agreed the Participation Contract and thereby violated Clauses 5.3.2 and 8.1 of the Participation Contract\".\n\nAward at 523.\n\nAward at 525.\n\n478.\n\nThe Tribunal made the following legal inferences409:\n\n\"527. In conclusion, Law 42 is in breach of the Participation Contract and flouts the Claimants' legitimate expectations. It is, as a result, in breach of the Respondent's Article II.3(a) Treaty obligation to accord fair and equitable treatment to the Claimants' investment and the Tribunal so finds\".\n\nAward at 527.\n\n479.\n\nThe Tribunal also addressed Respondent's argument, that any willing buyer wishing to value the FMV of the Participation Contract, would have used the existence of Law 42 as a factor to obtain a reduction of the price to be paid. The Tribunal rejected the argument, accepting Claimants' reasoning that410\n\n\"541. [...] a State cannot reduce its liability for wrongful act [here, expropriation/disproportionate sanction via *caducidad* ] on the basis of another wrongful act [applying Law 42 to OEPC in breach of the Participation Contract][...] *A valuation tool like the willing buyer analogy cannot override that principle* \". [Emphasis in the original].\n\nAward at 541.\n\n**b. Summary of Respondent's Arguments**\n----------------------------------------\n\n480.\n\nEcuador submits 11 grounds for the (partial) annulment of the Award, based on alleged abuse of powers in five cases, and on failure to state reasons in the remaining six, arguing that the Tribunal lacked jurisdiction to address disputes relating to Law 42 and that it erred when it decided to deduct the State Participation mandated by Law 42 from the DCF model.\n\n481.\n\nThe Committee will analyze first the grounds for annulment based on a jurisdictional objection (**c**. *infra*) and then the remaining grounds affecting the use of Law 42 in the DCF valuation (**d**. *infra*). This distinction is relevant, because the powers of *ad hoc* committees are quite different in one scenario and in the other:\n\n- The primary concept of excess of powers refers to situations where a tribunal adjudicates disputes not included in the powers granted by the parties; if a Tribunal exceeds its jurisdiction and such excess is manifest, its decision cannot stand.\n\n- The situation is quite different if a tribunal having jurisdiction adopts an erroneous decision that is said to exceed its powers; in this secondary concept of abuse of powers, annulment requires that the error committed by the tribunal consisted in applying the wrong law (not of wrongly interpreting the correct law) or that the error amounts to a gross or egregious error of law - a much more onerous test than in a case of primary excess of powers411.\n\nSee paras 55-56 *supra.*\n\n**c. The Jurisdictional objection**\n-----------------------------------\n\n482.\n\nArticle X (2) and of Article VI (1) of the Treaty read as follows:\n\n\"Article X.2.\n\nNevertheless, the provisions of this Treaty, and in particular Article VI and VII, shall apply to matters of taxation only with respect to the following:\n\n(a) expropriation, pursuant to Article III;\n\n(b) transfers, pursuant to Article IV; or\n\n(c) the observance and enforcement of terms of an investment agreement\n\n[...]\"\n\n\"Article VI.1.\n\nFor purposes of this Article, an investment dispute is a dispute between a Party and a national or company of the other Party arising out of or relating to (a) an investment agreement between that Party and such national or company;\n\n(b) an investment authorization granted by that Party's foreign investment authority to such national or company; or (c) an alleged breach of any right conferred or created by this Treaty with respect to an investment\". [Emphasis added].\n\nThe Tribunal's Award\n--------------------\n\n483.\n\nIn the past Ecuador consistently argued that the Participation Contract was an investment agreement for the purposes of Article VI of the Treaty. The argument was employed in the VAT arbitration to support Ecuador's claim that the Treaty's fork in the road provision should apply to OEPC's VAT claim. For this reason Ecuador argued in the VAT Arbitration and before the English High Court and the English Court of Appeal that the Participation Contract was an investment agreement. As the High Court confirmed412,\n\n\"Ecuador argued that the claims of OEPC before the Quito courts related to an investment agreement between Ecuador (via PetroEcuador) and OEPC, and so fell within the terms of Article VI(1)(a) of the BIT\".\n\nCAA 73 at 111, C I at 288.\n\n484.\n\nThe VAT Arbitration is relevant to this arbitration: the Tribunal expressly listed the VAT Arbitration and Respondent's appeal of the VAT Award in its description of the factual matrix considered by the Tribunal in its Award413.\n\nAward at 108, 170-172.\n\n485.\n\nIn the Hearing on Quantum Ecuador changed its position and for the first time claimed that the Tribunal lacked jurisdiction to address any Law 42 dispute, because the State Participation created by such Law was a \"matter of taxation\" excluded by Article X (2) of the Treaty from the jurisdiction of investment arbitration tribunals, and because the \"exception to the exception\" did not apply.\n\n486.\n\nIn the Award, the Tribunal dismissed Respondent's jurisdictional challenge, concluding that the State Participation created by Law 42 was not a \"matter of taxation\"414. But the Tribunal did not stop there, and added the following alternative reason:\n\n\"499. The Tribunal is of the view that Law 42, even if it was characterized as a \"matter of taxation\", would be captured by the \"exception to the exception\" of Article X.2(c) of the Treaty. The dispute between the parties, in the present arbitration, relates directly to the observance and enforcement of the terms of the Participation Contract which, in the opinion of the Tribunal, is an investment agreement under Article VI(1)(a) of the Treaty\".\n\nAward at 509.\n\n487.\n\nSumming up, the Tribunal rejected the jurisdictional challenge based on a main and on an alternative reason:\n\n- The main reason being that in the Tribunal's opinion Law 42 was not a matter of taxation,\n\n- And the alternative reason that the dispute affected the observance and enforcement of an investment agreement and consequently fitted within the \"exception to the exception\",\n\nboth reasons being independent from each other, and the validity of one reason sufficing to establish jurisdiction415.\n\nAward at 499.\n\nRespondent's Claims for Annulment\n---------------------------------\n\n488.\n\nRespondent claims that the Tribunal erred when it dismissed the jurisdictional challenge, and that the error affected both the main and the alternative reasons.\n\n489.\n\nAs regards the alternative reason, the so called \"exception to the exception\", Ecuador asserts that in the present case neither of the two conditions required by Article X of the Treaty was met:\n\n- the Participation Contract was not an investment agreement for the purposes of Article VI of the Treaty, because its clause 22.1.4 did not specifically refer to Article 30 of the 1997 Investment and Protection Act - allegedly a requirement of Ecuadorian law for a contract to be considered as an investment agreement;\n\n- furthermore, the dispute did not relate to the observance and enforcement of the terms of an investment agreement416.\n\nDoc. EEA 184 at 154; R I at 748.\n\n490.\n\nRespondent's claim for annulment is supported by three grounds:\n\n- First, the decision implies a manifest excess of powers, because it amounts to a failure on the part of the Tribunal to undertake the mandate entrusted to it417;\n\n- Second, there is also a manifest excess of powers because the Tribunal failed to apply the proper law and ruled instead as an *amiable* *compositeur*418;\n\n- Third, the Tribunal failed to give reasons for its finding419.\n\nR I at 728.\n\nR II at 677.\n\nR II at 717.\n\nThe Committee's Decision\n------------------------\n\n491.\n\nFor convenience the Committee will start its analysis with the alternative reason, *i.e.* with the Tribunal's decision in para. 499 of the Award, establishing that the \"exception to the exception\" applied, thus creating jurisdiction to adjudicate Law 42 matters.\n\n492.\n\nThe \"exception to the exception\" revolves around the issue whether the Participation Contract could be considered an \"investment agreement\" for the purposes of Article X (2) of the Treaty. This provision includes a cross reference to Article VI (1) (a), which describes an investment agreement as an agreement between a State and a national or company of the other State. The Treaty thus establishes three requirements for the existence of an \"investment agreement\":\n\n- That there is an \"agreement\",\n\n- That it relates to an \"investment\", and\n\n- That it is executed between a State and a national of the other contracting State.\n\n493.\n\nThe Tribunal reasonably found that the \"exception to the exception\" provided for in Article X (2) was applicable:\n\n- It first found that the Participation Contract indeed is an investment agreement under Article VI(1)(a) of the Treaty, *i.e.* that it meets the three requirements set forth in that Article: (i) that it is an agreement, (ii) that it formalizes an investment and (iii) that it binds Ecuador (through PetroEcuador) with a U.S. investor;\n\n- It then found that the dispute relates directly to the observance and enforcement of the terms of the Participation Contract; and this is indeed so, because the Tribunal's main conclusion as regards the merits was that\n\n\"Law 42 is in breach of the Participation Contract and flouts the Claimants' legitimate expectations\"420.\n\nAward at 527.\n\n494.\n\nThe Tribunal thus justified and reasoned that the two requirements set forth in Article X (2) of the Treaty for the \"exception to the exception\" to apply, namely\n\n- the execution of an investment contract, and\n\n- the existence of a dispute which refers to the observance and enforcement of the terms of the investment contract,\n\nhad been duly met. In so doing, the Tribunal did not fail to undertake the mandate entrusted to it, it certainly did not act as an *amiable compositeur* and it did not fail to reason its decision.\n\n495.\n\nThe Tribunal failed to address Respondent's argument that the Participation Contract did not constitute an investment agreement, because it lacked an allegedly required reference to a specific Ecuadorian law. But this failure can never lead to annulment. Tribunals have a duty to justify their decision - not to address every single subordinate argument submitted by the parties, especially if the argument on its very face is meritless.\n\n496.\n\nHaving found that the Tribunal in any case had jurisdiction to address the Law 42 dispute under the \"exception to the exception\" rule of Article X (2) of the Treaty, the question whether Law 42 is a \"matter of taxation\" has become moot and does not need to be addressed.\n\n**d. Application of Law 42 in the DCF Valuation**\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n497.\n\nTurning now to Respondent's substantive ground for annulment: in the Award the Tribunal decided that Law 42 should not be taken into consideration in determining the value of the investment, *i.e.* that in the DCF model the stream of income of Block 15 should not be reduced by the amount of the State Participation mandated by Law 42.\n\n498.\n\nThe Tribunal's decision can be summarized as follows:\n\n- The introduction of Law 42 implied a unilateral and substantial violation of the contractual framework agreed among the Parties in the Participation Contract421;\n\n- Claimants had a legitimate expectation that the Participation Contract would be complied with422;\n\n- Law 42 is in breach of the Participation Contract (and also of Article II (3) (a) Treaty, which creates an obligation to accord fair and equitable treatment to the Claimants' investment)423;\n\n- A State cannot reduce its liability on the basis of its own wrongful acts; Law 42 is wrongful, because it constitutes a breach of the Participation Contract424;\n\n- For all these reasons, the Tribunal decided to disregard Law 42 in its quantum valuation425.\n\nAward at 525.\n\nAward at 527.\n\nAward at 527.\n\nAward at 541.\n\nAward at 547.\n\n499.\n\nEcuador challenges these findings arguing that the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers and failed to state reasons, and that the Award should be annulled.\n\n500.\n\nThe Committee will briefly analyze each of the nine merits grounds for annulment invoked by Respondent and come to the conclusion that all of them should be dismissed. The numbering is the same one followed in the section \"Respondent's Position\" (some numbers are omitted, because jurisdictional grounds have already been analyzed in the preceding section)426:\n\nParas 491-496 *supra.*\n\nSecond\n------\n\n501.\n\nRespondent submits that the Tribunal expressly refused to apply international law when it disregarded the international law principle according to which\n\n\"States are not liable to pay compensation to a foreign investor when, in the normal exercise of their regulatory powers, they adopt in a nondiscriminatory manner *bona fide* regulation that are aimed at the general welfare\"427,\n\nmerely on the basis of a re-written Participation Contract428.\n\nAward fn. 65.\n\nR I at 729.\n\n502.\n\nIn fact, what happened was that the Tribunal affirmed the existence of such principle of international law429, but that, on the facts of the case, and because of Ecuador's failure to honour its contractual and Treaty obligations, offered Respondent no defense. There is no excess of powers.\n\nAward at 528-529.\n\nThird\n-----\n\n503.\n\nRespondent also argues that the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers by failing to apply the international law principle that the FET standard does not include a legitimate expectation that the State will not amend its laws and regulations, absent an express and specific stabilization undertaking by the State430.\n\nR I at 731.\n\n504.\n\nRespondent's complaint cannot succeed for analogous reasons. The Tribunal never contradicted the international law principle quoted by Respondent. The Tribunal correctly held that Claimants were entitled to assume that Ecuador would respect the contractual framework agreed between the Republic and the investor431.\n\nAward at 526.\n\nFourth\n------\n\n505.\n\nRespondent says that the Tribunal also manifestly exceeded its powers when it effectively disregarded the plain text of Law 42, which distinguishes between \"participation in volumes\" of crude oil (guaranteed by clause 8.1. of the Participation Contract and unaffected by Law 42) and \"participation in revenues\" obtained by the concessionary (impacted and reduced by Law 42, but not guaranteed by the Participation Contract), to conclude that Ecuador had breached the Participation Contract432.\n\nR I at 735.\n\n506.\n\nRespondent's annulment claim cannot succeed. Ecuador's challenge is not an annulment ground - it is a merit contention, already submitted to the Tribunal and dismissed by the Tribunal in the Award, with proper reasoning.\n\n507.\n\nIn para. 521 of the Award the Tribunal dealt with the very argument which the Respondent is now re-submitting as a ground for annulment. The Tribunal dismissed it with the reasoning set forth in paras. 523 and 524: under the Participation Contract, OEPC had the right to receive a participation in the crude oil produced, and to freely dispose of such participation at market prices433. The Tribunal correctly concluded that Law 42 affected this right and that by enacting Law 42 Respondent unilaterally modified the contractual framework agreed upon in the Participation Contract434.\n\nClauses 8.1, 8.2 and 5.3.2. of the Participation Contract; Award at 523-524.\n\nAward at 525.\n\nFifth\n-----\n\n508.\n\nEcuador submits that the Tribunal failed to apply the international law standard for determining the FMV of Block 15 (the willing buyer/willing seller standard) and thereby manifestly exceeded its powers435.\n\nR I at 739.\n\n509.\n\nThe ground of annulment is without merit. The willing buyer/willing seller standard is simply a valuation tool used for calculating compensation in certain circumstances. Tribunals have a wide discretion in selecting and applying valuation tools. Selection of one valuation tool in preference to another, or failure to apply a valuation tool does not give rise to a manifest excess of powers.\n\nSixth\n-----\n\n510.\n\nRespondent says that the Tribunal committed a glaring contradiction: in para. 510 of the Award when it defined Law 42 as a\n\n\"510. [\u2026] unilateral decision of the Ecuadorian Congress to allocate to the Ecuadorian State a defined percentage of revenues earned by contractor companies such as OEPC that hold participation contract\",\n\nwhile only one paragraph earlier it held that Law 42\n\n\"509. [\u2026] is neither a royalty, a tax, a levy or other measure of taxation under the Participation Contract\"436.\n\nAward at 509.\n\n511.\n\nThe claim is dismissed.\n\n512.\n\nThere is absolutely no contradiction between the Tribunal's statements in paras. 509 and 510.\n\n513.\n\nIn para. 509 the Tribunal simply states that the State Participation \"is neither a royalty, a tax, a levy or any other measure of taxation under the Participation Contract \", *i.e.* in accordance with Ecuadorian law. This is an undisputed conclusion, since Ecuador itself categorically averred that Law 42 is not a tax under Ecuadorian law, because it had not been enacted in accordance with the special legislative procedures required for the enactment of tax laws in Ecuador.\n\n514.\n\nPara. 510 then draws the only possible conclusion from the preceding analysis: since under Ecuadorian law the State Participation is not a tax, it must be a *sui generis* decision adopted by Congress to allocate to the State a defined percentage of revenues earned by concessionary companies.\n\nEighth\n------\n\n515.\n\nRespondent argues that the Tribunal failed to state reasons, when it acknowledged that the Participation Contract guaranteed OEPC a participation in the production of crude, but then found that \"by taking 50% of OEPC's revenues [Law 42] modified radically the participation percentages agreed in Clause 8.1\"437. If Clause 8.1, as the Tribunal held, allocates only crude production and not revenues, it is simply impossible to follow the Tribunal's rationale for concluding that Law 42's taking of a percentage of revenues constitutes a breach of clause 8.1438.\n\nAward at 523.\n\nR I at 751.\n\n516.\n\nThis ground for annulment is in fact a restatement of the fourth, this time under the guise of lack of reasons. It has no merit. The Tribunal's reasoning in paras. 521525 is coherent and permits a reader to follow the trail of analysis.\n\nNinth\n-----\n\n517.\n\nThe Republic submits that the Award fails to state reasons for the conclusion that Law 42 breached clause 5.3.2 of the Participation Contract439.\n\nR I at 757; the Parties have discussed whether Claimant had or not abandoned this claim; it would seem that, at least explicitly, Claimants never abandoned the claim; the discussion in any case is irrelevant for annulment purposes.\n\n518.\n\nClause 5.3.2 of the Participation Contract grants OEPC the right to\n\n\"recibir y disponer libremente de la Participaci\u00f3n de la Contratista establecida en la cl\u00e1usula 8.1\".\n\n519.\n\nBoth clauses are linked: clause 8.1. defines OEPC's participation, while clause 5.3.2. OEPC's right to receive it and freely dispose of it. The Tribunal found that the right to freely dispose440\n\n\"524. [...] becomes meaningless unless it includes the right \"freely\" to enjoy the revenues from such disposal. Law 42 extinguished that right with respect to half of all revenues accruing from sales by OEPC at a price in excess of the reference price\".\n\nAward at 524.\n\n520.\n\nThe Tribunal's reasoning permits any reader to get from point A to point B and establish the appropriate conclusion without difficulty. There is no failure to state reasons - although Respondent may not agree with the reasoning. The request is dismissed.\n\nTenth\n-----\n\n521.\n\nThe Republic avers that the Tribunal failed to state reasons for why the introduction of Law 42, aside from the contractual framework, implied a unilateral and substantial modification of the \" legal framework that existed at the time the Claimants negotiated and agreed the Participation Contract [\u2026]\"441. Besides, the Tribunal did not address the implications of the Constitutional Court's upholding of Law 42's legality, which included a response to arguments of breach of contract442.\n\nAward at 525, R I at 758.\n\nR II at 741.\n\n522.\n\nRespondent's argument is misplaced: the contractual framework was modified through the enactment of a Law, and consequently the applicable legal framework was also affected. Finally, whatever arguments the Ecuadorian Constitutional Court might have used is irrelevant for this arbitration: what is relevant are the arguments actually submitted by the Parties to the Tribunal in the course of the procedure. The request for annulment is dismissed.\n\nEleventh\n--------\n\n523.\n\nFinally, the Respondent argues that the Award failed to state the reasons for its holding that Law 42, in addition to a breach of the Participation Contract, flouts Claimants' legitimate expectations, considering that the FET standard does not equate to the stabilization of the legal framework443.\n\nR II at 742.\n\n524.\n\nEcuador's argument must be dismissed.\n\n525.\n\nIn para. 527 of the Award, the Tribunal found that \"Law 42 is in breach of the Participation Contract and flouts the Claimants' legitimate expectations\". The Tribunal had explained its decision in the preceding paragraph444:\n\n\"526. [...] The investor, OEPC, was justified in expecting that this contractual framework would be respected and certainly not modified unilaterally by the Respondent\".\n\nAn investor's legitimate expectations are those which have been embodied in the terms of the contract. Every investor who executes a contract with a State has an expectation that the State will comply with its obligations and not modify unilaterally the agreement reached.\n\nAward at 526.\n\n526.\n\nSumming up, the Committee concludes that the Tribunal's findings that it held jurisdiction to adjudicate the Law 42 dispute and that the State Participation mandated by Law 42 should not be deducted from the stream of income included in the DCF model do not give rise to any grounds for annulment.\n\n**6. The decision to disregard the VAT Interpretative Law**\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n527.\n\nIn 2001 the Ecuadorian tax authority altered its policy of refunding VAT to oil companies. The tax authority refused to grant such refunds in the future, and retrospectively sought to claim reimbursement of refunds already paid. Claimants claimed that this measure was a violation of the Treaty and Ecuadorian law and commenced the first investment arbitration against Ecuador, the so called VAT Arbitration445.\n\nAward at 170.\n\n528.\n\nIn 2004 the tribunal issued the VAT Award, which found that Ecuador was obliged to reimburse OEPC for VAT, that OEPC had a legitimate expectation that the tax would be reimbursed and that Ecuador had breached its Treaty obligations446. It ordered Ecuador to reimburse outstanding amounts - in excess of US$ 75 M.\n\nAward at 554.\n\n529.\n\nJust a few weeks after the VAT Award had been issued, the Ecuadorian Congress adopted the VAT Interpretative Law, a one article text that provided:\n\n\"Art. 1.- Interpr\u00e9tase el art\u00edculo 69-A (72) de la Ley de R\u00e9gimen Tributario Interno introducido por la Ley 99-24, publicada en el Suplemento del Registro Oficial No. 181 del 30 de abril de 1999, en el sentido de que el reintegro del Impuesto al Valor Agregado, IVA, no es aplicable a la actividad petrolera en lo referente a la extracci\u00f3n, transporte y comercializaci\u00f3n de petr\u00f3leo crudo, puesto que el petr\u00f3leo no se fabrica, sino que se lo extrae de los respectivos yacimientos\".\n\n530.\n\nThe Tribunal found that it was \"obvious\" that the VAT Interpretative Law \"was a direct response to the VAT Award\"447.\n\nAward at 557.\n\n531.\n\nEnactment of the VAT Interpretative Law gave rise to a doubt: whether it should be taken into consideration for quantifying Claimants' damages - a question very similar to that posed by Law 42 with regard to the State Participation.\n\n532.\n\nThe Tribunal analyzed the issue and decided not to reduce Claimants' damages on account of the VAT Interpretative Law. It found that the VAT Interpretative Law was designed to achieve the same objective as the administrative measures that the VAT Tribunal had already found to be in breach of Claimants' Treaty rights448:\n\n\"558. While the VAT Interpretative Law was presented as an attempt to clarify the confusion identified by the VAT Tribunal, the fact of the matter is that the VAT Interpretative Law accomplishes the very same effect as the SRI Decrees which the VAT Tribunal had found to be in breach of certain provisions of the Treaty\".\n\nAward at 558.\n\n533.\n\nThe Tribunal then stated449:\n\n\"560. In the view of the Tribunal, the VAT Interpretative Law, unfairly and arbitrarily, frustrated the legitimate expectations of the Claimants in precisely the same way as the SRI's Decrees and is thus also in breach of the Treaty. As such, as between the Claimants and the Respondent, the VAT Interpretative Law is without legal effect and should not be taken into account as a factor which impacts the fair market value of the Claimants' investment\".\n\nAward at 560.\n\n534.\n\nAnd concluded450:\n\n\"564. As the Tribunal emphasized earlier, *nullus commodum capere de sua injuria propria* : a State cannot be allowed to take advantage of its own wrongful act. The result of the implementation of that well-known principle of international law is that \"the effects of actions taken by the nationalizing State in relation to the enterprise which actions may have depressed its value\" must be disregarded in the determination of that value. The Tribunal, applying that principle to the facts of the present case, concludes that it must disregard the VAT Interpretative Law in determining the fair market value of the Claimants' investment\" [Footnotes omitted].\n\nAward at 564, footnotes omitted.\n\n535.\n\nThe Tribunal could have stopped here. But it didn't. It added an *alternative* argument - that the VAT Interpretative Law should also be disregarded because it triggered Clause 8.6 (e) of the Participation Contract, entitling the hypothetical willing buyer to apply a correction factor to offset the economic burden451.\n\nAward at 763-769.\n\n536.\n\nClause 8.6 (e) of the Participation Contract reads as follows:\n\n\"8.6. Estabilidad econ\u00f3mica: En caso de que por acci\u00f3n del Estado Ecuatoriano o PETROECUADOR, ocurriere cualquiera de los eventos que se describen a continuaci\u00f3n, que tenga consecuencias en la econom\u00eda de este Contrato de Participaci\u00f3n :\n\n[...]\n\ne. Cobro del Impuesto al valor Agregado IVA conforme consta en el Oficio No. 01044 de 5 de octubre de 1998, que consta como Anexo No. XVI, mediante el cual la Direcci\u00f3n de Servicio de Rentas Internas manifiesta que las Importaciones que realice la Contratista para la[s] operaciones del Bloque 15 bajo el esquema del Contrato de Participaci\u00f3n, est\u00e1n gravadas con dicho tributo.\n\nEn los casos se\u00f1alados en los literales [...] e) se incluir\u00e1 un factor de correcci\u00f3n en los porcentajes de participaci\u00f3n, que absorba el incremento o disminuci\u00f3n de la carga econ\u00f3mica, conforme al Anex[o] No. XIV\" [Emphasis added].\n\n537.\n\nThe Tribunal's alternative reasoning is contained in paras. 567, 568 and 569 of the Award:\n\n\"567. It is clear that, for the correction factor to be triggered automatically into effect, the VAT Interpretative Law must be found to have an impact on the economy of the Participation Contract. The Tribunal notes that the parties to the Participation Contract did not in any way specify how that impact was to be measured. It is thus left to the Tribunal, in the exercise of its discretion, to do so.\n\n568. The Tribunal recalls that the VAT Award held that OEPC has \"a right to reimbursement (of the VAT) under the law\" and that \"this reimbursement was not included in OEPC's contract\". The right of the Claimants to be reimbursed the Value Added Tax has now been legislated out of existence. There is no doubt, in the view of the Tribunal, that the VAT Interpretative Law has thereby increased the economic burden of the Claimants and thus impacted the economy of the Participation Contract.\n\n569. Consequently, any hypothetical willing buyer of OEPC's rights under the Participation Contract, relying on the findings and conclusions of the VAT Tribunal, would be entitled to apply for a correction factor in the participation percentages to absorb the increase in its economic burden in accordance with Clause 8.6 and Annex No. XIV of the Participation Contract\" [Footnotes omitted].\n\n538.\n\nEcuador now avers that the Tribunal failed to provide satisfactory reasoning for its alternative finding and that the failure to state reasons merits annulment of the Award.\n\n**A. The Parties' Positions**\n-----------------------------\n\n539.\n\nRespondent takes issue with the Tribunal's reasoning. The Award simply equated the terms \"economy of the contract\" (clause 8.6 (e) first paragraph) and \"economic burden\" (clause 8.6 (e) last paragraph), implying that every collection of VAT had *ipso facto* an impact on the economy of the Participation Contract. Considering the Parties' diverging positions in this respect, this finding warranted some kind of explanation, as arbitrator Stern noted in her dissent452.\n\nDissent at 14.\n\n540.\n\nAccording to Respondent, the reasoning of the Award fits into one summary sentence, which fails to provide any reason whatsoever as to why the concepts of \"economic burden\" and \"economy of the contract\" should be understood as being equivalent453:\n\n\"568. [...] There is no doubt, in the view of the Tribunal, that the VAT Interpretative Law has thereby increased the economic burden of the Claimants and thus impacted the economy of the Participation Contract\"454.\n\nR II at 758.\n\nAward at 568, R I at 767.\n\n541.\n\nClaimants disagree.\n\n542.\n\nEcuador's challenge to the Award's *obiter* reasoning regarding Claimants' alternative argument cannot undermine the Tribunal's conclusion that the VAT Interpretative Law should be disregarded455. As Ecuador itself notes, \"the Parties agree that the failure to address a particular argument they raised does not warrant annulment unless it was \u2018decisive', *i.e.*, material to the tribunal's decision (not *obiter dictum*)\"456. Since the clause 8.6 (e) argument was not material to the majority's decision, the Committee need not consider Ecuador's arguments about it457.\n\nC II at 327.\n\nR II at 114.\n\nC II at 330.\n\n543.\n\nClaimants add that the Tribunal in any case provided substantial reasons for the argument458 and that Ecuador's complaint boils down to the proposition that the Tribunal should have addressed a question that was not before the Tribunal -whether \"economy of the contract\" and \"economic burden\" were equivalent to one another. The Tribunal was asked to decide \"whether or not clause 8.6 (e) of the Contract is triggered into effect in the circumstances of the present case\"459 and this is exactly what the Tribunal did460.\n\nC II at 326.\n\nAward at 565.\n\nC II at 332.\n\n**B. The Committee's Decision**\n-------------------------------\n\n544.\n\nThe Tribunal's conclusion with regard to the VAT Interpretative Law is that it should not be taken into consideration in the DCF model used for valuing Claimants' investment (thus increasing the compensation in an amount which Respondent estimates in the US$ 30 M range461). The main reason for this finding is analogous to that used to exclude Law 42: the enactment of the VAT Interpretative Law was in breach of Claimants' rights under the Treaty and thus could not be used to reduce Respondent's liability462.\n\nR I at 765.\n\nAward at 564.\n\n545.\n\nEcuador is not asking the Committee to annul this finding. Neither does Ecuador challenge the reasoning invoked by the Tribunal to support it. Ecuador only challenges an additional argument adduced by the Tribunal, and it does so for alleged failure to state reasons.\n\n546.\n\nAfter having reached its conclusion with regard to the VAT Interpretative Law, the Tribunal could have stopped its reasoning. It did not. Instead the Tribunal took up an additional argument to confirm the conclusion it had already reached: even if the VAT Interpretative Law were to be applied (*quod non*), clause 8.6 (e) of the Participation Contract required that a correction factor be introduced, neutralizing the effect of the VAT Interpretative Law463.\n\nAward at 570.\n\n547.\n\nEcuador is asking the Committee to annul this additional argument for lack of reasons.\n\n548.\n\nEcuador's request cannot succeed. Committees are empowered to annul decisions, if the Tribunal fails to state the reasons on which such decisions are based (not the reasoning itself). In this case it is undisputed that the decision not to apply the VAT Interpretative Law is properly reasoned. The existence or inexistence or the quality of any additional reasoning can never lead to annulment of the decision.\n\n549.\n\nIn any case, the reasoning underlying the additional argument brought up by the Tribunal can be properly followed from point A to point B through to its conclusions, as Claimants have convincingly explained in their Second Submission464.\n\nC II at 326.\n\n**7. The Decision to disregard Alternatives to** ***C******aducidad***\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n550.\n\nEcuador argued in the course of the arbitration that the HCL only authorized the Republic two actions in response to Claimants' unauthorized transfer of rights: it could either declare *caducidad* or do nothing465. The Tribunal rejected the contention and identified various alternatives466 :\n\n\"434. In summary, the Tribunal considers that the foregoing options existed as an alternative to *caducidad*, namely:\n\ni) insistence on payment of a transfer fee in the order of USD 11.8 million; and/or\n\nii) improvements to the economic terms of the original contract; and/or\n\niii) a negotiated settlement which could of course have covered any areas that the parties so desired, including payment of the transfer fee which had been avoided, renegotiation of the contract and additional compensation\" [Footnote omitted].\n\nR I at 711.\n\nAward at 434.\n\n**A. The Parties' Positions**\n-----------------------------\n\n551.\n\nRespondent first argues that the Tribunal's finding that Ecuador did have alternatives to declaring *caducidad* was a manifest excess of powers, \"since a simple review of the Participation Contract and the HCL shows no such alternative\"467.\n\nR I at 712.\n\n552.\n\nEcuador then submits a second argument: the consequence of having lawful alternatives is that such alternatives should have been considered in assessing damages owed to Claimants. Otherwise any damages award would overcompensate and unjustly enrich the Claimants468. Damages should have consisted in the difference between the FMV of Block 15 and the amount of any of those alternative sanctions. In awarding damages that failed to consider these alternatives the Tribunal failed to apply, or alternatively grossly misapplied, international law on damages and thus manifestly exceeded its powers469. The Tribunal also failed to state reasons for its decision470.\n\nR I at 714-716.\n\nR II at 646.\n\nR II at 648.\n\n553.\n\nClaimants disagree.\n\n554.\n\nAs regards the first ground for annulment invoked by Ecuador, Claimants aver that Respondent has failed to elaborate and to cite any excess of powers471.\n\nC I at 516.\n\n555.\n\nAddressing the second ground, Claimants allege that Ecuador could have argued that the damages should be reduced on account of the costs of alternatives to *caducidad*. It chose not to do so.\n\n556.\n\nEcuador had in fact submitted a counterclaim for the Claimants' failure to pay the required assignment fee and negotiate a new Participation Contract - which correspond to some of the alternatives to *caducidad*472*.* But then Ecuador withdrew the counterclaim473.\n\nAward at 854.\n\nAward at 869.\n\n557.\n\nEcuador cannot now fault the Tribunal for failing to quantify these alternatives, because other than the cost of the transfer fee, Ecuador never presented evidence on the economic impact of these alternatives474. A Tribunal is not required to address every single argument presented by the parties, especially an argument that was introduced as a counterclaim that was dropped and that became redundant given the very large penalty imposed by the Tribunal to reflect Claimants' contributory negligence475.\n\nC I at 250-251.\n\nC I at 255.\n\n**B. The Committee's Decision**\n-------------------------------\n\n558.\n\nRespondent submits two separate grounds for annulment.\n\n559.\n\nThe first is based on the argument that a simple review of the Participation Contract and the HCL shows that there is no alternative to *caducidad* and that the Tribunal committed a manifest excess of powers when it held otherwise. The ground was not further elaborated, and received no further attention in Respondent's Reply476. In any case it is without merit. The Tribunal came to the conclusion that alternatives to *caducidad* existed, and the Respondent has not been able to prove that this constitutes an error of law (and even less so that it is an egregious error of law which merits annulment).\n\nSee R II at 642-652.\n\n560.\n\nThe second ground is that the Tribunal should have considered in its quantum calculation the impact of an alternative to *caducidad.* The difficulty in this argument is that it was never pleaded by Respondent in the arbitration, and that the Tribunal already factored into the compensation calculation a 25% reduction as a sanction for Claimants' behaviour. It can never lead to annulment of the Award.\n\n561.\n\nThe ground for annulment is dismissed.\n\n**8. The Tribunal's Email dated February 15, 2011**\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n562.\n\nDuring the month of November of 2009 a hearing on quantum was held in Paris. A few months thereafter, on 12 February 2010 Claimants, acting on behalf of both Parties, made the following procedural proposal to the Tribunal477:\n\n\"557. Moreover, the Tribunal's request followed the parties' own procedural proposal that Claimants had articulated a year earlier in their letter of February 12, 2010:\n\n*\"*Both parties have stated to the Tribunal that they are willing to return their models with inputs requested by the Tribunal if the Tribunal were to find that helpful in preparing a final award\". CEA-80, Claimants' Letter of February 12, 2010\". [Emphasis added].\n\nC I at 557.\n\n563.\n\nA year later the Tribunal took up this offer. On 15 February 2011 the President sent the following email (the \" **February Email** \") to the Parties478:\n\n\"The Tribunal has reached the point in its deliberations where it requires the assistance of both parties' experts, Mr. Joseph Kalt and Mr. Daniel Johnston, in order to help the Tribunal assess the proper calculation of damages.\n\nTherefore, in accordance with Rule 34 (2) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules, the Tribunal calls upon the parties to produce Messrs. Kalt and Johnston for consultation with the Tribunal at the ICSID's headquarters in Washington at 10.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 27 April 2011. If the parties agree, the Tribunal would wish to consult with the parties' experts alone without the presence of counsel\".[Emphasis added].\n\nDoc. EEA 175.\n\n564.\n\nThe experts' cooperation eventually led to a Joint Expert Report that presented an agreed DCF valuation, on which the Tribunal relied in its damages calculation479.\n\nAward at 692, 708-778.\n\n**A. The Parties' Positions**\n-----------------------------\n\n565.\n\nRespondent argues that the Tribunal committed a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure by issuing the February Email: it was a \"determination of liability\" which failed to state reasons, and thus violated Article 48(3) of the Convention and Arbitration Rule 47, which require that the award state the reasons upon which it is based480.\n\nR I at 483-484.\n\n566.\n\nEcuador does not deny that the Tribunal had the authority to call upon the Parties to produce evidence pertinent to the issues in dispute. Ecuador's challenge is that, in so doing, the Tribunal communicated to the Parties its ultimate decision on liability, without any reasoning or explanation whatsoever481. Ecuador avers that ICSID tribunals should only issue a decision on liability by way of an award. Yet the Tribunal did not follow that orthodox approach. It communicated its ultimate decision on liability through the February Email482.\n\nR II at 363.\n\nR II at 366.\n\n567.\n\nClaimants disagree.\n\n568.\n\nIn Claimants' submission, Ecuador's claim fails on the very first hurdle: it cannot properly identify the relevant rule of procedure that could have plausibly been violated483. The Tribunal was acting perfectly within its powers as articulated in Article 43 of the Convention and Arbitration Rule 34 (2), which empower tribunals to call upon the parties to produce documents, witnesses and experts484. Articles 48 and 49 of the Convention (and Arbitration Rules 47 and 48) only apply to final awards, and not to other, less formal communications. The February Email was not a decision on liability - and certainly not an ultimate one. The Tribunal did not purport to have reached a conclusive decision, and the arbitrators were free to present any award they saw fit, after the February Email485.\n\nC I at 554.\n\nC I at 554-555.\n\nC II at 180-181.\n\n**B. The Committee's Decision**\n-------------------------------\n\n569.\n\nThis claim for annulment is submitted under Article 52 (1) (d) of the Convention: that the Tribunal has committed a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure - a ground with a high standard for its acceptance486.\n\nSee para 62 *supra.*\n\n570.\n\nRespondent argues that the February Email sent by the Tribunal meets these requirements, because, although it is not an award, it formalizes the Tribunal's final and binding decision accepting the Respondent's liability, without providing any reasoning, and thus flouts Article 48(3) of the Convention.\n\n571.\n\nThe argument is totally without merit.\n\n572.\n\nA *quantum* hearing had been held in November 2009. Thereafter both Parties had offered the participation of their experts to re-run the DCF model with input from the Tribunal. In the February Email the Tribunal simply accepted this offer - a decision which was well within its powers under Article 43 of the Convention and under Arbitration Rule 34 (2).\n\n573.\n\nThe February Email is not a final and binding decision on quantum. It is simply a procedural request for the Parties' experts to come forward and help the Tribunal in the assessment of damages. It did not create *res iudicata*. Every arbitrator remained free to decide on the merits one way or another. The February Email did not formalize a merits decision. Since it did not, the Tribunal was not required to provide reasons.\n\n574.\n\nThe ground for annulment is dismissed.\n\n**VIII. Costs and expenses**\n----------------------------\n\n575.\n\nThe Parties submitted their statements on costs simultaneously on June 8, 2015. Ecuador informed the Committee that its total costs incurred in connection with this annulment proceeding were US$ 4,098,034.26 in legal fees, plus US$ 547,102.11 in administrative costs and US$ 973,440.50 in ICSID costs (registration fee and Ad Hoc Committee's fees)487.\n\nRespondent's Statement on Costs, p 1.\n\n576.\n\nClaimants declared that their legal fees and expenses in connection with this annulment proceeding were US$ 3,932,575.79 in legal fees, plus US$ 508,209.06 in administrative costs488.\n\nClaimants' Statement on Costs, p 1.\n\n577.\n\nEcuador has requested that its legal and arbitration costs be borne by Claimants489.\n\nR I at 771 iii); R II at 770 iii).\n\n578.\n\nArticle 61(2) of the ICSID Convention provides as follows:\n\nthe Tribunal shall, except as the parties otherwise agree, assess the expenses incurred by the parties in connection with the proceedings, and shall decide how and by whom those expenses, the fees and expenses of the members of the Tribunal and the charges for the use of the facilities of the Centre shall be paid. Such decision shall form part of the award\".\n\n579.\n\nArticle 52(4) extends the application of this provision to annulment proceedings.\n\n580.\n\nNeither Ecuador nor Claimants have completely prevailed in the present annulment proceedings. The Republic was requesting a decision annulling the Award in its entirety - the Committee has dismissed this request. Alternatively, Ecuador submitted a petition for partial annulment, which the Committee has accepted. Claimants were defending the full validity of the Decision and the Award.\n\n581.\n\nThe Committee has thus not ruled completely in favour of any of the parties. Ecuador's claims were *prima facie* serious. Furthermore, each side presented valid and reasonable arguments in support of its respective case, and both acted fairly and professionally.\n\n582.\n\nIn view of these circumstances, the Tribunal decides that Claimants shall bear one half, and Respondent the other half of the costs incurred by ICSID in relation to the proceedings, and that each side shall bear its own litigation costs and other expenses. Since Respondent has advanced US$ 1,000,000 towards the costs incurred by ICSID, Claimants shall reimburse Respondent half of that amount, by offset against the compensation due under the Award.\n\n**IX. Summary**\n---------------\n\n583.\n\nRespondent requested in its Reply on Annulment that the Committee:\n\n\"i. Annul the Award in its enterity; or\n\nii. alternatively, partially annul the Award as described in this Reply on Annulment at paragraphs 230, 285, 358, 391, 404, 494, 641, 652, 745, and 769; and\n\niii. in any event order Claimants to bear the entire costs of this annulment proceeding, including the ICSID costs and Ecuador's legal costs and other expenses\".\n\n584.\n\nAs regards its first petition, Ecuador alleged four grounds which would result in annulment of the Decision on Jurisdiction and, consequently of the entire Award. The Committee rejected all of these grounds. Ecuador also submitted a number of additional grounds for the total annulment of the Award, which the Tribunal also rejected. Thus Ecuador's first petition is entirely dismissed.\n\n585.\n\nAs regards Ecuador's alternative petition for partial annulment, such petition has succeeded. The Committee has found that the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers by wrongly assuming jurisdiction with regard to the investment now beneficially owned by the Chinese investor Andes, with the result that the compensation owed to Claimants should be reduced from 100% to 60% of the value of Block 15.\n\n586.\n\nThe Tribunal has established the value of 100% of Block 15, i.e. of the Farmout Property, at US$ 2,359,500,000. Consequently, the value of a 60% interest would amount to US$ 1,415,700,000. Applying to this amount the 25% reduction factor explained in para. 825 of the Award, the resulting amount is US$ 1,061,775,000. This is the proper amount that should have been inserted in Sub-paragraph (v) of the dispositive section of the Award490, reading as follows:\n\n\"876. [...] (v) Claimants are awarded the amount of US$ 1,061,775,000 (US One billion, sixty one millions, seven hundred seventy five thousand dollars), as calculated in paragraph 825 of this Award, for damages suffered as a result of the breaches set out above in subparagraphs (i), (ii) and (iii)\".\n\nThe same conclusion could be reached by simply calculating 60% of US$ 1,769,625,000\n\n587.\n\nThe rest of the Award remains unaffected.\n\n588.\n\nRespondent alleged a number of additional grounds for partial annulment of the Tribunals' decision to award damages to Claimants based on a 100% (and not a 60%) interest in the Farmout Property or which pertain to the 60/40 issue. These grounds have become moot.\n\n589.\n\nFinally, with regard to costs, the Committee has decided that Claimants shall bear one half, and Respondent the other half of the ICSID costs in relation to these proceedings, and that each side shall bear its own litigation costs and other expenses.\n\n**X. DECISION**\n---------------\n\n590.\n\nFor the reasons set forth above, the Committee unanimously renders the following decision:\n\n1. The Committee partially annuls the Award, on the ground of manifest excess of powers [ICSID Convention Article 52(1)(b)], to the extent that the Tribunal assumed jurisdiction with regard to the investment now beneficially owned by the Chinese investor Andes (and previously by the Bermudan company AEC), with the result that the proper compensation owed by Respondent to Claimants should be the amount calculated in para. 586 of this Decision.\n\n2. The rest of the Award remains unaffected.\n\n3. All other grounds of Respondent's application for annulment are rejected.\n\n4. Each Party shall bear one half of the ICSID costs, and its own litigation costs and expenses incurred with respect to this annulment proceeding.\n\n5. The stay of enforcement of the Award is declared automatically terminated in accordance with Rule 54(3) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules."}]}
